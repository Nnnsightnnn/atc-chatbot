Introduction

Welcome to Monster Manual V. This book contains new

creatures for use in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. The

monster entries are generally alphabetical by name, but

closely related monsters are grouped together under a single

heading. In addition to the table of contents at the front of

this book, monsters are listed by type and subtype on page

222, and by Challenge Rating and ECL on page 4.

This introduction explains how to read each creatures

entry. Refer to the glossary on pages 206222 for de nitions

of terms you are not familiar with.

READING THE ENTRIES

Each  monster  entry  is  organized  in  the  same  format,

as outlined below. For complete information about the

characteristics of monsters, consult the glossary of this

book, the Players Handbook (PH), or the Dungeon Masters

Guide (DMG).

We want this book to be as useful to DMs as possible, so the

statistics are presented in a format that makes them easier to

use right off the page. This format is divided into  ve sections

separated by horizontal lines. Each section serves a speci c

purpose; you need to reference different sections at different

times during an encounter.

IDENTIFICATION AND ENCOUNTER

The top section identi es the creature and gives the informa-

tion you need at the start of an encounter.

Name: This word or phrase identi es the creature.

CR: This value is the Challenge Rating of an individual

creature of this kind.

Race, Class, and Level: This information is provided only

for creatures that have class levels.

Alignment: The one- or two-letter abbreviation that

appears here denotes the creatures alignment. A term that

describes how likely this alignment is to apply, as de ned

in the glossary, might also appear here. Speci c NPCs dont

include the extra term.

Size and Type: The creatures size category and its type

(and subtype or subtypes, if applicable) are given here.

Init:  This  value  is  the  creatures  modi er  on  initiative

checks.

Senses: The Senses entry indicates whether the creature

has darkvision, low-light vision, scent, or some other sen-

sory special quality, along with the creatures modifiers on

Listen and Spot checks (even if the creature has no ranks

in those skills).

Aura: This indicates special abilities that take effect

anytime another creature comes within a certain distance,

such as a devils fear aura.

Languages: This entry gives the languages the creature

speaks or understands, as well as any special abilities relat-

ing to communication (such as telepathy or an inability

to speak).

DEFENSIVE INFORMATION

This section provides the information you need when char-

acters are attacking the creature.

AC: This entry gives the creatures Armor Class against

most attacks, followed by its AC against touch attacks and its

AC when  at-footed. If the creature has feats or other abilities

that modify its Armor Class under speci c circumstances

(such as the Mobility feat), they are noted here.

hp: This entry consists of the creatures full normal hit

point total (usually average rolls on each Hit Die), followed

by the creatures Hit Dice in parentheses. If the creature has

fast healing, regeneration, damage reduction (DR), or some

other ability that affects the amount of damage it takes or

the rate at which it regains hit points, that information also

appears here.

Immune: Any immunities the creature has are indicated

here. This includes immunity to speci c types of energy as

well as other immunities (such as immunity to poison or to

sleep effects).

Resist and SR: If the creature has resistance to certain

kinds of attacks, that information is given here. The creatures

spell resistance, if any, appears after the other resistances on

the same line.

Fort,  Ref,  Will:  This  entry  gives  the  creatures  saving

throw modi ers. Altered saving throw bonuses for speci c

circumstances also appear on this line.

Weakness: This entry details any weaknesses or vul-

nerabilities the creature has, such as light sensitivity or

vulnerability to a type of energy.

OFFENSIVE INFORMATION

Refer to this section when its the creatures turn to act in

combat.  All  a  creatures  combat  options  are  detailed  here,

even those that are not strictly offensive.

Speed:  This  entry  begins  with  the  creatures  base  land

speed in feet and in squares on the battle grid, followed by

speeds for other modes of movement, if applicable.

Melee/Ranged:  Typically,  these  entries  give  all  the

physical attacks the creature can make when taking a full

attack action. The  rst attack described is the creatures

preferred form of attack, usually a melee attack of some sort

but possibly (as in the example below) a ranged attack. If the

creature can make only a single attack (for instance, when

it is taking an attack action), use the  rst indicated attack

bonus. Occasionally, a creature has separate options indicated

for single attacks and for full attacks. For example, a Small

creature with the Manyshot and Rapid Shot feats might have

the following entries:

Ranged +1 longbow +8 (2d6+2/3) with Manyshot or

Ranged +1 longbow +10/+10/+5 (1d6+1/3) with Rapid Shot

Each set of attack routines is prefaced by a boldface word

indicating  whether  the  attacks  are  melee  or  ranged.  Next

comes the weapon used for the attack, the modi ed attack

bonus, the amount of damage the attack deals, and informa-

tion about critical hits. If the weapon has the default critical

hit characteristics (threat on a 20 and 2 damage), this portion

of the entry is omitted.

Space and Reach: These entries de ne how large an area

the creature takes up on the battle grid, as well as how far

a creatures natural reach extends and any reach weapons it

might use.

Base  Atk:  The  Base  Atk  entry  gives  the  creatures  base

attack bonus without any modi ers.

Grp: This entry gives the creatures grapple modi er.

Atk Options: Special abilities that the creature can employ

to modify its normal attacks appear here. Such abilities might

include feats such as Power Attack or special abilities such

as smite evil.

Special Actions: This entry gives any special actions

that the creature can take on its turn in place of making

attacks.

Combat  Gear:  Possessions  that  the  creature  can  use

an action to employ on its turn appear here. Such items

might include doses of poison (applied poisons, not natural

ones), scrolls, potions, oils, wands, staffs, rods, and other

wondrous items.

Spells Known or Spells Prepared: This entry appears

for spellcasters. It occurs as spells known for sorcerers

and members of other classes who do not prepare spells,

and spells prepared for wizards, clerics, and others who

do prepare them in advance. It begins with the creatures

caster level for spells. If a creatures rolls to overcome spell

resistance  are  based  on  a  number  other  than  its  caster

level (because of the Spell Penetration feat, for example),

the creatures total modifier is given after the expression

spell pen. Spells known are detailed from highest level

to 0 level, and each includes an attack bonus and a saving

throw DC, if appropriate. If the character casts some spells

at a different caster level than others, that information is

also specified here.

A clerics statistics block also includes the name of his deity

(if applicable) and the domains to which he has access. Each

domain spell he has prepared is marked with a superscript D.

The granted powers of his domains might appear as combat

options or resistances, or not at all if they only modify

information presented elsewhere.

Spell-Like Abilities: Any spell-like abilities the crea-

ture  possesses  appear  here.  The  entry  begins  with  the

creatures caster level for these abilities. As with spells,

this entry includes attack bonuses and saving throw DCs

when appropriate.

OTHER INFORMATION

Information presented in this section is rarely specifically

relevant  during  an  encounter,  but  its  useful  for  other

purposes.

Abilities: The creatures ability scores appear here in the

customary order (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha).

SA: For the purpose of determining the effect of feats and

the  application  of  templates,  the  creatures  special  attacks

are given here even if they appear elsewhere in the statistics

block. Speci c NPCs dont include this information.

SQ: Only those special qualities not shown elsewhere

in the statistics block are included here. For each creature,

special qualities include any abilities that arent delineated

as special attacks.

Feats:  This  entry  lists  all  the  feats  the  creature  pos-

sesses,  including  those  that  appear  elsewhere  in  the

statistics block.

Skills: This entry shows all the skill modi ers for skills

in which the creature has ranks. Modi ers are also provided

for skills to which racial modi ers, bonuses from synergy,

or other modi ers apply, even if the creature has no ranks

in those skills.

Possessions: This entry lists the items the creature is

wearing or carrying that arent considered combat gear. If the

creature has combat gear, the expression combat gear plus

appears to remind you to refer to the Combat Gear entry.

Spellbook: This entry gives the spells in the creatures

spellbook, if it has one. The notation spells prepared plus

indicates that the spells the creature has prepared are part of

this list, but those spells are not reiterated here.

SPECIAL ABILITY DESCRIPTIONS

The final portion of the statistics block consists of para-

graphs explaining special abilities noted earlier. When

youre running a monster, its good to be familiar with these

descriptions beforehand. However, they are written for ease

of use and include important information such as save DCs

and damage.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

This section contains guidance for running the creature.

Does the creature favor charging into combat or attacking

at range? Does it prefer weapons or spells?

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

This section brie y describes the groups a creature forms

and the relationship it might have to other creatures. Is it a

solitary monster, or does it tend to gather in hordes? Sample

encounters detail the Encounter Levels of groups or even

speci c adventure seeds.

ECOLOGY

SOCIETY

Where does the creature live? What does it hunt or eat? What

hunts or eats it? When appropriate, the ecology section offers

insights into the creatures life cycle.

Environment: Speci c terms to describe climate (warm,

temperate, or cold) and terrain (plains, hills, forests, marshes,

mountains,  or  deserts)  are  used  to  let  you  know  where  a

creature  prefers  to  live.  Some  creatures  are  subterranean.

Others have no place in the natural environment (particu-

larly constructs and undead) and might be found anywhere.

Extraplanar outsiders are assigned a plane of origin.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  This  section  states

the average height of a bipedal creature, or whatevers most

appropriate for a nonbipedal one, and the creatures weight.

It discusses any signi cant physical differences between ages

or genders.

Alignment:  The  creatures  statistics  block  indicates  its

alignment. Here is a discussion of the creatures philosophy

or its general behavior within the gamut that an alignment

offers.

LORE

Monster Manual V offers a table of lore with each monsters

entry. That lore can be gleaned by a character who makes an

appropriate Knowledge check. The baseline DC to identify

a  monster  and  remember  one  bit  of  information  about

its special abilities or vulnerabilities is equal to 10 + the

monsters CR. (This is a change from the description of the

Knowledge skill, PH 78.) As can be seen on individual tables

in the monster entries, every 5 points by which the check

result exceeds the DC yields another piece of information.

Information  speci c  to  the  creature,  such  as  its  type  of

damage reduction, spell-like abilities, or immunities, comes

with higher check results.

The preceding rule addresses speci c creatures well, but

more can to be said about creatures of general types. Consider

the adaru demon (page 20) as an example. Its a CR 10 crea-

ture. Identifying it speci cally requires a successful DC 20

Knowledge (the planes) check. However, since lowly CR 2

demons such as the dretch are out there, sharing outsider and

tanarri traits with the adaru, its reasonable to assume that

identifying those outsider and tanarri traits is a relatively

easy task.

Except when otherwise noted, an appropriate and suc-

cessful DC 15 Knowledge check reveals all of a creatures

type and subtype traits as defined in the glossary. This

often  includes  information  about  energy  resistance  or

various  immunities.  For  instance,  a  DC 15  Knowledge

(arcana)  check  reveals  that  dragons  are  hard  to  kill

(12-sided  HD)  and  resilient  (all  good  saves).  They  have

darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision, and they

are immune to sleep effects and paralysis effects. They eat,

sleep, and breathe.

Intelligent creatures often form societies and have particular

worldviews. Here are details about their thoughts, social

interactions, religion, and government. How do creatures

view themselves, each other, and other races? What do they

value? Whats normal for them?

SAMPLE LAIR

Some creatures (the rylkars and the tirbanas) have an entry

showing a sample lair complete with area descriptions.

TYPICAL TREASURE

This information expresses typical treasure values and trea-

sure preferences. Some creatures dont have treasure. Others

have  their  treasure  merely  expressed  in  their  Possessions

entries. This section of the description is where you can  nd

more information if it applies. For cultured societies, sample

art objects, jewelry, and other creature-speci c  avor pieces

might be described.

A creature that has been advanced by class levels has trea-

sure equal to an NPC of its Challenge Rating, not its ECL.

CREATURES AS CHARACTERS

If a creature offers exciting possibilities for play as a character,

this section provides the statistics and level adjustment.

CREATURES WITH CLASS LEVELS

If the creature advances by class, but is not suitable for play as

a character, this section discusses its favored class and associ-

ated classes (if any), and it might offer information about its

deity and domains or other class-based information.

ADVANCED CREATURES

If a creature advances by Hit Dice, the Advancement line in

its statistics block gives the break points. This section of the

description, when present, discusses the whys and wherefores

of  the  creatures  increased  size  and  abilities.  For  example,

given a subterranean creature, are the larger specimens found

deeper in the earth? Is its growth a result of good feeding,

good environment, age, or simple happenstance?

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

If the creature can be useful to a player character as an animal

companion, familiar, planar ally, mount, or summoned

monster, relevant information is included here.

ARCADIAN AVENGER

A female with angular features and bright, metallic  esh stalks

toward you, her wings as sharp and threatening as her two readied

swords. Each of her movements is framed by perfect symmetryshe

never moves her right blade forward without moving the left blade

back in equal measure. Sparing a glance for each part of the room

Possessions 2 masterwork longswords

Blade Rend (Ex) If an Arcadian avenger hits a single target

with at least one attack from each of her swords during a

full attack, she deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.

Wrath (Ex) Any time the Arcadian avenger sees an ally fall in

battle, she gains a +2 morale bonus on melee damage

rolls. The bonus lasts for 1 minute.

Elude Chance (Su) Three times per day, as an immediate

action, an Arcadian avenger can tap directly into the

power of law, allowing her to avoid the uncertainty of

chance. When an Arcadian avenger activates this ability,

her next melee attack or saving throw is treated as if the

result of the die roll were 10.

Arcadian  avengers  populate  the  grand  legions  of  Arcadia,

providing the force necessary to protect the utopian plane.

Although they have humanoid features, Arcadian avengers

spring forth from the pure forces of law, and as such their

outlook and thoughts are as alien to the mortal races as are

those of demons and devils. Arcadian avengers see all situ-

ations as a series of applied rules, and are free of hesitation,

doubt, and remorse. Because of this, they come into con ict

even with good creatures that have broken rules or laws.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Arcadian avengers approach combat as a systematic series of

calculations, constantly assessing the most logical means of

attack. They weigh each foes ability to harm them and bal-

ance that against their ability to take that foe down quickly.

This  usually  means  that  Arcadian  avengers  focus   rst  on

spellcasters and other nonmelee types, attempting to nullify

these powerful  gures before they can unleash their magic.

An Arcadian avenger spends a round measuring her ability

to hit a foe before employing her elude chance abilityher

preferred tactic is to wait until she has hit with her  rst attack

in a round and then use elude chance to ensure that her blade

rend ability affects the foe.

Multiple Arcadian avengers move in perfect concert, using

5-foot adjustments to create situations when each  anks a foe

she is attacking.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Arcadian avengers are usually encountered with a spellcaster

or  other  creature  capable  of  summoning  them  away  from

Arcadia. They are drawn to outbreaks of chaos and disorder,

and they  nd their way to mortal realms more frequently in

times of strife and war.

Punishers (EL 10): A group of four Arcadian avengers has

been sent to apprehend the party because of a past action that

disturbed law or order. The characters must decide whether

to  ght the avengers. To avoid doing so, they need to  nd

some way to atone for their crimes.

ECOLOGY

Arcadian avengers defend the perfect harmony of Arcadia,

speci cally the lawful edicts of that plane. With their strict

code of conduct and adherence to law over good, it would

seem at  rst that Arcadian avengers should be more at home

within the rigid lockstep of Mechanus than as a part of the

This creature is a lawful good outsider called an

Arcadian avenger. Such creatures are the primary

soldiers in the legions that defend Arcadia.

21  Arcadian avengers are dangerous in melee

combat. Their attacks become more powerful if

one of their allies is slain. They can be summoned

to serve lawful creatures.

Their af nity with law allows Arcadian avengers to

strike more reliably.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

peaceful harmony of Arcadia. Certainly, their extreme views

on law occasionally bring them in con ict with other forces

of good. These incidents are rare, however, since the avengers

hold to the ideals of Arcadia, where laws are created for the

greater good. It is in mortal realms where Arcadian avengers

often  nd these forces at odds.

Environment:  Arcadian  avengers  are  extraplanar  crea-

tures  from  the  Peaceable  Kingdoms  of  Arcadia.  They  live

there in great barracks, as be ts their role in the legions that

defend the plane. However, like all areas of

Arcadia, the military housing of the Arca-

dian avengers is beautiful by

almost any standard, with

practice  yards  and  train-

ing areas set amid carefully

sculpted gardens and orderly

rows of  owering trees.

Typical Physical Character-

istics: Arcadian avengers all stand

5  feet  8  inches  tall  and  weigh  125

pounds,  resembling  attractive,  ath-

letic female humans with full wings.

Their  esh, wings, and armor seem

made of the same silvery metal. Ar-

cadian avengers are similar to one

another in appearance.

Alignment: Arcadian avengers

are benevolent and helpful, but they

see adherence to the rules as more

important than kindness. They are

usually lawful good, but some fall

into  lawful  neutral  behavior,  for-

going compassion in the execution of

their duties.

SOCIETY

Arcadian  avengers  live  a  simple,

ascetic lifestyle among the ordered

bounty  of  Arcadia.  Their  lives  are

as  structured  as  the  laws  they  defend.

Arcadian avengers are divided into legions,

and each legion is given a specific task that defines its

purpose within the grand armies of law. The avengers are

perfect embodiments of the harmony of Arcadiafree

of ambition and inner conflict, they live in peace within

their homes despite their occasional bloody tasks. Arca-

dians avengers are much more strongly aligned with law

than with good, and as such, they are housed on Buxenus,

the second layer of Arcadia.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Arcadian  avengers  have  little  use  for  treasure.  Like  other

Arcadians, they  nd that the bounty of their native plane

provides them with all they need. Each Arcadian avenger

possesses  two  masterwork  longswords.  These  functional

weapons are the tools of the avengers job and are seldom

seen as anything more than utilitarian goods.

ARCADIAN AVENGERS WITH

CLASS LEVELS

Arcadian  avengers  advance  in  the  crusader  class  (Tome

of Battle 8), relying on faith and martial power to work

their will. If you dont use Tome of Battle in your cam-

Both classes are considered associated for an

ARCADIAN AVENGERS

IN EBERRON

Arcadian avengers are native to Daanvi, the Perfect

Order. They commonly venture to Shavarath to lend

their swords and hone their skills in battle. On

Eberron itself, Arcadian avengers hunt those who

work chaos, so they can be found in the Demon

Wastes and similar places across the world. More

than one Arcadian avenger participated in the Last War, and

some of these remain in Khorvaire in self-imposed exile or

as centers of celestial cults.

ARCADIAN AVENGERS IN FAERN

In the House of the Triad, legions of Arcadian avengers make

their home, protecting the petitioners of Torils heaven from

the  in uences  of  other  planes  and  entities.  Although  the

avengers are bound in duty to the House of the Triad, a great

number of them are loyal to Helm. All Arcadian avengers take

their duty as watchers and protectors of the law extremely

seriously, and Helms dogma suits them well.

Sylvan Warrior (Su) A banshrae applies its Charisma bonus

as a deflection bonus to its Armor Class. It doesnt lose

its Dexterity bonus to AC when flat-footed.

Blowgun Flute (Su) At will, as an immediate action, a

banshrae can call into being a masterwork flute that also

functions as a masterwork greater blowgun (10-foot

range increment). A banshrae can have only one such

flute at a time, and the instrument disappears if the fey

loses possession of it.

Each round, a banshrae can play its flute as a swift

action to create one of the effects detailed below.

Opponents within a 60-foot-radius spread who can hear

the flute can be affected (Will DC 22 negates)the effect

ends if an enemy can no longer hear the music creating

it. The save DC is Charisma-based. The tunes are sonic

mind-affecting abilities.

Dread Dirge: This mournful tune creates deep unease.

Affected creatures are shaken. This is a fear effect.

Gibbering Sing-Along: This catchy melody forces

listeners to blather meaningless sounds. Affected

creatures fail Move Silently checks, give away their

positions if invisible or hidden, cannot talk, and cannot

cast spells that have verbal components.

Travelers Tune: This sprightly ditty forces affected

creatures to move at least 20 feet on their turns.

Dart Cone (Ex) Once per day per point of Charisma bonus a

banshrae possesses, as a full-round action, the creature

can create a 15-foot cone of blowgun darts. Those caught

in the cone take 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 24

half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Locust Dart (Su) Once per day, a banshrae can fire a special

dart. An opponent struck by this dart is sickened for 1

round and takes 2d6 points of damage as locusts emerge

from its body (Fortitude DC 20 negates). The locusts

form a swarm (MM 239) that obeys the banshraes

commands for 2d6 rounds before dispersing. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Bestow Curse (Sp) Once per day, a banshrae can produce

a bestow curse effect. Victims of this curse inspire anger

in those around them, taking a 6 penalty on Bluff and

Diplomacy checks as well as a 2 penalty to Armor Class.

Banshraes are spiteful, musically inclined fey that use their

supernatural tunes to torment other creatures. Their taste for

melodic mischief belies their incredible martial skill.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

When combat is joined, a banshrae summons its blowgun

 ute and begins playing. It then uses its speed and maneu-

verability  to  command  the  battlefield,  dancing  around

opponents to gain advantageous positions from which to

use its considerable combat skills. It takes out dangerous

opponents  rst, so it can later toy with weaker foes. Using

Combat Expertise to ensure safety without seriously com-

promising its  ghting prowess, a banshrae never strikes

from the same place twice. It uses its locust dart and the

resultant swarm to help control the fight, focusing the

swarm on troublesome spellcasters.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Banshraes are individualistic, but they do live among evil fey

and serve strong leaders.

Murderous Messenger (EL 8): A banshrae carries im-

portant missives and supplies between enclaves of evil fey

on a regular route. It makes stops at villages along the way

mouths. A mighty and

terrible  verdant  prince  (MM4  172)  made  a

compact with the banshraes, interceding with dark spirits

and allowing the banshraes to have back a measure of their

musical ability. Since then, banshraes have bred true, form-

ing a new fey race devoted to grief and fear.

Banshraes eat while they rest, absorbing sustenance from

nearby plants and the earth. They breathe through holes in

the sides of their heads, under the hair.

Environment:  Banshraes  prefer  temperate  forests,  but

they can live in any environment that can sustain fey. They

enjoy  tormenting  humanoids,  so  they  often  live  close  to

humanoid settlements.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Banshraes resemble

particularly lithe elves, a little over 5 feet tall and about 100

pounds in weight. Their faces are smooth and featureless,

except for their golden insectile eyes. Their frail appearance

masks their physical power and martial skill.

Alignment:  Banshraes  are  embittered  souls,  and  they

hate most creatures except other banshraes. Even powerful

evil fey must watch their banshrae servantstreachery is

in a banshraes nature. Jealous and vindictive, banshraes

destroy that which is beautiful and wholesome. They ruin

or pollute that which they can never enjoy, such as food and

water. Banshraes are usually chaotic evil.

SOCIETY

Banshraes  dwell  in  communities  among  other  black-

hearted fey. They serve as minstrels, spies, and soldiers for

malevolent  fey  leaders

or other iniquitous and

powerful creatures. Ver-

dant  princes  and  evil

nymphs enjoy such ser-

vice,  and  they  repay  a

banshraes loyalty with

honor and treasure, re-

warding treachery with

swift death.

Even among wick-

ed  fey,  banshraes  are

notorious  for  abusing

those weaker than they,

as  their  whims  dictate.

Banshraes  respect  only

other  banshraes  and

the strong. Nonfey can

expect  torment  and

murder at their hands.

TYPICAL

TREASURE

Banshraes  adore   ne

clothing  and  jewel-

ry. Their love for music

inspires them to collect master-

work instruments made fromor extravagantly

decorated withprecious materials. They have standard trea-

sure for their Challenge Rating.

Banshrae

BANSHRAES WITH CLASS LEVELS

Banshraes are soldiers that revel in battle and turmoil. They

usually augment their considerable combat skills by advanc-

ing as  ghters, though some advance as rogues. Both classes

are considered associated for a banshrae. These fey never use

divine magicthey despise the gods and have no conscious

connection to nature.

Level Adjustment: +4.

BANSHRAES IN EBERRON

Banshraes were residents of Thelanis, the Faerie Court,

but an unnamed treachery by the banshraes of old brought

the  mouthless  curse  and  banishment  upon  the  entire

race. Exiled banshraes then spread throughout Khorvaire

and beyond, existing as deceitful vagabonds. A few still

dwell in the Twilight Demesne in the Eldeen Reaches,

but  they  are  unwelcome  there.  Some  fled  north  to  the

Demon  Wastes  to  offer  their  services  as  spies  to  the

Lords of Dust. More joined with the dark fey that rule

the Watching Wood in Droaam, and some of these have

pledged their flutes to the service of the Daughters of Sora

Kell. It is said that banshraes also inhabit the Whisper

Woods of Aundair.

Frightful Dive (Su) When a flying blackwing charges a target

below it, that foe must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or

be shaken for 1 round (or frightened if already shaken). In

addition, a blackwing can make two claw attacks against

a target that fails its save. The save DC is Charisma-

based. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Wail of Despair (Su) When two or more blackwings within

30 feet of one another scream, their cries combine to

create a wail of despair, which affects all creatures within

100 feet of any wailing blackwing. Any creature in the

area must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or cower for

1d4 rounds and be shaken for 4 rounds thereafter. For

every additional two blackwings participating in a wail

of despair, the DC increases by 2. The effect of multiple

wails does not stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This is a mind-affecting fear ability.

Skills A blackwing has a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

Blackwings are the keen-eyed undead guardians of a fallen

civilization.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Blackwings spend much of their time patrolling the hills and

mountains surrounding their lairs. When they spot prey, they

immediately plummet down to attack, using their frightful

dive to enter combat.

They use differing tactics based on the nature of their foes.

Blackwings facing  ying opponents  ght a hit-and-run battle,

using  their  superior  speed  to  divide  their  enemies  before

picking off stragglers. Against land-bound opponents, they

prefer to hover close to the ground, creating debris clouds

using  their  Hover  feat  (see  page  204).  Spellcasting  within

this cloud requires a DC 16 Concentration check.

Unless  dealt  signi cant  damage  by  other  opponents,

black wings focus their attacks on foes shaken or frightened

because of frightful dives. Once they have slain their foes,

blackwings carry the bodies back to their lair to search for

shiny trinkets. Blackwings  ght until destroyed.

Members of a  ock of blackwings  ght in concert, keeping

as many foes as possible within debris clouds. They use wail

of despair at the beginning of the battle, then gang up on

one enemy at a time. Only when all enemies appear free of

fear does a  ock of blackwings bother wailing again.

If their lair is invaded, blackwings bull rush lightly armored

or Small foes out of the cave and down the mountainside.

Heavily armored enemies are then cornered and ripped apart.

Blackwings mercilessly hunt down  eeing invaders.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Blackwings can be encountered as individuals or in  ocks

of up to six members. Individuals or  ocks patrol the ter-

ritory around the ancient sites they were created to guard,

maintaining tireless vigils. They know the terrain around

their lairs intimately.

An undead spellcaster of great powertypically a lich or

a vampiremight bend a blackwing to its will, command-

ing that blackwing to act as a mount or a spy. Intelligent

and malevolent, a blackwing might instead willingly ally

itself  with  another  undead  creature.  Since  undead  are

immune to wail of despair, they can even ride blackwings

into battle.

A  Deadly  Duo  (EL  10):  A  particularly  bloodthirsty

mohrg  (MM  189)  and  a  blackwing  dwell  in  an  isolated

cavern hidden deep within a mountain range. Together,

miners. They attack under cover of darkness. Flying toward

as the mohrg moves in, the blackwing uses its frightful

dive against an opponent near the campfire. In subsequent

rounds, it hovers over the fire, plunging the battlefield

into darkness.

Cold  Vengeance  (EL  10):  Three  blackwings  patrol  the

area  around  a  lichs  lair.  When  they  spot  interlopers,  two

dive down to attack while the third observes the battle. If

its  companions  are  destroyed,

the survivor retreats to

warn the lich. Quick-

witted and sharp-eyed

PCs  can  locate  the

lichs lair by follow-

ing  the  retreating

blackwing.  If  the

characters  do  not

pursue,  the  black-

wing and its master

appear  later  that

same  night,  intent

on revenge.

ECOLOGY

Centuries  ago,  a

powerful orc tribe

claimed  a  rugged

mountain  range,

constantly  war-

ring against the

giant eagles and

elves  living  in

the surrounding

forests.  The  orcs

caught  and  brutal-

ized eagles for sport until

their depraved mystics dis-

covered the necessary ritual

to  create  powerful  undead  servitorsthe

 rst blackwings.

Environment: Blackwings guard tombs hidden high

up on treacherous mountains. Such locales have only one

entranceusually a tunnel leading from a narrow ledge

downward  into  the  mountains  depths.  Blackwings  never

enter the tomb itself, instead lairing on the ledge and in the

entrance  tunnel.  The  dismembered  bodies  of  inquisitive

explorers often  ll a blackwings lair.

Typical Physical Characteristics: The necromantic ritual

used to create blackwings requires the intact body of a giant

eagle. The process stains the creatures feathers and plumage

a deep black and imbues the creature with unnatural vitality.

Feathers hang limply from lumps of dry, leathery skin, and

bones are exposed in places. A typical blackwing stands 10

feet tall and has a wingspan of about 20 feet. Its beak and

claws are curved and extremely sharp.

Alignment: A blackwing is corrupt to its core, tainted by

negative energy. It has no concern for law, but its actions are

not unpredictable. Blackwings are always neutral evil.

SOCIETY

A blackwing that is not destroyed during the despoilment

of its original lair has no true purpose, and it embarks on an

odyssey of destruction. If it survives this violent rampage,

the displaced blackwing settles in

a new location from which

it  terrorizes  the  sur-

rounding countryside.

Multiple  displaced

blackwings  might

congregate,  forming  a

mockery  of  a  natural

bird  flock.  Members

of a  ock stick together

even if they are forced to

abandon a lair.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Blackwings offer a couple of prospects for characters.

Creation:  Blackwings  are  created  from  the  corpses  of

giant eagles. The corpse must be buried within the area of an

unhallow spell for at least six months. Then, a spellcaster of

18th level or higher must cast create undead on the remains.

Mounts: A blackwing must willingly submit to training

as  a  mount.  Training  the  creature  requires  four  weeks  of

work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a blackwing

requires an exotic saddle. A blackwing can  ght when car-

rying a rider, but the rider must succeed on a Ride check to

attack while the blackwing does so.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a blackwing is up to 612

pounds; a medium load, 6131,226 pounds; and a heavy load,

1,2271,840 pounds.

Speed Burrow (Ex) A burrow root can move quickly through

loose soil. Three times per day, as an immediate

action, a burrow root can move 20 feet through the

ground. This movement does not provoke attacks of

opportunity.

Wounding (Ex) Any living creature damaged by a burrow

root continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round

thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative

blood loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 21 Heal

check or the application of healing magic.

Split (Ex) When a burrow root is reduced to half of its full

normal hit points or fewer, it splits in half. The new roots

game statistics are identical to those of its parent. Divide

the parent creatures remaining hit points evenly between

the two organisms. The older burrow root cannot split

again for 24 hours, and the younger burrow root cannot

split for 24 hours after it emerges.

Burrow roots are animate plants that feed on blood. They

attack to spill blood on the ground, then burrow underground

and consume their food in safety.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A burrow root attacks in three stages. Upon sensing prey,

the creature burrows rapidly toward that quarry, springing

from the earth and delivering a powerful bite. If multiple

opponents are nearby, the burrow root attacks each one with

the goal of spilling as much blood on the ground as possible.

It  uses  its  speed  burrow  ability  to  quickly  move  between

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Burrow roots often hunt in groups, moving into a terri-

tory and infesting it. In civilized areas, they are hunted

and either killed outright or driven back into the remote

wilderness.

Beholders, harpies, and other intelligent  ying creatures

use burrow roots to drive earthbound foes from behind

cover. Less intelligent  ying predators roost above burrow

root infestations, swooping down as the burrow roots attack

or scavenging remains after a battle.

Trail of Blood (EL 9): A trail of tilled soilthe path of a

burrow rootleads deep into a forest. The burrow root has

been following a briarvex (MM4 26), despite the fact that it

must go deep into hard, forested terrain, since it  nds that

blood is easier to come by when the briarvex is near. The

burrow roots burrowing and the briarvexs woodland stride

allow them full mobility even in dense vegetation.

In battle, the briarvex uses entangle to hold enemies still,

then  allows  the  burrow  root  to  attack  those  opponents,

making it more likely for those foes to bleed out from the

burrow roots wounding attacks.

roots close in on their targets, she swoops in from above,

peppering her opponents with arrows.

ECOLOGY

Burrow  roots  are  predators  that  live  just  beneath  the

topsoil. The blood of living creatures sustains them, so

unless  they  are  provided  with  a  steady  food  source  by

a  third  party,  they  root  in  areas  that  have  high  traffic.

Once they find an appropriate spot, they colonize it and

begin  reproducing.  Desiccated  corpses  mark  burrow

root territory.

Burrow roots reproduce asexually, splitting apart into

separate creatures once they have grown too large or have

taken significant damage. Since they are easy to cultivate,

a few wily and powerful creatures breed burrow roots

as guardians.

Environment: A burrow roots environment is limited

to regions where food is plentiful. They colonize warm or

temperate regions, and they prefer areas with soft, treeless

terrain, such as marshes, plains, and hills. They live near

roads, agricultural  elds, bodies of water, and other prey-

attracting features.

A burrow roots usual mode of travel leaves behind large

trails of upturned soil. From a distance, these trails look like

twisted patches of veins bulging from the earths surface. The

tilled earth is soft, making for treacherous travel (dif cult

terrain) along a burrow roots trail.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A burrow root

is between 12 and 14 feet long. The bulk of its gray-

brown body is about the width of a human head,

and its posterior tapers to a sharp spike. Dozens

of thorny branches split the anterior, creating the

appearance of an exaggerated maw about the size

of a barrel. It uses its mouth to wound its prey,

but  it  can  absorb  nutrients  by  imbedding

its spiked taproot into an opponents flesh,

draining that creatures blood.

Alignment: Because they behave

solely  based  on  survival  instincts,

burrow roots are always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Burrow  roots  have  no  concept  of

material wealth. Still, treasure lies

among the remains of the victims

that fertilize burrow root territories.

The enzyme-rich soil quickly decom-

poses soft, organic materials such as

paper, cloth, and leather, so only harder

items remain. Searching the surround-

ing soil reveals coins, gems, and other

solid objects equivalent to standard trea-

sure for a creature of the burrow roots

BURROW ROOTS IN EBERRON

In Khorvaire, the earliest references to burrow roots are

found in pre-Galifar guild documents of House Deneith.

Some have even suggested that Deneith magically bred

these creatures to provide a quick and mobile fortification

system for its troops in occupied territories. Of course,

House  Deneith  formally  denounces  such  conjecture.

Driven far from most civilized lands, burrow roots can

be found in the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, the

Mournland, and other such desolate places.

BURROW ROOTS IN FAERN

Burrow roots are sacred to the church of Urdlen. It is widely

speculated that the spriggans (Fiend Folio 162) of his highest

order  rst cultivated the plant. Urdlens most devout followers

seed burrow roots near their temples and delight in offering

the plants living sacri ces as a highlight of their Feeding

ceremonies.  Burrow  roots  have  claimed  more  than  a  few

worshipers during the Night of Blood.

Rejuvenation (Su) If slain, Dalmosh restores himself to life

on the Flesh Mountains in the Abyss two days later. He

returns to the same peaks in two days if called to the

Material Plane.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, Dalmosh must hit

an opponent of up to Large size with a bite. He can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity.

Swallow Whole (Ex) Dalmosh can swallow a grabbed

opponent of up to Large size by making a successful

grapple check.

A swallowed creature takes 8d8 points of

bludgeoning damage and 10 points of acid damage per

round from Dalmoshs gizzard. The creature can cut its

way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to

deal 75 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the

creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another

swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

A creature in Dalmoshs gizzard can see a portal to

the Gullet (see Ecology) and is aware of where the portal

leads. Exiting the gizzard to move into the Gullet requires

making a successful DC 26 Escape Artist check or dealing

half the damage required to cut out of Dalmoshs gizzard.

into bits.

Feeding Frenzy (Ex) Once per minute, as a full-round action,

Dalmosh can move up to his speed, simultaneously

attacking all creatures that come within his reach with a

single bite attack.

Spawn Maw (Ex) When dealt 20 or more points of damage

in a single attack, Dalmosh can take an immediate action

to spawn a new mouth where the attack damaged him,

granting him an additional bite attack for the duration of

the encounter. If an opponent adjacent to Dalmosh made

the attack that caused a new mouth to appear, Dalmosh

can make a bite attack against that foe as a free action.

Dalmosh  of  the  Infinite  Maws,  a  gluttonous  being  of

destruction, is an immortal denizen of the Abyss. He lum-

bers through the Flesh Mountains he calls home, chewing

through anything that obstructs his path, sculpting the peaks

into a strange arrangement of swirling arcs. Any creatures

that visit those forsaken summits are potentially Dalmoshs

preyhe grabs and eats any creature that comes within reach,

and he tracks those whose trails he  nds.

When called to the Material Plane, Dalmosh gorges him-

self, leaving behind nothing but bare dirt. Creatures, plants,

and even structures disappear into his bottomless Gullet. For

some reason, though, Dalmosh doesnt eat the unshaped rock

and earth of the Material Plane.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Dalmosh simply bites anything that comes close. If he desires

a morsel that is beyond his reach, he chases it until he catches

it or spots something tastier.

This is Dalmosh of the In nite Maws, an outsider

37  Dalmosh can swallow creatures whole, and his

If killed, Dalmosh merely rejuvenates, reappearing

and ogres view Dalmosh as the ultimate expression of their

vicious, avaricious natures. Some orcs do the same, but

they see Dalmosh as a potential weapon, not as an object

of worship.

Those  who  summon  Dalmosh  do  so  to  destroy  their

enemies. No sane creature believes that Dalmosh is capable

of more than this. In fact, Dalmoshs summoners know they

risk their lives, for he of the In nite Maws readily eats those

who remain nearby after a summoning ritual.

Grotesque  Escape  (EL  17): Dalmosh  appears  on  the

Material Plane in response to the summoning spell of a

demonologist who is trying to escape the PCs. The spellcaster

allows himself to be eaten, slipping into the Gullet. Dalmosh

then rampages through the area, requiring the characters

to quell his violence. They then have to  nd a way to follow

their enemy.

ECOLOGY

Dalmosh has no ecological niche. He simply devours every-

thing in his path, following the movement and noise that

attract him to a potential meal.

The Flesh Mountains, Dalmoshs Abyssal home, stretch across

several layers of the Abyss. His dwelling is a vast cave eaten out

of those same mountains, where he lounges

and  takes  brief  moments  to

digest. The mountains eter-

nally grow larger, and only

Dalmoshs endless eating

keeps them in check.

long  as  the  Abyss.

It is clear that Dal-

mosh can neither be

permanently killed,

nor  can  he  remain

far from his bizarre

home for long. Two

days after his death

or his departure from

the Flesh Mountains,

he  appears  there

once again.

Dalmosh  eats

endlessly,  but  he

is  never  full.  His

gizzard  contains  a

gate that is the only

known  entrance  to

a  demiplane  known  as  Dalmoshs  Gullet.

The ground within the Gullet is like the interior of a great

beasts guts. When a creature or item passes into the Gullet,

it appears 10 feet above the ground and falls. Howling gales

(severe winds, DMG 95) twist through the Gullet, picking

up debris and creatures. Those winds sometimes cross pla-

nar boundaries, depositing what they carry onto the Flesh

Mountains or elsewhere.

Creatures that Dalmosh swallows sometimes knowingly

choose to enter the Gullet rather than perish in his giz-

zard. Those unfortunate creatures that lack the means to

travel the planes become trapped. They survive by eating

the remains that fall from the sky, gathering magic items,

building materials, and other tools that survive the trip into

the Gullet. Here and there, crude settlements have arisen,

and Garnamastra is the largest of these. A rakshasa known

as the Eyeless Tyrant rules this place, backed by a small cabal

of assassins and spellcasters.

Environment: Dalmosh can survive in any earthly envi-

ronment, but he is most comfortable in temperate climes.

His home is the Flesh Mountains of the Abyss.

Physical  Characteristics:  Dalmosh  is  an  enormous

humanoid-shaped  creature  covered  in  leathery   esh  and

scars. His head is all mouth except for his blue eyes. He is

50 feet tall and weighs ten tons.

Alignment: Dalmosh is ruthless and gluttonous. He has

no  concern  other  than  feeding  his  insatiable  hunger,  and

he is driven to destroy and in ict

suffering. He is chaotic evil.

TYPICAL

TREASURE

Dalmosh has no trea-

sure,  but  ruins  dot

the  landscape  within

the  Gullet.  Suppos-

edly, the lost treasures

of ancient civilizations

that  Dalmosh  de-

voured remain hidden

within  those  ruins.

If  this  is  true,  Dal-

moshs actual wealth

is incalculable.

CALLING

DALMOSH

Calling  Dalmosh

requires a simple cer-

emony  that  involves

fine  food  and  drink

worth 10,000 gp. The

summoner must mix

the food in a massive

vat, then perform a rit-

ual chant that lasts an hour. At the end of this

time,  Dalmosh  appears,  devours  the  food,  and  then  seeks

other sustenance.

birds make excellent mounts that become undead creatures

when they die.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A deadborn vulture attacks from above by making a diving

charge. It prefers to take out  ying opponents  rst, using its

claws in a Flyby Attack. It does the same to earthbound foes,

maintaining the advantage of airborne assaults. When it fears

for its life, a deadborn vulture uses its foul breath, catching

as many enemies in the cone as possible.

After death, a deadborn vulture becomes a zombie. It

continues to attack, but in its mindless state, it might land

and attack from the ground.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Deadborn vultures are most often encountered in the service

of powerful necromancers or in uential blackguards. In

such servitude, they might congregate in large numbers.

Left on their own, they are loners that occasionally form

pair bonds.

When a live deadborn vulture becomes a zombie during

an encounter, the zombies Challenge Rating is not consid-

ered as part of the Encounter Level. However, a deadborn

vulture zombie has a CR of 6 when encountered solely in

that form.

Dark Wings (EL 810): From a crooked tower in the

giant  birds  and  spread

the pestilence of his new breed of

the area on the back of one of his deadborn vultures, gather-

ing fresh corpses for his work and terrorizing any who carry

the banner of his hated homeland. A second deadborn vulture

accompanies him on these forays.

ECOLOGY

Deadborn vultures are loathsome, murderous creatures, cor-

rupted by the process that makes them. Unlike the mundane

vultures they resemble, deadborn vultures prefer live and

intelligent prey. They especially enjoy killing and feasting

upon other giant birds, a task they are well suited to.

Deadborn vultures are sterile. One reason they seek out

other giant birds is that a giant eagle or giant owl egg brooded

over by a deadborn vulture is corrupted, and the chick is born

a deadborn vulture.

After being reanimated as zombies, deadborn vultures do

not eat, sleep, or reproduce. Unlike most other zombies, they

remain loyal to creatures they were friendly with in life.

Environment: As created creatures, deadborn vultures

can be found anywhere, but they are usually found near

the temperate habitats of other giant raptorsforests or

mountains.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A deadborn vulture

stands just over 9 feet tall, has a 20-foot wingspan, and re-

sembles a giant vulture. Its oily black feathers, disheveled

appearance, and glowing red eyes identify it as something far

more sinister. After death, a deadborn vulture zombie looks

normal,  but  its

 esh rapidly rots.

In either form, a dead-

born  vulture  weighs

about 450 pounds.

Alignment:  All  its

nobility stripped from it, a

deadborn vulture is a rapa-

cious creature that thrives

on death. Deadborn vultures

are always neutral evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Deadborn vultures dont value treasure and have none. Their

masters are often wealthier for having such mighty raptors

in their service.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Deadborn vultures cant be trained unless they are willing,

requiring one to be reared to the saddle or in uenced to a

friendly attitude with a successful Diplomacy check. Training

a deadborn vulture requires four weeks of work and a DC 25

Handle Animal check. Riding a deadborn vulture requires

an exotic saddle. A deadborn vulture can  ght when carrying

a rider, but the rider must succeed on a Ride check to attack

while the vulture does so.

A giant eagle egg or giant owl egg is worth 2,500 gp, and the

formulas and components necessary to make the egg hatch

a deadborn vulture cost 5,000 gp. Few trainers are willing

to rear or train a deadborn vulture, but those that are charge

2,000 gp to do so.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a deadborn vulture is

up to 520 pounds; a medium load, 5211,040 pounds; and a

heavy load, 1,0411,560 pounds. A light load for a deadborn

vulture zombie is up to 700 pounds; a medium load, 7011,400

pounds; and a heavy load, 1,4012,100 pounds.

DEADBORN VULTURES IN FAERN

The drow of Cormanthor, who desire the corruption of all

the elves hold dear, created deadborn vultures. House Jaelres

necromancers devised these raptors, and the formulas have

spread to other drow houses. Now, a few deadborn vultures

live in the wilds of the ancient forest.

DEMON

As  creatures  aligned  with  evil  and  chaos,  demons  are

native to the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. They revel in

fear and destruction, following their depravity wherever

it leads.

A large number of demons belong to a race (and subtype)

known as tanarri. The tanarri form the largest and most

diverse group of demons, and they are the unchallenged

masters of the Abyss (at least in their eyes). Tanarri pos-

sess a number of racial traits that are summarized in the

glossary.

Some demons belong to other races, some of which predate

the rise of the tanarri. One of these is the obyrith race (and

subtype). Like tanarri, obyriths share racial traits as de ned

in the glossary.

ADARU

A blue millipedelike creature rushes headlong on countless orange

insectile legs. Weeping dimples crusted with  lth cover its body, and

it emits a cloud of foul vapor. As the creature moves, its grotesque

parody of a childs face gnashes its dripping brown fangs.

Fetid Cloud (Su) An adaru constantly sprays a thin cloud

of vile mist in a 30-foot-radius spread. All non-evil

creatures in the area are sickened while within the

cloud. All evil-aligned creatures other than adarus

gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls,

saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks when in

the cloud.

This mist slicks the ground around the adaru, and

its wounds spray the same vile fluid. When an adaru

is reduced to half of its full normal hit points or fewer,

each square within 30 feet of it requires 2 squares of

movement for a non-evil creature to enter. This effect

doesnt stack with that of any existing difficult terrain.

Summon Tanarri (Sp) 50% chance to summon 1d4 babaus;

1/day; caster level 10th. This ability is the equivalent of a

4th-level spell.

Skills An adaru has a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Climb,

Escape Artist, and Swim checks. It can take 10 on

Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened, and it can

choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted

or endangered. An adaru can use the run action when

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Adarus are cunning demons that function best when leading

bands of other tanarri into battle. They are beings of utter

corruption, as well as capable leaders that bolster their fol-

lowers and hinder their foes.

Strategies and Tactics

An adaru always has a cadre of fawning followers that it has

charmed  or  lured  into  service.  When  battle  is  joined,  the

adaru  rst orders its minions to engage. It then moves to a

position where its fetid cloud turns the tide against its foes

and bene ts the greatest number of its allies.

Of all its abilities, the adarus greatest asset is its speed.

Adarus can scuttle across nearly any terrain, swim though

most types of  uid, and even burrow through solid rock.

An adarus freedom of movement ability gives it even more

mobility, defying the snares opponents might try against

ADARU LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can

This tanarri demon from the Abyss is an adaru.

No terrain presents a serious obstacle for

adarus. They use their mobility to slip past their

opponents defenses to land a poisoned bite.

25  Adarus are resistant to spells, but good-aligned

weapons can penetrate their dense hides.

30  An adaru can use the special organs dimpling its

body to release a spray that sickens the good and

emboldens the wicked. This substance slicks the

ground, further hindering those who arent evil.

it. It fearlessly combines Dodge, Mobility, and Tumble to

move to any position it desires on the battle eld; it prefers

 anking  positions  that  aid  its  underlings.  Spring  Attack

allows it to deliver nasty bites while avoiding immediate

retaliation, possibly crawling up a wall to a place unreach-

able by its opponents. It uses greater teleport to escape an

unfavorable battle.

Sample Encounter

Adarus  are  never  found  alone.  In  the  Abyss  and  else-

where, they have a following of demons and other wicked

creatures. Adarus are not above using any creature as a

crony, but they prefer babaus. Those cruel fiends

mirror the adarus sensibilities, and

the two complement each other

in combat.

Cult of Maltanx (EL 12):

When  a  foolish  cult  lead-

er opened a gate under a

peaceful  city,  the  adaru

Maltanx  slipped  from

the Abyss with its four

babau  minions  (MM

40).  Displeased  with

the sacri ce the cult of-

fered, Maltanx murdered

and  devoured  the  cults

leader and assumed her role.

Now the adaru sits at the cen-

ter of a web of depraved cultists

that hold positions throughout

the  city.  When  innocent

folk start to disappear

to  feed  Maltanxs

degeneracy, and a

few good-hearted

leaders in the city

are  murdered  with-

in the safety of secured

homes, evidence points to  endish in u-

ence. Who can uncover the conspiracy and

deal with the  ends at its center?

Adaru

relishing the morsels that slide into their gullets. Adarus

are also famed for taking trophies. Fascinated by other shapes

and forms of  esh, adarus take and keep body parts they do

not possess.

Environment: Adarus are native to the In nite Layers

of the Abyss. They are most common on the 444th layer,

where  their  terrifying  corruption  has  transformed  the

barren landscape into a soupy morass of sticky mud. On it

 oat dismembered body parts harvested from the countless

petitioners cursed to spend an eternity of torment in the

muds depths.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An adarus body grows

up to 8 feet long and weighs as much as 250 pounds. At its

hind end is a great sucking organ crusted with  lth,

while at the other snaps a face like that of a

human child, but with long brown fangs.

Adarus have scaly bodies, marred with

scores of orifices, each one spraying

corruption. Hundreds of bright or-

ange,  armored  legs  extend  from

its underside, each narrowing to

a  sharpened  point.  The  de-

mon  uses  these  appendages

to  run,  swim,  tumble,  and

climb with eerie grace, and

to burrow through almost

any surface.

Alignment:  Ada-

rus  are  born  chaotic

evil. They are pitiless

creatures whose exis-

tence  is  defined  by

the  suffering  they

inflict  on  others.

Adarus  carelessly

use  their  minions,

expending

them

in  great  numbers.

Such massacres amuse

adarus,  and  they  giggle

throughout a battle, even if they

are losing.

Ecology

Society

Adarus are treachery and deception given form. When a

mortal speaks an untruth that has grave consequences, it is

said that a new adaru is born, taking shape in the bowels of

the Abyss. It experiences a sudden awareness and a powerful

urge to work wickedness. A number of adarus spend their

existence  searching  for  the  mortals  that  awakened  them,

scouring the planes to reward their creators with excruciating

pain and endless torment.

As tanarri, adarus have no need for food or drink, but

they feast all the same. They savor the bloody gobbets torn

from  their  victims,  exclaiming  at  the  savory  fluids  and

Adarus are intimately aware of their standing when com-

pared to the more powerful denizens of the Abyss. They

pale before the sheer brutality of the balors and the sav-

agery of the goristros (Fiendish Codex I 40). However, many

wise and mighty demons have a use for the cunning ada-

rus, who employ all sorts of trickery to form squads of

brutal minions.

To make up their lack of raw power, adarus worm their

way  into  the  minds  of  lesser  fiends,  lying  and  making

false  promises.  Some  see  through  the  cheap  ploys,  but

the weak and desperate are easily fooled, especially when

faced with an opportunity to increase their own standing.

Thus, adarus recruit heavily from lesser demons, exploit-

ing them and discarding them with caprice. Those that

cant be cajoled are charmed and end up doing the adarus

bidding anyway.

Typical Treasure

Adarus love wealth and collect it as a sign of their impor-

tance. They equally enjoy grisly trophies, keeping all sorts

of body parts that are adorned with the belongings of the

fallen. Such mementos remind the adaru of its specific

victims as it picks over its treasures, chuckling and recall-

ing  the  fond  memories  of  the  torment  it  inflicted.  An

adaru  possesses  standard  treasure  for  a  creature  of  its

Challenge Rating. It favors jewelry and items that bring

up memories of its misdeeds, but it also keeps coins and

gems to use as bribes.

For Player Characters

An evil spellcaster can summon an adaru using a summon

monster IX spell. Treat the adaru as if it were on the 9th-level

list on the Summon Monster table (PH 287). Evil clerics

can use a greater planar ally spell to call an adaru, but the

adarus payment demand involves the sacrifice of intel-

ligent beings.

Adarus in Eberron

Adarus are native to Xoriat. Eons ago, they were rivals of

the kaortis (Fiend Folio 108), and they were powerful enough

to wage all-out war. The campaign was doomed from the

startthe adarus could not form a solid coalition against

their enemies. Individual adarus betrayed the war effort to

further their own ends. This turn of events led to a series of

devastating  defeats,  and  the  adarus  were  driven  almost  to

extinction. In the intervening centuries, they have recovered,

and they now seek places on Eberron to work their wicked-

ness. More than a few adarus wish to free imprisoned daelkyr,

hoping to earn a place in the terrestrial courts of the mighty

lords of madness.

Adarus in Faern

Adarus are native to the Barrens of Doom and Despair,

where  they  scour  the  varied  landscapes  for  larvae  and

gather armies of lesser fiends to throw at one another in

internecine war. Talona created them, and large numbers of

adarus infest the swamps around the Palace of Poison Tears.

There they spread their corruption, working to expand the

swamp and their mistresss in uence on the Barrens and

other planes.

Destructive Appetite (Ex) A carnage demon is a threat

even to its allies. After every successful melee attack, a

carnage demon must succeed on a DC 14 Will save. If it

fails, it attacks the nearest creature that is not a carnage

demon whenever it is unable to attack an enemy during a

given round.

Reaving Fists (Ex) A carnage demons slams ignore damage

reduction that can be overcome by any metallic material

such as silver, cold iron, or adamantine.

Carnage demons exist only to destroy, and they revel in the

ruin they wreak.

Strategies and Tactics

Despite having massive claws, which they use to climb,

carnage  demons  prefer  to  pummel  their  opponents.  A

lone carnage demon is still a brutal adversary, but such a

loner flees if reduced to half of its full normal hit points

or  fewer.  All  carnage  demons  prefer  to  fight  alongside

individuals  of  their  kind,  venting  their  hatred  on  all

other creatures.

In a group, carnage demons remain close to each other as

they attack. Each one lets its fury rather than any sense of

tactics dictate where its next attack is aimed, usually pound-

ing whoever damaged it the most during the previous round.

If  ghting opponents that have no silvered weapons, carnage

demons gladly provoke attacks of opportunity to get in among

their enemies, quickly overwhelming softer targets such

as spellcasters.

Carnage demons are a danger to all creatures that arent

carnage demons. A carnage demon that has succumbed to its

destructive appetite attacks nearby allies for no better reason

than being unable to move to an enemy and attack it during

the current round.

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can

learn more about carnage demons. When a character makes

a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

This is a carnage demon, a  end from the Abyss

that lives only to kill in as injurious a manner as

possible. This result reveals all outsider traits.

19  Carnage demons are resistant to most forms of

energy, and they have skin that only silver can cut

through reliably.

24  A carnage demons  sts can pound through nearly

any material. The more carnage demons present,

the more powerful their attacks become.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

destroy them before they tear through the town, killing

and destroying all they see.

Ecology

Carnage  demons  are  the  brutes  among  the

lesser  ends of the Abyss. They are the de-

structive manifestation of chaos, spurred

on by a burning desire to  batter other

creatures  in  the  bloodiest  and  most

painful ways possible. Although they

are  similar  in  power  to  dretches,

they dont share the aimlessness of

those dull  ends. Instead, carnage

demons are  lled with the singular

purpose of pure destruction.

Some consider carnage demons

to be a forced evolution of the pathet-

ic dretches, the product of a demon

lords attempt to create a more use-

ful lesser demon. This theory gains

some credence from the fact that,

unlike  most  demons,  carnage

demons are not tanarri. Their vul-

nerability  to  silvered  weapons

suggests they might have

been created using ma-

terials from or related

to devils.

Environment:  Car-

nage  demons,  like  most

demons,  are  extraplanar  creatures

that  are  native  to  the  In nite  Layers  of  the

Abyss. Mobs of carnage demons can be found anywhere on

that plane. They are always eager to spread destruction and

slaughter,  so  they  use  any  portal  or  gate  they  encounter,

having no concern for where it  might  lead.  As  such,  car-

nage demons can also be found near any place that harbors

a gateway to the Abyss.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A carnage demon has

a  powerful  humanoid  build  that  borders  on  apelike,  with

long arms hanging nearly to the ground. Those arms end in

forearms the size of tree trunks, as well as stubby hands with

thick  ngers and claws. The  ends fanged mouth takes up

most of its face, and its head seems slightly smaller than is

proportional for its body.

Carnage demons have skin that ranges from a bloody

crimson to a darker red-brown. A typical carnage demon

stands nearly 6 feet tall and weighs over 300 pounds.

Alignment: Carnage demons embody destructive malevo-

lence. Not only do they spread wanton violence, they also

enjoy in icting suffering.

Society

The carnage demons particular purpose of mad destruction

doesnt lend itself to  tting into any organized society, even

23

a demonic one. Its dim intellect allows it to be easily enticed

by the promise of devastation. In many cases, more powerful

 ends, especially the more cunning demons such as adarus

or succubi, loosely control groups of carnage demons.

In the vast hordes of  endish armies that battle on the

Lower  Planes,  demonic  generals  send  mobs  of  carnage

demons behind the  rst waves of dretches, since dretches

are  more  likely  to  rush  toward  the  enemy  if  the  threat  of

death at the  sts of carnage demons is spurring them onward.

Carnage demons are perfect shock troopstheir savagery

brings fear, death, and confusion to the opposing forces.

Typical Treasure

Carnage demons carry no possessions. Greater demons that

employ these  ends might send scavengers to scrounge for

valuables from the victims of the carnage demons, so such

overlords have additional treasure equal to what a creature of

the carnage demons Challenge Rating might carry.

For Player Characters

An  evil  spellcaster  can  summon  a  carnage  demon  using

summon monster IV or a higher-level summon monster spell.

Treat the carnage demon as if it were on the 4th-level list on

the Summon Monster table (PH 287).

Carnage Demons in Eberron

Carnage demons are native to Shavarath, the Battleground,

where they are the vanguard of demonic forces that assault

the fortresses of that plane. During the Last War, conjurers

from a group known as the Shavarath Cabal offered their

services as experts in siege warfare. Once employed, these

spellcasters could overwhelm nearly any forti cation, leav-

ing no survivors. Rumors persist that the members of the

Shavarath Cabal traf cked with  ends from the Battleground,

using mobs of carnage demons, letting them loose on targeted

strongholds.  None  yet  live  to  substantiate  those  claims.

Where the members of the cabal are now, in the aftermath

of the Last War, remains a mystery.

DRAUDNU

A hairless creature about the size of a human surges forward on three

muscular legs attached to its top. Swollen sacs of  uid bulge from its

body. A single pulsing red eye stares out from a mass of featureless

wrinkled  esh that must be the creatures head, but that mass is at

the creatures bottom. From around its eye extend three arms, each

ending in a hook of bone.

Form of Madness (Su) When a draudnu comes within 60

feet of a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 20

Will save or believe that something is growing inside it,

becoming sickened. The sickened condition is permanent

until the insanity is cured by greater restoration, heal,

miracle, or wish. A creature that successfully saves cannot

be affected again by that same draudnus form for 24

hours, and a creature that fails can be affected only once

until cured. Chaotic evil outsiders are immune to this

ability. This is a mind-affecting ability. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Immobilize (Ex) When a draudnu deals damage with a

flesh hook, it can detach the end of that hook in the

foe it struck, fastening that opponent to a surface such

as a floor or wall. (The draudnus hook end regrows

immediately.) That enemy must succeed on a DC 21

Reflex save or be immobilized (see sidebar). This ability

doesnt work if the hook cant fasten a creature to a

surface. The save DC is Strength-based.

An immobilized opponent can pull itself free by

taking a move action and making a DC 21 Strength

check or Escape Artist check. However, the act of pulling

free deals that foe 1d10 points of damage, unless it or

someone else takes a standard action and succeeds on

a DC 21 Heal check to dislodge the hook first. The check

DCs are Strength-based.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

NEW CONDITION: IMMOBILIZED

Introduced in Tome of Magic, the immobilized condition pre-

vents a creature from moving from the space in which it starts

its turn. An immobilized creature can attack and cast spells,

and it keeps its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Flying crea-

tures that become immobilized when aloft can control their

descent so they dont take falling damage, but they are incapa-

ble of moving from their current space until the condition ends,

descending  at  a  rate  of  20  feet  per  round.  If  an  immobilized

flying creature can hover, it can maintain its altitude, but it still

cant move from its space until the condition ends.

Draudnus  are  ruthless  killers

created  to  rid  the  Abyss  of

non-obyriths.  They  fight  an

eternal but hopeless war in

the  elds of ruin and misery

that make up the vile home

of demons.

Strategies

and Tactics

A  draudnu  charges  to

within reach of its foes,

then  begins  madly  hack-

ing away with its hooks. When

facing  multiple  enemies,  the

draudnu tries to immobilize two.

It then focuses its ire on im-

mobilized targets, felling

them as quickly as pos-

sible before moving on

to new foes.

A  draudnu  uses  its  speed

and Mobility to command the  ght. It rarely

eschews attacking, instead making a single

attack and using Combat Expertise to increase its AC if it

needs to close the gap between itself and a chosen target.

Draudnu

Sample Encounter

Draudnus,  like  other  obyriths,  are  scarce,  having  been

hunted nearly to extinction by the tanarri. Antisocial by

nature, they are rarely encountered in groups that contain

more than four members.

A  Hard  Place  (EL  12):  A  pack  of  three  draudnus

emerged onto the Material Plane through an ancient gate,

pursuing a gang of five babaus (MM 40). An evil conjurer

activated  the  gate  and  dispatched  the  babaus  to  kill  a

priest of a mountaintop church of Pelor and retrieve an

item housed there. Unaware that the draudnus slew their

employer, the babaus snuck into the church, leaving their

tracks about the grounds. The draudnus soon followed and

assaulted the church directly, one of their number falling

in a pitched battle that took the lives of a large number of

clerics and monks. Reveling in the chaos, the babaus have

hidden within the churchs catacombs while the draudnus

lay siege to the churchs sanctuary. Only once the draudnus

are killed or driven away do the babaus make their play

for their target.

Since the terrifying days when Obox-Ob, Demon Prince of

Vermin, ruled in the Abyss, before the tanarri rose up and cast

their creators down, draudnus have always been born in the

bone  elds surrounding the nameless castle of Pale Night,

the Mother of Demons. Formed from

the remains of eladrins who fool-

ishly waged a campaign against

demons all the way into the 600th

layer of the Abyss, draudnus are

created  by  Pale  Night.  She  steps

out onto a fragile balcony of her

fearsome citadel and gazes over

the skeletons that litter her do-

main. With a dreadful whisper,

she  breathes  life  into  eladrin

bones,  recasting  them  in  a

form conceived in the very

heart of lunacy.

Environment:  Draud-

nus, also called Children of Pale

Night, are native to the Infinite

Layers of the Abyss. They are com-

mon on the 600th layer, enslaved

to the Mother of Demons.

Typical  Physical  Char-

acteristics: Draudnus stand

7 feet tall and weigh about

300  pounds.  They  have

thick  and  rubbery  skin,

three powerful legs, and three

arms, each ending in a hook of bone wrapped

in hardened, scaly  esh. Their bodies, which seem to be

biologically reversed, are covered in dark blisters that pop

DRAUDNU LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can

cessful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the

20  A draudnu, as this creature is called, is a demon

from the Abyss. The draudnu is a  erce  ghter that

can extend its hooks up to 15 feet. It can detach

hooks to hold its prey in place.

30

25  Draudnus have acid- lled sacs all over their skin,

and these sacs burst when the demon is struck.

Lawful-aligned weapons are effective against them.

The draudnu belongs to a rare race of demon

known as obyriths. All draudnus are resistant to

spells. This result reveals all obyrith traits.

Those who look upon a draudnu come to believe

that they have something growing inside them, a

sickening thought that cant be shaken.

when  struck.  On  its  face,  a  draudnu  has  a  bloody  red  eye

where its mouth should be.

Alignment:  Draudnus  are  born  without  an  ounce  of

kindness, wild with a thirst for vengeance and bloodshed.

They are always chaotic evil.

Society

Draudnus were created to hunt and to kill. These  ends go

forth bent on murder,  lled with a hatred of all creatures

except  obyriths.  They  mercilessly  slay  anything  they  can,

especially the minions of Baphomet on the 600th layer of

the Abyss, reveling in destruction and bloody torment. Born

from the corruption of the remains of celestials, they retain

little of the memories and none of the harmonious virtues

of their former selves. They fear only their ancient mother,

Pale Night.

Typical Treasure

Draudnus have no use for wealth, treasure, or anything of

the kind. They have none.

Draudnus in Eberron

Xoriat, the Realm of Madness, is home to the obyriths of

Eberron. Although a great and varied number of creatures

call this plane home, none so accurately reflect its charac-

ter like this race of demons. Divorced from the constant

scheming of the daelkyr, free from the machinations of

the kaorti, obyriths stalk the dim places, destroying any

who  cross  their  paths.  Even  the  potent  daelkyr  accord

these  odd  fiends  respect  and  have  been  known  to  use

them as go-betweens when treating with their inexpli-

cable masters.

Draudnus in Faern

Demonologists in Faern speculate that obyriths predated

the existence of the tanarri in the Abyss, but during a

terrifying rebellion, they were nearly driven to extinction.

For eons they have lurked on the fringes, watching their

rightful home being torn asunder by the legions of tanarri

in their endless Blood War. But it is fast becoming clear,

with the sudden resurgence of these ancient fiends, that

the obyriths are no longer content to wait and watch, for

an army gathers in the Barrens of Doom and Despair. This

army, made up of horrors that defy description, musters

under the fiery sky, and the most numerous of all in the

ranks are the draudnus.

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You hinder the subjects ability to fly (whether through natural

or magical means) for the duration of the spell. If the target

fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any) becomes 0 feet. An

under the effect of a feather fall spell. Even if a new effect would

grant the creature the ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for

the duration of the earthbind spell.

Earthbind has no effect on other forms of movement, or

even on effects that might grant airborne movement with-

out granting a fly speed (such as jumping or levitate or air

walk spells).

You intone words of binding and point at your foe. Yellow strings of

opponent for 5 rounds. A creature that

has been blinded in this way cannot be

affected again until it has recovered

from the current effect. Creatures

that lack eyes are immune.

Skills Gadacros have a +4

racial bonus on Escape

Artist and Spot checks.

A gadacro is a vicious lesser

demon that torments its foes

by blinding them.

Strategies and Tactics

Gadacros are wild and reck-

less,  using  Flyby  Attack  to

slash  and  harry  their  opponents.

Once they blind a foe, the gadacros in

a group surround that creature, intent on tearing

it apart. If the battle turns against them, they fall back

to use mirror image and summon tanarri to seemingly and

literally in ate their numbers.

Sample Encounter

Gadacros are like carrion birds, following demonic hosts

to pick off the stragglers or torment the survivors left in the

wake of war. These demons collect in clutches of two to six,

or murders of seven to twelve.

Murder of Eyes (EL 9): A moderately skilled wizard

fascinated with seeing and eyes discovered information

about the gadacro in a codex he recently acquired. Fas-

cinated, he engaged in a ritual designed to call and bind

one of the creatures so he could study it. He botched the

ceremony, and a murder of nine gadacros burst through

the brief rift to the Abyss created thereafter. The wizards

manor contains enough other creatures that the gadacros

have been entertained, but one person who went to call

on the wizard has disappeared, and a few creatures that

could have come only from the wizards home have troubled

the town.

Ecology

Despite having no need for sustenance, gadacros crave the

 esh of the living all the same. Speci cally, they relish their

victims eyes, preferably plucked from the skull of a victim

that still lives. Gadacros rarely agree on who among them

should have the right to eat the tastiest bits.

GADACRO LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can

learn more about gadacros. When a character makes a suc-

cessful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the

information from lower DCs.

Knowledge (the Planes)

DC  Result

13  A demon from the Abyss, this creature is known as

a gadacro. It is cowardly yet savage, and its talons

are deadly. This result reveals all outsider and

tanarri traits.

18  When a gadacro hits an opponent solidly, that

foe goes temporarily blind. The demon can also

make illusory duplicates of itself and bind  ying

creatures to the earth.

23  Gadacros are hard to kill and extremely mobile.

They can transport themselves away from danger

immediately, and their scaly skin turns away

normal weapons. Good-aligned or cold iron

weapons can easily harm them.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Typical Physical Characteristics: Gadacros are small,

with cherubic features and purple scaled skin. Their large

heads  bear  horns.  A  typical  gadacro  stands  4  feet  tall  and

weighs 35 pounds.

Alignment: Like other demons, gadacros are always

chaotic evil. They betray one another whenever doing so is

bene cial, and they slay any creature they can, prolonging

the ordeal as long as it is safe to do so.

Society

Each gadacro group has a single leader. Smarter, stronger,

and quicker than the rest, the leader attains its position by

assassinating its rivals. It then pits the other members of

the group against one another, using favoritism to engender

loyalty in certain members. Of course, the disaffected resent

this treatment, and eventually replace the leader with one

of theirs.

Typical Treasure

Gadacros love shiny objects, and they favor baubles they can

wear or easily carry. A gadacro has standard treasure for its

Challenge Rating.

For Player Characters

An evil spellcaster can summon a gadacro using summon

monster IV or a higher-level summon monster spell. Treat the

gadacro  as  if  it  were  on  the  4th-level  list  on  the  Summon

Monster table (PH 287).

Gadacros in Eberron

Gadacros  haunt  the  ruins  left  in  the  aftermath  of  the

eternal struggles of Shavarath. Although they torture the

injured outsiders they  nd, they actually perform a useful

service. Once a warrior dies and is consumed, its essence

is absorbed into the plane and eventually reborn to  ght

once more.

Gadacros in Faern

Gadacros gather on the ledges and crevices of the Blood Rift.

Having nothing to do with the Blood War, they instead tor-

ment the lost and unwary and pick the eye sockets of the slain.

A few gadacros act as spies for balors, but these informants

are unreliable at best.

SOLAMITH

Soulfire (Su) As a standard action that provokes attacks

of opportunity, a solamith can deal itself 5 points of

damage to tear flesh from its body and hurl that flesh up

to 100 feet with perfect accuracy. When it lands, the flesh

explodes in a 20-foot-radius burst, dealing 4d6 points

of damage, half of which is fire damage (Reflex DC 23

half). Solamiths are immune to soulfire. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

By dealing itself an extra 5 points of damage, a

solamith can widen the burst to a 40-foot radius. By

dealing itself an extra 10 points of damage, a solamith

can make the burst deal maximum damage. A solamith

can use both of these abilities on the same soulfire

attack, but takes damage for each.

Soulfire Retort (Su) Whenever a solamith takes damage from

an opponents melee attack, it can unleash a 15-foot cone

of soulfire as a swift action on its next turn. The cone

deals damage as soulfire, above (Reflex DC 21 half). The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Summon Tanarri (Sp) 40% chance to summon 1d2

solamiths; 1/day; caster level 11th. This ability is the

equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

A solamith is a manifestation of depraved gluttony and burning

hunger, drawing energy from the spirits it devours. That power

charges its  esh with spiritual  re, which it uses against its

enemies by tearing away and hurling bits of its own body.

Strategies and Tactics

Solamiths dont bother to close with enemies, instead hurling

soul re from the beginning of combat. Although dim-witted,

they have keen spatial awareness and an intuitive sense of how to

best use this ability. A solamith opens with a soul re attack that

deals maximum damage, and it increase the area of its soul re

burst whenever doing so allows it to catch more enemies in

the blast. If it can, it maneuvers to continue using its soul re

as long as possible. A solamith that has lost more than half its

hit points makes the smallest soul re attacks it can.

When  forced  into  melee,  a  solamith  might  still  use

soul re, but it can also use its formidable slam. It uses a

soul re cone whenever it can, but  rst maneuvers

to catch other foes in the blast.

Sample Encounter

Solamiths roam singly or in pairs,

but  they  are  commonly  found

among  the  troops  of  mightier

fiends.

Quinixs Gatehouse Guards

(EL 10): Quinix the glabrezu lives

in a ruined city where gnolls and

lesser  ends serve him. Above the

ruined gates of the citys central

citadel where Quinix holds court,

two solamiths keep watch. A bit

too zealous, the solamiths some-

times attack gnolls and Quinixs

other servants.

Ecology

Solamiths prowl the Abyss in search

of  lesser  demons  and  petitioners  to

eat, even though they require

no sustenance. A solamith

tears its victims to pieces,

but then becomes a dainty

eater, chewing slowly and ap-

preciating the spiritual effervescence of each morsel. Once

a meal is  nished, a new face appears just under the skin on

a solamiths gut, silently pleading for release.

Solamith

Environment: Solamiths can be found throughout the

the Abyss, devouring other creatures

instinctively and paying no heed to

the suffering they cause. When in the

Solamiths do not collect treasure. They have

no  need  for  the  baubles  coveted  by  others.  However,  a

solamiths commander or master usually has more trea-

sure because of the added success brought by having a

solamith soldier.

This is a solamith, a demon from the In nite

Layers of the Abyss. Stupid but tough, solamiths

are, unlike other tanarri, immune to  re. They are

susceptible to cold, even though they are resistant

to minor amounts of cold damage.

23  A solamith can pound its foes with slams, but it

normally attacks by tearing chunks out of its body

and throwing them. Those  eshy bits explode into

 ames that can harm even those who are normally

immune to  re.

28  A solamiths injuries knit closed at a remarkable

best against a solamith, but whenever it is injured

in melee, it can emit a cone of its corrupt  re.

Solamiths  are  rare  in  the  Abyss,  offering  little  to  the

DEMONTHORN

MANDRAKE

Thorny red stalks grow out of a cluster of crimson roots that twitch

Spore Pod (Ex) As a standard action, a demonthorn

mandrake can spit a spore pod to a range of 30 feet. The

pod then explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst. All living

creatures in the area take 1d8 points of damage as thorny

growths burst from their faces. At the start of each of the

demonthorn mandrakes turns, these thorns continue to

grow, dealing 5 points of damage.

Each affected opponent is allowed a DC 16 Fortitude

save each round. If that save is successful, the thorns

become brittle and fall off the creatures face. The thorns

can also be pulled from a creature as a full-round action

that deals 1d8 points of damage. Applying a vial of holy

water to the thorns causes them to shrivel and die. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

If a creature is already infested with spore pod thorns,

it is immune to the damage and effect of this attack.

If a Medium or larger creature is killed by damage from

a demon thorn mandrakes thorns, a fully grown demon-

thorn mandrake emerges from the corpse in 1d4 hours.

Tangle Root (Ex) A demonthorn mandrake can extend its

roots to a radius of 30 feet as a standard action. At the

start of the demonthorn mandrakes turn, opponents in

the area must make a DC 16 Reflex save or be entangled.

A mandrake cant move when its roots are extended,

but can retract the roots as a free action. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

When a mandrakes roots are extended, they scream

with humanlike voices until retracted.

Demonthorn mandrakes are vile plant creatures that dwell

on the Lower Planes. They are often brought to the Material

Plane to serve as guardians or to start a plague.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

If used as a guardian, a demonthorn mandrake hides on

a ceiling or wall, waiting for prey. Once combat begins, a

demonthorn mandrake spits spore pods until all its enemies

are infested with thorns, then it closes to engage in melee.

In melee combat, a demonthorn mandrake uses its tangle

root  ability  to  prevent  escape  and  thrashes  opponents

with slams.

In groups, demonthorn mandrakes fire spore pods to

hit as many creatures as possible with little or no overlap.

Then, groups of the plants single out enemies to attack,  rst

targeting those who are suffering from spore pod thorns.

Demonthorn mandrakes rarely retreat, having little sense

of self-preservation.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Demonthorn mandrakes can be encountered alone or in

groups ranging from two to an overwhelming horde. A

demonthorn mandrake can be coaxed to work as part of

a group with other creatures.

Glade of Corruption (EL 5): An area within a forest

is said to be place of dark evil, littered with the remains

of animals and haunted by angry tree spirits. In reality, a

powerful wizard hid something valuable in a secret cave in

the center of the woods. To guard the entrance, the wizard

called a demonthorn mandrake from the Abyss. The wizard

has not been back for many years, but the lone demonthorn

mandrake still waits in the area surrounding the cave. The

few  who  have  encountered  it  have  died  before  the  spores

could produce another demonthorn mandrake.

Creeping Doom (EL 10): Long ago, a doomsday cult

brought a group of devils to the Material Plane. The devils

and their cult were eventually destroyed, but a demon-

thorn mandrake brought by the devils was never found.

Hidden away in a sealed chamber beneath the city, the

plant laid dormant for years until a druid named Kalmir-

kas  (NE  male  human  druid  7)  sensed  and  released  it.

This is a demonthorn mandrake, a plant from the

Lower Planes. Its roots can hamper those who

approach it.

20  A demonthorn mandrake can shoot a deadly pod

 lled with spores that cause living creatures struck

by them to sprout thorns.

The only ways to stop the growth of a demonthorn

dousing them in holy water.

Taking  the  plant  as  a  sign  of  the  rebirth  of  nature,  the

twisted druid has since kidnapped three victims to sac-

rifice to it, creating a new mandrake with each sacrifice.

Now, four demonthorn mandrakes, led by the mad druid,

prowl the sewers of the city. They hunt for more prey to

increase their numbers before reaching their insidious

vines to the surface.

thorn  mandrakes  appear  more  like  odd  plants  than

creatures. When it is moving, a demon thorn mandrakes

roots extend and retract at a rapid pace, pulling the body

of the plant along.

Alignment: A demonthorn mandrake is neither chaotic

nor lawful, but its connection to the Lower Planes makes

it absolutely evil.

are rarely found with any

have a lair where the bones of their victims

lie. Scattered among these remains, any manner of treasure

might be found, so demonthorn mandrakes in their lairs have

standard treasure for their Challenge Rating.

Demonthorn mandrake

Environment: Demonthorn mandrakes are most com-

the Nine Hells, and Gehenna. In these places, demonthorn

mandrakes congregate in large groups.

On the Material Plane, demonthorn mandrakes are found

guarding a speci c place, under the direct control of a con-

jurer who called them, or wandering about, free to do as they

please. Uncontrolled mandrakes hide in secluded places such

as sewers, caverns, or forest glades, waiting for unsuspecting

victims to wander by.

DEVIL

Devils are creatures of law and evil, native to the Nine

Hells of Baator. They inflict misery on mortals and other

creatures through wicked schemes and convoluted ploys

for power.

Baatezu are the predominant race (and subtype) among

devils. Fiends that belong to the baatezu race are also part of

a rigid hierarchy in the Hells, where they strive for authority

and in uence. Accomplishments can advance a devils station,

but such deeds can also arouse the suspicion and ire of those

higher in rank. Preemptive curbing of ambition through

violence can come quicker than reward in the infernal realm.

Baatezu possess a number of racial traits, summarized in

the glossary.

GULTHIR

Like a towering skeleton draped in folds of ruddy skin, this creature

has a bald, warty head covered in lesions and tumors. An oozing

wound serves as its mouth, and twin points of crimson light are

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a gulthir must hit

an opponent of its size or smaller with a bite. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity.

Swallow of Domination (Ex) A gulthir can swallow a grabbed

opponent smaller than itself by making a successful

grapple check.

A gulthirs gizzard can hold one creature at a time. A

foe swallowed by a gulthir is immediately affected as if by

a dominate monster spell (CL 17th, no save). A gulthir can

take a full-round action to spew a swallowed opponent

into an adjacent unoccupied square.

The disgorged foe is covered in slime, and as long

as that opponent is controlled by the gulthir, its eyes are

coated with an even thicker layer of white slime. Once

disgorged, a dominated foe can attempt a DC 17 Will

save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. The

effect also ends if the gulthir is killed or if the victims

eyes are washed with holy water (a full-round action

that provokes attacks of opportunity). The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Ingest Evil (Su) If a gulthir swallows an evil outsider,

it can take a full-round action to digest that fiend.

If a swallowed foe fails a DC 17 Fortitude save, it is

immediately destroyed, adding its essence to the gulthir.

The gulthir gains temporary hit points equal to that

outsiders full normal hit points and a bonus on saving

throws equal to half the swallowed fiends Hit Dice. The

save DC is Constitution-based, and the save bonus and

temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

Summon Baatezu (Sp) 75% chance to summon 1d4 lemures;

3rd-level spell.

Devils  who  fail  their  masters  are,  if  not  slain  outright,

transformed into wretched shadows of their former selves.

Among the new forms a devil might take is the gulthir.

These unclean devils continue to serve their displeased

masters as methods of punishment for other lesser devils,

because their gullets are certain doom for baatezu that

are swallowed. Such creatures are destroyed or become

gulthirs themselves.

This creature is a gulthir, a  end from the Nine

instead slowly digest a devil, transforming it into

another gulthir.

Strategies and Tactics

A gulthir has lost so much that it has little fear, so it charges

into battle recklessly, chooses an enemy, and tries to swallow

that opponent as soon as possible. It zaps strong foes with

ray  of  enfeeblement,  hoping  to  weaken  those  opponents  for

when it comes time to grapple and swallow them. It uses

scare to scatter its enemies so it can focus on its chosen target.

If  faced  with  numerous  adversaries,  a  gulthir  summons

lemures to act as distractions and to consume to enhance

its own abilities.

Sample Encounter

Gulthirs are pariahs, and when not in the service of

a greater devil, they stalk through the Hells gather-

ing packs of lemures as pets and food.

The lemures mindlessly mill about

the gulthir, unaware of the danger

they face.

Gublestalds Gang (EL 7): A glut-

tonous gulthir named Gublestald

and his gang of four lemures (MM

57) haunt the fetid landscape of a

corrupted swamp. These  ends

serve  a  lich  that  lives  in  a

sinking tower in the swamps

interior, but they are free to

harry anyone they  nd in the

lichs domain.

Ecology

Gulthirs are outside the normal

order of fiends that populate

the  Nine  Hells.  Formed

from those devils that have

raised the ire of their infer-

nal masters, they are transformed into a lower

form  until  they  somehow  regain  the  confi-

dence of the baatezu.

Instead of instantly ingesting the essence

of a swallowed fiend, a gulthir can instead

slowly digest the swallowed opponent,

a process that transforms the creature

into another gulthir. Devils that have

displeased their masters are often

fed  to  gulthirs,  as  punishment

as well as a way to maintain the

gulthir  population.  Display-

ing  a  small  amount  of  pride,

gulthirs never willingly trans-

form  lesser  fiends  into  gulthirs

this way.

A newly created gulthir is shattered by its transforma-

tion, experiencing waves of pain as its body acclimates to

its new form. From the moment it reawakens, it knows its

function and all its abilities, and it sets out to regain its mas-

ters favor.

Environment: Gulthirs are native to the Nine Hells of

Baator. They infest all the layers but are common on Dis, the

second layer, where Dispater, the Iron Duke, dispenses his

paranoid brand of justice.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A gulthir stands 10

feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Its sallow skin hangs

loosely from its skeletal frame. The loose mouth

on a gulthirs square head lies over a hinged jaw

that the devil can unlock to accommodate crea-

tures of up to Medium size.

Alignment: Like all baatezu, gulthirs are

always lawful evil. They take every opportunity

to lord what little power they have over others,

swallowing those that dont bow down.

Society

Gulthirs lament their fate. They despise their

altered  forms,  a  punishment  they  undoubt-

edly feel was unjust. To vent their hatred and

loathing,  they  turn  on  other  devils,  revel-

ing in the horror that their abilities elicit.

Ironically,  gulthirs  are  among  the  most

loyal  servants  in  the  Hells,  acting  like

a policing force as well as a method of

punishment. Other devils keep their

distance from gulthirs, letting them

enjoy the diversion of wreaking hav-

oc on lesser fiends.

Typical Treasure

Treasure is a symbol of status

that  gulthirs  cling  to.  They

adorn themselves with jewels,

and  they  covet  items  of  pow-

er.  They  swallow  valuables  carried

by their victims to keep such items

out  of  the  hands  of  potential  rivals.

Gulthirs have standard treasure for their

Challenge Rating.

Advanced Gulthirs

Unless a gulthir somehow regains the favor

of the devil that caused its demo-

tion, it is condemned to spend

eternity  in  its  present  form.

Exceptionally old gulthirs are far

larger than their counterparts, and

they can consume larger creatures.

Gulthir

For Player Characters

An evil spellcaster can summon a gulthir using summon

monster VI or a higher-level summon monster spell. Treat the

33

gulthir as if it were on the 6th-level list on the Summon

Monster table (PH 287).

Gulthirs in Faern

Gulthirs are all too common on the wasted battlefields

of the Blood Rift, where they serve as commissars and

expendable shock troops. Pit fiends sometimes dispatch

squads of gulthirs into the wilds of the Rift to hunt weaker

yugoloths and turn them into gulthirs, thereby bolstering

the devil army without resorting to the mercenary contracts

yugoloths (MM2 202) prefer. Of course, the greater devils

deny that these gulthir press gangs work in any official

capacity. Regardless, yugoloths slay gulthirs whenever they

can get away with doing so.

REMMANON

Hovering just a few feet above the ground is a nude, hairless human-

Insidious Aura (Su) A remmanon emanates a telepathic aura

that plays on the doubts and fears of its foes. Opponents

that begin their turn within 30 feet of a remmanon must

succeed on a DC 26 Will save or suffer the effect of a

confusion spell for that round. An affected foe never treats

a remmanon as the nearest creature for the purpose

of determining the confusion effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

A remmanon and allies within 30 feet of it gain a +4

bonus on attack rolls against opponents affected by this

aura.

Summon Baatezu (Sp) 75% chance to summon 1d3

equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Remmanons are devils that sow discord and distrust in

mortals. Using cunning words, magical manipulation, and

servitors loyal to them, they can bring down the strongest of

forti cations by weakening them from the inside.

Strategies and Tactics

A remmanon is rarely unprotected and enjoys the support

of mortal or fiendish minions, depending on where it is

encountered. It hovers over the battle eld, causing doubt

and uncertainty among its foes while commanding its ser-

vants to rend and destroy confused enemies. If at any time

a remmanons minions are overwhelmed, it adds to their

numbers with summon baatezu.

Remmanons are  ends of dissonance, per-

sonifying the qualities of jealousy, greed,

and lust. They are among the devils least

likely to engage in combat with mortals

or  other  fiends,  as  their  bodies  indicate.

Instead, they prefer manipulation and influence,

their bodily might hidden in an androgynous form

that appears deceptively mortal.

Environment:  Remmanons  are  native  to

the  Nine  Hells  of  Baator.  Given  their  spell-like

abilities,  they  have  far  more  freedom  than  other

fiends, and they can be encountered on just about

any plane.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  rem-

manon has the height and weight of an average adult

human male. Its body looks supple and beauti-

ful, but seems to lack strength. Piercing

its flesh are iron hooks, rings, and bars,

from which hang small scraps of pa-

per containing the names of those

mortals who have entered into

contracts with it.

Alignment: Remmanons are

crafty, patient, and farsighted.

They worm their way into agree-

ments with mortals, exploiting the letter

of  such  contracts  when  they  come  due.

Enjoying taking advantage of and destroying mortals, rem-

manons never hesitate to harm or pervert those they can.

These  ends are always lawful evil.

Society

Even when compared to other baatezu, remmanons are arro-

gant. They believe they cannot fail, and that they personify

the greatest aspects of their wicked race. Few lesser devils

appreciate the subtleties of seduction and manipulation,

and remmanons are quick to point out that failing in their

lessers. Remmanons command respect, however, and lesser

baatezu join a remmanon for the potential pro t

and instruction they can receive as the lackeys

of such an ambitious devil.

Remmanons travel the planes looking for

foes to trick and thwart. They take their time,

working all sides against the others in a con-

 ict, planning a decisive blow at some point to

spell the ruin of all that is good and holy in

a locale. When no con icts exist, a rem-

manon creates them. Its only desires

are the downfall of goodness

and purity, along with the

subjugation  of  the  weak

under the iron  st of ter-

rible evil.

Typical Treasure

Remmanons collect valuables for personal de-

fense, as well as for the sake of appearances

and bribery. They have triple standard trea-

sure for their Challenge Rating.

The remmanon in this entry has pro-

tective magic items worth 40,500 gp,

which is about two-thirds of its 66,000

gp total. The rest of its wealth is in

the form of coinage and art objects,

or mundane jewelry.

For Player Characters

Remmanons have an uncanny ability to hear magical

cries  for  aid.  Whenever  a  nongood  spellcaster  casts  a

greater planar ally spell, a remmanon appears instead of

the expected creature 5% of the time. When it answers

such a call, a remmanon offers a contract to the caster.

Bold remmanons have been known to voluntarily

interfere with greater planar binding spells, offer-

ing services in exchange for a contract even

if not trapped by the calling.

Remmanons in Eberron

In Eberron, remmanons are native to the

Material Plane. Rare descendants of the quori

that invaded Xendrik some 40,000 years ago,

remmanons have hidden themselves throughout the shat-

tered  continent,  working  their  wickedness  on  the  drow

and giants of that land. A few have spread to other realms,

including Khorvaire, where they infect the dragonmarked

races with corruption.

of damage whenever they take damage from any other

Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

When a creature that is affected by multiple pain

auras would take extra damage from the auras, it takes

an extra 1d6 points of damage from one of the auras

affecting it. All other pain auras affecting that creature

cause it to take only 1 extra point of damage apiece. For

example, a creature affected by three pain auras takes

an extra 1d6+2 points of damage each time that creature

takes damage from any other source.

A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected

again by that same stitched devils pain aura for 24 hours.

Night hags and lawful evil outsiders are immune to this

aura.

Skills Stitched devils have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks.

A stitched devil can choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

Night hags that know the proper techniques gather the

parts of slain devils and sew them together to create stitched

devils. These  ends are tormented beyond what is normal

36

for  their  kind,  imprisoned  by  their  agony  and  the  will  of

their makers.

Strategies and Tactics

A stitched devil  rst uses phantasmal killer on the creature

that looks strongest among its enemies. It then rushes into

melee, heedless of its own safety. If amid combatants it

assumes are not evila distinction it might not be correct

abouta stitched devil uses unholy blight, unconcerned with

catching evil allies within the area. It uses greater teleport to

gain advantageous positions during a battle.

Stitched devils encountered in a group use greater teleport to

surround opponents and overlap their auras. Thereafter, they

close the noose, scrambling forward to shred their enemies

with claws and teeth.

Stitched devils rarely use their dispel magic ability unless

directed to do so or a foe has obvious magical defenses that

are thwarting the devils attacks.

Sample Encounter

Stitched devils are found in the company of night hags or

abroad doing a night hags bidding. A particular night hag

commands groups of two to four stitched devils, depending

on her status and wealth. A night hag purchases devil  esh

by trading larvae and petitioners to the baatezu.

Elocins Pets (EL 13): Elocin, a particularly ambitious

and powerful night hag (12 HD; MM 193)), recently came

into  possession  of  a  pair  of  petitioners  bound  for  the

Heroic Domains of Ysgard. Elocin traded these creatures,

despite their protests, to an amnizu (Fiendish Codex II 112)

that delighted in stealing souls that deserved better. In

exchange, the amnizu gave Elocin a substantial amount

This creature is a stitched devil, a wretched

creature created by a night hag from the Gray

Waste of Hades. It is not a baatezu, but it shares

traits and resiliencies with that hateful race.

Its multiple limbs allow it to attack quickly and

 ercely.

Stitched devils emit waves of pain that cause those

injured in its presence to suffer more intensely.

They can transport themselves great distances in

an instant.

of devil flesh. The night hag stitched the parts together to

form a pair of stitched devils to guard her and carry out

her will. She can be found in Sigil (Manual of the Planes

151), brokering for more petitioners in the shadowy alleys

of that city.

Ecology

Devils are part of the cosmic order, if outside natural ecol-

ogy, but stitched devils are apart even from the hierarchy

of the infernal realms. Sewn together from the pieces of

dismembered  ends, stitched devils live in constant misery.

Though they are, in a sense, constructed, as soon as they

are pieced together they fuse into their distinctive forms,

becoming  new  creatures  with  their  own  personalities,

motives, and pain.

Environment: The twisted pets of night

hags, stitched devils are native to the Gray

Waste  of  Hades.  However,  since  night  hags

prowl the planes, stitched devils can be found

just about anywhere.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Un-

gainly  ends assembled from whatever hunks of

 esh the night hags can acquire, stitched devils

never look the same. All are patch-

work creatures of  endish  esh.

A typical stitched devil stands

just over 10 feet tall. It weighs

about 800 pounds.

Alignment: Stitched devils

channel their pain into others,

cackling madly at the torment they in-

 ict. Despite their tendency and desire

to  hurt  other  creatures,  they  are  in-

tensely  loyal  and  obedient  to  their

night hag creators. Stitched devils are

always lawful evil.

Society

When a devil fails and is

destroyed,  its  essence

is reabsorbed into the

plane  to  be  spawned

anew in the belching vats

of Hells breeding pits. This is the way

the process is supposed to work, but the baat-

ezu are famous for bending the rules to advance their status

in the rigid hierarchy of their dreadful home. Kocrachons

(Book of Vile Darkness 175) are particularly noted for selling

parts  of  their  victims  in  exchange  for  valuable  larvae  and

lost souls, which they then use to procure more interesting

subjects. Stitched devils are therefore abominations in the

eyes of the baatezu.

From  the  moment  they  awaken,  stitched  devils  bear

the  agony  of  the  disjointed  parts  that  make  them  up,

as well as the sinew piercing their hides. These crafted

devils have every reason to despise their makers, but they

dont know that they should, so they simper and whine to

their night hag mistress for affection and mercy. Stitched

devils nurture the vain hope of somehow escaping their

lowly lot and attaining importance, freedom, orfailing

thatfinal death.

Night hags whisper false promises of relief to their pets,

goading them to commit audacious acts of villainy. The hags

dispatch their stitched devils for all sorts of purposes, using

them as guards and hunters, soldiers and gladiators.

Typical Treasure

Stitched devils search for treasure, taking valuables

from those they slay, much of which they give to

their mistress. Generate standard treasure for

their Challenge Rating, but put most of it

into the mistresss hoard.

DRAGONS OF THE

GREAT GAME

A few dragons, young and old, devote their lives to a competi-

tion called xorvintaal, the great game. They scheme against

their fellows, wagering their hoards and manipulating their

minions like chess pieces. Sometimes those that dont directly

serve a dragon  nd themselves caught up in the game.

Dragons choose to take up xorvintaal when theyre young

adults, drawn by the allure of besting their fellow dragons

and the promise of vast treasure. But the great game demands

commitment from its players. Dragons are proud and solitary

creatures, so xorvintaal is one of the few ways a dragon can

earn draconic prestige. Masters of xorvintaal are regarded as

the  nest minds among dragonkind.

To join the great game, a dragon must  rst research and

perform  the  Ritual  of  Xorvintaal.  The  ritual  requires  the

dragon  to  spend  a  month  meditating  in  a  magic  cocoon.

When the dragon emerges, it is forever marked as a dragon

of the great game, having sacri ced its innate spellcasting

ability for the ability to manipulate its minions, to interact

telepathically  with  other xorvintaal  dragons,  and  to  gain

power as it advances in the great game.

HOW XORVINTAAL WORKS

Xorvintaal takes years to learn and centuries to play. Only

dragons understand the  ner points of the rules. At its heart,

xorvintaal is a combination of chess and poker, played with

the world as the board and lesser creatures as the pieces.

Dragons  use  lackeys  to  take  over  one  anothers  territories

and hoards, but they must also place their own hoards and

lairs at risk.

Xorvintaal has a feudal element as well, with older, suc-

cessful players taking new players under their wings. A new

player that does well earns esteem and in uence for its older

draconic patrons, and the older dragon earns a share of the

younger dragons hoard and of its future conquests.

The  rules  of  xorvintaal  forbid  dragon-to-dragon  con ict

except under rare circumstances. Most players act subtly to

divert attention from themselves, avoiding the direct ire of

other players.

Because they join the great game through a transforma-

tive ritual, xorvintaal dragons are incapable of breaking the

rules, but they have potent minions and the unusual abilities

granted by the Ritual of Xorvintaal. They manipulate adven-

turers and other creatures to raid the lairs of their opponents.

These pieces in the great game draw attention to themselves

rather than to their manipulator. After a successful move,

such  pieces  might   nd  themselves  the  target  of  a  more

powerful xorvintaal dragon that had a stake in the defeated

dragons treasure and winnings.

The  exact  scoring  and  rules  of  engagement  are  not  as

important as the effects that you, as DM, want xorvintaal to

have on your ongoing campaign. In most cases, the mechanics

of the great game can be portrayed as beyond the knowledge

of the PCs.

Those characters who manage to penetrate the mystery

should receive evocative but garbled blends of maneuvers

and strategy from any game you know well enough to speak

eloquently about. Consistency and clarity should be your last

priorityportray xorvintaal as a tortured mess of contradic-

tory rules and exceptions that only a dragon with centuries

to study could understand. Some ideas for PC-relevant moves

for any xorvintaal dragon follow.

Castling: Moving a xorvintaal dragons personal hoard

should be an incredibly complex maneuver, requiring years

of preparation and multiple levels of fail-safe and coun-

terstrike plotting. Thats the impression some xorvintaal

dragons like to give. So, how do a few players move their

hoards so quickly, easily, and regularly? Are they moving

into prepared positions? Are their networks of xorvintaal

resources laid out across the world in a way that few if any

rivals can see?

Claw Test: On precise dates that only players of the great

game can fathom, exarchs and unwitting agents of different

players  are  maneuvered  into  prearranged  locations.  The

engagement seems reasonable to each of the combatants at

the time, but if anyone survives to investigate the true causes,

the origins of the con ict quickly grow murky. Apparently,

the winning player in these small contests is the player whose

agents  are  deemed  to  have  accomplished  the  most  while

possessing the fewest resources or least power.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

WHY XORVINTAAL?

Applying the xorvintaal template to a dragon is essentially trad-

ing away spellcasting for a few supernatural abilities, most of

which make the dragon a better climactic encounter. Because

the xorvintaal template improves classic dragon abilities such

as  breath  weapons  and  melee  attacks,  it  makes  dragons  act

more like dragons and less like mighty sorcerers who happen

to be dragons.

Handling a dragons breath weapon, array of melee attacks,

and special abilities is enough work for a DM. By eliminating

spellcasting, xorvintaal abilities remove a level of complexity.

The xorvintaal abilities are powerful enough to make the tem-

plate a power-neutral choice.

Some of the xorvintaal abilities have specific triggers or timing

associated  with  them.  Some  make  the  dragon  seem  more

active in combat, improving the feel of the encounter. Others

reward characters who notice that the dragon roars before it

breathes.

The  story  behind  the  xorvintaal  template  is  an  excuse  to

populate a dragons lair with all sorts of interesting monsters

and NPCsthe dragons exarchs. Encounter design is easier

if the dragon has a loyal exarch that handles spellcasting for it.

Design a dedicated spellcaster for the task, leaving the dragon

free to breathe fire and bite victims in half.

Xorvintaal has clear winners and losers

Survivors of such arranged con icts have a way of growing

into positions of power that make them even better exarchs

than agents who start with all the advantages. Would-be PC

exarchs are sure to be involved in a claw test.

Seed Hoard: One of the most aggressive moves in xor-

vintaal is establishing a new hoard in an area the dragon

player  doesnt  intend  to  personally  occupy.  Relying  on

exarchs  and  pawns  to  protect  this  so-called  seed  hoard

earns high points, especially if the seed hoard is near a

rival players personal hoard. Moving a seed hoard within

the 10-mile radius in which a xorvintaal dragon can com-

municate telepathically with its own exarchs (see page 47)

is a bold maneuver, leading to great losses if the rival cant

locate and eliminate the seed hoard within a reasonable

amount of time.

In the PCs lives, a seed hoard creates an odd situation in

which a dragons hoard seems to be defended by everything

but the dragon.

Seed  Sham:  Some  seed  hoards  are  bluffs.  Instead  of

consisting of an actual hoard, they are mixtures of bizarre

traps and threats designed to cut away at the rival dragons

resources. Such trickery might be why xorvintaal dragons

seem reluctant or unable to move directly to investigate

curious happenings near their territory.

The best and highest-scoring seed shams are played in such

a fashion that the target of the bluff should be able to  gure

out that the supposed seed hoard might be a bluff, using all

the rules of the game. But calling a bluff that turns out to be

a true seed hoard can have disastrous consequences, so lesser

players are prone to using newly acquired and expendable

assets to investigate questionable seeds. That sounds like a

job for the PCs.

willing xorvintaal dragons (100-mile range).

Berserker Power (Su) When Chorranathau is reduced to 186

hit points or fewer, he gains a +5 bonus on attack rolls

and damage rolls.

Divination Immunity (Ex) Nobody can learn about

Chorranathaus future xorvintaal moves through

divination spells and similar effects. Such effects can still

reveal other information about him.

Constitution Drain (Su) Chorranathaus bite deals 2d4 points

of Constitution drain (Fortitude DC 28 negates).

Dragon Toxin (Su) When Chorranathau hits a creature,

that creature is exposed to dragon toxin and takes 25

points of damage at the start of each of Chorranathaus

turns. Multiple wounds dont stack. Magical healing

ends this effect but doesnt protect against subsequent

exposure. The dragon toxin dissipates 1 round after

Chorranathau dies.

Frightful Presence (Ex) 300-foot radius, 29 HD or fewer, Will

DC 28 negates.

Trip (Ex) If Chorranathau hits with a claw or tail attack, he

can attempt to trip (+33 check modifier) that opponent

as a free action. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot

react to trip Chorranathau.

Crush (Ex) As a standard action, Chorranathau can land

on Large or smaller creatures within in an area equal

to his space. Those creatures take 4d8+16 points of

bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 28

Reflex save or be pinned. Pinned creatures take

4d8+16 points of bludgeoning damage each round

they remain pinned.

Tail Sweep (Ex) As a standard action, Chorranathau can

sweep his tail through a half-circle that has a 30-foot

radius. The sweep deals 2d6+16 points of bludgeoning

damage (Reflex DC 28 half).

Twist of Fate (Su) Chorranathau can spend an immediate

action to produce one of the following effects.

When targeted by a spell that affects one or more

targets (as opposed to an area spell), he can gain

a +10 bonus on the saving throw against that spell. He

subsequently loses his +5 insight bonus on saves for

1d4 rounds.

He can move 30 feet to avoid an area effect, but only

if that movement would take him out of the effects area.

If he does so, he cannot move on his next turn.

When Chorranathau could make an attack of

opportunity, he can instead flap his wings and blast

wind at the foe that provoked the attack. The wing flap

functions like a bull rush attempt (+11 bonus on the

opposed check), except that Chorranathau doesnt move

along with the foe being pushed (though the victim

can still be pushed as far as the maximum distance

Chorranathau could normally bull rush it). If the target is

airborne, it is treated as one size smaller for the purpose

of resolving the opposed check. This immediate action

doesnt use up Chorranathaus attack of opportunity.

Devastating Critical (Ex) If Chorranathau confirms a critical

threat with a claw attack, the opponent struck must

succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude saving throw or die

instantly (Draconomicon 68).

Draconic Knowledge (Ex) Chorranathau can make the

equivalent of a bardic knowledge check (PH 28, +14)

to reveal information about an item, event, or locale

(Draconomicon 69).

Overwhelming Critical (Ex) If Chorranathau confirms a

critical threat with a claw attack, he deals an extra 1d6

points of damage with that attack (Draconomicon 72).

Create Exarchs (Sp) Chorranathau can perform an hour-long

ritual to designate a creature as his exarch in the ongoing

great game. Doing so gives the xorvintaal exarch template

(see page 47) to the designated creature.

Sound Imitation (Ex) Chorranathau can mimic any sound he

has heard (Will DC 28 detects the ruse).

Chorranathau is a master of xorvintaal, and he is known

widely among the other dragons of the great game. He counts

dozens of younger dragons as his vassals.

Strategies and Tactics

Chorranathau arrays high-level spellcaster exarchs (such as the

Shrouded Vizier) to force foes closer to him. He also employs ter-

rain and sound imitation to ensure that enemies dont encounter

him until theyre practically standing next to him.

Once  an  adversary  approaches  to  what  Chorranathau

feels is a suf ciently close distance, he attacks, evoking his

frightful presence. He makes a full attack whenever possible,

spreading his attacks around at  rst so that every one has to

deal with his dragon toxin ability. He then focuses on the

opponent that dealt him the largest amount of damage.

Whenever he would otherwise make an attack of oppor-

tunity for the  rst time in a round, he instead uses his twist

of fate ability to buffet a foe. He then has another attack of

opportunity available.

other delicacies so that Chorranathau doesnt have to leave

his home.

Over centuries spent fending off xorvintaal rivals, Chor-

ranathau has installed a wide array of deadly traps throughout

the temple. At any given time, about a dozen high-level

exarchs reside in the temple, ready to defend their master

and otherwise do his bidding.

Physical Characteristics: Chorranathau is 85 feet long

from snout to tail tip. He stands 16 feet tall on all fours and

has a wingspan of 70 feet. He weighs eighty tons.

Alignment: In Chorranathaus mind, the battle between

good and evil is a philosophical tri e that pales in com-

parison to the all-encompassing passion that is xorvintaal.

All other creatures are pieces in the game. Chorranathau is

chaotic neutral.

Sample Encounters

Society

Chorranathau has several dozen exarchs, a testament to his

numerous victories in the great game. Hes best used as a

powerful but distant force. Chorranathau rarely leaves his

lair, so only after dealing with layers of exarchs and braving

the dangers of the fang dragons abode might the PCs actu-

ally meet him.

The Masters Test (EL 18): Working through intermediar-

ies and exarchs, Chorranathau has had his eye on the PCs for

some time. Impressed with their power, the fang dragon has

decided that the characters might make good exarchs, but

he wants to test their mettle  rsthand. Chorranathau meets

the PCs in an immense courtyard and explains the nature

of the testa trial by combat that any participant can exit

at any time by saying I yield. The dragon then engages the

characters in battle. Chorranathau doesnt pull punches in

the  ght, except to avoid targets so weak that he can kill them

with  a  single  blow.  Chorranathau  yields  when  reduced  to

74 hit points or fewer, and he has a high-level cleric exarch

restore slain PCs to life when the battle is over.

Called onto the Carpet (EL 20): Chorranathau and his

Shrouded Vizier (female human necromancer 18) invite

the PCs into the ancient fang dragons lair to explain recent

actions  the  characters  have  perpetrated  that  hindered

Chorranathaus progress in the great game. The PCs have

to negotiate a solution or otherwise mollify Chorranathau,

while the vizier employs a battery of divination spells to make

sure they speak truly and deal fairly. The PCs might walk

out as Chorranathaus newest exarchs, they might walk out

chastened and warned against further interference, or they

might not walk out at all.

Ecology

Chorranathau is physically typical for a fang dragon of his

size and age. He is patient and calculating compared to any

younger fang dragon, and he tempers his appetites to suit his

desires in the great game.

Environment: Chorranathau uses an ancient mountain

temple as his lair. His Knights of the Teeth (low-level mer-

cenary  ghters) scour the nearby valleys for elk, deer, and

Chorranathaus interest in the great game has grown into

an obsession. Hes always plotting the future moves of his

exarchs and the younger xorvintaal dragons under his patron-

age, trying to think ahead as many moves as possible.

But at this point in the game, the only xorvintaal dragons

that can challenge Chorranathau are likewise brilliant and

capable. So Chorranathau has started cultivating a reputation

for being ruthless and unpredictable. The reputation  ts his

natural proclivities, and Chorranathau  nds that a lot of his

xorvintaal rivals would rather contend with more predictable

opposition, leaving Chorranathau free to chip away at their

territories with less risk of reprisal.

Typical Treasure

In his lair, Chorranathau has an immense pile of treasure. Start

with quintuple standard for Chorranathau himself, or 235,000

gp, and put the bulk of the treasure from other encounters

within Chorranathaus temple into his hoard as well.

damage or paralyzing for 11 rounds). If she does so,

she cant use either breath weapon for 1d4+3 rounds

(Draconomicon 71).

Overcome Weakness Morlicantha is no longer vulnerable

to fire (Draconomicon 72). Suppress Weakness is a

prerequisite for this feat but has no additional effect.

Alternate Form (Su) Morlicantha can assume any animal or

humanoid form.

Create Exarchs (Sp) Morlicantha can perform an hour-long

ritual to designate a creature as her exarch in the ongoing

great game. Doing so gives the xorvintaal exarch template

(see page 47) to the designated creature.

Morlicantha is an ambitious but principled xorvintaal dragon

that is relatively new to the great game. Shes actively seeking

worthy members of the unwinged races to aid her efforts

and, in time, become her exarchs.

Strategies and Tactics

In battle, resolve Morlicanthas frightful presence as soon

as the fight starts. If she wants to kill her enemies, she

uses a maximized cold breath weapon right away. Doing

so puts the breath weapon on the shelf for a longer time,

but it puts her energy aura into play starting in round 3

(assuming she breathes in round 1). She behaves evasively

or tries to seize advantageous terrain in round 2, hoping

the PCs catch up to her just in time for her energy aura to

deal damage at the start of round 3. Then she lays down

the law with her natural attacks, using Power Attack only

conservatively.

If  Morlicantha  doesnt  want  to  kill  her  attackers,  then

she employs her paralysis breath weapon instead. Some of

her  foes  have  recovered  from  paralysis  to   nd  themselves

pinned underneath Morlicanthas considerable bulk. Then

the questioning begins.

Sample Encounters

Morlicantha travels a great deal, trying to learn as much as

she can about her rivals in the great game. She goes incognito

as a beautiful half-elf female or a wizened human crone.

Encounters with Morlicantha walk a fine line between

outright combat and a test for suitability as an ally.

Here Comes the Cavalry (EL 11): Morlicantha appears

in half-elf form and offers the PCs a bargain. Shes willing

to get them out of their current dilemma if they accept a

short detour to slay a ten-headed pyrohydra in its nearby

lair. The creature is a pawn in another xorvintaal dragons

plans, and Morlicantha doesnt want to move against the

dragon directly.

You Dont Look So Tough (EL 13): In her crone form,

Morlicantha observes the PCs in a public setting. Then she

approaches a thin-skinned or impulsive PC and attempts

to goad him or her into an arm-wrestling match, footrace,

or other athletic feat. If the character demurs, Morlicantha

taunts and belittles that PC loud enough for everyone to hear.

If a  ght breaks out, Morlicantha participates until reduced

to 50 hit points or fewer. Then she  ies away, shouting, Well

meet again! If the characters win the competition or defeat

her in combat, Morlicantha might return to offer them a role

in her next xorvintaal move.

Ecology

An  inveterate  traveler,  Morlicantha  is  often  on  the  road

spying on her rivals or making moves against their territory.

Because Morlicantha spends so much time in her favorite

alternate forms, she has developed a taste for food favored

by humanoids.

Environment: Unusual for a silver dragon, Morlican-

thas lair is on a small coral atoll off a forbidding coast.

Morlicantha is often away playing the great game, but a

band of tritons guards her island. A network of tunnels

extends from the atoll to below the seafloor. Morlicantha

isnt the first dragon to call this atoll home, and because

of her obsession with xorvintaal, she hasnt fully explored

all the tunnels yet.

Physical Characteristics: In her true form, Morlicantha

is 35 feet long and has a wingspan of 50 feet. She weighs 2,500

pounds. Her alternate forms adhere to racial averages.

Alignment: Morlicantha has a deep and abiding respect

for the rules of xorvintaal, but her sense of fair play doesnt

dull her competitive edge one bit. When it comes to xor-

vintaal, she acts as aggressively as the rules allow. She is

lawful good.

Society

Morlicantha is obsessed with xorvintaal, but she has opted

for a risky play style. She refuses to ally herself with more

powerful dragons, choosing to go it alone. This choice affords

her great freedom, but any other dragon can move on her

territory and lair without having to worry about a powerful

patron. Of course, other dragons dont necessarily know

Morlicantha is a loner.

Morlicantha  is  exceedingly  wary  of  other  dragons,  and

thats one reason why shes so keen to get allies from what

she calls the unwinged races. Among humans and their ilk,

she can be helpful and even gregarious. But in the presence

of dragons or their exarchs, she watches her words carefully

and tries to remain as unobtrusive as possible.

Typical Treasure

In her lair, Morlicantha has triple standard treasure for a

CR 13 monster, or 39,000 gp. In addition, when she travels

as a maiden or a crone, Morlicantha is equipped as a 10th-

level NPC.

CREATING A XORVINTAAL DRAGON

Xorvintaal dragon is an acquired template that can be added

to any young adult or older true dragon (referred to hereafter

as the base dragon).

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature or higher,

depending  on  how  many  xorvintaal  abilities  it  has  (see

below).

Languages: A xorvintaal dragon can communicate tele-

pathically with any of its exarchs (10-mile range) and with

willing xorvintaal dragons (100-mile range).

Immune: Nobody can learn about a xorvintaal dragons

future  game  moves  through  divination  spells  and  similar

effects. Such effects can still reveal other information about

a xorvintaal dragon.

Spell Resistance: Xorvintaal dragons do not have spell

resistance.

Saving  Throws:  A  xorvintaal  dragon  gains  a +1  insight

bonus on saving throws for every two age categories it has.

A young adult, for example, gains a +2 insight bonus.

Spells: Xorvintaal dragons lose the ability to cast spells.

Spell-Like Abilities: A xorvintaal dragon retains all spell-

like abilities, and it gains the following.

Charm Monster (Sp): At will, a xorvintaal dragon can use

charm monster on its exarchs (caster level 8th + the dragons

age category).

Scrying (Sp): Three times per day, a xorvintaal dragon can

use scrying with one of its exarchs as the target (caster level

8th + the dragons age category).

Special Qualities: A xorvintaal dragon has all the special

qualities of the base dragon, plus the following special

qualities.

Create  Exarchs  (Sp):  A  xorvintaal  dragon  can  perform  an

hour-long ritual to designate a creature as an exarch in the

ongoing  great  game.  Doing  so  gives  the  xorvintaal  exarch

template (page 47) to the designated creature or gives  ve

favor tokens to a creature that is already an exarch.

Xorvintaal Abilities (Su): A xorvintaal dragon chooses

one of these abilities after it completes the Ritual of Xor-

vintaal, and it earns more by achieving victories in the

great game.

The average xorvintaal dragon has one of these abilities,

plus another one for every two age categories it attains beyond

young adult. But if youre creating a particularly successful

xorvintaal dragon, you can add more xorvintaal abilities,

adding 1 to the Challenge Rating of the dragon for each extra

xorvintaal ability.

Alternate Form: Three times per day, a xorvintaal dragon

can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size

or smaller.

Berserker Power: Once reduced to half of its full normal

hit points or fewer, a xorvintaal dragon receives a +1 bonus

on melee attack rolls and damage rolls for every two age

categories it has. The bonus lasts until the dragon heals

to half its full normal hit points or higher.

Deep Breath: If a xorvintaal dragon spends a move

action to visibly inhale, it can deliver its breath weap-

on the following round with extra potency, dealing

an  extra  4  dice  of  damage  (of  whatever  dice  the

breath  weapon  ordinarily  deals)  and  increasing

the DC of the Re ex save by 4. The deep breath

ability doesnt change the recharge time for the

breath weapon.

Draconic Roar: As a swift action, a xorvintaal

dragon can emit an astounding roar. Doing

so  deals  half  the  dragons  breath  weapon

damage in sonic damage and deafens all

creatures within 30 feet of the dragon. A

successful  Fortitude  saving

throw (same DC as the breath

weapon) halves the damage and

negates  the  deafening.  Deafened

characters naturally regain their hear-

ing after 1 hour.

Once a xorvintaal dragon uses its dracon-

ic roar, it cant use it again until after it uses its

breath weapon. When rolling to see how long it

takes the breath weapon to recharge, use the same

result    1  to  determine  when  the  roar  is  avail-

able again.

Dragon Eyes: A xorvintaal dragon can keep

tabs on its lair and territory with an array of

 oating magic eyes that patrol and report back

to  the  dragon.  This  effect  functions  like  the

prying eyes spell, except that a xorvintaal dragon

receives two  oating eyes per age category it has.

The  dragon  eyes  last  inde nitely;  when  one  is

destroyed, another one forms next to the dragon

at the start of its next turn. Whenever an eye re-

turns to the dragon, the dragon can give the eye

new instructions.

Dragon Toxin: When it is in combat, a

xorvintaal dragons fangs and claws drip

a corrosive fluid called dragon toxin.

Any creature dealt damage by the xor-

vintaal dragons bite or claw attacks is

affected by dragon toxin. At the start

of each of the dragons turns, each crea-

ture  affected  by  dragon  toxin  takes  an

extra 5 points of damage for every two

age categories the dragon has. Multiple

either affected by dragon toxin or not. Any form of magi-

cal healing eliminates dragon toxin currently affecting

a creature but doesnt protect against subsequent expo-

sure. Its dragon toxin harmlessly dissipates 1 round after

a xorvintaal dragon dies.

Energy Aura: The potent energy within a xorvintaal dragon

pours  out  of  its  body,  damaging  everyone  nearby.  At  the

start of each of the dragons turns, this energy deals 5 points

of damage (of the same type as its breath weapon) per age

category  to  all  creatures  adjacent  to  the  dragon.  The  aura

is obvious to all who can see the dragon. A red dragon, for

example, is wreathed in  ame; a blue dragon has a corona of

electricity; and green and black dragons vent corrosive gas.

If the dragon uses its breath weapon, it loses its energy until

the end of its next turn. Dragons that have no breath weapon

cannot acquire this power.

Intimidating Presence: This ability replaces the base dragons

frightful presence. When another NPC comes within a

distance of 30 feet  the dragons age category away from

a xorvintaal dragon, that dragon can make an Intimidate

check opposed by the NPCs level check (1d20 + Hit Dice +

Wis modi er + modi ers on saves against fear). If the dragon

beats the NPCs level check result, then that NPCs attitude

improves  to  friendly  as  long  as  its  within  range  and  for

1d610 minutes after its out of range. After this time, the

NPCs attitude shifts to unfriendly (or, if already unfriendly,

to hostile).

Recall Exarch: A xorvintaal dragon can recall an exarch.

This ability functions like the word of recall spell, except

that the dragon, not the exarch, instigates it. The exarch

receives forewarningenough time to grab any adjacent

objects or touch any willing adjacent creatures. Using this

ability normally takes a standard action, but the dragon

can take 10 points of damage per age category to use it as

a swift action.

When building an encounter with a xorvintaal dragon

that has this ability, award experience points separately

for each exarch called, and calculate the overall encounter

level by including the called creatures as well. After all,

theyre a significant part of the challenge, and once theyre

called, theyre with the xorvintaal dragon for the rest of

the encounter.

Rejuvenation:  When  a  xorvintaal  dragon  reaches  10  hit

points, it doesnt actually die. All life functions cease, how-

ever, and the dragon is functionally a corpse for the purpose

of resolving all spells that affect dead bodies. It takes a Heal

check (DC 20 + dragons age category) to detect any vital

signs. It remains at 10 hit points no matter what damage

or healing it receives. Death effects still affect the dragon

normally, and dismembering or skinning the corpse is suf-

 cient to kill it.

When 10 minutes have passed since the dragon last took

damage, it gains fast healing 10. It still appears dead until it

reaches its full normal hit points.

Twist of Fate: Taking this ability gives a xorvintaal dragon

an array of bene ts, each activated as an immediate action

in response to a speci c trigger.

When subject to a targeted spell, a xorvintaal dragon can

take an immediate action to try to disrupt the incoming

spell. The effort grants the dragon a bonus on the saving

throw equal to its age category. Once the dragon uses the

saving throw bonus, its insight bonus on saves disappears

for 1d4 rounds.

When subject to an area spell or effect, a xorvintaal dragon

can take an immediate action to move up to 30 feet, but only

if doing so would take it out of the effects area. The dragon

must take the most direct available route to the nearest safe

squares, and it provokes attacks of opportunity as normal

for its movement. If the dragon makes this move, it cant

move during its next turn.

When the dragon could make an attack of opportunity,

it can instead  ap its wings and blast wind at the foe that

provoked the attack. The wing  ap functions like a bull

rush attempt, except that the dragon doesnt move along

with the foe being pushed (though the victim can still be

pushed as far as the maximum distance the dragon could

normally bull rush it). If the other creature is airborne, then

it counts as one size smaller for the purpose of resolving

the opposed check.

If a xorvintaal dragon takes this immediate action, it

cant use its wing attacks during its next turn. However,

this immediate action doesnt use up one of the dragons

attacks of opportunity.

Singh used to be a thief and a mercenary, and

A  former  thief,  adventurer,  and  hired  killer,  Singh  the

Strategies and Tactics

Singh  attacks  from  the  shadows  whenever  possible,

accompanied by his shadow minion. His shadow flanks

foes, allowing Singh to use sneak attack often. Tumble

the PCs, he employs shadow jump and, if necessary, lairs

return to escape.

Sweep the Pawns from the Board (EL 16): Singh and

two troll hunters (MM 247) are on a straightforward mission:

assassinate the PCs. They maximize the element of surprise,

but they  ee when reduced below 25% of their full normal

hit points.

Ecology

Singh is human. He loves food, eating as much in a day as

several average people, and he relishes the chance to experi-

ence a new delicacy or gourmet dish.

Environment: Singh splits his time between his mas-

ters lair and a series of countryside manors and city town

houses. Hes particularly fond of a villa that has an adjacent

vineyard, and he has started teaching the shadowdancers

art to some promising students there.

Physical  Characteristics:  Singh  has  earned  his

nicknamehes nearly 7 feet tall and weighs 550 pounds.

But  beneath  the  rolls  of  fat  are  rock-hard  muscle,  and

relentless training has enabled Singh to retain his grace

and agility.

Alignment:  Singhs  neutrality  represents  amoral  indif-

ference  to  ethical  matters,  not  any  sort  of  reverence  for  a

cosmic balance. Singh acts to keep himself safe, powerful,

and sated.

Society

Singh is cautious and a little paranoid when on a mission

for his master. He speaks only when he musthed rather

interact with a fine bottle of wine or a rare delicacy than

another personand even then he usually whispers. A

mercenary  at  heart,  Singh  is  satisfied  with  his  current

role. Chorranathau the Inscrutable cares for his exarchs

well, and Singh is accustomed to living an extravagant

lifestyle.

Typical Treasure

Singh carries nearly all of his magic items on his person,

but he has even more wealth in his various town houses

and villas, which are guarded by his personal soldiers. In

any given home are enough valuables to equal standard

coins and double goods for a creature of Singhs

tokens. It can spend any number of tokens as an immediate

action to gain one of the following bene ts.

Energy Immunity: A xorvintaal exarch can spend a favor

token to gain immunity to the same type of energy type

PCS AS EXARCHS

Rewards inherent in the great game might attract the PCs. A

xorvintaal dragon can give them the xorvintaal exarch template.

That dragon can renew the ritual on an exarch to restore five

favor tokens, but the dragons ability to do so is limited by that

dragons success in the great game.

Rather than trying to score the great game, use the characters

performance as a determining factor, rewarding their success

with more favor tokens. PCs who fail might be denied tokens

not  because  their  master  wishes  them  ill,  but  because  that

dragon has insufficient stature in the great game to repeat the

exarch ritual.

The dragon can be subtly used to tell the characters how to

use their tokens. Just defeat Roallaxathan, and my position in

the great game will be secure enough to restore my favor, a

dragon might say. Or the dragon might say, Our position is

tenuous; probe Roallaxathans defenses, but do not overextend

yourself or me. Either message tells the characters how likely

they are to gain more favor tokens, indicating how freely the

PCs should spend the ones they have.

ELEMENTAL MAGE

Elemental magi are giants descended from ogres, similar in

appearance to ogre mages. Despite their rarity, elemental

magi are not unique individuals, but rather different mem-

bers of the same race with varying appearances and abilities.

From the highlands, they emerge without warning, either

singly or as a group, to conquer and scourge the lands of

weaker people.

KEN-KUNI

The ground splits in front of you, and rocks tumble down into

your path. Sliding down in a shower of dust and pebbles comes a

horned giant clad in banded armor, carrying an enormous sword

in its hand. Trespassers! it intones in a voice that shakes the earth

beneath your feet.

Ken-kunis are three-horned, ogrelike giants of great strength

and martial prowess. Not as clever or as ambitious as the

other  elemental  magi,  they  prefer  to  stake  a  claim  and

defend it.

Most often encountered alone on hillside paths or in

rocky terrain where they have settled, ken-kunis demand

tribute from anyone passing through their territory. Other

elemental magi press ken-kunis into military service. At war,

ken-kunis shatter settlement defenses and break up enemy

troop formations.

KEN-LI

A wave of heat presages the arrival of this towering, horned giant.

Smoke  ows from the creatures mouth and spirals around its body

Ken-kuni, ken-li, ken-sun

Ken-lis are two-horned, ogrelike giants of keen insight and

malicious temperament. This behavior is tempered by an

arrogance that prevents them from using their perceptive-

ness to the fullest.

Without leadership of some kind, a ken-li lives to destroy,

indulging that desire at every opportunity. Left to its whims,

it burns villages, roasts herds of cattle, and torches forests

simply for enjoyment. When encountered alone, ken-lis are

almost always engaged in one of these rampages. Otherwise,

they are found as troops in ken-sun armies, where they are

kept under control.

KEN-SUN

A craggy, horned giant turns its baleful gaze upon you, blue lips

curling into a wicked smile and exposing sharp, serrated teeth. Its

pale robe swirls around it as it gestures to summon its allies.

Ken-suns are one-horned, ogrelike giants possessed of wicked

intelligence and magical prowess. They descend from the

highlands at the head of armies or raiding parties, bringing

ruin to the settlements below.

Living  to  lead  and  to  rule,  ken-suns  desire  complete

dominion over everything that comes before them. They use

their strength, size, and magic to gather armies, both to give

them a sense of authority and to fuel their megalomaniacal

plans. Sometimes these warbands can swell in size to become

true armies, and ken-suns can even become absolute lords

of their domains.

Ken-lis and ken-kunis often serve as trusted retainers and

siege breakers within a ken-suns army.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Elemental  magi  are  very  different  enemies  depending

whether they are encountered singly or together. Individu-

ally,  they  are  quite  formidable,  but  as  a  group  they  are

far stronger.

Ken-kunis, when met alone, are usually defending their

homesa  place  from  which  they  can  control  their  sur-

roundings and collect tribute from those who pass through.

This home is typically a cave, a foothill or mountain path, or

a ruin. A ken-kuni  rst prevents retreat, then panics its foes

with an earthshock. It makes its demands from a position

of strength.

Single  ken-lis  wander  as  ravagers  on  the  outskirts  of

civilization. They raid and destroy villages, isolated temples,

and roving caravans, then move on to  nd new playthings.

Aggressive and straightforward, their only tactic is to strike

hard and fast, making liberal use of their  ame breath to lay

waste to any opposition.

Ken-suns  are  rarely  found  without  followers.  They

prefer  to  send  their  warbands  after  powerful  enemies,

then join the battle themselves after those foes are worn

out. Frequently, ken-suns set up ambushes and use terrain

to their advantage, especially when they think they have

the upper hand. They use their breath weapon to control

the battlefield, pushing back or trapping enemies to buy

time,  or  to  make  a  particular  opponent  easier  prey  for

their minions.

When encountered together, elemental magi strike as a

team. Ken-lis and ken-kunis join the ken-suns followers,

smashing  down  defenses  with  their  great  strength  and

from the rear.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Individually or together, elemental magi make challenging

opponents.

Ken-Kuni Toll Booth (EL 9): A ken-kuni lives in a cave

overlooking a long, narrow road that winds through rocky

hills. It has set up two traps 200 feet apart across a section

of the road (these act as CR 5 falling block traps, DMG 72).

The first one is delayed until travelers move past the place

where it goes off. If triggered, the trap sends rocks down

the slope, blocking the road behind the intruders. The

second trap activates almost immediately upon whoever

sets  it  off,  cutting  off  the  way  forward.  If  the  party  is

trapped, the ken-kuni demands a toll, attacking if it is not

paid. The toll is 250 gp per person, but if travelers take

too long to decide whether to pay, the ken-kuni steadily

increases the price.

Ken-Li Squatter (EL 11): A ken-li has burned out a  re

wizards tower and taken up occupancy, along with a gang of

 ve Medium  re elementals (MM 99) that were released when

the ken-lis breath interacted with the wizards alchemical

ingredients. The evoker wants revenge upon the interloper,

who is still there, experimenting with the reactive reagents

and playing with its elemental children.

Tribal Paragon (EL 14): A ken-sun has been born to a

wandering ogre band and is being apprenticed, warily, by

the groups ogre mage leader. The little tribe consists of a

4th-level ogre barbarian (MM 199), eight ogres (MM 199),

the ogre mage (MM 200), and the ken-sun. If the band runs

into any enemies, the ken-sun is eager to prove itself.

Elemental Mage Siege (EL 14): A ken-sun has descended

from the mountains with its warband, including a ken-li

and a ken-kuni, to lay siege to a city. The raiders quickly

This is one of the elemental magi, an interrelated

group of giants who often form warbands.

Elemental magi are descended from ogres, and

they are like ogre mages.

Elemental magi come in three varieties. Ken-kunis

are creatures of stone with the power to cause

tremors. Ken-lis are  re-breathing monstrosities

capable of great destruction. Ken-suns are natural

leaders that have power over the air.

Elemental magi are strong and resilient, and they

heal extremely quickly.

overran the inhabitants and firmly established a tyran-

nical regime.

To lead up to the climax, the PCs need to in ltrate the

city or defeat the guardsseveral encounters of EL 10 or

lower. A typical encounter contains seven ogres led by an

ogre barbarian.

The climactic encounter is against all three elemental magi

and takes place in the town square. Surrounded by low-lying

buildings, the square is a perfect spot for concealed  ghters

to  hide.  If  given  warning  of  the  characters  approach,  the

ken-sun and the other elemental magi hide inside various

structures, waiting in ambush.

ECOLOGY

Elemental magi are born among ogres, and they are very

rare. Speculated to be types of ogre mages, elemental magi

are fascinated by their own peculiar abilities and tendencies

from a very young age. The three kinds of magi seem made

to  t together as an effective force. Some sages believe that

the elemental magi were created by old gods to avenge the

worship they lost to newer divinities.

No  female  elemental  magi  exist,  but  elemental  magi

and ogres can interbreed. Such unions do not necessarily

produce more elemental magi. That gift is entirely random,

not hereditary.

Environment:  Elemental  magi  are  most  common  in

foothills and other highlands that support ogres and ogre

mages. Ken-suns also ascend to higher elevations, taking to

the peaks to isolate themselves as they scheme and gather

their forces.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  All  elemental

magi are of a similar size10 to 12 feet talland all are

horned. Beyond that, each is quite distinctive in look and

in powers.

Ken-kunis are the shortest and broadest of the elemental

magi. Their  esh is marbled gray. Each has two horns like

those of a bull, and a third horn juts from the center of its

forehead. Their dull features and powerful muscles are usually

hidden under banded mail, and ken-kunis prefer helms that

allow their horns to protrude.

Ken-lis are broad-shouldered and have massive chests.

Their  flesh  is  the  color  of  burnished  bronze,  and  two

black horns curve backward, extending out of a red mane.

Flames dart and whirl about them. Fire fills their lungs

as well, which causes smoke to pour from their mouth

and nostrils.

Ken-suns  are  the  slimmest  of  the  elemental  magi  and

the  tallest.  A  ken-suns  skin  is  blue-white  in  color,  and  a

single great horn protrudes from the center of its forehead,

measuring 2 to 3 feet in length. Hardened, bony  esh forms

a carapacelike structure over the giants entire body, giving

it a rocky appearance. A ken-sun is typically clad in robes,

which  ap in the breeze created by the giants powers.

Alignment: Elemental magi are usually evil, though each

has a strong tendency to be of a speci c alignment. Ken-kunis

tend  to  be  neutral  evil,  ken-lis  chaotic  evil,  and  ken-suns

lawful evil.

SOCIETY

Ken-lis and ken-kunis are loners unless brought together

by ken-suns. All elemental magi are the enemies of civili-

zation and civilized peoples. Elemental magi seem born

to a purpose, the ken-kunis and ken-lis being naturally

subservient to the ken-suns. That purpose appears to be

pure destruction.

Ken-suns impose only a little order on the territories

they take control ofenough that their minions can be

relied on to defend the area and enough that no one tries to

usurp power. Otherwise, their followers are left to their own

devices, remaining content.

TYPICAL TREASURE

All elemental magi have valuable gear. These trappings are

not considered part of the giants treasure when determining

its other wealth. Elemental magi who have levels in character

classes have equipment normal for NPCs of their Challenge

Rating, but ken-suns usually have additional wealth to reward

their followers.

Ken-kunis keep hoards in their lairs, the loot taken from

those who pass through their territory. They take coins, but

they prefer gems, sculptures, and other items of beauty or

utility,  which  they  can  more  easily  trade.  They  have  half

coins, double goods, and half items.

Ken-lis have little use for treasure and almost never have

any with them. A town a ken-li has laid to waste might still

have  some  recoverable  treasure  among  the  ruins.  Thus,  a

ken-li has half standard treasure.

Ken-suns use treasure as compensation for their followers,

distributing magic items they  nd among their minions and

keeping some for themselves. Most ken-suns have double

standard treasure for their Challenge Rating.

When together in a warband, all three combine their talents

and wealth, creating a greater hoard to supply and pay their

followers. This hoard is often carried on an armored wagon

along with the troops while they march. When the army

takes over a town, the treasure is stored in the most secure

building, as determined by the ken-sun.

ELEMENTAL MAGI

WITH CLASS LEVELS

Elemental magi are warriors, despite their supernatural

powers. They usually advance as fighters, though some

advance  in  other  martial  classes.  Ken-lis  often  become

barbarians, while ken-suns favor leader roles that make

classes  such  as  the  marshal  (Miniatures  Handbook  11)

attractive. Only those classes that improve an elemental

mages base attack bonus by HD  3/4 or better and have

at  least  a  d8  Hit  Die  are  considered  associated  for  an

elemental mage.

Ember  guards  are  typically  minions  of  other  creatures  in

the service of Imix, usually working with salamanders,  re

giants, and efreet. Their purpose is to spread pain and suf-

fering, so they gladly engage anyone they encounter. They

start by spewing a cone of  re to slow their foes. Then, they

wade into the thick of battle, swinging their  sts to buy time

until they can next use their breath.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Imix gives ember guards to his faithful servants. No creature

would refuse such a gift, even though ember guards have

little purpose outside of killing. Their masters are quick to

bring them along on forays into other planes. Efreeti pashas

employ ember guards as mercenaries and guardians, selling

their services to other creatures in exchange for treasures

and slaves.

Flamebrothers Keeper (EL 14): A  amebrother salaman-

der (MM 219) has been prophesied to become a great sorcerer

and spread evil across the world in a tide of  ame. It is cur-

rently in a caravan traveling to a great temple on the Material

Plane, where its magical potential can be unleashed.

When the PCs find the caravan, no trace of the flame-

brother can be seen. Instead, an ember guard tramps forward

in the middle of the caravan. Three average salamanders lead,

and two more bring up the rear. The rest of the caravan is

made up of fourteen cultists (all humanoid adept 1), who

serve only as fodder.

The  amebrother is actually inside the ember guard, kept

safe by its immunity to  re. The characters can either use

divination to detect the salamander or simply  nd it once

they defeat the ember guard.

Bortraxs Mercenaries (EL 18): A pit  end named Bortrax

made a pact with an efreeti pasha from the City of Brass to

gain the service of  ve ember guards. Bortrax intends to send

the pack to the Material Plane to take vengeance on a town

that found and immolated several of his cultists.

The town is located in a river valley, so PCs who can lure the

ember guards to the water (or stop them before they cross it)

might gain an advantage by slowing them down and reducing

the danger of their  re-based attacks.

This is an ember guard, a creature from the

Elemental Plane of Fire. An ember guard can

breathe a cone of  ame that magically slows those

it burns. Cold is this creatures major weakness.

Ember guards are spawned by Imix, Prince of Evil

Fire Elementals. Their essential nature relies

trapped within a skin of brass and stone that is

resilient against all but good weapons. Despite

amazing healing abilities, ember guards lose their

ability to contain their inner  re as they suffer

injuries, causing those nearby to burn as heat and

 ame escape.

If an ember guard is slain, it explodes in a

tremendous burst, showering the area with  ery

cinders.

ECOLOGY

It is said that when a minion of Imix pleases his master, the

Elemental Prince causes ember guards to rise from a lake of

 re. Formed from the hottest  ames and contained in a shell

of brass and rock, they shuf e forward, eager to serve. They

have no need for nourishment, nor do they truly have desires.

Instead, they go where directed, venting the wickedness that

burns hotly within them.

Environment: Ember guards are native to the Elemental

Plane of Fire, where they can be found guarding the palac-

es  of  the  mightiest

nobles. They are sel-

dom  encountered

elsewhere  on  the

plane, though some

bold planar travelers

have claimed to spy

legions of these crea-

tures spawned from

pockets of elemental

earth that bob in the

molten seas.

Typical Physical

Characteristics: A

typical ember guard

stands  18  feet  tall

and  weighs  about

four tons. Its rocky

body is  ecked with

brassy deposits, look-

ing very much like

the body of a Huge

earth elemental. The

differences manifest

themselves  in  the

 ames  ickering in

its  eyes  and  maw,

as  well  as  the  heat

that escapes its body

when it is wounded.

Alignment:

Though only dimly

intelligent,  ember

guards seethe with

malevolence, as ev-

idenced by the chortling noises they make

when they slay their enemies. Ember guards are always law-

ful evil.

camaraderie or companionship is known to them, though

they eerily gather with others of their kind when directed

along no other course of action.

TYPICAL TREASURE

At a glance, it seems veins of brass  eck an ember guards

not valuable material.

SOCIETY

Ember guards are  awlessly obedient, following just about

authority. They are as dense in mind as they are in body,

but their nature and the circumstances of their birth give

them evil inclinations and a desire to do harm. Nothing of

Anchoring Aura (Su) Effects that have the teleportation

descriptor dont function within 20 feet of an ethereal

defiler. Further, opponents must succeed on a DC 24 Will

save to move more than 20 feet from the creature. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

A creature that successfully saves need not save

against that same ethereal defilers anchoring aura for 24

hours. Other ethereal defilers are immune to this aura.

Tainted Energy (Sp) As a swift action, an ethereal defiler

can fire a blast of eldritch energy as a ranged touch

attack to a range of up to 120 feet. The blast deals 6d6

points of damage. An ethereal defiler can instead use

that swift action to imbue a claw with eldritch energy,

dealing an extra 6d6 points of damage if that claw attack

hits. An opponent that takes damage from this energy

must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be sickened

for 1d4 rounds. Caster level 22nd. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Ethereal Bore (Su) Once every 10 rounds, an ethereal

defiler can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the

centered on the ethereal defiler. The burst doesnt harm

the ethereal defiler that created it. This ability otherwise

works like an ethereal jaunt spell (caster level 22nd). The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Ethereal de lers are murderous predators that shift between

the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane in bursts of foul

energy. Bulky and strong, ethereal de lers also have control

over eldritch energy like that which a warlock commands.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

An ethereal de ler prowls the Ethereal Plane, seeking food

and sport. From the Ethereal, it maneuvers among groups of

foes, then uses its ethereal bore ability to emerge and catch as

many as possible in the tainted energy burst that accompanies

its shift. It follows up by targeting the foe that seems most

injured with an empowered tainted energy claw or ray.

The ethereal de ler then focuses on brutally eliminating

one foe at a time with its physical attacks. Recklessly, it uses its

full Power Attack regularly, scaling back only after it realizes

it cant hit with such vicious blows. It reserves empowered

tainted energy attacks to use on blows it thinks might kill or

disable an enemy. When it makes a tainted energy claw attack,

it doesnt use Power Attack.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Ethereal de lers prefer to live and hunt alone, though they

can occasionally be found in pairs. They are rarely caught on

the Material Plane unless theyre attacking prey or eating, so

almost every encounter with an ethereal de ler begins with

an ambush by the creature. Ethereal de lers prefer to attack

their foes in enclosed spaces.

This is an ethereal de ler, a corrupt extraplanar

It uses that same energy to shoot potent rays or

Portal Predator (EL 16): An ethereal de ler lies in wait

on one side of a magic portal in the Underdarka gate

said to lead to centuries-old ruins. It preys on those who

come to investigate the gateway, as well as creatures that

pass through the surrounding

caverns, which the defiler

considers its territory. Sev-

eral factions in the deep

earth know that a danger-

ous creature stalks and kills

those who come near the por-

tal. More than one of them is

willing to pay dearly to have

that  problem  solved  and  the

path to the portal cleared.

ECOLOGY

Ethereal de lers belong to an an-

cient and rare race that comes from

beyond the known realms of the

Material Plane. Built to hunt and

kill,  their  bizarre  nature  imbues

them with corrupt energy that al-

lows them to tunnel between the

Material Plane and the Ethereal

Plane.  They  use  that  same

energy to slaughter their

foes with blasts and dev-

astating claw attacks.

Its likely that ethereal

defilers are somehow re-

lated  to  ethereal  filchers,

ethereal  marauders,  and

ethereal  slayers  (MM2  96),

but  ethereal  defilers  are  al-

together  more  purposeful  and

malevolent.

Not only are ethereal defil-

ers carnivores, they also derive

particular pleasure from slaying

and  devouring  sentient  crea-

tures. Ethereal defilers prefer to

prey on creatures that put up a good

 ght. They also enjoy cat-and-mouse games with their vic-

tims, reveling in inspiring terror beyond that experienced

by mere animals.

Interaction between ethereal de lers is instinctually driven.

They  ght over territory, seeing others of their kind as rivals.

Pairs of ethereal de lers come together brie y to mate, each

laying dark eggs that the other fertilizes. Even mating is risky,

since one ethereal de ler often slays the other as a convenient

meal when mating is done.

Young ethereal de lers are born in explosions of eldritch

energy. The strongest among the hatchlings slays and eats

its siblings.

Environment: Ethereal defilers live primarily on the

Ethereal Plane, appearing on the Material Plane only to feed.

No climate deters them, though they prefer temperate areas

that have ample prey.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Ethereal defilers

green and black scales. Their hands and feet are capped

in  vicious  claws.  They  have  lizardlike

heads,  which  have  two  long  tendrils

ers are hunters, they are wantonly cruel

points of acid damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all creatures

in the area. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Decomposing Slime (Ex) A fetid funguss body produces a

decomposing slime. Any creature that strikes or touches

a fetid fungus with its body, or that grapples a fetid

Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a fetid fungus can

envelop creatures of its size or smaller, entrapping

them within itself. The fungus simply moves into

the opponents space; any creature whose space it

completely covers is subject to the engulf attack. A

fungus cannot make a touch attack during a round in

which it engulfs. It can engulf as many creatures as can

fit in its space.

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against

the fungus, but if they do so, they are not entitled to

A fetid fungus is a foul lichen that feeds off the decomposing

flesh of its prey. These rootless creatures gain sustenance

by enveloping and digesting  esh, and therefore travel con-

stantly to  nd new food sources. Though barely intelligent,

they are skilled hunters and trackers. Once a fetid fungus

latches onto the trail of potential prey, it is relentless.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

As soon as a fetid fungus discovers signs of prey, it tracks the

potential meal, attacking when it senses a foe. A fetid fungus

gravitates toward slower targets. At the  rst opportunity,

it engulfs an opponent, defending itself with acid touch

attacks while its decomposing slime digests the engulfed

individual. If it  nishes its mealor the prey escapesa

fetid fungus immediately seeks another opponent to decom-

pose. Fetid fungi never retreat, continuing to feed and attack

until destroyed.

tivated by a more powerful creature. They can be found in

pods of one to four members.

chosen of Zuggtmoy, the demonic Lady of Fungi, and at the

 rst opportunity, he tries to sacri ce the PCs by leading them

into a deep bog inhabited by a fetid fungus.

ECOLOGY

A  fetid  fungus  is  a

predatory  lichen

colony  that  feeds

by  rapidly  digest-

ing living creatures.

Gases and enzymes released

through decomposition give

the  creature  its  form  and

help it move, so it needs a

constant source of  esh

to survive. The shifting

gases  allow  it  to  move

in a wallowing motion,

rolling  forward  in  an

awkward undulation.

Environment:  Fet-

id  fungi  live  in  moist,

shadowy regions, such

as caverns and forest-

ed  marshes,  bogs,

swamps,  as  well  as

other  places  where

death  and  decay  are

prevalent.  Their  terri-

tory is sometimes marked

with partially decomposed an-

imal bones, unique in that they

are rubbery and smell especially

foul. A successful DC 16 Knowledge

(nature) check reveals that these types

of skeletal remains are left by fetid fungi.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A fetid

fungus is a hairy plant creature that comes in

hues  from  a  pale  flesh  tone  to  red.  Multiple  colors  are

common on one specimen. The fungus seems to be a clump

of  bubbles,  some  of  which  occasionally  pop.  Beneath  a

fetid funguss outer layer is a mass of putrid organic matter,

which  is  a  constant  source  of  energy  that  releases  the

gases  the  fungus  needs  to  move.  These  gases  also  make

the fungus stink.

As a fungus consumes more matter, it continues to grow.

Some reach the size of a large ox, but even these massive

colonies weigh only 20 pounds. Eventually, the buildup of

gases causes the creature to increase beyond a maintainable

size. At this point, the fungus breaks apart into smaller

colonies about the size of a small keg of wine, each weighing

less than 5 pounds.

Alignment: Fetid fungi have no sense of morality, and

they are therefore always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Fetid fungi dont value material objects and therefore do not

deliberately acquire treasure. Large items are ejected as waste,

but smaller pieces can become embedded in the creatures

skin of lichen. This treasure amounts to standard coins and

goods (gems only), but no items.

suppress this ability at will as a free action. Frostwind

viragos are immune to this aura.

Frostbite Touch (Su) A frostwind viragos touch disrupts

matter and freezes it. Each die of damage is modified by

the frostwind viragos Charisma bonus.

Captivating Call (Su) When a frostwind virago speaks and

wills it to be so, all creatures (other than frostwind

viragos) within a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed

on a DC 30 Will save or become captivated. This is a

language-based, sonic mind-affecting ability. A creature

that successfully saves cannot be affected again by that

same frostwind viragos call for 24 hours. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

A captivated victim walks toward the frostwind virago,

taking the most direct route available. If the path leads

into a dangerous area, that opponent receives a second

saving throw. Captivated foes can take no actions other

than to avoid attack. A captivated victim within 5 feet of a

frostwind virago stands there and offers no resistance to

the feys attacks. The effect continues for as long as the

frostwind virago speaks and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A

bards countersong ability allows a captivated victim to

attempt a new Will save.

Icy Vortex (Su) A frostwind virago can produce a whirling

mass of ice shards that lasts 1 round in a 30-foot radius

around herself. Creatures in the area take 4d6 points of

piercing damage plus 4d6 points of cold damage (Reflex

DC 30 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Skills A frostwind virago has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

She can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if

distracted or endangered. She can use the run action

when swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.

Frostwind viragos are embodiments of the unforgiving and

indiscriminately cruel heart of deep winter.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A frostwind virago prefers to look like a fur-clad maiden and

lure her victims in with a captivating call, suppressing her

mind freeze aura until her victims are close by. The schem-

ing fey then activates her aura, focusing her attacks on those

who are not affected by her call. She uses Whirlwind Attack

whenever this allows her to make more than two attacks,

and she favors this technique when surrounded by enemies,

even if those opponents are captivated, dazed, or stunned.

If her adversaries are spread out, she uses her icy vortex to

deal with them.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Frostwind viragos are rare. They are usually found alone, but

some ally themselves with frost giants or rule over weaker

malevolent creatures in cold climes.

A Cold Welcome (EL 16): A frostwind virago lights a

lantern at the top of her ice tower during mountain blizzards.

The dark mountain path to her lair is treacherous, and she

rewards with icy death any who make it to her door.

ECOLOGY

Frostwind viragos are imbued with the essence of bitter

winter. Their blood is freezing to the touch and thick like

molasses, and even their touch imparts a bitter chill. They

live in remote cold locales, where they subsist on the

frozen  esh of mammals they have slain, consum-

ing snow and ice for water.

A frostwind virago is devoid of love, but

she can experience desire, often taking a

frost folk (Frostburn 130) champion or

other humanoid as a lover in such

cases.  The  relationship  is  short

and stormy, resulting in a frost-

wind virago child.

Environment:  Frostwind

viragos prefer to live in cold

mountains,  usually  within  a

carved cave of ice or a natural

cavern  overlooking  a  pass.

The virago claims those who

wander into her territory.

Typical Physical Charac-

teristics: Frostwind viragos

are  the  size  of  female  elves,

about 5 feet tall and 90 pounds.

Their skin is pale, and their hair

is blonde to stark white. A frost-

wind viragos eyes are solid blue,

lacking any hint of white.

Alignment: Frostwind viragos

despise warm-blooded intelligent

creatures that use their cleverness

to avoid the freezing grasp of the

cold months. They are remorse-

less killers who toy with their

prey, but they can be reasoned

with, and they see the value of

working toward a common cause

with other creatures. These fey are usu-

ally neutral evil.

Frostwind virago

SOCIETY

Frostwind viragos consider themselves the handmaidens of

Auril (Frostburn 42), the sinister Frostmaiden of the frostfell.

They desire nothing less than the domination of the world

by ice. From their homes in the frozen wilderness, these fey

act as lone and heartless agents of winter, hunting wanderers

and ill-fated locals. Such frostwind viragos enjoy the hunt

and the kill, but even they can be swayed by a humble offer

of tribute.

Others of these fey set themselves up as monarchs in

snow-covered lands, ruling over other creatures native to

cold climes, including frost folk who revere the virago as

semidivine. Within such malign courts, frostwind viragos

scheme to control other lands. Their subjects carry out

complex plots of destruction and misfortune constructed to

show the implacable nature of the cold season.

A few frostwind viragos  nd a place among

frost giants. The giants respect the frostwind

virago as a mighty spirit of winter, and the fey

resides among them as a protector and advisor.

More than one frost giant monarch has a frost-

wind virago as a counselor.

Universal  among  frostwind  vira-

gos is their hatred for fey of temperate

and warm climes. Such fey that wander

into a frostwind viragos territory are

doomed to prolonged suffering be-

fore they are allowed to succumb to

the cold.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Given that their prey is human-

oid, and that tribute is the only way

to  stay  their  icy  hands,  frostwind

viragos amass quite a collection of

treasure. They have standard treasure

for their Challenge Rating, mostly

in the form of goods and items taken

from travelers.

FROSTWIND VIRAGOS

IN EBERRON

Frostwind viragos can be found in

the  Icehorn  Mountains  north  of

the Eldeen Reaches, as well as the

northern  Ironroot  Mountains  of

Karrnath and the Mror Holds. At

least one of these malevolent

fey  lives  in  the  Icewood  of

northern Karrnath, where she

draws travelers toward the Madstone. The

dwarves of the Mror Holds and the people

of the mainland Lhazaar Principalities suf-

fer the depredations of frostwind viragos in the Hoarfrost

Mountains as well.

FROSTWIND VIRAGOS IN FAERN

Among the most feared creatures in the North, these hand-

maidens of Auril (Faiths and Pantheons 91) above) are found

throughout Icewind Dale and the lands of the Frozenfar.

Frostwind viragos prefer to live in the treacherous reaches

of the Spine of the World. Though some frostwind viragos

have been seen as far south as the Sword Coast during the

winter, they prefer to stay well to the north, preying on the

folk of the Savage Frontier.

Devastating Roar (Ex) As a full-round action, a garngrath can

unleash a roar of such ferocity that it damages creatures

and structures. The roar deals 20d6 points of sonic

damage in a 60-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 35 half).

In addition, this roar levels all terrain adjacent to the

garngrath, reducing it to light rubble and increasing the

DC of Balance checks and Tumble checks by 2. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Swallow Whole (Ex) A garngrath can swallow a grappled

opponent of up to Gargantuan size by making a

successful grapple check.

A swallowed creature takes 6d6 points of

bludgeoning damage and 6d6 points of acid damage per

round from the garngraths gizzard. The creature can cut

its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon

to deal 50 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 23; DR

15/epic). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes

the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own

way out.

A garngraths gizzard can hold 2 Gargantuan, 8

Huge, 32 Large, 128 Medium, or 512 Small or smaller

opponents.

Swallowing Charge (Ex) As a full-round action, a garngrath

can open its crushing jaws, lay its gaping maw upon

the ground, and rush forward 80 feet, swallowing

everything in its path. Every creature in its 30-foot-wide

path must make a grapple check as if being swallowed

whole or immediately pass into the garngraths gizzard.

Unattended objects and structures of Gargantuan or

smaller size are swallowed as well.

Garngraths are titanic creatures created by Erythnul as ever-

hungering engines of destruction. A garngraths incredible

might and brutish appetite are complemented by the terrify-

ing power of its crystal horn.

This is a garngrath, a destructive magical beast

from Pandemonium. On that plane, garngraths

are apex predators capable of swallowing several

creatures in one gulp. In fact, a garngrath can

charge headlong, swallowing all in its path.

The horn on a garngraths head can rapidly emit

prismatic rays. Its hide is shrouded in extraplanar

energy that makes it hard to hit. It is highly

resistant to acid and cold, and its immune to

ability damage, electricity, energy drain,  re,

illusions, insanity, and sonic damage.

40  A garngrath is resistant to spells of all sorts, and

only epic weapons can effectively harm it. It can

unleash a devastating roar capable of rendering

the ground to rubble when its threatened. If the

beast is slain, its horn can be claimed as a potent

prize.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

When a garngrath spots prey, it burrows toward its quarry

and erupts from the ground nearby. It then uses its swal-

lowing charge, wading into melee with survivors afterward.

Its only goal is to slay and devour its foes, so it uses Power

Attack liberally and tries to swallow any creature it man-

ages to grab. Every round it unleashes a prismatic spray. A

garngrath favors melee over using its devastating roar unless

it plans to retreat. If dangerous enemies remain after the

ear-splitting bellow, a garngrath might  ee using its plane

shift ability.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Garngraths appear in numbers greater than one only when

they precede a great extraplanar army.

Slaughter Cometh (EL 20): It approaches on the horizona

great garngrath unleashed by an extraplanar entity bent on

the destruction of the PCs entire civilization. The voracious

monstrosity has already reduced three cities to rubble,

and the characters haven is next. Unless the characters

slay the garngrath, thousands will perish before its

other worldly gluttony.

ECOLOGY

Erythnul created the first garngraths to accompany

and amuse him, attaching crystal horns to them to add

to the mayhem. He purposefully let some garngraths slip

into the wilds of Pandemonium, along with the mystery of

crafting and grafting the crystal horns. Extremely powerful

extraplanar entities have used this knowledge and garngraths

in warfare since then.

When Erythnul created the garngraths, he made them

to withstand Pandemoniums environment as the planes

ultimate predators. These beasts can eat and digest any

matter that doesnt kill them  rst. They burrow by chewing,

tunneling by eating whatever they move through.

Garngraths are rare. Though they do mate, two garngraths

are more likely to  ght to the death than engage in courtship.

The victor slaughters and consumes the loser. Even garngrath

young are killed by their mothers if they do not burrow into

the ground soon after being born.

Young garngraths are born Gargantuan and grow to adult

size within a matter of weeks during a  urry of unabated

feeding. After a garngrath reaches Colossal size, its metabo-

lism churns at an amazing rate. Garngraths rarely live to see

30 years of life, however, aging rapidly due to this consump-

tive vitality.

Environment:  Garngraths  are  native  to  the  Wind-

swept Depths of Pandemonium. They burrow into the mass

of matter that makes up the planes ground, adding to the

innumerable  tunnels  therein.  The  garngraths  ability  to

plane shift means they can be found just about anywhere,

but few garngraths use this ability to leave Pandemonium.

The  beasts  must  be  trained  to  go  to  other  planes,  except

when  eeing a losing battle.

Garngrath

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical garngrath

is 70 feet long, 20 feet tall, and weighs more than  fty tons.

Shaggy black fur covers its body in dreadlocked tendrils.

The air around a garngrath shifts and roils under the sway

of  its  dimensional  shield,  giving  its  hide  an  unnatural

appearance as though its fur and skin possessed a life of

their own. Six muscular legs concealed beneath patches of

fur and scale end in claws of a mineral composition similar

to quartz, but far stronger. The creatures oversized reptil-

ian  head  is  crowned  with  an  enormous  horn  of  shining

prismatic crystal and ringed in a long mane of black fur.

Rows of teeth in its maw resemble jagged pieces of glass

jutting in all directions.

Alignment:  Garngraths  revel  in  wanton  butchery  and

massive destruction. They are always chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A garngrath leaves nothing in its wake, and it digests what-

ever it swallows. But if a garngrath is slain, its horn falls off

and can be retrieved. If this is done, the horn immediately

 xes itself to the head of the creature that retrieved it, resiz-

ing to match the skull of its new owner (Fortitude DC 35

negates). The horn then acts as a helm of brilliance, falling

as powder from the new owners skull when its last jewel

is depleted.

GEM SCARAB

A brightly shining beetle emerges from the ground in a shower of

in arid and sandy lands.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Gem scarabs form subterranean packs and attack as a group.

They launch their ambush from the soil beneath their target,

attempting to deal as much damage as possible in the  rst

moments to maximize the advantage of surprise. If this is not

suf cient to bring down their prey, they use their gemstone

powers to dazzle or kill their opponents.

Gem scarabs are tenacious, refusing to give up the  ght

until they are all killed.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Gem scarabs live and hunt in packs. These groups range in

size from two to ten scarabs.

Grazing Ground (EL 5): A small colony of gem scarabs

has  set  up  a  nest  at  the  edge  of  a  grazing  area,  and  the

creatures have begun terrorizing the local peasants who

full-grown scarabs, and the peasants

Gem scarabs

gem scarabs, because the beetles eat valuable minerals and

rob the soil of nutrients, ruining it for farming.

Gem scarabs spend part of their time in tunnels, burrowing

through the grit in search of minerals to digest and add to

their carapaces. They also prey on living creatures, sentient

or not, for meat. With an uncanny ability to  nd valuable

minerals,  gem  scarabs  attack  trade  convoys  or  wandering

merchants, from which they can acquire both of the types

of food they crave.

The minerals a gem scarab eats go into its carapace and

gemlike growths on that shell. Within the largest of these

crystalline structures, a gem scarab stores magical energy to

power its spell-like abilities. When a scarab uses the energy

stored within a gem, that gem crumbles to dust and the beetle

sheds it. Other gems on the scarab become big enough to

hold more energy for the creature within a day.

Environment: Gem scarabs prefer to live in hot, dry, dusty

climates, typically deserts and parched scrublands. They have

also been known to settle in fringes of grasslands during

the summer.

They dig  their burrows  near  water  holes, oases, rivers,

and other places where animals are likely to pass. Some

learn the routes and trails where people take their animals

to market, and such scarabs burrow beneath the road to

await their next meal.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Gem scarabs come

in a wide variety of hues and have an equally wide variety

of gemstones upon their backs. Each scarab has six fully

formed stones.

A gem scarabs carapace can be silver, gold, copper, or

any other metallic sheen, often subtly shifting in color

from  one  end  of  the  beetle  to  the  other.  Upon  their

wing  cases  grow  encrustations  of  what  appear  to  be

gemstonescrystallized minerals that are as radiant and

lovely as any jewel.

Normal gem scarabs are 2 feet in length, with six barbed

legs and  erce mandibles that are adapted to breaking up

minerals. This adaptation also makes the mandibles suitable

for hurting animals and people.

Alignment: Gem scarabs are almost instinctual, operating

with no regard for morality. They are always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Gem scarabs dont collect treasurethey eat it. Those whose

treasure hoards have been nibbled at by an infestation of

pqqqqqqqqqrs

NEW GEM SCARABS

Gem scarabs can come in other varieties. Just about any

cantrip or orison is acceptable as a spell-like ability for a par-

ticular gem scarab. For example, a topaz scarab might have

cure minor wounds as its spell-like ability, while an onyx scarab

could have inflict minor wounds.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

gem scarabs can take some consolation from the fact that,

once the beetles are killed, their gems and carapaces can be

worth a small fortune.

When removed from slain scarabs, the gemstones are no

longer magical, but they retain some value. If a scarab is

killed before it uses its daily allotment of spell-like abili-

ties, the remaining fully formed gems on its carapace can be

harvested and are worth 100 gp each. For each time a slain

scarab used its spell-like ability, reduce the number of intact

gems by one.

Gems removed from living scarabs crumble to dust, since

the  creature  immediately  transfers  the  energy  within  a

harvested gem to another one on its back. Such harvesting

also deals the scarab 1 point of damage.

The metallic carapaces of gem scarabs are valued for use in

jewelry, inks, makeup, and dye. A few desert folk know how

to make the carapace into thread as well, replacing actual

metallic thread. Each slain scarab has enough undamaged

carapace left to sell for 1100 gp.

When gem scarabs catch sentient creatures, they eat all

minerals of a nonmagical nature along with the  esh. Other

items might remain at the site.

All these possibilities work together to give a gem scarab

standard treasure for its Challenge Rating.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A  gem  scarab  can  be  acquired  as  an  improved  familiar

(DMG 200). A spellcaster of any alignment can have a gem

scarab familiar, but that character must have an arcane

spellcaster level of 5th and the Improved Familiar feat.

The gem scarabs master can select the 0-level spell the

familiar uses as its spell-like ability before summoning

the creature, but that choice cannot be changed after the

familiar is summoned.

Gruumshs Glare (Su) DC 15

Nozgg is an independent raider covered in glorya paragon

among his people. He had the following ability scores before

Hit Dice and racial ability score adjustments: Str 15, Dex 13,

Con 14, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 10.

Strategies and Tactics

Nozgg has only two purposes in lifeto slay and to pillage.

He uses his Gruumshs glare ability to paralyze his enemies,

then charges in to murder a helpless foe. Gruumshs fury he

reserves for a worthy enemy or an elf. Wishing to keep his

divine talents, he activates his divine endurance only if he

thinks he might lose the  ght otherwise.

Sample Encounters

Becoming god-blooded is invariably a great honor, and god-

blooded  creatures  serve  as  warlords  and  champions.  Sites

where creatures can acquire the god-blooded template are

protected  ercely.

Nozggs Raiders (EL 9): Nozgg raids accompanied by

an orc berserker (MM4 114), an orc war howler (MM4 114),

and six orc warriors (MM 203). His warriors provide  anks

and sometimes use the aid another action to give Nozgg

more of an advantage. The berserker wades in independently,

and the war howler provides support. Nozgg focuses his

attacks on elves, moving to other targets only after all elves

are slain.

Neversleep Citadel (EL 9+ per encounter): High in

the Altan Tepes Mountains, an ancient order of orc priests

watches over a bubbling cauldron filled with blood spilled

by Gruumsh. According to legend, Gruumsh bled on this

spot when Corellon cut the orc gods eye from its socket.

The clerics allow orc champions who perform great deeds

in Gruumshs name and can make it to the cauldron to

bathe within, granting them a measure of the gods power.

Nozgg  is  one  such  champion,  and  the  citadel  is  now

his home.

The citadel protecting the cauldron houses a small army

of orc barbarians, fighters, and clerics. Some of these are

half-dragons. A young adult red dragon protects the place

due to an ancient pact between Gruumsh and Tiamat. This

dragon leaves and is replaced by another when it reaches

adulthood.

CREATING A GOD-BLOODED

CREATURE

God-blooded is an acquired template that can be added

to a creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature)

favored by the deity in question, as de ned in the speci c

deity entries.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.

Special Actions: The base creature gains the following

special action.

Divine Endurance: A god-blooded creature can take

a  free  action  to  gain  damage  reduction

10/ from the mingling of divine blood

with its material form. The creature can

suppress  this  ability  with  another  free

action. Once the damage reduction has

prevented 40 points of damage, the

creature  loses  all  benefits  of  the

god-blooded  template,  including

this  ability,  except  when  oth-

erwise noted.

Other  Abilities:  All  god-

blooded creatures receive other

abilities  based  on  the  blood

they bathe in. See the deity

entries below.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Gruumsh-Blooded

Gruumsh-blooded

is an acquired tem-

plate that can be

added to any orc.

Gruumsh-blooded

orcs are typically created

at unholy sites, where

clerics of Gruumsh tend

iron  cauldrons   lled

with  their  gods  bubbling

green  blood.  When  an  orc

bathes  in  the  blood,  his  left

eye  shrivels  and  falls

out, leaving an empty

socket. The eye doesnt

regrow  even  if  the

orc subsequently loses

this template.

Special  Actions:  A  Gruumsh-

blooded  orc  gains  the  following  special

actions.

Nozgg, Gruumsh-blooded orc

Gruumshs Glare (Su): Once per day, a Gruumsh-blooded

orc can cause a baleful, glowing red eye to appear in his

empty eye socket. The eye creates a 60-foot cone of red

energy. All creatures in this area must succeed on Forti-

tude saves (DC 10 + 1/2 the orcs HD + his Con modifier)

or be paralyzed for 1 round. Elves take a 4 penalty on

this save.

Gruumshs Fury (Su): Once per day, as a swift action, a

Gruumsh-blooded orc can draw upon the power of the divine

blood within his body to gain a +4 bonus (+8 against elves)

on damage rolls for the rest of his turn.

Imix-Blooded

Imix-blooded  is  an  acquired  template  that  can

be added to any evil creature. A creature gains this

template through service to Imix, Prince of Evil Fire

Elementals. The creature must perform a great deed

in the name of Imix, and then, when the signs and omens

are promising, stand in a brass cauldron  lled with oil and

set it alight. If Imix is pleased, he

appears  and  squeezes  a  single

drop of his  ery blood into the

cauldron,  granting  the  crea-

ture this template.

Subtype:  An  Imix-

blooded  creature  gains

the  re subtype.

Special Actions: An

Imix-blooded  creature

gains the following spe-

cial action.

Imixs Wrath (Su): An Imix-

blooded creature is wreathed in

 ames  that  dont  harm  its

equipment. Once per day,

as a swift action, an

Imix-blooded crea-

ture can cause  re

to  flow  from  its

body over its weapons.

All  the  creatures  melee

attacks  deal  an  ex-

tra 4 points of  re

damage  until  the

end of its turn. If an

Imix-blooded creature

casts a  re spell while

affected by this quality,

that spell deals an extra

number  of  points  of  dam-

age equal to the Imix-blooded creatures

caster level.

Special Qualities: An Imix-blooded

creature gains the following special qualities.

Burn (Su): The  res that cloak an Imix-blooded creature lash

out to harm those who would dare attack it. Any creature that

hits an Imix-blooded foe with a melee attack takes 3 points

of  re damage.

Death  Throes  (Su):  Imix  is  quick  to  reward  those  who

follow him, but his fiery anger is legendary. When killed,

an  Imix-blooded  creature  explodes  in  a  30-foot-radius

burst that deals fire damage to each creature or object in

the area equal to 1d6  1/2 the Imix-blooded creatures

Challenge Rating. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2

the Imix-blooded creatures HD + its Cha modifier) halves

this damage.

Kord-Blooded

Vecna-Blooded

Kord-blooded is an acquired template that can be added to

any non-evil living creature that has a Strength score of 16

or higher. Each year, the major temples to Kord hold a great

wrestling tournament, and the tournaments winner wrestles

an aspect of Kord. Whoever pins the other wins. If Kords

aspect loses, he cuts his palm and drips a drop of blood on

the victors brow, bestowing this template. Sometimes Kord

bestows this honor on a skilled, relentless competitor that

lost the match.

Saves: A Kord-blooded creature gains a +4 bonus on saves

against poison and disease.

Special Actions: A Kord-blooded creature gains the fol-

lowing special action.

Kords Athleticism (Su): Once per day, as a swift action, a

Kord-blooded creature can call upon the blood invested

in him to gain a tremendous surge of prowess. For the

next minute, the Kord-blooded creature gains a +4 bonus

on Strength and Dexterity checks, Strength- and Dexter-

ity-based skill checks, and grapple checks. The creature

also gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls to which Strength

normally applies.

Special  Qualities:  A  Kord-blooded  creature  gains  the

following special quality.

Kords Toughness (Su): Whenever a Kord-blooded creature

would take Constitution damage, that damage is halved.

Orcus-Blooded

Orcus-blooded is an acquired template that can be added

to any evil undead creature. The sacri ce of good-aligned

creatures totaling 20 or more Hit Dice causes an aspect of

Orcus to appear and bathe the petitioner with black, tarry

blood poured from a golden chalice. The undead creature

covered in this blood then grows goatlike horns and gains

the Orcus-blooded template. The horns disappear when the

template is lost.

Resist: An Orcus-blooded creature gains +4 turn resistance.

Special Qualities: An Orcus-blooded creature gains the

following special qualities.

Herald  of  Orcus  (Su):  An  Orcus-blooded  creature  gains

a +1 bonus to the save DCs of necromancy spells it casts,

as well as a +1 bonus to the save DCs of its spell-like and

supernatural abilities.

Wand of Orcus (Su): Once per day, as a swift action, an Orcus-

blooded creature can summon a minor wand of Orcus. The

wand appears in the creatures hand and lasts for 1 minute.

It functions as a +2 morningstar.

Once per day, while the wand exists, the Orcus-blooded

creature can use it to deliver a melee touch attack. An oppo-

nent so touched must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 the Orcus-blooded creatures HD + its Cha modi er) or

take 4 points of Constitution damage. If that foe fails the save,

the Orcus-blooded creature gains 2 temporary hit points per

HD that enemy possesses. These temporary hit points last

for 1 hour.

Vecna-blooded is an acquired template that can be added to

any evil creature capable of casting 2nd-level or higher arcane

spells. When an arcane spellcaster manages to unravel the

Seven Riddles of Vecna, that individual can become Vecna-

blooded. None know the true nature of these riddles, but

solving them sends a caster to a pocket dimension known as

the Oubliette of Secrets. There, after exposure to a number

of bizarre tortures and ordeals at the hands of a strange

creature known as the Anchorite, the caster emerges as a

Vecna-blooded creature. The creature loses all distinguishing

characteristics, hair, and other traits, keeping only a small,

thin mouth, the faintest trace of a nose, and eyes. These

changes are permanent and remain even after the creature

loses this template.

Some sages believe that several Anchorites exist, and that

they are the most powerful of Vecnas servants. They seek out

lost secrets and forgotten lore. Several point to the disappear-

ance of Delether of Hardby as the Anchorites work. Every

page of the books in Delethers library had been carefully

removed and replaced with cured human skinapparently

taken from Delether, judging by the faint remnants of his

tattoos found in several of the volumes.

Special Actions: A Vecna-blooded creature gains the

following special actions.

Enigma Aura (Su): Once per day, as a standard action, a

Vecna-blooded creature can wrap itself in an aura that makes

creatures within 120 feet intermittently forget its there. At

the start of each affected creatures turn, that creature has a

50% chance to be unable to attack the Vecna-blooded creature

in any way, including with spells and special abilities. The

aura lasts for 1 minute after its activated.

Hidden Spell (Su): Once per day, as a swift action, a Vecna-

blooded creature can cause  at-footed opponents to take a

Special Qualities: A Vecna-blooded creature gains the

following special qualities.

Cloak of Mystery (Su): All knowledge of the Vecna-blooded

creature fades from the world. Its original name, its deeds

before becoming Vecna-blooded, and so forth, disappear from

memory. Only Vecna and the Vecna-blooded creature retain

this knowledge.

A Vecna-blooded creature gains immunity to all divination

spells  cast  against  it  or  cast  to  learn  information  about  it.

Such divination fails to reveal any information. The Vecna-

blooded creature immediately learns the name, appearance,

and location of the caster who attempted the divination.

Unlike other god-blooded abilities, the Vecna-blooded

creature retains this special quality after it loses other abilities

from this template.

Yeenoghu-Blooded

Yeenoghu-blooded is an acquired template that can be added

to any gnoll. A gnoll champion gains the Yeenoghu-blooded

template by killing a fellow gnoll who has this template and

drinking his blood. In this manner, Yeenoghu ensures that

his children continually strive to prove themselves against

each other and their enemies. Occasionally, when an aspect

of Yeenoghu appears before a tribe, the gnolls attack it in a

frenzy to become Yeenoghu-blooded. Those who survive and

devour the aspects  esh gain this template.

A creature that gains this template becomes shrouded in

noxious, putrid air. Flies and maggots swarm over its body,

marking its link to the fearsome Demon Prince of Gnolls.

It grows long, yellow fangs, and a mixture of pus and drool

spills over its lower lip.

Melee: A Yeenoghu-blooded creature gains a secondary

bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage.

Special Actions: A Yeenoghu-blooded creature gains the

following special actions.

Rot Fangs (Ex): Once per day, as a swift action, a Yeenoghu-

blooded creature can imbue its bite with a dreadful necrotic

energy. The next time the gnoll hits an opponent with a bite,

that foe must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the

gnolls HD + its Con modi er) or take 1d6 points of Constitu-

tion damage.

Special Quality: A Yeenoghu-blooded creature gains the

following special quality.

Gore Stench (Su): A Yeenoghu-blooded creature is caked with

putrid  lth, dried blood, and gore. Maggots crawl through

its fur, and a horri c stench and a swarm of  ies surround it

all times. Living creatures (except for gnolls) within 10 feet

of a Yeenoghu-blooded creature must succeed on a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gnolls HD + its Con modi er) or be

sickened for 1 minute. If a creature successfully saves against

this ability, that creature need not save again for 24 hours. A

delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from

a sickened creature. Creatures that are immune to poison or

that have a saving throw bonus against poison receive those

bene ts against the stench.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A god-blooded creature usually carries icons of its faith,

to mark the favor of the gods and to display its piety. God-

blooded  NPCs  have  equipment  appropriate  to  NPCs  of

their Challenge Ratingslightly more than normal for

their level.

CREATING GOD-BLOODED

TEMPLATES

The example templates given in this entry cover some of

the entities found in the D&D world. If you wish to add

god-blooded creatures to Eberron, Faern, or your campaign

setting, use the following guidelines.

A god-blooded template should physically alter its recipient

in a manner in keeping with the gods ethos and important

physical traits. Powers granted by the template might further

change the recipient. In the examples given in this entry,

Gruumshs single eye, Imixs  ery body, and Orcuss horns

mark the creature that receives the deitys blood. Similar

traits should be gained from templates you create.

All god-blooded templates share the divine endurance

special  quality.  This  ability  re ects  a  combination  of  the

supernatural protection offered by divine blood. As pre-

sented, the template produces a creature that seems incredibly

dif cult to harm at the start of an encounter. If the characters

persist in attacking, though, they eventually strip away that

defense.  If  you  prefer  a  permanent  template,  change  the

damage reduction to 5/magic and remove the limit on the

damage it can absorb.

The template should grant two special abilities in addition

to divine endurance. You can add a third if that ability has

little direct effect on combat. The Vecna-blooded template

provides a good example of such an ability with its cloak of

mystery. The cloak adds some interesting story elements to

the creature, but it has little effect during a  ght.

The creatures abilities should be useful regardless of its

 nal Challenge Rating. Abilities that deal a  xed amount of

damage are dif cult to judge, since that damage doesnt scale

as the creatures CR increases. Instead of such abilities, focus

on attacks that require saving throws and impose conditions,

since save DCs improve as Hit Dice increase, forcing the

PCs to make saving throws appropriate for the creatures

challenge. Keep the duration conditions such as paralyzed,

dazed, or stunned shortthey take a target out of the  ght.

Longer durations are  ne for dazzled, sickened, and other

conditions that impose penalties.

Avoid  abilities  that  add  static  bonuses  to  ability  scores,

attacks, or AC, instead choosing abilities that make it apparent

to the characters and players that the god-blooded creature is

infused with the power of its deity. The PCs (and the players)

should see a clear link between the creatures altered form,

the power it calls upon, and the effects it can create.

GOLEM

Golems are magically created automatons of great power.

Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic

and elemental forces. Golems are summarized on page 134

of the Monster Manual.

FORCE GOLEM

Humanoid in shape but covered in reflective blue-green metal

plates, this creature looks as though it has been mangled or rent by

powerful hands. Its body sags as though its armor has melted, or

perhaps was reshaped by great force.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A force golem is immune to spells

and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. This

immunity does not extend to force effects.

Force Vulnerability (Ex) Force effects deal half again as much

(+50%) damage to a force golem.

Force Burst (Su) Once every 3 rounds, a force golem can

create a 30-foot-radius burst of force centered on itself.

Creatures in the area take 2d6 points of damage and

are knocked prone. Those who succeed on a DC 14

Reflex save take half damage and remain standing.

Force golems are immune to this ability. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Force Reactive (Su) Whenever an opponent attacks and

misses a force golem with a melee attack, the force golem

can turn the kinetic energy of the attack back on the

attacker as an immediate action. The attacker is pushed

5 feet into an empty square of the force golems choice.

This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Pulse (Sp) A force golem can target any corporeal opponent

within 60 feet with a ranged touch attack. If the force

golem hits, it and its target make opposed Strength

checks. If the force golem wins the opposed check, the

opponent is pushed 10 feet in a direction of the golems

choice and falls prone in the square it ends up in. This

movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

A force golem can push an opponent only in a

straight line, and it cannot push an opponent closer to

it than the square that foe started in. If an intervening

obstacle prevents the opponent from being pushed 10

feet, the foe and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of

damage. The opponent then falls prone in the square it

was in before striking the obstacle.

Any feat or special ability that grants a bonus on

resisting bull rush attempts (such as a dwarfs stability)

applies to this opposed Strength check.

Force golems are imbued with the power to manipulate

kinetic energy and raw force. They can turn opponents

attacks back against them and knock foes flying with a

thought.

Strategies and Tactics

A force golems unusual intelligence has a speci c purpose,

allowing it to make the best use of its force burst and pulse

abilities.  These  constructs  are  capable  of  complex  tactical

analysis, and they never simply lash out at random foes.

The key to a force golems success in combat lies in keeping

enemies at a distance. Already immune to a lot of magical

attacks, force golems ward off melee attackers, using their

force burst ability and their pulse attack, knocking foes

against walls or other obstacles if possible. A force golem

does its best to knock opponents over pitfalls or drop-offs on

the battle eld.

If attackers close to melee range, a force golem uses its force

burst to keep from being surrounded or  anked. It uses its

force reactive ability to push combatants away as well, keeping

smaller combatants at a disadvantage.

A group of force golems can be devastating in combat.

They stagger the use of their force bursts to attack foes in

each round and prevent those enemies from gaining strategic

position. They target different ranged foes with their pulse

ability, breaking up the opposing force.

FORCE GOLEM LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can learn

with a damage-dealing burst of force. It can target

individual creatures and push them backward with

a pulse of force.

Force golems can absorb and redirect the kinetic

energy of missed melee attacks, knocking

opponents out of melee range. They are immune

to most magic but vulnerable to force effects.

Sample Encounter

Though force golems are typically deployed as guardians,

wizards and sorcerers sometimes use these creatures as

combat support. Able to push foes away from a spellcaster or

prevent enemies from  eeing, a force golem makes a great

bodyguard. It can also help an arcane spellcaster maximize

the number of creatures affected by area spells. These intel-

ligent golems are commonly found in pairs, but they might

appear in larger gangs.

Trap Masters (EL 8): Three force golems guard a huge

antechamber to a wizards ancient vault. On the floor of

the antechamber is a circle of sigils that

functions as a fireball trap (DMG 72).

Immune  to  the  traps  effect,  the

force golems use their abilities

to move opponents around, set-

ting off the trap as many times as

possible during any battle against

interlopers.

Ecology

A force golem is a construct body in-

habited by an elemental spirit that

made a pact with the golems cre-

ator, requiring the golem to

follow orders but allowing the

elemental spirit some inde-

pendence and awareness.

As such, force golems can

be controlled more effec-

tively than other types of

golemsthey  can  follow

complex orders and carry out

sophisticated  tasks.  Though

they  think  independently,

force golems usually carry

out their commands unfail-

ingly. However, if a master

proves  overly  domineering,  a

force golem might make life

more dif cult for that creature

or even rebel against it.

Environment: Force golems function

in any environment, though they prefer places where they

can use their abilities to their best advantage. Wide-open

spaces allow them to maximize the number of enemies

they can affect. Force golems avoid confined areas when

they can.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Force golems appear to

have been created with an orderly design in minda design

somehow ruined by the powerful forces these constructs

control. Their armor is bent and has a melted quality, an

effect of the residual energy that radiates constantly from

their bodies.

Force golems are tall but stout. They stand about 8 feet tall

and weigh 1,200 pounds.

Alignment: Though they have greater intelligence than

others of their kind, nearly all force golems remain steadfastly

neutral. A rare few of these constructs willingly take on the

morals of good or evil masters, and some  ee from any control

that attempts to subvert their neutral nature.

Society

When not controlled, these intelligent constructs are drawn

to populated areas. Barring prejudice against them,

force golems can develop relationships with other

creatures.  Some  even  seem  to  need  compan-

ionship, which is why they usually

appear in groups.

G

O

L

E

M

Though they have no soci-

ety  or  culture,  force  golems

share a common bond of un-

derstanding.  They  consider

other force golems to be al-

lies. Force golems that have

broken  away  from  their

masters  sometimes  form

small bands, defending each

other from common foes.

Typical Treasure

A force golem has usually has

no  wealth  of  its  own,  but  it

might  guard  its  masters

valuables. One that is free

of  outside  control  could  de-

velop  a  taste  for  riches  and

acquire standard treasure for

its Challenge Rating.

For Player

Characters

Arcane spellcasters create

force golems as guardians

for  specific  locations,  as

bodyguards, or both. With

their high intelligence and force-manipulation

abilities, these constructs are dif cult to thwart, and they

can contain foes rather than destroy them. They are also able

to differentiate malicious intruders from simple trespassers

who  might  be  indiscriminately  slain  by  nonintelligent

golems or magic traps.

Force Golem Construction: A force golems metal body

is composed of several different alloys, blended together in

a precise combination before being poured into specially

created molds that cost 2,000 gp. Raw materials and sup-

plies for this process cost 2,250 gp. A mold can be used only

once; it is destroyed in the process of creating the golem.

69

Creating the body from the shaped pieces requires a DC 20

Craft (armorsmithing) check.

Once the body is  nished, the creator of a force golem

must lure an elemental spirit from the Elemental Plane of

Earth. The spirit agrees to obey the creator in exchange for

being able to remain sentient, and the creator bonds the

spirit with the golem body. When the bonding process is

complete, the elemental spirit warps and shapes the body to

its own liking.

CL 12th; Craft Construct, animate objects, contact other plane,

lesser planar binding, caster must be at least 12th level; Price

50,000 gp; Cost 29,250 gp + 2,000 XP.

Force Golems in Eberron

The process of creating a force golem is different from

that of creating golems that contain bound elementals, but

some believe that force golems represent an advancement

in  elemental  binding.  Artificers  of  House  Cannith  are

rumored to pay for information leading to the discovery of

force golems in unaf liated hands, lending some credence

to these rumors.

Though force golems are merely elemental spirits bound

into an arti cial body, they display a level of awareness similar

to that of living constructs. As a result, numerous warforged

are curious about these golems, seeing them as kindred

spirits. A few warforged, however, distrust force golems.

Force Golems in Faern

Though not unheard of in Faern, force golems are exceed-

ingly rare. More than few arcane spellcasters are distrustful

of constructs that have such a high degree of sentience and

autonomy, and a lot of wizard organizations forbid their

members from creating such creatures. Perhaps the fear

of rebellious constructs overrides arcane creativity in this

case. Despite these generalities, the Red Wizards of Thay

are known to use force golems as guardians for their most

Overlapping plates of gleaming metal cover the body of this human-

oid  gure, the air around it rippling where it radiates heat. As the

creature moves, you see what appears to be molten rock  owing

between the gaps of its armor.

Shattered Armor (Ex) When a magmacore golem is reduced

to half of its full normal hit points or fewer, its outer

armored layer shatters to expose the creatures molten

core. The magmacore golems statistics change as

follows:

The creatures natural armor bonus to AC is reduced

to +1, decreasing its AC by 7.

It gains concealment as if under a permanent blur

effect.

It loses its damage reduction 5/adamantine.

Any creature that touches or makes a melee attack

against the golem takes 1d4 points of fire damage.

Volcanic Death Throes (Su) When destroyed, a magmacore

golem releases one last blast of molten energy. The

square occupied by the magmacore golem and all

adjacent squares become molten as if affected by the

molten step ability.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A magmacore golem is immune to

any spell or spell-like effect that allows spell resistance.

However, any spell or effect that deals cold damage deals

normal damage to a magmacore golem.

Molten Step (Su) As a swift action, once every 3 rounds, a

magmacore golem can infuse its essence into any two

adjacent squares. These squares explode into molten

flame for 2 minutes. Molten squares cost 2 squares of

movement to enter, and creatures cant run or charge

across them. Any creature passing through a molten

square takes 1d6 points of fire damage.

If 10 or more points of cold damage are directed at

a molten square, it returns to normal. Affected squares

cool immediately when the effect ends, but they retain a

blasted and burned appearance.

A magmacore golem is a humanoid-shaped construct crafted

from molten rock and surrounded by an armored shell. It is

a strange amalgamation of  re and earth.

Strategies and Tactics

Due to the blending of  re and earth elemental spirits with-

in it, a magmacore golem is  erce and charges headlong into

battle. It uses its molten step ability to create patches of mol-

ten ground, preventing opponents from easily  anking it.

If possible, a magmacore golem also cuts off poten-

tial melee opponents by creating patches of molten

ground in their path, forcing them to take  re

damage in order to close to melee range.

When  fighting  alongside  others  of

their  kind,  magmacore  golems  are

particularly deadly. They use their

molten step ability to create a treach-

erous battle eld for foes that can be

harmed by  re.

Having no sense of self-preservation,

magmacore golems  ght until destroyed.

Sample Encounters

Magmacore golems serve as watchers and

guardians. Less of a threat individually than

other golems, they often appear in gangs

or in groups with other constructs.

Lone Guardian (EL 4): A magmacore

golem guards the entrance to a ruined

mine where a valuable magic relic is

hidden.  The  magmacore  golem

initially reserves its molten step

ability, drawing intruders

into  the  mines  narrow

passages. It then hedges

them in with patches of

molten stone.

Fire and Force (EL

68):  Magmacore

golems are some-

times paired with

force golems (see

above). The force

golem can com-

mand  the  magmacore  golems,  and  the  creatures  combine

their abilities for maximum effect.

Magmacore golem

EL 7: A force golem and two magmacore golems stand guard

over the tomb of an ancient sorcerer. When they engage

intruders, the force golem uses its kinetic abilities to push

enemies toward squares affected by molten step.

Ecology

A magmacore golem is created when an arcane spellcaster

binds a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth into a

construct body, then draws another spirit from the Elemental

Plane of Fire to create the golems molten core. The pairing of

these spirits makes magmacore golems more readily violent

than other similar constructs.

Environment:  Magmacore  golems  can  be  found  any-

where, though they work best in areas where they can use

their ability to turn their surroundings molten. As such, these

creatures are typically deployed in locations where they do

not risk damaging part of a permanent structure.

Typical  Physical  Character-

istics:  Magmacore  golems  stand

roughly 6 feet tall and weigh over

2,000 pounds. Plates of their

armor  are  fused  over  a  mol-

ten rock core, and their heads

have no discernible features

except  a  smooth,  eyeless

faceplate.

Alignment: Magma-

core  golems  always

follow their masters or-

ders  without  question.

They are neutral.

GRAVEYARD SLUDGE

A writhing puddle of black and green sludge twists and squirms as

though animated by a supernatural force. Within the disgusting

liquid are the limp body parts of a variety of dead humanoids. Here

and there, chunks of  esh can be seena severed head protruding

from one side, a leg extending from the top of the creature. As the

sludge slides across the ground, human faces and hands appear to

be pressing outward from within.

Between Worlds (Su) Graveyard sludges are healed by both

cure spells and inflict spells. They take no damage from

inflict spells.

Oozespawn Zombies (Su) Whenever a creature that can

acquire the zombie template (MM 265) dies within 20

feet of a graveyard sludge, that creature rises as a zombie

1d4 rounds later. However, the graveyard sludge imparts

some of its own unique physiology to the zombie,

causing each of the zombies natural attacks to deal an

extra 1d6 points of acid damage.

Spirit Resurgence (Su) A graveyard sludge can release its

latent spiritual energy, causing the spirits trapped within

it to reach out at the sludges enemies. All adjacent

opponents must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be

subject to the effect of a fear spell for 1 round. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Vigor of the Dead (Su) A graveyard sludge possesses a great

deal of negative energy, and it can sacrifice its actions

to transfer that energy to nearby undead. As a full-round

action, a graveyard sludge can target a single adjacent

undead creature. That creature gains a +2 bonus on

saving throws, a +2 bonus on caster level checks made

when casting spells from the necromancy school, DR

5/good, and +2 turn resistance. These benefits last for

1 round.

A graveyard sludge is an ooze that forms in an area where

the remains of the dead are defiled. Its body is composed

of  a  disgusting  muck  interspersed  with  the  flesh  and

bones of corpses it has absorbed. The sludge is awash in

latent spiritual energy siphoned from devoured remains,

which  gives  viewers  the  impression  that  humanoid

creatures trapped within it are pushing out and trying

to escape.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Since graveyard sludges are mindless, they put no thought

into  their  tactics  beyond  attacking  obvious  threats.

However, graveyard sludges can sense necromancy and

negative energy, including that which animates undead,

so  they  know  when  sentient  undead  are  in  the  area.

When they sense an intelligent undead creature nearby,

graveyard sludges willingly sacrifice themselves for that

creatures benefit.

When undead creatures that can bene t from its abilities

are near, a graveyard sludge uses vigor of the dead to enhance

the most powerful creature among them. That creature usu-

ally protects the graveyard sludge as well, if only to continue

gaining the bene ts the ooze provides.

If a graveyard sludge finds itself surrounded or under

intense melee assault, it uses spirit resurgence to force

graveyard sludge retreats to a place where it can avoid fur-

ther harm. If its opponents do not  ee for some reason, the

graveyard sludge continues to  ght until destroyed.

Graveyard sludges instinctively attempt to kill dying

creatures that can gain the zombie template. The resultant

oozespawn zombies also protect the sludge.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Graveyard sludges work best when they can give

a temporary boost to undead. Though they are

sometimes encountered alone, most graveyard

sludges are found in the company of liches and

other  undead  spell-

casters,  who  prize

the oozes as living

sources  of  necro-

mantic power.

Skull  Lords

Minions  (EL  10):

A  skull  lord  (page

154) has created two

bonespurs  (page

156)  and  gathered

a  following  of  four

graveyard  sludges.

Believing  the  char-

acters have an object

it wants, the skull lord

attacks the thorp where the PCs are resting.

It first sends the graveyard sludges and bonespurs after

the villagers, creating skeletons and oozespawn zombies

in the process, hoping to draw out the characters. Adja-

cent to the skull lord at all times is one graveyard sludge,

using vigor of the dead.

ECOLOGY

Unlike most other living creatures, graveyard sludges

are not the result of reproductionthey spontaneously

spawn wherever an abundance of negative energy collects.

Desecrated graveyards, corrupted battlefields, and other

places where the dead lie improperly make perfect breed-

ing grounds for graveyard sludges. When enough negative

energy builds up, that energy coalesces in the form of a

disgusting ooze, which then proceeds to assimilate nearby

cadavers and skeletons.

Graveyard sludges have within their bodies the remains

of at least a dozen different creatures at any given time, if

not more. Surges in the energy drawn from these remains

create  ghostly  images  within  the  body  of  a  graveyard

sludge,  though  these  spiritual  manifestations  are  not

actually creatures.

A graveyard sludge feeds on the dead, but a corpse is little

more than a container for what the sludge is really after. The

sludge sucks out the remaining spiritu-

al energy inside a cadaver like a beast

sucking the marrow from a bone. As

a result, speak with dead doesnt work

on the bodies absorbed by a grave-

yard sludge.

A graveyard sludge feeds

off residual spiritual ener-

gy, and once it has gained

its nourishment, it stores the

excess. It releases this energy

by  bolstering  and  creating

undead,  or  by  invoking  fear

in its attackers.

Environment: Though

graveyard  sludges  can  go

for  long  periods  be-

tween  meals,  they

prefer to remain with-

in striking distance of

graveyards and tombs

where they can gather

more  food.  A  grave-

yard sludge seeks dark,

damp  environments

where it can rest. Since

a graveyard sludges body

is composed of muck drawn from

the soil around a grave site, these creatures

are frequently found inhabiting open graves

Typical Physical Characteristics: Graveyard sludges

resemble large piles of mud, blood, and pus. They are amor-

phous, moving by undulating their formless bodies. Random

fragments of bone and  esh protrude in all directions from

within the body of a graveyard sludge, and the slow-moving

forms of spirits constantly push outward from within the

creatures body.

Alignment: Graveyard sludges have no intelligence, no

sense of right and wrong. Though they assist evil creatures,

they do so from an instinctual compulsion. They are always

neutral.

GRAVEYARD SLUDGES IN EBERRON

Graveyard sludges roam the Mournland, absorbing spiritual

energy and gorging themselves on the remains of the dead.

From points in Karrnath, undead that serve the state or the

Blood of Vol capture sludges on the edge of Cyres corpse,

employing the oozes as bolstering pets.

It is whispered among the members of the Blood of Vol

that Vol herself sends agents to the Mournland to capture

graveyard sludges. Perhaps some of these oozes make it

to Vols lair somewhere on the island of Farlnen in the

Lhazaar Principalities.

Likewise, it gains a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls

Touch of Tiamat (Su) A greenspawn zealot can damage

living creatures with its touch attack. It can deal up to

18 points of damage per day in this way (Will DC 16

half), divided among as many touches as it chooses.

When a greenspawn zealot deals damage with its touch,

it simultaneously heals one dragon or dragonblood

creature of its choice (including itself) within 30

feet of the same amount of damage. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

A greenspawn zealot that has levels in a divine

spellcasting class and worships Tiamat can apply this

effect to inf lict spells it casts. The inf lict spell deals

normal damage, simultaneously healing a nearby

dragon or dragonblood creature the greenspawn

zealot chooses.

Greenspawn zealots are the battle captains, chaplains, and

war leaders of the spawn of Tiamat (MM4 128). They have a

natural af nity for divine magic, and many take up the path

of cleric or favored soul (Complete Divine 6). Such zealots use

their  religious  fervor  to  motivate  dragonspawn  and  other

worshipers of Tiamat.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A greenspawn zealots primary role in battle is to aid, sup-

port, and lead other dragonspawn. Its touch of Tiamat ability

allows it to harm the enemy while bolstering its allies.

Because this ability requires a touch attack, a greenspawn

zealot can use it against even heavily armored foes with a

good chance of success.

A greenspawn zealot is less effective in combat than some

other dragonspawn. As such, a zealot fighting alongside

stronger allies typically holds back while those allies engage

the enemy. Only when both sides have taken damage does a

zealot step in with touch of Tiamat or an in ict spell, hoping

to strike down a foe while simultaneously restoring an ally

to full  ghting potential.

A zealot leading weaker creatures wades into melee at the

start of the  ght. It saves its touch of Tiamat ability until it

has suffered a grievous injury, then targets a weak opponent

and heals itself. Once its touch of Tiamat is expended, a

zealot typically  ees if threatened, leaving its minions to

their fate.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Greenspawn zealots are encountered alone only when they

are stranded far from their allies, most often in the aftermath

of a defeat. At all other times, they are surrounded by other

dragonspawn.

Ambush Party (EL 6): Two greenspawn sneaks (MM4 148)

and a greenspawn zealot prowl the countryside, ambush-

ing and killing small groups of non-evil creatures. With its

heavy armor, the greenspawn zealot acts as a decoy, making

enough noise to draw enemy scouts to its location. When

the  zealot  comes  under  attack,  the  greenspawn  sneaks

spring an ambush, darting in to flank and use their sneak

attack ability.

War  Party  (EL  7):  A  greenspawn  zealot  commands  a

detachment of eight hobgoblin warriors (MM 193) and an

ogre (MM 199). The zealot cares little for the lives of its

underlings, and it is happy to sacri ce them as long as doing

so guarantees success in combat.

ECOLOGY

Unlike other spawn of Tiamat, greenspawn

zealots are intentionally created rather than

born by chance. Zealots gather eggs

from other dragonspawn, ritually

bathing them in a mixture of

Tiamats blood, the blood

of an ancient green drag-

on, and crushed emeralds

worth 200 gp. Such eggs

hatch greenspawn zealots.

Environment:  Zealots  can  be

found in any area where Tiamats will must

be enforced. Their missions require them to defend

the faith of the dragonspawn across the world and even

on other planes.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical

greenspawn  zealot  is  about  6  feet  tall  and

weighs  a  little  over  200  pounds.

Males and females are the same

size, and only a practiced eye

can tell the two apart.

Alignment:  Greenspawn

zealots are always lawful evil. Their

dedication to Tiamat is matched only

by their capacity for sadism and cru-

elty. Zealots rarely turn against

each  other,  instead  showing

the utmost devotion to

the chain of command

of  which  they  are  a

part. They focus their

efforts on destroying Tiamats enemies, as well as on un-

covering and punishing lapses in faith among the members

of her legions.

SOCIETY

Greenspawn zealots are indoctrinated in the teachings

of  Tiamat  from  a  young  age  and  shaped  into  fanatical

devotees to her cause. They are the commissars of Tiamats

legionsdefenders of the faith responsible for ensuring a

proper level of dedication and enthusiasm among the troops.

Scores also serve as higher-level of cers and warlords. Other

dragonspawn, particularly the chaotic blackspawn raiders

and redspawn arcanisses, frequently come to resent the

zealots power. However, few are willing to rise against these

chosen of Tiamat.

In some ways, greenspawn zealots are the most danger-

ous of Tiamats children. Though they lack the destructive

capability of bluespawn godslayers and the like, their place in

the hierarchy of power allows them to marshal and command

other dragonspawn against their enemies. Even a godslayer

could fall to superior numbers.

When  Tiamats  legions  launch  an  invasion,

greenspawn zealots build small monasteries and

temples  dedicated  to  her  glory  in  the  areas  the

dragon spawn have secured. These monasteries serve

as command posts and refuges for the zealots. There,

they train in the arts of war, study Tiamats holy texts, and

commune with their goddess.

Great pools of swirling energy occupy the

lowest levels of such places. Greenspawn zeal-

ots use these to communicate

with Tiamat and her vas-

sals.  One  moment,  fire

roils from these pools; the

next,  they  might  freeze

solid,  erupt  with  bolts

of  electricity,  or  vent

plumes of acid. From the

pools, greenspawn zealots

receive  orders,  religious

edicts,  and  tidings  from

across the planes, then go

forth  to  spread  the  word

and their religion.

The  tunnels  beneath  these

monasteries also contain dungeons

that house captured opponents, mon-

sters bound for experiments or set to

be tamed as beasts of war, and renegade

dragonspawn  awaiting  execution.  The

upper floors house shrines, living

quarters, and classrooms where

greenspawn zealots study mat-

ters of faith and practice their

combat skills.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Greenspawn zealots covet light, portable forms of wealth

such as gems and jewelry. They also actively seek out magic

items, hoping to deny them to the enemy even as such objects

are turned to Tiamats cause. They have standard treasure

for their Challenge Rating, and they equip themselves as

NPCs of their CR when they gain class levels.

GREENSPAWN ZEALOTS

WITH CLASS LEVELS

Greenspawn zealots are devoted to the faith of Tiamat, and

they usually become divine spellcasters. Their favored class

is favored soul from Complete Divine. If you do not use that

book, use cleric as the favored class. Both classes are associ-

ated for a greenspawn zealot.

opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot

react to trip the guulvorg.

Horrifying lupine monstrosities bred for war, guulvorgs are

the pride of the hobgoblin war machine. Their name means

war worg in Goblin.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Guulvorgs are cunning, tracking their quarry, guessing at

their destination, and waylaying them along the path. They

charge into melee and then go to work with their vicious

jaws and powerful tail. Intelligent enough to take out one foe

before paying attention to another, guulvorgs are still easily

distracted by opponents that hurt them, focusing their ire

on such adversaries. These lupines are not fools, though, and

they retreat if they are losing a  ght. They then bide their

time to make a decisive blow when their opponents are at

a disadvantage.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Guulvorgs are so large and gluttonous that they dont con-

gregate in groups larger than a mated pair in the wild. They

are most numerous in goblinoid lands, where domesticated

guulvorgs might be found in larger groups. Enough guulvorgs

exist, however, that a few menace civilized realms. Regions

plagued by these terrifying monstrosities offer a hefty bounty

for the destruction of one.

Coils and Fangs (EL 14): While journeying through

a dreary forest of enormous ancient trees, the characters

discern the sounds of a tremendous fray nearby. Closing,

they spot a guulvorg and a purple worm (MM 211) locked

in furious battle, uprooting the trees about them in their

chaotic struggle. Starving due to a lava vent that wiped

out  its  supply  of  underground  prey,  the  purple  worm

attacked the guulvorg out of desperate hunger. As soon

as it senses the PCs, the purple worm turns to them as

easier prey. The guulvorg retreats into the woods, lurking

casually nearby and waiting to finish off survivors of the

purple worms attack. If the guulvorg is pulled into the

battle before the purple worm dies, this encounter has

an EL of 15.

ECOLOGY

No doubt the work of a goblinoid transmuter with too much

time on his hands and too little sanity in his head, guulvorgs

are not natural creatures. The  rst guulvorgs appeared only

recently in goblinoid realms. Despite their magical origin,

these massive lupines bred true, and a few have escaped into

the wild.

GUULVORG LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (nature) can learn

more about guulvorgs. When a character makes a successful

skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the infor-

mation from lower DCs.

Knowledge (Nature)

DC  Result

23  Guulvorgs are magical beasts that are related to

and as smart as worgs. These creatures are among

the largest wol ike monsters in existence. Their

fangs are oversized even for their huge mouths.

28  A guulvorgs tail ends in a huge bulb of hardened

bone, and the beast can use this tail extremely

quickly in battle.

33  Protecting it from  re and making it immune to

cold, a guulvorgs blood runs boiling hot. If the

creature is wounded, which is hard to do without

magic weapons, its blood scalds its attacker.

Like worgs, guulvorgs are baleful wolf-

like creatures with cunning minds and

malicious dispositions. A guulvorg has an

incredibly high metabolism, its body giving

off a great amount of heat and requiring an

enormous quantity of food. A wild guulvorg

is always on the hunt, and it eats every part

of its kill.

Fortunately  for  good-hearted  folk,

guulvorgs reproduce slowly and age

quickly.  In  the  wild,  numerous

adult guulvorgs starve in the pro-

cess  of  breeding  and  caring  for

their single pup. A newborn pup

is the size of a normal worg, but its

voracious eating allows it to grow

quickly, reaching adult size within six

months. A guulvorg continues to grow

during its life, the oldest reaching Gargan-

tuan size. But few live that long, dying before

they reach  fteen years of age. None live to

see their early twenties.

Environment: Guulvorgs prefer old tem-

perate forests where towering trees mask

their enormity. Within their forest homes, they

create a complex system of trails that makes it hard to track

them despite their size. The tracks on the trails are convo-

luted and run over many times by the same creature. Those

tracking a guulvorg in its home territory get no bonus due

to the creatures size.

Typical Physical Characteristics: One of the largest

lupine creatures in existence, the average guulvorg out-

classes even the most tremendous dire wolves. They are

usually 15 to 20 feet long. Reports of older males reaching

40 feet in length and standing 20 feet at the shoulder have

been confirmed.

Guulvorgs look like outsized worgs. They have gray or

black pelts and lupine features. Their unnatural attributes

begin with the spurs of bone that jut from the creatures

pelt and continue with the monsters glowing red eyes.

The guulvorgs aberrant features continue with its enor-

mous fangs, which resemble scythe blades. These teeth

are too large for the guulvorgs maw and jut outward along

the gums and snout.

Another oddity is the guulvorgs tail. Long and sinewy, it

ends in a bulb of bone. It has a complex nervous system and

musculature, allowing the guulvorg to wield it with remark-

able speed and power.

Alignment:  Though  possessed  of  impressive  physical

might and considerable intelligence for a beast, guulvorgs

are  still  animalistic.  Guulvorgs  torment  their  prey  before

the kill, and they have no mercy or empathy in them. They

are usually neutral evil.

Guulvorg

SOCIETY

Created by goblinoids, guulvorgs are still tied to that human-

oid subtype. Hobgoblins maintain guulvorgs as cruel siege

beasts that can clean the battlefield of its dead and keep

moving. Even the richest goblinoid kings can afford to main-

tain only a few guulvorgs in peacetime. A few simply allow

loyal guulvorgs to hunt and return home at their leisure.

Guulvorgs are highly territorial, and they obsessively

defend their domains from one another and other encroach-

ers. They willingly share territory with a single mate and

worgs, treating these lesser lupine monstrosities as pups to

be protected. A goblinoid settlement in which a domesticated

guulvorg lives is also that guulvorgs territory, so the guulvorg

defends the community  ercely.

Guulvorgs mate for life. Only if a guulvorgs mate dies

does that guulvorg seek another. Although guulvorgs are

nasty toward most other creatures, they are doting and self-

sacri cing parents. Young guulvorgs are vicious by nature,

and they learn further brutality by watching their parents.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Guulvorgs have little use for treasure, but their lairs are

littered with the goods carried by their victims. They have

10% of the coins, 50% of the goods, and 50% of the items that

would be standard treasure for their Challenge Rating. A

guulvorgs master is likely to have more treasure than usual,

since the guulvorg makes the master more able to kill and

collect valuables from the fallen.

HAUNT

Haunts are spirits that left un nished business in life and

have returned to seek recompense. Victims of injustice,

haunts have no qualms about causing others to suffer as

its grim state.

Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated,

can sense the unnatural presence of a bridge haunt at

a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach

nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain

panicked as long as they are within range.

Rejuvenation (Su) A bridge haunt cannot be permanently

destroyed through combat. The destroyed spirit

restores itself and returns to the bridge it haunts in

1d4 days. Taking a haunt more than 1,000 feet from its

bridge can destroy it, as can destroying a haunts bridge.

A bridge haunt is laid to rest by taking a piece of the

corporeal remains of its former body, or a possession

important to it in life, and delivering that item to the

place where the creature that became the haunt was

headed before its demise.

Push (Su) A creature damaged by a bridge haunts

incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 20

Will save or be telekinetically pushed 10 feet away from

the creature. If a bridge haunt makes a full attack, it

78

can attack a single creature with both touch attacks,

resolving the push after it is determined if both attacks

deal damage. If both attacks deal damage, the creature

must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be pushed 20 feet

away. Movement from a push does not provoke attacks of

opportunity.

Bridge Dependent (Ex) Each bridge haunt is mystically

bound to a single bridge and cannot stray more than

1,000 feet from it. If somehow forced to do so, a bridge

haunt is instantly destroyed.

Living Visage (Ex) A bridge haunt seems to be corporeal and

alive until it flies or attacks, when it becomes partially

transparent and appears as the rotting corpse of the

person it was in life.

A bridge haunt is a ghostly undead that lingers near the

bridge  where  it  came  into  being  after  the  death  of  the

living  creature  it  once  was.  Embittered  and  vengeful,

bridge haunts come in many forms, but all have the same

irrational and murderous intent: They seek to lure others

to their deaths.

Strategies and Tactics

Bridge haunts lure their victims into vulnerable positions

in numerous ways. A haunt can use mirage arcana either to

make its bridge look more or less stable than it truly is, or

to make the terrain below appear more or less dangerous.

A bridge haunt uses mass suggestion only if it must, since

it prefers unwitting victims. It can use the spell to cause a

whole group to stumble into danger or to prevent the remain-

der of the group from coming to a single members aid. In

combat, a bridge haunt attacks with its incorporeal touch

This is a bridge haunt, the incorporeal spirit of

someone who died at this bridge.

In combat, a bridge haunt can push its opponents

off the bridge. Its incorporeal touch also disrupts

 esh.

27  Masters of deception through magical trickery,

bridge haunts can change the appearance of their

bridge or nearby terrain. They can make their

words seem true to all who hear them.

32  A bridge haunt can be destroyed only if it is

moved more than 1,000 feet from its bridge, if

its bridge is destroyed, or if a piece of its former

body is delivered to the location to which it was

traveling when it died. Otherwise, it returns in a

attacks, hoping to push foes off the bridge if doing so can

result in a deadly fall. It does the same to continually push

a foe deeper beneath the water near a bridge that crosses a

river or deep creek.

Sample Encounters

A bridge haunt seeks to cause deaths in the manner it was

killed and prevent others from reaching their destinations

across the bridge. Bridge haunts appear as they did in life,

so their shapes and the means by which they lure victims

vary greatly.

Because  each  bridge  haunt  is  tied  to  a

bridge, and each has a different reason for

being there,  nding more than one bridge

haunt  at  a  location  is  extremely  rare.

However, if two or more people were

emotionally bound to one another,

were traveling to the same place,

and died near a bridge in a simi-

lar  manner,  this  can  cause  more

than one bridge haunt to linger at

a single bridge.

The Bride (EL 7): Lanara, an elf

maiden in a beautiful dress, sings

a  mournful  song  as  she  walks

along  the  riverbank.  When

someone  hails  her,  she  seems

startled  and  scared,  and  she

runs  under  a  nearby  bridge

to hide. Suddenly, a terri ed

scream comes from beneath

the bridge, then is cut off

by  a  strangling  sound.

Elves or females of any

race who investigate

find  Lanara  wait-

ing  to  push  them

beneath  the  water

to drown.

Lanara was murdered

on her wedding day by thugs

sent  by  her  husband-to-be  so  he

could marry another. She can be perma-

nently destroyed only by  nding her wedding ring in the

mud beneath the bridge and bringing it to her once- anc,

or by bringing him to her.

The Wrestler (EL 7): Thaven Firehammer, a dwarf paladin

of Kord, challenges warriors who wish to cross his bridge

across a mountain chasm. He awaits victims at the middle

of the bridge and offers a friendly challenge to one person

in the group: a wrestling match. If he wins, they cannot

cross. If he loses, he offers his full plate armor and weapon

in addition to passage. He seems to lack a weapon, but he

says he left his axe on the other side of the bridge. Anyone

who takes his offer or tries to pass him suffers his wrath

as he tries to push that person off the bridge. Once he has

succeeded, Thaven moves inside the bridge until someone

else comes along.

To free Thaven and end his deadly game, the PCs must

 nd his bones in the rocky vale below the bridge and bring

them to the temple of Kord in the mountains. Alternatively,

they can seek his magic axe, taken from him by the man who

pushed him off the bridge during what was supposed to be

a friendly challenge, and return it to the side of the bridge

where Thaven left it when he wrestled his foe.

The Fisher and the Serpent (EL 8): Cedrik, a young

human boy with a  shing pole and  sh basket, used to

come to the river to  sh all the time. He would bal-

ance on the railing of the bridge to cross, rather

than walk the boards. One day he slipped, and

a  giant  constrictor  snake  (MM  280)  living

under the bridge made short work of him.

When people approach the bridge, Ce-

drik uses mirage arcana to make the

railings look solid and the bridge

itself shoddy. Then he encourag-

es travelers to balance along

the railingthey can even

follow  him  across  if  they

like.  When  someone  has

reached the center, Cedrik

pushes  that  person  off

the  bridge into the wait-

ing coils of the snake.

Ecology

Bridge haunts have lit-

tle effect on the nearby

ecology, but they do pos-

sess  an  ecology  of  sorts  in

their choice of prey and the frequency of their attacks. Many

bridge haunts seem content to set upon anyone who wanders

their way, while others show a preference for certain types of

victims. Some bridge haunts linger near their bridges con-

tinually, while others rest inside the structure of the bridge,

emerging on certain nights or at particular times during the

day. Each bridge haunt has its own habits, so discovering its

patterns requires observation.

Environment: A bridge haunt can exist at a bridge in any

environment. Unless an appealing target is nearby, the haunt

doesnt leave its bridge.

79

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Bridge  haunts  have

the height and appearance they possessed in life. Being

incorporeal, they are weightless.

Alignment:  Bridge  haunts  are  usually  neutral  evil,

but some are chaotic or lawful if they possessed strong

tendencies toward one or the other of those alignments

in life. Good bridge haunts are unheard of, but neutral

haunts do exist.

Neutral  bridge  haunts  attempt  to  keep  people  away

from their bridges, scaring them away or warning them

off. To those who show sympathy, such haunts relate how

they can be freed to go to their eternal rest. Still, even a

neutral bridge haunt is compelled to kill those who try

to cross its bridge.

Typical Treasure

Bridge haunts cannot manipulate treasure, nor do they typi-

cally show any desire to possess it. Nevertheless, a bridge

haunts victims often bore items that become lost beneath the

bridge, awaiting discovery by any brave enough to confront

the  structures  undead  inhabitant.  The  items  beneath  the

bridge are equivalent to standard treasure for a creature of

Arboreal Vengeance (Su) A forest haunt can temporarily

animate trees and undergrowth around it. When it

activates this ability, each tree within 60 feet makes

a melee attack against the nearest enemy. Trees have

a reach of 20 feet. Each attack is made with a +9

bonus and deals 2d6+4 points of damage. In addition,

undergrowth within 60 feet begins to writhe and grasp

at creatures in the area. Any creature attempting to

move out of a space containing undergrowth must

succeed on a DC 21 Reflex save or be entangled for

1 round. The attack bonus, damage bonus, and save

DC are Charisma-based.

Rejuvenation A forest haunt is not destroyed if reduced to 0

hit points. It instead reappears in its grove 1d4 days later.

Each forest haunt has a specific condition that must be

fulfilled to lay it to rest.

Forest haunts are the spirits of fey-touched trees that seek

vengeance on intruders within their forest domain. When

a dryad is killed, she can curse those who slew her with her

dying breath. This curse fuels the spirit of the oak to which

she is tied, causing it to stalk the forest until her killers are

slain, and sometimes beyond.

Strategies and Tactics

A forest haunt silently approaches enemies, staying within

the  cover  of  trees  to  avoid  being  noticed.  Even  if  it  is

seen, it is typically mistaken for a trick of the light or a

play of shadow in the forest. Once it is in range, it uses

arboreal vengeance to batter foes that stand near trees.

If  an  opponent  spots  the  forest  haunt,  the  haunt  tries

to  intimidate  that  foe  with  Daunting  Presence,  while

staying close to other trees so that opponents must come

into range of the trees attacks if they wish to fight the

haunt directly. It uses its touch attack only if it is severely

damaged. Since it knows it can rejuvenate, a forest haunt

fights until destroyed.

larger  than  four  are

unheard of.

Orc  Murderers

(EL 10): A group of

trappers  has  been

missing  for  several

days, and the trail leads

into  a  dark,  forbidding

part of a nearby wood. A

forest haunt rampages in the

deepest part of the wood, where

trees are thick and the ground is

covered in underbrush.

The dryad that once lived in the

wood was killed by a group of orc

marauders, and the orc shaman now

uses her bones for fortune-telling.

The marauders consist of six orc

berserkers (MM4 114) and a 4th-

level orc druid. This encounter is

EL 10, but PCs can also attempt

to negotiate for the dryads bones

or steal them.

Only by retrieving the bones and return-

ing them to the dryads grove can the PCs put the forest haunt

to rest. Of course, they have to deal with an irate forest haunt

on the way to the grove.

Ecology

Forest haunts are subject to outbursts of rage as they try

to cope with the loss of their dryad companions. Thus,

although  a  forest  haunt  coexists  with  natural  flora,  it

tends to drive away or accidentally kill most wildlife. A

recently awakened forest haunt causes a steady migration

away from its grove, a clear indication that something is

wrong. The area roamed by a forest haunt might eventu-

ally begin to change. As the unnatural aura of the haunt

bleeds into the surrounding terrain, it turns the foliage a

darkalmost blackgreen and causes trees to warp into

unsettling shapes.

A forest haunt can be destroyed only by meeting a par-

ticular condition. This condition can range from returning

the body of its dryad to her grove, to defeating an evil power

at work in the forest, to destroying the tree from which the

forest haunt sprang.

Environment: Forest haunts are found exclusively in

forests. A forest haunt roams throughout the forest as though

on patrol, but returns to its dryads grove at least once every

day. Some roam during the night and some

during  the  daytime.  Chaotic  forest

haunts vary this pattern, but neutral

haunts are more predictable.

Typical Physical Char-

acteristics:  A  forest  haunt

appears to be a deformed,

translucent  tree,  with  a

trunk nearly 5 feet wide

and a span of branches

greater than 20 feet. It

has  veins  of  violet  sap

running along its trunk.

Alignment:  A  forest

haunt  is  interested  in  noth-

ing but the destruction of the

living, and most are difficult to

reason  with.  Forest  haunts  are

usually  neutral  evil  or  chaotic

evil, though some are neutral (es-

pecially those whose dryads were

especially  sympathetic  toward  hu-

mans and other civilized intruders).

Non-evil forest haunts are likely to

try to scare off invaders instead of

killing them outright.

Forest haunt

Typical Treasure

Though a forest haunt doesnt care for

wealth, the area it roams might be littered

with the gear of those who did not escape

its wrath. Such treasure is usually the arms, armor, or other

equipment associated with would-be heroes. The scattered

treasure can also serve as a warning to any who would enter

the  forest  haunts  domain.  Such  items  add  up  to  standard

treasure for the forest haunts Challenge Rating.

Encore (Ex) Fueled by anger and bitterness, a taunting haunt

is difficult to send to its final rest. A taunting haunt that

is destroyed by any means returns to existence after 24

hours. These creatures can be driven away only when

defeated in a battle of wits or put to rest only when their

final wishes are met (see below).

Tripping Tongue (Su) A taunting haunt can force an

opponent to speak the opposite of an intended

statement. An entreaty for peace becomes a challenge

to battle. A friendly greeting becomes an insulting

threat. Three times per day, as an immediate action, a

taunting haunt can attempt to reverse an opponents

intended words. If that foe succeeds on a DC 15 Will

save, this ability has no effect. Anyone listening to

a creature affected by this ability can make a DC 15

misses with an attack, a taunting haunt can, as an

immediate action, deliver a short, scathing commentary

on that foes competence (or lack thereof). The subject

must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take a 2 penalty

on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 1

round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Font of Knowledge (Ex) A taunting haunt is considered to

be trained in all Knowledge skills and to have maximum

ranks in those skills.

A taunting haunt is the twisted, jealous spirit of a deceased

bard, jester, or other performer. Bitter and angry, and resent-

ful of the living, a taunting haunt uses its sharp wit, cruel

humor, and spiteful performances to create havoc and chaos

wherever it goes.

Taunting haunts pose a minimal physical threat, yet they

are dreaded by almost anyone unfortunate enough to encoun-

ter them. With their biting sense of humor and relentless

spirit, they can prove more dif cult to handle than foes in a

stand-up  ght.

Strategies and Tactics

A taunting haunt exists to spread misery, anger, and con-

fusion. In life, it used its talents to bring happiness and

amusement to others. In death, this desire has warped into

a compulsion to make others miserable. Taunting haunts

use a variety of schemes to humiliate the foolish, trusting,

or greedy.

A typical taunting haunt picks out an important  gure for

continual harassment. The haunt introduces itself, insults

its mark, and uses its Perform (comedy) skill to poke fun.

It follows its target, offering running commentary on that

persons ineptitude.

Not a murderous spirit, a taunting haunt takes care to avoid

killing anyone. After all, a corpse cant wince at a barbed

comment or provide endless amusement as it tries to muddle

through negotiations while its words are being twisted.

A taunting haunt might even help particularly enjoyable

victims of its torments stay alive.

TAUNTING HAUNT LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (religion) or who

have the bardic knowledge class feature can learn more about

taunting haunts. When a character makes a successful check,

the following lore is revealed, including the information from

lower DCs. A bard gains a +4 bonus on this check.

This is a taunting haunt, the bitter spirit of a

troubadour, jester, or bard. This result reveals all

undead traits and incorporeal traits.

19  When a taunting haunt decides to shadow a

victim, it can cause that person to speak the

opposite of what is intended.

Taunting haunts are expert liars. Never believe

what one says unless you defeat it in a battle of

wits.

29  A taunting haunt can be defeated only if it

loses a battle of wits or its  nal wishes are met.

Otherwise, it returns within a day.

Taunting haunts are roleplaying challenges. They can

prove annoying, but they lack attacks or abilities to directly

kill.  Their  immortal  nature  and  access  to  Knowledge

skills makes them useful sources of (perhaps unreliable)

information.

Each taunting haunt is an individual with a distinct

often warped or crazypersonality. A haunt might take a

liking to a PC, egg on another one with taunts, and needle

another with endless pranks. In the hands of a skilled DM,

a haunt becomes a foil for the characters. With good

roleplaying and quick thinking, PCs can turn a

taunting haunt into a useful informant or even

an ally.

A  taunting  haunt  can  go  to

its  final  rest  if  someone  re-

solves  whatever  caused

it to become undead. A

wandering bard killed

by a cruel tyrant might

pass on if a party over-

throws  the  tyrants

descendants.

Sample Encounter

Taunting  haunts  do  not

travel in groups. The only

time  a  taunting  haunt  is

seen  with  other  creatures

is when it is being a nuisance

to them.

The  Staff  of  the  Sewers  (EL

4): Bertrose Bignose was a jester who

was  killed  for  making  one  joke  too

many at the expense of a visiting

archmage. He uses his abili-

ties  to  make  spellcasters

look foolish, particularly

in  front  of  superiors  or

allies. If possible, he uses

glibness to convince spellcasters

he is a friendly spirit who knows the location of a lost magic

staff. Invariably, this staff is supposedly hidden at the bottom

of a garbage dump or outhouse pit. More than one greedy

wizard has ended up knee deep in sewage before Bertrose

revealed his lie.

Ecology

Taunting haunts add nothing to the local ecosystem except

cruel humor, practical jokes, and humiliating schemes.

Environment: Taunting haunts can thrive anywhere,

but they prefer civilized areas. Those that used to live

in cities can usually  nd easy targets there. They are

seldom found in the wilderness.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Taunting

haunts are humanoid in appearance.

They wear outrageous or ostentatious

clothes to draw attention to themselves.

Though the taunting haunt in this

entry is Medium, gnomes and oth-

er Small creatures can also become

taunting haunts.

Alignment:  More  mischie-

vous than malicious, most taunting

haunts cant be considered evil. How-

ever, exceptions exist, and some

taunting haunts are even good-

aligned.  They  are,  without

exception, chaotic.

Typical Treasure

A  taunting  haunt  requires

anyone it defeats in a battle of

wits to bury all treasure wagered

on the outcome in an isolated spot.

These  haunts  have  no  use  for

treasure, but since mortals love

gold and magic items, taunting

haunts do what they can to remove

such wealth from circulation.

Taunting haunt

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

A BATTLE OF WITS

The only way to defeat a taunting haunt is in a battle of wits.

Usually, a victim gets rid of a haunt when it grows bored and

moves  on  to  a  new  audience.  Adventurers  who  turn  or  de-

stroy  the  spirit  win  the  honor  of  a  repeat  performance  soon

thereafter.

A battle of wits with a taunting haunt involves riddles, jokes,

and other competitions. In game terms, the haunt and its op-

ponent  take  turns  choosing  Knowledge  and  Perform  skills,

then make opposed checks involving the chosen skill. The first

person to win three checks wins the competition.

A haunt expects a magic item worth 500 gp from the PCs if

it wins. If the characters win, the haunt leads them to a hidden

treasure with a value appropriate to its CR and agrees to leave

them alone.

When  resolving  a  battle  of  wits,  you  can  replace  the  skill

checks with riddles and questions for an interesting roleplaying

encounter. Regardless of how you handle the battle, the PCs

should gain experience points for defeating a taunting haunt

whether they drive it off, send it against someone else, or oth-

erwise remove it as an annoyance.

HOBGOBLIN

Hobgoblins  are  brutal  and  disciplined  evil  humanoids

that form highly organized, conquest-driven kingdoms.

They  also  willingly  serve  as  mercenaries  for  other  evil

creatures.

This section presents four sample members of hobgoblin

society and expands on the social order of these creatures.

Hobgoblins  are  so  ruthless  in  their  training  that  the

process alters their bodies. The results are nothing short

of monstrous.

Hobgoblin  traits  are  summarized  on  page  154  of  the

Monster Manual.

HOBGOBLIN DUSKBLADE

A hobgoblin clad in a chain shirt marches toward you. He holds his

longsword out threateningly, and his shield is covered in runes.

Arcane Channeling (Su) A hobgoblin duskblade can cast

and deliver any touch spell he knows with a melee

attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard

action or less. Casting a spell in this manner does not

provoke attacks of opportunity. If he hits, the hobgoblin

duskblade deals normal weapon damage, then resolves

the spells effect on the struck creature.

Armored Mage (Ex) A hobgoblin duskblade does not have an

arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor and

carrying a light shield.

Hobgoblin duskblades are skilled warriors who learn to

combine  armed  fighting  and  spellcasting.  Ages  ago,  a

mighty hobgoblin wizard named Tartak Firehand stole

such techniques from his elf enemies. Now a large number

of hobgoblin tribes use duskblades to support wizards and

sorcerers in battle.

The duskblade presented here had the following ability

scores before racial ability score adjustments: Str 15, Dex 12,

Con 14, Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

Before engaging, hobgoblin duskblades use ray of enfeeble-

ment  to  soften  up  the  enemy.  They  then  enter  melee

and use arcane channeling to imbue their attacks with

shocking grasp, acid splash, or ray of frost. Burning hands is

reserved for tight situations when one hobgoblin dusk-

blade endangers few or none of his comrades by casting

the 15-foot cone.

If  theyre  weakening  an  enemy  for  subsequent  magical

attack by other arcane casters, hobgoblin duskblades or the

spellcasters they support delay or ready their actions in melee

so that they act on consecutive initiative counts, preventing

the enemy from taking action to foil their combined attacks.

Hobgoblin duskblades use touch of fatigue and Battle Magic

Tactics with their melee attacks. They then cast swift expedi-

tious retreat to retreat beyond the blast radius of area spells

cast by more powerful spellcasters.

NEW FEAT:

BATTLE MAGIC TACTICS

Through intense training and impeccable timing, you and your

allies learn to augment each others magical attacks when you

focus your efforts on a single target.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 6 ranks, arcane caster level 3rd.

Benefit: Each time you cast a spell that requires the target to

make a saving throw, that target gains a Battle Magic Tactics

token  after  the  spell  resolves.  A  creature  gains  a  token

whether the save succeeds or fails, but a creature that avoids

a spell through spell resistance does not gain a token. Each

Battle Magic Tactics token imposes a cumulative 1 penalty

on saving throws against the spells of spellcasters that have

this feat. At the end of each round, all Battle Magic Tactics

tokens disappear.

Spellscourges are elite soldiers. They undergo intensive

training, daily exposure to spells, and cruel rituals, granting

them special defenses against magic. In war, spellscourges

race forward to slay enemy spellcasters. When rivalries

among hobgoblin mages turn violent, spellscourges serve

as choice assassins.

Strategies and Tactics

A spellscourge engages spellcasters, particularly lightly

armored or unarmored ones, shutting them down in a wide

area using his spiked chain. He uses Mobility and Tumble

to get into position to accomplish this goal.

Hobgoblin spellcasters arent afraid to throw weak area

spells into enemies that have spellscourges among them,

counting on the spellscourges defenses to resist the spell. The

spell damages opponents while augmenting the spellscourges

through their spell eater ability.

Hobgoblin Spellscourges as Characters

Hobgoblin  spellscourges  are  elite  creatures  that  have  the

racial characteristics of hobgoblins, along with the abilities

granted  by  their  grueling  ritualistic  training.  The  typical

spellscourge  advances  as  a   ghter,  but  some  tribes  train

barbarians or monks with these abilities. Spellscourges often

enter the occult slayer prestige class (Complete Warrior 66).

Pillar of Magic (Su) Once per day, a hobgoblin warcaster can

grant all goblinoids within 30 feet spell resistance 14 for

1 minute.

Arcane Talent (Ex) A warcaster casts spells as a 4th-level

wizard.

Warcasters are elite casters trained speci cally for warfare.

The most promising young hobgoblin arcane casters endure a

grueling series of rituals and tests that slowly warp and alter

their bodies. Scores of hobgoblins exposed to this regimen

die hideous deaths, but those who survive become potent

spellcasters with magic in their veins.

Warcasters are the lowest-ranking products of this process.

They consider those who gained arcane skill through study

rather than ritual transformation to be lesser beings. When

a hobgoblin army marches to war, the warcasters provide

artillery support. They also work with spellscourges and

duskblades to target and destroy enemy spellcasters.

Strategies and Tactics

Warcasters use false life to fortify themselves before a battle

begins. Just prior to engaging the enemy, they use shield to

defend themselves while the spellscourges and duskblades they

lead move into position. Warcasters are acutely aware that they

have no more than four or  ve spells to contribute to a  ght, so

they hold back until theyve gauged their opponents defenses.

They unleash their magic with precision against targets that

duskblades have set up with the Battle Magic Tactics feat.

A warcaster targets an area, preferably where duskblades

have softened up the enemy, with web. He then rolls a  aming

sphere into trapped creatures, dealing more damage in the

process as the  re interacts with the magical webbing. He

uses magic missile to  nish off those who look badly injured,

then casts expeditious retreat to leave the battle eld.

Hobgoblin Warcasters as Characters

All hobgoblin warcasters are elite creatures that have the

racial characteristics of hobgoblins, as well as the abilities

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

MONSTROUS HUMANOID

(GOBLINOID)

The gruesome rituals and training that some of the hobgob-

lins in this entry go through changes their type to monstrous

humanoid. This means theyre immune to abilities that affect

only humanoids. However, abilities that affect creatures with

the goblinoid subtype still affect these creatures despite their

new  type.  So  a  ranger  who  has  humanoid  (goblinoid)  as  a

favored enemy still receives the bonuses that ability provides

when  using  it  against  the  monstrous  humanoid  goblinoids

presented here.

granted by their torturous upbringing. However, hobgoblin

warcasters favor the wizard class. A hobgoblin warcasters

wizard levels stack with his Hit Dice to determine spells per

day and spells contained in his spellbook. No class except

wizard is considered associated for a hobgoblin warcaster.

Level Adjustment: +3.

Soul Tyrant (Su) As a swift action, a warsoul can draw arcane

power from a willing hobgoblin within 30 feet who has 10

or fewer hit points. That hobgoblin is immediately slain,

leaving behind a desiccated corpse. The warsoul heals 1

hit point per Hit Die she has, and she receives a +2 bonus

to the save DC of the next spell she casts. She also gains

a +2 bonus on any attack roll required by the next spell

she casts. If that spell deals damage, the warsoul receives

a bonus on the damage roll equal to her Hit Dice.

Arcane Talent (Ex) A warsoul casts spells as a 9th-level

wizard.

Cult of Power (Ex) A warsoul is accompanied by 2d4 1st-

level hobgoblin warriors who have sworn their lives to

her. These thralls willingly sacrifice themselves for their

masters soul tyrant ability.

Occasionally,  a  warcaster  displays  an  incredible  talent  for

spellcasting, quickly racing ahead of her peers and master-

ing  potent  spells.  As  she  endures  more  rituals  and  delves

deeper into her studies, the warcaster grows in power until

her  esh becomes little more than a withered vessel for her

soul. She even learns to consume the essence of her lessers

to augment her spells. Invariably, she comes to either lead a

tribe or die at the hands of a rival.

Strategies and Tactics

Warsouls never enter battle without several utterly loyal

minions. Such hobgoblin warriors, compelled into obedi-

ence by the warsouls great power and magnetic personality,

believe that dying in their masters name is the surest way

to attain an exalted state in the afterlife. They gladly perish

to hold back an approaching enemy or to fuel the warsouls

soul tyrant ability.

Preferring to  ght alongside duskblades, spellscourges, and

a few allied warcasters, warsouls take care to cast defensive

spells before a struggle begins. Only a truly cunning oppo-

nent can catch warsouls without their mage armor, false life,

and shield spells cast. They use haste to augment their minions

right before engaging.

A typical warsoul might use the following sequence of

actions.

Round 1: Cast web to slow down or immobilize enemy

 ghters. Warsouls prefer for their warriors to bring the battle

to the enemy.

Round 2: Cast  reball targeting the area of the web, so as

to free up the battle eld while adding damage to the normal

effect of the  reball.

Round 3: Order an attack on the toughest enemy, delay

to maximize the save penalty that target takes from allies

Battle Magic Tactics, and cast hold monster on that foe.

Round 4: Cast scorching ray to  nish off the held target.

Round 5: Cast an area spell targeting the largest group of

opponents.

If the  ght goes against the warsoul, she uses dimension

door to escape with her hide intact. If her side is losing but

she can save some of her troops, she uses wall of ice to cover

their retreat before casting dimension door.

Hobgoblin Warsouls with Class Levels

Hobgoblin warsouls are elite, and they advance as wizards.

A hobgoblin warsouls wizard levels stack with her Hit Dice

to determine spells per day and spells contained in her

spellbook. No class except wizard is considered associated

for a hobgoblin warsoul.

Level Adjustment: +4.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Hobgoblins rely on tightly coordinated, highly organized

tactics. They travel in structured groups made up of members

whose abilities work together to create a stronger whole.

Magic Marauders (EL 6): Two hobgoblin duskblades and

a warcaster form the smallest combat formation in special-

ized hobgoblin units. The duskblades act as bodyguards until

they wade into melee to weaken foes with their Battle Magic

Tactics feat.

Warsoul  Retinue  (EL  9):  A  warsoul  usually  fights

along side two duskblades, a warcaster, and a spellscourge.

In combat, this unit seeks out and slays enemy spellcasters.

The duskblades form a defensive wall for the warcaster and

the warsoul, while the spellscourge races forward to

harass or kill enemy casters. The warcaster focuses his

spells on enemy warriors, and the warsoul does the

same with her damaging spells. She uses her inca-

pacitating  spells,  such

as hold monster, on any

spellcaster  unfortunate

enough to draw the spell-

scourges attention.

ECOLOGY

Hobgoblins  are  born  predators.  Unlike  orcs  and  other

savage humanoids, hobgoblins are naturally clever and

adaptable, agile and hardy. Hobgoblins easily overcome

competing creatures when the two groups numbers are

equal or favor hobgoblins.

Although few hobgoblin societies are agricultural, hob-

goblins acquire food with little trouble through hunting,

raiding,  and  conquest,  as  well  as  by  maintaining  small

herds of livestock. They favor meat, and they can and do

eat  whatever  they  can  kill,  sometimes  including  other

sentient creatures.

Hobgoblins reproduce in the same manner as humans,

though breeding is strictly controlled in the majority of

tribes (see Society). Young hobgoblins are born nearly helpless,

but they mature more quickly than their human counter-

parts do.

Environment:  Hobgoblins  prefer  warm,  hilly  regions,

but they are second only to humans in terms of adaptability.

They can survive in almost any climate or terrain.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Hobgoblins  are

lean and tallusually over 6-1/2 feet tall and 250 pounds

and built for agility. They have orange skin that blues or

reddens near their flat noses. Coarse hair, ranging in color

from red-brown to gray, grows on their heads as well as

on their arms and legs. Male hobgoblins can grow beards,

and some even have pattern balding like males of other

humanoid races.

Alignment: Hobgoblins organize themselves

into strict hierarchies that have harsh laws, with

the mightiest and most cunning hobgoblins

at the top. But they are also murderous and

tyrannical, with little compassion or room in

their cold hearts for softer emotions. They

are usually lawful evil.

SOCIETY

Hobgoblins have a rigid, unforgiving

society  based  on  the  idea  that  con-

tinued existence depends on martial

superiority. Their hi-

erarchy is formed

88

Hobgoblin warcaster and warsoul

to place each hobgoblin within his or her appropriate social

position while supporting nearly endless war. They have

an  insatiable  thirst  for  conquest  and  dominance  over  all

other creatures.

These goblinoids have two basic modes. They either seek

to conquer their neighbors, or they gather their strength for

the next attack while making raids and feints against their

enemies. A hobgoblin tribe at peace is a tribe that is merely

between wars.

Unlike  orcs  and  other  dim-witted  evil  humanoids,

hobgoblins take a long-term, strategic view of their con-

 icts. A hobgoblin king might even strike an alliance or a

nonaggression pact with a nonhobgoblin realm that has a

tolerable ethos. Although hobgoblins thirst for conquest

and the imposition of their tyranny over all other intelligent

creatures, they recognize that their plans might require years

of continual  ghting.

To this end, hobgoblins organize into rigid castes, with

each caste charged with a speci c task. Slaves occupy the

lowest rung in hobgoblin society, followed by nonwarrior

craftsmen, religious leaders, and then warriors. Hobgoblins

are assigned to a caste based on ability and tribal needs, with

no regard for gender or personal preference.

Given this warrior ideal, success in combat is the best way to

advance to the top of the social order. Thus, even a hobgoblin

blacksmith or cleric takes up arms to earn respect from his

fellows.  Braver  hobgoblin  warriors  submit  themselves  for

brutal training and crueler rituals to toughen them for battle.

Countless hobgoblins fail to survive the process.

With regard to hobgoblin culture, the term warrior

should not be confused with nonspellcaster. Spellcasters

can be honored members of the hobgoblin hierarchy, and as

with other members of the society, those spellcasters who

succeed in battle are the most revered. In fact, hobgoblin

wizards readily subject themselves to gruseome ordeals to

steel themselves for war.

HOBGOBLIN LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (local) can learn

more about hobgoblins. When a character makes a success-

ful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the

information from lower DCs.

Knowledge (Local)

DC  Result

11  Hobgoblins are goblinoid creatures that are

stronger and better organized than their smaller

cousins.

16  Hobgoblins use coordinated tactics to defeat their

enemies. They  ank opponents, swarm around

foes, and work as a team.

21  Hobgoblins are clever, and they use magic to

twist themselves into better and more specialized

soldiers and spellcasters. Some have even become

monstrous humanoids.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

The warrior ideal doesnt mean that other castes are looked

down upon. All hobgoblin warriors recognize the need for

craftspersons, healers, and similar members of a tribe. Only

a fool would believe that the hobgoblin war machine could

function without such pieces. However, no member of a lower

caste dares defy or insult a warrior unless the lower-caste

hobgoblin wants to die.

Religious leaders are the exception to this rulelower

than warriors but able to advise and even challenge their

superiors. Most hobgoblin priests are adepts, and these

priests oversee aspects of hobgoblin life such as arranged

marriage  and  nonmilitary  instruction,  including  the

Common language. Hobgoblin children form few attach-

ments; their primary bond is usually with an adept or cleric

who  instruct  them.  Hobgoblin  despots  have  one  or  more

religious advisors who have great in uence in the tribe and

over their leader.

Individual hobgoblins are taught from birth to protect

themselves and their personal space. By extension, the

personal space of the tribe is a communal responsibility,

made up of the space occupied by each member of the tribe.

An individual hobgoblin pays attention to his surround-

ings and is always alert for opportunities or threats. The

tribe works to control its environment, dominating weaker

sentient creatures and lashing out at perceived dangers. No

room is left for emotional considerationscompassion is a

weakness, and personal freedom a potential hazard to the

tribes overall safety.

In this vein, while two hobgoblins might risk a tryst for

the sake of lust, hobgoblins dont marry for love. The priests

select those who should breed to produce the strongest off-

spring, and marriages are arranged along those lines. Other

marriages are forged to ensure alliances, shore up a position

of power, or to take power away from another hobgoblin.

Offspring are the property of their parents, instructed in

the harsh hobgoblin way of life by father, mother, and the

tribes priests.

Similarly,  adult  hobgoblins  are  the  property  of  their

superiors, and the only way to avoid the order of a superior

is to die through ritual suicide or to destroy that superior

and his or her allies. Such events are rare, however, and most

hobgoblins serve their tribe faithfully until they no longer

can. Aged and feeble hobgoblins commit ritual suicide in

a ceremony designed to honor their deity Maglubiyet and

the tribe.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Hobgoblins value usable treasure, such as equipment and

magic items, but they also collect jewelry and money. They

have  standard  treasure  for  their  Challenge  Rating.  Elite

hobgoblins usually have equipment usual for NPCs of their

Challenge Rating rather than standard treasure.

exotic truths captivate their minds. A successful save

negates the effect, but each creature in the area must

make a new saving throw at the end of each of Illuriens

affecting ability.

her. Anyone struck by this tempest lash must succeed

on a DC 25 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence

Intelligence damage she deals with this attack.

Pointed Knowledge (Su) Illurien understands all languages,

and she instantly knows facts about creatures she speaks

to telepathically, such as their age, where they were born,

and the important events of their lives.

A strange creature composed of countless tears and raindrops,

Illurien of the Myriad Glimpses is a collector of information

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Illurien engages those she meets in polite telepathic con-

versation, but this behavior is just an excuse to examine

This is Illurien of the Myriad Glimpses, a strange

creature that steals knowledge from the minds

of her victims. She is amoral and unworthy of

trust. Her home is the Concordant Domain of the

Outlands.

The cloud that surrounds Illurien can rob mortals

of their senses. Her attacks drain her targets mind

while healing Illuriens wounds. It is said that she

resides in a secret library in the Outlands known

as the Athenaeum Nefarious.

Illuriens knowledge protects her in combat, and

she is immune to disease, electricity, paralysis,

poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. She

is resistant to acid and magic and capable of

spontaneously traveling between the planes. She

can be called to a place in the Outlands referred

to as the Shrouded Dispensary, where she can be

coaxed into sharing her knowledge.

If killed, Illurien merely rejuvenates, reappearing

inside the Athenaeum Nefarious within two days.

knowledge to intimidate and threaten her opponents. If

pressed, she uses plane shift to  ee to the Athenaeum Nefari-

ous (see Environment).

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Illurien travels the planes in search of knowledge and myster-

ies to steal and keep for herself.

Mindful Murder (EL 15): Illurien has come to steal in-

formation from one of the PCs sagacious allies. She talked

with that NPC for a while, then attacked him, drained him of

intelligence, and slew him. After the murder, Illurien method-

ically inspected the slain mans organs and body parts to see

his speci c internal work-

ings. The characters

now  have  a  grisly

murder to solve, and

the  corpse,  drained

of much of its knowl-

edge, utters only the

name Illurien if ques-

tioned  with  a speak

with dead spell.

ECOLOGY

Illurien is a unique

native  of  the  Con-

cordant  Domain  of

the  Outlands.  Where

she came from and who created her,

if anyone did, is a mystery. Some suspect

she is a minion of Vecna, but Illurien, Vec-

nas clergy, and Vecna himself say nothing

on this subject.

She gains sustenance through collecting

knowledge, but her consumption of

other minds doesnt destroy the

information  she  gathers.

Rather, that cognition be-

comes  a  part  of  Illurien

and her storm of visions.

Illurien doesnt otherwise

eat or drink, and unlike oth-

er outsiders, she doesnt

breathe. She has no physi-

cal needs or desires beyond her

thirst for erudition.

Environment: Illurien resides

Illurien can use plane shift to arrive precisely within the

Athenaeum Nefarious.

The Shrouded Dispensary, a building 100 miles from the

center spire of the Outlands, is where those who wish to speak

with Illurien can call her. She comes if shes willing, carrying

a sword of the planes (DMG 228) and protected by the effect the

Outlands has on magic, spell-like abilities, and supernatural

abilities. Only Illurien can use the Dispensarys planar gate,

which leads to the Athenaeum Nefarious.

Physical Characteristics: Illurien is a graceful, human-

like, female figure, roughly 8 feet tall, with shimmering

silver-gray skin. She has no distinct facial features other

than  a  pair  of  silver-tinted  eyes  with  blue  irises.  Close

examination shows that she is composed entirely of irides-

cent droplets, but this watery composition forms organs

and even bonelike structures. So, despite her elemental

nature, she does have vulnerable spots. Illurien touches the

ground only when she must, otherwise  oating or  ying

everywhere she travels.

SOCIETY

Illurien  considers  herself

a scholar, a collector, and a

sage. The knowledge she

possesses is in demand.

Creatures from across the

planes seek Illuriens counsel,

despite her fees, which are brutal-

ly personal and coldly constructed.

TYPICAL TREASURE

in an extraplanar repository referred to as the Athenaeum

Nefarious, a place so well hidden in the wilderness of the

Outlands that few have found itand fewer still return

from it. The library contains stacks of dark and forgotten

lore,  baleful  traps,  vile  guardians,  and  several  one-way

portals to other planes. A clue to the whereabouts of this

sinister vault is the perpetual storm that enshrouds it. Only

Illurien of the

Myriad Glimpses

Illurien rarely carries treasure, but she might be

caught ferrying a tome of disturbing teachings or

a mystifying item to the Athenaeum Nefarious.

If she is carrying valuables, those objects are

worth as much as standard treasure for Illuriens

Challenge Rating (22,000 gp). The sword she

carries to the Shrouded Dispensary is worth slightly more

than this total.

If it occurs anywhere other than the Shrouded Dispen-

sary, Illuriens death spawns hints to the location of the

Athenaeum Nefarious in minds recently touched by the

tempest lash. Creatures that survive her attacks might be left

with the ability to  nd Illuriens gloomy home.

Feign Enchantment (Su) Jaebrin tricksters absorb the

energy of enchantment effects used on them, allowing

them to know the intended effect. The jaebrin can

then pretend to be affected, fooling even detect magic,

arcane sight, and similar effects, since the absorbed

energy is displayed in the jaebrins aura for the duration

of the effect or until the jaebrin dismisses it. Only by

winning an opposed Sense Motive check against the

fey is not enchanted.

Armored Mage (Ex) A jaebrin trickster does not have an

arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor.

92

Jaebrins  are  fey  whose  fearsome  teeth  belie  an  impish

nature. Their powers of enchantment, and their immunity

to those same effects, make them tricky opponents and

untrustworthy allies.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Jaebrin tricksters live by their wits, not by their mettle, and

they prefer to befuddle and enchant opponents rather than

face them in open combat. No jaebrin trickster is above

using charm person and hypnotism to get his way. If forced

to  ght, a jaebrin trickster uses sleep, then casts obscuring

mist. He then casts expeditious retreat and beats feet out of

the area.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Jaebrins are outcast drifters that enjoy tricking and entertain-

ing mortals. Only rarely is a jaebrin found among other fey,

and in such cases, the jaebrin is with a mate or has fallen in

with immoral kin.

Impostor Innkeeper (EL 1): Bertletuckle is a jaebrin

trickster. He overwhelmed the lone barkeep of a roadside inn

earlier this morning, and he spent the day feasting. When

the PCs arrive, Bertletuckle acts the part of an innkeeper

pleased to have guests at his otherwise deserted inn. He

happily offers the characters rooms for the night, then tries

to rob them in their sleep.

ECOLOGY

Jaebrins  are  elflike  in  their  appearance,  but  they  are

more like a cross between humans and half-elves when

it comes to how they live and age. A jaebrin is an adult

at age 20 or so, and can live to be nearly 200. This seems

to be a short life for a fey creature, and some speculate

that jaebrins would live longer if they remained among

their fey kin.

This creature is a jaebrin, a fey creature full of

mischief. This result reveals all fey traits.

Jaebrins have needle-toothed mouths capable of

delivering a painful bite. That same bite saps the

will.

Jaebrins excel at enchantment magic and are

immune to its effects. They have the uncanny

ability to fake being enchanted, however.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

When it comes to love, jaebrins are slightly unusual.

Females commonly initiate courtships. Mated jae-

brins usually stay together just long enough to

raise their  rst offspring, or about 21 years.

Then  the  two  split  amicably  and

remain friends, but they are never

again lovers.

Jaebrins love lavish feasts.

Born  with  hedonistic

appetites,  they  can  eat

and drink nearly contin-

uously without gaining

weight.  They  indulge

this  gluttony  whenever

they can.

Environment: Jaebrins prefer tem-

perate climes near civilization.

Typical Physical Characteristics:

Jaebrins rarely top 5 feet in height, and

individuals  weighing  more  than  100

pounds are rare. Elflike in appearance,

jaebrins  have  fine  features,  but  their

mouths  bristle  with  needlelike  teeth.

Their  fair  eyes  are  oversized,  giving

them an alluring or unsettling appear-

ance,  depending  on  the  lighting  and

their mood. All jaebrins have shiny hair

of nearly any color, but red and raven are

most common.

Alignment: Jaebrins are full of tomfoolery,

egotism, and decadence, but they arent malevo-

lent or cruel. They are usually chaotic neutral.

SOCIETY

Jaebrin trickster

Jaebrins  were  formerly  the  jesters  of

fey  courts.  Fey  nobles  delighted  in

enchanting jaebrins to perform silly or

weird acts. For their part, the jaebrins rev-

eled in their role, seeing entertainment as

a great service.

Eventually they built up a strong tolerance to enchant-

ment.  For  a  number  of  centuries,  they  hid  this  fact  from

their masters and learned to fake being under the sway of

enchantment. In time, fey noble after fey noble discovered

the ruse and lost interest in the jaebrins. The forsaken fey

were shamed into self- imposed exile.

Some jaebrins now make their way as merchants, charla-

tans, and swindlers. Others bring merriment as bards, and a

few exploit their talents by becoming sorcerers. Such jaebrins

might even seek the excitement of adventuring.

A  large  number  of  jaebrins  speak  with  pronounced

lisps and have a comical tendency to pronounce all nouns

as  plural.  They  even  pluralize  words  that  are  already

plural or add an s to words that dont need one. I

hears the femaleses in this town are all beautieses,

one might say, enjoying the laughter his ridiculous

speech evokes.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Jaebrins love fine clothing, jewelry, and

gems. Although they carry money, they

love to hoodwink others out of neces-

sities  such  as  provisions.  Jaebrins

have  standard  treasure  for  their

Challenge Rating.

JAEBRINS AS

CHARACTERS

Like  humanoids,  jaebrins  gain

their Hit Dice and much of their

power from the class or classes they

choose  to  pursue.  These  fey  prefer

trickery to combat, and theyre bright

enough to accentuate their strengths,

so they pursue careers as bards, beguil-

ers, or rogues. A few become sorcerers, and

such jaebrins can become fearsome indeed. Jae-

brins  are  faithless,  howeverif  they  pursue

divine  magic,  they  do  so  only  through  the

druid class.

of this bizarre culture. It also expands on kuo-toa society,

Kuo-toas are described beginning on page 163 of the

Slippery (Ex) Crazed kuo-toas secrete an oily film. Webs,

and they can usually wriggle free from most forms of

confinement.

Light Blindness (Ex) Blinded for 1 round in daylight, then

dazzled when still in daylight.

Madness plagues the kuo-toas. Owing to centuries of inbreed-

ing and dedication to a perverse deity, a large number of

kuo-toas are mentally unstable. Some kuo-toas slide over

into utter lunacy, turning into murderous creatures. Crazed

kuo-toas are no larger than their fellows, but their mental

illness makes them animalistic, giving them abnormal might,

agility, and resilience.

Kuo-toa whips use their crazed underlings as disposable

shock troops. In some cases, however, a leader exiles the

insane to areas just outside the main settlement, leaving

them to fend for themselves. The crazed kuo-toas are

then no longer a strain on the communitys resources,

but  they  still  act  as  that  settlements  outermost  ring

of defense.

Strategies and Tactics

Crazed kuo-toas hurl themselves at their enemies, heed-

less  of  safety.  They  use  Power  Attack  at  its  maximum,

reducing  their  commitment  to  this  tactic  only  when  it

becomes  evident  its  costing  them  the  opportunity  to

draw blood.

Crazed Kuo-Toas with Class Levels

Crazed kuo-toas rarely survive long enough to advance

in  a  class,  but  those  that  do  advance  as  barbarians.

Barbarian is considered an associated class for a crazed

KUO-TOA EXALTED WHIP

A red  ush suffuses this  shlike humanoid, and armor crafted from

seashells covers its form. It bares its sharp teeth in hatred. One hand

clutches an odd staff with a lobsterlike claw at the top; the other

dances in the complicated gestures of spellcasting.

Kuo-toa

exalted whip

95

Exalted whips are kuo-toas marked for greatness by Blibdool-

poolp. When that goddess is willing, a single kuo-toan egg

in a large settlement hatches an exalted whip. Exalted whips

quickly ascend the kuo-toan hierarchy, combining

physical power with a ruthless intellect.

Strategies and Tactics

Exalted whips lead from the rear. They surround

themselves  with  as  many  other

kuo-toas as possible, and they en-

courage the shrines they rule to

grow rapidly. Exalted whips

prefer to use spells such as

hold person to debilitate their

enemies from a distance.

Only if victory seems sure

do they wade into melee.

At the  rst sign of trou-

ble,  an  exalted  whip

uses aquatic escape to

gather  more  rein-

forcements. But if

a  kuo-toa  shrine

faces destruction,

the whips  ght

to the death.

Exalted Whips with Class Levels

Kuo-toa exalted whips are elite, and they advance as clerics, but

they dont gain extra domains from doing so. A kuo-toa exalted

whips cleric levels stack with Hit Dice to determine spells per

day and the ability to rebuke undead. No class except for cleric

is considered associated for a kuo-toa exalted whip.

A kuo-toan harpoon is a spear that has a barbed metal head. A

slender, 30-foot-long chain runs from the harpoons end.

If a kuo-toan harpoon deals damage, the target must succeed

on a Reflex save (DC 10 + the damage dealt) or be harpooned. A

harpooned creature moves at half speed, cannot charge or run,

and must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. On

a failed check, it loses the spell.

If a kuo-toa harpooner holds onto the chain, the harpooned

creature must make an opposed Strength check to move more

then 30 feet away from the harpooner. As a swift action, the har-

pooner can wrap his end of the chain around his sticky shield.

In  this  case,  he  gains  a +5  bonus  on  the  opposed  Strength

check. As a standard action, the harpooner can slam his shield

to the ground to seal it in place with the chain still attached.

If the harpooner does so, the harpooned creature is lashed to

within 30 feet of the spot the shield is stuck to and must suc-

ceed on a DC 20 Strength check to escape.

A harpooned creature can pull the harpoon out if it has two

hands free and takes a full-round action to do so. Removing

the  harpoon  in  this  way  deals  1d10  points  of  damage  to  the

harpooned creature. A successful DC 15 Heal check allows the

removal of the harpoon without any additional damage.

Those who make unsuccessful melee attacks against a

automatically grappled if they get stuck. The adhesive

Kuo-toa harpooners are elite warriors that help monitors and

whips keep their society functioning. Harpooners capture

and con ne kuo-toas that slide into madness and threaten

the precarious stability of a kuo-toan settlement. When faced

with invading humans and other threats, harpooners use

their weapons to neutralize and kill attackers.

Strategies and Tactics

Kuo-toa harpooners keep to the edge of a battle, using their

harpoons to capture and neutralize their opponents. The

harpooners usually focus their  re on a single foe, hoping

to control that enemy and hold it still while the rest of the

kuo-toas swarm in to attack.

Kuo-toa monitors serve as tactical commanders and skilled

melee combatants. Kuo-toan society is full of warriors, and

monitors direct these soldiers against an enemy. Yet monitors

serve a greater purpose. They are the caretakers of kuo-toan

civilization, forming a sort of secret police dedicated to

stamping out madness, controlling kuo-toas who tumble into

insanity, and maintaining order within a shrine.

Strategies and Tactics

A monitor  ghts alone only if cornered. Otherwise, she relies

on a group of kuo-toa warriors. The monitor dashes forward,

stuns or uses Mind-Shattering Strike against an opponent,

then allows her underlings to charge forward. Monitors

particularly enjoy picking off enemies who have lost their

weapons to the adhesive of a kuo-toa shield.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

NEW FEATS

Kuo-toa monitors use their own brand of martial arts.

KUO-TOAN MONASTICISM

The  monitors  learn  to  use  the  strange,  sticky  substance

common to kuo-toas as part of their martial arts. If a monitors

first punch hits, it sticks its hand to the target, executes an ac-

robatic tumble, and unfailingly lands its second strike.

Prerequisites: Kuo-toa, flurry of blows.

Benefit: As a swift action, a kuo-toa can smear a strange,

sticky substance on its hands. When using flurry of blows, the

kuo-toa automatically hits with one of its extra attacks if its first

attack hits. A kuo-toa that has this feat uses Hit Dice, rather

than character level, to determine its Stunning Fist save DC.

MIND-SHATTERING STRIKE

Violent madness lurks just beneath the surface in all kuo-toas.

The monitors learn to control this madness and channel it into

their enemies.

Prerequisites: Kuo-toa, Kuo-Toa Monasticism, Stunning Fist,

flurry of blows.

Benefit: Before making an unarmed strike, a kuo-toa monitor

can choose to use this feat, consuming one of the monitors daily

uses of the Stunning Fist feat. If kuo-toa monitors next unarmed

attack hits, the struck opponent must make a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 the monitors HD + its Wis modifier). On a failed save, that

foe attacks the closest nonkuo-toa on his next turn.

This feat also grants one additional daily use of the Stunning

Fist feat.

Monitors create a deadly combination with their Kuo-Toan

Monasticism feat and Mind-Shattering Strike or Stunning

Fist. If a monitors  rst attack of a  urry of blows hits, she

uses Stunning Fist or Mind-Shattering Strike to augment

her second sure strike. Against particularly dangerous foes,

she uses both.

ECOLOGY

Kuo-toas are warm-blooded amphibious creatures built for

swimming. Although they breathe air as well as water, they

prefer damp environments with ample pools of water. Their

long legs are not well suited to land mobility, so their hop-

ping movement is usually slower than an average

humans land speed.

Kuo-toa females lay eggs that are later fertilized

by male kuo-toas, much the way  sh spawn.

Young kuo-toas hatch from the eggs, look-

ing  like  a  cross  between

tadpoles and large  sh.

When they hatch, they

can breathe only water

and are about 1 foot in

height.  Over  the  next  year,

they grow to 3 feet tall and develop

their amphibious qualities.

By the time a kuo-toa reach-

es  ve years old, it is an adult. A

kuo-toa lives to approximately

sixty years of age.

Environment: Kuo-toas live

in waters within the subterra-

nean reaches of the earth. Rarer

clans  live  in  deep  and  dark

temperate ocean waters.

Typical Physical

Characteristics:

Kuo-toas  are  pudgy

and  covered  with  fine

scales.  Looking  like  a

cross between a  sh and

a  frog,  they  have  large

mouths,  oversized  staring  eyes,  and  long  limbs  that  look

spindly. This appearance is deceptive, because even though

kuo-toas are only about 5 feet tall and weigh 160 pounds, they

are tough and strong.

The most telling feature of kuo-toas is their skin, which

smells like rotting  sh. Silvery gray in color, the skin of a

kuo-toa changes hue according to the creatures emotions.

Crazed kuo-toas can change color rapidly, but they are usually

red with agitation and anger.

Alignment: Kuo-toas are sel sh and greedy, always ready

to bully or mistreat others, including less powerful kuo-toas.

Because of this mindset, only fear of those stronger than they

or of punishment by the authorities in a community keeps

the majority of kuo-toas in line. Smart kuo-toas know that

the way to dominance lies in organization, but those with

power abuse that authority and their underlings to the extent

that they can. They are often neutral evil.

SOCIETY

Kuo-toas dwell in small settlements known as shrines. Each

shrine is dedicated to Blibdoolpoolp, and smaller shrines ra-

diate out from larger settlements. All spaces within a shrine

show evidence of religious fervor, with icons, carvings, and

other works depicting the bizarre god-

dess and rituals of the kuo-toas.

Within  the  shrines,  clerics

known as whips are supreme, rul-

ing over other kuo-toas by divine

right. All kuo-toan leaders are

clerics, though a lot of them

are also practiced in subter-

fuge or other forms of martial

training.  A  few  shrines  are

blessed  by  the  presence  of

one  or  more  exalted  whips,

kuo-toas  that  are  favored  by

Blibdoolpoolp to be superior in

every way to their kin. Kuo-toas

high in the chain of command

abuse and intimidate their un-

derlings to instill fear and prevent

scheming for power.

Kuo-toa monitor

Without the aid of their less-

ers, however, whips would have

trouble  controlling  the  ambi-

tious  and  calculating  masses

of the shrines. Specialized so-

cial classes form the backbone

of the kuo-toan  ghting forc-

es. Monitors watch over the

population  like  secret  police,

culling the weak, killing or

imprisoning the criminal, and

corraling the mad. Harpooners work as elite soldiers, aiding

the monitors and whips as commanded, remorselessly kill-

ing anything from intruders to other kuo-toas.

Other adult kuo-toas are capable warriors, but they also

work at crafts and trades, the results of which go to support

the shrine or to honor Blibdoolpoolp. Skill and merit deter-

mine an individuals rise in kuo-toan society. But its easier

to plot against and even murder ones fellows and superiors

to get ahead.

Fear, paranoia, and depravity are as much a part of kuo-toan

culture as religion is. More than a few kuo-toas break under

the strain of living under this cycle of cruelty and suspicion,

becoming unhinged. Others spontaneously descend into mad-

ness during dark rituals dedicated to Blibdoolpoolp. Regardless

of the initial nature of the malady, an insane kuo-toa becomes

a howling, bloodthirsty maniac when attacked or injured.

Madness on an individual scale poses enough of a risk to

kuo-toan civilization, but kuo-toas face an even worse threat.

Mental illness is contagious among these creatureslike a

disease, emerging lunacy seemingly hops from one kuo-toa

to the next. Those kuo-toas af icted in this manner adopt the

symptoms and actions of the initial victim. A weaponsmith

in the grip of a psychopathic episode might cut down a

hapless laborer, and some of the kuo-toas who witness the

crime might also enter a psychopathic state. A small cluster

of nearby kuo-toas could soon join a lone one that enters a

fugue. Fortunately for kuo-toas, only about 10% of those who

witness another kuo-toas insanity fall victim to the same

mental illness, and only the initial break of a sane kuo-toa

causes others to join the madness. Even moments afterward,

the communal nature of the insanity is gone. But the initial

episode can be enough for a shrine to fall into chaos if the

spread is left unchecked. Monitors, whips, and other disci-

plined kuo-toas seem immune to this problem.

Whips dispatch monitors and harpooners to handle out-of-

control kuo-toas that sometimes run through the community

on murderous sprees or ensnare other kuo-toas in their

broken worldviews. Such an individual is killed, escorted

outside the shrine, or shepherded to a special holding cell

built into the walls of important defensive points in the

settlement. When the shrine comes under assault, those cells

KUO-TOA LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (nature) can learn

more about kuo-toas. When a character makes a successful

skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the infor-

mation from lower DCs.

Knowledge (Nature)

DC  Result

12  Kuo-toas are amphibious,  shlike humanoids that

have a complex society that exists underground

and in the lightless depths of the sea. They are

sinister, but they know much about the hidden

truths and places in the world. Kuo-toa skin

secretes a substance that makes the creatures

dif cult to grab. They distill this substance into a

gluelike material that they apply to their shields,

allowing them to trap opponents weapons.

17  Kuo-toas  ght with strange weapons designed

22

to incapacitate rather than kill. They love to

take slaves and sacri ces for their goddess, Blib-

doolpoolp. Their society is divided into a hierarchy

of slaves, citizens, warriors, and priests. They are

immune to poison and paralysis, and resistant to

electricity. They cant stand bright light.

The sensitive eyes of kuo-toas can spot the

movement of an invisible creature. Their clerics,

known as whips, can work together to produce

lightning bolts. Blibdoolpoolp sometimes blesses

a kuo-toa clan with the birth of an exalted whip, a

monstrously powerful creature with the power to

aid evil aquatic creatures.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

open to unleash dozens of insane kuo-toas upon the attackers.

The screeching of these imprisoned crazed kuo-toas gives

a shrine a chilling aspect, a testament to the degeneracy of

kuo-toan society.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Kuo-toas collect coins for trade, and they make icons and

art dedicated to Blibdoolpoolp. Whips and monitors have a

particular interest in magic items. Kuo-toas have standard

treasure for their Challenge Rating, and elite members of

kuo-toan society have standard equipment for NPCs of their

Challenge Rating.

KUO-TOAS WITH CLASS LEVELS

Kuo-toas  typically  advance  as  rogues,  but  harpooners  are

 ghters, monitors are monks, and whips are clerics. Kuo-toa

leaders often take levels in cleric and rogue, combining dedi-

cation to Blibdoolpoolp with abilities that provide an easier

means to get ahead in the devious kuo-toan social order. All

these classes are associated classes for kuo-toas.

Kuo-toa clerics worship Blibdoolpoolp, who provides access

to the domains of Destruction, Evil, and Water.

Level Adjustment: +3.

KUO-TOAS IN EBERRON

Since the Age of Demons, kuo-toas have swum the unfathom-

able seas and twisting waterways of Khyber. They have forgotten

more dark secrets than the wise on Eberrons surface know,

and they harbor knowledge that more than one power-hungry

magician might kill for. Their perverse society is dedicated to

the coiling Dragon Below, their madness rooted in creatures and

enigmas extant long before the daelkyr crippled the Dhakaani

Empire. Kuo-toan civilization is dominant in the subterranean

reaches under Khorvaire, where they make hideous deals

with the children of the lords of Xoriat, emerging only to sell

Khyber dragonshards to those brave or wicked enough to deal

with them. Kuo-toan realms also exist in Khyber underneath

Aerenal, Xendrik, and in nearby oceans, but they are absent

below the continents of Sarlona and Argonnessen.

KUO-TOAS IN FAERN

Kuo-toas dwell in the Underdark, where they live in a theo-

cratic society dedicated to Blibdoolpoolp, whom they call

the Sea Mother. (It is rumored, however, that a few kuo-toas

have turned from the Sea Mother to Shar and her Shadow

Weave.) In Faern, kuo-toas are closely allied with the drow,

going so far as to treat dark elves and their slaves as honorary

kuo-toas. Every other race the kuo-toas treat as inferior or

as prey. The kuo-toas of the Underdark have a sacred shrine

known as the Holy Mother Cauldron to which every kuo-toa

travels at least once in its life. Another major settlement is

Sloopdilmonpolop, a major trading center and source of water

in the Old Shanatar region of the Underdark under Tethyrs

Firedrake Bay. For more information on kuo-toas in Faern,

see the Underdark supplement.

Avalanche Wave (Su) A malastor can attack at range by

reaching into the earth with its powerful claws and

sending a shock wave through the ground. A 10-foot-

tall wave of earth moves in a 400-foot line, dealing 8d6

points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half). Those who fail the

save are also buried under rubble and debris. A buried

creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per

minute. One creature can uncover another in 4 minutes

(or see Cave-Ins and Collapses, DMG 6768). A buried

creature can free itself with a DC 25 Strength check. The

save DC is Dexterity-based.

A malastor can adapt its avalanche wave to hurl a

chunk of earth at a flying creature up to 400 feet above

the ground. When doing so, the malastor can target

only one creature. The Reflex save has the same DC,

and a successful hit brings the flyer to earth and buries

it as normal.

The avalanche wave functions only on normal earth,

though the presence of vegetation doesnt affect it.

Stunning Roar (Su) Whenever it takes hit point damage for

the first time in a round, a malastor emits a dreadful roar

as an immediate action. Those within a 30-foot-radius

spread must succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude save or be

stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based and

includes a +6 racial bonus.

Malastors spend most of their lives sleeping in the ground,

emerging occasionally to feed or breed. When they do emerge,

they devastate large areas of the countryside.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A malastor is violent and eagerly initiates  ghts. Despite its

apparent  stupidity,  it  adapt  its  tactics  and  uses  its  burrow

speed to  ee if it is losing.

When  ghting opponents with shorter reach, a malastor

advances to bring the opponents just within its own threat-

ened area. This allows the malastor to attack freely, but an

opponent closing to attack must leave a threatened square. A

malastor has Combat Re exes, allowing it to use this tactic

with multiple enemies in a given round.

A malastor has no control over its stunning roar, which

is an instinctive reaction to damage. However, it does take

advantage of the effect of the roar, concentrating its attacks

on stunned opponents.

Malastors prefer to use melee attacks, but their avalanche

wave ability allows them to attack enemies at a distance.

Blindsight  lets  them  attack  invisible  enemies  as  well.  A

malastor that has been injured by a spellcaster might focus

its attacks on that character, using avalanche wave, then

moving away from any melee opponents. This tactic can

force melee opponents to provoke attacks of opportunity

again when they move within its reach, giving the creature

the best of both worlds.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

A malastor is encountered only when it emerges from the

earth to feed or mate (see Ecology). Finding any malastor is

easyjust follow its path of destruction.

Mated Pair (EL 18): Almost a year ago, a male and a female

malastor devastated the countryside to build the incubation

heap for their eggs. Since then, they have been guarding

the  enormous  heap,  waiting  for  the  eggs  to  hatchand

the time has almost come. If the PCs can defeat the adult

malastors, they might be able to destroy the eggs. If not, the

destruction the parents wrought could pale in comparison

This is a malastor, a magical beast with a rocky

hide. Malastors have blindsight out to an

incredible distance and are very perceptive. It is

almost impossible to sneak up on them.

31  A malastor can create a tremendous wave of earth

that can bury its foes.

36  Whenever a malastor is wounded, it emits

a terrible roar that can stun those around it,

although this effect soon wears off. A malastor is

wily enough to attack stunned opponents.

to what follows when four young, reckless malastors are

set loose.

The adult malastors attack anyone who comes within 30

feet of the heap or attacks it, pursuing and slaying those who

 ee. The parents split up to deal with various threats.

ECOLOGY

Environment: Malastors prefer temperate plains and

hills, although they are occasionally found in temperate

forests and warm plains. Deserts and mountains almost

never provide enough food for them, although a malastor

looking for a mate might decide to cross such terrain. The

creatures do not like the cold, so they stay

out of cold regions.

Malastors are destructive pred-

ators that sit comfortably at

the top of the food chain.

It is fortunate for all other

creatures  that  they  spend

nine-tenths  of  their  lives

asleep,  burrowed  into  the

ground.

An  average  malastor

emerges from the ground

once per year to feed, cut-

ting a swath of destruction

as it does so. Normally, a

malastor  spends  ten  to

twenty days feeding and

moving across the land

before  burrowing  back

into the ground.

Once  in  every  hu-

man  generation,  a

malastor  is  instinctu-

ally driven to mate. It

leaves the ground and

wanders,  looking  for  a

malastor of the opposite

sex.  While  wandering,  a

malastor is much less destruc-

tive than normal, and it avoids even

small settlements.

This behavior changes when the creature meets its mate.

The pair devastates the surrounding area, piling dead animals

and vegetation into an enormous, rotting heap, within which

the female lays her eggs. The warmth of the heap incubates

the eggs, while the organic material there provides the  rst

food for the newly hatched malastors. The two parents then

stand guard over the heap for the year it takes the eggs to

mature  and  hatch.  During  this  period,  they  are  hostile  to

anyone approaching the mound, but do not range far from

the heap.

When the parents hear the telltale sounds of the hatching

offspring, they  ee in different directions, normally running

for at least two days before burying themselves in the earth.

At about the same time, between two and four new malastors

start eating their way out of the incubation mound. They

are full size, thanks to the prepared food, but ravenous, and

split up to spend ten to twenty days eating before burying

themselves in the ground to start the cycle again.

Malastors  cannot  burrow

through hard rock, so they sleep

in areas with deep soil, or with

sandstone  and  similar  soft-

er rocks. While feeding or

searching,  however,  they

cross  any  sort  of  terrain,

leaving  devastation  be-

hind them.

Typical Physical Char-

acteristics:  A  malastor

has  four  limbs,  a  pow-

erful body, and a head

with a blunt snout. Its

body  is  covered  with

plates of stone, which

form as it sleeps in the

earth,  but  under  the  ar-

mor  it  is  flesh  and  blood.

The color of the plates depends

on the environment where the

malastor  last  slept,  but  they

are often the warm orange of

sandstone.

Malastor

The  two  rear  limbs  are

quite  close  together.  The

front pair is much farther for-

ward and somewhat longer. Each

fore limb ends in enormous claws, which a

malastor uses to great effect in combat. These claws also

enable it to burrow and to scoop earth from the ground

to hurl at its enemies.

When  ghting, a malastor rears up on its hind legs and

stands about 40 feet tall. Most malastors weigh around 40

tons, but larger specimens exist.

Alignment: Malastors enjoy spreading destruction and

have no sense of the importance of organization, so most are

chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Malastors  have  no  interest  in  treasure.  The  reward  for

defeating a malastor often comes from the grateful people

the victors have saved. Mated pairs of malastors have half

standard treassure, which can be found among and on the

corpses in the birthing heap.

MERCHURION

A  metal  colossus  strides  through  the  trees,  its  form  shifting  and

 owing like liquid. The creature moves with a grace that belies its

powerful humanlike form, and you see that its metallic sheen is

no suit of armor. Its eyes bear the same gleam as the rivers of silver

running down its arms, which  ow together to take the shape of

a vicious battleaxe.

Generate Weapon (Su) A merchurion can spontaneously

create a single weapon from its flowing metal form. Such

weapons have a +3 enhancement bonus and are treated

as silvered weapons for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction. If a generated weapon ever leaves the

merchurions hand, that weapon immediately melts into

a pool of harmless silver liquid.

A merchurion is proficient with any weapon it

generates using this ability, even an exotic one.

Absorb Properties (Ex) If a merchurion is successfully struck

by a magic weapon, all that weapons properties are

absorbed by the merchurion for 1 hour. The weapon loses

its properties during that time (or until the merchurion is

slain). A merchurion can manifest any of these absorbed

properties in its generated weapon.

A merchurion can absorb and manifest weapon

properties totaling a +5 enhancement bonus (DMG 223)

or a market value of up to 50,000 gp. Properties beyond

these limits are not absorbed. If a weapon has properties

in excess of these limits, the weakest properties are

absorbed first.

As an immediate action, a merchurion can choose to

give up absorbed properties to absorb new properties.

If it does so, the properties the merchurion gives up are

restored to the weapon they were absorbed from.

Manifested weapon properties must be suitable for

the type of weapon a merchurion generates. Unsuitable

properties can be absorbed and count toward the total

limit of properties even if they cannot be manifested.

For example, a merchurion could absorb the disruption

property from a mace of disruption, but could not

manifest that property in a battleaxe.

A merchurion does not absorb the enhancement

bonus from a weapon whose properties it absorbs. So,

weapons that lose properties continue to function with

their magical enhancement bonus as normal.

Legends speak of the merchurions, an ancient race of  re

giants in the service of Surtur. Master metalsmiths, they

were charged by the Lord of the Fire Giants with creating

weapons that surpassed even the adamantine axes of the

dwarves in combat. After decades of toil, the giants had

produced only a strange slag of mercurial metal. Surtur

was  furious,  savagely  hurling  all  his  followers  into  the

magma rift that held their creation. The giants were not

slain, however, emerging instead as construct creatures of

living quicksilver.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Merchurions are con dent of their abilities in combat, and

they waste no time before wading into the thick of melee. A

merchurion uses Awesome Blow to scatter its foes, forcing

them to spend time getting back into position before they

can attack again. Whenever possible, a merchurion targets

opponents wielding magic weapons in the hope of absorbing

those weapons properties. The living contruct might even

bull rush through one foe to get at another. It fashions arma-

ments to suit its tactics, using two-handed reach weapons to

keep opponents at bay or  ghting with smaller weapons in

con ned spaces.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Merchurions are rare creatures that are usually solitary.

They do form bands, but such groups have fewer than six

members at a time.

Frontier Raider (EL 17): A merchurion is attacking a

series of forts guarding a giant-infested mountain pass. The

creature seems intent on acquiring the forts metal munitions,

but its doing so could leave the pass all but defenseless against

a massive giant incursion. The PCs are charged with putting

an end to the creatures rampage.

ECOLOGY

Merchurions are driven by their peculiar diet.

They devour metal, with silver being their

meal of choice. Though, as living constructs,

merchurions have no need to eat, their

mysterious  craving  dictates  the  di-

rection of their wandering and the

locations of their settlements.

Like other living constructs, mer-

churions do not reproduce. Rather,

every merchurion in the world is

one of the original members of

this race, created in ages past. A

dying race, these creatures pro-

duce no progeny.

Environment: Merchurions

favor  warm  environs,  and  most

of  them  inhabit  the  interiors  of

volcanic mountains. Others re-

main  even  farther  beneath  the

surface of the earth. Individual

merchurions can be found roam-

ing everywhere but in arctic climes,

seeking lost mines, ancient treasure

hoards, and the like.

Typical  Physical  Character-

istics: Merchurions appear well

muscled, and their rippling

silvery forms  ow like liquid

metal. They are far larger than

the  re giants they are suppos-

edly descended from, standing 20 feet tall and weighing

twelve tons.

Merchurion

Alignment: Merchurions are disdainful of all would-be

foes, especially true giants. They are virtually impossible

to  parlay  with,  neither  asking  for  nor  granting  quarter  in

combat. Merchurions embrace a life of change and transfor-

mation, and they hate all other creatures. They tend strongly

toward chaotic evil as a result.

SOCIETY

Merchurions  are  reclusive,  shunning  the  company  of

other creatures and withdrawing into the volcanic inner

reaches of the earth. Their lives are centered around an

obsession with discovering a way to create more of their

number. Merchurions seek allies with knowledge of crafting

constructs in the hope of one day creating new genera-

tions of their kind.

These living constructs scorn other races as inferior. They

are envious only of  re giants, whom merchurions view as

Surturs chosen. Merchurions have a deep sense of shame

over their failure and punishment by Surtur. These mixed

feelings turn to bloodshed whenever merchurions and  re

giants meet.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Merchurion lairs rarely contain metal of any kind, since such

material is eaten as quickly as it is found. But merchurions still

have standard treasure, made up of gems and nonmetallic

magic items.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

When a merchurion is slain, it collapses to a pool

of silver liquid that evaporates harmlessly after

24 hours. Any weapon dipped into this pool

undergoes  a  permanent  change,  becoming

silvered and striking as a magic weapon (if

not already magic) for the purpose of over-

coming damage reduction.

MERCHURIONS

IN EBERRON

The merchurions of Eb-

erron  are  an  ancient

race whose origins are

shrouded  in  mystery,

but which is no doubt

connected to the ancient

creation forges of Xendrik.

Merchurions have ranged far

from the shattered land in

the countless centuries

since their creation, and

one extended tribe now

serves a powerful silver dragon

named Azraxror-Shien on Argonnessen.

A  neutral  good  merchurion  named  Silver st  resides  in

Thrane. The creature converted to the faith of the Silver Flame

and is recognized as an icon by some clergy. His place in the

church remains a source of debate.

MERCHURIONS IN FAERN

In recent years, adventurers delving beneath the volcanic

areas of Chult have returned with tales of giant creatures

of lique ed metal dwelling deep within the earth. These

merchurions are rumored to covet metal and magic.

MIND FLAYERS OF THOON

Mind  ayers have long explored the cosmos beyond their

underground  lairs,  traveling  the  Inner  Planes  and  Outer

Planes aboard vessels they call nautiloids. One such vessel, on

a mission of exploration over a century ago, traveled farther

than others. Setting a course for the uncharted reaches of

the Astral Plane, the mind  ayers crossed over into the Far

Realm, a place of madness and disorder.

They  returned  or,  perhaps,  were  sent  back  dramatically

changed, capable of great feats of construct crafting and selec-

tive breeding. Though the physical changes were dramatic,

the more profound change was to the very consciousness of

those illithids. They now speak reverently of a being/god/

philosophy known to them as Thoon. The mind  ayers of

Thoon claim to be able to commune with this presence from

the Far Realm, as well as receive instructions from it.

So far those instructions havent demonstrated any long-

term  purpose.  The  mind   ayers  of  Thoon  have  traversed

the planes, moving from place to out-of-the-way place and

gathering a mysterious substance they call quintessence.

After collecting this substance from captured creatures and

rare materials, the mind  ayers of Thoon either store it in

glowing ovoid structures called matrices or use it to power

their constructs and bizarre creatures.

Most mind  ayers of Thoon are identical to the mind  ayers

described in the Monster Manual, but others have been twisted

by their time in the Far Realm or through experimentation

with quintessence. This entry describes the altered illithids,

along with their humanoid spies, construct servitors, and the

Thoon elder brain.

Because of their strong connection to mind  ayers, the non-

illithid creatures described in this section require Knowledge

(dungeoneering) for their lore checks instead of the typical

skill. Because of the secrecy and obscurity of this cult, many

lore DCs are also higher than normal. To even know the word

Thoon requires a DC 20 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check,

which is assumed in the lore entries.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

WHAT IS THOON?

Thoon  could  be  anything  from  an  epic-level  outsider  to  a

demigod to a full-fledged deity.

Thoon might also be nothing more than a guiding philoso-

phythe illithids term for the collection of quintessence and

the strange experiments that they conduct.

In fact, you dont necessarily need to decide what Thoon is.

Thoon itself is likely to remain beyond the characters direct

knowledgeunless the PCs go into the Far Realm or Thoon

somehow emerges into the rest of the D&D cosmology.

One of the reasons the PCs might find it difficult to learn

about Thoon is that the mind flayers themselves are incapable

of  describing  Thoon  in  detail,  even  under  magical  compul-

sion. They genuinely seem unable to understand questions

such as Is Thoon a god? The mind flayers answer, Thoon is

Thoon, and Thoon is all! Almost any question about Thoons

nature gets the same response.

hold their own in melee combat. These

larly challenging when they have

Although a Thoon disciple can

be effective as a melee combatant,

its  equally  deadly  in  the  back

A Thoon disciple has a potent

mind blast, and it can often keep

a  hold  person  spell  going  long

enough for another mind  ayer to per-

Ecology

Unless they have a good reason to leave

the safety of the nautiloid vessel, Thoon

disciples  remain  within  the  inner

chambers. They rely on shadow  ay-

ers and rank-and- le mind  ayers to

collect brains for sustenance.

Environment: When Thoon dis-

ciples leave the nautiloid vessel, they

prefer underground dwellings. Thoon

disciples take care to construct a shrine to

Thoon wherever theyre based, gather-

ing broken bits of treasure and casting

it before an otherwise featureless al-

tar. When the mind  ayers of Thoon

move  elsewhere  in  search  of  quintes-

sence,  these  shrines  are  left  behind  for

later explorers to puzzle over.

106

Thoon disciple

Typical Physical Characteristics: A

Thoon disciple is the same height and weight as

a typical human. Because they wear heavy armor, disciples

appear bulkier and stronger than typical mind  ayers. Like

other mind  ayers, Thoon disciples are genderless.

Alignment:  Thoon  disciples  are  neutral  evil,  but  they

have a slight tendency toward lawfulness because theyre in

positions  of  authority.  Regardless,  when  a  Thoon  disciple

receives visions from Thoon, it carries out those directions

from the Far Realm, no matter how chaotic or nonsensical

they seem.

Society

A Thoon disciple regards itself as second only to the Thoon

elder brain among the followers of Thoon. Since the elder

brain agrees with this assessment, Thoon disciples handle

the day-to-day leadership chores that the Thoon elder brain

cant do itself.

Because the Thoon disciples manage the shadow flayer

breeding program, they eagerly use suggestion and charm

monster to make shadow  ayers perform errands for them.

Many Thoon disciples are secretly pleased that the shadow

 ayers have diminished psionic abilityit makes the shadow

 ayers more pliable.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a shadow flayer must

hit a creature of up to Large size with a tentacle attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and

attaches a tentacle to the opponents head. A shadow

flayer can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only if it can

somehow reach the foes head. If a shadow flayer begins

its turn with at least one tentacle attached, it can try to

attach its remaining tentacles with a single grapple check.

The opponent can escape with a single successful grapple

check or an Escape Artist check, but the shadow flayer

gets a +2 circumstance bonus for every tentacle that was

attached at the beginning of the opponents turn.

Extract (Ex) If a shadow flayer begins its turn with all

four tentacles attached to its opponent and makes a

successful grapple check, it extracts that opponents

brain, instantly killing that creature. Constructs,

elementals, oozes, plants, and undead are immune.

Mind Blast (Sp) 60-foot cone, stun for 3d4 rounds, Will

DC 16 negates.

Shadowcloak (Su) A shadow flayer can draw on its own inner

stores of quintessence to briefly become invisible. By

expending a swift action and taking 5 points of damage,

a shadow flayer becomes invisible for 1 round. Unlike

with the invisibility spell, shadowcloak doesnt end when a

shadow flayer attacks.

Poison Use (Ex) A shadow flayer is skilled in the use of

poison and never risks accidentally poisoning itself when

applying poison to a weapon.

Though the followers of Thoon have many normal mind  ayers

among them, they also have shadow  ayers, part of a breeding

program that emphasizes stealth over psionic ability.

HOW QUINTESSENCE WORKS

Mind flayers cant predict what creatures and substances contain

quintessence, but some of the Thoon creatures (mad crafters of

Thoon, Thoon infiltrators, and stormclouds of Thoon) can detect

quintessence using the detect magic spell-like ability. It appears

as a black, coruscating aura.

Not every creature of the same race (or every substance of the

same composition) contains quintessenceits presence seems

to be random. The mind flayers use Thoon infiltrators and Thoon

thralls to find potential quintessence sources. If the creatures

that contain quintessence are weak, Thoon thralls kidnap them.

If not, the more powerful Thoon creatures go to work.

If  mind  flayers  find  quintessence  in  rare  substances,  they

mine it, bringing it to the nautiloid vessel or to a madcrafter

of Thoon. Sometimes mind flayers must dominate servitors to

handle the menial aspects of quintessence collection. They do

so by first undermining a community using Thoon infiltrators

and Thoon thralls, employing traditional mind flayer abilities to

crush what resistance remains in the weakened community.

Extracted and refined quintessence is a green, glowing fluid. A

typical source (such as a creature, a chunk of some rare mineral ore,

or an unusual plant) provides about a gallon of liquid. Madcrafters

of Thoon can store quintessence within themselves to create

scythers of Thoon and stormclouds of Thoon, and the vast proces-

sors aboard the nautiloid ship store quintessence in their matrices.

Each matrix holds about 10 gallons of quintessence.

Matrices of quintessence have a strong aura when viewed

using detect magic. Smaller quantities of refined quintessence

have a moderate or stronger aura, depending on the amount.

The school of the magic is never clear.

If a PC is harvested for quintessence, its harder to restore

that characters life. Even if the surviving PCs save their com-

rades body, the quintessence must be recovered for any spell

short of greater resurrection to work.

Mind  flayers  of  Thoon  can  garner  quintessence  from  an

extracted brain as well, although doing so ruins the ordinary

nutrition value of the brain.

The most important game aspect of quintessence collection is

that it proceeds at the speed of the plot. That is, if an adventure

depends on the mayors daughter, the iron ore in a nearby mine,

or the PCs themselves being strong potential sources of quin-

tessence, then youre well within your rights to make it so. As a

DM, you have better things to do than track exactly how much

quintessence the mind flayers are gathering and expending.

in the middle of the  ght to give the PCs one more thing

to worry about.

Like traditional mind  ayers, shadow  ayers are less durable

than other monsters of their Challenge Rating. Shadow  ayers

are also somewhat less versatile, since they dont have all the

enchantment-based psionic abilities that regular mind  ayers

have. With their ability to quickly turn invisible, theyre better

at the tentacle attacks that lead to brain extraction.

Shadow  ayers usually carry daggers coated with shadow

essence, a potent but slow-acting poison. If they are facing a

signi cant foe, they use shadowcloak,  ing their daggers from

a safe hiding place, then  ee. After a minute, when the poison

has  run  its  course,  they  return,  shadowcloaking  again  to

surprise weakened PCs with tentacle attacks and grapples.

Ecology

Shadow  ayers are physiologically similar to mind  ayers,

but a shadow  ayer has a less prominent cranium and a cor-

respondingly less powerful mind. Shadow  ayers eat brains

and reproduce as mind  ayers do.

Environment:  Shadow   ayers  call  the  nautiloid  vessel

home, but they venture farther from it than other mind  ay-

ers of Thoon do. When the nautiloid enters an underground

cave or other hidden lair, shadow  ayers play a key role in

the initial scouting effortat least until Thoon in ltrators

and thralls can be crafted.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A shadow  ayer is the

same height and weight as a human. Like mind  ayers, they

are genderless. The only obvious differences from normal

Shadow  ayer

mind  ayers are the shadow  ayers jet-black skin and slightly

smaller cranium.

Alignment: Shadow  ayers are usually neutral evil. They

have a slightly chaotic tendency that breeding hasnt yet

stamped out.

Society

Shadow  ayers see themselves as spies and hunters for Thoon.

Theyre haughty about their ability to in ltrate places unseen

and their ability to bring back brains.

This is a shadow  ayer, a mind  ayer with ebony

skin. It can turn invisible at will.

These dark-skinned mind  ayers are part of a

breeding program under the guidance of Thoon.

They can brie y turn invisible, but doing so is

painfulperhaps the breeding program isnt

perfected yet.

28  One side effect of the breeding process that leads

to shadow  ayers is diminished psionic ability.

Theyre incapable of any subtle psionic tricks, but

their mind blast remains potent.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Shadow  ayers have a natural rivalry with Thoon thralls,

which are individually much weaker but often make better

spies because theyre so well disguised. The Thoon elder brain

sometimes has to discipline shadow  ayers who treat Thoon

thralls too cruelly.

Shadow  ayers also take pains to distinguish themselves from

ordinary mind  ayers, pointing out their controlled breeding.

Each shadow  ayer believes that it is the acme of mind  ayer

evolution, purpose-bred to do the will of Thoon.

Eventual Comeback (Ex) The Far Realm parasite that powers

a Thoon infiltrator can survive the death of its host,

then revive that host. When a Thoon infiltrator reaches

10 hit points, it doesnt actually die. All life functions

cease, however, and the Thoon infiltrator is functionally

a corpse for the purpose of resolving spells that affect

dead bodies. It takes a DC 25 Search check to detect a

slight vibration in the neck-tentacles that indicates that

the creature is not fully dead. Removing the tentacles

from the neck (a bloody process that requires a full-round

action) kills a Thoon infiltrator for good.

If the tentacles arent removed, a Thoon infiltrator

can effectively resurrect itself. After it has spent a month

in the near-death state, a Thoon infiltrator returns to

consciousness at full normal hit points. It then frees itself

from burial with dimension door and tries to reestablish

contact with its mind flayer masters.

Throat Dart (Su) The tentacles that represent a Thoon

infiltrators parasite aspect can extend themselves up the

infiltrators throat and out its mouth, from where they can

shoot a poison dart at a nearby target. The dart functions

as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.

Spawn Thrall (Su) If a Thoon infiltrator can spend an

uninterrupted minute with a helpless humanoid, the

infiltrator can turn it into a Thoon thrall by snaking its thin

neck-tentacles into the victims mouth. Sleeping creatures

automatically awaken when a Thoon infiltrator attempts

this, so it works only on creatures that are bound,

magically held, or truly unconscious. A Thoon infiltrator

can create one Thoon thrall per week in this manner.

Submerge Tentacles (Ex) A Thoon infiltrator usually hides

its neck-tentacles with a cloak, high collar, or scarf. But

if it expects close scrutiny, it can submerge the tentacles

beneath the flesh, leaving only a rough patch of skin

behind. Doing so takes a full-round action.

While its tentacles are submerged, a Thoon infiltrator

cant use its spell-like abilities, throat dart, telepathy, or

spawn thrall. If a Thoon infiltrator dies with its tentacles

submerged, no search short of dismemberment can

reveal the tentacles presence, and the Thoon infiltrators

eventual comeback ability functions normally.

Skills The facial features of a Thoon infiltrator are as

malleable as clay, granting the creature a +8 racial bonus

on Disguise checks.

The parasitic Thoon in ltrator is an undercover spy for the mind

 ayers of Thoon, able to build secret networks of Thoon thralls

while appearing as innocuous as an ordinary human.

Strategies and Tactics

A Thoon in ltrator is a good recurring villain for low-level

PCs. In time, it can lead them into contact with the more

powerful mind  ayers of Thoon. It functions particularly well

in the company of several Thoon thralls it has created.

In battle, a Thoon in ltrator is a capable sword-wielder,

and it can surprise an unsuspecting PC with its throat darts.

Perhaps more important is its ability to direct the actions of

any Thoon thrall it is with. The mere presence of a Thoon

in ltrator makes each Thoon thrall more effective.

Because the mind  ayers of Thoon have only so many Far

Realm parasites, each Thoon in ltrator is a precious resource.

Fortunately for the illithids, a Thoon in ltrator can escape

death at the hands of the PCs, either in the short term (by

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

WHY NOT A TEMPLATE?

Given how Thoon infiltrators come into beinga parasitic

infestation at the hands of illithidscreating a template for

them makes a certain amount of sense. Mechanically, though,

it just isnt worth the effort because the template would change

every thing about the creature. When the local sheriff gets

turned into a Thoon infiltrator, only his appearance and basic

memories remain intactthe rest is a product of the mind

flayer transformation. Thus, its easier just to build the infiltra-

tor as a normal monster and stipulate that it looks like whatever

it was beforehand.

Ecology

The mind  ayers had some living human-

oid captives aboard their nautiloid vessel

when they breached the Far Realm. To

the illithids surprise, the humanoids

were quickly infected with a parasite na-

tive to the Far Realm, becoming Thoon

in ltrators.  The  mind   ayers  surprise

turned to delight when they realized that a

Thoon in ltrator could both impersonate

ordinary folk and detect quintessence.

Since  then,  the  mind   ayers  have

learned a little more about the life cycle

of the Thoon in ltrator parasite. In its unat-

tached state, the parasite looks like a bundle

of thin, metallic tentacles about the size of

a housecat. When brought into proximity

to a humanoid, the tentacles burrow into

the brain and vital organs of the host crea-

ture, killing it, then reassembling the host

body tissue by tissue. After a day of spasmod-

ic twitching, the host body arises, appearing as

it did before (other than the tentacles at the base

of its skull) but wholly devoted to Thoon and

the mind  ayers.

The  reconstituted  body  no  longer

needs to eat, sleep, or breathe, but it can

do those things voluntarily if it wants

to appear humanoid.

So  far,  the  Thoon  in ltrators  life

span  and  means  of  reproduction  are

unknown to either the mind  ayers or the

in ltrators themselves. The mind  ayers have

developed a technique for transferring the parasite from one

humanoid to another after an hour of gruesome surgery. They

do so only when a Thoon in ltrator has become too notorious

to be effective in the outside world, or when they have a

living captive they think would make a particularly good

host. Most Thoon in ltrators are out in the world doing

the secret work of the mind  ayers, so only a few unat-

tached parasites are available to the mind

 ayers of Thoon at a given time.

The mind  ayers of Thoon have exper-

imented with different hosts for the Thoon

in ltrator parasite, but so far, it accepts only

a humanoid as a host.

Environment: A Thoon in ltrator pre-

fers the same environment its host lived in

before infestation, although this is strictly a

matter of comfort and camou age. Thoon in-

 ltrators have a slight distaste for warmer climes,

simply because humanoids there tend to wear less

clothing, so its harder to hide the neck-tentacles.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A Thoon

in ltrator retains the height and weight of its host

creature.  In  most  cases,  thats  a  human.  Aside

from the metallic tentacles projecting from the

base of its skull, a Thoon in ltrator looks iden-

tical to a normal person.

Although Thoon in ltrators dont have gen-

ders,  their  hosts  do.  Thoon  in ltrators  never

produce offspring.

Alignment: Unlike the other followers of

Thoon, Thoon in ltrators are always chaotic evil.

They chafe at the control of the mind  ayers

and grow impatient with the long-term plans

for careful quintessence-gathering.

Because the Far Realm is beyond the rest of the universeand

beyond reason itselfThoon in ltrators remember their time

there imperfectly, and those memories are almost impossible

to convey to others. Each Thoon in ltrator has an aching desire

to return to the madness of the Far Realm, and most believe

that the ultimate goal of Thoon is a return to the Far Realm or

an intrusion of the Far Realm into the rest of the universe.

Dormancy (Ex) A Thoon thrall spends most of its time in

a dormant state. When it is dormant, a Thoon thralls

overdrive healing doesnt function, and the thrall doesnt

move at full speed. It appears exactly as it did before a

Thoon infiltrator turned it into a Thoon thrall.

As a full-round action, a Thoon thrall can end its

dormancy. Throbbing, veinlike growths emerge from its

skin, and the thralls true nature becomes apparent. If

a Thoon infiltrator is within 100 feet, a Thoon thrall can

end its dormancy as a swift action.

Once a Thoon thrall ends its dormancy, it cant return

to a dormant state. Due to overdrive healing, a Thoon

thrall cannot survive out of dormancy for long.

Thrall to Thoon Infiltrator (Ex) A Thoon thrall responds

to the commands of the nearest Thoon infiltrator as if

dominated, with no save allowed.

Overdrive Healing (Su) This ability works like fast healing

5, but a thrall can gain hit points beyond its full normal

hit points as temporary hit points. A thralls skin begins

to blister and swell when this happens, and the thrall

grows visibly larger. Once its temporary hit points equal

or exceed its full normal hit points, a Thoon thrall must

make a save every round or explode (see below).

Immolate (Su) When a Thoon thrall is fully healed and has

temporary hit points equal to or greater than its full

normal hit points, it might explode, its body unable

to contain the energy within. At the end of its turn, if

a Thoon thralls temporary hit points equal or exceed

its full normal hit points, it must succeed on a DC 11

Fortitude save. If it fails, it explodes, dealing 3d6 points of

fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst,

plus an extra 1d6 points of fire damage for each Thoon

infiltrator and additional Thoon thrall within 30 feet

(Reflex DC 11 half). The explosion kills the Thoon thrall.

A Thoon thrall can voluntarily fail this save, but it

does so only on a direct order from a Thoon infiltrator.

Thoon thralls are the foot soldiers of the secret cabals that the

Thoon in ltrators direct. They remain in their humanoid guise

until discovered or ordered into battle, then they undergo a

 nal transformation and go out in a blaze of glory.

The Thoon thrall presented here uses a 1st-level human

Strategies and Tactics

Thoon thralls work well in the company of other Thoon

thralls  and  a  Thoon  infiltrator  to  direct  them.  Beyond

that, theyre straightforward grunts that can take a lot of

punishmentespecially  if  they  get  a  round  or  two  of

overdrive healing before the battle begins.

The most important strategic element to remember about

Thoon thralls is that the Thoon in ltrator that created the

thrall needs to carefully consider whether its worth throwing

away a thrall in a particular battle. A Thoon thrall can take

its true form only once. After it leaves dormancy, overdrive

healing forces it to immolate before long. So, an awakened

thrall is always a dead thrallan expended resource to the

Thoon in ltrator.

Ecology

Unlike the transformation into a Thoon in ltrator, which

completely remakes the creature, the transformation into a

Thoon thrall leaves the creature largely intact. The creature

looks the same, behaves the same, and retains its own free

willunless a Thoon in ltrator is around. A Thoon thrall

must eat, sleep, and breathe as it did before becoming a Thoon

offspring arent Thoon thralls.

Environment:  A  Thoon  thrall  either  continues  to  live

where  it  did  before  its  transformation  or  follows  a  Thoon

in ltrator on a dark errand. A few serve the mind  ayers of

Thoon directly as servants, but the illithids prefer their own

thralls to the explosive ones created by Thoon in ltrators.

Typical Physical Characteristics: When in dormancy,

Thoon thralls are indistinguishable from what they looked

like as humanoids. When they end their dormancy, how-

ever, they begin to grow muscle at a freakish rate, gaining

40 to 50 pounds as they reach the point when they might

immolate.

because they are puppets to their Thoon in ltrator masters,

not because they necessarily behave wick-

since they are forced by Thoon in-

in character classes after becoming

a thrall. They have the same fa-

vored classes as the humanoid

they are created from, un-

less their new alignment

precludes  advancement  in

such classes. In this case,

treat rogue as the thralls favored class.

Senses: A Thoon thrall gains darkvision out to 60 feet if

it doesnt already have better.

Languages: A Thoon thrall can communicate telepathi-

cally with any Thoon in ltrator within 100 feet. It also gains

the following special quality.

Thrall to Thoon In ltrator: A Thoon thrall responds to the

commands of the nearest Thoon in ltrator as if dominated,

any humanoid creature that a Thoon in ltrator could reason-

ably render helpless for 1 minute (referred to hereafter as the

base creature).

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Type: The base creatures type changes to monstrous

humanoid. It does not gain the augmented subtype but

retains other subtypes except those from alignment and

humanoid race.

kills the Thoon thrall.

A Thoon thrall can voluntarily fail this save, but it does

so only on a direct order from a Thoon in ltrator.

AC: A Thoon thrall is slightly more durable than it was

in its previous life. Increase the base creatures natural armor

bonus by 1.

Speed: When not dormant, a Thoon thralls speed increases

by 10 feet in whatever mode the creature most often employs

(usually land speed).

Abilities: The base creatures ability scores are modi ed

as follows: Str +6, Dex +2, Con +2, Wis 2, Cha 4.

112

Special Qualities: A Thoon thrall retains all the special

qualities of the base creature and gains the following special

quality.

Dormancy (Ex): A Thoon thrall spends most of its time in a

dormant state. When it is dormant, a Thoon thralls overdrive

healing doesnt function, and the thrall doesnt move at full

speed. It appears exactly as it did before a Thoon in ltrator

turned it into a Thoon thrall.

As a full-round action, a Thoon thrall can end its dormancy.

Throbbing, veinlike growths emerge from its skin, and the

thralls true nature becomes apparent. If a Thoon in ltrator

is within 100 feet, then a Thoon thrall can end its dormancy

as a swift action.

Once a Thoon thrall ends its dormancy, it cant return to

a  dormant  state.  Due  to  overdrive  healing,  a  Thoon  thrall

cannot survive out of dormancy for long.

Level Adjustment: . Because of the total vulnerability

to Thoon in ltrator domination and the nature of overdrive

healing, Thoon thralls are unsuitable as PCs.

Aspect of Bloody Slaughter (Ex) By expending a swift action

and taking 5 points of damage, a Thoon soldier can

reconfigure its limbs to deal damage to multiple adjacent

foes. When in this aspect, a Thoon soldier can make a

Whirlwind Attack (as the feat) with its arm-blades as a

full-round action, and it can make attacks of opportunity

as if it had the Combat Reflexes feat. A Thoon soldier can

have only one aspect active at a time. When adopting

this aspect, a Thoon soldier says in Undercommon,

Slaughter for Thoon!

Aspect of the Fiery Sun (Ex) By expending a swift action and

taking 5 points of damage, a Thoon soldier can channel

quintessence from its body, creating heat. The Thoon

soldiers melee attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of fire

damage, and creatures that hit it with a natural weapon or

a nonreach melee weapon take 1d6 points of fire damage.

A Thoon soldier can have only one aspect active at a

time. When adopting this aspect, a Thoon soldier says in

Undercommon, All will burn for Thoon!

Aspect of the Impervious Tower (Ex) By expending a swift

action and taking 5 points of damage, a Thoon soldier

can extrude extra armor plates and bolster its magical

defenses. When using this aspect, a Thoon soldier

gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws and a +4

deflection bonus to AC. A Thoon soldier can have only

one aspect active at a time. When adopting this aspect, a

Thoon soldier says in Undercommon, Stand and fight!

Thoon is Thoon!

Aspect of the Ravenous Horde (Ex) By expending a swift

action and taking 5 points of damage, a Thoon soldier

can reconfigure its lower limbs for greater speed and

maneuverability. When in this aspect, a Thoon soldiers

speed increases to 40 feet, and it can make a melee

attack in the middle of its move as if it had the Spring

Attack feat. A Thoon soldier can have only one aspect

active at a time. When adopting this aspect, a Thoon

soldier says in Undercommon, Walk with Thoon!

Aspect of the Death Blossom (Ex) A Thoon soldier has one

final mode it enters if it starts its turn with between 5 and

20 hit points left. By expending a swift action and taking

5 points of damage, a Thoon soldier can reconfigure its

body to explode when destroyed. If destroyed when in

the aspect of the death blossom, a Thoon soldier deals

8d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 40-

foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 15 half). A Thoon soldier can

have only one aspect active at any time. When adopting

this aspect, a Thoon soldier says in Undercommon,

Death blooms in the name of Thoon! Thoon! Thoon!

A Thoon soldier doesnt change out of the aspect of

the death blossom until its fully healed. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Last, of course, comes the aspect of the death

blossom.  PCs  who  ignore  the  ominous  phrase  the

soldier utters might not live to regret their choice.

Ecology

Thoon soldiers are formed within cocoons that must be

supplied with quintessence by the mind  ayers of Thoon.

When a Thoon soldier emerges from a cocoon, it  nds the

nearest mind  ayer and awaits orders.

Thoon soldiers are programmed to return to the co-

coons inside the nautiloid vessel if they enter the aspect

of  the  death  blossom  but  survive  the

battle. Quintessence from the vessels

stores repairs them at a rate of 1 hit

point per day.

Environment: Thoon soldiers form

the best security patrols that the mind  ay-

ers of Thoon have, so theyre as common as

mind  ayers within the nautiloid vessel (or

other base for Thoon followers). Theyre less

common outside, because they attract undue at-

tention  and  require  supervision  from  a  sentient

follower of Thoon.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A Thoon soldier

is 6 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Its armor allows it sur-

prising mobility, and the mutability of its form makes it look

like it is always in motion.

Alignment:  Thoon  soldiers  strictly  follow  their

Thoon soldier

programming, making them neutral.

Thoon soldiers are constructs made in the quintessence-

cocoons of the nautiloid vessel that the mind flayers of

Thoon call home.

Strategies and Tactics

Thoon soldiers are straightforward melee combatants, but

because they can change aspects, they can feel like different

monsters even when you throw multiple Thoon soldiers at

the PCs.

A  Thoon  soldier  instinctively  assesses  the  tactical

situation  at  the  beginning  of  each  turn,  choosing  an

appropriate aspect. In the first round, this is often the

aspect that provides the most maneuverabilityaspect

of the ravenous horde.

Thoon soldiers understand aspect changes on a round-

by-round basis, but unless directed by someone else, they

dont think ahead with regard to aspects. At the begin-

ning of its turn, a Thoon soldier simply picks whichever

aspect is useful at moment. If opponents gang up on it,

it switches to aspect of the fiery sun (against two foes)

or aspect of bloody slaughter (against three or more). A

Thoon soldier uses aspect of the impervious tower when

it senses that spells might deal the most damage during

a particular round.

Advanced Thoon Soldiers

The cocoons do not advance Thoon soldiers on a Hit-Die-

by-Hit-Die basis. Occasionally, a Large 14 HD Thoon soldier

spontaneously emerges from a cocoon. Such a Thoon soldier

is a CR 10 monster.

Launch Spawn (Su) A madcrafter of Thoon usually takes

a full day to give birth to a stormcloud of Thoon or a

scyther of Thoon. When threatened, however, it can

create constructs far more rapidly, then expel them in

globules of caustic spittle. Once per round, as a swift

action, a madcrafter of Thoon can spit a stormcloud of

Thoon or a scyther of Thoon into any unoccupied square

within 60 feet.

The caustic birthing fluid that surrounds the

new construct covers the square the construct

lands in and all adjacent squares. Creatures

in those squares take 6d6 points of acid

damage (Reflex DC 23 half ). For 1 minute

afterward, any creature that steps in a

square covered by acid takes 3d6 points

of acid damage.

A typical madcrafter of Thoon has

enough stored quintessence to safely use

its launch spawn ability twice per day. If it

uses launch spawn a third time, it loses

its fast healing ability for the rest of the

day. The fourth and subsequent times it

uses launch spawn, it takes 20 points of

damage.

Mind Blast (Sp) 60-foot cone, stuns for 3d4

rounds (Will DC 15 negates). Unlike its mind

flayer cousins, a madcrafter of Thoon can use

mind blast only three times per day.

A madcrafter of Thoon is a living factory for

some of the quintessence-fueled constructs

employed by the mind  ayers of Thoon.

Strategies and Tactics

Because  a  madcrafter  of  Thoon  can  create  its  own

allies, its a good choice for a lone monsterbut it wont

be  alone  for  long.  The  swift  action  required  to  launch

spawn doesnt mean that the madcrafter is truly creating

new constructs in the blink of an eye. It instead represents

how the madcrafter can do other tasks during most of the

birthing process.

In combat, a madcrafter of Thoon is strongest if it can

begin at range, launching two spawn in the first 2 rounds

to put some defenders between itself and its foes. If it can

damage  those  adversaries  with  acid  from  the  birthing

fluid,  all  the  better.  Then,  it  assesses  the  tactical  situ-

ation,  using  launch  spawn  even  more  if  opponents  are

overcoming or outmaneuvering its other spawn and if it

can afford to take the damage. It makes melee attacks if

it must, but it prefers to let its constructs fight while it

uses mind blast.

A madcrafter of Thoons biggest weakness is its slow speed.

It is acutely aware that it cant outrun opponents or flee

determined pursuit, so it retreats through narrow passages

that it can cover with acid.

DESIGNING MADCRAFTER ENCOUNTERS

Because the madcrafter of Thoon is essentially a monster that

spawns other monsters, you should be aware of a few special con-

siderations when planning a madcrafter of Thoon encounter.

The first consideration: Madcrafters handle high-level PCs

poorly because they depend on CR 6 monsters to do much

of their dirty work. The CR 10 madcrafter is indeed a suitable

challenge for four 10th-level PCs. But two CR 10 madcrafters

dont challenge four 12th-level PCs in the same way, because

the CR 6 scythers of Thoon just cant hurt the PCs. Nor would

four CR 10 madcrafters challenge a 14th-level group. You can,

however, mix a single madcrafter with other monsters to get

the encounter level you desire.

The second consideration is your own fun at the table. You

can use the madcrafter of Thoon to spawn construct after con-

struct, and if youre tactically minded, you can give the PCs fits

with this monster. Youre the one responsible for tracking all

those monsters, and nobody at the gaming table is having any

fun when it takes you 10 minutes to move your army of con-

structs. Think carefully about how many monsters you want to

be running at a time.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Ecology

Looking  at  them,  its  difficult  to  believe  that  the  mad-

crafters of Thoon were once mind flayers. Contact with

the  Far  Realm  and  Thoon  has  twisted  them  into  the

immense, sluglike creatures they are today.

A madcrafter of Thoon subsists entirely on quintessence.

Because madcrafters of Thoon are slow and vulnerable

out  in  the  world,  other  creatures  gather  quintessence

for them.

Though the madcrafters of Thoon are no longer mind

 ayers, they have a similar life cycle. The asexual madcrafters

give birth to thousands of tadpoles in a spawning pool deep

within the nautiloid vessel (not the same pool the Thoon elder

brain lives in). The tadpoles feast on each other in a frenzy

of cannibalism punctuated by long periods of group torpor.

Eventually, one massive madcrafter of Thoon, grown fat from

consuming its siblings, slithers from the spawning pool and

immediately demands its  rst taste of quintessence.

The madcrafters of Thoon need only quintessence to

survive from that point forward, but they have a vestigial

appetite for sentient brains. They dont derive nutrition from

brains, but a sentient brain sends a madcrafter of Thoon into

 ts of ecstasy. Thoon elder brains and Thoon disciples use

fresh brains as rewards to keep their construct-producing

madcrafters in line.

Environment: A creature that churns out constructs

is valuable, so the mind  ayers of Thoon usually keep the

madcrafters safe in their main base. If an outpost beyond the

nautiloid vessel is safe, the mind  ayers might try to move

a madcrafter of Thoon there, because its useful to have a

construct factory and quintessence repository on site. Still,

doing so is tricky, because the madcrafters are slow and attract

a lot of attention.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  madcrafter  of

Thoon is almost 20 feet long and weighs about ten tons.

Aside from forelimbs and a head, a madcrafters anatomy is

confusing and alien. Its most prominent feature is its oozing,

gaping mouth.

This is a madcrafter of Thoon, a sluglike aberration

that can vomit out constructs.

30  Madcrafters of Thoon used to be mind  ayers, but

they were twisted by contact with the Far Realm.

They retain some of the mind  ayers mental

powers.

35  Madcrafters of Thoon are fueled by a mysterious

substance called quintessence, which the mind

 ayers of Thoon gather for them.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Alignment: Madcrafters of Thoon are neutral evil, but

with a twist. Theyre more lawful when given a regular diet

of quintessence and more chaotic when denied quintessence

or given too many brains to eat.

Society

Alone among the mind  ayers of Thoon, the madcrafters of

Thoon actually consume quintessence. The other followers

of Thoon gather it because Thoon directs them to, and they

covet it for the power it promises. The madcrafters, however,

have a direct connection to quintessence and a craving for

it that sometimes overwhelms their reason. Consequently,

the mind  ayers keep the madcrafters well feda starving

madcrafter lashes out at everyone and does almost anything

to attain more quintessence.

Quintessence isnt the madcrafters only dependency. They

are addicted to the pleasure of eating sentient brains. Even

a madcrafter that feeds on a matrix of quintessence starts

to feel hunger pangs soon afterward, never feeling sated by

quintessence consumption. If given a sentient brain, however,

it might be lost in pleasure for hours, its hunger for quintes-

sence forgotten.

Advanced Madcrafters of Thoon

The mind  ayers of Thoon dont have any madcrafters with

more than 10 Hit Diceyet. Some Thoon disciples theo-

rize that feeding a madcrafter of Thoon a large amount of

quintessence might cause it to grow, perhaps exponentially.

The  Thoon  elder  brain  is  considering  more  aggressive

quintessence-gathering  to  experiment  with  overfeeding  a

madcrafter of Thoon.

Illumination As long as at least two other scythers

of Thoon are within 30 feet, the glowing eyes

of a scyther shed light in a 60-foot cone and

provide shadowy illumination in a 120-foot

cone. A scyther of Thoon can close its eyes

to douse the illumination, but doing so

leaves it blind.

A scyther of Thoon that has only

one other scyther within range still

has glowing eyes, but those eyes

provide only a 20-foot radius of

bright illumination and a 40-foot

radius of shadowy illumination.

A scyther of Thoon by itself

has faintly glowing eyes that

provide shadowy illumination

in a 5-foot radius.

Natural Healing (Ex) A scyther

of Thoon is capable of

natural healing, albeit very

slowly. A scyther of Thoon

heals 1 hit point for every 8

hours it remains motionless.

Searing Light (Sp) A scyther of Thoon can focus its

glowing eyes to emit a damaging beam of light

that functions as a searing light spell; at will; +8

ranged touch; caster level 6th. Unlike the spell,

a scyther of Thoons searing light deals an extra

1d8 points of damage for each scyther of Thoon

within 30 feet (maximum 5d8), including the scyther

emitting the searing light.

After one scyther of Thoon has used searing light, the

glowing eyes of any others within 30 feet dim briefly, and

none of those creatures can use searing light during the

same round.

Dispelling Touch (Su) With a successful melee touch attack,

a scyther of Thoon can wipe away spells and magical

effects. This ability functions as a targeted dispel magic

spell (caster level 6th). Against each ongoing spell

currently in effect on the object or creature touched, a

scyther makes a dispel check at +6 against a DC of 11 +

the spells caster level.

Each time a scyther of Thoon uses dispelling touch, it

takes 10 points of damage.

Scythers of Thoon are constructs vomited forth by mad-

crafters of Thoon. They serve as foot soldiers to advance the

cause of Thoon.

Strategies and Tactics

Scythers of Thoon are best used in groups with other

scythers, when theyre strongest and most interesting.

The most common tactic for a group of scythers is to have

all but one rush into melee, while the remaining scyther

uses searing light against a target that is either about to drop

or cant be attacked by other scythers in melee.

Without  a  sentient  mind  to  guide  them,  scythers  of

spells the PCs are using and whether its worthwhile to

Ecology

After  being  given  enough  quintessence  and  metal  ore,

madcrafters  of  Thoon  spit  out  scythers  that  then  await

orders from any telepathic creature of Thoon (usually a mind

 ayer). Unlike Thoon hulks and Thoon soldiers, scythers of

Thoon dont need to return to their parent to healthey

do so naturally.

Environment:  Most  scythers  of  Thoon  are  kept  in

squads of four to six within the mind flayers base, but

outside the nautiloid vessel. Scythers are plentiful, so mind

 ayers often order a pair of scythers to follow them around

as menial servants.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A scyther of Thoon

is 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. It relaxes its lower

arms when walking, giving it a lumbering gait, but it uses

both arms to swing its scythes in combat.

Alignment: Scythers of Thoon are neutral, with behavior

solely dependent on their programming and orders.

Advanced Scythers of Thoon

As with stormclouds of Thoon, madcrafters of Thoon dont

regurgitate scythers that have any more than 8 Hit Dice.

Advanced madcrafters of Thoon might give birth to stronger

scythers of Thoon.

Tremorsense (Ex) A stormcloud of Thoon must bury one

of its tentacles a few inches under the ground for its

tremorsense to function. Doing so is a swift action, but

a stormcloud loses tremorsense if it moves out of the

square in which it set the tentacle.

Natural Healing (Ex) Unlike most constructs, a stormcloud

of Thoon is capable of natural healing, albeit very slowly.

A stormcloud of Thoon heals 1 hit point for every 8 hours

Levitative Movement (Ex) Even when the creature uses its

land speed, the body of a stormcloud of Thoon is actually

floating about 5 feet off the ground, propelled by an

unseen force. A stormcloud of Thoons tentacles dont

need to touch the ground when moving, and the creature

is unaffected by difficult or hazardous terrain.

When a stormcloud of Thoon flies more than 5 feet

above the ground, its speed slows dramatically.

10 points of damage whenever it does so.

Skills A stormcloud of Thoon has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use

the run action when swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

Stormclouds of Thoon, constructs birthed by madcrafters

of Thoon, are  oating sentinels that are adept at locating

quintessence sources and spotting the enemies of the mind

This egg-shaped construct is a stormcloud of

Thoon. It is a creation of the mind  ayers.

25  A sect called the mind  ayers of Thoon uses

stormclouds of Thoon to scout for brains and

gather a substance called quintessence. The

construct is a capable melee combatant, and it can

emit a lightning bolt seemingly at will.

30  A stormcloud of Thoon is immune to acid. It has

the ability to heal naturally, unlike most constructs.

This healing happens slowly, however.

Strategies and Tactics

and wont go out of their way to help or harm others unless

A stormcloud of Thoon is a useful creature to mix into a

group of shadow flayers, Thoon soldiers, or scythers

of  Thoon.  It  adds  some  detection  abilities  and

a  ranged  area  attack  that  those  mon-

sters lack. A stormcloud of Thoons

lightning  bolt  comes  at  a  price,

however, so its better as a melee

combatant than as a magic ar-

tillery piece.

In battle, a stormcloud of

Thoon  oats near the melee

combatants, attacking with

its tentacles but remain-

ing  alert  for  foes  who

group  in  clusters  or

lines.  If  it  can  hit

three or more oppo-

nents with a lightning

bolt, it moves into posi-

tion to do so.

Ecology

Stormclouds  of

Thoon  are  creat-

ed  by  mad crafters  of

Thoon.  Storm clouds

range  farther  from  the

mind  ayer base than oth-

er constructs. Its easy for

a  mad crafter  of  Thoon  to

regurgitate  a  storm cloud  of

Thoon,  so  the  mind  flayers  of

Thoon arent overly concerned when

enemies destroy a stormcloud. The illithids

dont send their stormclouds of Thoon too far

afield simply because the ovoid constructs can

reveal the mind flayers presence.

Environment:  Stormclouds  of  Thoon  can  travel  with

ease over most kinds of terrain. Even when technically using

their land speed or swimming, theyre actually  oating, so

underwater depths, muck- lled swamps, and dif cult terrain

pose no barrier to their travels.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  stormcloud  of

Thoon floats about 4 feet above the ground. Its tentacles

are about 6 feet long on average, and it weighs about 100

pounds. Eyelike structures form a radial pattern on the

front of its egg-shaped head. The tentacles that protrude

in a jumble from the bottom of a stormclouds head serve

a variety of functions.

Alignment: Stormclouds of Thoon are neutral evil, but

that alignment represents more their casual willingness

to perform evil deeds for their masters than an innate,

supernatural evil. Stormclouds have only a rudimentary

sense of right and wrongthey just do what theyre told

directed to do so.

Society

Unlike  most  constructs,  storm-

clouds  of  Thoon  are  fully

sentient. Even so, theyre dull-

ards  in  a  community  of  evil

geniuses, so they rarely put their

intellects to much use.

Socially, a stormcloud of

Thoon is a very passive crea-

ture. Among the mind  ayers of

Thoon, everyone else is smarter

than  a  stormcloud  and  capa-

ble  of  ordering  it  around.  As

a result, stormclouds of Thoon

usually dont communicate or

interact  beyond  whats  re-

quired to accomplish their

assigned tasks.

Stormclouds of Thoon

blame their limited intel-

lect  for  their  incomplete

understanding  of  the  will

of  Thoon,  not  realizing  that

the Thoon elder brain and the

Thoon disciples might likewise be

in the dark about the larger pur-

pose behind Thoon veneration and

quintessence-gathering.

Stormcloud

of Thoon

Out in the field, however, a storm-

cloud of Thoon can put its sentience to use,

assessing the risks in each encounter before

rushing  headlong  into  battle.  Mind  flayers

often  put  stormclouds  of  Thoon  in  charge  of

scythers  of  Thoon  or  even  Thoon  soldiers.  If

something unusual happens, a stormcloud tries to think

of  the  best  response  rather  than  mindlessly  executing

programming.

Advanced Stormclouds of Thoon

Madcrafters of Thoon dont create stormclouds of Thoon that

have any more than 8 Hit Dice. No stormcloud of Thoon has

gained Hit Dice, but the mind  ayers are waiting for stronger

versions of the construct to evolve.

Some mind flayers believe that stronger madcrafters of

Thoon might create stronger stormclouds of Thoon and

scythers of Thoon, so the secret to an advanced stormcloud

is to create an advanced madcrafter. Other illithids think

that  since  stormclouds  of  Thoon  are  actually  sentient,

it might be worthwhile to teach them skills (which you

can model with class levels in classes such as fighter and

rogue). Thoon disciples are awaiting the guidance of Thoon

on this matter.

Defense Overdrive (Ex) As an immediate action, a Thoon

hulk can gain a +2 bonus on saving throws for 1 round.

Using this ability deals 10 points of damage to the Thoon

hulk. If a Thoon hulk uses this ability, its attack overdrive

ends immediately.

Critical Knockback (Ex) If a Thoon hulk threatens a critical

hit with its arm-axes, its target flies back 10 feet in a

straight line away from the Thoon hulk, landing prone.

The Thoon hulk chooses the path, but that path must

be away from the Thoon hulk in as direct a path as

possible. Intervening obstacles shorten or prevent

the knockback. The Thoon hulk still rolls to confirm

the threat, dealing appropriate damage depending on

whether the threat is confirmed.

Attack Overdrive (Ex) As a swift action, a Thoon hulk can

gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for 1

round. Using this ability deals 10 points of damage to the

Thoon hulk. If a Thoon hulk uses this ability, its defense

overdrive ends immediately.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a Thoon hulk must hit

a creature of up to Huge size with a tentacle attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and

attaches a tentacle to the opponents head. A Thoon

hulk can grab a Gargantuan or larger creature, but only

if it can somehow reach the foes head. If a Thoon hulk

begins its turn with at least one tentacle attached, it

can try to attach its remaining tentacles with a single

grapple check. The opponent can escape

instantly killing that creature. Constructs,

elementals, oozes, plants, and undead are

Born  of  Thoon-inspired  f leshcrafting

within the mind flayers nautiloid vessel,

Thoon  hulks  are  pitiless  brutes  that

obey their illithid masters telepathic

commands.

Strategies and Tactics

The Thoon hulk is a brute that makes

it a good complement to mind  ayers.

Thoon hulks make up the vanguard of

a mind  ayer assault.

Mind  f layers  (including  Thoon

disciples and shadow flayers) also take ad-

vantage of the Thoon hulks immunity to

stunning. Thoon hulks can stand wherev-

er they want and not worry about whether

theyre getting in the way of a mind flayers mind blast.

This makes them effective defenders to shield their mind

flayer masters.

In melee combat, a Thoon hulks favorite technique is

to grapple with tentacles and extract brains in time-hon-

ored mind  ayer fashion.

Ecology

As constructs, Thoon hulks dont eat, sleep, or breathe. But

unlike more mechanical creations, Thoon hulks have an

innate desire to keep moving. This trait makes them poor

guards for lengthy assignments in enclosed spaces, although

they do well when given patrol duty along a path at least a

few hundred yards long.

Unlike mind  ayers, Thoon hulks cant derive sustenance

from the brains they extract. They take brains back to the

nautiloid vessel if they contain quintessence, or give them

to the nearest mind  ayer if ordered to do so.

A Thoon hulk emerges from its cocoon with three arms.

Two have axelike blades attached to them, and the third is

clawed. Thoon hulks dont use their clawed hands in combat,

although they can pick up items, open doors, and manipulate

objects with them.

Environment: Cocoonlike structures within the nauti-

loids inner chambers create Thoon hulks from quintessence,

carefully crafted metal parts, and vivisected bodies of mind

 ayers that the Thoon elder brain found unworthy.

Damaged Thoon hulks are returned to the cocoons, where

they heal 1 hit point per day.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A Thoon hulk is 10 feet

tall, but it looks shorter because it is usually hunched over. It

weighs 1,000 pounds, and its masses of bulging muscle and

deadly arm-axes clearly set it apart from normal mind  ayers.

Bits and pieces of a Thoon hulk look like mind  ayer  esh,

but metal components are a major part of its anatomy.

Dual Action (Ex) A Thoon elder brain is a creature made

up of multiple minds, all touched by the unreality of the

Far Realm. Make two initiative checks for the creature.

The higher result represents a mental action turn, and

the lower result is used for a physical action turn. This

means a Thoon elder brain can do more in a single round

than most creatures. For example, it could perform an

overmind blast (a purely mental action) on initiative

count 17, then move and make a tentacle attack (a

physical action) on initiative count 12. These initiative

counts can change if a Thoon elder brain readies an

action or delays to let its other half go first.

Acid Burn (Ex) The acid delivered by a Thoon elder brains

brains physical action turns, the acid deals 4d6 points

of acid damage to any creature the Thoon elder brain hit

with a tentacle attack during the previous round. The

damage is always 4d6 points, regardless of how many

times the Thoon elder brain hit the creature.

Confusion Sphere (Su) A Thoon elder brain can scramble the

thoughts of nearby creatures. This ability functions like a

confusion spell (CL 15th, Will DC 22 negates), except that

all creatures (except for creatures of Thoon) within a 10-

foot radius centered on the Thoon elder brain are subject

to the effect. The effect lasts 15 rounds, but it cannot end

for an affected creature when that creature is still within

10 feet of the Thoon elder brain. At the beginning of each

affected creatures turn, roll on the table below.

Overmind Blast (Su) A Thoon elder brain can project the

horror of its consciousness against a single foe within

100 feet. That target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save

or take 2d6 points of Wisdom damage. Though overmind

blast isnt a fear effect, a creature that has immunity to

fear or a save bonus against fear receives a +4 bonus on

the saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A creature that is reduced to 0 Wisdom by an over mind

blast is unconscious, but its body mutters, Thoon . . .

Thoon . . .  repeatedly until consciousness returns.

A Thoon elder brain is an elder brain that has been twisted

by its time in the Far Realm and now leads the mind  ayers

of Thoon.

Strategies and Tactics

A Thoon elder brain is best used as a climactic encounterthe

big, bad monster at the end of an adventure. By the time the PCs

reach a Thoon elder brain, they should have fought their way

past dozens of mind  ayers and other creatures of Thoon.

A Thoon elder brains tactics depend on whether it believes

one or more foes to be vulnerable to its powers of domination.

If so, the elder brain uses each of its mental actions to order

an opponent to turn on that foes allies. If this tactic fails

twice, the Thoon elder brain abandons it.

Its tactics also depend on the number of opponents. If a

Thoon elder brain is beset by multiple foes in melee, it uses

its confusion sphere to disrupt its opponents tactics and its

tentacles to damage anyone who isnt confused. In situations

when a Thoon elder brain has allies or is facing only a few

adversaries, it uses its overmind blast from a safe distance.

With its physical action, it readies a tentacle attack in case a

foe moves within reach.

Ecology

Like a traditional mind  ayer elder brain, a Thoon elder brain

subsists on tadpolelike immature mind  ayers. Also, like all

creatures of Thoon, it requires distilled quintessence on a

weekly basis, or it slowly starves.

Environment: The sole known example of a Thoon elder

brain has spent its entire existence  oating within a briny

pool in a central chamber of the Thoon nautiloid. However,

if a Thoon elder brain reproduces itself, any underground

environment is appropriate. A Thoon elder brain is always

near mind  ayers and other creatures of Thoon.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A Thoon elder brain

is 8 feet across and weighs about 800 pounds. Its tentacles

reach a length of almost 20 feet. Its dif cult for a Thoon elder

brain to uncurl its tentacles completely, so its effective reach

is only 10 feet.

A Thoon elder brain doesnt visibly age. Sometimes indi-

vidual tentacles atrophy and wither away, but theyre quickly

replaced with fresh, quintessence-fueled limbs.

Alignment:  A  Thoon  elder  brain  is  neutral  evil,  as  are

most followers of Thoon. Its efforts to gather quintessence

without regard for the costs to others are unapologetically

evil. It keeps its followers tightly organized among themselves

(a lawful trait), but it can behave unpredictably and without

a clear long-term plan (a hallmark of chaos).

Society

Just one Thoon elder brain currently exists. Its the one that

leads the mind  ayers of Thoon from place to place, searching

out new sources of quintessence.

In most respects, a Thoon elder brain behaves like a tradi-

tional mind  ayer elder brain. Its imperious, brilliant, and

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

AN ELDER BRAIN AT CR 15?

Both Lords of Madness and Underdark have statistics for a mind

flayer elder brain. Its a fine monster, but its CR 25, which limits

how many campaigns can use itits difficult to build an ad-

venture in which both CR 8 mind flayers and their CR 25 leader

pose appropriate challenges.

The Thoon elder brain occupies encounter-design space closer

to the rank-and-file mind flayer. Because it relies on a smaller

set of psionic abilities, its also easier for a DM to run.

The existence of this elder brain doesnt necessarily mean that

a CR 25 elder brain that goes to the Far Realm comes back at

CR 15. Whatever a Thoon elder brain was before it returned to

the Far Realm is beyond the realm of PC knowledge.

You can certainly file off the serial numbers, so to speak, and

use a Thoon elder brain as a normal mind flayer elder brain. If

you want both sorts of elder brains in your game, you can posit

that Thoon elder brains lead smaller mind flayer colonies, and

the elder brains described in Lords of Madness and Underdark

lead vast mind flayer cities.

utterly con dent in its abilities. However, it has been touched

by the Far Realm, so it sometimes behaves in strange ways,

telepathically broadcasting gibberish or making arbitrary

decisions that seem to make quintessence-gathering more

difficult. Whether the Thoon elder brain is irrational or

merely several moves ahead of everyone else is an unan-

spanning many level ranges.

Spy  Ring  (EL  7):  A  Thoon  in ltrator  and  two  Thoon

thralls are the mind  ayers  rst foothold in a community.

They keep a low pro le, but part of their mandate is to learn

all they can about powerful travelers passing through town.

The Thoon in ltrator might decide to preemptively attack

the characters before they can become a threat, or perhaps

the PCs interrupt the in ltrator in the midst of spawning a

Intruder Response Team (EL 11): The PCs have been

detected near a Thoon stronghold. Four scythers of Thoon

and a Thoon soldier receive telepathic orders: Destroy any

intruders they  nd. None of the constructs is particularly

subtle,  although  one  of  the  scythers  stays  back  and  aims

searing light at an unengaged character.

Birthing Suite (EL 11): In a large, oval room, a madcrafter

of Thoon is processing quintessence while a Thoon soldier

stands guard. The Thoon soldier rushes into melee combat

when the PCs enter, and the madcrafter retreats, launching

spawn. It then unleashes a mind blast or two at the characters.

If the PCs engage the madcrafter in melee or start to gain

the upper hand against the Thoon soldier, the madcrafter

123

launches more spawn and continues to use mind blast with

its standard action until it is no longer capable of doing so.

War Patrol (EL 12): A Thoon disciple and two Thoon

soldiers are searching for enemies. If the disciple thinks

they can defeat the PCs, it directs the Thoon soldiers into

melee and starts using mind blast (which the Thoon soldiers

are immune to) in the ensuing battle. If the Thoon disciple

is near death, it retreats, ordering any remaining Thoon

soldiers to cover its escape. The Thoon soldiers  ght until

Brain Patrol (EL 14): A Thoon hulk and two normal mind

 ayers  (MM  186)  are  hunting  for  any  sentient  creatures,

intending to claim their brains. Lately, the followers of Thoon

have been unable to  nd a suf cient supply of brains, so not

only are these creatures hunting out in the open with little

regard for secrecy, they are reckless and exceptionally danger-

ous. The mind  ayers lurk well behind the Thoon hulk, so

the PCs might not know theyre facing multiple enemies at

 rst. Tactics are simple: The mind  ayers use mind blast, and

the Thoon hulk grapples. If their adversaries seem reasonably

subdued, the mind  ayers attempt to extract the brain of any

creature a Thoon hulk is grappling.

 ayers are defeated, the Thoon hulk  ghts until destroyed.

everyone near the Thoon elder brain.

The Thoon elder brain was an immature elder

brain when it crossed over into the Far Realm.

It came back twisted by that place of madness,

devoted to a mysterious force named Thoon. Since

then, it has commanded a nautiloid vessel across

the planes, searching for a mysterious substance

called quintessence.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

intruders arrive, they see only one Thoon hulk and two Thoon

disciples. The Thoon elder brain lurks in the background,

then reveals itself at a dramatic point in the battle, rising

from its briny pool.

The chamber itself is circular, with a high ceiling and a

recessed area encircling the pool. A narrow passageway leads

in, allowing the Thoon hulk to block the way with its body

to buy some time for the others. The Thoon disciples cast

spells, and the elder brain uses overmind blast and its spell-like

abilities. When the elder brain leaves its pool and gets close

to the PCs, the Thoon disciples move behind it to heal it.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Thoon disciples and shadow  ayers have standard treasure, as

do Thoon in ltrators and Thoon thralls (though in ltrators

usually take any appealing items away from thralls). Thoon

hulks, Thoon soldiers, stormclouds of Thoon, and scythers

of Thoon dont have any wealth of their own, but they are

often assigned duties that put them near treasure; generate

standard treasure for them in this case.

Madcrafters of Thoon are incapable of going out to acquire

wealth,  but  many  followers  of  Thoon  pay  them  tribute.

Shadow   ayers  and  Thoon  disciples  that  want  servants  of

their own might trade treasure or fresh brains to a madcrafter

willing to create one. Madcrafters have standard treasure.

Mind  ayers of Thoon maintain a large treasure hoard that

can be found near the Thoon elder brain. Art items in the

treasure hoard have twice the value indicated on page 55 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide. Because the mind  ayers of Thoon

have been traveling across the planes gathering quintessence,

their hoard is a good place to introduce particularly weird,

other worldly treasures, such as strangely marked coinage,

bizarre and disturbing art, and magic items with ornamenta-

tion that is clearly of extraplanar origin.

The value of quintessenceto anyone except the follow-

ers of Thoonis deliberately left vague. This doesnt have

to remain true in your campaign, however. Perhaps quintes-

sence can be used as a substitute for experience points in

item and construct creation. Quintessence could instead

be  a  material  component  for  new  spells  or  rituals  you

introduce into your campaign, or it could be an optional

component that makes certain types of magic more potent.

Items and constructs created using quintessence can have

weird quirks and drawbacks. Spells cast using it are bizarre

or take on aberrant aspects. The moral implications of using

a material gathered from innocent (or not) sentient creatures

also comes into play. If you use quintessence in one or more

of these ways, or make it valuable at all, consider that value

when assigning treasure to encounters you create using the

followers of Thoon.

THOON IN EBERRON

Many mind  ayers built a nautiloid vessel and somehow

found their way back to Xoriat, the Realm of Madness.

They also managed to return to Eberron. The journey itself

is supposed to be impossible, so many of the great powers of

Eberron (the Inspired, the dragons, and the Lords of Dust, for

starters) want to know how the mind  ayers of Thoon accom-

plished the journey. What the mind  ayers met on Xoriat is

also a mystery that other powers might like to unravel.

Thoon could be a daelkyr overlord so powerful as to nearly

be a god. This mysterious entity could instead be another

creature  oating on the insane currents of Xoriats layers. Or

Thoon could be a philosophical mission initiated by some

entity, chance contact, or dark force awakening on Xoriat.

Regardless of the truth, the mind  ayers of Thoon are a

dire threat to Eberron. Their beliefs could spread through

Khyber, emboldening the forces of madness. If the doctrine

of Thoon spreads wide enough, and enough quintessence is

gathered, the return of Xoriat might be close behind.

THOON IN FAERN

Shortly after the most recent appearance of an avatar of

Ilsensine (Expanded Psionics Handbook 222) in the grand and

highly religious illithid city of Oryndoll (Underdark 168), an

adventurous band of mind  ayers from the Loretaker creed

left the Lowerdark on a pilgrimage to the Cavern of Thought

on the  endish plane of Deep Caverns. Whether they arrived

in Ilsensines abode is unknown, a fact none of the pilgrims

now con rm or deny. They brought back with them the belief

in Thoon, a doctrine seen as heretical by the orthodox clergy

of the illithid deity in Oryndoll. So the followers of Thoon,

outcast  from  their  home  city,  now  travel  the  Underdark,

occasionally raiding the surface, searching for quintessence

and spreading the philosophy of Thoon.

INTRODUCING THOON INTO YOUR GAME

The mind flayers of Thoon crave quintessence above all else,

and the machinations they undertake to fill their matrices might

bring them into conflict with the PCs.

Most campaigns involving Thoon introduce the mind flayers

and  their  servitors  in  one  of  two  ways:  Low-level  campaigns

start with Thoon infiltrators and their thralls, while mid-level

campaigns confront the mind flayers and their more powerful

creations directly.

THE LOW-LEVEL THOON CAMPAIGN

If  youre  introducing  Thoon  to  your  low-level  game,  here  are

some seeds for possible adventures.

A small frontier village has repulsed a large band of orc ma-

rauders.  Scattered  reports  from  the  frontier  indicate  that

some villagers exploded after being affected by strange mag-

ic. The characters are sent to investigate the villageright

into the arms of a Thoon in ltrator, a lurking stormcloud of

Thoon, and several Thoon thralls. The stormcloud of Thoon

senses quintessence within the PCs, but the characters move

out  of  range  after  only  1  roundbefore  its  clear  which  of

them contains quintessence. Because the in ltrator doesnt

want  to  reveal  itself,  it  directs  its  Thoon  thralls  to  cause

havoc  near  its  lair,  hoping  to  attract  attention.  Meanwhile,

it sends its most trusted thrall to join the party, spreading

rumors of a reward if someone can put an end to the dis-

turbance. When the PCs near the lair, all the thralls converge,

and the traitor reveals its true nature.

Following the trail of a questing high-level paladin theyre sup-

posed to deliver a message to, the characters  nd a cave with

several slain mind  ayers and  ve egglike containersmatrices

of quintessence, which neither the PCs nor the paladin have

heard of. If the characters take the matrices, a recovery team of

in ltrators and thralls starts to shadow them, attacking when-

ever its inconvenient for the party. The followers of Thoon

dont reveal their purpose, leaving the PCs to wonder, Who

are these guys who keep attacking us? And why?

well.  When  they  confront  the  master  alchemist,  the  mind

 ayers waiting in the wings reveal themselves.

THE MID-LEVEL THOON CAMPAIGN

The simplest way to introduce the mind flayers of Thoon to a

mid-level party is to include a group of them at an adventure

site, where the aberrations are engaged in some quintessence-

gathering. Beyond the most obvious way, here are a couple of

adventure  seeds  for  mid-level  characters  capable  of  tussling

with the mind flayers of Thoon.

Members of an extended family of nobles start disappearing,

and the PCs must  gure out whos kidnapping them, then

rescue them. The kidnappers are mind  ayers that have dis-

covered that the familys bloodline is rich in quintessence.

Rather  than  harvest  quintessence  from  the  nobles  directly,

they  plan  to  mentally  enslave  them,  then  arti cially  breed

hundreds morea quintessence herd.

A dwarf stronghold has been overwhelmed by mind  ayers

and their servitors, and a few refugees beg the characters to

liberate their home. Most dwarves survived the mind  ayer

takeover, and theyre being forced to mine quintessence-rich

ore from caverns underneath the stronghold.

SUBSEQUENT EXPOSITION

Once youve introduced the followers of Thoon, the players and

their characters should get curious about what all this Thoon

and quintessence stuff is. Its okay if the players (and char-

acters) dont know exactly what theyre facing. Youre trying to

evoke  a  sense  of  weirdnessa  What  is  the  deal  with  these

guys? feeling among your players.

But  once  youve  evoked  that  feeling,  the  PCs  are  bound  to

employ  everythingresearch  to  interrogation  to  divination

spellsto  learn  more  about  these  strange  creatures.  Thats

good. An explanation at this point helps ground the followers

of Thoon in the world and makes subsequent encounters with

them more interesting. You dont need to hand a full description

of Thoon to the characters on a silver platter, but if they make

reasonable inquiries, they get reasonable information back. The

various lore sidebars throughout this section have high DCs

the mind flayers have many means to guard their secrets, to be

surebut it makes for a better game if the characters eventually

learn the true nature of what theyre fighting.

A Thoon in ltrator disguised as a master alchemist gives the

PCs a magic ankh capable of detecting quintessence (func-

tionally giving the Sense Quintessence feat to a spellcasting

character), then sends them out on a series of missions to

gather it. Eventually the characters might grow suspicious of

where  all  the  quintessence  is  goingespecially  when  they

notice that some people have quintessence within them as

MOCKERY BUGS

Mockery bugs are a strain of magical beasts descended from

ankhegs. They come in two formsthe mockery monarch

and its dreadful progeny, mockery drones.

MOCKERY MONARCH

An immense silvery insect turns toward you, its bloated abdomen

dragging on the ground. Six slender legs support its segmented

body. Its mandibles are large, but they are nothing compared to its

cavernous mouth. The creature eyes you with an air that suggests

Consume Language (Su) When a mockery monarch

consumes a humanoid, it gains the ability to understand

languages that humanoid spoke. It retains understanding

of those languages but cannot speak them.

Spell Turning (Su) Spells and spell-like abilities that

specifically target a mockery monarch are reflected back

on their casters as if affected by a spell turning spell.

Effect and area spells are not affected, nor are touch

spells. This ability has no maximum number of spell

levels it can turn.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a mockery monarch

must hit an opponent smaller than itself with a bite.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Swallow Whole (Ex) A mockery monarch can swallow a

grappled opponent smaller than itself by making a

successful grapple check.

A swallowed creature takes 1d6+5 points of

bludgeoning damage and 5 points of acid damage per

round it spends in the mockery monarchs abdomen.

A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a

light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of

damage to the abdomen (AC 15). Once the creature

exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed

opponent must cut its own way out.

A Large mockery monarchs abdomen can hold 2

Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller

opponents.

Spawn Mockery Drone (Su) A humanoid reduced to 0 or

fewer hit points when inside a mockery monarchs

abdomen becomes a mockery drone. The spawned

mockery drone emerges from the mockery monarchs

abdomen at the beginning of the monarchs next turn.

Although a mockery drone looks like the consumed

humanoid, it is actually a new creature with none of the

consumed humanoids abilities. Mockery drones are not

enslaved to the monarch, but they are loyal to it.

Mockery monarchs are clever insectile

magical beasts that want to spawn

as many mockery drones as

they can. They lack the

ability to speak, but

they  are  curious

Mockery monarch

about sentient humanoids, consuming them and creating

progeny that appear intelligent but are not much smarter

than animals.

Strategies and Tactics

Mockery monarchs are wise enough to live near civilized

places and shrewd enough to hide themselves well. They

then  pick  off  humanoids  that  stray  off  beaten  paths  or

travel  alone.  Each  victim  becomes  a  mockery  drone,

which the mockery monarch uses to lure prey and other

humanoids to it.

Older mockery monarchs are even more insidious, having

learned tactics that draw humanoids in rather than scaring

them off. It might leave a clue that a missing child entered

the sewer near its lair, or it could kill livestock and leave

signs of a mundane ankheg attack. Such a crafty mockery

monarch usually amasses a large number of drones before

it is found out and hunted down.

Despite  their  intelligence,  mockery  monarchs  have

straightforward tactics. They bite and grab as often as possible,

swallowing every humanoid they can successfully grapple.

For defense, they simply rely on their hard carapaces and

the weird energy surrounding them that deflects spells

and weapons.

MOCKERY DRONE

The shopkeeper turns toward you, a silly grin on his face. Heres

your change. Heres your change! he says, his voice rising to a

shout. Then, in a spout of blood, his face detaches from his skull and

leaps toward you, propelled by a centipedelike body with foot-long

spines. Heres . . . your . . . change! shouts the centipede with the

shopkeepers face as it scuttles your way.

Barbs (Su) Any opponent that touches a mockery drone,

strikes it with a natural weapon, strikes it with a nonreach

melee weapon, or grapples it takes 5 points of piercing

and slashing damage from the creatures barbs. A foe can

take damage from this ability only once per turn.

Humanoid Seeming (Ex) When born, a mockery drone

looks like a Medium or Small humanoid. But the

mockery drone is actually an insectile creature living

inside that humanoids skin and animating it from

within. When inside a humanoid form, a mockery

drone doesnt have its natural attacks or a climb speed,

and its barbs are ineffective since theyre inside the

humanoid body.

As a swift action, a mockery drone can burst from

the humanoids head, retaining the face but discarding

the rest of the body. The mockery drone bursts forth

as soon as it senses danger. If the humanoid body is

struck before the mockery drone can burst forth, that

body can take 10 points of damage before the mockery

drone is harmed.

Spit Acid (Ex) Once every 6 hours, as a standard action, a

mockery drone can spit acid in a 60-foot line, dealing

10d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 22 half). The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Skills Mockery drones have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even

if rushed or threatened. Mockery drones have a +8 racial

bonus on Disguise checks made to fool others who see

them, but do not hear them speak.

A mockery drone lives a confusing and often brief life. Its

born in a humanoid form but without coherent memories,

skills, or language. It has an instinctive desire to bring

other humanoids closer to the mockery monarch, but it isnt

smart enough to think of sophisticated ways to accomplish

this task.

Strategies and Tactics

Mockery drones stay near their monarch, but the monarch

sometimes sends them forth to gather more fodder. Drones on

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Mockery  monarchs  have  no  other  monarchs  as

companions, but loyal mockery drones usually

surround them.

Town Idiots (EL 11+): A mockery mon-

arch has converted all the inhabitants of a

hamlet into mockery drones. Any visitor

immediately  notices  that  everyone  in

town has been rendered smilingly idi-

otic, with people carrying empty pails

from the well, a town crier repeating,

Midnight and alls well in the middle

of the day, and a woodcutter splitting

the same log until its mere splinters.

When  confused  or  discovered,  the

mockery  drones  attack,  and  two  or

more are always together. The charac-

ters have multiple  ghts with mockery

drones before they  gure out that the

mockery monarch is in a cellar beneath

the inn.

Mockery Seekers (EL 15): A mock-

ery  monarch  has  just  moved  into  the

ruins  of  an  ancient  border  keep  near

several small settlements, and it already

has four drones with it. Members of a

shadowy organization have designs on

turning the mockery monarch to their

despicable purposes. Perhaps they are

under the mistaken impression that it

can create secret agents for them, or may-

be they know it can convert normal folk

into dangerous creatures. One way or an-

other, the organizations agents are willing

to use underhanded means to  nd the mockery

monarch and secure its cooperation, including kidnapping

innocents to hand over to the beast. The PCs have to defend

the area against the agents and the mockery monarch.

ECOLOGY

A tiny fraction of ankheg eggs produce mockery monarchs.

A newborn mockery monarch usually leaves the nest as

soon as it can.

Seemingly produced by magic worked on ankhegs, mock-

ery monarchs look like their lesser kin. But the resemblance

is deceiving. From their intellect to their re ective exoskel-

etons, mockery monarchs show some of the side effects of

eldritch energy gone awry.

Luckily for the world at large, mockery monarchs are

sterile. They cant mate with ankhegs or other mockery

monarchs, so they have no biological drive to  nd others of

Mockery drone

such  a  mission  usually  wander  around  until  they  attract

someones attention. They then meander back toward the

monarch, hoping to lead their pursuers into its waiting

mandibles. Though not very bright, mockery drones do have

a feel for when someone recognizes their humanoid form,

and they use this ability to their advantage. Some people who

follow a relative who is acting strangely end up becoming

new drones.

When it senses danger, a mockery drone bursts out of the

head of its humanoid form, revealing itself for the monster

it is. It keeps the humanoid face, however, and continues to

speak in repetitive or nonsensical phrases as it battles what-

ever threatened it. A mockery drone spits acid at enemies

at its  rst opportunity. Then it enters melee combat, using

Power Attack in the beginning, trying to take out opponents

as quickly as possible. If it misses repeatedly when using

their kind or to remain among their bestial relatives. Their

only urge is to  nd and consume humanoids and to create

mockery drones.

Mockery  monarchs  can  go  a  long  time  without  food,

and they can travel far without being seen. Their burrows

produce tunnels only if they choose to create such openings,

so its easy for a mockery monarch to arrive undetected in a

civilized area and set up a central nest. Then the monarch

goes to work converting citizens into mockery drones.

Mockery drones are incapable of reproducing. They exist

only to protect a mockery monarch and entice humanoids

to approach the monarch. Drones never willingly stray

far from their monarch, but sometimes they get lost or

survive an attack that kills their mockery monarch. Such

mockery drones wander aimlessly, trying to make some

sense of their jumbled memories. Once they lose their

humanoid form, mockery drones attack anything weaker

than they are.

Unlike shapechangers, mockery drones can use their

humanoid disguise only once. Once they burst out of the

face and reveal their true forms, they remain in their insectile

form for the rest of their lives.

Environment: Mockery monarchs can be found nearly

anywhere, though they prefer warm environments. Aban-

doned  buildings  and  ruins  hold  special  interest  for  the

creatures. They dwell in or near civilized lands, where they

can  nd new fodder to turn into mockery drones. Mockery

drones never stray far from their monarch.

Mockery drone nests are usually open, underground areas

with winding tunnels that lead to the mockery monarchs

lair. The tunnels are at least 5 feet wide by 5 feet tall.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Mockery monarchs

are  massive,  segmented  insects  with  silvery  carapaces.

Their mouths are gaping, muscular holes set with enormous

mandibles. All mockery monarchs have grossly distended

abdomens. An adult mockery monarch is 10 feet long and

weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Mockery drones look like spined centipedes with grin-

ning humanoid faces. They average 5 feet long and weigh

200 pounds.

Alignment: Mockery monarchs have a curiosity about

other intelligent beings, but they have no compunctions

about causing suffering or killing. They arent callously

destructive, but they have no sense of fairness or honor. Care-

ful and conniving in pursuit of their goal of eating humanoids

and creating mockery drones, mockery monarchs care little

for other creatures. They are usually neutral evil.

Mockery drones are similar to their monarch. However,

they are more brutal and direct.

SOCIETY

Mockery monarchs have no society beyond the collective

nature  of  the  ankheg  nest  that  spawned  them.  Theyre

curious about the outside world, and they search for other

intelligent creatures. That search isnt for contact alone; its

to  nd victims from which to spawn mockery drones.

Its possible for a mockery monarch to strike up an alliance

with another creature. Such alliances end when the mockery

monarch  gives  in  to  the  temptation  to  turn  its  allies  into

mockery drones.

Mockery drones are free-willed and capricious creatures

that enjoy killing. Fortunately for their would-be victims,

theyre barely smarter than animals and incapable of group

organization.

A mockery drone wanders around, trying to engage in some

semblance of the activities it remembers from its humanoid

life. But with dull wits and scrambled memories, a mockery

drone quickly reveals that its no ordinary humanoid when

someone interacts with it. Mockery drones repeat nonsensi-

cal phrases or mindlessly repeat the same actions until some

new stimulus presents itself.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Mockery monarchs gather whatever attracts their interest,

carefully examining the gear from creatures theyve killed

and turned into mockery drones. Theyre interested in the

tools and trinkets that humanoids carry, so they keep such

objects. Even so, they have little sense of what wealth means,

and no notion of buying or selling. A mockery monarch has

standard treasure for its Challenge Rating.

Mockery drones have standard treasure for their Challenge

Rating. The treasure is spread around the drones environs.

In humanoid form, mockery drones employ only obviously

useful implements such as tools, weapons, and armor.

MOCKERY BUGS IN EBERRON

Mockery  monarchs  and  mockery  drones  emerged  in  the

Lower City of Sharn near the end of the Last War, rumored

to be the result of experiments with Brelish ankhegs and

roach thralls (Sharn 184) gone wrong. House Phiarlan and

House Thuranni have been implicated, but each house blames

the other. Despite efforts to destroy them, a few mockery

monarchs escaped into the wild. Mockery bugs have been

rooted out as far east as Valenar, and the hags of Droaam are

rumored to have a few in their service.

MOCKERY BUGS IN FAERN

Mockery monarchs and mockery drones were originally bred

in ancient Netherilwhether their breeding into the ankheg

population was deliberate or accidental is unknown. Wild

mockery bugs are rare but found wherever ankhegs are.

The Zhentarim have experimented with mockery bugs

recently,  using  them  to  mixed  effect  in  their  expansion

across the North. The Zhent mockery monarchs obediently

followed orders at  rst, but as they created more mockery

drones, they grew more independent and resentful of their

masters. Now, renegade mockery monarchs make war on

the Zhentarim.

An elite assassin serving a sinister necromancer at the heart

of a ninja cult, Kugan is blessed with an unholy array of abili-

ties. By using a secret ritual, Kugans master granted him the

phantom template for his years of honorable and successful

service. Kugan had the following ability scores before racial

modi cations and Hit Dice ability score increases: Str 13,

Dex 14, Con 8, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 12.

Strategies and Tactics

Kugan initiates combat from a distance that he covers with

an impressive leap. He lands among his foes to expose them

to his stench, then he  ghts while incorporeal, using his

ghost step power to set up his sudden strikes. Incorporeality

and Tumble give him all the mobility he needs to choose his

targets. He kills clerics  rst.

Sample Encounter

Kugan works alone.

Phantom  Assassin  (EL  7):  One  of  the  PCs  enemies

has employed Kugans cult to take out one or more of the

characters. Kugan stalks the PCs, attacking them when

theyre vulnerable.

CREATING A PHANTOM

Phantom is an acquired template that can be applied to any

corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A phantom uses all the base creatures statistics and abilities

except as noted here.

The base creature gains abilities from this template based

on its Challenge Rating. If the creatures CR increases for

any reason, it gains abilities according to its new CR.

Challenge Rating: If the base creature is CR 4 or lower,

its new CR is the same as the base creature +1. If the base

creature is CR 5 or higher, its new CR is the same as the base

creature +2.

Atk  Options:  A  phantom  of  CR  5

or higher cannot use attack options that

require prolonged contact with a target,

such  as  adhesive  and  similar  attacks.  A

base creature or CR 5 or higher gains the

following attack option.

Phantom Strike (Ex): For the purpose of

resolving spells, melee attacks, ranged at-

tacks, and other attacks that require only

momentary  contact  to  deal  damage  or

have their effects, a phantom is consid-

ered to be both incorporeal and corporeal

when it is incorporeal. Thus, the phan-

tom  receives  its  normal  Strength

and it can use material components to cast

its spells.

PHANTOM INCORPOREALITY

When you apply the phantom template to a base creature that

has a CR of 4 or lower, that creature has no Strength score when

its moving with its incorporeal movement ability active, nor does

it get its armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus to

AC (unless that bonus comes from a force effect or from an item

that has the ghost touch property). Since the creature is incorpo-

real only when it moves, its attacks arent affected by its incorpo-

reality even if it uses feats or abilities such as Spring Attack.

When you apply the template to a base creature that has a CR of

5 or higher, dont change the creatures Strength for the purpose

of resolving its attacks, and simply give the creature its Charisma

bonus as a deflection bonus to AC. Note the special attacks it has

that require more than momentary contact with an opponent

those attacks dont work when the creature is incorporeal.

In all cases, a phantom that becomes corporeal when inside

a solid object is shunted out of that object toward the nearest

open  space  that  can  hold  the  creature,  taking  1d6  points  of

damage per 5 feet it must travel.

When a phantom is incorporeal, items it carries cannot be

handled  by  corporeal  creatures.  A  phantom  has  incorporeal

immunities and incorporeal traits when incorporeal, modified

by the exceptions provided by the template.

RUIN CHANTER

On a narrow stone ledge stands a nimble  gure garbed in ragged

clothes and a rust-colored cloak. A pair of clever black eyes set in

a weathered face shine from beneath his wide-brimmed hat. His

long,  ne  ngers hold an ornate black mace. He suddenly licks his

parched lips and begins to wail a mournful dirge.

Bardic Music (Su) A ruin chanter has the bardic music ability

of a 12th-level bard (PH 29).

Call Ruin Elemental (Su) Once per week, when a ruin chanter

is aware of interlopers within the ruins it calls home, the

ruin chanter can conjure a ruin elemental (page 134)

after an hour-long ritual. During the ritual, a storm (DMG

94) appropriate for the climate strikes the ruin chanters

home. When the ritual is complete, the storm disappears

suddenly and a ruin elemental appears, ready to do the

ruin chanters bidding. Since the ruin elemental serves

the ruin chanter until the elemental is destroyed, its

possible for a ruin chanter to have more than one ruin

elemental serving it.

Infirmity of Body (Su) By pointing its finger, a ruin chanter

can prematurely age an enemys body. Doing so imposes

a 6 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and

causes the victims hair to turn white, skin to wrinkle, and

posture to stoop (Fortitude DC 27 negates). The penalty

lasts for 1 hour or until the victim receives a remove curse

spell. A ruin chanter cannot place both infirmity of body

and infirmity of mind on the same creature. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Infirmity of Mind (Su) With a wave of its hand, a ruin chanter

can render a creature senile and unable to reliably tell

friend from foe. This ability functions as a confusion spell

(Will DC 27 negates) and makes victims appear elderly

just as infirmity of body does. Infirmity of mind lasts for

1 hour or until the victim receives a remove curse spell.

A ruin chanter cannot place both infirmity of body and

infirmity of mind on the same creature. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Ruin chanters, personifications of worldly decay, act as

guardians  of  ancient  sites.  They  channel  their  sorrow

into  melancholy  songs  of  glories  past  and  powers  of

decomposition.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

When invaders come to a ruin chanters home, that chanter

calls a ruin elemental as soon as it can. It then sends the

elemental against the trespassers, while the ruin chanter

uses its infirmity abilities to prematurely age intruders

it  deems  to  be  the  greatest  threats.  Intermittently,  the

ruin chanter sings dirges commemorating the ruins past

glory to inspire courage or inspire greatness in itself and

its allies.

Ruin  chanters  are  nimble  foes,  using  their  feats  and

flight to deliver precise strikes or maneuver into a good

position to use a spell-like ability. They dont give away

the fact that they can fly, seeming to move easily over dif-

ficult terrain or leap great distances. They use this secret

to  great  advantage  in  combat,  weightlessly  springing

onto unstable structures and luring their opponents into

following them, then stepping off the construction just

as it collapses.

This is a ruin chanter, a fey guardian of ancient

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Ruin chanters are solitary creatures, but theyre usually found

with ruin elemental servants. Occasionally, a bonded pair of

ruin chanters can be found in a single locale.

Urban Renewal (EL 15): In ruins from a bygone age

under a major city, a ruin chanter and two ruin elementals

have taken up residence. The powers that be have decided

to demolish the ruins to build an underground ward for

dwarves, bringing them into direct con ict with the

ruin chanter and its allies.

ECOLOGY

Ruin chanters, like other types of fey, are spir-

its born of the land. In the case of a ruin

chanter, sadness and loss have given

it life, rather than natural vibrancy

and abundance. A ruin chanter

reflects these former qualities

in its solitary, introspective, and

melancholy manner.

Male  and  female  ruin  chanters

exist. On the rare occasion when two

ruin chanters of opposite sexes meet,

they  mate  and  produce  children  the

way  most  mortal  creatures  do.  Young

ruin chanters seek their own domains

far from their parents.

Ruin chanters eat ash and dust, and

they  drink  whatever  water  they  find

within their ruined homes. To

them, air full of ancient grit

is like a  oral perfume.

They sleep on piles of

rubble.

Environment:

These  elusive  fey  are

found in locales rav-

aged by magic or war, or

where time has seen the

fall  of  civilization.  They  haunt  the  ruins

of lost cities, ancient temples, and toppled fortresses. Ruin

chanters revel in the dissolution imposed by time, so most

of them shy away from populated areas.

a ruin chanter is openly hostile to those who raid its home

for loot. It can be deadly in such a case, though it doesnt try

to cause undue suffering. Ruin chanters are usually chaotic

neutral, and they are seldom good. Evil ruin chanters try

to create ruins from thriving societies.

SOCIETY

A creature that enters a ruin chanters ruins to do anything

other than subsist or restore the glories of the past becomes

the ruin chanters enemy. Ruin chanters harry their foes

relentlessly,  intent  on  preserving  the  grandeur

of ages past. Although it is content to

drive away adversaries, a ruin chanter

isnt gentle or diplomatic.

Solitary  creatures  by  nature,  ruin

chanters  nonetheless  occasionally  at-

tract  followers  who  share  their  views.  A

ruin  chanter  tolerates  constructs,  undead,

and  other  creatures  native  to  its  chosen

ruins.  It  also  abides  creatures  devoted

to restoration.

clothes, wearing cloaks, hats, scarves, or

goggles to conceal their features. They

carry ornate melee weapons, most com-

monly an adamantine mace. Though

the  mace  sometimes  has  decora-

tions similar to those found in

the ruins, it isnt necessarily

from a former age.

They respect one

visiting ruin chanter sings an

announcement to let a poten-

tial host know of its approach.

The  ruins  owner  can  respond  with  a  song  of  welcome

or  a  song  of  warning,  greeting  or  rejecting  the  would-

be guest.

Ruin chanter

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Ruin  chanters  are

lanky humanlike creatures, standing between 5 and 6 feet

tall. Their skin is weathered, colored tan to gray, with patches

of wind-burned red. Eyes sparkle darkly, no whites to be seen,

within those hairless faces, and ruin chanters have silvery

locks as an aged human might.

Alignment: A ruin chanter is sel sh and pessimistic.

Caring little for events and creatures outside its demesne,

TYPICAL TREASURE

Ruin chanters dont collect treasure, but the antiquities

and wonders of the ancients are under their guard. They

effectively have double standard treasure for their Challenge

Rating. This wealth is spread around the chanters home

ruin, and those who take even the smallest item draw the

feys ire.

Immunities (Ex) Ruin elementals take no damage and suffer

no impeded movement in the area of a spike stones spell.

Rock Throwing (Ex) Like giants, ruin elementals are

accomplished rock throwers and have a +1 racial bonus

on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A ruin elemental

of Large size can hurl rocks weighing up to 50 pounds

(Small objects) up to five range increments. A Huge

ruin elemental can hurl rocks weighing up to 80 pounds

(Medium objects) up to five range increments. The

range increment is 150 feet for a ruin elementals

thrown rocks.

Shock Wave (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, as a swift action, a

ruin elemental can strike the ground to create a shock

wave in a 20-foot-radius spread centered on itself. All

creatures not of the earth subtype within the radius

of the shock wave are treated as if bull rushed by the

ruin elemental. The ruin elemental receives a +4 bonus

on this check from Improved Bull Rush, as well as +4

for each size category it is larger than the targeted

opponent. A typical ruin elemental has a +17 bonus

on the opposed check against Medium creatures, +21

against Small creatures, and +13 against Large

creatures. Creatures that fail the opposed checks are

pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone.

Brought into being by ruin chanters (page 132), ruin elemen-

tals arise in wasted lands and shattered fortresses. They keep

to themselves, avoiding contact with other creatures.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Ruin elementals are passive, patient creatures, but they turn

violent when others trespass within the territory they are

dedicated to defending. Ruin elementals guarding their

lairs are aggressive and virtually impossible to negotiate

with, seeing all creatures in the area as threats to be slain or

driven away. Only the ruin chanter that created it and those

designated as harmless by the ruin chanter can approach a

ruin elemental without fear.

When  defending  their  homes,  ruin  elementals  first

attempt  to  take  out  opponents  with  volleys  of  thrown

rocks.  When  foes  close  to  melee  range,  the  elemental

meets  them  with  its  slam  attacks.  If  fighting  multiple

foes, a ruin elemental uses its shock wave ability to knock

them down. Prone foes likely remain within the creatures

reach, but it concentrates on one target before moving on

to the rest.

In defense of their lairs and the areas they are sworn to

protect, ruin elementals  ght to the death.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Ruin elementals are the servants of ruin chanters. These

elementals are called to the Material Plane, and they seldom

appear in large numbers.

Masterless Servant (EL 10): A lone ruin elemental lurks

within the rubble of a fallen castle. The ruin chanter that cre-

ated it is long dead, but a doppelganger has a lair nearby. The

shapechanger knows which areas of the ruins it can hide in

to avoid the elementals wrath. If the doppelganger observes

PCs investigating the area, he poses as the ruin chanter and

demands tribute in exchange for ordering his guardian to

stand down. The doppelganger then  ees with the payment

(or if his ruse is discovered), leaving the party to face the

ruin elemental.

Final  Guardians  (EL  13): A  trio  of  ruin  elementals

guards the exit from an ancient dungeon explored by the

PCs. When the characters emerge, the elementals hem

them  in,  preventing  their  exit  but  keeping  them  from

fleeing back into the place. Unless the PCs drop the loot

they took from the dungeon, these guardians attack and

fight until destroyed.

TREASURE

Ruin  elementals  col-

ends  they  find  interesting,

but these items are not nec-

essarily valuable or useful.

Although  they  are  rarely

found in possession of coins,

ruin elementals frequently hoard

fine weapons and art. These are often worn

or damaged in some way because of the creatures abra-

sive  touch,  and  they  are  worth  their  full  value  only  to

collectors.  Magic  items  are  also  commonly  found  in  a

ruin elementals lair, since such objects are more capable

of  withstanding  the  ravages  of  time  and  the  creatures

touch.  Ruin  elementals  have  half  standard  treasure  for

their Challenge Rating, almost all of which is in the form

of the aforementioned items.

RUIN ELEMENTALS IN EBERRON

Ruin elementals can be found across Eberron, from the ruins

of Xendrik to the blasted wastes of the Mournland. In the

Demon Wastes, ruin elementals are thought to have been

created  by  ruin  chanters  dedicated  to  guarding  that  land

against the return of the Lords of Dust. Rumor has it that a

ruin chanter has hidden a powerful artifact within territory

guarded by his creationsa relic said to be instrumental in

the plans of those seeking to free the  ends that were bound

at the end of the Age of Demons.

RUIN ELEMENTALS IN FAERN

Thought to be little more than legend, ruin elementals are

found in the deep deserts and tundra of Faern. Within

the  lairs  of  the  oldest  ruin  elementals,  powerful  magic

items of Faerns past are said to be hidden. Factions of the

Zhentarim and the Red Wizards search constantly for such

sites, and they pay handsomely for information regarding

such locations. They also reward those who thwart others

in similar searches.

RYLKAR

Rylkars are a race of ratlike creatures hailing from the

upper  regions  of  the  Underdark.  These  monstrosities

spread  into  inhabited  locales,  consuming  all  they  find

and reproducing at a terrifying rate. Like the rats they

resemble,  rylkars  feed  on  garbage  and  offal,  and  their

presence spreads the taint of corruption throughout the

areas where they lair.

Fire is the source of the rylkar life cycle, and all rylkars

are drawn to  ame. Rylkar mating rituals typically involve

 re-resistant tormentors and madclaws bringing open  ame

to a rylkar harridan, who then spawns a swarm of new rylkars

with this life-giving energy.

Vile odors hang heavy in the air even before you spot their source.

attacks, however, and is affected normally by loud

noises, sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence), and

overpowering odors (such as stinking cloud or incense-

heavy air). Negating a harridans sense of smell or

hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the

feat). If both these senses are negated, a rylkar harridan is

effectively blinded.

Regeneration (Ex) A rylkar harridan takes normal damage

from fire and acid.

Rylkar Fever (Ex) Diseasebite, Fort DC 22 negates,

incubation period 1 day, damage 1d6 Con. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Frightful Presence (Ex) 30-foot radius, 10 HD or fewer, Will

DC 18 negates.

Contaminate (Su) A rylkar harridan exudes toxins that

contaminate the environment around it. Food or drink

brought within 20 feet of a harridan becomes foul and

poisonous (Fort DC 22, 1d6 Con/1d6 Con) to any but

rylkars. Potions in the area must succeed a DC 22

Fortitude save or become similarly poisonous. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

This contamination spreads away from a rylkar

harridans lair. Once a rylkar harridan remains in a

cavern or dungeon room up to 80 feet on a side, or

similar chamber, for one full week, that entire room is

contaminated as above. The contamination spreads

20 feet from that room each day the rylkar harridan

remains present. A remove curse spell cast within

the room after the harridan has been killed ends the

contamination.

Spawn Swarm (Ex) Three times per day, when a rylkar

harridan takes at least 5 points of fire damage from

a single source, she can release a rylkspawn swarm

into 4 contiguous squares that she occupies or is

adjacent to.

Hive Mind (Ex) All rylkars within 10 miles of their harridan

are in constant communication, and she with them.

If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If

one in a group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No

rylkar in a group is considered flanked unless all of

them are.

Skills Rylkar harridans have a +4 racial bonus on Listen

checks.

A  rylkar  harridan  is  the  queen  of  a  rylkar  colony.  She

spends  her  time  rolling  in  the  muck  of  her  surround-

ings and devouring her madclaw drones with disgusting

relish, even as she poisons the area around her with her

foul presence.

By the power of  re, all rylkars are born from a harridan,

but large numbers of these creatures meet their eventual end

inside her gullet. So ravenous are the rylkar harridans that

they are known to snatch and devour new broods of young

to appease their gnawing hunger.

Strategies and Tactics

If an enemy manages to breach the defenses of a rylkar

infestation and reaches the harridans breeding pit, the

rylkar  queen  rises  up  in  her  terrible  wrath.  Though

blind, she homes in on her enemies with blindsight and

moves  toward  her  closest  opponent.  Swollen  with  cor-

ruption and maddened by constant hunger, she uses her

prodigious jaws and Improved Sunder feat to shatter her

foes weapons, then uses Power Attack to quickly kill her

screaming meals.

A  harridan  moves  to  attack  any  creature  carrying   re,

whether a torch or a  aming weapon. Though she knows

that  re can harm her, she relishes the pain that allows her

to create more spawn.

A harridan has little interest in the well-being of other

rylkars, and she  ghts without regard for tactical position.

In fact, a harridans appetite is so voracious that if no oppo-

nents stand within immediate reach, she is likely to snatch

up and feed on a squirming ally to give her strength for the

battle to come.

RYLKAR MADCLAW

A tittering laugh echoes in the darkness, followed by the sound of

scrabbling claws. A white rat the size of a dog emerges from the

clinging shadows, whiskers twitching as it creeps forward. Then it

laughs again as it races to attack.

Madclaws  are  the  drones,  workers,  and  battle  fodder  of  a

rylkar colony.

Strategies and Tactics

Though  they  lack  the  raw  strength  of  rylkar  tormentors,

madclaws  dont  shirk  when  it  comes  to  battle.  Gathering

in bands of two to six, madclaws can even deter individual

tormentors from making a meal out of them. Multiple bands

overwhelm foes through superior numbers.

When threatened, a madclaw assumes a defensive posture,

using its Dodge feat against the closest enemy. If outnum-

bered, it uses its mad shriek to confound its opponents and

escape. If cornered, a madclaw is a vicious foe, lashing out

with its corrupt bite and claws.

Tormentors are the warriors of a rylkar colony. They protect

the harridan and harass other rylkars, murdering them to

pass the time until another foe comes along.

Strategies and Tactics

Tormentors  work  individually  or  in  teams  of  two  to  four,

charging intruders en masse. They pounce on their enemies,

tearing into them with jagged claws and teeth. If supported

by madclaws, tormentors use hate shriek to make those

allies more formidable. Having inherited something of

their queens hunger, they do not pursue  eeing opponents.

Instead, they set upon the dead or dying, gorging themselves

on fresh meat.

You catch a whiff of a foul stench as a knot of squirming rats surges

out of the darkness. Gleaming green eyes seek you out as uncount-

able sleek brown bodies writhe, their tails seemingly entwined in

one great knot.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Rylkar colonies arise as infestations, and rylkars defend the

colony and its harridan to the bitter end. Creatures encoun-

tered singly or in small numbers should be close to a larger

lair, and a rylkar infestation can and probably should serve

as the backbone of an adventure.

An infestation of rylkars might take hold in a citys sewers,

growing in size and danger as these creatures feed their insa-

tiable hunger. Alternatively, a colony might establish itself in

proximity to an important location in the Underdark, feasting

on subterranean travelers or the leavings of other predators.

Scavengers (EL 7): Three rylkspawn swarms prowl the

tunnels  of  a  city  sewer.  Even  when  seeking  morsels  with

which to stuff themselves, they search for  re to present to

the harridan. When the PCs cross their path, the rylkspawn

swarms seize the opportunity to feed.

The Doomed (EL 810): In a rare moment of desperate

self-preservation, a group of six madclaws attempts to escape

a  failing  colony,  knowing  that  the  harridan  will  devour

them all before the end. As the madclaws  ee through the

Underdark, a group of three tormentors pursues them, with

the PCs caught in the middle.

ECOLOGY

A rylkar colony has a ravenous appetite. When a rylkar

infestation takes hold, rylkspawn swarms swiftly destroy

the local ecosystem, slaughtering native creatures and strip-

ping plants bare. Before long, the area around the colony is

devoid of life, forcing the rylkars to range farther and farther

for survival. Eventually, the gathering of more food in the

vicinity becomes impossible, and the infestation must move

on or die.

Once a rylkar colony takes hold, tormentors set out to  nd

sources of  re. By bringing these back to the harridan, the

tormentors help the colony expand its numbers to forage in

a wider range. For their service and devotion, tormentors

are often eaten after the harridan has given birth to a new

rylkspawn swarm.

As a swarm matures, its members eat each other and any-

thing else consumable in the area. The survivors emerge as

warrior tormentors and madclaw drones. The most numerous

rylkars inside a colony are the madclaws, and tormentors are

more common outside the colony. Occasionally, a rylkspawn

swarm includes a nascent harridan. If this creature can act

quickly and eat enough of the swarm to survive, it is carried

off by madclaws under tormentor escort, eventually founding

a new colony far from the old.

Rylkars blindly attack any creatures they encounter, just

as other creatures usually attack a rylkar on sight. Animals

instinctively sense the corruption inherent in rylkars, and they

either attempt to drive the rylkars off or immediately  ee.

Environment: Though they have no special antipathy to

light, rylkars prefer to hole up in underground environments.

In addition to keeping them hidden from potential predators,

underground life suits the rylkars nocturnal nature. A colony

emerges from its lair when the sun has set, beginning the

nights hunt in an attempt to appease the harridans dread-

ful hunger. Rylkars lair aboveground only when doing so

protects them from their enemies better than a subterranean

lair could. Whether in the heart of a massive sewer system

or the ruins of an ancient fortress, a rylkar infestation is a

noxious and deadly scourge.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Rylkars might look

like giant rats from a distance, but closer inspection shows the

similarity to be super cial. They have pale skin mottled with

thin patchy fur. Their skin is covered with unsightly bulges

and tumors that have a tendency to burst when the creatures

are active, spraying streams of pale green  uid harmlessly into

the air. This expulsion appears to cause the rylkars no distress,

however, and they chitter happily at the patterns produced

on walls and foes alike by this disgusting display.

Lesser rylkars vary in size, depending on their purpose

in a colony. An individual rylkspawn is about the size of a

large brown rat, 1 to 2 feet long and weighing 2 to 4 pounds.

Madclaws grow up to 4 feet in length and weigh about 40

pounds. They are covered in pale white fur and have pink

or  red  eyes.  The  larger  and  stronger  tormentors  can  grow

to 8 feet long and weigh upward of 400 pounds. They have

matted red fur and black eyes.

Harridans dwarf all other members of the colony. These

creatures can grow to 30 feet in length and sixteen tons

in  weight.  Though  they  bear  a  passing  resemblance  to

enormous bloated rats, their bodies bristle with clumps

of  filth-encrusted  black  fur.  Great  swaths  of  their  skin

are bare, pocked with scabrous tumors and old rupture

scars.  A  harridans  head  is  more  mouth  than  anything

else. Rylkar tormentors tear a harridans eyes out as soon

as she is discovered among a swarm, possibly in the hope

of preventing her from feasting on her own kind. If so,

this scheme seldom works.

Alignment: Although a rylkar colony can have the appear-

ance of a regimented society, rylkars are self-serving in the

extreme. A colonys dedication to its harridan is absolute, but

madclaws and tormentors are intelligent enough to defend

themselves from the appetite of the harridan and her vora-

cious swarms. Without exception, rylkars are neutral evil.

SOCIETY

Rylkars are vicious and rapacious. Thoroughly malevolent,

they are concerned only with the rampant destruction

through which they feed their endless hunger. Rylkar

colonies avoid quick collapse into chaos only by the rigidly

de ned roles of their hierarchy. Under a social structure

similar to that of ants or bees, members of the colony are

assigned particular functions based on their capabilities.

At the bottom of the hierarchy are the mewling rylkspawn,

which live only to eat and grow. They cannot reproduce and

have little individual will.

Above  the  rylkspawn  swarms  stand  the  madclaws  that

serve  as  the  harridans  consorts.  Savage  and  self-centered,

they have an in ated sense of their own purpose, seeing their

relationship to the harridan as a sign of power. This belief

doesnt end even when the harridan snatches up a madclaw

and stuffs it into her cavernous maw.

Tormentors are the warriors of a colony, charged with

protecting  the  harridan  and  her  breeding  chamber.  This

responsibility makes them arrogant, and they believe they

have the right of life and death over any other colony member.

Gluttony and hubris inspire tormentors to devour squirming

rylkspawn and madclaws alike, though they prefer to kill and

eat other creatures.

At the head of the infestation is the grotesque harridan

herself. This queen of the colony is a blind, vile behemoth

whose life is spent eating and breeding. The pampering she

receives from her madclaw drones inflates her cruel and

selfish natureharridans are famed for their fickleness

and wickedness.

SAMPLE LAIR: RYLKAR WARRENS

The  sewers  of  a  small  city  have  recently  been  overrun  by

an infestation of rylkars. Though the citizens of the town

are not yet aware of the danger, signs of the infestation are

growing.  People  have  begun  to  fall  ill,  pets  and  children

have gone missing, and an especially foul stench rises from

the sewers.

The network of sewers beneath the town consists of 10-foot

wide channels, each running parallel to a major thoroughfare

above. Branching off from these main routes are secondary

sewers that are 5 feet wide. These drain debris, rubbish, and

effluvia out to a nearby river as it flows south. The walls

throughout are masonry over excavated earth, and they

feature no ledges. Characters navigating these passages must

do so in the polluted water of the sewers.

The entire area depicted on the map has been fouled by

the harridans contaminate ability.

1. Sewers (EL 4): The area depicted is a single stretch of

sewer located anywhere in the city. The water is slow-moving,

too shallow to swim but too deep to walk through unimpeded.

Each square of the sewer costs 2 squares to enter. Due to the

sounds of dripping and running water, characters take a 2

penalty on Listen checks when in these sewer tunnels.

This area is home to two rat swarms that have managed

to elude the ravenous rylkars. The swarms are drawn to the

sound of movement.

2 Rat Swarms: hp 13 each; MM 239.

2.  Entrance  (EL  6):  At  the  entrance  to  the  rylkar

warren,  chunks  of  slimy  masonry  emerge  like  rotten

teeth from the sluggish flow of the sewer water. Perched

on one rock is a common brown rat that scampers off if

anyone approaches.

Guarding this area is a single tormentor. It is focused on

eating a sheepdog, so it takes a 4 penalty on Listen checks

to notice the PCs approach. If it hears the PCs, the tormentor

presses against the wall, leaping out to attack any creature

that comes within 5 feet.

3.  Hall  of  Bones  (EL  6):  This  large  chamber  has  been

excavated by swarming rylkspawn. The stench here is over-

whelming, and the  oor is littered with chewed bones and

rotting offal. Footing in this area is badthe DC of Balance

and Tumble checks increases by 2.

Hiding in the muck are two rylkspawn swarms. When

any character moves into the room, the swarms attack.

4. Madclaw Nest (EL 7): This chamber is foul with excre-

ment and slime. The colonys madclaws lair here, and four are

here at any one time. They attack any nonrylkar that enters

this area.

5.  Harridan  Horror  (EL  10):  The  colonys  harridan

languishes here in her own  lth. Protecting her are two

tormentors that attack anyone who threatens their queen.

This room also holds the colonys treasure.

6. Rylkspawn Swarm Nests (EL 6): The odor of this room

is particularly repulsive. Cast-off bits of cloth and rubbish

litter the floor, serving as a nest. Two rylkspawn swarms

are here.

7. Tunnels (EL 5): Two groups of two rylkar madclaws

work at excavating these tunnels so the colony can grow.

Insert a single encounter with two madclaws at a couple of

points during the PCs exploration.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Though rylkars have little use for treasure, they collect what

they obtain from their victims. Rylkars are particularly

attracted to shiny objects, and their hoards contain coins,

gems, metalwork, and magic items. Tormentors, madclaws,

and  rylkspawn  have  no  treasure,  since  all  rylkars  give

valuables they  nd to the harridan. Her lair contains triple

standard treasure for her Challenge Rating.

RYLKARS IN EBERRON

Supposedly created by and enslaved to the goblinoids of

the Dhakaani Empire, rylkars lived and died at the whim of

their cruel masters. Hobgoblin lords pitted rylkar warriors

against one another in spectacular blood matches. Those that

did not  ght for the entertainment of their masters slaved

away in the mines.

Goblinoid legends tell of a bloody rylkar uprising that

raged for years during the war against the daelkyr. Battles

were costly, but in the end, the rylkars won their freedom.

They  ed into the depths of Khyber.

Today, these ancient accounts are seldom given credence,

but reports have described deadly encounters with colonies of

ratlike creatures deep beneath the earth. Adding credibility to

these tales, goblinoid priests in Darguun have recently begun

to make blood sacri ces, reportedly for protection against a

foul presence growing in the darkness beneath the earth.

RYLKARS IN FAERN

The upheaval that was the result of Lolths silence rippled

outward from the drow cities, with the violence that spilled

from these enclaves plunging other cultures into chaos.

Countless creatures  ed the rebellion, descending deeper

into the earth or drifting upward in the hope of escaping the

attention of the followers of the dread Revenancer.

Among these displaced creatures were the rylkars. Previ-

ously unknown to any but the most well-traveled Underdark

explorers, these monstrosities exploded from the subterra-

nean depths to  nd new homes in the sewers below surface

cities. Sightings of new infestations have been reported from

Waterdeep to Cormyr, and across the land, adventurers have

rallied to  ght this new threat.

Though colonies are destroyed as quickly as they establish

themselves, the rylkars have shown great adaptability and

cunning. Whether pushing into the wilderness or creating

lairs that can be actively defended within ancient ruins, this

scourge continues to spread.

Blood Drain (Su) A sanguineous drinkers claws are hollow,

enabling it to drain blood from a living victim. Living

creatures damaged by a claw attack also take 1 point of

Constitution damage. Each time a sanguineous drinker

deals 1 point of Constitution damage, it heals 5 points of

damage as its organs swell with blood.

Blood Spray (Su) As a swift action, a sanguineous drinker

can deal itself 5 points of damage to spray blood from

the organs in its torso. This has the same effect as the

area version of the grease spell (Reflex DC 17), but the

area is centered on the sanguineous drinker. The slippery

conditions created by the spray persist for 1 minute. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Sanguineous drinkers never need to make Reflex

saves against blood spray, but they do need to make

Balance checks to move.

Blood spray does not stack with the effect of a grease

spell or similar effects. The effect that has the highest

Reflex save DC takes precedence.

Sanguineous drinkers are skeletal undead intent on draining

the blood of any creature they encounter.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A sanguineous drinker quickly closes to melee with its

opponents,  getting  in  among  them  if  possible.  Once

in  position,  a  sanguineous  drinker  uses  blood  spray  to

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

The  abodes  of  sanguineous  drinkers  contain  blood  and

corpses, making them attractive to vermin. Those who hunt

these undead often encounter swarms of insects before bat-

tling the sanguineous drinker itself. A sanguineous drinker

attacks any living creatures entering its domain, stopping

only when it or the invaders are dead.

Occasionally, small packs of three to nine individuals form

in areas of intense death and suffering.

Sanguineous  drinkers  often  fight  alongside  other

intelligent  undeadparticularly  vampiresthat  value

their ferocity and lust for blood. Necromancers and cun-

ning undead spellcasters create sanguineous drinkers to

serve as guards, sometimes placing them among weaker

undead to reduce the efficacy of an enemy clerics turn

undead ability.

A Deadly Plunge (EL 6): A single sanguineous drinker

lurks in a grotto 40 feet up the wall of a natural cavern.

The grotto is accessible along a narrow ledge. Using its

blood spray and full attacks to knock opponents to the

floor  of  the  greater  cavern,  the  sanguineous  drinker

attacks anyone it spots moving along the ledge. Even if

it  doesnt  sense  intruders  soon  enough  to  attack  those

on  the  ledge,  the  sanguineous  drinker  can  rely  on  the

centipedes  in  its  lair  to  swarm  and  attack  approaching

living creatures.

Blood  Pack  (EL  9):  A  vampire   ghter  (MM  251)  stalks

the darkened streets on the bad side of town, accompanied

by  two  sanguineous  drinkers.  The  vampire   ies  ahead  of

his companions in bat form, and once he spots explorers,

he  summons  bat  swarms  to  conceal  the  approach  of  the

sanguineous  drinkers.  When  the  sanguineous  drinkers

attack, the vampire reverts to his normal shape and slams an

obvious servant of a good deity, using energy drain against

This creature is a sanguineous drinker, a type of

skeletal undead commonly used by intelligent

undead and necromancers as soldiers. They have

quick re exes and prefer to concentrate their

attacks on a single foe.

Sanguineous drinkers use their hollow claws to

drain the blood of living creatures.

These creatures can store the blood in their

wasted organs, later using it to spray the  oor

with a bloody slick that can cause falls and impair

movement.

that foe. The sanguineous drinkers  ank another foe, using

blood spray only to prevent their prey from retreating.

ECOLOGY

Sanguineous drinkers are not natural creatures. Necro-

mancers  create  them  from  corpses

boiled in blood. Particularly evil

and bloodthirsty creatures might

spontaneously rise as sanguineous

drinkers if they die in an environ-

ment soiled with blood and corrupted

by negative energy.

Alignment:  Sanguineous  drinkers  are  corrupt  and

depraved killers with an inborn hatred for living creatures

and a supernatural lust for blood. They lack compassion, and

they enjoy toying with their victims, in icting as much tor-

ment as possible. These creatures are always chaotic evil.

SOCIETY

Uncontrolled  sanguineous  drinkers  claim  a  small  area  in

which  to  hunt.  They  thirst  for  blood  from  the  living,

and this need drives them above all else. Sanguineous

drinkers know nothing of mercy or fear. They  ght

to the death.

Sanguineous  drinkers  dont   ght  among

themselves, even over territory, seeing no gain

in such clashes. Instead, they either form packs

to gain more blood or disperse to ensure good

hunting for all. When a pack forms, the old-

est or most powerful sanguineous drinker

rules  the  group,  using  its  underlings  as

pawns to entrap or lure living creatures.

Sanguineous drinkers speak one

language, which is normally Com-

mon.  A  sanguineous  drinkers

creator can specify a different lan-

guage when creating the creature,

but he must speak that language.

Although  sanguineous  drink-

ers  can  speak,  they  rarely  do

soand they never negotiate

with  their  preybut  in  com-

bat, they howl with excitement.

Communication among a pack

of such creatures is limited to the

expression of commands and the re-

ports of subordinates.

Environment:  Sanguin-

eous  drinkers  lurk  on

battle elds or in places used

for  ritual  sacrifice.  They

haunt unholy locales, thirst-

ing  for  blood.  Although

sunlight does not harm san-

guineous drinkers, they avoid

its brilliance, preferring to lurk

inside  or  underground.  Some

prowl fetid caverns heavy with

the stench of death, while

others inhabit abandoned

and  isolated  ruins  that

have a history of bloody

slaughter.

Their  lairs  take  several

forms  but  typically  have  at

least  two  entrances,  which

sanguineous  drinkers  dont

bother  to  hide.  Blood  cakes  the

area around such access points,

and the interior is stacked with

eviscerated and bloodless corpses

that frequently attract large num-

bers  of  vermin.  The  sanguineous

drinkers coat the walls,  oors, and even

the ceilings of their lairs in blood. When

their bloodlust overcomes them and no al-

ternative source of blood is available, they

consume these deposits.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Sanguineous drinkers

are humanoid in form and usually human-sized. Larger speci-

mens exist, created from the remains of a larger creature.

A  typical  sanguineous  drinker  resembles  a  partially

decomposed and skeletal member of its original race, except

that it has clawed hands and feet. It drains blood through

those hollow claws, storing the  uid in its shriveled organs. A

 brous mass of connective tissue connects the organs to the

sanguineous drinkers ribs. Despite leaking from thousands

of tiny perforations, the organs swell as more blood is pumped

into them.

Sanguineous drinker

TYPICAL TREASURE

In addition to their insatiable lust for

blood, sanguineous drinkers have an

obsessive desire to collect implements

used in committing violence. In particu-

lar, sanguineous drinkers gather weapons and

armor, especially those items still gory from the battle eld.

Their lairs are crammed with armaments of all descriptions,

most of which are rusted and useless. Masterwork weapons

and armor, as well as the occasional magic item, are mixed

in among this trash.

A  sanguineous  drinker  has  standard  treasure  for  its

Challenge Rating. The bulk of this treasure is in the form

of valuable weapons or similar items.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A spellcaster of 15th level or higher can use the create undead

spell to animate a sanguineous drinker.

Collective Health (Su) A scouring slinger within 100 feet of

another scouring slinger or a scouring stanchion shares

a single pool of hit points. This pool is the sum of the hit

points from all creatures that have the collective health

ability and are within 100 feet of each other. Subtract

any damage taken by one creature from the overall pool.

No creature that has collective health is destroyed until

the pool reaches 0 hit points, at which time all creatures

sharing the pool are destroyed simultaneously.

Scouring slinger

If a scouring

slinger is

separated

from others

in its hit

point pool,

divide the damage

taken proportionally among the

creatures within the pool. For

example, if a collective of five

stanchions and slingers has lost

100 hit points, each creature that separates from the pool

has taken 20 points of damage.

Scorpion Throw (Ex) As a standard action, a scouring slinger

can throw six of the slinger scorpions that are grown from

its body. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range

of 250 feet. On a successful attack, the slinger scorpions

take up positions in squares surrounding and adjacent to

the target, avoiding squares that are already occupied. If

the attack misses, the slinger scorpions take up positions

around a square 2d4 squares away from the target in a

random direction.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SCOURING INSECTS

The collective health ability of a group of scouring constructs

is manifested in the large insects constantly swarming around

these  creatures.  These  insects  are  a  part  of  a  scouring  con-

structs being, and they are laced with the supernatural essence

of its collective health ability.

Individual insects are fragile, and any melee attack directed

against the swarm automatically kills 2d8 of these Diminutive

creatures. Spells such as fireball can destroy all the insects in a

wide area. However, a scouring construct can create as many

replacement insects as it needs as an immediate action. The

insects ignore other creatures, and characters fighting within

the cloud suffer no adverse effect.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Spot check notices that

a cloud of insects never swarms more than 50 feet from a lone

construct.  This  knowledge  might  inspire  PCs  to  try  to  force

constructs to move more than 100 feet apart, negating their

collective health ability.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Slinger scorpions cannot attack in the round in

which they are launched, but they are not flat-footed.

The scorpion throw itself deals no damage to the

target creature.

Once its first set of slinger scorpions is deployed,

a scouring slinger can create up to six more as a move

action. However, the slinger takes 10 points of damage for

each scorpion it creates. If it is within 100 feet of another

scouring slinger or scouring stanchion, this damage is

taken from the collective health pool as normal.

Advancement 

Slinger scorpions are grown from the body of a scouring

slinger and launched as part of its special scorpion throw

attack. They use the scouring slingers Hit Dice to determine

their base attack bonus and saving throws.

Independent  slinger  scorpions  fall  to  pieces  after  24

hours or when the scouring slinger that created them is

destroyed. They are not independent monsters and have

no Challenge Rating; they are part of an encounter with

a scouring slinger.

Strategies and Tactics

If  an  opponent  comes  within  melee  range,  a  scouring

slinger uses its slam attack. Otherwise, scouring slingers

attack primarily with their scorpion throw, harrying foes

at a distance. Against large numbers of opponents, scouring

slingers target characters on the fringe of the group, allowing

their slinger scorpions to focus on individual targets without

being  anked themselves. Against smaller groups, scouring

slingers launch their slinger scorpions to surround as many

foes as possible.

Spells that deal damage even on a successful save are the

best means of destroying slinger scorpions. As such, a scour-

ing slinger targets characters lacking armor  rst, hoping to

take out enemy mages. If a particular opponent demonstrates

an ability to destroy slinger scorpions easily, the scouring

slinger does not target that foe with subsequent scorpion

throw attacks. Similarly, any opponent who consistently

avoids the slinger scorpions attacks is eventually ignored in

favor of other targets.

These default strategies can be altered if an intelligent

creature is directing the scouring slingers attacks. Slinger

scorpions are effective at slowing adversaries down and

restricting their movement. As such, intelligent control-

lers order them to ignore characters with low mobility

and few attacks.

Though slinger scorpions can move to  ank opponents,

they employ little strategy beyond attacking foes as directed.

Even if an intelligent creature controls the scouring slinger,

the slinger scorpions tactics cannot be improved.

Strategies and Tactics

Although  scouring  stanchions  are

mindless, they are programmed with

advanced combat strategies. An intelli-

gent  controller  can  direct  a  scouring

stanchion even more effectively.

A scouring stanchion with designated

enemies moves toward them but stops 10 feet

away  from  the  nearest  foe.  This  forces  oppo-

nents to move through the area the scouring

stanchion  threatens,  provoking  an  attack  of

opportunity even as the scouring stanchions

reach allows it to attack. A scouring stanchion

uses Awesome Blow to knock opponents away

from it. Those opponents must then move back

into range (likely provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity) to attack again.

A scouring stanchion directs all its attacks

against a single target until that target drops.

The construct can also be directed to clear a

path between its location and a certain

point. If so ordered, it moves for-

ward in a straight line, using its

unstoppable  movement  and

melee attacks to clear oppo-

nents out of the way.

Though weak oppo-

nents can be slain by

a single slam attack,

a  scouring  stan-

chion  often  leaves

stronger opponents

alive.  Its  program-

ming forces it to stop

attacking when a tar-

get falls unconscious from nonlethal damage, though an

intelligent controller can order the construct to finish off

fallen foes.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Scouring slingers and scouring stanchions usually have an

intelligent controller guiding them. This controller (usu-

ally the druid who created the construct or a creature in

that druids service) stays hidden, deploying the powerful

constructs to keep combatants well away from him. A single

controller can direct the actions of up to three scouring

constructs as a full-round action, directing a single scouring

construct as a standard action.

Scouring stanchions are sometimes set as guards for po-

tent magical locations in the wilderness, but they are more

commonly used as the vanguard of druid-led armies. Scour-

ing  stanchions  are  strong  enough  to  break  down  wooden

palisades and stone walls, and they can clear a path through

nearly any opposing force.

Because scouring stanchions

and  scouring  slingers  are  con-

structed  through  similar

processes,  they  are  often

created  at  the  same  time.

Their  combat  styles  com-

plement each other, with a

scouring stanchion taking

on  massed  melee  forces

while  scouring  slingers

use their scorpion throw

against  targets  outside  the

main group.

Both  kinds  of  con-

structs  obey  their  creator

and  any  other  intelligent  crea-

ture  their  creator  orders  them

to obey. The constructs creator

can regain sole control as a free

action. Scouring stanchions and

scouring slingers understand any

commands spoken by their control-

lers, but they do not respond to any

other creatures.

Sentinel (EL 18): A lone scour-

ing slinger guards an approach to a

druids  tree  house  abode.  The  dru-

ids assistant is also present, but PCs

who time their attack carefully can

catch him by surprise. If they do so,

the  assistant  is  prevented  from  control-

ling the scouring slinger for the  rst round

of combat.

Scouring

stanchion

Sentry  (EL  18):  A  single  scouring

stanchion and a controller have instructions to stop anyone

trying  to  pass  through  a  sacred  grove.  If  all  intruders  are

rendered unconscious, the constructs controller takes them

prisoner.

Artillery  Unit  (EL  21):  Three  scouring  slingers  and

a single controller work together as an assault force. The

constructs throw slinger scorpions to pin opponents down,

then wade in with their slam attacks.

Strike Team (EL 21): A scouring slinger provides artil-

lery  support  to  two  scouring  stanchions,  with  the  whole

group directed by a druid serving the powerful druid who

created the constructs. The controller stays well away from

combat, but if he is taken out, the constructs lose the ability

to coordinate their assault.

ECOLOGY

As constructs, scouring slingers and scouring stanchions

have  no  place  in  the  natural  world.  A  scouring  slinger

given  defensive  orders  and  a  generous  definition  of

enemy can lay waste to a substantial number of creatures,

but  these  constructs  are  passive  until  used  in  battle.

Likewise,  a  scouring  stanchion  directed  to  destroy  (or

simply given badly worded orders) can devastate a wide

swath of territory.

Environment: Scouring slingers and scouring stan-

chions can survive in almost any environment, and they

are found wherever their creators order them. Both kinds

of constructs operate best in a wide area, however, and

are only rarely found in the confined spaces of castles,

fortresses, and cities. Scouring slingers are not commonly

used underground, since their scorpion throw becomes

limited by the 60-foot range of their darkvision. Scouring

stanchions can be found underground, and they function

perfectly well underwater.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Scouring slingers

resemble  the  shambling  mounds  from  which  they  are

created, but they are larger and composed of desiccated

vegetation. Essentially amorphous, a scouring slinger can

grow limbs as it needs them, then reabsorb them into its

body.  These  creatures  are  vaguely  bipedal,  standing  20

feet tall and weighing twelve tons.

Scouring stanchions resemble nothing so much as a mas-

sive, gnarled tree trunk. They stand 25 feet tall and weigh

 fteen tons.

The insects that swarm on and around a scouring construct

are oversized, clearly supernatural, and in constant motion.

Their  movement  is  marked  by  faint  arcs  of  multicolored

energy that jump from bug to bug.

Alignment: As mindless automatons, scouring slingers

and scouring stanchions are always neutral.

This plantlike creature is a scouring construct, an

arti cial being created by druid magic. Its body is

covered by a layer of swarming insects.

Two kinds of scouring constructs exist. Scouring

slingers are primarily ranged attackers, throwing

smaller construct creatures grown from their own

bodies. Scouring stanchions are powerful melee

combatants, and they can use their tremendous

strength to knock foes prone or smash defensive

structures.

Two or more scouring constructs within 100 feet of

each other are able to share any damage dealt to

them individually. Scouring constructs  ghting in

concert must all be destroyed before any fall. The

swarming insects are the source of this collective

health.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Scouring constructs have no interest in treasure. Their con-

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

High-level druids, employing closely guarded magic rituals,

create scouring slingers and scouring stanchions. A scouring

slinger grows slinger scorpions, and these smaller constructs

cannot be created independently.

Scouring Slinger Construction: The secret druidic ritual

for creating a scouring slinger involves the initial creation

of three shambling mounds that are incorporated into the

creatures construction.

117,000 gp; Cost 58,500 gp + 3,000 XP.

Scouring Stanchion Construction: The secret druidic

ritual for creating a scouring stanchion requires the partici-

pation of a treant willing to sacri ce its life to become the

construct. A druid must make a DC 25 Craft (woodcarving)

check after one day of working to inscribe special runes in

the treants trunk.

CL  18th;  Craft  Construct,  creeping  doom,  animate  plants;

Price 105,000 gp; Cost 52,500 gp + 3,000 XP.

Variants: Larger scouring slingers and scouring stanchions

can be constructed. Each additional Hit Die adds 500 gp to

the cost. Repairing a scouring construct follows the normal

rules for repairing constructs (see the Craft Construct feat,

MM 303).

SCOURING CONSTRUCTS

IN EBERRON

In Khorvaire, scouring constructs are a creation of the Ash-

bound, and the druids of this militant sect are the only ones

who know the secret of such magical construction. On the

fringes of the Towering Wood, whole settlements have been

wiped from the map. Terri ed survivors speak of rapacious

plant  creatures  and  scorpionlike  terrors  with  a  thirst  for

blood. The folk of neighboring settlements are  eeing the

Reaches in droves, but what the Ashbounds ultimate goals

are, none can say.

SCOURING CONSTRUCTS

IN FAERN

Scouring constructs are a part of the legendary history of

Faern,  spoken  of  in  tales  dating  back  to  the  last  Crown

Wars. The secret of the creation of these constructs (if indeed

they were ever anything more than legend) has been lost for

millennia. Recently, however, tales of dark rites twisting the

forces of nature have emerged from the Chondalwood and

the Forest of Lethyr. Explorers and settlers pushing deep into

those realms have returned with harrowing tales of attacks

by invulnerable plant creatures.

Possessions shadow gossamer buckler

Shadow Gossamer (Ex) As a swift action, a shaedling can

generate a 15-pound or lighter item out of shadow

gossamer, and it usually crafts a weapon just before

attacking. A shaedling is proficient with any weapon it

creates from shadow gossamer, and such weapons have

a range increment 10 feet longer than usual. Shields

constructed of this substance have their armor check

penalty lessened by 1. Shadow gossamer implements

dissipate to nothingness if they leave the hands of a

shaedling for longer than 1 round.

Sleeping Curse (Su) Once per day, a shaedling can target

an opponent within 30 feet with a special javelin of

venomous shadow gossamer. A foe struck by this javelin

must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or fall asleep

for 1d6 rounds. A remove curse spell ends this effect. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Wall of Darkness (Su) Once per day, a shaedling can

generate a wall of darkness up to 30 feet long. The wall

blocks line of sight for all creatures except those that have

darkvision.

Shaedlings are malignant fey that have turned their back on

nature in favor of the Spider Queen, Lolth.

that seems the weakest. If it can, it uses a wall of darkness to

cordon the combat zone to its liking.

In a group, shaedlings use walls of darkness to divide

their foes and control the battlefield. They divide into two

attack formations. One formation flies high above, throw-

ing javelins, while the second group hovers 10 feet above

the enemy, attacking with spiked chains. The shaedlings

using chains try their best to harry foes that can attack

the throwers.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Shaedlings prefer the tactical superiority that numbers

provide. When caught alone, a shaedling has a particular task

or goal, which it completes,  eeing afterward.

Dark Raider (EL 2): A shaedling that was left behind by

its kin when it overslept hurries to catch up. It hasnt had a

good meal in 24 hours, so it raids the PCs camp to snatch a

backpack or sack and make off with some food. If it can kill

a mortal in the process, all the better.

Retrieval Crew (EL 9): A banshrae (page 10) with four

shaedlings in tow pursues the PCs. It seems their dark mis-

tress wants a treasure the characters acquired on their last

adventure, and she wont take no for an answer. In fact, if the

banshrae has its way, shell get her treasure and the heads of

a few mortals to boot.

ECOLOGY

Shaedlings origins are linked to the same schism that drove

elves and drow apart. A small number of pixies followed the

drow in their reverence for Lolth, but they didnt follow the

drow underground. The Queen of the Demonweb Pits blessed

these pixies to become a terror in the places other fey and

elves love best. She gave them their ability to weave shadow

as spiders weave webs.

This creature is a shaedling, a hateful fey with

command over shadow. This result reveals all fey

traits.

The spinnerets on a shaedlings belly allow it

to form weapons and other implements from

shadowy strands. A shaedling can also weave a

wall of shadow to block sight.

Shaedlings can use a special javelin to put a

creature and, potentially, all who touch that

creature to sleep. Their tough skin is best cut by

cold iron.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Like drow, shaedlings are a true race. Their transformation

made  them  bigger  and  stronger  than  normal  pixies,  and

largely incompatible with any other sprite. They cant mate

with their good-aligned kin.

However, they do produce shaedling offspring, and pro-

li cally. Female and male shaedlings couple wantonly, and

the females lay eggs. These eggs hatch within a month, and

infant shaedlings are fully grown within a year. Newborn

shaedlings require little care, and thats fortunate for them,

because  they  receive  little.  Some  are  born  without  any

guardian, and such siblings  ght among themselves until a

pack of the toughest ones emerges alive from the fray with

a clear leader.

Shaedlings do suffer a side effect of their powers and spider-

like life cycle. Unlike other fey, shaedlings

have short lives. Few survive past twenty

years of age.

Environment: Shaedlings

prefer  temperate  for-

ests  where  other  fey

and elves live.

Typical  Physical

Characteristics:  Shaed-

lings resemble drow elves of

short stature with solid black

eyes and dark dragon y wings.

They stand about 4 feet tall

and weigh no more than

80 pounds. Spinnerets

sprout from their stom-

achs, allowing them

to  weave  shadow

gossamera  light,

tensile  substance

stronger than a spi-

ders webbing.

Alignment: These

pernicious fey enjoy

causing  suffering

and bedlam. Whenev-

er they can, they torment and kill those unfortunate enough

to wander into their territory, working the scene so that

others are blamed. Shaedlings are born chaotic evil.

Other fey usually shun these vile creatures, if they dont

kill them on sight. Malevolent nymphs and degenerate

verdant princes sometimes welcome shaedlings into corrupt

fey courts. In such cases, shaedlings serve as spies, assassins,

and burglars, overseen by another more powerful evil fey

such as a banshrae.

Shaedlings  serve  only  in

hope of being offered the op-

portunity to wreak mayhem

on communities of human-

oid races. They respect only

displays  of  power  and

creatures  capable  of

destroying them. Their

limited life span makes

them  short-sighted.

That  trait,  coupled

with their evil nature,

makes them especially

wasteful  and  greedy,

as well as prone to  ts of

rage  if  their  whims  are  not

instantly grati ed.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Shaedlings disdain clothing and art-

work, but they enjoy shiny baubles and

magic  items.  A  shaedling  has  standard

treasure for its Challenge Rating. Elite

NPC shaedlings have equipment based

on their Challenge Rating instead of

their character level.

SHAEDLINGS WITH

CLASS LEVELS

Shaedling

Shaedlings  dont  have

the discipline to pur-

sue classes that require

commitment and con-

centration, but they are

crafty and versatile. They usually advance as rogues, be-

coming sneaky and highly skilled, but a few have natural

talent  as  sorcerers.  Rogue  is  considered  an  associated

class, but sorcerer is not.

Level Adjustment: +3.

SOCIETY

Shaedlings have a society the way a group of brigands might

be  said  to  have  a  culture.  The  strongest  creatures  lead,

and the weak submit or die. A shaedling band produces

nothing  aside  from  momentarily  useful  implements  of

shadow gossamer. Whatever else they need, they kill or

steal to obtain.

These  fey  do  have  an  affinity  for  other  evil  arachnid

creatures, as well as monstrous spiders. When they can,

shaedlings live among or near evil araneas, ettercaps, and

even driders.

SHAEDLINGS IN EBERRON

Shaedlings originated in Xendrik, where the legendary

Qabalrin (Secrets of Xendrik 52) created them during the Age

of Giants. Xendriks shaedlings arent always evil, but they

frequently ally with evil creatures, and large numbers of

them serve drow tribes as scouts.

Whispers in Sharns Lower City suggest that a terrible

Daask assassin called Vilyas is some sort of dark sprite.

Perhaps Vilyas is a shaedling.

Deaths Release (Su) When a shardsoul slayer is destroyed,

its fragment of elemental essence reunites another

slayer immediately gains one of the following effects for 2

Haste, as the spell.

+2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage

+2 enhancement bonus to AC and on saving throws.

Once a shardsoul slayer uses this ability, it becomes

inert and cannot be repaired or reanimated. However, its

raw materials can be used in the construction of more

shardsoul slayers, reducing the cost of the process by 500

gp (see For Player Characters).

Shardsoul slayers are created through a process that splinters

a single elemental spirit, binding it into a number of construct

bodies. This fragmentation pushes the elemental spirit to

the brink of madness, and a shardsoul slayer suffuses that

madness into the world around it.

Some suggest that the shardsoul slayers were created in the

image of their derro masters. Others believe that the derro are

themselves too mad to understand how dangerously insane

their creations are. Whatever the case, a shardsoul slayer is a

lethal and unpredictable weapon.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

The products of a harrowing creation, shardsoul slayers

spread their madness to as many other creatures as possible.

Shardsoul slayers use Powerful Charge whenever possible,

caring little that the AC penalty imposed by a charge only

hastens their demise. They focus their attacks on single

targets, piling on Wisdom damage to disorient that creature.

Having no regard for their continued existence, they allow

themselves to be destroyed if doing so means being able to

pass the power of deaths release to another slayer who can

 nish the  ght.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Among the derro that spawn them, shardsoul slayers act as

vanguard scouts and shock troops. However, these constructs

have an unpredictable nature, and more than a few escape

their masters to wreak havoc in the world at large. Left to

their own devices, shardsoul slayers  nd an area where they

can generate the maximum amount of chaos and violence.

As such, they are drawn to populous settlements, both in the

Underdark and on the surface.

These constructs are created in groups of three, and they

rarely appear alone. More often, shardsoul slayers created

together stay together as a unit. The derro split them up,

however, to make better use of them.

Underdark Strike Force (EL 7): Two derro (MM 49)

and a shardsoul slayer guard a narrow pass near a derro

settlement in the Underdark. The shardsoul slayer presses

any intruders, keeping them close in the cramped con-

fines of the passage to affect as many as possible with its

disorienting aura. The derro snipe from the shadows with

poisoned crossbow bolts, using their daze and sound burst

This creature is a shardsoul slayer, a dangerously

insane and brutal construct.

The attack of a shardsoul slayer affects body

and mind, dulling the instincts of even the most

steadfast warriors.

Engaging a shardsoul slayer in melee combat is

a risk. The creatures insanity is said to spread to

those who stray too close.

another of its kind is a short-lived victory. The

death of one slayer can grant another slayer

abilities on foes whose will is weakened by the shardsoul

slayers attacks.

Maddened Slaughter (EL 9): Four shardsoul slayers killed

their derro creator and  ed the Underdark for a small city on

the surface. There, the constructs wreak murderous havoc in

the busy streets, trusting in their disorienting aura to confuse

attackers and keep a crowd of addled noncombatants between

them and danger.

ECOLOGY

Unlike most other constructs, shard-

soul  slayers  have  a  rudimentary

intelligence. Shardsoul slayers are

dedicated to spreading their suf-

fering in the most violent possible

way. Though they view

their  destruction  as  a

means of reuniting their

elemental  essence  once

more,  shardsoul  slayers

yearn to live long enough

to inflict terrible pain on

others.

Environment: Shardsoul slay-

ers were originally created by

derro  spellcasters  seeking

to  unleash  pure  havoc  on

their enemies, so they are

most often found in sub-

terranean derro lairs.

They  can  be  found

anywhere  their  mas-

ters send them.

Typical  Physical  Char-

acteristics:  A  shardsoul

slayer has an appearance

as  fragmented  as

the essence bound

within it. Its metal

limbs are lean and

angular,  creating  a  haphazard  but  deadly

appearance.  Armor  plating  makes  up  the

majority of its body, but a smoother skin of blue alloy

is visible at the joints. A typical shardsoul slayer stands

5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

Alignment:  A  shardsoul  slayers  capriciousness  and

lust for violence are its only consistent features. Shard-

soul  slayers  are  usually  chaotic  evil,  capable  of  any  act

their  form  allows.  The  best  among  them  are  chaotic

neutralunpredictable but not quite as bloodthirsty. Such

shardsoul slayers are created by less wicked creatures than

the derro.

SOCIETY

Shardsoul slayers have no innate social order, and those

controlled by the derro or others do as their masters bid

them. However, when escaped slayers come across each other,

they are drawn to live and  ght as a unit. Once so bound,

shardsoul slayers can be separated only by the destruction

that frees their essence.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Shardsoul slayers have no need for treasure, but their chaotic irra-

tionality compels them to collect it anyway. They are particularly

fond of magic items, especially those of an elemental nature

devices granting protection from energy, weapons that deal

energy damage, and so on. They have standard treasure

for their Challenge Rating, usually in the form

of a single weapon or magic item.

FOR PLAYER

CHARACTERS

Shardsoul slayers are never creat-

ed as single creatures. Rather, a

group of three slayers is given

life  by  the  fragmented  es-

sence of a single elemental

spirit.  Each  crafting  of  a

group of shardsoul slayers

requires  the  creation  of  a

number  of  distinct  bodies

in which the shards of the el-

emental spirit are to reside.

ed and poured, the molten metal is blended with quicksilver,

then slowly cooled. This quicksilver costs 500 gp.

The creator then calls and binds an elemental spirit from the

Elemental Plane of Earth. A  nely crafted crystal prism worth

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Siege beetles attack fearlessly, swooping down on potential

prey and trampling. They follow up by slashing with their

scythe-shaped forelimbs, and they grab struck foes. Once

a siege beetle successfully grabs an opponent, it bites that

enemy  as  soon  as  it  can,  causing  paralysis.  It  seeks  a  new

target as soon as a foe succumbs.

If the target (or its allies) proves to be resilient or bother-

some,  the  siege  beetle   ies  off  with  its  prey.  It  drops  that

creature from a lofty height if the foe still resists.

When severely wounded, a siege beetle turns defensive.

The creature withdraws, spraying a stream of blinding musk

at opponents before  ying off. If possible, it tries to carry off

at least one opponent to devour.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Adventurers are most likely to encounter a siege beetle after

entering the territorial insects hunting grounds. Fortunately

for  those  who  would  battle  them,  siege  beetles  are  just  as

hostile to others of their race as they are to their prey, and

they are rarely encountered in groups.

The Guardian (EL 16): Deep within an immense forest

is a grove of ancient redwoods that tower hundreds of feet

into the heavens. It is said that at their apex, a portal opens to

Acheron. About two-thirds of the way up is lair of the portals

guardian, a hungry siege beetle.

Hatchlings (EL 20): A wizard sends the PCs on a quest to

recover a special material from which he promises to craft

a  powerful  suit  of  magic  armor.  He  gives  the  characters

directions to an ancient battle eld on Acheron that is said to

hold a clutch of siege beetle eggs. Although he informs the

PCs of the nature of the eggs, he assures them that the eggs

cannot hatch in the cold place they are located in. However,

a strike from another cube in Acheron opened a geothermal

vent,  which  has  warmed  the  eggs,  causing  them  to  hatch

prematurely. By the time the PCs arrive, the eggs are empty,

and four siege beetles are looking for a fresh meal.

This is a siege beetle, an enormous insect from

Siege beetles spray a blinding musk when they are

ECOLOGY

Siege beetles require ample food and plenty of

space to survive. They stop eating only long

enough to molt and reproduce. Since they

must consume immense amounts of food,

the availability of suitable habitats for them

is limited. Fiercely territorial even against

others of their kind, they violently defend

their hunting grounds. Only court-

ship scents released by willing mating

partners  can  quell  this  instinct  for

a time.

Siege beetles lay their eggs by de-

positing them into large crevasses

and similar geographic features.

They cover their clutches with

carcasses and other detritus. A

female siege beetle lays two to

four  eggs  surrounded  by  a

membrane   lled  with  sticky

ectoplasm. A single egg is over

15 feet in circumference and

looks  like  a  brown,  fleshy

seedpod.

In a few months, the eggs hatch, releasing

nymph-stage beetles. Siege beetle nymphs molt several times

before reaching the adult stage (advanced creatures with 30

HD). Each phase lasts for about a year, and large numbers of

beetles die before reaching adulthood.

Environment: Siege beetles roam the iron battle elds of

Acheron, but one might slip through to the Material Plane

by stumbling through a planar gate. The beetles instinctively

nest in dark caves or crevasses where they hibernate. When

they find a battlefield littered with corpses, they push the

bodies into one massive pile, then climb atop and begin

to eat.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical siege beetle

is the size of a barn and weighs thirty to forty tons. Its body is

longer than it is wide, supported by slender, segmented legs

covered with sticky cilia. One or two mottled colors adorn

its chitin.

All  siege  beetles  have  long,  paired  wings  that  fold

straight back underneath an outer shell. Pale and irides-

cent, the wings move so quickly that they can barely be

seen when the creature flies, though they make a loud

thrumming sound.

Alignment: Siege beetles have no concept of morality and

are always neutral.

SOCIETY

Siege beetles have no society. However, the armies that

wage war across Acheron employ these enormous insects

as war beasts. A siege beetle is an unruly soldier, however,

and more than one army has lost a battle because of its own

siege beetles.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Siege beetles are mindless, but the possessions of their vic-

tims remain after the beetle feeds. A siege beetle has half the

standard number of coins, half goods, and standard items. Its

shell is a valuable commodity in places where chitin armor is

valued (see For Player Characters), including the war camps

and strongholds of Acheron.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Siege beetle chitin is highly desirable for making chitin

armor. The chitin is treated for flexibility, then cut and

reshaped into long strips. These strips are bound together by

tightly woven cord when necessary. Siege beetle chitin armor

is always masterwork in quality, and it provides its wearer

with resistance to electricity 5 and resistance to sonic 5. A

druid who wears chitin armor crafted from a siege beetle shell

does not lose access to spells or class features. Chitin armor

exceed one-third or two-thirds of its full normal total, the

appropriate skull reappears. The skull lord then regains

the use of the ability granted by the skull.

A skull lord and the undead it controls have +4 turn

resistance as long as the skull lord has all three of its skull

heads. This turn resistance is reduced to +2 if a skull lord

has only two heads, and it is lost when a skull lord has

only one head remaining.

Bone Staff (Su) A skull lords bone staff functions as a

masterwork quarterstaff that deals an extra 1d6 points of

cold damage. A bone staff is treated as a natural weapon

for the purpose of the skull lords use of its Weapon

Finesse feat.

If a skull lord loses possession of its bone staff, the

bone staff is destroyed. A skull lord can create a new

bone staff as a swift action. To do so, it must slay one of

its created undead servitors within 30 feet. The chosen

servitor is instantly destroyed as the bone staff reappears

in the skull lords hands.

Triple Skulls (Ex) Each round as a swift action, a skull lord

can use one of these abilities: bone beckon, bone shard,

or create servitor. If a skull lord loses a skull (see skull

loss), it loses access to one of the abilities.

Bone Beckon (Su) A skull lord can use its beckoning

skull to bring forth fragments of bone from the body

of an opponent within 30 feet that has a skeletal

system. The creature must succeed on a DC 19 Will

save or take 2d6 points of damage as the shards are

torn from its body. Nonintelligent undead creatures

do not get a save.

A skull lord can instantaneously cause the shards to

be absorbed by a corporeal undead of its choice within

30 feet (including itself). The chosen undead heals 5

points of damage. Alternatively, a skull lord can hold the

shards in the mouth of its spitting skull (see the bone

shard ability).

This creature is a skull lord, a sinister undead with

powers over lesser undead creatures. Skull lords

are capable of raising skeletal undead to do their

evil bidding.

Skull lords wield bone staffs and spit bone shards

at range. Both attacks deal cold damage, and a

skull lord is immune to cold-based attacks.

Skull lords can cause bone shards to be wrenched

from a creatures body, then subsequently spit

them back at the same creature with unerring

accuracy.

32  When a skull lord takes enough damage, it loses

one of its skulls and the special power granted to

it by that skull. Its ability to create undead goes

 rst, followed by its spitting skull. Destroying

the skulls also makes turning a skull lord and its

minions easier.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Bone Shard (Su) A skull lords spitting skull can spit

shards of bone from its mouth. A bone shard attack

has a range increment of 30 feet.

If a skull lord has used the bone

beckon ability to hold bone shards

wrenched from a creature, it

can fire those shards with

this ability. If the skull

lord fires bone shards at

the same creature the

shards were taken from,

the bone shard attack

automatically hits unless

the target has total cover

or total concealment. A

skull lord must make

this special bone shard

attack in the round

immediately after

it brings forth the

shards with its bone

beckon ability.

Create Servitor

(Su) A skull lords

creator skull can

create a bonespur

(page 156), a serpentir

(page 158), or a

skeleton from nearby

bones and bone

shards. Undead

created by this ability

are automatically under

the skull lords control.

A skull lord can have

a number of undead

under the control of its

creator skull equivalent

to an EL 7 encounter.

For example, a skull lord

might have four bonespurs,

three serpentirs, or a cloud giant

skeleton under its control. It could

also control a mix of undead, such as

five human skeletons, three bonespurs,

and a serpentir.

create a spectral rider (page 160) from the remains of a

mounted warrior. The spectral rider is loyal to the skull

lord, but it is not controlled. Through use of this

ability, a skull lord can have one spectral rider

servant at a time, creating a new one only after

an existing servant is destroyed.

The  twelve  skull  lords  arose  from

the  ashes  of  the  Black  Tower  of

Vrakmul. Whether they were created

intentionally by that mad necroman-

cer or came forth spontaneously from

the foul energies of his fallen sanctum,

none can say. However, legends state

that  since  Vrakmuls  fall,  the  twelve

have  sought  his  lost  regaliaa  mask

of the skull, a rod of withering, and a staff

of  necromancy.  With  these  items,  they

plan  to  recall  Vrakmul  from  destruc-

tion,  rejoining  his  shattered  soul  and

re-forming his phylactery so that he

might rise as a lich.

Strategies

and Tactics

Skull  lords  prefer  to

avoid  direct  conflict

in favor of mastermind-

ing attacks by those they

command. Typically, a skull lord

sends its servitors and minions

into  melee  while  it  hangs  back,

using them as a shield. A skull lord

uses  scrolls  and  its  bone  beckon

and bone shard abilities against foes

that attack directly, and creates more

servitors as the need arises. Skull lords are

equally effective in melee combat, however,

and they put their grisly bone staffs to good

Skull lord

Servitors in the presence of a skull lord at the

beginning of an encounter earn experience points

for PCs as normal if they are fought and defeated.

Servitors created during combat are treated as

summoned monsters, which do not provide additional

experience points.

Create Spectral Rider (Su) Once per month, a skull lord

can engage in a 12-hour ritual under the dark moon to

use if pressed.

Sample Encounter

A skull lord is never encountered without undead minions,

and independent sentient undead might willingly serve a

skull lord. Individual skull lords avoid congregating so that

they cannot be struck down all at once.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

VRAKMUL?

The skull lords background information makes reference to

the  necromancer  Vrakmul,  establishing  these  creatures  as

being limited in number and having a specific goal. You can

take this idea and run with it, inventing the history of Vrakmul

and deciding what purpose the twelve skull lords play in your

campaign. Alternatively, skull lords might simply be a powerful

new form of undead with no specific background or number.

Skull lords might be the result of failed attempts at achieving

lichdom, the undead remains of a race of three-headed beings,

or a single creature formed from the magical amalgamation of

three corpses.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Tomb Marauders (EL 9): While raiding a tomb for the

relics contained within it, a skull lord convinced two mum-

mies (MM 190) to follow it. Now the skull lord continues its

search for lost magic, crossing paths with adventurers who

are doing the same. The mummies despair ability paralyzes

characters who stand in their way, allowing the skull lords

summoned servitors to make coup de grace attacks against

such foes.

Ecology

Skull lords are undead, and as such, they do not have a

signi cant effect on the environment. Though they rely on

skeletal corpses to create their servitors, skull lords do not

indiscriminately lay waste to populations of living creatures

unless such destruction serves a larger purpose. Skull lords

have more speci c aims, requiring them to work with circum-

spection, but they take direct action if the need arises.

Environment: Skull lords operate in secret, creating lairs

for themselves below ancient ossuaries, taking up residence

in cemeteries, or making homes in the dark depths of empty

catacombs.  Any  location  that  features  an  ample  supply  of

skeletal remains makes an excellent place for a skull lord to

base its operations.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Humanoid in form and

having three skulls, a skull lord is immediately recognizable.

Each skull lords armor and cloak are scribed with its own

dark motifs, so individual skull lords are distinct from one

another. These creatures stand about 6 feet tall, but their

skeletal forms weigh only 50 pounds.

Alignment: Skull lords prefer complicated and precise

planning to rash action. Though not all skull lords are lawful

in alignment, all are uniformly evil.

Society

Other than their coterie of undead followers, skull lords typi-

cally work alone. Each seeks Vrakmuls regalia and the other

arcane secrets necessary to bring back their dark lord. On

rare occasions, skull lords meet to discuss recent intelligence

and formulate plans, particularly if one of their number has

recently been destroyed.

Typical Treasure

Skull lords are vain creatures, and they have an appreciation

for the effect their appearance can have on terri ed mortals.

They wear circlets and bracelets of gold and silver, adorning

their talonlike hands with jeweled rings. Skull lords also

covet magic items, particularly those that might help them

in their search for Vrakmuls regalia and those they can wield

in combat. With their expertise in Use Magic Device, skull

lords can read scrolls and employ magic items with ease. They

have  double  standard  treasure  for  their  Challenge  Rating

in  nery and magic items. The skull lord presented in this

entry has 2,275 gp worth of scrolls before combat, so it can

still have standard treasure generated for it.

BONESPUR

A macabre column of bone suddenly springs to life, fragments and

shards near the top shaping themselves into a parody of a skull. A

bone arm sprouting from the side of the column ends in a scything

blade of gleaming white. Then, even as you watch, the creature

collapses in on itself, recon guring into a rhinolike quadruped that

charges with great speed.

Boneshard Blast (Su) Once per day, as a free action

immediately following a charge, a bonespur can explode

in a shower of bone shards. Creatures within 10 feet of

the bonespur take 2d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 12

half). The shards of the bonespur transform into its

normal towering shape at the beginning of its next turn.

Charging Form (Su) Once per day, as a swift action, a

bonespur can transform from a column of bone into a

rhinolike form. In this form, its speed increases to 40 feet

and its scythe is transformed into a hornlike structure.

The scythe deals normal damage. If a bonespur hits with

its scythe after charging, however, the weapon deals an

extra 2d6 points of damage.

Bonespurs are animalistic monstrosities created only for

 ghting and killing.

Strategies and Tactics

When first encountered, a bonespur slashes its bone scythe

menacingly  before  shifting  into  its  charging  form  and

racing at the nearest group of enemies. At the end of its

charge, it uses its boneshard blast ability, reshaping into

a column of bone on its next turn and attacking all that

come within reach.

Though a bonespur is of limited intelligence,

it recognizes the advantage of pushing oppo-

nents into pits or off ledges, and it makes bull

rush attacks whenever possible. At the same

time, a bonespur has no sense of self-preserva-

tion,  and  these  creatures  have  been  known  to

follow opponents over the edge of cliffs in the

zealousness of a bull rush attack.

Sample Encounters

Though  bonespurs  serve  at  the

side  of  the  skull  lord  or  spell-

caster who created them, their

errands of destruction some-

times see them sent far from

their masters. They seldom

appear in large groups.

Graveyard  Terror  (EL

ence has terri ed the

local townsfolk, and it

charges any characters

who pass through the

cemetery gates.

Caravan  of  Death

Bonespur

(EL 6): Three  atbed wagons piled high with

dirt-caked bones make their way through the empty wilder-

ness, each pulled by an owlbear skeleton (MM 226). What the

PCs who observe do not know is that the caravan is actually

a skull lords trap designed to lure them to their doom. The

piles of bones are three dormant bonespurs that rise up and

attack as soon as the caravan is approached.

Ecology

Bonespurs were  rst created by skull lords, whose create

servitor ability can bring these dread creatures into existence.

Necromancers and other spellcasters sometimes learn the

secret of creating bonespurs.

Environment: Though they are highly mobile in their

charging  form,  bonespurs  are  typically  found  near  the

place of their creation. Skull lords and necromancers create

bonespurs in battle elds, graveyards, and wherever suf cient

quantities of bones can be found. Skull lords also have their

minions collect bones to be brought back to their lair, where

they create bonespurs as macabre sentries or soldiers.

Typical Physical Characteristics: In its normal form, a

bonespur appears to be a 12-foot-tall column of bone, 5 feet

around at the base and slowly tapering toward its top. Bones

and shards near the top of the tower form a mas-

sive skull shape, with a compound skeletal arm

reaching out from its side. When charging, the

bonespur transforms into a 12-foot-long rhino-

like shape, exploding in a cloud of bone shards as it

slams into its opponents. In either incarnation, a

bonespurs skeletal form weighs 400 pounds.

Alignment: These creatures have ani-

mal intelligence, but they are driven by utter

loyalty  to  their  creator  and  the  corrupt  en-

ergy that animates them. They are uniformly

lawful evil.

Typical Treasure

Bonespurs are simple creatures that have

little use for trinkets or trophies. How-

ever,  they  sometimes  collect  wealth

from slain opponents as an offering

to their masters. Bonespurs have half

standard treasure for their Challenge

Rating, mostly in jewels and oth-

er  adornments  that  can  be

found  among  the  shattered

remains  of  the  creature

after it is destroyed.

Serpentir

Advancement 912 HD (Large); 1318 HD (Huge)

Dual Actions (Ex) A serpentirs two independent heads

allow it to take two rounds worth of action in any given

round, as if it were two creatures. Thus, a serpentir can

use two standard actions and two move actions, two

full-round actions and two 5-foot steps, or some other

combination.

All-Around Vision (Ex) A serpentirs two heads allow it to

look in any direction, providing a +4 racial bonus on Spot

and Search checks. Opponents gain no benefit when

flanking a serpentir.

Sense Emotions (Su) This ability functions like blindsense,

except that a serpentir can detect only the presence and

positions of living creatures.

Stability (Ex) A serpentir has better than average footing and

leverage. It gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to

resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the

ground (but not when climbing, flying, or otherwise not

standing firmly on the ground).

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a serpentir must

hit an opponent of up to Medium size with two or

more claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity.

A grappled opponent can be drawn into the

serpentirs churning ribs as a free action.

Churning Ribs (Ex) A serpentirs elongated torso of

prehensile ribs can chew creatures to pieces. Any

Medium or smaller opponent successfully grappled

by a serpentir can be drawn into the churning ribs as

a free action. When this occurs, the serpentir is no

longer considered to be grappling and can act and move

normally, dragging the creature with it as it goes.

Opponents in the churning ribs remain grappled

until they succeed on a grapple check against the

serpentir, allowing them to claw their way free. A creature

within the churning ribs takes 2d6 points of

piercing damage at the beginning of each of the

serpentirs turns.

Skills Serpentirs have a +4 racial bonus on

Listen checks and a +8 racial bonus on Hide,

Move Silently, and Climb checks. A serpentir

can choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened. Serpentirs use either their

Strength or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks,

whichever is higher.

Serpentirs are unnatural predators, preferring to stalk

foes from the shadows rather than face them in a stand-up

 ght. Their talent for stealth and their speed make them

favor quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics.

Strategies and Tactics

A serpentir conceals itself from foes whenever possible,

shadowing them for hours as it sizes up their abilities

and  learns  their  habits.  It  takes  great  delight  in

attacking without warning, using walls, ceilings,

and difficult terrain to its advantage. A serpentir

attempts  to  grapple  a  weak-looking  creature,  draw

that foe into its churning ribs, then retreat. If it has had

time to prepare, it takes a preplanned escape route that is

difficult for foes to follow, such as a steep mine shaft or a

rubble-filled corridor. If this tactic proves successful, the

serpentir continues to stalk the group, attacking in the

same way at the next opportunity.

If cornered or forced to fight, a serpentir does not shy

away from battle. It moves quickly as one move action,

then brings five claw attacks to bear against individual tar-

gets, using its remaining standard and full-round actions.

A  cornered  serpentir  faced  with  only  a  single  creature

always  attempts  to  grapple  and  draw  that  foe  into  its

churning ribs.

Sample Encounters

Serpentirs are made to serve the masters who created them.

They sometimes escape, however, slaying indiscriminately

as they roam free. Like bonespurs, they are rarely found in

large numbers.

Mine Killer (EL 4): Crews working in a local iron mine

recently broke through to a series of ancient catacombs, but

since the discovery, miners have begun to go missing. The

catacombs are the prowling ground of a serpentir that was

trapped in a cave-in centuries ago. Now free, it stalks anyone

foolish enough to enter the dark depths of the mine. The

serpentir  uses  the  mines  shafts  to  move  about  and  stalk

anyone exploring its lair.

The Vampires Pets (EL 10): A noble-turned-vampire

(MM 250) named Dramethius Kobal has discovered two

serpentirs in a vault beneath his familys estate. The 5th-

Serpentirs are dreadful snakelike undead formed

from several skeletons. This result reveals all

undead traits.

Serpentirs are deadly hunters who can sense living

beings. They stalk prey before attacking, grabbing

foes and dragging them off to be devoured in the

darkness.

24  A serpentirs ribs act as prehensile legs, allowing

it to move at great speed. These ribs also form a

churning maw that can shred creatures trapped

within it.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

serpentir  is  slain,  Dramethius  and  his  three  vampire

spawn attack.

Ecology

A serpentir is born with a hunger it can never satisfy. Com-

pelled to devour living prey, these creatures are then forced to

watch their mangled meals drop through empty ribs, leaving

them eternally ravenous.

The skull lords created serpentirs, but their uncontrol-

lable urge for slaughter has led a lot of these creatures to

escape their servitude. Necromancers have since learned

the art of creating these menaces, and chaotic necromantic

cabals spawn such dangerous predators as implements of

mindless terror.

Environment: Serpentirs favor underground environ-

ments, and they are spawned with an innate understanding

of the subterranean world. Their urge to feed on the living

leads a large number of free serpentirs to seek hunting

grounds near humanoid settlements. Mines are a favored

habitat,  as  are  the  sewer  tunnels  beneath  human  cities.

Graveyards  riddled  with  catacombs,  shantytowns  built

around twisting alleyways, and abandoned castles make

good serpentir lairs.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A serpentir consists

of a number of skeletal torsos linked together spine to spine,

forming a serpentlike mass of twisting ribs and vertebrae

some 15 feet long and weighing 300 pounds. At each end,

the creature bears a skull and two long arms with clawed

hands. The prehensile ribs of a serpentir click softly as they

undulate, shifting like the myriad legs of a centipede. Bits

of  decaying   esh  and  shreds  of  rotten  cloth  cling  to  the

creatures jagged bones, remnants of its previous unsatisfy-

ing meals.

Alignment: Though created to serve, serpentirs are driven

to near-madness by their insatiable hunger. Even when under

the direction of a skull lord or a spellcaster, they are uniformly

chaotic evil.

Typical Treasure

Serpentirs care nothing for material wealth. Though they

ignore the possessions of their shredded meals, jewelry

or weaponry occasionally becomes wedged between these

creatures ribs. Other treasure left behind by a serpentirs

victims typically litters its hunting grounds. They have

standard treasure for their Challenge Rating, strewn over

a wide area.

For Player Characters

A spellcaster of 10th level or higher can create a serpentir

using the create undead spell. Creating a serpentir requires

skeletal remains equivalent to six Medium creatures.

Spectral riders act as elite bodyguards and retainers to their

Strategies and Tactics

In combat, spectral riders prefer to let lesser undead minions

go  before  them.  They  then  often  summon  their  phantom

steeds and charge while incorporeal into the back ranks of the

enemy to attack spellcasters. However, spectral riders target

paladins  and  divine  spellcasters  who  are  obviously  good-

aligned  rst in any fray. Their contempt for such opponents

is extreme, as is their fear of the power these foes bring to

bear against evil creatures and undead.

Whether engaging single foes or small groups, spectral

riders delight in deceit and betrayal. They use their shroud

of living days ability to approach, then offer a hand in friend-

ship, subsequently attacking with their de ling touch. Once

melee is joined, spectral riders lay into opponentsthey save

smite attacks for the most powerful good characters.

Sample Encounter

Each spectral rider is born of particular circumstances, and

encounters with a rider can play into an extensive back story.

Due to the method of a riders creation, instances when more

than one appears are rare.

Fallen  Champion  (EL  6):  Sir  Drevamor  Tain  was  one

of  the  most  famed  knights  of  his  day.  A  vision  of  youth,

strength, and beauty, Tain was cut down in the early days of

his adventuring career. But his example inspired his sons to

become the  nest knights of the realm.

Now, three hundred years later, a skull lord has de led

Sir Drevamors tomb and raised the long-dead knight as a

spectral rider. Tain patrols the region his family protected

for generations, his true nature concealed by his shroud of

living days. The common folk believe Tain to be a hero come

to  ght the evil sweeping across their land. Sadly for them,

the spectral rider plans to deliver as many innocent victims

as possible to the skull lord.

Ecology

Spectral riders are knights of the skull lords. Blackguards

and evil knights are the individuals who most commonly

become spectral riders after death. However, even the holi-

est of paladins can be polluted by foul necromantic magic

and twisted into these dark warriors. The rituals that create

a  spectral  rider  involve  unspeakable  desecrations  of  the

corpse. In the case of paladins or holy knights, deception is

used to lure the spirit back to its body, binding a pure soul

to tainted dead  esh.

Environment: Spectral riders serve at their masters plea-

sure, and they go where they are sent. If freed from service,

spectral riders haunt their ancestral lands or the place where

they were slain, spreading evil and death wherever they go.

All spectral riders take great pleasure

in employing deception and trickery,

even  those  who  were  paragons  of

good when they lived. Spectral riders

created from paladins and good knights

relish the irony of their newfound taste

for deceit.

Typical Treasure

Spectral  riders  gather  their

former  family  heirlooms  and

treasures for themselves. They

have double standard treasure

for  their  Challenge  Rating,

usually  in  the  form  of  jew-

els, art objects, and treasured

magic arms and armor.

For Player Characters

A spellcaster of 12th level or higher can create

a spectral rider using a create greater undead

spell. The PC must  nd a suitable subject

corpsea mounted warrior of at

least 6th level at the time

of his or her death.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:

When not hidden behind their shroud

of living days, these mournful undead

knights can be identi ed by the ghostly

skull-like visage within their helms. Their

armor resembles what the individual wore

in life, but it is studded with spikes and

barbs. Coats of arms are twisted into mock-

eries of their original form, with honorable

crests and emblems besmirched by evil.

Spectral  riders  average  6  feet  in  height,

but  their  skeletal  forms  weigh  only

40 pounds.

Alignment: Spectral riders

believe  in  order  and  disci-

pline, and they enjoy lording

their power and in uence over the

lesser  minions  of  their  masters.

They reluctantly bow to authority,

willingly serving necromancers or

skull lords if this service gives them

a chance to spread wickedness

among the living. They are

almost always lawful evil.

Society

Spectral riders are bound

to the master who cre-

ated them, and they

are uni ed by a con-

temptible hatred of

the living. This hatred manifests in a vi-

cious need to corrupt other mortal knights

and send them to their graves, ensuring that

the ranks of undeath always have new recruits.

SKULL LORDS

IN EBERRON

From their appearance alone, the

skull lords are typically assumed to

be  agents  of  Vol  the  lich  queen.  In  fact,

the skull lords are some of Vols most potent

foes, seeking vengeance against the self-styled

Queen  of  the  Dead  for  allowing  the  power

of undeath to be controlled by her living servants. Skull

lords operate independently across Khorvaire, engaging in

schemes to raise Vrakmul, as well as opposing the Order of

the Emerald Claw and the Blood of Vol cult.

SKULL LORDS IN FAERN

The Battle of Bones is a popular destination for Faerns

necromancers, and it is rumored that the  rst skull lords

were spawned in that cursed place. Today, necromancers who

create bonespurs and serpentirs are drawn to the bleached

bone-drifts of these lifeless  elds. The faithful of Velsharoon

are rumored to be creating great forces of serpentirs there

for their own dark purposes.

The skull lords are said to hold their infrequent meet-

ings at the Battle of Bones, typically in deepest winter. In

the weeks before these unholy assemblies, spectral riders

are seen ranging from the High Forest to the Dragonmere,

and  everyone  fears  their  passage.  The  purposes  of  the

skull lords are inscrutable, though, and their meetings

are brief.

Spectral riders are elite undead knights in the service

of skull lords or powerful necromancers. They ride

ghostly steeds that they can summon at will.

These dark knights spread desecration with every

step, and they can assume a ghostly incorporeal form

as they move. They are protected against goodness,

and their weapons are made unholy by their touch.

Spectral riders can slay creatures with a mere touch,

and good creatures fall more easily to this de lement.

They can assume the guise of their former mortal

SPAWN OF JUIBLEX

For  untold  millennia,  the  demon  lords  Zuggtmoy  and

Juiblex have struggled for control of Shedaklah, the 222nd

layer of the Abyss. Centuries ago, Zuggtmoy used a series

of powerful divinations to determine the Demon Lord of

Oozes exact location within Shedaklah. She then erected a

series of adamantine plinths throughout the Abyssal layer

and triggered a powerful ritual meant to banish Juiblex to

a different plane.

Unfortunately for Zuggtmoy and the rest of the cosmos,

the ritual simply sent a portion of Juiblexs polluted form

to the Elemental Plane of Water. Though weakened, the

Faceless Lord survived, but the toxic and virulent nature

of  his  material  form  corrupted  the  elemental  matter

around it. The denizens of the plane near this polluted

area combined their power to contain the corruption and

send  it  to  its  own  demiplane.  Though  this  process  was

successful,  it  scattered  the  spawn  of  Juiblex  across  the

Material Plane.

LESSER SPAWN OF JUIBLEX

A giant mass of dark liquid rears upward, its surface heaving as

it spatters the area around it with globs of slime. Dozens of small

red eyes dot the creatures surface, glaring at you like beacons of

hunger and hate.

Sludge Form (Ex) A spawn of Juiblex flows like thick, muddy

water as it moves. Its movement never provokes attacks

of opportunity. It ignores difficult terrain and can freely

pass through other creatures spaces, though it cannot

end its movement in such a place.

If a lesser spawn of Juiblex enters a living

creatures space, that creature must attempt a DC 18

Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes

2d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 round. On

a successful save, the creature takes half damage and

is not sickened.

This ability is effective against a given creature only

once per round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Slimy Infestation (Su) When a spawn of Juiblex deals damage

to a creature with its slam attack, it covers its target with

a thick coat of slime. At the start of the spawns turn, it

can animate the slime covering all foes within 100 feet

as a free action. The slime sprouts tentacles and attacks

any creature within 10 feet (including the target if no

other creatures are in reach). It makes a slam attack with

an attack bonus equal to the spawns (normally +12),

dealing damage equal to 1d8 points + 1/2 the spawns Str

modifier (normally +3).

A creature afflicted by slimy infestation can remove

the slime as a full-round action. The slime is also

destroyed if the creature it covers is dealt 10 points of

cold or fire damage. If that creature has resistance to cold

or fire, the slime could be destroyed without harm to the

affected creature.

Though they are the weakest of the Faceless Lords favored

children, lesser spawn of Juiblex are potent threats. These

massive elemental creatures wander through dungeons

and  other  desolate  areas,  killing  and  devouring  all  in

their path.

deep tunnels sometimes hint at the presence of these beings,

and intelligent creatures stay far away from such areas.

A hulking mass of tarry, steaming ooze rears impossibly high. Con-

vulsions wrack the surface of this enormous creature as it burbles

are evenly set around its bulk, with dozens of smaller eyes spread

across the creatures skin.

The world can be thankful that these largest and mightiest

spawn of Juiblex are rare. Whispered legends speak of these

creatures as vile masses bubbling up from forgotten caves to

consume whole towns. An elder spawn of Juiblex can blot

out the sun as it surges forward like a living wave. When it

is done, it leaves little more than ruins and scattered bones

behind it.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Regardless of their intelligence, spawn of Juiblex display

an uncanny cunning. In ruins or inhabited areas, they

choose lairs that allow them to quickly launch themselves

at unsuspecting targets. Whether a lesser spawn spilling

out from behind a closed door or an elder spawn lingering

beneath the surface of a black lake, a spawn of Juiblex that

gains surprise attempts to use its sludge form to sicken

and harm all creatures unfortunate enough to stand in

its path.

When battle is joined, the spawn strike as many different

foes as possible to get the most out of its slimy infestation.

Greater and elder spawn even risk attacks of opportunity to

throw sludge orbs at distant targets to infest those adversar-

ies. Once engaged, these creatures use their sludge form

to move and sicken as many opponents as possible each

round, trusting in their considerable abilities to quickly

even the odds.

Greater spawn and elder spawn of Juiblex are intelligent

enough to distinguish between living creatures and nonliv-

ing ones such as undead and constructs. They typically ignore

the latter, but they defend themselves if attacked.

This nauseating mass of toxic sludge is a spawn

163

All spawn of Juiblex are native to the Demiplane of Filth

(see below).

Typical Physical Characteristics: A spawn of Juiblex is

an oozelike entity that spreads in a rough circle. Its semi-

liquid form is a putrid green shot through with swirls of

black, brown, and yellow, constantly spurting and heaving

as it churns.

Lesser spawn are about 10 feet in diameter and weigh

approximately one and one-half tons. Greater spawn are 20

feet in diameter and can weigh ten tons. Elder spawn are 40

feet in diameter and weigh some sixty tons.

Alignment:  All  spawn  of  Juiblex  carry  the  corrupt

essence  of  their  progenitor  lord.  They  are  uniformly

chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Spawn of Juiblex have no need of treasure and do not collect

it. However, unlike the oozes it resembles, a spawn is not

acidic, and any treasure its victims were carrying remains

intact  and  scattered  throughout  its  lair.  In  rare  cases,  a

spawn  of  Juiblex  captures  and  holds  treasure  or  magic

items within its heaving form. Such items are invariably

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Scattered as they are across the Material Plane, spawn of

Juiblex are usually encountered alone. Even when new

creatures are spawned from the old, they quickly go their own

way, driven to spread their destructive potential.

Lone Spawn (EL 614): Though spawn of Juiblex have

no direct connection to the Faceless Lord, they retain the

instinctual intellect of their progenitor. These creatures

are  drawn  to  places  of  great  power,  including  magical

locations,  the  resting  places  of  lost  artifacts,  ancient

altars dedicated to mighty evil, or gates to the Abyss and

other planes.

EL 10: An isolated monastery comes under assault by

random  bands  of  creatures  from  the  Underdark.  How-

ever, not until the catacombs beneath the monastery are

explored is it realized that these waves of monsters are

fleeing the presence of a greater spawn of Juiblex, drawn

to the presence of a powerful magic weapon guarded by

the monastic order.

The spawn of Juiblex have no place in the natural world, but

they are adept at destroying it. Once it has consumed enough

food, a spawn of any size splits off a new lesser spawn. Spawn

of  Juiblex  indiscriminately  kill  all  other  living  creatures

except oozes and slimes.

Environment: Though spawn of Juiblex can survive in

almost any nondamaging environment, they keep to sub-

terranean passages and dungeons, retaining their demon

lords preference for underground lairs. Spawn prefer to

fight  in  tight,  winding  passages,  since  open  ground

allows their prey to separate and attack from range.

ADVANCED SPAWN OF JUIBLEX

Spawn of Juiblex grow larger by devouring massive amounts

of organic matter. Though a spawn typically splits off a new

lesser spawn of Juiblex regardless of its own size, one of

these creatures sometimes simply continues to grow.

DEMIPLANE OF FILTH

This strange demiplane was formed when the denizens

of the Elemental Plane of Water banished the corruption

of Juiblexs essence from their realm. The demiplane is

a  mockery  of  a  verdant  forest,  with  trees  and  ground

formed  of  pulsating  slimesome  of  which  is  green

slime. Streams and ponds of reeking watery ooze dot the

landscape. A green sun hangs in a yellow sky that darkens

by  night  to  a  featureless  black  curtain.  Great  clouds  of

insects fill the air, and otyughs and other foul creatures

splash through the mire.

The Demiplane of Filth is 25 miles wide and 10 miles long.

At its center stands a stone monolith 50 feet on each side

and 400 feet tall. In a small hut atop the monolith dwells

a  gure, appearing to be an elderly human male,

known simply as the Hermit. Made of a single

shard of Juiblexs essence, the Hermit knows much of the

cosmos and the history of the Abyss. Those who agree to

complete a task for him can ask a single question.

The Hermit is an avatar of Juiblex. He answers questions

that further his masters aimsnamely to defeat Zuggt-

moy and avenge the insult done to the Faceless Lord. The

quests he sends adventurers on invariably involve Juiblexs

enemies, though at times they have worked toward more

inscrutable ends.

When approached, the Hermit holds his eyes and mouth

closed, opening them when he is addressed. When they are

opened, green slime slowly leaks from them to devour his

body as the question is answered and the task is set. Yet the

next time a group enters his hut, the Hermit is there once

more, patiently awaiting visitors.

Oozes and spawn of Juiblex prowl the Demiplane of Filth,

as do those seeking Juiblexs favor. Powerful cults to the

Faceless Lord build permanent gates to this wretched place,

conducting sacri cial rites here or luring away a powerful

creature to wreak havoc on the Material Plane.

SPAWN OF JUIBLEX IN EBERRON

In Eberron, Spawn of Juiblex are known as chaos spawn.

When the daelkyr invasion was overcome by the sealing

of the gates linking Eberron and Xoriat, destructive rifts

rippled through all the planes. Where the corrupting mad-

ness of Xoriat touched Lamannia, the Twilight Forest, it

created these terrible creatures and set them loose on the

Material Plane. Today, chaos spawn spread destruction and

madness in the depths of Khyber and the ruins of Eberrons

lost civilizations.

Sense Emotions (Su) This ability functions like blindsense,

except that a spirrax can detect only the presence and

positions of living creatures.

Indifference Aura (Su) At the end of each of a spirraxs

turns, creatures within 180 feet of it must succeed on

a DC 27 Will save or be affected by calm emotions, as

the spell. In addition, creatures that fail their saves

can move no more than double their speed each

round. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains

within the area or until it is attacked by the spirrax.

A successful save negates the effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

A creature that successfully saves or is attacked by a

spirrax cannot be affected again by that same spirraxs

aura for 24 hours.

Fortification (Ex) 50% chance to ignore the additional

damage dealt by a critical hit or sneak attack.

Consumption (Su) Living creatures successfully grappled by

a spirrax take 1d6 points of Constitution drain.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a spirrax must hit with

a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can

use its consumption ability in following rounds.

Death Spiral (Su) When a spirrax dies, a planar rift opens up

around it for 1d4 rounds, sucking everything within 150

feet to another plane of existence (determined randomly).

A DC 25 Will save negates this effect.

As long as the rift remains open, a creature that

succeeds on its save can choose to enter ittypically to

follow comrades who have failed their saves. After this

time, the rift seals permanently, taking the body of the

spirrax with it.

reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this blast leave behind

only a fine powder, but their equipment is unaffected.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Adamantine Shell (Ex) A spirrax is surrounded by an organic

shell laced with adamantine. This shell grants a +16

armor bonus, DR 15/adamantine, the ability to fly, and

50% fortification. The shell can be used only by a spirrax.

When a spirrax is reduced to one-quarter of its full

normal hit points or fewer, its shell collapses, causing the

creature to lose the benefits provided by the shell.

Putrid Form (Ex) When a spirraxs adamantine shell

collapses, its normal forma mass of tentacles,

putrescent alien organs, and a single bulging eyeis

revealed. Any living creature that comes within 10 feet of

a spirrax in its putrid form is sickened. In addition, that

creature must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be

nauseated for 1 round.

A spirrax in its putrid form gains two additional

tentacle attacks when making a full attack.

Spirraxes wander the planes, consuming all living matter

they come across. Whole worlds are said to have been laid

waste as a result of their insatiable hunger.

seventy tons.

SAMPLE

ENCOUNTER

Spirraxes can be encountered

anywhere  except  under-

ground. As a general rule, they

do not work together. How-

ever, when more than one

appears on a given world,

their destructive paths start

in the same area.

Into the Void (EL 18):

What  was  once  a  land  of

verdant forests and fertile

farmsteads is now a dead

ruin.  A  spirrax  appeared

here  two  weeks  ago  and

has slowly been consuming

everything in its widening

spiral of destruction. A few ref-

ugees have managed to escape

the creature, spreading tales of

the  oating doom that seems

set to destroy the world.

ECOLOGY

Little is known of the spirraxes,

but these creatures do not ap-

pear to age or reproduce. Sages

believe that only a fraction of the

material a spirrax consumes is used to

nourish  the  creature,  but  what  happens

to the rest of the living matter it destroys

remains unknown.

Though spirraxes do not sleep, these creatures go into

periods of inactivity for up to one month each year, float-

ing lazily through the sky with their tentacles drawn into

their shells.

Environment: Spirraxes can be found in aboveground

environments where living matter is abundant. When a

spirrax first appears in an area, it begins flying in a spiral

Alignment: A spirrax lives only

to  collect  matter  in  an  orderly

and precise pattern, based on an-

cient  principles  (see  Society).  Its

alien  mindset  entertains  no  other

thoughts. These creatures are always

lawful evil.

SOCIETY

Spirraxes represent the last rem-

nants  of  a  dying  demiplane.

Millennia  ago,  the  powerful

civilization that had arisen

there fell victim to a magi-

cal catastrophe that caused

its world to decay. The resi-

dents of this ancient society,

believing they were unable to save

themselves by any other means, cre-

ated  the   rst  spirraxes  and  sent

them to other planes. These crea-

tures were designed to consume

living matter and transport it

back to the demiplane, where

that matter, converted to en-

ergy, might be used to halt

the destruction.

Spirraxes have no society.

Though they have been observed

encountering others of their kind, no

hint of communication between two or more

of them has yet been seen.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Spirraxes have no interest in treasure, though metal and stone

items in abundance can be found in their wake. A spirrax has

double standard treasure for its Challenge Rating. Half of

this treasure is in the form of coins, gems, and metal or stone

magic items left behind it, with the other half representing

the value of the 150 pounds or more of adamantine that can

be stripped from the dead creatures shell.

STEELWING

An immense avian form darkens the sky, its majestic shape somehow

incongruous with its plumage of dull gray. The noble birds crested

head arches back, and its screech shakes the earth. As it wings closer,

you see that its feathers glint with keen edges.

Razorfeather Shield (Ex) A steelwing generates a storm

of razorfeathers around its body. At the beginning of a

steelwings turn, any creature within 5 feet of it takes

5d6 points of slashing damage. In addition, the storm

of whirling steel feathers gives a steelwing concealment

against any nonadjacent opponents.

Razorfeathers (Ex) Razorfeathers used at range veer toward

their target, negating any miss chances that otherwise

would apply. Due to razorfeathers, a steelwings wing

attacks and razorfeather attacks threaten a critical hit on

a 1720.

Hail of Razorfeathers (Ex) As a standard action, a steel wing

can cast a 60-foot cone of its razorfeathers. Creatures

caught in the area must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save

or take 15d6 points of slashing damage. A steelwing can

use its hail of razorfeathers attack every 1d4 rounds.

The damage dealt by a steelwings hail of

razorfeathers is 1d6 points per Hit Die. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Steelwings are enormous avian creatures native to the Infer-

nal Battle eld of Acheron. As be ts natives of that plane, they

are  erce and deadly combatants, and their appearance on

the Material Plane is an ill omen.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A steelwing  ghts from the air whenever possible, attack-

ing creatures at range with its hail of razorfeathers. It uses

Flyby Attack to rain destruction down on an enemy party

before soaring out of range. If attacked by other flying

creatures, a steelwing uses ranged razorfeather attacks or

its devastating bite.

If facing powerful spellcasters or foes employing danger-

ous ranged attacks, a steelwing does not hesitate to close

to melee range, even dropping to the ground. There, it

makes full attacks and allows its razorfeather shield to

shred its foes.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Though  steelwings  have  only  minimal  intelligence,  their

connection to Acheron makes them cunning combatants.

Steelwings dont appear in numbers greater than four indi-

viduals unless they are domesticated.

Unwelcome Nest (EL 16): A planar rift has pulled a mated

pair of steelwings and their egg from Acheron to the Material

Plane. The creatures have nested above a trade road through

a mountain pass. The disruption to merchant traf c from

the creatures hunting threatens to throw the economies of

two kingdoms into chaos unless the PCs can overcome the

steelwings or  nd a way to return the gigantic birds to their

home plane.

Egg Hunt (EL 17): A  ight of three steelwings has come

to the Material Plane in search of an unscrupulous horizon

walker who made off with a precious steelwing egg. Enraged

by  the  theft,  the  steelwings  accost  the  party  when  they

mistake one of the PCs for the horizon walker. Characters

can attempt to prove they had nothing to do with the theft

by reasoning with the steelewings. If the PCs offer to aid the

steelwings in their search, the characters might gain a brace

of powerful avian allies.

ECOLOGY

Steelwings are born on Acheron, where the metallic cubes

of Ocanthus and Tintibulus meet amid the whirling winds

This powerful avian is a steelwing, a creature

native to the Infernal Battle eld of Acheron.

29  A steelwing can shoot its bladed feathers as

individual ranged attacks, or it can cast a cone of

razorfeathers to deal devastating damage. Though

it prefers to attack from the air, a steelwing  ghts

with beak, wings, and talons if pressed.

of the plane. They are sometimes called Acheron phoenixes

in honor of their home and their regal shape. Steelwings

roam the Infernal Battle eld freely, preying upon petition-

ers and visitors alike.

On Acheron, steelwings are predators and prey, as well

as tamed beasts of war. Hextor has gathered a great number

of steelwings in an aerie in Scourgehold, training them

to aid his aerial combat forces. Champions of Grummsh,

who hunt the steelwings for dangerous sport,

also seek after these creatures steely

razorfeathers.

Steelwings mate for life, and if a

steelwings mate is slain, the bird

of prey seeks out the murder-

ers and exacts grim vengeance.

Mated  pairs  construct  nests

of  twisted  iron  and  steel  on

Tintibulus.  They  guard  their

eggs jealously, rarely vacating

the nest for fear of eggs

being cast out by the col-

lisions between cubes

common on the plane.

Dead steelwing eggs

are  sometimes  seen

 oating in the airy

void  of  Acheron,

forever lost.

Environment:

Steelwings are most

commonly  encoun-

tered  on  one  of  the

four layers of the Infer-

nal Battlefield of Acheron.

When they find their way to

the Material Plane, they are fre-

quently in the service of a powerful

spellcaster,  on  a  mission  from  a  master  in

Hextors armies, or in pursuit of creatures

that have attempted to steal their eggs.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Despite its flat gray

hue, a steelwing is an impressive sight. With its crested

head and neck, and its long, steely tail feathers, a steelwing

cuts a fierce silhouette in the sky. The edges of its feathers

thin out to a razor-sharp edge, and they are as strong as

adamantine. A steelwings plumage molts continuously and

can regenerate in moments. Steelwing feathers that have

not yet molted are coveted for their value in the fashioning

of ammunition.

Adult steelwings are approximately 20 feet in length

with a 30-foot wingspan. They weigh two and one-half

tons. Their eggs are metal spheroids each the size of a small

cart. As their hatching time draws close, steelwing eggs begin

to tarnish and exude silver-gray dust.

Alignment: Steelwings are  ercely dedicated to their

mates and young, but they eschew the con icts of others.

They are almost always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Steelwings have no interest in treasure, but their razorfeath-

ers have great value. Razorfeathers are ruined when used in

a steelwings attacks or razorfeather shield, but characters

who defeat a steelwing in combat on the Material Plane

can remove 350 razorfeathers (worth 50 gp each; see

For Player Characters).

If a steelwing pair is killed on Acheron, an

egg makes up the bulk of their treasure, along

with 300 razorfeathers that can be reclaimed

from  the  roiling  winds  and  tumbling

matter of that plane.

Thrym hounds are cunning predators that dwell in lands

of ice and snow, originally a gift from the deity Thrym to

his frost giant worshipers. Some Thrym hounds serve the

frost giants as fearsome steeds, and others run in feral packs

through the polar wastes.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Whether they are the hunters or the hunted, Thrym hounds

make intelligent use of their special abilities in combat.

When facing large numbers, they use ice storm (a swift action

thanks to their Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat) to disorient

and confuse their foes. They then close to take advantage

of their reach. Once engaged in melee, they use their frigid

stare as often as possible, attacking with bite and claws the

rest of the time.

When  ghting small numbers of foes, a Thrym hound uses

its frigid stare to take probable spellcasters out of combat

170

quickly, hoping to keep an enemys magic off the battle eld.

It reserves its ice storm ability for spellcasters, ranged combat-

ants, and other characters who hang back from the fray.

Against weaker opponents, Thrym hounds engage as many

foes  as  possible  in  melee,  relying  on  their  counterstrike

ability to quickly even the odds. They freely use tactics that

provoke attacks of opportunity, trusting that characters who

have seen the Thrym hounds counterstrike will think twice

before making those attacks.

Though Thrym hounds are resistant to cold, they are not

immune to it. As such, these creatures are careful not to catch

each other in the line of their frigid stare. In larger packs,

speci c members whose injuries limit their usefulness in

melee use ice storm and frigid stare, while the others take the

 ght to the foe.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Wild  Thrym  hounds  live  alone  or  in  feral  packs.  Frost

giants domesticate these creatures for use as steeds and

guardians.  Whether  encountered  singly,  in  a  pack,  or

alongside  the  giants  they  serve,  Thrym  hounds  make

formidable opponents.

Lone Hound (EL 10): A single Thrym hound lairs in an

elaborately carved ice cave, causing trouble for the nomadic

tribes of the nearby tundra.

Raiding Party (EL 15): A pack of three frost giants (MM

122) and four Thrym hounds has traveled to warmer climes

in search of easy hunting. Whether the creatures are attack-

ing local herds or the hunters who follow them, one Thrym

hound hangs back to use ice storm and frigid stare before

joining the others in melee.

ECOLOGY

Thrym hounds are at the top of the food chain in their frigid

homelands. White dragons are the only creatures a Thrym

hound fears, but packs of hounds can stand up to younger

dragons if threatened.

This creature is a Thrym hound, a magical beast

native to arctic lands.

Thrym hounds are said to be Thryms gift to

his favored giant tribes. They have a number of

powerful cold-related abilities, which they use in

combat to devastating effect.

30  A Thrym hounds rocky skin is likely to be

impervious to all but the most powerful attacks,

and its icy spines can lash out against foes.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

If a Thrym hound eats voraciously for a week or two, it can

go hungry for nearly a year without suffering any ill effect.

Thrym hounds can eat smaller meals throughout the year if

they so choose, but most of them prefer to binge and then

fast, since prey can be scarce in the frigid lands where the

hounds dwell.

Environment: Thrym hounds live in arctic and subarctic

lands, preferring glacial regions of snow and ice. They are

commonly found in cold mountains and cold hills, though

they prefer temperate regions for hunting and sport. When

hunting, they can be found in a broad range of climes,

though they rarely linger long before returning to their

arctic homes.

Thrym  hounds  prefer  to  live  in  ice  caves,  which  they

excavate with teeth and claws. They can make remarkably

fast headway through ice in this manner, though not nearly

fast enough to qualify as a mode of movement. Given time,

they are capable of constructing extensive networks of icy

tunnels and caverns.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Thrym  hounds

have the shape and build of wolves, but they are 30 feet

long, including the tail, and can stand 12 feet tall at the

shoulder.  An  adult  Thrym  hound  weighs  fifteen  tons.

Instead of fur, these creatures have rocklike skin that proj-

ects away from the body in fine spines. These spines are

constantly frosted with ice, regardless of the surrounding

temperature, and are cold to the touch. They reflexively

flare out to strike at anyone attacking the Thrym hound

in melee.

Alignment: Thrym hounds are sel sh creatures, as quick

to hunt humanoids and their livestock as they are the beasts

of the wild. Nearly all these creatures are neutral evil, with

more rapacious examples demonstrating chaotic evil traits.

SOCIETY

Packs of two to a dozen Thrym hounds form to hunt and raid.

Raids into warmer lands are a strange feature of Thrym

hound pack culture. Lone Thrym hounds occasion-

ally go raiding, though this is normally an

activity for a large pack. But even a small

pack of Thrym hounds can wreak havoc

in a civilized area.

Thrym hounds hunt for plea-

sure  as  much  as  they  do  for

sustenance. They are intelligent

enough to engage in cruelty for its own

sake, putting their victims through

torturous cat-and-mouse games before

consuming them.

These  creatures  have  a

couple  of  habits  that

extend  beyond  instinct

or intelligence. They have

an intuitive sense of and

respect for territorial boundaries,

so conflicts between individuals or packs are rare. Thrym

hounds  also  have  a  natural  subservience  toward  frost

giants. Thus, frost giants receive a +4 bonus on Handle

Animal  checks  and  Ride  checks  when  dealing  with

Thrym hounds.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Thrym hounds have little appreciation for treasure, but they

sometimes keep gems, weapons, and magic items from former

victims in their lairs. They have half standard treasure for

their Challenge Rating.

THRYM HOUNDS IN EBERRON

Thrym  hounds  originated  in  the  Frostfell,  but  they  have

since spread to the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds,

the  Demon  Wastes  north  of  Eldeen  Bay,  and  the  Tashana

Tundra in northern Sarlona. Their depredations are known

and feared in Karrnath, but elsewhere they are little more

than myth. Thrym hounds are named for a legendary Frost-

fell island where a kingdom of giants was said to have been

established before the fall of Xendrik.

THRYM HOUNDS IN FAERN

Thrym  hounds  live  in  the  far  north,  particularly  on  the

Great Glacier and the High Ice. Packs of these creatures are

sometimes seen in the Frozenfar and the Spine of the World

as well, and they have been known to raid as far south as

Daggerford. In recent years, Thrym hounds have appeared

in southern climes for reasons beyond the need to hunt or

the desire to raid. Some believe that these Thrym hounds are

under the control of Iyraclea, mistress of the Great Glacier,

but their purpose is unknown.

TIRBANA

At the fringes of civilization, ghost towns echo with the

chittering din of countless tirbanas. Endlessly toiling, end-

lessly breeding, these fearsome creatures spread and thrive

by overwhelming the folk of isolated villages, placing those

victims  into  a  magical

slumber,  then  implant-

ing eggs into them.

To  sustain  their  ex-

istence,  tirbanas  need

living hosts. Because an-

imals  and  other  wildlife

seldom congregate in suf-

 cient  numbers  for  their

needs, these creatures have

evolved  to  seek  out  the

consistently populous com-

munities of sentient races. In

such places, tirbanas  nd more

than  enough  hosts  to  propagate

new generations.

Tirbanas take one of four known

forms. The least of their kind are the

eyewings, odd creatures that resemble

overly large dragonflies. Above them

are  the  drowsers,  worker-drones

charged with magically subduing the

residents of a settlement. Slayers are

the warriors of the tirbanas, quashing

any  resistance  in  the  colonys  target

population  of  sentient  creatures.  At

the  top  are  the  spawners  that

implant  tirbana  eggs  into

doomed hosts.

for the most recent effect.

The  gentle  tirbana  eyewings  are

all but harmless. They serve their

colony as scouts and as nursemaids,

keeping host creatures alive until the

eggs within those hosts hatch. The only

tirbanas  ever  found  outside  a  colony,

eyewings sometimes serve as familiars

for wizards and sorcerers. They are valued

for their ability to sense magical auras and negate enchant-

ment effects.

Strategies and Tactics

When  it  is  encountered  alone,  an  eyewing   ees  enemies,

returning to the colony to alert its kin. It then leads several

drowsers back to the site of danger. It uses its poisoned bite

in combat, hoping to make victims more susceptible to the

drowsers sleep ability.

When not threatened, an eyewing is a carefree, good-

natured creature. These tirbanas happily follow any creatures

they come across, demonstrating complete docility in return

for morsels of food or a playful scratch between the wings.

If given the opportunity, they follow creatures for up to two

days in the hope of being led to a settlement. Once there, they

immediately  ee back to the colony to report the location.

For Player Characters

An eyewing can be used as an improved familiar (DMG 200).

A spellcaster must be lawful neutral or lawful evil, have an

arcane spellcaster level of 5th, and take the Improved Familiar

feat to acquire an eyewing familiar.

eyes. Slung beneath them is a pair of dripping mandibles that exude

a yeasty stench.

A  tirbana  colony  relies  on  drowsers  to  slip  stealthily  into

settlements and subdue the population with their sleep ability.

The colony also contains a small number of modi ed drowser

drones whose job is to impregnate the spawner. Once that

task is complete, they  ll the same place in the colony as

regular drowsers.

Strategies and Tactics

Drowsers are naturally cooperative, and they work especially

well together. They are a colonys  rst line of defense, meeting

any threat head on with their sleep ability. A few drowsers

typically hold back to use blur on themselves, but these join

the battle quickly, surrounding opponents to help their fel-

lows bring those foes down.

Eyewings and slayers occasionally accompany drows-

ers on combat missions. The smaller eyewings zoom in

to nip at their foes, hoping to make their enemies more

susceptible  to  the  drowsers  sleep  ability.  If  slayers  are

present,  a  handful  of  drowsers  bestow  a  blur  effect  on

those  warriors  instead  of  themselves.  Once  they  have

protected the slayers, drowsers fling themselves into the

fray,  maneuvering  to  flank  opponents  and  thereby  aid

their larger allies.

TIRBANA SLAYER

The creature lurching toward you looks like some great beetle, hoary

beneath bulbous red eyes.

Slayers are the warriors of a tirbana colony. Their principal

responsibility  is  to  destroy  those  creatures  that  resist  the

drowsers sleep ability.

Strategies and Tactics

Slayers are not as numerous as eyewings and drowsers, so

they fight singly or in pairs. A slayer is typically accom-

panied by a number of drowsers, with one of the smaller

tirbanas giving the warrior the benefit of blur while the

others  fan  out  to  surround  the  enemy.  The  slayer  then

races into combat, tearing through foes with its bite attack

boosted by its skirmish ability. If prevented from moving,

it attacks with bite and claws before taking a 5-foot step,

hoping to gain enough space to use its skirmish ability

during the next round.

Slayers are unsubtle combatants, typically maximizing

their Power Attack feat in the hope of landing dreadful

blows on their enemies. If its bite attack successfully stuns

an opponent, a slayer directs its drowser allies to flank

and finish that foe off, moving to skirmish with another

adversary. If the slayer loses its skirmish ability to heal

itself with its second wind ability, it focuses on one foe

at a time, flanking if possible as it makes successive bite

and claw attacks.

TIRBANA SPAWNER

A yeasty odor precedes this strange bipedal creature, which looks like

a cross between a human and a giant cockroach. Its upper limbs

end in handlike appendages. A pair of large violet eyes dominates

its triangular head, overshadowing mandibles that slaver with a

sickening eagerness.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

HANDS OF THE TIRBANAS

Tirbana  spawners  and  drowsers  have  hands,  and  these

creatures are clever enough to utilize tools and other handy

objects. A tirbana spawner is as bright as a human, so it can

exploit  items  in  its  possession  on  a  strategic  and  tactical

level. It can even figure out how to operate complex devices.

A tirbana drowser is only slightly smarter than a chimpanzee,

so on its own, it might use simple tools for accomplishing

mundane tasks. It could, for example, employ a bucket for

food gathering.

Since they have the required appendages, tirbana spawners

and drowsers can handle weapons. A drowser can wield one-

handed or light weapons designed for Small creatures, but it

only gains proficiency with such armaments if trained. Its usu-

ally better off using its natural attacks in battle, making use of

its dexterous hand for other tasks. Spawners are more likely to

learn to use a weapon. Only an advanced spawner could take

the feat required to gain proficiency with a weapon, and such

a creature never bothers learning to wield a weapon that deals

less damage than its mandibles.

Tirbana  spawners  sometimes  educate  drowsers  on  how

to work with objects and machines in ways the dull-witted

drowsers would never think of on their own. Spawners also

devise  plans  and  instruct  their  tirbana  underlings  on  how

to  implement  those  plans.  For  instance,  a  spawner  might

teach its drowsers how to open and close a complex system

of gates, along with how to use those gates to protect the

tirbana colony. The same spawner could show the drowsers

how to throw splash weapons, which require no proficiency

to use.

If you design a tirbana-based adventure, consider the loca-

tion and the objects available there. Many implements pres-

ent in, say, a small keep, could be dangerous in the hands of

the  tirbanas.  If  you  allow  the  tirbanas  to  take  advantage  of

these items, your encounters will be that much more surpris-

ing and fun.

driving the colony to conquer populated settlements and

spread their kind across the world.

Strategies and Tactics

A spawner is the brains of a colony, and without its presence

and guiding in uence, all the tirbanas of the colony lose

their way. As a result, two to three slayers typically protect

a single spawner. Since a spawner rarely ventures out of its

lair, combat with one of these creatures is on its terms. Given

time to prepare, a spawner uses its displacement ability and

takes cover, trusting its sleep drones and its fanatically loyal

slayers to defend it. If directly threatened, it emerges from

cover to bite or  ing acid orbs at its foes.

A spawners instincts direct it to whatever action best

serves the health of the colony. However, a spawners aware-

ness and intellect sometimes makes the tirbanas antipathy

for elves (see Society) manifest as a dark rage. If face to face

with elves in its lair, a spawner attacks incessantly with its

acid orbs, not caring if it runs the risk of hitting its slayer

or drowser allies.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Tirbanas live only to subdue settlements and implant eggs

in  their  captives.  Once  established,  these  creatures  rarely

venture outside a community except to seek water and food.

Tirbanas are not wantonly violent by nature, and when they

do attack, it is with the intent of tak-

ing their victims alive.

If  encountered

in  an  overrun

settlement,  tirba-

nas become far

more  aggres-

sive. They do

not  tolerate

intruders,

quick to drive

out any who do not belong. If alerted to attack, strike teams

of slayers and drowsers prowl the streets while eye wings

speed through the air. All fight independently, sharing

the common goal of defending the spawner in the safety

of its lair.

Scouts (EL 1/24): Before making an attack against a

settlement, the spawner sends out teams of eyewings to

locate populations of prospective hosts. Each eyewing travels

independently and  ghts only if it cannot  ee. However, an

eyewing that is attacked returns in 1d10 minutes with two

drowsers ready to  ght.

Strike Teams (EL 46): Once a site is located, the spawner

sends in teams of two eyewings and two to four drowsers to

pacify the populace. These creatures avoid well-armed or

well-armored foes, and they ignore enemies that succeed

on two successive saves against their sleep ability. They know

that the suppressor force set to follow them can deal with any

creatures they cannot.

Suppressors (EL 67): Invariably, a settlement contains

folk who resist the tirbanas sleep abilities. A slayer and two

to four drowsers are sent in to crush any such residents. The

suppressor force uses divide-and-conquer tactics, preventing

targets from aiding each other in combat. Directed by the

slayer, the drowsers target the most powerful foes  rst, hoping

to slay leaders to break the morale of those still alive.

Maintenance Team (EL 78): As soon as tirbanas take

control, maintenance teams of six to eight drowsers make

the rounds of host creatures to ensure those hosts remain

asleep. If their work is interrupted, half the drowsers focus

on ensuring that any host creatures that awaken are sent back

to sleep, while the other half defend

against intruders.

ECOLOGY

Tirbanas  take  nourishment  from  anything  that  can  be

consumed, and they can survive on dead wood and other

creatures leavings if need be. They have no natural enemies,

for only the most voracious of predators can tolerate the

taste of their flesh. As a result, tirbanas are free to do as

they like.

Though  tirbanas  can  sustain  themselves  in  nearly  any

environment, they cannot reproduce without laying their

eggs in other creatures. The warm body of a living creature

incubates the eggs and provides food for tirbana larvae when

they hatch. A spawner produces up to one hundred eggs in a

single clutch, each needing at least 15 pounds of fresh meat

to sustain it. Only populated settlements can typically meet

the needs of a tirbana colonys breeding program.

Tirbanas need to keep their host creatures alive, and so

they have evolved a number of unusual abilities dedicated

to inducing a deep sleep in their victims. Once the hosts

succumb to sleep, the spawner inserts four eggs into each

victims throat. An acidic gel coats the eggs and enables them

to attach within the hosts stomach. After a week, the egg

hatches to release a pale white larva (1 hit point) that grows

into one of the four types of tirbanas.

Each sleeping creature is an ideal meal, providing the larvae

with suf cient energy to complete their transformation. A

victim takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage each day the

larvae feed. When its Constitution is reduced to 0, the host

dies. The larvae then emerge and feed on the corpse.

As long as its Constitution has not reached 0, a host creature

can be saved by the application of a cure disease or heal spell.

This kills the parasitic larvae and allows any Constitution

damage to be healed normally.

Once  a  new  generation  of  tirbanas  has  hatched,  the

bodies of their hosts fuel the growth of the young over a

period of two weeks. During this time, the elder colony

begins to die. Eyewings, drowsers, and slayers grow weak

and collapse one by one. By the time the spawner perishes,

the  larvae  have  completed  their  transformations,  and  a

new generation of tirbanas is born. Among the young are

1d3+1 spawners that divide the rest of the colony between

them. Each group then sets out to find a population of new

hosts to continue the cycle.

Environment: Tirbanas are hardy and adaptable, settling

anywhere that isolated communities spring up. As such,

these creatures can be found in any land or underground

environment. Their lairs are ghastly places,  lled with the

bodies of host creatures slowly starving in their sleep, or

corpses  being  devoured  by  the  larvae  that  have  hatched

inside them.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Tirbanas  resemble

giant insects, blending the features and body parts of man-

tises, beetles, roaches,  ies, and other vermin.

An eyewing looks like an oversized dragon y, 1 foot long

and weighing 2 pounds, with two large green orbs for eyes.

It  ies by means of 2-foot-wide translucent wings that allow

it to reach great speeds. An eyewing is at home in the air,

moving with an uncanny grace.

Drowsers have wings as eyewings do, but they lack the

maneuverability and speed of their smaller kin. Resem-

bling giant cockroaches, these creatures move about on

six legs and have a seventh limb equipped with a grasping

hand. They have flat, shiny bodies and the triangular head

common to all tirbanas. All drowsers are about 3 feet long

and weigh 30 pounds.

The brutish slayers are larger than drowsersabout 5 feet

long and weighing 200 pounds. Scarcely contained by their

waxen shells, their bodies are filthy, covered with muck

and debris that forms an effective second carapace. Their

triangular heads have large red eyes.

Spawners are the strangest tirbanas of all. Unlike others

of their kind, they stand upright, walking on their hind

legs. Though their second set of limbs is withered and

useless, the upper set is strong and equipped with fully

functioning hands. They stand just under 6 feet tall and

weigh 150 pounds.

Alignment: Tirbanas are not evil, but the act of subduing

and slaying host creatures is an intrinsic part of their nature.

Though these creatures do their best to care for victims while

their larvae grow, they dont recognize the immorality of

trading the lives of unwilling sentient hosts for their own

survival. Tirbanas have an unshakeable commitment to

their colony and its survival, and these creatures are usually

lawful neutral. A few tirbanas display evil tendencies, which

manifest as unnecessary cruelty.

This creature is a tirbana, a member of a menacing

insectile race that invades humanoid settlements.

This result reveals all magical beast traits.

16  All tirbanas have highly developed eyes, making

them dangerously perceptive and impossible to

 ank. Though capable in combat, tirbanas can

send their foes to sleep using poison and magical

abilities.

21  Of the four types of tirbanas, the large slayers are

the most deadly. However, all these creatures  ght

in concert, using their poison to make foes more

susceptible to their sleep effects.

Tirbanas put creatures into a deep sleep not

for defense, but for reproduction. The bipedal

spawner is the leader of a tirbana colony, and

the eggs it lays within a magically sleeping host

eventually hatch, resulting in the hosts death.

SOCIETY

Tirbanas  are  disciplined  and  keenly  aware  of  their  roles

within the hierarchy of the colony. Lesser tirbanas follow

the commands of a spawner without question, giving their

lives if need be to ensure the colonys well-being.

Eyewing tirbanas work primarily as scouts. Skilled  yers,

they can cover vast territory as they seek out isolated com-

munities for the colony. Once tirbanas have taken over a

settlement, eyewings work tirelessly to tend to the health

of host creatures. They scour the environs for fresh water,

collecting  it  in  specially  designed  pockets  in  their  legs.

They then flutter back to the colonys sleeping victims

to  dribble  water  into  their  mouths.  Eyewings  also  give

nourishment to smaller or weaker host creatures (typically

children) whose Constitution might not be suf cient to

allow a brood of eggs to successfully hatch. From the food it

eats, an eyewing disgorges a pasty mass that heals 2 points

of  Constitution  damage  when  forced  down  a  helpless

victims throat. However, most hosts are allowed to starve

where they lie.

Drowsers come next in the tirbana hierarchy. It falls to

these creatures to place the residents of a target settlement

into the deep sleep that sees them turned into tirbana hosts.

Drowsers spread out in small teams when a settlement is

invaded, blanketing victims with their sleep ability. Once

a  settlement  is  overrun,  drowsers  work  in  coordinated

teams, constantly renewing their sleep effect to keep host

creatures helpless.

Especially in larger settlements that cannot be taken in

one fell swoop, slayers are sent in to deal with any pockets of

physical resistance. These warriors tear apart any creatures

that attempt to stand in the way of the colonys survival.

When the battle is done, the corpses of their victims feed

the colony as the sleeping host creatures are prepared for

implantation.

Heading up the tirbana colony is a single spawner. More

intelligent than their lesser kin, spawners understand the

fate that awaits the colony once the eggs hatch, and they

are the only tirbanas who can truly appreciate the horror

that the colonys host creatures undergo. To a spawner, how-

ever, the continued spread of the tirbana race outweighs

any other concern.

Though a tirbana colony is strongly lawful, the destruc-

tion of the spawner does not leave lesser tirbanas helpless.

As long as the spawner has laid any eggs, tirbanas fight

for the overall defense of the colony, knowing that the

continued survival of their kind depends on their ability

to  defend  the  host  creatures  that  are  growing  the  next

generation of tirbanas.

Although tirbanas are indifferent to their victims, they

reserve a special hatred for elves, whom they fear because

of that races innate immunity to sleep effects. They instinc-

tively give elf settlements a wide berth, but elves who share

territory with humans, hal ings, and other good humanoid

races sometimes send out hunting parties to destroy tirbana

colonies before they spread.

SAMPLE LAIR: TIRBANA THORP

Before the tirbanas came, Martuk was a peaceful community

of  fty souls in a wide rural realm. Elders passed down the

secrets of coaxing plants from the soil for generations. Using

these methods, the folk of Martuk have sustained themselves

and grown enough surplus to trade with an enclave of wood

elves ten miles to the east. The farmers and hunters of this

land regard the natural world as an expression of the divine.

They respect nature, killing only out of necessity and ensur-

ing that no part of a creature goes to waste.

The gentle and trusting nature of the residents of Martuk

proved  to  be  their  downfall,  however.  When  a  hunter

encountered  a  tirbana  eyewing  in  the  nearby  woods,  its

beauty amazed him. After leading it back to Martuk with

offers of food, he showed his fellow townsfolk the graceful

creature he had found. Shortly after its arrival, however, the

eyewing sped off. Locals saw the creatures appearance as a

sign of providence, and so they kept an eye out in case it or

others of its kind returned.

Three days after the initial encounter, return they did.

A host of tirbanas poured out of the woods and set upon

the town. Eyewings filled the air, while drowsers worked

their fell magic to incapacitate the residents. Though a few

fought back, they were slain almost to the last (see area 5). It

was over quickly. Tirbanas had claimed the community for

themselves, and their spawner set about implanting its eggs

in the slumbering bodies of the fallen.

Now, the tirbana colony has just about run its course.

Half of the new generation of eggs have hatched and as

many  of  the  original  attackers  have  collapsed,  rotting

where  they  fell.  The  sight  that  greets  any  approaching

party is a macabre one. Dismembered and devoured human

corpses litter the ground, and a few sluggish tirbanas crawl

through the area, awaiting the end. A pervasive stench hangs

in the air.

When using this site, seed treasure among the encounters

as you see  t; see Typical Treasure.

Tirbana  Husks:  Each  location  marked  with  tirbana

remains indicates a place where a member of the colony

succumbed to the death that awaits them all. These repellent

remains stink far worse than do the human corpses. Tirbana

carcasses weep a pale yellow  uid from their joints. Each dead

tirbana swarms with  ies.

Trees: The trees around the thorp are medium forest (DMG

87). To a casual observer, this appears to be an ordinary wood.

However, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Knowledge

(nature) check knows that this forest is carefully maintained.

Any search of the area reveals a number of stone amulets

hanging from woven cords in the trees lower branches. A

DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check suggests that residents

placed these ornaments here to ward away evil spirits.

1. River (EL 12): The river moves at a brisk pace, and

any bodies that fell here have long since washed down-

stream. The water is potable, but every 10 minutes, 1d4+1

eyewings arrive to gather water for the colonys sleeping

host creatures.

2. Huts (EL 57): Eleven huts  ll the center of the clearing,

situated around a bigger structure (area 3). Though largely

constructed of mud, wood, and leaves, the huts are sturdy.

Their roofs are made of tightly woven reeds, and these struc-

tures have a hole in the center through which smoke from a

central  re pit can escape.

Every hut holds 1d4+1 emaciated residents of varying

ages and genders. Half their number are in a deep magical

slumber, their mouths slack. The other residents are dead and

currently being eaten by the huts other inhabitants1d3

tirbana drowsers and a single tirbana slayer.

3. Chieftains Hut (EL 8): This large hut once housed the

thorps chieftain. His remains are spread a few feet away, face

down and rotting in the mud. Unlike the smaller structures,

this hut is separated by interior walls into four rooms. The

tirbana spawner claimed this place as its lair, posting two

slayers out front as sentries.

4. Dire Boar Corpse (EL 4): Two drowsers dismember

this corpse to bring back as food for the spawner. They have

carefully peeled off parts of its bristly skin and carved away

hunks of meat that they stacked nearby.

5. Survivors: Against all odds, two residents who were

immune to the tirbanas sleep attacks managed to  ee into

the  woods  when  the  onslaught  came.  For  the  last  week,

Oolasien (CG female elf ranger 4) and her daughter Spyra

(CG half-elf ranger 1) have hidden here, surviving on nuts

and berries. Oolasien watched her human husband slain

in  the  defense  of  the  thorp,  and  the  destruction  of  her

community has taxed her sanity, leaving her periodically

catatonic. With eyewings in constant  ight around the area,

Spyra is afraid to try to move her mother to a safer location.

She has noticed the tirbanas have recently begun to die,

however, and is preparing to return to the community to

 nd out why.

6. Fields (EL 3): The stench of death has attracted an

ankheg, which now lurks beneath the thorps  elds. At night,

the monster burrows out of its subterranean nest to snatch a

juicy corpse or two.

A DC 15 Spot check allows characters to notice that the

ground here has been disturbed as if recently dug. A DC 10

Search check reveals the same information, and someone

who has the Track feet can make a DC 15 Survival check to

identify the creature that has been living and digging here.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Tirbanas have no use for wealth, and anything they cannot

consume  or  use  is  left  where  it  falls.  Because  tirbanas

attack  small  and  out-of-the-way  communities,  treasure

from a tirbana encounter usually takes the form of silver

and copper coins, gems, trade goods, and occasional magic

items  and  art  objects.  These  creatures  do  not  carry  or

hoard treasure, but valuables are found in the areas where

tirbanas live.

Eyewings  have  no  treasure,  whether  they  are  encoun-

tered in the open as scouts or ministering to sleeping host

creatures. Drowsers have half standard treasure for their

Challenge Rating. Slayers have half standard treasure for

their  Challenge  Rating.  Spawners  lair  in  the  largest  and

most secure building in a settlement, such as a chieftains

hut, a great hall, or where the common wealth of the villag-

ers is stored. They have double standard treasure for their

Challenge Rating.

Trade goods found as tirbana treasure are consistent with

the size of a village and the area in which it is found. Common

trade goods might include livestock and horses that escaped

the initial tirbana attack plus salt, furs, linen,  our, and spices.

See Wealth Other than Coins, PH 112.

TIRBANAS IN EBERRON

Tirbanas are confined to Xendrik, where they primarily

colonize  tribal  settlements  of  lizardfolk.  Though  more

numerous,  the  drow  are  immune  to  the  tirbanas  sleep

abilities.  Moreover,  the  tirbana  spawners  have  come  to

see the xenophobic drow as an impediment to widespread

settlement in Xendrik. Tirbanas in Xendrik sometimes

breed attack swarms of slayers whose only goal is to destroy

drow outposts. As a result, the drow have begun to actively

hunt tirbanas.

TIRBANAS IN FAERN

A group of Halruaan explorers recently returned from a foray

into the Mhair Jungles beyond the West Wall, telling strange

tales of ghost villages overgrown by vines and brush. Though

these places showed signs of battle, all were full of skeletons

laid out in repose, as if the villagers had simply died in their

sleep. The explorers suspect plague, but the wild dwarves of

the area claim this to be the work of the tirbanasstrange

insect beasts that come to snatch away a sleepers soul. So

unsettling are these sites that the wild dwarves refuse to go

near them.

embedded in its rubbery green skin. A cap of steel is riveted to its

head, and steel claws are af xed to its hands. Blood oozes from

around the plating and down the claws. The creatures wild eyes

betray unthinkable agony.

Regeneration (Ex) Fire and acid deal normal damage to a

bladerager troll. If a bladerager troll loses a limb or body

part, the lost portion regrows in 5 minutes. The creature

can reattach a severed member instantly by holding it to

the stump.

Death Throes (Ex) A bladerager troll is designed to be a

bomb by its sinister masters. When a bladerager troll

dies, it explodes, propelling shrapnel in a 30-foot-

radius burst. Those caught in the area take 5d6 points

of piercing damage (Reflex DC 22 half). The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Tortured Mind (Ex) A bladerager trolls mind has been torn

to shreds by the constant pain of its implanted armor.

Anyone who makes direct contact with a bladerager trolls

tortured mind (such as by using a detect thoughts spell)

takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

Pounce (Ex) If a bladerager troll charges a foe, it can make a

full attack.

Rend (Ex) A bladerager troll that hits with both claw attacks

latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh.

This attack deals an extra 4d6+13 points of damage.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Bladerager trolls immediately charge any foe they see, pounce

upon that opponent, and rend it to pieces. Their masters

usually unleash these vicious creatures as shock troops and

suicide squads.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Bladerager trolls are created, not born, so they are usually

found with their masters. Since they are military creatures,

they can be found in squads of two to ten when in such

service. When they are not under a masters control, blade-

rager trolls are unable to abide the company of others without

lashing out to relieve their agony, so they are encountered

as solitary creatures.

Renegade (EL 8): After escaping its  re giant handlers, a

bladerager troll runs amok, preying on livestock and farmers

on the edge of a frontier village. The savagery of its attacks

is extreme even for a troll. Though the attacks left no survi-

vors, those who come to deal with the menace can quickly

determine that theyre dealing with something like a troll

but worse. Tracks at the locations of recent attacks suggest

the giant is heavier but not much larger than normal, and

the wounds on victims are more like those created by light

weapons than claws. Stranger still, the troll didnt carry any

valuables away from the sites of its attacks, despite the pres-

ence of such riches.

Assault Squad (EL 13): A  re giant (MM 121) with four

freshly trained bladerager trolls has come down from the

mountains to test the mettle of her new slaves. She starts

with villages nearest the mountains and then moves farther

into civilized territory. Her aim is not conquest. Instead, she

wants to prove the ef cacy of the trolls to her superiors. She

keeps notes on the squads performance, so the defeat of the

assault squad and the capture of this information could lead

to further dealings with the  re giants and their new military

technologythe bladerager trolls.

ECOLOGY

Bladerager candidates are selected from among the hardiest

troll specimens. These ill-fated giants are flayed alive as

steel is riveted onto their bones and magically augmented to

work with troll physiology. Claws are then mounted on their

forearms, and enormous steel jaws resembling bear traps are

screwed to their skulls.

This is some sort of troll, but it seems to have had

armor and weapons grafted to it.

This is a bladerager troll, a giant altered by others.

Bladerager trolls are implanted with steel plates

and claws. This augmentation in icts constant

agony on the trolls and makes them more

dangerous than typical specimens. They can attack

with all their grafted weapons after a mad charge.

The pain endured by bladerager trolls addles

their minds. Mind-affecting spells and abilities

cannot manipulate them, and those who contact

a bladeragers mind suffer a portion of the trolls

madness.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Environment: Bladerager trolls are most commonly

found near where normal trolls live and breed, usually

in  the  vicinity  of  mountain  ranges  in  colder  climates.

After  their  augmentation,  bladerager  trolls  go  where

their masters send them. An independent bladerager troll

wanders blindly, so it might be found far from where trolls

normally range.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Bladeragers resemble

mighty trolls that have armor plating covering large areas

of their body, as well as steel claws and teeth. They are rec-

ognizable for what they are, but their grafts are horri c and

bloody. Skin seems to seethe and recede around the armor

due to the trolls regeneration ability, and blood sometimes

escapes from near the edges of the trolls plating. A typical

bladerager troll is slightly taller and broader than a normal

troll, and the large amount of metal inserted into its body

makes it weigh about 650 pounds.

Alignment: Trolls are fearless and remorseless hunters

that know nothing of mercy, and bladeragers add unhealthy

doses of madness and brutality to that foul demeanor. Blad-

erager trolls are always chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Bladerager trolls tortured minds cannot grasp anything

beyond pain, wholesale slaughter, and the need to feed. They

carry and value no treasure. The trolls master might be richer

than normal after collecting the possessions of those slain

by bladerager trolls.

BLADERAGER TROLLS

WITH CLASS LEVELS

Because of their constant agony, bladerager trolls have little

ability to comprehend complex skills. They gain levels as

 ghters or barbarians, both of which are associated classes

for the creatures.

Level Adjustment: +5.

BLADERAGER TROLLS IN EBERRON

Bladeragers were once frontline troops in Xendriks armies,

but the practice of out tting trolls with implanted armor

and weapons vanished with the fall of the giant civilization.

In the southern reaches of the shattered land, a tribe of

cloud giants recently unearthed an armoring chamber and

thereby learned about the bladerager process. The cloud

giants have begun enslaving trolls and transforming them

into bladeragers, hoping these dangerous monstrosities

can  tip  the  balance  in  a  war  with  several  nearby  clans

of drow.

BLADERAGER TROLLS IN FAERN

Bladerager trolls were  rst introduced to Faern in the armies

of Zhentil Keep, but after that redoubts shattering, they were

unleashed upon the world at large. A good number of these

renegade bladeragers wander the Moonsea region, wreak-

ing havoc wherever they appear. One ogre tribe in Thar has

captured a bladerager troll and uses it as an advance strike

unit during battles.

TUSK TERROR

Though this creature resembles an angry wild boar, its eyes glint

with a dark intelligence. The beast bears a long, flexible tail and

wide-set serrated tusks that glisten with spittle. Bulges of muscle

Skills Tusk terrors have a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Jump,

and Tumble checks. They can choose to take 10 on

Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks even if rushed or

threatened.

Tusk terrors are intelligent predators that resemble the wild

boars they were bred from. Deviously cunning and danger-

ously unpredictable, these creatures are  erce combatants.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Tusk terrors  ght by making use of their Spring Attack feat,

dashing in for a devastating bite, then retreating behind

cover or beyond the range of counterattacks. Their high

ranks in Tumble combine with their skill mastery to allow

them to move through threatened areas and even squares

occupied by hostile characters without provoking attacks of

opportunity. Using Balance and Jump, they can move easily

across dif cult terrain.

Tusk terrors prefer to  ght in a large area that offers cover

and features obstacles. They can jump vertically to attack

low-flying creatures, but are wary of attacks from the air.

In normal terrain, a tusk terror can long jump 50 feet or

high jump 12 feet (half those distances without a running

start), tumble past eleven opponents at full speed, or tumble

through six opponents at full speed without having to roll

for its checks.

Tusk terrors  ght well in packs, taking advantage of their

speed and Spring Attack to move into flanking position,

attack, then move off again. A tusk terror that is badly

wounded tries to  ee from combat. These creatures rarely

 ght to the death.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Tusk terrors sometimes gather in small packs. A pack of

these creatures typically contains two to six members. They

cooperate intelligently, but if the fight turns against one

particular creature, it invariably flees. Packs seldom stay

together longer than the length of a hunting season. Mated

pairs are an exception, normally staying together until any

young reach maturity.

Terror Pack (EL 10): Three tusk terrors have been hunting

together in a thick forest for a month, and they employ re ned

tactics. Having witnessed too many settlers despoiling their

hunting grounds, they attack humanoids on sight. A few

hunters have fallen to their attacks, and the locals in the area

fear the woods now.

ECOLOGY

Tusk terrors maintain their position in an area not by chal-

lenging other predators, but by running away from those that

might defeat them. Singly or in packs, tusk terrors establish

a territory and become intimately familiar with it. Whether

hunting or hunted, this familiarity allows them to use cover

and dif cult terrain to their best advantage.

Tusk terrors prefer to hunt single slow-moving creatures,

attacking such beasts repeatedly and granting little chance

for the target to counterattack. A single tusk terror can kill

an animal as large as an elephant with little trouble, but if

smaller, faster prey is the only option, the tusk terrors speed

is up to the chase.

This is not to say that tusk terrors eat only meat. Like the

wild pigs they resemble, tusk terrors are omnivorous, eating

plants and animals as it suits them. These creatures spend

most of their time hunting and foraging, but hunting provides

more sport to satisfy their bright minds.

TUSK TERROR LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can learn

more about tusk terrors. When a character makes a success-

ful  skill  check,  the  following  lore  is  revealed,  including  the

information from lower DCs.

Knowledge (Arcana)

This boarlike creature is a tusk terror, a  erce and

fast-moving magical beast.

Tusk terrors rely on speed and maneuverability to

bring down their prey. They can tumble around

opponents, leap high into the air, and move at

speed through the roughest terrain.

Tusk terrors are intelligent and cunning, and

they attack in such a way as to prevent their prey

from  ghting back. They are not brave creatures,

however, and if seriously injured or threatened,

they typically  ee.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Tusk terrors mate seasonally. A pair seldom maintains

a  relationship  after  their  young  are  reared.  During  the

mating ritual, males vie for females attention, engaging

in bloody matches and acrobatic dances. After she selects

her favorite male and mates with him, a female tusk terror

gives birth to a litter of around six tiny terrors four months

later. She feeds them with milk, and the male tusk terror

supplements this diet with meat and forage. Young mature

in about a year.

Environment: Because of their reliance on move-

ment, tusk terrors avoid living in marsh areas,

and deserts rarely have enough prey to sup-

port them. Though they can survive

the cold, they do not like it.

Terrain  that

provides cover

and  slows

other crea-

tures down

is  a  tusk

terrors

preferred

environment.

As such, they are

found  in  warm  or

temperate  hills  and

mountains, or in temperate forests.

Tusk terrors have a particular af-

 nity  for  a  plant  known  as

weary grass (see the sidebar).

They can sense its presence,

and they live near patches of the

strange herb when they can.

Tusk terrors prefer to lair in places that

allow for defense and have ample escape routes. Packs of

tusk  terrors  typically  lair  in  the  open,  setting  watches

against intruders.

SOCIETY

Tusk terrors resent hierarchies of any kind, and young leave

the care of their parents as soon as they are able. Packs of up to

six tusk terrors are common, but such groups typically stay to-

gether only a few weeks before one tusk terror begins to assert

dominance and breaks the pack apart. As long as a pack survives,

tusk  terrors  are  highly  cooperative,  coordinating  their  at-

tacks in combat

and sleeping

in  shifts  at

night.

Negotiation

with a tusk terror is

possible, since they understand

Common  and  Undercom-

mon. Their own language

consists of grunts, roars,

and gestures.

TYPICAL

TREASURE

Tusk  terrors  have  no

treasure of their own.

TUSK TERRORS

IN EBERRON

Tusk  terrors  are  found  in  the  Eldeen

Reaches and the forests of northern Aundair

and Karrnath. Though these creatures keep to

themselves, they are wary of humanoid expan-

sion in their territories. Unprovoked tusk terror

attacks  against  settlers  and  explorers  are  not

uncommon. Tusk terrors also roam the Black-

cap Mountains in Breland, with adventurers claiming that

packs of these creatures actively guard a mountain pass on

the Aundair frontier. Why they do so is unknown.

Tusk terror

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Tusk  terrors  are

larger than normal boars, about 6 feet long and weigh-

ing 500 pounds. They stand 4 feet high at the shoulder.

Unlike a boar, a tusk terror has a flexible tail as long as its

body, used for balance as it tumbles and jumps. Its fur is

a mottled green and brown under normal circumstances,

but displays bright red and blue patches when the creature

signals aggression.

Alignment: Unorganized and unpredictable, tusk terrors

have  little  concern  for  any  creatures  but  themselves.  As  a

result, nearly all are chaotic neutral.

TUSK TERRORS IN FAERN

Tusk terrors are found in the Vilhon Reach, particularly

the Chondalwood and the Cloven Mountains. They favor

the  worship  of  Lurue,  although  the  less  chaotic  favor

Nobanion. Tusk terrors in Faern tend toward good as a

result, but they also count more than a few worshipers

of  Malar  among  their  number.  The  tusk  terrors  of  the

Chondalwood have an understanding with the wild elves

and ghostwise halflings of that place, and all stay out of

each others territories.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

WEARY GRASS

Weary grass looks like normal range grass but secretes a debili-

tating contact poison. When they can, tusk terrors stake their

territories in areas where it grows, since it is low-lying and they

can easily jump over it. A DC 30 Spot check allows a character

to notice weary grass within an area of normal grass. A DC 20

Knowledge (nature) check allows it to be identified.

Weary  Grass  Poison:  Contact,  Fortitude  DC 17,  fatigued/

USHEMOI

The  ushemoi  are  a  strange  race  whose  members  gain

increased strength, speed, or arcane power when exposed

to different stimuli. The simplest ushemoi grow tougher

and stronger as they take damage in combat. Their bodies

undergo a powerful physical change, granting them superior

prowess even as their skin toughens to the strength of metal

armor. Other ushemoi grow faster in response to injury, their

limbs becoming longer and more  exible. The leaders of the

ushemoi are powerful spellcasters whose magic increases in

potency each time it is used.

ARKAMOI

This  bald,  gray-skinned  humanoid  is  clad  in  blue  robes  that

barely  cover  its  portly  body.  As  the  skin  across  its  head  and

face undulates like rippling water, it clutches an ornate staff

with  soft  fingers  and  begins  to  intone  eldritch  phrases  in  a

rumbling voice.

Arcane Mastermind (Ex) When an arkamois bonus to spell

save DCs from its strength from magic ability is +3 or

higher, its mind begins to work with lightning precision.

Once per round, as an immediate action, the arkamoi

can lend tactical advice to an ally. This effect grants a +2

morale bonus on that allys next check, attack roll, or

damage roll.

Strength from Magic (Ex) Each time an arkamoi casts an

arcane spell, magical feedback grants it a rush of power.

For each arcane spell cast, an arkamoi increases the save

DC of subsequent arcane spells it casts by 1. Additionally,

the arkamoi gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls for

subsequent spells, and gains a +2 deflection bonus to

AC. These benefits last for 1 minute starting in the round

during which the arkamoi finishes casting its first spell of

the encounter.

Bonuses stack each time an arkamoi casts an arcane

spell within that minute, to a maximum of a +5 bonus

to save DCs, a +10 bonus on damage rolls, and a +10

deflection bonus to AC. At the end of that minute, all

these bonuses disappear. They could begin accumulating

again if the arkemoi casts more spells.

Arcane Talent (Ex) An arkamoi casts spells as a 4th-level

sorcerer.

Arkamoi  are  the  thinkers,  leaders,  and  arcane  spell-

casters  of  the  ushemoi.  They  have  an  innate  ability  for

arcane magic, and their keen minds allow them to lead

with ruthless efficiency. Though arkamoi are physically

weaker  than  others  of  their  kind,  the  other  ushemoi

take  a  deferential  attitude  toward  them.  Lashemoi  and

turlemoi are happy to acquiesce to the arkamois natural

leadership,  while  hadrimoi  recognize  the  arkamoi  as

savvy commanders with a knack for turning a situation

to their advantage.

When an arkamoi casts spells, for a time the energy  ow-

ing through its body sharpens its mind and improves each

spell it subsequently casts. As its spellcasting skill soars, an

arkamoi becomes increasingly deadly.

Strategies and Tactics

Arkamoi prefer to build their arcane energies by  rst pick-

ing away at the enemy with their lesser spells, particularly

ray of frost and daze. As their spellcasting ability improves,

they unleash Melfs acid arrow and burning hands. Though

arkamoi are ill suited to melee combat, their damage reduc-

tion and strength from magic bonus to ACaugmented

by mage armor and mirror imagesometimes makes them

overcon dent in their own ability to avoid harm. As such,

they push to the front lines in ways that traditional sorcer-

ers do not.

One of the most useful talents of arkamoi is their ability to

plan a battle around their kins strengths and weaknesses.

A band of ushemoi led by an arkamoi might use hadrimoi

to spring an attack. As the hadrimoi gain speed but lose

their stomach for battle, they lure the enemy toward an

ambush of turlemoi. The arkamoi then uses burning hands

to  harm  as  many  turlemoi  as  possible,  increasing  the

strength of its brutish troops while improving its own

spellcasting ability.

Arkamoi with Class Levels

Sorcerer is the favored class of arkamoi. As an associated class,

levels in sorcerer stack with an arkamois innate spellcasting

ability. Levels in other classes (even spellcasting classes) are

not associated.

Level Adjustment: +4.

Speed from Pain (Ex) Each time a hadrimoi takes damage,

the fibrous tendrils that make up its body become

increasingly elastic and responsive. The hadrimoi gains

a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +1 bonus on attack rolls and

Reflex saves, and a +10-foot bonus to its land speed.

These benefits last for 1 minute starting in the round

during which a hadrimoi first takes damage in the

encounter.

Bonuses stack each time a hadrimoi takes damage,

to a maximum of a +10 dodge bonus to AC, a +5

bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves, and a +50-foot

bonus to land speed. These bonuses accrue each time

a hadrimoi takes damage during that minute, even

from multiple attacks in the same round. At the end of

that minute, all these bonuses disappear. They could

begin accumulating again if the hadremoi takes more

damage.

Falling Courage (Ex) A hadrimoi whose bonus to speed

from its speed from pain ability is +30 feet or higher

takes a 4 penalty on saves against fear effects and on

the level check made to oppose an Intimidate check. In

addition, when in this state, a hadrimoi can be affected

by fear effects that do not normally affect creatures of its

Hit Dice.

Perfect Symmetry (Ex) As a full attack, a hadrimoi can

attack with up to four light weapons with no penalty on

attack rolls. If it tries to use heavier weapons, it can make

multiple attacks only according to its base attack bonus,

and it takes the normal penalties for attacking with two or

more weapons.

Dagger Dance (Ex) As a hadrimoi converts its pain to

superior agility, it can perform a deadly attack. When

a hadrimois bonus to speed from its speed from pain

ability is +30 feet or higher, the creature can move up

to its speed as part of a full attack. It can move before,

after, or between each of its attacks, as long as its total

movement in the round does not exceed its speed.

The  wandering  hadrimoi  are  shiftless  vagabonds  will-

ing to do nearly anything to earn a little coin or a meal.

Though  their  monstrous  appearance  prevents  them

from  moving  openly  in  human  society,  they  thrive  in

the shadowy corners of the criminal underworld, where

their innate speed and agility make them excellent thugs

and assassins.

Hadrimoi gather in small bands, hoping to better defend

against their enemies. When found in these traveling groups,

they typically have a few turlemoi along as enforcers. Unlike

their larger cousins, hadrimoi have a nasty nature in and

out of combat. They take advantage of the turlemois natural

cowardice to cow them into submission.

As a hadrimoi takes damage, it grows taller and thinner.

The grooves in its skin become smooth as its body  lls out

to its full size. In this form, a hadrimoi gains great speed

and agility.

Strategies and Tactics

A hadrimoi attack is a sudden blur of steel that leaves vicious

dagger wounds in its wake. However, though hadrimoi are

aggressive, they are inherent cowards even before their fall-

ing courage takes effect. They prefer to attack from ambush,

but if a battle turns against them, they use their superior

speed to  ee.

Hadrimoi are careful to avoid getting bogged down in a

 ght. Though they place survival above winning, they never

enter a battle unless they are sure that the reward of victory

outweighs the risk of defeat.

This creature is a hadrimoi, one of a race called

the ushemoi. Hadrimoi are subtle combatants,

relying on stealth and speed to overcome their

foes.

20  Hadrimoi are the scouts, spies, and assassins of

the ushemoi. Their arms split into two limbs each,

allowing them to  ght with four weapons.

25  As they take damage, hadrimoi become faster,

more agile, and increasingly deadly in combat. At

its peak, a hadrimoi can move at full speed while

making four dagger attacks during its turn.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

A foiled hadrimoi is a dangerous foe. Though vanquished

orcs and goblins might simply run for their lives and seek

out easier targets in the future, hadrimoi ruminate over

every defeat. Plotting endless schemes of revenge despite

their cowardice, hadrimoi return again and again to  ght

those who have bested them. More than one adventuring

band has defeated a group of hadrimoi in battle only to  nd

themselves targeted by poison, ambush, and attacks against

allies and loved ones. To defeat a hadrimoi and let it live is

to create a lifelong enemy.

Hadrimoi with Class Levels

Hadrimoi usually advance as rogues. That class, the  ghter class,

and the ranger class are considered associated for hadrimoi.

Lashemoi  are  the  drudge  workers,  low-ranking  warriors,

and servitors of ushemoi society. Though lashemoi typically

toil under the direction of arkamoi and hadrimoi leaders,

turlemoi  sometimes  gather  lashemoi  to  them  as  hunters,

scouts, and expendable advance troops.

Without leadership, lashemoi keep to themselves. Though

they attack other creatures for food and treasure, they are

meek, cowardly, and easily driven off. Lashemoi avoid stand-

up  ghts even against weaker foes and are typically content

to take potshots at soft, easy targets.

Lashemoi have a natural connection to their ushemoi

brethren, but they are just as likely to be found in the service

of ogre mages, hobgoblin chieftains, evil clerics, and the like.

Other ushemoi refer to lashemoi as mongrels, not because

of their heritage, but for the lashemois tendency to follow

any charismatic creature.

Strategies and Tactics

Lashemoi are built for simple tactics. They rush forward

and attempt to overwhelm their enemies with raw num-

bers, relying on their lesser strength from pain ability to

amplify their fighting prowess. Superior odds and a clear

escape route are the lashemois only concerns in combat.

If  these  are  not  present,  lashemoi  are  unlikely  to  fight

unless pressed.

Lashemoi gain a deep, satisfying emotional rush from

their  lesser  strength  from  pain  ability.  As  a  lashemoi

takes damage, it enters an increasingly ecstatic state. As

a result, lashemoi that are lightly wounded can assess a

potential loss and flee from it, but those that have taken

grievous injuries typically fight to the death. Lashemoi

that are not badly injured use their allies battle lust to

cover their own retreat.

Lashemoi are strange creatures that become

stronger and tougher as they take damage in

combat. They are the weakest form of a race called

the ushemoi. This result reveals all monstrous

humanoid traits.

Lashemoi are especially susceptible to fear and

intimidation, but the longer they stay in combat,

the more  ercely they  ght.

The more damage a lashemoi takes, the greater

its combat prowess becomes. Opponents are

sometimes lulled into a false sense of security

by these creatures relative weakness, only to be

overcome by their sudden deadly ferocity.

Lashemoi under the command of an organized leader

are  willing  and  eager  servants.  They  are  easily  bullied,

and  their  naturally  timid  and  cowardly  nature  is  easily

overcome with sufficient prodding and training. Power-

ful creatures such as ogre mages love to use lashemoi as

disposable shock troops. This allows them to reserve their

less expendable followers until enemies are softened up

by lashemoi forces taking damage, growing stronger, and

fighting to the death.

TURLEMOI

The tall humanoid lumbering toward you resembles a giant stripped

of its skin, leaving glistening, bloody muscle exposed to the air. As it

of  esh. Its body twitches and twists, seeming to expand and solidify

Rising Courage (Ex) When a turlemois bonus on attack

rolls from its strength from pain ability is +3 or higher,

it becomes immune to all mind-affecting spells and

abilities. In such a state, turlemoi do not retreat from

combat.

Broken Courage (Ex) A turlemoi takes a 4 penalty on saves

against fear effects and on the level check made to

oppose an Intimidate check. In addition, a turlemoi can

be affected by fear effects that do not normally affect

creatures of its Hit Dice.

Rock Throwing (Ex) Like giants, turlemoi are accomplished

rock throwers. A turlemoi can hurl rocks of 20 to 30

pounds (Tiny objects) up to five range increments. The

range increment is 60 feet for a turlemois thrown rocks.

Strength from Pain (Ex) Whenever a turlemoi takes damage

from any source, it gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, a +2

bonus on damage rolls, and its natural armor bonus

to AC increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 minute

starting in the round during which a turlemoi first takes

damage in the encounter.

Bonuses stack each time a turlemoi takes damage,

to a maximum of a +5 bonus on attack rolls, a +10 bonus

on damage rolls, and a +10 natural armor bonus to AC.

These bonuses accrue each time a turlemoi takes damage

during that minute, even from multiple attacks in the

same round. At the end of that minute, all these bonuses

disappear. They could begin accumulating again if the

turlemoi takes more damage.

Turlemoi are the largest of the ushemoi. Solitary creatures,

they wander the wilderness and the back roads in search of

food or easy prey. As a turlemoi takes damage, its tendrils of

 esh fuse into a crimson shell that covers its body. A turlemoi

that has sustained several injuries looks like a giant with a

smooth, blood-red hide.

A  turlemois  personality  also  changes  as  its  body  trans-

forms. Though it starts out meek and fearful, it becomes more

con dent and wrathful the more damage it takes. Though

other creatures might start a  ght with con dence and  ee

when they are injured, turlemoi do the opposite. Once com-

mitted to combat, a turlemoi  ghts to the death.

Other  ushemoi  sometimes  corner  and  capture  lone

turlemoi to serve as warrior-slaves. Turlemoi are driven

forward from the front ranks with longspears, attaining a

peak of fearless battle fury as they reach the enemy.

Strategies and Tactics

Turlemoi might be brutes, but they have an instinctive

cunning. Some carry stones and clubs, bashing themselves

with these weapons to summon their strength of pain before

combat is joined. The rush of power more than offsets the

This creature is a turlemoi, one of a race called the

ushemoi. Turlemoi are hulking brawlers, and they

have a reputation for  ghting to the death.

Though turlemoi are the largest and strongest of

the ushemoi, they are naturally cowardly. However,

they grow in strength and courage as they take

damage, so those hoping to overcome these

brutes in combat must do so quickly.

Turlemoi in combat eventually become immune to

discomfort of their injuries. A turlemoi is typically too timid

to injure itself, though, and only imminent threats push it

to such action.

Given time, a turlemoi looks for a good place to set up

an ambush. However, even with their excellent natural

agility, turlemoi have little skill for such tactics. But they

like to ensure that the enemy is within melee range when

a battle begins.

Turlemoi with Class Levels

Like lashemoi, turlemoi favor the barbarian class, but some

advance as  ghters instead. Both these classes are considered

associated for turlemoi.

Level Adjustment: +4.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Though they can be encountered individually, ushemoi are

just as often found in mixed groups that take advantage of

their racial abilities.

Wizards  Bodyguard  (EL  4):  A  lone  arkamoi  acts  as

courier and bodyguard to an in uential necromancer, using

disguise self to take on the appearance of a young apprentice.

PCs  attempting  to  recover  a  relic  from  the  necromancers

sanctumor who are in possession of an item the necro-

mancer desires nd themselves shadowed by this apparent

stripling. However, the characters are in for an unpleasant

surprise when the arkamoi unleashes the escalating power

of its magic.

Thick as Thieves (EL 8): Three hadrimoi have banded

together to take over a rural village. By threatening farmers

and merchants, the hadrimoi have built up a widespread

protection racket and created a comfortable life for them-

selves. They take a hard line against characters who might

threaten their operation, including any PCs who happen to

pass through town.

Brute Force (EL 9): A group of three lashemoi serves under

a turlemoi chief that has learned to master its inherent cow-

ardice with self-in icted wounds to activate its strength from

pain. This group operates along the trade roads, attacking

small caravans and parties on foot. From cover, the turlemoi

uses its rock throwing to take out escort guards. It then sends

the lashemoi in to soften up any remaining defenses before

wading into the fray.

War Party (EL 10): This band of ushemoi consists of eight

lashemoi servants, an arkamoi leader, a hadrimoi scout, and

a turlemoi brute. Along a lonely stretch of forest road, the

arkamoi dispatches the hadrimoi to  nd promising targets

and attack. The hadrimoi then  ees in an effort to lure its

targets into the war partys ambush.

ECOLOGY

The ushemoi are a nomadic race. They lack the desire to form

permanent settlements even as they are compelled to keep

moving to avoid the attention of their former victims.

As a group, ushemoi are

adept  at  blending  into  so-

cieties  that  are  forgiving

of  their  strange  appear-

ance.  Hobgoblins  and

other  monstrous  races

use the simpler turlemoi

and  lashemoi  as  mer-

cenaries  or  slaves.  The

more intelligent hadri-

moi and arkamoi work

with other creatures as

hirelings or allies.

Little sense of loyalty

is found among the ushemoi,

particularly between arkamoi

and hadrimoi. These crea-

tures  constantly  jockey

for power, even betraying

their own kind to aid non-

ushemoi  if  the  price

is  right.  Other  evil

humanoids  might

dream of conquest

for the greater glo-

ry of their culture

or deities, but the

ushemoi  look  out

only  for  individual

interests.  The  idea  of

the ushemoi as a unified

race is alien to them.

Turlemoi and hadrimoi

Ushemoi form ragtag groups

that wander the forests and jungles of

unsettled frontier lands. They rarely form organized perma-

nent settlements, and even arkamoi prefer a life of wandering.

To the ushemoi mind, the best defense is to keep as far from

potential foes as possible. By constantly roving, ushemoi stay

one step ahead of the retribution their depredations would

otherwise inspire.

Ushemoi have a caste society as befits their four types.

Arkamoi are natural leaders and thinkers, and small cabals

of arkamoi direct the other ushemoi. Hadrimoi are schem-

ers and merchants. Though they prefer to use violence to

TYPICAL TREASURE

Ushemoi  covet  treasure  for  the  comforts  and  power  it

can buy them. A skilled arkamoi sorcerer might live in

luxury as a mercenary spellcaster within a drow city, and

even the dim-witted lashemoi recognize that coins buy

sustenance. Because they are constantly on the move, ush-

emoi favor highly portable treasure. They have standard

treasure for their Challenge Rating. Those ushemoi that

have class levels have standard equipment for an NPC of

their Challenge Rating.

VAMPIRES

As described in the Monster Manual, vampires are power-

ful undead creatures that prowl the night in search of the

blood that gives them sustenance. Incredibly intelligent

and equipped with a number of potent abilities, they are the

de nitive evil masterminds, forever conceiving ever more

nefarious plots.

This section presents two examples of vampires suitable

for use as recurring villains in an ongoing campaign or as

potent adversaries for high-level adventurers. One is a more

straightforward threat with considerable martial prowess,

and the other is a criminal mastermind potentially at the

center of a web of intrigue.

The  vampire  template  is  described  on  page  250  of  the

Monster Manual.

Banzai Charge (Ex) When making a charge, the Black Duke

can take a penalty to his AC and receive an equivalent

charging applies and counts toward the bonus. The Black

Duke can take a penalty from 2 to 17.

Blood Drain (Ex) The Black Duke can suck blood from

a living victim with his fangs by making a successful

grapple check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood,

dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the

pin is maintained. On each successful blood drain, the

Black Duke gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up

form of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard

action. When in his alternate form, the Black Duke

loses his natural slam attack and dominating

gaze ability, but he gains the natural weapons and

extraordinary special attacks of his new form. The

Black Duke can remain in bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire

wolf form until he chooses to assume a new form or

until the next sunrise.

Children of the Night (Su) Once per day, the Black Duke can

call 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of

Even  if  deprived  of  his

mount  and  allies,  the  Black  Duke  is  a  deadly

he employs greater shout to stun multiple

foes and deafen spellcasters.  He  then

paladins  over  all  others,  grap-

pling  the  chosen  target  so  that

he can drain that creatures blood. If

his opponents allies attempt to enter

the fray, the Black Duke counts

Challenge of the Black Duke (EL 19+): Through all

seasons, the Black Duke leads a host of undead through

the forlorn stretches of his demesne. Thundering forward

on his cauchemar nightmare steed (MM 194), he is accom-

panied by at least six elite vampires (MM 251) and up to

double this number of vampire spawn (MM 253). Sweeping

through his lands, he searches for would-be heroes to add

to his court.

The Black Duke and his entourage are an epic encounter

in every sense of the word. On his own, the vampire lord

is still formidable, but PCs have only one chance to engage

the Black Duke alone. When he  nds a party whose war-

riors have the mettle he seeks, the Black Duke approaches

at nightfall, alone, cloaked, and on foot so as not to give

his identity away. He issues his challenge only once, and

expects an immediate response. For PCs intent on destroy-

ing the Black Duke, the acceptance of this single-combat

challenge (whether as part of a previously prepared trap or

not) might be their only option.

Ecology

More than two hundred years ago, the Black Duke was

famous  for  his  courage  and  daring  on  the  battlefield.

Beloved by noble and commoner alike, this great knight

was a chivalrous champion, valiant and pure. However,

this bold exterior concealed his fear of death, the seed

of a dark corruption.

As a warrior, the knight had seen countless deaths and

had sent more than his share of foes to the darkness. Even

as each new enemy fell to his swift sword, he knew that he

must one day meet his match. Although he trained cease-

lessly, the knight dreaded his own mortality, fearing the

eventual day when he would be the one breathing his last

on the bloody battle eld.

As the Black Duke entered his twilight years, a great and

wild host of orcs poured into the knights lands. Bent on

rapine and destruction, these merciless killers butchered

with abandon. No longer the warrior he was, the once-great

knight quailed at the thought of donning his armor and

facing the enemy. And so he waited in his castle while his

subjects died. The exhortations of his fellow knights fell on

deaf ears, for he knew that if he went out against that host,

he would surely fall.

As his lands were conquered around him, the knight

descended into madness and fled to his inner chambers.

He begged the gods to spare him from death, vowing that

he would do whatever was asked of him in exchange for

the gift of immortality. His pleas gained the attention of

Orcus, who longed for mortal souls to feed his insatiable

hunger. The demon prince granted this knight the power

to  defeat  death  by  stealing  his  soul,  transforming  his

mortal form into the undead monstrosity it remains to

this day.

Environment: Filled with the power of undeath, the

Black Duke now fears no mortal foe. With his host, he often

rides the ruined remnants of his ravaged lands, looking for

intruders and worthy foes. He keeps a macabre court within

the crumbling halls of his stronghold.

Physical Characteristics: The Black Duke is a power-

fully built human male with a shock of white hair. No

compassion shows in his soulless black eyesonly mad-

ness and hatred. His features are smooth, but his skin is pale

and translucent, revealing a tangle of bright red arteries

and black veins beneath. The Black Duke is rarely without

his mithral breastplate, which is engraved with images of

wolves and bats. He wears his howling helm whenever he

leaves his keep.

Alignment: The Black Duke is thoroughly insane and

immoral. Corrupt to the core and a servant of the demon

prince Orcus, he is capricious, prone to violent outbursts

and slaughterous behavior. Though he can also be pleasant,

disarming, and (to some) seductive, the Black Duke typi es

chaotic evil.

Society

Soon after the Black Dukes transformation, he slew the few

knights who remained faithful to him, draining them of their

life energy and watching them rise as his eternal servants.

At the same time, the in uence of Orcus cursed his dying

lands, corrupting its dead and driving the superstitious orcs

away. The Black Dukes court is now a mockery of its past

glory,  lled with shuf ing zombies, ravenous ghouls, and

the ghosts of those he betrayed with his cowardice.

Emboldened  by  the  gift  bestowed  by  Orcus,  the  Black

Duke rides through the night in the company of his warriors.

He surveys his lands as he did when he was alive. However,

instead of the revels and celebrations of the past, the shat-

tered bones of the dead and the ruins of his  efs are stark

reminders of his unholy corruption.

Typical Treasure

The Black Dukes wealth lies in the weapons and armor that

are the tools of his trade. His deep and abiding fear of  nal

death drives the vampire lord to spend the bulk of his wealth

on protective items. His total wealth is comparable to a player

character of his Challenge Rating.

Ghost Sight (Su) The Red Widow can see ethereal and

invisible creatures and objects within her normal range of

vision.

Great Leap (Su) Makes Jump checks as if running with the

Run feat. Complete Adventurer 8.

Spider Climb (Ex) Climb sheer surfaces as though with a

spider climb spell.

Energy Drain (Su) Living creatures hit by the Red Widows

slam attack gain two negative levels. For each negative

level bestowed, the Red Widow gains 5 temporary hit

points that last for up to 1 hour. DC 19 Fortitude save to

remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Blood Drain (Ex) The Red Widow can suck blood from

a living victim with her fangs by making a successful

grapple check. If she pins the foe, she drains blood,

dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the

pin is maintained. On each successful blood drain, the

Red Widow gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up

to 1 hour

Frightful Attack (Su) The Red Widow can designate a melee

sudden strike attack as a frightful attack. She must

use her Power Attack feat and take a penalty of at least

1 on the attack roll. If the attack deals damage, the

victim must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or die. On a

successful save, the victim is shaken for 8 rounds.

Those within 30 feet (except the Red Widow, her

victim, and her allies) who see the frightful attack

become panicked (if they have 10 or fewer Hit Dice) or

shaken for 8 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 20 +

the damage bonus from the Red Widows Power Attack)

negates this effect.

This is a mind-affecting fear ability that cannot affect

creatures that have 16 or more Hit Dice.

Sudden Strike (Ex) As sneak attack (PH 50), but no extra

damage when flanking. Complete Adventurer 8.

Alternate Form (Su) The Red Widow can assume the form

of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action.

natural slam attack and dominating gaze ability, but she

gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special

attacks of her new form. The Red Widow can remain in

bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf form until she chooses to

assume a new form or until the next sunrise.

Children of the Night (Su) Once per day, the Red Widow

can call 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack

of 3d6 wolves. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and

serve the Red Widow for 1 hour.

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid or monstrous humanoid

slain by the Red Widows energy drain rises as a vampire

spawn 1d4 days after burial. If the Red Widow instead

drains the victims Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim

returns as a spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a

vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new

vampire or spawn is under the Red Widows command

and remains enslaved until her destruction.

At any given time, the Red Widow can have no more

than 30 enslaved spawn, though vampires she creates

can have enslaved spawn of their own.

Dominating Gaze (Su) As the dominate person spell, range 30

feet, Will DC 19 negates, caster level 12th. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Gaseous Form (Su) As the gaseous form spell; at will; caster

The mighty vampire known as the Red Widow controls a

network of undead assassins in the cities of a half-dozen

lands. Known for their consummate professionalism and

ef ciency at killing, the members of the Red Widows brigade

are among the most highly sought-after killers in the realm

and beyond.

The vampire presented here was human before gaining the

vampire template, and she had the following ability scores

before Hit Dice and racial ability score adjustments: Str 14,

Dex 15, Con 8, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 10.

Strategies and Tactics

The  Red  Widow  is  a  cautious  combatant,  never

entering into a  ght she feels she cannot win. With

incredible patience and care, the vampire lady can

watch her prey for days or even weeks. As they go

about their normal business, her targets remain

blissfully unaware of the deadly threat that

lurks just out of sight.

While on the hunt at

night, the Red Widow

prefers  to  assume  gas-

eous form to blend in with

the  wisps  of  fog  that

rise from the streets.

On  clear  nights,  she

might transform into a

wolf or a bat, depending

on the appropriateness of

the form. Otherwise, she

simply hides in the shad-

ows, silently following her

prey as she waits for the op-

timal moment to strike.

The  Red  Widow  attacks

with surprise whenever possible.

Against overly cautious oppo-

nents, she uses her ghost

step ability to become in-

visible  or  ethereal,  then

strikes as if from nowhere.

To initiate combat, she makes a

frightful attack, weakening a foe she

fails  to  kill.  On  subsequent  rounds,  she

makes extensive use of ghost step to ensure that she deals

sudden strike damage. Once her victim is unconscious or

dying, she feeds.

If the Red Widow is fought on her own turf, she becomes

even more dangerous. The vampire surrounds herself with

an army of minionsvampires, wights, wraiths, and other

undead. Given time to prepare, she calls forth rats or wolves to

slow intruders, ordering her minions to attack any foes who

break past that  rst line of defense. Only if confronted with

superior opponents does the Red Widow retreat. Otherwise,

she uses her dominating gaze to control her attackers, then

lays into them with frightful strike to make them rue the

day they set foot in her lair.

Sample Encounter

Unless the  ght is brought to her, the Red Widow chooses

the time and place of her battles. She is driven to remain

in control of any situation, and if combat turns against her,

she  has  no  qualms  about  saving  herself  at  the  expense  of

her followers.

Red  Widow  Strike  Team  (EL

19): The Red Widow and two elite

vampires (MM 251) have tak-

en  a  commission  to  murder

a highly placed noble in the

city. After infiltrating the

compound and dominating

key  members  of  the  nobles

household, they prepare their

attack. Though the terms of their

mission  are  simply  to  eliminate

the target, the Red Widow intends

to alter the bargaintransforming the

noble into a vampire so that she can

expand her in uence in the city.

Ecology

Before  her  rebirth  as  a  vam-

pire,  the  Red  Widow  was  an

infamous killer in the realms

largest  city,  taking  her  name

from the crimson cloak that was

her trademark. The Red Widows

decision to refuse to join the assas-

sins  guild  in  favor  of  operating  as

an independent made her numerous

enemies. To protect herself, she gath-

ered  intelligence  regarding  key

personnel in the guild, threat-

ening to reveal their identities

if  they  made  a  move  against

her. To prove her point, she ex-

posed a member of a leading noble family

as one of the guilds inner circle. The scandal

that erupted rocked the city.

The Red Widow

Enraged by this young upstarts hubris, the assassins

plotted  to  have  her  removed  as  a  means  of  protecting

themselves and their clients. Because they knew the Red

Widow would be watching for any sign of retaliation, they

enlisted the aid of a small but powerful cult of Pyremius

(Complete Divine 123). In exchange for the living victims

required for their dark rites, the cultists vowed to deal with

this troublesome rogue.

To carry out the job, the priests of the murderous deity

looked to their leadera mighty vampire who had taken over

the cult years before. After easily tracking the elusive Red

Widow, the vampire cornered her in her apartments, bending

her to his will with his dominating gaze ability. Intrigued by

her particular talents and inspired by his wicked faith, the

vampire decided not to slay the Red Widow outright, instead

allowing her to join him in his unhallowed state.

When  the  Red  Widow  awoke,  her  rage  was  beyond

measure. At the same time, she was fascinated by the dark

gifts the priest had granted her. She learned the ways of her

new form quickly, impressing her new master and earning

his trust and con dence. When he  nally con rmed her

suspicions regarding who was behind the attack on her, the

Red Widow slipped out into the night and drank deeply of

the blood of the assassins who had sought to destroy her. In

the aftermath, she left the city where she had made her name,

never to return. All the long years since, she has sought and

made her fortune far from the conspiracies and treacheries

of that place.

Environment: Since her transformation, the Red Widow

has established a network of hired killers in cities across the

continent. She splits her time between several lairs, traveling

to and from them by means of a sleek ebony carriage drawn

by nine black horses. One of her various cof ns is contained

within a secret compartment in the cabs cargo space.

This is the Red Widow, a ruthless vampire who

commands a large network of vampire assassins.

This is the Black Duke, a fallen knight turned

vampire lord. He prowls the ruins of his former

lands in search of new champions to convert to

his unholy cause.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Though she prefers urban environments, the Red Widow

has been known to venture to remote locations to carry out

special assignments.

Physical Characteristics: The Red Widow appears as a

beautiful young female with long auburn hair and pale skin.

Upon closer examination, her striking features reveal a hard-

ened edge and the promise of violence. She wears clothes of

deep red that are tailored for combat, with a billowing cloak

of the same color. Her bestial appearance asserts itself only

when she is angry, her face twisting into a snarling visage as

she reveals her fangs.

Alignment: The Red Widow values self-preservation

above all else. Every action she takes is designed with her

own luxury and safety in mind. Though she was rarely

virtuous to begin with, her transformation drained her of all

compassion and other softer emotions, leaving her staunchly

neutral evil.

Society

Nominally freed from her creators influence, the Red

Widow abandoned her past life to begin anew. Faced with

the constant and gnawing need for life energy, she saw a

perfect union between her talents as a killer and the new

abilities gained from her transformation. However, she knew

that the assassins guild that had once hunted her might

have a long reach. Though its leaders had died at her hands,

their successors were bound to seek her again. Rather than

leaving her future to chance, the Red Widow in ltrated a

smaller cell of assassins in her new home city, transforming

the best of them into vampire thralls and consuming those

who failed her.

For the last  fty years, the Red Widow and her minions

have in ltrated an increasing number of criminal organiza-

tions, expanding their roles as hired killers to encompass

less romantic but often more pro table enterprises. From

smuggling to extortion, petty theft to protection rackets,

a significant amount of the criminal underworlds opera-

tions in the major cities of the land is controlled by the Red

Widows operatives.

The Red Widow prefers to surround herself with other

undead creatures she can trust, but she realizes that her vam-

piric minions run the risk of exposing themselves through

their need to feed. Accordingly, she conceals her true nature

and uses living minions to manage her interests and see to

the day-to-day operation of her organization.

Typical Treasure

Though the Red Widow appreciates the finer things in

life, she is also practical. Nearly all her wealth is in the

form of personal possessions (chiefly weapons and magic

items) that enhance her other talents. The success of her

organization allows her to ensure that her underlings are

properly equipped for the missions they undertake. Her

total  wealth  is  comparable  to  a  player  character  of  her

Woodland Stride (Ex) A verdant reaver can move through

overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal

speed and without taking damage or suffering any other

impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that have been magically manipulated to impede

motion still affect it.

Verdant Growth (Su) Squares adjacent to a verdant reaver

spring up with low brush and tangled roots, even if they

are actually bare stone. It costs 2 squares of movement to

enter a square of verdant growth, and the DC of Tumble

checks increases by 2 in such squares. This growth also

imposes a 2 penalty on Move Silently checks. Squares of

verdant growth revert to their normal state as soon as a

verdant reaver is no longer adjacent.

Verdant Rend (Ex) If both of a verdant reavers slams hit a

single target that is touching the ground and adjacent to

the reaver, verdant growth tears at that target, dealing an

extra 1d8+7 points of damage.

Those who live their lives in the service of a dryad become

changed over time, becoming one with the natural world

of their mistress. In the end, they are transformed into

verdant reavers, losing all memory of their former lives as

they become thralls of the fey.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A verdant reaver typically begins combat with a Power-

ful Charge to measure a foes relative strength. Against

weaker  melee  threats  or  creatures  that  have  reach,  a

verdant reaver tries to remain adjacent to make use of its

verdant rend ability. Foes that make multiple attacks in

melee are instead kept 5 feet away, forcing them to move

into the area of the reavers verdant growth if they wish

to attack. Since this movement cannot be accomplished

with merely a 5-foot step, such foes cannot make a full

attack.  Additionally,  they  might  provoke  an  attack  of

opportunity when they move through the verdant reavers

threatened area.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Verdant  reavers  are  typically  encountered  with  their

dryad mistresses or some other controller. However, since

they are not bound to a particular tree as dryads are, they

can range a considerable distance as they carry out their

mistresss commands.

Mistaken Identity (EL 9): A pair of dryads (MM 90)

has mistaken the PCs for the woodcutters who slew their

sister. The dryads three verdant reaver servants launch

an  attack  while  the  dryads  hang  back  using  tree  shape.

After  1  round  of  combat,  the  dryads  take  their  normal

forms and use tree stride to move behind the PCs. From

that position, they use suggestion against spellcasters and

try to catch other characters with deep slumber or entangle,

taking care to avoid the verdant reavers in the process.

The PCs might be able to talk to the dryads and end the

fight, but the verdant reavers stop attacking only if a dryad

orders them to.

ECOLOGY

When a dryad charms a humanoid creature to her service,

that creature slowly begins to absorb the essence of his fey

mistress and the forest she defends. The life of a dryads

thrall is a harsh one. Such creatures experience all the

wildness of the weather and the changing of the seasons,

and they are forced to scramble for shelter, warmth, and

food. Thralls must also survive the tasks their dryads

set for them, including defending the dryad from

threats,  delivering  messages  to  other

dryads in the area, and searching through

the  forest  for  shiny  stones,  weathered

wood, and other items that strike the

dryads fancy.

If a humanoid survives this treat-

ment  for  a  year  and  a  day  (and

assuming the dryad does not simply

grow bored and dismiss him), he

awakens to  nd himself rooted

to  the  ground.  His  transfor-

mation  into  a  plant  creature

takes place over the course of

that day. The creatures hair falls

out, and his skin takes on the

texture of bark. The thralls

dryad  mistress  might  at-

tempt to comfort him during

this  distressing  and

painful process. At-

tempting to cut or

tear  the  creature

from  the  ground

kills  it  instantly,  but

a remove disease or re-

move curse spell frees

the thrall from the trans-

formation process.

If not freed before sundown,

the thrall becomes a verdant reaver, forget-

ting nearly all its past life and possessing undying loyalty to

the dryad who created it.

Evil and neutral dryads delight in creating verdant reaver

servants,  seeking  out  those  hapless  souls  who  pass  too

close to their domains. Good dryads rarely make verdant

reavers intentionally, sometimes discovering the process

only after a romantic attraction to a humanoid turns to

dark  possessiveness.  Thereafter,  a  good  dryad  creates  a

verdant reaver only if she believes a thrall is worthy of

the punishment.

Freeing a thrall from a dryad can be a simple matter

of  dispelling  the  charm  effect  that  binds  it,  but  such

creatures  can  also  be  easily  freed  while  they  sleep.  A

dryads  charm  person  spell-like  ability  normally  lasts  6

hours and can be used three times per day. This leaves a

6-hour period during which the thrall is free of the dryads

charm. Dryads typically use suggestion to order the thrall

to sleep and take shelter until morning, whereupon the

dryad can renew her charm. If approached and awakened

during this period, a thrall might be easily convinced to

escape its servitude.

Environment: Verdant reavers live primarily in the

temperate forests where dryads are found. However, those

that have broken with or been dismissed by their

dryad mistresses wander far a eld in search of

another mistress to obey and protect.

If  properly  commanded  and  treated

well, a verdant reaver might follow a new

mistress even out of its normal forest

environment. Rumors sometimes tell

of these creatures living entirely un-

derground as the servants of strange

druid sects.

Typical  Physical  Charac-

teristics: Weighing 600 to 1,000

pounds, verdant reavers resemble

animated  fallen  logs  or  drift-

wood more than living plants.

They stand 12 to 15 feet tall,

but  their  hunched  posture

makes them appear slightly

shorter.

Alignment:  Verdant

reavers are creatures of raw

nature, so they have no

moral connection to their

former lives or even the

dryads  who  created

them. They are almost

always neutral.

Verdant reaver

Once its transformation is com-

plete, a verdant reaver loses almost all

connection to the being it once was. As creatures devoted

to the individual dryads who created them, verdant reavers

have no society of their own. However, they all share com-

mon traits. Verdant reavers must serve a mistressa female

creature (or one that appears to be female) willing to give the

verdant reaver orders. In the absence of its creator dryad, a

verdant reaver seeks out another mistress.

Verdant reavers in search of a new mistress seek out

nymphs, sprites, and forest-dwelling humanoids who com-

monly speak Sylvan, such as druids and elves. If it goes

without a mistress for a year and a day, a verdant reaver dies.

In the service of the fey or other creatures that protect nature,

these creatures can live inde nitely.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Verdant reavers have little use for treasure, but they are

compelled to collect valuables. They give this wealth to their

mistresses as tribute. A verdant reaver without a mistress car-

ries its treasure in the hollows of its barklike skin. Verdant

reavers have half standard treasure for their Challenge Rating,

mostly in gems and magic items.

VINESPAWN

As you approach it, the vine-covered tree before you suddenly shud-

ders. A towering mass of tendrils peels away from the trunk to form

a distinct creature, the tight mesh of its vine form thrashing as it

Vine Net (Ex) A vinespawn can hurl parts of its body up to 30

feet as a ranged attack. Each of these tightly wound balls

of vine opens in flight to form a net that can entangle

a creature up to one size category larger than the

vinespawn. A vinespawn can create one vine net per day

for every 4 Hit Dice that it has (normally three per day).

Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a vinespawn can flow

over Medium or smaller creatures, entrapping them

within its form. The vinespawn simply moves into

the opponents space; any creature whose space it

completely covers is subject to the engulf attack. A

vinespawn cannot make slam or vine net attacks during

a round in which it engulfs. It can engulf as many

creatures as can fit in its space.

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against a

vinespawn, but if they do they are not entitled to a saving

throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity

must succeed on a DC 18 Reflex save or be engulfed; on

a success, a creature moves aside or back (opponents

choice) to move out of the vinespawns path. The save

DC is Strength-based.

As a swift action, a vinespawn can crush engulfed

creatures, dealing 2d6+12 points of nonlethal damage.

Engulfed creatures are considered grappled and trapped

within the vinespawns body, but they can attempt to

damage the vinespawn or escape from it as with a normal

grapple. A vinespawn is not considered to be grappling

when it has engulfed a creature, and it cannot be pinned

by an engulfed creature.

A creature engulfed by a vinespawn is subject to any

area effect to which the vinespawn is subjected. Grappled

and engulfed creatures lose any Dexterity bonus to AC

but gain a +4 bonus on Reflex saves for having cover.

An engulfed creature takes half damage from any attack

that deals piercing damage to the vinespawn. This half

damage is calculated before the vinespawns damage

reduction is applied to the attack.

A vinespawn can choose to expel engulfed creatures

as a standard action. If a vinespawn is killed, any engulfed

creatures are freed.

Spawning (Ex) As a standard action, a vinespawn can

attempt to insert its spawning root down the throat of

an engulfed humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or giant.

An unconscious engulfed creature cannot resist the

spawning root. A vinespawn must succeed on a grapple

check to infect any other creature. The engulfed creature

takes 1d6+8 points of damage as the thorny appendage

burrows into its stomach. The presence of a spawning

root prevents talking, the casting of any spells with verbal

components, and other activities requiring speech.

Removing a spawning root requires a successful grapple

check by the creature invaded by the root, but doing so

deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. If the vinespawn

is killed, the spawning root can be removed without

dealing damage.

A spawning root nourishes an unconscious creature,

keeping it breathing while the vinespawn uses periodic

swift actions to deal nonlethal damage and keep the

target unconscious. If the target creature is left in this

state for 1 day, vines grow through its veins. On the

fourth day in this state, the victim dies as an adult

vinespawn exits the body of its parent.

A vinespawn that is attacked during the spawning

process can fight back but cannot move without

disengaging its spawning root. Only if reduced to 20 or

fewer hit points does it break off, disengaging the vine,

dealing damage as above, and fleeing with engulfed

creatures in tow.

If extracted before the fourth day, the victim is

sickened even when returned to consciousness. Such

victims die in 2d4 days unless remove disease is used to

destroy the vines that can be seen growing beneath

their skin.

This mobile mass of vines is a vinespawn, a skilled

and cunning hunter.

22  A vinespawn has a vicious slam attack and can

hurl parts of its own body at opponents as vine

nets. It can engulf opponents by simply rolling

over them, trapping and crushing creatures within

the mesh of its body.

27  Vinespawns do not feed on living creatures,

but those they hunt meet a more grisly fate.

Vinespawns reproduce by spawning within a living

host, which becomes a new vinespawn after four

days.

Skills Vinespawns have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and Hide checks. They can choose to take 10 on Climb

checks even if rushed or threatened. In forested areas,

a vinespawns racial bonus on Hide checks increases

to +16.

Creatures of the deep woodlands, vinespawns are cunning

hunters who strike without warning.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Vinespawns  prefer  to  ambush  prey,  and

they  usually  flee  from  a  fight  in  which

they  are  at  a  disadvantage  from  the  start.

Vinespawns initiate combat by hurling vine nets

at  those  bearing  slashing  weapons,  then  charge

into melee.

A  vinespawn  batters  its  opponents

with slams, engulfing any crea-

tures  it  can.  It  uses  further

vine nets to hinder ranged

attackers and  anking foes.

When it has rendered an en-

gulfed victim unconscious,

a vinespawn retreats into the

surrounding trees.

Once it is in a place of safety, a vinespawn

engages in spawning. Unless attacked, the

vinespawn stays hidden until the pro-

cess is complete.

SAMPLE

ENCOUNTERS

Vinespawns  are  cunning  hunt-

ers driven solely by their need to

spawn. Vinespawns typically dwell alone in

the deep forest, though groups of these creatures

are known to lurk along trade routes. Such groups typically

number six or fewer vinespawns, led by the largest and most

aggressive specimen. The members of larger packs inevitably

turn on each other in their competition for suitable spawn-

ing hosts and space.

Creeping Death (EL 7): A single vinespawn lurks in the

trees  near  a  well-traveled  path,  waiting  for  unsuspecting

creatures to pass beneath it. Once it has engulfed its prey, it

returns to its nearby lair.

Bivouac Bushwack (EL 11): Four vinespawns lurk in

the woodlands around an established campsite. Though

merchant caravans and adventurers regularly stop here, no

travelers have been through the area in a number of weeks.

Members of the pack are growing bold.

The vinespawns attack when campers settle in for the

night. When battle begins, three of the creatures hurl vine

nets from different directions before charging. The fourth

hangs back to use its vine nets against those who  ee or who

deal signi cant damage with ranged attacks.

Vinespawn

ECOLOGY

As plant creatures, vinespawns do not hunt for food. They

are thus indifferent to the birds and animals sharing their

woodlands. Only Small or larger crea-

tures  are  suitable  for  spawning,  so

vinespawns ignore all others.

During the day, vinespawns sun

themselves on the highest boughs

of the trees they call home, keep-

ing watch for suitable prey. As dusk

falls, they creep forth to seek water

in secluded pools and streams, and

then they begin to hunt.

Environment: Vinespawns

dwell  in  vine-choked  groves  of

tall trees in temperate and warm

forests. Within the vines, they

fashion intricate nests that have

several  distinct  chambers.  The

nests  of  a  vinespawn  pack  are

interconnected. In areas where

vine growth rises well above the

ground, vinespawn nests rise with

it. These creatures sometimes lair

high in the forest canopy, spawning

safely out of reach of any threats.

Typical  Physical  Char-

acteristics:  Vinespawns  are

towering creatures composed

of living vines in a tightly wo-

ven mesh. Their bodies

are  supple  but  strong.

A  vinespawn  stands

12 feet tall and weighs

1,500 pounds.

Alignment: Vinespawns are creatures focused only on

the need to spawn. They are neutral.

SOCIETY

When strong winds batter the forest, vinespawns climb to

the highest branches of their tree sanctuaries. There, they

contort their bodies to catch and funnel the wind, creating

a cacophony of strange wailing sounds that can be heard for

miles. Though the creatures reasons for doing so remain a

mystery, they do so in unison. Those who hear these sounds

describe them as the cries of the damned. Numerous stories

of haunted woodlands have no doubt been inspired by the

presence of vinespawns.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Vinespawns have no interest in treasure, but the gear of those

they have engulfed sometimes remains caught up in the tight

vine mesh of their bodies. Such gear might include weapons,

jewelry, and magic items. Vinespawns have standard treasure

for their Challenge Rating.

It threatens a critical hit on a roll of 1920, dealing triple

damage on a successful critical hit.

Invisibility (Su) Three times per day, as a swift action, a

vivisector can become invisible for 1 round. A vivisector

remains invisible even when it attacks.

Vivisection (Ex) As a full-round action, rather than

performing a coup de grace, a vivisector can hack into

the chest of a helpless humanoid, attempting to harvest

choice organs for its personal use. Treat this as an

automatic critical hit with a single claw attack that also

heals the vivisector of the same amount of damage. If the

target is killed, its corpse is rendered unsuitable for spells

such as raise dead that require an intact body. If the victim

survives, the vivisector moves on, ignoring it in favor of

other creatures.

Unnatural Biology (Ex) Vivisectors are unnatural creatures

that do not eat, drink, breathe, or heal naturally. Instead,

they draw sustenance from the vital organs of others.

Skills Vivisectors have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Move

Silently, and Spot checks.

Vivisectors are gruesome creatures that dwell in the darkest

corners of humanoid cities and towns. They prey on the weak

and the helpless, gorging themselves on the living organs

that extend their unnatural lives.

200

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Vivisectors are cowardly foes, preferring to attack from

hiding whenever possible. They rely on their ability to hide

or turn invisible to avoid direct confrontation and escape

from superior forces. Once engaged, however, a vivisector

 ghts  with  a  single-minded  ferocity.  It  uses  its  claws  to

tear opponents apart as it attempts to cripple them with its

poison sting.

Vivisectors attack and slay any creatures, but they must feed

exclusively on humanoids. Once a vivisector has a humanoid

foe immobilized or unconscious, it cuts into the creatures

chest to claim vital organs, incorporating such viscera into

its body.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

On the fringes of humanoid settlements, vivisectors are

encountered alone. In larger towns and cities, packs of these

creatures are more common.

Death By Night (EL 4): A farming village lives in fear of

an unseen killer. Over the past two weeks, cattle and local

wildlife have begun to turn up dead and mutilated. Now,

the vivisector responsible has turned its attention to the

townsfolk, and two farmers and a hunter have been slain

so far.

Scourge of the Sewers (EL 8): Residents of a small city

initially blamed a turf war within the thieves guild when

a number of low-level bravos and operatives began to dis-

appear. However, a half-dozen merchants and respectable

townsfolk have since vanished, and the guild and the city

lords alike are seeking answers. A network of abandoned

sewers beneath the city has been claimed by a pack of four

vivisectors responsible for the disappearancesa pack whose

hunger is growing.

riods of time before the organs

VIVISECTORS IN EBERRON

Vivisectors are frequently found in the depths of Khyber,

preying on explorers, Khyber shard prospectors, and the

surface  communities  above.  These  grotesque  creatures

have been spotted in the deepest levels of Sharns Cogs,

and particularly grisly murders are often written off to

the hunger of a vivisector. The dwarves of the Mror Holds

face regular attacks by vivisectors, and some suspect that

a great conclave of the creatures dwells deep beneath the

Hoar frost Mountains.

VIVISECTORS IN FAERN

The Underdark is the traditional home of vivisectors in

Faern, and all the races of that subterranean realm fear

these  creatures.  Rumors  tell  of  a  great  hive  of  vivisec-

tors  located  beneath  the  Thunder  Peaks.  There,  one  of

their  number  is  said  to  have  attained  great  power,  and

is believed to be summoning its foul kin to its side for

some dark purpose.

201

ECOLOGY

Vivisectors do not

consume their hu-

manoid  victims

in any tradition-

al  sense.  Rather,

they dissect the fall-

en  for  vital  organs.

Removed  innards

are  placed  inside

the vivisectors hol-

low carapace. As the

essence of such entrails

is absorbed, the organs

wither and rot, requiring

the vivisector to constantly

search for fresh supplies.

Vivisectors reproduce through

an asexual process that requires

harvesting the organs of no few-

er than ten Medium humanoid creatures. During this time,

a vivisector becomes more and more bloated as the organs it

claims are slowly processed and transformed inside its body.

After two weeks, the vivisector opens its carapace to release

a smaller version of itself. Within a week, the new creature

has matured to full size, and it leaves its parent to  nd its own

domain to terrorize.

When slain, a vivisector falls to pieces, spilling its stolen

organs  and  shattered  carapace  to  the  ground  in  a  reeking

heap. Vivisectors are not known to die of old age. As long as

a constant supply of victims can be found, these creatures

might live forever.

Vivisector

Environment: Vivisectors are found in secluded locations

close to potential victims, such as the sewers beneath a city

or a defensible cavern near a small town. Though bright

light causes them no negative effect, they have an aversion

to it, preferring darkness and gloom as a backdrop for their

grisly work.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An average vivisector

stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds. Its body

resembles that of a giant praying mantis, with talons at the

end of each arm and a pair of dark but translucent wings.

Alignment: Vivisectors are wholly devoted to their dark

hunger, as methodical as they are sinister. They are always

lawful evil.

Hunters Howl (Su) As a free action, a hound of the hunt can

release an echoing howl. Those within a 120-foot-radius

spread must succeed on a DC 28 Will save or be shaken

for 1 minute. A creature that saves cannot be affected by

that same hound of the hunts howl for 24 hours.

Skills Hounds of the hunt are accomplished hunters that can

stalk their prey as silently as a shadow. They have a +8

racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks and a +4

racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

The Wild Hunt sends the bravest heroes of the land  ee-

ing before the master of the hunt and his hounds.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A  master  of  the  hunt  savors  the  hunting  experience.  He

chooses one highly skilled or mighty creature to stalk, then

runs that creature down in an exciting chase.

When his prey stands its ground or a master of the hunt

tires of the chase, he marks his target with the selected

prey ability. His hounds then charge in, tying up the victim

and its allies in melee. The master  res arrows at his target to

kill it, then disdainfully dispatches others foolish enough

to stand against him.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

The Wild Hunt is a rare event that

usually occurs toward the end

of the year.

Night of the Hunt: In late

autumn, a master of the hunt

appears with four hounds,

stalking  the  land  and  slay-

ing the mighty. The hunter

eventually chooses a PC who is

particularly skilled at avoiding capture

as prey. That characters allies oppose

the hunt at their peril.

ECOLOGY

Masters of the hunt were fey monarchs

who ruled their courts for centuries before the tedium of

existence drove them to hunt powerful mortals. Now they

spend their time searching for worthy foes. They are endur-

ing, tireless, and immortal.

The hounds of the hunt are ferocious canines made blood-

thirsty by centuries of training and magical alteration. They

are almost as durable as their masters.

Environment: The Wild Hunt can roam across an entire

world, but a master of the hunt prefers to stalk prey at night

in the wide outdoors.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Masters of the hunt

are lithe and regal el ike creatures, standing 8 feet in height

and weighing 300 or more pounds.

Hounds of the hunt are slavering monstrosities the size

of grizzly bears. Their coats glitter slightly as if covered in a

sheen of starlight.

Alignment: A master of the hunt is an amoral creature

that thrills in the pursuit and slaying of mortal foes. He isnt

cruel, but he is certainly merciless. Those masters of the hunt

that arent chaotic neutral are chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Masters of the hunt care nothing for glittering gold or

sparkling jewels. The thrill of the hunt is all they lust after.

Their listed possessions are all they have.

WILD HUNT LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (nature) can learn

more about the Wild Hunt. When a character makes a suc-

cessful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the

information from lower DCs.

Knowledge (Nature)

DC  Result

32

This large, el ike creature is a master of the hunt,

a cruel fey that seeks to prove his skill against the

mightiest foes. The four hounds that accompany

him are hounds of the hunt, magical beasts totally

loyal to their master. The master is an archer

of incredible skill, and the hounds are frightful

hunters with supernatural howls.

The moon is the eye of the Wild Hunt, and anyone

under its light is more susceptible to the attacks of

a master and his hounds. A master of the hunt can

summon a steed instantly, and he can mark a foe

as his quarry, making it easier to  nd and slay that

creature.

37

42  A master of the hunt cannot be bargained with.

Only those who elude him for a night or slay him

can expect to survive. He is most vulnerable to

epic weapons crafted from cold iron, while the

hounds are vulnerable to cold iron weapons

imbued with magic.

Presented here are feats used by monsters in this book.

MONSTER FEATS

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its

spell-like abilities.

ABILITY FOCUS

A particular special ability of a creature that has this feat is

more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Special ability that allows a saving throw.

Bene  t: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against

the special ability on which the creature focuses.

Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Its

effects do not stack. Each time the creature takes the feat, it

applies to a different special ability.

AWESOME BLOW

A creature that has this feat can choose to deliver blows that

send its smaller opponents  ying like bowling pins.

Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush,

size Large or larger.

Bene  t: As a standard action, the creature can choose

to  subtract  4  from  its  melee  attack  roll  and  deliver  an

awesome blow. If the creature hits a corporeal opponent

smaller  than  itself  with  an  awesome  blow,  its  opponent

must succeed on a Re ex save (DC equal to damage dealt)

or be knocked  ying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking

creatures choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can

push the opponent only in a straight line, and the opponent

cant move closer to the attacking creature than the square

it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the

opponents move, the opponent and the obstacle each take

1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space

adjacent to the obstacle.

Special: A  ghter can select Awesome Blow as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY

The creature can use a spell-like ability with greater effect

than normal.

Prerequisite:  Spell-like  ability  at  caster  level  6th  or

higher.

Bene  t: Choose one of the creatures spell-like abilities,

subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that

ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day

(or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice

per day).

When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability,

all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are

increased by one half. Saving throws and opposed rolls are

not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables

are not affected.

The creature can select only a spell-like ability duplicating a

spell of a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round

down) 2. For a summary, see the table in the description of

the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat.

FLYBY ATTACK

A creature that has this feat can attack on the wing.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Bene  t: When  ying, the creature can take a move action

(including a dive) and another standard action at any point

during the move. The creature cannot take a second move

action during a round when it makes a  yby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard

action either before or after its move.

HOVER

The creature can come to a halt in midair.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Bene  t: When  ying, the creature can halt its forward

motion and hover in place as a move action. It can then  y

in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at

half speed, regardless of its maneuverability.

If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in

place for the turn and take a full-round action. A hover-

ing creature cannot make wing attacks, but it can attack

with all other limbs and appendages it could use in a full

attack. The creature can instead use a breath weapon or

cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if it could

normally do so.

If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet

of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft

from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius

of 60 feet. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small

camp res, exposed lanterns, and other small, open  ames of

non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to

10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss

chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment

(50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate

the creature).

Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration

check (DC 10 + 1/2 creatures HD) to cast a spell.

Normal: Without this feat, a creature must keep moving

when  ying unless it has good or better maneuverability.

IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK

The natural attacks of a creature that has this feat are more

dangerous than its size and type would otherwise dictate.

Prerequisite: Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: The damage for one of the creatures natural

attack forms increases by one step, as if the creatures size

had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6,

3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. A weapon or attack that deals 1d10

points of damage increases as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8,

6d8, 8d8, 12d8.

IMPROVED TOUGHNESS

A creature that has this feat is significantly tougher than

normal.

Prerequisite: Base Fortitude save bonus +2.

Bene  t: The creature gains a number of hit points equal

to its current Hit Dice. Each time it gains a Hit Die (such

as by gaining a level or advancing), it gains 1 additional hit

point. If it loses a Hit Die (such as by losing a level), it loses

1 hit point permanently.

Special: A  ghter can select Improved Toughness as one

of his  ghter bonus feats.

MULTIATTACK

A creature that has this feat is adept at using all its natural

weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.

Bene  t:  The  creatures  secondary  attacks  with  natural

weapons take only a 2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, the creatures secondary attacks

with natural weapons take a 5 penalty.

POWERFUL CHARGE

A creature that has this feat can charge with extra force.

Prerequisites: Medium or larger, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: When the creature charges, if its melee attack

hits,  it  deals  an  extra  1d8  points  of  damage  (if  it  is  of

Medium size). For Large creatures, the extra damage is

2d6 points; for Huge, 3d6; for Gargantuan, 4d6; and for

Colossal, 6d6.

This feat works only when the creature makes a charge. It

does not work when the creature is mounted. If the creature

has the ability to make multiple attacks after a charge, it can

apply this extra damage to only one of those attacks.

Special: A  ghter can select Powerful Charge as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY

A creature that has this feat can employ a spell-like ability

with a moments thought.

Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at caster level 10th or

higher.

Benefit: The creature can use one of its spell-like abili-

ties as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day

(or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice

per day).

Using  a  quickened  spell-like  ability  is  a  swift  action

that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The crea-

ture can perform another actionincluding the use of

another spell-like abilityin the same round that it uses

a quickened spell-like ability. The creature can use only

one quickened spell-like ability per round.

The creature can select a only spell-like ability duplicat-

ing a spell of a level less than or equal to half its caster level

(round down) minus 4. For a summary, see the table below.

For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a

15th-level caster can quicken only spell-like abilities that

duplicate spells of 3rd level or lower. In addition, a spell-like

ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time of greater

than 1 full round cannot be quickened.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a

standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity unless

otherwise noted.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its

spell-like abilities.

SNATCH

The creature can grab opponents much smaller than it and

hold them in its mouth or claw.

Prerequisite: Size Huge or larger.

Bene  t: The creature can choose to start a grapple when it

hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the improved

grab special attack. If the creature gets a hold on an opponent

three or more sizes smaller, it can squeeze each round for bite

or claw damage. A snatched opponent held in the creatures

mouth  is  not  allowed  a  Re ex  save  against  the  creatures

breath weapon (if any).

The creature can drop an opponent it has snatched as a

free action or use a standard action to  ing it aside. A  ung

opponent travels 1d610 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage

per 10 feet traveled. If the creature  ings a snatched oppo-

nent when  ying, the opponent takes this amount or falling

damage, whichever is greater.

WINGOVER

The creature can change direction quickly while  ying.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Bene  t: A  ying creature that has this feat can change

direction quickly once each round as a free action. This feat

allows it to turn up to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuver-

ability, in addition to any other turns it is normally allowed. A

creature cannot gain altitude during a round when it executes

a wingover, but it can dive.

The  change  of  direction  consumes  10  feet  of  flying

movement.

Glossary

This section provides de nitions and descriptions of mon-

ster characteristics. If you come across a term earlier in

this book that youre not familiar with, this is the place

to find out more. These entries are presented as general

rules that might have exceptions when applied to a specific

creatureif a specific creatures entry differs from the

rules provided in this section, that creatures ability is as

an exception to the general rule. Statistical specifics of a

particular creatures abilities, such as save DCs, are defined

in that creatures entry.

Aberration Type: An aberration has a bizarre anatomy,

strange  abilities,  an  alien  mindset,  or  any  combination  of

the three.

Features: An aberration has the following features.

d8 Hit Dice; good Will saves.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An aberration possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Pro cient  with  its  natural  weapons.  If  humanoid  in

form, pro cient with all simple weapons and any weapon it

is described as using.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Aberrations are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.

Ability  Damage  (Su):  This  special  attack  damages  a

speci c ability score. If an attack that causes ability damage

scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated amount of

damageif the damage is expressed as a die range, roll twice

the normal amount of dice. Ability damage returns at the rate

of 1 point per day per affected ability.

Ability Drain (Su): This special attack permanently

reduces a speci c ability score. If an attack that causes abil-

ity drain scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated

amount  of  damageif  the  damage  is  expressed  as  a  die

range, roll twice the normal amount of dice. A draining

creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit)

whenever it drains an ability score, no matter how many

points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this way

last for up to 1 hour.

Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2  draining  creatures  racial  HD +  draining  creatures

Cha modifier). If no saving throw is mentioned, none is

allowed.

Air Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals

and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane

Air. Air creatures have  y speeds and usually have perfect

maneuverability (see Movement Modes, page 215).

Alternate Form (Su): A creature that has this special

quality  has  the  ability  to  assume  one  or  more  specific

alternate forms. A true seeing spell or ability reveals the

creatures natural form. A creature using alternate form

reverts to its natural form when killed, but separated body

parts retain their shape. A creature cannot use alternate

form to take the form of a creature that has a template.

Assuming an alternate form results in the following changes

to the creature:

The creature retains the type and subtype of its original

form. It gains the size of its new form.

The  creature  loses  the  natural  weapons,  natural

armor, and movement modes of its original form, as well

as any extraordinary special attacks of its original form

not derived from class levels (such as the barbarians rage

class feature).

The creature gains the natural weapons, natural armor,

movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its

new form.

The creature retains the special qualities of its original

form. It does not gain any special qualities of its new form.

The creature retains the spell-like abilities and super-

natural  attacks  of  its  old  form  (except  for  breath  weapons

and gaze attacks). It does not gain the spell-like abilities or

supernatural attacks of its new form.

The creature gains the physical ability scores (Str, Dex,

Con) of its new form. It retains the mental ability scores (Int,

Wis, Cha) of its original form.

The creature retains its HD, hit points, base attack bonus,

and base save bonuses, although its total attack and save

modi ers might change due to a change in ability scores.

The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its

original form, although it must be able to speak intelligibly to

cast spells with verbal components and it must have human-

like hands to cast spells with somatic components.

The creature is effectively camou aged as a creature of

its new form, and it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if

it uses this ability to create a disguise.

Any gear worn or carried by the creature that cant be

worn or carried in its new form instead falls to the ground

in its space. If the creature changes size, any gear it wears

or  carries  that  can  be  worn  or  carried  in  its  new  form

changes size to match the new size. (Nonhumanoid-shaped

creatures cant wear armor designed for humanoid-shaped

creatures, and vice versa.) Gear returns to normal size

if dropped.

Aligned Strike (Su): Attacks made by a creature that

has this ability are treated as aligned for the purpose of

overcoming  damage  reduction.  When  it  applies,  aligned

strike appears in the Atk Options line of a creatures statistics

block,  followed  in  parentheses  by  a  speci c  alignment  or

alignments (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful).

Alignment: This line in a monster entry gives the align-

ment that the creature is most likely to have. Entries that

detail a general creature, rather than a speci c individual,

include a quali er that indicates how broadly that alignment

applies to all monsters of that kind.

Always: The creature is born with the indicated alignment.

The creature might have a hereditary predisposition to the

alignment  or  come  from  a  plane  that  predetermines  it.  It

is  possible  for  individuals  to  change  alignment,  but  such

individuals are either unique or rare exceptions.

Usually: More than 50% of these creatures have the given

alignment. This could be due to strong cultural in uences,

or it might be a legacy of the creatures origin.

Often: The creature tends toward the given alignment,

either by nature or nurture, but not strongly. A plurality

(4050%) of individuals has the given alignment, but excep-

tions are common.

Animal Type: An animal is a living, nonhuman creature,

usually a vertebrate with no magical abilities and no innate

capacity for language or culture.

Features: An animal has the following features.

d8 Hit Dice; good Fortitude and Re ex saves.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An animal possesses the following traits.

Low-light vision.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only. A noncomba-

tive herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary attack.

Such attacks are made with a 5 penalty on the creatures

attack rolls, and the animal receives only 1/2 its Strength

modi er as a damage adjustment.

Pro cient with no armor unless trained for war.

Intelligence  score  of  1  or  2  (no  creature  that  has  an

Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).

Alignment: Always neutral.

Treasure: None.

Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.

Aquatic  Subtype:  These  creatures  have  swim  speeds

and thus can move in water without making Swim checks.

An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also

breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality.

Augmented Subtype: A creature receives this subtype

whenever something happens to change its original type.

Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born

with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an

acquired template. The augmented subtype is paired with

the  creatures  original  type.  For  example,  a  wizards  raven

familiar is a magical beast (augmented animal). A creature

that has the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its

current type, but the features of its original type. For example,

a wizards raven familiar has an animals features and the traits

of a magical beast.

Baatezu Subtype: Many devils belong to the race of evil

outsiders known as the baatezu.

Traits: A baatezu has the following traits.

See in Darkness (Su): All baatezu can see perfectly

in  darkness  of  any  kind,  even  that  created  by  a  deeper

darkness spell.

Telepathy.

Immunity to  re and poison.

Resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.

Summon  (Sp):  Baatezu  share  the  ability  to  summon

others of their kind (the success chance and type of baatezu

summoned are noted in each monster description).

Blind: A blind creature has no visual senses and is thusly

immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other

attack forms that rely on sight. Such creatures usually have

blindsense or blindsight.

Blindsense (Ex): Using nonvisual senses, such as acute

smell  or  hearing,  a  creature  that  has  blindsense  notices

creatures it cannot see. The creature usually does not need

to make Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of a

creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it

has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature

cannot see still has total concealment against the creature

that has blindsense, and the creature still has the normal

miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.

Visibility still affects the movement of a creature that has

blindsense. A creature that has blindsense is still denied

its  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  against  attacks  from

creatures it cannot see.

Blindsight  (Ex):  This  ability  is  similar  to  blindsense,

but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such

as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or

echolocation, a creature that has blindsight maneuvers and

 ghts as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness,

and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the

creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to

discern that creature or object. The abilitys range is speci-

 ed in the creatures descriptive text. The creature usually

does  not  need  to  make  Spot  or  Listen  checks  to  notice

creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted

otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need

do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however,

O

207

must be triggered as a free action. If a creature must trig-

ger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the bene ts of

blindsight only during its turn.

Breath Weapon (Su): A breath weapon attack usually

deals damage and is often based on some type of energy

(such as  re). Such breath weapons allow a Re ex save for

half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creatures racial HD +

breathing creatures Con modi er; the exact DC is given in

the creatures descriptive text). A creature is immune to its

own breath weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath

weapons allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a

Re ex save.

Chaotic  Subtype:  A  subtype  usually  applied  only  to

outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most

creatures  that  have  this  subtype  also  have  chaotic  align-

ments; however, if their alignments change they still retain

the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a

creature that has this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic

alignment,  no  matter  what  its  alignment  actually  is.  The

creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment.

A creature that has the chaotic subtype has the aligned strike

(chaotic) ability. It overcomes damage reduction as if its natu-

ral weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned

(see Damage Reduction).

Class Skills: Any skill in which a monster has acquired

at least one rank or in which the creature has a racial bonus

is  considered  a  class  skill  for  that  kind  of  creature.  Some

monsters, such as the true dragons, have their class skills

explicitly de ned. Other monsters class skills can be deter-

mined from their statistics blocks.

Skills shown in an entry merely because of synergy with

another skill are not class skills. For example, a banshraes

class  skills  are  Balance,  Bluff,  Climb,  Disguise,  Escape

Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Knowledge  (nature),  Listen,  Move

Silently, Perform, Spot, and Tumble. Diplomacy, Intimidate,

Survival,  and  Use  Rope  are  mentioned  in  the  creatures

statistics block because of the synergy bene t granted by

other skills. The only exceptions to this rule are creatures

that have a climb speed, which have Climb as a class skill,

and creatures that have a swim speed, which have Swim as

a class skill.

Cold Subtype: A creature that has the cold subtype has

immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to  re, which means

it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

 re, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the

save is a success or failure.

Constrict (Ex): A creature that has this special attack

can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after

making a successful grapple check. The amount of damage

is given in the creatures entry. If the creature also has the

improved grab ability (see page 212), it deals constriction

damage in addition to damage dealt by the weapon used

to grab.

Construct  Type:  A  construct  is  an  animated  object  or

arti cially constructed creature.

Features: A construct has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice; no good saving throws.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit  Die,  with  quadruple  skill  points  for  the   rst  Hit  Die,

if  the  construct  has  an  Intelligence  score.  However,  most

constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: A construct possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Low-light vision.

Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a con-

struct is hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based

on size: 10 for a Small construct, 20 for a Medium, 30 for

a Large, 40 for a Huge, 60 for a Gargantuan, and 80 for a

Colossal construct.

Cannot heal damage on its own, but it can often be

repaired by exposure to a certain kind of effect or through

the use of the Craft Construct feat (MM 303). A construct

with  the  fast  healing  special  quality  still  benefits  from

that quality.

Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, critical hits,

death effects, disease, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, mind-

affecting spells and abilities, necromancy effects, nonlethal

damage, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save,

unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless.

Not at risk of death from massive damage (PH 145).

Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or

fewer.

Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised

or resurrected.

No Constitution score.

Proficient  with  its  natural  weapons  only,  unless

humanoid in form, in which case pro cient with any weapon

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with no armor.

Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex  or  Su):  A  creature  that  has

damage reduction (DR) ignores some of the damage from

weapons and natural attacks that dont meet certain cri-

teria. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces

off  harmlessly,  and  the  attacker  knows  the  attack  was

ineffective. Damage reduction doesnt reduce the damage

from energy attacks, spells, spell-like abilities, and super-

natural abilities.

The  DR  entry  starts  by  denoting  amount  of  damage

ignored (X in the following examples, but usually 5 to

15  points)  followed  by  a  slash  and  the  type  of  damage,

material, or magic that overcomes the ability. If a weapon

or attack doesnt have the indicated quality or qualities,

that attack has its damage reduced by the number before

the slash to a minimum of 0 points of damage. Possible

ways to overcome DR include:

Aligned: Some damage reduction can be overcome by

chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons, such as

with  the  entry  DR  X/lawful.  Other  than  the  inherent

abilities of some magic weapons, an aligned weapon can

be  acquired  through  an  align  weapon  spell  or  from  an

alignment subtype (see Aligned Strike). Damage reduc-

tion  that  can  be  overcome  only  by  aligned  weapons  is

supernatural (Su).

Damage Type: Bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage

can overcome some damage reduction. A humble club, which

deals bludgeoning damage, overcomes DR X/bludgeoning.

This type of DR is extraordinary (Ex).

Epic: Epic weapons are arms that have a magical enhance-

ment bonus of +6 or higher, and such weapons are required

to harm the mightiest monsters. If a creature has DR X/

epic, it also has the epic strike ability (see page 210). Damage

reduction that can be overcome only by epic weapons is

supernatural.

Magic:  When  magic  can  overcome  a  creatures  damage

reduction, a weapon with a +1 or higher magical enhance-

ment bonus is required. If a creature has DR X/magic, it

also has the magic strike ability (see page 214). This type

of DR is supernatural.

Nothing: When a DR entry has a dash after the slash (DR

X/), no weapon can overcome it. Insurmountable damage

reduction is extraordinary.

Special Material: A special material, such as adamantine,

alchemical silver, or cold iron, is required to overcome other

forms of damage reduction. For example, potent fey have DR

that can be overcome by cold iron (DR X/cold iron). Damage

reduction that is overcome only by adamantine is extraordi-

nary, but DR that can be overcome only by cold iron or silver

is supernatural.

Special Situations: A few forms of damage reduction can be

overcome by more than one factor. Such DR appears with the

word or between qualities, as in DR X/cold iron or good. A

cold iron weapon or a good-aligned weapon can overcome

such DR.

Other forms of damage reduction can be overcome only

by attacks that combine qualities. Such DR appears with the

word and between qualities, as in DR X/silver and good.

A weapon that falls into one category but not the other is

of no help in overcoming such damage reductionit must

have all the indicated qualities to be effective.

In  these  cases,  the  damage  reduction  is  supernatural  if

any quality required to overcome it is considered part of a

supernatural form of DR. Otherwise, the damage reduction

is extraordinary.

Darkvision (Ex): A creature that has this special quality

can see in the dark, out to a distance given in the creatures

entry. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like  normal  sight,  and  a  creature  that  has  darkvision  can

function just  ne with no light at all.

Dragon Type: A dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually

winged, with magical or unusual abilities.

Features: A dragon has the following features.

12-sided  Hit  Dice;  good  Fortitude,  Re ex,  and  Will

saves.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Skill points equal to (6 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A dragon possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Low-light vision.

Immunity to sleep effects and paralysis effects.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only unless human-

oid in form, in which case pro cient with all simple weapons

and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with no armor.

Dragons eat, sleep, and breathe.

Dragons qualify for classes, prestige classes, racial

substitution levels, feats, powers, and spells that require the

dragonblood subtype.

Dragonblood Subtype: A creature that has the dragon-

blood subtype has a strong affinity to dragonswhich

means that spells, effects, powers, and abilities that affect

or  target  dragons  also  affect  it.  The  subtype  qualifies

a  creature  to  use  magic  items  normally  usable  only  by

dragons, and it qualifies the creature to take feats that have

the subtype as a prerequisite. The dragonblood subtype

also  makes  creatures  subject  to  harmful  effects  that

affect dragons.

The dragonblood subtype does not confer the dragon type

or any traits associated with that type. For instance, it does

not give a creature frightful presence.

If a creature that has the dragonblood subtype somehow

acquires the dragon type, it loses this subtype.

Earth Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals

and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of

Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and most

earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.

Effective Character Level (ECL): This number repre-

sents a creatures overall power relative to that of a character

from the Players Handbook. A creature that has an ECL of

10 is roughly equivalent to a 10th-level character. A creatures

ECL is the sum of its Hit Dice (including class levels) and

level adjustment. For instance, a kuo-toa exalted whip has

10 HD and a +4 level adjustment. It is the equivalent of a

14th-level character.

Elemental Type: An elemental is a being composed

of one of the four classical elements: air, earth, fire, or

water.

Features: An elemental has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice; good saves depend on the element:

Fortitude (earth, water) or Re ex (air,  re).

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill  points  equal  to  (2 +  Int  modifier,  minimum

1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first

Hit Die.

Traits: An elemental possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity to critical hits, paralysis, poison, sleep effects,

and stunning.

Not subject to  anking.

Unlike most other living creatures, an elementals

soul and body form one unit. When an elemental is slain,

no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies,

such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection, dont work

on an elemental. It takes a different magical effect, such as

limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection to restore a slain

elemental to life.

Pro cient with natural weapons only, unless humanoid

in form, in which case pro cient with all simple weapons

and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter

types.  Elementals  not  indicated  as  wearing  armor  are  not

pro cient with armor. Elementals are pro cient with shields

if they are pro cient with any form of armor.

Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe.

Energy Drain (Su): This attack saps a living opponents

vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or

ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows

one or more negative levels. If an attack that includes an

energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the given

amount. A draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points

(10  on  a  critical  hit)  for  each  negative  level  it  bestows

on an opponent. These temporary hit points last for up

to 1 hour.

An affected opponent takes a 1 penalty on all skill checks

and ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses

one effective level or Hit Die (whenever is used in a die roll

or calculation) for each negative level. A spellcaster loses one

spell slot of the highest level of spells she can cast and (if

applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss persists

until the negative level is removed.

Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or

until they are removed with a spell, such as restoration.

If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have

passed, the affected creature must make a Fortitude save

(DC 10 +  1/2  draining  creatures  racial  HD +  draining

creatures Cha modifier). On a success, the negative level

goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the

negative level goes away, but the creatures level is also

reduced by one. A separate saving throw is required for

each negative level.

Epic Strike (Su): Natural weapon attacks made by a

creature  that  has  this  ability  are  treated  as  epic  for  the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction. When it applies,

epic strike appears in the Atk Options line of a creatures

statistics block.

Evil Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders

native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also

called  ends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have

evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they

still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment

affects a creature that has this subtype as if the creature has an

evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The

creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment.

A creature that has the evil subtype has the aligned strike

(evil) ability. It overcomes damage reduction as if its natural

weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see

Damage Reduction).

Extraordinary (Ex) Abilities: Extraordinary abilities

are nonmagical, dont become ineffective in an antimagic

field, and are not subject to any effect that disrupts magic.

Using an extraordinary ability is a free action unless other-

wise noted.

Extraplanar  Subtype:  A  subtype  applied  to  any

creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane,

including the Material Plane. A creature that travels the

planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to

plane. However, no creature has the extraplanar subtype

while on a transitive plane (the Astral Plane, the Ethereal

Plane, and the Plane of Shadow). This book assumes that

encounters take place on the Material Plane, and every

creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has

the extraplanar subtype. Such creatures lose this subtype

while on their home plane, just as creatures native to the

Material  Plane  gain  the  extraplanar  subtype  while  on

other planes.

Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane

mentioned in its entry. These home planes are taken from the

Great Wheel cosmology (DMG 147167). If your campaign

uses a different cosmology, you must assign different home

planes to extraplanar creatures.

Fast Healing (Ex): A creature that has the fast healing

special quality regains hit points at an exceptionally fast

rate, usually 1 or more hit points per round. Except as noted

here, fast healing is like natural healing (PH 146). Fast heal-

ing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or

suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to regrow lost

body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost

body parts to be reattached.

Favored  Class:  A  monster  that  takes  levels  in  a  class

(or more than one class) has a favored class, just as player

characters do. In addition, a monsters racial Hit Dice also

count as a favored class. If the monster becomes a multiclass

character, neither its favored class nor its racial Hit Dice

count  when  determining  whether  the  creature  takes  an

experience point penalty.

Fear (Su or Sp): Fear attacks can have various effects. If

a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 fearsome creatures racial HD + creatures Cha modi er).

All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.

Fear Aura (Su): The use of this ability is a free action. The

aura can freeze an opponent or function like the fear spell,

among other effects. A fear aura is an area effect.

Fear Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su): These effects usually work

like the fear spell.

Fey Type: A fey is a creature that has supernatural abilities

and connections to nature or to some other force or place.

Fey are usually human-shaped.

Features: A fey has the following features.

6-sided Hit Dice; good Re ex and Will saves.

Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).

Skill points equal to (6 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A fey possesses the following traits.

Low-light vision.

Pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any  weapons

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter

types. Fey not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Fey are pro cient with shields if they are pro -

cient with any form of armor.

Fey eat, sleep, and breathe.

Fire  Subtype:  A  creature  that  has  the   re  subtype  has

immunity to  re. It has vulnerability to cold, which means

it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if

the save is a success or failure.

Flight (Ex or Su): A creature that has this ability can

cease  or  resume  flight  as  a  free  action.  If  the  ability  is

supernatural,  it becomes ineffective in an antimagic  eld,

and the creature loses its ability to fly for as long as the

antimagic effect persists.

Frightful Presence (Ex): This special attack makes a

creatures presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect when

the creature performs some sort of dramatic action, such

as  charging,  attacking,  or  snarling.  Opponents  within

range who witness the action might become frightened

or shaken. The range is usually 30 feet, and the duration

is usually 5d6 rounds.

This ability affects only those opponents with fewer Hit

Dice or levels than the creature has. An affected opponent

can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 +

1/2  frightful  creatures  racial  HD +  frightful  creatures

Cha modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the saving

throw is immune to that same creatures frightful pres-

ence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting

fear effect.

Gaze (Su): A gaze special attack takes effect when oppo-

nents look at the creatures eyes. The attack can have almost

any sort of effectpetri cation, death, charm, and so on.

The typical range is 30 feet.

The type of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is

usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creatures

racial  HD +  gazing  creatures  Cha  modi er).  A  successful

saving throw negates the effect. A monsters gaze attack is

described in abbreviated form in its description.

Gaze  attacks  can  affect  ethereal  opponents.  A  creature

is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind. Allies of a

creature  that  has  a  gaze  attack  might  be  affected.  All  the

creatures allies are considered to be averting their eyes from

the creature that has the gaze attack (see below). The creature

also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze attack.

Passive  Gaze  Attack:  Each  opponent  within  range  of  a

gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the

beginning  of  his  or  her  turn  in  the  initiative  order.  Only

looking directly at a creature that has a gaze attack leaves an

opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make

the saving throw by not looking at the creature, using one of

two methods.

Averting  Eyes:  The  opponent  avoids  looking  at  the

creatures face, instead looking at its body, watching its

shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each

round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make

a saving throw against the gaze attack. The creature that

has the gaze attack, however, gains concealment against

that opponent.

Closing Eyes: The opponent acts in a way so it cannot see

the creature that has the gaze attack at allclosing its eyes,

turning its back, or even wearing a blindfold. The creature

that has the gaze attack gains total concealment against such

an opponent.

Active Gaze Attack: A creature that has a gaze attack can

actively gaze as a standard action by choosing a target within

range. That opponent must attempt a saving throw but can

try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for

an opponent to save against a creatures gaze twice during

the same round, once before the opponents action and once

during the creatures turn.

Giant Type: A giant is a humanoid-shaped creature of

great strength, usually of at least Large size.

Features: A giant has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice; good Fortitude saves.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A giant possesses the following traits.

Low-light vision.

Pro cient with all simple and martial weapons, as well

as any natural weapons.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Giants not described as wearing armor are not pro cient with

armor. Giants are pro cient with shields if they are pro cient

with any form of armor.

Giants eat, sleep, and breathe.

Goblinoid Subtype: Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids

who live by hunting and raiding. They all speak Goblin.

Good Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders

native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that

have this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their

alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect

that depends on alignment affects a creature that has this

subtype as if the creature has a good alignment, no matter

what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects

according to its actual alignment. A creature that has the good

subtype has the aligned strike (good) ability. It overcomes

damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons

it wields were good-aligned (see Damage Reduction).

Humanoid Type: A humanoid usually has two arms, two

legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head.

Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary

abilities,  but  most  can  speak  and  usually  have  well-devel-

oped  societies.  They  are  usually  Small  or  Medium.  Every

humanoid creature also has a subtype, such as elf, goblinoid,

or reptilian.

Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their

humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class.

Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors,

which means that they have average combat ability and poor

saving throws.

Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die (for example, gnolls

and bugbears) are the only humanoids who make use of the

features of the humanoid type.

Features: A humanoid has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class; good Re ex saves

(usually; a humanoids good save varies).

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, or

by character class.

Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits.

Proficient with all simple weapons, or by character

class.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class.

If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is

proficient with that type of armor and all lighter types.

Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Humanoids are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.

Immunity: A creature that has immunity to an effect is

never harmed (or helped) by that effect. A creature cannot

suppress an immunity to receive a bene cial effect.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a creature that has this special

attack hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite

attack),  it  deals  normal  damage  and  attempts  to  start  a

grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks  of

opportunity (see Grapple, PH 155). No initial touch attack

is required.

Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against

opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature.

The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab

to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a

20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled

itself; the creature does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC,

still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks

against other opponents.

A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the

creature also has the constrict special attack. If the creature

does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes

during  successive  rounds  automatically  deals  the  damage

indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise,

it deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in

the creatures descriptive text).

When  a  creature  gets  a  hold  after  an  improved  grab

attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can even move (pos-

sibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the

opponents weight.

Incorporeal Subtype: Some creatures are incorporeal

by nature, and others (such as those that become ghosts)

can acquire the incorporeal subtype. An incorporeal crea-

ture has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other

incorporeal  creatures,  magic  weapons  or  creatures  that

strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or

supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack

forms. Even when hit by spells (including touch spells) or

magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative

energy, force effects such as magic missile, or attacks made

with  ghost  touch  weapons).  Nondamaging  effects  affect

incorporeal creatures normally unless they require corpo-

real targets to function (such as implosion) or they create a

corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally

be unaffected by (such as web or wall of stone). Although it

is not a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal

undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not

affecting an incorporeal creature.

An incorporeal creatures attacks pass through (ignore)

natural  armor,  armor,  and  shields,  although  deflection

bonuses  and  force  effects  (such  as  mage  armor)  work

normally  against  it.  Nonmagical  attacks  made  by  an

incorporeal creature with a melee weapon have no effect

on corporeal targets, and any melee attack an incorporeal

creature makes with a magic weapon against a corporeal

target has a 50% miss chance, except for attacks it makes

with a ghost touch weapon, which are made normally (no

miss chance).

Equipment worn or carried by an incorporeal creature is

also incorporeal as long as that equipment remains in the

creatures possession. An object the creature relinquishes

loses  its  incorporeal  quality,  and  the  creature  loses  the

ability to manipulate the object. If an incorporeal creature

uses a thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, that projectile

becomes  corporeal  as  soon  as  it  is   red  and  can  affect  a

corporeal target normally (no miss chance). Magic items

possessed by an incorporeal creature work normally with

respect to their effects on the creature or on another target.

Similarly, spells cast by an incorporeal creature affect corpo-

real creatures normally.

An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus, but

it has a de ection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus

or +1, whichever is higher.

An  incorporeal  creature  cannot  pass  through  a  force

effect.  It  can  enter  or  pass  through  solid  objects,  but  it

must remain adjacent to the objects exterior. So it cannot

pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than

its own. It has an innate sense of direction, allowing it to

move at full speed even when it cannot see. Although an

incorporeal creature inside an object can sense the presence

of creatures or objects in a square adjacent to its current

location, such objects or creatures have total concealment

(50% miss chance) against its attacks as long as it remains

inside the object. To see farther from the object it is inside

and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge.

While inside a solid object, an incorporeal creature receives a

+2 bonus on Listen checks. An incorporeal creature inside an

object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside

the object, it only has cover.

An incorporeal creature can pass through and operate in

water as easily as it does in air. It cannot fall or take falling

damage. It cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can it

be tripped or grappled. In fact, it cannot take any physical

action that moves or manipulates an opponent or that foes

equipment, nor is it subject to such actions.

An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be

heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be. Further,

it  has  no  weight  and  cannot  set  off  traps  that  are  trig-

gered by weight. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity

modifier applies to its melee attacks and its ranged attacks.

Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either

ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incor-

poreal creatures.

Lawful Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsid-

ers native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures

that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however,

if  their  alignments  change,  they  still  retain  the  subtype.

Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature that

has this subtype as if the creature has a lawful alignment,

no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also

suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature

that has the lawful subtype has the aligned strike (lawful)

ability. It overcomes damage reduction as if its natural

weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned (see

Damage Reduction).

Level Adjustment: Certain monsters can used as the basis

for interesting, viable player characters. These creatures have

a level adjustment entry, which is a number that is added

to the creatures total Hit Dice to arrive at its effective

character level. A creature that has multiple special abilities

is more powerful as a player character than its Hit Dice

alone indicate. For example, a kuo-toas level adjustment +3

indicates that a 1st-level kuo-toa wizard is the equivalent

of a 3rd-level character.

Level adjustment is not the same as an adjustment to a

creatures Challenge Rating because of some special quali-

ties it possesses. Challenge Rating re ects how dif cult

an opponent is to  ght in a limited number of encounters.

Level adjustment shows how powerful a creature is as a

player character or cohort in campaign play. For instance,

a drow receives a +1 adjustment to its Challenge Rating

to  account  for  its  special  abilities,  indicating  that  its

tougher in a fight than its Hit Dice would suggest, but

its level adjustment is +2 to balance its abilities over long-

term play.

Living Construct Subtype: A living construct is a new

subtype of construct, a created being given sentience and free

will through powerful and complex creation magic. Living

constructs combine aspects of both constructs and living

creatures, as detailed below.

Features: A living construct derives its Hit Dice, base attack

bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the

class it selects.

Traits:  A  living  construct  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  has  a

Constitution score. A living construct does not gain bonus

hit  points  by  size  but  gains  (or  loses)  bonus  hit  points

through a Constitution bonus (or penalty) as with other

living creatures.

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  does  not

have low-light vision or darkvision.

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  is  not

immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease,

nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, and energy drain.

A living construct cannot heal damage naturally.

Unlike other constructs, living constructs are subject

to extra damage from critical hits, effects requiring a Forti-

tude save, death from massive damage, nonlethal damage,

stunning, ability damage, ability drain, and death effects or

necromancy effects.

Unlike other constructs, a living construct can use the

run action.

Living constructs can be affected by spells that target

living creatures as well as by those that target constructs.

Damage dealt to a living construct can be healed by a cure

light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example,

and a living construct is vulnerable to a harm spell. However,

spells from the healing subschool provide only half effect to

a living construct.

A living construct responds slightly differently from

other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A living

construct  that  has  0  hit  points  is  disabled,  just  as  a  living

creature is. He can take only a single move action or standard

action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk

further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater

than 10, a living construct is inert. He is unconscious and

helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an

inert  living  construct  does  not  lose  additional  hit  points

unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature

that is stable.

Can be raised or resurrected.

Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but can still

bene t from the effects of consumable spells and magic

items such as heroes feast and potions.

Does not need to sleep, but must rest for 8 hours before

preparing spells.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): A creature that has low-light

vision can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight,

torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination.

It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under

these conditions.

Magical  Beast  Type:  Magical  beasts  are  similar  to

animals but can have Intelligence scores higher than 2.

Magical beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary

abilities, but sometimes are merely bizarre in appearance

or habits.

Features: A magical beast has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice; good Fortitude and Re ex saves.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A magical beast possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Low-light vision.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Magical beasts eat, sleep, and breathe.

Magic Strike (Su): Natural weapon attacks made by a

creature that has this ability are treated as magic for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction. When it applies,

magic strike appears in the Atk Options line of a creatures

statistics block.

Manufactured  Weapons:  Some  monsters  employ

manufactured weapons when they attack. In essence, a

manufactured weapon is any weapon that is not intrinsic

or natural to the creature, including natural items such as

rocks and logs. Creatures that use manufactured weapons

follow the same rules as characters, including those for

additional attacks from a high base attack bonus and two-

weapon  ghting penalties.

Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manu-

factured weapons when they make a full attack. When they

do so, the manufactured weapon attack is considered the

primary attack unless the creatures description indicates

otherwise, and any natural weapons the creature also uses

are considered secondary natural attacks. These secondary

attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking

with an off-hand weapon does, but they take the usual 5

penalty (or 2 with the Multiattack feat) for such attacks,

even if the natural weapon used is normally the creatures

primary natural weapon.

Monstrous Humanoid Type: Monstrous humanoids are

similar  to  humanoids,  but  with  monstrous  or  animalistic

features. They often have magical abilities as well.

Features:  A  monstrous  humanoid  has  the  following

features.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A monstrous humanoid possesses the following

traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Pro cient with all simple weapons and any weapons

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter

types.  Monstrous  humanoids  not  indicated  as  wearing

armor are not pro cient with armor. Monstrous humanoids

are pro cient with shields if they are pro cient with any

form of armor.

Monstrous humanoids eat, sleep, and breathe.

Movement  Modes:  Creatures  can  have  modes  of

movement  other  than  walking  and  running.  These  are

natural, not magical, unless specifically noted in a mon-

ster description.

Burrow: A creature that has a burrow speed can tunnel

through dirt, but not through rock unless the descrip-

tive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run

while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave

behind tunnels other creatures can use, either because

the material they tunnel through fills in behind them

or  because  they  do  not  actually  dislocate  any  material

when burrowing.

Climb: A creature that has a climb speed has a +8 racial

bonus on Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb

check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than

0, but it can choose to take 10 (see Checks without Rolls,

PH 65), even if rushed or threatened when climbing. The

creature  climbs  at  the  given  speed  when  climbing.  If  it

chooses an accelerated climb (see the Climb skill, PH 69), it

moves at double the given climb speed or its base land speed,

whichever is lower, and makes a single Climb check at a 5

penalty. Creatures cannot run when climbing. A creature

that has a climb speed retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor

Class (if any) when climbing, and opponents get no special

bonus on their attacks against it.

Fly: A creature that has a  y speed can move through the

air at the indicated speed if carrying no more than a light

load; see Carrying Capacity, PH 161. Medium armor does not

necessarily constitute a medium load. All  y speeds include

a parenthetical note indicating maneuverability (DMG 20),

as follows:

Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial

maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a

human moves over smooth ground.

Good: The creature is agile in the air (like a house y or

a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as readily as

those with perfect maneuverability.

Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small

bird.

Poor: The creature  ies as well as a large bird.

Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.

A creature that  ies can make dive attacks. A dive attack

works like a charge, but the diving creature must move a

minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make

only claw or talon attacks, but these deal double damage. A

creature can use the run action when  ying, provided it  ies

in a straight line.

Swim: A creature that has a swim speed can move through

water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has

a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special

action or avoid a hazard. The creature can choose to take

10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. The

creature can use the run action when swimming, provided

it swims in a straight line.

Native  Subtype:  Creatures  that  have  this  subtype  are

outsiders native to the Material Plane. Such creatures have

mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane,

and they can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as

other living creatures can be.

Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and

sleep.

Natural Weapons: Natural weapons are weapons that are

physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee

attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise, it threatens

any space it can reach.

Creatures  do  not  receive  additional  attacks  from  a

high base attack bonus when using natural weapons. The

number  of  attacks  a  creature  can  make  with  its  natural

weapons depends on the type of the attacka creature can

make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one

gore attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although

Large creatures that have arms or armlike limbs can make a

slam attack with each arm). Refer to the individual monster

descriptions.

Unless  otherwise  noted,  a  natural  weapon  threatens  a

critical hit on a natural attack roll of 20.

When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one

of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary

weapon. All the creatures remaining natural weapons are

secondary.

The  primary  weapon  is  presented   rst  in  the  creatures

Melee or Ranged entry. A creatures primary natural weapon

is its most effective natural attack, and the creature uses its

full attack bonus with that weapon. Attacks with secondary

natural attacks are made with a 5 penalty on the attack roll,

no matter how many the creature has. (Creatures that have

the  Multiattack  feat  take  only  a  2  penalty  on  secondary

attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes

G

a single attack with the secondary attack as part of the attack

action or as an attack of opportunity. A creature applies half

of its Strength bonus (if any) to damage dealt by a secondary

attack, even when the secondary attack is used alone as a

single attack.

Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The

most common are summarized below.

Bite: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing,

slashing, and bludgeoning damage.

Claw or Talon: The creature rips with a sharp appendage,

dealing piercing and slashing damage.

Gore: The creature spears the opponent with an antler,

horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.

Slap or Slam: The creature batters opponents with an

appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.

Sting: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing

damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in

addition to hit point damage.

Tentacle: The creature  ails at opponents with a powerful

tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing)

damage.

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores.

These creatures do not have an ability score of 0they lack

the ability altogether. The modi er for a nonability is +0.

Other effects of nonabilities are detailed below.

Strength:  Any  creature  that  can  physically  manipulate

other objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A creature

that has no Strength score cant exert force, usually because

it  has  no  physical  body  or  because  it  doesnt  move.  The

creature automatically fails Strength checks. If the creature

can attack, it applies its Dexterity modi er to its base attack

bonus instead of a Strength modi er.

Dexterity: Any creature that can move has at least 1 point of

Dexterity. A creature that has no Dexterity score cant move.

If it can perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies

its Intelligence modi er to initiative checks instead of its

Dexterity modi er. The creature automatically fails Re ex

saves and Dexterity checks.

Constitution:  Any  living  creature  has  at  least  1  point

of Constitution. A creature that has no Constitution has

no  body  or  no  metabolism.  It  is  immune  to  any  effect

that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  the  effect  works

on objects or is harmless. The creature is also immune

to  ability  damage,  ability  drain,  and  energy  drain,  and

automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature that

has no Constitution cannot tire and is thusly immune to

fatigue and exhaustion.

Intelligence: Any creature that can think, learn, or remem-

ber has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A creature that has

no Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating

on simple instincts or programmed instructions. Such a

creature is immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities

and automatically fails Intelligence checks.

Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although

they can have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.

Wisdom: Any creature that can perceive its environment

in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom. Anything with

no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Only objects

have no Wisdom score, and an object that has no Wisdom

score also has no Charisma score.

Charisma: Any creature capable of telling the difference

between itself and other creatures and objects has at least

1  point  of  Charisma.  Only  objects  have  no  Charisma

score, and an object that has no Charisma score also has

no Wisdom score.

Obyrith  Subtype:  A  number  of  demons  belong  to  the

primeval race of evil outsiders known as the obyriths.

Traits: An obyrith has the following traits.

True Seeing (Su): An obyrith is under the constant

effect  of  true  seeing,  as  the  spell.  This  effect  cannot  be

dispelled.

Telepathy.

Fast Healing (Ex): All obyriths have fast healing in an

amount indicated in each creatures entry.

Immunity  to  poison  and  mind-affecting  spells  and

abilities.

Resistance  to  acid  10,  cold  10,  electricity  10,  and

fire 10.

Form of Madness (Su): Obyriths are so noxious and

horrific that their presence produces madness. When an

obyrith comes within 60 feet of a creature, that creature

must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the obyriths HD +

its Cha modi er) or fall victim to a form of permanent insan-

ity as indicated in the speci c obyriths description. The

insanity is permanent until cured by greater restoration, heal,

miracle, or wish. A creature that successfully saves cannot be

affected again by that same obyriths form for 24 hours, and

a creature that fails can only be affected once until cured.

Chaotic evil outsiders are immune to this ability. This is a

mind-affecting ability.

Ooze Type: An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature,

usually mindless.

Features: An ooze has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice; no good saving throws.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the ooze has an Intelligence score. However, most oozes are

mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: An ooze possesses the following traits.

Blind.

Blindsight to a range indicated in the creatures entry.

Immunity to critical hits, paralysis, poison, sleep effects,

polymorph, and stunning.

Not subject to  anking.

Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to

objects. In such a case, the amount of damage is equal to

10 + 1/2 oozes HD + oozes Con modifier per full round

of contact.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Mindless: Oozes have no Intelligence score, along with

the traits associated with that nonability.

Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.

Outsider Type: An outsider is a creature at least partially

composed of the essence of some plane other than the Mate-

rial Plane. Some creatures start out as with another type and

become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state

of spiritual existence.

Features: An outsider has the following features.

8-sided  Hit  Dice;  good  Fortitude,  Re ex,  and  Will

saves.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Skill points equal to (8 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An outsider possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Unlike most other living creatures, an outsiders soul

and body form one unit. When an outsider is slain, no soul

is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such

as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection, dont work on an

outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited

wish,  wish,  miracle,  or  true  resurrection  to  restore  a  slain

outsider to life. Outsiders that have the native subtype are

exceptions to this rule.

Pro cient with all simple and martial weapons and any

weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Outsiders are pro cient with shields if they are

pro cient with any form of armor.

Outsiders breathe, but only native outsiders need to eat

and sleep.

Paralysis  (Ex  or  Su):  This  special  attack  renders  the

victim unable to take physical action. Paralyzed creatures

cannot  move,  speak,  or  take  any  physical  actions.  The

creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis

works on the body, and a character can usually resist it with

a Fortitude saving throw (the DC is given in the creatures

description). Unlike hold person and similar effects, a paraly-

sis effect does not allow a new save each round. A winged

creature   ying  in  the  air  at  the  time  that  it  is  paralyzed

cannot  ap its wings and falls. A swimmer cant swim and

might drown.

Plant Type: This type comprises creatures composed of

vegetable  matter  that  have  Wisdom  and  Charisma  scores.

Plants  that  lack  Wisdom  and  Charisma  scores  are  objects

even though they are alive.

Features: A plant creature has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice; good Fortitude saves.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die,

if the plant creature has an Intelligence score. However,

some plant creatures are mindless and gain no skill points

or feats.

Traits: A plant creature possesses the following traits.

Low-light vision.

Immunity to critical hits, mind-affecting spells and

abilities, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, and

stunning.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Plants breathe and eat, but do not sleep.

Poison (Ex): Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as

ability damage or some other effect, to the opponent on a

failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another saving

throw is required 1 minute later, regardless of the  rst saves

result, to avoid secondary damage. A creatures descriptive

text provides the details.

A creature that has a poison attack is immune to its own

poison and the poison of others of its kind.

The Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to

10 + 1/2 poisoning creatures racial HD + poisoning creatures

Con modi er. A successful save negates the damage.

Pounce (Ex): When a creature that has this special attack

charges, it can still make a full attack, including rake attacks

for creatures that have the rake ability.

Powerful  Charge  (Ex):  When  a  creature  that  has

this special attack makes a charge, its attack deals extra

damage in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of

a charge.

Psionics (Sp): These are spell-like abilities that a creature

generates with the power of its mind. Psionic abilities are

usually usable at will.

Racial Hit Dice: These are Hit Dice a monster has by

virtue of what type of creature it is. Hit Dice gained from

taking class levels are not racial Hit Dice. For example, the

kuo-toa monitor described in this book is a 6 HD creature

because of its four levels of monk, but it has 2 racial Hit

Dice (the same number as a typical kuo-toa without any

class levels).

Rake (Ex): A creature that has this special attack gains

extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe. Normally, a

monster can attack with only one of its natural weapons

when grappling, but a creature that has the rake ability

usually gains two additional claw attacks that it can use

only against a grappled foe. Rake attacks are not subject to

the usual 4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon

in a grapple.

A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grap-

pling to use its rakeit cant begin a grapple and rake in the

same turn.

Ray (Su or Sp): This form of special attack works like a

ranged attack (see Aiming a Spell, PH 175). Hitting with a

ray attack requires a successful ranged touch attack roll,

ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield and using the

creatures ranged attack bonus. Ray attacks have no range

increment.

Regeneration (Ex): Damage dealt to creature that has

this ability is treated as nonlethal damage. The creature

heals nonlethal damage at a fixed rate per round, as given

in its entryfor example, a creature that has regenera-

tion 5 recovers 5 points of nonlethal damage per round.

Certain  attack  forms,  typically  fire  and  acid,  deal  a

regenerating creature lethal damage, which regeneration

cant heal.

A  regenerating  creature  that  has  been  rendered  uncon-

scious through nonlethal damage can be killed with a coup

de grace (PH 153). If the attack used to deliver a coup de grace

is of a type that regeneration converts to nonlethal damage,

the coup de grace fails to kill the regenerating creature.

Attack forms that dont deal hit point damage ignore

regeneration. Regeneration does not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.

Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their

bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts. Severed

parts that are not reattached die and wither normally.

A creature must have a Constitution score to have the

regeneration ability.

Rend (Ex): If a creature that has this special attack hits with

the speci ed natural attack, it latches onto the opponents

body and tears the  esh. The rend attack deals damage equal

to that dealt by the creatures natural attack + 1-1/2 times its

Str modi er.

Reptilian Subtype: These creatures are scaly and usually

cold-blooded. The reptilian subtype is used only to describe

a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that

are truly reptiles.

indicated type each time it takes damage of that type. The

entry indicates the amount and type of damage ignored. For

example, Dalmosh has resistance to  re 10, so he ignores the

 rst 10 points of  re damage dealt to him anytime he takes

 re damage.

Scent (Ex): This special quality allows a creature to detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by

sense of smell. Creatures that have the scent ability can

identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by

sense  of  smell.  If  the  opponent  is  upwind,  the  range

increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong

scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected

at  twice  those  ranges.  Overpowering  scents,  such  as

skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple

normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of

the source is not revealedonly its presence somewhere

within range. The creature can take a move action to note

the direction of the scent. Whenever the creature comes

within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints that

sources location.

A creature that has the Track feat and the scent ability can

follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom or Survival check

to  nd or follow a trail. The base DC for a fresh trail is 10,

no  matter  what  kind  of  surface  holds  the  scent.  For  each

hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability

otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat, but creatures

tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and

poor visibility.

Size: The nine size categories, in ascending order, are Fine,

Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan,

and Colossal. A creatures size provides a modi er to its

Armor Class and attack bonus, a modi er on grapple checks

it attempts, and a modi er on Hide checks. The Creature

Sizes table provides a summary of the attributes that apply

to each size category.

Sonic Attacks (Su): Unless otherwise noted, a sonic

attack follows the rules for spreads (see Aiming a Spell, PH

175). The range of the spread is measured from the creature

using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect,

deafening the subject or stopping its ears does not end the

effect. Stopping ones ears ahead of time allows opponents to

avoid having to make saving throws against mind-affecting

sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks, such as

those that deal damage. Stopping ones ears is a full-round

action and requires wax or other soundproof material to stuff

into the ears.

Resistance to Energy (Ex): A creature that has this

special quality ignores a speci ed amount of damage of the

Spell-Like (Sp) Abilities: Spell-like abilities are magical

and work like spells, though they are not spells and so have no

verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components. They go

away in an antimagic  eld and are subject to spell resistance if

the spell the ability resembles or duplicates would be subject

to spell resistance.

A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it

can be used, but one that can be used at will has no such

limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless

noted otherwise, and doing so when threatened provokes

attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentra-

tion check to use a spell-like ability defensively and avoid

provoking attacks of opportunity, just as when casting a

spell. A spell-like ability can be disrupted just as a spell can

be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor

can they be counterspelled.

For  creatures  that  have  spell-like  abilities,  a  designated

caster level de nes how dif cult it is to dispel their spell-like

effects and to de ne any level-dependent variables (such as

range and duration) the abilities might have. The creatures

caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the creature

has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the level

a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the

same name. If no caster level is speci ed, the caster level is

equal to the creatures Hit Dice.

The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 +

the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the

creatures Cha modi er.

Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work dif-

ferently when cast by characters of different classesfor

example,  true  seeing.  A  monsters  spell-like  abilities  are

presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in

question is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric,

druid, bard, paladin, and ranger, in that order.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A creature that has spell resistance

can  avoid  the  effects  of  spells  and  spell-like  abilities  that

directly affect it. To determine if a spell or spell-like ability

works against a creature that has spell resistance, the caster

must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the

result equals or exceeds the creatures spell resistance, the

spell works normally, although the creature is still allowed

a saving throw.

Spells: Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or divine

spells  just  as  a  member  of  a  spellcasting  class  can  (and

can activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are

subject to the same spellcasting rules that characters are,

except as follows.

A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide

any somatic component a spell might require by moving its

body. Such a creature still needs material components for

its  spells.  The  creature  can  cast  the  spell  by  either  touch-

ing a required component that is not in another creatures

possession or having the required component on its body.

Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the Eschew Materi-

als feat to avoid some material components.

A  spellcasting  creature  is  not  actually  a  member  of  a

class unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any class

features. For example, a creature that casts arcane spells as a

sorcerer cannot acquire a familiar. A creature that has access

to cleric spells must prepare them in the normal manner

and receives domain spells if noted, but it does not receive

domain granted powers unless it has at least one level in

the cleric class.

Summon (Sp): A creature that has the summon ability

can summon specific other creatures of its kind, as if it

were casting a summon monster spell, but it usually has

only a limited chance of success. Roll d%. On a failure,

no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures

return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has

just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability

for 1 hour.

Most creatures that have the ability to summon do not use

it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned

creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save

their own lives.

An appropriate spell level is given for each summon-

ing  ability  for  the  purpose  of  resolving  Concentration

checks and attempts to dispel the summoned creature.

Summoned monsters are part of the summoning creatures

Supernatural (Su) Abilities: Supernatural abilities are

magical and go away in an antimagic  eld, but they are not

subject to spell resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be

dispelled. Using a supernatural ability is a standard action

unless noted otherwise. Supernatural abilities might have a

use limit or be usable at will, just like spell-like abilities.

However, supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of

opportunity and never require Concentration checks. A

supernatural ability usually has an effective caster level equal

to the creatures Hit Dice.

The saving throw DC for a supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2

the creatures HD + the creatures ability modi er (usually

Charisma).

Swallow Whole (Ex): If a creature that has this special

attack begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth, it

can attempt a new grapple check. If it succeeds, it swallows

that foe, dealing normal damage for a bite. The opponent

must usually be smaller than the swallowing creature.

Being  swallowed  has  various  consequences,  depend-

ing on the creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed

opponent is considered to be grappled, but the creature

that did the swallowing is not. The swallowed opponent

can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or pierc-

ing weapon, or it can try to escape the grapple. Inside a

creature, its Armor Class is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural

armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If

the swallowed opponent escapes the grapple, it ends up

back in the attackers mouth, where it can be bitten or

swallowed again.

Swarm  Subtype:  A  swarm  is  a  collection  of  Fine,

Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single crea-

ture. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except

as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and

hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and

a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a

single creature.

A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of

nonflying  creatures)  or  a  cube  (of  flying  creatures)  10

feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component

creatures. To attack, it moves into an opponents space,

which provokes attacks of opportunity. It can occupy the

same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls over or

flies around its prey. A swarm can move through squares

occupied by enemies, and vice versa, without impediment,

although the swarm provokes attacks of opportunity if it

does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large

enough for its component creatures.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying

creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminu-

tive  creatures  consists  of  1,500  nonflying  creatures  or

5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists

of 10,000 creatures, flying or not. Swarms of nonflying

creatures include many more creatures than could nor-

mally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space,

because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together

and crawl over each other and their prey when moving

or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples

of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is

completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains

in contiguous squares.

Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no dis-

cernible  anatomy,  so  it  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits  or

flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half

damage  from  slashing  and  piercing  weapons.  A  swarm

composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to

all weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to

break up, though damage taken until that point does not

degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are

never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage.

Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed,

and they cannot grapple.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a

speci c number of creatures, including single-target spells

such  as  disintegrate,  with  the  exception  of  mind-affecting

spells and abilities if the swarm has an Intelligence score

and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage

(+50%) from area spells and area effects.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are

susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust

of wind spell. For the purpose of determining the effect

of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the

same size as its constituent creatures (see Winds, DMG

95). Wind effects deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to

a swarm per spell levelor Hit Dice of the originating

creature, in the case of effects such as an air elementals

whirlwind. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of

nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed,

and does not re-form until its hit points exceed its non-

lethal damage.

Swarm Attack: Creatures that have the swarm subtype

dont  make  standard  melee  attacks.  Instead,  they  deal

damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the

end  of  their  move,  with  no  attack  roll  needed.  Swarm

attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment

or  cover.  A  swarms  statistics  block  has  swarm  in  the

Melee entry, with no attack bonus given. The amount of

damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice: 15 HD,

1d6; 610 HD, 2d6; 1115 HD, 3d6; 1620 HD, 4d6; and 21

HD or more, 5d6.

A swarms attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarms

description states otherwise. Damage reduction suf cient

to reduce a swarm attacks damage to 0, incorporeality, and

other special abilities usually give a creature immunity or

resistance to damage from a swarm. Swarms can have special

attacks in addition to swarm damage.

Swarms  do  not  threaten  creatures,  and  they  do  not

make  attacks  of  opportunity  with  their  swarm  attack.

However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy,

as described below.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to  a

swarms  damage  that  begins  its  turn  with  a  swarm  in

its  square  is  nauseated  for  1  round.  A  Fortitude  save

(DC 10 + 1/2 swarms HD + swarms Con modifier) negates

the effect.

Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area

of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell

level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration

requires a DC 20 Concentration check.

Tanarri Subtype: A large number of demons belong to

the race of evil outsiders known as the tanarri.

Traits: A tanarri possesses the following traits.

Telepathy.

Immunity to electricity and poison.

Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and  re 10.

Summon (Sp): Tanarri share the ability to summon

others of their kind.

Telepathy (Su): A creature that has this ability can com-

municate telepathically with any other creature within a

certain range (usually 100 feet) that has a language. It is

possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathi-

cally, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with

more  than  one  creature  at  a  time  is  just  as  difficult  as

simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people

at the same time.

Trample  (Ex):  As  a  full-round  action,  a  creature  that

has this special attack can move up to twice its speed and

literally run over any opponents at least one size category

smaller than itself. The creature merely has to move over

the opponents in its path; any creature whose space is

completely covered by the trampling creatures space is

subject to the trample attack.

If a targets space is larger than 5 feet, it is considered

trampled  only  if  the  trampling  creature  moves  over  all

the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves

over only some of a targets space, the target can make an

attack of opportunity against the trampling creature at a

4  penalty.  A  trampling  creature  that  accidentally  ends

its movement in an illegal space returns to the last legal

position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if theres

a legal position thats closer.

A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creatures

slam damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modi er).

Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity,

but these take a 4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of

opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Re ex saves

to take half damage. The save DC against a creatures trample

attack  is  10 +  1/2  creatures  HD +  creatures  Str  modi er

(the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive text). A

trampling creature can deal trampling damage to each target

only once per round, no matter how many times its movement

takes it over a target creature.

Tremorsense  (Ex):  A  creature  that  has  tremorsense  is

sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically

pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the

ground.  Aquatic  creatures  that  have  tremorsense  can  also

sense the location of creatures moving through water.

Turn  Resistance  (Ex):  A  creature  that  has  this  special

quality (usually an undead) is less easily affected by clerics

or  paladins  (see  Turn  or  Rebuke  Undead, PH   159).  When

resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add

the indicated number to the creatures Hit Dice total. For

example, a forest haunt has 12 Hit Dice and +2 turn resis-

tance. Attempts to turn, rebuke, command, or bolster treat

the forest haunt as though it had 14 Hit Dice, though it is a

12 HD creature for any other purpose.

Typical  Treasure:  This  entry  in  a  monster  description

describes how much wealth a creature owns. (See DMG 5256

for details about treasure, particularly Tables 35 through

38.) Most monsters keep their treasure in their lairs, leav-

ing it behind if they travel. Intelligent creatures carry useful

portable treasure, such as magic items, with them.

Undead Type: Undead are once-living creatures animated

by spiritual or supernatural forces.

Features: An undead creature has the following features.

12-sided Hit Dice; good Will saves.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  1/2  total  Hit  Dice  (as

wizard).

Skill points equal to (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1)

per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit

Die,  if  the  undead  creature  has  an  Intelligence  score.

However,  many  undead  are  mindless  and  gain  no  skill

points or feats.

Traits: An undead creature possesses the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence

score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such as

an in ict spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing

special quality works regardless of the creatures Intel-

ligence score.

Immunity  to  ability  damage  to  its  physical  ability

scores, ability drain, critical hits, death effects, disease,

energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, mind-affecting spells

and  abilities,  nonlethal  damage,  paralysis,  poison,  sleep

effects, and stunning.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save,

unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless.

Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points

and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

with armor. Undead are pro cient with shields if they are

pro cient with any form of armor.

Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the vermin has an Intelligence score. However, most vermin

are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: Vermin possess the following traits.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all

mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Pro cient with their natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Vermin breathe, eat, and sleep.

Vulnerability to Energy: Some creatures have vulner-

ability to a certain type of energy. Such a creature takes half

again as much (+50%) damage as normal from effects that

employ that energy, regardless of whether a saving throw is

allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Vermin Type: This type includes insects, arachnids, other

arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.

Features: Vermin have the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice; good Fortitude saves.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Water Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elemen-

tals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane

of Water. Creatures that have the water subtype have swim

speeds and can move in water without making Swim checks.

A  water  creature  can  breathe  underwater  and  can  usually

breathe air as well.
