  "response": "As the group of adventurers made their way through the dark and winding forest path, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The hairs on the back of their necks stood on end, and they couldn't help but glance over their shoulders every few steps. They had heard rumors of ettins lurking in the area, two-headed giants that were known for their viciousness and unpredictability.\n\nAs they approached the site of their meeting with the cleric, they knew they were getting closer to the danger. About 30 minutes away, there was a cave off the path where six ettins were said to be lurking. The cave had an uninterrupted line of sight to the path, putting the encounter distance at 40 feet. But the conditions of the night allowed the ettins a chance to hear the PCs before they came within line of sight.\n\nThe adventurers knew they had to be careful. The ettins were being used as guards by the cleric, who had persuaded or bullied them to aid him in his cause. The creatures had no language of their own, but spoke a pidgin of Orc, Goblin, and Giant. Those who could speak any of these languages had to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin.\n\nThe group couldn't help but feel a sense of dread as they approached the cave. The bones of many orcs littered the floor, the remains of curious creatures who had sought to follow the cleric back to his starting point. The ettins were fanatical in their loyalty to the cleric, and guarded the pass with their lives.\n\nThe adventurers knew they had to be cautious, but they couldn't shake the feeling that they were walking into a trap. The ettins had a tactic of not moving until they heard the PCs, and they were quite emphatic about it. The group knew that they had to be prepared for anything, and that they were about to face one of the most terrifying creatures in the forest - the ettin.",
