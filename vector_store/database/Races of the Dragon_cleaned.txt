Introduction

I believe in miracles. After all, the majesty and grandeur of

the dragon imbues my blood with magic. Touch my skin, feel

the pattern of my scales. Look into my eyes. Feel the magic of

my being. Know that I am dragonblood.

Few creatures excite the imagination as much as dragons.

These awesome beings are the ultimate adversaries and allies,

found throughout myths from around the world and holding

a legendary place in our hearts. For many, the appearance

of a dragon is the highlight of a campaign, meaning that

the player characters have  nally mastered their skills.

Despite our enjoyment at encountering dragons in our

games, however, playing one is not an option in most cam-

paigns due to the majesty, wealth, and power that a dragon

commands. For those who want to experience draconic

splendor  rsthandto have a chance to play with and

direct the power of the dragon ourselvesopportunities

have been few and far between. Many of us are still wishing

we could play a dragon somehowto be of a race of the

dragon. This book is for us.

Races of the Dragon is a supplement for the DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS roleplaying game. It is primarily a player

resource focusing on new options and expanded rules for

D&D players who want to play draconic races. It features

two new races, the dragonborn and the spellscale, as well

as detailing familiar dragonkind creatures such as kobolds,

half-dragons, and creatures with the draconic template.

Much of the book is devoted to new options for players and

their charactersprestige classes, feats, racial substitution

levels, spells, psionic powers, and equipment.

Races of the Dragon also includes a number of adventure

sites and sample NPCs that Dungeon Masters can use as a

resource for encounters and adventures featuring members

of the dragonblooded races.

WHAT IS A RACE

OF THE DRAGON?

Dragons have been living and breeding for eons. Sorcer-

ers of any humanoid race carry a trace of this draconic

ancestry.  Is  every  sorcerer  a  member  of  a  race  of  the

dragon? Noalthough the blood of the dragon may be

in all of them, it is dilute and latent in the vast majority.

Other races such as lizardfolk and troglodytes likewise

may have had touches of dragon blood in their past, but

they no longer have strong links to any dragon ancestry.

That link is necessary for one to claim descent from

draconic  ancestry.  Being  a  member  of  dragonblood

race goes much deeper than merely speaking Draconic

or having scales. Races of the dragon are those with

strong ties to their dragon progenitors. They look, feel,

and  often  behave  in  ways  that  reflect  their  mighty

draconic heritage.

The sidebar at the bottom of this page goes into detail

about  how  dragons  and  those  related  to  dragons  are

classified in the game.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Races of the Dragon makes use of the information in the three

D&D core rulebooksPlayers Handbook, Dungeon Masters

Guide, and Monster Manual. In addition, it contains references

to creature descriptions and other material from several

supplements, including Draconomicon, Monster Manual

II, Monster Manual III, Fiend Folio, Monstrous Compendium:

Monsters of Faern, Oriental Adventures, Epic Level Handbook,

and Sandstorm.

Although  possession  of  any  or  all  of  these  supple-

ments  will  enhance  your  enjoyment  of  Races  of  the

Dragon, they are not strictly necessary; in fact, in many

cases all the details you need to make use of a particular

creature or rule from another source are provided in

this book.

THE DRAGONKIND RACES

Just as City of the Spider Queen expanded and enumerated the

various spiderkind races, Races of the Dragon defines several

existing races as dragonkind and adds some new ones. (Some

of the stranger creatures, such as the ravid and the spell weaver,

work very well as spawn of Tiamatmortal enemies of the

dragon born  who  serve  Bahamut.)  The  dragonkind  races  de-

tailed in various D&D books (some of them appearing in more

than one source) are as follows.

Races of the Dragon: Dragonborn, spellscale, kobold, draconic

creatures, half-dragons.

Draconomicon: Dragonkin, dragonnel, elemental drakes,

faerie dragon, fang dragon, spiked felldrake, landwyrms, planar

dragons, shadow dragon, storm drake, draconic creatures,

half-dragons.

Fiend Folio: Sea drake, sunwyrm.

Monster Manual: True dragons, behir, dragon turtle, kobold,

pseudodragon, ravid, wyvern.

Monster Manual II: Gem dragons, felldrakes, frost salaman-

der, hellfire wyrm, linnorms, spellweaver.

Monster Manual III: Ambush drake, dracotaur, dragon eel,

rage drake, ssvaklor.

DRAGONBLOOD SUBTYPE

If a race possesses the dragonblood subtype, it has a strong

affinity to dragonswhich means that spells, effects, powers,

and abilities that affect or target dragons also affect it. The sub-

type qualifies a creature to use magic items normally only usable

by dragons, and qualifies the creature to take feats that have the

subtype as a prerequisite. The dragonblood subtype also makes

creatures subject to harmful effects that affect dragons.

The dragonblood subtype does not confer the dragon type

or any traits associated with that type. For instance, it does not

give a creature frightful presence.

Dragons automatically qualify for any classes, prestige classes,

racial substitution levels, feats, powers, or spells that require

the  dragonblood  subtype.  Races  presented  in  this  book  that

have the dragonblood subtype include dragonborn, spellscale,

kobold, and draconic creatures. Should a creature acquire the

dragon type, it loses the dragonblood subtype.

DRAGON-DESCENDED RACES

This term refers to a narrower category of dragonkind races.

Dragon-descended  races  are  those  that  use  either  the  half-

dragon or draconic creature templates.

Gods  wage  war  through  mortal  pawns,  and

dra conic deities are no different. Tiamat creates all sorts

of dragonlike beings to manifest her power in the world,

breeding warped creatures from her eggs. These evil enti-

ties act as the Chromatic Dragons agents. Of the other

draconic gods, only Bahamut stands between Tiamat and

her evil goals. The con ict between them has raged for

centuries. Those who know of this con ict refer to it as

the Dragonfall War.

The Platinum Dragon foreswore breeding creatures

to oppose Tiamats spawn, instead accepting humanoid

volunteers to his righteous cause. He only takes those

truly dedicated to supporting his ideals and working

against vile draconic creatures. A potential recruits past

actions matter little; all that counts is present and future

devotion to opposing Tiamat and her spawn. Some wrong-

doers have found redemption and purpose in becoming

Bahamuts servants.

Those willing to give themselves into Bahamuts care

and act as his emissaries in the mortal realms become

his  daughters  and  sons.  Such  humanoids  give  up  all

their former racial identity and are born anew. They

become dragonborn.

Dragonborn are powerful, majestic creatures that

resemble their adoptive father. They fight ceaselessly

against  the  spawn  of  Tiamat,  gaining  allies  in  the

Dragonfall War along the way. Dragonborn are great

leaders with clear purpose. They are often the motivat-

ing nexus of an adventuring party.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Vythjhank ux Maekrix tibur Gunnloda Holderhek

stirred from sleep at the calling of her name.

Vyth? Time for your watch.

Vyth opened her eyes and blinked in the light from

the banked camp re. Despite the drowsiness still in

her eyes, she was able to see wellmuch better in

this dim illumination than she ever had been able

to as a dwarf.

Thanks, Charmaine. Help me with my armor?

Charmaine yawned broadly several times while

helping Vyth buckle on her full plate. At last, with

the  nal piece in place, the hal ing crawled into

Vyths still-warm bedroll to get a few more hours

of sleep before dawn.

Vyth pulled on a  ne wool tabard over her

armor. She had bought it recently in an elf com-

munity, where the tailor had embroidered a small

symbol of Bahamut on it with silver thread.

10/25/05   11:49:07 AM

Walking the perimeter of the camp, Vyth was alert for

threats. The camp was not as secure as she would have

likedno  trench  and  no  wall,  just  a  few  small  traps

Charmaine had rigged at dusk. But the stopover here was

only for one night.

Vyth looked about the camp at her companions, these

folk she had recruited to her cause.

Her gaze lingered on Charmaine with affection. The

little one (as Vyth always called her friend) repeatedly

proved herself a wonderful scout and a deadly blade against

the spawn of Tiamat. Charmaine had heard Bahamuts

call, but while rallying to his righteous banner, she had

declined to become a dragonborn. She valued the litheness

of her hal ing form and didnt want to give up the abilities

that made her such a lethal dragon foe. Vyth respected the

hal ings choice but occasionally teased her by calling

her near-sister.

A tall human slept soundly nearby, a medallion of

silver at his neck shaped like a fist clutching a bolt of

lightning. He was a human worshiper of Heironeous

named Claudius Repriquel. Vyth didnt know him very

wellthey had never engaged an enemy together before.

He seemed a fine, conscientious fellow. His devotion

to his deity and the foundation of good was clear in all

his actions.

The  last  member  of  the  party  worried  Vyth.  Even

though she had traveled for several days with Sjach, the

spellscale sorcerer, she still didnt know him. Sjach was

wildly unpredictable. He often found new and innovative

ways to use his sorcery, but those innovations often came

as a complete surprise to his companions. Indisputably

talented, he had a winning personality that served to keep

up morale. Vyth wished she trusted him more.

The remainder of the night passed uneventfully. At

dawn,  Vyth  stood  guard  while  Claudius  prayed  and

Sjach meditated. This day would have need for their

magical abilities.

After  his  meditation,  Sjach  asked,  Did  I  tell  you

about the time I bought a dire weasel mount from a

kobold merchant?

Uh, no, but we need to set out. Time for stories on

the trail, Vyth replied, turning away. She was eager to

get moving.

Sjach shrugged and proceeded to entertain Charmaine

with the tale. Vyth shook her head. At least he packed

while he jabbered.

At last, her companions indicated they were ready

to proceed on the journey. In a few hours, they would

be in the area where Vyth believed the wyverns they

sought laired.

The  going  was  slow,  the  terrain  rough.  Barely  an

hour after they started, Charmaine pointed. A shape,

serpentine and dark,  ew across the sun. It wheeled in

the sky and turned toward the travelers, growing closer

with each second.

As Vyth had taught them to do against spawn without

breath weapons, the companions gathered in a tight cluster.

Claudius called upon Heironeous to strengthen Vyth.

Sjach rubbed his leather belt and muttered an incanta-

tion. Both Charmaine and Vyth steeled themselves to

meet the coming attack.

The wyvern closed. As it dove toward them, Claudius

clutched his medallion and called out, We adherents to

the 314th Analect of Courage in the Face of Death call on

your blessing, mighty Lord of Valor!

At the same moment, Sjach threw up his hands, ending

the casting of a spell and sending a buzz through Vyths

nerves. The world seemed to slow down.

With a throaty growl and the  apping of great, leath-

ery wings, the wyvern was upon them. As the creature

swooped down to snatch up Claudius, Vyth attacked. A

mighty blow from her warhammer smashed down upon

its  grasping  claw.  Charmaine  sprang  forward  to   ing  a

tanglefoot bag, coating the dragons wings with the bags

sticky contents.

Brought to ground and wild with pain, the enraged

wyvern  lashed  out,  catching  Sjach  with  its  stinging

tail. Blood, dark and viscous with poison, trickled from

the wound.

Claudius stepped up behind the spellscale as he prayed

that the poison would slow within Sjachs veins. Get

behind me, he urged the injured sorcerer.

Thisll be better, Sjach rasped. He intoned words of

power and folded his arms. Suddenly,  ve exact duplicates

of the spellscale appeared.

Vyth drifted to the left, diverting the wyverns attention

from her companions with swings of her hammer. Two

strikes landed, but only the solid blow to its chest drew

the wyvern around to focus on her.

As the dragon maneuvered to attack Vyth, Charmaine

struck true with her little sword. Thick blood  owed from

under the wyverns wing.

Surrounded by so many seemingly dangerous foes, the

wyvern spread out its attacks. Vyth recoiled from the

shock of the blow as its jaws slammed into her, bruising

her badly and puncturing her breastplate in several places.

Its talons and wings scrabbled at the many images of Sjach,

causing three of them to disappear, but leaving Sjach no

further injured. The wyverns poisonous sting de ected

harmlessly off Claudiuss heavy shield.

Claudius  swung  his  morningstar,  driving  it  into  the

wyverns side. The creature roared and whirled.

Sjach crushed a little ovoid onto the tip of a dart he held,

pointing with his other hand. A greenish  ash streaked

into the wyverns neck, striking with a pop and a hiss.

Vyth came in from the side, bringing her hammer down

on the distracted beasts skull. The wyverns head hit the

ground. Its body toppled and lay twitching on the trail.

Well done! Vyth cried, Well done indeed, friends!

Claudius entreated Heironeous to mend the wounds of

the brave. Vyth rested while Charmaine provided Sjach

with a vial of antivenom.

This day isnt over, murmured Vyth, looking up into

the hills. Wyverns are aggressive, but that one attacked us

speci cally, far from its lair. Its protecting something.

Will  there  be  another  big  one  up  there?  asked

Charmaine.

Claudius raised an eyebrow.

Maybe, said Vyth, and perhaps some little ones.

I hope so, said Sjach, grinning. That was a bit of

fun, eh?

Vyth just shook her head and started up into the hills.

THE CALL OF BAHAMUT

The  dragonborn  children  of  Bahamut  are  a  unique

race  in  that  they  are  not  born;  they  are  reborn.  Each

one enters the world as a halfling, an elf, a human, or

a member of some other humanoid race with all that

races propensities and traits. Bahamut beckons to his

would-be followers, and those few who might choose

to serve him.

Most of those who hear the Platinum Dragons call

discover it early, before they reach adolescence. A few

heed it after reaching adulthood and beginning their

careers. Not all who are called answer.

The call is a strange event that one must experience

to understand. It takes the form of a courteous mental

question,  asking  if  ones  heart  and  soul  are  able

and willing to undertake dedication to a noble and

arduous purposeprotecting the world from the

spawn of Tiamat.

Bahamuts call asks the chosen one if she

is willing to give herself over entirely to this

cause,  giving  up  all  that  she  was  before  to

transform into one of Bahamuts children.

This  choice  is  never  easy.  The  cho-

sen one is made aware of the many

sacrifices she must make, from

her racial identity to her fam-

ily  and  friends,  even  her

whole  way  of  life.

The only reward for

those  forfeitures  is

service  to  the  Plati-

num Dragon and his

abiding love.

The  Rite  of  Rebirth  transforms  a

character into a dedicated draconic servant of Bahamut

known as a dragonborn.

Becoming a dragonborn isnt undertaken lightly. It is a

long process full of self-re ection and commitment. Those

supplicants raised in the ways of their original race must

carefully consider what theyre giving up. While a human

might be content to give up her natural versatility, its rare

for someone heavily invested in her racial identity to forfeit

that races abilities.

When the rite begins, the supplicant lays aside all

her equipment and possessions for the duration of the

ceremony. Dressed in a loose, linen shift, she spends

a full day and night fasting and meditating upon her

choice. Her mind  lls with all the things she is giving up,

reminding her she must forgo much of herself to become

a dragonborn.

When dawn comes, the prospective dragonborn crawls

inside an egg-shaped structure that she has built (see

Cost) in order to sleep for the last time in her original

form. This symbolic act represents her acceptance of

the transformation. When the next dawn arrives, she is

transformed into a dragonborn. After awakening inside

the sealed egg, she breaks out of it as a glorious, draconic

child of Bahamut.

Prerequisites: In order to be accepted as a suitable

candidate, the supplicant must be non-evil and have an

Intelligence score of at least 3.

Bene  t:  A  dragonborn  loses  many  of  her

original racial traits and gains the racial traits of

the dragonborn race (see below).

Time: The Rite of Rebirth requires

24  hours  of  meditation  and  fasting

followed by 24 hours of sleep. If the

ceremony is interrupted, the prospec-

tive child of Bahamut must start the rite

from the beginning.

Cost:  The  symbolic  egg  crafted  by  the

prospective dragonborn costs 100 gp to create,

and requires a handful of scales from metallic

dragons.

APPEARANCE

Noble. Draconic. Nearly every descrip-

tion  of  a  dragonborn  includes  those

two words. So thoroughly has a dragon-

born physically transformed that only

the  framework  of  her  former  appear-

ance  remains.  Dragonborn  are

always slightly bigger than most

other  members  of  their  origi-

nal race.

These servants of Bahamut

epitomize devotion to righteous-

ness.  Their  very  appearance

gives an impression of virtuous

purpose.  Dragonborn  carry

themselves with good deportment,

seeing themselves as humanoid repre-

sentations of noble dragonkind.

When a dragonborn walks into an

inn, patrons heads turn and eyes stare. What they see is

well worth a second glance. In every aspect of their pres-

ence, dragonborn consciously act as emissaries of their

adoptive father, Bahamut.

DRAGONBORN RACIAL TRAITS

A dragonborn combines some of the racial traits of her

original race and her new form. Only those traits gained

from transformation are given here; see also the Mechanics

of Rebirth sidebar.

+2 Constitution, 2 Dexterity. Dragonborn are hearty

and healthy, but they are awkward in their newly adopted

bodies.

Humanoid (dragonblood): Dragonborn are humanoids

with the dragonblood subtype and any other subtypes

they  had  before  undergoing  the  Rite  of  Rebirth.  For

all effects related to race, a dragonborn is considered a

dragon and a member of her original race.

Age: After a dragonborn underoes the Rite of Rebirth,

she emerges as an adult creature regardless of her previ-

ous age. If she lives for 200 years (see Table 11, page 10),

she enters middle age.

+2  dodge  bonus  to  Armor  Class  against  creatures

of the dragon type. The dragonborn have an innate

sense of how best to defend themselves against their

potential enemies.

Immunity  to  Frightful  Presence:  Dragonborn  are

immune  to  the  frightful  presence  ability  of  dragons,

just as if they were dragons.

Draconic Aspect: Bahamut has blessed the dragonborn

with aspects combining some of the best attributes of

good dragons. Upon completing the Rite of Rebirth,

a dragonborn chooses which of the following three

aspects to manifest. Once the choice is made, it cannot

be changed.

Heart  (Su):  A  dragonborn  who  chooses  heart  as

her draconic aspect gains a breath weapon. The breath

weapon is a bright, shining line that coruscates with

every metallic color. The lines length is 5 feet per Hit

Die the dragonborn has, up to a maximum of 100 feet at

20 HD. The breath weapon deals 1d8 points of damage,

plus an extra 1d8 points for each 3 HD the dragonborn

possesses (2d8 at 3 HD, 3d8 at 6 HD, and so on). The

damage can be acid, cold, electricity, or  re, changing

on each use as the dragonborn chooses. A successful

Re ex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the dragonborns HD + her Con

modi er) halves the damage. A dragonborn can use her

breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds.

Mind (Ex): A dragonborn who selects the mind aspect

sharpens her senses, gaining immunity to paralysis and

magic sleep effects. She gains darkvision out to 30 feet

and low-light vision, plus a +2 racial bonus on Listen,

Search, and Spot checks.

At 6 HD, the dragonborns darkvision extends to

60 feet.

At 9 HD, the dragonborns darkvision extends to 90

feet,  and  her  low-light  vision  allows  her  to  see  three

times as far as a human in shadowy illumination.

At  12  HD,  the  dragonborns  darkvision  extends  to

120 feet, and her low-light vision allows her to see four

times as far as a human in shadowy illumination.

At 15 HD, the dragonborn gains blindsense out to

30 feet.

Wings  (Ex):  A  dragonborn  who  selects  the  wings

aspect hatches sporting fully formed wings. Dragonborn

can use these wings to aid their jumps (granting a +10

racial bonus on Jump checks) and to glide. Those with

6 HD or more can use their wings to  y.

Gliding: A dragonborn can use her wings to glide,

negating damage from a fall from any height and allow-

ing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent.

Dragonborn glide at a speed of 30 feet with average

maneuverability. Even if a dragonborns maneuverability

improves, she cant hover while gliding. A dragonborn

cant glide while carrying a medium or heavy load.

If a dragonborn becomes unconscious or helpless while

in midair, her wings naturally unfurl, and powerful

ligaments stiffen them.

The dragonborn descends slowly in a tight corkscrew

and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter

the actual distance of the fall.

Flight: When a dragonborn who selected the wings

aspect reaches 6 HD, she gains a fly speed of 30 feet

with  average  maneuverability.  A  dragonborn  cant

fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while

fatigued or exhausted.

A dragonborn can safely  y for a number of con-

secutive  rounds  equal  to  her  Constitution  modi er

(minimum  1  round).  She  can  double  this  length  of

 ight but is fatigued by such exertion. The dragonborn

is  likewise  fatigued  after  spending  a  total  of  more

than 10 minutes per day  ying. Because a dragonborn

can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual

 ight, she can remain aloft for extended periods, even

if she can only use  ight for 1 round at a time without

becoming fatigued.

When she reaches 12 HD, a dragonborn has enough

stamina and prowess to  y without tiring. She can  y

at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability) with no

more exertion than walking or running.

A dragonborn with  ight can make a dive attack. A

dive attack works like a charge, but the dragonborn

must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least

10 feet. A dragonborn can make a dive attack only when

wielding a piercing weapon. If the dive attack hits, it

deals double damage.

A dragonborn with  ight can use the run action while

 ying, provided she  ies in a straight line.

Automatic Languages: Draconic. Dragonborn gain the

ability to speak Draconic upon their transformation

but do not lose the ability to speak languages they

already know.

Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass dragonborns  ghter

class does not count when determining whether she

takes an experience point penalty for being a multi-

classed character. Furthermore, dragonborn paladins

can leave that class and return to it without penalty.

Also, see the Mechanics of Rebirth sidebar.

AGE

A dragonborn character is reborn, losing any bonuses or

penalties she received because of her age. She emerges from

her transformation as an adult. Dragonborn are hearty and

capable of living long lives. Due to their perilous  ght

against the spawn of Tiamat, however, most die young.

THE MECHANICS OF REBIRTH

Upon  transformation  from  her  initial  race  to  a  dragonborn,

a  supplicant  loses  many  racial  traits  and  gains  those  of  the

dragonborn. The following information describes how to me-

chanically achieve this transformation.

Type, Subtype, and Race: You retain your original type and

subtypes, gaining the dragonblood subtype. You still count as

a member of your original race for the purpose of any effect or

prerequisite that depends on race.

Racial Hit Dice: You retain your original racial Hit Dice, as well

as all benefits gained therefrom (base attack and save bonuses,

skill points, hit points, and so on).

Ability Modifiers: You retain your original racial ability modi-

fiers and gain the ability modifiers of the dragonborn race.

Size:  You  retain  your  original  size.  If  the  original  race  had

powerful build as a racial trait, it is also retained.

Speed: You retain your original base land speed, as well as any

other modes of movement possessed by your original race. Other

racial traits related to speed or movement, such as the dwarfs

ability to move at full speed in medium or heavy armor, are lost.

Languages: You retain any languages you already know. You

gain Draconic as an automatic language.

Favored Class: You retain your original favored classes and

gain fighter as a favored class. You can multiclass into the pala-

din class freely.

Level Adjustment: You retain your original level adjustment.

Other Racial Traits: You lose all other racial traits of your origi-

nal race, including bonus feats, skill bonuses, attack bonuses,

save  bonuses,  spell-like  abilities,  and  so  forth.  Two  specific

instances warrant clarification.

(cid:129)   If your original race granted you a nonspecific bonus feat (such

as the one gained by a human at 1st level), any feat can be lost,

so long as it is not a prerequisite for another feat you have.

(cid:129)  If your original race granted bonus skill points, you should

deduct an appropriate amount of skill points from your cur-

rent  skill  ranks.  The  specific  skills  affected  are  up  to  you,

but  the  DMs  input  might  be  required  to  adjudicate  tricky

situations  (such  as  multiclass  characters  who  might  have

purchased  ranks  of  various  skills  as  both  class  skills  and

cross-class skills).

The loss of racial traits might mean you no longer meet the

prerequisites for a prestige class, feat, or some other feature.

In general, you lose any special ability for which you no longer

qualify, and nothing is gained in its place. A couple of excep-

tions exist.

(cid:129)  If you no longer qualify for a feat due to the transformation,

you lose the feat and immediately select a new feat for which

you  qualify  in  its  place.  You  must  also  replace  any  feat  for

which the lost feat was a prerequisite.

(cid:129)  If you no longer qualify for a prestige class, you lose the ben-

efit of any class features or other special abilities granted by

the class. You retain Hit Dice gained from advancing in the

class, as well as any improvements to base attack bonus and

base save bonuses that the class provided. If you later meet

all the prerequisites for the class, you regain the benefits.

Special:  Ordinarily,  only  a  1st-level  character  can  select

certain feats requiring the dragonblood subtype (see Chapter

6).  However,  upon  becoming  a  dragonborn,  you  can  elect  to

replace  one  (and  only  one)  of  your  existing  feats  with  one  of

these  feats.  A  character  cannot  have  more  than  one  of  these

feats. The feat to be replaced cannot be a prerequisite for any

prestige class, ability, or other feat.

HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

Dragonborn differ in size as much as members of their

original race do. Typically, a dragonborn becomes larger

and full-bodied in her new form, gaining 1 to 2 inches

of height and 5% to 10% in weight.

CLOTHING

Dragonborn  wear  clothing  that  is  both  simple  and

elegant. They endeavor to present themselves as befits

Bahamuts representatives. Their garb is always of supe-

rior materials, such as combed cotton, soft wool, crisp

linen, or  ne silk, often dyed in tones resembling metals

or jewels. Even so, these rich garments are plain in style

and never  amboyant.

The clothing a dragonborn wears combines beauty and

utility. She is ever ready to take up arms and combat evil.

Her clothes suit her dragon- ghting skills. For example,

a  dragonborn  with  arcane  spellcasting  abilities  often

wears clothing that incorporates little pouches for spell

components. A dragonborn rogue wears clothes that

enable her to move with stealth and grace.

Dragonborn dont spend their time weaving or sewing.

Matters of great importance demand their attention.

When in constant conflict with the spawn of Tiamat,

one doesnt have much time to devote to domestic crafts.

Instead, materials and clothes are usually purchased from

other races, and a dragonborn hires a tailor to provide a

custom  t. Garb of elven manufacture has a reputation for

its excellence, and such clothes suit the dragonborns taste

for quality and style.

The armor a dragonborn wears is always maintained and

eye-catching. Perhaps its polished to a mirrorlike sheen,

or designed to resemble dragon scales. A dragonborns

armor makes a statement about the wearer and her ideals

while providing ample defense.

Dragonborn never use dragonhide for clothing or armor.

To wear the skin of a dragon is as disgusting to one of

Bahamuts beloved as wearing human skin is to most

humans. While some adventurers might prize souvenirs

of dragon teeth, claws, and so forth, dragonborn eschew

these grisly trophies.

Roleplaying Application: Dragonborn react nega-

tively  to  individuals  wearing  dragonhide  or  dragon

parts. A dragonborn NPC begins with an initial attitude

(PH  72)  one  category  worse  toward  anyone  wearing

dragon parts.

GROOMING

Dragonborn keep their bodies clean and neat. Even when

out in the wilds in pursuit of an evil dragon, a dragonborn

manages to look her best.

When she emerges from the egg at the end of her trans-

formation rite, a dragonborns body is new and perfect.

Any blemishes, scars, or tattoos that previously marked

her body disappear. The new, draconic skin feels soft and

supple, the body vigorous.

Dragonborn approach their grooming with pragma-

tism and the knowledge that they stand for Bahamut

in the eyes of many onlookers. As such, they conduct

themselves with dignity, taking the necessary time with

their appearance.

However, being neat and clean is enough. Dragonborn

dont often bother with ornamental fripperies, such as the

scale tints used by spellscales, or tattoos. They esteem their

forms as is, without any additional adornments.

Dragonborn dont stint when it comes to keeping their

gear clean and in good repair. They perform any neces-

sary chores of washing, polishing, and mending when

they must, but many dragonborn simply pay others for

such services. Theyd rather spend the time and effort on

grander concerns.

I live but to serve.

PSYCHOLOGY

Ux Caex tibur Elf Silaqui Nalo

All dragonborn are devoted to Bahamuts cause, having

chosen a pure and noble path of service to the King

of  Good  Dragons.  This  choice  was  not  lightly  made

but arrived at through ceremony and contemplation.

Dragonborn have given up their former lives, loves, and

interests for a hard life of duty. A dragonborn, there-

fore, has the strong identity of one with an apparent

heritage mingled with the clear purpose of one with

stringent principles.

Who am I? Why am I here? Do the gods hear? Do they

care? These questions distract or torment other humanoids.

A dragonborn has gentle, reassuring responses to these

mysteries, and thus she has confidence, direction, and

even a mild sense of superiority. She need not wonder.

She knows.

An intense sense of kinship exists between dragon-

borna feeling that only others of their kind can truly

understand. A sense of the sublime infuses their re ec-

tions upon what it means to be a dragonborn. They are

the  chosen,  adopted  by  a  god  for  a  greater  duty.  Their

lives have purpose and de nition.

Despite, or perhaps because of all this depth of identity

and self-assurance, the psychology of dragonborn is simple.

Every resource at hand is used to combat evil dragons and

those  who  aid  them.  These  enemies  must  be  opposed.

Actions and allies that further this endeavor are enjoyed

and valued, but most of the world is either uncommitted or

ignorant. Dragonborn strive to please Bahamut and ful ll

their destinies. Their lives are full of ardor and obligation,

with personal glory or gain realized only through ful lling

their divine quest.

DRAGONBORN LIFE

A dragonborns life focuses on fighting the spawn of

Tiamat. Every waking moment is spent in that pursuit,

though it might not be obviously so to a casual observer.

How could hunting a vicious werewolf, attending a society

dance, or helping a friend build a stronghold have anything

to do with  ghting Tiamats spawn? It might or might not,

depending upon an individuals motivations.

In the case of a dragonborn, one can be sure that each

action does tie into the  ght against Tiamat. Hunting a

werewolf might hone the skills of a dragonborn and her

companions between encounters with Tiamats spawn.

Any humanoid race can be reborn as an emissary of Bahamut

A dragonborn might use a nobles soiree as an opportunity

to acquire a patron to fund expeditions against evil dragon-

kind. Rendering aid of almost any sort to a friend is a

necessary part of building the trust, con dence, and amity

central to a functional team of dragon-slayers. Dragonborn

are few, and they must secure allies and better means of

 ghting Tiamats spawn.

LEISURE

The traditional concept of leisure, with its connotations

of aimless use of time, does not  t with a dragonborns

wholehearted dedication to her cause. If a dragonborn

rests, it is to regain her strength when she is tired or

wounded. If she has free time, her leisure pursuits often

seem like work or zealotry to others.

All her thoughts and efforts focus on fighting evil

dragon kind.  Understanding  that  her  allies  in  the

Dragonfall  War  may  not  have  the  capacity  for  such

single-minded behavior, a dragonborn allows time for

her  companions  and  friends  to  do  as  they  need.  She

frowns  only  on  activities  that  weaken  the  mind  and

body or that harm others.

Since any time not spent in direct ful llment of the

work against the spawn of Tiamat is leisure time, a dragon-

born makes optimal use of these intervals, emphasizing

the need for training and experience. For example, one

leisure pursuit of a dragonborn might be to help her

gnome and dwarf companions hunt down a rampaging

troll. Such an activity serves to bond friends and test

their skills.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Some dragonborn choose to express their devotion to their

cause through painting, song, or some other craft. These

creations celebrate dragonborn identity and lifestyle. They

are created in praise of Bahamut, to represent some extraor-

dinary deed done by a dragonborn, or to demonstrate the

hideousness of the spawn of Tiamat.

Elf and human cultures often place artistic pursuits

at the pinnacle of achievement, as the ultimate expres-

sion of a peoples worth. Not so for dragonborn. Art,

crafts, music, and similar cultural pursuits are always

of  secondary  importance  to  a  dragonborn.  They  are

fine pursuits to be indulged in while recovering from

wounds  or  mustering  ones  resources  for  the  next

sortie against Tiamats spawn, but a dragonborn never

lets  herself  be  distracted  from  her  true  vocation.  As

a result, dragonborn art might be expressive, but its

rarely lauded as superior.

Those who were great sculptors or performers in their

lives before becoming dragonborn certainly retain those

skills. They often continue to produce great masterpieces,

focusing on draconic topics. Because so much of their

time and energy centers on the Dragonfall War, however,

dragonborn artists produce fewer works than many of their

fellow craftworkers or performers.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Neither technology nor magic holds any particular fascina-

tion for dragonborn. Both are tools. Dragonborn tend to

measure items of technology or magical effects in terms

of how well they can be used in the struggle against the

spawn of Tiamat.

Alchemical items are great assets when  ghting evil

dragonkind. Flying spawn can be grounded with tangle-

foot bags, and a dragons thick hide and spell resistance

help little against alchemists  re or acid. These technologi-

cal innovations have high applicability to the dragonborns

endless struggle with the Chromatic Dragons brood.

Magic is essential to survival in a dragonborns mission,

and  she  is  straightforward  in  her  evaluation  of  magics

utility. Any successful group of adventurers requires the

aid of divine and arcane spellcasters. Reliability and ver-

satility are important to a dragonborn, so her spellcasting

companions are often wizards or clerics.

LOVE

Dragonborn love Bahamut. They love one another for

their universal nobleness of spirit and the sacri ce each

made to become a dragonborn. Innocent creatures and

the world as a whole garner love from dragonborn, for

dragonborn seek to preserve the world and its bounty

from the depredations of Tiamat.

A dragonborn might feel tenderness toward her birth

family, those who succored and cared for her, enabling

her to grow up in such a way as to become Bahamuts

child. She might even honor other good deities, perhaps

giving a special place to the one she worshiped before her

transformation. She cares for her companions. However,

a dragonborn gave her body, mind, and soul to Bahamut

and his service when accepting the transformation. Her

thoughts, inclinations, and pleasures all revolve around

this commitment.

No room is left in a dragonborns heart for romantic

love. Choosing to bond and share her life with another,

valuing his or her life above others, would detract from

her higher purpose. Such a significant other could also

become a victim of the dragonborns enemies or become

a distraction at the wrong moment.

While a dragonborn retains her sexual characteristics,

she is essentially asexual. A dragonborn has no interest in

even the visceral comfort of sex as most humanoid races

know it. Indeed, no lures of the  esh quicken either her

pulse or her imagination. She has no drive to procreate,

and dragonborn are in fact sterile.

Even if peculiarities of circumstances lead to a dragon-

born coupling with another creature, no child ever results.

Bahamut created his children in such a way that only those

who truly choose to become dragonborn may do so. No

accidents of birth oblige any creature to pursue the hard

life of Bahamuts chosen.

DRAGONBORN AT WAR

To live is to strive against Tiamat and all her spawn.

Dragonborn credo

War with the spawn of Tiamat is the constant and normal

state of existence for a dragonborn. Fighting against

iniquitous dragons and their ilk is central to a dragon-

borns life. While maintaining continual devotion to and

vigilance in this cause, she nevertheless knows that the

struggle is such a large one that it is likely shell not see

the end of it. When deities wage war, the con ict spans

centuries, if not millennia, but dragonborn are prepared

to  ght for as long as it takes. Their allegiance and dedica-

tion are unswerving.

It is through war that dragonborn  nd their reason for

being. They achieve the greatest satisfaction, the knowl-

edge that they are ful lling their destiny, from opposing

evil dragonkind. Dragonborn know they are  ghting to

save the world.

Dragonborn use every means at their disposal to enhance

their tactical and strategic positions in the Dragonfall War.

They take a long view, knowing that no one clash can win

the campaign. It is only through winning battle after battle

after battle that they can triumph.

Tiamats ultimate ambition is to fill the multiverse

with her evil spawn. She creates increasing numbers of

vile offspring, creatures of great power and malevolence.

These depraved entities, having no compunction about

destroying or killing, beget only mayhem and devastation.

Left unchecked, they would eventually send the world to

its ruination.

Wars between mere mortals are meaningless to dragon-

born.  Compared  to  to  the  Dragonfall  War,  conflicts

between monarchs and countries are trivial, their motiva-

tions suspect. Unless participating in such a war ful lls

one of a dragonborns strategic objectives, she abstains

from joining in the dispute.

DEATH

Dragonborn lead dangerous lives. They continually put

themselves in peril and are not afraid to die. If they have

kept true to the sacred duty entrusted to them by Bahamut,

they have the gentle con dence that their fathers rewards

await them in the afterlife.

Dragonborn avoid death not out of fear, but because

passing away is the end of their mortal quest. Tiamat

continues to create more spawn, and a dead dragonborn

is unable to oppose the Chromatic Dragons machinations.

Most dragonborn choose to return to life if called back

by a raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell. If a

reincarnate spell is used, almost all dragonborn return but

endeavor to complete the Rite of Rebirth to regain their

dragonborn bodies as soon as possible.

Sacrifice, not Suicide

Dragonborn are fearless. They feel certain that their

efforts are necessary and make a difference. Death is

always close at hand in a soldiers life, but dragonborn

arent any more afraid of death than any other threat.

This doesnt mean a dragonborn needlessly or foolishly

throws her life away. A dragonborn might undertake

a mission against impossible odds. Shell do so only if

a chance of success exists, and only if the undertaking

serves a strategic goal.

A victory had only through staggering losses is not a

win at all. Such a success hampers the cause as a whole

by removing too many assets from the dragonborns side

in the Dragonfall War. On the other hand, it is perfectly

acceptable to lose a battle if it costs the enemy more than

she gains and in uences the ultimate course of the war

in favor of Bahamut and his chosen.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

While still new as a race, dragonborn have started to

form a culture. Some speculate that the Rite of Rebirth

predisposes those who undergo it to adopt a particular

mindset, instilling values and norms as innate instincts.

Others surmise that the long ceremonial process includes

speci c training, indoctrinating the new dragonborn.

These are the ruminations of outsiders. Those who

have undergone the rite do not speak of it. They merely

smile and shake their heads at all such theories, their

eyes  tinged  with  the  burden  of  some  indescribably

beautiful sorrow.

DRAGONBORN

AND OTHER RACES

The Dragonfall War requires great allies because it is fought

against great enemies.

Ux Levethix tibur Human Carlton Wentworth

Dragonborn take a strategic view toward other humanoid

races. Anyone and everyone might be useful to the dragon-

born cause. These folk can and should be employed in the

 ght against Tiamats spawn.

In addition to exhibiting the general viewpoints that

follow, a dragonborn tends to hold members of her original

race in a place of high esteem and gentle affection. Having

grown up as such a creature, she better understands them

and their culture.

Draconic: A dragonborns attitude toward a draconic

creature  depends  greatly  on  the  creatures  heritage.

Someone with copper dragon ancestry might  nd a ready

welcome, while an individual with green dragon heritage

might be viewed with distrust, if not outright hostility.

That said, dragonborn do realize that a draconic individual

is more than the expression of his racial heritage, and are

generally willing to give at least one chance to those who

seek to prove that their nature is not ruled by the blood

in their veins.

Dwarves: Gruff, doughty folk, dwarves are valuable

allies when dragonborn seek dragon spawn in subterranean

lairs. No other race has the innate skill with underground

environs that dwarves display. In addition, theyre coura-

geous  and  carefulexcellent  companions  to  have  in  a

tight spot.

Elves: These masters of the woodlands can be good

friends in the fight against evil dragonkind. Their acute

senses make them great scouts. In addition, elves pro-

pensity for wizardly magic makes them very powerful

and versatile.

Gnomes: Clever and skillful, gnomes offer an enormous

diversity of talents, ranging from innate spell-like abilities

to a knack for alchemy. Their natural enmity for kobolds,

which are often the servants or slaves of evil dragons, is

especially helpful.

Half-Dragons: A half-dragon can easily  nd himself

classi ed as either mortal enemy or long-lost ally. Dragon-

born know what it is to be neither one thing nor the other,

though they are often nonplussed by the dif dent, aloof

attitude many half-dragons have. Metallic-descended half-

dragons are a cause of frustration and joy for dragonborn,

depending on whether they can be convinced to take

up the struggle of the Dragonfall War, while chromatic-

descended half-dragons rarely get a chance to prove their

good or evil intentionsalthough recruiting a chromatic

half-dragon for the side of good is a great victory, no shame

derives from simply making sure that creature does not

turn his skills to Tiamats service.

Half-Elves: While they lack the elves racial inclination

for good, half-elves can be very useful in the Dragonfall

War. They get along well with others and make excellent

spokespersons. A half-elf can find out much valuable

information to further a dragonborns goals.

Half-Orcs: Extraordinarily competent in a  ght, half-

orcs are outstanding front-rank combatants. Properly

directed, their  erce qualities make them formidable allies

in combat against Tiamats spawn.

Hal  ings: These wanderers have great talents in the

subtle arts. Hal ings have no racial proclivity toward good

or evil. However, if a hal ing with the proper skills can be

enlisted in the struggle against Tiamats spawn, his stealth

and guile can be very useful.

Humans: Its important for a dragonborn to be selec-

tive when it comes to acquiring a human ally. A great deal

depends upon a group working well together. Good or

neutral humans are eminently suitable for  lling in gaps

in a dragon-slaying groups strengths.

Kobolds: Dragonborn approach kobolds with guarded

reserve. Kobolds display a racial tendency for evil, often

allying themselves with evil dragons and dragon kind,

even the warped spawn of Tiamat. Toward these kobolds,

dragonborn  show  no  mercy.  However,  the  blessed  of

Bahamut  understand  that  while  kobolds  are  often

malevolent, exceptions certainly exist. Good kobolds

can  prove  to  be  unusual  and  welcome  allies,  able  to

infiltrate lairs of dragons who use kobolds as servants

or slaves.

Spellscales:  Dragonborn  view  spellscales  as  dis-

tant relatives. Dragonblood by birth, these charming

creatures  make  excellent  sorcerers  and  can  provide

invaluable magical assistance. Spellscales can be danger-

ously amoral, though. Their actions and inclinations are

difficult to predict, making them hard to direct. Never-

theless,  a  spellscales  inventive  tactics  often  surprise

the enemy.

True  Dragons:  Dragonborn  look  on  metallic  true

dragons as respected elders. None are held in the same

reverence as Bahamut, certainly, unless one has truly

distinguished itself in the Dragonfall War. Even those

dragons who choose a path of neutrality are given respect.

Chromatic dragons are seen as tools of Tiamat, as little

more than dangerously cunning animals in some cases.

They are the sworn enemies of their lord Bahamutno

quarter is given or asked.

RELIGION

Honor any god not of wicked purpose. Serve only Bahamut.

Dragonborn credo

Dragonborn view Bahamut simultaneously as their deity

and their father. They accord him honor and worship. (See

page 151 for more information on Bahamut.)

The relationship between dragonborn and the Platinum

Dragon is familial and liberal enough that dragonborn

can and do honor other gods. Some dragonborn clerics

continue to worship and gain spells from deities such as

Heironeous or Yondalla. Bahamut condones this behavior

as long as the other deity is not evil and has no af liation

with Tiamat.

LAW AND CHAOS, GOOD AND EVIL

Although  all  dragonborn  serve  Bahamuts  cause  with

sincere, heartfelt devotion, not all of them employ tactics

that he himself would use to accomplish their noble goals.

In the con ict with Tiamat, Bahamut turns a forgiving

eye toward slightly immoral actions but doesnt tolerate

any form of evil. All the children of the Platinum Dragon

share the commitment to  ght against evil dragonkind.

Their methods vary greatly.

NIGHT OF REMEMBRANCE

At sunset on the longest night of the year, a dragonborn

gathers her friends and allies about her. She hosts a formal

gathering in which she tells the story of the preceding

year and encourages others who were there to tell their

part of the tales. Battles fought and foes overcome in the

previous year are woven into the stories. In the case of a

greatly accomplished dragonborn, this recitation can last

from dusk to dawn.

On this night, the dragonborn also offers gifts and

accolades to her companions in her struggles against the

spawn of Tiamat. It is customary for her to present each of

her allies with a small offering that epitomizes the talents

and prowess each one displayed.

Such a gift is always useful, usually intended as both

a serviceable item and a memento of a past challenge. To

a wizard who constantly endows her with bulls strength, a

dragonborn might give a scroll or item containing that spell

or a thematically similar one, such as Tensers transforma-

tion. A rogue ally might get a wand of web in honor of the

time when he used a tanglefoot bag to make a young black

dragons wings so sticky it couldnt  y. The occasion also

has a solemn aspect, as those present honor fallen comrades

with tales of their valor.

HOLIDAYS

In most cultures, holidays have ancient roots, evolving

naturally  from  shared  experiences  and  the  joys  and

tribulations endured by a united people. Dragonborn are

a relatively new race. They have no ancient traditions.

Instead, they have a few days of particular importance to

them as individuals.

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE

The ancient tales valued by dragonborn are those told of

Bahamut, or Great Dragon Father, as his children some-

times refer to him. Since dragonborn are so new as a race,

stories about them are not numerous. Three legends that

have gained a great deal of exposure in the world at large

are detailed below.

DAY OF TRANSCENDENCE

The  day  that  a  dragonborn  breaks  herself  free  from

the symbolic egg of the Rite of Rebirth holds special

significance. Yearly anniversaries of this birth day are

times of great celebration. On this day, any dragonborn

able to do so seeks out a temple of Bahamut. There she is

celebrated, her sacrifice is acknowledged, and Bahamuts

choice is honored.

BAHAMUTS FIRST CHILD

Marlow Rodan was a human born into the village of

Larkspur at the base of the Camdelline Mountains. A

beautiful child, he looked at the world with wonder and

delight. Larkspur was a wonderful community to grow

up in. Although it was a largely human settlement, it was

near enough to a dwarf hold and an elf village to provide

a diverse experience. Marlow loved hearing the tales told

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

TARNISHED DRAGONBORN

As an individual dedicates her life to Bahamuts cause and

becomes a dragonborn, she is committing herself to fighting

against Tiamats spawn. She must do this to the best of her

ability. Reasonable breaks from this activity for gaining allies,

recuperating from battle, and gathering resources are permit-

ted, but any form of evil behavior is not.

The Platinum Dragon does not tolerate wicked deeds on the

part of his children. A single instance might be overlooked if the

dragonborn immediately makes good through an atonement

spell. Indulging unrepentantly in iniquity, committing repeated

forbidden acts, or converting to an evil philosophy provokes

Bahamut to anger and action.

most hideous of crimes, the dragonborn is first given a warn-

ing by the aspect and instruction in the proper course of action.

If she is penitent, the dragonborn must perform a redemptive

act to prove her reform, often in the form of a quest to slay a

particularly villainous spawn of Tiamat or to aid the cause of

one of Bahamuts allies.

If the dragonborn refuses to atone for her evil ways, Bahamut

renounces her as his child and takes back the dragonborn form

he granted her. A tarnished dragonborn feels her skin crack,

peel, and slough off. Her limbs twist, and her form distorts.

This painful process of transformation reversal lasts for a

number of rounds equal to her Hit Dice and deals 2d6 points

of damage per round. At the end of this change, regardless of

whether she survives, the dragonborn returns to her original

race and form.

In  these  situations,  an  aspect  of  Bahamut  (see  page  152)

appears  to  chastise  the  transgressor.  In  cases  of  all  but  the

by the elves and dwarves and grew hungry to see and

experience more of the world.

While still a teenager, he left his village and began to

make his way in the world, trading tales and songs for

food and shelter. Over time, he became quite a skilled and

traveled bard. No matter how far away he went, at least

once each year he returned to his beloved home village

to share his fortune and tales. Thus, he continued his

journeys with a glad heart, always grounded in the love

of his community.

Ten years after beginning his career, Marlow returned

home for another visit. While still miles away, he sensed a

hint of smoke on the late afternoon breezesmoke unlike

that of hearth and home. The scent carried the stink of

death. Instead of camping for the night, Marlow urged his

mount to a trot and hastened toward his home.

There, instead of the quaint homesteads of his family

and friends, he found chaos and utter ruin. The beautiful

village was reduced to ashes; those he loved were dead, all

brutally scorched by spawn of Tiamat. The draconic origin

of the attack was evident in the marks left upon structures

and  esh.

The townsfolk hadnt given up without a  ght, though.

One horrible creature, a perverted hybrid of a white dragon

and a praying mantis, lay dead among the fallen citizens.

It was still clear the villagers were overmatched and taken

by surprise. They had been easy prey.

Marlow was heartbroken, his soul torn. Full of pain

and rage, thirsting for vengeance, he prayed. He wanted

to avenge this injustice at any cost, caring not whether

he lived or died, only desiring to stop the foul creature

that had wrought such mayhem. He prayed but expected

no answer.

Then, the shadow of a great wing fell over Marlows

kneeling form. Marlow snatched up his rapier and looked

up, determined to make a stand before he died. As he stood,

he realized the shadow brought with it a great feeling of

comfort. Bahamut had heard Marlows plea and was moved

by compassion to respond.

Live, little one. You have lost too much already. With

me as your guide, you can be reborn as a draconic son,

able to thwart evil dragonkind. Thus Bahamut spoke,

and thus Marlow came to be reborn, the first son of the

Platinum Dragon.

TIAMAT AND BAHAMUT

One myth often related among dragonborn reveals an unusual

reason for the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat.

Long, long ago, Io created his first children, intent

on  perfecting  all  aspects  of  dragons.  His  first  child

was a striking creation, full of all the perfect, physical

characteristics of dragonkind. Io named it Vorel, which

means beautiful in Draconic. As it happened, Vorel

had very limited intellect and discernment. Vorel was

sweet-natured, bright-eyed, and eager to please, much as

a friendly dog is with its master. Though it was  awed, Io

still loved this little dragon.

Io  found  that  one  form  was  too  limited  to  contain

everything he wanted to include. So he made twoone

male and one female, one good and one evil. Embodied

in them were the passions and propensities of all dragons.

These offspring were Bahamut and Tiamat. Io intended

for the two wyrmlings to grow up together, learn from

each other, and eventually mate, bringing together all

the attributes of dragonkind. The children of Tiamat and

Bahamut would be wonderful, perfect dragons.

Instead of  lial love and affection, immediate rivalry

sprang up between the two. Their natures were too much

at odds to allow them to feel affection or even respect for

one another. Both of them sought Ios approbation and

competed for his favor.

Bahamut strove to gain his fathers good regard through

exemplary behavior, trying to be the noblest creature he

could be. Tiamat, on the other hand, used cunning and

caprice. After several schemes failed to raise her above

her brother in their fathers affections, Tiamat designed a

dramatic plot.

The wyrmling goddess endeavored to sow jealousy and

enmity between Bahamut and Vorel. She had Vorel destroy

some  of  Bahamuts  favorite  magic  devices.  Although

Bahamut merely reacted with regret at the loss of his

treasures, Tiamat told their father that her brother had

been enraged by the destruction. Then she waited until

a time when all others in the household slept the deep

sleep of dragonkind. She slew Vorel, Ios  rst creation, and

spattered some of her victims blood on Bahamut.

Tiamat knew that Io loved Vorel and anticipated that

Bahamut would be slain or at least exiled for his apparent

murder of the firstbornbut she erred. She supposed

that Io would react as she would to such an incident.

The Creator of Dragonkind, however, did not respond

with the shortsighted rage and impetuousness Tiamat

expected. Instead, his love for his children led him to

investigate and ascertain the truth. Grievously disap-

pointed, he banished Tiamat from his presence. He still

cared for and loved his daughter but could not continue

to foster her in his household.

With this rejection, Tiamats love for her father turned

to hate. She then decided to bring forth creatures of her

own and became the Creator of Evil Dragonkind. Bahamut

felt driven to oppose his sisters evil and became the King

of the Good Dragons.

In this way, Io lost his three childrenone to death,

one to evil, and one to good. Some say that he still hopes

to create a perfect race of dragons through the offspring

of Bahamut and Tiamat. The Great Eternal Wheel turns,

and Io is patient.

THE FORMER DRAGONBORN

The tavern was smoky, the light dim. Nerissa shook the

snow from her cloak and backpack as she shut the door

against the chilly night. Stomping her feet to both shed

the clumps of ice and restore some life to her frozen toes,

she scanned for a place near the crackling  re. She rubbed

the tips of her pointed ears, wondering if her mingled elf

and human natures would be an issue. Without saying

anything, one human got up, leaving his place near the

hearth for one at the bartaciturn in demeanor, but

friendly in deed.

The tavern was apparently a place where working folk

came to relax and do some serious drinking. Everyone

ignored her. Nerissa didnt mind; she just wanted to get

Wracked by grief, Marlow Rodan prayed

for revenge upon evil dragonkind

warm, eat some food, and continue on her journey. She

ordered a bowl of stew and a mug of ale.

Once her  ngers stopped tingling and she could hold her

spoon without shaking, she began to eat and take notice

of her surroundings. Murmured conversations around

her spoke of crops, spring planting, livestock, and a local

sport that involved a frozen pond, a ball, and an intricate

scoring system. This was a farming community, peaceful

and mundane.

Only one individual, other than she, seemed entirely out

of place. He was human, like most of the tavern patrons,

but his unkempt appearance gave him a disreputable air.

He sat alone at a table at the edge of the room. No one

greeted him or engaged him in conversation. He wore no

armor, but a greatsword in a leather sheath rested against

his chair.

Nerissa tried to assess if he posed a threat to her. Perhaps

he was a brigand? But no, he wasnt paying any attention

to her, a lone traveler. His gaze was  xed at some middle

distance, not looking at anything in his surroundings but

at some internal thought or memory, far from here. Her

instincts told her there was a story here, a good story.

She bought a pitcher of ale, walked up to his table, set

the pitcher on it, and sat down.

Nerissa noticed that he didnt have the scars or weath-

ered skin she expected of a warrior. He must have been

returned to life by powerful magic fairly recently. Indeed,

while his hands looked muscular, they didnt have the hard

calluses of a swordsman.

Looks like youre going through a hard time. Might help

if you talked about it. Im Nerissa, a listener by trade.

I was dragonborn, the stranger said with resignation.

He obviously expected ignorance or disbelief. Few folk

knew what a dragonborn was, but Nerissa did. She had

even met one on her travels. Indeed, Nerissa thought,

even if one did know the truth about him, this scruffy

human bore no resemblance to the great draconic emis-

saries of Bahamut.

What happened? she asked.

He sighed, took a long draught of his drink, and re lled

his cup. I failed, he said.

She looked at him encouragingly, leaned forward, and

tilted her head. Surely theres more to it than that.

He succumbed to her coaxing.

I was born a dwarf in the Ironforge Clan, the chief-

tains only son, and was named Orral, he said. I became

a  ne warrior. He studied his hands, shaking his head

in disapproval.

I was groomed for leadership. Everyone expected me

to succeed my father. Although I led a privileged life, I

wanted to do more. I craved adventure. For my fortieth

birthday, to celebrate my becoming an adult, my father

told me I could name whatever I wanted. I announced I

was going out to see the world.

He drank again. I was given the name Morkas, which

means bold seeker in Dwarven.

Nerissa gestured to the barkeep to re ll the pitcher.

The worlds a big place, Morkas said.

Nerissa nodded sympathetically at this insipid remark.

After a long pause, he began again. I saw much in my

adventures. What struck me most was the carnage wrought

by a black dragon. A hal ing caravan had been entirely

wiped out. Their little bodies . . . He balked at remembered

horrors, closed his eyes, and regained his composure.

Suddenly, I knew what I wanted from my life. I wanted

to stop this sort of awfulness. At that moment, I heard

Bahamut call to me, offering to make me his true son, to

better  ght evil dragonkind.

He smiled, for the  rst time since she sat down. It was

the  rst time in a long time, Nerissa speculated.

It was fantastic, he breathed. My new body was mag-

ni cent. Vigorous. I managed to accomplish so much. For

two years, I led a group that was able to do great things.

We protected a village from a green dragon. We defeated

a strange, red dragon-creature with many legs. Ah, the

times we had!

He sighed and looked at his empty tankard.

And then? Nerissa prompted. What went wrong?

I became overconfident. Prideful. We tried to take

on a green dragon. It was mightier than we suspected.

As we crept toward its lair, expecting to surprise it, the

dragon attacked us from behind. Totally unexpected. Our

wizard Natha died without ever having the opportunity

to cast a spell. The dragon went after the paladin next.

Once she fell, the other two scattered. I fought on alone.

It grabbed me and pinned me. The last thing I remember

is its stinking breath as it lowered its head to bite me.

Later, I learned that Tessa, our scout, had been eaten. Desig

the druid lost her dire wolf, but she managed to escape.

She searched for our remains and managed to retrieve

a  nger. Mine.

Reincarnated. Thats why youre human now, Nerissa

guessed.

Yes. Desig called me back to this body and left, saying

she never wanted to have anything more to do with dragon

hunting. Now, what am I? A failure. A miserable human.

No claim to clan and no claim to Bahamuts legacy.

But surely Bahamut would welcome you back. You could

undergo the Rite of Rebirth again.

He looked at her with despair. I know. Thats what Im

afraid of. . . .

LANGUAGE

Dragonborn speak Draconic whenever possible. To speak in

the tongue of dragons is to honor Bahamut, and dragonborn

prefer to converse in it with each other and on matters

of importance. However, they do speak other languages

when necessary. (For more information on Draconic, see

page 146.)

NAMES

Most dragonborn choose a new name upon completion

of their Rite of Rebirth. This name is always a Draconic

word or phrase that the individual feels epitomizes her

character. Many append their original birth race and/or

name to their new names after the Draconic word tibur,

which means born as.

In this way, names become very important to dragon-

born. Their names tell who they are and who they were.

Many choose the Draconic word for platinum (ux) as

part of their new name.

Dragonborn also add their accomplishments in the

service of Bahamut to their names. When one kills an evil

dragonblood, she adds  ntir (slayer of), tiathar if its

a spawn of Tiamat, and an identifying phrase, such as the

slain creatures name or some description of it. If an indi-

vidual has slain many similar creatures, her name includes

the number. A dragonborns name can also memorialize

other major events in her life, such as saving a village or

 nding a great artifact.

SETTLEMENTS

While  dragonborn  are  too  few  in  number  to  create

cities or even settlements of substance, they do gather

on occasion. Such gatherings are temporary encamp-

ments, staging areas from which to launch attacks on

evil dragonkind or places to regroup after a foray against

the spawn of Tiamat.

These  camps  provide  shelter  and  comfort  for  a

dragonborn  and  her  allies.  Since  the  purpose  of  the

temporary settlement is  ghting evil dragons or spawn,

the  dragonborn  in  charge  provides  central  leadership

and coordination.

These camps are heavily forti ed even if theyre only

intended for a few days of use. They are organized places

of defense. When possible, an encampment is square and

surrounded by a ditch. Often, the ditch has spikes that

deter charges.

Inside the ditchs perimeter is a short, encompassing wall

to provide shelter and cover. This wall is always patrolled.

Entrances and exits are in the center of one or more of the

walls sides. When it is feasible to build larger walls, such

as when numerous wall of stone spells are available, guards

patrol from the top of the wall or watch from atop struc-

tures with roofs designed to protect from aerial attacks.

Every possible form of attack is considered. The camp

provides strong defense from earthbound attackers and

adequate defense even against aerial assaults. The con ned

area in the wall is forti ed with shelter from an airborne

attack, while covered niches provide cover from breath

weapons. The enclosed nature of the camp also ensures

that those unnerved by a dragons frightful presence cant

run far.

EXAMPLE DRAGONBORN

ENCAMPMENT: VYTHS BASE

The dragonborn Vyth has established a base of operations

for a team of a dozen adventurers. The group is in a dan-

gerous region that is heavily infested by spawn of Tiamat.

Vyth plans to stay in this location for about a week before

abandoning the site.

Ditch

A ditch surrounds the encampment. In it, sharpened stakes

provide further deterrence to attack.

Walls

The walls here have been created using wall of stone spells.

Two sheltered areas provide cover from above. They also

serve as sturdy platforms from which guards can stand

watch. A few small outcroppings offer additional cover if

the outer perimeter is breached.

Tents

Four members of the group occupy each of the central

tents. The tent on the edge of the encampment is where

the shared resources of the group are kept, including battle

diagrams, extra weapons, and healing supplies.

Central Fires

This area is where communal meals are prepared. The  res

also provide comforting light and warmth on cold nights.

CREATING DRAGONBORN

CHARACTERS

Dragonborn  come  from  a  variety  of  occupations  and

backgrounds. They see the merits of diverse talents and

know the value in forming a versatile and balanced party.

Many continue to pursue the class or classes in which they

were trained before becoming a dragonborn. The beloved

of Bahamut can be from any class, but martial training and

perfection holds a particular allure for the dragonborn.

Re ned  ghting prowess always has merit in the battle

against the spawn of Tiamat.

Barbarian:  The  undisciplined  rage  of  a  barbarian

appeals to some dragonborn. They are mighty combat-

ants and a force to be reckoned with on the battle eld. A

dragonborns improved Constitution score enhances the

barbarians rage ability.

Bard: While not naturally charismatic, dragonborn

often take a leadership position. The talents of a bard nicely

support an adventuring party. Dragonborn bards craft and

recite stirring tales or songs about their struggles against

the spawn of Tiamat. A dragonborn knows a bard is good

for knowledge and for protecting a group and enhancing

its capabilities.

Cleric:  Those  who  were  clerics  before  becoming

dragon born usually continue to improve their miraculous

spellcasting and remain dedicated to their original deity,

unless that deity is evil. Some dragonborn clerics choose to

worship Bahamut, but they need not do so. A dragonborn

can honor the faith of any good or neutral god.

Chapter  6:  Character  Options  includes  racial  sub-

stitution  levels for any dragonblood cleric, including a

dragon born one.

Druid: A dragonborn druid keenly feels her tie to the

natural world. The spawn that Tiamat creates are warped

abominations, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance

of nature. Who better to stop them than one who is so

aware of whats at risk?

Fighter: Some poets have termed the dragonborn the

swords of Bahamut. Indeed, the children of the Platinum

Dragon are predisposed toward martial careers. Their

 ne, draconic bodies are quite suitable for the mastery of

soldierly skills.

Monk: The disciplined strength and dedication of the

monk works well with the dragonborns focused purpose.

Dragonborn monks have many advantages in the Dragon-

fall War, both in terms of mental discipline and  ghting

prowess. The classs good saving throws and ki strike are

great bene ts when  ghting evil dragonkind.

Paladin:  A  dragonborns  dedication  to  a  good  cause

often attracts those of lawful good alignment. For such

individuals,  service  as  a  paladin  makes  sense.  The  aura

of  courage  is  exceptionally  valuable  when   ghting  evil

dragons whose frightful presence can daunt all but the

most stalwart of allies.

For alternative options for a dragonborn paladin, see

the  dragonborn  paladin  racial  substitution  levels  on

page 108.

Ranger: Dragonborn rangers select dragons as one of

their favored enemies. They often scout for their allies,

excelling at tracking their prey,  nding lairs, and setting

up an ideal attack or ambush. The animal companion of

a dragon-hunting ranger is rarely part of a direct con ict

with  an  evil  dragon.  Many  experienced  dragonborn

rangers only have their animal companions with them

while scouting.

Rogue: The clumsiness of most dragonborns bodies

deters many of them from becoming rogues. However,

the class offers great skills for reconnoitering the dangers

of an evil dragons lair, sneaking inside the place, and

dispatching its resident with a quick strike to a vital area.

Hence, some dragonborn do become rogues.

Sorcerer: Dragonborn sorcerers feel an even closer

kinship with their adoptive father than those of other

classes. Reveling in their new identities as dragonblood

humanoids, dragonborn sorcerers take pride in their

arcane skills and what they have become as dragonborn.

Their attitudes and efforts against the spawn of Tiamat are

the most fanatical.

Chapter 6: Character Options includes racial substitu-

tion levels for any dragonblood sorcerer, including a

dragon born one.

Wizard: The adaptability of the wizard class means that

dragonborn wizards usually look to magic as the optimal

resource in the  ght against evil dragonkind. The class

has great power and many options.

DRAGONBORN IN EBERRON

Dragonborn  fit  well  in  Eberron  with  just  a  few  small  adjust-

ments. The conflict central to the dragonborns existence is that

between dragons and fiends, Eberron and Khyber, rather than

Bahamut and Tiamat. The dragonborn feel called by Eberron,

one of the progenitor wyrms, to serve. Their primary enemies

are the spawn of Khyber, including rakshasas and evil outsiders

of all sorts. The references to the Dragonfall Wars should be

interpreted as referring to the DragonFiend Wars.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

During the Rite of Rebirth, a candidates dragonmarks disap-

pear as the character transforms into a dragonborn and are

replaced by other feats of the players choice, as noted in the

Mechanics of Rebirth sidebar.

Dragons who avidly watch the lesser races and pay keen

attention to dragonmarks wonder at the fact that dragonborn

cannot retain or gain dragonmarks. Speculations abound, but if

any dragon knows the truth behind the loss of a dragonborns

dragonmark, that creature hasnt spread the news.

mong the humanoid races, spellscales are the

most creative, experimental, and varied. Most

generalities  about  spellscales  collapse  under

examination,  because  each  spellscale  displays

a  unique  philosophy  and  behavior.  Whats

most true of them as a group is that these dragonblood

humanoids have a very strong racial inclination toward

sorcery.

It has long been known that many sorcerers have dragon

blood in their veins. For the majority of these individuals,

their spellcasting abilities are often the only hint of their

draconic heritage, but sometimes the evidence is clearer.

Occasionally, when two humanoid sorcerers produce a

child, the infant displays decidedly draconic features and

physiology. The child is, in fact, a spellscale rather than a

member of either of the parents races.

In much more rare instances, a sorcerer of great power

produces such a child by mating with someone who is

not a sorcerer. To those who believe that some (or all)

sorcerers have draconic heritage, these children are strong

evidence of the theorys truthif such a childs draconic

characteristics did not come from the sorcerer, then how

else to account for them?

In certain situations, a spellscale infant might arouse

speculation about the mothers having mated with a dragon

and might be misidenti ed as a half-dragon.

Spellscales are, however, a distinct race. They breed true

among themselves and almost never interbreed with other

humanoids. In such an odd instance, any child produced

is a full-blooded spellscale.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Sjach sighed and rolled over, sleep releasing him from

its embrace. He reached out toward his new wifes side

of the bed, his questing hand finding only tousled

sheets. Cold. She must have gotten up some time ago.

He pulled the down comforter over his shoulders

and dozed.

When he  nally woke, the noontime sun shone

brightly in the room.

Which dragon shall I honor today? he mused. Sjach

liked to vary his daily blood-quickening meditations.

Its been a while since I considered Astilabor.

He thoroughly examined his wardrobe, mentally

valuing each article of clothing, tabulating the deca-

dent amount of money he had spent on the clothes he

wore when he decided to honor the Hoardmistress.

After  due  deliberation,  he  donned  a  sapphire-

colored, velvet doublet over cloth-of-silver leggings

speckled  with  moonstones  gained  from  a

succubuss lair. Around his shoulders, he wrapped

a cape made from pegasus feathers preened from

pegasi still serving the royal guard. He rounded out

the out t with goatskin boots and a similar belt that

hed won on a bet. He had done quite well as an  21

A spellscale selects his clothes for the day

adventurer. Nothing wrong with showing it off, especially

on a day dedicated to Astilabor.

Today, he had no particular plans. He left a note to tell

his bride hed be back later in the afternoon to  x them

both a lovely dinner.

He decided to meander down to the Everfull Mug. There

would inevitably be a game of cards going on, and Sjach

was the acknowledged local master of three-dragon ante.

There was gold to be made today, and Astilabor was the

perfect patron to have while doing it.

As he strolled along lazily, young voices shouting from a

nearby alley drew his attention. Sjach stopped and studied

the scene.

Freak! one boy taunted.

Your mama slept with a dragon, another jeered.

Dragon whelp, dragon whelp, dragon whelp, a pair of

girls chanted.

Sjach was debating whether to interfere when he heard

phrases he recognized. A bit too wordy and mumbled

rather than pronounced, but still a decent enough rendi-

tion. The bullying children dropped softly to the ground

in slumber. A young spellscale girl stood amid the sleeping

children, looking equal parts horri ed and proud of what

she had done. She glanced at Sjach, obviously afraid of

censure, and looked poised to run.

Well done, Sjach said. I dont think weve met before. Im

Sjach Thurkear, the Versatile. He offered her his hand.

She extended her hand warily, shaking with fear and

excitement. Sjach held it for a moment, his grasp warm,

strong, and reassuring. Livinia. My folks an me just moved

here, the girl said.

Sjach nodded. Perhaps youd like to attend the school

thats started up in the spellscale district? It focuses on

learning how to use your dragon blood, as you seem to be

doing with no small talent. Tell your folks to ask for Pearl

at the Nine Folio Dragon bookshop.

Livinia nodded and scampered off, eager to be gone

before her tormentors awoke.

Sjach left the sleeping children. He wondered what

theyd think when they managed to rouse themselves.

These wandering thoughts vanished when he saw the goal

of his jaunt.

At the Everfull Mug, Sjach looked around, pleased that

his entrance caused a few patrons to look up. It wasnt every

day that one saw a pegasus-feather cloak or such a handsome

spellscale sporting it. Many of the patrons knew Sjach,

though. A few called out greetings that he returned.

From a table near the back, Sjach heard the riffling

of  cards  and  the  chink  of  stacking  coins.  He  ambled

over to the table, giving friendly nods to the players.

A game seemed well under way. The cards were pretty,

with different types of dragons pictured on them. Sjach

watched  for  a  few  minutes,  mentally  noting  which

players would pose real challenges and which would

be easy pickings.

Everyone add two coins to the hoard, one player said

with a laugh.

Silver clattered onto the center of the table. A player laid

down a card and snatched up some cards from the middle

of the table. Then, another player placed a third card that

matched two others in front of her. The other participants

groaned and pushed stacks of coins her way.

Sjach was about to sit down when he overheard a voice

from nearby exclaim, Wyvern! Where are we going to

 nd a wizard willing to  ght such a beast? With a smile,

Sjach smoothed the scales of his eye ridges and turned

toward the speaker. Adventure beckoned.

Looking for an able-bodied and bold arcanist? he asked,

approaching a booth  lled with three adventuring types.

I am he.

A hal ing covered in dark leather and a well-dressed

human  wearing  a  prominent  symbol  of  Heironeous

gazed at Sjach for a moment and then turned toward the

other individual in the booth. Remarkable! Sjach thought.

De nitely dragonblood, but certainly not a spellscale.

He looked at the stern expression on the womans scaled

face. She was broad and powerful, shorter than a human.

Is this a dragonborn? Sjach had heard mention of them but

was not sure they were more than rumor.

The groups leader, for the deference of the hal ing and

human made her role clear, looked at Sjach for a long time.

Perhaps, she said. Perhaps you are. Im Vyth, called by

Bahamut to  ght the wicked spawn of Tiamat. Interested

in hunting a wyvern?

Sjach smirked and nodded. Eminently so, lady. Sounds

entertaining, to say the least.

By nightfall, they were camped miles away on the trail

of the beast. Vyth drilled everyone at length on suitable

tactics for the upcoming con ict.

As Sjach fell asleep, he realized that he had forgotten to

send word to his wife that he was going out of town. Ah,

well. Shell understand, he thought as he dozed.

APPEARANCE

Spellscales exhibit all the best characteristics of dragons

in a compact humanoid form. Their skin, formed of lus-

trous scales, comes in a wide variety of hues, including

nearly every color of the rainbow. No spellscale is merely

one color, but each displays a rich spectrum of variants

on his main color. A spellscale who is primarily green

might have patterns of a deeper, forest green over his body,

 ngernails and toenails of a slightly lighter green, and eye

ridges and nostrils that are a deep greenish aquamarine.

The coloration is complex, making a spellscale look much

SPELLSCALE RACIAL TRAITS

+2 Charisma, 2 Constitution. Spellscales are charming

creatures who often neglect their physical bodies while

pursuing intellectual or social interests.

Medium:  As  Medium  creatures,  spellscales  have  no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Spellscale base land speed is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: A spellscale can see twice as far as a

human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar

conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Humanoid  (dragonblood):  Spellscales  are  humanoids

with the dragonblood subtype. For all effects related to

race, a spellscale is considered a dragon.

Blood Quickening: Each day, a spellscale can perform

a draconic meditation to gain a bene t. Variations of

this meditation are described in the Blood-Quickening

Meditations sidebar, page 25.

Automatic Languages: Common and Draconic. Bonus

Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, and Hal ing.

Favored Class: Sorcerer. A multiclass spellscales sorcerer

class does not count when determining whether he takes

an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

AGE

Spellscales mature quickly compared to other humanoids.

Sorcerers of spellscale descent often start their adventuring

lives earlier than members of most other races.

HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

Unlike in most other humanoid races, spellscale females

tend to be larger than males. Spellscales stand as tall as short

humans, with little difference in weight between the sexes.

CLOTHING

Spellscales dress eccentrically, but their effusive charm

enables them to create pleasing looks. The fashions and

stylings they use are clearly and purposefully unconven-

tional. Every aspect of dressing is a variable that spellscales

experiment with.

Cotton, linen, silk, and wool are the basic building blocks

of  fashion.  An  almost  in nite  variety  of  fabrics  can  be

made from them, with varying degrees of softness, density,

weight, and  nish. Textures can be smooth or coarse. Fur

and leather come from many different creatures and can be

treated in many different ways. Even with all this variety,

spellscales often use unusual materials for their clothes,

including paper, feathers, and even woven hair.

Diverse spellscale tastes have also driven innovations in

the dye and pigment industry for many years. They have

provided the consumer demand and the  nancial backing

for  alchemists,  clothiers,  and  tanners  to  experiment.  A

dyes unique traits when applied to fabric can be as valuable

to a spellscale clotheshorse as the pigments rarity.

Colors can be solid, but stripes, checks, houndstooth,

and herringbone are only a few of the many patterns into

which thread or yarn can be woven to produce cloth. An

incomparable  hue  woven  into  an  original

pattern can set a spellscale dandy apart

from his peers.

Clothes can be perfectly tailored

to  t ones body, but just as inter-

esting to the spellscale is clothing

that is intentionally too big or too

small. An oversized white jacket

that looks as if it would  t an ogre

makes a memorable statement on a

lithe spellscales frame.

Long robes, tunics with many pock-

ets, trousers featuring numerous straps

and bucklesspellscale styles are as

numerous as snow akes in a blizzard

and just as unique. In addition to cre-

ating  their  own  fashions,  spellscales

happily  choose  from  among  all  other

humanoids styles. Spellscales enjoy both

selecting  which  articles  of  clothing  to

wear and mixing or matching each piece.

One out t might be a purple velvet doublet

over dazzling white breeches made from the

tanned hide of a frost worm, with boots made

from purple worm skin and girallon fur. An-

other  spellscale  might  garb  himself  in  plain

brown  robes  with  fur  trim  and  lining  made

from rats captured at the local docks. The ensembles look

striking and are often attractive, but they clearly show a

whimsical, novel approach to fashion. Spellscale clothing

might be admired, but its too odd to set many trends.

A typical spellscale

looks like this . . .

GROOMING

In personal grooming, spellscales utilize as much creativity

as they do with their attire. While individuals tend to keep

themselves  very  clean,  spellscale  grooming  techniques

allow for nearly in nite variations on ones appearance. A

spellscales innate vanity is often overcome by his desire to

make a statement with a new method of body adornment.

Spellscales have developed ways to highlight and tint

their scaly skin, much as other humanoids can color their

hair.  Grooming  options  for  their  scales  include  simple

lotions and creams that give a glossy sheen to their skin.

This gloss is often tinted with colors hinting at any of the

24

chromatic or metallic dragons. Those seeking hues that are

more daring often choose amber, violet, or a pastel color.

Such tinting lasts for six to eight weeks.

Some spellscales have just the tips of their scales tinted

or tattooed. Simple lines serve to give depth and de nition

to scales. Putting a wavy pattern on the edges of scales

lends a softer, almost ruf ed look.

Tattoos offer even more options to audacious spellscales.

The permanent nature of a tattoo proves no deterrent to a

spellscale who decides to acquire one. A tattoo is seen as a

great way to capture a moment or a feeling that one wants

to remember forever. Spellscale tattoos also re ect current

fashions and popular trends at the time of inking.

Given the changeable nature of a spellscales affections

and interests, tattoos provide a unique record of his life. They

might offer tantalizing hints to an observer. A sedate, soli-

tary spellscale known for his conservativism and his views

opposing intoxication might have a tattoo on his right

arm that reads Dont hesitate! and sport the em-

blem of the Tipsy Dragon Brewery on his neck.

These tattoos suggest that the spellscale wear-

ing them was not always so straitlaced.

Of  course,  numerous  ways  exist  for

spellscales to rid themselves of their tattoo

chronicles. The simplest and most often

used way to do away with unwanted

ink is to incorporate a dated tat-

too into a larger design, using

some of its existing lines and

 lling in others. Simple illusion

magic or items can be effective,

if  temporary,  ways  of  altering

these mementos. As an expensive,

extreme measure, some spellscales

resort to a regenerate spell.

Spellscales use their hair as an-

other way to show off their originality.

They test variations of hairstyles, including

curling, straightening, braiding, dreading,

and shaving. Many dye their hair. Some opt

for garish colors such as purple, yellow, and blue.

Color combinations tend to be popular. These are

sometimes modeled after other creatures, such as

couatls, tigers, or even phase spiders. Of course,

hair dyes need not color ones entire hairdomany hair

treatments just use one or more streaks or highlights.

PSYCHOLOGY

One cannot understand the concept of free-spiritedness unless

one has met a spellscale.

Enialis the Erudite, loremaster

Of all the wondrous aspects of the world, the most exqui-

site is magic. Spellscales feel the pull of their dragon

blood toward the magic that suffuses their very beings.

Magic sings and thrums throughout the multiverse, but it

resonates more strongly and purely in the spellscale race

than it does in any other humanoids.

Spellscales  are  perpetually  curious  and  full  of  wide-

eyed wonder at the beauty and diversity of life. They seek

BLOOD-QUICKENING

MEDITATIONS

As  part  of  his  daily  introspection,  a  spellscale  focuses  his

mind  with  mental  exercises  for  one  hour,  attuning  him  to

benefits tied to one of the dragon deities. This blood-quick-

ening meditation, as it is called, centers a spellscales mind

on his sorcerous nature and enhances it by connecting it to a

draconic divinity.

Each day, a spellscale chooses one meditation to perform

and can gain no other benefits from another meditation until

the next day.

(cid:129)  The benefits of the performed meditation last for 24 hours.

(cid:129)  Meditations that grant a bonus on a check provide a racial

bonus equal to half the spellscales character level.

(cid:129)  Feats gained are temporary but otherwise treated as if the

spellscale  had  taken  the  feat,  except  that  having  the  feat

in  question  doesnt  count  for  the  purpose  of  meeting  any

requirements or prerequisites.

Sample Meditations: Cutting an apple and watching it brown

and decay for an hour is how one spellscale honors Falazure.

Another regales the other patrons at an inn with the tale of his

encounter with a ghostly dragon.

Garyx: Considering the power of the All-Destroyer evokes

ways in which to broaden the power of spells, especially the

destructive kind. A spellscale who performs the meditation of

Garyx can use the Widen Spell feat twice on that day.

Sample Meditations: One spellscale creates a beautiful, cal-

ligraphic interpretation of Garyxs name and holds the corner

of the paper as he slowly lets it burn to ash. Another contem-

plates the howling winds of Pandemonium and wonders if they

drove Garyx mad.

Hlal:  When  a  spellscale  performs  the  meditation  of  Hlal,

he revels in the expansiveness of life and indulges in a grand,

hyperbolic  consideration  of  existence  and  magic.  He  gains

a bonus on Perform (storytelling) checks and the use of the

Heighten Spell feat three times on that day.

Sample  Meditations:  The  most  customary  meditation  in-

volves  rehearsing  or  telling  a  story,  especially  a  funny  one.

A  spellscale  in  a  more  serious  mood  might  contemplate

what restraints he has on his life and how he might remove

them.

The meditations are individualized according to the dragon

deity  and  to  suit  the  particular  spellscale.  Each  spellscale

performs  the  blood-quickening  meditation  differently  each

timethe important thing to the spellscale is to sharpen his

wits and focus his power. The meditation need not be a soli-

tary exercise. Sometimes a spellscale involves members of his

household or other companions in these mental calisthenics.

Most spellscales try to perform each different meditation at

least once every year.

Aasterinian: When a spellscale focuses on this whimsical de-

itys trickery, originality, and quick thinking, he gains a bonus

on Disguise checks and the use of the Improved Counterspell

feat three times on that day.

Sample Meditations: A spellscale tries to sneak into a library

of  arcane  lore.  Another  spellscale  endeavors  to  figure  out  a

new way to use his silent image spell.

Astilabor:  Focusing  on  the  Hoardmistress  brings  about  a

sharpened  perception  of  the  value  of  things.  The  spellscale

gains a bonus on Appraise checks and has unlimited use of

the Eschew Materials feat for the day.

Sample Meditations: To honor Astilabor, one spellscale goes

through  all  his  gear,  evaluating  its  quality.  Another  adds  up

all the treasures he and his party have acquired over the past

month.

Bahamut: Meditating upon the King of the Good Dragons

enhances a spellscales ability to oppose evil creatures. When

he  casts  a  spell,  he  can  choose  any  creature  targeted  by  or

within the area of that spell. If the selected creature is evil, the

spell deals 2d6 points of damage to it in addition to the spells

normal effects. A spellscale can use this ability three times on

the day this meditation is performed.

Sample  Meditations:  One  spellscale  chooses  to  spend  an

hour with his dragonborn friend, asking her what it was like to

be called by Bahamut. Another contemplates the differences

between the various metallic dragons.

Chronepsis: Meditation upon the Silent imbues a spellscale

with a bonus on Listen checks and the use of the Silent Spell

feat for the day.

Sample Meditations: One spellscale spends an hour of medi-

tation in silence. Another contemplates how difficult it must be

for the Watcher to merely observe without ever interfering.

Falazure: Focusing upon the Night Dragon attunes a spell-

scale to the immensity and power of death. He can treat all

inflict spells as being on his spell list for the purpose of using

spell completion and spell trigger magic items on that day.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Io: A spellscale who considers the role of the Great Eternal

Wheel in the multiverse acquires insight into the workings of

magic. He gains a bonus on Spellcraft checks and the use of

the Empower Spell feat three times on that day.

Sample Meditations: The multicolored and metallic disk that

is the holy symbol of Io is an ideal meditation tool. Its colors

change  and  shift  slightly  in  different  lights  and  at  diverse

angles. Many spellscales spend their meditation hour staring

at the disk as they slowly rotate it.

Another common meditation is for a spellscale to wonder if

he has ever met Io, since the Swallower of Shades can appear

as any sort of draconic creature. The spellscale considers all the

dragons or dragonblood creatures he has ever encountered.

Lendys: Contemplating the Scales of Justice requires a still-

ness of mind and body. A spellscale who does so gains a bonus

on Concentration checks and the use of the Still Spell feat for

the day.

Sample  Meditations:  Spellscales  usually  discipline  their

bodies when honoring Lendys, sitting still for a time or per-

forming  slow,  gentle  exercises.  Another  method  is  to  use  a

balance scale and measure out two different materials, trying

to get them to balance, such as a gold coin on one side and a

bouquet of flowers on the other.

Tamara: Meditating about Her Mercy renders a spellscale

better able to sustain life and thwart death. He treats all cure

spells as being on his spell list for the purpose of using spell

completion and spell trigger magic items on that day.

Sample  Meditations:  During  a  meditation  devoted  to  Her

Mercy, a spellscale often creates a plan of self-improvement.

Alternatively, he might visit an infirmary and tend the sick.

Tiamat:  Focusing  on  the  Creator  of  Evil  Dragonkind  en-

hances a spellscales ability to oppose good creatures. When

he  casts  a  spell,  he  can  choose  any  creature  targeted  by  or

within the area of that spell. If the selected creature is good,

the spell deals 2d6 points of damage to it in addition to the

spells normal effects. A spellscale can use this ability three

times on the day this meditation is performed.

Sample  Meditations:  Contemplating  Tiamat  might  include

admiring the quantity and diversity of her spawn. Another ap-

proach is to create or further some subtle, evil plot.

encounters of all sorts to broaden their understanding.

Anything and everything can attract a spellscales curios-

ity. No matter how objectively lovely or horri c an object,

creature, or experience is, it merits deep attention. The

myriad colors of a sunset, the whorls and patterns on a

humans  ngertip, the fur and feathers of an owlbear, even

the diversity of sizes and shapes of a gibbering mouthers

many mawsall these phenomena are unique, noteworthy,

and attractive to a spellscale who might later incorporate

these details into song, art, or even dance.

Despite spellscales deep-seated curiosity and fascination

with exploration, they do not act foolishly. Although one

might admire the fur and feathers of an owlbear, he has

the common sense to render the creature harmless before

examining it in detail.

Spellscales curiosity is not limited to the outside world.

Even as toddlers, spellscales expend a great deal of time

and effort on self-analysis. They focus their atten-

tion  on  their  bodies  and  minds.  Spellscales

listen to their heartbeats and breathing when

at  rest  and  after  vigorous  activity.  They

heed their true thoughts and feelings, ex-

pressing them when doing so is prudent.

What  pleased  me  today?  What  angered

me? What bored me? How can the next

day include more of the interesting and

less of the dull?

Most spellscales spend part of each

day  in  introspection,  examining

the physical, mental, and emotion-

al changes their recent experiences

have wrought. They then focus their

energy  upon  the  coming  day  and

prepare to face it by dedicating them-

selves to one of the draconic gods.

This blood-quickening meditation

can center on any dragon deity,

not  necessarily  one  of  an  align-

ment compatible with that of the

meditating spellscale. See the Blood-

Quickening Meditations sidebar for

more information.

LIVING WITHOUT APOLOGY

OR EXPLANATION

While a spellscale meditates and seeks inner truth, he

views his interpretations as subjective. He lives life without

lingering regret. After all, everything he has experienced

or done has contributed to the individual he is today. A

spellscale is usually happy with who he is.

Apologies

A spellscale cant bring himself to apologize for anything.

Perhaps the outcome wasnt what he anticipated, but trying

the action was what he fully intended to do. One shouldnt

apologize for something one meant to do.

Parents of spellscale children quickly learn that demand-

ing their child apologize for any action either leads to a

rebellious but truthful refusal or a white lie. False apologies

become more apparent when the child resumes the activity

that prompted the situation in the  rst place.

Parents of a spellscale child soon come to learn that

telling their child to behave well is practically fruitless.

The equivalent spellscale parental saying is, Be wise.

Roleplaying Application: Most of the time, dont offer

apologies. If one is demanded of you, be very speci c about

what youre sorry about. Dont apologize for what you did;

apologize for unforeseen or unwanted consequences. Thus,

after unintentionally catching a couple of companions in

the area of your  reball spell, dont say, Im sorry I cast that

spell. You might say, Its unfortunate that you got hurt.

This statement expresses a truth but doesnt admit to any

culpability or regret.

Explanations

What use is it to give an explanation after you do some-

thing? What did you do? Why did you do it? Most of the

time, what people want to hear isnt what really

happened.  Someone  doesnt  always  know

why  he  did  something  at  a  particular

momentit simply seemed a proper

thing to do at the time. However,

when asked, a typical nonspellscale

creates some plausible explanation

to placate the hearer. Spellscales

dispense with much of this social

baggage by often simply refusing

to answer.

Roleplaying  Application:

Dont bother to explain yourself.

If  you  are  asked  why  you  did

such-and-such or what you were

thinking  at  a  particular  time,

merely  smile,  shrug,  or  ask  the

questioner what it is she expects

as  an  answer  or  why  she  cares.

Whatever happened, its over and

done.  If  you  ever  find  yourself

forced  to  give  an  explanation,  either

be truthful or so outrageously untruth-

ful that it mocks your interrogator.

SPELLSCALE LIFE

Spellscale emotion and behavior is the triumph of sensibility

over common sense.

Finstarian, the Wronged

The only constant is magic.

Spellscale adage

Spellscales  approach  life  with  intensity,  always  living

in the now, and caring little about the past or future. A

spellscale wholeheartedly pursues whatever hes doing at

the moment. His current career, hobby, or relationship is

of paramount importance. He ardently believes whatever

he professes and what he values at any particular time is

permanent for him. That is the truth of the moment.

With the exceptions of sorcery and family, spellscales

never pursue the same objective or feel the same way

for very long, though. Their interests change, they grow

bored, or they simply  nd something or someone newer

. . . or this . . .

and more intriguing. This change is sometimes made in

a carefree manner and sometimes with deep regret.

To an outside observer, an obvious tension exists between

a spellscales ardent pursuit of the moment and the mercurial

nature of his desires. An impartial and ignorant observer

might assume that whatever a spellscale is wrapped up in

is a constant passion or a lifelong pursuit. Anyone with a

modicum of insight about the race, however, knows that

a spellscales focus inevitably changes.

Crucial to comprehending spellscales as a race is under-

standing that they truly dont see things that way. Their

hearts and minds tell them that now is the ultimate

truth and will remain so forever. Even if one points out

to a spellscale the transitory nature of his past interests,

the spellscale always feels that this time is different. This

time, its permanent.

LEISURE

Spellscales enjoy leisure. They use their free time in a great

variety of ways, depending upon each individuals current

philosophy and temperament. One spellscale might lead a

highly ordered life in which he maximizes every moment

of time. For him, everything must have a purpose, a stance

rather like the dragonborns philosophy. Another spellscale

might indulge in hedonistic activities, putting personal

comfort and pleasure above all other concerns.

GAMES

Spellscales  love  board  games,  dice  games,  card

games, social games, and roleplaying games.

They especially enjoy games in which both skill

and luck affect play. These are the richest of

experiences, enabling the use of strategy and experimenta-

tion while maintaining an element of chance.

It should come as no surprise that the game of three-

dragon ante is a spellscale favorite. This card game combines

the luck of the draw with both strategic and tactical play.

Spellscales happily spend hours at a time wrapped up in

this fanciful diversion.

Roleplaying Games

Spellscale children love to test different ideas and diverse

roles. They regularly play Lets Pretend games, adopting

roles as varied as grocer, town guard, blacksmith, parent,

and adventurer.

When adopting a role, a spellscale shows a great deal

of imagination and creativity. He wont necessarily heed

traditional ideas. Gender roles are bent or broken. Physi-

cal realities are disregarded. Thus, a puny, sickly child

could gleefully pretend to be a beefy guard, a boy might

play at being a mother, or the biggest child might make

believe hes a mouse being chased by the other children

playing as cats.

Rules in these games are  uid, amounting to whatever

the children agree upon at the moment, and are quite likely

to change several times in one play session.

Ruler for the Day

the children draw lots to see who gets to be the ruler that

day. The elected ruler makes all the decisions within the

childrens purview, dictating how the day is spent, what

games to play, how chores are done, and who has to do

them. In this way, spellscale children experience both

leader and follower roles. At one time or another, they act

as oppressors or liberators, slave masters or slaves, caring

representatives or ruthless autocrats. Most of them learn

that its better to be reasonable, fair, and kind than arbitrary,

ruthless, and mean, but also that every viewpoint has its

merits and  aws.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Naturally gifted as performers, most spellscales  nd poetry,

song, and music suitable venues for expressing

themselves. With or without training, a spell-

scale enjoys experimenting in a variety of

artistic disciplines.

Some become bards in the colloqui-

al sense of the word, meaning general

entertainers. Few actually become spell-

casting bards. The limited potential of

the bard compares poorly to the heights

attainable by a sorcerer.

Spellscales take on a wide variety of

activitiespainting, sculpture, knit-

ting, armorsmithing, alchemy, and

more. One spellscale might try all

these pursuits. He intensely en-

gages in an activity for as long

as it interests him, moving to

new hobbies as they capture

his attention.

Even though they often only

dabble in their pursuits, spell-

scales  do  develop  remarkable

innovations. For instance, Terithx, a

spellscale architect, was learning how

to play the  ute while he was designing

a  stronghold  set  on  a  windy  mountain top.

He  merged  his  interests  and  crenellated  the

battle ments in such a way that they played a pleasing,

melodious tune when the wind blew through them.

. . . or this . . .

Other spellscales view a spellscale without magical

abilities as inferior. All else in a spellscales life might

come and go. His fascination with and devotion to magic

is eternal.

LOVE

Love. The penultimate sensation, second only to magic.

Spellscale aphorism

Emotionally, spellscales are perpetually adolescent.

Saluraropicrusa, wyrm bronze dragon

Sensibility, not sense, rules spellscales in matters of affection.

They feel love and other emotions with grand intensity.

Family

Spellscales dont hatch from eggs. They en-

ter the world as live births. Like most other

children,  spellscales  have  a  strong  and

abiding affection for their birth families,

especially their mothers. Its a connec-

tion of both blood and emotion. They

sometimes honor, sometimes disobey,

occasionally even hate, but ultimately

and always deeply love their par-

ents and children.

This  familial  devotion  pro-

vides  a  rare,  stable  aspect  to  a

spellscales emotional mayhem. To

a spellscale, family is, well, family.

You love, accept, and support your

family, no matter what they are. Af-

ter all, even if one holds con icting

views with ones brother, those views

are bound to change eventually.

Perhaps one spellscale supports a

righteous cause while his sister is part of

the opposition. So what? Even when philos-

ophies are entirely incompatible, siblings are

more apt to gather for a family holiday and share

a meal than to come to blows in armed con ict.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Magic encompasses all universal truthsit is life, and light,

and love.

Praxis, spellscale archmage

To a spellscale, technology has some merit. Some sci-

enti c  advances  produce  novelties  and  amusements.

Magic, however, is the ultimate achievement. It is elusive

yet  attainable,  devastating  and  marvelous.  Invariably,

spellscales approach magic with passion and a dedication

unusual for their kind.

Magic is part of a spellscales very being. He feels it with

every blink of his eyes and sees it in every aspect of the

world. It is to be felt and experienced. A spellscale pursues

magic as ardently as a paladin does righteousness. This

need goes beyond mere intellect and is part of a spellscales

naturehe craves it as a vampire craves blood.

Romance

Give me sweet love or bitter pain. Never curse me with mere

contentment.

Spellscale aphorism

Few aspects of life offer as much intensity as love and

romance. Spellscales enjoy romantic love to the utmost,

approaching it with the same wide-eyed curiosity and

desire to experiment with which they view the rest of

life. They delight in new relationships, from the frisson of

initial attraction to getting to know a prospective partner

and all the delights and perils of falling in love. Spellscales

revel not only in the joys of new love, but also in the pains

of heartbreak, rejection, and betrayal.

Most other individuals cant quite grasp spellscales

romantic melodramas. A spellscales emotional history

seems like a confusing and poorly written serialized play.

He falls in love with someone, starts a relationship, grows

bored, falls out of love, and ends the relationship. Next, he

10/25/05   12:04:34 PM

falls in love with another, but that individual is already in

a relationship, so he worships silently and painfully from

afar. Eventually that individual becomes available, but the

spellscale is no longer interested. He then courts an elderly

spellscale, marries, and abides devoted and faithful until

his spouse dies. A long period of celibacy and mourning

follows. Eventually, love strikes the grieving widower.

This time, he falls for someone who proves unfaithful

repeatedly. Totally devastated, the betrayed spellscale seeks

solace in anothers arms.

These tales of love won and love lost, of betrayal and

grief, seem almost farcical to members of more emotion-

ally stable or sedate races. The most important fact to

understand about spellscales is that they are always sincere.

They really feel their professed emotions, and they never

outgrow this intensity.

SPELLSCALES AT WAR

Quick to war, quicker to peace.

Dwarf saying about spellscales

Spellscales play at war, as they do most other aspects of

life. They often  nd battle and war acceptable responses

to provocation and threats. Sometimes they even start the

altercation. No matter what their motivations, each con ict

 nds spellscales rallying both for and against the cause.

For as long as a spellscale holds a belief or philosophy,

it becomes his one true path, even though in a years time

he might hold different views. Some spellscales are keen

to assert or defend their paths, willing to risk death to

preserve current beliefs. Intense creatures, spellscales do

kill and die for their ideologies.

While spellscales may feel an initial thrill at going to

war, they usually tire of battle quickly. Prolonged suffer-

ing and needless bloodshed can persuade the staunchest

spellscale that his views might need some examination

and alteration. Such changes of heart often lead to the

cessation of war.

DEATH

Death is yet another adventure, but it presents an obstacle

to worldly desires and pursuits. Spellscales usually return

to the call of a raise dead or resurrection spell, feeling that

they died prematurely. The joy and strife of living is better

than the afterlife.

However, death speaks to the spellscales sensibilities.

They greet the passing of a loved one with a great deal of

pomp, sincere grief, and histrionics. Funerals and memo-

rial services are elaborate affairs designed to celebrate and

exemplify the life and interests of the departed. Since a spell-

scale might have indulged in many different pursuits and

friendships over the course of his life, tributes can be very

long and complicated. Often, eulogists use a chronological

approach, scheduling speci c times for different eras of the

dead spellscales life. Mourners usually show up during the

intervals devoted to the times when they associated with

the spellscale. In general, only the family and the closest

friends of the deceased attend the entire homage.

Having allowed their natural amorality to become twisted,

some spellscales become interested in what eternal undeath

has to offer. Worse fates can be had than becoming a lich

or a vampire. Such a form just lends another aspect to the

experience of existence.

CHANGEABLE RITUALS

Spellscales place a strong emphasis upon ritual. Each

spellscale adopts a personalized, precise way to accomplish

any task. What is done and the way in which it is done is

highly individualized.

One spellscale might have an eating ritual in which

food is consumed in a particular order. Perhaps foods are

eaten in order of colorall dark-colored foods consumed

first, followed by dishes lighter in color. Another indi-

vidual might always read a book by starting with the last

chapter, then reading the rest of the book from the front

to the back. Not all rituals are about the order in which

something is done. This idiosyncrasy might manifest in

something as simple as only dressing in shades of blue or

as bizarre as speaking only in questions.

These ritualistic behaviors are as short-lived as any other

of a spellscales interests. After a few days, weeks, months,

or years, the spellscale tires of the sameness and makes

a change, possibly altering, reversing, or abandoning his

previously established pattern.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Mad, bad, and dangerous to know.

A saying about unruly spellscales

Spellscales  place  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  individual,

even above the community. They hold self-realization as a

major motivation. The world offers so much to experience,

to learn, and to feel.

Spellscale philosophy states that, since every individual

occupies a unique physical place in the universe, no two

individuals  can  ever  have  exactly  the  same  experience.

Everyone stands in a different place, making his angle of

perception different from that of every other. Spellscales

extend this philosophy of unique placement to the social,

emotional,  and  intellectual  dimensions.  The  differing

vantage points of each individual are what make him or

her unique. Spellscales value these differences and explore

them both through their daily meditations and through

seeking a diversity of actions and experiences. They call

this following ones blood.

Spellscales  value  differences,  but  they  have  an  odd

approach toward prejudice and intolerance. As a whole,

spellscale society accepts everything. Since its so thor-

oughly  part  of  spellscale  nature  to  experiment,  going

through different fads or phases of philosophy, tolerance

tends to be the default attitude. However, as part of a spells-

cales personal growth, he might adopt an extremist view,

perhaps a prejudice based on culture, race, or alignment.

Spellscale  culture  tolerates  these  fringe  philosophies,

mostly because one spellscale has little power to enforce

his views on others. Other spellscales are busy with their

own pursuits.

Its okay to be a devout paci st who consumes only

food and drink that was created by magic because killing

anything, for food or otherwise, is abhorrent. Its equally

okay to be intolerant of such paci st magivores. Neither

spellscales physical mistreatment or oppression of the

other is likely to be allowed, however.

GOVERNMENT

Spellscales usually inhabit a land with its own system of

governance, law, and taxation. Theyll do whats necessary

to get by as citizens of that land, but they have their own

ideas about government. Depending upon what the local

authorities are willing to put up with, a spellscale commu-

nity within a larger municipality has its own organization

and its own rulereither openly or in secret.

The caprice and individuality of the spellscale race is

nowhere so perfectly epitomized as in its form of govern-

ment. Every year, the spellscales in a community hold an

election lottery. In a public ceremony, a large, black box

is prepared. One gold bead is mixed with silver beads, the

lot equaling the number of adult spellscale residents of

the community. Every adult spellscale then pulls a bead

at random, and whoever pulls the gold bead is the new

ruler. This individual rules in whatever fashion he chooses

for one year. He has full authority and must

be  obeyed,  and  he  gets  to  choose  his

title (often King but sometimes as

quirky as Your Grand Pomposity

or as severe as Autocrat), advisors,

and staff.

The leader cannot alter two fun-

damental  rules.  A  new,  purely

random election must take place

the next year. Also, any spellscale

who wants to do so can move

away from the community un-

til the next election.

As can be expected from

such  a  random  process,

the  quality  and  inten-

sity  of  leadership  varies

greatly. One year, the rul-

er  might  not  do  anything,

making no rules and collect-

ing no taxes. The next leader

might  rule  with  an  iron  fist,

demanding military service and

taxes and imposing a tyrannical, bureau-

cratic government.

In general, spellscales find this diversity

intriguing  and  fulfilling.  Where  else  can

you live and experience such a multiplicity

of governments?

. . . or this . . .

SPELLSCALES

AND OTHER RACES

Spellscales view members of most other races as too lim-

ited in their perspectives and pursuits. No other race has

the spellscales natural inclination for sorcery. No other

race  nds the entire world so fascinating.

Dragonborn: Spellscales consider dragonborn distantly

related creatures, as a human might view a third cousin

by marriage. The dragonborns singularity of intention

interests spellscales, because every dragonborn seems to

30

have the same purpose and the same drive. Fascinating in

a way, if terribly dull.

Dragon-Descended: Spellscales share a kinship with

draconic individuals, since they both sprang unexpect-

edly from an otherwise normal society. Spellscales have

additional empathy for those with draconic heritage; most

spellscales are born to sorcerers and thus have an easier

time being accepted, but draconic individuals can be born

to nearly any parent. Half-dragons are so mysterious that

spellscales cant help but be interested in them, much to

the amused annoyance of most half-dragons.

Dwarves: Spellscales think dwarves are slowponderous

in their physical movement, their social bonding, and their

decision-making. Nevertheless, dwarves are mesmerizing

to observe in this slowness. A spellscale blissfully watches a

dwarf in action and often correctly predicts the outcome of

that action. Far from being boring, this activity is comfort-

able and reassuring, akin to rereading a favorite novel.

Elves: While elves have the right idea when it comes to

holding a  ne appreciation of magic, theyre too academic

in their approach to matters arcane. However,

everyone is entitled to his own eccentrici-

ties, and the elves racial penchant for

wizardry over sorcery is peculiar but ac-

ceptable. Aside from this, spellscales see

elves as graceful, free spirits who have a

love of life nearly equal to their own.

Gnomes: In their many musings, most

spellscales wonder what place gnomes have

in the multiverse. Spell-like abilities in a hu-

manoid race are unusual, but what real

good are a couple of cantrips and the

ability to talk to furry creatures that

live in the ground? Further, many

gnomes only dabble in spell casting

as bards, forever isolated from

the splendors of mighty mag-

ic. Most spellscales view these

sadly  hampered  humanoids

with a mix of pity and compas-

sion,  treating  them  gently,  as

one would a slow-witted child, to

be protected and educated.

Half-Elves: Most spellscales out-

look toward half-elves can be summed up

in  a  phrase:  charming,  quite  charming.

Half-elves have a resourcefulness born from

a mixed heritage. They have poise and personality.

And, like humans, a half-elf can do just about anything.

This  exibility and variability is to be respected.

Half-Orcs: A bit too crude and boorish to hold much

social attraction for spellscales, half-orcs nevertheless

prove physically fascinating. Not even half-orcs notice the

nuances of their physiology. A spellscale might marvel at

how one half-orcs lower teeth point inward and anothers

outward, or at just how capable a half-orc is in toe-to-toe

battle and feats of strength.

Hal  ings: Fellow storytellers and agreeable folk, half-

lings and spellscales get along well. Spellscales appreciate

how hal ings  ll many niches in the societies of other

races while retaining a distinct outlook.

Humans: Humans, with their nearly in nite diversity,

appeal to spellscales curiosity. Humans vary greatly in

their lifestyles, ambitions, and philosophies. Each

individual is unique and interesting.

The  human  race  is  young  com-

pared to dragons or dwarves,

adding to its charm. Spell-

scales treat humans with a

fond tolerance.

After the meditation ends, the prospective spellscale

bathes in a special mixture of fragrant salts, water, and

dragon scales for 24 hours, with a spellscale

ritualist standing over the water, chanting the

words of the rite. When the period of

chanting has passed, the character

arises from the bath. As he does so,

he  nds himself magically trans-

formed into a spellscale.

Prerequisites: Any willing

humanoid  can  undergo  the

Rite of Spellscale Assumption.

The rite must be performed

by a spellscale who can cast

the polymorph spell and who

has at least 10 ranks in Knowl-

edge (arcana).

Kobolds: These creatures

try hard as sorcerers, they

really  do,  but  theyre  far

too limited in their talents

and their worldview. The

kobold races inclination

toward both strict loyalty

and sociopathic behavior per-

plexes spellscales. How could

a race with so much potential

limit itself with such philo-

sophical baggage?

True Dragons: While spell-

scales admire and revere dragons,

ever curious about them, they feel no

particular attraction for them. A spell-

scale is naturally interested when presented

with an opportunity to investigate a dragons

lair or converse with a friendly dragon, but he is

equally fascinated to explore the nooks and cran-

nies of a human city or delve into the depths of the earth.

Spellscales acknowledge the link between themselves and

dragons, but they view themselves as something apart from

dragonsand possibly, in a small way, superior.

. . . or this . . .

OTHER RACES AND SPELLSCALES

Unlike dragonborn, characters of other races who are

drawn to the spellscale lifestyle and psychology cannot

merely undergo a ritual to become a spellscaleat least

such is the general belief. Because dragonborn can only

come into existence through a ritual, whereas spellscales

are born naturally, this belief has become entrenched. But

no arcane feat is beyond those with a will to make changes.

The Rite of Spellscale Assumption enables individuals of

other races to become spellscales.

Rite of Spellscale Assumption

The Rite of Spellscale Assumption is a rare procedure

that allows a character to fully manifest latent draconic

potential within his body, transforming from a member

of his original race into a spellscale.

Becoming a spellscale is a choice that is made only after

long consideration. Giving up ones heritage is not to be

done impulsively. It is a choice one makes knowing full

well that when the rite is complete, all vestiges of ones

former race are wiped away, replaced by a body and a look

that might at  rst seem alien and awkward.

When the rite begins, the subject spends six consecutive

days fasting and meditating on texts discussing spellscale

history, demeanor, and characteristics. The character uses

this time to fully get into the heart of what it means to

be a spellscale.

Bene  t: This ceremony con-

verts any nondraconic humanoid

into a spellscale. A character who

undertakes this rite is stripped of

all his racial traits, and in their place

gains the racial traits of the spellscale

race. See the Substituting Spellscale Racial

Traits sidebar for details.

Time: The Rite of Spellscale Assump-

tion takes seven consecutive days to complete.

The  ritual  cannot  be  conducted  on  an  unwill-

ing subject.

Cost: This rite requires special salts and a collection of

dragon scales gathered from ancient dragons of varying

colors. These materials cost 2,000 gp.

Magic is my religion.

RELIGION

Kepesk Maekrix, spellscale

Spellscales prize magic above all else, considering it holy

and giving it the reverence most other races accord to their

deities.  Certainly,  spellscales  believe  that  deities  exist.

Gods are powerful and awesome, but magic is too, in a way

that surpasses even the power of the deities.

Spellscales alternately honor all dragon deities through

their daily meditations. They gain great spiritual satisfaction

from their devotion to magic. Their rituals blend a sense of

divinity in with sorcery, uniting both spirit and blood.

Almost every spellscale goes through a religious phase,

indulging in short-term excesses of pious behavior toward

one god or another. During this period, many spellscales

devote themselves to a dragon deity, but some are attracted

to deities of magic. Boccob, the Lord of All Magics, is

especially attractive because of his permissive, hands-off

attitude toward his followers.

The exclusive, long-term commitment that most dei-

ties and churches demand of followers is dif cult for the

changeable spellscales to meet. Aside from the aforemen-

tioned bursts of piety, few spellscales consider themselves

ardent followers of any one deity, dragon or otherwise.

The rare spellscales who do follow one deity throughout

their lives are most often worshipers of Aasterinian. The

10/25/05   12:04:42 PM

Messenger of Io is more willing than many other deities

to indulge the spellscales changeable nature.

MAGIC WORSHIP

Many spellscales dont worship a specific deity. They

hold a much broader approach that worships magic as a

whole. This worldview holds that arcane magic inhabits

everything.  Magic  can  be  found  in  every  rock,  tree,

animal, and creature. Each of these objects and creatures

contains a soul or sacred consciousness formed of magic.

Practitioners of this belief system hold that arcane magic

binds the universe together.

Deities and demigods are very strong nexuses of this

arcane might. Whether a deity is or was a mortal being

or is merely a personi cation of an ideal means little to a

spellscale. Humans believe that its possible to ascend to

godhood, as St. Cuthbert did. Spellscale magic worshipers

also believe that if one is able to harness suf cient arcane

energy, one can become a god.

LAW AND CHAOS, GOOD AND EVIL

For every individual, one true morality exists, but for everyone

it is different. It differs both by the person and by the day. That

makes it no less true.

Spellscale aphorism

Spellscales are great experimenters. They feel that change

is a natural outcome of experience. As part of their lives and

personal growth, they often try out different worldviews,

philosophies, and alignments.

Spellscales are also tolerant of other worldviews. While

each makes determinations about what is good or right for

him or her as an individual, spellscales dont usually seek

to apply this philosophy outwardly. For a spellscale, right

and wrong is a personal matter.

HOLIDAYS

Spellscales  host  celebrations  and  holidays  at  irregular

intervals compared to other races. They make merry when

it suits them, involving family, friends, and the community

as they please. Its common for a celebration to start small

and grow large. One household might throw a party to

celebrate a daughters return from war. If the neighbors

hear of the festivities, they might come to welcome the

daughter home. News spreads, and soon its a community-

wide event, complete with banners and a parade.

Election Day

The most important and the only regularly celebrated

spellscale holiday is Election Day. The date of this celebra-

tion is variable. Its always held no more than a year after

the current spellscale leader took power, but because an

election is also held to replace a leader who dies, its not

always on the same date.

Election Day is a wonderful time in a spellscale com-

munity. All the businesses close down for the day, and a

party atmosphere ensues. The day is  lled with glorious

potential. Any spellscale might become the communitys

next ruler. Candidates for leadership spend the day telling

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

(cid:129)  If your original race granted you a nonspecific bonus feat (such

as the one gained by a human at 1st level), any feat can be lost,

so long as it is not a prerequisite for another feat you have.

(cid:129)  If  your  original  race  granted  bonus  skill  points,  you  should

deduct an appropriate amount of skill points from your current

skill ranks. The specific skills affected are up to you, but the

DMs  input  might  be  required  to  adjudicate  tricky  situations

(such as multiclass characters who might have purchased ranks

of various skills as both class skills and cross-class skills).

SUBSTITUTING SPELLSCALE

RACIAL TRAITS

The technical details of giving up your previous race and taking

on the aspects of the spellscale race are different from those for a

character who assumes a creature template. The Rite of Spellscale

Assumption does not add a template to your previous racial char-

acteristicsit replaces most of your original racial traits.

Racial Ability Score Adjustments: Remove your previous racial

ability score adjustments, replacing them with the spellscales

racial ability score adjustments. Recalculate hit points, attack

modifiers,  saving  throw  modifiers,  spells  per  day,  and  other

characteristics to reflect your new ability scores. If your Intel-

ligence changes, do not change your allocation of skill points;

simply use your new Intelligence score to determine skill points

gained for future class levels or Hit Dice.

Racial Hit Dice: You lose any racial Hit Dice from your previ-

ous race, as well as all benefits gained therefrom (base attack

and save bonuses, skill points, hit points, and so on).

Languages: You retain any languages you already know. You

gain Draconic as an automatic language.

Favored Class: You retain your original favored classes and

gain sorcerer as an additional favored class.

Level Adjustment: You lose any level adjustment from your

previous race.

Other Racial Traits: You lose all other racial traits from your

original  race,  including  size,  speed,  sensory  abilities,  bonus

feats,  skill  bonuses,  attack  bonuses,  save  bonuses,  spell-like

abilities,  and  so  forth.  Two  specific  instances  benefit  from

clarification.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

(cid:129)  If you no longer qualify for a prestige class, you lose the ben-

efit of any class features or other special abilities granted by

the class. You retain Hit Dice gained from advancing in the

class, as well as any improvements to base attack bonus and

base save bonuses that the class provided. If you later meet

all the prerequisites for the class, you regain the benefits.

The loss of racial traits might mean you no longer meet the pre-

requisites for a prestige class, feat, or some other feature. In gen-

eral, you lose any special ability for which you no longer qualify,

and nothing is gained in its place. A couple of exceptions exist.

(cid:129)  If you no longer qualify for a feat due to undergoing the rite,

you lose the feat and immediately select a new feat for which

you  qualify  in  its  place.  You  must  also  replace  any  feat  for

which the lost feat was a prerequisite.

After  removing  your  old  racial  traits  and  altering  other  attri-

butes based on those traits, apply the spellscale racial traits as

described in this chapter.

tales of all the wonderful, interesting things they would

do if chance favors them.

First Spell

Magic is central to almost every spellscales life, and this

importance is emphasized on the holiday called First Spell.

The day that a spellscale child learns to cast his  rst spell

is a day of joy. A celebration of the event indulges the new

spellcaster in every way. Its his special day. The spellscales

parents throw a party, inviting all the childs friends. Guests

bring gifts of spell components or focuses. No matter how

short the notice or how poor the guests pocket, everyone

brings something, be it as humble as a feather or as grand

as a large mirror suitable for a scrying spell.

New Spell

Spellscales love breakthroughs. When a spellscale discov-

ers a new way to shape magic, its a wonderful event. If a

spellscale creates a new spell, the community honors him,

and every member of the settlement gathers to see the new

magic demonstrated. The spellscale casts the spell and then

describes in detail what materials he used and precisely how

he was thinking, feeling, intoning, and gesturing. He repeats

this process as many times as he can every day for a week.

At the end of that time, he gets to give the new spell a name

that his community uses for it from that point on.

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE

The spellscales fascination with the world and themselves

has led to a rich and varied body of folklore. Spellscales view

these tales with nonchalance and acceptance, dealing with

each one as if it were true. A spellscale accepts paradoxes and

contradictions in folklore as a matter of course.

ORIGIN STORIES

Spellscales have a number of stories to ex-

plain the origin of their race. One of the

most widely told is presented below.

Magic the Entity

Magic is real, as we all know.

What  few  know  is  that

Magic is sentient. It has

thoughts  and  feelings.

Long,  long  ago,  Magic

existed  all  alone  and

all-powerful. One day, it

realized it was lonely, so

it created the multiverse

and all the magni cent and

horri c creatures and places.

It made some creatures, such

as dragons, intensely magical, and

others, such as dogs, with only the

magic of life itself.

This  activity  pleased  and  amused

Magic. For millennia, Magic watched the

grand panoply of the worlds events without

further interference. It observed, entertained

by  the  creativity  and  unpredictability  of  the

many things it made. It saw conflict and cooperation,

wars and peace, grand empires and humble households.

All provided pleasure to Magic. It did not judge what was

good or bad. Such petty distinctions matter to many of its

creations, but not to Magic. Magic loves everything.

Recently, however, Magic began to feel lonely again. It

wanted to create something new, something different, a

creature that would be a microcosm of the great multiverse.

Magic took a little bit of everything from the multiverse

and put it into one formthe spellscale. It made these

wondrous creatures and gave them to sorcerers of great

power who honor Magic best. It also made spellscales a

true-breeding race so that they can have more spellscale

children, providing Magic with new generations to ensure

the continuation of its masterpiece creation.

This story explains why a spellscale is so changeable in

nature. His soul is made of a great sampling of everything

in the multiverse. He is a little bit bad, a little bit good, a

lover, a hater, a creator, a destroyer, a warmonger, and a

paci st, accepting and rejecting every philosophy and

worldview because each one is both true and false.

RECENT HISTORY

As a new race, spellscales have just begun making their

mark on the world at large. The tale of one recent series

of events is recounted below.

Magehavens Militia

A group of spellscales settled together to form the com-

munity of Arcaniss Okarthel, more commonly called

Magehaven. They chose a sparsely inhabited area about

midway between a human village and an elf town. Once

they began to build on the land, both the humans and

the elves sent envoys to speak with them. The

land they had chosen for their home was a

contested tract that both groups claimed

for their own.

The elected leader of the spellscales

was a female sorcerer named Bensvelk

Renthij.  An  individual  with  strong  dip-

lomatic skills, she was able to diffuse the

tension and broker an agreement between

the three races called the Okarthel Ac-

cord. In return for permission to use the

land, the spellscales agreed to patrol

the surrounding area, reducing the

goblin brigand activity that had

been an annoyance to both the

humans and the elves. All was

well  in  Magehaven  until  the

next years election.

The  newly  elected  leader

was Darstrik Orn, a spellscale

with an unusually abrasive per-

sonality. He decided since he

hadnt been the one to sign the

Okarthel Accord, he didnt need

to abide by it. He disbanded the mili-

. . . or this . . .

tia, and the goblin activity resumed.

When the elf and human diplomats returned

to sort out the misunderstanding, Darstrik met

them  with  cold  words  and  an  immovable  mind.  The

envoys felt as if they had been tricked. They sought out

Bensvelk, who tried to soothe their anger. She did much to

assuage their apprehension, explaining the eccentricities

of spellscale government. Bensvelk started up an entirely

volunteer militia, and she enlisted many recruits to patrol

the area. After all, the patrols helped Magehaven at least as

much as the other humanoids. The diplomats eventually

departed, appeased but ill at ease.

Now, more of the world knows about spellscales and spell-

scale habits. As a race, they are viewed by most as unreliable

allies. Diplomats who knowor think they knowwhat

spellscales are about sometimes attempt to ensure that

every adult (that is, every potential leader) in a spellscale

community approves of any treaty and

agrees  to  honor  it.  In  such  a  situa-

tion,  the  diplomats  suppose,  a

newly  elected  leader  cant

disregard an agreement as

easily. In point of fact, how-

ever, any agreement made

by a spellscale is subject

to being rescinded at any

timea previous unanimous

vote notwithstanding.

LANGUAGE

Unquestionably, Draconic is the most

important language to spellscales. Its

the language of dragons and of mag-

ic. Spellscales also speak Common

and  other  languages  for  mundane

communication. (For more informa-

tion on Draconic, see page 146.)

. . . or this . . .

NAMES

Spellscales  born  to  spellscale  parents

usually  are  given  elaborate  names  in

Draconic. Their names re ect their parents

philosophy and interests at the time of the childs

birth. Its typical for these names to be idiosyn-

cratic. Many a spellscale has a name or part of a name

that translates from Draconic into odd aphorisms such as

Diamonds Are Forever or Barbarians Are Butch, haughty

statements such as Daughter of the Master of the Illusion

School or Prettiest Child, or even moment-dependent

sentiments such as Rainy Season or Blooming Daisies

in a Vase on the Windowsill.

Spellscales born to nonspellscale parents have names of

normal sort for members of their parents race. A spellscale

daughter born to an elf might be named Qillathe Liadon,

while one born to a half-orc sorcerer might be called

Ownka or Shautha.

Spellscales value their individuality and have distinctive

personalities. Along with that individuality comes more

than a touch of egotism. Most feel very strongly about their

names and representations of their identities. They enjoy

fame and recognition. Because of this, they never abandon

their birth names and family names, though they might add

monikers they earn such as the Brave or the Talented.

SETTLEMENTS

Spellscales dont easily  t into other races communities.

Theyre not constant or constrained enough in their phi-

losophies, feelings, and activities to be tolerated for long

by nonspellscale settlements. Its hardly surprising, then,

that spellscales form their own communities.

Often, these communities are districts inside a larger

town. Spellscales take over a neighborhood through a

variety of means, ranging from lawful purchases to shady

deals. Some cities set aside areas for spellscale habitation,

and this arrangement suits the spellscales well. Within

such localities, spellscales have all the resources and

amusements of a larger settlement along with a place that

fosters their individuality.

STANDARD OF LIVING

A spellscale community has a disproportionate

number of talented arcane spellcasters in its

population. Magic is commonplace. Spell-

scales like to show off, most especially

with their magical talents.

The communitys quality of life

is  enhanced  by  simple  aids  such

as  cantrips  and  unseen  servants.

Continual  flame  torches  serve

as ordinary lighting, and many

buildings are warded by alarm

spells. Travel by means of a mount

spell  or  even  phantom  steed  is

nothing unusual.

ARCHITECTURE

A  spellscale  community  is  a

wonder to behold. Each build-

ing reflects the personality of

the builder, as well as past and

current residents. In the space of

one city block, a tall inn with mina-

rets, gables, and numerous bay windows

might tower beside a plain, squat building

with  a  waterfall   owing  down  its  streetward

face. A stucco and oak-beam manor house with

mullioned windows seems quite ordinary beside a large,

smooth wall, likely the result of a wall of stone spell, paint-

ed with lovely landscapes in muted hues on one side and

bright graf ti on the other.

CREATING SPELLSCALE

CHARACTERS

Spellscales devotion to ful lling their magical potential

constantly comes into con ict with their desire to experi-

ment. Many dabble in another class or two. In this way,

they can still experience the power and wonder of the

highest degrees of magic while indulging their curiosity.

Very few spellscales sidetrack their sorcerer careers for

more than two levels.

Barbarian: Some spellscales enjoy the  erce, visceral

emotions that lend a barbarian his power to rage. The hardi-

ness of the barbarian is attractive to those who might view

themselves as fragile. However, while many spellscales toy

with the idea of becoming a berserker, only a few wind up

doing so.

Bard: A spellscales racial abilities make him a good

candidate  for  a  bard.  The  capabilities  offered  by  the

class can fulfill the spellscale desire for arcane magic

while providing some of the versatility and derring-do

granted by the rogue class. Some spellscales see a bards

spellcasting talents as second-class magic, fine for other

races but beneath a spellscale who is destined by birth

for better.

For alternative options for a spellscale bard, see the

spellscale bard racial substitution levels in Chapter 6.

Cleric: The variability of their temperaments and the

fact  that  typical  spellscales  try  out  several  dif-

ferent  philosophies  during  their  lifetime

makes spellscales ill suited for constant

devotion to one god or cause. The odd

spellscale does become a cleric. He

might  serve  one  of  the  dragon

gods, but such clerics usually have

their own specific worldviews,

rarely  selecting  an  alignment-

based domain.

Most  spellscales  dont  deviate

from their sorcerous pursuits to

become  clerics.  Others  might

dabble.  The  most  ardent  and

devoted  of  spellscale  clerics

become mystic theurges (DMG

192),  enabling  them  to  con-

tinue with both their sorcerer

and cleric spell progressions

simultaneously.

Chapter 6: Character Options

includes racial substitution levels

for any dragonblood cleric, including

a spellscale one.

Druid: Very few spellscales feel a call

to devote themselves wholeheartedly to serv-

ing the natural world. A spellscale can agree with the

desire for balance and dispassion, but he is more likely

to find it by experiencing the extremes rather than by

eschewing  all  radical  viewpoints.  Spellscales  are  too

filled with passion to deny themselves any particular

course of action, making the career of a druid a poor

choice for them in general.

Fighter: Most spellscales feel that the path of a  ghter

simply doesnt have enough variety to keep them inter-

ested for long. Why battle doggedly when you can have

the  ourish of a rogue or a bard? The truth is that their

generally low Constitution scores also drive spellscales

away from being the focus for incoming attacks. Almost

any spellscale, however, can bene t from taking a level

of  ghter now and again if he has any interest in up-front

physical combat.

Monk and Paladin: Spellscales are too capricious

to  adhere  to  the  stringent  paths  that  members  of  these

classes must tread. The commitment required of a cleric

is dif cult enough. Spellscales feel compassion for those

who follow the vocations of monk and paladin, because

such extremists only get to sample a small selection of

lifes great options.

Ranger: While most spell-

scales  prefer  the  variety  and

swirl of activity that are part

of aurban life, one who  nds

himself drawn to the mystery

of  the  natural  world  might

take up a career as a ranger,

at least for a time. Spellscale

rangers  often  specialize  in

dealing with and training animals,

taking  advantage  of  their  naturally

high Charisma.

Rogue:  Living  a  life  that  con-

tains a touch of danger is great for a

spellscale. Starting ones career

by  acquiring  a  grand  diversity

of skills is even greater. Quite

a  few  spellscales  begin  their

professional lives as rogues. The

diversity of abilities represented by

the rogue makes the class very attrac-

tive to spellscales.

Sorcerer:  The  thrum  and  tide  of

magic are in a spellscales very essence.

Spellscales are born to be sorcerers, and

they feel this compulsion on both an indi-

vidual  and  societal  level.  Sorcery  is  part  of

their  beings,  part  of  who  and  what  they  are.  Almost

all  spellscales  devoted  some  time  to  sorcerous  skills

during their lifetimes.

Chapter 6: Character Options includes racial substi-

tution levels for any dragonblood sorcerer, including a

spellscale one.

Wizard: Spellscales are naturals at wielding magic.

Its perplexing to them that some would choose to learn

their magic from books. Spellscales do see the value in

the variety of arcane knowledge a wizard learns, but rarely

pursue such studies themselves.

SPELLSCALES IN EBERRON

Spellscales fit into Eberron without any alteration. Sorcerers in

Eberron credit dragons as the source of their power, though they

generally mean the progenitor wyrms. A sorcerers child might

be born a spellscale.

in the Prophecy or if theyre just a peculiar side effect of the

Prophecy made manifest in the world.

Spellscales born into a dragonmarked family never possess

normal dragonmarks. They can become important members

of  their  houses  and  even  rise  to  positions  of  influence,  but

never to the level of a dragonmarked scion. A spellscale can,

however, take the Aberrant Dragonmark feat.

In Eberron, such an event provokes much speculation regard-

ing the draconic Prophecy. Its unclear if spellscales play a role

obolds  are  often  characterized  as   lthy  little

reptiles barely better than goblins. Theyre mali-

cious but of little actual menace. Catch kobolds

in their lairs, where they are almost certainly

hard at work mining, and such a description

might be  tting. No one ever suspected that

being underestimated was the kobolds goal.

Kobolds are meticulous creatures with sorcery in their

blood,  a  variety  of  reptile  with  a  strong  work  ethic.  Dis-

counted  as  pests  or  worse  by  many  others,  kobolds  are  a

long-suffering race with many talents and clever tricks. Only

the foolish overlook the threat that kobolds actually pose.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Ixen roused herself from sleep before the other members

of her party awoke, just as she had done after every sunset

on this journey. They were moving over windswept and

rocky hillsides now, the  nal leg of their journey. Without

any cover from the sun, they traveled only at night.

Earlier, Gix had tried curling up with Ixen, as did Oth after

 nishing his daytime watch for intruders. She drove them

both off. As the only female on the expedition, Ixen knew

the young males couldnt help themselves, but mating would

have to wait until after their mission was completed.

Ixen never had to take watch. She needed more rest

than the others, relying on it to refresh her blood and its

inherent magic. Awake, she sat and focused for several long

moments, priming her mind to make use of her arcane

talents throughout the day.

She noticed Svent standing nearby when she opened

her eyes. He had been watching over her as she medi-

tated. Svent was always vigilant, even when it was not

his turn to watch, and his dire weasel Kurik was no

different. They were the strongest among Ixens com-

rades. Ixen would make Svent her chosen one after

this mission, assuming he accepted her.

For now, Ixen directed her thoughts to the precious

cargo they were carrying. She stood and walked over

to Aurix, the second dire weasel and  nal member of

their group. There, she woke Gix and Oth and pushed

them both asidethey had moved over to Aurix for

heat against the chilly air of the foothills. Aurix sat

up  as  Oth  and  Gix  moved  away  and  exposed  the

special satchel bound around his chest.

Ixen opened the satchel and looked inside. Within

was an egg she had laid, a dragonwrought egg, a

blessing bestowed on some female kobolds. The egg

was quite mature now, showing a greater number

of azure spots than it had the previous day. Inside

the shell grew a kobold of dragon heritage blood

whose birth would be a boon to all kobolds.

Aurixs body heat nurtured the egg while they trav-

spending this much time aboveground, but no subterranean

passageways led from Ixens homeland to the sacred mine,

and failing to undertake the pilgrimage was unthinkable.

Dragon wrought kobolds have to be raised aboveground, where

they can learn to soar through the sky if they have func-

tional wings. The mountain temple was an ideal place.

The group set out at dusk, Svent riding Kurik up front,

Aurix  and  Ixen  beside  each  other,  and  Gix  and  Oth

bringing up the rear. They were a nights journey away

from the mountain temple now, and everybody was alert.

The sacred mine had been cut off from kobold lands by

a gnome army assisted by their dwarf cousinsgnomes

could be encountered anywhere in the area.

Gix and Oth were irritable, having been rebuffed by

Ixen once too often on this trip. In the hours before dawn,

the two taunted one another until a brawl  nally erupted.

Svent and Ixen stopped to wait, knowing the frustrated

younglings needed to get this out of their systems.

Just as Gix let out a yelp of pain, Svent raised his hand

for silence. A noise echoed from below them.

Oth and Gix immediately recovered their weapons and

crawled over to a rock shelf from where they could peer

into the draw below them. Svent slid from his mount to

join them, and Ixen moved up afterward. The four lay close

enough together to whisper among themselves.

A gnome patrol approached, no doubt trying to keep

kobolds from reaching their sacred mine, but the gnomes

didnt seem to be aware of Ixen and her companions. The

two groups might have walked right into each other, had

the kobolds not paused before descending into the gully.

At this distance, they could either  ee, easily getting away,

or they could lie in wait to waylay the patrol.

Everyone  agreed  to  an  ambush.  These  were  gnomes,

after all, and the world could use fewer of them.

Ixen stood back as the warriors readied themselves. She

hissed and tensed her body, rubbing some hairs from a

bull between her hands. A second later, she touched

Svent, fortifying his muscle and sinew to lend

power to his blows.

The four kobolds then silently took up positions in the

rocks, ordering the weasels to lie low.

When the gnomes were just past Ixens hiding spot, an

explosion rocked their ranks. In the wake of the  re, several

smoking corpses sprawled on the trail. All the surviving

gnomes were frozen in shock.

Oth and Gix threw spears while Svent rapidly  red arrows

from his shortbow. One gnome fell to this onslaught.

Ixen wasted no time, drawing a wand and discharging

two darts of force against the largest warrior, dropping

him with one volley. Most of the enemy now lay dead or

dying. Ixen and her band pressed forward.

Svent identi ed the leader and sent Kurik to harry him

while simultaneously charging a gnome already wounded

by an arrow. Oth and Gix each drew a sword and  anked

another gnome who was already reeling from the initial

attack. Ixen launched two more missiles from her out-

stretched wand. Another gnome fell.

The kobold warriors quickly dispatched their wounded

adversaries. But the lone gnome leader kept Kurik at bay with

wild swings of a small axe and used a free moment to raise

a horn to his lips. A trilling blast echoed across the land.

Oth and Gix  inched, but Svent snarled and charged. Ixens

ray of  ame was faster. The horns wielder was blown from his

feet by the impact. A second ray stole his life. Svent took up

the gnomes horn from where it had fallen in the dust.

Oth and Gix stripped the corpses while Svent scouted

the high ground to see if any reinforcements were coming.

He knew warbands of this size did not travel far from aid,

and the horns call would bring more gnomes soon.

The group doubled up on the backs of their dire weasels

and rode with abandon, no longer trying to pass through

the territory undetected. The nearest kobold-controlled

territory was only two leagues away, well within reach of

a sprint. Svent and Ixen pushed their steeds for the entire

distance, and Svent sounded the gnomish horn once they

passed into kobold lands.

The signal worked. A kobold patrol arrived, expecting a

gnome force. Instead, it found Ixen and her party,

welcomed them, and escorted them the remain-

ing distance to the sacred mine.

Within  the  temple,  Oth  and  Gix  col-

lapsed in a room set aside

for special visitors. Ixen

and Svent rushed into

the temples depths to

the  upper  levels  of  the

sacred  mine,  handing  Ix-

ens  egg  over  to  the

elders there. Her task

done,  Ixen  crum-

pled  to  the   oor,

overwhelmed  by

exhaustion.

Svent  bowed  to

the astonished elders

and carried Ixens

spent body back

to  the  chamber

where  Oth  and

Gix already slept.

APPEARANCE

Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with bony frames

and small tails. They stand approximately 2 to 2-1/2 feet

tall and weigh 35 to 45 pounds. Sinewy, double-jointed

legs, naturally bent and poised for sudden speed, con-

tribute to their height. When her legs are stretched out, a

kobold can increase her height by up to 1 foot, but doing

so is uncomfortable.

Kobolds have scaly skin, varying in color from rusty

brown to reddish black. They have strong teeth, and their

hands and feet have long digits tipped with very small claws.

A kobolds face is like a crocodiles, with a jaw that can open

wide enough to hold a whole melon. Constantly alert and

wide, the eyes of a kobold range in color from burnt ochre

to red. A ridge of small, hornlike bone juts above each brow

and sweeps backward, the protrusions growing larger and

more pronounced toward the rear of the skull.

KOBOLD RACIAL TRAITS

+2 Dexterity, 4 Strength, 2 Constitution. Kobolds are

weak and frail, but their size grants them quickness.

Small: As a Small creature, a kobold gains a +1 size bonus

to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a 4 size

penalty on grapple checks, and a +4 size bonus on Hide

checks, but she uses smaller weapons than humans use,

and her lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of

those of a Medium character.

Humanoid (dragonblood, reptilian): Kobolds are human-

oids with the dragonblood and reptilian subtypes. For all

effects related to race, a kobold is considered a dragon.

Kobold base land speed is 30 feet.

+1 natural armor bonus.

Darkvision: Kobolds can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like normal sight. Kobolds can function just  ne with

no light at all.

All  kobolds  add  Craft  (trapmaking)  to  their  list  of

class skills.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Craft  (trapmaking),  Profession

Common and Undercommon.

Favored Class: Sorcerer. A multiclass kobolds sorcerer

class does not count when determining whether she

takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

AGE

Once hatched, kobolds mature at a breakneck pace, using

the same life cycle as dragons, but only living one-tenth

as long. By the time a kobold reaches the age of eight or

nine (on average), she is mentally and physically able to

assist her tribe in any capacity.

PHYSIOLOGY

Kobolds have close biological ties to dragons. The most

important difference between the two, however, is that

kobolds are cold-blooded creatures, and dragons are warm-

blooded. While kobolds do generate some internal body

heat from taking in food and engaging in activity, they

are dependent on their environment for warmth. This is

one reason why they live underground, especially in their

native temperate climate.

Being a cold-blooded humanoid has advantages and dis-

advantages. Warm temperatures are comfortable to kobolds,

who can sustain their bodies by literally soaking up heat. A

kobold who inhabits a region with a temperature of 40F or

above for 24 hours can go for another three days after that

time before having to eat normally. The downside is that

kobolds feel the cold more profoundly. Sudden chilling

temperatures, such as being struck by a cone of cold spell,

do not affect kobolds more than normal, but prolonged

cold increases their need for sustenance. After inhabiting a

region with a temperature below 40F for more than three

days, kobolds must consistently consume three times as

much food per day than is normal for their size.

Kobolds can eat a wide variety of foodstuffs, drawing

nutrition from a broad, omnivorous diet. Evil kobolds

have no scruples when it comes to eating, even consider-

ing other intelligent creatures as options for the stewpot.

10/25/05   12:07:15 PM

Kobolds who are desperate for food, especially when travel-

ing through cold regions, can eat almost anything. They

can metabolize many forms of organic matter, including

bark, bones, dirt, leather, and shells. A tribe of kobolds

that is short on provisions feeds its youngest members

whatever they can eat.

As reptiles, kobolds are hatched from hard-shelled eggs.

Once a female kobold has been fertilized, she lays one egg

within two weeks, with a 10% chance of laying two eggs.

The egg must be incubated for 60 days, after which time

it hatches into a kobold wyrmling that is able to walk and

feed after only a few hours.

An average tribe has one egg and one child per ten

kobold adults, while a particularly prosperous one might

have double this number. Tribes with a scarcity of food

have fewer young.

On rare occasions, a kobold female lays what kobolds call

a dragonwrought egg (see the Dragonwrought feat, page

100). These eggs are spotted with the color of whichever

true dragon in uences the dragonwrought kobold within,

with such mottles increasing in number and size as the

wyrmling inside grows.

Kobold  embryos  are  resilient  and  not  easily  disturbed

when moved or transported. A kobold embryo rarely expires

unless its egg is broken before the  nal 15 days of incuba-

tion. A kobold embryo inside an egg that is broken after

that time suffers no ill effects, though the wyrmling may

take a while longer to reach physical maturity.

CLOTHING

Kobolds are pragmatic about fashion. They dress appro-

priately for the occasion, which includes  nery for special

celebrations and ceremonies. While an individual kobold

enjoys looking distinguished and  ne, tailored or inlaid

clothing is an extravagance seen only in the wardrobes

of tribal dignitaries and leaders. Most kobolds spend all

their time mining, however, and working kobolds wear

work clothing.

Kobolds do not usually have access to resources such

as cotton, but they readily harvest silk from underground

spiders, worms, and other insect larvae. Along with silk,

leather sees widespread use. Such hide, once cured, creates

the most durable clothing for mining and requires the

least amount of maintenance.

As a miner, the typical kobold dresses for freedom of

movement, which usually takes the form of a sleeveless

leather tunic and breeches that stop above the knee. The

consistent temperatures found in underground environ-

ments mean kobolds usually dont have to consider dressing

for warmth.

Footwear does not exist in kobold society. The idea of

wearing footwear has never occurred to kobolds, not even

for comfort. Kobolds rely heavily on their double-jointed

legs and articulated feet to maintain their speed and bal-

ance. Moving across rugged terrain poses no dif culty for

a barefooted kobold, whose feet are so naturally tough and

callused that gravel and rough stone cause no pain.

Well-dressed kobolds enjoy making bold statements, so

popular colors include dark reds and  ery oranges to accent

ones eyes. Such pigments are easy for kobolds to acquire

in their subterranean lairs. Kobolds value all sorts of dyes,

often accenting their clothing based on their af nity with

a certain kind of dragon.

Due to the proli c mining of the typical kobold tribe,

those kobolds able to afford it favor metal and gem-encrusted

adornment. While they are usually sensible with the cut of

their garments, kobolds love jewelry and ornamentation.

Both sexes wear all sorts of jewelry, including tail rings.

Warriors often don symbolic metal armor pieces such as

bracers, decorative gorgets, and greaves.

When it comes to real armor, kobold warriors prefer

leather, avoiding anything that might slow them down.

Kobolds perceive speed as their greatest tactical advantage.

As a substitute for metal armor, some kobolds have been

known to wear armor made from the shells of giant beetles

(see page 121 for more information on chitin armor).

GROOMING

Mining is a dirty profession. It requires endurance and

determination.  Few  humans  can  mine  for  an  extended

period, but every kobold can. Being grimy is a part of the

mining life, but kobolds are far from uncivilized when it

comes to hygiene.

For a kobold, a lack of hair doesnt mean less grooming.

As reptilian humanoids, kobolds shed their skins like other

reptiles do. This is not a simple procedure in the manner of

some snakes that can shed an old skin in one piece. Adult

kobolds shed their skin in patches. This process takes up

to a week if allowed to transpire naturally, but kobolds

accelerate the shedding by scrubbing the old skin from

their bodies.

A growing kobold sheds her skin at intervals ranging from

once a week to once a month. Adult kobolds shed their skin

about once a season. Many adults use a bottle of replenishing

oil made from a plant called bitterleaf to strengthen their

scales and keep them shiny. Regular application of bitterleaf

oil (see page 122) can delay shedding inde nitely.

Between shedding cycles, kobolds are quick to take advan-

tage of the natural springs discovered in their excavations.

Swimming is one of their favorite pastimes. Although kobold

tribes dont actually construct public baths, all kobolds

gather at pools to bathe and socialize.

Kobolds are meticulous about their teeth and claws. A

 at stone in every kobold dwelling serves as a tool for pol-

ishing claws. Kobolds chew roots and bones to strengthen

their gums and clean the surface of their teeth.

We suffer and yet prevail.

PSYCHOLOGY

Thurirl, High Priest of the Sacred Mine,

Keeper of Dragonwrought Eggs

Kobolds exist in a world much larger than they are, dwarfed

by creatures usually at least three or four times their physical

mass. Living among such competition could be a constant

struggle to assert dominance, with kobolds making sure

they are never overlooked or taken for granted. But kobolds

spend their energy elsewhere.

While gnomes and hal ings often integrate into other

races societies, kobolds turn inward. The kobold deity

Kurtulmak (see page 48) doesnt allow such fraternization.

10/25/05   12:07:17 PM

Kobolds have their own culture and a set of deeply intro-

spective traditions.

To generalize kobolds as xenophobic is misleading. They

are perfectly happy to be overlooked by others, having

disdain for other races and preferring to conduct their

activities in secret. Being consistently underestimated

is seen as a giftone they have taken advantage of for

countless generations.

The intimate thoughts of a kobold would probably sur-

prise most other individuals. Kobolds live in an undeviating

state of contentment, despite any setbacks experienced by

their tribe. Its strange for others to imagine that such weak

creatures can lead such ful lling lives, until you consider

one lingering piece of knowledge that kobolds have never

overlooked: They are kin to dragons.

The origin of this connection is unclear, based heavily

on folklore and myth, but the relationship is undeniable:

The two races are related. Being completely certain of their

heritage gives kobolds a con dence that is neither troubled

by self-doubt nor arrogantly expressed. It affords individual

kobolds great comfort to think that no matter what happens

to them, the dragon can never be taken from their blood. A

common saying among kobolds expresses this view: The

dragon scale toughens our skin. The dragon bone adorns our

skull. The dragon heart  ames our sorcery. We are the dragon,

and for the dragon we live. Long live the dragon.

This draconic heritage invigorates kobold culture with

an indomitable will to endure any hardship. While kobolds

do not have the bene t of longevity that dragons enjoy,

they do understand what it means to take the long view.

Their individual lives might be  eeting, but the impact of

their presence in the world is widely felt.

A powerful, self-sacri cing instinct rules kobolds when-

ever their tribe is endangered. Kobolds readily struggle

against impossible odds or unconquerable foes simply to

buy time or coordinate a diversion. The needs of the tribe

outweigh  the  continued  existence  of  any  one  kobold.

This is not to say that kobolds needlessly throw their lives

away; they value their lives no less than any other creature,

retreating when necessary.

Kobolds are intimately aware of both their shortcomings

and their strengths. Small and weak, they use numbers to

aid in bringing down a larger foe. They employ their speed

to divide enemies, set up  anking maneuvers, and create

hit-and-run assaults. Clever and inventive, they safeguard

their homes with cruelly ingenious traps, using tight spaces

and passages through which only creatures of their size can

travel easily. If all seems lost, kobolds throw themselves

bravely at an enemy, hoping beyond hope to stop it.

This selfless behavior carries over into everyday life.

Expansion of the tribe is more important than personal

accomplishments, and any personal accomplishments

should advance the tribe. Success of the tribe is per-

sonal success.

It is only through vast population, however, that a tribe

can hope to thrive and become wealthy. So, kobolds shame-

lessly reproduce. Impersonal mating is commonplace, with

females choosing mates by practical measures instead of

in uences such as love or lust. While kobolds do form bond-

ing relationships, the idea of sexual monogamy is alien to

them. Kobolds desire to spread their kind everywhere, and

the inability of one warren to contain a tribes population

is celebrated. Part of the old tribe breaks off to expand into

new territory.

Frequent overcrowding in their lairs has permanently

erased the concept of privacy from kobolds lives. Sleep-

ing quarters are shared, with children having the least

privacy. In most tribes (except for newly split-off groups),

not enough room exists to comfortably accommodate

everyone, and only the hardest-working members of a

tribe are afforded any degree of personal space.

Lack of privacy has also resulted in the absence of mod-

esty. Kobolds are not self-conscious about nudity, whether

in the presence of the same or the opposite sex. They still

wear clothing for protection and decoration, but clothing

is not seen as essential.

Living in such close quarters means con ict is always

a possibility. Kobolds dont hide their feelings, instead

quarreling openly when they need to. When emotions run

high, kobolds express themselves immediately and without

holding back. Despite the intensity of such displays, they

rarely turn lethal because the proximity of other kobolds

prevents such interactions from taking place discreetly.

In this way, all problems are dealt with before they can

fester and grow.

Kobolds arent as forgiving of other races. They have

long memories and are not quick to pardon, nurturing

hatred like a favorite child groomed for a speci c purpose.

Most kobolds wait until their enemy has been brought

low by circumstanceor better still, by clandestine

kobold interferencebefore delivering a decisive and

premeditated reprisal. In short, kobolds love revenge.

Roleplaying Application: Realizing that free will and

instinct  ght for dominance in every kobold is perhaps the

most important step in understanding the races psychol-

ogy. Where does your kobold character fall between those

extremes? Do you focus less on tribal preservation and

more on yourself? Is your demeanor quiet and introspec-

tive, or do you  aunt your dragon heritage? How strong

is your sense of duty and work ethic when away from the

tribe? Do you pursue your own interests at the expense of

others? Does the intimacy of living in close quarters appeal

to you, or are you happier when afforded some space? How

do you behave when living among nonkobolds? Do you

respect their standards of privacy, or are you oblivious to

their need for solitude? How do you express your emotions

to nonkobolds?

KOBOLD LIFE

Kobolds are ingrained with certain behaviors. Subterra-

nean and insular, kobold culture has had little in uence

from the outside. Nevertheless, kobolds have habits similar

to those of other humanoid races.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Even tall ones are shorter than I am, when theyre  at on their

backs in a hole  lled with spikes.

kobold trapmaker. These creatures revel in the intricacies

of their inventions. Kobolds rarely indulge in creativity over

function, but exceptions are made for a cunning trap.

One-upmanship is definitely present among kobold

trapmakers. They find ingenious ways to incorporate

bizarre spells, technological advances, and unexpected

twists into their traps. In fact, the inventive ways in

which kobolds defend their lairs compares favorably to

the technological and magical marvels created by their

hated foes, the gnomes.

Kobolds  take  great  pride  in  designing  their  warrens.

Digging a labyrinth or a mine is no offhand matter, with

careful  planning  of  a  layout  taking  place  before

excavation  begins.  To  aid  in  this  process,

kobolds use divination magic to iden-

tify  the  location  of  large  ore  or

precious stone deposits before a

single shaft is dug. Whenever

possible,  kobolds  leave  no

part of mine construction

to  guesswork,  allowing

them to concentrate on

both functionality and

appearance.

One part of every ko-

bold lair is reserved for

historical  depictions

of  the  tribes  mythic

genesis, including all the

dif culties  encountered

and  overcome.  Because

personal  dwellings  are  also

mined, every family is expected

to hew out space for itself, which

it similarly engraves and inlays

with  symbols  of  events  signi -

cant to its history.

Kobolds craftsmanship of every-

day  objects  is  neither  crude  nor

exceptional. They excel at making

useful objects rather than beautiful artworks. The only

time  kobolds  invest  any  extra  effort  into  their  crafts-

manship (aside from mine layouts and trapmaking) is for

jewelry.

Kobolds love jewelry, and individuals can be exceed-

ingly  particular  in  their  tastes.  Such  jewelry  is  often

crafted from an exotic array of colored metals, either

mined from veins of rare ore or using different minerals

smelted together to create new and unique amalgams.

Kobolds are more than a little materialistic when it comes

to accumulating baubles and trinkets, not unlike dragons

and their hoards.

Although  far  less  common  than  sorcerers,  kobold

bards are also valuable members of the tribe, acting as

the keepers of lore. Kobolds rarely sing, so kobold bards

are masters of various percussion and wind instruments.

Percussion provides a rhythm for work and can be used

to  send  messages  over  distances.  Wind  instruments

can  also  sound  across  expanses,  but  some  can  serve

to calm the mind and provide a soothing background

for workers.

MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY

You dont know what hard work is until youve seen a kobold

mine in full swing.

Morent Wolfstone, dwarf adventurer,

head of clan mining

On a theoretical level, kobolds draw very little distinc-

tion between magic and technology. They use muscle and

tools to move and shape their surroundings and to defend

themselves, and they use magic to do the same. Magic and

technology are complementary

disciplines with practical appli-

cations.  No  wise  kobold  leader

fails to invest in both.

Kobolds  are  a  hardworking

race, easily rivaling dwarves for

productivity. What they lack in

physical  strength,  they  more

than make up for with num-

bers. Kobold labor forces are

a  marvel  to  behold.  When

fast at work, kobolds function

like  a  hive  of  ants.  Despite

the swarming masses of bod-

ies devoted to one task, they

rarely  trip  over  each  other,

instinctively knowing where

to  apply  their  help  most  ef -

ciently, using their tails to help

avoid collisions.

This work ethic permeates

every level of magical and tech-

nological advancement in kobold

society. From planning to execu-

tion,  kobolds  work  competently

and with amazing speed.

Alchemy is known to kobolds.

Their most widespread invention is

a domestic one, a time-honored cre-

ation known as bitterleaf oil (see page

122). Adult kobolds use this concoction to keep their scales

healthy and shiny (with the additional bene t of delaying

periodic shedding, as mentioned earlier). Bitterleaf oil also

comes in handy for healing purposes, minimizing scarring

from minor wounds. Kobold miners, who endure daily cuts

and bruises, appreciate this substance immensely.

Curiously, kobolds have a near-fatalistic attraction for

volatile chemicals. When dense stones obstruct mining,

kobolds reduce them to rubble with explosives they call

ditherbombs (see page 122). Ditherbombs are also used in

war and in trapmaking.

SEARCHING FOR THE DRAGON

At  the  start  of  every  day,  before  the  work  of  mining

begins, the entire tribe comes together in a large, usually

rough-hewn and un nished community hall. Each kobold

chooses a place on the  oor, closes his or her eyes, and casts

the  mind  inward,  embracing  the  wellspring  of  kobold

heritage. The silence and stillness of a tribal meditation is

awe-inspiring. One can hear drafts blowing in the empty

tunnels and an unattended  re crackling in the distance.

This daily meditation lasts for at least 15 minutes and

is known as Searching for the Dragon. Sorcerers prepare

themselves to cast spells, and nonsorcerers take advantage

of this time to be alone with their thoughts. Those who

undertake the Draconic Rite of Passage (see below)  nd

that the Searching for the Dragon ritual is a vital part of

their daily lives.

Draconic Rite of Passage

The Draconic Rite of Passage awakens the sorcerous power

within the blood of kobolds.

Prerequisites: Only kobolds can undergo the Draconic

Rite of Passage. A kobold requires no one else to perform

the rite; it is a solitary activity.

Bene  t: Upon completing this rite, a kobold chooses

any 1st-level sorcerer spell. He can now use that spell once

per day as a spell-like ability, using his character level as

his caster level.

Each day, a kobold must complete the Searching for the

Dragon meditation (see above) in order to recharge this

spell-like ability for the day. No kobold can bene t from

this rite more than once.

Time:  A  kobold  who  undergoes  this  rite  must   rst

endure nine days of fasting. Immediately thereafter, the

kobold must succeed on a DC 10 Concentration check to

enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. If the check

fails, the rite must begin anew.

Cost: This rite requires sacri cing a gem of at least 100

gp in value. The kobold also permantly loses 1 hit point

upon completion of the rite.

LOVE

Kobolds put great energy and care into fostering kobold

wyrmlings. Few experiences are more gratifying to an

adult kobold than being treated as a model for the life of

a young kobold.

Kobold adults go out of their way to encourage juveniles

who show promise, to steep them in the traditions of kobold

culture. Kobolds teach using simple instruction and swift

punishment in case of error or failure. Punishment is often

physical in nature, though usually geared toward causing

instructive pain rather than injury.

Next to children, kobolds love workand by natural

extension,  their  tribemore  than  anything  else.  For

a kobold, work de nes life,  lling her with a sense of

belonging and purpose. Even young kobolds exhibit this

feeling as they start to mimic working adults early in their

lives. A kobold who does not lend a hand is useless and

threatened with exile.

Kobolds only rarely engage in any activity resembling

romantic love. Most  nd their communal life among tribe

members satisfying enough. A kobold can live her whole

life without forming a bond to any sort of signi cant other.

This doesnt mean that kobolds are asexual. They mate

regularly. The impulse for doing so, however, is mostly

instinct tempered with a sense of duty. All kobolds desire

to keep their tribe forti ed with as many healthy young

as can be fed and housed.

Kobolds who form an emotional attachment to another

kobold are drawn to that one out of mutual respect and

increased productivity. The potential partners often meet

because of having to work with one another, and then

 nd that they work better jointly than they did alone. As

such, kobolds who dont work together only rarely become

romantically involved.

Kobolds who are attached in this manner take an oath

to  serve  and  care  for  one  another,  each  becoming  the

others chosen one. The would-be couples all-watcher

(see Society and Culture, below) must approve the match,

and with that done, a priest witnesses the oaths and blesses

the joining. Such unions are rarely monogamous, because

both sexes are still compelled by mating instincts and are

likely to succumb to those in uences if separated from

one another for long. Since sex itself has little emotional

value  to  kobolds,  these  extramarital  liaisons  create  no

friction between couples.

Couples who bond together in this way are provided with

personal living quarters if their status and contributions

to the tribe merit such a privilege. Usually, the all-watcher

allocates an area that the couple must then excavate.

KOBOLDS AT WAR

In times of warfare, all adults are expected to  ght, but

patrolling warbands exist to protect kobold lairs. These

warriors are also responsible for trap maintenance, reset-

ting devices that have been sprung and replacing broken

or expended parts.

Kobolds have one of the highest birth rates among the

humanoid races, causing their population to grow on a

regular basis. When a warren can no longer sustain a

tribes numbers, the population divides in half, with each

half including representatives from every part of kobold

society. The two halves become much smaller but still

complete kobold tribes. One of the newly formed tribes

then migrates far enough away that both groups of kobolds

do not compete for the same resources.

This expansionist cycle usually heralds a time of war

for kobolds, especially in crowded regions with several

neighboring races. If unoccupied lands cannot be found,

a wandering kobold tribe encroaches into gnome territory

 rst. If the coming con ict is known of ahead of time, the

parent tribe aids the migrating tribe in the war.

When  taking  the  offensive,  kobolds  prefer  ranged

weapons, delaying melee combat inde nitely if possible.

Most kobold warriors are able slingers; others specialize

in hit-and-run tactics with light crossbows. Only strong

kobolds use shortbows.

Kobolds like to improvise traps on the battle eld. A

popular tactic is to create a shallow moat of pitch behind

the  rst few lines of warriors, wait until the enemy draws

close, and then suddenly fall back, igniting the moat and

turning it into a wall of  re. Kobolds then shoot through

the  ames at short range. The enemy must either drive

through the  ames and face ranged attacks at the same

time or fall back, allowing the kobolds to maintain the

battle from a distance.

When it comes to melee, kobolds are trained to use reach

weapons, which keeps a healthy space between them and

their opponents. Once armies are within melee range

of each other, kobolds commonly rely on spears, either

charging with the weapons outstretched or setting them

into the ground to receive a charging enemy. When this

defensive posture fails, kobolds simply push forward

from behind, forcing wave upon wave of spear-

wielding warriors against the enemy.

Specialized melee combatants are rare among

kobolds,  but  theyre  easily  distinguished  by  the

chitin armor (see page 121) they wear. Particularly

strong  and  brave  kobolds  become  dire  weasel

riders. These few form the light cavalry in a kobold

army.

For  sieges,  kobolds  use  rolling  ballistae  and

light catapults. Crossbow-wielding troops

protect siege engines, supported by sling-

ers.  Sorcerers  defend  strategic  positions,

while the most capable of the spellcasters be-

come living artillery. Kobold military leaders

also use ditherbombs (see page 122) to break through

enemy barricades and forti cations.

Kobolds believe that no obstacle exists that cant be

defeated by strength of numbers. They are one of the

few races that strikes fear into their enemies not due to

combat prowess, but rather because of the suffocating

wave of bodies they can muster. A kobold army

is a pounding onslaught of flailing weapons,

hurling itself against supposedly impenetrable

defenses until those defenses crack, buckle, and

break.  This  time-honored  tactic,  although  completely

devoid of elegance, has been the turning point in more

than one battle, shifting the balance of a stalemate in the

kobolds favor and winning the day. To that end, kobold

commanding of cers plan for and accept a large number

of casualties among their troops.

Although capable of holding their own on a battle-

ground, kobolds do not willingly engage in large-scale

warfare, doing so only as necessary when a tribe divides

and migrates. Kobolds much prefer to operate in warbands

around an established lair, defending their lands with a

dizzying array of traps that minimizes their need to engage

in melee combat. For this reason, they have never devel-

oped a strategic approach to warfare and often withdraw

when a battle starts to become prolonged.

Kobolds see no pro t in long military engagements and

would rather cut their losses by retreating. The only time a

roaming kobold tribe makes a  nal stand is when its back

is truly against a wall, lacking either the resources to travel

farther or a nearby region in which to settle.

DEATH

In addition to having one of the highest birth rates, kobolds

have one of the highest mortality rates of any humanoid

race.  This  latter  statistic  can  be  deceptive,  however.

Kobolds who remain in a lair and never migrate with a

newly formed tribe can enjoy lives well into great wyrm

age (past 120 years).

The body of any deceased kobold is considered waste

material and incinerated immediately. No preferential

treatment is given to the body of any member of kobold

society, no matter how important her position. Many

members of other cultures  nd this approach callous, but

they fail to grasp the underlying motivation. Kobolds place

no emphasis on the body, attaching far more importance

to their belief in a cycle of reincarnation.

For kobolds, any obstacle can be defeated

by strength of numbers

Kobolds believe that if they die in service to their tribe,

Kurtulmak  immediately  sends  each  of  them  back  to

life as the next egg laid in the hatchery. If a particularly

important or respected member of a tribe dies, the hatchery

is  closely  monitored.  The  next  egg  laid  is  immediately

separated  from  the  rest  and  carefully  protected.  Once

hatched,  the  resultant  wyrmling  is  groomed  to   ll  a

position of importance, if not the position of the recently

deceased kobold. Such wyrmlings are given the name of

their predecessor in some form.

When a tribe is wiped out, kobolds believe that Kurtul-

mak distributes the souls of the deceased to other tribes.

If  a  kobold  dies  while  serving  her  own  needs  rather

than those of the tribe, Kurtulmak reincarnates her as the

next pup born in the dire weasel stablesshe becomes a

domesticated animal unable to choose whether to serve.

Kobolds who die betraying their tribe are reincarnated

as giant stag beetles, which kobolds hunt for chitinous

armor.

The greatest glory a kobold can gain is to die not only

in service to her tribe, but also in a manner that involves

sacri cing her life for the tribes greater good. Kurtulmak

welcomes such brave kobolds into his own mine to boost the

ranks of the kobolds already toiling within. Kobolds hold

that the most loyal and productive among Kurtulmaks labor-

ers are eventually reincarnated as chromatic dragons.

With  every  type  of  death  comes  an  obvious  lesson:

Kobolds  should  serve  their  tribe  above  all  else.  As  a

byproduct  of  this  outlook,  kobolds  spend  almost  no

time mourning their dead and remain focused on their

assigned tasks.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Kobold  society  is  strongest  when  work  is  abundant.

The bustle of a kobold lair when a new vein of metal or

deposit of precious stones has been unearthed is energized

and high-spirited. This is the beating heart of kobold

culturethe acquisition and processing of wealth deep

beneath the ground. When it comes right down to it,

kobolds and dragons both suffer from an inexplicable and

almost pathological materialism.

The challenge for a leader is to make every kobold feel that

she is bene ting from and contributing to the wealth of her

tribe, rather than simply working for the sake of working.

Kobolds earn positions based on merit, with no arbitrary

system of social classes to prevent advancement. Aristocrat

and commoner nonplayer character classes do not exist in

kobold society. A tribe is largely made up of experts and

warriors, with adepts supervising the mining operations.

Roleplaying Application: Kobolds are intimately famil-

iar with every aspect of their society. Figuring out how your

kobold  ts into this culture can further de ne your character.

Are you descended from the working majority or the expert

specialists? Were you chosen during a Searching for the

Dragon ritual and trained as a sorcerer, or were you born into

a position of status and importance within the tribe?

ALL-WATCHER

A kobold all-watcher is the leader of her tribe and the ac-

countant of the tribes accumulated wealth. In addition to

approving  chosen  one  bonds  and  arbitrating  matters

of betrayal and exile, an all-watcher is concerned with

the dispersal of wealth generated by the mines. This

duty  not  only  involves  allocating  wealth  among

the tribes major groups, but also deciding how

resources  should  be  spent  to  strengthen  the

tribes position in the world.

Experts offer a steady stream of proposals

for augmenting the tribes lair and expand-

ing  influence.  Kobold  scholars,  priests,

and  arcane  spellcasters  similarly  propose

areas where kobold knowledge and power

can be increased to lucrative effect. Mili-

tary  commanders  recommend  feasible

and  beneficial  engagements.  A  kobold

all-watcher must weigh all these options

and choose where to devote assets.

Beyond these responsibilities, an all-watcher

must be an unyielding taskmaster. She must

set deadlines for projects and allocate workers

to  them  to  ensure  their  timely  completion.

Most all-watchers are also capable sorcerers.

SPECIALISTS

Kobold experts are the specialists of kobold

labor forces. Such individuals are respon-

sible  for  development  and  research  in

a kobold tribe. Despite having special-

ized skills, kobold experts are treated

the same as any other worker. They en-

joy  different  challenges  than  a  miner

might but are expected to serve the tribe

like any other member.

The only experts who receive special attention for their

efforts are kobold trapmakers. These inventors are highly

valued because their creations protect kobold lairs and

tribal lands without the need for open warfare. Essentially,

the more ingenious a trapmaker, the more kobold lives are

spared from combat.

The most common experts found in kobold societies

include agronomists, alchemists, animal trainers, armor-

smiths, blacksmiths, bowyers, demolitionists, explorers,

 etchers, hunters, jewelers, leatherworkers, miners, stone-

masons, and weaponsmiths.

SORCERERS

In contrast to most humanoid cultures, kobold sorcerers

are not left to discover their abilities through trial and

error. Kobolds with a talent for sorcery are guided through

the awakening of their abilities and directed toward spe-

ci c types of magic. Entering into this calling is a deeply

reverential act, surrounded with more ceremony than any

other part of kobold culture. A kobold sorcerer is required

to make lifetime vows to the craft of sorcery, not unlike

swearing into the priesthood.

Kobolds instructed by tribal sorcerers are directed into one

of four areas of magicaugmenting, offensive, pragmatic, or

preemptive. One out of every four sorcerers studies augment-

ing magic, designed to shore up kobold weaknesses and give

them greater stealth. Spells such as enlarge person, bulls strength,

and haste are common choices for the augmenting sorcerer.

Three out of every four sorcerers become offensive magicians,

focusing on damaging targets from far away, using spells such

as magic missile,  aming sphere, and  reball.

Two out of every three offensive

sorcerers  become  pragmatic  ar-

cane  casters,  concentrating

on every day work and

mining in particular,

focusing their efforts

on effects such as fab-

ricate,  locate  object,

stone shape, and trans-

mute  rock  to  mud.

One out of every

two  augmenting

sorcerers is eventu-

ally directed toward

preemptive  magic,

looking for impend-

ing threats to the tribe

with spells such as ar-

cane  eye,  detect  scrying,

and scrying.

KOBOLD MERCHANTS

Kobold  merchants  are  the  most  indepen-

dent-minded members of a tribe, and for

good reason. They spend more time above-

ground than any other kobolds, negotiating

with other tribes and some other races. Kobold merchants

are the face of a kobold tribe in the world, and that face is

one they prefer to disguise.

When delivering goods to a customer, kobold merchants

magically pose as members of other races, hiding behind

glamers and illusions. Kobold tribes arent ashamed of

their interactions with other races, but they prefer to

operate in secrecy to protect themselves. Because of this,

most trading partners are ignorant of the fact that theyre

dealing with kobolds, which is a testament to the guile of

kobold merchants.

Since kobold merchants are independent and allowed

to operate in other societies, one sometimes goes rogue.

In developing multiple connections with powerful lead-

ers outside their tribes, kobold merchants  nd it easy to

corrupt their warrior escorts with promises of wealth. The

break starts small but could lead to the merchant starting

a new mine, creating her own base of pro t.

Clever kobold merchants time their plans to coincide

with a population explosion in their original tribe. When

the kobold populace  nally divides in half, the merchant

already has a location picked out, ready and waiting to be

mined, over which she serves as all-watcher.

This type of self-interest actually works out well for all

involved. Insightful all-watchers deliberately choose kobolds

with individualistic tendencies and leadership potential

to become merchants for their tribe. Thereby, prospective

troublemakers are kept out of daily tribal life, and the likeli-

hood of successful kobold proliferation is increased.

WORKERS

Most kobold workers are miners, the group that makes

up  the  vast  majority  of  any  tribe.  Kobold

miners have levels in the expert class

(DMG 109).

The trick to leading kobold work-

ers is to let them lead themselves.

Left to their devices, kobolds

from every profession embrace

their daily rituals and motivate

themselves to work. If a deci-

sion needs to be made and a

cleric  of  Kurtulmak  is  not

around to make it, kobolds

either  nd a way to stay

busy or make the deci-

sion collectively.

For  instance,  a

kobold mine is exten-

sively discussed and

illustrated before con-

struction  begins.  A

simpli ed form of the

layout is put on public

display, and overseeing

clergy draw up detailed

plans. Miners wondering

what to do next can consult

either. Those most experienced

at following design plans lead the work

effort,  allowing  the  rest  to  follow  with  or

without the direction of a priest.

This independence empowers kobold workers, because

they know their opinions and the opinions of their respected

colleagues are trusted. Living in a society with no de ned

social  structure,  but  a  heavily  de ned  working  schedule,

furthers the self-esteem of all kobolds.

FAMILY BONDS

Since most females mate many times and with many

partners to ensure fertilization, no one devotes any effort

to monitoring which couplings are responsible for which

eggs. Kobolds instinctively know their blood relatives

by subtle scent and avoid mating with them, since such

unions are sterile. To further blur the lines of family, all

kobold females lay their eggs in one area of the tribes lair,

resuming their duties immediately after laying.

Speci c individuals, known as fosterers, are responsible

for tending and warming eggs. Many of these kobolds are

also strong warriors, so that they can guard the eggs and

young effectively.

Wyrmling kobolds are initially named and cared for

by the fosterers. When they can move nimbly and feed

themselves (at the age of eight to twelve months), young

kobolds enter tribal life and become the responsibility of

all adults. Young are given minor responsibilities, nurtur-

ing their work ethic and self-esteem.

Kobold miners make up the vast

majority of any tribe

At about three years of age, juvenile kobolds undertake

training in a profession suited to them and the tribes needs.

They become part of a group already doing such work. This

communal approach to raising children engrains important

lessons into the mind of every growing kobold. She learns

to take action and to help without being asked. Her value is

tied to what she gives to her tribe, and her life is connected

with the lives of her fellow tribe members.

Kobolds treat their tribe as an extended family wherein

professionals group together to accomplish needed tasks.

The familiarity engendered by these professional groups

comes the closest to resembling an actual family by the

standards of humans and other, similar humanoids. These

professional families live together for the sake of centraliza-

tion and ef ciency. Kobolds  nd a sense of belonging in

this microcosm of tribal life.

KOBOLDS AND

OTHER RACES

Kobolds dislike other humanoid races. They are isolation-

ists who see others as a threat, and they surround their

lairs with traps to keep outsiders at bay. Kobolds also

have a persecution complex, taking offense from simple

misunderstandings. When kobolds do interact with other

races, they do so with a chip on their collective shoulders,

sensitive to even the smallest disrespect. As lawful evil

creatures  with  a  love  for  revenge,  kobolds  respond  to

perceived insults with actions rather than words, often

blindsiding the offenders.

This paranoia and oversensitivity means kobolds often

enter  con icts  where  none  need  have  occurred.  Other

races regard kobolds suspiciously at best, since more than

one diplomat has never returned from kobold-held terri-

tory. Kobolds antisocial behavior becomes raw hatred in

the presence of fey or gnomes. Those who enjoy good rela-

tions with those races rarely have any love for kobolds.

Dragonborn: The kobolds view of the dragonborn

is that of suspicion tempered by grudging respect. It is

dif cult for kobolds to overlook the fact that dragonborn

were not born with the dragon within them. The touch

of Bahamut elevates the dragonborn above their unfor-

tunate nondragon origins, but it is dif cult for a kobold

to wholly forget a dragonborns origins, especially when

that dragonborn was formerly a gnome. Still, kobolds have

been known to cooperate with dragonborn on occasion,

when their goals coincide.

Dragon-Descended: Kobolds view the dragon-descended

races with almost the same reverence that they reserve for

dragons, particularly when they encounter a half-dragon.

While no kobold tribe would consent to devote itself to any

but the most exceptional and charismatic half-dragon, it

would still be willing to go out of its way to help out any

half-dragon or draconic character, regardless of what that

characters dragon heritage is.

Dwarves:  Dwarves  and  kobolds  are  competitors  for

resources in the underground world. As such, they perceive

each  other  as  enemies  and  frequently  butt  heads  over

subterranean claims. The dwarves close ties to gnomes

do  not  improve  their  relationship  with  kobolds,  since

dwarves frequently ally with or champion gnomes in battle

against kobold tribes. While dwarves and kobolds dont

always attack each other the way gnomes and kobolds do,

both sides need very little provocation to start a  ght. On

the other hand, if dwarves and kobolds end up working

together through circumstance, they discover a common

work ethic, which has forged respectful friendships.

Elves: Elves bear far too much resemblance to fey for

kobolds to trust them. Kobolds acknowledge that the history

of elves is long, like the history of true dragons, and that elves

have arcane power, albeit learned from books. These facts

lead kobolds to afford elves a small degree of respect. On

very rare occasions, elves and kobolds even swap lore about

arcane magic. Elves bring a wealth of knowledge to these

discussions. Kobolds, whose lives are  eeting by comparison,

offer the recorded history of their draconic heritage.

Gnomes: If kobolds love one thing, its seeing a gnome

beg for his miserable life. They despise gnomes, and the

feeling is mutual. The two races barely manage civility

toward each other even under optimal diplomatic condi-

tions. Despite how well she may hide it, a part of every

kobold is constantly looking for a dagger whenever a gnome

is present. This racial hatred seems to have stemmed from

the injustice heaped on Kurtulmak by Garl Glittergold (see

The Ascension of Kurtulmak, page 50). For as long as that

legend has been told, both races have committed atroci-

ties against each other. If gnomes and kobolds are ever in

proximity to one another without  ghting, its only because

each side is taking the time to plan a decisive assault.

Half-Dragons: Half-dragons are fascinating and enviable

creatures, but kobolds assess each individual half-dragon

on its own merit, taking speci c interest in its draconic

heritage. A half-gnome half-dragon is an abomination to be

destroyed, lest it continue to pollute the draconic bloodline,

while other half-dragons receive some degree of reverence.

Dragon  disciples,  who  come  into  their  dragon  powers

through sorcery, are also a curiosity to kobolds.

Half-Elves: Kobolds see half-elves for what they arethe

product of an uncommon union between elf and human,

nothing more. Kobolds regard half-elves as social creatures

that try to facilitate communication between different

races. If kobolds were ever to trust nonkobolds with the

task of representing their interests (not likely), they would

probably rely upon half-elves.

Half-Orcs: Kobolds perceive orcs as disorganized,

ill-bred warmongers and associate half-orcs with their full-

blooded cousins. Orcs are too unpredictable to trust on any

level, but kobolds are not above selling metal and goods to

orc armies. Dealing with orcs during such a transaction,

however, is out of the question. A half-orc representative

must broker such trade pacts. While kobolds see half-orcs

as the most reasonable members of orc society, the reverse

perception holds when dealing with half-orcs from human

lands. Only a half-orc who speaks Draconic can earn any

real regard from kobolds.

Hal  ings: Kobolds hate fey, and the pleasant demeanor

of hal ings reminds them of such creatures. This is not

a fair assessment of hal ings, but kobolds indulge their

suspicion of other races  rst, especially races with possible

ties to gnomes. Beneath the judgmental eye of kobolds,

hal ings are duplicitous creatures constantly looking for

ways to exploit others. The fact that no self-respecting

hal ing rogue would, honestly speaking, disagree with

this assessment only feeds the kobold opinion. The two

races can  nd common ground in trapmaking.

Humans: Humans are mysterious to kobolds, some-

times enemies and sometimes friends. Kobolds realized

long ago not only that human behavior couldnt be easily

predicted, but also that humans apply energy and convic-

tion to whatever they do. If humans werent so numerous

and ubiquitous, kobolds would avoid them. Since that isnt

possible, kobolds test the waters of nearby human popula-

tions to determine whether they are friends or foes.

Spellscales:  Despite  being  obviously  descended

from  dragons,  spellscales   nd  themselves  the  object  of

exasperation and disgust on the part of kobolds. Kobolds

view spellscales as chaotic, sel sh individuals who drift

aimlessly, squandering their birthright. The only excep-

tion  to  this  outlook  is  held  by  kobold  sorcerers,  whose

annoyance is tempered by their respect for the sorcerous

power that spellscale sorcerers hold. Being in the same

place as a spellscale for any length of time, however, is a

trying experience for any kobold.

True  Dragons:  The  body  and  soul  of  any  kobold  is

dedicated  to  dragons,  whether  literally  or   guratively.

Kobolds  search  for  the  dragon  in  themselves,  and  they

pledge themselves to the dragon in their rites of passage.

In the presence of an actual dragon, kobolds are servile,

doing anything required of them. Kobolds see dragons as

older and wiser kin and cultural heroes. Kurtulmak is the

kobold deity, but dragons represent a tangible glory that

Kurtulmak cannot provide.

Roleplaying Application: How do kobold preconcep-

tions affect your kobold characters mindset and prejudices?

Are  you  naturally  suspicious  of  other  races,  or  do  you

keep an open mind? Do you share in kobold hatred for all

gnomes or wish to end the cycle of retribution? Will you

serve dragons, or do you act independently from them?

RELIGION

Kobolds have no time for organized reli-

gious ceremonies, but they are pious despite

their preoccupation with work. Hard work

is worship to a kobold, and action on behalf

of the tribe is a prayer for success.

Still, every kobold lair includes one

or two temples to Kurtulmak, limited

only by spatial con nes and mining

priorities.  These  temples  serve  as

housing for clerics and adepts and as

storage places for the tribes important

treasures, not as congregating halls for

sermons or worship. Clergy must travel

to the  ock, and clerics oversee workers

and provide support and admonishments

to keep going. In this way, religion helps

to maintain productivity. Priests help kobolds

af rm their devotion through living by the ideals

of hard work and sacri ce.

Primarily, dutiful kobolds prove their worth

through steadfast dedication to their tribe. In

this regard, kobolds who work to exhaustion are

considered upstanding role models. Kobolds who willingly

suffer injury so that the daily work can continue without

interruption are treated with praise as zealous disciples.

Finally, kobolds who sacri ce their lives to facilitate the

tribes success are remembered as folk heroes (the equiva-

lent of saints).

Every kobold mining crew includes at least one adept

whose constant presence is meant to keep kobolds strictly

motivated. Adepts also serve as onsite physicians, healing

and treating workers injuries. Kobold adepts and clerics

move among the workers, divinely bolstering stamina

where needed. For this reason, kobold adepts replace

animal trance with lesser restoration and daylight with create

food and water on their spell lists.

Besides supervising mining operations, kobold clergy

also look after the eggs and wyrmlings thought to be

reincarnations of distinguished kobolds. On a ritualistic

level, kobold clerics receive the vows of kobolds selected

by  instructors  to  become  lifelong  sorcerers.  Kobolds

worship  Kurtulmak,  but  individual  tribes  and  kobolds

might venerate another dragon deity. See Dragon Deities,

beginning on page 149, for more on draconic divinities.

KURTULMAK

Worshipers: Kobolds

Cleric Alignments: LE, LN, NE

Domains: Evil, Law, Luck, Trickery

Favored Weapon: Spear

Kurtulmak is the god of kobolds, distinguished by his large

size, mottled scales, and long tail tipped with a dreadful

stinger. Kurtulmak encourages his followers to win

battles by any means, retreat to  ght another day, and

to mete out revenge on every enemy, regardless

of how long that retribution takes to achieve.

Kurtulmak has hated gnomes ever since Garl

Glittergold collapsed a mine on him (see The

Ascension of Kurtulmak, page 50).

Cleric Training

Kurtulmaks clerics begin their careers

as miners, learning how to appreciate

the  kobold  work  ethic.  Kobolds  who

regularly sustain injuries while mining

are  selected  to  become  adepts  or  clerics

(before they end up getting killed on the

job). Such clerics train under military disci-

pline, learning doctrines for defending and

leading the kobold race.

Quests

Any task that furthers the power of the kobolds

and  their  propagation  is  a  holy  undertaking.

into gnome territories whenever possible, dealing the maxi-

mum number of casualties to the kobolds racial enemy.

Herald and Allies

Kurtulmaks herald is a  endish kobold 5th-level cleric/

5th-level sorcerer/10th-level mystic theurge. His allies are

horned devils, pit  ends, and salamanders.

Prayers

Kurtulmaks prayers have a rhythmic quality to them

that can be easily recited while swinging a pickaxe into

the ground. Many of them also contain references to

dragons and reptiles, such as O Watcher, I slither before

your scaly majesty.

Prayers to the Horned Sorcerer can also take the form

of battle cries and promises of revenge. (By the point of

Kurtulmaks spear and the tip of his poisonous tail, I will see

every member of your family perish.) Kobolds evoke the

name of Kurtulmak when facing daunting odds or dif-

 cult situations.

Temples

Kurtulmaks temples are carved out of earth and solely

used to house adepts, clerics, and the tribes most valuable

treasures. Not surprisingly, these temples are protected

with small, twisting tunnels and a staggering array of

deadly traps.

The  map  presented  here  is  a  small  portion  of  the

kobold lair known as Iejirokarthel, which is described

on page 52.

Rites

Kurtulmak guides the souls of hard-working kobolds back

to their original lair for reincarnation. His coming-of-age

ceremonies involve crafting and defeating traps.

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE

Finding traces of ancient kobold settlements has always

been dif cult. When kobolds exhaust the resources of a

mine, they abandon it, taking everything of value with

them. Left behind is only an empty lair, rich with kobold

history etched into the walls. Kobolds are excellent record-

keepers, engraving the events of their lives into the walls of

every new lair, regardless of how many times they migrate

from one location to the next.

Kobolds abandoned mines are eventually occupied by

roaming creatures that turn such lairs into their homes,

making exploration dangerous. Subterranean races have

also been known to gut old kobold lairs, knocking down

walls and reshaping the interior. Archeologists have even

discovered traces of kobold history engraved into the

corridors of ancient dwarf strongholds.

Kobolds have a scattered history, turning up in isolated

regions with absolutely no historical connection to the

place. Even taking the nomadic nature of kobolds into

account, moving from one mine to the next in search

of additional metals and precious stones, early kobolds

could not have achieved the widespread dispersal their

current whereabouts seem to indicate. For this reason,

some sages see divine agency or draconic in uence in the

common kobold.

Roleplaying Application: Every kobold is familiar

with the history of her tribe, but how much inspiration

does your kobold character draw from her ancestors? Do

you steep yourself in time-honored stories or intend

to make legends of your own? Are you informed

about the lessons learned by previous generations

or determined to learn from your own mistakes? Do

you emulate any historic kobold  gures or try to set a

new standard for other kobolds to follow?

MYTHIC ORIGIN

While Kurtulmak is reputed to be a mortal ascended

to divinity, kobolds credit Io, the Ninefold Dragon,

with their creation. It is told that when Io  rst created

true dragons, they were originally immortal gods, less

powerful than Io but much like him. To make each

one of his creations distinct, Io gave each a different

aspect of his personality. These divine dragons rarely

got along, pursuing only one goal in commonthe

acquisition of material wealth.

The true dragons quickly realized they lacked the

power to manipulate creation in all the ways neces-

sary to accomplish their goals, and they petitioned

Io for aid. Io, being an impartial god, would not play

favorites with his creations and gave each dragon the

same choice. He taught them how to create life by giving

up a piece of themselves, but he warned that in so doing,

they would permanently be rendered mortal and eventu-

ally die. The life they created, however, would serve their

desires without fail.

Perhaps not yet wise enough to appreciate their divine

existence, the dragons accepted the knowledge Io offered

and departed for the world below. They took up residence

in widely separate lands. There, the true dragons did as Io

instructed, each severing a single limb. Not only did each

limb start growing back immediately, but the severed part

also grew into an adult dragon. The original true dragons

thereby gained mates.

Furthermore, wherever the dragons blood had spilled,

little creatures began to emerge out of the ground with

alert, crimson eyes, already looking up at their creators

for guidance. Thus were kobolds born, witnesses to the

moments  during  which  the  immortality  of  the  true

dragons slipped away.

LEGENDS

Kobolds record their histories in writing. Kobold priests

and bards are expected to remember and document kobold

stories, usually by engraving such tales into the walls of

tribal lairs. The only place myths are spoken aloud with

any frequency is in the hatchery, where kobold wyrmlings

are educated on their culture and their racial history.

The Ascension of Kurtulmak

The most venerated kobold legend is the origin and ascen-

sion of Kurtulmak. While the particulars of the story vary

from tribe to tribe, a popular version is related below.

When Io gave the secret of creation to the true dragons,

the  rst dragon to put that ritual into practice was Caesin-

sjach, a green dragon. The  rst kobold to take form out of

her blood was Kurtulmak.

A kobold engraving depicts Garl collapsing Kurtulmaks mine

From the beginning, Kurtulmak was much larger than any

of his kin. For this reason, Caesinsjach always commanded

her kobolds through Kurtulmak. As a result, the towering

kobold naturally ascended to a position of leadership.

When Caesinsjach told the kobolds to mine for precious

metals, Kurtulmak invented a pickaxe. When Caesinsjach

told the kobolds to tile her lair with gold, Kurtulmak minted

the  rst draconic coin. When Caesinsjach told the kobolds

to mine precious stones, Kurtulmak taught himself sorcery

and learned how to divine where minerals were located.

When  Caesinsjachs  lair  was   nally  completed,  laden

with platinum,  lled with gold, and gleaming with gem-

stones,  she  had  become  the  wealthiest  true  dragon  in

creation. Without further need for mortal servants, she

released the kobolds from their duties to embrace their

own destiny.

In emulation of his former mistress, Kurtulmak imme-

diately began mining a lair of his own. Although he never

asked for any help in this endeavor, he nonetheless received

it, assisted by every kobold he had worked beside for the

past several decades.

Kurtulmak found a spot in the ground where a near limit-

less supply of metal ore and precious stones were waiting

to be mined. Once properly unearthed, a discovery of this

size could sustain kobolds for millennia and serve as the

foundation for their society. With Kurtulmak command-

ing the operation, it quickly became the most structurally

sound and resourcefully designed mine the world had ever

seen. Kurtulmak called it Darastrixhurthi, a fortress  t

for dragons. Nothing rivaled it.

Garl Glittergold was not pleased. He looked upon Darastrix-

had created, surpassing any achievement his own people

had mastered in the same time. While gnomes were playing

useless games, kobolds had been busy working and were now

 t to emerge as one of the dominant races in creation. And so,

with a casual wave of his hand, Garl collapsed Kurtulmaks

mine, crushing all the kobolds inside.

The gods were appalled and demanded an explanation

from Garl, who could only sputter out that his actions

were intended as a joke, as if that could somehow excuse

the heartless massacre he had committed. Garl had acted

out of spite and, even more degrading for the gnome god,

jealousy over mortal accomplishment. And yet, regardless of

all the berating Garl received from his equals, not one deity

came forward to reverse the damage done, leaving the crime

unpunished. Then Io moved on behalf of Kurtulmak.

Once the Ninefold Dragon realized that no god would

champion the kobolds, he searched through the souls

of those who died that day until he found Kurtulmaks

broken body, still clinging to life. Even buried under so

much rock, Kurtulmak wouldnt give up on his people,

refusing to let go of his mortal form until he could  nd

the strength to dig them all out.

Io gave Kurtulmak a choice. He would either empower

Kurtulmak with the strength to rebuild the mine, or he

would make the mighty kobold a champion of his people

for all eternity. In this latter case, the loss of Darastrixhurthi

would remain, but the memory of what happened would

endure in the minds of kobolds forever, ensuring that atroci-

ties of this magnitude would never be overlooked again.

Kurtulmak made his choice, and because of that deci-

sion, this story can still be told today.

Adventure Hook: Elf historians show the characters

some  charcoal  impressions  and  drawings  of  ancient

Draconic runes taken from the wall of a neglected dwarf

stronghold. The runes are certainly kobold in origin,

and they mention a fortress called Darastrixhurthi in

particular. The dwarves of the hold rebuffed questions

about the runes and soon after cordoned off the area due

to structural instability. The historians have since discov-

ered that the entire area has been slated for destruction,

and the runes they recorded were merely a small portion

of  a  larger  wall.  The  characters  must  circumvent  dwarf

security and decode the runes for the sake of history and

a nice recovery fee. In doing so, the heroes  nd out the

dwarves have greater interest in the runes than they let on,

causing both groups to race for what could be the original

kobold mine that Kurtulmak built.

Regardless of their true origins, it is widely believed

that the earliest kobolds served dragons, learning dragon

ways. This education included instruction in a variety

of Draconic dialects and accents. When kobolds became

independent, forming new tribes and lairs for themselves,

they took the Draconic language with them.

As these early, self-suf cient kobolds interacted with

each other, either for conquest or survival, their inherited

Draconic dialects mingled. These dialects gradually became

the amalgamated form of Draconic spoken by many kobolds

today. Kobold sorcerers learn how to speak true Draconic,

which requires much more exacting pronunciation.

SETTLEMENTS

Whether or not a kobold tribe enjoys prosperity, its num-

bers  invariably  swell.  Tribes  try  to  accommodate  their

growing populace by mining out additional living quarters

and enduring cramped conditions, but eventually popula-

tion overtakes space. The all-watcher then announces that

the tribe must split.

This decree marks a time of celebration for kobolds. It

means that the tribe can expand into new lands, spread-

ing the in uence of kobolds even farther and relieving

overcrowding.

The  tribe  divides  the  population  evenly,  allocating

representatives from every profession necessary to main-

tain a new kobold lair. The departing group includes a

large number of young adults with the vigor to create a

new living space from the wilderness. Older and more

experienced kobolds might join the new tribe later on,

but only after construction is well under way.

A new kobold lair must contain large veins of metal or

signi cant deposits of precious stones, preferably both. Not

content to leave  nding such a place to chance, kobolds

rely on sorcerers and priests to identify a suitable locale

for a new warren.

Kobolds never start mining a new lair until a pro table

site has been found. Such spots are scouted out well in

advance of a wandering tribe embarking on their exodus.

Scouts note potential competitors and other dangers,

determining the need for war. Common locations include

mountains with lush valleys or natural rock formations

near rivers. Natural caverns are also good, especially if the

cavern provides ample shelter without modi cation.

LANGUAGE

Kobolds speak a version of Draconic, inherited directly

from true dragons. The written form of Draconic was devel-

oped long after the spoken version, but not by dragons, who

have little need to write. The recorded history of kobolds

chronicles their relationship to dragons throughout the

ages. This history began with paintings, gave way to pic-

tograms, and gradually developed into the runic script of

Draconic still used today.

Elf scholars have objectively connected the creation of

Draconic runes to kobolds rather than dwarves, as was

previously thought. These runes have a link to dragons

from many millennia ago, when kobolds split off from

dragons either through arcane meddling or divine will.

THE KOBOLD ECONOMY

Good friends are reliable, close family members stand by your

side, and a well-chosen mate might die to protect you, but only

a kobold tribe serves without fail.

Vignarthurkear, a blue dragon giving advice

to one of her hatchlings

Kobolds have been keeping a secret about themselves for

untold millennia: Theyre rich. Not just rich as in having a

good year at the diamond mine, but as in huge, cascading

mountains of gold. They have been wealthy for a very long

time. The obvious question asks, If kobolds are so rich,

then where is all their gold? The answer to that is not

that dif cult to fathomkobold treasures line the beds

of dragons, the kobolds greatest allies.

Dragons and kobolds have been immutably linked since

there  rst were dragons and kobolds. One sprang from the

other. Dragons love precious metals and gems, and kobolds

are the most industrious of humanoids when it comes to

extracting such things from the earth. Some kobold tribes

even mint gold coins with a likeness of the dragon they serve.

Not even dwarves can compete with their productivity.

As neighboring peoples discovered the kobolds pen-

chant for mining and the kobolds discovered a demand

for their skills, the little reptiles quickly became suppliers

for realms that have no desire to do business with dwarves.

Kobolds have been quietly underselling dwarves ever

since, thanks to disguised and glamered kobold mer-

chants. As their network of business connections grew,

these merchants eventually established their own tribes,

becoming  all-watchers  themselves.  The  kobold  cycle  of

wealth is thereby sustained.

The functioning of the kobold economy gives kobolds

power on two fronts. First, kobold tribes that provide

wealth to dragons gain status among those dragons as if

they were dragons themselves. Second, once civilizations

become dependent on kobolds for metal, that region is

usually less of a threat to kobold existence and becomes

a tool in kobold schemes.

EXAMPLE LAIR: IEJIROKARTHEL

The most obvious entrance to Iejirokarthel, translated from

the Draconic as Blood Home, is located at the deepest

part of an enormous sinkhole. The sinkhole is extremely

treacherous to climb, made more so by jagged rocks near

the  opening.  The  kobold  inhabitants  of  Iejirokarthel

sharpen many of these rocks, ensuring that climbing lines

eventually slice in two.

An inconspicuous set of narrow stairs has been built

into the sinkhole wall, leading down to an entranceway

that further descends into a gloomy dungeon of roughly

hewn walls and labyrinthine corridors. This dungeon is

populated with giant vermin and undead monsters that

never disappoint adventurers in search of a challenge.

In reality, the dungeon is a front. It serves as a practice

ground for kobold trapmakers to implement their latest

inventions and for young kobolds to test their mettle against

adventurers. Iejirokarthels kobolds deliberately created

the dungeon as a ruse to de ect interest away from their

actual lair, located even deeper underground and accessed

through hidden entranceways.

The lair has 5-foot-high ceilings and a meticulous layout. Its

architecture incorporates images and sculptures of dragons

wherever space permits. Almost every wall in Iejirokarthel

is adorned with a carved depiction of kobold history.

Defensive Front

The  rst tier of this kobold lair, where it is closest to the

surface world, primarily consists of barracks for augment-

ing  sorcerers,  offensive  sorcerers,  and  warriors.  These

barracks are concentrated near each entranceway, along

with quarters for any specialists trained in maintaining

the warriors equipment.

Svent, Dire Weasel Trainer: A wide den has been

mined out here to accommodate several animals. A kobold

named Svent breeds dire weasels in this den, and he trains

them for  ghting and riding. It is one of the most raucous

parts of Iejirokarthel and definitely the most pungent,

being saturated with musk.

Irthos, Master Trapmaker: In this workshop, larger

than the spaces afforded to most kobold specialists, Irthos

designs and constructs her traps, aided by numerous

apprentices. The workshop is located close to the false

dungeon, allowing for easy access to the labyrinth.

Residential Ring

The second tier contains common living quarters. Kobold

workers and specialists eat and sleep in this area. Each

professional family deliberately groups together to occupy

the same locale. The inhabitants have diverted two springs

to form pools for swimming.

The Hatchery: If the living quarters form a gigantic wheel,

then the hub is a large chamber reserved for the hatchery.

All females come here to lay their eggs. Fosterers remain

continually vigilant over these eggs and raise the hatched

wyrmlings until they are old enough to join the tribe.

Temples of Kurtulmak: Two temples to Kurtulmak

grace this lair. One is in a mined-out area between districts

occupied by professional families where adepts and clerics

live and raise kobold wyrmlings designated for a speci c

purpose. The second is at the end of a heavily trapped cor-

ridor, quite removed from the living quarters on this level.

It is within this second temple that the tribal treasures are

safeguarded. (For a detailed map of this temple and the

route to its location, see page 49.)

Staging Area

The third tier is where most of the bustle of tribal life takes

place. Ore is processed and smelted on this level, and kobold

miners start their day here before marching into the mines.

All the practical professions congregate here, including

alchemists, blacksmiths, demolitionists, jewelers, hunters,

pragmatic and preemptive sorcerers, and stonemasons.

Verth,  All-Watcher:  The  all-watcher  of  Iejirokarthel

maintains  his  residence  here,  allowing  him  to  monitor

the daily activities of his tribe. Verth also likes to remain

near  the  most  experienced  spellcasters  of  his  lair  (the

instructors) in case preemptive sorcerers need to impart

any breaking information. Strict and practical, Verth keeps

his tribe content with demanding projects.

The  Common  Room:  As  the  largest  open  space  in

Iejirokarthel,  this  room  is  big  enough  to  accommodate

a Colossal dragon, but it is more frequently used at the

beginning of each day when the entire lair performs the

Searching  for  the  Dragon  ritual.  Bonding  ceremonies

between kobolds are also held in this room, in addition

to  sorcerer  vows.  When  not  otherwise  in  use,  which  is

most of the time, this roughly hewn room is where kobold

sorcerers train to harness their abilities.

CREATING KOBOLD

CHARACTERS

If the biggest hurdle a kobold faces is her lack of strength,

then  thats  no  obstacle  at  all.  The  moment  a  kobold

accepts her physical weakness, the more powerful she can

become through means other than brute force. Kobolds

power doesnt originate in their muscles, but from their

hereditary magicin the heart of every kobold  ows the

blood of dragons.

You should decide whether your character has undergone

the draconic Rite of Passage (see page 43), a cultural ritual

practiced since the days when the  rst dragons gave it to

kobolds. Moreover, 1st-level kobolds can choose the Drag-

onwrought feat (see page 100), becoming a dragonwrought

kobold and enjoying the bene ts of being a Small dragon.

If lack of physical strength is still a mental obstacle

for you, consider these numbers. While +2 Dexterity, 4

Strength, and 2 Constitution look like an insurmount-

able de cit, you can apply the elite array of ability scores

to a kobold sorcerer to get Strength 8 (from 12), Dexterity

15 (from 13), Constitution 12 (from 14), Intelligence 10,

Wisdom 8, and Charisma 15.

Charisma and Dexterity are both good. Low Wisdom

means a lower Will save, but this disadvantage is minor,

since Will is a good save for sorcerers. The low Strength

score is only a problem for damagethe kobolds Small

size cancels the penalty such a low score would normally

apply on attack rolls. Carrying items is no problem. Kobold

equipment weighs half as much as normal gear from the

Players Handbook, while kobolds can carry three-quarters

of what a Medium creature can.

Not only is a kobold good with ranged weapons, but also

with the help of mage armor, her Armor Class can easily

reach 18 at 1st level, factoring in size and natural armor.

Tactically, kobolds can outmaneuver dwarves, gnomes,

and hal ings with their speed. Using a longspear for its

extra reach, a kobold sorcerer should be able to adequately

protect herself.

These are mechanical advantages, which says nothing

of kobolds historical background. Kobolds come from a

lawful evil culture that treats loyalty to the tribe as the

highest ideal. Player character kobolds are no more bound

to that paradigm than a PC elf is bound to loving forests.

Still, to ignore where kobolds come from denies your

character a wealth of roleplaying opportunities. Kobolds

who spend any time away from the tribe are torn between

their  emerging  sense  of  individuality  and  their  long-

instilled tribal habits. Choosing one of these extremes

is certainly an option, but placing a kobold somewhere

in the middle of that introspective battle creates a much

more interesting dilemma.

KOBOLDS AS CHARACTERS

For kobolds, awakening the potential of sorcery within

themselves is a birthright. Nothing could be more natural.

As quick-footed creatures, kobolds can also become tal-

ented rogues. With a kobolds lack of brawn and stamina,

the  ghting professions might seem less than appealing,

but as with any vocation that kobolds embrace with deter-

mination, they are still very much possible.

Barbarian: Kobold berserkers are more common than

one might thinktheir bonuses when raging more than

negate the kobolds racial ability score penalties. A kobold

barbarian is therefore able to hold her own against most

other opponents once her draconic blood starts boiling. The

kobold does enjoy a slight advantage when raging because

the 2 penalty to Armor Class is offset by her Small size

and +1 natural armor bonus. Finally, a kobold barbarian is

capable of moving twice the speed of most other creatures

her size, giving her a signi cant tactical advantage.

Bard: As natural sorcerers, kobolds intrinsically under-

stand how bards manifest their magical abilities, using

performance as a focus. It takes very little for kobolds to

pick up this profession on the  y, drawing on their innate

aptitude for sorcery. As nimble creatures, kobold bards

also make exceptional scouts and acrobats, specializing

in tumbling to take advantage of its defensive bonuses.

Cleric:  Most  kobold  clerics  worship  Kurtulmak,  but

kobolds are not limited to that deity, especially if they have

broken with tradition and embraced an individualized path.

Io, a neutral dragon god, is more than willing to accommo-

date such kobolds. Many other dragon deities (see Dragon

Deities, starting on page 149) also accept kobold worshipers.

Kobold clerics dont usually weigh themselves down with

heavy armor, preferring speed and maneuverability.

Chapter 6: Character Options includes racial substitution

levels for any dragonblood cleric, including a kobold one.

Druid: Kobold druids are champions of underground

resources and very much at odds with their own culture.

They feel that mining without exercising restraint robs the

earth of nourishment. As such, kobold druids are usually

exiled from their lair for having counterproductive beliefs.

These kobolds sometimes attack their own tribe, using

natural traps and summoned animals. Kobold druids favor

lizards or dire weasels as their animal companions.

Fighter: A kobold  ghter favors weapons with reach

or light weapons to which the Weapon Finesse feat can

be applied, and with good reason. Kobolds prefer  ghting

styles that reward speed and cleverness, such as Spring

Attack to better execute hit-and-run tactics against slower

creatures. Kobold  ghters traditionally wear light armor

and carry crossbows or slings. Strong kobolds esteem bows

for the ease with which such weapons can be reloaded.

For alternative options for the kobold  ghter, see the kobold

racial substitution levels in Chapter 6: Character Options.

Monk: The hardworking and introspective nature of

kobolds lends itself to the disciplined monk. The inner

focus evidenced by the Searching for the Dragon ritual can

easily be directed toward the perfection of martial abili-

ties. Kobold monks take full advantage of their Dexterity,

applying Weapon Finesse to their unarmed strikes at the

earliest opportunity.

Paladin: Kobold paladins are exceedingly rare and are

almost never the product of a typical kobold tribe. Similar

to   ghters,  kobold  paladins  avoid  medium  and  heavy

armor until they acquire a special mount, which can be a

dire weasel. At this point, kobold paladins often resort to

wearing heavier armor and wielding lances, using their

mount to provide speed.

Ranger: Kobold rangers are unrelenting when tracking,

especially in pursuit of a  eeing gnome. Even after locat-

ing her prey, a kobold ranger shadows her quarry until a

good ambush position can be found. As Small creatures,

kobolds are very good at sniping from hiding, which is

only augmented by their Dexterity bonus. Most kobold

rangers choose archery as their combat style and attack

from cover.

For alternative options for the kobold ranger, see the

kobold racial substitution levels in Chapter 6: Character

Options.

Rogue: As inherently agile creatures, kobolds make skilled

rogues and talented trapmakers. Kobold rogues place even

more emphasis on agility than kobold  ghters dosneak

attacks arent about strength. Realizing this, kobold rogues

focus on Bluff, Hide, and Move Silently to maximize their

chance of catching their opponents  at-footed.

For  alternative  options  for  the  kobold  rogue,  see  the

kobold racial substitution levels in Chapter 6: Character

Options.

Sorcerer:  Kobold  sorcerers  are  preeminent  in  their

society and always regarded with deference. Kobolds can

turn to sorcery at any point in their lives with complete

con dence that their draconic heritage is always waiting

for them.

Chapter 6: Character Options includes racial substitu-

tion levels for any dragonblood sorcerer, including a

kobold one.

Wizard: Although kobold wizards are no less capable

than sorcerers, a large amount of cultural stigma is attached

to pursuing this class, as if doing so goes against every

draconic principle for which kobolds stand. It has never

been a question of whether kobolds can become power-

ful wizards, but rather why they would deny their own

heritage when the same arcane magic can be so readily

accessed from within. Kobold wizards who remain with

their tribes endure ridicule and scorn their whole lives.

KOBOLDS IN EBERRON

The kobolds of Khorvaire trace their history to the dawn of Eber-

ron. According to ancient legend, kobolds were formed from the

drops of blood shed in the battle between Eberron, Siberys, and

Khyber. A new generation of dragons descended from Siberys,

Khyber brought forth fiends and horrors, and Eberron gave birth

to the creatures of naturebut the kobolds were already there,

spawned from the first battle. True or not, this myth is the driving

force behind kobold psychology and culture.

Two subraces of kobold exist in Khorvaire: the iredar (Draconic

for ones of earth), who trace their ancestry to Eberron, and the

irvhir (Draconic for ones below), who descend from Khyber.

These two subraces share a common appearance, but each has

a distinctive body odor that kobolds can instantly detect.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Beyond scent, the key distinction between the kobold sub-

races  is  based  on  their  approach  to  magic.  Irvhir  sorcerers

typically use spells tied to corruption and darkness, while iredar

sorcerers usually have powers of defense and binding. This is

not an absolute rule, and a kobold PC can take any spell she

desires. However, an iredar kobold who makes use of spells

such as fear, darkness, or chilling touch might be viewed with

suspicion by her companions, who see these as the powers of

the Dragon Below.

Stories are told of a third subrace of kobolds: the irsvern

(Draconic for ones above), children of Siberys. According to

legend, these kobolds have wings and live in hidden communi-

ties on the peaks of the tallest mountains.

etween  the  fabulous  existence  of  dragons  and

the mundane races stand those creatures with no

home in either sphere. Half-dragons, even when

they are the product of a loving relationship, are

alone most of the time and end up having to fend

for themselves. Draconic creatures trace a much more tenu-

ous dragon ancestry, but they remain noticeably alien and

do not always  t in well. These are the dragon-descended,

whose heritage includes one or more dragons, possibly as

recently as one generation previous.

Such beings do not form communities of like individuals.

They canteach is the result of a unique circumstance,

setting him apart from not only his kin, but also from the

haughty and solitary dragons. Moreover, dragons do not look

kindly on the capricious mingling of draconic blood with

that of nondragons or even dragons of another kind.

The dragon-descended often have humanoid blood

and do interact with humanoid societies, particularly as

members of fringe groups such as adventurers. Sections

throughout this chapter describe how half-dragons and

draconic  characters  compare  to  and  contrast  with  the

humanoids among whom they usually live.

Half-dragons and draconic creatures are created using

templates. The half-dragon template appears on page 146

of the Monster Manual (with additional options found in

this book). The draconic template originally appeared in

THE HALF-DRAGON:

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Angriz Ulhargix stretched out his arms and glided

on  mottled  flaps  of  skin  down  from  the  ancient

tower. Landing lightly in the circular space of his

laboratory, he looked around the room and then

moved to the workbench, checking on the progress

of various experiments. He adjusted a  ame here,

added a measured portion of reagent there, and

mumbled a brief incantation over a sealed vessel.

Satis ed, he descended to the kitchen hearth and

stirred up the  re, adding fresh fuel to bring the

kettle to a boil for tea.

As the water heated, he jotted some notes in a

journal and leafed through loose papers on the

dining table. His cat familiar purred as she rubbed

against him, looking for head scratches and table

scraps.

Angriz needed  ne sapphires to fashion an idol, and

to get them he would have to brave the fair. Well,

there was nothing for it. It was his only chance to  55

 nd a jeweler with suitable wares, and the fair came but

once a season. The stares, the whispered comments, and

the pointing  ngersthose he could handle. Trying to

 nd a merchant who would even talk to a bastard creature

such as he, let alone deal with him, was always emotionally

draininghumiliating, even.

Youd think dragon blood would count for something,

but Angriz had never developed a talent for  nding gem-

stones. It would be so easy just to swoop in and take all he

wanted; the blue-black scales of his face drew back into

a nasty grin at the thought of it. But it had taken him so

much effort just to be allowed to stay in this ruin in peace.

Even perceived misbehavior would be enough to get him

driven out of town. Again. Perhaps that overly friendly

hal ing would be at the market today. Though a pest, the

little one had a knack for being a go-between. She actually

dealt with Angriz as an equal.

Angriz sighed and gulped down scalding tea. He took

a voluminous traveling cloak from a wall hook. Swathing

himself in its folds, he ventured into the gray morning.

THE DRACONIC CHARACTER:

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Molligrew Treebonnet was doing what she loved best,

wandering around the fair, and taking in all the sights.

She loved the bright colors and the tumblers and the

dancing and the games, as well as the wonderful treats for

sale in the market. She  itted from one booth to the next,

skipping like a child with delight. Indeed, to many of the

other fairgoers she seemed a child at  rst, barely three feet

in height with a chubby, merry face.

Molligrew was almost thirty years old, however; a mere

youth among her people, yet unnaturally childlike even

for a hal ing. Her heart was joyous and frolicsome, and

she longed to discover what delights the wide world held.

Although there had always been something different about

her, most folk couldnt help but like her immediately.

Molligrews skin shone with a bright coppery shimmer,

and her green, catlike eyes sparkled with exuberance. Her

hair looked like spun copper, bright and red, bound up in

pigtails that only emphasized her childlike appearance.

The knitted gloves she always wore, even in the summer,

were a strange quirkmost who noticed the gloves assumed

she had suffered an injury.

Today she was looking around the fair for someone

she had met last seasonsomeone so mysterious that

Molli grew just had to find out more. The tall, gloomy

stranger in the shapeless cloak had been quite stand-

offish, even rude, but that didnt keep Molligrew from

persisting. She knew that everyone liked her once they

got to know her.

He  had  been  looking  to  buy  something  unusual

though he hadnt elaboratedbut most of the vendors

had been unwilling to talk to him. Being rebuffed hadnt

done anything to improve his mood, but Molligrew just

went ahead and asked him what he was looking for. At  rst,

he tried to chase her away, saying that such a silly little

creature couldnt possibly be of any help, but after some

encouragement, he had  nally relented. He was looking, he

had said, for several gemstones of unusual provenance.

Pretty things? Molligrew had said. Theres a lady who

has armfuls of them. Comes every season. Shes right over

there. I could talk to her for you.

The strangers eyes had followed her pointing  nger, and

he had moved about uncomfortably under his cloak for a

few moments. Finally, he had produced a scrap of paper

on which some strange words were written.

Molligrew remembered a glimpse of blue-black scales

and ragged claws as she took the paper; the strangers

hand had quickly withdrawn. She had skipped off to the

jewelers booth. A few moments later, she had come back

with a list of prices, and not long after that, the stranger

had received a small pouch of gemstones.

She had refused the coin he had dif dently tried to offer

in thanks. It had been fun, after all. Then he was gone, just

like that.

Well, here it was a new season and a new fair. Molligrew

was willing to bet hed be back. Maybe she could learn

more about this stranger.

DRAGON-DESCENDED

PSYCHOLOGY

The dragon-descendedthose with some draconic traits

but not true dragonsstand apart from society. For many,

this status (or lack thereof) leads to isolation and unhappi-

ness, though some have learned to make the most of their

natural advantages.

HALF-DRAGONS

Although half-dragons have varied origins, the one thing

they share is loneliness. For most, this condition is imposed

by the nature of their existence as monstrous crossbreeds.

Some few deliberately choose this solitary path, though,

such as by entering the dragon disciple prestige class (DMG

183) or undergoing some other process.

The majority of half-dragons had no choice in their con-

ceptions. Such creatures have to deal with looking markedly

different from their parents and their parents kin. Even

half-dragons who have a loving dragon parent are raised

by the nondragon partnerusually the motherand have

little or no contact with the dragon.

A  half-dragon  raised  among  humans  or  other  short-

lived races has to deal with slower physical and emotional

growth,  despite  having  a  keen  mind.  His  monstrous

appearance leads to ostracism or worse. A half-dragons

response to such exclusion or abuse might be to withdraw

into sullen solitude, nursing a bitter hate that only rein-

forces his isolation. Or he might lash out with his fearsome

natural arsenal, killing or maiming his tormentors and

guaranteeing his exile or destruction.

Half-dragons raised among other creatures that share

their nondragon heritage mature much more slowly than

their fellows. Indeed, one might still be a child when his

grown peers are killed in battle. Even before the half-dragon

has left adolescence, the rest are dead of old age. Life is cheap

in such societies, and the parent cannot afford to devote

extra time to this one demanding child. So he usually ends

up in a group nursery, watching several groups of infants

grow and leave before he is old enough to go. He might

even be called on to assist in communal rearing, usually by

performing menial chores such

as cleaning up waste.

Years of being treated as

a child and a burden leave

scars, especially to a half-

dragon  with  active  and

inquisitive  intelligence.

He  typically  leaves  the

tribe as soon as he can de-

fend  himself  adequately.

Very occasionally, though,

a  half-dragon  rises  to  a

position of leadership with-

in  the  tribe  by  virtue  of

his intelligence, superior

strength, and natural abili-

ties. (A blast of dragon  re

has  a  way  of  convincing

challengers to back down.)

Led by a half-dragon chief-

tain, a horde of orc raiders

becomes an even greater

destructive force.

Human  societies  can

range from open-minded

to superstitious and bigoted

when it comes to half-dragon

children. A half-dragons fright-

ening  appearance  and  terrible

weaponry become obstacles to

acceptance  in  any  situation.  If

he is raised in an accepting so-

ciety, a half-dragon can enjoy a

normal childhood, although he

must still contend with his slow

maturation. Such beings develop a

draconic patience and a long-term

outlook. Those who have the misfortune

to live in a narrow-minded society are

likely to end up hidden in a back room

or even in a shed, treated like an animal.

Sometimes a metallic dragon (often silver) favors an elf

with its affection. Both are long-lived beings and share a

magical nature. They have similar outlooks on life and

moral duty.

The offspring of such a union is considered a special

blessing, and the dragon parent might even remain near

the elf community and participate in rearing the child.

The community elders take a special interest in awakening

the magical potential of the half-dragon.

Held up to impossible standards, subjected to intense

schooling, and kept separate from others his age, the half-

dragon often  nds it hard to mature socially. The pressure

to perform takes its toll, manifesting as emotional and

physical outbursts alternating with deep depression. Many

such children leave home as soon as they are able. Those

who continue in wizardly training can rise to in uential

positions, but they can also be emotionally distant.

Drow are a special case. Evil dragons can lair near drow

cities and form alliances with the dark elves. Deep dragons

in particular (see Monsters of Faern, page 40) might take

drow form and consum-

mate a relationship with

a high priestess, the head

of a house, or some other

powerful individual.

The  child  of  such  a

union becomes a prized

tool  in  the  ever-swirling

intrigues of drow society.

Leaders of the half-dragons

house  jealously  guard

the  creature,  attempt-

ing to keep its existence

secret from other drow

who  would  try  to  steal

or destroy it. The child has

no say in its upbringing; a

male is placed in a school of

wizardry, and a female is sent

to serve in the temple.

Much  like  with  half-

dragons in other elf societies,

the  pressure  to  perform  can

lead to extreme emotional im-

balance, made even worse by

the brutality of internecine

drow con ict. Usually this

mindset  is  useful  to  drow

culture, and such beings end

up in positions of great pow-

er. Those who do not learn

to survive and overcome are

summarily destroyed.

A half-dragons lot is always

to be apart from everyone

Dragons  rarely  take

dwarves  as  mates.  This  fact

seems odd at  rst blush, since

both  types  of  creatures  are

stubborn and often covetous, but

these factors also drive dragons and dwarves

apart. Dwarf communities, although close-

knit, are isolated and dif cult to reach. Dwarves predilection

for killing dragons and seizing their hoards also limits the

opportunities for crossbreeding.

Halflings and gnomes also produce few half-dragons.

Most dragons consider these races to be silly and inconse-

quential, although individual hal ings and gnomes might

decide to buck the stereotype.

DRACONIC CHARACTERS

The ancestry of a draconic character is diluted compared

to that of a half-dragon. Such beings might retain super -

cial details of the ancestral dragon variety, but such is not

necessarily the case. They more often inherit some of their

ancestors personality traits (see below).

A touch of dragon in ones bloodline can come from a

number of situations. Sometimes its the result of arcane

meddling, mixing elements of draconic blood with that of

other creatures. More often, a draconic creature is descended

from the union of a half-dragon and some other being. Two

half-dragons  usually  produce  half-dragon  children,  but

about one in four are draconic creatures instead.

10/25/05   12:10:13 PM

The descendants of dragons retain some of the charac-

teristics of their forebears, probably due in part to dragons

tendency to mate with creatures of similar bents. Ogres,

orcs, drow, and members of other brutal or harsh cultures

reinforce their existing tendencies with the blood of evil

dragons.  The  playful  nature  of  copper  dragons  is  most

commonly manifested in gnome and hal ing descendants.

Draconic elves display the patience and wisdom of gold and

silver dragons. Draconic kobolds can re ect the personalities

of any sort of dragon, but they are most likely to resemble

the evil or neutral dragons of earth and deep places.

A draconic humanoid can sometimes pass as a typical

member of her race, with her draconic features comple-

menting  her  existing  talents.  Such  individuals  usually

enjoy  normal  lives  unless  their  society  is  intolerant  of

even minor variation. Even so, a draconic characters sharp

claws can be dif cult to explain. Some hide this obviously

alien feature, while others exploit itclaws are handy in

a  ght.

Other draconic beings are visibly different, to the extent

that they are sometimes mistaken for half-dragons.They

are liable to experience loneliness and misunderstanding

similar to that of half-dragons, so they are drawn to others

like  them.  In  fact,  teams  of  half-dragon  and  draconic

creatures make for excellent adventuring parties.

Draconic characters might not understand why they

are different from their kinfolk. The in uence of a dragon

bloodline could be so far buried in the past that the appear-

ance of such a being is a random  uke. A draconic character

knows she is different somehow and might feel an unac-

countable longing to see real dragons, but she might never

know the truth of her lineage.

Roleplaying Application: Is your character aware of

her draconic heritage? Did her people once live in a closer

relationship with true dragons? What is their attitude

toward a child with dragon blood? Do they recognize her

for what she is?

DRAGON HERITAGE AND BEHAVIOR

The presence of dragon blood in ones heritage, however

slight, affects ones outlook on life. Draconic characters

share some tendencies of the dragons from whom they are

descended, but these characteristics are not overwhelm-

ing. Dragon parentage strongly colors a half-dragons

personality, however, causing the half-dragon to share the

same alignment and demeanor. A player character might

be the rare exception whose alignment differs from the

norm, but others are likely to react to a half-dragon based

on their assumptions about that dragons usual nature.

Even if he shares the dragon parents alignment, a half-

dragons personality is shaped by the nondragon society

into which he was born.

Here are some roleplaying suggestions for incorporating

the traits of the ten true dragons in the Monster Manual

into your half-dragon character.

Black: You are sly and incisive, which might suit you

well for the paths of the rogue and assassin. Your darkly

tinged  esh also aids in such endeavors. You tend to be

unpredictable and violent. Your tendencies might favor

rapid advancement in societies that value them but make

you the object of suspicion in most others.

Blue: You are vain and acquisitive, proud and  erce.

These latter qualities serve  ghters and barbarians well,

while a rogue might make the best use of the former. Your

lawful alignment allows you to be a monk, although you

are more interested in physical perfection than mental

discipline. You love to display your prowess and boast

about your achievements. You prefer to do things on your

own, which can cause friction in a group situation.

Green: You are belligerent and tyrannical, preferring

to strike  rst and ask questions later. You like to throw

your weight around, so you make an excellent brawler or

barbarian. Brutish and warlike cultures value these quali-

ties, but in a civilized setting, you might be a mercenary

or a gladiator. If you become a cleric, you tend to serve a

deity of strength, conquest, and violence.

Red: You are haughty and covetous, valuing personal

wealth and glory above all else. Youre a natural sorcerer,

since you rely on the force of your personality to acquire

riches and power. Greed and pride drive you toward a

life of adventure. You cant get enough of preening and

admiring yourself in front of a mirror. The reddish hue

of your  esh resembles the skin tones of goblinoids, and

you might become a great leader among them.

White:  You  are  brutish  and  hedonistic,  especially

enjoying visceral pleasures. Likely born in the cold north-

lands, you are uncomfortable in warm environments. The

children of white dragons make excellent wilderness

travelers, particularly rangers.

Brass: You are the chatty type. You love to engage in

conversation, which is to say talk at length without letting

another get a word in. The bard class is a natural choice

for  you.  Youre  usually  good-hearted,  despite  earning  a

reputation as a bore. Although half-dragons are rare among

the small folk, half-brass dragons who appear in hal ing

or gnome communities  t in very well.

Bronze: You are curious and brave, and you have a soft

spot for animals. As a child, you probably had a favored pet

or even a bedraggled stray to keep you company without

prejudice  or  question.  Perhaps  you  ran  away  from  your

community to take up a life in the wilderness. The children

of bronze dragons have a natural af nity for the druid and

ranger classes. Those born into wild elf communities (MM

104) are often treated as equals.

Copper: You love tricks and jests, but youre a bit greedy.

This personality lends itself well to the bard and the rogue

classes and complements a hal ings demeanor perfectly.

You might have reacted to your unusualness by becoming a

prankster or used your inherent magic to produce entertain-

ing effects. You desperately want to be liked by everyone

you meet, and you become petulant if rejected.

Gold: You are wise and patient. You value examining

and discussing a situation at length more than undertaking

hasty action, but you are committed to a course once you

have made a decision. You have a strong sense of justice. The

offspring of gold dragons are most likely to become clerics

or paladins, usually serving deities of justice and order.

Silver: Youre a people person. Thats how you were con-

ceived, after allsilver dragons love to spend time among

humanoids. The individuals around you might not respond

as you wish, either putting you on a pedestal or turning a

cold shoulder, but you persist in trying to form friendships

and can be deeply hurt when your affection is not returned.

Silver half-dragons are drawn to classes that aid and support

others, becoming clerics who focus on healing or druids

within rural communities.

DRAGON-DESCENDED HERITAGE

Both draconic and half-dragon characters sometimes dis-

cover their heritage. In fact, knowing that heritage can be

vital to unlocking a particular power. Many who discover

their heritage are proud of it, and they shout their ancestry

to the heavens. However, not all dragon-descended see

draconic ancestry as a boon. For such characters, the Rite

of Draconic Affinity (described below) can help put a

distasteful ancestry behind them once and for all.

Rite of Draconic Affinity

The Rite of Draconic Affinity changes your draconic

heritage from one kind to another.

Changing  ones  draconic  heritage  is  rarely  a  dif cult

decision. Most dragon-descended creatures never think

of doing so, but a few decide their ethos doesnt match

their heritage. For instance, a half-dragon paladin may

decide that his black dragon fathers blood is too much of

an obstacle to overcome. On the other hand, a backbiting

sorcerer might feel his gold dragon mothers blood keeps

him from being all he can be.

When the rite begins, the participant spends 24 hours

fasting and meditating, all the while anointing himself

with the distilled essence of the dragon type he wishes

to take on (see Cost).

Prerequisites: Only half-dragons or other characters

with a de ned draconic heritage (such as those who select

the Draconic Heritage feat, described on page 102) can

undergo the Rite of Draconic Af nity. A dragon or half-

dragon of the kind the recipient wishes to acquire must

perform the ritual, and that creature must have 10 ranks

in Knowledge (arcana).

During the last minute of the ritual, the participant

stands and is subjected once to the breath weapon of the

performer of the rite. After feeling the breath and taking

damage from it, the participant sheds his old heritage for

the chosen new one.

Bene  t: You change the kind of dragon in your heritage

to a different kind of dragon. The new kind of dragon must

have an alignment no more than one step away from yours.

For example, a chaotic evil half-red dragon can choose from

among black, brown, chaos, crystal, deep, fang, howling,

pyroclastic, sand, shadow, song, Styx, Tarterian, topaz, tun

mi ling, and white. A character with the Draconic Heritage

feat replaces the original heritage with the new one.

All manifestations of your draconic heritage change to

match the new dragon kind, including physical appearance,

breath weapon type, and all other bene ts. For example, a

half-dragon who removes red dragon and replaces it with

blue dragon loses immunity to  re and gains immunity

to electricity. His breath weapon changes from a cone of

 re to a line of electricity.

If your class skill list changes (usually due to the change

in your Draconic Heritage feat), previously purchased skill

ranks remain but future ranks are purchased using your

new class skill list.

If you no longer qualify for a feat due to the transforma-

tion, you lose the feat and immediately select a new feat for

which you qualify in its place. If the lost feat is a prerequisite

for another feat, you must also replace that feat.

If  you  no  longer  qualify  for  a  prestige  class,  you  lose

the bene t of any class features or other special abilities

granted by the class, gaining nothing in return. You retain

Hit Dice, base attack bonus, and saving throw bonuses

gained from advancing in the class.

Time: The Rite of Draconic Af nity requires 24 hours

of fasting and meditation. If the rite is interrupted, it is

spoiled and must be started again.

Cost: This rite requires special oils costing 5,000 gp.

DRAGON-DESCENDED LIFE

The nature of a dragon-descended creatures life depends

greatly on how he is perceived by and how he interacts

with the nondraconic beings around him.

HALF-DRAGONS

Isolated as they are, half-dragons develop solitary pursuits

involving intellectual stimulation and discovery. A half-

dragon derives great pleasure from testing himself against

ever greater challenges.

Leisure

Enjoying long lives, as well as their ancestors materialism,

half-dragons are collectors par excellence. They obsess

about acquiring the  nest pieces for their collections, with

interests that often mirror those of their draconic parent.

A half-blue dragon often covets  ne gems and jewels,

especially sapphires, while a half-gold dragon becomes

an art connoisseur. Once collected, a piece never leaves

its owners treasury, and the half-dragon happily spends

hours at a time looking over his treasures.

Half-dragons enjoy reading, and they maintain libraries

as extensive as they can afford. Those who practice the

arcane arts in particular boast immense collections of

tomes. Such love of reading comes naturally to the lonely

and gifted. Sometimes a bookish young half-dragon earns

the rude nickname bookwyrm.

Magic, especially of an arcane variety, is a prized pursuit

of any half-dragon not soured on spellcasting by childhood

lessons.  Half-dragons  are  innately  magical  beings,  and

their own bodies provide powerful ingredients and foci

for magical effects.

Dragons are ravenous creatures and fearsome hunters.

Their progeny share these qualities. The life of a lone

hunter appeals to the reclusive nature of some half-dragons.

Others instead become epicures, if not outright gluttons,

and indulge themselves in rare delicacies. Such creatures

might travel the world in search of new culinary experi-

ences or pay handsomely for samples brought from distant

lands. Many have a weakness for wine or spirits, and even

though  their  stout  constitutions  make  them  harder  to

inebriate, they just drink more to make up for it.

Arts and Crafts

Artistic interest and talent usually  ows from the human-

oid parent rather than the dragon one. Although dragons

love to look at and possess  ne works of art, they are seldom

interested in creating such objects. Half-dragons born to

brutish folk, such as goblinoids, care little for artistic trea-

sures except as loot to sell for something more useful.

On the other hand, those with elf or dwarf heritage often

possess an innate talent for creating  ne works. Provided

the community has accepted such a half-dragon and allowed

him to pursue his own interests, he might eventually stand

in history alongside the most famed artisans of that race.

With their sorcerous nature, half-dragons are especially

talented at crafting magic items.

Technology and Magic

The  very  blood  and  flesh

of  dragons  is  magical.  Half-

dragons  inherit  much  of  this

arcane power, making them nat-

urally suited to the spellcasting

classes. Those sharing the blood

of elves or other magically gifted

folk have the potential to become

masters of magic, archmages and

loremasters of the highest abili-

ty. No arcane secret is beyond a

keen  intellect  combined  with

great patience.

However,  half-dragons  can

be prone to the negative aspects

of draconic personality. Often

conservative in thought, half-

dragons can be unwilling to

look at things in new waysa

tendency that increases with

age.  Possessiveness  can  also

be an obstacle to a half-drag-

ons  magical  development,

for  once  he  has  acquired

a  bit  of  magical  lore,  he  is

many  times  unwilling  to

exchange that knowledge for

anothers. Rather, half-dragons

embark on secret expeditions to unearth

long-lost fragments of knowledge, having

spent long hours in solitary research, or they conduct arcane

experiments to devise unique magic.

The offspring of metallic dragons might be gifted in

divine magic, although they are more likely to worship

draconic deities or spirits of nature than they are humanoid

pantheons. Half-dragon clerics are not common, but those

who exist hold a position of special honor in the worship

of Io, the Ninefold Dragon (described on page 155).

Both sorcerers and wizards are common among half-

dragons,  though  sorcerers  are  more  numerous.  This

tendency toward arcane spellcasting is a natural conse-

quence of half-dragons isolation, which compels them to

explore and train their innate magical abilities. Half-dragon

elves are usually wizards.

Dragons rarely create magic items, mostly because of

physical limitations. Half-breed offspring who are gifted

with hands are not so restricted. Nothing is more pleasing

to a half-dragons eye than a beautiful object of magic made

with his own skills. Once completed, though, such an item

is unlikely to be used or even seen by another individual.

Some of the bitter and resentful crossbreeds specialize in

producing weapons and other magic items dedicated to

destroying dragons. Such devices might be bane weapons

against the dragon parents kind or the dragon kind that

is the parents traditional enemy.

Mundane  technology  holds  little  interest  for  half-

dragons.  Creatures  to  whom

magic  comes  so  easily  rarely

see  the  value of complex ma-

chinery  when  a  spell  can  do

as well or better. Nor do they

have much patience with al-

chemy, which to them is a pale

shadow  of  true  magic.  Those

raised  in  a  human  society  or

among  gnomes  might  gain

exposure to these sciences, but

very few embrace them. For

many half-dragons, scienti c

inventions are fads that seem

to pass as quickly as the short

lives of their creators.

Love

The  desire  for  companion-

ship  and  acceptance  aches

in  the  breast  of  a  half-drag-

on,  but  at  the  same  time,  it

founders in a sea of anguish.

Whether  rejected,  set  apart,

or  idolized,  half-dragons  usu-

ally end up masking or even

suppressing their emotions.

Sadly,  this  situation  only

reinforces  their  image  as

aloof  loners,  so  that  their  hu-

manoid  cousins  shun  them  even

morea  vicious  circle  of  solitude  and

despair.  Such  individuals  usually  resign

themselves  to  being  unhappy  and  alone

all their lives.

If another being displays interest in or affection for a

half-dragon, his  rst response is likely to be distrust. Pain-

ful experience has taught that others approach him only

when he is useful. If he responds at all, he is often surly

and sarcastic. He makes himself as unlikable as possible,

both because doing so is safer than opening himself up

to more pain and as a test of the others intentions. If the

other persists in attempting contact despite such a strong

disincentive,  the  half-dragon  accepts  the  possibility  of

being genuinely liked and reciprocates tentatively.

Once a half-dragon is convinced of shared, true affection,

he throws himself headlong into the relationship. Having

discovered true love for the  rst time, a half-dragon is not

about to let go of it. He can easily become jealous of others

who  seem  unduly  interested  in  his  beloved  and  might

insist on spending every moment in that ones company.

Few can endure such smothering attentions for long, but

a beloved who tries to escape might risk the half-dragons

Half-dragons are obsessive readers

and collectors of books

deadly rage. These dark tendencies are more common in

the progeny of evil dragons, but the possessive nature of

all dragons manifests itself to some degree in love. As a

result, the best mate for a half-dragon is usually another

half-dragon or a crossbreed creature with a similarly lonely

background. The two cling to one another with a  erceness

dif cult for others to understand.

Very rarely, a half-dragon enters a romantic relationship

with a true dragon. Other dragons look on such couplings

with distaste, as further muddying of bloodlines, so the

lovers must share an isolated existence.

Roleplaying Application: What is your characters expe-

rience with love? Was he isolated from birth, or accepted

to some degree in his society? Has he ever had his heart

broken? Can he ever trust another individual enough to

love truly? Is he the type who worships a beloved in the

tradition of courtly love, or is he consumed with posses-

siveness and jealousy?

Half-Dragons at War

Being apart from the society into which they are born,

half-dragons do not often become involved in the martial

traditions of that society. Sometimes this state of affairs

is simply due to bigotry and distrust. The community is

unwilling to train such a dangerous monster in even more

lethal techniques. Other times, a half-dragon is too deeply

immersed in arcane study to learn military arts. Mostly,

half-dragons feel no sense of duty to a community that has

rejected them. Much as dragons do, they  ght only when

its suits their purposes or in defense of their property.

Half-dragons do have formidable natural armament

in the form of teeth, claws, and a breath weapon. Those

with wings are capable of swift and maneuverable  ight,

sometimes taking feats, such as Flyby Attack or Hover,

that enhance their aerial combat abilities.

Most half-dragons try to stay at a distance and dispatch

a threat with breath weapon or spells. If hand-to-hand

 ghting is unavoidable, a half-dragons vitality, strength,

and ferocity make him a redoubtable opponent.

In  a  very  few  cases,  a  half-dragon  takes  on  a  position

of great authority. For instance, cultures that value brute

strength in their leaders might elevate half-dragons to war

chiefs, sending them on the most dangerous and potentially

most rewarding missions. Such beings are fully aware they

are seen as expendable, but they channel their anger at such

treatment into furious battle and bringing back prodigious

spoils. Having proven their prowess at war and leadership,

such half-dragons advance rapidly in the hierarchy of their

people.

Most  half-dragons  never  become  part  of  an  army  or

even a ragtag warband. They either make their own way

and  ght their own battles or join a band of like-minded

outcasts to turn their talents to lucrative challenges.

Roleplaying Application: What is your characters

attitude toward organized warfare? Did the society in

which he was raised treat him as an equal, as a traitor, or

as an expendable? Does he have any military experience?

Does he desire a leadership position? Is he interested in

 ghting only for himself, or is there a greater cause for

which he might lay down his life?

Death

A dragons life span is truly remarkableit can live a mil-

lennium or longer, and even at the end of its life transform

into a permanent part of the land or become ascendant

and immortal. Half-dragons usually share the heritage of

a less long-lived race and so might endure no more than a

few centuries. Still, they are granted far more time than

most, and those born of a dragonelf union can challenge

ancient wyrms for longevity.

Most half-dragons covet life as they do so many things.

They often seek ways to prolong life by magical means.

Some explore dark paths that lead to undeath or even worse,

such as grafting  endish spirits to themselves. Others seek

an apotheosis to make them true dragons at last. They do

not risk their lives needlessly, but the quest for immortality

is worth taking the chance.

Some  half-dragons   nd  the  burden  of  a  half-breed

existence more than they can bear. They indulge in lonely,

sad thoughts of death that often take the form of fantasies

in which a grieving community  nally realizes the half-

dragons true worth. Suicide is not a seriously considered

option, though.

Such af icted creatures might turn their black moods

to  creating  supremely  mournful  works  of  art  or  music.

Others might set out on dangerous journeys, hoping for

reward but not caring much if they do not return. A few

seek to renounce their dragon heritage entirely, becoming

wholly humanoid and, they hope,  nding acceptance at

the cost of a shorter life.

In  either  case,  half-dragons  do  not  usually  share  the

religious outlook of humanoids. Racial deities in particu-

lar offer no sense of belonging. Nor do dragon deities,

other than Io, hold much meaning for these mis ts. A

half-dragon makes his own religious choice based on his

experience and the color of his soul, and his thoughts on

the afterlife re ect that choice.

DRACONIC CHARACTERS

Draconic characters are tougher, stronger, and more self-

con dent than those who do not have dragon blood. Many

exploit these advantages to the fullest.

Leisure

Draconic characters dont live much longer than their ordi-

nary kin, even though their draconic stamina gives them

a better chance of surviving to old age. Thus, they do not

focus on long-term activities as much as half-dragons.

A draconic creatures interests are often colored by the

nature of her dragon ancestor. Thus, a descendant of a lung

dragon (from Oriental Adventures) has a philosophical bent

and might be scholarly or interested in art. Someone with

green dragon blood tends to be aggressive, interested in

boxing or other contact sports. The scion of a brass dragon

can happily spend hours in conversation.

Sharp claws make it dif cult to pursue activities that

require  ne manipulation. Draconic pastimes therefore

tend to those focusing on physical strength and endurance.

A draconic creature might be a champion long-distance

runner, for example.

Arts and Crafts

Because delicate craftwork does not come easily to clawed

hands, draconic creatures rarely focus on crafts requiring

intricate detail. Other than that, their interests span the

range of those favored by their mundane kinfolk.

Dragon heritage still tilts a draconic creatures prefer-

ences. Descendants of greedy, sel sh dragons show little

interest in artistic pursuits, especially if they are members

of boorish societies. Those with the blood of aesthetically

inclined dragons are more attracted to the arts.

In particular, draconic characters prefer the performing

arts. Singing in particular is a strength. Performers, already

viewed  as  odd,  have  no  trouble  assimilating  a  not-quite-

human member into the troupe. Talent is the only criterion.

Draconic characters tend naturally toward the bard class.

Roleplaying Application: Is your character artistically

talented? Does she perform professionally or just sing to

herself? Maybe she is someone who always entertains her

companions. Does her performing bring pleasure to those

around her, or is it an irritant?

Technology and Magic

Where half-dragons truly are of the dragon clan and are

strongly inclined to all things arcane, draconic characters

are far enough distant from their ancestors to feel less tied

to  magic.  Certainly,  they  carry  the  potential  for  arcane

power and can awaken it more readily than those without a

draconic heritageit just doesnt infuse their beings in the

same way. As a result, draconic characters are just as likely to

engage in technological invention as in arcane study.

If a draconic character is interested in magic, she looks

to amplify her existing talents. Shes not usually interested

in pure power but sees magic as a useful tool, and she has

a better aptitude for understanding and operating magic

items than others of her race.

Love

Unlike  half-dragons,  who  are  so  often  lonely,  draconic

characters are less likely to be rejected by the society they

live in. Ultimately, how they are treated depends largely

on their appearance.

If  her  dragon  blood  complements  features  seen  as

attractive within her society, a draconic character might

be  a  rare  beauty  to  her  people.  (Claws  can  always  be

trimmed and painted, after all.) An elf with silver dragon

ancestry  might  have  shimmering  eyes,  a  slight  gleam

to the skin, and a graceful carriage that all enhance her

beauty.

On the other hand, if the dragon ancestor is incompat-

ible with a societys standards of beauty, its descendant

might never  nd a mate. A dwarf descended from a black

dragon, with a gaunt face, sunken eyes, and a hint of horns

would be seen as aberrant. Clan responsibilities might

give her a home and a role, but not a husband.

Draconic  characters  who  display  strong  draconic

features can be mistaken for half-dragons. Their obvious

monstrousness keeps them apart from society, sometimes

condemning such unfortunates to despair or even self-

hatred. As with half-dragons, they react intensely should

they  nd someone who truly cares for them.

Half-dragons and draconic characters can make devoted

couples, and most of their offspring are draconic. Such

children, raised in environment of intense caring, usually

grow up to be con dent and well-adjusted individuals.

War

A draconic character who is integrated into her society is

as likely as any other to enter a military profession or serve

in a community militia. Indeed, her physical superiority

makes her well suited to a martial career. Gifted with a

strong personality, a draconic character has the potential

to rise to a position of command.

A draconic character who is isolated from her community

is more likely to leave early, making her own way in the

world and relying on her physical abilities to survive.

Death

A draconic character eventually learns that she isnt as

easy to kill as those around her. Shes less likely to suc-

cumb to a disease or a poisonous bite, and she can endure

greater wounds than her kin. This usually leads to one of

two results.

The  rst is a sense of invulnerability. Even more than is

typical for youths, the draconic character begins to believe

she can take on any challenge and survive any peril. She

becomes reckless with her life, seeking out ever-greater

thrills. Such creatures end up either dying young, perhaps

as an unsuccessful adventurer, or becoming distinguished

for the ability to accomplish unlikely tasks.

The second reaction is crushing guilt. Facing the same

enemies in battle or assaulted by the same natural forces,

the  draconic  character  survives  while  her  family  and

companions do not. She already knew she was different

somehow, and now she seems unjustly favored by fate.

She might withdraw completely from society, leaving the

community for a hermits existence. Alternatively, she

might decide to throw away her life in some grand gesture,

such as killing a terrible monster, which can also lead to

an adventurers lifeif she ends up surviving.

Dragon deities and draconic ideas of the afterlife are not

important to draconic characters, who are too far removed

from their dragon ancestors to feel much connection. They

see life and death, and whatever follows, much as their

community does.

DRAGON-DESCENDED

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Where draconic characters are usually included in their

communities, half-dragons are rarely part of the culture

into which they were born. Each individual creates his

own cultural space, perhaps corresponding to a physical

place, in which he nurtures his personal values. This

is  a  safe  refuge  for  a  bullied  outsider  or  a  pressured

student, where the unfair expectations of others cannot

intrude.  Outside  this  safe  zone,  a  half-dragon  must

choose between trying to fit in with his surroundings

and asserting his individuality.

Attempting to conform to the standards of a biased

community is very difficult, but such efforts receive a

warm reception in an unbiased culture. This warmth,

unfortunately, can be coupled with condescension and

unwarranted interest in everything the half-dragon does.

People who truly want to be open and understanding

often have their actions interpreted as condescending.

This  behavior  can  be  as  irritating  to  a  half-dragon  as

outright discrimination.

Many half-dragons dont bother trying to be the same as

everyone around them. They know theyre not the same,

and its denying their true nature to pretend they are.

Such behavior is also true of draconic characters who

have abnormal features or whose draconic personality is at

variance with community standards. They might even take

a perverse pleasure in shocking their humanoid neighbors,

going out of their way to be exotic. This can include wear-

ing revealing clothing that emphasizes draconic qualities,

highlighting claws with color, affecting a crest or horns if

they do not already sport such features, and similar things.

They might indulge in vandalism, setting  res with their

breath, for example.

Draconic mis ts could fall in with a bad crowd, if any

such will have them, but more often, they strike out on

their own as soon as they are able. These pariahs are the

most likely to seek a life of adventure. In an adventuring

band, draconic appearance and abilities are interesting

and useful rather than freakish.

No true half-dragon communities exist. For one thing,

these crossbreeds are much more rare than humanoids

such as half-orcs. As well, despite the pain and loneliness

that de nes most of their existence (or perhaps because

of it), half-dragons just dont get along that well with one

another. The prejudices held by chromatic dragons toward

metallic, and vice versa, still express themselves in half-

dragons, and the vastly differing personalities even within

similar  dragon  types  can  lead  to  friction.  Half-dragons

also have an inclination to wander, which works against

founding stable settlements.

Instead, small bands of half-dragons and their draconic

companions sometimes form itinerant encampments. Such

groups move from fair to festival to market, although they

are sometimes driven away by suspicious townsfolk before

they can even unpack. They usually set up in out-of-the-way

locales not too far from a humanoid town in which they

can acquire needed supplies and sell their wares, keeping

the camp hidden and well-guarded.

Such groups contain from three to six half-dragons,

usually specializing in different trades; sometimes they

are professional adventurers and represent the typical

mix of classes found in a party. They are accompanied

by draconic mounts, hunting creatures, or pets (often

augmented animals) and may have hangers-on with or

without dragon heritage.

A  traveling  camp  is  a  haven  of  comfort  in  a  hostile

world, but because of the frictions that arise between the

dragon-descended, its composition is always in  ux. Older

members  leave  to  pursue  their  own  interests,  although

they might return after a time to revitalize and enjoy the

company of others who accept their nature. New members

might sign on for a while to  ll an open role. Camp follow-

ers, such as farriers or seasonal workers, drift in an out as

their work demands. Sometimes nondraconic adventurers

are part of the group while it ful lls a speci c mission.

DRAGON-DESCENDED

AND OTHER RACES

The dragon-descended are a highly variable breed, in both

appearance and attitude. Some generalities can be made

about their views of other creatures, however.

HALF-DRAGONS

Awkwardness and resentment color half-dragons relation-

ships with other beings. Strangeness and solitude are their

constant companions, whether worn as a protective cloak

or a de ant crest.

Draconic Characters: Half-dragons might not imme-

diately recognize a draconic character as being different

from his humanoid kin, but might still feel a subconscious

attraction to or interest in the character. If a half-dragon

comes to realize that he is dealing with a draconic char-

acter, he might wish his own lineage were less obvious,

envying the draconic characters ability to blend in. In the

case of a draconic character who has strong features, a half-

dragon reacts much as he would to another half-dragon.

Dragonborn: Half-dragons can only wonder at those

who deliberately become dragonblood creatures and will-

ingly take on the social problems and the advantages of

that choice. They respect such devotion to the Platinum

Dragon, at the same time feeling that the dragon god has

little interest in them. Should a half-dragon encounter one

of these devotees, he is likely to be full of questionsif

he can overcome his usual reticence.

Dwarves: Half-dragons hold a grudging admiration

for these stout folk. They respect dwarves patience, self-

suf ciency, and appreciation for the treasures of the earth.

The also envy the cohesive structure of dwarven society,

in which everyone has a role and gains satisfaction in

ful lling it. The children of earth dragons and those of

the deep places feel particular attraction for dwarves.

Half-dragons exhibit a strong individualism that clashes

with the expectations of dwarven society. Thus, they usu-

ally meet dwarves as part of an adventuring party. In such

circumstances,  ghting side by side against terrible enemies,

the two come to recognize that they share certain strengths

and treat each other with reserved acceptance.

Elves: The lives of half-dragons and elves are intertwined

in ways that bring them together and simultaneously

wrench them apart. As described earlier, half-dragons

born to elven communities are expected to ful ll a role

assigned to them by virtue of their nature. Individuality

and long life, as well as easy familiarity with magic, would

seem to make them allies, but the pressure to perform

usually alienates the half-dragon. Those who accept their

role  among  elves  are  respected  leaders.  Elf  society  is

more likely than others to welcome a half-dragon born

to another humanoid race, and a community with a half-

dragon elder might even be a haven for such outcasts.

As adventurers, half-dragons share the elven talent for

marrying martial prowess with magical skill. The path

of the bladesinger (see Complete Warrior, page 17) suits a

half-dragon elf very well.

Gnomes: Half-dragons look on gnomes as  ighty and

beneath their notice. Unfair as this is, its an attitude shared

by many races. Its also a barrier to the chance for true

friendship, since gnomes appreciate many of the qualities

in half-dragons that others see as off-putting and bizarre.

Gnomes admire the physical beauty of dragons as well as

their keen intellect and aesthetic sense, but a true dragon

is not easy to approach. Someone with humanoid features

who also has draconic talents would make a splendid

companion for conversation, song, and artistic pursuits.

The moodiness and prejudice of half-dragons, though,

discourages such relationships. If thrown together in a

situation that requires cooperation, half-dragons might

acknowledge that gnomes have their uses, but even so,

the two rarely become close friends.

Half-Elves: Accustomed to bridging two very different

worlds, half-dragons and half-elves share a certain kinship.

A half-dragon is as likely to  nd acceptance among half-

elves as he is anywhere else, perhaps more so. Given their

elf heritage and af nity for magic, half-dragons are valued

as members of some half-elf communities.

Half-Orcs: Now these folks have some understanding

of how it feels to be the object of prejudice. If a half-orc

and a half-dragon actually speak to each other, they might

recognize how much they have in common. Should a

half-orc  and  a  half-dragon  meet  in  their  wanderings,

a solid friendship might develop. Usually the half-orc

makes the  rst move, hoping a half-dragon mis t might

be more accepting of him than pureblooded humanoids.

Such advances are surprising to a half-dragon, but if he

can control his initial suspicion, he quickly warms to this

kindred spirit. Sharing great strength and furious hearts,

half-orc and half-dragon barbarians might rage side by side

in a warband or adventuring group.

Hal  ings: Like gnomes, hal ings seem silly to half-

dragons, who dont recognize the toughness of these little

folk. The tendency to wander and strength in adversity

are traits that the two races share, and in theory, hal ings

desire to get along with everyone should lead them to

befriend half-dragons. In practice, a half-dragon is likely to

 nd hal ings childish pests, and he doesnt appreciate the

trouble that always seems to follow them. Nevertheless, it

sometimes happens that a group of hal ings travels for a

time with a half-dragon camp train. The hal ings provide

services, grease the wheels for introducing half-dragons

to a towns merchants, or, if that is unsuccessful, act as

mediators for trade.

Humans: A given half-dragons attitude toward human-

ity depends on the culture in which he was raised. Those

raised by humans also vary. If accepted, a half-dragon

has a positive view toward humans, but if he was treated

as a subhuman monster, he is resentful. Plenty of human

communities are tolerant of humanoid crossbreeds, but

far fewer are so tolerant of monstrous mixes. Even more

rare are those who accept breeds of dragon and traditional

enemy races, such as orcs. As a result, most half-dragons

do not have a high opinion of humans.

Humans pervasiveness makes it nearly impossible for

the two not to come into contact. An adventuring half-

dragon  almost  certainly  shares  the  company  of  several

humans with whom he has developed the sort of camarade-

rie born of risking their lives together. Deeper friendships

can form between those who are open to the possibility,

but most of the onus is on the human in such cases.

Kobolds: Kobolds revere all things draconic, and they

hold great respect for half-dragons. Still, the nature of

ones nondragon parent makes a difference in how a half-

dragon is received. Nonkobold half-dragons usually regard

kobolds as inconsequential, an attitude derived both from

their haughty dragon heritage and from the usual views

of other humanoids that consider kobolds to be a grubby,

cringing race. A half-dragon kobold is not likely to have

this preconception but still sees itself as superior to the

ordinary kobolds it is related to.

Spellscales: The  ckleness of spellscales is irritating to

half-dragons. Being creatures whose own draconic nature

is more often a burden than a wonder, half-dragons distrust

the spellscales love of life. The one thing the two races

might share is a connection with the dragon deitieshalf-

dragons tend to interpret spellscales daily meditations as

worshipalthough religious half-dragons do not worship

as broadly as spellscales do.

True Dragons: Half-dragons have an ambivalent attitude

toward true dragons. On the one hand, they long for the full

power of that ancient strain, denied them by their crossbreed

nature. They try to emulate dragons in many ways and seek to

unlock draconic abilities in themselves. On the other hand,

a half-dragon is often  ercely resentful of a draconic parent

who abandoned him to his fate, usually never to return.

The aloofness of dragons, especially toward impure breeds,

only reinforces that anger, to the extent that half-dragons

sometimes devote themselves to slaying dragons.

Half-dragons are commonly contemptuous toward less

intelligent creatures of the dragon type, such as pseudo-

dragons and wyverns. They see such creatures as less than

real dragons, perhaps uncomfortably similar to themselves.

Dragonnels (see Draconomicon, page 151) make excellent

steeds for half-dragons, who often feel more comfortable

with these draconic mounts.

DRACONIC CHARACTERS

Usually, draconic characters approach other races in much

the same way their humanoid kin do, having been raised

in the same culture and absorbing the same values and

prejudices. However, the draconic essence within such a

character can lead to stronger links with the other races

of the dragon.

Dragonborn:  Because  this  race  is  made,  not  born,  a

draconic character might actually be related to a dragon-

born, or at least come from the same community as one.

Indeed, the existence of a draconic character within that

society might spur an ordinary humanoid to undergo the

Rite of Rebirth. As a result, the two often form a lasting

relationship, involving long discussions of dragon nature

and questions about the others way of life. In a small group,

a draconic character might feel an inexplicable sense of

kinship even to a complete stranger who is dragonborn.

Dwarves:  Nondwarf  draconic  characters  usually  see

dwarves as killjoys, too hardworking and taciturn to enjoy

life. The artistic inclination that comes with dragon blood

lets them appreciate dwarven craftwork on an aesthetic

level, but their more outgoing and individualistic nature

puts them at odds with the dwarves regimented society.

Elves: Given that draconic characters are more self-

suf cient, artistic, and individualistic than their kin, they

have a lot in common with elves. What they dont share,

unless they have elf blood, is long life and a somewhat dis-

tant approach to others. Draconic characters can become

fascinated by elves, and in such cases they try to spend as

much time around them as possible. If a characters dragon

blood isnt from a variety of dragon that elves see as an

enemy, or if a characters draconic nature isnt obvious,

elves respond kindly if distantly.

Gnomes: Draconic characters share an artistic bent with

gnomes, and the two races get along better than many.

Draconic characters are less likely to have their ordinary

kins impatience with this lively race, though the nature

of a characters dragon heritage can color this.

Half-Dragons: Draconic characters who are aware of

their heritage feel a natural kinship with half-dragons.

They might even envy the great strength and physical abil-

ity of such beings. If the draconic being doesnt know the

source of her difference, she might  nd herself strangely

drawn to a half-dragon. Strong, lifelong relationships can

arise between draconic characters and half-dragons.

Half-Elves: Draconic characters treat half-elves much as

exotic humans, with all that entails. Individuals are judged

on a case-by-case basis, though half-elves are arguably given

more leeway due to their unusual racial heritage.

Half-Orcs: Brutes: Thats typically how a draconic

character without orc blood sees these crossbreeds. She

feels no kinship with their mixed race, and their crudeness

is offensive. Besides, half-orcs think all the wrong jokes

are funny. An unusual half-orc, such as a monk, might

be acceptable to a draconic character, especially if they

are forced to work together in an adventuring party. In

general, though, the two races avoid each other.

Hal  ings: Draconic characters who have chaotic ten-

dencies get along very well with hal ings. The two races

also share an inborn love of fun and pleasure that manifests

in the form of drinking contests, hearty meals, and friendly

competitions. Draconic characters often enjoy gambling,

and in this they  nd kinship with hal ings.

Humans:  As  is  true  of  half-dragons,  the  attitude  of

draconic characters toward humans depends on the sort of

humans they meet. But since their dragon nature isnt gener-

ally as obvious as that of half-dragons, draconic characters

have less trouble in bigoted societies than individuals who

are clearly monstrous. Draconic characters usually get along

with humans and are sometimes inclined to hook up with

troupes of performers. The two races share the inquisitive,

wondering traits that draw them to a life of adventure, and

both work well within a party of glory seekers.

Kobolds: Her dragon heritage might make a draconic

character distantly akin to a kobold, but that doesnt mean

she feels anything in common. Even if she is aware of her

own dragon blood, she doesnt understand the kobolds

belief that they are descended from dragons. To suggest that

the two are related is to insult the draconic character.

Spellscales: A draconic characters nature makes her a

kindred spirit to a spellscale, and the two usually get along

well. Still, the unpredictable nature of a spellscale is a bit

much to endure in a long-term relationship. While a dra-

conic character might enjoy comparing fashions or sharing

a favored song, shes not so interested in examining every

aspect of existence. Thus, most draconic characters have

relationships with spellscales on the level of acquaintances

rather than as true friends.

True Dragons: True dragons are so remote both physi-

cally and mentally that draconic characters dont usually

have a special opinion about them beyond what is typical

for their society. Actually encountering a dragon for the

 rst time can cause a stirring in the breast of a draconic

character, one that she might not understand if she is

unaware of her heritage. Such an awakening can lead to an

obsession with learning more about dragons or traveling

to places where they dwell.

RELIGION

Draconic characters are close enough to their nondragon

kin that they end up sharing the racial or social religious

preferences of that race. On the other hand, half-dragons

rarely feel any reverence for the racial deities of those who

reared them. They are acutely aware of their alienness and

see nothing of bene t in humanoid religions. For the same

reason, not many half-dragons follow the paths of divine

magic. Those who do are most often druids.

The deities of dragons are not generally interesting to

half-dragons. Having grown up without a dragon parent

in most cases, they feel no strong kinship with dragon

divinity. One exception is Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who

created dragonkind. Some half-dragons seek comfort in

the encompassing acceptance of the Concordant Dragon

and count themselves among his children.

This worship is poignant. The half-dragons prayers are

 lled with questions about why they were born to such a

life and pleas for peace. But Io does not directly involve

himself in worldly matters, and half-dragon laments rise

unanswered to the sky.

For some worshipers, the supreme detachment of the

Great Eternal Wheel is an ideal to strive for. These few

become  the  Singers  of  Concordance  (see  the  prestige

class description, page 91), wandering high priests of Io

who minister to their scattered kin, instilling in them the

desire for inner quiet and balance. For more information

on Io, see page 155.

DRAGON-DESCENDED

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE

Half-dragons  and  draconic  characters  have  no  great

nations to call their own. They often share in propagating

the myths of their humanoid cousins, even if they dont

entirely buy into them. The legends of dragonkind are

fascinating to dragon-descended characters, and each

individual has his own way of interpreting those stories.

Many dragon-descended collect draconic lore obsessively,

treating their  nds like precious gems.

The following two tales are examples of draconic legends

with particular meaning to the dragon-descended.

THE BLENDING

In the beginning there was everything, but it was enclosed

in the shell of nothingness. There was no one to warm the

egg and hatch out all the worldsjust the endless black

night, as hard and cold as diamonds.

And then, in a moment, something new awoke. There, on

the boundary between the inside of the shell and the out-

side of the yolk, arose the one we call Io. He saw all things

waiting to be born and knew that only from nothingness

could that happen. So he became the nothingness, grew

within it, and spread until he stretched to the ends of the

night. And the everything within the egg stretched with

him, until he became everything as well. He sent himself

through every part of what would ever be, and when he

was one with it as well as with nothingness, the Blending

was accomplished.

Everything and nothing were blended in Io, and he

began to turn. Slowly at  rst, and then more quickly, he

spun out the sky, the stars, and the worlds. In his spin-

ning,  colors  appeared  along  with  gleaming  streaks  of

metal, and they separated into two rings. Each ring spun

off and became a great wyrm, Tiamat of the Many Colors

and Bahamut the Metallic Lord, and then all the kinds of

dragons. Later, other creatures appeared among the worlds,

but dragons were the  rst and most beloved of Io. Yet, a

small part of everything and nothing remained within Io,

despite all he created.

Io still spins, but ever more slowly now. When he stops,

the  nothingness  will  encase  him  and  form  a  new  egg

holding all the worlds and tomorrows to follow.

THE SPHERES OF CONCORDANCE

Though all things are part of Io, he knew that his children

would follow their own paths once they had spun from him.

Their choices would sometimes clash and lead to con icts.

Io does not take sides in draconic struggles unless they

threaten to disturb the balance of the worlds, but he wishes

peace to all his children. Thus, as his last act of creation, he

spun off droplets of his blended essence as places of refuge

from  strife  and  hatred.  These  droplets  became   oating

heavens  called  Spheres  of  Concordance,  places  where

dragons could ease their hearts and minds.

A Sphere of Concordance is a place of peace and plenty,

where dragons and their kin can relax without fear of strife,

regardless of color or alignment. All is provided for, and

every item of beauty is theremyriad gems and crystals,

ethereal music, shining gold, and warm sunsets.

Nowadays, only those who can discern how to seek the

spheres can know a given spheres location. It was not

always so, however.

In the time after the Blending, it happened that Roknar,

the dwarf deity of avarice and wealth, discovered a sphere.

(See page 19 of Races of Stone for more information on

Roknar.) Ever driven by his own greed, he seized it as his

own and fastened it deep within the earth, using chains he

had stolen from Moradins forge. Roknar and his followers

then slaughtered the dragons who came there for succor

until the cries of his murdered children  nally reached

the ears of Io.

Io saw the chains and smelled the blood, and a mighty

fury welled up in his heart. He fell upon Roknar with

wings that crossed the sky and  ames that burned the

earth and the air. Though he could not fell the dwarf god,

Io drove him as a ball of  re to the outer reaches of the

worlds. He snapped the chains and set the sphere adrift,

and then he began to sing.

Io sang of fury and then of peace, of loss and of resto-

ration, and he mixed the blood of his children with his

own tears and the glorious notes. His great Song spread

through all the worlds and reverberated in every sphere,

attuning the spheres to the souls of dragons so that no

other creatures could sully them. Io said to his high

priest, Noathirthos the Treasure Keeper, Only you and

those you teach can know the way to the spheres. Keep

them safe.

This is how the Singers of Concordance came to be.

Only they can still hear the echoes of Ios Song. Only

they can lead a child of Io to a sphere, and they guard

the peace within.

Io has never since become so furious; as long as the Song

still thrums throughout the worlds, he never will again.

Adventure Hook: The Singers of Concordance are

a small group of wandering priests of Io, mostly half-

dragons, who travel among and minister to dragonkind.

They are also the only ones who can take others to a Sphere

of Concordance, which makes them targets for greedy or

spiteful beings.

A group of mid-level PCs, one or more of whom have

draconic ancestry, stop at a small shrine to Io amid rugged

hills. There they encounter one of these peripatetic clerics,

who entreats the dragon folk and his or her companions

to help rescue a singer who has been taken. Cultists of

Roknar kidnapped the singer several days ago and dragged

the priest into a forti ed temple underground, where he

is imprisoned with a dimensional anchor spell. The cult-

ists are torturing the priest, hoping to extort passage to

a sphere.

LANGUAGE

The Draconic language comes naturally to half-dragons,

who often study the tongue after learning the language

of their humanoid parent. Draconic characters are less

likely to choose this language, unless they are students

of arcane magic, because their dragon heritage has much

less impact on their lives.

HALF-DRAGON CURSES

Half-dragons, especially those who see themselves as ill

born, have a tendency to curse in Draconic. An angry

half-dragon might also spit foul epithets in a mixture of

Draconic and his native tongue.

The  following  phrases  are  examples  of  curses  a  half-

dragon might use. Feel free to come up with original curses

of your own, using the Draconic language (see page 146)

and the tongue of the nondraconic race as inspiration.

Io loex: A despairing cry, uttered only in extreme cir-

cumstances. This wail means literally Io is dead.

Maurg wux gashtik: Politely translated as Go and breed

with a monster! This crude expression draws on Orc

and Draconic and has numerous equivalents in other

languages. The self-loathing many half-dragons experience

lends extra bile to this curse.

Pothoc pig: An all-purpose insult, using the Draconic

for stupid.

Thurgix: Draconic for crippled, a typical half-dragon

equivalent of snafu.

A HALF-DRAGONS HOME

Angriz Ulhargix is a reclusive inventor and wizard who

lives in an abandoned tower that used to form part of the

city walls. His tower is depicted in the map on the follow-

ing page. (For more about Angriz, see the beginning of

this chapter and the description on page 140.) A half-blue

dragon and half-orc, he isnt well received by the public

and thus spends a lot of his time in this retreat. His items

are for sale, but only by appointment; most of the time he

likes to admire his own craftwork.

The old tower had a central wooden stairway connecting

its levels, but the half-dragon has removed it. It was unsafe,

and now only those creatures capable of  ight can move

between levels. A circular opening pierces each  oor of

the tower. Angriz usually uses his gliding  aps to descend

but travels up with boots of levitation.

Ground Level

Angriz uses this part of the tower as a kitchen and dining

area. Cupboards and shelves hold utensils (Angriz is quite

an accomplished cook), and a kettle is usually on the boil

in the  replace. An Angrizs chest (see page 124) keeps meat

fresh,  and  Angrizs  cat  familiar  usually  spends  her  time

curled up by the kitchen  re. In a display area are tables on

which Angriz sets his most recent creations to admire and

even sell on occasion. The towers old entrance has stout

double doors with a heavy oak bar on the inside.

Second Level

This  level  houses  the  laboratory  and  workshop,  as  well

as many more bookshelves and scroll racks. It contains a

workbench, a desk, and cabinets  lled with ingredients and

tools. Angriz sometimes relaxes in a comfortable chair by

the  replace while an experiment is in progress.

Third Level

This room, which serves as living quarters, re ects Angrizs

passionate love of books, lined with shelves and scroll racks

and set with a reading desk. Although the half-dragon

does not need light to see, he enjoys the emotional and

physical warmth of lamps and has several in the room, as

well as a  replace.

A large, chairlike piece of furniture, about the size of a

small sofa, serves as the half-dragons night roost, where

he enters the trance state of dragon sleep. Thick drapes

surround this perch.

Angriz has converted arrow loops in the tower walls.

One is now a hidden emergency exit (Spot DC 22) that is

barred on the inside; the other is a small shrine to Io.

Unlocked chests hold Angrizs personal possessions. A

ceramic urn contains his small hoard, mainly sapphires.

It also houses a nasty electrical trap he designed, which

uses a primitive battery to store his lightning breath and

a string of copper coins to transmit the jolt.

messages are better than face-to-face communication.

CREATING DRAGON-

DESCENDED CHARACTERS

Roleplaying a dragon-descended character convincingly

is a difficult balancing act. Because of the often-tragic

personal history of such creatures, especially half-dragons,

they seem suited to solitary existence. To explain why your

character travels, youll have to spend some time thinking

about his or her unique background.

You can choose between extremes. One option is to

play against type. Your half-dragon might be gregari-

ous and happy, having been born into a loving family,

a tolerant society, or both. Perhaps he still has friendly

contact with his dragon parent, or maybe he follows the

path of the Singers of Concordance and wishes only to

bring peace and joy to his dragon-descended kin. Another

alternative is to dive into the role of the wronged and

lonely  outcast  who  has  found  a  place  to  belong  amid

like-minded wanderers.

Most  dragon-descended  characters  fall  somewhere

between these extremes. Draconic characters often have

normal upbringings and bring nothing more than a typi-

cal adventurers background to the group. Half-dragons

might have worked through some of the isolation that

plagued their early lives or developed a strong attachment

to one or more party members through previous experi-

ence. Chance might simply have thrown the companions

together, and their bonds formed as the result of surviving

a deadly challenge.

An adventuring company usually contains one or more

mis ts, but having an obviously monstrous party member

can lead to adverse social situations that affect the whole

group. Your characters presence might cause others to

assume the party is dangerous or has powerful magic,

which might intimidate those you meet or cause them to

drive your group away.

Dragon-descended  characters  have  a  natural  af nity

for arcane magic, and many become sorcerers or bards to

complement their natural talent. Dont let that expectation

restrict your character concept, however. Half-dragons are

very strong, tough, and intelligent, which makes them well

suited to many career paths.

A half-dragon rogue, for example, can enjoy the bene t

of extra skill points as well as the use of natural weapons

to  deliver  devastating  sneak  attackswith  a  breath

weapon to deter pursuers. Barbarian is also a natural

choice for a half-dragon, with his tremendous Strength

and Constitution, and the class  ts well with an outcast

character concept.

Draconic  characters  arent  naturally  clever,  but  their

superior strength and stamina are advantageous in military

careers. Dragon-descended have no traits that discourage

them  from  following  the  divine  path,  and  their  strong

personalities can make them excellent at undead turning.

A dragon-descended paladin, perhaps in the service of Io,

is a formidable character choice.

LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS

Beyond whatever roleplaying challenges await, the physical

superiority of a dragon-descended creature makes your

character more powerful than ordinary characters of the

same class level.

Draconic characters must accept a +1 level adjustment to

account for their natural armor, their increased Strength

and Charisma, and their claw attacks. This isnt too severe a

drawbackless than that imposed on a drow characterbut

it  does  mean  that  your  character  lags  behind  her  com-

panions in level-dependent aspects. At higher levels, this

disparity is often negligible, but during the early going,

her lower hit points, lower attack bonus, and poorer saves

are signi cant obstacles.

Half-dragons have so many physical advantages over

their nondragon kin that they have a +3 level adjustment.

This means that you cant normally play a half-dragon in

a party of characters below 4th levelor even higher, if

your characters nondragon half also has a level adjust-

ment. And even then, your character starts with only one

class level.

A starting half-dragon is likely to have a hit point total

far below those of most other party members. He wont be

able to make multiple weapon attacks in a round until well

after his comrades. The breath weapon makes up for some of

that disadvantage, but it is a once-per-day ability in a group

whose sorcerer might be casting many offensive spells per

day. Playing a half-dragon entails great care and a lot of

reliance on your companions to survive the early levels.

HALF-DRAGONS BEYOND

THE MONSTER MANUAL

The half-dragon template presents special attacks and

special qualities for half-dragon versions of the ten varieties

of true dragons described in the Monster Manual. The infor-

mation here expands that list to include all true dragons

published in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS products to date. It

supersedes any other previously published information

on this topic (such as from Draconomicon).

SPECIAL ABILITIES

The list below provides the special abilities gained by a

half-dragon based on its draconic parent, as well as the

alignment of the character or the choices of alignment

open to a half-dragon of the indicated kind.

Each entry in the list includes four elements, in this

order:  the  half-dragons  kind:  its  special  attack  form  /

the special quality it gains / its alignment or alignment

choices. The source for each dragons description is given

as  a  superscript  tag  after  its  name:  Dr  (Draconomicon),

ELH (Epic Level Handbook), MM (Monster Manual), MM2

(Monster Manual II), Mon (Monsters of Faern), OA (Oriental

Adventures), or Sa (Sandstorm).

If a special attack entry mentions line or cone, the

half-dragon  has  a  breath  weapon  of  the  indicated  kind

with the normal parameters dictated by the half-dragon

template.

Some dragons lack a breath weapon, an immunity, or

both. Half-dragons descended from certain dragons (most

of which originally appeared in Oriental Adventures) gain

a different kind of special attack and/or special quality.

These special abilities, marked with asterisks in the list,

are explained after the end of the list. The save DC for a

special attack is 10 + 1/2 the half-dragons racial HD + its

Con modi er.

If  a  half-dragon  with  a  special  attack  mentioned  on

the  list  below  would  otherwise  gain  the  ability  to  use

its half-dragon breath weapon more than once per day

(such as from the Extra Exhalation feat; see page 102),

it can instead use its special attack that many times per

day. Special abilities that increase the damage of a half-

dragons breath weapon have no effect on any half-dragons

special attack.

decide to follow this path, you must give up your next two class

levels in exchange for the benefits of the 2nd and 3rd effective

class levels of the draconic racial class. Each time you take one

of  these  levels,  your  level  adjustment  and  ECL  increase  by  1.

Upon taking all three levels, you have the half-dragon template,

and your level adjustment and ECL are 3 higher than normal for

your original race.

For example, a 4th-level human fighter with the draconic

template (ECL 5th) wishes to become a half-dragon. When

he gains enough experience for 6th level, he forgoes gaining

a class level in favor of gaining an effective class level in the

draconic racial class. Once this level is taken, the character

has no choice but to take the final effective class level in the

draconic racial class when he reaches 7th level. At this point,

he is a 4th-level half-dragon and half-human fighter with an

ECL of 7th.

The draconic racial class must be taken at character creation.

It cannot be gained later during a characters career if it is not

initially chosen.

VARIANT:

DRACONIC RACIAL CLASS

Normally,  you  cant  begin  with  a  1st-level  draconic  or  half-

dragon character because of the level adjustments applied by

these templates. With your DMs permission, however, you can

use the draconic racial class presented here to begin play as a

draconic  or  half-dragon  character,  though  you  dont  gain  the

full complement of abilities granted by the template until you

are  more  experienced.  In  essence,  you  are  applying  the  level

adjustment to your character over time, increasing his effective

character level (ECL) gradually rather than all at once.

To use this option, you must declare when creating your char-

acter that you are creating a draconic character. (You dont have

to decide yet whether youll eventually be using the draconic

template or the half-dragon template.) You gain the normal

racial traits for your base race and the normal class features for

a typical 1st-level character of your chosen class. In addition,

you begin play with a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate and Spot

checksthe first sign of your nascent draconic nature.

When  you  reach  2nd  level,  you  do  not  gain  a  normal  class

level. Instead, you gain an effective class level in the draconic

racial class and the benefits it grants. At this point, you have the

draconic template. Your level adjustment increases by 1; you are

now a 1st-level character with an ECL of 2nd.

For example, a draconic human fighter using this option

begins with all the normal racial traits for a human and all

the normal class features for a 1st-level fighter. In addition,

he  has  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Intimidate  and  Spot  checks.

When  the  character  reaches  2nd  level,  he  does  not  gain  a

normal class level; instead, he gains an effective class level

in the draconic racial class. This grants him a +2 bonus to

Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, darkvision out to 60

feet, low-light vision, a +1 natural armor bonus to AC, and a

pair of claw attacks. He now has the draconic template and

an ECL of 3rd.

Anytime you gain another class level after 2nd level, you can

choose  to  continue  to  manifest  additional  draconic  traits  in-

stead of gaining another class level. In effect, you are upgrading

your draconic template to the half-dragon template. Once you

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the draconic racial class.

Skill Bonus (Ex): A character pursuing the draconic racial

class begins play with a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate and Spot

checks.

Ability Score Increases (Ex): At 2nd level, the draconic racial

class grants the following increases to ability scores: Strength

+2, Constitution +2, and Charisma +2. At 3rd level, Strength and

Intelligence each increase by 2. Strength increases by 4 at 4th

level. All ability increases are cumulative.

Claws (Ex): The 2nd level of the draconic racial class grants

two claw attacks. These attacks are used and deal damage ac-

cording to the draconic creature template (see page 74). At 3rd

level, claw damage increases to that granted by the half-dragon

template (MM 146).

Darkvision (Ex): At 2nd level, the draconic racial class grants

darkvision out to 60 feet.

Dragonblood Subtype (Ex): The draconic racial class grants

the dragonblood subtype at 1st level.

Low-Light  Vision  (Ex):  The  2nd  level  of  the  draconic  racial

class grants low-light vision.

Natural  Armor  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  the  draconic  racial  class

grants a +1 natural armor bonus to AC (existing natural armor

improves by 1). The 3rd level of the class grants another +1. At

4th level, the natural armor bonus increases by an additional +2,

for a total improvement of +4 over three levels.

Racial Bonus on Saves Against Sleep and Paralysis (Ex): The

2nd level of the draconic racial class grants a +4 racial bonus on

saving throws against magic sleep effects and paralysis.

Bite (Ex): At 3rd level, the draconic racial class grants a bite

attack that deals damage according to the half-dragon template.

Breath Weapon (Su): The 3rd level of the draconic racial class

grants a weak breath weapon. The form of this breath weapon

depends on the characters dragon parentage. See the half-

dragon template for details. This breath weapon deals half the

normal damage of a half-dragons breath weapon. If the dragon

type doesnt grant a breath weapon (see Half-Dragons Beyond

the Monster Manual, below), the draconic racial class doesnt

grant one either.

If the dragon type granted a weak breath weapon at 3rd level

and the 4th level is taken, the weak breath weapon becomes a

normal half-dragon breath weapon. It deals the damage granted

by the half-dragon template.

If the dragon type didnt grant a weak breath weapon at 3rd

level  and  the  4th  level  is  taken,  the  racial  class  grants  a  spe-

cial  attack  according  to  the  dragon  parent.  See  Half-Dragons

Beyond the Monster Manual for details.

Racial  skill  points  per  Hit  Die  change  to  6  +  Int  (or  four

times this number for the first racial Hit Die). If this number

is higher than the normal quantity of skill points for the re-

cipient creatures racial Hit Dice, it gains skill points equal

to  the  difference  between  its  new  skill  point  total  and  its

old skill point total. If this number is lower than the normal

quantity of skill points for the recipient creatures racial Hit

Dice, it loses skill points equal to the difference between its

new skill point total and its old skill point total. Racial class

skills do not change.

Wings (Ex): Large or larger creatures that take the 4th dra-

conic racial class level grow a pair of functional wings, or their

existing vestigial wings become functional. Such creatures gain

a fly speed equal to twice their base land speed (maximum 120

feet) with average maneuverability.

Ability Descriptions

Ability  Drain  (Su):  Three  times  per  day,  a  half-fang

dragon can choose to deal 1d4 points of Constitution drain

with its bite attack (Fortitude negates). The decision to use

this ability must be made before the attack roll is made.

Burrow: A half-li lung dragon has a burrow speed of

10 feet.

Cause Rain (Su): A half-chiang lung dragon can breathe

storm clouds three times per day, causing rain. The rain

lasts for 2d4 hours and extends in a 2-mile radius centered

on the half-dragon.

Cone of Energy Drain (Su): A half-shadow dragons

breath weapon is a cone that bestows one negative level

(Re ex negates).

Gust of Wind (Su): A half-tun mi lung dragons breath

weapon is equivalent to a gust of wind spell with an instan-

taneous duration.

Searing Light (Su): A half-prismatic

dragons  breath  weapon  is  the

equivalent of a searing light spell

(caster  level  8th)  with  a

range of 60 feet.

Roar (Ex): A half-

li  lung  dragon  can

roar  three  times

per day, creating

a  sound  resem-

bling metal

scraping against stone. All creatures within 60 feet of the

creature are automatically deafened for 1 round (no sav-

ing throw).

Water  Fire  (Su):  Three  times  per  day,  a  half-pan

lung dragon or half-shen lung dragon that is touching

or submerged in water can surround itself in an aura

of ghostly, multicolored flames. These flames deal an

extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature that suc-

cessfully strikes the protected half-dragon with a melee

attack. (Such successful attacks still deal normal damage

to the half-dragon normal damage.) Lung dragons and

half-lung  dragons  are  immune  to  this  special  attack.

Water fire lasts for 1 minute or until it is exposed to

normal or magical fire. If the effect is negated by normal

or magical fire, the half-dragon cant activate the ability

again for 2d6 minutes.

NONHUMANOID

DRAGON-DESCENDED

Although this chapter presents characters from the per-

spective of humanoid races with a draconic heritage, plenty

of  monsters  also  make  interesting  dragon-descended

choices.

NONHUMANOID HALF-DRAGONS

Since the half-dragon template can apply to any living crea-

ture type other than dragons, a nearly limitless variety of

possible half-dragons exist. Although such creatures are

usually not suitable as player char-

acters, some might make for

interesting cohorts. A

half-deep dragon

mount for a drow blackguard, and a half-bronze dragon

tiger is a mighty companion for a druid or ranger.

Many  intelligent  nonhumanoids  suitable  as  player

characters might also make viable choices as half-dragons.

A half-bronze dragon centaur, for example, could be unusu-

ally attracted to the seacoast, perhaps as a marine druid. A

half-white dragon frost giant might be a ferocious berserker

who preys on other frost giants.

In general, its best to choose a nonhumanoid race

that has a low level adjustment, since the level adjust-

ment granted by the half-dragon template can quickly

put  a  character  out  of  reach  for  a  typical  campaign.

However, if epic adventure is more to your taste, you

can  experiment  even  further.  Imagine  a  warband  of

half-planar dragon archons, seeking out and destroying

fiends;  a  party  of  half-lung  dragon  djinn  competing

against half-red dragon efreet; or even a cult of half-

green dragon yuan-ti, founding a new temple deep in

the jungle.

NONHUMANOID

DRACONIC CREATURES

Draconic animals and magical beasts serve well as mounts,

guardians, and cohorts of dragon-descended characters,

since they respond better to the draconic blood of their

masters and leaders (especially if they share the same

draconic heritage). Draconic familiars are popular choices

for dragon-descended spellcasters, boosting the familiars

strengths with those born of dragon blood.

Since the level adjustment for a draconic creature is only

+1 (compared to +3 for a half-dragon), the template can be

applied to a wider range of nonhumanoid PC races without

pushing the characters level beyond a reasonable starting

point. Draconic fey, for example, could be the heart of a

campaign  lled with ancient mystery and deep magic.

The  planetouched,  already  apart  from  other  mortals,

become even stranger with the draconic templatethey

might  be  involved  in  the  intrigues  within  the  planar

metropolis of Sigil.

DRAGON-DESCENDED

CHARACTERS

Although  the  dragon-descended  are  naturally  inclined

toward arcane magic, their superior physical and mental

abilities make them  t for most classes.

Barbarian: Among savage peoples, one who is born

to draconic heritage is naturally suited to be a berserker.

Such characters might become war leaders, but many are

solitary ragers who challenge everyone they meet. Superior

Strength and Constitution combine well with barbarian

rage, while better Charisma makes such a warrior even

more intimidating.

Bard: Improved Charisma and a disposition toward

arcane magic make the bard class a natural choice for

those of dragon descent. Such characters spend much

of their time collecting bits of dragon lore and seeking

out dragonssome even end up as Singers of Concor-

dance. Their diplomatic skill makes dragon-descended

bards a fine choice for ambassadors between dragons

and other creatures.

Cleric: Other than in the worship of Io, divine magic

finds  little  following  among  the  dragon-descended.

However, dragon-descended do not incur any penalties to

Wisdom, and in fact, a superior Charisma score means they

can in uence undead more effectively. Playing a cleric of

draconic heritage is against type and opens up interesting

roleplaying possibilities, especially if you follow an unusual

deity such as Olidammara or Corellon Larethian.

Chapter 6: Character Options includes racial substitution

levels for any dragonblood cleric, including half-dragon

and draconic ones.

Druid: Dragon-descended druids are uncommon, but

since  many  dragons  have  an  elemental  affinity,  their

progeny possess a latent connection with the environ-

ment  (especially  half-dragons  born  to  gem  dragons

or to dragons from the Inner Planes). Such a druid is

usually solitary, following the militant path of barring

outsiders  from  pristine  natural  places  and  fiercely

avenging crimes against nature. Some few promote the

interconnectedness of all things and seek acceptance

among other peoples.

Fighter: With high Strength, Constitution, and Cha-

risma,  dragon-descended  make  excellent   ghters.  They

also enjoy natural armor and an innate resistance to effects,

such as hold person and sleep, that often fell members of

the  ghting classes. Half-dragons might not always have

access to formal military training, if they are born into

xenophobic  societies;  such  characters  leave  home  at  an

early age to seek private instruction and usually become

adventurers,  mercenaries,  or  both.  Draconic  beings  are

often  able  to  blend  with  their  society  and  join  citizen

militias or even knightly orders.

Monk: The lawful alignment requirement of the monk

class usually makes it inaccessible to those descended

from chaotic dragons, unless they can overcome the call

of their blood. Dragon-descended do not have advantages

in Wisdom or Dexterity, two abilities important to monks,

but their great might,  ne health, and innate armor let

them survive longer in hand-to-hand combat.

Paladin: The very strict alignment requirement of this

class puts it out of the reach of half-dragons who are not

born of lawful good dragons, unless they can overcome

their innate tendencies. In particular, half-radiant dragons

(see Draconomicon, page 185) are devoted champions of

justice. They often serve Bahamut, but some are followers

of Io.

Ranger: Dragon-descended beings who do not  t into

their humanoid society might end up as solitary hunters

and wanderers. Their stamina aids in survival, and keen

draconic senses give them advantages in tracking and

avoiding natural hazards. Such rangers are more likely to

pursue a favored enemy out of anger than expertise, and

they often enter prestige classes that specialize in hunting

down and destroying hated foes.

Rogue: Dragon-descended have superior Charisma,

which makes them good at intimidation. They make  ne

thugs, interrogators, and crime bosses. Those who are

interested more in scouting and gathering information

bene t from their draconic senses and more hit points.

Characters who inherit a calculating or sneaky parents

traits can often turn these to good use as rogues.

Sorcerer: This class is a natural career choice because

dragon-descended sorcerers bene t from high Charisma

as well as simply being more sturdy than their humanoid

counterparts. They are likely to take feats or prestige

classes that enhance their innate abilities and allow them

to awaken more of the dragon within.

Chapter 6: Character Options includes racial substitution

levels for any dragonblood sorcerer, including half-dragon

and draconic ones.

Wizard: Dragon-descended wizards are not as common

as  dragon-descended  sorcerers,  but  they  can  still  be

strong in the arcane arts. Half-dragons enjoy enhanced

Intelligence, and draconic creatures take no penalty to

that ability score. What holds many back is lack of access

to  arcane  schooling,  but  in  some  cultures  (especially

among elves), dragon-descended youngsters are pushed

toward wizardry.

DRACONIC CREATURE

TEMPLATE

A draconic creature is descended from a dragon ancestor,

though that ancestor could be many generations removed.

Draconic creatures often bear hints of their heritage, such

as subtle coloration, slitted pupils, or scaly skin. Those

with strong draconic features are sometimes mistaken

for half-dragons.

It isnt necessary to determine the source of a draconic

creatures heritage, since the creature doesnt gain any

abilities directly related to its dragon ancestor.

Attack: A draconic creature retains all the attacks of

the base creature and gains two claw attacks if it doesnt

already have them. If the base creature can use weapons,

the  draconic  creature  retains  this  ability.  If  the  base

creature has natural weapons, it retains those weapons. A

draconic creature  ghting without weapons uses either its

claw attacks or its primary natural weapon (if it has one).

A draconic creature armed with a weapon uses its claw

attacks or a weapon, as it desires.

Full Attack: A draconic creature fighting without

weapons uses either its claw attacks or its natural weapons.

If armed with a weapon, it uses the weapon as its primary

attack and claws or some other natural weapon as a second-

ary attack.

Damage: Draconic creatures have two claw attacks.

If the base creature does not have this attack form, use

the appropriate damage value from the following table,

according  to  the  draconic  creatures  size.  Creatures

that have claw attacks retain their old damage values,

or use the appropriate value from the table, whichever

is higher.

CREATING A DRACONIC CREATURE

Draconic is an inherited template that can be added to

any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as

the base creature) except a dragon. (The dragon devotee

prestige class in Chapter 5 also allows a character to gain

this template.)

A draconic creature uses all the base creatures statistics

and special abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: Animals with this template become

magical beasts, but otherwise the base creatures type is

unchanged. All creatures gain the dragonblood subtype.

Size is unchanged.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by 1.

Special Qualities: A draconic creature retains all the

special qualities of the base creature, and it gains dark-

vision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Saves:  Draconic  creatures  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

saves against magic sleep effects and paralysis.

Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows:

Str +2, Con +2, Cha +2.

Skills:  Draconic  creatures  have  a  +2  racial  bonus  on

Intimidate checks and Spot checks.

Organization: Solitary or as base creature.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +1.

Level Adjustment: Same as base creature +1.

DISCIPLE OF THE EYE

Leaving an opponent stunned or unconscious only creates a pest

that may rise to challenge you again. However, killing your foe

is secondary to planting the fear of the dragon within himthe

longer he lives, the more he will tell others of your dreadful,

terrifying gaze.

The way a disciple of the eye  xes her gaze on someone

can be remarkably unsettling. A leashed draconic fury

is smoldering inside herthe promise of a retribution

so great that its mere intimation is enough to make

observers fear for their lives.

As a disciple of the eye, you know the messages

that the eyes alone can impart. Indeed, eyes can both

send and receive information. You are able to collect

heightened  knowledge  about  your  environment.

More  important,  your  merest  glance  guarantees

your foes that by the time you move to become a

blur of dragon-inspired bloodshed, it is already too

late for them.

BECOMING A DISCIPLE

OF THE EYE

Monks  are  natural  candidates  for  disciples  of

the  eye,  since  the  prerequisite  skills  are  class

skills for them and they have the prerequisite

feat  automaticallynot  to  mention  the  fact

that, once they enter the class, disciple levels

improve  their  fast  movement  and  flurry  of

blows abilities.

Sorcerers could also take up the class; they

have  high  Dexterity  and  Charisma  scores,  both

of  which  are  integral  to  disciple  of  the  eye  class

abilities, even though they lack Spot as a class skill.

Rogues  with  high  Charisma  scores  also  make  75

good candidates, but lack Concentration as a class skill.

A rogue/sorcerer multiclass character could certainly

work, keeping in mind that you also want a good Strength

score for melee combat.

CLASS FEATURES

As  they  advance  in  level,  disciples  of  the  eye  gain

increased unarmed abilities. They learn how to increase

their perception of the world as well as strike fear into

their opponents.

Fast Movement (Ex): Your disciple of the eye levels

stack with your monk levels (if any) for the purpose of

determining your unarmored speed bonus. (See the monk

class feature, pages 4041 of the Players Handbook.) If you

dont have any monk levels, you are treated as a monk of the

same class level as your disciple class level for determining

your unarmored speed bonus.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Your disciple of the eye levels

stack with your monk levels (if any) for the purpose of

determining the attack bonuses you use when making a

 urry of blows. (See the monk class feature, page 40 of

the Players Handbook.) If you dont have any monk levels,

you are treated as a monk of the same class level as your

disciple class level for determining your  urry of blows

attack bonuses.

Wandering Eyes (Sp): As a disciple of the eye, you

gain the ability to remotely perceive your surroundings.

As  a  standard  action,  you  can  create  a  magical  sensor

that provides visual information as the arcane eye spell

(PH 173), for up to 1 minute per day per disciple level

(which can be expended gradually, minimum 1 round).

The effect of this ability is identical to that of the arcane

eye spell, except that the magical sensor is shaped like a

dragon of Fine size. The moment you stop concentrating

on the invisible sensor, it winks out of existence and must

be created again.

Natural Armor Bonus (Ex): By the time you reach

2nd level, your martial training has begun to harden

you against physical attacks, providing you with a +1

bonus to your natural armor. This bonus increases to

+2 at 4th level.

Frightful Attack (Ex): At 2nd level, you can unsettle

your foes by evoking the presence of the dragon within

you. This ability takes effect automatically whenever you

make an attack roll against an opponent that has fewer

Hit  Dice  than  your  character  level.  The  target  of  your

attack must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2

your character level + your Cha modi er) or be shaken

for 1d4 rounds.

Dragons and creatures with the dragonblood subtype

are immune to this effect. Creatures that succeed on this

save cant be affected again by your frightful attack for

24 hours.

Keen Senses (Ex): When you attain 3rd level, your

senses dramatically improve. You can see four times as

well as a human can in shadowy illumination, and twice as

well as a human can see in normal light. If you can already

OTHER PRESTIGE CLASSES

In addition to the new prestige classes presented here, dont

overlook these prestige classes from other supplements.

Archmage  (Dungeon  Masters  Guide):  Among  most  races,

archmages  tend  to  be  wizards  rather  than  sorcerers  because

of the diversity of spell knowledge required to enter the class.

The spellscales experimental approach to magic and eclectic

tastes mean that by the time they can cast 7th-level spells, many

qualify to take this class.

Blood Magus (Complete Arcane): Spellscales especially find it

interesting to use their dragon blood to manipulate magic.

Dragon Disciple (Dungeon Masters Guide): This prestige class

focuses on the physical prowess of a dragon. It is particularly

suited to characters interested in acquiring draconic aspects,

because  its  capstone  ability  transforms  the  character  into  a

half-dragon.

Dragonstalker (Draconomicon): Dragonborn  are  particularly

well suited to taking this prestige class, which emphasizes hunt-

ing and slaying dragons.

Outcast  Champion  (Races  of  Destiny):  Dragon-descended

characters that are of human origin before the addition of the

template can become outcast champions. The class is perfect

for an alienated half-dragon human.

Mystic  Theurge (Dungeon  Masters  Guide):  Spellscales  who

want  to  have  substantial  divine  spellcasting  power  are  usu-

ally loath to give up their arcane sorcerer abilities. The mystic

theurge class lets a spellscale have the best of both worlds.

Tempest  (Complete  Adventurer):  Dragonborn  sometimes

become tempests. The classs focus on martial skill appeals to

them. A tempest dragonborn is awesome to watch when it is

battling the spawn of Tiamat.

Virtuoso  (Complete  Adventurer):  Spellscales  who  are  inter-

ested in honing their performance skills without forsaking their

mastery of sorcery find this prestige class attractive.

You also gain darkvision out to 120 feet. If you already

have darkvision but not out to 120 feet, your current dark-

vision extends to that distance. If your current darkvision

already extends to 120 feet or more, your darkvision does

not improve.

Glare  of  the  Enraged  Dragon  (Su):  At  4th  level,

you can use a swift action (see page 122) and focus your

dragon heritage into an enraged glare that you direct

against any creature within 30 feet. The target of your

glare must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2

your character level + your Cha modifier) or be shaken

for  1d4  rounds.  This  abili-

ty can be used a number

of  times  per  day  equal

to  your  disciple  level.

Affected  foes  that  are

already shaken become

frightened instead.

Blindsense (Ex): At 5th

level,  your  senses  dramatically

expand. You gain blindsense out to 30

feet. If you already have blindsense out to

30 feet or more, the range of the ability does

not improve.

PLAYING A DISCIPLE

OF THE EYE

As a disciple of the eye, you are capable

of ending a  ght by either frighten-

ing  your  foes  away,  assaulting

them  with  your  martial  skill,

or both. You are not the kind of

melee  fighter  who  rushes  into

combat, preferring to gather infor-

mation about your enemy remotely before

planning the best method of engagement.

If  a  quarrel  cannot  be  defused,  you  are

prepared  to   ght  at  a  moments  notice,  often

warning  your  combatant  that  one  of  you  will

probably die. This is not typically a threat, but an

honest  profession  of  consequence.  When  you

face mindless creatures that operate on instinct,

nothing can be gained by such a frank admoni-

tion,  so  against  such  opponents  you  attack

without reservation.

Molik, a disciple

of the eye

your victims might not run, shaken foes are far less likely to

take you down. They are also more likely to make mistakes,

creating valuable openings for you and your comrades to

exploit.

As you proceed in the class, you eventually gain the

ability to use the glare of the enraged dragon. This is

an  ideal  ability  to  use  on  already  shaken  foes,  for  if

you successfully stare down such a creature with this

ability, it becomes frightened and flees the battle. You

should use this ability on lesser creatures in a combat

against  multiple  foes,  giving  you  the  advantage  of

focusing your martial prowess on your most signifi-

cant opponent.

Advancement

Disciples of the eye have undergone training

as martial artists. At the same time, they un-

derstand that the threat of great violence

(speci cally,  dragon-inspired  violence)

can be as effective a deterrent as the vio-

lence itself. Sometimes this realization

heralds a spiritual journey that can in-

tersect with the path of those who seek to

emulate dragons.

As you advance in the disciple of the

eye class, consider devoting resources to

increasing or enhancing your Cha-

risma  score.  This  score  is  an

important factor in your abil-

ity to shake or frighten your

foes, and keeping it as high

as possible should be one of

your primary goals.

Resources

For  the  most  part,  a  disci-

ple of the eye has no special

resources.  You  are  usually

on  your  own  when  it  comes

to organized support. As a lawful

character,  you  crave  a  structured  com-

munity, and therefore you might associate

with Singers of Concordance (see page 91)

in particular.

DISCIPLES IN THE WORLD

Once  a  disciple  of  the  eye  becomes  involved  in  a

conflict, the only safe resolutions are to commit to

peace or walk away.

Arytemaurg, dragonwrought kobold

Combat

You prefer to begin combat only after you have collected

information  on  foes  using  your  wandering  eyes  ability.

Your ability to send a dragonlike sensor to scout for you is

useful in a wide variety of situations, though the dragon-

sensors  presence  is  certainly  something  potential  foes

might wonder about, and perhaps be thus forewarned of

your imminent arrival.

Once combat is joined, your ferocious martial techniques

combined with the frightful nature of your attacks can

cause less powerful foes to quail in your presence. While

Player characters who become involved with dragonblood

humanoids might  nd themselves crossing paths with

a disciple of the eye without realizing it at  rst, given a

disciples tendency to dress in the same clothes worn by

commoners and to avoid notice as much as possible. A

lawful good disciple often chooses to guard a defenseless

group of individuals, while a lawful evil disciple seeks to

dominate small communities through regular doses of fear.

A lawful neutral disciple might be skilled at negotiating a

peace between opposing sides of a war.

Organization

Disciples of the eye do not form lasting communities,

each feeling most effective as an individual within an

existing organization. Even so, at times several disciples

have combined their strength in times of great martial

need. These compacts are formed either when everyone

involved  attempted  to  mediate  a  situation  and  failed,

or when mediation was impossible due to the mindless

nature of the threat.

In such cases, it is not unusual for a group of disciples

to operate together, either as a team of in ltrators that

in icts damage behind enemy lines, or as a driving force

to break through on the battle eld. These sorts of attacks

are  highly  successful;  the  disciples  can  remotely  scout

ahead with their wandering eyes ability and then focus their

energy where the most damage can be done.

NPC Reactions

Those unfamiliar with a particular disciple of the eye have

an indifferent attitude toward her. Because disciples are

usually not part of a particular organization, very few NPCs

would be able to stereotype newly encountered disciples

as foes or friends.

If a disciple of the eye has made a name for herself

in a particular location, then of course the attitudes of

NPCs in that area shiftbecoming more friendly if the

disciple is seen to be on the side of right, but becoming

more unfriendly if the disciples draconic ability to shake

and frighten foes is widely witnessed or talked about. The

average NPC is afraid of dragons and of those who display

dragonish abilities.

DISCIPLE OF THE EYE LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (local) or Knowledge

(history) can research disciples of the eye to learn more

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read

or paraphrase the following, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: Disciples of the eye are skilled martial artists

who seek to emulate dragons.

DC 15: Disciples of the eye can send little invisible dragon-

like creatures wandering to scout distant locations.

DC 20: Disciples of the eye demonstrate a fury during

their initial attack that is reminiscent of a dragons aspect,

frightening the weak-willed.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success

can learn important details about speci c disciples of the

eye, including notable accomplishments and geographi-

cal origins.

Player  characters  trying  to  locate  a  disciple  of  the

eye should make a DC 20 Gather Information check to

discover the necessary intermediaries and protocols for

contacting one. If the player characters are talking to a

Singer of Concordance and request a mediator, give them

a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

DISCIPLES IN THE GAME

This prestige class is interesting to players on multiple

levels.  As  negotiators  sent  to  intimidate  and  frighten,

disciples of the eye offer roleplaying opportunities. With

their wandering eyes ability, disciples of the eye are ideal

for  reconnaissance  or  spying.  As  martial  artists,  they

can throw themselves into melee combat with abandon.

Opportunities for each style of gaming should be offered

for  a  full  play  experience,  depending  on  individual

preferences.

Adaptation

Disciples of the eye are intended for dragonblood human-

oids. If none are present in your campaign, this prestige

class can be played with a regular humanoidjust remove

the dragonblood subtype requirement. Some other ele-

ment must be used, however, to serve as the seed of the

characters  ability  to  frighten  othersrequire  instead

2 ranks in Knowledge (arcana), concentrating on some

particularly scary magical beast that the disciple emu-

lates. In addition, the shape of the wandering eyes sensor

should change from the form of a dragon to that of the

new creature being emulated.

Sample Encounter

The player characters have heard of an isolated village that

has cut off all contact with the outside world. On a quest

to investigate, they meet a kobold traveler on the road who

asks to travel with them for safety. If questioned about

the village, she indicates that the villagers have found

order and have chosen to turn away from the chaos of the

outside world.

EL  13:  Once  the  characters  arrive  at  the  village,  it

becomes clear that the townsfolk fear and obey Molik.

When it becomes obvious that the traveler is the one

behind the villages sudden isolation, the characters must

decide how to deal with Molik, who will not release the

townsfolk without a  ght.

DRACOLEXI

Before there was a written script, the Draconic language was

spoken by true dragons for thousands of years. The nuances of

every word are still  lled with arcane meaning, but only if you

know how to pronounce and unlock that power.

Renthisjarcaniss, black dragon

A dracolexi lives in a world forgotten by most creatures

alive today, back when the first Draconic words rever-

berated  with  preternatural  meaning.  As  a  dracolexi,

you  try  to  understand  that  primordial  vocabulary  by

devoting yourself to the study of ancient dialects and

languages,  hoping  to  discover  exactly  how  certain

Draconic words were once uttered. These words hold

little power until a dracolexi understands the meaning

behind them.

When  a  dracolexi  can   nally  pronounce  the  word

with the original emotional and intellectual subtext in

mind, he can invoke instantaneous arcane power. With

practice and more than a little experimentation, you can

master these Draconic words, but you must be prepared

to live a life both adventurous and studious by turns in

order to locate and decipher the histories that embody

these secrets.

BECOMING A DRACOLEXI

A member of any class capable of spontaneous arcane

spellcasting and having Knowledge (arcana) as a class

skill  can  qualify  for  this  prestige  class  without  too

much  effort.  Bards  have  an  easier  time  qualifying

than  most  other  characters,  because  of  the  skill  and

language requirements. A key attribute for a dracolexi

is Charisma for spellcasting, but a high Intelligence is

equally important when researching Draconic words,

not to mention Decipher Script, Knowledge, and Search

checks. Dracolexi do a fair amount of adventuring, so

a good Dexterity helps get them out of tight spots and

a high Constitution helps them survive anything they

cant escape.

Entry Requirements

Feats: Eschew Materials or Still Spell.

Skills:  Knowledge  (arcana)  8  ranks,  Perform  (oratory)  4

ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks.

Spells:  Must  be  able  to  spontaneously  cast  2nd-level

arcane  spells,  must  know  at  least  one  language-

dependent spell.

Languages:  Must  be  able  to  speak  Draconic  plus  at  least

two languages from the following list: Auran, Dwarven,

Elven, Ignan.

CLASS FEATURES

As they advance in the class, dracolexi acquire knowledge

of  increasingly  powerful  Draconic  words,  while  also

mastering the original dialects of the dragons and thus

gaining the ability to affect spell energy.

Spellcasting:  At  each  level  beyond  1st,  you  gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and

spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained

a  level  in  an  arcane  spellcasting  class  to  which  you

belonged  before  adding  the  prestige  class  level.  You

do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of

that class would have gained. If you had more than one

arcane spellcasting class before becoming a dracolexi,

you must decide which class to add each level to for the

purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and

spells known.

Draconic Words (Su): When you enter this class, you

begin to discover the arcane nuances that allow speci c

spoken Draconic words to produce powerful effects. Your

intuitive  understanding  of  how  to  express  these  words

cannot be imparted to others. Even if one of these words

is repeated perfectly by someone else, the utterance has

no  effect,  because  the  speaker  lacks  the  internalized

understanding that can only come from the special studies

that dracolexi engage in.

At 1st level and every three levels thereafter (4th, 7th,

and 10th), you can learn one Draconic word from among

those described below in order to use it and gain the

bene t of its effect. Some Draconic words have a class

level requirement that must be met before the word can

be learned. You cant learn the same word twice.

Speaking a word is a swift action (see page 122) that

activates the words effect; if the word affects a particular

creature, you can target any creature (including yourself)

within 30 feet. A silence spell or similar effect prevents

you from using Draconic words; if you are deafened,

you have a 20% chance of misspeaking a Draconic word

when using it (this counts as a use of the word but has

no effect).

Beginning at 4th level, you can choose to incorporate

a known Draconic word into the verbal component of

a spontaneously cast arcane spell as you cast it (which

requires no action other than the normal casting of the

spell). In this case, the word takes effect at the end of the

spells casting time, just before the spell takes effect. If the

Draconic word would normally target a speci c creature,

it can only target a creature that is targeted by the spell, or

a single creature within the area of the spell. A spell cast

without a verbal component cant have a Draconic word

added to its effect.

You can use each Draconic word any number of times

per day, but no more than one word can be used each

round (nor can you use the same word more than once per

round). No creature can be targeted by the same Draconic

word twice in a 24-hour period.

If a saving throw is allowed against the power of the

Draconic word, the save DC is 10 + your dracolexi level +

your Cha modi er.

Renthisj: The targets speech can be understood by any

creature that can speak a language. A target incapable of

speech gains no bene t from this Draconic word (which

means speak). The effect lasts for a number of hours equal

to your class level. Will negates (harmless).

Ssi sv: This Draconic word translates into Common as

rest. It removes the fatigued condition from the target,

or reduces the targets exhausted condition to fatigued. If

you are at least 7th level, it instead removes both fatigued

and exhausted conditions.

Vor: This Draconic word, which translates as learn,

grants  the  target  a  competence  bonus  on  Knowledge

checks and Spellcraft checks equal to your class level for

1 hour.

Ocuir: This Draconic word, meaning see, grants the

target  a  competence  bonus  on  Search  checks  and  Spot

checks equal to your class level for 1 hour.

Osvith: This Draconic word, translating to flee in

Common, renders its target shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the

target has Hit Dice equal to or less than your dracolexi

level, it is frightened instead. Will negates.

Ssearth: The target of this Draconic word (prolong)

is healed of 1 point of damage per caster level. If you

speak this word as part of a spell, you can choose instead

to extend the spell (as if you had applied the Extend

Spell feat), but without any adjustment in spell slot or

casting time.

Veschik: This Draconic word means replenish. The

target regains one spell slot (but not a slot that held a pre-

pared spell) of the highest level of arcane spell it can cast

spontaneously. If the target has not already cast any spells

of that level, it instead regains one spell slot of the highest

arcane spell level for which it has already spontaneously

cast a spell.

Strix: The target of this Draconic word (invigorate)

gains temporary hit points equal to twice your class level.

These hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour.

Ossalur: This Draconic word, meaning travel, grants its

target a 30-foot enhancement bonus to all its speeds for

a number of rounds equal to your class level. This effect

doesnt give the target a mode of movement it doesnt have

(a creature with no  y speed isnt treated as a creature with

a  y speed of 0 feet).

Valignat: This Draconic word, meaning burn, deals

5d6 points of fire damage to the target. If you speak the

word as part of a spell with the fire descriptor, you can

choose instead either to empower or widen the spell (as

if you had applied the Empower Spell feat or the Widen

Spell feat), but without any adjustment in spell slot or

casting time.

Bonus Feat: A dracolexi learns how to rely on little but

her own voice to cast spells. At 2nd level, you gain your

choice of Eschew Materials or Still Spell as a bonus feat.

If you already have these feats, you gain nothing from this

class feature.

Power  Word  Spells  (Su):  The  words  of  Draconic

power share some fundamental similarities to the various

power word spells (those in the Players Handbook as well

as the ten new power word spells presented in Chapter 7

of this book), and your studies shed new light on the use

of these magical effects. At 3rd level, you can select any

single power word spell and add it to the spell list of any

one spontaneous arcane spellcasting class that you have,

treating it as a spell of one level lower than normal. If

your class spell list doesnt normally include spells of

the (adjusted) level of the power word spell, you cant

add it to your spell list.

For  example,  a  5th-level  bard/3rd-level  dracolexi

could  select  power  word  distract  (see  page  115).  It  is

normally a 4th-level spell, but he can treat it as a 3rd-

level  bard  spell.  He  could  even  choose  power  word

blind (normally a 7th-level spell) and add it to his class

spell list as a 6th-level bard spell, despite the fact that

he is not yet capable of casting 6th-level bard spells.

He couldnt choose power word kill or power word stun

with this ability, since even with the adjustment these

would be 8th-level and 7th-level spells, respectively,

which arent normally available to bards.

Furthermore,  if you  are  (or  become)  capable  of

casting spells of that level, you can also add the power

word spell to your list of spells known. If you already

know the selected power word spell, you can move that

spell to one level lower on your class spell list and also

add any spell of the power word spells original level to

your spell list.

The bard in the previous example couldnt add power

word  disable  (normally  a  5th-level  spell)  to  his  list  of

spells known until he was capable of casting 4th-level

bard  spells.  A  9th-level  sorcerer/3rd-level  dracolexi,

on the other hand, could immediately add power word

disable to his list of spells known, since he is capable

of  casting  4th-level  spells.  If  he  already  knew  power

word disable as a 5th-level spell, he would add it to his

list  of  4th-level  spells  known  and  then  add  a  differ-

ent 5th-level sorcerer spell of his choice to his spells

known list.

At 6th level and again at 9th level, you can select another

power word spell in this fashion.

Bonus  Spells  Known:  A  dracolexi  is  particularly

talented in using spells that incorporate language and

speech.  At  5th  level,  you  can  add  any  two  language-

dependent spells from your classs spell list to your list of

spells known for that class. The spells must be of a level

you are capable of casting, and the two spells must be of

different levels. For example, a 5th-level sorcerer/5th-level

dracolexi could add lesser geas (a 4th-level sorcerer spell)

and suggestion (a 3rd-level sorcerer spell) to his list of spells

known. He couldnt learn command (since its a cleric spell)

or mass suggestion (since its a 6th-level spell and beyond

his ability to cast).

Voice in Silence (Ex): When coupled with arcane

energy, your voice becomes potent enough to temporar-

ily overcome areas of silence or even your own deafness.

Beginning at 8th level, you can expend an arcane spell

slot  as  a  move  action  to  suppress  all  silence  spells  (or

similar effects) in your space, and to render your voice

audible to you and other creatures sharing your space

even if you or they are deafened. This effect lasts for

a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot

expended. Only you (and any other creatures sharing

your space) benefit from this effect; adjacent creatures

that  are  deafened  or  within  a  silence  effect  are  still

Litrix, a dracolexi

affected  by  the  deafness  or  silence.  The  effect  moves

with you.

PLAYING A DRACOLEXI

You are that rare breed of academic who takes a decid-

edly adventurous approach to studying. As a dracolexi,

you are not well armed and might also not be overtly

geared toward offensive spellcasting. Onlookers might

even  think  that  you  have  paid  your  companions  for

their protection. In fact, you are in a unique position

to seem like much less than you are, effectively hiding

in plain sight.

Adventuring is a means to an end for you; your primary

goal is always acquiring bits of linguistic lore. Still, if you

are heading into dangerous situations to acquire such

knowledge, you might as well enjoy the experience by

surrounding yourself with trustworthy colleagues. It is

unlikely that they share your passion for languages, but

they might accept your impartial leadership.

Combat

Words are your weapons, and you wield them as a  ghter

does a swordsometimes with  nesse, sometimes with

a  heavy  hand.  While  most  enemies  might  initially

overlook the threat you pose, you are also a spellcaster

of no small ability. Regardless of whether you came to

be a dracolexi as a bard or a sorcerer (or by some other

path), you can devote many of your known spells toward

stealth,  utility,  and  travel.  While  offensive  spells  are

important, you can always use your Draconic words to

affect your enemies.

Advancement

Dracolexi are academic by nature. Most have a background

either in research (hailing from an established college

or  university)  or  in  exploring  ancient  monasteries  or

temples. Perhaps, at some point during your studies, you

came upon an obscure dialect embedded in an ancient

historical text. It seemed to go unnoticed by others, but

you became obsessed with it. Following the patterns of

this dialect, you were able to discover the existence of

Draconic words that, when properly spoken by a proper

individual, could alter reality.

While you might have discovered these arcane patterns

on your own, tracing them back to a single word of power,

most dracolexi candidates have a teacher. Instructors have

been known to provide seeded material to all their stu-

dents and then privately mentor the ones who notice the

lexicological patterns. A brilliant character can continue

this research on his own, but most dracolexi candidates

seek out assistance, including those who make their initial

discoveries alone.

Resources

If you are mentored by dracolexi instructors, the resources

they have amassed are available to you. These typically

include libraries of scrolls and tomes that can aid your

search for additional linguistic magic. Such a library or

resource can even become the place to which you report

back with new  ndings or cross-reference the discoveries

made by other dracolexi in the  eld.

DRACOLEXI IN THE WORLD

I didnt know why that little fellow was so smug, until he sent

a stream of  re arcing back at the gnome wizard with a single

word. Now I get it.

Bragon Stonesplitter, human barbarian

Player characters are more likely to encounter a dracolexi

studying  a  rune-covered  wall  in  the  deepest  part  of  a

monster- lled dungeon than to cross paths with one in a

civilized metropolis. When not adventuring, a dracolexi

is usually trying to gain access to private libraries in the

hope of expanding his research. The PCs might find

themselves recruited by a dracolexi for a spelunking

expedition, delving into caves or abandoned lairs that no

one previously knew existed. A dracolexi can become so

 xated on his pursuit of Draconic words that he fails to

notice imminent dangers and so counts on others nearby

to remain alert.

a dracolexi enters a library, he casts detect magic right

away in the hope of finding such books, reading those

texts first and thus saving valuable time. If dracolexi

know one another well, these runes and symbols might

be personalized.

NPC Reactions

Dracolexi move through a world that remains largely

unaware of their profession and purpose. Only those

with  significant  education  or  magical  knowledge

would know of dracolexi at all. Most members of the

class take advantage of this anonymity, preferring to

maintain  privacy  when  it  comes  to  the  reasons  for

their travels.

Individuals who are aware of the  eld of study, such as

librarians, scholars, and other academic types, will have a

starting attitude of friendly, unless the dracolexi refuses

to share information, in which case the attitude will drop

to indifferent. Those who are not aware of dracolexi as a

whole will have a starting attitude of indifferent toward

any particular dracolexi.

DRACOLEXI LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowl-

edge (history) can research the dracolexi to learn more

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read

or paraphrase the following, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: Dracolexi are spontaneous spellcasters who

somehow draw their power from the study of ancient

languages.

DC 15: Dracolexi cast potent power word spells, using

their knowledge of Draconic dialects to great effect.

DC 20: Dracolexi include Draconic words of power

in their spells verbal components to create additional

effects.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success

can learn important details about specific dracolexi,

including notable accomplishments and mentors from

whom they studied.

Player characters trying to locate a dracolexi should

make a DC 20 Gather Information check to discover

the  necessary  intermediaries  and  protocols  for  con-

tacting one. If the player characters are searching for

a dracolexi in a library, give them a +2 circumstance

bonus on the check.

Organization

Dracolexi really have nothing to lose from full disclo-

sure, and so they openly exchange information whenever

the opportunity presents itself. They always value new

perspectives  when  it  comes  to  their  highly  obscure

interests,  regardless  of  alignment.  In  this  respect,  a

dracolexi puts his academic work before personal feel-

ings when the possibility of pooling resources exists.

Finding  more  than  three  dracolexi  in  one  place  is

extremely rare, however, since they are always traveling

to follow up leads.

Instead  of  an  organization,  dracolexi  have  a  way  of

communicating with each other by leaving arcane marks

on the scrolls and tomes they read,  agging them after

a fashion for other members of their profession. When

DRACOLEXI IN THE GAME

The dracolexi class is ideal for characters who disdain

brawny displays of strength but enjoy the unassuming

powers of mind and thought that go unnoticed until too

late. This prestige class appeals to players who enjoy a cal-

culated sense of drama that comes from having a few tricks

up their sleeve. Dracolexi have an economy of motion that

really shines when they  ght enemy spellcasters.

Adaptation

Dracolexi  are  appropriate  for  any  campaign  setting

in  which  recorded  history  is  valued  by  society  and

accumulated in libraries. These repositories of knowledge

do not have to be colleges or universities, but can take

the form of churches or temples that store information

in some form. A dracolexi could even be found studying

ancient runes etched or painted onto the walls of caverns.

A dracolexi does not consider any detail too small for

his attention.

Sample Encounter

The player characters are hired by an aristocrat to find

and recover a kobold dracolexi named Litrix who was

sponsored to explore a recently discovered underground

cavern.  The  dracolexi  is  late  in  reporting  back  to  his

patron, who fears that he has been kept from completing

his mission.

Cavern Entrance: The entrance to the recently discovered

cavern (depicted on the accompanying map) is not dif cult

to  nd, now that the existence of the cavern has been

recorded. The aristocrat who hires the PCs provides them

with a map that shows the location of the cave mouth that

leads to the cavern entrance.

The  ancient  cavern  is  divided  into  four  chambers,

with a pool of shallow water in the middle of each one.

Interspersed  throughout  the  place  are  clusters  of  sta-

lagmites and sections of the cavern walls that contain

carved Draconic runes. The ceiling of the chamber is at

least 30 feet above the  oor of the place in all areas. The

cavern contains no light source, so those who enter must

provide their own illumination or have the ability to see

in the dark.

Stalagmite  Formations:  These  stone  protuberances  all

extend about 5 feet above the  oor of the cavern, provid-

ing cover for any Medium or smaller creature that moves

behind one of them. Other than being an impediment to

movement (Climb DC 10 to negotiate one 5-foot square),

they are unremarkable.

Carved Draconic Runes: At various places on the walls

that form the perimeter of the cavern are runes engraved

in  an  ancient  form  of  the  Draconic  language.  Some  of

these  locations  contain  only  one  or  two  legible  expres-

sions or symbols; in other places, the messages are much

lengthier. A character who can read Draconic might be

able to decipher one or more of these collections of words

(particulars are left to the DM).

Shallow Water: In these areas on the map, standing water

hampers movement slightly. Treat the water as a shallow

bog (DMG 88).

Litrix: The kobold dracolexi named Litrix is alive and

well. He has set up a crude campsite at the location indi-

cated on the map, far enough away from the entrance

that hes not likely to be surprised by any intruders.

His  sundark  goggles  (new  equipment  described  on

page 123) offset his light sensitivity, meaning that he

is not disadvantaged if someone carrying a light source

comes near.

EL 11: Litrix believes this cavern to be a great reposi-

tory of draconic lore and secrets, possibly containing

information about other Draconic words that the dracolexi

can add to his repertoire. He has become covetous of the

discovery, no longer wanting to share the knowledge with

his patron, and tries to drive the characters off if they

approach him.

DRAGON DEVOTEE

I am even more than I appear to be. At heart, I am dragon.

Braxon

Dragons hold a great fascination for some individuals,

leading those folk into closer and closer association with

the  powerful  race.  Some  individuals  (primarily  those

related to sorcerers) feel the call more strongly, thanks

to their dragon ancestry, occasionally even leading them

to attempt to awaken their blood and bring those traits

to  the  fore.  Learning  more  about  dragons  is  the   rst

step toward understanding them. The dragon devotee

expands upon this knowledge and begins to manifest

dragonlike qualities.

BECOMING A DRAGON DEVOTEE

Dragon devotees are most often fighters or rogues who

desire  the  power  and  the  glory  of  dragonkind.  They

need to have basic knowledge about dragons and under-

stand their language. Comprehending the mindset of

dragons  lets  you  delve  deeper  into  what  it  means  to

be a dragon and to help you become one of them. An

above-average Charisma score is necessary to gain the

classs spellcasting ability.

Entry Requirements

Race: Nondragon, cant have draconic template.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Languages: Draconic.

CLASS FEATURES

As  you  advance  through  the  levels  of  this  class,  you

improve your combat skills and gain improved (or new)

spellcasting abilities.

Ability Increase (Ex): When you enter this class, your

Charisma score increases by 2 points. At 3rd level, your

Constitution score improves by 2 points. At 5th level, your

Strength score improves by 2 points.

Natural Armor (Ex): A dragon devotees skin thickens

and toughens, developing minuscule scales. This change

provides a +1 bonus to your existing natural armor bonus

to AC, or simply a +1 natural armor bonus if you had no

natural armor to begin with.

Combat  Technique  (Ex):  At  2nd  level  and  again  at

4th level, you become more deadly in combat. Each time

you gain this class feature, you can choose either to take a

bonus feat (any feat from the list of  ghter bonus feats for

which you meet the prerequisite) or to improve the extra

feature  is  described  in  the  scout  class,  and  the  sudden

strike  class  feature  is  found  in  the  ninja  class;  both  of

these classes appear in Complete Adventurer.)

You must already have the sneak attack, skirmish, or

sudden strike class feature in order to choose this option.

If  you  have  more  than  one  of  these  class  features,  you

must apply the bonus to a single class feature (but you

can choose a different class feature at 4th level from what

you chose at 2nd level).

Draconic Resistance (Ex): At 2nd level, you become

resistant to paralysis and magic sleep effects, gaining a

+4 bonus on saves against such effects.

Ignore  Spell  Failure  (Ex):  Normally,  armor  of  any

type  interferes  with  an  arcane  spellcasters  gestures,

which  can  cause  his  spells  to  fail  if  those  spells  have

somatic  components.  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  you  can

ignore the arcane spell failure chance when casting 0-level

and 1st-level arcane spells. This bene t doesnt apply to

spells higher than 1st level, including 0-level or 1st-level

spells that occupy a higher-level spell slot because of the

application of a metamagic feat.

Spellcasting: At 3rd level and 5th level, you gain spells

per day, spells known, and an increase in caster level as

if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  sorcerer.  You  do  not,

however, gain any other bene t a character of that class

would have gained.

If you dont have any levels in sorcerer before reach-

ing 3rd level in this class, you gain spells per day, spells

known, and an increase in caster level as if you were a

1st-level sorcerer. You use all the normal rules for sorcerer

spellcasting as described in the Players Handbook.

Upon reaching 3rd level in this class, you add magic fang

to your sorcerer spell list as a 1st-level spell and greater

magic fang to your sorcerer spell list as a 3rd-level spell.

You can choose these spells as spells known (assuming,

in the latter case, that you are able to know and cast 3rd-

level sorcerer spells), and you can use spell trigger items

such as wands that contain these spells.

Claws (Ex): At 4th level, you gain two claw attacks that

each  deal  damage  according  to  your  size  (see  the  table

below).  If  you  already  have  claw  attacks,  use  the  value

given here or your existing claw damage, whichever is

greater. These claws are primary attacks unless you already

have secondary claw attacks, in which case they remain

as secondary attacks.

Draconic  Template:  At  5th  level,  you  gain  all  the

abilities of the draconic creature template (see page 74)

that you have not already gained as dragon devotee class

featuresexcept that you do not apply the templates level

adjustment. Speci cally, you gain the dragonblood subtype

in addition to any subtype you might already have. You

also gain darkvision out to 60 feet, low-light vision, and a

+2 bonus on Intimidate checks and Spot checks.

PLAYING A DRAGON DEVOTEE

You admire dragons for their puissance and power, feeling

an inexplicable link to them. Because you are interested

in delving into the mysteries of dragonhood, you decide

to pursue the life of a dragon devotee to explore that link

and awaken the heritage within you.

You love to speak Draconic and to talk about dragons

with  others  who  likewise  admire  this  most  noble  of

creatures.  Most  dragon  devotees  feel  drawn  to  like-

minded individuals. They want to share their knowledge

of  and  interest  in  dragons  with  others.  Indeed,  as  a

dragon  devotee  changes  physically  and  mentally  to

become  more  like  a  dragon,  he  wants  to  share  this

experience with those who can appreciate his growth

and development.

If the opportunity to interact with a dragon arises, youre

the  rst to take it. While you would prefer to converse

peacefully with a dragon, youre not afraid to pit your

own  ghting prowess against one if diplomacy isnt an

option. To one as devoted to them as you are, dragons are

the ultimate friend or the ultimate foe.

Combat

Dragon  devotees  generally  use  the   ghting  techniques

they mastered before joining the prestige class. The new

abilities they gain from advancing in the class complement

their old ones and expand their options.

If  you  were  a  fighter  or  some  other  martial  char-

acter  before  taking  up  this  class,  youll  find  that  the

additional  Constitution  and  Strength  the  class  pro-

vides makes up for the lower base attack bonus. The

spellcasting ability gained at 3rd and 5th levels provides

greater autonomy and more options. Even if youre at

your best in melee combat, you might still appreciate

being  able  to  use  spells  such  as  enlarge

person or expeditious retreat to make your-

self  more  capable  (or  more  elusive)  on

the battlefield.

If you were a rogue or a similar

kind  of  character  before  be-

ing  attracted  to  the  dragon

devotee  class,  you  might

continue to improve your

sneak  attack  ability  (or  a

similar class feature), or

you might bene t more

from  selecting  bonus

feats  that  enhance

your  stealth-based

approach,  such  as

Improved Feint. For

spells,  good  selec-

tions are weaponlike

spells (see the side-

bar) that allow you to

add your sneak attack

damage  after  a  suc-

cessful touch attack,

such  as  ray  of  frost  or

shocking grasp.

If  you  came  into

the class as a sorcer-

er, you still use spells

as  your  primary  combat  focus.  You

end  up  trading  some  spellcasting  ability  for  a  better

Charisma score, which improves your spells save DCs

and gives you one or more additional bonus spells. The

boost  you  receive  in  Strength  and  Constitution  im-

proves  your  chance  of  surviving  close  combat  when

you cant avoid it.

Advancement

A dragon devotee must have a strong initial interest in

dragons. Either through culture or through training, you

have acquired the ability to speak Draconic, and you know

something about arcane matters. In addition, you must

have a moderate level of combat prowess (represented

by the base attack bonus entry requirement).

Becoming a dragon devotee and honing ones skills

are not structured, formal events. While at its core the

class simply allows you to become more dragonlike, it

also  offers  opportunities  to  gain  bonus  feats  or

increase  sneak  attack  damage.  All  of  these

aspects  contribute  to  simultaneously

improving the skills you had when

entering the dragon devotee pres-

tige class while enhancing your

inner dragon.

If you choose to pursue

the  dragon  devotee  class

to  the  end,  your  charac-

ter receives the draconic

template. Alternatively,

learning  more  about

dragons  might  entice

you to enter the dragon

disciple  prestige  class

(DMG 183). After attain-

ing  3rd  level  in  the

dragon  devotee  pres-

tige class, youll likely

have  what  you  need  to

join  (assuming  you  have

built  up  your  ranks  in

Knowledge  [arcana]).  The

dragon  disciple  pres-

tige  class offers you the

opportunity to transform

into a half-dragon. Many

dragon devotees feel the allure of this option.

If you have chosen to create in yourself an even closer

tie to dragons, the dragon devotee class might be just a

beginning, preparing you for better things.

Resources

Although dragon devotees have no regular organization,

they do have shared interests with other devotees, dragon

disciples, and dragon heart mages (see page 88). Individu-

als who hold a similar interest in dragons, such as these,

are often very friendly toward others who share their

passion. The support of those others might be as limited

as being eager to share reminiscences or as expansive as

volunteering to team up for dragon-related activities such

as a diplomatic foray or a hunt.

WEAPONLIKE SPELLS

A  weaponlike  spell,  simply  put,  is  any  spell  that  requires  an

attack roll to affect a target and that deals damage (lethal, non-

lethal, ability damage, or ability drain) if the attack roll succeeds.

(The concept is discussed in full in Complete Arcane, starting

on page 85.)

In  all  relevant  respects,  an  attack  with  a  weaponlike  spell

functions like an attack with a natural weapon or a manufac-

tured weapon. It threatens a critical hit on a roll of 20 and deals

double  damage  on  a  critical  hit  (unless  a  spells  description

indicates otherwise). It can be used to make a sneak attacka

fact that is critically important to many dragon devotees. As a

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

general rule, if a sneak attack with a weaponlike spell succeeds,

the extra damage dealt is of the same type as the damage nor-

mally dealt by the spell.

For instance, consider a 7th-level rogue/3rd-level dragon

devotee who chose to improve his sneak attack ability at 2nd

level  in  the  prestige  class  and  who  selected  chill  touch  as

one of his sorcerer spells known when he attained 3rd level

as a devotee. If he succeeds on a melee touch attack after

casting the spell and is in a position to make a sneak attack

on his target, the attack deals a total of 6d6 points of nega-

tive energy damage and, if his target fails its save, 1 point of

Strength damage.

DRAGON DEVOTEES

IN THE WORLD

The one youre looking for is over there, at the bar. Ill bet you  ve

gold pieces that if you say the word dragon loudly, hell be over

here before you can  nish counting out my winnings.

Lidda

The dragon devotee class is a great way for a character to

become a bit more dragonlike. It also provides an effective

way for members of many classes to meet the requirements

for the dragon disciple prestige class.

Organization

Dragon devotees have much in common with dragon

disciples and dragonheart mages. Although no speci c

organization caters to these individuals, they  nd great

solace  and  enjoyment  in  speaking  with  others  who

share their devotion to dragons. Their common interests

sometimes lead them to the same places. Dragon devotees

wind up meeting together at dragon-focused events or

in dragon-inhabited areas.

Quite a few dragon devotees take their admiration and

imitation of dragons so seriously that they decide to wor-

ship one of the dragon deities. In such cases, a church or

shrine dedicated to the deity serves as a meeting place for

those devoted worshipers.

NPC Reactions

The  increased  Charisma  that  characters  gain  upon

entering the dragon devotee class means they have a

good  chance  of  being  more  likable  than  the  average

individual. NPCs who meet the character for the first

time will have a starting attitude of friendly, at least so

long as the dragon devotee character does not manifest

any blatantly draconic features in his appearance. Such

an  abnormal  appearance  reduces  the  default  starting

attitude to indifferent.

Dragon devotees are rare, and they have no organized

presence in the world. Because of this, each dragon devotee

in uences the NPCs around him without regard to his

chosen profession. The exceptions to this rule are those

dragon devotees who have sought out and acquired the

company of dragons. A character traveling with or serv-

ing dragons can expect a reaction ranging from hostile

to  helpful,  depending  on  the  type  of  dragon  he  serves.

Following  a  black  dragon  will  cause  individuals  in  the

surrounding  area  to  hate  and  fear  you,  while  serving  a

silver dragon will invite the admiration and envy of any

locals you might meet.

Most dragons enjoy the attention that a dragon devotee

lavishes on them, because such attention feeds their vanity.

Dragons will greet a dragon devotee with a starting attitude

of indifferent, rather than unfriendly or hostile, as can be

their wont.

DRAGON DEVOTEE LORE

Characters  with  the  bardic  knowledge  ability  or  ranks

in Knowledge (arcana) can research dragon devotees to

learn more about them. When a character makes a bardic

knowledge check or a skill check, read or paraphrase the

following, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Some individuals  nd dragons so fascinating

that they try to become more like them. These creatures

call themselves dragon devotees.

DC 15: Rogues and  ghters who become dragon devo-

tees manage to maintain most of their key abilities while

making themselves more dragonlike.

DC 20: Dragon devotees become draconic creatures in

the end, though some are not satis ed with this transfor-

mation and follow a different path to seek even greater

draconic power.

Player  characters  trying  to  locate  a  dragon  devotee

should make a DC 20 Gather Information check to dis-

cover the location of and the method for contacting one.

Characters who make this check in a settlement located

within 10 miles of a dragons lair get a +2 circumstance

bonus on their check.

DRAGON DEVOTEES IN THE GAME

Dragon devotee player characters and NPCs are easy to

work into an ongoing game. As long as your campaign

has  dragons,  its  natural  to  find  characters  and  crea-

tures dedicated to becoming more like them. A player

character need not pursue the life of a dragon devotee.

Its a fine class to dabble in, but need not be pursued

to  its  conclusion.  Its  designed  to  enable  a  character

who doesnt have spontaneous spellcasting ability to

meet the requirements of the dragon disciple prestige

class after only a couple of levels. Sorcerers or bards

might  find  the  Charisma  increase  attractive  enough

to give up some of their spellcasting ability (in terms

of caster level).

If  one  or  more  player  characters  in  the  game  are

dragon devotees, you should provide them with some

chances  to  focus  on  their  dragon-inspired  abilities:

opportunities  to  speak  Draconic,  encounters  with

adversarial or friendly dragon, a book about dragons

in a treasure hoard, armor made from dragonhide, or

even just occasionally meeting another dragon devotee

or dragon disciple.

Adaptation

The dragon devotee is a very versatile class that should

appeal  to  a  wide  spectrum  of  characters.  Its  focus  on

dragons is broad and should  t into any campaign with

little or no customization.

The dragon devotee  lls a gap that exists between the

dragon  disciple  prestige  class  and  characters  such  as

 ghters and rogues who might  nd that class attractive.

In addition, the class provides a way for a character to add

a template gradually instead of in one fell swoop.

Sample Encounter

Because dragon devotees are fascinated by dragons, player

characters are most apt to encounter one in conjunction

with a dragon encounter or story arc. If the PCs are acting

in support of a dragon, the encounter is almost certain to

be amicable. If the PCs are hunting a dragon or its lair,

the  dragon  devotees  reaction  is  much  less  predictable.

Much depends upon the alignment of the dragon and the

alignment of the devotee.

EL 7: Braxon is a human dragon devotee who origi-

nally trained as a fighter. About a year ago, he was part of

a group of adventurers who tried to raid an adult green

dragons lair and failed. The dragon, Kallionastiryne,

gave each of the intruders the option of pledging loyalty

to him and serving him. Braxon was the only one to

do so.

Kallionastiryne killed the others and let the fighter

live. For the past year, Braxon has been serving him and

adopting more and more of the dragon lifestyle as a dragon

devotee. He is currently escorting one of Kallionastirynes

children, a young green dragon named Ottwarslyndanox,

to visit her father. He did not care about dragons or dragon-

kind in general when he  rst came into Kallionastirynes

service, but he is becoming more interested as he learns

more about dragons through his service. He feels duty

bound to serve Kallionastiryne and does his best to protect

his ward.

DRAGONHEART MAGE

Claws and teeth are all very well if  ghting is what you like,

but my dragon blood has more practical uses.

 Wedlen Mooncaller, dragonheart mage

Some  arcane  spellcasters  are  fascinated  both  by  the

dragons hardy physical nature as well as the dragons

spellcasting ability. The dragonheart mage is perfect

for  the  dedicated  spellcaster  who  wishes  to  embrace

the  power  of  dragon  blood  while  still  advancing  in

magical expertise.

BECOMING A DRAGONHEART MAGE

This  prestige  class  is  available  only  to  those  who  can

demonstrate draconic heritage. Most dragonheart mages

are sorcerers, who ascribe their magical ability to a dragon

ancestor, and this class enhances the ability to cast sorcer-

ous magic. Multiclass sorcerer/bards might also  nd the

dragonheart mage interesting, since it helps build on their

already impressive Charisma-based abilities. Kobolds are

drawn to the class, which offers greater physical strength

as well as improved spellcasting. Mere dabblers in arcane

magic are less likely to become dragonheart mages.

Entry Requirements

Spellcasting: Ability to spontaneously cast arcane spells.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks.

Feats: Draconic Heritage*.

Languages: Draconic.

New feat described on page 102.

CLASS FEATURES

As you advance in this class, you cultivate your draconic

heritage  by  developing  a  breath  weapon  and  gaining

draconic feats, at the cost of a couple of levels worth of

spellcasting ability.

Draconic Breath (Su): At 1st level, you gain the Dra-

conic Breath feat. As a dragonheart mage, you realize some

additional bene ts from taking this feat. As stated in the

feat description on page 102, you can use a standard action

to change arcane spell energy into a breath weapon that

deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell that you

expend. As you gain levels in this prestige class, however,

the amount of damage you can deal increases.

At  6th  level,  your  breath  weapon  deals  2d8  points  of

damage per level of the spell you give up.

At 10th level, your breath weapon deals 3d6 points of

damage per level of the spell you give up.

Spellcasting: At each level except 1st and 6th, you

gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level

(and  spells  known,  if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also

gained  a  level  in  a  spellcasting  class  to  which  you

belonged  before  adding  the  prestige  class  level.  You

do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of

that class would have gained. If you had more than one

spellcasting class before becoming a dragonheart mage,

you must decide to which class to add each level for the

purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and

spells known.

Draconic Feat: At 2nd, 4th, and 8th level, you gain a

bonus draconic feat. Choose any draconic feat for which

you meet the prerequisite, as given on page 99.

PLAYING A DRAGONHEART MAGE

As a dragonheart mage, you acquire a few draconic powers

while accepting a slower spellcasting progression. You do

not become a draconic creature or a half-dragon, as dragon

devotees and dragon disciples do, but you also have more

freedom to choose which expressions of draconic power

you wish to take on.

Combat

You are tougher than the average arcane spellcaster, but

you are still not a front-line combatant by any means.

Your strengths lie in taking advantage of your draconic

abilities  while  assisting  your  partys  combatants  with

your breath weapon. Your best role in combat is to exploit

your Draconic Breath feat to its fullest while backing it

up with spellcasting.

Once  you  reach  2nd  level,  you  begin  to  acquire

additional  draconic  abilities  in  the  form  of  draconic

feats.  Depending  on  the  feats  you  choose,  you  could

improve your Armor Class, hit points, resistances, or

other characteristics that would enhance your surviv-

ability in combat.

Advancement

You  likely  started  down  this  path  because  you  were

fascinated by the innate power of dragons. You might

have been tempted at first by the dragon disciple class,

until  you  realized  that  it  was  more  combat-oriented

than you desire and would require you to give up too

much of your spellcasting advancement. For you, the

Table 55: The Dragonheart Mage

Hit Die: d6

transformation to a half-dragon is less important than

waking the magical power of a draconic heritage.

You are driven by a thirst for knowledge of all things

draconic,  and  as  you  advance  in  power,  you  are  able  to

face more and more dangerous challenges to  nd it. You

might seek out and explore lairs of dragons long dead or

speak to those who live there yet. In this search, you might

receive commissions from arcane spellcasters who are of

a less exploratory bent but seek unusual materials or bits

of lore. You can increase your own experience in this way

as well as gain monetary rewards.

DRAGONHEART MAGES

IN THE WORLD

Dragonheart  mages  are  the  adventuring  archae-

ologists  of  a  fantasy  setting.  They  are  bolder  about

exploring  uncharted  territory  than  more  scholarly

magic specialists.

Organization

Dragonheart  mages  have  no  special  organization;  in

fact, traditional magic establishments find them to be

bizarre and difficult to manage. As a dragonheart mage,

you are likely to be found in the lounge of an adven-

turers association, spinning tales of your most recent

exploits and eagerly seeking rumors of new mysteries to

be unearthed.

Sometimes, just like an adventuring archaeologist,

you might have to have a real job to hold body and soul

together between outings. You might be a visiting lecturer

at an academy of magic, for example, or you could spend

time between adventures crafting magic items to  nance

the next expedition.

NPC Reactions

When  you  make  the  deliberate  choice  to  become  a

hybrid  of  dragon  and  some  other  race,  you  provoke

strong  reactions,  both  negative  and  positive.  Among

those you meet for the first time, starting attitudes will

be  either  friendly  or  unfriendly.  Almost  no  one  you

meet will feel indifferent toward you, unless they are

familiar with or have some degree of draconic heritage

themselves.

Given the lack of speci c organization held by dragon-

heart mages, you rarely enounter anyone who has heard

(Gather  Information  DC  10).  Having  a  dragon  disciple

in the party reduces the DC of this check by 5. Dragon

disciples and dragonheart mages share similar motivations,

even if they follow divergent paths

DRAGONHEART MAGES

IN THE GAME

As a player character, you are a good choice for an adven-

turing  partys  arcane  spellcaster.  Unlike  a  half-dragon

or  even  a  dragon  disciple,  you  dont  have  the  powerful

physique that might let you travel alone. In return, you can

provide magical support to your companions that is almost

the equal of a pure sorcerers, while being able to defend

yourself ably against enemies who focus on eliminating

the spellcaster quickly.

An NPC dragonheart mage might well be a rival for

a  treasure  or  exploratory  mission.  Those  who  choose

evil  dragon  varieties  follow  a  path  of  greed  or  power

lust, and they are likely to lead bands of lesser creatures

in their service to pursue their ends rather than join a

group of equals.

Adaptation

The idea of exploring a racial heritage to unlock some of its

power can be extended to other types of creatures besides

dragons. For example, a skum in service to an aboleth

might learn to awaken some of the aboleth na-

ture within itself, or an aasimar could try to

get in touch with his celestial

heritage.

As a DM, you could adapt

the concept of the dragon-

heart  mage  (or  the  dragon

disciple)  to  gradually  confer

some of the innate abilities of

an ancestral creature type on

the  character  progressing

in the class. For example,

the skum above would

slowly  acquire  mind-

affecting  abilities  that

become  more  powerful

with increasing level; gain

the aquatic subtype; and per-

haps develop aboleth slime.

The  aasimar  could  follow  a

path more like that of the drag-

on disciple, culminating in the

half-celestial template.

Sample Encounter

Wedlen  Mooncaller  has  a  touch  of

dragon in her blood, and her ability with sor-

cery outshines many others of her kind. She has

turned her magical talents and her encyclopedic

knowledge to greedy pursuits. Now she is a rival

of the PCs in the hunt for an ancient treasure, and she stops

at nothing to eliminate the competition.

SINGER OF CONCORDANCE

The love of Io nourishes all his children.

Adetherin Forzenda, Singer of Concordance

The Singers of Concordance are a small order of wan-

dering draconic spiritual guides who begin as servitors

of Io, the Ninefold Dragon, creator of all dragonkind.

Their  mission  is  to  bring  peace  and  comfort  to  Ios

scattered children, especially the often isolated half-

dragons  and  draconic  creatures.  They  are  more  than

simple  preachers  and  healers,  howeverthey  have

been entrusted by the father of dragons with the task of

protecting the Spheres of Concordance that he created

to ease his childrens pain.

BECOMING A SINGER

OF CONCORDANCE

Almost all members of this class are dragon-descended

(half-dragons and draconic creatures), whose life apart

from normal society prepares them to undertake their

wandering ministry. The ability to cast divine magic is a

requirement of the class, and its dedication to Io means that

most entrants are clerics who worship that draconic deity.

True dragons with the ability to cast divine spells as arcane

spells could enter the class, but not many do. Sometimes

a newly christened Singer has a varied background with

a mix of experience, of which divine spellcasting forms

only a part.

Entry Requirements

Subtype: Dragonblood.

Spellcasting: Ability to cast 3rd-level divine spells.

Skills: Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.

Deity: Io.

CLASS FEATURES

The higher you rise in this class, the closer becomes your

connection to the great spheres created by Io.

Spellcasting:  At  each  level,  you  gain  new  spells  per

day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class to which you belonged before adding the prestige

class level. You do not, however, gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained. If you had more

than one spellcasting class before becoming a Singer of

Concordance, you must decide to which class to add each

level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster

level, and spells known.

Aspect of Peace (Su): Upon entering this class, you

attune yourself to the great Song of Io and to one Sphere

of Concordance that is sustained by Ios song. In so doing,

you draw that spheres aspect of peace spiritually closer

to you and the reality you inhabit. This effect is always

active while you are conscious (and the effect moves with

you), but not if you are unconscious or dead. It grants

you  immunity  to  the   rst  compulsion  effect  (magical

or otherwise) that would otherwise affect you each day,

and for the remainder of the day grants you a +4 morale

bonus  on  saving  throws  to  resist  further  compulsion

effects. Each ally within 10 feet of you at any time during

the day feels a re ection of the Sphere of Concordances

aspect of peace and gains a +4 morale bonus on saving

throws against compulsion effects.

As you gain levels as a Singer of Concordance, you gain

the ability to call up additional aspects of a Sphere of Con-

cordance. As this occurs, you can enjoy multiple aspects

operating  simultaneously,  without  con ict.  In  fact,  the

more aspects called into existence, the closer you draw to

your chosen Sphere of Concordance .

Bonus Domain: At 2nd level, you gain access to an addi-

tional cleric domain from the following list of domains:

Dragon*, Healing, Knowledge, Magic, Strength, Travel, or

Wealth. You gain the granted power associated with the

domain you choose, and you can select the spells in that

domain as your daily domain spells.

Domain described in Draconomicon, page 107.

Aspect of Refuge (Su): At 3rd level, you increase your

attunement to your sphere, allowing you to call upon its

aspect of refuge. You can call up this effect as a standard

action, and dismiss it as a swift action (see page 122) or

as a free action made in conjunction with attacking any

other creature (automatic dismissal), or by moving more

than 20 feet from where you first called up the aspect

of refuge.

All creatures within 20 feet of you that attempt to strike

or otherwise target any other creature, even with a spell,

must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level

+ your Wis modi er). If the save succeeds, the creature can

attack normally and is not affected. If the save fails, the

creature cant follow through with the attack. That part of

its action is lost, and it cant directly attack another creature

while it remains within the refuge. Creatures that do not

attempt to target another creature with an attack or other

effect remain unaffected.

The refuge does not prevent creatures within 20 feet

of you from being attacked or affected by area or effect

spells, or from other attacks launched from farther away.

You can use nonattack spells or otherwise act within the

refuge without dismissing it. For instance, you could

heal wounds, cast a bless spell, perform an augury, or

summon creatures.

Aspect  of  Exclusion  (Sp):  At  5th  level,  you  further

increase your attunement to your sphere, allowing you to

call upon its aspect of exclusion once per day for a period of

up to 1 round per caster level. You can call up this effect

as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action or by

moving more than 10 feet from where you  rst called up

the aspect of exclusion.

The aspect of exclusion appears as an immobile, faintly

shimmering sphere that surrounds you and all creatures

within 10 feet of you. This aspect prevents all spell effects

of 4th level or lower from entering the sphere. This effect

is  otherwise  identical  to  globe  of  invulnerability  (and  is

considered a 6th-level spell effect).

After reaching 8th level, you can use this ability twice

per day.

Aspect of Healing (Su): At 6th level, you become

able to call upon your spheres aspect of healing. This

aspect is always active while you are conscious (and

the effect moves with you), but not if you are uncon-

scious or dead. Any healing performed within 10 feet

of you (and any healing you initiate) cures an additional

1d8 points.

SPHERES OF CONCORDANCE

The  great  dragon  deity  Io  created  these  retreats  among  the

planes so that his children could find rest, with the Singers of

Concordance as their guides.

When a character enters the Singer of Concordance class

and  chooses  a  Sphere  of  Concordance  from  which  to  draw

off aspects, that Sphere becomes linked to him. Other entrants

into the class thereafter choose other spheres.

A Sphere of Concordance is a demiplane, roughly 500 feet

across, with the following traits.

(cid:129)  Normal gravity.

(cid:129)  Minor positive-dominant.

(cid:129)  Divinely morphic. Io or his emissaries can prevent the en-

trance of nondraconic creatures, or expel any creatures that

commit violence within the demiplane.

(cid:129)  Mildly neutral-aligned.

(cid:129)  Enhanced Magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use posi-

tive energy, including cure spells, and spells from the Com-

munity*, Creation*, Healing, and Protection domains, are

empowered (as if the Empower Spell feat had been applied to

them, but the spells dont require higher-level slots). Spells

and spell-like abilities that are already empowered are unaf-

fected by this benefit.

Domains described in Complete Divine, pages 137138.

(cid:129)  Impeded Magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use nega-

tive energy, including inflict spells, and spells from the Death,

Destruction, and Madness* domains are impeded.

Domain described in Complete Divine, page 139.

(cid:129)  Creatures within a Sphere of Concordance are always subject

to the aspects of peace, refuge, healing, exclusion, and safety,

as defined and described in the Singer of Concordance pres-

tige class entry.

The  environment  within  a  Sphere  of  Concordance  is  pleas-

ant,  with  mild  temperatures  and  a  normal  atmosphere.  The

sphere is filled with beautiful images, precious works of art,

glittering  gold,  and  shining  gems  for  the  enjoyment  and  ap-

preciation  of  its  draconic  sojourners.  Because  the  demiplane

is positive-dominant, the colors, scents, and other sensations

provoked  by  these  features  are  greatly  heightened.  However,

they are bonded with the demiplane: Any attempt to remove

riches from this place causes the material to revert to the raw

essence of creation, vanishing instantly. (The essence returns

to the demiplane and is then reshaped.)

Being a demiplane, a Sphere of Concordance is not easily

accessible  with  plane  shift  or  other  means  of  planar  travel.

Attempts to reach a sphere without guidance or prior knowl-

edge (or the Singer of Concordance 10th-level class feature)

result  in  the  traveler  arriving  on  a  random  Outer  Plane.

Creatures that enter a Sphere of Concordance that is already

linked  to  another  Singer  of  Concordance  are  considered

undesignated (unless they have been previously designated

by the other Singer), and thus are adversely affected by the

spheres aspect of safety.

Undead within 10 feet of you that are dealt damage by

a cure spell take an additional 1d8 points of damage.

Aspect of Safety (Su): At 9th level, you can call upon

your spheres aspect of safety once per day for a period of

up to 1 minute per caster level. You can call up the effect

as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action or by

moving more than 10 feet from where you  rst called up

the aspect of safety.

The area within the 10-foot-radius sphere sur-

rounding you is impervious to planar travel of

any sort, except if such travel is initiated

by you. The effect also deals 6d6 points

of damage to creatures that attempt

to enter it other than those you des-

ignate. A Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your

character level + your Wis modi er)

halves the damage dealt. An undes-

ignated creature within the sphere

takes no further damage beyond the

initial 6d6 points, unless it exits and

then attempts to reenter.

Sphere  of  Concordance

(Sp): At 10th level, you perfect

your  unison  with  the  great

Song. You gain the ability to

transport you and up to eight

willing  companions  to  and

from a particular Sphere of Concor-

dance at will. This effect is considered

a 7th-level spell effect.

PLAYING A SINGER

OF CONCORDANCE

A Singer of Concordance is

an individual at once alone

and interconnected with the

world. As you travel and min-

ister  to  the  dragon-descended,

you might serve as a wandering men-

dicant, head up a caravan or a traveling

encampment, or adventure side by side with

trusted companions (who might themselves

have have descended from dragons).

enemies to hurt your companions, or you can protect them

utterly by transporting them to safety within a Sphere

of Concordance.

Advancement

The worship of Io is not very formalized. Some dragons

might have a simple shrine to the Ninefold Dragon in their

lairs, usually in the form of a polished metal disk af xed

to a wall. Among kobolds, Ios shrines are more stan-

dardized but are usually in the middle of a wild space.

Clerics  of  the  Concordant  Dragon

enter his worship through long

journeys  of  self-discovery;  of-

ten these are internal journeys

of the soul.

The  path  to  joining  the

Singers  of  Concordance  always

begins with seeking out (or, rare-

ly, being approached by) a Singer

and agreeing to perform services

on behalf of the organization.

Such missions usually involve

assisting  another  Singer  in

fulfilling  one  of  Ios  assign-

ments, such as calm the fury of the

red dragon in the Crags. While the

Singer focuses on more difficult as-

pects of the task, the acolyte might

help  protect  the  common  folk  in

the region or carry word of the holy

mission  to  others  who  can  assist.  If

you  perform  such  duties  satisfacto-

rily,  after  a  time  you  are  inducted

into  the  society  in  a  ceremony  that

involves several days of invocations

to  Io  and  lengthy  rituals,  culmi-

nating in a journey with another

Singer to a special Sphere of Con-

cordance in which the Song of

Io resounds eternally.

Adetherin Forzenda,

a Singer of Concordance

When  you  hear  the  great

Song of Io reverberating within

the sphere, you know you are in contact with

the very thoughts of your creatorand you

are forever changed. After you return from the

sphere, you remain aware of the Song as a dis-

tant echo in your mind.

Combat

As  a  Singer  of  Concordance,  you  are  not  a  violent

individual. Sometimes, however, combat is necessary

to preserve your own life or that of your companions.

Yours is not a front-line role, but rather one of support

and rescue.

At lower levels, your abilities keep your allies calm in

stressful situations and protect them against attacks. Since

your spellcasting ability continues to advance, you eventu-

ally gain access to higher-level divine spellsincluding

those that can hinder or harm opponents.

As you advance in level, you are able to extend more

potent  defenses  around  your  allies.  At  the  pinnacle

of your power, you can make it nearly impossible for

SINGERS OF CONCORDANCE

IN THE WORLD

If you are a half-dragon or a draconic creature, it is likely

that your early life was unhappy and  lled with loneliness.

The need to belong and to  nd meaning in existence drove

you to Ios worship, and now that you have experienced

the utter joy of the Song, you desire nothing so much as

to bring that joy to your aching kindred.

Not  many  true  dragons  follow  this  path.  On  rare

occasions, a dragon of one of the more sociable vari-

eties  (such  as  the  silver  dragon  or  the  song  dragon)

might decide to bring word of Ios joy to others, but

among other varieties a Singer is almost never found.

Most dragons simply have no need or desire to bring

knowledge of Io to others. This class is usually a career

path chosen by dragons of young adult to mature adult

age, since a wyrm tends to be sluggish and less willing

to leave its lair.

Among  the  lesser  kin  of  dragonkind,  especially

kobolds, Singers demonstrate the sense of belonging

that comes from knowing ones true heritage. A kobold

adept  leading  a  mining  party,  for  example,  might

become a Singer to bring Ios peace to all the miners in

the colony, or even to unite scattered colonies through

the great Song.

This class is well suited to divine spellcasters, but it

is also a good fit for characters with the ability to cast

divine  magic  as  arcane  spells.  Bards  and  even  true

dragons  can  thrive  in  this  class,  especially  as  their

healing and support abilities grow. Its also an excel-

lent pretext for adventuring, since you live to bring the

knowledge of the Song to all of Ios creations. You might

travel  with  a  group  of  dragon-descended  characters

to minister to their souls as they seek their fortunes,

or explore the marvels of the world while making its

inhabitants happier.

Organization

The Singers of Concordance comprise a very loose orga-

nization. Only a small number of Singers exist, and very

few of these have attained the pinnacle of their profession.

Singers are widely scattered and do not often come into

contact with one another, though sometimes an emergency

requires them to gather. To combat the isolation that could

result from such a far- ung group, they engage in regular

updates to keep all the Singers informed of the status of

the others, as well as their success in bringing the news

of the Song.

In order to become a Singer of Concordance, a char-

acter must have proved himself capable through earlier

service.  Because  of  this,  each  singer  is  granted  wide

leeway in how to handle a situation. In the matter of

admitting others to a Sphere of Concordance, however,

not much variance is tolerated. These demiplanes are

intended  primarily  for  the  children  of  Io.  Although

an  emergency  situation  might  require  that  those  of

nondragon ancestry enter one, the circumstances would

have to be dire indeed.

The  spheres  are  divinely  morphic,  and  if  Io  judges  a

singer has used this ability too recklessly, he can hedge out

those companions of a Singer who do not have draconic

heritage. The first such use generally passes without

comment, but repeatedly revealing the spheres to the

nonblooded can result in the Singer being barred from

the bliss of the Song.

NPC Reactions

Singers of Concordance bear a sort of isolated fame. To

members of the general population, a Singer is little

more than another wanderer. They have never heard of

Io and have no wish to comfort or console dragonkind,

and so they greet all Singers with a starting attitude

of indifferent.

To  those  among  their  ministry,  however,  the  Singers

are both beloved and reviled, depending on an individual

dragons taste for spiritual comfort. Among dragons and

the  dragon-descended,  starting  attitudes  vary  from

friendly to unfriendly, but are only rarely indifferent. No

dragon  or  dragon-descended  character  who  believes  in

Io will act in a hostile manner toward a Singer, no matter

how unwelcome the individual may be, out of respect for

the Ninefold Dragon.

The enemies of dragons are hostile to Singers of Con-

cordance, and some even take pleasure in the misery they

cause by killing a Singer. Beings who covet and envy the

delights of a Sphere of Concordance are a great danger

to Singers. They might either kill a priest out of spite, or

capture and torment one in hopes of forcing him to take

them to a sphere. No Singer has thus far consented to do so,

becoming instead a martyr for Io if he or she dies during

the ordeal.

SINGER OF CONCORDANCE LORE

Characters with the bardic knowledhe ability or ranks in

Knowledge (arcana) can research dragonheart mages to

learn more about them. When a character makes a bardic

knowledge check or a skill check, read or paraphrase the

following, including the information from lower DCs.

Dragons and dragon-descended have a +4 racial bonus

on this check.

DC 10: Io created all dragons and their kin. His priests

travel  the  world  ministering  to  the  children  of  Io  and

bringing them inner peace.

DC 15: A small group of Ios clergy, called the Singers

of  Concordance,  have  secret  knowledge  that  lets  them

perform wondrous acts of healing and protection.

DC 20: Io is said to have created marvelous retreats for

heartsore and injured dragons,  lled with every kind of

beauty and wealth. The Singers of Concordance are in

tune with these locations and draw on their powers to

assist all dragonkind.

DC 30: Long ago, Io defeated Roknar, who coveted

the riches within a Sphere of Concordance. Now these

demiplanes  of  healing  and  rest  are  hidden  from  the

knowledge of all but a few trusted priests, the Singers

of Concordance.

A DC 20 Gather Information check allows a character

to arrange a meeting with a Singer. Dragons and dragon-

descended have a +4 racial bonus on this check.

SINGERS OF CONCORDANCE

IN THE GAME

Player character Singers are a great asset to any adventur-

ing party, thanks to their superior defensive and healing

skills. They also help to smooth the path diplomatically

when  encountering  dragons  or  members  of  draconic

races, who universally receive these wandering priests

with respect. Characters who prefer roles involving social

interaction, diplomacy, and party support are well suited

to the class. Having a shrine to Io in the region where the

party adventures, one that is known and accessible to the

dragon-descended characters, helps encourage clerics of

the Ninefold Dragon and sets up the opportunity to enter

the organization.

As NPCs, Singers of Concordance are a way to connect

different groups of dragon kindred in the campaign world.

They can bring news of happenings that might affect the

party, and themselves be the sources of adventure. Perhaps

a Singer needs assistance in helping dragonkind who are

suffering injustice, or a party intent on plundering a hoard

unexpectedly encounters a stern Singer who calls on them

to stay their greedy hands.

Adaptation

If you wish to open up this prestige class to characters

without  draconic  heritage,  it  makes  a  suitable  choice

for those who are intimately connected with dragons

in some way, such as affiliated cultists of Io or dragon-

friends (a prestige class in Draconomicon). Perhaps the

more  distantly  related  races,  such  as  troglodytes  and

lizardfolk, have more draconic heritage in your cam-

paign and could qualify for the prestige class. In general,

though, rising in the worship of Io takes longer and is

more difficult for those who are not of strong draconic

heritage. The priests of Io set them even more strenuous

tasks to prove their dedication before considering them

as potential Singers.

Sample Encounter

Adetherin  Forzenda  grew  up  in  a  culture  that  valued

family connections, in which each town consisted mainly

of an extended clan of related individuals. His town lay at

the foothills of a mountain range in which a gold dragon

dwelled. The dragon would travel among the townsfolk in

the guise of a simple merchant, and in this form he met

the woman who became Adetherins mother.

Though the relationship was loving, a strong cultural

intolerance for marriage outside ones own people kept

the merchant from remaining with his human mate.

Adetherins  childhood  was  difficult  since  his  non-

human origins were obvious, but he was supported by

his dedicated mother and his dragon father (who made

secret  visits  when  he  could).  When  Adetherin  came

of age, he traveled into the mountains to learn more

from  his  father.  There  he  learned  of  Io  and  became

determined to seek out others of his kind. He does not

tolerate the raiding of dragon hoardsespecially those

of good dragons.

SHRINE TO IO

This map depicts a shrine to Io that has been founded

in the petri ed rib cage of an immense great wyrm gold

dragons corpse. When the end  nally came for that great

dragon, its bones literally became part of the landscape.

Now, itinerant dragons and their kin stop to pay respects

to Io and to leave a small contribution to the shrine. A

Singer of Concordance is usually present to defend the

holy place.

Entrance

The fossilized skeleton is partially buried in the surround-

ing sedimentary rock, so that the rib cage and the front of

the skull protrude somewhat but the head and neck are

completely underground. The entrance to the shrine is

through the gaping jaws of the enormous skull. Tokens

of  Ios  worship  (metallic  disks  of  different  colors)  are

hung from the great fangs, and a path of glittering coins

is marked down the center of the gullet.

As the dragons  esh decayed, a hollow tunnel was left

through the neck area. The path, studded with glimpses

of vertebrae, continues through the sinuous corridor to

the rib cage.

Shrine

The shrine itself resembles a cathedral, formed by the

natural vault of the rib cage. It is more than 50 feet long,

and the sky is visible between the massive bones. These

openings  ll the shrine with a waxy yellow light during

the day and allow moonlight (when it is present) to silver

the space at night.

In the center of the space is a metallic disk inlaid in

the rock  oor. This forms the worship area and is also

the repository of the Sacred Hoard, which consists of

offerings made by worshipers. Over the millennia, this

hoard has become an impressive heap of coins, gems,

and other valuable objects. Such wealth is irresistible to

temple thieves, so the shrine is always guarded physically

by the clergy of Io as well as by magic wards and traps.

(The DM should place appropriate obstacles along the

way inside the tunnel that leads to the hoard.) In addition,

a descendant of the long-dead gold dragon has her lair

nearby and keeps a watchful eye out against desecration

of her ancestors remains.

ragonblood characters differ from other races in

their particularly potent heritage and the abilities

gained  thereby.  They  are  often  able  to  tap  into

their heritage and become much more dragonlike

through feats and substitution levels.

SKILLS

Dragons and many of their kin are creatures of high intel-

lect,  with  the  capacity  to  learn  many  skills.  They  have

particular af nity for skills based on Charisma. Unique

among the dragonblood races, kobolds have a knack for

mining and trapmaking.

CRAFT (INT)

The crafting talents of kobolds run toward mining and

trapmaking. However, they have also made, or at least

claim to be responsible for, many alchemical advances.

Bitterleaf oil is used throughout kobold society to keep

everyones scales shiny. Some kobold communities use

fire beetle lamps, while sundark goggles are standard

issue for those engaging in daytime raids on the surface.

Ditherbombs represent an inexact advance in the science

of demolitions, but the kobolds see them as a huge step in

both mining and defense.

These items are described in Chapter 8: Equipment.

Try Again: In addition to the normal parameters

of the Craft skill, if you fail a Craft (alchemy) check

to create a ditherbomb by 5 or more, the partially

created ditherbomb explodes, dealing damage as

if it were a completed ditherbomb. The explosion

destroys  the  alchemical  lab  being  used  for  the

dither bombs creation.

HANDLE ANIMAL

(CHA; TRAINED ONLY)

You can use Handle Animal to handle, train, and

rear draconic animals, but since such creatures

are magical beasts, you take a 4 penalty on the

check to do so. Animals and magical beasts with

the half-dragon template cant normally be affected

with this skill. For such creatures, see the Dragon

Trainer feat, page 98.

PROFESSION (WIS)

The most common profession among kobolds is mining.

Mining work involves digging, removing dirt, and build-

ing supports.

Check: A Profession (miner) check can be used to indicate

the progress of mining or digging operations. Excavation

is represented as a  xed number of 5-foot cubes per miner,

based on the Profession (miner) check result of the lead

worker (but not of the overseersee Special). Even a pair

of unskilled miners can remove a 5-foot cube of stone with

8 hours of labor, while reasonably talented workers can

remove twice or even three times as much.

Two Medium miners can work together on a single 5-foot

work on any given 5-foot cube. Up to four Small or smaller

miners can work together on the same 5-foot cube, with

as many as three miners using the aid another action to

assist the lead miners check. Kobolds are an exception to

this rule (see Special, below).

The table above assumes the miners are digging through

sedimentary rock, such as limestone, sandstone, or shale.

Other substances apply a modi er on the check, as shown

on the following table.

Special: Kobolds mine more ef ciently than other Small

creatures. Treat them as Medium creatures for determining

their daily progress, but as Small creatures when determin-

ing how many kobolds can work on a given 5-foot cube.

A weak ditherbomb (see page 122) used in conjunction

with a Profession (miner) check grants a +2 alchemical bonus

on the check. A strong ditherbomb grants a +4 alchemical

bonus, while a wyrm ditherbomb grants a +6 bonus. Using

more than one ditherbomb doesnt add to this bonus.

Action: Not applicable. A single check represents 8

hours of work.

able to qualify for some of the monstrous feats described

in Chapter 2 of Draconomicon.

Many general feats are appropriate for dragonblood

characters, either because of a racial prerequisite or because

the feats rely to some extent on sorcerer or other dragon-

related characteristics. A selection of new general feats is

presented below.

ACCELERATE METAMAGIC

You  can  apply  a  selected  metamagic  feat  to  your  spells

more quickly than normal.

Prerequisites:  Dragonblood  subtype,  Spellcraft  4

ranks, any metamagic feat, ability to spontaneously cast

1st-level spells.

Bene  t: Choose a metamagic feat you know. You can

apply the selected metamagic feat to any spontaneously

cast spell without increasing the casting time.

Normal:  Without  this  feat,  metamagic  spells  with  a

normal casting time of 1 standard action take a full-round

action for spontaneous casters. Metamagic spells with a

casting time of longer than 1 standard action take spon-

taneous casters an extra full-round action to cast.

Special: You can gain Accelerate Metamagic multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat,

it applies to a new metamagic feat.

DRAGON BREATH

You can use your breath weapon as often as a normal dragon.

Prerequisites: Half-dragon, 6 HD, breath weapon.

Benefit: You can use your breath weapon every 1d4

rounds.

Normal:  A  half-dragons  breath  weapon  can  only  be

used once per day.

DRAGON TAIL

Your draconic ancestry manifests as a muscular tail you

can use in combat.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, 1st level only.

Bene  t:  You  have  a  tail  that  you  can  use  to  make  a

secondary  natural  attack  in  combat.  This  attack  deals

bludgeoning  damage  according  to  your  size,  as  shown

on the table below. If you already have a tail slap attack

when you take this feat, use the value from the table or

your existing damage value, whichever is greater.

FEATS

The diversity of dragon-descended creatures allows them

to draw on a wide variety of innate talents to enhance their

performance, whether in combat, spellcasting, or some

other area. A dragon-descended creature might also be

Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at

1st level, during character creation.

DRAGON TRAINER

Your draconic nature gives you special insight into training

dragons and draconic creatures.

DRAGON WINGS

Your draconic ancestry manifests as a pair of wings that

aid your jumps and allow you to glide.

Special: A kobold who selects this feat can instead

reduce the base price by 50% for determining raw materials

and time required to create a mechanical trap.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, 1st level only.

Bene  t: You have wings that aid your jumps, granting

a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks.

In addition, you can use your wings to glide, negating

damage from a fall from any height and allowing 20 feet

of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. You glide at a

speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Even if your

maneuverability improves, you cant hover while gliding.

You cant glide while carrying a medium or heavy load.

If you become unconscious or helpless while in mid-

air, your wings naturally unfurl, and powerful ligaments

stiffen  them.  You

descend  in  a  tight

corkscrew and take

only  1d6  points  of

falling  damage,  no

matter what the actual

distance of the fall.

Special:  Unlike  most

feats, this feat must be taken

at 1st level, during character

creation. A kobold with the

Dragonwrought  feat  can

take this feat at 3rd   level.

DRAGON-

WROUGHT

You  were  born  a  dragon-

wrought kobold, proof of

your races innate con-

nection to dragons.

Prerequisites:

Kobold, 1st level

only.

Benefit:  You  are  a

dragon  wrought  ko-

bold.  Your  type  is

dragon rather than

humanoid, and you

lose the dragonblood

subtype. You retain all your

other subtypes and your kobold ra-

cial traits. Your scales become tinted with a color that

matches that of your draconic heritage. As a dragon, you

are immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects. You have

darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. You gain a

+2 racial bonus on the skill indicated for your draconic

heritage on the table on page 103.

Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st

level, during character creation. Having this feat allows

you to take the Dragon Wings feat at 3rd level.

EXTRAORDINARY TRAPSMITH

You are an expert at constructing mechanical traps.

Prerequisite: Craft (trapmaking) 9 ranks.

Bene  t: When you determine the cost of raw materials

and the time required to create a mechanical trap, reduce

the base price by 25%.

100

HEAVYWEIGHT WINGS

Your  superior  strength  allows  you  to   y  while  heavily

burdened.

Prerequisites: Str 15, Reinforced Wings, wings and a

glide or  y speed.

Bene  t: You can  y with heavy armor or a heavy load.

Your speed is still reduced by encumbrance due to armor

or total weight.

Normal: Flying creatures cant

 y in heavy armor or carrying

a heavy load.

IMPROVED

DRAGON WINGS

Your  draconic  wings  now

grant you  ight.

Prerequisites:

Dragonblood  subtype,

Dragon Wings, 6 HD.

Bene  t: You can  y

at  a  speed  of  30  feet

(average maneuverabil-

ity). You cant  y while

carrying  a  medium  or

heavy load or while fa-

tigued or exhausted.

You can safely  y

for a number of con-

secutive rounds equal

to  your  Constitution

modi er (minimum 1

round).  You  can  exert

yourself to  y for up to

twice as long, but then

youre fatigued at the

end of the  ight. You

are likewise fatigued

after spending a total

of more than 10 minutes

per day  ying. Because you can

glide before, after, and between rounds

of actual  ight, you can remain aloft for extended periods,

even if you can only use  ight for 1 round at a time with-

out becoming fatigued.

When you reach 12 HD, you have enough stamina and

prowess to fly for longer periods. You can  y at a speed

of 30 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires

no more exertion than walking or running.

You can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a

charge, but you must  y a minimum of 30 feet and descend at

least 10 feet. You can make a dive attack only when wielding a

piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage.

You can use the run action while  ying, provided you

 y in a straight line.

A dragonwrought kobold with dragon wings

is revered by his people

KOBOLD ENDURANCE

Thanks to your races determination, you are capable of

amazing feats of strength and stamina.

Prerequisite: Kobold.

Bene t: You gain a +4 bonus on all Strength and Constitu-

tion ability checks, but not on Strength- or Constitution-based

skill checks. You also gain a +4 bonus on the following

checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal

damage, Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage

from hot or cold environments, Fortitude saves made to

resist damage from suffocation, and grapple checks made

to escape a grapple or pin. Also, you can sleep in medium

armor without becoming fatigued.

Normal: A character without this feat who sleeps in

medium armor is automatically fatigued the next day.

Special: A kobold who would gain Endurance as a bonus

feat can choose Kobold Endurance in its place. Kobold Endur-

ance counts as the Endurance feat for the purpose of meeting

a prerequisite for a feat, prestige class, or special ability.

KOBOLD FOE STRIKE

You  are  more  effective  in  combat  against  your  racial

enemies.

Prerequisite: Kobold.

Bene  t: When you hit a dwarf, fey, or gnome with a

melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage if you

 ank the creature, or if it is  at-footed. Creatures immune

to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks are not

subject to this extra damage. Any creature with conceal-

ment is immune to this extra damage.

Special: A kobold  ghter can select Kobold Foe Strike

as one of his  ghter bonus feats.

PRACTICAL METAMAGIC

You  can  apply  a  selected  metamagic  feat  to  your  spells

more easily.

Prerequisites:  Dragonblood  subtype,  Spellcraft  8

ranks, any metamagic feat, ability to spontaneously cast

3rd-level spells.

Bene  t:  Choose  a  metamagic  feat  you  know.  When

applying the chosen metamagic feat to a spontaneously

cast spell, the spell uses a spell slot one level lower than

normal for the applied metamagic feat, to a minimum of

one level higher than a spells normal level. For example,

if you select Practical Metamagic (Empower Spell), you

can apply the Empower Spell feat to any spell by using a

spell slot one level higher rather than two.

Special:  You  can  gain  Practical  Metamagic  multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat,

it applies to a new metamagic feat.

REINFORCED WINGS

You have strengthened the muscles of your wings.

Prerequisites: Str 13, wings and a glide or  y speed.

Bene  t: You can  y in medium armor or with a medium

load. Your speed is still reduced by encumbrance due to

armor or total weight.

Normal: Flying creatures cant  y in medium or heavy

armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

VERSATILE SPELLCASTER

You can use two lower-level spell slots to cast a spell one

level higher.

Prerequisite: Ability to spontaneously cast spells.

Bene  t: You can use two spell slots of the same level to

cast a spell you know that is one level higher. For example,

a sorcerer with this feat can expend two 2nd-level spell

slots to cast any 3rd-level spell he knows.

WYRMGRAFTER [ITEM CREATION]

You can apply draconic grafts to other living creatures or

to yourself.

Prerequisites: Heal 10 ranks, Knowledge (arcana)

5 ranks.

Bene  t: You can create draconic grafts and apply them

to other living creatures or to yourself. Creating a draconic

graft takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price. To create

a graft, you must spend 1/25 of the grafts price in XP and

use up raw materials costing half this price.

Draconic grafts are described beginning on page 126.

BREATH CHANNELING

FEATS

Dragons  and  creatures  of  draconic  heritage  that  have

breath  weapons  can  choose  these  feats,  which  channel

the destructive energy of a breath weapon into some other

magical or supernatural effect. Using a breath channeling

feat requires a creature to activate its breath weapon and

counts as a use of that breath weapon.

ENTANGLING EXHALATION [BREATH]

You can use your breath weapon to create an entangling

mesh of energy.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.

Bene  t: When you use your breath weapon, you can

choose to enmesh all creatures in its area instead of pro-

ducing its normal effect. Your breath weapon deals only

half its normal damage; however, any creature that takes

damage from your breath weapon becomes entangled and

takes an extra 1d6 points of damage, of the same energy

type as normally dealt by your breath weapon, each round

at the start of your turn. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds.

If your breath weapon doesnt deal energy damage,

creatures damaged by the initial breath are still entangled

but dont take additional damage on later rounds.

EXHALED BARRIER [BREATH]

You can use your breath weapon to create a wall of energy.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.

Bene  t: When you use your breath weapon, you can

choose to create a 10-foot-by-10-foot  vertical plane  of

energy instead of producing its normal effect. The opaque

walls near endpoint begins at any corner of your space and

extends in a straight line for 10 feet or until it contacts a

solid surface. The wall lasts for 1d4 rounds. Any creature

passing  through  the  wall  takes  damage  equal  to  that

normally dealt by your breath weapon. If you create the

wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature

takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a

successful Re ex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con

modi er) halves this damage.

If your breath weapon doesnt deal energy damage, the

wall deals  re damage. If your breath weapon doesnt deal

damage, the wall deals 2d6 points of  re damage.

EXHALED IMMUNITY [BREATH]

You can use your breath weapon to grant a willing creature

immunity to energy.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.

Bene  t: When you use your breath weapon, instead

of producing its normal effect, you can choose to grant

one  willing  creature  adjacent  to  you  immunity  to  the

energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon

doesnt deal energy damage, this feat grants immunity

to  re. This immunity lasts for 1d4 rounds. You cant use

this feat on yourself.

EXTRA EXHALATION [BREATH]

You can use your breath weapon one more time per day

than normal.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon

with limited uses per day.

Bene  t: You can use your breath weapon one additional

time per day. The interval you must wait between breaths

is 1d4 rounds.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time

you take it, you can breathe one additional time per day.

FURIOUS INHALATION [BREATH]

While raging, you can use your breath weapon to deal

energy damage with your bite attacks.

Prerequisites: Dragonblood subtype, Con 13, ability

to rage or frenzy, bite attack, breath weapon.

Bene t: When you enter a rage or frenzy, you can channel

one use of your breath weapon inward to add energy damage

to your bite attacks. Activating this ability is a free action; the

effect lasts until your rage ends or until you use your breath

weapon again. While this feat is in effect, your bite attacks

deal an extra 2d6 points of energy damage, matching the

energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon

doesnt deal energy damage, this damage is  re damage.

DRACONIC FEATS

Sorcerers  can  take  draconic  feats  to  gain  abilities  akin

to those of their draconic ancestors. Draconic feats dont

change a creature into something fundamentally differ-

ent, but they can grant or increase capabilities. Anyone

interested in taking draconic feats must take the very  rst

feat in the series: Draconic Heritage.

Many of these feats come from Complete Arcane. They

have been revised to  t with draconic races.

DRACONIC ARCANE GRACE

[DRACONIC]

You can convert some of your arcane spell energy into a

saving throw bonus.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: As an immediate action (see page 122), you can

give up an arcane spell slot to gain a bonus on all saving

throws until the start of your next turn. The bonus equals

the level of the spell slot used. You can declare that you

are using this ability after you have rolled a save, but you

must  do  so  before  the  DM  reveals  whether  the  saving

throw succeeded or failed.

DRACONIC BREATH [DRACONIC]

You can convert some of your arcane spell energy into a

breath weapon.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene t: As a standard action, you can convert an arcane

spell slot into a breath weapon. The breath weapon is a 30-

foot cone (cold or  re) or a 60-foot line (acid or electricity)

that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell slot you

expended to create the effect. Any creature in the area can

make a Re ex save (DC 10 + level of the spell used + your Cha

modi er) for half damage. This is a supernatural ability.

Special: If the breath weapon of your draconic forebears

does not deal acid, cold, electricity, or  re damage, you choose

from among the four energy types mentioned above.

DRACONIC CLAW [DRACONIC]

You develop natural weapons like those of your draconic

ancestors.

Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: You gain a claw attack. You can make a natural

attack with two claws, dealing damage based on your size

as  if  you  were  truly  a  dragon  (Small  1d4,  Medium  1d6,

Large  1d8).  In  any  round  when  you  cast  a  spell  with  a

casting time of 1 standard action, you can make a single

claw attack at your full attack bonus as a swift action (see

page 122) against an opponent you threaten.

DRACONIC FLIGHT [DRACONIC]

The  secret  of  draconic   ight  has  been  revealed  to  you,

granting you the ability to  y occasionally.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: After you cast an arcane spell with a casting

time of 1 standard action, you gain a  y speed equal to 10

feet per level of the spell you just cast for the remainder

of your turn.

DRACONIC HERITAGE [DRACONIC]

You have a greater connection with your draconic blood-

line than others of your kind.

Prerequisite: Sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: You gain the dragonblood subtype. Choose one

kind of dragon from the list in the accompanying table.

This is your draconic heritage, which can only be changed

by undergoing the Rite of Draconic Af nity (see page 59).

Half-dragons must choose the same dragon kind as their

dragon parent.

When you declare your draconic heritage, you gain

the skill indicated on the table as a sorcerer class skill. In

addition, you gain a bonus equal to the number of draconic

feats you have on saving throws against magic sleep and

paralysis effects, as well as on saves against spells and

abilities with a descriptor that matches the corresponding

entry in the accompanying table.

found in the Monster Manual. See below for details.

Draconic Heritage for All True Dragons

The  table  above  provides  the  bene ts  of  the  Draconic

Heritage feat for all the kinds of true dragons published

in D&D products to date.

Many of the draconic bloodlines listed on the table dont

grant a bonus on saves against effects of a particular energy

type. Instead, you gain a bonus on saves against spells and

abilities associated with the effect (such as force for the

Tarterian dragon) or subschool (such as compulsion for the

chaos dragon) that matches the entry on the table, as well

as the normal bonus provided by the feat against magic

sleep and paralysis effects.

Special: A character who chooses yu lung as his draconic

heritage can, when he selects another draconic feat, choose

to change his draconic heritage to any other lung dragon

(chiang lung, li lung, lung wang, pan lung, shen lung, tien

lung, or tun mi lung). Once this choice is made,

it can only be changed by undergoing the Rite

of Draconic Af nity (see page 59).

DRACONIC LEGACY

[DRACONIC]

You have realized greater arcane power through

your draconic heritage.

Prerequisites: Any four draconic feats.

Bene  t: Based on your draconic heritage, add

the spells noted on the accompanying table to

your list of spells known. Each spell is added

at the spell level where a spellcaster normally

gains it unless otherwise indicated.

Special: With your DMs permission, you

can choose a draconic legacy associated

with a kind of dragon not found in the

Monster Manual. See the table on page

103 for details.

DRACONIC PERSUASION

[DRACONIC]

Your  arcane  talents  lend  you  a  great  deal  of

allure.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer

level 1st.

Bene  t: After you cast an arcane spell, you

gain a bonus equal to 1-1/2 times the spells

level on your next Bluff, Intimidate, or Perform

check. The check must be made before the end

of the next round.

DRACONIC POWER

[DRACONIC]

You have greater power when manipulating

the energies of your heritage.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer

level 1st.

Bene t: Your caster level increases by one,

and you add 1 to the save DC of all arcane

spells with the descriptor or subschool

associated with your draconic heritage.

Special: This feat works in conjunction

with the Energy Substitution feat (Complete

Arcane, page 79) as long as the substituted

energy matches the energy type associ-

ated with your draconic heritage.

DRACONIC PRESENCE

[DRACONIC]

When you use your magic, your mere presence

can terrify those around you.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer

level 1st.

Bene  t: Whenever you cast an arcane spell,

opponents within 10 feet of and with fewer Hit

Dice than you become shaken for a number of

rounds equal to the level of the spell you cast. A

Will save (DC 10 + level of the spell cast + your

Cha modi er) negates the effect. A successful save

indicates that the opponent is immune to your

draconic presence for 24 hours. This ability does not affect

creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or creatures that

are already shaken, nor does it have any effect on dragons.

DRACONIC RESISTANCE [DRACONIC]

Your bloodline hardens your body against effects related

to the nature of your progenitor.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: You gain resistance to the energy type associ-

ated with your draconic heritage equal to three times the

number  of  draconic  feats  you  have,  including  draconic

feats you take after gaining this feat.

Special: This feat grants no bene t to a character whose

draconic heritage is not associated with an energy type,

such as a sorcerer with pan lung heritage.

DRACONIC SKIN [DRACONIC]

Your skin takes on a sheen, luster, and hardness related to

your draconic ancestor.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: Your natural armor bonus increases by 1.

DRACONIC TOUGHNESS [DRACONIC]

Your draconic nature reinforces your body as you embrace

your heritage.

Prerequisites: Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Bene  t: When you take this feat, you gain 2 hit points for

each draconic feat you have, including this one. Whenever

you take a new draconic feat, you gain 2 more hit points.

TACTICAL FEATS

Tactical feats were introduced in Complete Warrior. They

allow characters to perform a number of powerful attacks

by  rst taking prescribed actions to set up the maneuver. It

is up to you to keep track of those actions and to inform the

DM that you are preparing to execute a tactical maneuver.

See page 108 of Complete Warrior for more information.

SPELL REHEARSAL [TACTICAL]

Casting the same spell several times in a row or at the same

target enables you to perfect it.

Prerequisite: Caster level 1st.

Bene  t: The Spell Rehearsal feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers. You can only apply one maneuver at a

time to a single spell.

Persistence: To use this maneuver, you must cast a speci c

spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be

one that allows affected creatures or objects a saving throw.

You can take a move action after casting the spell once before

casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard

actions between successive castings. On the second and

subsequent times you cast the spell, you add a cumulative

+1 to the spells save DC. If you cast any other spell after

starting to use this feat or take any other standard action,

the persistence chain breaks and you must begin anew.

Re ned Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a

speci c spell two or more times in succession, and the spell

must be one that requires an attack roll to affect a target. You

can take a move action after casting the spell once before

casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard

actions between successive castings. On the second and

subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you

gain a cumulative +2 enhancement bonus on the attack roll

to deliver the spell. If you cast any spell that does not require

an attack roll or take any other standard action, the re ned

targeting chain breaks and you must begin anew.

Persistent Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a

speci c spell two or more times in succession, and the spell

must be one that allows a target to apply spell resistance to

the effect. You can take a move action after casting the spell

once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other

standard actions between successive castings. On the second

and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target,

you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the

targets spell resistance. If you cast any other spell or take

any other standard action, the persistent targeting chain

breaks and you must begin anew.

Special: This bene t applies to spells you know or have

prepared as well as spells cast from items such as wands

and scrolls.

WING EXPERT [TACTICAL]

You can use your wings to create a variety of effects.

Prerequisites: Flyby Attack, wings and a glide or

fly speed.

Bene  t: The Wing Expert feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers.

Wing Buffet: To use this maneuver, you must charge an

opponent. On the round after the charge, you can  utter

your wings in a distracting manner while you make a melee

attack or attacks against the same opponent you charged.

If that opponent fails a DC 20 Re ex save, you gain a +2

bonus for your turn on your melee attack rolls against the

distracted opponent. You cannot make a wing buffet again

until after you make another charge.

Wing Defense: To use this maneuver, you must have taken

the total defense action. On the round after doing so, if you

do not use your wings to  y, you can  utter your wings in

such a way as to gain concealment for the round.

Wing Fan: To use this maneuver, you must have used at

least one move action in the previous round to  y or glide

at least 30 feet. As a full-round action in the next round, you

can use your wings to produce an effect identical to a gust

of wind spell with a range of 30 feet. Using this maneuver

makes you fatigued. You cannot use this maneuver if you

are exhausted.

RACIAL SUBSTITUTION

LEVELS

A substitution level is a level of a given class that you take

instead of the level described for the standard class. Selecting

a substitution level is not the same as multiclassingyou

remain within the class for which the substitution level is

taken. The class features of the substitution level simply

replace those of the standard classs level.

To qualify to take a racial substitution level, you must be

of the proper race. For instance, to select a kobold rogue

racial substitution level, you must be a kobold.

10/25/05   12:17:13 PM

generalhas racial substitution levels. Essentially, each

set of substitution levels presents a racially  avored variant

standard class for your game. The DM can add more racial

substitution level options, such as for a dragonborn barbar-

ian or a kobold druid, as desired, using the substitution

levels presented here as guidelines.

You can usually select a particular substitution level only at a

speci c class level. When you take a substitution level for your

class at a given level, you give up the standard class features

gained at that level and get the substitution level features

instead. You cant go back and gain the class features for the

level you swapped outwhen you take your next level in the

standard class, you gain the class features of the next higher

level as if you had gained the previous level normally.

For instance, if you take the dragonborn paladin substitu-

tion level for 5th level, you forever lose the class features

normally gained by a standard 5th-level paladin, gaining

instead the racial substitution class features for a 5th-level

dragonborn paladin. When you take the next level in pala-

din, you gain the normal 6th-level bene ts of the standard

paladin class.

Unless noted otherwise in the description of a racial sub-

stitution level class feature, a character who takes a racial

substitution level gains spellcasting ability (increases in

spells per day, caster level, and spells known, if applicable)

as if he had taken a level in the standard class.

A  character  need  not  take  all  the  substitution  levels

provided for a class. For example, a spellscale bard might

decide to take only the racial substitution level for 1st level,

ignoring the other substitution levels.

The description of each substitution level class feature

explains what occurs with regard to a standard class ability

not gained, if that ability would normally increase at a speci c

rate (such as a dragonborn paladins base attack bonus).

When a substitution level changes the standard classs Hit

Die or class skill list, the change applies only to that substitu-

tion level, not to any other class levels. A character who takes

the kobold rogue substitution level as a beginning character

gains 4 hit points (from the substitution levels d4 Hit Die) and

gains an additional 1d4 hit points for each additional kobold

rogue substitution level he takes later in his career. He gains

the normal d6 Hit Die for all standard rogue levels.

DRAGONBLOOD CLERIC

Dragonblood creatures are naturally inclined toward arcane

magic. Some hear the call of a deity, however, and become

clerics instead. Dragonblood clerics focus on the elemental

af nities of their draconic bloodline.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To take a dragonblood cleric substitution level, a character

must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to take

her 1st, 5th, or 9th level of cleric.

Class Skills

Dragonblood cleric substitution levels have the class skills

of the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are class features of the dragonblood

cleric racial substitution levels.

Notes: The following substitution level class features

require the dragonblood cleric to select one energy type

from among acid, cold, electricity,  re, and sonic. The energy

type must be the same for all these substitution features.

A half-dragon who takes one or more of these substitu-

tion levels must choose the energy type that matches her

breath weapon (if possible). If a half-dragon clerics breath

weapon doesnt have an energy type, she can choose any

energy type so long as it is the same for all substitution

level class features.

A dragonblood cleric who doesnt take the 1st-level racial

substitution level can expend turn undead uses in place

of turn energy uses if she takes the 5th- or 9th-level racial

substitution levels.

Turn Energy (Su): Starting at 1st level, a dragonblood

cleric can channel the elemental power of dragons to grant

her and her allies protection from energy a number of times

per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modi er.

Using this ability is a standard action that does not pro-

voke attacks of opportunity. The cleric and all allies within

30 feet gain temporary immunity to the speci ed energy

type. Each protected ally remains immune until the effect

protects him from 5 points of energy damage per cleric

level, after which the effect is discharged for that ally. If

it is not discharged, the bene t of the effect fades after 1

minute per cleric level. The cleric can exclude herself and

any allies she chooses from the effect.

Turn energy overlaps and does not stack with the effect

of the resist energy spell. If a character is warded by both

this effect and resist energy, this effect absorbs damage until

it is discharged. Turn energy stacks with the effect of the

protection from energy spell.

This substitution level class feature replaces the stan-

dard clerics turn or rebuke undead class feature. For a

dragonblood cleric, turn energy counts as turn or rebuke

undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats,

prestige classes, and so on.

Energy Barrier (Su): A dragonblood cleric who takes

the 5th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her

turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to create a

wall of energy. This ability functions like the bene t of the

Exhaled Barrier feat (see page 101), except as noted below.

Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of

energy damage per two cleric levels the dragonblood cleric

possesses. If the cleric creates the wall so that it appears where

creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through

the wall. Either way, a successful Re ex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the

clerics class level + her Con modi er) halves this damage.

This substitution feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot

gained by a standard cleric at 5th level. From 5th level on,

a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can

prepare one less 3rd-level spell per day than shown on

Table 36 (PH 31).

Energy Sustenance (Su): A dragonblood cleric who

takes the 9th-level racial substitution level can expend

one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day

to gain the bene t of energy sustenance. The energy type

selected for this ability can now heal the cleric.

To  use  energy  sustenance,  the  cleric  expends  a  turn

energy use as an immediate action when she is subjected

to  an  attack  that  deals  energy  damage  of  the  speci ed

type. If she does so, she heals 1 point of damage for every

3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the

amount of healing would cause the cleric to exceed her

full normal hit points, she gains any excess as temporary

hit points that last for up to 1 hour. When a dragonblood

cleric uses this ability, she willingly fails any saving throw

against the incoming energy effect.

This substitution feature replaces the 5th-level spell slot

gained by a standard cleric at 9th level. From 9th level on,

a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can

prepare one less 5th-level spell per day than shown on Table

36 (PH 31).

DRAGONBLOOD SORCERER

Kobolds, spellscales, and the members of other dragon-

blood races tap into their innate draconic talents to achieve

greater heights of sorcerous power. Forgoing any pretense

of mundane pursuits, a dragonblood sorcerer explores new

approaches to casting arcane spells.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take a dragonblood sorcerer substitution level, a char-

acter must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to

take his 1st, 4th, or 7th level of sorcerer.

Class Skills

Dragonblood  sorcerer  substitution  levels  have  the  class

skills of the standard sorcerer class, minus Craft and Pro-

fession, plus Use Magic Device. In addition, a dragonblood

sorcerer who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level

gains a class skill from his Draconic Heritage feat.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  dragonblood

sorcerer racial substitution levels.

Arcane Insight (Ex): A 1st-level dragonblood sorcerers

racial talent with magic grants him keen insights into arcane

mysteries.  Each  time  he  selects  a  dragonblood  sorcerer

substitution level, he gains a cumulative +2 insight bonus

on Knowledge (arcana) checks.

Draconic Heritage: A 1st-level dragonblood sorcerer

gains Draconic Heritage as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerers

familiar class feature.

Spell-Like Ability: A dragonblood sorcerer who takes

the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to

transform a sorcerer spell he knows into a spell-like ability.

A spell chosen for this ability cant have a costly material

component, an XP cost, or any sort of focus, and it cant be

a spell of the highest level the sorcerer can cast. The chosen

spell is removed from the sorcerers list of spells known,

reducing his number of known spells of that level by one,

and the sorcerer loses one spell slot of that spell levelas

well as one spell slot from the next higher level of spells he

is able to cast. In return for those two spell slots, he gains

the ability to use the chosen spell as a spell-like ability three

times per day, using his sorcerer level as the caster level.

Each time a dragonblood sorcerer who has this substitu-

tion level feature gains access to a new spell level, he can

exchange the spell chosen for this ability for a new one.

He returns the previously chosen spell to his list of spells

known and regains both lost spell slots. He then chooses a

new spell, subject to the limitations given above. He loses

that spell from his spells known list along with one spell

slot of the newly chosen spells level and a spell slot one

level higher than the chosen spell.

Bonus Spells Known: A dragonblood sorcerer who takes

the 7th-level racial substitution level adds four spells to his

list of known sorcerer spells. The spells added depend on the

dragonblood sorcerers alignment or draconic heritage.

A dragonblood sorcerer who is good-aligned must choose

the good list of known spells, and vice versa. One descended

from a particular kind of dragon is treated as if he shared

that dragons alignment for the purpose of this substitution

feature, regardless of his own alignment. For example, a

half-red dragon sorcerer, or a sorcerer with Draconic Heri-

tage (red dragon), is treated as evil-aligned for determining

which bonus spells known he gains. Dragonblood sorcerers

who are neither good nor evil and have no distinct draconic

heritage can choose which set of spells to add.

If a dragonblood sorcerer already knows any of the listed

spells,  he  can  pick  another  spell  that  a  sorcerer  would

ordinarily have available at that same level.

Evil:  1stcharm  person;  2nddarkness,  resist  energy;

3rdsuggestion.

Good: 1stbless; 2ndfog cloud, resist energy; 3rd y.

The chosen list of spells known replaces the normal addi-

tions to the sorcerers list of spells known (one 1st-level spell,

one 2nd-level spell, one 3rd-level spell) gained at 7th level.

DRAGONBORN PALADIN

Lawful good dragonborn often become paladins. The

class is in harmony with their dedicated nature to sanctify

themselves through honorable service in the Dragonfall

War. Many of the paladins abilities make a dragonborn

character extraordinarily well suited for fighting the

spawn of Tiamat.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

A dragonborn paladin normally takes substitution levels at

1st level and when she would take her 4th and 5th paladin

levels. However, a paladin who becomes a dragonborn

later in her career can choose to retroactively take any or

all dragonborn paladin substitution levels as replacements

for class levels she has already gained.

Class Skills

Dragonborn paladin substitution levels have the class skills

of the standard paladin class, plus Knowledge (arcana).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are class features of the dragonborn

paladin racial substitution levels.

Detect  Dragonblood  (Sp):  A  1st-level  dragonborn

paladin can use detect dragonblood at will. This is a divina-

tion effect similar to a detect evil spell, except that it detects

dragonblood creatures of any alignment. A dragonborn

paladin can scan a 60-degree arc each round. By concen-

trating for 1 round, she knows if any dragonblood creatures

are within the arc; concentrating for 2 rounds reveals the

exact  number  of  such  creatures;  and  concentrating  for

3 rounds reveals their exact locations. This ability is the

equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladins

detect evil class feature.

Bahamuts Blessing (Su): At 4th level, a dragonborn

paladin who uses her smite evil ability against evil dragons

and dragonbloods gains an additional +2 bonus on the

attack roll. She also deals 1 extra point of damage per

two paladin levels. For example, a 13th-level dragonborn

paladin with a 20 Strength and armed with a +2 longsword

deals 1d8+26 points of damage when using smite evil

against an evil dragonblood (+13 from normal smite evil,

+6 from Bahamuts blessing, + 5 from Str, and +2 from

the longsword).

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladins

turn undead ability.

Fearless Special Mount (Sp): A 5th-level dragonborn

paladins special mount is immune to the frightful presence

of dragons, in addition to having the standard qualities of

a special mount.

This substitution feature replaces the improvement in

base attack bonus normally gained by a 5th-level paladin.

From 5th level on, a dragonborn paladins base attack bonus

is 1 lower than that of a standard paladin of her level.

KOBOLD FIGHTER

Kobold  ghters train to master the use of the spear, the

traditional weapon of kobolds. They forego learning how to

use some armor in exchange for learning to dodge attacks.

Kobold  ghters exercise arduously throughout their careers,

striving to overcome some of the physical de ciencies they

inherit as kobolds.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a kobold  ghter substitution level, a character must be

a kobold about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 4th level of  ghter.

Class Skills

Kobold fighter substitution levels have the class skills

of the standard fighter class, plus Profession (miner)

and Search.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are class features of the kobold  ghter

racial substitution levels.

Spear  Focus  (Ex):  A  1st-level  kobold   ghter  focuses

his combat talents on spear  ghting. He gains a +1 bonus

on  attack  rolls  with  the  following  weapons:  longspear,

shortspear, and spear. At the DMs option, this bonus might

also apply to other spearlike weapons.

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon

Focus, but it is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus

for  qualifying  for  feats,  prestige  classes,  and  anything

else that requires that feat. A kobold  ghter who has this

ability could take Weapon Specialization (spear) without

selecting Weapon Focus (spear) as a separate feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard  ghters

1st-level bonus feat and medium armor pro ciency.

Dodge (Ex): A kobold  ghter who takes the 1st-level

racial substitution level gains Dodge as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard  ghters

heavy armor pro ciency.

Constitution Boost (Ex): At 2nd level, a kobold  ghter

increases his Constitution score by 2 points.

This substitution feature replaces the standard  ghters

bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

Strength Boost (Ex): A kobold  ghter who takes the

4th-level racial substitution level increases his Strength

score by 2 points.

This substitution feature replaces the standard  ghters

bonus feat gained at 4th level.

KOBOLD RANGER

Kobold rangers are not deterred by their size, forging lifelong

relationships with their preferred dire weasel companions,

who more than make up for their masters physical short-

comings. A kobold ranger is a sentinel for her tribe, riding

the fringes of her lands in search of enemies and threats.

Nothing slows a kobold ranger in pursuit of prey.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To take a kobold ranger substitution level, a character must

be a kobold about to take her 1st, 4th, or 7th level of ranger.

Class Skills

Kobold ranger substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard ranger class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are class features of the kobold ranger

racial substitution levels.

Kobold Favored Enemy (Ex): A kobold ranger who takes

the 1st-level racial substitution level gains the normal ranger

favored enemy bonus on checks and damage rolls, but the skills

affected by the bonus are Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot,

and Survival instead of those given for the standard ranger.

If a kobold ranger selects fey, humanoid (dwarf), or human-

oid (gnome) as her favored enemy, she gains a +3 bonus

against the chosen creature type instead of the standard +2.

Bonuses against such creatures also increase by 3 every

time the kobold ranger gains a new favored enemy, instead

of the standard +2 increase.

This substitution feature replaces but is otherwise iden-

tical to the standard rangers favored enemy class feature

(PH 47).

Dire Weasel Companion (Ex): A kobold ranger who

takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains a dire weasel

animal companion. This ability functions like the druids

animal companion ability, treating the kobold rangers

effective druid level as half her ranger level, instead of half

her ranger level 3. A kobold ranger cannot select from an

alternative list of animal companions; she is restricted to

choosing a dire weasel as her animal companion.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rangers

animal companion class feature.

A kobold ranger who takes this substitution level gains

Track as a bonus feat and the wild empathy ability (PH 47),

just as a standard ranger does.

Kobold Ranger Spells: A kobold ranger who takes the

4th-level racial substitution level replaces certain spells on

her ranger spell list with kobold alternatives. For 1st-level

ranger spells, steal size* replaces entangle. A kobold ranger

also exchanges the 2nd-level ranger spells speak with plants

and spike growth for local tremor* and soften earth and stone.

She replaces the 3rd-level ranger spells command plants,

diminish plants, plant growth, and tree shape with meld into

stone, spike stones, stone shape, and stoneskin. Stone tell replaces

the 4th-level ranger spell tree stride.

New spells described in Chapter 7.

Subterranean Stride (Ex): A kobold ranger who takes

the 7th-level racial substitution level can move across

dense rubble or natural stone  oors at her normal speed,

ignoring any effects related to terrain (DMG 60). However,

a rock surface that is enchanted or magically manipulated

to impede motion still affects her.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rangers

woodland stride class feature.

KOBOLD ROGUE

Kobold rogues pride themselves on their comprehensive

understanding of trap dynamics. Trapmaking is an art,

a passion, and a racial pastime. Many kobolds dabble in

trapmaking, and kobold rogues who do so gain additional

insights into dealing with such devices. Kobold rogues

are notoriously cowardly and fragile, however, and greatly

prefer stealth and retreat over face-to-face con ict.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take a kobold rogue substitution level, a character

must be a kobold about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 8th level

of rogue.

Class Skills

Kobold rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard rogue class, plus Knowledge (dungeoneering).

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are class features of the kobold rogue

racial substitution levels.

Rapid Retreat (Ex): A kobold rogue who takes the

1st-level racial substitution level gains the ability to retreat

quickly from dangerous situations. Any time a kobold rogue

with this substitution feature uses the withdraw action,

she gains a 5-foot bonus to her speed.

Shrewd Trap  nding (Ex): Starting at 1st level, each

time a kobold rogue takes a substitution level, she gains

Evasive skitter, shrewd trapfinding +6

a cumulative +2 competence bonus on Search checks to

 nd traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm traps.

This bonus is lost if the kobold rogue does not have a

number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to or greater

than her rogue class level.

This substitution feature alters but does not replace the

standard rogues trap nding class feature.

Improved Trap Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, a kobold rogue

gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps.

This is the same as the rogues trap sense class feature, except

that the bonus granted on Re ex saves and to AC is +2 instead

of +1. A kobold rogues trap sense continues to improve at

the normal rate (to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 9th, and so on).

This extra bonus is lost, reducing the kobold rogues trap

sense bonus to the normal rogue value if the kobold rogue

does not have a number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to

or greater than her rogue class level. This substitution feature

augments the standard rogues trap sense class feature.

Evasive Skitter (Ex): A kobold rogue who takes the

8th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to move

out of the area of dangerous spells and effects. A kobold

rogue  who  succeeds  on  a  Re ex  save  against  a  spell  or

effect  gains  the  normal  bene t  for  the  successful  save,

and she can choose to move out of the area of the spell or

effect. She must take the shortest path available to her, and

she cant move farther than her speed. If more than one

path of equal distance is available, she can choose which

path to use. If no such path is available, the kobold rogue

cant use this ability. This movement provokes attacks of

opportunity as normal for movement.

Example: A kobold rogue with a speed of 30 feet is within

the area of a  reball spell. She successfully saves against the

spell, so she takes no damage from the blast and can move

out of the spells area by the shortest route available.

This substitution feature replaces the standard 8th-level

rogues improved uncanny dodge class feature.

SPELLSCALE BARD

Despite their inclination for sorcery, spellscales make excel-

lent bards, exploiting their racial af nity for arcane magic

and superior charm. However, knowledge of arcane mysteries

remains an important part of a spellscale bards abilities.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a spellscale bard substitution level, a character must

be a spellscale about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 6th level of bard.

Table 612: Spellscale Bard Racial Substitution Levels

Class Skills

Spellscale bard substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard bard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the spellscale bard racial

substitution levels.

Draconic Bardic Knowledge (Ex): A spellscale bard has

special interest in events, items, and individuals important

to dragons. Upon taking the 1st-level racial substitution

level, a spellscale bards keen interest in dragon lore grants

him a +5 competence bonus on any bardic knowledge check

related to dragons, so long as he maintains a number of

ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his

bard class level.

Inspire Arcana (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a spellscale

bard can spend one daily use of bardic music to make a

single allied arcane spellcaster more powerful. To use

this ability, a spellscale bard must have 3 or more ranks

in Perform and a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana)

equal to or greater than his bard class level. The ally must

be within 30 feet of and able to see and hear the spellscale

bard, and the bard must be able to see the ally. As long as

the chosen arcane spellcaster continues to hear the bards

performance, she casts her arcane spells with a +1 bonus

to her caster level. The effect lasts as long as the spellscale

bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard

cant inspire arcana upon himself. Inspire arcana is a mind-

affecting ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard bards

inspire competence class feature.

Superior Suggestion (Sp): A spellscale bard who

takes the 6th-level racial substitution level draws on his

knowledge of his sorcerous ancestors to enhance his

suggestion ability. So long as he maintains a number of

ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than

his bard class level, a spellscale bard gains a +2 bonus

on the save DC whenever he uses his suggestion bardic

music ability.

This substitution feature augments the standard bards

suggestion class feature, and it replaces the 2nd-level spell

slot gained by a standard bard at 6th level. From 6th level

on, a spellscale bard who takes this substitution level can

cast one less 2nd-level spell per day than shown on Table

34 (PH 27).

embers of the dragonkind races are the

ultimate sorcerers and magic users. True

dragons gain spellcasting power as they

age, for example, and spellscales have a

natural aptitude for sorcery. Dragonblood

creatures use existing spells and create new ones to suit

their needs. The wings of cover spell and its kin are a  ne

example of how dragonkind adapts and improves magic

to advance its own purposes.

CREATE TRAP

Conjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: One trap; see text

Duration: 12 hours

Saving Throw: No

Spell Resistance: No

You throw a small gear, and when it hits

the ground a trap springs up at the place

you designate.

You create a CR 1 trap selected from

the following list: basic arrow trap,

fusillade of darts, scything blade trap,

or spear trap (DMG 7071). You can

locate  the  5-foot-by-5-foot  trigger

112

in any square of your choice within

the range of this spell. Once create

trap  is  cast,  the  trap  is  active  and

ready to be sprung, with every design

feature installed.

Material Component: A miniature

bronze gear.

ESSENCE OF THE

DRAGON

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer 2

Components: S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Willing living creature

touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

SPELL DESCRIPTIONS

With the touch of your bloodied hand, your

allys appearance shifts. Her eyes become

slitted,  and  a  shimmer  of  scales  ghosts

momentarily across her skin.

You confer the dragon type on the

touched creature. For the duration

of the spell, that creature counts as

a  dragon  for  the  purpose  of  spell

effects, magic item wielder require-

ments,  favored  enemy  bonuses,

and  other  factors  that  depend  on  a

creatures type.

The subject of the spell is immune

to  magic  sleep  and  paralysis  effects

and ignores the frightful presence of

dragons. The recipient also receives

darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light

vision.  It  is  also  now  vulnerable  to

harmful effects that specify dragons,

such as dragon bane weapons.

Material Component: A drop of blood

from a dragon or dragon-descended

creature.

GHOSTLY RELOAD

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Hand, light, or heavy

crossbow

Duration: 1 hour or until

expended; see text

Saving Throw: No

Spell Resistance: No

Shimmering ghostly hands pull your

crossbows string back into the catch as

you prepare to  re another bolt.

After the wielder shoots a projectile

from the crossbow affected by this

spell, the magic immediately cocks

the crossbow so that the weapon can

be loaded again.

Ghostly  reload  pulls  the  string  of

a hand crossbow or light crossbow

into place once per caster level (maxi-

mum ten times at caster level 10th)

and the string of a heavy crossbow

into place once per two caster levels

(maximum  ve times at caster level

10th). Cumulative castings of ghostly

reload do not stack.

This spell allows the crossbows

wielder  to  fire  a  light  crossbow

or  heavy  crossbow  as  a  standard

action and move in the same round.

If  the  character  benefits  from  a

high base attack bonus, the cross-

bow  can  be  fired  multiple  times

as a full attack, but only if ghostly

reload can be applied to each attack

in that round.

Focus: A crossbow.

GHOSTLY TAIL

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: Evoked tail

Duration: 1 hour/level

A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils

from behind you, as if it had always been

there, and slaps at foes that leave them-

selves open to attack.

You  evoke  a  partially  translucent,

scaled tail that can attack foes that are

vulnerable to attacks of opportunity.

If your foe takes an action that would

provoke  an  attack  of  opportunity

from you, even if you are not holding

a  melee  weapon  that  would  nor-

mally threaten your foe, your evoked

dragons tail attacks the target with a

melee touch attack, dealing 2d6 points

of damage on a successful hit. You can

only strike with a ghostly tail if you

have not already taken your allowed

number of attacks of opportunity in

the round.

Special: A dragonblooded character,

or a character with the dragon type,

deals an extra 1 point of damage per

level with a ghostly tail (maximum

20 points).

GNOME BLIGHT

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./

level)

Area: Cloud spreads in 20-ft.

radius, 20 ft. high

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates;

see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You blow a mixture of pollen and ground

mandrake root from your palm toward

the targeted area. The granules are car-

ried by a directed wind and explode into

a cloud of yellow dust and seed.

Gnome  blight  creates  a  thick  cloud

of agonizingly itchy pollen similar

to that created by fog cloud, except

that the pollen is sickening. Living

creatures in the cloud become sick-

ened.  This  condition  lasts  as  long

as a creature is in the cloud and for

1d4+1  rounds  after  it  leaves.  (Roll

separately  for  each  sickened  indi-

vidual.) Any creature that succeeds

on its save but remains in the cloud

must continue to save each round

on your turn.

Creatures with sensitive olfactory

senses (such as gnomes or creatures

with the scent ability) take a 4 pen-

alty on their saving throws.

Material Component: Flower pollen

and ground mandrake root.

HOARD LIFE

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Sorcerer 4

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Personal and touch

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

You clasp your hands around a gem. A

 ash goes off, and then a feeling of deep

weariness passes through you. The gem

now bears a spark of light within it.

Although  true  healing  magic  is

usually the province of the divine,

dragon  sorcerers  have  devised  an

arcane method of creating a reserve

of health for use in emergencies. This

spell siphons off hit points from the

caster and temporarily stores them

in a gem for later retrieval.

When you cast this spell, you deal

nonlethal damage equal to twice your

caster level to yourself, and you become

fatigued. (If you are immune to non-

lethal damage, this spell automatically

fails.) At any point during the spells

duration, you can use a standard action

while holding the gem to heal yourself

of an amount of damage equal to the

nonlethal damage the spell dealt to

you. This healing cant cause you to

exceed your full normal hit points; any

healing in excess of this amount is lost.

Triggering this effect ends the spells

duration (so you cant portion out the

healing over multiple uses). Triggering

the healing does not provoke attacks

of opportunity.

If  the  spells  duration  elapses

before you have triggered the heal-

ing, you gain no benefit from the

spell. Casting this spell a second time

automatically ends the duration of

any previous casting of the spell that

you have performed.

Focus: A gem worth at least 50 gp.

Special: A dragonblooded character,

or a character with the dragon type,

casts this spell at +1 caster level.

As you spin around, you produce residual

images of yourself, each of which splits off

from your body and moves away.

One  or  more  illusory  doubles  of

you appear, spinning off from your

original  location  as  you  turn  in  a

circle. You create one double plus

one for every four caster levels you

have  (minimum  one,  maximum

five). You are then free to go else-

where  while  your  doubles  move

away in a manner of your choosing.

The  doubles  move  at  your  speed

and  can  emit  minor  sounds  such

as footsteps or metal clanking, but

they  can  only  be  made  to  move,

withdraw, or run.

Any  successful  attack  against  an

illusory double destroys it. A doubles

Armor Class is equal to 10 + your

size modifier + your Dex modifier.

Figments seem to react normally to

area spells (such as looking as though

they are burned or dead after being

hit by a  reball).

LOCAL TREMOR

Evocation [Earth]

Level: Cleric 2, druid 2, sorcerer/

wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 30 ft.

Area: 30-ft. line

Duration: 1 minute/level or until

expended; see text

Saving Throw: Re ex negates

Spell Resistance: No

The  earth  around  your  feet  begins  to

ripple, and a directed shock wave of tec-

tonic force is released that shoots through

the ground.

Immediately upon completion of the

casting of this spell and as often as

once  per  round  thereafter,  you  can

cause the ground to shake along a 30-

foot line. You can produce a number

of these tremors equal to your caster

level (maximum  ve).

The tremors begin at your location

and extend in the direction you in-

dicate; any creature caught standing

within the area must make a Re ex

save  or  fall  prone.  A  spellcaster

caught  standing  on  one  of  these

squares must make a Concentration

check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any

spell that was being attempted.

With a shuddering gasp, you dig your

nails into your  esh as though pulling

the skin from your bones. A glistening

wyvern appears before you.

This spell creates a wyvern that springs

forth from your body. It appears where

you designate and acts immediately, on

your turn. It attacks your opponents to

the best of its ability. You must be able

to speak Draconic to communicate

with the wyvern, or have some form

of telepathic communication that does

not require a shared language. If you

can communicate with the wyvern,

you  can  direct  it  not  to  attack,  to

attack particular enemies, or to per-

form other actions.

The conjured creature gains bonus

your opponents to the best of its ability.

If you can communicate with the aspect

(it understands Celestial, Common,

and Draconic), you can direct it not

to attack, to attack particular enemies,

or to perform other actions before the

duration elapses. More information on

the aspect of Bahamut can be found

on page 152 of this book.

Arcane Focus: A silver dragon scale.

TAIL SLAP

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 2

Components: V, S

118

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: Evoked tail

Duration: 1 round/level

A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils

from  behind  you  and  savagely  slaps  at

your foe.

You  evoke  a  dragons  tail  that  you

can use to strike at a target once per

round as a standard action (including

the round in which you evoke it) that

deals 1d6 points of damage per two

levels (to a maximum of 10d6 points

of damage) if you hit your foe with a

melee touch attack.

In  addition,  if  a  subject  of  up  to

one  size  category  larger  than  you

fails a Strength check (DC equal to

your  caster  level  +  12)  against  your

 rst attack, the driving force of the

tail slap pushes your foe back 5 feet

plus another 5 feet for every 5 points

of damage your foe takes.

If a wall or other solid object pre-

vents the subject from being pushed

back, the subject instead slams into

the  object  and  takes  an  extra  2d6

points  of  damage  from  the  impact

(no save). The movement of your foe

caused by a tail slap does not provoke

attacks  of  opportunity.  The  chance

to push your foe back is only gained

on the attack you make in the round

when you initially cast the spell.

Special:  A  dragonblooded  character,

or a character with the dragon type, has

a chance to push back a foe with every

attack it makes during the spells dura-

tion, instead of just the  rst attack made

in the round when the spell is cast.

TAIL SWEEP

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 10 feet

Area: 10-foot-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

in a 10-foot radius, dealing 1d6 points

of  damage  per  level  to  all  creatures

that  fail  a  Re ex  saving  throw  and

half  that  damage  to  creatures  that

succeed on the save.

Creatures that fail the Re ex save

are also knocked prone.

Special: A dragonblooded character,

or a character with the dragon type,

casts this spell at +1 caster level.

UNFETTERED GRASP

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-

Affecting]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One grappling or pinned

creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You speak a word of emancipation.

Upon casting this spell, you force the

target creature to immediately attempt

a grapple check. If it succeeds on that

check, the creature immediately ends

and escapes from any grapple or pin

that it is currently subject to (even if

it isnt the creatures turn). Typically,

this spell is used to free an ally from

the grasp of a creature that is larger

and/or stronger than the ally.

This spell was developed by dragon-

born sorcerers to better face the threat

of  their  enormous  dragon  enemies

(many  of  which  have  the  ability  to

snatch up smaller foes).

WALL OF SCALES

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sorcerer 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Dragonhide wall whose area

is up to one 5-ft. square per level (S)

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils

from behind you and sweeps through

the  area,  then  vanishes  as  quickly  as

it appeared.

You evoke a dragons tail that savagely

sweeps through the space around you

You blow a dragon scale from your palm,

and before you sprouts a wall of glittering

scales, pulsing like living  esh.

You create a barrier of living dragon-

hide that is anchored to the ground or

 oor, or between two vertical surfaces.

10/25/05   12:19:16 PM

A wall of scales is 1 inch thick per two

caster levels and composed of up to one

5-foot square per level. You can double

the walls area by halving its thickness.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it

occupies the same space as a creature

or another object.

You  can  create  a  wall  of  scales  in

almost  any  shape  you  desire,  pro-

vided it is anchored in some fashion.

It need not be vertical, and you can

shape  it  into  a  circular  or  dome-

shaped enclosure about yourself or

another creature.

The wall can be destroyed by normal

means of dealing damage, as well as

by disintegrate spells and so forth. It is

immune to acid and  re. In addition,

the wall of scales has damage reduction

5/magic. For every  ve caster levels

above  5th,  this  damage  reduction

increases by 5, reaching a maximum

of 20/magic at 20th level. Each 5-foot

square of wall has 10 hit points per

inch of thickness. A section of wall

whose hit points are reduced to 0 is

breached. It is not possible to break a

wall of scales with a Strength check.

It is possible, but dif cult, to trap

mobile opponents within or under

a wall of scales, provided the wall is

shaped so it can hold the creatures.

Creatures can avoid entrapment with

successful Re ex saves.

Material  Component:  A  pristine

dragon scale.

WINGS OF BOUNDING

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Instantaneous

Immense,  partially  translucent  wings

unfurl from behind you for an instant

just before you jump, helping you achieve

incredible distance or height.

You evoke immense, partially trans-

lucent  wings  that  grant  you  a  +20

circumstance bonus on a Jump check

you make in the same round when

you  cast  the  spell.  In  addition,  if

you are intentionally jumping down

from a height and you succeed on the

DC 15 Jump check to do so, you take

falling damage as if you had dropped

30 fewer feet than you actually did.

Special: A dragonblooded character,

or a character with the dragon type,

gains an additional +1 bonus on the

Jump check for every two caster levels

(maximum +10).

Range: 30 ft.

Area: 30-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

WINGS OF COVER

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 immediate action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Instantaneous

Immense, partially translucent wings

unfurl from behind you and completely

shield you from the sight of your enemies

for a single heartbeat.

Your evoked wings grant cover against

a speci c attack. If your foe is about

to attack you with a melee, ranged,

spell, or psionic attack, you can cast

this  spell  immediately,  creating  a

hemispherical barrier (or a spherical

barrier  if  you  are  not  standing  on

solid  ground)  of  force  shaped  like

dragon wings. The wings of force last

just long enough to disrupt your foes

line  of  effect  to  you,  providing  you

total cover against a single attack with

a  weapon,  spell,  or  psionic  power.

Your  foes   rst  attack  in  this  round

cannot be made and is wasted against

you, though he could decide to take

any other action, including choosing

to attack one of your allies instead, or

take a full attack action that grants

him additional melee attacks against

you  in  this  round  (if  your  foe  is  of

high enough level to have additional

attacks). The wings unfurl and then

dissipate an instant later.

Your  foe  could  choose  to  attack

the  area  in  which  you  have  taken

cover with an area attack (such as a

 reball spell). In this case, you gain a

+8 bonus to AC (if applicable) and a

+4 bonus on Re ex saves.

Special: A dragonblooded charac-

ter, or a character with the dragon

type,  can  provide  cover  for  one

additional  adjacent  ally  for  every

three caster levels.

WINGS OF FLURRY

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Immense,  scaled  wings  unfurl  from

behind you and beat at nearby foes in a

savage  urry before vanishing as quickly

as they appeared.

You evoke  ickering dragons wings

that strike at every target in range,

dealing  1d6  points  of  damage  per

caster level to all designated targets

within 30 feet that fail a Re ex saving

throw and half that damage to crea-

tures that succeed on the save.

Creatures that fail the Re ex save

are also dazed for 1 round.

Special: A dragonblooded character,

or a character with the dragon type,

casts this spell at +1 caster level.

WINGS OF

SWIFT FLYING

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level or until

underlying  ight effect lapses;

see text

Immense,  partially  translucent  wings

unfurl  from  behind  you  and  begin  to

beat expertly against the air, accelerating

your  ight.

After  you  have  already  cast  fly  or

overland flight or are enjoying some

other temporary power or magical

flight effect, you can cast wings of

swift flying to increase your speed.

This spell evokes ghostly, translucent

wings that add 30 feet to your fly

speed  granted  by  the  underlying

spell for that spells duration. When

the underlying  ight effects dura-

tion elapses, the wings of swift  ying

spell also immediately ends.

Only characters who are already

enjoying the effect of  ight granted

by a spell, power, or other temporary

magical or psionic effect can make use

of this spell. Characters who are  ying

through some other means (such as

natural wings of their own) gain no

bene t from casting this spell.

PSIONIC POWERS

Dragons are creatures of magic, not

psionics,  but  that  doesnt  prevent

psionically  gifted  individuals  from

encountering them. The following

powers have been perfected by such

individuals  after  their  observations

od dragonkind. Each is designed to

replicate  or  thwart  some  aspect  of

dragonhood.

Existing  dragon-related  powers

from the Expanded Psionics Handbook

include  breath  of  the  black  dragon,

which produces a dragonlike breath

weapon,  and  crisis  of  breath,  which

potentially disrupts a dragons abil-

ity  to  breathe  when  the  power  is

augmented.

PSION/WILDER POWERS

3rd Level

Breath Barrier: You create a quasi-

real barrier that moves with you.

4th Level

BREATH BARRIER

Metacreativity

Level: Psion/wilder 3, psychic war-

rior 3

Display: Visual

Manifesting Time: 1 standard

action

Range: 10 ft.

Area: 10-ft.-radius emanation, cen-

tered on you

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Power Points: 5

A sparkling golden sphere forms around

you, moving as you move.

You create a quasi-real barrier in the

shape of a sphere that shimmers with

golden sparkles and moves with you.

Creatures and objects can enter or

leave the area unimpeded. A breath

barrier  blocks  fog,  foglike  effects,

and gases created by spells such as fog

cloud or cloudkill or by breath weapons

that are poison gas.

When  used  as  a  barrier  against

breath  weapons  that  deal  hit  point

damage directly, the sphere absorbs

up to 60 points of damage from one

or more breath weapons before col-

lapsing  (at  which  time  the  power

ends). A breath barrier takes damage

as though it were a creature that failed

its  saving  throw  against  the  breath

weapon being used.

Augment: For every 2 additional

power points you spend, the barrier

can absorb an additional 12 points

of  breath  weapon  damage  before

collapsing.

hough the dragonkind races are relatively rare,

their  unique  outlook  on  the  world  coupled

with  their  draconic  ingenuity  have  led  them

to develop a number of items speci c to their

cultures. Kobolds are particularly smitten by the

inventing bug, though many of the items they

claim to have invented can be traced to origins elsewhere

as well. Whether this duplication is due to imitation or

independent  development  is  a  matter  of  contention  in

some circles.

NEW ARMOR MATERIALS

Weapons and armor can be formed out of many unusual

materials.  Two  that  are  particularly  relevant  to  certain

dragonborn characters, chitin armor and colored armor,

are described below.

CHITIN ARMOR

Kobold armorsmiths have recently begun mass-producing

suits of armor made from the organic hides of giant beetles

(MM 204205). The smiths claim that this advance results

from their own hard work and study, though it is widely

believed that they were taught the basic secrets of chitin

armorworking by the troglodytes.

Though less durable than dragonhide, chitin armor (also

known as beetleback armor) has other advantages. Chitin is

less restricting than metal, even though it weighs the same

amount. The maximum Dexterity bonus of an armor or

shield made of chitin is 1 greater than that of the same

type of armor made from metal. Breastplates, half-plate

armor, full plate armor, and shields can be made from

chitin. (Typically, the only kind of shield crafted from

chitin is a tower shield, since most shields dont have

a maximum Dexterity bonus.)

A single giant beetle provides enough material to

create a single breastplate or tower shield sized for

a character of the same size category as the beetle

(or  two  such  items  for  a  character  two  or  more

sizes smaller than the beetle). For example, a Large

giant stag beetle has enough chitin to make either

a  breastplate  or  a  tower  shield  sized  for  a  Large

character, or two such items for Medium or smaller

characters. A suit of half-plate or full plate armor

takes twice as much chitin, while a light shield or

heavy shield takes half as much. (A chitin buckler

can be made from the cast-off bits of any giant

beetle.) The chitin from multiple giant beetles

can be combined; a Small beetle counts as half

of a Medium beetle, a Medium beetle as half of

a Large beetle, and so forth.

Because chitin armor isnt made from metal,

druids can wear it without penalty. Armor and shields

fashioned from chitin are always masterwork items;

the masterwork cost is included in the prices given

below. Chitin armor or shields cost double what  121

SPECIAL SUBSTANCES

AND ITEMS

Kobolds take credit for the following alchemical innova-

tions, but other races claim many as their own creations.

Both drow and deep gnomes consider sundark goggles to

be one of their races accomplishments, for example.

Bitterleaf Oil: Kobolds use this salve to keep their scales

healthy and shiny. Each bottle of bitterleaf oil holds enough

for ten applications. If the oil is applied each day (a full-round

action), it staves off shedding inde nitely. In addition, on

any day when bitterleaf oil is applied, the character naturally

heals 1 additional point of damage per HD (max. 5) with a

full nights rest.

Ditherbomb:  These  are  spherical  explosive  devices

created by kobold alchemists to reduce large boulders to

rubble  during  mining  operations.  They  have  also  been

adapted for military purposes. Activating a ditherbomb

is move action that involves violently shaking the device,

which explodes 1d3 rounds later. (Violently shaking the

bearer of a ditherbomb often sets the bomb off as well.)

Throwing a ditherbomb is a standard action.

Ditherbombs  come  in  three  varieties,  each  of  which

deals a different amount of damage and has a different blast

radius. Weak ditherbombs deal 1d6 points of acid damage

to creatures and objects in a 5-foot-radius burst (Re ex DC

10 half). Strong ditherbombs deal 1d41d6 points of acid

damage (Re ex DC 12 half) in a 10-foot-radius burst. The

Chitin armor

masterwork armor of that type ordinarily costs, but take

no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type.

Chitin armor has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and

hardness 5.

COLORED METAL

Kobolds and spellscales working together have perfected

the process of smelting certain minerals into metal ore to

create colored or tinted ingots. Any shade of red, orange,

yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, or white can be

created to suit any preference with marginal effort. Though

the effect is only super cial, colored metal items still typi-

cally cost 10% to 25% more due to the extra care required in

creating the items. Spellscales are the primary purchasers

of armor and weapons made from colored metal.

is a swift action. In addition, casting any spell or manifesting any

power with a casting time or manifesting time of 1 swift action

(such as breath avoidance) is a swift action. Casting a spell or

manifesting a power with a casting or manifesting time of 1 swift

action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

SWIFT AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

The Miniatures Handbook introduced the concept of a new action

type: the swift action. Likewise, the Expanded Psionics Handbook

introduced another new action type: the immediate action. Some

of the class features, feats, spells, and items in Races of the Dragon

use these concepts. A description of how they work follows.

Swift Action: A swift action consumes a very small amount of

time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than

a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn without af-

fecting your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift

action is like a free action. However, you can perform only a single

swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take.

You can take a swift action any time you would normally be

allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve magic

or psionics, or the activation of magic or psionic items; many

characters (especially those who dont use magic or psionics)

never have an opportunity to take a swift action.

Casting a quickened spell or manifesting a quickened power

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Immediate  Action:  Much  like  a  swift  action,  an  immediate

action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a

larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. Unlike

a  swift  action,  an  immediate  action  can  be  performed  at  any

timeeven if its not your turn.

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using

a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You

cannot use another immediate action or a swift action until after

your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is

not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action

before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for the

coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you

are currently flat-footed.

most potent ditherbombs, called wyrm ditherbombs, deal

1d61d8 points of acid damage in a 15-foot-radius burst

(Re ex DC 15 half). The damage dealt by a ditherbomb

ignores the hardness of stone.

The more powerful ditherbombs are inherently unpre-

dictable, as re ected in their variable damage values. To

determine the damage dealt by a strong ditherbomb or a

wyrm ditherbomb, roll two different dice and multiply the

results. For example, a strong ditherbomb deals 1d41d6

points of damage, which means that you roll 1d4 and 1d6

and multiply the result together to determine the damage

it deals when it explodes. The strong ditherbomb is thus

just as likely to deal 1 point of damage as it is to deal 24

points of damage (but is most likely to deal somewhere

around 9 points of damage). A wyrm ditherbombs average

damage is about 16 points.

Fire Beetle Lamp: This lamp uses the luminous gland

located above each eye of a  re beetle as its light source.

Thanks to a special alchemical treatment, a  re beetle lamp

shines as brightly as a common lamp (bright illumination

out to 15 feet, shadowy illumination to 30 feet) and lasts for

6 days after creation. (Most  re beetle lamps are put into

service immediately upon creation, but some unscrupulous

merchants sell lamps after they have been used for a few

days.) Kobold miners use these lamps when they need to

see more than darkvision typically allows, speci cally

when color might be important.

Sundark Goggles: The smoked lenses of these goggles

block light. They are typically  xed into a band of canvas

that clasps together at the back to keep the goggles from

falling off. Sundark goggles negate the dazzled condition

experienced by a creature with light sensitivity while in

bright illumination. As a side effect, they grant the wearer

a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against gaze

attacks. A creature wearing sundark goggles cant use a gaze

attack, since other creatures cant see its eyes. Creatures

without low-light vision or darkvision that wear sundark

goggles take a 2 penalty on Search and Spot checks.

WONDROUS ITEMS

Dragons are inherently magical, and those who carry

their blood enjoy a natural pro ciency with the arcane.

Dragonkind characters are often drawn to spellcasting

classes. Even those who do not pursue such paths can still

make effective use of magic items.

AMULET OF WARMTH

Amulets of warmth are personal devices designed to keep

humanoids comfortable in any environment.

Lore: These devices were originally crafted for kobolds

whose search for new mining locations kept them away

from their warm lairs. (Knowledge [geography] DC 10 or

Knowledge [dungeoneering] DC 20)

Description: An amulet of warmth typically takes the

form of a simple amulet or brooch, though it can be fash-

ioned into some other form of personal jewelry.

Activation: As a free action, tapping an amulet of health

turns the item on. Tapping it again turns the item off.

Effect: An amulet of warmth produces an ambient cocoon

of  70F,  protecting  the  wearer  and  his  equipment  from

both cold and heat. If an amulet takes any amount of cold

damage, however, it ceases to function for 24 hours.

Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration; CL 3rd.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements,

500 gp, 40 XP, 1 day.

Weight: 1/2 lb.

Price: 1,000 gp.

DRAGONBLOOD ITEMS

Crafters that have the dragonblood subtype often create magic

items that are sensitive to the users nature. Such items are keyed

to the wielders draconic heritage and must be held or touched

in a specified way by the prospective user. Sometimes the items

manufacture reflects this: A swords grip might have indentations

for fingers or claws, an amulet could have a small spike to prick

the wearers skin, and so forth. Two types of dragonblood items

existthose with restricted use and those with hidden potential.

Neither of these added sensitivities has an impact on the price of

an item or its cost to create. It is up to the crafter to decide whether

one of these traits is appropriate for the item in question.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Restricted Use Items: A crafter can make an item usable

only by a creature with draconic ancestry. A user without the

dragonblood subtype enjoys only the nonmagical qualities

of the item: a masterwork suit of armor, a beautiful ring, and

so forth. A wielder that has draconic blood can use the item in

the normal way.

Hidden Potential Items: A user that has the dragonblood

subtype is able to activate a special ability worked into the item

that  is  unavailable  to  others.  For  example,  a  +1  flaming  long-

sword is instead a +1 flaming burst longsword in the hands of a

dragonblooded wielder.

ANGRIZS CHEST

This container keeps meat fresh and wholesome.

Lore: Angriz Ulhargix is a half-dragon wizard, a gourmet

cook, and a voracious carnivore. His monstrous nature makes

it dif cult for him to shop for food frequently in the normal

fashion, so he crafted this box to keep large quantities of meat

inde nitely. In this way, he could order an entire haunch

of game once in a while and consume it at his leisure. The

item has since become popular with those who can afford

it, especially the proprietors of large eating establishments

and the managers of nobles kitchens. It has come to be

known as Angrizs chest, though its creator simply called it

a preserving box. (Knowledge [arcana] DC 20)

Description: An Angrizs chest is a box, about 4 feet on

a side, made of stout wood (usually oak) and lined with

oilcloth to prevent leakage.

Effect: Any dead  esh kept within the box remains

fresh and palatable inde nitely. Once removed, the  esh

begins to decay at the normal rate. Putting partly decayed

meat into the box arrests further rot but does not reverse

previous effects.

Aura/Caster Level: Faint necromancy; CL 1st.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, 500

gp, 40 XP, 1 day.

Weight: 50 lb.

Price: 1,000 gp.

FOLDING TRAP

Folding traps were invented by a master kobold trapmaker

to aid in timely retreats.

Lore: These devices are usually constructed by kobolds

to provide quick installation of traps, as well as to easily

carry along useful traps when they are retreating from

their lair. (Knowledge [arcana] DC 15 or Knowledge [his-

tory] DC 25)

Description: A folding trap is a small wooden ball the

size of a large apple, every square inch of which has been

etched with symmetrical Draconic runes. These carvings

contain a hidden code that reveals the folding traps com-

mand words. (Decipher Script DC 20)

Activation: As a standard action, speaking the word

expand in Draconic (turalisjth) causes the wooden ball to

unfold into a trap that attaches itself to the available sup-

porting framework ( oor, ground, trees, walls). Speaking

the word shrink in Draconic (kosjth), another standard

action, while within 30 feet of the trap causes it to fold into

a wooden ball once again.

Effect: Several varieties of folding trap exist, each based on

one of the sample traps presented in the Dungeon Masters

Guide beginning on page 70. The known variations on this

item include the scything blade folding trap (CR 1), the wall

blade folding trap (CR 1), the tripping chain folding trap (CR 2),

the ceiling pendulum folding trap (CR 3), and the wall scythe

folding trap (CR 4). Once activated, a folding trap is indistin-

guishable from a normal trap of its kind except for the traps

magical aura (see below).

Aura/Caster Level: Faint transmutation; CL 5th.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, create trap*, shrink

item, creator must have 5 ranks of Craft (trapmaking); 1,700

gp, 136 XP, 4 days (scything blade); 2,500 gp, 200 XP, 5

days (wall blade); 3,800 gp, 304 XP, 8 days (tripping chain);

14,100 gp, 1,128 XP, 29 days (ceiling pendulum); 17,200 gp,

1,376 XP, 35 days (wall scythe).

New spell described on page 112.

Variants: Other varieties of folding trap might also exist,

but they all must involve the use of mechanical traps that

have an automatic reset (no arrow traps), dont represent a

signi cant change to the physical environment (no pits or

 ooding chambers), and dont incorporate poison, magic,

or living organisms (no toxic blades or brown mold).

Weight: 1 lb.

Price: 3,400 gp (scything blade); 5,000 gp (wall blade);

7,600 gp (tripping chain); 28,200 gp (ceiling pendulum);

34,400 gp (wall scythe).

MEMENTO MAGICA

Sorcerers,  bards,  and  all  spontaneous  spellcasters  of  all

sorts can bene t from a memento magica.

Description: A memento magica appears to be an amethyst

cunningly cut into some draconic shape, often that of a

dragons scale.

Effect: A memento magica is a great aid to spontaneous

spellcasters such as sorcerers, bards, and favored souls (see

Complete Divine page 6), much as a pearl of power is to casters

who prepare spells. Once per day on command, a memento

magica enables its possessor to regain any one spell slot that

she had previously used that day. The spell slot is available

just as if a spell had not been cast. A memento magica can

only recall a spell slot of the level it was created to hold.

Different mementos magica exist for recalling one spell slot

per day of each level from 1st through 9th.

Aura/Caster Level: Strong transmutation; CL 17th.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be

able to spontaneously cast spells of the spell level to be

recalled; 750 gp, 60 XP, 2 days (1st); 3,000 gp, 240 XP, 6

days (2nd); 6,750 gp, 540 XP, 14 days (3rd); 12,000 gp, 960

XP, 24 days (4th); 18,750 gp, 1,500 XP, 38 days (5th); 27,000

gp, 2,160 XP, 54 days (6th); 36,750 gp, 2,940 XP, 74 days

(7th); 48,000 gp, 3,840 XP, 96 days (8th); 60,750 gp, 4,860

XP, 122 days (9th).

Weight: 

Price: 1,500 gp (1st); 6,000 gp (2nd); 13,500 gp (3rd);

24,000 gp (4th); 37,500 gp (5th), 54,000 gp (6th); 73,500

gp (7th); 96,000 gp (8th); 121,500 gp (9th).

NECKLACE OF DRAGONS TEETH

A necklace of dragons teeth summons a troop of loyal draconic

warriors to your aid.

Lore: Legends say that in the early days of the world, nearly

all human life was wiped out in a great catastrophe. Sphenos,

the Great Wyrm of the Earth, took pity on the few survivors

and gave a bag  lled with his own teeth to the farmer

Imguten, telling him to sow them behind him in the earth

as he walked. From the scattered teeth arose new people,

the children of earth. (Knowledge [religion] DC 15)

Imguten saved some of the teeth against future need.

Generations later, when his descendants were being threat-

ened by barbarians, they found the sack and planted the

remaining teeth. These teeth then sprang up into  erce

warriors who drove back the invading horde. These strings

are made in remembrance of that miracle. (Knowledge

[religion] DC 20)

10/25/05   12:20:35 PM

Description: A necklace of dragons teeth is a simple leather

cord strung with pierced fangs, each about 2 inches long.

Sometimes the ends are loosely tied so that it can be worn

around the neck. (It does not count as an item worn around

the  neck  for  the  purpose  of  determining  which  of  a

characters magic items are effective.) A strand initially

has twelve fangs, though it can be discovered with fewer

fangs than this (reduce the price proportionately).

Activation:  As  a  standard  action,  you  remove  a  fang

from the string and throw it onto the ground.

Effect: A thrown fang grows into a draconic myrmidon

that acts on your turn on the following round (see the

statistics  block  below).  The  myrmidon  remains  for  10

rounds  or  until  it  is  slain,  and  either  defends  you  loy-

ally  or  attacks  a  target  of  your  choice.  The  myrmidon

understands your spoken commands regardless of the

language you speak.

MEDALLIONS OF IO

These are plain, burnished metal disks that grant some of

the strength of the Concordant Dragon to their users.

Lore: Ios holy symbol is a featureless metal disk with a

sheen of many colors, symbolizing the common heritage

of all dragons as well as the spinning disk of the Blending

(see page 66). In honor of that creative act, the Singers of

Concordance created the medallions of Io to aid the Ninefold

Dragons  children  throughout  the  world.  (Knowledge

[arcana] DC 20)

Description: Each medallion of Io is an unremarkable

coin-sized disk made from an alloy of precious and base

metals. The exact mixture of metals produces a colored

sheen  that  corresponds  to  one  of  the  ten  standard

dragon varieties.

Activation: As a standard action, you press a disk into the

center of your brow, where it remains magically attached

and active for 1 hour. It does not count as an item worn

on the head for the purpose of determining which of a

characters magic items are effective. At the end of the hour,

the medallion loses its magic and falls to the ground.

Effect: Each of the ten disks has a different benefit

according to its sheen, as given below.

Black: Resistance to acid 10 and a +4 bonus on Handle

Animal checks when dealing with reptiles.

Blue: Resistance to electricity 10 and a +4 bonus on

Bluff checks.

Green:  Resistance  to  acid  10  and  the  ability  to  make

untrained Diplomacy checks to affect the attitude of plant

creatures. The DC of these checks is increased by 5.

Red: Resistance to  re 10 and a +4 bonus on Will saves

against illusion spells and effects.

White: Resistance to cold 10 and a +4 bonus on Balance

checks.

Brass: Resistance to  re 10 and a +4 bonus on Handle

Animal checks.

Bronze: Resistance to electricity 10 and a +4 bonus on

Sense Motive checks.

Copper: Resistance to acid 10 and a +4 bonus on Per-

form checks.

Gold: Resistance to  re 10 and a +4 bonus on Fortitude

saves against effects that damage, drain, or apply a penalty

to the wearers ability scores.

Silver: Resistance to cold 10 and a +4 bonus on checks

to resist being knocked down by wind, overrun and trip

attempts, and similar effects.

Price: 1,000 gp.

SOFTHANDS GLOVES

Softhands gloves help disguise your draconic pedigree

without drawing attention to you.

Description: These cloth gloves are made of a stretchy

material that allows them to  t over the hands of human-

shaped creatures from Small to Large size.

Effect: As long as you are wearing the gloves, your skin,

hair, and eyes lose overtly draconic features such as scales,

horns, slit pupils, and so forth. You resemble an ordinary

member of your nondraconic race, negating any penalty

on Disguise checks you would ordinarily take when

disguising yourself as a different race.

While wearing the gloves, you lose any natural claw

attacks you might have. Your hands appear ordinary. The

gloves themselves are no longer visible once worn but

blend with the wearers apparent skin.

Aura/Caster Level: Faint transmutation; CL 3rd.

10/25/05   12:20:37 PM

10/25/05   12:20:37 PM

Lore: These spears are awarded to kobold sorcerers for

consistently protecting their lair without ever needing to

be protected themselves. (Knowledge [history] DC 10 or

Knowledge [local] DC 20)

The ore that goes into making spell inging spears is an

amalgam of red copper and steel. (Profession [miner] DC

15 or Craft [armorsmithing, blacksmithing, or weapon-

smithing] DC 25)

Description: A spell inging spear is a Small +1 returning

spell storing spear, the piercing blade of which is tinted with

ruby red metal and has a shaft of light steel.

Activation: As a swift action (see page 122), speaking the

word expand in Draconic (turalisjth) elongates the weapon,

speaking the word shrink in Draconic (kosjth) shortens

the weapon, and speaking the word normal in Draconic

(munth) returns a spell inging spear to normal size.

Effect: Once elongated, a spell inging spear has all the

characteristics of a longspear. Once shortened, a spell ing-

ing spear has all the characteristics of a shortspear.

A spellflinging spear always weighs as much as a spear

and has hardness 12 and 20 hit points, regardless of its

shape.

Aura/Caster Level: Strong evocation (plus the aura of

the stored spell, if not already present) and transmutation;

item, telekinesis, CL 12th, 10,802 gp, 840 XP, 11 days.

Variants: More powerful versions of the spell inging

spear often add the distance and/or the gnome bane weapon

special abilities (DMG 224). Adding one of these abilities

increases the weapons price by 14,000 gp; adding both

increases it by 32,000 gp.

DRACONIC GRAFTS

Many  of  the  dragon-descended  are  born  of  a  union

between a dragon in humanoid form and a true human-

oid. A few creatures take matters into their own hands,

however, controlling draconic bloodlines with amazing

results. These beings capture the living eggs of dragons

and experiment on the unborn wyrmlings, whether to

enhance their own or others abilities, create new forms

of life, or bring salvation from evil. These individuals are

known as wyrmgrafters.

Many  wyrmgrafters  have  some  magical  aptitude,

although such talent is not a requirement for being able

to create a graft. The weird science of draconic grafts

appeals to anyone who specializes in secret knowledge.

Many wyrmgrafters have a draconic bloodline, but they

can come from any race and culture. Some are idealists (or

zealots) who believe their work can turn an evil dragon

from its otherwise doomed existence.

Wyrmgrafters are a strange lot, each not generally aware

of others following this pursuit. Each has her own way of

going  about  research  and  experimenting  on  candidate

creatures. Despite the lack of an overarching organiza-

tion, the all-consuming desire for esoteric knowledge

does bring wyrmgrafters into contact with one another

from time to time. Occasionally a wyrmgrafter sponsors

a gathering of like-minded individuals, a weeklong event

held at the sponsors base of operations or at a nearby hall

or inn. These events typically have lectures and hands-on

demonstrations interspersed with leisure activities.

GRAFTING

Creating a graft involves taking a portion of an existing

creature and transplanting it into or onto the body of

another living creature. Grafting is essentially an alterna-

tive method of item creation, and its bene ts are many.

Bearers gain the bene ts of magic items without actually

wearing the items. Many grafts are dif cult to spot under

casual observation, allowing their bearer an unseen advan-

tage when other potent items are unavailable. Some players

 nd that grafts are more  avorful and interesting than

traditional magic itemswhile wearing a pair of magic

gloves is somewhat mundane, actually transforming your

hands with draconic claws makes a real statement.

The draconic grafts in this book have the following

rules in common. (These follow the revised graft rules

presented in Magic of Eberron.)

Draconic grafts can be created and applied only by

someone with the Wyrmgrafter feat. While the creation

and application of a graft is similar in theory to the prin-

ciples involved in the creation of wondrous items, grafts

involve the magical manipulation of biological processes

and  structures.  The  grafter  must  be  able  to  manipulate

draconic life energy on a minute scale. More information

on creating grafts is presented below. The Wyrmgrafter

feat is described on page 101 of this book.

An  individual  can  have  a  total  of    ve  grafts  on

his body, and all grafts must be of the same kind. A

single body can support only so many growths before it is

overwhelmed with competing biomagical signals, result-

ing in death or, as is more often the case, utter madness.

No portion of the body (head, skin,  esh, legs, and arms)

can have more than one graft. Furthermore, no character

can have more than one type of graftfor instance, both

a draconic graft and an undead graft (described on page

70 of Libris Mortis or page 214 of Fiend Folio). Rumors of

attempts to bypass these biological limits abound, but

such  monstrositiesfor  that  is  what  such  creatures

becomerarely live long.

A graft requires a sacri  ce from the host. The dra-

conic grafts presented here take a toll on a creatures body.

In most cases, a graft simply applies a permanent reduction

to the characters hit point total. This is not damage and

cant be healed. In others, a graft might cause a permanent

reduction in an ability score or a permanent penalty on

certain checks or saves. A creature with a graft cannot get

rid of the penalties or other costs of a graft unless the graft

is removed. The speci c extra cost of a graft is provided

with each grafts description under the Sacri ce entry.

All draconic grafts are grown from tissues taken

from one or more creatures. Typically, this involves

removing a sample of  esh from an unhatched wyrmling

and growing it onto a living creature. Each graft has a

Donor entry, which describes where the graft originates

from. If taken from a donor creature, the graft tissues

must be no more than 7 days old when creation of the

graft begins. The donation typically does not harm the

donor creature, though some wyrmgrafters prefer to take

donations from dead donors for their own safety.

Grafts are dif  cult to remove. Grafts have no statistics

of their own and cant be attacked or damaged separately

from the creature to which they are grafted. A character

with the Wyrmgrafter feat can remove a draconic graft

safely from a living creature; this requires 8 hours of work

in a quiet setting (similar to creating a graft). A graft that

has been safely removed can be applied to another char-

acter, though this application must take place within 24

hours of its removal and deals 4d6 points of Constitution

damage to the receiving character. Without the proper feat,

a graft can be removed only if the body part to which it

is grafted is removed (a grisly task to be sure); even then,

the graft tissue instantly dies and cant be reused.

Similarly, a graft on a creature that is killed also dies

instantly and cant be harvested and reused. Among other

effects, this means that an NPCs graft probably cant be

recovered as treasure. For tips on dealing with this in

the game, the DM should consult the Draconic Grafts as

Treasure sidebar (see page 129). A graft should, however,

be treated as part of a creature for the purpose of being

brought back from the dead, so a character who is killed

and resurrected returns with her grafts intact.

A graft is not a magic item. It does not radiate a magi-

cal aura once completed, and it does not take up space on

the body as a magic item would. A graft cant be suppressed

with dispel magic, nor is it affected by an antimagic  eld or

similar effect.

Multiple draconic grafts bestow a cumulative bene t

upon their host. A character with at least two draconic

grafts gains damage reduction x/magic, where x equals the

number of draconic grafts he has minus one (DR 1/magic

for two draconic grafts, DR 2/magic for three, and so on).

In addition, if the character has at least two draconic grafts,

his natural attacks are treated as magic weapons for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

CREATING A DRACONIC GRAFT

The creation of a draconic graft must be done in a quiet

and comfortable setting and requires a supply of materi-

als, including the donated tissue sample or body part

(see  below).  The  cost  of  the  materials  is  subsumed  in

the cost of creating the graft. Creating a graft otherwise

works like crafting a wondrous item, including the cost

to create, time required, preparation of spells required,

and expenditure of components, focuses, or XP required

by the spells (except as noted below). If a graft incurs

extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in its

description, these costs are in addition to those derived

from the grafts base price.

Unlike with creating normal magic items, draconic

grafts need not be crafted over consecutive days. A wyrm-

grafter can spend a day here and there tending to a growing

graft. It is not functional until the total time necessary

to complete the graft is spent. However, he cannot skip

more than 7 days during his work on an incomplete graft;

doing so means the incomplete graft dies, and he loses a

portion of the gp involved in the grafts creation equal

to the amount of time spent working on it. No XP is lost

until the graft is completed. A wyrmgrafter must devote

8 hours to the task on any day when he works on a graft.

Failure to do so means the days work is wasted, and no gp

or XP are spent.

The recipient of a draconic graft doesnt incur any of the

costs involved with acquiring a graft until it is attached

during the second phase of the procedure. A completed

graft can be attached to a recipient in a procedure that

takes  8  hours,  during  which  time  both  the  grafter  and

the recipient must be present. If a graft is not attached to

a recipient within 1 day of when it is completed, the graft

requires 1 hour of care from the wyrmgrafter each day

thereafter to keep it from dying.

BUFFETING WINGS

Your arms sprout veined membranes, granting you the

power of  ight and allowing you to strike your enemies.

Location: Arms.

Description: Each of your arms sprouts rays of cartilage

supporting  ns (if from a metallic dragon) or long bone

projections connected by taut  esh (if from a chromatic

dragon). The membranes of your buffeting wings fold down

when not in use. You can still wear and bene t from cloth-

ing and armor, though wearing a shield limits your wings

effectiveness (see below).

Activation:  Using  buffeting  wings  to  fly  requires  a

move action, as normal for any move. Using a wing to

make a slam attack is an attack action, or part of a full

attack action if you are using both wings or additional

natural weapons.

Effect: You gain a  y speed equal to your base land speed

with average maneuverability. You cant carry aloft more

than a light load. If you already have wings, this bene t

replaces your original  y speed and maneuverability. You

cant use your buffeting wings to  y if you are wearing a

shield (other than a buckler).

You  can  also  use  buffeting  wings  to  make  up  to  two

secondary slam attacks, but only while standing on the

ground. Each attack deals damage as a wing attack made

by dragon of your size (1d4 points for a Medium creature).

You cannot attack with weapons held in your hands during

the same round that you use buffeting wings (though you

can use other natural attacks), and you cant use a wing to

attack if that arm wears a shield (other than a buckler).

In addition to the hit point cost, these wings reduce

your overall agility, resulting in a permanent 2 penalty

to Dexterity.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, overland  ight or  ight of

the dragon*, 50,000 gp, 4,000 XP, 100 days.

DRAGONBONE LEGS

Powerful draconic leg bones are grafted into each of your

legs, giving you greater physical might in athletic tasks.

Location: Legs.

Description: Your legs become thicker

and more heavily muscled as the new

bone takes hold. Since the tissue graft

is internal, the appearance of your

skin is unchanged.

Activation:  A  host  uses

dragon bone legs as part of the

appropriate action to use the

skill  in  question  (Climb,

Jump, or Swim). No special

activation is required.

Effect: You gain a +4

bonus on Climb, Jump,

and Swim checks.

FRIGHTFUL CREST

Your head has been adorned with a portion of the crest,

spikes, or horns of the donor dragon. You gain an aura of

fear similar to a dragons frightful presence.

Location: Head.

Description:  A  frightful  crest  takes  the  form  of  the

primary head ornament of the dragon from which it was

taken; for example, a graft from a black dragon has its

characteristic crumpled horns, while that from

a silver dragon is a rayed  n.

A frightful crest melds seamlessly into

the surrounding  esh, gradually blend-

ing into your natural skin color.

Activation:  A  frightful  crest

activates  whenever  you  attack

or charge. You cannot choose

to suppress the effect.

Effect:  When  a  fright-

ful crest activates, any living

nondragon enemy within

30 feet becomes panicked

for 1 round if it has fewer

Hit Dice than you; crea-

tures  with  HD  equal  to

or greater than yours are

shaken  for  1  round  in-

stead. A successful Will

save  negates  this  effect

and renders the creature

immune to your frightful

crest for 24 hours; the save

DC is 10 + 1/2 your HD + your

Cha modi er. This is a mind-

affecting fear effect. Characters

who  are  immune  to  a  dragons

frightful presence are also immune

to a frightful crest.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, fear,

14,000 gp, 1,120 XP, 28 days.

Donor:  A  crest  or  horn  from  a

dragon.

Sacri  ce: 6 hp.

Price: 28,000 gp.

Location: Flesh.

Description:  Although  your

appearance does not undergo an obvious

physical change, you ooze con dence

and pride. If the donor was a chromatic

dragon, this attitude is tinged with

arrogance and a certainty of victory.

If the  esh came from a metallic dragon, you radiate an

air of watchful patience.

A frightful crest bestows the power

of dragonfear on the grafted creature

Activation: Dragonheart presence is always active once

the graft is installed. It requires no action on your part to

activate or deactivate.

Effect: You gain immunity to paralysis effects and the

frightful presence of dragonkind. In addition, you gain a

+2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, and

Intimidate checks you make involving a creature with the

dragonblood subtype.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, remove paralysis, 6,000 gp,

480 XP, 12 days.

Donor: A piece of flesh from an unhatched wyrm-

lings heart.

Sacri  ce: 4 hp.

Price: 12,000 gp.

GLARING EYE

The pupil of a dragons eye has been grown into your own.

As a result, you gain the keen senses and the wakefulness

of a dragon.

Location: Head.

Description: A glaring eye is the same color as the eye

of the dragon it was grown from and has a slitted pupil

like that of a crocodile. It has no lid and cannot close.

Activation: A glaring eye is always active once the graft

is installed. It requires no action on your part to activate

or deactivate.

Effect: You gain blindsense out to a distance of 30 feet

and a +2 bonus on Search and Spot checks. You also gain

immunity to magic sleep effects.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, sense of the dragon*, 5,000

gp, 400 XP, 10 days.

wyrmling, or an eye from a dragon.

Sacri  ce: 2 hp.

Price: 10,000 gp.

GLEAMING SCALES

Your skin is hardened with scales grown from samples

taken from a living dragon, allowing you to grow a protec-

tive plating over vulnerable areas.

Location: Skin.

Description: Strong, gleaming dragon scales cover the

skin of your torso and limbs. The scales are the color of

the donor dragon.

Gleaming scales have a glossy texture and can be ridged,

depending on the dragon variety. They move as you do,

not hindering your movement in the least.

Activation: Gleaming scales are always active once the

graft is installed. The graft requires no action on your part

to activate or deactivate.

Effect: Your natural armor bonus to AC improves by 1.

Because the graft improves your natural armor, an effect

that provides an enhancement bonus to your natural

armor (such as an amulet of natural armor) stacks with

gleaming scales.

Gleaming scales also provides resistance 5 to the same

energy type to which the donor dragons is immune or

resistant, or it increases your existing resistance to that

energy type (regardless of its origin) by 5. If the donor

dragon has immunity or resistance to more than one

kind of energy, choose which energy type to which you

are resistant. If the donor dragon has no immunity or

resistance to energy, the graft grants no resistance.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, dragonskin*, 4,500 gp, 360

XP, 9 days.

Spell described in Draconomicon, page 111.

Donor: A sample of scaled skin from an unhatched

wyrmling.

Sacri  ce: 4 hp.

Price: 9,000 gp.

METABOLIC FIRE

You acquire the dragons devastating ability to breathe

energy.

Location: Flesh.

Description: The implantation of this graft within your

chest leaves no casually visible effect. However, exposure to

the energy within your body darkens your teeth until they

become solid black, like obsidian. A faint gleam of  re, rime

of frost, crackle of electricity, or shimmer of acidic saliva

might play around your teeth when you show them.

Prerequisite: You must have at least one other draconic

graft before you can gain metabolic  re.

Activation: Using metabolic  re is a standard action.

Effect:  You  gain  a  breath  weapon,  usable  once  every

1d4 rounds, that functions as described on page 306 of the

Monster Manual. The form of the weapon (line or cone) is

the same as that of the donor dragon; a cone-shaped breath

weapon has a length of 30 feet, while a line-shaped breath

weapon has a length of 60 feet.

The breath weapon granted by metabolic  re deals 6d8 points

of damage; a successful Re ex save (DC 10 + one-half your

HD + your Con modi er) halves the damage. The damage

type matches the type of energy damage dealt by the donor

dragon. Despite the name of the graft, it can deal any type

of energy damage associated with the donor dragon.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, dragon breath*, 28,000 gp,

2,240 XP, 56 days.

Spell described in Draconomicon, page 111.

Donor: Tissue from the draconis fundamentum (the

organ responsible for a dragons breath weapon, described

on  page  8  of  Draconomicon)  taken  from  an  unhatched

wyrmling. A donor dragon without a breath weapon (or

having a breath weapon that doesnt deal energy damage)

cant be used as a graft donor.

Sacri  ce: 6 hp.

Price: 56,000 gp.

RESILIENT SCALES

With the application of mature dragon scales, your scaly

skin renders you immune to a type of energy.

Location: Skin.

Description:  Thick,  tough  dragon  scales  cover  your

entire body. Their color is deep and true, resembling those

of the donor dragon.

Activation: Resilient scales is always active once the graft

is installed. The graft requires no action on your part to

activate or deactivate.

Effect: Resilient scales grants resistance 30 to the same

type of energy as the donor dragons immunity. If the

donor dragon has immunity to more than one kind of

energy, the creator chooses which energy type the graft

provides resistance against.

DRACONIC GRAFTS AS TREASURE

Draconic  grafts  enhance  a  characters  abilities  in  much  the

same way that magical equipment does, but they are not as

readily available. Because they affect a characters abilities as

equipment does, they have an equivalent gold piece value.

When adding a draconic graft to an NPC, the DM should

count the grafts gp equivalent as part of the total value of

the NPCs equipment. After all, the powers granted by the graft

are  directly  included  in  the  NPCs  Challenge  Rating,  just  as

magic items are. Since an NPCs grafts are almost certainly

not going to be claimed as treasure, however, the monetary

reward for defeating such an NPC is artificially lowered.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

If you anticipate this being a problem, consider adding trea-

sure  to  the  NPCs  hoard  in  an  amount  somewhere  between

50% and 100% of the grafts gp cost to make up for the loss.

For example, if the PCs defeat an NPC wearing a glaring eye but

they cant claim the graft as treasure, consider adding between

5,000 an 10,000 gp worth of treasure to the NPCs hoard (in

jewelry, gems, or coins, but not in additional equipment). The

lower end of this range describes the value the PCs would get

for selling an equivalent magic item, while the upper end is how

much an equivalent magic item would cost them to buy.

If you have at least one other draconic graft, resilient

scales counts as two grafts for the purpose of determining

the damage reduction granted by your draconic grafts.

For example, if you have resilient scales and dragonheart

presence, you would have DR 2/magic (as if you had three

draconic grafts).

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, resist energy, 35,000 gp,

2,800 XP, 70 days.

Donor: A sample of scaled skin from a living dragon

that has immunity to an energy type.

Sacri  ce: 6 hp.

SMASHING TAIL

You sprout a muscular, scaled tail with which you can

smash enemies. You must be of Medium size or larger to

receive a smashing tail graft.

Location: Legs.

Description: The tail has the same coloration as the

dragon from which the graft was taken. It also sports

the normal ornamentation of that tail (fins, spikes, and

so on).

Activation: Using a smashing tail in combat requires

an attack action, or is part of a full attack action if you are

using multiple weapons.

Effect: Your tail can make a secondary slam attack that

deals damage as a dragon one size category larger than

you (1d8 for a Medium creature), adding 1-1/2 times your

Strength bonus to the damage.

Your tail also provides you with a +2 bonus on Balance

checks and Swim checks.

Price: 30,000 gp.

TALONED ARM

One of your arms is sheathed in a dragons  esh, which

gives you a natural claw attack.

Location: Arms.

Description: A taloned arm has sharp, curved claws and

is scaled in the same color as the dragon that supplied the

graft. It looks more bulky than your original arm, although

the graft does not actually increase your Strength.

The scales of a taloned arm become smaller and  ner

toward your upper arm, fading entirely into the surround-

ing skin color at the shoulder.

Activation: Using this draconic graft in combat requires

an attack action, or is part of a full attack action if you are

using multiple weapons.

Effect: You can use a taloned arm to make a secondary

claw attack that deals damage as a dragon of your size (1d6

for a Medium creature). When making a full attack, you

can attack with your claw in addition to any other attacks

you make.

Construction: Wyrmgrafter, magic fang, 17,000 gp,

1,360 XP, 34 days.

Donor: A single claw from a dragon.

BOOLDIPDOPS HIDEOUT

Booldipdop was an acolyte in the temple of Blibdoolpoolp

for several years, but found that service to the Sea Mother

was not enough. He resented the in uence of the whips

and sought for ways to increase his own power, perhaps

even to encourage a rebellion against the state religion.

He studied aquatic dragons, looking for ways to steal some

of their power.

One day about ten years ago, a drow trading party came

to his community with a rare treasure: the egg of a black

dragon, nearly ready to hatch. Booldipdop lobbied hard

for the temple to purchase it, arguing that the dragon

could be reared as a fearsome defender of the Sea Mothers

house and of her people. He asked to be responsible for

its rearing and even offered some precious black pearls in

partial payment.

The temple elders  nally agreed, and Booldipdop was

allotted a special cell within which he could rear the

dragon. Within a month, however, he disappeared from the

temple with the egg. A submerged volcanic cave became

his laboraory and hatchery, and there he continued his

research and experimentation into draconic grafts. The

black dragon, successfully hatched and now grown to

very young age, has become his devoted companion (and

an unwitting donor of tissue samples).

When Booldipdop  ed the temple of the Sea Mother,

he had already begun preparation of his hideout and work

space.  He  discovered  a  well-hidden,  sizable  tunnel  and

cave under the overhang of a marine cliff, partly obscured

by coral reefs. The cave was originally inhabited by a

monstrous moray eel, but Booldipdop was able to kill the

creature and take over the lair.

The  cave  entrance  is  dif cult  to  notice  (Spot  DC  25)

because of a heavy overgrowth of coral. This reef already

existed when Booldipdop arrived, but he transplanted

more coral from other nearby areas. Now, the entrance is

a tight squeeze for creatures larger than Small (including

Booldipdop himself).

Cave

Long ago, this region of the sea bottom had been volcani-

cally  active,  and  gases  rising  up  through   ssures  and

vents had formed a large bubble that also forced up the

sea bottom overhead. Now Booldipdops grafted sharks

inhabit the space. The cave exit is too narrow for them

to negotiate, as is the entrance to the lab. Fish can swim

in, though, which provides adequate food for the sharks,

and their diet is occasionally supplemented by careless

intruders. The sharks are of opposite sexes; Booldipdop

collects any young that result from their mating, using the

offspring for tissue samples and to breed future generations

of guardian beasts.

Lab

Booldipdop modified the original volcanic vent into a

suitable laboratory space using stone shape spells. This

area also serves as his living quarters. A secret door in

the ceiling (Spot DC 20) connects to a volcanic fissure

that serves as an emergency exit. The exterior opening

of  the   ssure  is  well  hidden  (Spot  DC  25)  by  another

overgrown coral reef.

Hatcheries

These small chambers have been sculpted from bubbles in

the original volcanic vent and  tted with stone doors. Black

dragon eggs need to be immersed in strong acid to hatch

successfully, so each hatchery contains a stone vat that can

be sealed to prevent contamination of the surrounding water.

The black dragon, which Booldipdop named Sventvutha, will-

ingly provides acid for this purpose. One hatchery currently

has an occupant: a black dragon egg in its second quarter of

incubation. It will be ready to hatch in about 300 days.

The old volcanic vent has been sealed off, leaving a stone

wall 10 feet thick. on the other side of the wall, the vent

descends untold thousands of feet into the earth.

he various races of the dragon present widely

varying  approaches  to  a  campaign.  Dragon-

born exist as part of a great struggle between

deities.  Spellscales  are  rare  individuals  born

from draconic sorcerous power. A hardscrabble

kobold mining community is a very different

background from a nomadic encampment of dragon-

descended creatures and their allies.

The various races of the dragon are not easily brought

together or introduced into a party of adventurers who

do not share their heritage. Social or racial prejudice,

ignorance, and misunderstanding can hinder the for-

mation of a trusting relationship. In a typical adventure

or campaign, the player characters start out together

with the assumption that they have already met previ-

ously. Its possible to have a dragon-descended character

start out with the other PCs in this way and not worry

about the dif culties that this approach might pres-

ent, but having a party of humanoid characters come

across and embrace a dragonblooded creature can be

an interesting adventure in itself.

DRAGONBORN

IN A CAMPAIGN

The transformative dragonborn race integrates seam-

lessly into any sort of existing campaign that includes

evil dragon kind. The dragonborn arise in response

to an increase in the numbers and force of the spawn

of Tiamat. Those called by Bahamut can be of any

humanoid race. They are relatively few in number. The

bravery and sacri ce needed to become a dragonborn

means that most of those who hear Bahamuts call

decline. However, since player characters tend to

be extraordinary individuals, its likely that one or

more of your players may want to undergo the Rite of

Rebirth. Dragonborn provide a unique opportunity

for a PC to change his race.

INTRODUCING A

DRAGONBORN CHARACTER

An important part of introducing the dragonborn

race into a campaign is offering the player char-

acters the opportunity to transform. One method

is to have the PCs meet a dragonborn who is

questing to slay an evil dragon. Perhaps the PCs

encounter a dragonborn with her team while they

are buying adventuring supplies at the local market.

Theyre likely to be curious about this new race. Shell

happily talk about her former life as a dwarf and the

grand purpose she is now ful lling, telling them,  133

10/25/05   12:22:39 PM

10/25/05   12:22:39 PM

that they too can become dragonborn. A more exciting

alternative is for the PCs to happen upon a dragonborn

in the middle of a  ght with a black dragon. If the PCs

 ght against the evil dragon, Bahamut may call to them

the next time they sleep, trance, or meditate.

SAMPLE DRAGONBORN NPCS

The following two characters can be used as examples of

typical dragonborn. These individuals were born and lived

for a time as members of other races. That experience usu-

ally shapes their identities as signi cantly as their eventual

rebirth as one of Bahamuts children.

Dragonborn Barbarian (CR 4)

Grug grew up in a very primitive tribe of human barbar-

ians. Even among them, he was far from the smartest of

individuals. After he left his tribe and began traveling

and adventuring, Grug met a mighty half-orc barbarian

named Krusk whom he greatly admired. He went with

Krusk  and  some  of  his  friends  to  fight  kobolds  and

goblins in a great sunken fortress. He saw how power-

ful even a Tiny white dragon could be. Grug thought

that he would like to fight tougher opponentsbigger,

badder dragons.

One day, Grug met Vythjhankinitially misidentify-

ing her as an oversized kobold. After they cleared up the

misunderstanding and bandaged each others wounds,

Vythjhank told Grug of her great quest and how Bahamut

had  transformed  her  into  a  mighty  dragon blooded

dragon hunter. That night, Grug prayed to Bahamut and

asked  to  be  transformed.  So  began  Grugs  new  life  as

a dragonborn.

SPELLSCALES

IN A CAMPAIGN

Spellscales  t well into almost any campaign. The history

of the race can vary according to the needs of the DM.

While the overall population of spellscales in any cam-

paign should be much lower than that of other humanoid

races, the race might have been  rst evident a millennia

ago, perhaps misidenti ed for a long time as half-dragons

or draconic creatures. Spellscales could optionally be a

much newer entry in the history of the world, but even so

its possible for several generations to have been born, so

that enough spellscales exist to form communities.

INTRODUCING A

SPELLSCALE CHARACTER

A player starting a new character might choose to create

a spellscale sorcerer, emphasizing the races bloodline

propensities. Alternatively, he might decide to play against

type and try life as a very rare nonsorcerer spellscale. Either

way, he could easily want to link up with other player

characters to better adventure or explore the world.

If youre running a campaign in which family, marriage,

and children play a role, perhaps the player characters  rst

encounter spellscales when one is born to a sorcerer PC

or a relative of such a character.

The changeable nature of a spellscales viewpoint means

that someone who was seen as an enemy in the past might

be considered a good ally in the future, and vice versa. It

might be intriguing for player characters to encounter

a spellscale for a second time after he has had a radical

change in philosophy.

SAMPLE SPELLSCALE NPCS

The  following  two  characters  can  be  used  as  examples

of typical dragonborn. Each of them has a strong racial

proclivity toward sorcery.

Dominique Wilhemina (CR 5)

Dominique is in quite a dif cult situation. While explor-

ing some old crypts under an abandoned cemetery, she

encountered and was defeated by a necromancer and

his undead minions. The necromancer did not kill her.

Instead, he demanded that she acquire the heart of a celes-

tial creature and bring it to him. He holds Whisperscale,

Dominiques viper familiar, as a hostage. He has threatened

to kill Whisperscale if Dominique doesnt return with the

item within a week.

Dominique is desperate. She has tried different tactics

such as summoning a monster to cut out its heart, but,

of course the heart disappears when the creature dies.

She  doesnt  especially  want  to  hunt  down  and  kill  a

celestial, but doesnt feel as though she has an alterna-

tive. She eagerly enlists the PCs help if they happen to

encounter her.

Aiden Spellmaster (CR 9)

Aiden exudes an aura of cheerful self-con dence. He con-

siders himself the consummate master of spells, knowing a

great deal about both divine and arcane magic. As a cleric,

he has the Knowledge and Travel domains. Currently, he

feels a close af nity to Aasterinian, but he does not worship

any particular deity.

Nowadays,  Aiden  is  a  very  gregarious  individual,

easygoing and charming. This is a drastic change for him

from a mere decade ago, when he was going through a

very dark, cruel phase. His life right now is interesting

because his past often catches up to him, with former

adversaries seeking revenge for prior wrongdoings or

sadistic deeds.

DRAGON-DESCENDED PCS

Since a half-dragon or draconic character has a level adjust-

ment, he or she might not be able to join a group of player

characters right away, but must wait until the party level is

compatible with the characters ECL. In such a situation,

a dragon-descended characters  rst meeting with a party

might take the form of an encounterand not necessarily

a friendly one.

Here are some ideas for a DM looking to introduce a

dragon-descended PC into a group of adventurers. Its a

good idea to work with the player of the prospective party

member to come up with a situation that  ts in well with

her character concept.

THE CHALLENGE

A ferocious half-dragon barbarian blocks the road that the

PCs must travel on the way to a mission or when returning

from an adventure. The barbarian demands that the partys

champion face him in single combat. The  ght is not to

the death; rendering the opponent helpless or extracting

an admission of defeat is suf cient.

The barbarian feels a need to prove his worth whenever

possible, having been reared in a society that values strength

above all, and  ghting is what hes best at. He likewise

respects only strength, and thus isnt likely to be persuaded

from his challenge by mere words.

If he wins the battle, the barbarian boasts and demands

that the PCs acknowledge his prowess. If they dont, he

insists that another challenger face him, or else they must

pay him a large bribe. If the barbarian is bested in combat,

he does not surrender and must be rendered unconscious-

ness. If he is defeated and revived by the PCs, he expresses

humility before a greater warrior and offers his sword arm

in service.

This  sort  of  encounter  can  be  tricky  to  run.  If  the

players know a new character is being created, the temp-

tation to indulge in metagame thinking can interfere

with the intended result. If the PCs in your campaign

are the type who attack first and ask questions later, or

slaughter everything they come across, that brand-new

character might not survive his first meeting with them.

You might have to emphasize the nonlethal nature of the

combat in this case. Characters who prefer to negotiate

rather than fight are likely to resist being railroaded into

a confrontationyou might suggest that the barbarian

a little more receptive to bribes or bargains, if that is

the case.

THE UNWILLING EXAMPLE

The PCs come to an unfamiliar town, where the cleric

wishes to visit the temple of his deity or the wizard seeks

ADVENTURE IDEAS

Getting a campaign started can sometimes be the most difficult

step for a Dungeon Master. All that is often needed is a simple

concept to spark even more ideas in unexpected directions. Feel

free to either select a draconic campaign idea from among those

described here or determine one at random.

cannot leave her lair to seek her missing lover.

9192  Rumors of a promised land for the children of

dragons are racing through the countryside. But those

who undertake the journey disappear mysteriously

only days after leaving.

9394  Draconic nymphs are taking a more proactive approach

to  protecting  their  wild  lands,  blinding  anyone  who

comes within an arbitrary distance.

9596  A beholder wyrmgrafter has given itself a number of

9798  A scaled child beset by bullies cried outand burned

10/25/05   12:22:50 PM

10/25/05   12:22:50 PM

an arcane school or library for research. While in the

temple, library, or similar institution, that character sees

a hooded or veiled individual being hustled along the cor-

ridors by several acolytes or apprentices. The mysterious

individual seems to be very important, and the escorts

appear  nervous.  The  character  catches  a  glimpse  of  a

scaled face as the group hurries by. Inquiries to the staff

are answered with evasive statements that nevertheless

convey the idea that this individual has great power. As

the character leaves the building, he again sees the scaled

face at a window, its eyes  lled with despair, or perhaps

it is silently mouthing a request for aid.

The mysterious figure is a half-dragon who has been

taken into the service of the temple or assigned to the

academy because her heritage and her innate magical

prowess have marked her as special. She is not happy with

her lot, which is a lonely one, and is looking for a chance

to escape.

This encounter works well for campaigns in which play-

ers are quick to pick up on clues and investigate unusual

situations. Its also good for soft-hearted characters who

cant resist helping someone in distress. It can bore more

combat-oriented groups, however, and those who are oblivi-

ous to social situations might never notice the intended

adventure hook.

THE WANDERING PRIEST

This kind of encounter works best with a dragon-descended

character who is on the path to becoming a Singer of Con-

cordance. The party meets a wandering cleric of Io while

traveling or in a town. Alternatively, the wandering priest

happens upon the PCs in the midst of a dif cult encounter

and  lends  assistance.  The  priest  is  an  earnest  sort  who

wants to bring the peace of Io to any dragonkind char-

acters in the group. He might suggest traveling together

for mutual support while he brings the good news to Ios

children to the world.

This setup allows lots of roleplaying opportunity for the

wandering clerics player, but a risk exists that the character

might become boring or irritating to the others. The cleric

may have to take a more pragmatic and less missionary

attitude to be accepted into the group.

THE INNOCENT VICTIM

This can be a heavy-handed and obvious hook, but it

is often an effective one. The PCs come across a scene

of injustice, such as a draconic half-orc being publicly

whipped for a crime she didnt commit, or a half-dragon

human  youth  cornered  and  beaten  by  bullies.  Much

pathos ensues, and only the most hard-hearted charac-

ters (or their players) can ignore the plight of someone

so wronged. If they intervene, the rescued victim pleads

to join the party.

If your players resent being emotionally manipulated or

being led down an obvious path, this kind of setup isnt a

good idea. Consider making the injustice more subtle in

this case; for example, a customer in an inn who is point-

edly not being served, even though the PCs are the only

others in the place.

THE DRAGON-DESCENDED

CAMPAIGN

Another way to get around the problem of incorporat-

ing dragon-descended characters is for an entire party

to share draconic blood. To account for the high ECLs

of half-dragons, such a party should start at 4th or 5th

level.  This  group  might  be  a  mix  of  characters  with

small or no level adjustments, such as spellscales and

kobolds, who have several class levels, as well as 1st-level

half-dragon characters.

A group composed entirely of dragon-descended char-

acters faces unique problems when making its way in the

world. One monster in a group of otherwise normal

characters might be grudgingly accepted, but an entire

party of inhuman beasts will have trouble in some places.

On the other hand, such a mix of unusual talents might

bring interesting assignments that arent easy for ordinary

characters to complete.

A DRAGON-DESCENDED

ENCAMPMENT

Half-dragons and draconic companions occasionally form

traveling encampments for mutual support. Described

here is a typical example of such an encampment.

Covered Wagons

Each of these vehicles has sturdy, wooden-slatted sides

and an oiled canvas roof. Some travelers like to paint

their wagons with bright colors and designs, but many

prefer to keep a low profile and choose colors that blend

in with the surrounding terrain. Every wagon is warded

with a permanent audible alarm spell that is activated

if  the  interior  is  penetrated  in  any  way  without  the

owners permission.

Corral

The wagons are generally drawn by oxen or occasion-

ally heavy horses. Sometimes these beasts of burden

are draconic. They are kept in this enclosure at night

while the encampment is on the move. During longer

stays  in  one  place,  the  owners  turn  their  beasts  out

to forage during the day and herd them back into the

corral at dusk.

Tents

Some members of the traveling group are even more

transient than the rest. A half-dragon wanderer might

pitch a tent or just lay out a bedroll, stay for a day or two,

then move on while the encampment lingers for a season.

Hangers-on and temps (craftworkers who service the

encampment during its limited time in a location) also

set up tent shelters here.

Central Cooking Fire

This is where communal meals are prepared, usually

by one of the camp followers. The fire is kept banked

low  in  between  meals  but  is  not  allowed  to  go  out

completely.

Beast Cages

One  member  of  this  encampment  makes  a  living  as  a

sideshow manager, exhibiting draconic creatures to the

yokels. His prized possession is a half-green dragon dire

wolfa dangerous beast he keeps in its own magically

warded  cage.  The  bars  of  the  cage  are  ensorcelled  with

protection from energy spells to avoid injury to spectators.

Path

The path to the main road is hidden with underbrush, so it

is not obvious to passersby. The encampment dwellers do

not want to be disturbed or accused of shocking decent

folks with their obvious strangeness.

SAMPLE DRAGON-DESCENDED NPCS

The following  ve characters can be used as examples of

typical half-dragon and draconic characters. Where noted,

they use the optional racial substitution levels presented

in Chapter 6.

Wall Walking (Ex) Can walk freely on tunnel walls and

ceilings.

Underdark Tunnels

Elthora spends very little time in her native city, being

much more comfortable roaming about underground.

She has established a base camp in a limestone cavern, in

the center of which is a pool of drip water. One side of the

cave slopes gently to the shore of the pool, and its smooth

 oor makes a suitable campsite. Phosphorescent lichens

on the cave wall provide shadowy illumination.

The cave has been penetrated by purple worm burrows

that  enter  and  exit  though  the  ceiling,   oor,  and  sides.

Once  purple  worms  have  passed  through  an  area  and

consumed  everything  in  their  path,  they  move  on  and

do  not  return.  Their  burrows  therefore  make  excellent

habitats and transportation routes.

Clusters of giant mushrooms grow beside the pool and

on ledges around the burrow entrances. Water from the

pool trickles in a thin stream down one of the tunnels.

Elthora patrols through these tunnels regularly. She

takes advantage of her mounts wall walking ability to

ride about on the ceilings of tunnels as much as possible,

hoping to surprise intruders.

Half-Dragon Wizard (EL 9)

Angriz Ulhargix is the unhappy result of a union between

a blue dragon and a half-orc. He has managed to avoid

con ict and keep to himself enough to be grudgingly

allowed to stay in a city, where he has taken possession of

an abandoned guard tower that was part of the old city wall.

(He also produces a desirable magic item, Angrizs chest, that

makes his presence more welcome in town.)

He experiments on alchemical projects and crafts magic

items, only occasionally venturing out to trade for needed

goods. His inventions are sought by adventurers, but visits

to the shop are by appointment only. He prefers to pay

others to acquire materials for him.

KOBOLDS IN A

DRACONIC CAMPAIGN

Kobolds might not seem like the most racially tolerant

humanoids, but theyre not without their charms. Its true,

kobolds have destructive impulses toward gnomes. Yes,

their primary deity hates all races except for kobolds. Sure,

the majority of kobolds are lawful evil in nature. Putting

all that aside for the moment, once you look beneath the

surface, you might see that most kobolds are not evil by

nature, but rather by reaction.

It  is  only  through  enduring  mistreatment  and  being

looked down upon that kobolds have become the revenge-

seeking scions they are today. When putting a Draconic

campaign  together,  especially  one  that  involves  non-

draconic  races,  any  problem  can  be  solved  by  giving

kobolds their space, respecting their culture, and never

disparaging themnot even in jest. If you really want to

befriend kobolds, let them come to you.

OUT OF THEIR ELEMENT

Once you remove a kobold from his lair and give him

a  chance  to  interact  with  other  cultures,  he  either

seeks the fastest possible route back to his tribe or he

decides to linger a while. A kobold who stays behind

in a foreign culture might initially justify his decision

as  an  opportunity  to  study  the  weaknesses  of  his

enemies,  only  to  discover  that  those  weaknesses  are

actually benefits.

The result of mingling with individuals who do not

automatically consider kobolds hostile, such as potential

adventuring companions, can have a surprising effect

on individual kobolds. Instincts of servitude start to

wane as their personality emerges for the  rst time. Even

kobolds who would rather return home but cannot due

to  circumstance  often   nd  themselves  enjoying  the

freedom of individuality.

One quality that all kobolds share is their desire to

be an active member of a working family, which makes

them well suited to adventuring groups. Elves, hal ings,

half-orcs, humans, and even dwarves can become exten-

sions of a kobolds racial family. The same does not hold

true  for  gnomesno  matter  how  much  time  passes

in a relationship between a gnome and a Kurtulmak-

worshiping kobold, the very best that can be hoped for

is a vicious rivalry.

A kobold who worships Io is a different matter. Such

kobolds are very different from those who worship Kur-

tulmak. They already value their individuality, do not

mind keeping their own company, and do not harbor ill

will toward any particular race. Io-worshiping kobolds

deliberately expose themselves to creatures that would

normally evoke their racial ire (such as gnomes) in order

to challenge their own preconceptions. Their goal is to

perceive all races with objectivity, in the same way that

Io accepts draconic worshipers of all alignments.

IN THEIR ELEMENT

Unlike with typical heroes, a party composed entirely

of kobolds is not always motivated by the acquisition

of wealth. Instead, the stakes for kobold adventurers

can include such motivations as locating a lair to save a

wandering kobold tribe from extinction, gaining access

to resources that have been cut off by dwarf occupation,

or defending unborn eggs from heroic adventurers who

treat their lairs as playgrounds.

Its easy to justify kobolds tactics when they are on

the  receiving  end  of  an  attack,  but  kobolds  are  also

more than a little guilty of taking the offensive when

gnomes are present. Still, not all kobolds allow racial

hatred  to  rule  their  actions,  specifically  those  who

worship Io. These kobolds contribute no less than any

other hardworking member of the lair, but are largely

misunderstood by their kin. While Io-worshiping kobolds

are not openly mocked, most kobolds fail to grasp their

beliefs,  even  while  simultaneously  respecting  their

acknowledged creator.

From the reverse perspective, Io-worshipers feel both

connected to other kobolds and distant at the same time,

regarding the kobolds preoccupation with revenge as an

expenditure of energy that could be more effectively used

to broaden their arcane knowledge.Kobolds who worship

Io are the most likely to leave their lairs for the sake of

acquiring new experiences.

KOBOLD SETTLEMENTS

Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide offers a system

for  generating  towns  that  falls  short  of  defining  the

dynamics of a kobold lair. For instance, a kobold lair is

structured without a traditional class system, so neither

aristocrats nor commoners are present. Kobold experts

who specialize in mining make up most of a settlements

population. To create a kobold settlement, use the fol-

lowing guidelines.

Referring to kobold settlements as thorps, hamlets,

or villages is misleading, since their lairs bear only the

most rudimentary similarities to such communities.

1 Adult population. In kobold lairs, the number of nonadults

ranges from 40% to 60% of the adult population.

2 Kobold lairs differ from the Random Town Generation

table (DMG 137) in that jewelry, precious stones, and rare

metal trade goods are five times the given gp limit for a

kobold lair of a given size. In other words, a kobold burrow

which would normally have a 1,200 gp limit on items

that can be bought, sold, or exchangedhas a 6,000 gp

limit for jewelry, precious stones, and rare metal trade

goods. Any other goods or trade items are held to the

regular gold piece limit for a lair of that size.

Most  of  the  kobolds  in  a  lair  are  crammed  together

near the largest concentration of underground springs.

The highest level, closest to the surface, is reserved for

warriors who defend the lair while the lowest level is

occupied  by  experts,  all  of  whom  are  funded  by  the

lair to assist mining effortsthe sustaining force of a

kobold economy.

The  wealth  accumulated  by  a  kobold  settlement  is

funneled  into  two  areas  of  kobold  society:  feeding  and

supplying the lair, and lining the hordes of dragons (see

The Kobold Economy, page 51).

ADVENTURING IN

KOBOLD SETTLEMENTS

Depending on the amount of metal and precious stones

waiting to be mined out of the ground nearby, a kobold

lair in ates in size accordingly. The larger a deposit, the

longer kobolds remain in a particular lair. The longer

kobolds remain in one place, the more they adorn their

lairs with objects of draconic history. In the same way

that kobolds never forget a grudge, their long memories

serve them equally well when recording the stories of

their ancestors.

A kobold lair is almost always ruled by a lawful evil

all-watcher who is frequently one part miner, one part

merchant,  and  one  part  sorcerer.  Settlements  led  by

lawful neutral leaders are not without precedent, and

lawful good settlements are the least common among

the  three  lawful  alignments.  Chaotic  power  centers

rarely maintain discipline long enough to profit from

mining.  and  so  they  rely  on  traps  and  warbands  for

survival.  Neutral  power  centers  are  wholly  devoted

to  Io  and  the  acquisition  of  knowledge,  taking  up

residence in abandoned kobold mines still rich with

runic history.

Characters who are discovered in ltrating a lawful evil

kobold lair can expect an immediate retreat by the resi-

dents, followed by a prompt regrouping in significantly

larger numbers. Kobolds keep most of the passage ways

into their lairs hidden while trapping the more obvious

entranceways.

KOBOLD MINE

The map on this page shows the layout of a typical kobold

mine (and one that has plenty of room for expansion).

Kobold mining crews (marked 1 on the map) work

constantly at digging fresh ore out of the tunnels as

they excavate farther into the earth. Cart crews (2) haul

the ore from the mining site under the watchful eye

of adept supervisors (3) and transport it to the elevator

(4) so it can be taken to the surface. As the miners dig

deeper,  the  walls  of  the  mine  tunnels  are  shored  up

with wooden support beams (5). Other piles of lumber

(6) are stacked near the elevator; as this supply is used,

it is replenished with other wood brought down from

the surface.

Appendix: The

Draconic Language

The language of dragons is one of the oldest forms of com-

munication. According to the wyrms, it is second only

to the languages of the outsiders, and all mortal tongues

are descended from it. Its script was likely created long

after its spoken form was standardized, as dragons have

less need to write than other races. Some scholars believe

Draconic script might have been in uenced by Dwarven

runes, but the wise dont express this opinion within

hearing of a dragon.

Many reptilian races use crude versions of Draconic,

including lizardfolk and troglodytes. It is likely that these

races were once taught or enslaved by dragons, and it is

even possible that they took Draconic for their own simply

to make a claim to common ancestry. The Draconic script is

also used when a written form is needed for the elemental

languages of Auran and Ignan. Despite this commonality,

it is no easier for someone who knows Draconic to learn

the languages of air and  re creatures.

Slight variations exist in the dialect of Draconic that

is used by the various kinds of chromatic dragons. These

differences are similar to regional accents. They form no

impediment to understanding, but they are suf ciently

obvious for a native speaker to know whether someone

learned to speak Draconic from a red or green dragon. The

various metallic dragons all have similar accents, but the

chromatic dragons each have their own slight differences

in pronunciation. In general, Draconic has not changed

signi cantly for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

Draconic sounds harsh to most other creatures and

includes  numerous  hard  consonants  and  sibilants.  It

includes sounds that humans generally describe as hissing

(sj, ss, and sv) as well as a noise that sounds a great deal like

a beast clearing its throat (ach).

Words that modify other words can be placed before or

after the word they modify. The most important modi er

is always placed before, and it might be placed directly after

as well if additional emphasis on the modi er is desired.

A speaker of Draconic who wanted to say a big, black, evil

dragon was approaching, but wanted the fact that it was

evil more than anything else might say, Malsvir darastrix

turalisj vutha gethrisj leirith or even Malsvir darastrix

turalisj vutha malsvir gethrisj leirith.

Most  Draconic  words  have  emphasis  placed  on  the

 rst syllable. Important ideas are emphasized in spoken

Draconic  by  stressing  the  beginning  and  end  of  the

word. In the written form, important words are marked

with  a  special  symbol  of  six  lines  radiating  outward,

similar to an asterisk (*). This device is most often used

by dragons when referring to themselves. The dragon

Karajix  would  pronounce  his  name  KA-raj-IX,  and  it

would be written *Karajix*. This emphasis is also some-

times used when commanding, threatening, warning,

or making a point.

Draconic has no speci c word for my or mine, instead

using several pre xes depending on the exact meaning. A

physical object claimed as a possession by a dragon speaker

would begin with veth or vethi, an individual with a

relationship  to  the  dragon  (such  as  a  friend  or  relative)

begins with er or ethe, and all other forms of possessive-

ness are represented by putting ar or ari before a word.

Thus for a dragon to say my sword or the sword is mine

he need only say vethicaex, and arirlym translates as my

enemy. When indicating possession by another, combine

the name of the possessor with the object possessed into

a single word that starts with ar or ari.

Appendix:

Dragon Deities

The dragon deities are all children of Io, the Ninefold

Dragon who encompasses all the opposites and extremes

of dragonkind.

You dont have to be a dragon to worship one of these dei-

ties, though most of their worshipers are. Just as a human

weaponsmith might venerate Moradin, or an elf archer

pay homage to Ehlonna, so too could a dwarf, half-orc, or

hal ing worship a god or goddess otherwise associated

with dragons. In fact, such worship is particularly common

among the various reptilian (and Draconic-speaking) races,

such as kobolds, lizardfolk, and troglodytes.

The deity descriptions in this appendix are expanded

from a similar presentation in Chapter 1 of Draconomicon.

These descriptions supersede previous versions.

READING THE DEITY ENTRIES

The  rst section of text contains basic information about

the deity.

Name: The  rst line gives the name by which the deity

is generally known. Other names or titles attributed to the

deity (if any) are given immediately below the name.

Rank: This entry gives the gods divine rank, either

demigod, lesser, or intermediate.

Symbol:  A  short  description  of  the  holy  or  unholy

symbol carried by the deitys clerics. This symbol is often

used on altars or other items dedicated to the deity.

Home Plane: The portion of the cosmos where the

deity chie y resides. If you dont use the core cosmology

presented in the Manual of the Planes, feel free to change

these home planes as appropriate to your campaign.

Alignment:  The  deitys  alignment.  Deities  follow

the same alignments as mortals do; see Chapter 6 of the

Players Handbook.

Portfolio: The aspects of mortal existence with which

the deity is most often associated. Portfolio elements are

listed roughly in their order of importance to the deity.

Worshipers:  Those  who  worship  or  venerate  the

deity, roughly in order of their number and importance

to the deity.

Cleric Alignments: What alignments the deitys clerics

can have. As noted in the Players Handbook, a cleric typi-

cally has the same alignment as his deity. Some clerics are

one step away from their respective deitys alignment. For

example, most clerics of Heironeous (who is lawful good)

are lawful good themselves, but some are lawful neutral or

neutral good. A cleric cannot be neutral unless his deity

is neutral.

Two alignments are within one step of each other if they

appear adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically on

the following chart. Alignments that are adjacent to each

other on a diagonal are not within one step.

Lawful good

Lawful neutral

Lawful evil

Neutral good

Neutral

Neutral evil

Chaotic good

Chaotic neutral

Chaotic evil

Some deities do not accept clerics of all alignments that

are within one step of their own. For example, Bahamut,

a lawful good deity, only has lawful good and neutral

good clerics.

Domains:  Clerics  of  the  deity  can  choose  from

among the domains listed here. Domains marked with

an asterisk (Dragon, Greed and Wealth) are found in

Draconomicon.

Domains  presented  inside  brackets  are  found  in  the

FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting. If your campaign is

set in that world, you can add these domains to the gods

list (possibly replacing other domains if desired).

Favored Weapon: What weapon the deity favors. The

deitys clerics generally prefer to use such weapons, and

certain spells that clerics cast, such as spiritual weapon, can

have effects that resemble this weapon.

All favored weapon entries for these deities have two

listings. The first is for weapon-wielding clerics, while

the weapon in parentheses is for dragon clerics who use

natural attacks rather than manufactured weapons.

DESCRIPTIVE TEXT

Immediately following the line-item deity entries is infor-

mation about what the deity looks like and other general

facts. Sections address speci c aspects of how the deity is

worship such as its clergy, temples, and prayers.

GAME STATISTICS

This product doesnt have the scope to address specific

game  statistics  and  divine  powers  for  these  deities.

Game statistics for Bahamut and Tiamat are presented

in Deities and Demigods. Use that book to create game

statistics for the other dragon deities here if you desire

such information.

Dogma

Aasterinian  is  flighty  and  quick-witted.  She  encour-

ages her followers to think for themselves, rather than

relying  on  the  word  of  others.  The  worst  crime,  in

Aasterinians eyes, is not trusting in yourself and your

own devices.

Clergy

Aasterinians clerics are typically wanderers who travel in

disguise or secrecy. The majority of her clerics are draconic

or half-dragon humanoids. Spellscales who become clerics

often  nd Aasterinian the most compatible deity

for them.

Her followers enjoy friendly relations with

those of Garl Glittergold, Fharlanghn, Olidam-

mara, and similar deities.

Quests

Aasterinians quests are more variable than

most other deities tasks. Theres no pre-

dicting what shell ask of her follower.

Almost all involve travel and new ex-

periences, though. The quests upon

which she sends a supplicant tend

to focus more on the journey than

the destination.

Prayers

Aasterinian  values  diversity  of

experience, learning, and inno-

vation. Prayers to her often take

the form of expressions of desire for

change. One daily prayer is Let today

differ from both yesterday and tomorrow,

expressing a desire for new experiences.

rest peacefully during their travels. The architecture of

such shrines is generally simple, with building designs

that  emphasize  functionality  and  comfort.  A  shrine

typically has a library, or at least a shelf holding a few

miscellaneous books, with a sign indicating that travel-

ers are welcome to take a book if they leave one book to

replace it.

Rites

Every time a worshiper learns or creates something new, he

is honoring Aasterinian. Whether laughing with pleasure,

smiling with delight, or sighing with contentment, the

Messengers followers remember their god.

Herald and Allies

Aasterinians herald on the Material Plane is an ancient

brass dragon with a turquoise-sheened forehead bear-

ing a golden star in the center. Her allies are chaotic or

neutral dragons, half-dragons, and draconic creatures

of all sorts.

ASTILABOR

The Acquisitor, the Hoardmistress

Lesser Deity

Symbol: A 12-faceted gem

Home Plane: Outlands

Alignment: Neutral

Portfolio: Acquisitiveness, status, wealth

Worshipers: Dragonbloods, those who seek wealth

Cleric Alignments: NG, LN, N, CN, NE

Domains:  Dragon*,  Protection,  Wealth*  [Cavern,

Metal]

Favored Weapon: Scimitar (claw)

Astilabor represents the natural draconic desire

to acquire treasure and power. She dislikes the

naked greed displayed by Tiamat

and her followers. She appears as

a Huge dragon who shimmers

with all the chromatic and metal-

lic colors of dragonkind.

Dogma

Astilabor values wealth and power,

but  without  any  stigma  of  greed.

She  instills  in  dragonkind  the

innate need for collecting and pro-

tecting the hoard. She claims that

she cannot abide theft of any kind

from her worshipers, but often turns

a blind eye if such acts are performed

in the name of building ones hoard.

Clergy

Astilabor accepts only clerics with an el-

ement  of  neutrality  in  their  alignment,  the

better to remain pure to the goal of acquiring

and protecting the hoard. Her clerics prefer

not to become involved in con icts between

dragons, but often reward those whose hoards

become large and valuable.

Bahamut is revered in many locales.

Though  all  good-aligned  dragons

pay homage to Bahamut, gold, sil-

ver,  and  brass  dragons  hold  him

in particularly high regard. Other

dragons, even evil ones (except per-

haps  his  archrival  Tiamat),  respect

Bahamut for his wisdom and power.

In  his  natural  form,  Bahamut  is

a long, sinuous dragon covered in silver-

white scales that sparkle and gleam even in

the dimmest light. Bahamuts catlike eyes are

deep blue, as azure as a midsummer sky, some

say. Others insist that Bahamuts eyes are a frosty

indigo, like the heart of a glacier. Perhaps the

colors  merely  re ect  the  Platinum  Dragons

shifting mood.

Bahamut  is  stern  and  very  disapproving  of  evil.  He

brooks no excuses for evil acts. In spite of this stance, he

is among the most compassionate beings in the multi-

verse. He has limitless empathy for the downtrodden,

the dispossessed, and the helpless. He urges his fol-

lowers to promote the cause of good, but prefers

to let beings  ght their own battles when they

can. To Bahamut, it is better to offer informa-

tion, healing, or a (temporary) safe refuge

rather than to take others burdens upon

oneself.

An  equally  important  aspect  to  Ba-

hamut  is  his  constant  con ict  with  Tiamat.

He  continually  stands  in  opposition  to  her

world-dominating  schemes.  Most  recently,  she

has begun a campaign to heavily populate the world

with her spawn. Bahamut has answered this outbreak

of evil by recruiting stalwart heroes to his sidethe

dragonborn.

In addition to the dragonborn, Bahamut is served

by seven great gold wyrms that often accompany him

when he visits the Material Plane.

Astilabor is revered by dragons of all types and align-

ments,  but  actively  worshiped  by  few.  Most  at  least

scratch out her symbol as a protective ward over their

hoards.

Astilabors  worshipers  are  friendly  toward

those  of  Moradin  and  Garl  Glittergold

(since those gods respect the value

of a gem or coin as much as any-

one), but they distrust followers of

Olidammara, whom they believe to

be thieves at heart.

Quests

Acquiring a specific item of val-

ue or a set amount of gold to add

to ones hoard are the most com-

mon pursuits of the followers of

Astilabor. If a worshiper offends

her,  the  treasures  gained  by  the

quest are turned over to one of her

temples.

Prayers

Prayers to Astilabor are often performed

while counting ones hoard. While running

ones hands or claws through a pile of gold coins,

a worshiper might say, All this gold belongs

to me. May I add to my riches tenfold, ten-

fold times.

Temples

Holy symbol

Dogma

There is a decided tension between Astilabors worship-

ers need to add to their own hoards and their desire to

honor  their  deity.  Temples  to  Astilabor  are  generally

grand structures that are secure and well protected. The

lavish furnishings and accoutrements are typically ob-

jects loaned to the temple by the congregation.

A  temple  might  have  elaborate  platinum

candlesticks  and  wall  sconces  provided

by one dragon and cloth-of-gold wall

hangings  provided  by  another.  The

ownership of each item is made clear

by  some  means,  usually  a  particular

mark engraved on an item or sewn into it.

Rites

Most of Astilabors rites involve a group of suppli-

cants seeking to gain wealth. Some of these groups

resemble traditional adventuring parties.

Herald and Allies

Astilabors  herald  is  a  neutral  19th-level  draconic

human  rogue.  Her  allies  include  dragons,  half-

dragons, and draconic creatures. Sometimes these

allies  have  celestial  or   endish  lineage,  but  even

then those individuals always have a neutral com-

ponent to their alignment.

BAHAMUT

The  Platinum  Dragon,  King  of  the  Good

Holy symbol

of Bahamut

Clergy

Bahamut accepts only good clerics. Clerics of Bahamut,

whether they are dragons, half-dragons, or other beings

attracted to Bahamuts philosophy, strive to take constant

but subtle action on behalf of good, intervening

wherever they are needed but striving to do as

little harm in the process as possible.

10/25/05   12:23:25 PM

Bahamuts  chief  foe  is  Tiamat,  and  this  enmity  is

re ected in the attitude of each deitys worshipers. Follow-

ers of Bahamut respect Heironeous, Moradin, Yondalla,

and other lawful good deities.

Quests

Bahamuts worshipers are most apt to go on a quest to

destroy or stop one of Tiamats spawn. Whenever they have

a reasonable opportunity to do so, followers of Bahamut

act to thwart Tiamat or her minions.

Prayers

Worshipers follow the philosophy that one should pray

with ones deeds, not ones mouth. Each act that promotes

the welfare of good dragonkind or thwarts the depravity

of evil dragonkind is a prayer of action.

Temples

Temples to Bahamut are rare in the extreme. Those that exist

are beautiful, elegant structures with clean, simple lines.

The furnishings of a temple are simple, without embellish-

ment or adornment. The building includes meeting rooms

where followers can gather to worship or to plan their next

campaign against Tiamats spawn, as well as smaller, private

rooms where individuals can pray, meditate, or rest and

recuperate in privacy.

Many gold, silver, and brass dragons maintain simple

shrines to Bahamut in their lairs, usually nothing more

elaborate  than  Bahamuts  symbol  scribed  on  a  wall.

Bahamut is not appreciative of being honored by objects,

emphasizing deeds instead.

Rites

Bahamuts worshipers and clergy dont have formal rituals

or ceremonies. The only activity that one would call a rite

is the Rite of Rebirth (see page 8), by which a humanoid

becomes a dragonborn.

Herald and Allies

Bahamut uses a mature adult celestial gold dragon as his

herald. His allies include good dragons, half-dragons,

draconic creatures, and dragonborn.

If a dragonborn strays from her holy duties, Bahamut

sends one of his aspects to visit her. The aspect endeavors to

talk with the transgressor, and uses reason and diplomacy

to remind her of the commitment she accepted when she

became a dragonborn.

An  aspect  of  Bahamut  is  an  embodiment  of  a  small

portion of the deitys life force. Unlike the much more

powerful avatars of Bahamut, an aspect of Bahamut is not

an extension of the original deity. Rather than extending

the deitys personal self, an aspect is a short-lived echo

of the deitys will, a temporary biological expression of

divine power.

Occasionally an aspect of Bahamut arises spontaneously

on the deitys home plane or a closely related plane. More

often, aspects are called forth on other planes by magic

of some kind, including the planar ally and planar binding

spells or the summon aspect of Bahamut spell (see page 118).

In any case, they are short-lived, usually fading back into

nonexistence within a day.

Aspects of Bahamut are more willing than most divine

aspects to converse with mortals. Their diplomatic skills

are legendary, though they only speak from the position

of superiority due them as representatives of the Master

of the North Wind.

Combat

An aspect of Bahamut is a fantastically intelligent combat-

ant. It is fearless, caring nothing for its continued existence

unless its existence is strategically more important than

the tactical damage it can in ict by  ghting ingeniously to

the death. Its coldly calculated rage, its capacity for  ight,

and its penchant for well-timed counterattacks make it far

more dangerous than a normal dragon, whose anger and

strength in combat are derived in part from its awareness

of its own mortality.

Unless it suits its purposes to be surrounded, an aspect

of Bahamut is quite cagey about picking off its enemies

one by one. Whenever possible, it chooses the battle eld

to prevent its foes from using their strengths and their

prepared spells. Although an aspect cannot cast spells of

its own, it is willing to team up with spellcasting allies who

can provide it with powers that increase its opportunities

for surprise.

Temples

Temples to Chronepsis are usually mausoleums, places for

the dead that the living can visit. They feature dozens or

hundreds of large hourglasses that symbolize the trickling

away of the life spans of dragons. No matter whether a

creature was good, evil, chaotic, lawful, or neutral in

lifein death, all creatures remains are welcome to rest

in Chronepsiss care.

Favored Weapon: Scythe (claw)

Rites

Chronepsis is neutralsilent, unconcerned, and dispas-

sionate. He is the draconic god of fate, death, and judgment.

His form is colorless and without luster, marking him as

an outsider in the struggles between the chromatic and

metallic dragons.

A small ritual part of daily life for worshipers of Chronepsis

is to possess and turn over an hourglass at least once a day

to remind them of their own lives trickling away. Often,

before a follower goes to sleep, she turns over an hourglass

and then spends a moment or two contemplating the

empty glass when she wakes.

Dogma

Herald and Allies

Chronepsis is a passionless observer of the world. He

passes judgment on all dragons when they die, decid-

ing where their souls go in the afterlife. Unlike Lendys

(see  below),  Chronepsis  is  uninterested  in  justicehe

merely observes what is and is not. He is also singularly

uninvolved  in  the  activities  of  the  living,  and  strives

to  remain  so.  It  is  said  that  only  a  cataclysm  of  world-

shaking  proportions  could  move  Chronepsis  from  his

disinterest.

Clergy

Chronepsis  has  very  few  active  worshipers

and even fewer clerics, since most dragons

dont possess the balanced outlook necessary

for  them  to  avoid  interfering  in  the  events

they observe.

The followers of Chronepsis count other

faiths  neither  as  friends  nor  enemies.

Of the other deities, only Boccob the

Uncaring shares a similar outlook, but

neither deity cares enough to forge an

alliance.

Quests

A worshiper of Chronepsis might be tasked

with retrieving the remains of a dead dragonblood

so  they  can  be  interred  in  a  temple.  It  is  also

not unusual for a follower to be sent to attend and

protect a dying dragon.

Prayers

Worshipers  of  Chronepsis  do  not  pray  in

any traditional sense. They know that either

petitions  for  aid  or  praises  of  their  gods

glory  will  go  unanswered  and  unheeded.

Prayer is not necessary, since Chronepsis is not swayed

by  words.  Instead,  worshipers  often  meditate  upon

the cyclical nature of life and death. A common saying,

though none would call it a true prayer, is We begin to

die the day we are born.

Chronepsiss herald is a neutral wyrm black dragon (one

of a rare breed). His allies include neutral dragons, half-

dragons, and draconic creatures of all sorts. Chronepsis

generally does not interfere in events, so his envoys are

extraordinarily rare. If you are using Draconomicon, his

herald is a 3rd-level storm drake cleric. His allies include

battle dragons and all manner of landwyrms (both found

in Draconomicon) .

FALAZURE

The Night Dragon

Lesser Deity

Symbol: Draconic skull

Home Plane: Hades

Alignment: Neutral evil

Portfolio: Decay, undeath, exhaustion

Worshipers: Evil dragons, necromancers,

undead

Cleric Alignments: N, LE, NE, CE

D omains:  Death,  Dragon*,  Evil  [Dark-

ness, Undeath]

Favored Weapon: Scimitar (claw)

The terrifying Night Dragon, Falazure, is the

lord of energy draining, undeath, decay, and

exhaustion. Some claim he has a decaying skeletal

form; others believe that he looks like a superan-

nuated black dragon whose  esh is pulled tight

over his bones.

Holy symbol

of Chronepsis

Dogma

Falazure  teaches  that  even  a  dragons  long

life span need not be the limit to a dragons

existence. Beyond the world of the living is

another realm, one of undeath eternal. It is

generally accepted that Falazure created (or had a hand

in creating) the  rst undead dragons, such as dracoliches,

vampiric dragons, and ghostly dragons (see Chapter 4 of

Draconomicon for descriptions of these creatures).

Clergy

Among the draconic gods, perhaps only Bahamut and

Tiamat have more nondragon worshipers than Falazure.

10/25/05   12:23:30 PM

Many necromancers of all races revere the Night

Dragon, as well as intelligent undead such as

liches and especially dracoliches.

The followers of Falazure count all good-

aligned  faiths  as  their  enemies.  They

occasionally ally with the forces of Nerull,

but such instances are rare.

Quests

Falazures  quests  revolve  around  the

transformation  from  a  living  creature

to  undead  status.  Sometimes  a  follow-

er is sent to aid another dragonbloods

transformation,  but  more  often  a  quest

involves the followers own change to an undead

creature.

Prayers

Devout worshipers of Falazure pray every evening

and  midnight  to  honor  the  Night  Dragon.  Their

prayers  celebrate  death  and  decay.  For  example,

When night comes, let me wake from the sleep, or

Let me die and be reborn in undeath.

Temples

Temples to Falazure are always deep beneath

the earth, cloaked in darkness and far from

the sun and fresh air of the surface world.

Holy symbol

of Falazure

Garyx  the  All-Destroyer  symbolizes  the  sheer

power  and  destructive  force  of  dragonkind.

Some argue that Garyx is actually insane, as

a result of his long residence on the Wind-

swept Depths of Pandemonium. He appears

much like a great wyrm red dragon.

Dogma

Garyx teaches by example, periodically

traveling to the Material Plane to wreak

unholy swaths of destruction across the

landscape. Those who revere follow the

example, using their power to bring ruin

and devastation.

Clergy

Garyx pays little or no attention to his clerics and

worshipers, but they do not care. They believe that

he grants them the power to perform acts of destruc-

tion, and that is enough. Perhaps curiously, some

druids  also  revere  the  renewal  aspect  of  Garyx,

knowing  that  some  devastation  is  always  neces-

sary for rejuvenation.

Garyx shares traits in common with Kord and

Erythnul, but has no interest in alliances.

Quests

Wars, battles, and campaigns of destruction are

Rites

The rites of Falazure focus on the undead. The ceremonies

involve  either  raising  up  undead  minions  or  working

toward transforming oneself into a powerful undead.

Prayers

When lighting a  re, a worshiper of Garyx murmurs a

benison such as Grant me the power to destroy.

Herald and Allies

The most common herald Falazure uses is a 16th-

level half-black dragon necromancer. His allies

include dragons, half-dragons, and draconic

creatures, usually skillful clerics or necroman-

cers.  If  you  are  using  Draconomicon,  his  herald

is  a  vampiric  black  dragon.  His  allies  include

undead dragons of all sorts such as ghostly

dragons,  skeletal  dragons,  and  zombie

dragons (see Draconomicon).

Temples

Few temples to Garyx have been found, though

his worshipers often carve his symbol near

their handiwork.

Rites

Garyxs clerics conduct a variety of rites connect-

ed to the seasons. At the winter solstice, they

celebrate All-Consuming Night, when they

keep a large bon re lit and followers bring

a variety of  ammable items to be de-

stroyed. At the spring equinox, they hold

a Sancti cation of Renewal in which the

ashes at the site of the All-Consuming

Night bon re are sifted and examined.

Any useful remains are taken to be reused.

For instance, bits of metal are taken to be

reforged into swords, armor, or other useful

tools of destruction. Any seedlings that might

have taken root in the area are nurtured.

Herald and Allies

The herald Garyx sends most often is a mature

and a happy glint in her eye. Of all the dragon gods, she

is the most friendly to nondragons.

Dogma

a small holy symbol of Hlal, reminding the performers

that their actions honor that deity.

Rites

Her  worshipers  say  that  Hlal  presides  over  the  first

performance of a new entertainment piece by one of her

followers. An eager performer, conductor, or playwright

often dedicates this initial presentation to Hlals glory (if

serious) or for Hlals amusement (if comic).

Herald and Allies

Hlals herald is a very old copper dragon. Her allies include

dragons, bards, and spellscales.

IO

The Concordant Dragon, the Great Eternal Wheel, Swallower

of Shades, the Ninefold Dragon, Creator of Dragonkind

Hlal enjoys sharing stories and songs with those who

appreciate such things, regardless of the listeners race

or background. She has little use for tyrantseven well-

meaning onesand even less patience for cruelty or

bullying. She teaches that one must be free of restraint,

whether real or psychological, in order to freely express

ones opinions.

Clergy

Hlals clerics are often cleric/bards who use

music, poetry, and tall tales to spread the faith.

Places of worship to Hlal are usually simple

shrines, which can be packed up and moved

to the next town or dragons lair at a

moments notice.

The followers of Hlal have much in

common with those of Olidammara,

and many characters pay homage to

both deities simultaneously. Both

Hextor and Vecna are among Hlals

chief enemies.

Quests

Whatever Hlal sends a follower to do

is worthy of being memorialized in

story or song. Quests undertaken for

Hlal often involve mistaken identity,

impersonation, and merry resolution.

They always feature ample measures of audac-

ity, bravery, trickery, and humor.

Prayers

Prayers to Hlal center around stories and

humor. They usually involve relating one of

the many tales about Hlal and the heroic acts

of her worshipers.

Io  is  the  Ninefold  Dragon,  known  as

such  because  he  embodies  all  align-

ments within his outlook. Io is regarded

as  the  creator  of  dragons,  subtly  ma-

nipulating the destinies of all dragons

by  operating  out  in  the  open  where

nobody  suspects  his  involvement.  Io

is concerned solely with the affairs of

dragons and dragonkind, interfering in

their lives only when he deems it abso-

lutely necessary.

Dogma

Io  cares  only  for  his  children  the

dragons and their continued existence

in the world. In some cases, this means

taking the side of the dragons against other

races. In other situations, Io might help non-

dragons  fight  against  a  dragon  who  would

otherwise  jeopardize  the  survivability  of  the

race as a whole.

Holy symbol

of Hlal

He  prefers  to  remain  out  of  conflicts

between dragons, though if such a conflict

threatens to escalate, he might step in (either personally or

by dispatching Aasterinian or some other servitor).

Established temples to Hlal are only found in the largest

of cities. They serve as much as performance or concert

halls as they do places of veneration, because entertain-

ment and worship are inextricably linked for the devout

of Hlal. Even in the smallest of thorps, though, often a

theatre, tavern, or other place of performance includes

Clergy

Io  has  even  fewer  clerics  or  shrines  than  most  of  the

other draconic deities, since his outlook is so broad and

all-encompassing. Still, even the most devoted cleric of

Bahamut, Tiamat, or another dragon god pays at least a

modicum of homage to the Ninefold Dragon. He also

Holy Symbol

of Io

occasionally  nds clerics or adepts among the reptilian

races, such as lizardfolk and troglodytes.

Ios  clerics  are  few,  and  they  have  no  established

dogma. Each individual has his own way of paying

homage to the creator of his kind.

Candidates for Ios clergy embark on an in-

trospective journey to rid themselves of every

judgmental  impulse  that  colors  their  opinion

of the world. They do so in the hope of one day

perceiving all creatures and events with true

objectivity. Many candidates never succeed

in this endeavor, even after a lifetime of

soul-searching.

Io counts no faiths among his enemies,

knowing the value of neutrality in ones

outlook. Even those of greatly varying

alignment can  nd common cause under

the banner of the Ninefold Dragon.

Quests

Ios followers are tasked with seemingly random

quests, such as Decrease the hoard of [a speci c

silver dragon] by one-quarter or Fortify [a par-

ticular green dragons] influence over its

region. Io rarely offers an explanation for

his assignments, but expects every follower

to trust his impartiality.

Half-dragon  followers  of  Io  seek  accep-

tance and inner peace in the gods boundless

love for his children. A typical quest involves finding

other half-dragons and revealing Ios love to them. Lo-

cating or consecrating a shrine to Iosometimes in

hostile territoryis a common mission for clerics of Io.

Sometimes a follower must journey to the lair of a wyrm

or older true dragon, face the dweller, and return with a

piece of long-forgotten lore.

Prayers

Ios prayers have a deep resonating quality that pleas-

antly  reverberates  throughout  the  entire  body  and

invigorates  the  follower.  One  often-used  supplication

is  Io,  Swallower  of  Shades,  shine  in  the  face  of  your

servant.  Among  half-dragons,  prayers  to  Io  are  more

like questions: Why, though I walk with you, are my

steps in darkness?

Io does not usually answer prayers, though he does listen

to them.

Temples

Io has very few temples, as is typical of dragon deities.

Small  shrines  in  his  honor  are  erected  among  some

draconic or reptilian peoples. His half-dragon priests are

wandering ascetics, some of whom advance to become

Singers of Concordance.

A shrine to Io is a simple pillared construction open to

the air and covered with a half-dome, the inside of which

is usually inlaid with draconic lore. These shrines are

always located in wide-open spaces, such as the middle

of a desert, the center of a valley, on a featureless plain, or

atop a mountain peak.

Rites

The theme of blending is central to observances in Ios

honor. He contains the essence of all dragons

and shows no favoritism or enmity toward a

given alignment or deity. Since half-dragons

are  themselves  blended  beings,  they  make

excellent leaders of such rituals. A typical ac-

tivity might be to mix wine with a drop of blood

from each participant, then pass the cup for all

to drink.

Ios name is evoked in matters of dragon

heritage and history, and when predicting

the  future  of  dragons  and  dragonkind.

Only the discerning eye of Io knows how

this will turn out.

Herald and Allies

Ios  most  impressive  herald  is  Aasterinian,

a  Huge  (mature  adult)  brass  dragon  who

acts as his messenger but also intervenes in

matters of great importance. Io tends to send a

herald blooded to the race of the dragonblood recipi-

ent. For example, to a half-dragon or a kobold, Ios

herald  is  a  half-dragon/half-kobold  9th-level

 ghter/9th-level sorcerer His allies are celestial

or  endish dragons. Planar dragons (described

in Chapter 4 of Draconomicon), although not

outsiders, can also be called on for assistance

at the DMs discretion, using the dragon ally

spells in Draconomicon.

LENDYS

Scale of Justice, the Balancer, Weigher of Lives

Lesser Deity

Symbol: Sword balanced on a needles point

Home Plane: Mechanus

Alignment: Lawful neutral

Portfolio: Balance, justice

Worshipers: Dragons

Cleric Alignments: LG, LN, N, LE

Domains:  Destruction,  Dragon*,  Law,  Protection

[Retribution]

Favored Weapon: Longsword (claw)

Unlike  Chronepsis,  who  judges  the  life  of  a  dragon

only after its death, Lendys metes out justice during a

dragons life. His scales are a tarnished silver, some say

because he cares more about judging others than tending

to himself.

Dogma

Lendys is the arbiter of dragonkind, serving as judge, jury,

and executioner alike. When a dragon has committed an

injustice against dragonkind, Lendys (or one of his trio

of great wyrm silver dragons) is dispatched to deal out

appropriate justice. Punishments are severe, and appeals

unheard of.

Clergy

The clerics and paladins of Lendys are justice-bringers,

often serving as arbiters in local communities. In some

cases, towns even rely on the local draconic worshiper

of Lendys to parcel out justice.

Clerics of Lendys get along well with wor-

shipers of St. Cuthbert, and poorly with those

who follow chaotic deities such as Kord, Oli-

dammara, or Erythnul.

Quests

Lendys  primarily  assigns  his  followers  to

quests involving meting out punishment to a

dragon who has harmed dragonkind.

Prayers

Prayers to Lendys focus on judgment. They

are recited in solemn tones.

Temples

Temples  to  Lendys  are  few.  More  often,  a

simple shrine, perhaps marked only by the

gods symbol, is set up in a courtroom or other

justice-dispensing place.

Rites

For followers of Lendys, any trial is a holy rite.

The duty of weighing evidence and rendering

judgment is taken very seriously. Although

Lendys focuses his judgment exclusively on

dragons, worshipers usually generalize any

act of justice as an honor entrusted to them

by their god.

Dogma

Tamara  believes  in  mercy  both  in  life  and  in

death.  Not  only  does  she  heal  the  sick  and

tend  the  injured,  she  also  delivers  a  merci-

ful end to those dragons nearing the end of

their  natural  life  span.  She  fiercely  detests

those  who  artificially  prolong  the  life  of  a

dragon,  particularly  when  it  is  against  that

dragons will.

Clergy

Tamaras clerics are healers, but also deliverers

of death to those who would escape it. They

prefer  to  destroy  any  undead  they  encoun-

ter,  particularly  draconic  undead  (such  as

dracoliches).

Though  theirs  is  a  peaceful  and  merci-

ful  faith,  the  worshipers  of  Tamara  do  not

hesitate to stand against evil or tyranny. She

counts Pelor among her staunchest friends and

Falazure, Hextor, Nerull, and Erythnul among

her enemies.

Quests

The  most  common  quest  from  Tamara  is

undertaken in opposition to some endeavor of

Falazure. Those seeking undeath are corrupt-

ing the natural order and must be stopped, so

Tamaras quests focus on destroying or thwart-

Holy symbol

ing undead creatures, especially undead dragons.

Herald and Allies

Prayers

Lendys uses a contingent of four marut inevitables

as  his  herald.  Acting  in  perfect  unison,  the

construct performs the task the deity set

them.  His  allies  include  silver  dragons,

inevitables, and draconic formians. If

you use Draconomicon, the golems in

that book make suitable allies.

TAMARA

Her Bene cence, Her Mercy

Lesser Deity

Symbol:  Seven-pointed  star  on  a

field of black

Home Plane: Elysium

Alignment: Neutral good

Portfolio: Life, light, mercy

Worshipers: Good dragons, healers, those who

desire mercy

Cleric Alignments: LG, NG, CG, N

Domains:  Dragon*,  Good,  Healing,  Strength,

Sun [Family]

Favored Weapon: Scimitar (claw)

Tamara is the kindest and most benevolent of the

draconic deities. Some mistake this characteristic

for weakness, though such beings dont make the

same error twice. She appears as a luminously

beautiful silver dragon, her eyes shining with

the brightness of the sun.

Prayers to Tamara have joyous, uplifting cadences and are

often melodious paeans to light and life.

Temples

Tamaras  temples  are  not  simple  places

of  worship.  They  tend  to  be  hospitals,

in rmaries,  or  hospices  where  the  sick

are welcomed. Severely or terminally ill

individuals are cared for with dignity

and  respect.  When  a  patient  dies,  his

passing is greeted as good news, a merci-

ful escape from the cares of this life.

Rites

Births,  returns  to  life  (such  as  through  raise

dead  or  resurrection),  and  even   nal  deaths  are

celebrated. They are opportunities to re ect upon and

praise Tamaras generosity, mercy and peace.

Herald and Allies

An  old  silver  dragon  is  Tamaras  primary  herald.

Her allies include good dragons, half-dragons, and

draconic creatures of all sorts.

TIAMAT

The Chromatic Dragon, Creator of Evil Dragonkind

Lesser Deity

Symbol: Five-headed dragon

Home Plane: Baator

Alignment: Lawful evil

Portfolio: Evil dragons, conquest, greed

Worshipers: Evil dragons, conquerors

Cleric Alignments: NE, LE

Domains:  Destruction,  Dragon*,  Evil,

Greed*,  Law,  Trickery  [Hatred,  Scaly-

kind,  Tyranny]

Favored Weapon: Heavy pick (bite)

All  evil  dragons  pay  homage  to

Tiamat; green and blue dragons

acknowledge  her  sovereign-

ty  the  most  readily.  Many

are  proud  to  call  themselves

her  spawn,  able  to  trace  their

bloodlines  back  to  their  god.

Good  dragons  have  a  healthy

respect for Tiamat, though they

try  to  avoid  mentioning  or  thinking

about her.

In her natural form, Tiamat is a thick-bod-

ied dragon with  ve heads and a wyverns

tail.  Each  head  is  a  different  color:  white,

black, green, blue, and red. Her massive body

is striped in those colors.

Tiamat  has  many  consorts,  including

great  wyrms  of  the  white,  black,  green,  blue,  and  red

varieties.

Dogma

Tiamat concerns herself with spreading evil, defeating

good, and propagating evil dragons. She enjoys razing

the  occasional  village,  city,  or  country,  but  only  as  a

diversion from her subtle, world-spanning plots. She is

the villain who lurks in the shadows. Her presence is

felt but seldom seen.

Tiamat  constantly  seeks  to  extend  the  power  and

dominion  of  evil  dragons  over  the  land,  particularly

when her subjects  nd themselves embroiled in territo-

rial disputes with good dragons. Tiamat also unfailingly

demands  reverence,  homage,  and  tribute  from  her

ssubjects.

Clergy

Tiamat accepts only evil clerics. Tiamats clerics, like Tiamat

herself, seek to place the world under the domination of

evil dragons.

Tiamat  claims  not  to  need  allies,  though  most

believe she has bargains with many archdevils and

lawful evil deities such as Hextor. Her enemies are

numerous, including Heironeous, Moradin, and, of

course, Bahamut.

Quests

The followers of Tiamat are sent on a variety

of quests to further her grand machina-

tions. Some are easily understood, such

as aiding one of her spawn against a

dragonborn who seeks to destroy it.

Others are less obvious and include

tasks as varied and hard to under-

stand as burying a speci c magic

item at a designated place.

Prayers

Tiamat urges her evil dragonblood follow-

ers to go forth and populate the world,  ll it

with her spawn, and either destroy or enslave

all others. Prayers to Tiamat focus on the goal

of world domination.

Holy symbol

of Tiamat

Temples

Though most evil dragons honor Tiamat, few

keep  shrines  dedicated  to  her  in  their  lairs

because  they  dont  want  Tiamats  greedy  eyes  gazing  at

their treasure hoards. Instead, they dedicate vast, gloomy

caverns to their deity and keep them stocked with treasure

and sacri ces.

Rites

To  commemorate  a  victory  such  as  destroying  a  town,

repulsing  a  thief  seeking  to  pilfer  from  ones  hoard,  or

gaining a great treasure, the followers of Tiamat celebrate

by  indulging  in  great  wickedness,  including  torturing

prisoners  or  even   ghting  one  another  to  prove  their

supremacy.

Herald and Allies

Tiamats herald is an old red dragon. Her allies include evil

dragons, baatezu, and evil draconic creatures of all sorts.

Kobolds:OfTrapsandPerfection

Races of the Dragon Web Enhancement

By Kolja Raven Liquette and Jason H. Haley

The  following  web  enhance-

ment adds to material found in

Races  of  the  Dragon  --  high-

lighting more features for the

kobolds.  Kobold  traps,  origi-

nally  scheduled  to  appear  in

this  sourcebook,  are  now  of-

fered  here  to  help  stock  your

kobold  infested  (or  infused)

dungeons. The kobold paragon

is a new racial paragon class option, designed to make

the most out of playing a character strictly kobold in

nature. For more information on racial paragons, refer

to page 32 of Unearthed Arcana:

In most D&D campaigns, the ideas of class and race

are separate concepts. But with racial paragon class-

es, the line between the two becomes blurred. Racial

paragons are, as their name suggests, nearly ideal ex-

amples of the strengths and abilities of the characters

race. Unlike members of other classes, however, racial

paragons are more than merely powerful individuals.

They are strong in all the ways that their race is strong,

while still vulnerable in the ways their race is vulnera-

ble. Beyond that, they possess powers and capabilities

that supersede those of normal members of their race.

While  any  elf  might  rise  in  power,  prestige,  and  (in

D&D terms) level, most do so by gaining levels in the

character classes described in the Players Handbook

- only a few are so much in tune with their heritage

and racial abilities that they become racial paragons.

Kobold Traps (CR 1 to CR 10)

communities participating in the construction of a par-

ticularly complicated trap (not unlike a barn raising).

Protecting the tribal lair from invaders, and gnomes in

particular, is the highest priority of kobold lairs.

Below  are  ten  kobold  traps,  one  for  each  Challenge

Rating from 1 to 10. Most of these traps still have de-

fault Search saves, Disable Device saves, Reflex saves,

attack  bonuses,  and  damage  bonuses  (except  for  the

bated fusillade trap). Raising or lowering these values

is left for individual trapmakers to modify as they see

fit (see the rules for Designing a Trap on page 74 of

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Two  of  the  mechanical  traps  (below)  incorporate  a

new miscellaneous feature developed by kobold trap-

smiths: tracking.

Tracking:  Traps  with  this  feature  adjust  to  follow  a

target that activates their trigger and continues to apply

its effect. Such traps usually incorporate the automatic

reset type. Traps with the multiple target feature adjust

to follow the target area that their trigger indicates is

the most occupied. Equally occupied target areas are

chosen at random. This feature adds a +1 CR modifier

to mechanical traps.

CR 1: Choke Point Trap

Kobolds  strategically  design  choke  points  traps  into

the tunnels of their lairs to slow down pursuers and

trap  would-be  invaders  in  dead-end  rooms  (where

other traps are usually located). If you have 5 or more

ranks  of  Knowledge  (architecture  and  engineering)

you gain a +2 bonus on Disable Device and Search

checks with regards to this trap.

Trapmaking is an obsession for kobolds, who regard

their racial craft as an art form. Kobolds realized long

ago that for every trap installed around their lair, an-

other kobold life is spared... or more importantly, kept

out  of  melee  combat.  Consequently,  a  dedicated  and

proven trapsmith is the closest equivalent that kobolds

come to a celebrity in their society. For this reason, all

kobolds aspire to protect their homes with especially

devious traps, wanting to be respected as a trapsmith

on some level. It is not uncommon to find entire kobold

Choke Point Trap: CR 1 mechanical; location trig-

ger; automatic reset; Escape Artist DC 15 (see note);

Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. Market Price:

1,500 gp.

Note: 5 ft. of tunnel is narrow and low* for Medium

creatures (2 1/2 ft. high by 2 1/2 ft. wide) but narrow*

for kobolds. Reverse direction is an awkward space*

for Medium creatures (Escape Artist DC 15) but nar-

row and low* for kobolds.

See page 55 of  Dungeon Masters Guide II.

CR 2: Automatic Phalanx

Kobolds  design  automatic  phalanxes  into  the  floors

and  walls  of  their  lairs,  set  to  activate  when  a  crea-

ture of 50 pounds of more passes over the trigger area.

Kobolds  will  flee  from  an  invading  enemy  and  lure

them towards these traps. Magical versions of this trap

might be proximity activated, using a detect good spell

to sense targets.

Automatic  Phalanx:  CR  2;  mechanical;  location

trigger;  automatic  reset; Atk  +10  melee  (1d8/x3,  1d4

spears); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. Market

Price: 3,000 gp.

Note: Charging or  running over location trigger dou-

bles damage.

CR 3: Topsy-Turvy Bridge

Kobolds  will  sometimes  construct  a  few  stable  rope

bridges over existing chasms, hoping to foster a false

sense of security, and then one topsy-turvy bridge when

least expected. These 5-feet wide bridges flip over when

a creature of 50 pounds of more passes over the trigger

area.

Topsy-Turvy Bridge: CR 3; mechanical; location trig-

ger; automatic reset; DC 20 Reflex save avoids; 40-ft.

deep (4d6, fall); multiple targets (all targets within 10

ft.  of  target);  Search  DC  20;  Disable  Device  DC  20.

Market Price: 4,500 gp.

Note:  Trap  activates  on  the  middle  5-ft.  square  of

bridge.

CR 4: High and Low Trap

The high and low trap is a perfect example of how ko-

bolds try to induce panic in their targets. When a trap

deals damage on two fronts simultaneously, most tar-

gets cannot think calmly enough to weigh their options,

and run blindly from both dangers instead. High and

low traps are excellent tools for corralling adventurers

in particular directions.

High and Low Trap: CR 4; mechanical; automatic re-

set;  proximity  trigger;  multiple  traps  (arrow  fusillade

and  fixed  caltrops);  arrow  fusillade  (Atk  +10  ranged

[1d6/x3,  shortbow  arrow];  tracking;  multiple  targets

[1d4  arrows  at  each  target  in  a  10-ft.-by-10-ft.  area];

Search 20; Disable Device DC 20), fixed caltrops (spe-

cial bypass [half Speed]; multiple targets [1 caltrop at-

tack per 5-ft square]; Search 20; Disable Device 20).

Market Price: 10,500 gp.

Note: Using Dexterity to avoid arrow fusillade prompts

caltrop attack.

CR 5: Trap Door Locust Swarm

Nothing  pleases  a  kobold  more  than  putting  insects

into a trap from which the target cannot easily escape.

For the purposes of this trap, locust swarm is consid-

ered a 3rd-level spell, based on the 2nd-level summon

swarm spell, but summons a locust swarm* instead. As

an upgrade, a centipede swarm would be considered a

4th-level spell.

See page 239 of Dungeon Masters Guide.

Trap  Door  Locust  Swarm:  CR  5;  mechanical  and

magical device; location trigger; automatic reset; mul-

tiple traps (trap door and locust swarm); trap door (DC



20 Reflex save avoids; 20-ft. deep [2d6, fall]; Search

DC  20;  Disable  Device  DC  20),  spell  effect  (locust

swarm, 6th level sorcerer; Search DC 28; Disable De-

vice DC 28). Market Price/Cost: 12,000 gp, 720 XP.

Note: This trap is really a CR 2 pit trap and a CR 4 lo-

cust swarm trap. These effects are dependant on each

other. The trap door swings shut after being triggered,

creating natural darkness. The locust swarm lasts un-

til defeated or the spell effect is disabled.

CR 6: Hold Person Hidden Catapult

A favorite among kobolds, hold person hidden cata-

pults are sometimes attended by nearby kobolds hop-

ing  to  watch  hapless  adventurers  spring  this  trap.

More  dramatic  versions  of  this  trap  are  constructed

for multiple targets. They activate when a creature of

50 pounds of more passes over the trigger area.

Hold  Person  Hidden  Catapult:  CR  6;  magical  and

mechanical device; location trigger; automatic reset;

multiple traps (hold person and hidden catapult); spell

effect (hold person, 3rd level cleric, DC 13 Will save

negates; Search DC 27; Disable Device DC 27), hid-

den catapult (DC 20 Reflex save avoids; target hurled

50-ft against stone wall [5d6, bludgeoning] and 50-ft.

high  [5d6,  fall];  Search  DC  20;  Disable  Device  DC

20); Market Price/Cost: 10,500 gp, 240 XP.

Note: This trap is really a CR 3 hold person trap and

a CR 5 hidden catapult trap. These effects are compli-

mentary  to  each  other. Targets  automatically  fail  the

Reflex save if the Will save was failed. Subtract 1d6

from bludgeoning damage and 10-ft. from fall damage

for  every  extra  200  lbs.  of  target  weight  above  200

lbs..

CR 7: Collapsing Edge Mining Shaft

Collapsing  edges  are  installed  overlooking  chasms,

pits, and precipices. A collapsing edge above flowing

lava is always popular. Despite needing regular main-

tenance, collapsing edges are unsuspicious enough to

be routinely successful. They are designed to activate

when  creatures  of  50  pounds  of  more  pass  over  the

trigger area.

Collapsing Edge Mining Shaft (15 ft. x 15 ft.): CR

7; mechanical; location trigger; repair reset; multiple

traps (two collapsing edge traps); DC 20 Reflex save

avoids;  60-ft.  deep  (6d6,  fall);  sharp  rocks  (Atk  +10

melee,  1d4  sharp  rocks  per  target  for  1d4+6  each);

multiple targets (first target in each of three adjacent

5-ft. squares); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20.

Market Price: 8,000 gp.

Note:  This  trap  is  really  two  CR  5  collapsing  edge

traps that use the same mining shaft. There is one col-

lapsing edge trap on the far and near side of the mining

shaft. Standing on either edge of the shaft activates the

trap. Characters who perform a running Jump across

the mining shaft automatically fail their Reflex save if

they leap from either edge.

CR 8: Blown Away Trap

A work of art like the blown away trap is usually re-

served for safeguarding the most coveted locations in

a kobold lair, like a temple of Kurtulmak where valu-

able  magical  treasures  are  hidden.  The  attack  and

damage values of the floor spikes will almost certainly

be upgraded.

Blown Away  Trap:  CR  8;  mechanical  and  magical

devices;  automatic  reset;  proximity  trigger  (alarm);

multiple traps (mass reduce person, gust of wind, and

extending floor spikes); spell effect (mass reduce per-

son, 8th level sorcerer, DC 16 Fortitude negates; mul-

tiple  targets  [up  to  8  humanoid  targets];  Search  DC

29; Disable Device DC 29), spell effect (gust of wind,

4th level sorcerer, DC 13, Fortitude negates; Tiny tar-

gets blown back 1d4 x 10 feet, 1d4 non-lethal dam-

age per 10 feet; multiple targets [12 squares in a line];

Search  DC  27;  Disable  Device  DC  27),  extending

floor spikes (multiple targets [all targets blown prone

in 60 ft. line]; Atk +10 melee, 1d4 spikes per target for

1d4 each; Search 20; Disable Device 20). Cost/Mar-

ket Price: 27,500 gp. Special: 1,600 XP.

Note: This trap is really a CR 5 mass reduce person

trap,  a  CR  3  gust  of  wind  trap,  and  a  CR  6  extend-

ing floor spikes trap. These effects are dependent on

each other. Medium targets reduced to Small size are

knocked prone by gust of wind onto extending floor



spikes.  Small  targets  (gnomes  in  particular)  reduced

to  Tiny  size  are  knocked  prone  onto  extending  floor

spikes and blown 1d4 x 10 feet back, taking additional

floor spike damage per 5 feet. The gust of wind con-

tinues blowing until there are no targets in the trigger

area,  at  which  point  the  trap  resets. The  blown  away

trap works best in narrow hallways.

Con/2d6 Con); Search 10/30; Disable Device DC 20.

Market Price: 76,000 gp.

Note: A Search check (DC 10) finds the trap. A success-

ful  Disable  Device  check  triggers  the  trap. A  Search

check (DC 30) of the trap reveals its true nature which

can then be disabled.

CR 9: Pinning Water Cage

Bonus Kobold Trap

Pinning water cages are one of the most callous kobold

traps.  They  waste  no  time  with  onset  delay  features,

quickly  immobilizing  targets  underwater.  These  cag-

es  are  usually  incorporated  into  subterranean  rivers

that  kobold  mining  crews  redirect  from  underground

springs,  making  them  deep  enough  to  fully  submerge

the cage.

Pinning Water Cage: CR 9; mechanical device; prox-

imity trigger; manual reset; metal cage (Atk +10 melee

touch),  cage  spears  (Atk  +10  melee,  1d8/x3,  spears);

multiple targets (1d4 spears at each target within a 10-

ft.-by-10-ft. area; targets damaged by spears are pinned

inside  cage  and  must  make  a  Strength  check  against

DC  10  +  2  per  additional  damage-dealing  spear  to

break free); liquid; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC

20. Market Price: 36,000 gp.

Note: In addition to being pinned, targets must break

through cage bars to escape. A DC 24 Strength check

is needed to bend iron bars.

CR 10: Bated Fusillade Trap

Races of the Dragon introduced a new kobold-created

alchemical device called a ditherbomb, which is made

in  three  intensities;  weak,  strong,  and  wyrm. Adding

ditherbombs to a trap increases the CR modifier by +1,

+2, and +3 respectively.

Kobolds  know  how  to  manipulate  gnomish  curiosity

with ditherbomb disguises, juxtaposing valuable items

with  worthless  junk,  in  this  instance  a  well-polished

sword in the hands of a skeleton. Removing the weapon

causes a ditherbomb to dislodge from the ribcage and

detonate.  Kobolds  often  invest  in  making  these  traps

harder to find.

Ditherbomb  Disguise:  CR  1/2/3  mechanical;  touch

trigger; no reset; alchemical device (weak/strong/wyrm

ditherbomb,  1d6/1d4  x  1d6/1d6  x  1d8,  DC  10/12/15

Reflex half damage); multiple targets (all targets within

a 5 ft./10 ft./15 ft. radius); Search DC 20; Disable De-

vice DC 20. Market Price: 600 gp/1,300 gp/2,500 gp.

Note:  Removing  the  well-polished  sword  from  skel-

eton activates trap.

The bated trap (in this case a fusillade) is a guilty plea-

sure among kobold trapsmiths who enjoy outsmarting

rogues  rather  than  simply  killing  them.  Bated  traps

were  designed  by  trapmakers  more  accustomed  to

dealing with intelligent prey. Generally speaking, the

poison is the most lethal part of such traps.

Bated Fusillade Trap: CR 10; mechanical; touch trig-

ger/proximity  trigger  (disabling  activates  proximity

trigger); automatic reset; Atk +10 ranged (1d8/19-20,

light  crossbow  bolt);  tracking;  multiple  targets  (1d4

bolts  at  each  target  in  a  10-ft.-by-10-ft.  area);  poison

(deathblade poison, DC 20, Fortitude save resists, 1d6

Kobold Paragon

Kobolds  are  reptilian  humanoids  that  embrace  hard

work  as  the  inescapable  standard  of  their  daily  lives.

They exist to facilitate the mining operations that in-

evitably  sustain  their  lair  without  devoting  a  thought

to personal ambition or desire. Workers that challenge

this time-honored fate rebel by excelling in all aspects

of  kobold  life  rather  than  simply  specializing  in  one

profession. These  are  the  kobold  paragons  of  a  tribe,

willfully motivated athletes of productivity.

Adventures:  Kobold  paragons  are  not  unlike  drag-

ons in their pursuit of treasure. Kobold paragons are a

little more discerning, however, in that they value sin-

gular items of power more than hordes of gold. They

will even travel farther away from their lair than most

other kobolds, seeking magical jewelry above all else.

As  natural  sorcerers,  kobold  paragons  are  more  than

equipped to handle monstrous encounters, shoring up

their physical weaknesses with arcane might.

Characteristics: Kobold paragons are equal part cre-

ative  intuition  and  draconic  ferocity.  When  kobold

paragons  spearhead  a  plan,  they  do  so  with  remark-

able forethought, whether designing a trap, laying out

a mine, or looking for the weaknesses of a hated op-

ponent. When  there  is  no  time  to  prepare  for  a  fight,

kobold paragons unleash the draconic side of their per-

sonality, a primitive impulse that is forever clawing to

the surface, eager to taste the blood of their enemies.

Alignment: Kobold paragons are constantly trying to

rise above their tribal instincts of loyalty. They are not

trying  to  abandon  their  roots,  but  to  make  decisions

as  individuals  (a  foreign  concept  in  kobold  culture).

While kobolds are normally lawful evil, kobold para-

gons are not bound by this cultural disposition. Despite

their best efforts, even good-aligned kobold paragons

cannot stop themselves from devising painfully sadis-

tic traps in their spare time.

Religion: Kobold paragons generally rationalize their

actions in the name of Kurtulmak, who suffered greatly

at  the  hands  of  Garl  Glittergold,  or  embrace  Io,  who

follows a more open-minded and less racially charged

path. With Kurtulmak, kobold paragons are polarized

against every other race. With Io, kobolds seek objec-

tivity as an ideal, allowing them to socialize more with

other  races. A  kobold  paragon  can  also  express  their

piety through devoted service to their lair.

Background: A kobold paragon attains their position

by excelling in every field of kobold expertise. Where

most lair-bound kobolds are directed into one profes-

sion,  kobold  paragons  must  become  equally  skilled

at  sorcery,  trapfinding,  and  trapmaking.  This  kind  of

behavior is usually discouraged, as tribal leaders pre-

fer the kobolds of their lair to be obedient, specialized

workers. A  kobold  paragon  must  therefore  work  four

times as hard to attain their distinction.

Races: Kobolds despise gnomes, distrust dwarves and

fey, and generally hold every other race in contempt.

Kobold paragons are different in that they can suspend

their  racial  antipathy  to  gather  information  about  en-

emies,  rather  than  automatically  attacking  their  foes.

Feeling  isolated  in  the  world,  kobolds  are  outwardly

defensive towards other creatures. These feelings can

diminish  as  kobold  paragons  spend  more  time  with

other humanoids.

Other Classes: Kobold paragons relate to rogues and

sorcerers more readily than any other classes, as they

share the most in common with their trapmaking and

spellcasting abilities. Kobold paragons tend to be more

alert and productive around clerics, being accustomed

to such figures in positions of leadership. Kobold para-

gons regard the melee classes with due respect because

they usually lack the strength to become effective fight-

ers.

GAME RULE INFORMATION

Kobold paragons have the following game statistics.

Abilities:  Charisma  determines  the  effectiveness  of

a  kobold  paragons  spellcasting  ability  and  is  useful

when  attempting  deceptions  and  collecting  informa-

tion. Dexterity is always an asset to kobold paragons,

increasing  their  accuracy  when  making  ranged  at-

tacks  and  aiding  them  in  melee  combat  (after  taking

the Weapon Finesse feat). Constitution makes kobold

paragons better able to withstand the physical dangers

of adventuring.



Alignment: Any,  although  predominantly  lawful  and

evil.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the kobold paragon

class.

Weapon  and Armor  Proficiency:  The  kobold  para-

gon  is  proficient  with  all  simple  weapons,  plus  the

heavy  pick  and  light  pick.  Kobold  paragons  are  also

proficient with light armor. Kobold paragons treat the

dire  pick  (see  Complete  Warrior,  p.157)  as  a  martial

weapon  that  can  be  wielded  two-handed  as  a  simple

weapon.

Manual Expertise (Ex): A kobold paragon may add

his  class  level  as  a  racial  bonus  on  Craft  (trapmak-

ing), Profession (mining), and Search checks.

Tunnel  Defense  (Ex):  At  1st  level,  a  kobold  paragon

uses confined spaces to their advantage in melee com-

bat. A kobold paragon is treated as a Medium opponent

when using or resisting any special attack (for example,

bull rush, disarm, grapple) but only when fighting in a

location no wider than their combat space (5 ft. wide).

In  addition,  a  kobold  paragon  retains  their  Dexterity

bonus to AC even if caught flat-footed or struck by an

invisible attacker in these confined conditions.

If a kobold paragon has uncanny dodge from a dif-

ferent class, the character automatically gains the ben-

efits of improved uncanny dodge, but only when fight-

ing in confined conditions (as above).

Improved Darkvision (Ex): At 2nd level, a kobold par-

agons darkvision range increases by 30 feet.

No Light Sensitivity: At 2nd level, a kobold paragon

loses their races light sensitivity.

Spells Per Day: At 2nd and 3rd-level, a kobold para-

gon  gains  new  spells  per  day  and  spells  known  as  if

the character had also gained a level in sorcerer. The

kobold  paragon  does  not,  however,  gain  any  other

benefit a character of that class would have gained (fa-

miliar abilities, and so on). This essentially means that

the character adds the level of kobold paragon to their

level in sorcerer, then determines spells per day, spells

known, and caster level accordingly. If a kobold para-

gon has no levels in sorcerer, this class feature has no

effect.

Ability  Boost  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  a  kobold  paragons

Charisma score increases by 2 points.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Patrakis  grew  up  in  a  kobold  tribe  as  the  son  of  the

kobold chieftain. His family is well-known for the long

lineage of heroes. The tribe pays regular tribute to an

old red dragon, who somehow learnt of his sorcerous

potential  and  summoned  him. After  spending  a  week

with  the  dragon,  his  sorcery  was  unleashed.  Now  he

seeks to protect his tribe from adventurers.
