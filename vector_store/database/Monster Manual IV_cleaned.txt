Introduction

Welcome  to  Monster  Manual  IV.  This  book  contains  new

creatures for use in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventures. The

monster  entries  are  generally  alphabetical  by  name,  with

closely related monsters grouped together. In addition to the

table of contents at the front of this book, monsters are also

listed by type and subtype on page 221, and by Challenge

Rating and ECL on page 204.

This  introduction  explains  how  to  read  each  creatures

writeup. It often mentions terms in the glossary, which is

found on pages 205221. Refer to those pages for de nitions

of terms you might not be familiar with.

READING THE ENTRIES

Each monster description is organized in the same general

format, as outlined below. For complete information about

the characteristics of monsters, consult the glossary of this

book,  the  Players  Handbook  (PH),  or  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide (DMG).

We want this book to be as useful to DMs as possible, so

weve adopted our new statistics block format for use here.

The new format is divided into four main sections separated

by horizontal lines. Each section serves a speci c purpose;

you  will  need  to  reference  different  sections  at  different

times during an encounter.

IDENTIFICATION AND ENCOUNTER

The top section identi es the creature and gives the informa-

tion you need at the start of an encounter.

Name: This word or phrase identi es the creature. Some-

times a number is given with the name to indicate how many

creatures appear in the encounter.

CR: This value is the Challenge Rating of an individual

creature of this kind.

Race, Class, and Level: This information is provided only

for characters with class levels.

Alignment:  The  one-  or  two-letter  abbreviation  that

appears here denotes the creatures alignment.

Size and Type: The creatures size category and its type

(and subtype or subtypes, if applicable) are given here.

Init:  This  value  is  the  creatures  modi er  on  initiative

checks.

Senses: The Senses entry indicates whether the creature

has darkvision, low-light vision, scent, or some other sensory

special quality, along with the creatures modi ers on Listen

and Spot checks (even if the creature has no ranks in those

skills).

Aura: This indicates special abilities that take effect any-

time another creature comes within a certain distance, such

as a devils fear aura.

Languages: This entry gives the languages the creature

speaks or understands, as well as any special abilities relating

to communication (such as telepathy or tongues).

DEFENSIVE INFORMATION

This section provides the information you need when char-

acters are attacking the creature.

AC: This entry gives the creatures Armor Class against

most regular attacks, followed by its AC against touch attacks

and its AC when  at-footed. If the creature has feats or other

abilities that modify its Armor Class under speci c circum-

stances (such as the Mobility feat), they are noted here as well

as in the Feats entry.

hp: This entry consists of the creatures full normal hit

point total (usually average rolls on each Hit Die), followed

by the creatures Hit Dice in parentheses. If the creature has

fast healing, regeneration, damage reduction (DR), or some

other ability that affects the amount of damage it takes or

the rate at which it regains hit points, that information also

appears here.

Immune: Any immunities the creature has are indicated

here. This includes immunity to speci c types of energy as

well as speci c immunities (such as immunity to poison or

to sleep effects).

Resist and SR: If the creature has resistance to certain

kinds  of  attacks,  that  information  is  given  here.  Altered

saving throw bonuses for speci c circumstances appear on

this line. The creatures spell resistance, if any, appears after

the other resistances on the same line.

Fort,  Ref,  Will:  This  entry  gives  the  creatures  saving

throw modi ers.

Weakness:  This  entry  details  any  weaknesses  or  vul-

nerabilities  the  creature  has,  such  as  light  sensitivity  or

vulnerability to a type of energy.

OFFENSIVE INFORMATION

Refer to this section when its the creatures turn to act in

combat.  All  a  creatures  combat  options  are  detailed  here,

even those that are not strictly offensive.

Speed:  This  entry  begins  with  the  creatures  base  land

speed in feet and in squares on the battle grid, followed by

speeds for other modes of movement, if applicable.

ADAPTABLE ADVENTURE SITES

One of the new features in Monster Manual IV is a set of full-page

maps that arent associated with a particular kind of creature.

Instead,  they  depict  some  archetypal  adventuring  venues:  a

great  tomb  (page  23),  a  typical  wilderness  lair  (page  66),  an

underground lair (page 89), and a subterranean mining camp

(page 113). Each of these maps can be used out of the boxall

you, as the DM, need to do is populate them with appropriate

monsters and treasure. Any of them, of course, can be modified

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

to suit the needs of a particular story thats being played out in

the campaign.

The  Deephollows,  a  sample  underground  lair  that  appears

on  pages  200  and  201,  differs  from  the  other  full-page  map

presentationsit comes with extensive text descriptions of each

keyed location within the site. It serves both as an adventure site

in its own right and as an example of how the other archetypal

locations can be expanded by adding the same sort of detailed

information.

Melee/Ranged: Typically, these entries give all the physi-

cal attacks the creature can make when taking a full attack

action. The  rst attack described is the creatures preferred

form of attack, usually a melee attack of some sort but possi-

bly (as in the example below) a ranged attack. If the creature

can make only a single attack (for instance, when it is taking

an attack action), use the  rst indicated attack bonus. Occa-

sionally, a creature has separate options indicated for single

attacks and for full attacks. For example, a hal ing ranger

with the Manyshot and Rapid Shot feats might have the fol-

lowing entries:

Ranged +1 longbow +8 (2d6+2/3) with Manyshot or

Ranged +1 longbow +10/+10/+5 (1d6+1/3) with Rapid Shot

Melee masterwork longsword +8/+3 (1d6/1920)

Each set of attack routines is prefaced by a boldface word

indicating  whether  the  attacks  are  melee  or  ranged.  Next

comes the weapon used for the attack, the modi ed attack

bonus, the amount of damage the attack deals, and informa-

tion about critical hits. If the weapon has the default critical

hit characteristics (threat on a 20 and 2 damage), this portion

of the entry is omitted.

Space and Reach: This entry de nes how large a square

the creature takes up on the battle grid, as well as how far

a creatures natural reach extends and any reach weapons it

might use.

Base  Atk:  The  Base  Atk  entry  gives  the  creatures  base

attack bonus without any modi ers.

Grp: This entry gives the creatures grapple bonus (base

attack + size modi er + Str bonus).

Atk  Options:  Special  abilities  that  the  creature  can

employ  to  modify  its  normal  attacks  appear  here.  Such

abilities might include feats such as Power Attack or Combat

Expertise, or special abilities such as smite evil or trip.

Special  Actions:  This  entry  gives  any  special  actions

that  the  creature  can  take  on  its  turn  in  place  of  making

attacks.

Combat Gear: Possessions that the creature can choose

to employ on its turn as an action appear here. Such items

might include doses of poison (applied poisons, not natural

ones),  scrolls,  potions,  oils,  wands,  staffs,  rods,  and  other

wondrous items.

Spells Known or Spells Prepared: This entry appears

for spellcasters. It is listed as spells known for sorcerers

and members of other classes who do not prepare spells,

and spells prepared for wizards, clerics and others who

do prepare them in advance. It begins with the creatures

caster level for spells. If its rolls to overcome spell resis-

tance  are  based  on  a  number  other  than  its  caster  level

(because  the  creature  has  the  Spell  Penetration  feat,  for

example), its total modi er is given after the expression

spell pen. Spells known are listed from highest level to 0

level, and each includes an attack bonus and a saving throw

DC, if appropriate. If the character casts some spells at a

different caster level than others, that information is also

speci ed here.

A clerics statistics block also includes the name of his deity

(if applicable) and the domains to which he has access. Each

domain spell he has prepared is marked with a superscript D.

The granted powers of his domains might appear as combat

options or resistances or not at all, if they only modify infor-

Power  Points/Day  and  Powers  Known:  This  entry

gives the number of power points per day to which a psionic

character has access, as well as any psionic powers known. It

begins with the creatures manifester level. Powers known

are  listed  from  highest  level  to  lowest,  and  each  power

includes an attack bonus and a saving throw DC, if appro-

priate. If the character uses some powers at a different caster

level than others, that information is also speci ed with the

affected powers.

Spell-Like Abilities: Any spell-like abilities the creature

possesses appear here. The entry begins with the creatures

caster  level  for  these  abilities.  As  with  spells,  this  entry

includes attack bonuses and saving throw DCs where appro-

OTHER INFORMATION

Most of the information presented in this section is not rel-

evant during a combat encounter with the creature.

Abilities: The creatures ability scores appear here in the

customary order (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha).

SQ: Any special qualities not presented earlier in the sta-

tistics block appear here.

Feats: This entry lists all the feats the creature possesses,

including  those  that  appear  elsewhere  in  the  statistics

block.

Skills: This entry shows all the skill modi ers for skills

in which the creature has ranks. Modi ers are also provided

for skills to which racial modi ers, bonuses from synergy, or

other modi ers apply, whether or not the creature has ranks

in those skills.

Possessions:  This  entry  lists  the  items  the  creature  is

wearing or carrying. The expression combat gear appears

 rst  when  applicable  to  remind  you  of  other  possessions

referenced above.

Spellbook: This entry gives the spells in the creatures

spellbook, if it has one. The notation spells prepared plus

indicates that the spells the creature has prepared are part

of this list, but are not reiterated here.

The  nal portion of the statistics block consists of para-

graphs  explaining  special  abilities  noted  in  the  various

entries above as necessary.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

This  section  contains  guidance  for  running  the  creature.

Does the creature favor charging into combat or attacking

at  range?  Does  it  prefer  weapons  or  spells?  Is  it  a  solitary

monster or does it tend to gather in hordes?

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

The  older  monster  write-ups  had  a  one-line  entry  titled

Organization. This adds more depth and detail. The encoun-

ECOLOGY

Where do the monsters live? What do they hunt or eat? What

hunts or eats them? Whats their life cycle? When appropri-

ate, the ecology section offers insights into the life cycle of

the monster in question.

Environment: Here, we continue to use the speci c terms

weve  developed  to  describe  climate  (warm,  temperate,  or

cold) and terrain (plains, hills, forests, marshes, mountains,

or deserts). Some creatures are subterranean and live under-

ground. Some that have no place in the natural environment

(particularly constructs and undead) might be found any-

where. Extraplanar outsiders are assigned a plane of origin.

On  that  plane,  they  are  considered  native  outsiders.  If

encountered elsewhere, they have the extraplanar subtype.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  This  section  states

the average height of a bipedal creature or whatevers most

appropriate for a nonbipedal one and the creatures weight. It

discusses any signi cant physical differences between ages

or genders.

Alignment: The creatures statistic block lists a sample

alignment.  Here  is  a  discussion  of  its  philosophy.  Is  it  is

always, usually, or sometimes that alignment?

LORE

Monster Manual IV offers information about each monster

that can be gleaned from an appropriate Knowledge check.

The  description  of  the  Knowledge  skill  indicates  that  in

general, the baseline DC of checks to identify monsters and

remember one bit of useful information about their special

power or vulnerabilities is equal to 10 + the monsters HD.

Every 5 points by which the check result exceeds the DC

yields another useful piece of information (PH 78).

That  addresses  speci c  creatures  very  well,  but  theres

more to be said about creatures of general types. Consider

the whisper demon as an example. Its a 15 Hit Dice creature.

That means that identifying it is a DC 25 check. This gener-

ally check will generally yield one bit of information, but

since there are lowly 2 HD demons such as the dretch out

there that share many of the demon and tanarri traits, its

reasonable to give more information about it with the initial

identi cation of the creature as a tanarri.

As a general rule of thumb, a DC 15 check or higher will

reveal  all  of  the  base  creatures  type  and  subtype  traits  as

de ned  in  the  glossary.  This  often  includes  information

about energy resistance or various immunities. For instance,

a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) check reveals that dragons have

high hit points (12-sided HD), all good saves, and have dark-

vision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. They are immune

to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects. They eat, sleep,

and breathe.

Information speci c to the creature, such as its type of

damage resistance, spell-like abilities, or immunities come

with the high DC check results.

SOCIETY

Intelligent creatures often form their own societies and have

particular worldviews and norms. Here, youll  nd entries

that include details about their thoughts, social interactions,

religion, or government. How do creatures view themselves,

each other, other races? What do they value? Whats normal

for them?

SAMPLE LAIR

Some creatures have an entry showing a sample lair complete

with area descriptions.

TYPICAL TREASURE

This information expresses typical treasure values and trea-

sure preferences.

Some creatures dont have treasure. Others have their trea-

sure merely expressed in their Possessions stat block line.

This section of the description is where you can  nd more

information if it applies.

For  cultured  societies,  sample  art  objects,  jewelry,  and

other creature-speci c  avor pieces might be described.

A creature that has been advanced by class levels, has trea-

sure equal to an NPC of its Challenge Rating, not its effective

class level. For example, a githyanki soldier (3rd-level  ghter)

is CR 4, and has an ECL of 5 (class levels +2). He has treasure

equivalent to a 4th-level NPC.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

If the creature can be useful to a player character as an animal

companion, familiar, planar ally, mount, summoned monster,

relevant information is included here.

CREATURES AS CHARACTERS

If a creature offers exciting possibilities for play as a character,

this section provides the statistics and level adjustment.

CREATURES WITH CLASS LEVELS

If the creature advances by class, but is not suitable for play as

a character, this section discusses its favored class and might

offer information about its deity and domains or other class-

based information.

ADVANCED CREATURES

If a creature advances by Hit Dice, the Advancement line

in its statistics block gives the break points. This section

of the description, when present, discusses the whys and

wherefores  of  the  creatures  increased  size  and  abilities.

For example, given a subterranean creature, are the larger

specimens found deeper in the earth? Is its growth a result

of  good  feeding,  good  environment,  age,  or  simple  hap-

penstance?

CREATURES IN EBERRON OR

CREATURES IN FAERN

These sections (not present for every creature) describe the

AVATARS OF

ELEMENTAL EVIL

The Princes of Elemental EvilImix, Ogremoch, Olhydra,

and Yan-C-Binhave long sought to extend their in uence

to the Material Plane. They believe that the deity known as

the Elder Elemental Eye holds the key to their plan. The ava-

tars of Elemental Evil, foremost among the princes servants,

are powerful forces of destruction that aid and serve the high

priests of Elemental Evil.

The Elemental Princes believe that the Elder Elemental

Eye is their forebear, a mighty being who can elevate them to

godhood and herald their domination of the Material Plane.

However, this deity is trapped in a strange void between the

planes from which the princes seek to

free  it.  Unknown  to  them,  the  Elder

Elemental Eye is actually a front for the

malevolent god Tharizdun.

Long ago, both good and evil deities

allied against Tharizdun, who seeks the

annihilation  of  all  reality,  and  sealed

the  god  in  a  mighty  prison.  The  ever-

greedy  Princes  of  Elemental  Evil,  too

young  to  remember  that  ancient  war,

allowed  their  ambition  to  blind  them

to  Tharizduns  deception.  Should  they

succeed in freeing the Elder Elemental

Eye,  the  resulting  destruction  would

spell the end of all existence. The secre-

tive cult of Tharizdun failed in its initial

attempt to use the Elemental Princes to

restore their dread lord, but the princes

ambition and avarice remain.

The avatars of Elemental Evil represent the princes  rst

steps in reestablishing their power. Since the destruction of

the Temple of All-Consumption (see the Return to the Temple

of  Elemental  Evil  adventure),  the  four  princes  have  been

actively  spreading  their  foul  progeny  across  the  Material

Plane. Luckily for the world, the princes rarely cooperate.

Each competes against the others for the Elder Elemental

Eyes favor. Their cults also quarrel with each other, and at

pqqqqqqqqqrs

WORSHIP OF THE ELDER ELEMENTAL EYE

All beings that worship the Elder Elemental Eye in truth offer

prayers and sacrifice to Tharizdun. Few know of, or even sus-

pect, the truth of the gods identity.

The Dark God, Tharizdun

Intermediate Deity

Symbol: A black triangle with an inverted yellow Y

inscribed within, each arm ending at the midpoint

of one of the triangles sides

Home Plane: None (sealed in a prison plane)

Alignment: Neutral evil

Portfolio: Ruin, elemental power, vengeance

Worshipers: Fanatic nihilists, evil elemental beings

Cleric Alignments: LE, NE, CE

Domains: Air, Destruction, Earth, Evil, Fire, Water

Favored Weapon: Curved dagger

pqqqqqqqqqrs

times they resort to open warfare to achieve dominance in a

region.

Followers of the Elder Elemental Eye worship one of its

elemental  aspects:  air,  earth,   re,  or  water.  Clerics  choose

one elemental domain plus either Destruction or Evil. They

wear ochre robes marked with the deitys symbol, modi ed

according  to  the  elemental  aspect  they  worship.  The  cult

appeals to people on the fringes of civilization, individuals

who feel wronged by society, and those who seek vengeance

against powerful enemies. Each of the four sects attracts a

different variety of creatures.

Clerics  who  worship  the  Eyes  air  aspect  wear  white-

trimmed robes. They build temples in the highest mountain

peaks, where screaming winds continually sweep through

the  rocks.  The  mightiest  air  clerics

reside  in  castles  that   oat  among  the

clouds. Harpies, cloud giants, and rene-

gade djinn inhabit these temples, as well

as humanoids riding captive hippogriffs,

griffons, and rocs.

Earth  clerics  wear  amulets  set  with

dozens  of  small  gems,  silver  and  gold

beads, and other earthly treasures. Their

robes are trimmed in yellow, and they

delve  temples  deep  within  the  earth.

Greathorn minotaurs (see page 100) have

a  natural  connection  to  these  places,

owing  to  their  link  with  Ogremoch.

They  serve  as  guardians  and,  in  some

cases,  priests  of  the  Elder  Elemental

Eye. Evil dwarves, duergar, troglodytes,

and grimlocks also  ock to this temples

banner.

Clerics of the Eyes  re aspect wear robes with red trim

and usually have continual  ame cast upon amulets or brace-

lets.  They  have  secret  bases  within  volcanic  tunnels  and

caves, but they are the most nomadic of all the Eyes agents.

Fire priests journey to cities and drought-stricken areas to

set  res that sweep over wide swaths of land. Fire giants,

salamanders, azers, efreet, and similar creatures worship

this aspect.

The water aspect attracts mariners and pirates to its cause.

Water clerics wear robes with dark blue trim. Many of them

carry small jugs  lled with seawater for special ceremonies

and blessings. Aboleths, sahuagin, and krakens worship the

water aspect. Many evil sea druids, particularly those who

seek  to  destroy  seaside  towns,  also  revere  the  Eyes  water

aspect.

PLANS AND AIMS

The cult of the Elder Elemental Eye aims to destroy civiliza-

tion and usher in a new age. The Elemental Princes foresee

a world of pure chaos dominated by elemental forces. The

earth will shudder and crack, swallowing cities whole. The

seas will rise and smash into the land, dragging living crea-

tures to a watery grave. Volcanoes will blast forth torrents of

lava, consuming all in their path. The winds will howl with

rage,  sweeping  away  civilization  and  tearing  it  into  dust.

The cultists believe they alone will be saved because of their

diligence, obedience, and faith.

Cults can operate behind innocent faades. For example,

clerics of the Eyes earth aspect might in ltrate a mining

operation  under  the  pretext  of  uniting  the  miners  into  a

union or guild. The rank-and- le members pay a few coins for

dues each month; in return, the guild ensures safe working

conditions. Skilled and ambitious guild members work their

way up the ranks, with the most trustworthy initiated into

the clergy. The clerics build a small temple deep within the

mine, a protected base of operations near a city or town. This

gives them a pool of unwitting minions who see adventurers

who challenge the clerics as thugs sent to break up the guild.

The clerics use divine healing to put the miners in their debt:

A worker is unlikely to turn against the guildmaster who

used remove disease to save a relatives life. As the guild grows

more powerful, it is a useful shield against investigation and

suspicion.

THE ELEMENTAL NODES

The Elder Elemental Eye commands its followers to seek out

and claim sacred places throughout the world. The Elemen-

tal Princes believe the Eye uses these sites as conduits for its

great  power.  By  sanctifying  and  properly  attuning  such  a

location, the cult transforms it into an elemental node. When

enough  nodes  are  prepared,  the  energy   owing  through

them grows great enough to allow the Elder Elemental Eye

to return to the world. Clerics of the Eye erect temples in and

around the nodes and recruit beasts, outsiders, and elemen-

tals to guard them against intrusion.

Each node requires a speci c, complex ritual to activate

its powers. Such rituals can require months, if not years, of

research to uncover. Once established, an elemental node

usually contains strange edi ces, artifacts, and landmarks. A

 re node might consist of a sphere of crackling energy  oat-

ing in the middle of a lava lake deep within a volcano. An air

node could be a set of powerful winds that blow in a regu-

lar pattern high above the clouds, with a silver, latticelike

structure  oating amid them and a stone altar at the center.

Regardless of their exact forms, these places are inimical to

good creatures.

THE ELEMENTAL AVATARS

The avatars of Elemental Evil have only recently appeared.

Each avatar is the living will of an Prince of Elemental Evil.

It  contains  a  tiny  fragment  of  the  corresponding  princes

essence and exists solely to advance its creators cause on the

Material Plane. The avatars gather at important sites such

as recently discovered elemental nodes or other places that

might be key to returning the Eye to the world. Sometimes

they serve as mighty engines of war for the clerics of the

Elder Elemental Eye.

The  simmering  war  between  each  faction  of  the  Elder

Elemental Eyes priests draws in the avatars as well. These

creatures are just as likely to turn against each other as they

are to ally against a powerful threat.

BLACK ROCK TRISKELION

angular body is covered with spikes and sharp ridges. It unfurls

three long arms, each ending in a long, vicious point: Two extend

slightly  forward,  while  the  third  sprouts  from  the  center  of  its

back to loom over its head. Three short, powerful legs support

it like a tripod.

Strategies and Tactics

Black rock triskelions operate under the close supervision of

powerful earth clerics of the Elder Elemental Eye, warding

off attacks to protect the clerics spellcasting. A cult might

leave a triskelion to guard a newfound earth node until it can

be properly forti ed. Triskelions form the front line against

invaders or heretics.

The dimmest of the four elemental avatars, a black rock

triskelion is a simple brute. It wades into its foes and lashes

out with its three arms, exulting in the chaos and pain it

causes. It can reduce lesser opponents to bleeding carcasses

with a few strikes. If it  nds an opponent easy to hit, it uses

Power Attack to further increase its devastating damage. In

some cases, an earth cleric rides a triskelion into battle. The

cleric hammers a thick adamantine chain into the creatures

upper body to hold onto while perched on one of its spikes.

Triskelions accept no other riders.

Sample Encounters

Black  rock  triskelions  defend  the  earth  temples  that

Ogremoch bids them serve.

Guard (EL 1821): Any temple led by a 12th-level

or higher earth cleric of the Eye receives one triskel-

ion as a guardian. Ogremoch might dispatch more

to protect an elemental node or to assist the sect

against a powerful air,  re, or water faction of

the Elemental Eye.

EL  18:  A  lone  triskelion  stands  watch

over a hidden passage leading into an earth

temple of the Eye. It hides beneath the sur-

face, just past a magic trap that causes a wall

of stone to block the passage 30 feet behind the

party. When the trap activates, the triskelion emerges

in front of the intruders and attacks.

Ecology

Black rock triskelions are not natural beings but are sent to

the defense of Ogremochs temples and earth nodes. They

do not reproduce; the Elemental Prince must create a new

avatar at need. Once created, a triskelion serves its elemental

masters until destroyed.

Environment:  Black  rock  triskelions  are  native  to  the

Elemental Plane of Earth but are usually found in subter-

ranean  locales,  typically  in  an  earth  temple  of  the  Elder

Elemental Eye or an earth node.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A black rock triske-

lion stands 16 feet tall and weighs around 6,000 pounds. It

resembles a great pillar of dark stone.

Alignment: As the creation of Ogremoch, a black rock

triskelion is always neutral evil.

Typical Treasure

Black rock triskelions rarely have any treasure of their own.

As guardians of earth temples, they turn valuables looted from

enemies over to the priests of the Elder Elemental Eye.

This creature composed of howling winds is

obviously an elemental. This result reveals all

elemental traits and the air subtype.

This creature is a cyclonic ravager, an avatar of

Yan-C-Bin, Prince of Evil Air Elementals. Its

transparent body is made only of violent wind.

The cyclonic ravagers command of air allows it to

move its opponents and allies around the

battlefield.

A cyclonic ravager can tear a creature apart with

blasts of wind, but creatures immune to critical

hits take far less damage.

Yan-C-Bin,  the  Prince  of  Evil  Air  Elementals,  sends  the

cyclonic  ravager  to  toss  enemies  about  like  kites  in  a

hurricane.

Strategies and Tactics

Its ability to generate mighty winds allows a cyclonic rav-

ager to take control of the battle eld. It  ings its opponents

through the air, sending them crashing into each other and

disrupting their tactics and spellcasting.

A cyclonic ravager works best when it  ghts alongside the

other denizens of an air temple of the Elder Elemental Eye.

It generates air currents within an opponents body that rip

apart its organs. However, this attack form has little effect

against creatures such as elementals and constructs, which

are immune to extra damage from critical hits. Against such

opposition, the ravager hangs back to direct the others in

melee, using its buffeting winds to unbalance and interfere

with opponents or blast them into disadvantageous positions.

It can also move allies into better tactical situations.

Sample Encounter

Cyclonic ravagers  ght best side by side with big, strong mon-

sters that can take advantage of the chaos they produce.

Strike Force (EL 16): A cyclonic ravager and three cloud

giants form the primary strike force for an air temple. The

ravagers  buffeting  winds  prevent  melee  combatants  from

closing with the giants, who exploit their great reach while

forcing spellcasters into melee range. The ravager also uses

its winds to move the giants into  anking positions or rescue

them from dangerous situations.

Ecology

A cyclonic ravager assists air priests of the Elder Elemental

Eye. It is a cunning tactician and an excellent complement to

a temples spellcasting forces. Yan-C-Bin dispatches a ravager

when the temple is hard pressed, especially when servants

of the other Elemental Princes attack.

Environment: Cyclonic ravagers are native to the Elemen-

tal Plane of Air and are usually found in an air temple of the

Elder Elemental Eye or an air node. Ravagers ride the winds

wherever their duties take them.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  cyclonic  ravager

stands 16 feet tall and weighs around 5 pounds. It looks like

a tall, thin column of dust-roiled air but has humanoid fea-

tures.

Alignment: As the creation of Yan-C-Bin, a cyclonic rav-

ager is always neutral evil.

Typical Treasure

Cyclonic ravagers collect treasures for their prince, Yan-C-

Bin. They prefer coins and gems, which they catch within

their winds and swirl about in complex patterns that serve

as paeans to their dread lord. A cyclonic ravager has standard

treasure for its Challenge Rating, about 22,000 gp.

Heat Aura (Su) At the end of each of their turns, creatures

within 15 feet of a holocaust disciple must succeed on

DC 27 Fortitude saves or be fatigued. A successful save

negates the effect. A fatigued creature that fails its save

becomes exhausted. A creature must attempt this saving

throw each round it is within range, whether or not it has

succeeded on an earlier save. A creature that has resistance

or immunity to fire damage is immune to this effect, as is

a creature that is not subject to the effects of extreme heat

conditions. The fatigued and exhausted conditions end

1 minute after leaving the auras area of effect. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Fire Bolt (Su) A holocaust disciple can aim a bolt of fire at

a single target as a melee or ranged touch attack. The

ranged touch attack has a maximum range of 200 feet

with no range increment.

Flame Wave (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a

holocaust disciple can generate a wave of flame that

rolls out from its body. Any creature within 60 feet

of the holocaust disciple must succeed on a DC 29

Reflex save or take 13d6 points of fire damage. A

successful save results in half damage. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

incredibly hot, sapping the vitality from the stoutest warrior

in mere moments.

Sample Encounter

Holocaust disciples often team up with  re giants. While the

giants wade into melee, the disciples hang back and provide

ranged support.

EL 16: Four  re giants protect a holocaust disciple that

leads raids to destroy human towns and villages. When the

giants engage a foe, the disciple surrounds the melee with

its  ame wave. It then  ies above the battle and attacks with

its  re bolts.

Ecology

Holocaust  disciples  are  unnatural  beings  of  malevolent

 re.  Ones  presence  in  an  area  is  unmistakable ames

and  destruction  spread  everywhere.  Imix  sends  a  disciple

to provide support to  re priests who are on campaign. The

creature is wickedly clever, but its attention rarely strays from

laying waste to everything in site.

Environment:  Holocaust  disciples  are  native  to  the

Elemental Plane of Fire but often accompany wandering  re

priests of the Elder Elemental Eye. Occasionally one occupies

a  re node, but its thirst for destruction causes it to chafe if

it remains in such a stable location for long.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A holocaust disciple

stands 16 feet tall and weighs around 4 pounds.

Alignment: As the creation of Imix, a holocaust disciple

is always neutral evil.

Typical Treasure

A holocaust disciple has standard treasure for its Challenge

Rating, about 22,000 gp. Holocaust disciples prefer mate-

rials  that  can  withstand  great  heat,  such  as  gems  and

magic items. They also love to collect coins to melt them

down and reshape into strange art objects. Collectors who

specialize  in  alien,  planar  art  forms  pay  good  prices  for

such  nished works.

Holocaust disciple

The flame wave damage increases by 1d6 for every 2

additional HD the flame holocaust disciple possesses.

Elemental Grace (Su) A holocaust disciple gains a

bonus equal to its Charisma bonus on saving throws.

Included above.

A holocaust disciple is an elemental avatar crafted by Imix,

Prince of Evil Fire Elementals. This fearsome creature bakes

the area around it with withering heat.

Strategies and Tactics

Holocaust disciples relish spreading destruction and misery

with their searing  ames. Their impressive intellects are bent

solely to this purpose. In battle, a disciple uses sound tactics

to burn its foes while minimizing risks to itself; for example,

it might  y over opponents and rain  ame down on them. It

prefers to work with  re giants and red dragons, relying on

such powerful creatures to engage enemies in melee while

it indiscriminately  lls the area with  re.

A disciples  ames affect creatures both near and far. It

can project bolts of  re up to 200 feet away or wash the area

around  it  in  a  wave  of   ame.  As  well,  the  air  around  it  is

Liquid Body (Ex) A waterveiled assassin exercises supreme

control over its watery form, allowing it to flow around

attacks, flatten itself against the ground to avoid a spells

blast, and so forth. Any effect or spell that allows a Reflex

save for half damage has a 50% chance to have no effect

on a waterveiled assassin.

Malleable Form (Ex) A waterveiled assassins control over

its form allows it to flow through tiny cracks in objects

and move through the earth, walls, and other obstacles.

The assassin moves at normal speed through terrain

that slows movement. It can move through permeable

objects at half speed, but it cannot move through

completely solid barriers. For example, an assassin could

flow through a wooden or brick wall by squeezing into

cracks and channels, but it could not move through a

wall of solid iron or rock, such as that produced by wall

of stone.

If the assassin ends its movement completely within

an object, opponents do not have line of sight or line

of effect to it. Its reach drops to 0 feet. Any creatures

engulfed within the assassin (see Engulf below) fall out,

dropping prone at the edge of the object. If only part

of the assassin is in an object, but its remaining space

cannot hold all the creatures within it, the assassin

chooses which ones to release.

Churn (Ex) As a swift action, a waterveiled assassin can

create mighty currents within its body that grind engulfed

creatures, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

An engulfed creature that succeeds on a DC 30 Fortitude

save takes half damage. The save DC is Strength-based.

Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a waterveiled assassin can

flow over Medium or smaller creatures, entrapping them

within its liquid form. The assassin simply moves into the

opponents space; any creature whose space it completely

covers is subject to the engulf attack. The assassin cannot

make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. It

can engulf as many creatures as fit in its space.

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against

the assassin, but if they do so they are not entitled to

a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of

opportunity must succeed on DC 30 Reflex saves or be

engulfed; on a success, a creature moves aside or back

(opponents choice) to move out of the assassins path.

The save DC is Strength-based.

Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled

within the assassins body, and they are subject to its

churn attack (see above). Engulfed creatures that breathe

air might drown (DMG 304).

One With Water (Ex) Since a waterveiled assassins body is

liquid, it can simply disappear into water. An assassin in

a volume of water at least 15 feet wide, 15 feet long, and

15 feet deep is invisible. It remains invisible as long as it

remains within water, even if it attacks.

Skills A waterveiled assassin has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A waterveiled assassin is a creature of living water sent by

Olhydra, Prince of Evil Water Elementals, to slay her cults

enemies. This deadly killer can  ow through the smallest

cracks to ambush and engulf foes, and its  uid form lets it

strike at opponents from a great distance.

Strategies and Tactics

Waterveiled  assassins  are  cunning  hunters  that  take  full

advantage  of  terrain  and  their  special  abilities  to  surprise

foes. An assassin prefers to lurk within a wall, a large statue,

or  another  similar  object  that  can  contain  its  bulk.  From

there, it watches its targets, attacking when they least expect

it. The creature is clever enough to focus on spellcasters and

other  opponents  with  dangerous  abilities.  Its  liquid  form

makes it dif cult to injure, so it ignores physical attacks. This

con dence sometimes leads to rashness: An assassin might

leap on a partys wizard, disregarding melee combatants until

they have dealt it serious damage.

A waterveiled assassin travels through a river or stream

to in ltrate a city or enemy camp. Once there, it relies on

information from the temples spies and scouts, or clerics

divination magic, to  nd its target. The assassin attempts to

engulf and drag off the victim to an isolated spot for the kill.

It usually lets weaker creatures drown within its liquid body.

Stronger  targets  require  coordinated  attacks;  for  example,

the assassin might drag a foe to a nearby river and a waiting

team of sahuagin.

Sample Encounters

Waterveiled assassins specialize in hunting down

and slaying the enemies of the Elder Elemental

Eye.  An  assassin  is   usually  encountered  alone,

but  one  might  work  with  assistants  against

challenging foes.

Individual  (EL  15):  A  solitary  assassin

relies  on  information  from  the  temple  that

called it.

EL 15: A waterveiled assassin lurks within

the well near a busy inn, lying in wait for a

band of adventurers that have caused trouble

for the Elder Elemental Eye. When the targets

arrive at the inn, a half-orc spy for the water

temple gives the signal to attack. That night,

the assassin  ows through the ground and the

inns  oor and walls to fall upon its enemies

one at a time.

Assassination Team (EL 1617): Stronger

targets require coordinated attacks, often using

sahuagin minions.

EL 16: A waterveiled assassin teams up with

a pair of sahuagin assassins (LE rogue 5/assas-

sin 6) who swim within its body. It engulfs one

opponent at a time, which the sahuagin attack

with their claws and teeth while the avatar wards

off  the  targets  allies.  It  does  not  use  its  churn

ability in this case, since it does not want to harm

the engulfed sahuagin.

Ecology

A waterveiled assassin is the highest gift that Olhydra can

bestow  upon  priests  of  the  Elder  Elemental  Eye.  Within

water  temples,  assassins  occupy  hallowed  positions  as

embodiments  of  Olhydras  will.  In  addition  to  being  a

weapon against powerful foes, an assassin offers advice and

counsel to the clerics and might even lead the temple. Under-

lings, usually sahuagin rogues or rangers, help it track down

the temples enemies.

Environment:  Waterveiled  assassins  are  native  to  the

Elemental Plane of Water but are usually found in aquatic

locales, typically in a water temple of the Elder Elemental

Eye or a water node. Any body of water might contain an

assassin that is on a mission.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A waterveiled assassin

stands 16 feet tall and weighs around 3,000 pounds. It looks

like a towering wave of murky water.

Alignment:  As  the  creation  of  Olhydra,  a  waterveiled

assassin is always neutral evil.

Typical Treasure

Waterveiled assassins are greedy creatures that seek to accu-

mulate as much wealth as possible. A waterveiled assassin has

standard treasure for its Challenge Rating, about 22,000 gp.

It displays its status among Olhydras followers by display-

ing gems, gold, and other durable items suspended within

its body. Although it leaves behind such valuables when on a

mission, within a water temple, an assassin takes great pains to

show off its trophiesat least one from each of its victims.

Dweomersight (Su) A balhannoth can sense the presence

and position of magic auras within 120 feet of itself,

and knows the strength and school of each one. It can

pinpoint the location of any creature with ongoing spells

cast on it, carrying magic items, or otherwise using

magic, and it can notice anything within the area of a

magic effect (including its own dimensional lock aura).

This otherwise functions like blindsense.

Dimensional Lock (Su) As the dimensional lock spell,

This effect moves with the creature.

Constrict (Ex) A balhannoth deals 1d8 points of damage

with a successful grapple check, in addition to damage

from its slam attack.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a balhannoth must

hit an opponent of up to Large size with a slam attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Antimagic Grapple (Su) When a balhannoth grapples an

opponent, all the magical properties of that opponents

magic items are suppressed. In addition, a creature

grappled by a balhannoth cannot cast spells or use

spell-like or supernatural abilities. A balhannoth

automatically suppresses magic items by holding or

wearing them.

Camouflage (Ex) A balhannoths skin changes color to

match its surroundings. As a result, a balhannoth can

use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain.

Skills A balhannoth has a +15 racial bonus on Hide checks

due to its camouflage ability. It has a +8 racial bonus

15

Horrid aberrations of the subterranean realm, balhannoths

hunt by tracking magical energy. They can see magic but

are  otherwise  blind.  Nothing  magical  functions  in  their

powerful grips, making these predators especially deadly to

those who rely on spells or magic items.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Balhannoths hunt by ambush, not stalking. While swift in

short sprints, a balhannoth is too bulky to pursue quarry

through the narrow, twisting passages of the underground.

The most common balhannoth tactic is to wait motionless

in  a  large  cavern,  blending  in  with  a  natural  rock  wall  or

clinging to the ceiling with its powerful, prehensile limbs.

When it detects potential quarry using its dweomersight, the

balhannoth charges in to attack the creature with the most

or the strongest magical effects. It readily uses Power Attack

to smash down its most threatening opponents.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Balhannoths  usually  hunt  alone,  but  in  areas  of  plentiful

and powerful magic, they might gather in groups of up to

six members.

Bodyguards (EL 1214): Powerful creatures sometimes

employ balhannoths as guardians, feeding them meat and

occasionally giving them magic items from which they can

draw power.

EL 14: A pair of mind  ayers have charmed three balhan-

noths, which they now use as bodyguards while they travel

through  the  underground.  They  set  the  balhannoths  on

other creatures encountered on their journey and allow the

creatures to feed on the auras of any magic items. The mind

 ayers con scate the items after the creatures grow tired of

their tastes. Once they  nd a good location for a lair near a

This bizarre creature is a balhannoth, an aberration

native to the underground. This result reveals all

aberration traits.

Balhannoths are specially adapted to hunt by

sensing magic. If you carry no magic items and

arent the subject of an ongoing spell, you are

invisible to a balhannoth unless you are very close.

Balhannoths eat flesh but also absorb magical

energy, feeding off magic items without harming

them. They store magic items in their lairs like

meat in a larder.

Balhannoths suppress any magic items they touch

and magical effects of any creatures they grapple.

A balhannoth is surrounded by a dimensional lock

effect. This prevents magical escape and allows

the creature to discern its surroundings.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

humanoid settlement, the illithids plan to station the balhan-

noths on its perimeterthe aberrations are too dangerous

to keep nearby for long.

ECOLOGY

Balhannoths evolved to  ll an unusual niche in the magic-

permeated underground realms. They are attuned to magic

and use its presence to detect their prey.

Balhannoths feed on both  esh and magical auras. A magic

item with a faint aura sustains a balhannoth for a day, one

with a moderate aura gives food for a week, and one with a

strong  aura  is  suf cient  for  a  month.  How  long  a  balhan-

noth  might  survive  on  an  overwhelming  magical  aura  is

unknown, but some scholars believe an item of such power

might  sustain  it  for  life.  A  balhannoth  enjoys  the  taste  of

magic but does no permanent harm to an item. Eventually

it tires of the magics  avor and must seek out a new source

of nourishment.

The  strange  feeding  needs  of  balhannoths  drive  them

to attack and kill magic-bearing individuals. The creatures

cant tell the difference between a magic item and an ongo-

ing spell effect, so they attack anything they can detect with

their dweomersight. A creature without magic is in no danger

unless it enters the area of a balhannoths dimensional lock

aura, rendering it visible to the predator.

Once  a  balhannoth  has  killed  its  prey  and  dealt  with

any other threats, it takes the corpse back to its lair. There

it devours the  esh and separates out any magic items the

creature  possessed.  It  chooses  one  item  to  carry  and  feed

on,  placing  the  others  in  a  hidden  or  hard-to-reach  place.

Common hiding places for such food stores include cavities

beneath large boulders or cracks in cavern ceilings.

Balhannoths have no genderany one can impregnate

any other. They do not mark mating with ritual but simply

touch tentacles in greeting, which impregnates each of them.

One year later, each balhannoth lays a single egg about the

size  of  an  ale  keg.  The  egg  must  remain  in  contact  with

a  magic  item  or  within  the  area  of  a  magic  effect  until  it

hatches. Most balhannoths keep their eggs with their food

stores, but some establish separate caches. A balhannoth that

cant  nd suitable food near its lair carries the egg to a better

location. While so engaged, a balhannoth can use only one

slam attack; it usually  ees combat rather than risk breaking

the egg. Balhannoth eggs hatch after a month, and the young

reach maturity in three years.

Although intelligent enough to learn the rudiments of a

language, few balhannoths can speak. Only those kept in

captivity and trained as guardians gain some understanding

of their masters tongue, speaking in deep, growling voices.

They  possess  small  vocabularies  and  have  little  grasp  of

syntax.

Environment: Balhannoths can be found in any under-

ground terrain.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical balhannoth

stands approximately 9 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs

about 4,000 pounds.

Alignment: Balhannoths are ravenous predators, unpre-

dictable in their behavior but not inherently evil. They are

usually chaotic neutral.

SAMPLE LAIR:

BALHANNOTH CAVERN

This broad, high-ceilinged cavern lies not far from a major

subterranean trade route. The balhannoth that dwells here

preys on herd animals, beasts of burden, and the occasional

sentient being that loses its way in the caverns.

1. Balhannoth Ambush (EL 11)

This large cavern is crowded with thick natural pillars that reach

to the 20-foot-high ceiling.

A balhannoth clings to the ceiling in the space labeled 1,

waiting for unsuspecting travelers to pass beneath.

2. The Broken Bridge (EL 4)

A narrow ribbon of worn stone stretches into the darkness. The

roar of rushing water echoes from below.

This narrow stone bridge is crumbling and unstable. Moving

over  the  surface  requires  a  DC  20  Balance  check  to  avoid

falling. The current in the water below is swift and  ows

toward  area  4.  Characters  in  the  water  must  succeed  on  a

DC 20 Swim check or be dragged under, taking 1d6 points

of damage before emerging in area 4.

3. Balhannoth Lair

This chamber is where the balhannoth sleeps and consumes

its prey. Several partially eaten bodies remain here and still

have useful items: A search of the remains uncovers 40 gp,

a gem worth 55 gp, a suit of rhino hide armor, and a potion of

delay poison.

4. Underground River

This  is  a  continuation  of  the  river  beneath  the  bridge  in

area 2. It is deep and swift- owing. A character in the water

who  fails  a  DC  20  Swim  check  is  swept  away  under  the

wall, taking 3d6 points of damage from the battering before

emerging in a new area. This can be a good way to draw the

PCs on to the next leg of an adventure.

5. Subterranean Trade Road (EL 11)

A winding pathway extends for miles into the underground.

If the PCs are having too easy a time with the balhannoth,

have  a  drow  patrol  of  three  dark  snipers  and  two  arcane

guards (see the Drow entry on page 55) happen along the

road and engage the party from the rear.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Because of the way they feed, balhannoths are more likely

than other creatures to have magical treasure. Most of this

is kept in the creatures lair and has a value appropriate to a

CR 10 creature, about 5,800 gp. Balhannoths have one-half

the normal amount in coins but have double items.

BALHANNOTHS IN EBERRON

Balhannoths can be found throughout Khyber, but they are

most common in the deep caverns below the continent of

Xendrik. There they frequently come into contact with drow

nomads, and among certain tribes the word balhannoth

means a particularly skilled, cunning hunter.

BALHANNOTHS IN FAERN

Balhannoths are mostly found scattered through the North-

dark,  with  particular  concentrations  along  the  borders  of

Anauroch. This unusual distribution has led sages to hypoth-

esize that the creatures were created by Netherese wizards

to assassinate their rivals.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

As mindless creatures, blood re oozes do not employ any

tactics  beyond  overwhelm  and  burn.  Intelligent  crea-

tures often create them to serve as guards and to enhance

their  own  magical  abilities.  Evil  evokers  especially  favor

these oozes because they empower  re spells cast nearby in

addition to providing physical defense. Evil outsiders that

can use  re spells or abilities seek out or create these

creatures as well.

Blood re ooze

Blood re oozes come into existence only through twisted

rituals and have no place in the natural world.

The more blood a blood re ooze consumes, the larger it

grows; the blood of good creatures provides superior nutri-

tion. Gargantuan and larger blood re oozes require the blood

of hundreds of creatures to create. Once an ooze comes into

existence, it mindlessly pursues further nourishment.

Environment: Blood re oozes are found in evil temples

(abandoned  or  otherwise),  the  demesnes  of  evil  evokers,

and the territories of powerful  re creatures. They roam the

underground realm in places, but few survive long that wander

abovegroundthe   res  they  create  rapidly  draw  attention.

Blood re  oozes  frequently  remain  inside  the  massive  caul-

drons that spawned them or lie in wait in shallow pits.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  blood re  ooze

resembles an enormous, living mass of burning blood. As the

creature moves, faces of tormented souls appear on the sur-

500 XP on its completion.

A blood re ooze obeys simple commands from its creator,

such as guard this temple or attack anyone who enters but

me, but it ignores more complicated orders. Commanding a

blood re ooze requires the creator to be within 30 feet.

BLOODFIRE OOZES IN EBERRON

Blood re oozes are commonly found in the Demon Wastes,

the result of hideous rituals conducted by the rakshasas and

other vile beings. Adventurers also report the presence of

blood re  oozes  protecting  long-forgotten  temples  under-

neath Sharn and the cyclopean ruins of Xendrik.

BLOODFIRE OOZES IN FAERN

Blood re oozes are most common in Thay. The Red Wiz-

ards create them to guard laboratories, temples, and other

important locations.

BLOODHULK

Bloodhulks are corpses reanimated through an infusion of

the blood of innocent victims in a dark and horrible ritual.

Their bloated bodies are  lled with viscous gore and unholy

 uids, providing them with the endurance to absorb an amaz-

ing amount of punishment before falling.

Although bloodhulk  ghters are the most common form

of  this  undead,  necromancers  and  vile  priests  sometimes

create  larger,  more  ferocious  versions,  such  as  bloodhulk

giants and bloodhulk crushers.

Blood Bloated (Ex) As bloodhulk fighter.

The  most  powerful  version  of  this  undead,  a  bloodhulk

crusher is a living engine of destruction. Evil clerics use these

beasts as walking engines of war. Their tremendous durabil-

ity and great strength allow them to batter down castle gates,

smash apart buildings, and crush smaller  creatures.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A bloodhulk can absorb a tremendous amount of punish-

ment,  though  its  vulnerability  to  piercing  and  slashing

weapons  gives  adventurers  an  advantage  against  it.  This

mindless,  bloated  automaton  sloshes  about,  following  the

orders  of  its  creator  without  thought.  Because  of  its  utter

lack of intelligence, the instructions given to a newly cre-

ated bloodhulk must be very simple, such as Kill anyone

who enters this room.

Bloodhulks can be encountered singly or in groups, depend-

ing on the proclivities of their creator and their purpose. Their

immense strength and ability to absorb damage makes them

useful as guards, tougher than zombies but not as expensive

or complex as  esh golems. Bloodhulks are commonly found

shuf ing alongside other minor undead servants in a necro-

mancers lair or a temple to an evil god of death.

Most evil spellcasters who employ bloodhulks use them as

bodyguards. While a bloodhulk holds back a band of adven-

turers, its master can rain spells and ranged attacks upon

them. A bloodhulks durability makes it possible to drop area

attacks upon both the bloodhulk and those it is  ghting. In

most cases, the undead can better absorb the punishment

than its opponents.

It took me a moment to realize what this horror was.

Wed lost Inthord to an attack by undead weeks earlier,

and we never found the body. I only recognized him by

the birthmark on his cheek.

Rous, explorer

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Adventurers  are  most  likely  to  encounter  bloodhulks  as

second-tier guardians. The creatures can be found individu-

ally or in small groups.

Individual (EL 48): A single bloodhulk usually serves as

a guardian assigned to slow down intruders while a general

alarm is raised.

EL 4: A bloodhulk  ghter guards the entrance to a temple

of Erythnul hidden within a dungeon. If it spots intruders,

it walks over to a huge bronze gong and strikes it each round

unless it is attacked, at which point it retaliates in kind. The

ringing gong alerts the temple inhabitants.

Patrol (EL 610): When deployed in groups, bloodhulks

form a daunting, almost impenetrable line of defense.

EL 9: A pair of bloodhulk giants blocks a 40-foot-wide cor-

ridor within a dungeon. The bloodhulks stand watch over the

passage to prevent adventurers or wandering monsters from

disturbing a hobgoblin necromancer and his assistants. The

necromancer and his followers are in the process of excavat-

ing a tomb hidden within the dungeon.

Bodyguard (EL 1020): A high-ranking priest or necro-

that act as meat shields against physical attack.

EL 13: A 12th-level cleric of Hextor uses two bloodhulk

 ghters and a pair of bloodhulk crushers as personal body-

guards. The monsters surround him while he casts his spells.

The crushers great reach allows them to swat at opponents

who move close to the cleric, while the  ghters protect his

 anks  and  make  it  impossible  for  his  foes  to  get  next  to

him.

ECOLOGY

Bloodhulks are completely mindless. Their wretched exis-

tence is at the pleasure of their creators, and their destruction

is inconsequential (though unpleasantly messy). Creating a

bloodhulk requires a ritual of bloody sacri ce culminating

in a spell of animation. Most living corporeal beings can be

made into these horrors.

Environment:  As  created  beings,  bloodhulks  can  be

found in any environment. Typically they patrol grim tem-

ples, moldering tombs, and precincts devoted to blasphemous

observances.

Some spellcasters display a preference for creating blood-

hulks  over  more  standard  undead  servants.  In  particular,

evil blood magi (Complete Arcane 26) who specialize in nec-

romancy cant resist innovative methods of using blood.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Bloodhulks  are

disgusting  to  behold,  resembling  swollen,  muscle-bound

corpses whose skin writhes with purulent veins. They stink

of festering wounds and make an unsettling slurping sound

as they move. They wear no armor and at most are covered

with ragged fragments of clothing, having outgrown their

former garments.

A bloodhulk is the same height as the typical creature for

its size but has a much bulkier build. The sheer volume of

blood sloshing around within makes a bloodhulk twice as

heavy as a base creature of comparable size.

Alignment:  Bloodhulks  are  incapable  of  independent

thought or moral judgment, making them neutral in outlook.

However, the horrible ritual of their creation, the cruelty of

their makers, and the grim tasks to which they are set lend

them a taint of evil. All bloodhulks are therefore of neutral

evil alignment.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Bloodhulks  are  servitors  and  possess  no  treasure  of  their

own, although they might be set to guard items of value. Even

those that were once champions of battle no longer wear even

a vestige of armor, nor do they wield weapons.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

The animate dead spell normally allows the creation of only

skeletons and zombies. It can also create bloodhulks, though

the process is more dif cult.

You  can  create  bloodhulk  warriors,  giants,  or  crushers

based solely on the size of the corpse you wish to animate:

A Medium corpse is required for a bloodhulk  ghter, Large

for  a  giant,  and  Huge  for  a  crusher.  Smaller  and  larger

corpses cannot be made into bloodhulks. The creation of

a bloodhulk changes the original corpse too much for it

to retain most of its original features.

In addition to the usual material components, you must

supply blood from three recently slain creatures the same

size as the potential bloodhulk.

Bloodhulks are considered to have double their Hit Dice

for the purpose of creating and controlling them. Thus,

the number of bloodhulks you can create is equal to your

Hit Dice (instead of twice your Hit Dice) if you are not in

a desecrated area. You can control no more than 2 HD worth

of bloodhulks per caster level; if you are attempting to con-

trol different sorts of undead creatures, the bloodhulks are

considered to have twice as many Hit Dice as are shown

in their entries for the purpose of determining the total

number of undead you can control.

BLOODHULKS IN EBERRON

Some worshipers of the Keeper create bloodhulks in rituals

offered to the lord of death and decay. The grossly swollen

creatures are thought to re ect the form of the dark god.

Karrnathi  clerics  might  know  of  the  rituals  that  create

bloodhulks but would never use them for their armies. Such

honorless  monstrosities  do  not  deserve  to  stand  with  the

tireless soldiers who serve their nation in death.

BLOODHULKS IN FAERN

The most notorious necromancer in the Realms is Szass Tam,

the Zulkir of Necromancy in Thay. In addition to creating

dread warriors (Monsters of Faern 46) for Thays armies, he

has been experimenting in recent years with other forms of

undead. Bloodhulks are useful ways to recycle the waste

products of his necromantic research. Szass Tam constructs

bloodhulks with the cold dispassion of a magical researcher.

The  requisite  creatures  are  quickly  slaughtered,  bled,  and

animated.

Velsharoon is the patron and creator of undead, with cults

dedicated to his worship hidden throughout Faern. Some

of these dark servitors produce bloodhulks from captured

townsfolk  and  send  the  bloated  parodies  back  to  torment

and terrify their kin.

Blood Drain (Su) As a swift action each round, a bloodsilk

spider can command its webs to drill into ensnared

creatures, drain their blood, and channel it to the

spider. The spider must be in contact with its webs

to use this ability. A bloodsilk spiders webs deal 1d4

points of damage at the beginning of each round to

an opponent entangled in them. This ability does

not affect elementals, plants, or creatures that lack a

Constitution score.

A bloodsilk spider gains temporary hit points equal

to the damage dealt. A bloodsilk spider can gain no

more than 10 temporary hit points in this fashion. These

temporary hit points last for up to 24 hours.

Blood Web (Ex) A bloodsilk spider can throw a blood-red

web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with

a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range

increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to

one size category larger than the spider. The web anchors

the target in place, allowing no movement. Attempts

to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the

trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while

pulling free.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 11

Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 15

Strength check. Both are standard actions. The check

DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check

DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 12 hit

points and hardness 0. The blood that soaks it gives

the web immunity to fire damage, unlike ordinary

spider webs.

A bloodsilk spider can create sheets of sticky webbing

from 5 to 20 feet square. The webs are red with blood

drained from its victims, and in some places they drip

blood. The spider usually positions these sheets to

snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the

ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20

Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into

it and become trapped as though by a successful web

attack. Each 5-foot section of webbing has 12 hit points

and damage reduction 5/.

A bloodsilk spider can move across its own web at its

climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature

touching its web.

Skills Bloodsilk spiders have a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks (except when in their webs; see above) and a +4

racial bonus on Spot checks.

A bloodsilk spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened. It uses either its

Strength or its Dexterity modifier for Climb checks,

whichever is higher.

Bloodsilk spiders, like their mundane cousins, are ambush

predators  that  feed  on  the  vital   uids  of  their  prey.  They

lurk in reddened webs, which they use to drain blood from

trapped creatures.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Unlike mundane or even monstrous vermin, bloodsilk spi-

ders possess a cunning intelligence. They attack any living

thing for its blood, using their webs to catch and slay even

more prey. They are not powerful individually, so they prefer

to attack in numbers, usually groups of four to eight. One of

the spiders leads off the attack with a blast of webbing, after

which the others charge any snared opponents.

A lone bloodsilk spider strings its webs between two trees,

rocks, or similar landmarks along a forest path. The spider

lurks nearby, using its tremorsense ability to detect a foes

approach. Once a creature is trapped within the webs, the

spider leaps to attack. Its web soaks up the preys blood while

the spider bites with its mandibles.

Bloodsilk  spiders   ghting  opponents  larger  than  them-

selves always wait until they have slain some lesser prey (and

thus  gained  temporary  hit  points)  before  attacking  more

dangerous foes.

It was on the third day that we encountered a pair of

woodsmen with a tale of red webs. Prince Lumien

determined to see these webs for himself, and he

persuaded the holy man Ilix to accompany him. We did

not see them againnot living.

Guldur of the Royal Guard

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Bloodsilk spiders are patient, cunning killers.

Individual (EL 2): A single bloodsilk spider uses hide-

and-pounce tactics to surprise prey. In about one in ten cases,

a lone bloodsilk spider has recently fed and has 5 temporary

hit points stored up.

Cluster (EL 68): Clusters of four to eight bloodsilk spi-

ders lurk in foliage or rubble, waiting for prey to pass by.

Nest (EL 810): A bloodsilk spider nest can contain any-

where  from  eight  to  sixteen  individuals.  At  least  half  the

spiders  in  such  nests  have  fed  recently,  each  with  5  to  10

temporary hit points.

ECOLOGY

Bloodsilk spiders live and reproduce much as other spi-

ders do. They prefer areas of heavy foliage for their lairs,

particularly  if  the  region  contains  plenty  of  animals  to

feed upon. When it has exhausted the local stock of prey,

a spider moves on to another area.

A  bloodsilk  spider  might  instead  inhabit  ruins  if  the

local  forest  has  a  signi cant  number  of  giant  wasps  or

spider  eatersboth  of  which  are  its  deadly  foes.  Even

other varieties of giant spider are troublesome to bloodsilk

spiders, if prey in the area is scarce.

Environment: Bloodsilk spiders are found in warm and

temperate  forests  and  marshes,  particularly  amid  larger

trees or areas of thick undergrowth, where they can blend

in more easily.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical bloodsilk

spider is about 3 feet long and weighs 40 to 50 pounds.

Alignment: Bloodsilk spiders are predators and rarely

take  moral  stances.  Those  inhabiting  an  area  tainted  by

malice might tend toward evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Like  other  monstrous  spiders,  bloodsilk  spiders  do  not

collect treasure, but there is a 50% chance that a bloodsilk

spider  nest  contains  some  coins,  goods,  or  items  left  over

from its victims. Roll separately for each type of treasure.

BLOODSILK SPIDERS IN EBERRON

Bloodsilk  spiders  are  among  the  many  dangers  that  await

adventurers who travel through the Towering Wood of the

Eldeen Reaches. An unwary explorer could easily wander

into a nest of the beasts if he ignores the tell-tale web signs

of a bloodsilk brood. Large populations infest the Gloaming,

where  their  webs  fade  into  the  continual  dimness  of  that

twisted forest. Bloodsilk spiders occasionally wander closer

to the edge of the wood, posing a threat to homesteaders of

the Reaches.

BLOODSILK SPIDERS IN FAERN

In  Faern,  bloodsilk  spiders  inhabit  the  great  forests  of

the  south,  most  notably  within  the  Chondalwood,  where

exceptionally large spiders live among the dangerous  ora.

Hal ing rangers and druids also occasionally muster to battle

infestations  within  the  Lluirwood,  and  nests  of  bloodsilk

spiders can be found in many other forests near the Shaar,

including Qurth Forest and the Thornwood of the Border

Kingdoms. Rumors hold that bloodsilk spiders were born

of  the  Calishite  sorcerers  curse  that  poisoned  the  Qurth

forest, a new form of deadly spider that bred true long after

the sorcerers death.

Bloodsilk spiders are magical beasts named for the

blood-red webs they spin. This result reveals all

magical beast traits.

Bloodsilk spider webs drain blood from trapped

creatures by boring into the flesh. The spider

consumes blood drained by its web, growing

tougher in the process.

A bloodsilk spider is a patient and cunning hunter.

When hunting a creature larger than itself, it first

feeds on smaller prey to gain vitality for the fight.

A nest of bloodsilk spiders is especially dangerous,

because those that have recently fed throw webs

over intruders, trapping them to feed the rest.

BRIARVEX

This  creature  appears  to  be  a  large  humanoid-shaped  plant,

roughly  the  size  of  an  ogre.  Glistening  with  sticky  amber  sap,

wicked  spikes  protrude  from  its  body,  and  a  pair  of  writhing,

tentacular vines extend from its hips.

Improved Woodland Stride (Ex) A briarvex can move through

any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,

overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal

speed and without taking damage or suffering any other

impairment. In addition, thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that have been magically manipulated do not

impede its motion or otherwise affect it.

Thorn Burrow (Su) A briarvexs spiked fist attack deals

piercing as well as bludgeoning damage.

Each time a briarvex hits with its spiked fist, thorns

break off and bore into the struck opponent. As a swift

action, the briarvex can cause embedded thorns to twist

and burrow into a single creatures flesh, dealing 3d6

points of piercing damage; damage reduction applies.

The target of this ability must be within 100 feet of the

briarvex. The briarvex must also have line of effect to the

target. A creature can remove the thorns with a standard

action.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Existing only in limited numbers, briarvexes are preoccupied

with their own survival and prosperity. They seek to populate

forested lands with their spawn, migrating to new areas to

expand their in uence and control.

When they encounter other creatures, briarvexes attempt

to appraise any possible threat from hiding. They are par-

ticularly wary of intruders who bear sources of  re. They

generally  assault  only  creatures  that  appear  weaker  than

themselves,  and  they  prefer  surprise.  A  briarvex  begins

combat  by  entangling  opponents,  then  closes  to  melee

range; it is unaffected by the entangle effect. When facing a

powerful opponent, a briarvex tries to buy time for reinforce-

ments to arrive. It  rst attempts to intimidate the opponent

(typically lying about its companions numbers), and then

resorts to wheedling if that is unsuccessful. Combat is the

last resort.

Briarvexes hate treants (the feeling is mutual) and attack

them on sight. They see treants as their most powerful com-

petition in the war for control of the forest, and they attempt

to eradicate their woodland cousins whenever possible. As

always, they do this from a position of strength, gathering

in greater numbers before launching such an assault.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Briarvexes prefer their own kind, existing in stands of two

to four creatures that migrate from one forested area to the

next, spreading their seed wherever they go. Powerful speci-

mens are occasionally encountered alone, particularly those

devoted to the druids arts. Evil briarvex druids aggressively

patrol  their  territory,  driving  out  or  slaying  all  nonplant

creatures.

Individual (EL 6): A single briarvex hides within a stand

of trees near a campsite commonly used by travelers. It waits

A briarvex is a vicious, aggressive plant creature that haunts

old-growth forests, dense swamps, and other areas choked

with plant life. Briarvexes are able to control plants, thereby

entangling their foes, or pierce opponents with spiny thorns

that animate to drill into the  esh. These creatures are com-

monly referred to as vine ogres.

A briarvexs strikes implant thorns into a creature.

These thorns can animate and burrow into the

patiently until the party approaches and beds down for the

night. It then creeps up to the campsite and attacks the near-

est sleeping traveler, using its entangle ability to prevent any

sentries from interfering. If the travelers openly carry any

expensive goods or treasure, the briarvex presses the attack

to steal as much as possible.

Pair (EL 8): A pair of briarvexes form a daunting combina-

tion. One uses its entangle ability each round to lock down

enemies. The other wades into melee to rip into the trapped

creatures.

Sages and druids who know of the briarvexes believe they

originated somewhere in the Nine Hells of Baator but at some

point were transported wholly to earthly realms.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Briarvexes stand from

9 to 12 feet tall at maturity and can weigh as much as 1,500

pounds. They do not eat, but they do require a reliable source

of water and access to sunlight.

Alignment:  Briarvexes  are  almost  always  neutral  evil.

Older, more powerful individuals grow more malign with

age, tending toward chaotic evil.

ECOLOGY

Briarvexes  seek  only  to  propagate,  spreading  their  seeds

across  any  lands  with  habitable  soil.  They  view  all  other

creaturesespecially treantsas potential threats to their

continued  existence.  Against  stronger  beings,  briarvexes

might attempt diplomatic maneuvers while they grow their

population to unstoppable numbers. However, they seek to

remove weaker creatures forcibly from areas they inhabit.

A rare few briarvexes have attempted to establish peaceful

relations with other creatures that live nearby, particularly

gnolls, but most consider such lesser beings to be nuisanc-

es  t only to fertilize the soil.

A newly sprouted briarvex seedling spends the  rst two

years of its life inert and rooted in the ground, looking like

a large, gnarled bush. Once it has fully matured, it awakens,

uproots itself, and moves out into the world.

Briarvexes  can  sow  tremendous  numbers

of  their  kind,  though  excessive  planting

greatly strains the soil and water table.

However, in areas blessed with rich

soil  and  plentiful  rain,  their

numbers  can  explode,

leading  to  disaster.  At

least  twice  in  recorded

history,  briarvexes

have managed to plant

almost  a  thousand  of

their kind in the course

of  a  year  near  a  city

that  poorly  patrolled

the  nearby  wilds.

Two  years  later,  the

unlucky  city  found

itself  under  attack  by  a

horde of the creatures.

Environment:  Bri-

arvexes  seek  out  the

darkest  parts  of  large

forests, where their dis-

tinguishing  features  are

less  noticeable.  Once  there,

they  clear  an  area  of  the

canopy  to  gain  access

to  daylight,  but

do  so  as  unobtru-

sively as  possible.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Briarvexes have an innate love of shiny gems and gold coins.

These  creatures  weave  such  objects  into  their  thorns  and

vines to display trophies of past victories. A briarvex has stan-

dard treasure for its Challenge Rating, about 2,000 gp.

BRIARVEXES WITH CLASS LEVELS

Briarvexes  are  generally  not  suitable  as  player  characters,

but some learn druid magic. Briarvex druids usually become

leaders of their kind, though a few strike out on their own.

Level Adjustment: +4.

BRIARVEXES IN EBERRON

Nobody  is  quite  sure  when  briarvexes  appeared  in  Khor-

vaire, though stands of the creatures began

wandering out of the Mournland shortly

after  the  end  of  the  Last  War.  They

seem to migrate in patterns, but the

meanings  of  these  patterns  are

unclear. Perhaps the elder races

and the giants know, but they

are  not  telling.  Meanwhile,

the dragons study this new

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

As  mindless  constructs,  clockroaches  exercise  limited,

preprogrammed  tactics.  A  clockroach  attacks  only  when

defending  itself  or  if  a  creature  is  in  an  area  its  been

instructed to clear. In either case, it uses its breath weapon

as often as possible, using its pincers while recharging its

reserve of acid. A clockroach also uses its acid to bore through

obstacles between it and its objective.

Final journal entry of

Ingalla Asterian, arti cer

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Clockroaches  are  most  often  found  in  subterranean  com-

pounds, usually in cleaning crews of up to six individuals.

Hordes of clockroaches descend on the battle elds of the

planes, posing hazards to the unwary traveler.

Guardian (EL 1): A single clockroach can be programmed

to attack anything that it sees or any creature that doesnt give

an approved signal or password.

EL 1: Guarding the entrance to a brigands cave is one clock-

roach. It never moves more than 30 feet from the entrance,

and it doesnt enter the cave or attack anything within it. It

ignores  any  creature  that  either  gives  the  password  Cin-

namon or waves with just two  ngers raised. It otherwise

attacks anything that moves.

Clean  Sweep  (EL  26):  On  extraplanar  battlegrounds,

clockroaches scour the refuse of old combats clean, leaving

the  eld fresh for new battles.

EL 6: On one of the endless battle elds of Acheron lie the

remains of thousands of orcs and goblins, killed over and

over in ceaseless warfare. The war has long since moved on,

but the stinking piles of bodies linger. Six clockroaches move

slowly through the area, spraying acid on everything until

they reduce the corpses, broken weapons, and other refuse

down to clean earth. They see everything as trash in need

of disposal and attack any creature that comes into range.

An opponent that survives more than 1 round becomes the

focus of all six clockroaches, who all direct their acid against

the troublesome garbage.

ECOLOGY

Clockroaches are mindless constructs. They do not eat, sleep,

or breathe. They exist as tools, working only to the purposes

they have been set. They follow their programming from the

moment they are built to the day they fall apart.

Each clockroach is constructed with a command amulet.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A  clockroach  is  crafted  from  metal  plates

that protect  nely wrought gears and other

mechanical elements, with a total cost of

75 gp. Constructing the body requires

a  DC  14  Craft  (metalworking)

check.

A clockroach with more

than 1 Hit Die can be cre-

ated,  but  each  additional

Hit Die adds 2,000 gp

to the cost.

The  creation  cost

also  includes  the

materials  for  the

command amulet

attuned  to  that

clockroach.  The

amulet is part of

the  clockroach,

not  a  mechani-

cal  key.  It  is  not

possible to recreate a

destroyed  amulet,  nor

to somehow bypass the

amulets  function  and  pro-

the  clockroachs  carapace.  When   tted  with  its  amulet,  a

clockroach  can  be  given  a  simple  program.  Programmed

instructions  must  depend  only  on  sight  and  hearing  and

allow  no  cognitive  function;  they  can  be  no  longer  than

twenty- ve words.

Environment: Though clockroaches can be found any-

where, they were originally built by extraplanar generals to

clean up battlegrounds taken from eternal foes.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A clockroach is 4 feet

long and 1-1/2 feet wide. Eight spindly metal legs carry it

about 1 foot off the ground. Its feet are lined with tiny hooks,

allowing it to burrow into the ground or walk up a wall. Glass

eyes are randomly located on its body. It constantly produces

a slight whirring noise, like a wheel spinning very fast. Most

clockroaches are made of brass or bronze, but a few steel or

iron specimens have been encountered.

The carapace of a clockroach has a round indention in it,

which is ridged and inscribed with many small runes.

Alignment:  As  mindless  automatons,  clockroaches  are

always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Clockroaches  do  not  carry  or  store  treasure  of  any  kind.

However, a clockroach with its command amulet is worth

CLOCKROACHES IN EBERRON

Clockroaches  are  believed  to  have  been  developed  at  the

same time as warforged, possibly to serve as their assistants.

Many still exist in the Mournland, and some warforged keep

clockroaches as pets.

Some  arti cers  also  create  clockroaches  as  homun culi

(Magic of Eberron 151). A homunculus clockroach requires as

an additional ingredient a pint of the creators blood. It has

an Intelligence score of 10, the Weapon Finesse feat (raising

its melee attack bonus to +4), and a +4 bonus on Spot checks.

It does not have a command amulet.

CLOCKROACHES IN FAERN

Clockroaches  rst appeared in Lantan, products of Gonds

wondermakers.  Word  of  their  usefulness  spread  rapidly,

and they can now be found up and down the Sword Coast.

Most are purchased by wealthy merchants, but a few inad-

vertently migrated to the mainland in the holds of passing

vessels. Tales tell of explorers who released a massive horde

of clockroaches into the jungles of Chult, hoping to blaze a

roadway to a newly discovered ruin. The experiment failed,

and now the creatures rove the landscape devouring old trash

and priceless historical artifacts with equal zeal.

Swarm Sacrifice (Ex) A clockwork mender swarm can

choose not to damage a construct with its swarm

attack. When the swarm occupies a constructs space

at the end of the swarms turn, it can repair damage to

that construct, up to the swarms current hit points.

The swarm loses an equal number of hit points as its

members sacrifice themselves to become building

material to repair the construct. If the swarm sacrifice

reduces the clockwork mender swarms hit points to 0, it

breaks up.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Clockwork menders exist to repair damaged objects and con-

structs, but when agitated they attack any creature fearlessly.

Menders attack when disturbed in their repairing efforts or

when commanded to do so by their masters.

Clockwork menders spend most of their time on the wing

and use their speed and Dexterity to their advantage, swoop-

ing in for hit-and-run attacks with their stings. They target

nonconstructs   rst,  using  their  poison  to  weaken  those

opponents before moving to construct or undead creatures.

If damaged in combat, a clockwork mender uses its repairing

touch on itself.

Clockwork mender swarms are more dangerous. They sur-

round a target and batter it with their metallic wings while

injecting poison. A swarms ability to heal itself repeatedly

makes it especially deadly.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Clockwork menders exist in great numbers on the Clockwork

Nirvana of Mechanus, where they tend to the environment

and aid inevitables. They most often appear on the Material

Plane  in  the  company  of  wizards  and  others  intrigued  by

constructs.

Golem  Rampage  (EL  8):  A   esh  golem  went  berserk

almost immediately after its creation and killed its master.

It  smashed  its  way  free  of  the  dead  wizards  home  and

now stalks the streets, followed by two clockwork mender

swarms.  The  clockwork  menders  once  served  the  wizard,

but they were in another room when the golem attacked and

dont know of their masters passing. They now dutifully  it

about his creation as it wantonly attacks people in the city,

repairing it whenever it sustains damage.

ECOLOGY

On Mechanus, clockwork menders work to repair damaged

parts of the mechanized plane and heal its construct inhab-

itants, striving to maintain perfect order. Since they do not

originate on the Material Plane, they do not  t into its ecol-

ogy  in  any  way.  Once  brought  there,  clockwork  menders

rarely leave the presence of the person who summoned them,

usually remaining indoors.

menders, numbering roughly half

the  swarms  population.  The

mender  swarms   ercely  guard

this process from interruption.

As  yet,  clockwork  menders

have  not  reproduced  outside

Mechanus;  sages  speculate

that some peculiarity of the plane

grants them life and sentience.

Environment: Clockwork mend-

ers are native to the Clockwork Nirvana

of Mechanus but can be found in any environment. They

prefer dry and cool settingswet locales irritate them, and

extremely hot places such as deserts make them lethargic.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A clockwork mender

is close to a small cat in size. It has the same general shape as a

wasp, including a sharp stinger, but bears a vaguely humanoid

head devoid of distinct features. A clockwork mender has two

minute arms that can perform incredibly delicate repairs.

Alignment: As creatures of Mechanus, clockwork mend-

ers are always lawful neutral. They pursue their tasks with

single-minded ef ciency.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Clockwork menders never have treasure.

This creature is a clockwork mender, a construct

used by some wizards as a familiar. This result

reveals all construct traits.

Clockwork menders hail from the Clockwork

Nirvana of Mechanus. They spend their time

repairing broken objects and other constructs.

Theyre usually harmless unless threatened or

impeded in some way.

Clockwork menders have stings that inject poison.

They sometimes travel in swarms of hundreds.

FOR PLAYER

CHARACTERS

Clockwork menders might appeal

to PCs as familiars, homunculi,

or summoned monsters.

Clockwork Menders

as Familiars

A  clockwork  mender  can  be  sum-

moned as an improved familiar (DMG

200).  An  arcane  spellcaster  must  be

lawful-aligned,  be  at  least  5th  level,

and  take  the  Improved  Familiar

feat  to  acquire  a  clockwork  mender

familiar.

Summoning

Clockwork Menders

Spellcasters  can  summon  a

clockwork mender with summon

monster II or a higher-level summon mon-

ster  spell.  Treat  the  clockwork  mender  as

being on the 2nd-level list on the Summon

Monster table (PH 287).

A clockwork mender swarm can be summoned with the

following spell.

Su mmon Clockwork Mender Swarm

Conjuration (Summoning) [Lawful]

Le vel: Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

Effect: One swarm of clockwork menders

This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you

summon a single clockwork mender swarm. The swarm can

be directed to attack opponents, to use its swarm repair abil-

ity, and even to use its swarm sacri ce ability.

Arcane Focus: A broken metal gear.

CLOCKWORK MENDERS IN EBERRON

Clockwork menders in Eberron exist as creations of arti -

cers. They are relatively common sights wherever arti cers

congregate, and they often accompany warforged arti cers.

The  gnomes  of  Zilargo  make  extensive  use  of  clockwork

menders, and its considered a source of status for a workshop

to host as many as possible.

Arti cers can create a clockwork mender as a homunculus

following the rules presented in the Eberron Campaign Set-

ting. For expanded rules and advancement of homunculi, see

Magic of Eberron.

Construction

A clockwork mender is made of bronze, steel, silver, gold,

and a pint of the creators blood. The materials cost 400 gp.

Creating the body requires a DC 15 Craft (blacksmithing)

check.

A clockwork mender with more than 1 Hit Die can be cre-

ated, but each additional Hit Die adds 2,000 gp to the cost to

create.

also stops and stands still if its rider becomes unconscious,

A clockwork steed presents its owner with a perfectly tracta-

ble and battle-ready mount that never grows tired or requires

32

food. Clockwork stallions are built for Medium riders, while

ponies serve Small riders.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Clockwork steeds are utterly mindless and simply stand inert

unless  commanded  by  a  rider.  Commanding  a  clockwork

steed is a simple matter for anyone trained to ride an ordi-

nary mount. As a free action, a character with at least 1 rank

in Ride can direct the steed to perform a move action or an

attack action, or as a move action, command it to make a full

attack or perform a full-round action relating to movement

(such as a charge). A rider without any ranks in Ride must

instead use a move action or a standard action, respectively.

Commanded actions cannot be complicated tactical choices

such as tripping or overrunning or aiding anothers attack,

but clockwork steeds can be directed to charge and jump

like horses. No command words are needed.

Clockwork steeds serve at least as well as battle-trained

mounts in combat, despite their lack of intelligence.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

People use clockwork steeds just as they do horses. However,

most  clockwork  steeds  belong  to  wealthy  individuals  or

people powerful enough to steal from the wealthy. Thus, any

encounter with a clockwork steed likely involves an owner

who presents the real threat.

Repossession  (EL  7):  A  janni  made  a  bargain  with  a

wizard she saved from death in the desert, and she has come

to  collect.  The  wizard  refused  to  acknowledge  the  debt

to the janni, so she stole his clockwork stallion. Now she

and two compatriot jann seek to escape the city. Everyone

knows  the  wizard  owns  the  clockwork  stallion,  and  the

alarm goes up as soon as someone sees a stranger riding it.

The two jann on foot move invisibly and enlarged to block

anyone  attempting  to  reach  their  mounted  companion.

They bull rush opponents, and this action combined with

their sudden appearance should frighten off most people;

they attack with their scimitars if that doesnt work. The

mount has the Improved Overrun and Trample upgrades

(see below), which its janni rider uses against opponents

that get by her fellows.

ECOLOGY

As  clockwork  constructs,  clockwork  steeds  dont  contrib-

ute to the environment. Without a rider, a clockwork steed

simply stands, gathering dust and slowly rusting away.

A forgotten wizard created the  rst clockwork steeds for

a warlords forces in a long campaign, but when the warlord

learned how expensive the mounts were, he refused to pay.

The wizard ended up selling his creations (and the warlords

plans) to the nobility of the city-state the warlord was plan-

ning to attack. Since then, others have learned how to create

the mounts, and now they can be found in the service of

anyone with enough gold.

Environment: Clockwork steeds, being constructs, have

no natural environment. Like real horses, they fare best on

hard, open ground such as plains, hills, and deserts. Massed

cavalry gets bogged down in forests and marshes, but lone

outriders or scouts mounted on clockwork steeds might be

encountered even in such terrain.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A clockwork stallion

is  roughly  the  size  of  a  heavy  warhorse,  standing  nearly  6

feet at the shoulder. A clockwork pony is about the size of a

warpony, slightly under 5 feet tall at the shoulder. The steeds

metallic construction makes them signi cantly heavier than

their living equivalents: A clockwork stallion weighs upward

of 2,500 pounds, while a pony weighs around 2,000 pounds.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A clockwork steed is itself treasure, usually found as part of

an opponents possessions. Many adventurers would pay well

for a mount that never tires, never needs stabling, and needs

no time-consuming care. As well, the saddlebags of clock-

work steeds often hold items useful to their owners, such as

potions of cure light wounds and emergency rations.

Aligned Defenses (Su) A concordant killer can increase

its defenses against creatures of a specific alignment

component (good, evil, law, or chaos). Against attacks

made or effects created by creatures of the chosen

alignment, this ability grants the concordant killer a

+4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus

on saving throws. At will, as a standard action, the

concordant killer can change the alignment to which this

effect is attuned.

This ability also blocks spells of up to 3rd level cast

by creatures of the specified alignment, as a lesser globe of

invulnerability spell (CL 19th).(These defensive benefits

are not included in the creatures statistics.)

Know Alignment (Su) As the detect chaos, detect evil, detect

good, and detect law spells; continuous; caster level 19th.

A concordant killer can suppress or resume some or all of

this ability as a free action.

Possessing both celestial and demonic heritage, these power-

ful entities are dispassionate killers who frequently deliver

the wrath of the gods. Concordant killers seek always to per-

fect their killing abilities and, when not in the employ of a

higher power, hunt down those they deem worthy prey.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A  concordant  killer  prefers  to  study  its  opponent  before

entering  combat,  to  discern  the  creatures  alignment  and

appropriately prepare its defenses. If possible, it  rst casts

mage armor, shield, mind blank, and greater invisibility on itself,

in that order.

Once  combat  begins,  the  concordant  killer  starts  by

casting a quickened greater dispel magic against its target, or

against the greatest threat when facing multiple opponents.

It follows up with blasphemy, dictum, holy word, or word of

chaos, as appropriate for the opponents alignment, which

This creature is neither wholly fiendish nor celestial

but possessed of both natures. It has traits that

A concordant killer is surrounded by an ever-

changing defensive field that shifts to repel

creatures of any given alignment. Other abilities,

including its sword, are even more lethal to those

whose alignment strays from neutrality.

34  Many of a concordant killers spell-like abilities

manipulate force energy. The creature is also

resistant to all types of physical damage.

Concordant killers believe they were created to

maintain the cosmic balance. They have since

also helps it gauge the strength of its foes. It uses Power

Attack where appropriate against enemies with relatively

poor defenses. If it faces a large group of enemies, it breaks

the  group  into  manageable  numbers  with  one  or  more

uses of wall of force.

If the  ght becomes unmanageable, or if the concordant

killer is being overwhelmed, it uses greater teleport or plane

shift to escape combat altogether, then returns later when

it is fresh and ready to battle on its own terms.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

A concordant killer often works alone. More dangerous

assignments might require a group of four to  ve killers.

If the PCs encounter a concordant killer, they are either

linked somehow to its current target or are themselves

the targets.

Individual (EL 19): A lone concordant killer might serve

a deity to destroy one or more deserving transgressors.

EL  19:  The  PCs  have  run  afoul  of  the  servants  of  a

demigod, who has since contracted with a concordant

killer  named  Drexsalles  to  take  care  of  the  matter.

Drexsalles appears a short distance away, raising its +2

concordant greatsword in a grim salute before using greater

invisibility  to  disappear.  It  advances  invisibly  and  utters

the appropriate sonic evocation once the party is within

range.

ECOLOGY

Some  say  concordant  killers  were  an  experi-

ment  by  gods  of  neutrality,  who  sought  to

create the perfect stewards for maintaining the

cosmic  balance.  Others  hold  that  they  were  created  by

a  long-forgotten  demigod  to  serve  as  bodyguards.  They

failed in that endeavor, and their master was lost to a shad-

owy rival. Without direction, they settled into the role of

mercenaries.

Whatever the truth, as beings of neutrality, concordant

killers are concerned with the balance of all forces in the

planes. They understand that defeating a powerful foe might

tip the scales one way or another. Therefore they track their

kills as a group, endeavoring to distribute their prey evenly

among the alignments. They keep the location of such meet-

ings  secret,  though  many  sages  believe  they  congregate

near the central spire of the Outlands. Even deities magic

is impeded there, making it a perfect spot for clandestine

gatherings.

Concordant killers do not reproduce, so every one that falls

in battle forever reduces their number. Anyone who destroys

a concordant killer becomes the target of its irate kin.

Environment: Infused with both  endish and celestial

essence, concordant killers are beings of the Outer Planes but

are not native to any one. A killer might be found anywhere

its mission takes it.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A concordant killer

is between 10 and 11 feet in height and weighs from 900 to

1,200 pounds.

Alignment: A concordant killer is always neutral, seeking

balance in its life even as it serves and hunts those of more

extreme alignments.

Concordant killer

SOCIETY

Concordant  killers  exist  to  hunt  down  and  destroy  other

powerful  creatures.  Effective  yet  discreet,  they  are  highly

sought after by powerful entities such as demon lords, demi-

gods, and even deities to do their dirty work. A concordant

killer  is  dismissive  of  any  prospective  employer,  though,

unless offered substantial payment.

Concordant killers trade their services for favors, having

little need for material possessions. Sometimes they request

these favors at the time of hiring, but usually a contract for

future payment suf ces. Even gods are indebted to the con-

cordant killers and so might look the other way, leave a planar

portal open, provide information on a targets whereabouts,

or undertake other favors that help the killers achieve their

objectives.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Concordant killers have standard treasure for their Challenge

Rating, about 61,000 gp, but carry no coins (replace these

with gems of equal value). They care little for magic weapons

or armor, so they typically carry powerful wands, staffs, or

wondrous items.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A corrupture instinctively moves toward any moving object

or creature larger than Tiny size and attacks it, trampling

others in its rush to dissolve and taste  esh. Stubborn in its

mindless hunger, a corrupture doggedly continues attacking

the creature it  rst tastes. It uses its acid burst whenever its

prey and at least one other creature are within range, or if it

is blocked by a creature larger than it can trample. If a group

of foes  ee a corrupture, it follows only its prey, following the

nearest creature if it has not yet tasted  esh. Once its initial

prey dies, the corrupture attacks the largest  eshly creature

of which it is aware; if no others are nearby, the ooze begins

consuming its meal at leisure.

A  corrupture  ignores  creatures  it  cannot  taste  after  its

 rst attack, such as those not susceptible to its acid or those

lacking  eshat least until they move out of the range of

its blindsight. (The mindless ooze cannot recognize a new

moving  object  as  one  that  it  hit  before.)  Skeletal  undead,

many constructs, and creatures immune to acid can escape

harm simply by not attacking back after  rst being struck.

The oozes seem to instinctively recognize that other corrup-

tures arent prey.

Foul things! Corruptures come to punish us for our sins

against nature. What have you done to invoke natures

wrath?

corruptures  to  guard  its  lair,  keeping  them  in  a  huge  pit

that surrounds the submerged entrance. The dragon, being

immune  to  acid,  is  ignored  by  the  oozes  and  keeps  them

from wandering by bringing them meat whenever it enters

the cave. The oozes attack anything that comes within range

Corruptures are acid-spraying oozes that feed on

flesh. This result reveals all ooze traits.

Corruptures are equally at home on land or

underwater. They move relatively swiftly and can

climb and swim as well.

Corruptures come into being wherever the wilder-

ness has been horribly befouled or natural laws have

been repeatedly broken. They hunger endlessly for

flesh, which they dissolve with their acid.

of their blindsight. The dragon  ies over the battle and uses

its breath weapon on as many invaders as it can. It continues

to use this strategy for as long as the corruptures live and its

breath weapon seems to be harming foes. While it waits for

its breath weapon to recharge, it takes the opportunity to cast

shield and mage armor on itself. The Monster Manual presents

statistics for a young adult black dragon on page 72: Replace

the dragons Wingover feat with Flyby Attack and its protec-

tion from good spell with shield.

ECOLOGY

Corruptures come into being wherever the wilderness has

been horribly befouled or natural laws have been repeatedly

broken. In such places, nature reacts with a rent in existence

that births a corrupture before closing, an embodiment of

the cancerous damage to the world. Corruptures commonly

appear in wilderness areas that have been poisoned or dis-

eased,  or  that  are  heavily  in uenced  by  magic  or  another

plane.  Rarely  they  appear  in  civilized  areas.  Mundane

de lement, such as razing a forest or draining a swamp, isnt

enough to create a corrupture, but an arcane laboratory used

for magical experimentation on creatures might well do so.

A corrupture is a mindless hunter, driven by instinct to

hunt down the nearest prey of fair size. It draws food and

water directly through its skin,  rst dissolving  esh with its

acid and then moving over the gooey remains. Corruptures

are able to survive on plant matter for a short time but need

meat at least once a week. They can feed on carrion if neces-

sary, but they prefer fresh,  uid- lled prey.

Corruptures have no gender and do not mate: They just

get  bigger.  An  undamaged  corrupture  with  plenty  to  eat

molts its outer  esh as it grows. This process takes a month

of uninterrupted hibernation. After this time, the corrupture

has an even more voracious appetite for several weeks. Larger,

ancient corruptures begin to lose the ability to move under

their own power. Such massive sacks of  esh can

actually become stationary and starve.

Environment:  Corruptures  can

appear  in  any  sullied  environment,

even the sea.

skin  of  a  corrupture  is  covered  with  the  residue  of  these

eruptions, coating it in a caustic slime.

Alignment: Mindless feeding machines, corruptures are

always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A corrupture never carries treasure, but the equipment of the

oozes victims might be left behind if it can survive the oozes

acidic touch. A corrupture has only a 50% chance of having

goods or magic items, which must be metallic or stone, and

1/10 standard treasure in coins.

CORRUPTURES IN EBERRON

Corruptures  roll  out  of  the  dead-gray  mist  bordering  the

Mournland  to  attack  those  foolish  enough  to  approach.

Hundreds exist within that foggy fringe surrounding the

war-torn landscape, but corruptures can also be found wan-

dering in Thrane, Darguun, and the Talenta Plains. It was

long thought that the mists somehow made the creatures,

but recently adventurers returned from Xendrik with tales

of  corruptures  in  the  cyclopean  ruins.  What  connection

the Mournland might have with events on that mysterious

continent remains unknown.

CORRUPTURES IN FAERN

Corruptures roam many places in Faern, but they are most

common in sites tied to failing mythals and the Netherese

arcanists of old. Undermountain hosts its share of corrup-

tures, as do Myth Drannor and the Dire Wood in the High

Forest. Rumor holds that dozens of corruptures inhabit secret

places in the city of Shade, and that the shades who live with

them keep the oozes for some plot. Of course, no investiga-

tion has con rmed the rumor, and the shades laugh off such

a preposterous suggestion.

Typical  Physical  Characteris-

tics:  A  corrupture  is  a  large  mass

of semi uid  esh approximately 15

feet in diameter. It constantly undu-

lates  and  pulses,  making  its  exact

mass  dif cult  to  determine,  but

a  typical  example  weighs  about

6,000 pounds. Corruptures  esh

varies in color from tan to pink

to angry red, and is covered in

a  web  of  veins,  bruises,  and

sores. Boils of thick, yellow

acid swell up on its surface

every  few  seconds,  burst-

ing to spray the area. The

DEFACER

The screaming and wailing youve been hearing for some time

seems to be coming from the stone beneath your feet. Suddenly

a gray shape looms up from the ground. Its muscular form looks

solid and strong, but its featureless head is surrounded by many

ghostly faces. As it swings a heavy fist at you, one of the faces

rushes up its arm.

Advancement 

Frightful Keening (Su) The faces that whirl about the head of

a defacer constantly wail and scream. This noise can be

heard through earth and stone as easily as it can through

air. A defacer cannot stop this keening. Any creature that

can hear the sound and that is within 60 feet of a defacer

is automatically shaken. This is a sonic, mind-affecting

fear effect.

Earth Glide (Ex) A defacer glides through stone, dirt, and

any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish

swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no

tunnel or hole, nor does it create a ripple or any other

signs of its presence (although its frightful keening can

still be heard).

Stunning Possession (Su) A creature with an Intelligence of

3 or higher that is struck by a defacers slam attack must

succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be stunned for 1 round.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

While stunned, the creatures face takes on the

shape of one of the defacers victims and screams for

help and release using the languages that soul knew in

life. When the effect ends, the ghostly face returns to

the defacer.

Steal Face (Su) If a defacers slam attack kills a creature with

an Intelligence of 3 or higher, or if the defacer touches

the body of such a creature within 1 day of its death,

the defacer steals its face as an immediate action. This

physically erases the facial features of the body, including

bone structure, mouth, and teeth, leaving a smooth

and blank surface. Attempts to cast speak with dead on

victims of this attack always fail.

This defilement of the corpse also draws the soul of

the creature to the defacer, and it becomes one of the

keening faces that whirl about the defacers head. This

prevents the soul from reaching the afterlife, becoming

undead, or being raised or resurrected. Nothing short of

destroying the defacer restores a corpses face and frees

the soul.

For 1 day after stealing a face, the defacers blank

visage takes the shape of that creatures face in the same

manner as a creature affected by its stunning possession.

This effect ends if the defacer uses its earth glide ability,

which it is loath to do unless it thinks it can take another

creatures face that day.

If a defacer stole a creatures face by killing it and is

destroyed within 24 hours of that act, its victim returns to

life (stable at 0 hit points) if its body is largely whole. Its

face is restored. This return to life does not result in level

loss or ability drain.

A defacer arises when a spellcaster creates an undead being

from  the  corpse  of  a  doppelganger  or  other  creature  that

assumes others visages. Tortured by its inability to mimic

others,  a  defacer  steals  the  faces  of  those  it  kills  and  of

the  recently  dead,  trapping  their  souls  by  de ling  their

corpses.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A defacer typically attacks from beneath the earths surface,

using Spring Attack to glide up toward a foe, strike it, and

then  disappear  underground.  When  it  stuns  a  creature,  a

defacer moves up to make a full attack, hoping to keep the

creature stunned and kill it to steal its face. Once it steals a

face, a defacer typically  ees aboveground so that it can keep

the captured souls visage for a whole day.

Evil  spellcasters  use  defacers  as  guardians,  exploiting

their frightful keening to create ambianceone that also

serves as an alarm system of sorts. Movement of the keening

indicates that the defacers are attacking, allowing the spell-

caster  to  take  appropriate  measures.  When  traveling  with

their creations, such spellcasters usually cast a silence spell

on defacers to suppress their keening if they desire stealth

or are not immune to fear.

I created a defacer once. It was a grave error.

Black Orthal, human necromancer

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

A defacer typically accompanies the spellcaster who created

it, along with other undead minions.

A  defacer  without  a  controller  might  be  encountered

alone or in the company of incorporeal undead attracted by

its frightful keening. Although the defacer does not com-

municate with the other undead, it doesnt concern itself if

they follow it and aid its attacks against the living.

Bodyguards  (EL  14):  An  11th-level  wizard  lich  (MM

166) uses two defacers and two bodaks as bodyguards. The

defacers  attack  foes  to  stun  them  and  prevent  them  from

approaching the lich while the bodaks simply stand guard,

allowing their death gazes to do their work. The lich casts

spells from behind the bodaks.

ECOLOGY

As undead beings that prey only on intelligent life, defacers

do not contribute to the ecology of an area. Even so, they

have an effect on the region. A defacer seeks to take a face at

least once a week, adding the unfortunate victim to its host

of captured souls. Although only half a dozen or so of these

spirits appear on a defacers head at any given time, no limit

seems to exist on the number of faces one can steal, and it is

always hungry for more.

Defacers have no society and do not communicate. They

lack the ability to speak and dont seem to understand any

language, although they still obey the instructions of those

who can command them.

DEFACER LORE

This creature is a defacer, an undead creature that

steals faces from corpses. This result reveals all

A defacers attacks can stun creatures and cause

them to be momentarily possessed by one of the

silvered weapons.

A defacer that steals a face doesnt like to move

through the earth for a day afterward unless it

plans on stealing another face very soon.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Environment: Defacers can exist in any environment

but  typically  accompany  the  spellcasters  who  created

them. Some roam free, whether created by mistake,

released on purpose, or abandoned after the death

of  a  controller.  These  defacers  seek  out  civilized

areas  and  gravitate  toward  burial  grounds.  A

defacer  might  leave  a  community  alone,  prefer-

ring to visit a nearby graveyard to steal the face of

someone recently buried and spend a day in that

individuals cof n before leaving. The screaming

of  the  trapped  souls  gives  the  graveyard  a  dire

reputation.

Typical Physical Characteristics: The body of

a creature turned into a defacer loses the charac-

teristics it had in life and gains the typical defacer

shape and appearance. Faceless and gray, a defacers

thick-skinned and muscular body stands roughly 6

feet tall and weighs nearly 260 pounds.

Alignment: Defacers are always neutral evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Defacers do not carry treasure and cannot carry

objects with them as they glide through the earth.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A  spellcaster  of  14th  or  higher  level  can  create  a

defacer  by  casting  create  undead  on  the  corpse  of

a  creature  that  mimics  other  creatures,  such  as  a  doppel-

ganger.

DEFACERS IN EBERRON

Intrigued by defacers ability to keep souls from returning

to life and to prevent bodies from revealing secrets, agents

of Karrnath tried to use the creatures as assassins during the

Last War. They met with some success, but the program was

halted after high-ranking members of the Karrnathi army

were found faceless. The head of the program, a human nec-

romancer named Clavius Kreel, disappeared at that time and

hasnt been seen since.

Changelings  turned  into  undead  sometimes  spontane-

ously rise as defacers instead of what their creators intended.

When  Dolurrh  is  coterminous,  dead  changelings  become

defacers under circumstances when they might otherwise

become ghosts.

DEFACERS IN FAERN

Rumors  from  Skullport  insist  that  a  sorcerer  lich  hailing

from  Chessenta  recently  arrived  in  the  underground  city

with several defacers as bodyguards. The lich apparently went

into Undermountain to set up a base of operations. With the

spells and magic items at its disposal, and the ability to take

others shapes, the lich presents a serious threat to the Lords

of  Waterdeep.  The  recent  appearance  of  a  faceless  corpse

near the City of the Dead con rms the Lords suspicions,

and now they quietly seek powerful adventurers willing to

take on the dif cult task of locating and destroying the lich

and its guards.

DEMON

Evil and chaotic to the core, demons like nothing more than

to maim and destroy. They are native to the In nite Layers

of  the  Abyss,  and  their  environment  complements  their

natures. Demons take pleasure in the pain and misfortune

of others. Some are sneaky and sly, while others are more

direct and brutal.

A number of demons belong to a race (and subtype) known

as the tanarri. The tanarri form the largest and most diverse

group  of  demons,  and  they  are  the  unchallenged  masters

of the Abyss (at least in their own eyes). Tanarri possess a

number of racial traits, summarized in the glossary.

Except  where  otherwise  noted,  demons  speak  Abyssal,

Celestial, and Draconic.

DEATHDRINKER

This massive creature is the size of a giant, and it sports chipped,

antlerlike horns from which hang desiccated bodies and skulls.

The creature wears intricate armor, and dark, pitted plates cover

legs that end in hooves. Its many-fingered hand holds a broad

longsword.

Undead are instead healed of a like amount of damage.

Glory in Slaughter (Ex) A deathdrinker gains a +5 morale

at least 10 HD).

Deathdrink (Su) If a deathdrinker deals enough damage to

a creature to kill it, with either its death aura or a melee

attack, it instantly heals 1d8 points of damage per HD of

the creature it killed.

A  deathdrinker  collects  souls  from  those  hapless  enough

to  cross  its  path.  Creatures  of  brute  force  and  gory  battle,

they seek out combat with sadistic glee, spreading fear even

among other demons.

Strategies and Tactics

A deathdrinker is very mobile on the battle eld, using quick-

ened greater teleport to reach spellcasters or archers who hang

back from melee. The demon has air walk active at all times,

allowing it to teleport next to  ying creatures. It enjoys the

fear and panic that ensues when it uses quickened  greater

teleport to move next to a  ying spellcaster before unleash-

ing a barrage of powerful melee attacks. It does not hesitate

to use quickened greater dispel magic to soften up foes before

engaging in melee. It generally employs Power Attack unless

an enemy is dif cult to hit.

A deathdrinker uses its allies to great personal advantage,

since it is often accompanied by undead that bask in its aura

of unlife. A wounded deathdrinker does not hesitate to kill

one of its injured or minor minions to heal itself and then

use Cleave to attack an enemy within reach.

Sample Encounters

Typical Treasure

A  deathdrinker  makes  a  formidable  opponent.  It  is  often

accompanied  by  lower-CR  undead  or  demons.  Although

these  additional  creatures  rarely  add  signi cant  threat  to

the encounter in themselves, a deathdrinkers willingness

to sacri ce its minions to bolster itself usually increases the

expected Encounter Level.

Dread  Company  (EL  18+):  A  deathdrinker  is  usually

accompanied by undead, frequently by other deathdrinkers,

and occasionally by other demons of various kinds.

EL 18: Barrow-walker is a deathdrinker with ambition. It

keeps a troupe of undead as allies (and fodder if it needs to

heal  itself  reliably  in  combat).  Its  minions  include  two

dread wraiths (MM 258) and an elite vampire (MM 251).

Ecology

Deathdrinkers reproduce by

dripping some of their blood into

specially prepared pits of vile essence.

The blood mingles with the muck, then clots

and grows. Lesser demons tend to a breeding

pit, regularly stirring its contents and

adding  fresh  corpses  and  blood.

Eventually a fully formed death-

drinker emerges.

As outsiders, deathdrinkers

do  not  need  to  eat,  sleep,  or

breathe.  However,  they  enjoy

creating and personalizing lairs,

decorated  with  skulls  and  other

symbols of death, where they lounge

on large piles of corpses or bones.

Environment:  Deathdrinkers  live  in  the  In nite

Layers of the Abyss. They prefer to make their lairs near re-

cent battles, enjoying the bounty of corpses.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A deathdrinker stands

approximately 18 feet tall and weighs about 3,000 pounds,

most of it muscle. It has broad shoulders, bulging biceps, and

a  at, muscular chest.

Alignment: Deathdrinkers are always chaotic evil. They

are self-serving, egocentric creatures that happily kill their

allies  if  doing  so  suits  themor  if  they  simply  feel  like

seeing some blood.

Society

Deathdrinkers live in the Abyss but are not tanarri. They

use  this  distinction  to  set  themselves  apart  from  political

intrigue and power struggles, viewing themselves as above

such petty concerns. Theyre tough and powerful combat-

ants, but they are not evil masterminds or clever generals.

Deathdrinkers have only one overriding interest: them-

selves. They are extraordinarily egocentric. They see their

race as superior to all others, and each considers itself the

ultimate representative of the race. When they come together

in social situations, they prefer to associate with other death-

drinkers, but they also enjoy the company of creatures that

praise, admire, and  atter them (although they might not

publicly admit as much). Crafty, powerful individuals some-

times acquire the services of a deathdrinker by sending it

many gifts and fawning emissaries.

A  deathdrinker  has  treasure  appropriate  to  its  Challenge

Rating, about 36,000 gp. Most of its treasure is in the form of

its magic weapon and armor. If given access to other magic,

it favors items that make it a more effective killer, such as

better armor or items that overcome damage reduction. The

remaining treasure it typically carries in the form of jewelry,

usually featuring grisly motifs such as skulls, faces distorted

in anguish, or torture implements.

Deathdrinkers with Class Levels

A deathdrinker usually lacks the ambition to pursue

a class. For one that does, its favored class is cleric, usually

of a neutral evil or chaotic evil god of death. Many choose

not to worship a god (believing that no one is more worthy

of  worship  than  themselves)  and  instead  simply  choose

domains. The most popular are Death, Destruction, and Evil.

A deathdrinker cleric most enjoys creating undead that it can

use to bolster its talents.

A  deathdrinker  automatically  quali es  for  the  assassin

prestige class (DMG 180).

Deathdrinkers in Eberron

Deathdrinkers  inhabit  Dolurrh,  the  Realm  of  the  Dead,

acting  as  lords  of  the  place.  Deathdrinkers  in  Eberron

are  even  more  ambitious,  active,  and  power-hungry  than

described above. Undead  ock to the sides of deathdrinkers

to enjoy the bene t of their aura of unlife.

Deathdrinkers in Faern

Deathdrinkers often lead demonic raiding parties that seek

to  steal  souls  from  the  Fugue  Plane.  Their  aura  of  unlife

attracts dead souls, so these excursions typically result in

large harvests.

creature must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or be

stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.

Cruel and sadistic, the brutish kastighurs act as hunters and

prison wardens among the tanarri. In combat, they teleport

about the battle eld and use stunning charges to incapacitate

and terrify foes.

Strategies and Tactics

A kastighur loves melee combat and takes to battle with great

relish. It charges foes as often as possible, trying to stun them

and leave them shaken as it lands lethal blows.

A  kastighur  typically  begins  combat  by  charging  a  foe,

stopping at the limit of its reach (15 feet). If it stuns its target,

it charges again on the following round, closing the remain-

ing distance to stand adjacent to its enemy. It then begins to

make full attacks with its gore and slams, dealing horri c

damage with Power Attack.

A kastighur can teleport at will, and three times per day

it can use its Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat to teleport as a

swift action. In combat, a kastighur often uses a quickened

teleport to move 10 feet or more away from a particular foe

and then charge it. A kastighur might also use this ability to

attack a  ying creature by teleporting above the enemy in

the hopes of grappling it and bearing it to the ground.

Kastighurs use teleportation tactics with some trepidation

because they do not possess the greater teleport ability enjoyed

by  many   ends  and  generally  dont  have  time  to  become

familiar  with  most  battle elds.  They  are  loath  to  teleport

great distances and keep even battle eld teleports as short

as possible.

Sample Encounter

Since a kastighur doesnt possess a reliable means of trans-

porting itself from one plane to the next, it typically depends

upon more powerful demons or even magic items to provide

the means to travel in this manner. A kastighur also enjoys

the  pain  and  suffering  that  it  can  in ict  on  the  Material

Plane when called by a powerful evil spellcaster using gate

or greater planar ally.

An encounter with a kastighur should emphasize its charge

tactics and how much it enjoys terrifying other creatures.

Kastighurs might pair up with other creatures that cause fear

(such as evil dragons) or that can provide ranged support.

Flying allies make a particularly potent  combination.

This horrible creature is clearly a demon of some

kind. This result reveals all outsider traits.

A kastighur is a kind of tanarri and shares many of

that races traits, but it is also immune to acid. It is

difficult to hurt, and it is resistant to most magic.

These demons work as jailers and hunters in the

Abyss. A kastighur loves to charge enemies and

gore them with its horns. A physical blow from a

kastighur can terrify those struck by it.

Unlike many tanarri, a kastighur teleports with

some risk and might end up elsewhere than its

intended destination. Occasionally it can teleport

as quick as a blink, appearing and attacking before

anyone can react.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Alignment:  A  kastighur  is  always  chaotic  evil

capricious, depraved, and  endish. Its greatest delight is

in breaking the will of other creatures, either through

physical torture or the relentless hunt.

Society

Not  terribly  bright  by  nature,  kastighurs  typically

serve  more  intelligent  and  powerful  demons.  They

work as hunters and jailers among the tanarri, roles

in  which  they  take  great  pleasure.  When  a  tanarri

needs to  nd a creature but lacks the power to create

a retriever, it calls upon a kastighur or two to hunt the

individual down.

A kastighurs appetite for fear and the hunt some-

times gets the better of ita fact that can frustrate its

master.  A  kastighur  sometimes  intentionally  allows

one of its prisoners to escape, just so it can hunt down

the  eeing creature. On a battle eld, a unit of kasti-

ghurs often breaks ranks to chase enemies who seem

frightened.

Left to its own devices, a kastighur roams the

Abyss  hunting  and  killing  whatever  suits  its

fancy,  whether  a  damned  soul  or  even  another

kastighur. It sees others of its kind as competition

for the attention of the great generals and demon

lords  who  can  take  it  to  hunting  grounds  on  other

planes. Thus, kastighurs despise one another unless

they serve the same master. Even then, they view their

service as a competition, and each always attempts to

outdo the other in feats of combat. A kastighur that

has  managed  to  survive,  and  thrive,  for  a  long  time

might grow to Gargantuan size. Such a  end looks for

opportunities to enslave and torture creatures of great

power, including dragons, powerful mortals, and other

potent outsiders.

Typical Treasure

A kastighur typically possesses half the standard treasure for

a creature of its Challenge Rating, usually in the form of the

magic breastplate bolted to its body. A kastighur travels light,

and any treasure it  nds usually goes to its masters.

These creatures might also seek magic items that grant

movement beyond their normal capabilities. Items that allow

them to  y, burrow, and climb are all good, but kastighurs

prize items that confer plane shift above all others.

Kastighurs in Eberron

Kastighurs  inhabit  Mabar,  the  Endless  Night.  Here  they

maintain prisons and torture creatures in the eternal dark-

ness of the plane. They travel to the Material Plane when the

opportunity presents itself, where they hunt in the deepest

reaches of Khyber.

Kastighur

Fox Hunt (EL 16): Two kastighurs riding  endish rocs

and led by a  ying pack of six half- end digesters tracked

an  escaped  hound  archon  prisoner  through  a  gate  to  the

Material  Plane.  Now  they  seek  the  celestial  but  gleefully

attack any other creatures in their path. The kastighurs use

teleport or feather fall to land when they spot foes so they can

set up stunning charges. The half- end digesters use spell-

like abilities and acid sprays to harry aerial and landbound

foes without regard to the kastighurs. The rocs make  yby

attacks against  ying enemies and snatch up those without

the ability to  y.

Ecology

Although  kastighurs  dont  eat  or  drink  in  the  traditional

sense, they do feed off the fear, panic, and hopelessness of

those they imprison or track down. They delight in the hunt

and physical torture, and prolong both over great lengths of

time to savor the rich emotions.

Environment: Kastighurs live in the In nite Layers of

Kastighurs in Faern

the Abyss.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Kastighurs stand any-

where from 15 feet to 20 feet tall, and can weigh as much as

10,000 pounds. The horns on their massive heads grow slowly

but constantly, and the demons enjoy  ling them or carving

them with symbols or words.

Kastighurs make their home on the Barrens of Doom and

Despair,  where  they  compete  for  service  under  Loviatar

and Talona. They are frequently summoned to Toril to serve

powerful spellcasters, such as Larloch, Manshoon, and Fzoul

Chembryl.

Vulnerability to Criticals (Ex) A nashrou has a unique

weakness that can allow a clever or lucky opponent to

slay it in a single blow. A successful critical hit instantly

reduces the creature to 10 hit points; no saving throw

or damage reduction applies. The attack must deal

sufficient damage to overcome the nashrous damage

reduction.

Nashrous are vicious, animalistic predators that roam the

blasted volcanic plains of the Abyss. Reaving claws extend

in four directions from a nashrous central body, and many

legs propel it rapidly across the ground. Nashrous are swift,

tireless hunters that have been known to pursue prey for days

or even weeks. Occasionally, their tenacity is such that they

will follow prey through a portal to another plane.

Strategies and Tactics

A  nashrou  is  a   erce   ghter  that  presents  a  signi cant

challenge to even seasoned planar travelers. When  ghting in

a pack, the demons charge headlong into the thickest groups

of enemies, seeking to disrupt formations and deal as much

damage as possible with their goring arms and scythelike

secondary claws.

A  solitary  nashrou   ghts  more  cautiously,  preferring  to

stalk in the shadows until it can catch its prey at a vulner-

able moment. A lone nashrou rarely if ever attacks a group of

more than two creatures, and it often  ees if outnumbered

in a confrontation.

We were coming across the  rst layer of the Abyss

then ten, then a hundred. Mali and Skrit went down

unwitting planar traveler

Sample Encounter

A nashrou is usually encountered in the Abyss, but it might

pursue  prey  through  planar  portals  and  end  up  far  from

home.

Individual (EL 2): A lone nashrou is usually the sole sur-

vivor of a decimated pack.

EL 2: In the desert village of Ahlmad, the people whisper

of the poisoned taker from the desert. A nashrou pursued

a planar traveler through a gate and ended up alone on the

Material Plane.

Pack (EL 58): Roving packs of three to ten nashrous are

natural hazards of the Abyss.

EL 5: This group of  ve nashrous stalks the Plain of In nite

Portals, hunting wayward travelers.

Ecology

Like  most  creatures  of  the  Abyss,  nashrous  have  no  true

ecology as the sages of the Material Plane understand the

concept.  They  exist  only  for  the  pleasure  of  rending  and

devouring any other creature that crosses their path. Some

scholars  hypothesize  that  they  are  Abyssal  perversions  of

natural predators such as wolves or lions.

Environment: Nashrous dwell in the In nite Layers of

the  Abyss.  They  are  most  commonly  encountered  on  the

Plain of In nite Portals, the  rst layer of the Abyss, which

appears  to  be  their  native  habitat.  Through  their  use  as

hunting hounds by many Abyssal lords and other powerful

demons, however, they might be encountered on any layer.

They  are  sometimes  found  on  the  Material  Plane,  having

inadvertently passed through a portal or been summoned

to serve a powerful spellcaster. Packs of nashrous rove the

Abyss,  while  solitary  demons  are  more  common  on  the

Material Plane.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  nashrou  stands

approximately 10 feet tall, with four long, thin legs excel-

lently adapted to running or jumping. Its six  ghting limbs

are designed to counter a wide variety of threats, although

the  demon  can  use  only  four  limbs  at  a  time  while   ght-

ing. The massive goring arms impale dangerous foes while

the lighter, faster claws allow the creature to deal with

other  threats.  An  average  nashrou  weighs  about

800  pounds.  Nashrous  do  not  grow  larger  by

any natural process but seem to grow more

powerful  with  every  creature  they  shred

and devour.

Alignment: Nashrous have only

a  rudimentary  intellect  at

best,  but  they  are  sadistic

and twisted creatures of the

Lower  Planes  through

and through. They are

always chaotic evil.

Society

Nashrous  are  no

more  intelligent

than  animals,  but

within  the  pack

structure a society

exists after a fashion.

A  strict  hierarchy

of importance and

privilege  exists

within a nashrou

pack,  which  de-

termines  when

and  how  much  an

individual  is  permit-

ted  to  feed  (nashrous

do  not  require  food,  of

course, but they take a sav-

age joy in devouring the  esh

and blood of other  creatures).

The  smallest,  weakest  members  of  the  pack  are  driven

ahead of the main body to scout for potential prey. These

scouts either grow strong and tough enough to claim a place

within the main body of a pack, or they die in short order.

The larger, swifter nashrous harry the packs chosen prey,

sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. Students of the

creatures have dubbed these pack members stalkers.

Once the stalkers have worked the prey into a frenzy of

fear, the highest rank moves in. Called slayers, these largest,

strongest members of the pack are even more bloodthirsty

and savage than their packmates.

Typical Treasure

While corpses left in their wake might retain some former

possessions, nashrous do not collect treasure. They have a

tendency  to  devour  their  prey  where  it  falls,  so  valuables

seldom accrue at a communal lair.

For Player Characters

A nashrou can be summoned with summon monster III or

a  higher-level  summon  monster  spell.  Treat  the  nashrou

as  being  on  the  3rd-level  list  on  the

Summon  Monster  table  (PH  287).

Although lesser planar ally could call

one  or  more  nashrous,  the  vicious

creatures  are  so  intractable  that  they

are  nearly  impossible  to  bargain

with. Short periods of compelled

service are preferable.

Malar the Beastlord or Garagos the Reaver, god of destruction

and war, though they do not share either deitys home plane.

Possibly a bloodreaver (a zealous cleric of Garagos) unleashed

the horrors within the Abyss, perhaps to test them against

the destructive beings that live there or to toughen them fur-

ther. The beasts took to the chaotic plane and rapidly spread

Maddening Whispers (Su) Any living creature within 60 feet of

a whisper demon hears its maddening telepathic whispers

and must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or become

confused for 1 round. When rolling d% to determine the

actions of a creature confused by maddening whispers,

on a roll of 51 or higher, instead of the normal confusion

result, the creature automatically deals damage to itself

equal to its normal melee damage with the weapon it

currently wields or its primary natural weapon, whichever

deals more damage. A creature that succeeds on the Will

save cannot be affected by the same whisper demons

maddening whispers for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting

compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This ability does not allow a whisper demon to

exercise mental control over a creature, and thus the

protection from evil spell does not provide immunity to

this effect. Demons are immune to a whisper demons

maddening whispers.

Create Spawn (Su) A living creature that kills itself within

60 feet of a whisper demon rises as an allip under the

whisper demons control 1 round later. A whisper demon

can control up to nine allips it creates. Allips created by a

whisper demon in excess of this limit arise free-willed.

Madness (Ex) Whisper demons use their Charisma modifier

on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and

they have immunity to confusion and insanity effects.

In addition, anyone targeting a whisper demon with a

thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability

makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4

points of Wisdom damage.

ability,  the  whisper  demon  orders  the  allips  to  drain  the

creatures Wisdom scores, reducing their ability to withstand

its maddening whispers. The demon then attacks with its

incorporeal touches, hoping that a confused foe will  nish

itself off with a  nal lethal blow.

In any encounter, a whisper demon seeks to drive others to

madness and self-destruction. Whisper demons are usually

accompanied by allips, but other undead might also associ-

ate with one of these insane demons. An undead creatures

ally  avoid  whisper  demons,  but  might  risk  association  to

Ecology

Whisper  demons  are  strange

creatures. Although native to

the  Abyss,  they  prefer  to  vis-

it  other  planes  and  ply  their

powers upon susceptible foes.

They can be found anywhere

in the multiverse.

Environment:  Whisper

demons  inhabit  the  In nite

Layers of the Abyss but leave

whenever  they  can  to   nd

more sane minds on which

to prey.

Typical  Physical

Characteristics:  Whis-

per demons are roughly

the  size  and  shape  of

humans, but as incor-

poreal  creatures  they

possess no weight. Their

skin is a mottled green.

If  one  is  wounded,  the

area of the injury turns a brighter green and appears to ooze

a green, bloodlike substance, though this blood is also in-

corporeal. The  demons brows and chins jut forward, making

their wild eyes look very deeply set. A whisper demons sneer-

ing, cunning expression displays its delight in evil.

Alignment:  Whisper  demons  are  always  chaotic  evil.

Mad and hateful, they live for the opportunity to see others

misfortune.

Society

Whisper  demons  exist  to  drive  others  to  take  their  own

lives. They  nd nothing so exquisite as a creature losing all

hope or its grip on sanity. Gleefully

insane, whisper demons possess

no  sense  of  community  or  fair

play. They rarely talk, but when

they do, a  ood of hateful de-

sires  issues  forth  in  every

language they can speak.

Whisper  demons  exist

outside  the  power  structures

and  society  of  the  Abyss.  They

represent  a  formidable  threat

to other  ends. Although their

maddening whispers do not

harm  demons,  contacting

them  with  telepathy  does

damage a demons Wisdom,

while  their  incorporeal

touch  ignores  damage  re-

duction. In addition, the

allips  that  often  accom-

pany  them  can  harm

other  denizens  of  the

Abyss.  Thus,  only  more

powerful demons equipped

with  magic  weapons  risk

dealing  with  whisper  de-

mons.  All  others  ignore

them  if  possible  and   ee

otherwise.  If  a  creature

does  decide  it  wants  to

use  a  whisper  demon,  it

usually  offers  transporta-

tion to the Material Plane

in exchange for the  ends

service.

Typical Treasure

Whisper  demons  dont  nor-

mally have treasure, but one might

carry  about  a  ghost  touch  item,

such as a shield, simply for the sensation of

manipulating a material object.

Whisper Demons in Eberron

Whisper demons come from Xoriat, the Realm

DEMONHIVE

First seen on one of the In nite Layers of the Abyss, demon-

hives are now found throughout the Lower Planes. With

their  aggressive  and  bloodthirsty  members,  demonhives

threaten all creatures they encounter and lay waste to the

areas they inhabit. If they were allowed to continue their

rampage  unchecked,  demonhives  might  spread  across

entire planes.

DEMONHIVE ATTENDANT

A  chitinous  and  horned  insectoid  creature  approximately  the

size of a dog flaps toward you on translucent red wings. It grins

to reveal a mouth of wolfish teeth and reaches toward you with

disturbingly humanoid, clawed hands.

Strategies and Tactics

As the hives providers, demonhive attendants kill creatures

and bring their carcasses back for the queen and demonet

swarms  to  feed  on.  They  attack  any  creature  that  enters

their hive and any creature larger than Fine size that they

encounter while foraging. In combat, attendants prefer to

overwhelm a single foe before moving to the next, unless

enemies threaten the queen. In such cases, they divide their

efforts between blocking approach to the queen and attack-

ing those who come near.

Frenzied Haste (Ex) Whenever a demonhive queen takes

damage, all the hives attendants shudder with nervous

energy. When the queen is reduced to 1 hit points

or below, attendants enter a state of frenzied haste.

Each attendant gains a +2 haste bonus on attack rolls

and damage rolls, and one additional claw attack at

its highest attack bonus (3 claws +6 each [1d4+2]

and bite +4 [1d4+2]). This frenzied haste lasts for the

remainder of the encounter, after which the attendant is

fatigued for 10 minutes.

Hive Mind (Ex) All demonhive members within 2 miles of

a demonhive queen are in constant communication. If

one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one

in an encounter is not flat-footed, none of them are.

No demonhive member in an encounter is considered

flanked unless all of them are.

Demonhive attendants are the workers and hunters of the

hive. They attack nearly any creature they encounter, and

they kill regardless of hunger or the colonys needs.

Strategies and Tactics

A demonet swarm follows the lead of demonhive attendants

and the demonhive queen. When attendants or queens seem

agitated or enter combat, the demonet swarms do likewise.

They  do  not  use  sophisticated  tactics  but  simply  swarm

around  whatever  the  queen  or  attendants  are   ghting.  A

demonet swarm does not attack other demonets.

Demonhives are colonies of evil insectlike

outsiders. This result reveals all outsider traits.

Three kinds of creatures form a demonhive:

demonets that gather in swarms, male attendants

that hunt for the hive, and the hives queen.

Attendants are the worker bees of the hive and

go into a frenzy if their queen is severely wounded

or killed. The demonet swarms make a hideous

droning noise that makes fighting them difficult.

The queen is very protective of her demonets and

emits a devastating scream if they are killed. The

hive members are immune to this and other sonic

effects.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

The queen remains at the center of the hive, barely able to

move.  She  relies  on  her  attendants  to  defend  herself  and

the precious demonet swarms. If the swarms die, the queen

begins to scream. If the queen is injured or killed, the atten-

dants enter a frenzied haste.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

A demonhive presents interesting encounters that can form

the  backbone  of  a  short  adventure.  All  the  members  of  a

demonhive should be encountered together as much as pos-

sible, since they rarely stray far from the queen. The abilities

of the queen, attendants, and swarms also complement each

other. As a result, the dif culty of a demonhive encounter is

in large part determined by the tactical choices made by the

PCs. From the characters perspective, an optimal approach

is to defeat the attendants  rst, then the queen, and  nally

the demonet swarms. In this way, the surviving monsters do

not bene t from the others special abilities.

The PCs might encounter demonhive attendants on the

hunt, either alone or in small groups, then clash with more

attendants and demonet swarms at the entrance to the hive.

Demonhive queens always have a few swarms and attendants

nearby, and are normally found in the birthing chamber of

the hive. In some circumstances, a party might encounter a

queen accompanied by attendant bodyguards and demonet

swarms as the hive moves from an uninhabitable lair to  nd

a new one.

Hunting Wing (EL 6): Four demonhive attendants  y

through  the  woods  harrying  a  small  herd  of  deer.  When

the creatures spot the PCs, they veer off to attack. If the PCs

remain in the area after the battle, a new hunting wing soon

shows up, alerted to the combat through the attendants hive

mind ability.

Entrance Guardians (EL 7): Two demonet swarms  it

about the entrance to a demonhive, eager for the return of a

hunting wing with prey. Two attendants stand guard at the

entrance, and two others have almost reached the hive along

with freshly caught preya dying hal ing.

Queen  and  Company  (EL  9):  The  queen  lies  in  the

hives birthing chamber, guarded by  ve attendants and in

the company of three demonet swarms. When the queen or

attendants notice a threat, the demonet swarms  y about the

enemy while the attendants move to attack those who engage

the queen.

much as 2,000 pounds, but a well-fed and long-lived queen

can grow to Huge size.

Alignment: Demonhives infest any region with a food

supply; they dont care about laws or borders. However, their

demonic origins make them ruthless predators, and the crea-

tures seem to enjoy the screams of their prey being ripped to

pieces. Thus, demonhives are always neutral evil.

DEMONHIVES IN EBERRON

The  rst demonhive appeared in Eberron only  ve years ago

in southern Zilargo. It was attacked and destroyed by gnome

adventurers.  The  gnomes  claim  that  a  shipwreck  on  their

southern coast yielded evidence in a logbook that the demon-

hive was brought from Xendrik. Many dispute that claim,

choosing instead to believe that the gnomes engineered the

demonhive as a weapon. Some others  nd cause to believe

this theory because demonhives appeared in several nations

across Khorvaire in the months leading up to the signing of

the Treaty of Thronehold. Others agree with the gnomes but

still have reason to suspect their motives. One rumor holds

that the shipwrecked vessel did not come from Xendrik, or

even the sea at all, but instead hailed from Mabar and some-

how sailed the void between planes. The mystery endures

to this day, because the gnomes cannot or will not produce

the ship or its logbook.

DEMONHIVES IN FAERN

Demonhives  probably  originated  in  the  Demonweb  Pits,

where they preyed upon the planes many spiders and were in

turn preyed upon by them. Demonhives then spread through

portals  to  the  Abyss,  where  some  tanarri  took  a  special

interest in them. From there they traveled to Furys Heart,

where their rapacious nature earned the favor of Malar. Now

demonhives can be found in all three planes, but Malar and

demons also bring the insectlike outsiders to the Material

Plane. Demons sometimes herd them through open portals,

whereas Malar often in icts them on the weak but annoying

enemies of his vicious hunters, which thus can spend their

energy hunting more worthy prey.

ECOLOGY

The ecology of a demonhive resembles that of a beehive. A

reproductive queen gives birth to thousands of demonets,

most  of  which  grow  up  to  be  attendants  that  care  for  the

queen and her demonets. Attendants hunt in the surround-

ing territory and work to construct the hive. Demonhives

prefer to occupy caves or building complexes that they dis-

cover, but attendants can slowly dig out a warren of tunnels

for the hive to occupy should the need arise.

Demonhive  members  eat  only  carrion  and  fresh  meat.

The attendants hunt singly or in small groups and attack

any living thing they encounter. A combat that doesnt end

quickly  in  victory  draws  other  hunting  attendants  to  the

area within 5 minutes. The attendants hunt throughout a

2-mile-radius area around the hive. This is the range of their

hive mind, and they never willingly leave it. An area well

populated  with  prey  can  sustain  a  demonhive  for  several

months, but when food runs out, the queen begins to starve.

In  this  state,  she  continues  to  give  birth  but  kills  one  of

her attendants each day. The queen does not eat the corpse

but instead leaves it for her demonets and other attendants

to feed on. When the queen dies, her surviving demonet

swarms and attendants separate to create new hives in more

bountiful areas.

A queen gives birth to a demonet every 10 minutes, creat-

ing enough to constitute a swarm after 1 week. Demonets

do not hunt, and indeed they dont even attack intruders

unless an attendant or the queen attacks  rst. Demonets

are born genderless, but with a regular diet of meat, most

mature into male demonhive attendants. Roughly one in

three thousand demonets is female. These females remain

immature  and  swarm  with  their  siblings  as  long  as  the

queen lives.

When the queen dies, female demonets release a scent that

draws  surviving  attendants  to  them.  The  attendants  then

hunt  for  and  guard  the  swarm  until  its  members  mature

into more attendants and a queen. Should several demonet

swarms produce queens in this way, the swarms and atten-

dants split up, each seeking a new location for a hive.

Environment:  Demonhives  once  existed  only  on  one

layer of the Abyss, but they have since spread to other layers,

as well as other planes, through gates and deliberate transfers

by  ends interested in causing havoc. Such transplants tend

to be short-lived in the Upper Planes, where inhabitants take

pains to eradicate the threat, but the Material Plane offers a

pleasant environment for demonhives to thrive.

Demonhives can exist in any temperate and warm lands,

but  they  are  most  successful  in  forests  and  jungles.  With

no protection from the elements but their hives and hides,

demonhive members  nd cold lands inhospitable.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A demonet is approxi-

mately the size and weight of a rat. A demonhive attendant

measures about 3 feet long and weighs about 40 pounds. A

demonhive queen is enormous, measuring 10 feet long and

nearly as much around. Her wings are feeble things, approxi-

mately the size of an attendants. A typical queen weighs as

Dwarf ancestor

A  dwarf  ancestor  is  the  spirit  of  an  ancient  dwarf  hero

brought  back  from  the  afterlife  to  serve  by  the  will  and

prayers of a dwarf cleric. It comes to those who plead to Mora-

din the Soul Forger for aid. When  rst summoned, a dwarf

ancestor takes up residence within a statue of a dwarf hero,

animating it. As a result, many mistake the stony creatures

for constructs on  rst encountering them.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A dwarf ancestor is called to aid its people in times of crisis.

It defends dwarven halls with grim determination, and it

does not retreat or give quarter. It  ghts until destroyed or

until those dwarves it is protecting are safe.

Although  of  lawful  good  alignment,  the  ancestor  does

not distinguish between enemies on the basis of their moral

philosophies. If its descendants are in danger, it attacks all

who threaten them. It is not unintelligent, though, and the

possessing spirit was usually a warrior in a previous life. It

focuses on the most dangerous-looking combatant  rst and

exploits  its  Power  Attack  to  maximize  damage  (taking  its

opponents  armor  into  consideration)  to  defeat  it  quickly,

turning on the next with a Cleave attack whenever possible.

Despite its impressive damage reduction, it has no special

protection against spells, so it targets obvious spellcasters

as quickly as possible.

It is unusual to encounter more than one or two dwarf

ancestors, although in times of war the priests of Moradin

might  call  for  additional  assistance.  Usually  an  ancestor

provides a bulwark in melee for a group of dwarf soldiers.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Dwarf ancestors are most often guardians that defend their

charges with un agging zeal.

Guardians  (EL  6):  A  single  dwarf  ancestor  is  called  to

protect a sacred site, such as the tomb of a champion or a

temple to Moradin.

EL 6: Ulfgar Silverhand was a dwarven defender who was

killed protecting his king from a squad of orc raiders. Now he

watches over the kings tomb as an ancestral spirit. Two dwarf

crossbow archers also guard the site, allowing the ancestor

to engage foes in melee while they attack from range.

Corrupted Guardians (EL 8): Dwarf ancestors were cor-

rupted by duergar invaders. The ancestor spirits now guard

the evil duergar as if they were the original dwarves.

EL 8: Duergar made an unholy pact with a group of mind

 ayers, trading slaves in return for the mind  ayers aid in

capturing Fellhammer shrine with little bloodshed. Once

the  dwarves  guarding  the  shrine  were  captured,  the

duergar entered the structure and bound the ances-

tral spirits to their own purposes. Two corrupted

dwarf ancestors and four duergar warriors guard

the shrine.

ECOLOGY

Dwarf ancestors appear only when they are called

to  defend.  They  are  the  spirits  of  heroes  long

dead, returned to the Material Plane in times

of need. They have no need of food, drink,

sleep,  or  air.  An  ancestor  might  stand  for

centuries to guard a holy place, but most often it comes for a

speci c battle and is released afterward. Dwarves are loath

to imprison such valiant souls, preferring to send them back

to Moradins halls as soon as possible.

The  bond  between  dwarf  ancestor  and  its  statue  host

cannot be severed by any means except slaying the creature

or banishing it back to Moradins halls (although the statue

remains behind, inert, in the latter case).

Corrupted Ancestors: Dwarf ancestors sometimes fall into

the hands of duergar. These unfortunate souls are usually

corrupted  by  the  duergar  (whom  the  ancestors  see  only

as dwarves) and turned against their true nature. In lands

where dwarf strongholds have fallen to duergar attack, some

deranged  ancestors  patrol  ancient  corridors,  looking  to

assuage their pain in the blood of living creatures.

Environment:  Dwarf  ancestors  are  nearly  always

found  in  underground  complexes,  forming  the  last

line  of  defense  for  a  community.  Royal  halls,  ancestral

homes,  and  temples  are  some  of  the  places  most  likely

to be guarded by a dwarf ancestor, although some dwarf

priests  can  summon  these  champions  of  Moradin  into

other battles for a short time.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical dwarf ances-

tor enters a statue 12 feet tall. The statue is carved from the

native rock, often granite, and (depending on the kind of

can be that of anything from a relatively low-level  ghter

to a great champion. The outward appearance of the statue

gives no hint as to the strength of the outsider within.

Although the example given here is armed with a greataxe,

a dwarf ancestor can wield whatever weapon the statue bears

(usually a dwarven waraxe, maul, or greatclub).

Alignment: Dwarf ancestors are always lawful good. They

are the spirits of those who fought sel essly for their people,

and they are the implacable enemies of all that threaten the

dwarf clans. Corrupted ancestors, however, are usually lawful

evil.

SOCIETY

Dwarf ancestors answer the call of Moradins beleaguered

faithful,  because  they  were  heroes  who  protect  those  in

need. Many were themselves killed in battle and welcome

the  opportunity  to   ght  once  more  against  their  peoples

enemies.  Their  stony  bodies  suffer  no  pain,  and  they  can

 ght to utter destruction without fear, since they return to

Moradins hall at the end of the battle.

Dwarf warriors are  erce and fearless, but these reconsti-

tuted champions  ght with a ruthlessness and lust for battle

that is awe-inspiring. They have nothing to lose, and their

cause is the most noble. They shout and sing in their grind-

ing, booming voices as their weapons whirl.

SAMPLE LAIR:

CORRUPTED TEMPLE OF MORADIN

A once-proud dwarf temple has been occupied by a foul group

of  duergar.  The  place  is  still  protected  by  a  pair  of  dwarf

ancestors  summoned  centuries  ago,  and  they  now  follow

the will of the duergar.

1. Hall of Worship: This area is where ceremonies dedi-

cated to Moradin took place. Four statues of dwarf heroes

stand  watch  over  the  temple  area  (none  of  them  contain

ancestors). Two more inanimate statues  ank the altar.

2. The Great Forge (EL 4): This chamber was for forging

and blessing magic weapons. Only the priests, temple smith,

and weapon creators entered this sacred place when dwarves

dwelt  here,  but  now  duergar  come  and  go  as  they  please,

using the forge as they see  t. A hallow spell is centered on

the forge. Four duergar warriors work the forge.

Duergar Warriors (4): hp 9 each; MM 91.

3. Corrupted Dwarf Ancestors (EL 8): Two great statues

of Moradin stand in these locations, each desecrated with

blood and offal, and greatly damaged by the strokes of ham-

mers  and  picks.  The  two  statues  contain  dwarf  ancestors,

set to guard the inner sanctum but now corrupted by the

duergar. When any nonduergar attempts to pass through the

doors leading west, they move to attack.

Dwarf Ancestors (2): hp 67 each; see above.

4. Clerics Cells: These austere sleeping quarters contain

ruined cots.

5. High Priests Quarters: This larger chamber housed

the temples high priest. It is more comfortably appointed

and a scroll of heal.

but  no  magic  would  summon  a  god.  Only  the  imminent

destruction  of  his  people  might  bring  the  Soul  Forger  to

 ght in person.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A  cleric  of  Moradin  can  summon  a  dwarf  ancestor  using

summon monster V or a higher-level summon monster spell or

can call on a dwarf ancestor for longer periods of service with

a planar ally spell. The basic version of the creature can be

called using lesser planar ally, but advanced ancestors require

higher-level versions of the spell.

A  summoner  must  still  pay  the  price  required  for  the

ancestors service. However, because it is called in defense of

Moradins children, the gp cost equivalent is one-half normal.

Typically this offering is used to craft superior or magical battle

gear for the settlements defenses. The cleric might instead

perform  a  service  for  the  settlement,  such  as  raising  dead

combatants at no charge or embarking on a perilous quest.

DWARF ANCESTORS IN EBERRON

The dwarf clans of the Mror Holds are the undisputed masters

of  nance in Eberron, and the massive vaults beneath Korunda

Gate are  lled with incalculable wealth in both precious metals

and magical artifacts. Dwarf ancestors, themselves often the

spirits of long-dead leaders of House Kundarak, stand guard

over these riches. Defending the wealth of clients (and of the

house) is as vital to these mercantile dwarves as protecting

their people in war. However, no one spirit is required to spend

more than two centuries performing this duty. Lesser vaults

in other centers of House Kundarak might also have ancestor

spirits watching over them.

Spirits for such duty are sent by Kol Korran, the Lord of

World and Wealth, rather than by Moradin, and they demand

the normal price for their service. Those who answer the call

to defend their people are summoned through prayers to Dol

Dorn and require only one-half normal payment.

DWARF ANCESTORS IN FAERN

Although  any  dwarf  community  might  call  on  ancestors

for aid, the most famed statues of dwarf heroes are found

in Mithral Hall. This great city of the shield dwarves in the

Silver  Marches  was  reclaimed  from  the  dragon  Shimmer-

gloom only a few short decades earlier, and many warriors fell

at the side of their champion, Bruenor Battlehammer. King

Bruenor is now dedicated to restoring the citys ancient glory

and to removing the threat from the Underdark for good.

Many  spirits  of  fallen  champions  now  inhabit  the  statues

of Mithral Hall, and they accompany war parties into the

Underdark or stand guard over the mithral miners who have

once again ventured into the haunted tunnels.

In  addition  to  Moradin,  the  dwarven  deities  Berronar

Truesilver,  Clangeddin  Silverbeard,  and  Gorm  Gulthyn

sometimes send ancestor spirits in response to prayer. These

gods share the portfolios of defending the dwarf community

and are receptive to requests for aid.

nearly unreadable. Of greater interest is a trove of engraved

stone tablets that contain liturgical lore. Six duergar warriors

guard this room.

Duergar Warriors (6): hp 9 each; MM 91.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A dwarf ancestor, being a spirit called into this world, pos-

sesses  no  treasure.  A  slain  spirit  does  not  leave  behind

its  weapon,  which  is  destroyed  along  with  the  statue  that

houses the ancestor. When ancestors are encountered with

a warband or company of dwarves, the group yields treasure

(largely in the form of equipment) commensurate with its

Encounter  Level.  If  the  PCs  dare  to  plunder  a  temple  of

Moradin, they can recover the offerings made to summon an

ancestor (if the money has not already been used).

ADVANCED DWARF ANCESTORS

Although  the  size  and  appearance  of  the  statue  does  not

change, the spirit within might be that of a very powerful

warrior. A dwarf ancestor can have up to 18 Hit Dice (the

maximum allowed by the greater planar ally spell) but is still

Large size. More powerful champions are avatars of Moradin

and require epic-level magic to call upon. These spirits are

housed in Huge statues; such sculptures exist only in the

greatest  centers  of  Moradins  worship.  Legend  holds  that

Moradin himself once appeared in the form of an ancestor,

Drow: Lolths Sting, dark sniper, and arcane guard

55

In drow culture, assassination is a frequent means of advance-

ment or of keeping ones status. The clerics of Lolth, intent

on retaining their top position, train an elite group of female

drow assassins. The best of these are given the rank of Lolths

Sting.

The Lolths Sting presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments, Hit Dice ability score

increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 12, Dex 15, Con 14,

Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

Stealth and surprise are the cornerstones of a Stings tactics.

When stalking her target, she prepares by consuming her

elixir of hiding and elixir of sneaking, increasing her Hide and

Move Silently bonuses to +20.

A Lolths Sting tries to make her  rst attack from hiding,

gaining  her  sudden  strike  bonus  without  requiring  a  use

of ghost step. Once combat begins, she uses ghost step to

remain invisible, attacking with her sudden strike from a

different direction each round.

If  her  foe  is  formidable  and  resistant  to  drow  poison,  a

Lolths Sting retreats under cover of darkness or smoke, cour-

tesy of a smokestick. She lingers in the area long enough to

determine if her target succumbs to her poisons secondary

effect, perhaps rejoining battle if an enemy falls unconscious

and evens the odds against her.

In groups, Stings use invisibility, smoke, and darkness to

conceal their true numbers. Half the group attacks at once,

while the others cover their weapons with drow poison. In

alternating rounds the groups switch roles.

DARK SNIPER

A drow holds his bow at the ready, a hunters gleam in his eye. His

cloak makes him seem to blend into the surrounding terrain.

Dark  snipers  patrol  the  caverns  and  tunnels  near  drow

settlements and outposts. They use their mobility to harass

opponents until stronger reinforcements arrive.

The  dark  sniper  presented  here  had  the  following  abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments, Hit Dice ability score

increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 13, Dex 15, Con 14,

Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

Dark snipers choose hiding places along the thoroughfares

of the subterranean realm. They fully exploit their superior

darkvision, typically launching arrows when targets are still

nearly 100 feet away.

In close combat, a dark sniper is constantly on the move,

using Shot on the Run extensively after moving at least 10

feet so that he gains the bene t of his skirmish ability. His

Tumble skill allows him to safely withdraw from foes that

close to melee range. His favorite tactic involves waiting until

a target has moved within 30 feet, then making an attack

while  backing  away,  preventing  opponents  from  making

more than a single attack against him.

A dark sniper uses terrain to his advantage and tries to

prevent opponents from charging by moving through ter-

rain that slows movement. In groups, dark snipers split up;

if one is attacked, the others are still free to maneuver and

attack from other directions.

Arcane guards are multitalented male drow who wield both

steel and spell. They are not quite powerful enough to con-

tinue their wizardly pursuits, but they understand the inner

workings  of  arcane  institutes  well  enough  that  powerful

drow wizards and sorcerers want to keep them in the fold.

Arcane guards have also been trained to  ght, combining

magic with their martial abilities.

The arcane guard presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments, Hit Dice ability score

increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 12, Dex 13, Con 14,

Int 15, Wis 10, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

If he has time to prepare, an arcane guard casts shield and

 y before battle. He then tries to  y up out of reach of his

foes, to take advantage of his spiked chains greater reach,

and uses his potion of haste if he needs to make more melee

attacks.

If  ying, an arcane guard  rst reduces the threat of the

most  capable-looking  melee  combatant  by  using  ray  of

enfeeblement. He then tries to place himself within 10 feet of

an enemy spellcaster or other ranged attacker, alternating

between spiked chain attacks and ranged spells.

In groups, arcane guards focus their spells on the most

dangerous target or on a healer, if that individual becomes a

nuisance.

DROW PRIESTESS

The humanoid has smooth, black skin and pale silver hair. She is

slightly shorter and slimmer than a human. She wears a black-

ened breastplate with a human-headed spider embossed on it,

and she carries a light shield with a similar decoration.

No group or organization wields more power in drow society

than the clerics of Lolth. Drow priestesses are respected, or

at least feared, by nearly all other drow. They act on the will

of the Spider Queen, and occasionally on their own whim,

always vying for more power and the favor of their goddess.

They serve as battle eld commanders, constables, detectives,

and judges, as the situation requires.

The drow priestess presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments, Hit Dice ability score

increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 13, Dex 12, Con 14,

Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

A  drow  priestess  relishes  sowing  confusion  among  her

opponents.  Rarely  encountered  without  other  minions,  a

priestess does not immediately endanger herself in melee,

instead using summon monster spells to call additional allies

to her side.

A drow priestess is willing to convert many of her spells to

spontaneously cast in ict wounds, though she saves air walk

and freedom of movement in case she needs to escape.

Knowledge (History)

DC  Result

12

This creature is a drow, a subterranean and

generally evil elf.

The drow trace their lineage back to an elf splinter

group that rejected the elves love of freedom and

nature.

Some drow live on the surface, but most live

underground and emerge only at night to conduct

trade or make raids.

Slaves perform most of the physical labor in drow

society.

Knowledge (Religion)

DC  Result

15  Most drow worship Lolth, the spider goddess. She

20

once fomented rebellion against the other elven

gods and then literally led her followers

underground.

Lolth is both cruel and capricious; she demands

many sacrifices and demonstrations of loyalty. She

also foments internal discord to keep her chosen

people tough and ruthless.

Religious infighting plagues the drow. Those

disaffected with Lolths rule seek other gods.

25

If one of her allies should be reduced to negative hit points,

the priestess rushes to the side of her fallen comradenot

to heal, but to cast death knell to gain power from his ebbing

life force.

The spider is a perfect creature: elegant in her symmetry,

silent in her step, and deadly in her hunting. In short,

she is much like a drow.

Kaellara, cleric of Lolth

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Drow usually operate in small groups dedicated to accom-

plishing some mission. Dark snipers could work in concert

with  Lolths  Stings,  or  at  the  behest  of  a  drow  priestess.

Most encounters with drow include more than one of the

dark elvesan encounter involving four to six is common.

A single drow is more likely to  nd reinforcements before

engaging foes, at the very least to provide witnesses to her

own prowess.

Patrol (EL 911): Groups of dark snipers most often patrol

a communitys boundaries as the  rst layer of defense.

EL 11: A squad of four male dark snipers (Krizzun, Lurnad,

Tethlar, and Zakphar) are charged with keeping a lookout

for intruders. They occupy a remote outpost that overlooks

a point where a trade route crosses a deep chasm. The group

would love to capture one of their opponents to take home

for questioning.

Strike Force (EL 9+): If the leaders of a drow community

detect a threat, they mobilize a strike force quickly. Many

drow jump at the chance to prove their abilities, curry the

favor of superiors, or simply engage in random bloodshed.

A strike force includes multiple drow, with oneusually a

priestessin obvious command.

EL 10: A drow priestess has been dispatched to deal with

an incursion. Moving quietly through the shadows behind

her, three Lolths Stings await her command to kill. When

she gives the word, they eagerly move ahead invisibly to deal

death to their foes.

ECOLOGY

Unlike  surface-dwelling  elves,  drow  thrive  in  the  light-

deprived depths. Their darkvision exceeds that of most of the

other denizens and provides a signi cant advantage. Their

spell-like abilities also give them a great deal of control over

illumination.

Like most humanoids, drow shape their environment to

suit them. They create cities and settlements near valuable

resources such as potable water or mithral mines. They use

slaves to farm mushrooms and other underground plants, as

well as domesticate monstrous spiders for use as mounts and

guards.

Environment: Most drow loathe the sun and prefer to

dwell deep underground. They construct sprawling under-

ground cities of stone and metal. Their grandest buildings

have bizarre shapes with weirdly elegant sculptural adorn-

ments. Permanent effects that resemble faerie  re cover many

of their buildings, giving drow cities a ghostly look.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Like other elves, drow

are short and willowy in comparison to humans. Females are

slightly larger than males; an adult female is from 5 to 5-1/2

O

R

D

,

feet tall and weighs between 95 and 120 pounds. Males are

around 5 feet tall and weigh between 80 and 110 pounds.

Drow have smooth black skin and  nely chiseled features.

They have pale hair; white is the most common color, but

silver, gray, or white-gold hair is not unknown.

Alignment:  Most  drow  are  neutral  evil,  but  many  are

chaotic evil. In spite of their penchant for status and titles,

few drow are lawful. They value unpredictability

and a talent for improvisation.

SOCIETY

Drow consider themselves superior

to  all  other  mortal  beings  and

harbor a virulent disdain for sur-

face  elves  and  other  drow  who

have  returned  to  sunlit  lands.

Drow love pleasure and despise

physical  laborexcept  for

 ghting  and  killing.  Slaves

perform  nearly  all  the

heavy work in drow soci-

ety.  The  drows  strange

architecture  and  epicu-

rean  tastes  are  only  two

aspects of their hedonism.

Drow  society  is  matriarchal.

Males  are  valued  but  considered

expendable. Drow clerics wield tre-

mendous  in uence,  and  the  faction

who can boast the senior priestess of

Lolth in a community has enough

prestige to claim control, at least

outwardly.  Drow  priestesses

jealously  guard  Lolths  status

as the patron of all drow and

root  out  any  backsliders

who dare put another deity

before Lolth.

The priesthood is just one layer in a

society that has a preponderance of titles.

Drow  society  is  fragmented  into  many

noble  houses,  merchant  families,  and

guilds, all vying for power. The drow believe

that the strongest should rule, and the various

drow factions constantly strive to prove that they

are the strongest, often by undermining their rivals.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Drow have standard treasure for NPCs of their Challenge

Rating, but most encountered outside their lairs carry little

besides  ghting gear and a few spare coins. At home, drow

covet platinum and adamantine trinkets and jewelry. They

also  have  a  taste  for  fantastic  sculptures  and  tapestries,

though most surface-dwellers  nd these items obscene or

at least disturbing.

DROW AS CHARACTERS

See page 103 of the Monster Manual for information on drow

as characters.

DROW AND THE

LOLTH-TOUCHED TEMPLATE

Lolth-touched mounts and beasts of burden (usually vermin)

abound in drow society and are mainly used by the nobility

and the priestly classes. They are far stronger and hardier

than ordinary creatures of their kind, and they ease covert

travel. Occasionally, a drow might become Lolth-

touched, and such individuals (even males) are

highly  respected  in  drow  society.

For  more  about  Lolth-touched

creatures, see page 92.

DROW IN

EBERRON

The split between drow and elf

occurred long before the giants

of Xendrik enslaved the elves.

Secure  in  their  underground

enclaves, the drow were spared the

humiliation of servitude.

Today, the drow have nomi-

nal control of the continent of

Xendrik and the ruins of the

giants  fallen  empire.  Their

largest  settlements  still  lie

underground in Khyber, partly

because  of  the  drows  sensitiv-

ity  to  light  but  also  because  the

surface  of  Xendrik  is  a  wild  and

dangerous place teeming with giants

and  other  fearsome  monsters.  Still,

the drow believe that they, who have

never been slaves, are the true keepers

of elven valor and dignity.

The  drow  of  Xendrik  worship

the scorpion god Vulkoor. Elsew-

ere,  most  drow  revere  the  Fury.

Lolth is unknown on Eberron.

DROW IN FAERN

Drow  rule  large  stretches  of  the  Faernian

Underdark. Internal strife has driven many back

to the surface, where the drow are engaged in a

concerted effort to reclaim the forest of Cormanthor from

the elves.

Drow merchants handle a lively trade with anyone who

values wealth over any moral qualms, including the Zhents

and certain merchant houses of Sembia.

Internal  strife  among  the  drow  is  re ected  in  battles

between  the  drow  deities  (or  perhaps  its  the  other  way

around). Lolth remains the patron of the race. Rival deities

include Ghaunadaur (the Elder Eye), Kiaransalee (a deity of

the dead), and Vhaeraun (patron of rogues and male drow).

The goddess Eilistraee is the patron of good-aligned drow

who wish to live in peace on the surface of the world.

GIANT, CRAAGHORAN

Twisted and deformed, this massive giant appears to have jagged

stone formations growing from its body at odd angles. Its expres-

sion is wild and frenetic as it shambles forward.

Once a craaghoran has a group split up, it moves in fast,

attempting to drop single opponents as quickly as possible,

using Power Attack and rend to good effect. It might even

rise from below the surface or emerge from the ceiling to

attack.

Earth Glide (Ex) A craaghoran giant can glide through stone,

dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as

easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves

behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or

other signs of its presence.

Rend (Ex) If a craaghoran giant hits with both claw attacks,

it latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh.

This attack automatically deals an additional 4d8+15

points of damage.

Craaghoran  giants  are  rare  stone  giant  offshoots  created

millennia  ago  when  earth  elemental  energy  warped  and

twisted their ancestors. They can glide through stone like

earth elementals. Combined with their power to cast wall of

stone, craaghorans excel at building deadly, intricate traps

and ambush points high in the mountains.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Though bestial in appearance, a craaghoran giant is a canny

hunter and uses its environment and its wall of stone ability

to divide a group before it strikes, eliminating its opponents

singly when possible. A typical craaghoran carefully builds

an intricate series of passages, bridges, and tunnels in and

near its lair using wall of stone. It delights in creating sharp

turns that prevent intruders from seeing too far ahead. In

such cramped, tight quarters, the giant can use a single wall

of stone to divide its opponents. The giants earth glide ability

allows it to ignore stone barriers as it moves to attack.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Craaghoran giants gather in small groups. They sometimes

ally with evil stone giants, and they often gather orcs, ogres,

and other smaller creatures as slaves or grudging allies.

Slaver (EL 10): An ambitious craaghoran seeks to capture

dwarves to enslave as skilled artisans. The creature uses earth

glide to discreetly spy on an adventuring party with a dwarf

member. When it  nally attacks, it uses wall of stone to sepa-

rate the dwarf from the rest of the group. It then attacks to

subdue its victim, initially dealing normal damage before

switching to nonlethal blows as the battle progresses. If the

craaghoran has a clear escape path, it grapples the dwarf and

attempts to carry him off.

Twins (EL 12): A pair of craaghoran giants use their earth

glide ability to confuse and frighten their enemies. These two

creatures were born identical twins and use their similarity

to misdirect opponents. The giants attack as normal, but they

leap into the fray one at a time. The  rst giant attacks, tears

into its foes, and then  ees into the ground when it has lost

one-half or more of its hit points. After a round or two, when

the party  nally relaxes its guard, the second giant emerges

from the earth. The  rst giant uses wall of stone to protect

its sibling and frustrate the partys attempts to coordinate

attacks. It then rejoins the melee at an opportune moment.

ECOLOGY

Craaghorans were originally created by blending stone giants

and the essence of earth elementals. The in ux of elemental

energy warped and twisted the giants, leaving them with the

A craaghoran giants thick, rocky hide absorbs

some of the force of every blow that strikes it.

A craaghoran giants most dangerous talent is its

ability to walk through stone as a fish swims

through water. These fierce creatures can emerge

from the ground below a traveling party.

A craaghoran giant can generate walls of stone as

ability to control and shape earth but forever altering their

physical appearance. They can subsist on rocks and dirt, but

they particularly enjoy the taste and texture of worked stone.

Craaghorans gather gems, precious metals, and

other items as trophies and

trade goods.

Environment:

Craaghoran  giants

prefer mountainous

terrain, particularly

if  a  region  contains

a  great  deal  of  stone

nearby.  When  not  hunt-

ing  or  defending  their  territory,

craaghoran  giants  enjoy  manipu-

lating  their  environment  to  suit

their living needs and tastes, and

they often create elaborate struc-

tures of stone using their magical

abilities.

Typical  Physical  Char-

acteristics:  A  typical

craaghoran giant stands up

to 20 feet tall and can weigh

as much as 14,000 pounds.

Infused  with  the  pow-

er  of  elemental  earth,

these creatures can live

up to 800 years.

Alignment:  Craaghoran

giants  are  usually  neutral  evil.

Extremely sel sh and inherently cruel, they are

also rarely predictable, switching between spon-

taneous and planned action at a moments notice.

More  contemplative  members  of  the  race

might be neutral, though they are rare.

Craaghoran giants prefer to live alone, since each one needs

space to build the intricate passages, mazes, bridges, and other

structures it prefers. They are  ercely territorial, but some-

times  small  families  of  related  craaghorans  live  together.

These clans claim wide stretches of territory. They demand

tolls for those who use the paths they make in the mountains,

and they quickly capture and kill travelers who enter their

domain. Evil warlords sometimes pay tribute to craaghoran

giants for the right to travel unmolested through the moun-

tains they inhabit. The ever-greedy, mercenary craaghorans

happily take such bribes from multiple sources but allow only

the highest bidder access to their mountain passes.

Craaghoran giants usually keep orcs, dwarves, goblins,

and ogres as slaves and servants. An orc tribe might provide

scouts and guardians for the giants territory. Craaghorans

love to enslave dwarves in particular: The stout folks skill

in working metal and stone makes them excellent aides

and  helpers.  Craaghorans  take  pride  in  the  stone  struc-

tures  they  erect.  Among  their  kind,  craaghorans  judge

prestige  and  ability  by  the  beauty  and  majesty  of  their

lairs  and  territories.  Travelers  who  enter  a  craaghorans

territory  might  see  elaborate  statues,  massive  bas-relief

carvings wrought into cliff faces, and other archi-

tectural wonders. Few suspect that such beautiful

works are the products of fundamentally

malevolent creatures. Many dungeons and

other old, monster-infested structures were

originally  crafted  by  craaghoran  giants  as

demonstrations of their skill with stone

and earth.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Craaghoran giants have treasure ap-

propriate to their Challenge Rating,

about 5,800 gp. They frequently de-

mand tribute from lesser giants and

other creatures that might be in a

position to serve them. While they

have little use for magic items they do not

understand, and likely believe most such

items to be inferior to their own in-

born  powers,  craaghoran  giants  are

fond of gems,  ne jewelry, gold, and

platinum.  They  use  such  goods  to

enhance the natural beauty of their

works, as well as to trade for useful

magic items and other goods.

CRAAGHORAN GIANTS

IN EBERRON

Though unusual, craaghoran giants can be found on the con-

tinent of Xendrik living among others of their kind, most

typically stone giants. Here the craaghorans are still great

builders, looking to relive the glorious past by constructing

massive stone monuments. Claustrophobic as a group, they

shun the halls of Khyber, preferring to live in more open

dwellings of their own construction aboveground.

CRAAGHORAN GIANTS IN FAERN

Created by druids devoted to Gond in ancient times in an at-

tempt to more ably fend off Netherese wizards, craaghoran

giants have since had the opportunity to spread throughout

Faern. Wherever large mountains or stone mesas are found,

a group of adventurers might encounter one of these crea-

tures, though they tend to be less social the farther north

they live. However, this insularity doesnt make the creatures

any less dangerous.

GITHYANKI

Initially presented in the Monster Manual, the relentlessly

militaristic,  psionics-using  githyanki  dwell  on  the  Astral

Plane. A dour, brutal, and harsh race, they were once slaves

of the mind  ayers. Now they travel the planes, conquering

worlds and hunting mind  ayers wherever they can be found,

all in the name of their dreaded lich-queen.

Githyanki  are  consummate  artisans  and  metalsmiths.

When  not  waging  war  or  staging  raids,  they  keep  busy

forging the implements they need for future con icts. They

believe that only the strong survive and that the only true

freedom lies in power. The githyanki have vowed never to

be subjugated again.

Below  are  several  examples  of  typical  githyanki  adven-

turers might encounter, separately or as a marauding raider

party.

GITHYANKI SOLDIER

This humanoid is about the size of a human but seems thin and

gaunt; the creatures sallow skin gives him a skeletal look. He has

long hair the color of drying blood, arranged in loose braids stud-

ded with beads. He wears an elaborate, but functional, breast-

plate, and he carries an equally ornate and deadly greatsword.

people. They approach their roles with ruthless ef ciency.

The githyanki soldier presented here had the following

ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 15, Dex 13, Con

Strategies and Tactics

Githyanki soldiers are resourceful combatants who disdain

simple frontal attacks. They prefer to  ght on their own terms

and at times of their choosing. Before a  ght, soldiers activate

their blur abilities for an extra defensive edge.

GISH

This wiry humanoid is clad in a chain shirt with silver and gray

links that form bands and swirls like a stormy sky. The creature

also wears a buff-colored tunic that nearly matches her sallow

skin, and she carries a bow and an elaborate greatsword.

before racial adjustments, Hit Dice ability score increases,

and  equipment  bonuses:  Str  14,  Dex  13,  Con  12,  Int  15,

Wis 10, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

Gish typically lead small squads of soldiers or serve as support

for githyanki captains (see below). Though capable in both

melee and ranged combat, they prefer to direct a battle from

the  rear,  where  they  can  use  their  spells  to  support  their

followers.

A gish uses haste at the outset of combat to improve her

allies offense and defense. The following round, she uses glit-

terdust, hoping to blind some of the enemy. She then targets

any nonblinded melee combatant with hold person or ray of

enfeeblement.

If  able,  before  combat,  a  gish  uses  her  blur  ability  and

employs her wand of bulls strength to boost her soldiers and

captain.

GITHYANKI CAPTAIN

This slim humanoid is as strong and lithe as a hunting cat. He

Strategies and Tactics

Like their underlings, githyanki captains make sure to acti-

GITHYANKI LORE

This creature is a githyanki, an Astral Plane-

dwelling humanoid. This result reveals all

humanoid traits and the extraplanar subtype.

Githyanki are generally hostile to nongithyanki,

but they harbor a special hatred for mind flayers

because they are descended from slaves who

staged a revolt against the illithids. They also have

particularly hostile feelings toward githzerai,

another race descended from the original slaves.

22  Githyanki have an array of psionic powers and a

small resistance to magic. One of a githyankis

innate abilities enables it to become difficult to

discern.

Another githyanki ability transports it instantly

across a battlefield. Githyanki of especially high

level can also travel between the planes.

A githyanki silver sword can sever an astral

travelers silver cord (MM 128). The githyanki

relentlessly pursue any nongithyanki who manages

to steal one of their silver swords.

When  ghting from dragonback, a githyanki captain rains

Rebellion is a serious crime, abhorrent to our queen.

The only excuse for rebellion is success.

EL 13: The githyanki captain Zymurani and her two gish,

Catruuk and Satiim, lead a force of ten soldiers in a light-

ning raid on a town in search of a lost silver sword. Zymurani

oversees the raid from the back of her mount, the young red

dragon Tournoach, initiating the raid with a  yover of the

town and a well-placed cone of  ery breath. PCs might save

the town by defeating the githyanki, or by convincing them

to stop attacking long enough for the party to  nd the miss-

ing sword.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

ECOLOGY

Except  for  the  occasional  scout  or  spy,  githyanki  seldom

travel  or  work  alone.  They  are  most  often  encountered  in

companies of two to four soldiers plus a leader.

Githyanki Company (EL 69): A typical githyanki com-

pany consists of two to four soldiers led by a gish. Its favorite

tactic is to ambush targets who have fallen for simple bait,

such as an apparently discarded weap-

on or a solitary githyanki.

EL 8: A company of four sol-

diers, led by a gish, are out

looking for any loot they

can   nd  and  have  set

up an ambush. Most

of  the  company

hides behind cover,

but one soldier sits

in  plain  sight  to

act as a decoy. The

githyanki   ght  to

the  death,  having

no wish to report

failure  to  their

superiors.  They

will,  however,

allow  their  foes

to  withdraw

each

a f ter

one  gives  up

a  weapon  or

magic  item

worth  at

least  300

gp  or  the

equivalent  in

gold.

Raiding  Force

(EL 1116): A gith-

yanki  raiding  force  is

commanded  by  a  captain,

with nearly a dozen soldiers

and a pair of gish for support.

A captain of status might also

ride  a  young  or  juvenile  red

dragon.

Most githyanki live in massive castles on the Astral Plane.

There  eating  and  drinking  are  not  necessary,  and  the

githyanki  have  lost  their  appetite  for  food.  They  require

nourishment when venturing onto other planes, however,

and  most  of  their  Astral  settlements  include  caves  where

farmers  raise  some  livestock  and  tend  fungus  beds.  Gith-

yanki food is notoriously bland, in keeping

with their general lack of interest in the

culinary arts. Field rations usually in-

clude salted meat, dried mushrooms,

and  a  smattering  of  other  pre-

served foods, such as dried fruit

and hardtack, which they have

stolen  or  acquired

through trade.

Githyanki

consider all other

sentient  creatures

to  be  enemies,

and they harbor

a  special  hatred

for  mind  f lay-

ers.  In  a  battle,

they  usually  try

to  eliminate  any

mind   ayers   rst.

Githyanki  might

intervene  when  ad-

venturers are  ghting

mind   ayers,  only  to

turn on the party once

the illithids are dead.

Environment: Gith-

yanki are most at home

on  the  Astral  Plane,

where conditions such

as  gravity,  inclement

64

Githyanki soldier, gish, and captain

weather, or hunger dont bother them. On the Material Plane,

githyanki can be found wherever they can prey on other be-

ings. They usually remain near the fringes of civilization,

where they have a good chance of staging successful raids

without encountering too much opposition.

Typical Physical Characteristics: See page 127 of the

Monster Manual for information on typical githyanki height

and weight.

Alignment: Most githyanki have evil alignments, although

they might be lawful, neutral, or chaotic. The githyankis evil

largely stems from their kill-or-be-killed philosophy. Lawful

githyanki embrace their militaristic society, and they thrive

on the structure it provides. Chaotic githyanki chafe under

the yoke of military discipline and generally do all they can to

work independently or in small groups far away from a supe-

riors in uence. Neutral githyanki acknowledge the bene ts

of an established social order but privately doubt that it is the

only way their people can survive.

SOCIETY

By their own account, the githyanki once served the mind

 ayers as slaves and chattel. They won their freedom through

a  brilliantly  and  patiently  organized  revoltquite  an  ac-

complishment in the face of the mind  ayers ability to read

thoughts. A female named Gith organized the revolt. When

the time to act was right, the slaves rose as one. Small groups

escaped  into  the  Astral  Plane,  where  they  regrouped  and

fought off scores of mind  ayers that pursued them. Eventu-

ally, the mind  ayers were forced to give up the struggle (or

chose to give it up, according to the mind  ayers). When the

war  nally ended, the slaves chose the name githyanki, which

means children of Gith in the secret tongue the slaves de-

veloped for their revolt.

The githyanki have never known peace. Just after help-

ing them win their freedom, Gith ordered the githyanki

to  begin  a  full-scale  extermination  of  the  mind   ayers.

But one group among the freed slaves believed that Gith

was simply replacing one tyrannical regime with another.

A male named Zerthimon led this group of rebels, and the

crusade against the mind  ayers ended prematurely as civil

war erupted among the newly freed slaves. In the end, the

race splintered into two factions: those who  ed to the As-

tral Plane and followed Gith (the githyanki) and those who

 ed to Limbo and followed Zerthimon (the githzerai). To

this day, the races cannot stand each other, and githyanki

and githzerai attack each other on sight. Only the sight of

a mind  ayer can cause a githyanki and githzerai to tem-

porarily put aside their differences and unite against the

common, most hated foe.

Githyanki  live  in  forti ed  settlements  organized  along

military lines. Each community has a ruler, whose orders all

subordinates are bound to obey. Each community leader in

turn has a superior based in a larger settlement. A githyanki

leaders position is far from secure. Individuals tend to be

loyal  to  their  people  as  a  whole,  not  to  particular  leaders.

Mutinies that remove incompetent leaders occur from time

to time, and these small internal revolts are generally toler-

ated as long as the mutineers succeed and can demonstrate

that they did not act capriciously. Githyanki who rebel and

fail face swift execution.

The  current  leader  of  all  githyanki  is  Queen  Vlaakith,

who has reigned for more than a thousand years. Vlaakith

is a 24th-level wizard and a lich. She slays all githyanki who

become powerful enough to challenge her rule (MM 128).

Scholars well versed in interplanar affairs suspect that these

sacri ces are part of Vlaakiths continuing effort to achieve

godhood. Those githyanki who draw the lich-queens ire or

fail in an assignment might be destroyed even before they

reach suf cient power to be viewed as a threat. Most gith-

yanki are blissfully unaware of Vlaakiths intentions toward

them when they reach higher levels, which is why she has

ruled uncontested for so longand because her actions leave

no witnesses.

Whatever  Vlaakiths  true  motivations  for  slaying  her

brightest  subjects,  the  githyanki  have  a  culture  without  a

god  and  largely  without  religion,  which  suits  their  desire

for self-suf ciency. They do not have any clerics, but a few

pursue alternative divine spellcasting classes, mostly rang-

ers and blackguards. Most githyanki revere Gith, but she is

honored as a legendary ancestor and heroine, not as a deity.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Most  githyanki  have  standard  treasure  for  NPCs  of  their

Challenge  Rating.  They  favor  masterwork  weapons  and

armor,  and  usually  carry  a  few  other  offensive  items  as

well.

GITHYANKI AS CHARACTERS

See  page  128  of  the  Monster  Manual  for  information  on

githyanki as characters.

GITHYANKI IN EBERRON

When  the  Gatekeepers  severed  the  connection  to  Xoriat,

the githyanki and githzerai took the opportunity to turn on

their mind  ayer masters, escaping their slavery en masse.

The githyanki retreated to the Astral Plane, lured by its time-

less qualities. A few githyanki and githzerai stayed on the

Material Plane and formed small communities dedicated to

maintaining the magic seals imprisoning powerful remnants

of the Xoriat interlopers. Explorers Handbook details one such

community: Katal Hazath, on the BrelandDroaam border.

Githyanki raiding parties in Eberron are usually encoun-

tered  as  they  hunt  mind   ayers  in  the  depths  of  Khyber.

Unlike those in other D&D worlds, Eberrons githyanki have

no special connection to red dragons.

GNOLL

Initially presented in the Monster Manual, gnolls are savage

humanoids  that  delight  in  cruelty  and  are  always  hungry

for the meat of thinking creatures. When gnolls look upon

the works of civilization, they see only the towering  ames

and slaughter they wish to wreak upon them. Yeenoghu, the

Demon Prince of Gnolls, watches his children and bares a

feral grin with each atrocity they commit.

he nets a foe or two. He then administers a few nonlethal

blows  to  entangled  creatures,  switching  to  lethal  attacks

only if pressed or if a foe is resilient. The gnolls and hyenas

that  follow  a  slave-taker  dont  take  orders  well  from  their

nominal leader, but they know not to feast upon net-covered

foes or those a slave-taker stands over. Creatures rendered

unconscious by the attack are dragged to the gnolls camp

and imprisoned.

SLAVE-TAKER

This humanoid is slightly taller than a human. It has a furry body

and a head like a hyenas with a brown-gray mane. Its eyes reflect

a malevolent glint in the dusk as it hefts a net.

Gnolls  regularly  capture  slaves  in  their  assaults  on  other

races. They treat slaves harshly and tend to think of the slave

population as a living larder, so they replenish their supply at

every opportunity. This duty often falls to a gnoll slave-taker.

In the hierarchy of the pack, a slave-taker usually occupies

the lowest rank above the general population.

The gnoll slave-taker presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 14, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

A  gnoll  slave-taker  rarely  acts  alone.  Most  often,  a  mix  of

gnolls and hyenas accompanies one. Large tribes might foster

groups of slave-takers, while smaller tribes might send out a

slave-taker with just a few hyenas as support.

In battle, a slave-taker uses nonlethal tactics so that some

foes survive the  ght to become slaves. He allows his com-

panions to charge while he hides and sneaks close enough

for  an  accurate  net  attack.  If  he  has  the  advantage  of  sur-

prise, a slave-taker attempts to hold his allies in check while

he drinks potions in preparation. Once he enters the fray,

Although  some  gnolls  worship  Erythnul,  most  tribes  pay

homage  to  Yeenoghu,  the  Demon  Prince  of  Gnolls.  As  a

demon lord, Yeenoghu lacks the power of a true deity, but

he blesses his worshipers with visitations by demons that

communicate his desires. These demons often breed with the

gnolls, producing half- ends that then foster bloodlines of

 endish gnolls. Half- end gnolls usually become leaders of

their tribes, and their  endish gnoll offspring serve beneath

them  as  lieutenants.  Many  half- ends  demand  that  their

children become clerics of Yeenoghu to repay the Demon

Prince and give them access to healing magic.

Fiendish gnoll clerics of Yeenoghu serve as advisors and

bodyguards to a tribes leader rather than as spiritual lead-

ers. The awe gnolls feel for Yeenoghu extends to only those

servants who show themselves to be strong enough to lead.

67

Most  endish clerics of Yeenoghu choose Evil, Destruction,

or  War  as  domains.  Typically  subservient  to  a  tribes  half-

 end, these clerics save their spells to preserve themselves

and their leader.

The  endish gnoll cleric presented here had the following

ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice abil-

ity score increases: Str 13, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 15,

Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

Fiendish gnoll clerics have as much authority as the leader

of  the  tribe  grants  them  at  any  given  moment.  When  in

command of other gnolls, they can be ruthless masters, but

if lacking such authority, they tend to keep to themselves.

Fiendish gnoll clerics never leave their leaders side unless

commanded,  relishing  the  privileges  they  are  granted  as

advisors and fearing the leaders wrath should they not be

present when desired.

In combat, a  endish gnoll cleric relies on others to occupy

foes while she casts spells. Once she has girded herself with

magic, the cleric enters melee to attack with her  ail and

in ict spells. She saves her healing magic for herself and her

leader, and she uses touch of fatigue on a foe already affected

by bane or cause fear.

Yeenoghu often grants half- end gnolls the dark powers of

a warlock. With such obvious blessings, a half- end warlock

rarely faces challenges to her rule, and her occult abilities

often cut such challenges short. Half- end gnolls produce

 endish offspring to buttress their positions of power, and

they use their uncommon wit and charisma to intimidate

and manipulate would-be challengers into allies.

The half- end gnoll warlock presented here had the fol-

lowing ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice

Strategies and Tactics

A  half- end  gnoll  warlock  takes  to  the  air  when  combat

begins, hovering high above while using protective and bol-

stering scrolls on herself. When ready, she remains aloft to

shoot foes with her eldritch blast, relying on her resistances,

damage reduction, and entropic warding to protect her from

enemy  spells  and  ranged  attacks.  She  uses  unholy  blight

against a group of wounded foes, and if necessary, uses dark-

ness to cover her escape.

Beware the gnolls, for they are a demons pawns. Let

them not breed in numbers, for they will make a

wasteland of their lands and yours. Shun them, for they

are harbingers of death.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Gnolls can make challenging encounters for characters of

varying levels.

Slavers (EL 6): A gnoll slave-taker, two ordinary gnolls

(MM 130), and four hyenas wander the edge of the woods

in search of humanoids to eat and take as slaves. The hyenas

charge any likely targets at  rst sight while the gnolls remain

behind to  re arrows. The slave-taker follows the hyenas into

melee. Once any spellcasters and archers are netted, he calls

the two gnolls to join the melee.

Raiding Party (EL 9): A  endish gnoll cleric commands

three gnoll slave-takers, eight ordinary gnolls, and four hy-

L

enas.  Their  mission  is  to  burn  a  nearby  settlement  to  the

ground and kill or enslave its people. The slave-takers move

in advance of the raiders, hoping to hide in the settlement

and identify the most potent defenders before attacking. The

gnolls carry torches to set  re to buildings while the hyenas

attack whatever gets in their way. The  endish cleric hangs

back and casts spells.

Tribal  Leadership  (EL  12):  A

half- end gnoll warlock has pleased

Yeenoghu  enough  that  the

Demon Prince of Gnolls has

sent the half- ends demonic

father to help defend her in

her  hour  of  need.  When

adventurers   ght  their

way  to  the  heart  of  the

gnolls lair, they  nd the

half- end gnoll warlock, four

 endish gnoll clerics, and a

hezrou (MM 44) waiting for

them. The hezrou imme-

diately  summons  more

tanarri  and  then  uses

its spell-like abilities. The

gnolls give the demon a wide

berth  to  avoid  its  stench.

All four clerics charge into

melee,  but  when  the  hez-

rou  nally enters combat,

they  retreat  to  cast  their

own  spells.  The  warlock

 ies high above and attacks

with her eldritch blast, descending

only to receive healing.

ECOLOGY

Gnolls  eat  only  meat,  prefer-

ably  uncooked.  They  hunt  and

raid  under  cover  of  darkness

and  sleep  through  much

of  the  day.  They  take  spe-

cial delight in tormenting

and devouring intelligent

beings.

A  gnolls  life  span  is

around forty years, though an

individual that reaches such

an advanced age is a remark-

able specimen. Most gnolls

die  in  their  twenties  while

in battle or from the rigors of a

primitive life.

A  female  gnoll  gives  birth

to  two  to  four  pups  about  six

months  after  conception.  The

pups are nearly helpless for eight

weeks, doing little besides suck-

ling  and  sleeping.  A  warrior

gnoll hands off the pups imme-

diately after birth and returns to

her normal activities without an-

other thought. The young grow up in crches, left in the care

of wet nurses and slaves until they can fend for themselves. Af-

ter the  rst two months, a young gnoll begins to grow rapidly

and develop impressive muscle mass. It begins to eat meat at

this time. Weaned pups move to a different cave where they

practice hunting skills and observe the behavior of adults.

It is not safe for them to enter the main

body of the tribe until they reach adult

sizea pup that gets underfoot makes

as  good  a  meal  as  anything  else.

Gnolls  reach  adolescence  in  two

years, when they enter the rest of

the tribe and begin to hunt and

make war on their own.

A gnoll tribe rarely cre-

ates its own dwelling but

moves into a cave, ruined

building,  or  dungeon  that  has

been  abandoned  by  previous

denizens. Sometimes another

occupant inhabits the place,

and if it is weak or they out-

number it, the gnolls kill it or

drive it out. Occasionally the

tribe makes an arrangement to

coexist with a powerful in-

habitant, but more often the

gnolls simply look for an-

other suitable home.

Once  a  tribe  has

claimed an area, the dom-

inant  female  chooses  the

roomiest, most desirable quarters

for herself. The leader then marks

her territory, not with musk

as  an  animal  does,  but

with a clan sigil drawn

in blood. The donor

is  the  nearest  lesser

tribe member, whose

neck  the  leader  bites

in  a  demonstration

of  authority.  She  then

designates  areas  for  child-

rearing and marks them in

the  same  way.  After  this,

the  other  gnolls  compete

among  themselves  for  liv-

ing space. Scraps of fur or

leather  sometimes  mark

the  den  of  a  moderately

high-ranking member.

Environment:  Gnolls

live on warm plains, prefer-

ring  lightly  wooded  hills

that  border  grasslands.

They  often  encroach  on

forests, mainly for hunting,

which  brings  them  into

con ict with elves.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An adult male gnoll

is about 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. Females tend to

be larger, about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds.

Gnolls strongly resemble hyenas, with very powerful jaws

and upper bodies. Their brown fur bears spots and streaks,

and a bristly mane runs down the back of the head and shoul-

ders.

Alignment: The brutal and competitive nature of their

society, as well as their demonic patron, tends to make gnolls

chaotic evil in outlook. Some are neutral evil, but a gnoll with

a good or lawful outlook is unheard-of.

SOCIETY

Other beings generally view gnolls as vicious, brutish, and

 lthywhich they are. But they are not stupid, nor are they

as simple as many assume. To underestimate them as enemies

is to fall to their cunning strategies. The smartest gnoll lead-

ers actually play up this reputation so as to lull opponents

into false con dence. Only then do the gnolls strikewith

devastating effect.

Like hyenas, gnolls have a matriarchal society. The females

grow larger and stronger than males, and the alpha female is

the absolute ruler of a tribe for as long as she can defend her

rank. She takes for a mate the  ttest specimen of the tribe,

but they form no lasting relationship. Below the alpha, the

other gnolls sort themselves according to the simple rule of

might, but the leader of the tribe can elevate or demote any

tribe member, regardless of status. The most aggressive males

can sometimes hold high rank within the tribe, although

they  must  endure  challenges  much  more  frequently  than

females. Gnolls with the least status, and the old, are relegated

This creature is a gnoll, a savage humanoid with

features of a hyena. This result reveals all

humanoid traits, including darkvision.

Gnoll society is based on strength and

intimidation. The biggest and strongest lead the

others, and a female typically leads a tribe.

in combat, but they sometimes succumb to their

Gnolls revere the phases of the moon but have few

clerics.

Yeenoghu, the patron god of gnolls, is actually a

demon lord. The phases of the moon have a

strange relationship with the worship of Yeenoghu.

Gnolls are most prone to violence and raiding

during the nights of a new moon.

descendants of a half-fiend leader.

to menial positions within the tribeespecially child-rear-

ing. Yet even these humble individuals far outrank slaves,

who  must  endure  constant  malnourishment  and  regular

beatings. Gnolls use slaves for cleaning and mending, and

for hard labor such as digging or felling trees.

The gnolls worship of Yeenoghu is closely tied with the

phases of the moon and their matriarchal society. Yeenoghu

represents  the  ultimate  mate  for  female  gnolls.  The  new

moon  is  a  time  for  great  sacri ces  to  the  Demon  Prince,

and gnolls increase their attacks during these times to take

as  many  captives  as  possible.  The  gnolls  bring  captured

humanoids to a special cave that represents Yeenoghus den.

There, brown-robed and blood-soaked acolytes slaughter the

captives while the tribes leader and her attendant clerics

howl for Yeenoghus favor. A gnoll leader fervently desires

Yeenoghus personal appearance, but the best she can realis-

tically hope for is for him to send a demon. If the tribe lacks

a half- end leader, or has a weak leader, this demon likely

takes command of the tribe and mates with several gnolls

to produce half- ends that will one day rule in its place.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Gnolls have standard treasure for NPCs of their Challenge

Rating. They favor armor and weapons, but clerics and war-

locks also use scrolls and potions.

GNOLLS AS CHARACTERS

See page 130 of the Monster Manual for information on gnolls

as characters.

GNOLLS IN EBERRON

The  largest  populations  of  gnolls  in  Khorvaire  roam  the

monstrous realm of Droaam. They form sizable communities

throughout that land and refer to themselves overall as a broth-

erhood.  However,  they  form  the  backbone  of  all  the  other

armies  in  competition  for  resources  and  power  in  Droaam.

The clever gnolls have  gured out that this keeps them on the

winning side regardless of the  nal outcome, but they have also

created a kind of stability. They dont care whom they work for,

and they dont attack other gnolls. As a result, a rough balance

of power exists between the various factions in Droaam.

Many gnolls of Eberron are followers of the Devourer, the

Shadow, or the Traveler. A few follow dark druidic traditions.

Some do revere Yeenoghu as one of the Lords of Dust, espe-

cially the  endish clerics, but most of these gnolls inhabit

the Labyrinth in the Demon Wastes.

GNOLLS IN FAERN

North  of  the  Moonsea,  the  Great  Gray  Land  of  Thar  gives

way to the open steppe known as the Ride and the Tortured

Land. The Tortured Land holds the ruins of a forgotten city

surrounded by countless tribes of  ind-led gnolls. Frozen Flin-

dyke, as it is known to bards, might have once been the center

of a  ind-ruled civlization, or it might have been a bastion of

humanity amid a sea of canine humanoids. The gnolls and

 inds of the Tortured Land are led by shamans of Yeenoghu,

whose predecessors supposedly summoned the Trio Nefari-

ous that laid Myth Drannor low, and they skirmish constantly

with each other and the human barbarian tribes of the Ride.

Bands of nomadic gnoll hunters also wander the Shaar,

hunting the large herds of herbivores that wander the grass-

lands.  Most  of  the  southern  gnoll  tribes  have  traditional

homes throughout the hills and lower mountain slopes of

every range across the Shaar, including the Dun Hills, the

Uthangol Mountains, and the Wyrmbones. They are most

common in the western half of the Shaar, especially along

the various ridges north of the Channath Vale. Gnolls have

historically  preyed  upon  settlements  along  the  shores  of

Lake  Lhespen  and  the  caravans  that  move  through  that

region.  Because  of  this,  the  Lapaliiyans  to  the  southwest

have mounted major drives to eradicate them several times

in the past.

SAMPLE LAIR: THE GREAT GEODE

An  enormous  bubble  formed  long  ago  within  a  range  of

ancient hills, possibly the result of an intrusion from the Ele-

mental Plane of Earth. The hollow is completely encrusted

with amethysts, of little value but breathtakingly beautiful.

A recent earthquake cracked the rock over this formation,

diverting  a  surface  stream  into  the  hollow  so  that  it  now

 ows out through a  ssure in the hillside. A gnoll tribe has

taken over this area.

1. Entrance (EL 6): Four gnoll guards (three  ghter 2, one

 ghter 4) are always on duty, two just inside the entrance and

one in the brush on each side of the stream. They are armed

with battleaxes and light crossbows.

2. The Pool: This immense chamber forms the living area

for  low-ranking  tribe  members.  Kobold  slaves  have  been

digging up gems, starting with those on the  oor. Heaps of

waste stone form low walls that partially divide the cavern

into smaller areas.

3. Sleeping Area: Eighty-seven unclassed gnolls inhabit

this large, unfurnished section of the cavern; during the day,

two-thirds of them sleep here while a few patrol the region

or prepare food.

4. Crche:  Currently sixty-two infants and young pups

stay here under the care of low-ranking and old females (see

area 5).

5. Nurses: Sixteen noncombatant female gnolls care for

the tribes young.

6. Slave Pen: High heaps of mined-out rock extend natu-

ral ridges in the walls to build up a prison area for the tribes

slaves. Thirty kobolds are penned here when they are not

working, and two gnolls watch them. Twelve gnolls guard

the kobolds when they are at work.

7. Common Area: Food preparation, skinning, and eating

take place here. Waste is dumped into the stream where it

exits the pool.

8. Chieftains Quarters (EL 6): The tribes leader, Gnash-

tooth (female gnoll ranger 5/adept 1), has appropriated this

chamber for herself. Behind a private store of food and drink

is a secret exit hatch (Spot DC 22).

9. Elite  Quarters  (EL  6):  The  tribes  highest-ranking

warriors (six  ghter 2, two  ghter 4) bunk in this smaller

cavern. At any given time, four are on guard in area 1 while

the others relax here.

10. Escape  Tunnels:  A  purple  worm  once  tunneled

through the area, leaving wide passages suitable for emer-

gency escape. The tunnel entrance in the main chamber is

covered by a heap of rubble, which a group of gnolls can clear

away in 10 rounds. The secret hatch in Gnashtooths quar-

ters covers another passage for her own use. These tunnels

meander for hundreds of feet and eventually exit through

camou aged openings farther along the hillside.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A fang golem is immune to any

spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance,

except shout or greater shout and any orb of sound spell

(Complete Arcane 116).

Any magical attack against a fang golem that deals

cold damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points

of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of

healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal

hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points,

up to a maximum of twice its full normal hit point total.

These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. A fang

golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that

deal cold damage.

Verdant Surge (Su) Any creature hit by a fang golems melee

attack or spikes ability takes a 2 penalty on saving

throws made to resist the effects of a druid spell or a

spell or ability from a fey creature. This effect lasts for

1 minute.

Spikes (Ex) A fang golem can launch a volley of spikes to a

range of 80 feet with no range increment. All targets must

be within 30 feet of each other. A fang golem can use this

ability up to five times in any 24-hour period.

Death Throes (Ex) When killed, a fang golem explodes in

a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 8d6 points of piercing

damage to everything in the area (Reflex DC 14 half).

The save DC is Constitution-based.

A fang golem is the hideous creation of a twisted druid who

built it to resemble a wild beast, composed entirely of claws,

fangs, and tusks. Such druids often set these constructs to

guard unholy groves, but other creators loose fang golems

upon nearby populations to terrorize them and thus drive

them from untrammeled nature. A number of fang golems

still wander long after their creators deaths, their original

purpose forgotten. Powerful fey occasionally construct these

creatures to provide a physical threat that complements their

own magical abilities.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Fang golems are tenacious in combat and very strong. Being

mindless,  they  do  nothing  without  orders  from  their  cre-

ator. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable

of independent strategy or tactics. Emotionless in combat,

they cannot be provoked or intimidated.

A  fang  golems  creator  can  command  it  if  the  golem  is

within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncom-

manded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the

best of its ability, though if attacked, it responds in kind. The

creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its

actions in his or her absence, even ordering it to obey the

commands of another person (who might in turn place the

golem under someone elses command). Reassuming control

over the golem is as simple as commanding it to obey its cre-

ator alone.

A fang golem usually accompanies its druid or fey con-

trollers.  Without  a  controller,  it  executes  its  last  orders

relentlessly.  Sometimes  an  evil  druid  protects  her  grove

with  several  of  these  horrors,  and  a  party  of  adventurers

might encounter such a druid accompanied by one or two

fang golem bodyguards. The druid launches the constructs

against her enemies and hurls call lightning and  ame strike

spells into the midst of the melee, knowing this magic cannot

harm the golems.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Fang golems must be created and positioned in a location.

Once placed, they do not leave the area unless directed to

do so by their creator.

Fey Guardian (EL 8): Two malicious pixies and a fang

golem shaped something like a bear patrol the woods. The

pixies scout ahead of the golem, endeavoring to surprise any

creatures they encounter. They attack from hiding with their

sleep arrows, then order the golem to charge in and slay the

sleeping creatures  rst. After the battle begins, the pixies use

their sleep arrows on creatures wounded by the golem (and

thus affected by its verdant surge ability).

This is a fang golem, a kind of construct created by

twisted druids to serve as a guardian. This result

reveals all construct traits.

A fang golem can hurl a volley of sharp spikes to

hit multiple targets.

Fang golems are immune to most types of energy

damage and might be found in dangerous

environments. They are somewhat vulnerable to

sonic effects.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A player character with a dark edge might consider a fang

golem guardian. Its price is not beyond the reach of a mid- to

high-level PC. However, most people consider fang golems

to be abominations, which makes social interactions more

dif cult for a party accompanied by such a creation.

Depending on the golems shape, it might serve as a mount.

Since the creature is mindless, the Ride skill is of no use in

controlling it. It can carry loads or a rider only in noncom-

bat  situations.  During  combat,  the  controller  is  better  off

dismounting to let the creature  ght on its own.

Fang Golem Construction

The cost to create a fang golem includes the cost of the physi-

cal body and all the materials and spell components that are

consumed or become a permanent part of

the golem. Creating a golem is essentially

similar  to  creating  any  sort  of  magic

item  (DMG  282).  However,  a

golems  body  includes  costly

material  components  that

require  some  extra  prepara-

tion.  The  golems  creator

can  assemble  the  body  or

hire someone else to do the

job,  but  the  builder  must

have the appropriate skill,

as described below.

Completing

the

golems  creation

drains the indicated

XP from the creator

and  requires  casting

any  spells  on  the   nal

day. The creator must cast the spells

personally,  but  they  can  come  from

outside sources such as scrolls.

A  fang  golems  body  must  be

assembled from fangs, claws, tusks, and the like, with a total

weight of at least 1,000 pounds (more for larger specimens).

These are bound with cords or strips of hide to wood laths,

all treated with preservative oils costing 500 gp. Creating

the body requires a DC 15 Craft (sculpting) or Craft (weav-

ing) check.

The market price of an advanced golem increases by 5,000

gp  for  each  additional  Hit  Die.  Add  an  additional  50,000

gp if the golems size increases. The XP cost for creating an

advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the increased market price

minus the cost of the special materials required.

CL  7th;  Craft  Construct,  greater  magic  fang,  reincarnate,

spike stones, caster must be at least 7th level; Price 15,000 gp;

Cost 8,000 gp + 580 XP.

Fang golem

Bodyguards (EL 10): Arlethin doIrdrin (NE female drow

druid 9), a denizen of the subterranean realms, maintains a

sacred grove of oversized mushrooms, where she and her

circle conduct disturbing rituals. She is accompanied by two

fang golems, crafted to combine the features of subterranean

lizards and enormous spiders. The druid uses several simple

animals as scouts and spies, but these creatures do not join in

the  ght. In any battle, the druid treats the golems and her

animal companion as expendable, seeking only to preserve

her own life.

ECOLOGY

Being constructs, fang golems have no need to eat, sleep, or

breathe. They can exist wherever their creator places them,

be it underwater, in subterranean chambers, or even

hostile environments such as volcanic caverns. They

have no natural prey but attack whatever and when-

ever their instructions direct.

Creating such a golem requires

killing  many  creatures  (or  at

least collecting parts from those

already  dead)  and  then  binding

a  spirit  into  the  assembled

form.  Non-evil  druids  see

the  very  idea  as  an  abomina-

tion,  and  they  try  to

destroy such creations as

well as those responsible

for their existence.

Environment:  As  constructs,

fang  golems  can  be  found  any-

where.  But  as  the  creations  of

druids,  they  usually  share

the  same  environment  as

those  who  created  them.

Such places include stand-

ing  stones  in  haunted

wastelands,  underground

tunnels,  corrupted  forests,

and similar forbidding locales.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A fang golem is the

size of a dire animal, ranging from 8 to 15 feet in length and

weighing up to 2,000 pounds. The example presented here

is about 10 feet long and weighs around 1,000 pounds.

Fang golems can come in many shapes and sizes. Elephant-

sized  specimens  have  been  found  in  remote  places,  and

massive fang golems resembling crabs (often incorporating

pincers and sharks teeth) scuttle on the ocean  oor.

Alignment:  A  fang  golem  is  as  mindless  as  any  other

golem, existing only to carry out orders. It is always  neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Fang golems never have treasure, but their magical bodies

might  be  treasure  in  their  own  right.  Destroying  a  fang

golem  shatters  the  assemblage  of  fangs,  claws,  and  tusks

that  formed,  thus  releasing  the  spirit.  However,  carefully

collecting  the  materials  can  allow  another  creator  to  ani-

mate a similar golem for one-half the normal material cost.

Alternatively, ivory from these components can be sold for

1/20 the golems construction cost.

FANG GOLEMS IN FAERN

In  the  Rawlinswood  of  Faerns  Great  Dale,  the  warped

followers  of  the  Rotting  Man  spread  corruption  through

the vast forests from their stronghold of Dun-Tharos. Black-

hearted treants rove side by side with fang golems, which are

often crafted from the remains of creatures destroyed by the

corrupted ones advance.

HOWLER WASP

Howler wasps are bizarre creatures created by the mighty

wizard Otiluke. Otiluke sought to produce a fusion of insect

and mammal that would guard his tower against a cabal of

slaadi that sought to slay him. The  rst experiments produced

the howler wasps. Otiluke intended to destroy the creatures,

since they attacked friendly visitors as well as his enemies.

Unfortunately, the slaadi attacked soon after he completed

his  rst experiments. In the confusion of the battle, some

of the howler wasps escaped. They and their offspring have

since spread their nests throughout the world.

Hovering in the air, its wings buzzing with a constant low drone,

appears to be a hornet with a baboonlike head. It screeches at

you in fury.

that attacks anything approaching within 10 miles

of its nest. This result reveals all aberration traits.

A howler wasp flies back to its nest to fetch

reinforcements when attacked. A howler wasp

queen is much larger than the others, and she

rarely if ever leaves the nest.

The sting of a howler wasp can paralyze its victim.

Inciting Pheromone (Ex) If a melee attack reduces a howler

wasp to 0 or fewer hit points, or if the wasp takes a

critical hit from a melee attack, it can attempt to douse

its foe with a pheromone (+3 melee touch). The wasp

uses this ability as an immediate action before resolving

the effect of the damage.

The pheromone draws other howler wasps to the

target, inciting them into a fearsome rage. All howler

wasps within 60 feet of a creature doused with the

pheromone gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +2

bonus on damage rolls against the doused creature.

Howler wasps detect the doused creature as if they had

blindsense. The pheromones effects last for 10 minutes,

though a doused creature can wash the substance off by

submerging in water.

The example presented above is a typical worker. It builds

the  nest,  forages  for  food,  and  defends  the  colony  and  its

queen.

The  colonys  queen,  like  that  of  a  mundane  wasp  nest,  is

responsible for laying eggs. Male howler wasps crowd about

her at all times.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Individually, a howler wasp attacks whatever is closest to it.

In groups, though, howler wasps change their tactics as soon

as one of them delivers a spray of inciting pheromone. They

all attack any creature doused with the pheromone.

Wounded howler wasps always  y back to the nest, where

they gather more howler wasps to eliminate the threat. Thus,

it is imperative to defeat every howler wasp encountered or

to be far away by the time reinforcements arrive.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Because howler wasps hunt for food near their homes, they

are frequently encountered within a few miles of their nest.

Howler wasps are fearless and aggressive. They see all other

creatures as either food or threats, and they try to kill any-

thing they  nd edible or menacing.

Individual (EL 1): A single howler wasp is usually on

the prowl for food. It attacks without hesitation,  ying

back to the nest for reinforcements if injured.

Hunting  Group  (EL  24):  Small  groups

of  two  to  four

howler  wasps

drift, seeming-

ly  aimlessly,  at

distances  of  up

to 10 miles from the

nest,  attacking  any  liv-

ing creature.

Raiding  Wing  (EL

58):  A  raiding  wing

comprising  ve to sixteen

howler  wasps  prowls  the

countryside, gathering food

and resources, as well as

defending the nest from

possible attackers.

Nest  (EL  913):  A

nest  can  contain  anywhere

from  seventeen  to  sixty-four

howler wasps, in addition to the

queen.

ECOLOGY

Howler  wasps  build  nests  of

paper,  dried  leaves,  and  skins  of

dead  animals.  Such  nests  range

in complexity from single cham-

bers to multiple consecutive cells,

each of which might hold as many as six howler wasps. The

wasps incorporate items and gear taken from slain opponents

into their nests: Shields, suits of armor, and similar equip-

ment serve as useful framing material. The paper walls of a

howler wasp nest have hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch

of thickness.

A queen sits at the center of a howler wasp nest, produc-

ing  the  colonys  eggs  with  the  aid  of  male  howler  wasps

who swarm around her, never leaving the nest. She and her

consorts protect the eggs until they hatch. The queen lays

anywhere from thirty to sixty eggs each month, each egg

hatching  in  about  a  week.  Because  the  nest  might  not  be

able to support so many new howler wasps, the queen and

the healthiest larvae devour the weakest young ones. The

survivors reach maturity in about three weeks. The average

howler wasp lives for about six months, though the queens

life span might be years.

Female howler wasps that grow to more than 2 Hit Dice

are a threat to the queen, who mercilessly dispatches such

potential rivals. If the queen dies, the other females in the

nest begin to grow freely. They gain 1 extra Hit Die each

week until they reach 8 Hit Dice, at which point they vie to

become the new queen. Usually one female slays all her com-

petitors, but occasionally several females leave to start their

own nests. The single female builds and enters a cocoonlike

structure, there undergoing a biological transformation into

a queen, which takes a week.

Giant wasps and giant spiders present the

most common threats to howler wasp nests.

Apes and dire apes also come into con ict with

howler wasps.

Environment:  Howler  wasps  prefer  for-

ested  environments,  but  they  can

make  their  homes  in  nearly  any

warm  location.  When-

ever possible, they occupy

derelict  buildings.  They

are  especially  fond  of

old  libraries  and  temples,

which contain paper for

building  their  nests.

They  are  rarely  found

underground.

Typical  Physical  Char-

acteristics:  The  average

howler  wasp  measures  less

than  4  feet  long  and  weighs

around 30 pounds. The queen

is around 8 feet long, and she

weighs about 250 pounds.

Physically,  male  and  female

howler wasps are nearly identical.

The only difference is that a male

howler  wasp  dies  1d4+1  rounds

after  delivering  a  sting  attack.

Howler wasps encountered out-

side  the  nest  are  always  female;

about 20% of those encountered

inside the nest are males.

Alignment:  Howler  wasps

hate all other living creatures and

kill them with no provocation, whether the wasps need food

or not. They care for nothing other than killing and their

own survival, and only a howler wasp queen has any hope

of ruling a howler wasp hive without supernatural aid. Thus,

howler wasps are usually chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Howler  wasps  have  no  individual  treasure,  but  they  use

any items they  nd to build their nests. They particularly

love shields and other  at objects that serve as sturdy fram-

ing material, or scrolls as a source of paper. Tearing apart a

nests structure reveals a small bounty of magic items, coins,

and other treasure with a standard value for the Challenge

Rating of the nest.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A typical howler wasp can be summoned by a cleric with

access to the Chaos domain, using summon monster II or a

higher-level  summon  monster  spell.  Treat  the  howler  wasp

as if it were on the 2nd-level list on the Summon Monster

Flame Web (Ex) Inferno spiders can throw a burning web

eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a

net but has a maximum range of 100 feet, with a range

increment of 20 feet, and is effective against targets up

to one size category larger than the inferno spider. The

web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.

Each round, at the end of the inferno spiders turn, an

entangled creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage.

An entangled creature can escape the web with a

successful DC 21 Escape Artist check or burst it with a

DC 25 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-

based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial

bonus. The web has 12 hit points and hardness 5. If any

part of the flame web takes 5 or more points of cold

damage, the flame is extinguished and the web becomes

cold and brittle, reducing the difficulty of the Escape

Artist check to DC 16 and the Strength check to DC 20.

Fire Shield (Su) An inferno spiders body produces

tremendous heat. Any creature that strikes or touches an

inferno spider with its body or a weapon, or that grapples

an inferno spider, automatically takes 1d6 points of fire

damage. A creature takes damage from this ability only

once per turn.

Skills Inferno spiders have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks. An inferno spider can always choose to take 10

on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

Their fangs burning with elemental fury, inferno spiders are

deadly predators. These hunters are often aligned with priests

of   ame  deities  or  groups  of  cunning  salamanders,  using

their abilities to complement those of other  re creatures.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Inferno  spiders  hunt  and  feed  on  creatures  weaker  than

themselves. They use their  ame webs to capture prey that

might otherwise be too quick and nimble. In combat, inferno

spiders  rst attempt to entangle prey with their webs and

then  close  to  bite  with  their  poisonous  fangs.  Possessing

only limited intelligence, inferno spiders remain cunning

and tenacious hunters, using Spring Attack to dart in and

out of combat.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Inferno spiders can be found in the company of  re elemen-

tals, salamanders, and clerics of  re deities. The spiders are

intelligent enough to follow simple orders and to realize the

bene ts of allying with stronger creatures.

Temple  Guardians  (EL  13):  Inside  a  remote  volcano,

Kaerlak, a pyromaniacal 10th-level cleric of Obad-Hai, has

cowed two inferno spiders into guarding his temple. Kaer-

lak found the spiders in the volcanic chambers beneath the

temple, along with a group of four average salamanders. The

inferno spiders freely stalk the passages of the  re temple,

and  Kaerlak  and  the  salamanders  have  resolved  to  draw

more  re creatures to the site. While Kaerlak and his min-

ions arent wantonly destructive, their  ery travels through

nearby  woodlands  and  their  stoking  of  the  volcanos   res

have drawn the attention of a small group of druids who are

devoted to Ehlonna. These druids now seek help to protect

their forest from the threat of Kaerlaks temple.

ECOLOGY

Voracious  predators,  even  among  others  of  their  kind,

inferno spiders lead solitary lives on the Elemental Plane of

Fire. The weaker denizens of that plane universally loathe

them, and inferno spiders avoid contact with others of their

kind as well.

valuable items quickly.

FOR PLAYER

CHARACTERS

An  inferno  spider  can  be

summoned by a wizard, by a sor-

cerer, or by a cleric with access to the

Fire domain, using summon monster

VI or a higher-level summon mon-

the Fire domain can also use a greater

planar ally spell to call an inferno spider,

which usually demands ample food as payment.

To  accomplish  any  of  these  tasks,  a  spellcaster

must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (the planes).

days of intense study.

Once in the life of an inferno spider, typically when it has

become advanced in size as well as years, the creature seeks a

mate. Two courting inferno spiders fall into a strange, ritualis-

tic dance, during which they circle each other for hours or, in

some cases, days. At the end of the ritual, the two inferno spi-

ders charge one another, whereupon they collide and explode,

giving birth to hundreds of young. Enemies and predators of

inferno spiders often hide near the dancing mates, waiting to

slay as many of the offspring as possible. The young also attack

one another. Very few inferno spiders survive to become large

enough to hunt prey other than their siblings.

Inferno spiders are attracted to individuals who possess

great  arcane  or  divine  power,   nding  service  with  those

knowledgeable enough to summon and command them.

Environment: Inferno spiders inhabit any warm region

of the Material Plane, as well as the Elemental Plane of Fire.

They  are  occasionally  called  to  service  by  powerful  spell-

casters on other planes of existence, particularly by those

who serve or revere  re deities.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Inferno spiders stand

approximately 4 feet tall and have a diameter of 8 feet. Com-

posed  mostly  of  magma  and   ame,  an  inferno  spider  can

weigh as much as 600 pounds. Transparent plates reveal a

INFERNO SPIDERS IN EBERRON

Inferno  spiders  come  from  Fernia,  the  Sea  of  Fire.  There,

they  skip  across  the  surface  of  the  molten  landscape  like

gigantic water striders, hunting, eating, and mating as they

continue the endless cycle of life. Sometimes the creatures

shift  to  Eberron  when  Fernia  is  coterminous,  and  there

they set up lairs in volcanic caverns. A gigantic specimen is

rumored to nest in the crater of Hakatorvhaks peak, miles

below the  endish city.

INFERNO SPIDERS IN FAERN

Inferno spiders live on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The vast

majority of these creatures are servants of Kossuth, the Lord

of Flames, whom they revere. The deity appears to them as

an enormous inferno spider of great age and strength. The

zealots of the Burning Braziers faction seek to introduce

inferno spiders to Toril in their quest to cleanse the world.

So far, the Firelord has allowed only limited summoning.

Whether the distant and unknowable deity has some other

plan  in  mind  for  the  creatures,  or  simply  does  not  care,

none can say.

Sense Emotions (Su) This ability functions like blindsense,

except that a joystealer can detect only the presence and

positions of living creatures.

Drain Emotions (Su) Once a joystealer has reduced a living

creature to 0 Charisma, it can drain emotion completely

from that opponent as a standard action. A creature so

drained cant be affected by morale bonuses or penalties,

cant rage, and cant receive the benefits of any other

ability derived through inspiration or emotion. The

affected creature is also immune to fear effects.

The drain emotions effect can be countered only by

finding and destroying the joystealer who caused it or

by casting a remove curse spell on the afflicted creature

within the area of a hallow spell.

Skills Joystealers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Beautiful, haunting, and cruel beyond mortal ken, joysteal-

ers hunt passion, feed on fear, and revel in the emotions that

they steal from others. Once they labored in servitude for

ethereal masters, but now they haunt the streets of cities or

stride through forests at the side of other fey creatures.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Individual joystealers seduce mortals with words and deeds,

often  trying  to  incite  love  or  happiness,  which  they   nd

tasty with a touch of surprise and fear. If forced to  ght for

its sustenance, a joystealer remains in a combat only long

enough to reduce one living creature to 0 Charisma. Then

it uses its drain emotions ability,  eeing thereafter to digest

the passions it has stolen.

A  group  of  joystealers  begins  an  attack  from  ambush,

hiding partially within solid objects. Though they are not

invisible, these incorporeal creatures enjoy an excellent racial

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Joystealers often work in teams to feed ef ciently. Such gangs

consume whatever strong emotions are availablefear being

a common one, especially as the joystealers continue to feed.

Joystealers sometimes join with other cruel fey, who use their

abilities to incapacitate victims that the joystealers then drain

of Charisma and emotion. They leave behind hopeless husks

that often just give up on living.

Individual (EL 5): Lone joystealers are threats in urban

environments or in other places where strong emotions are

plentiful,  such  as  battle elds.  Occasionally,  a  single  joy-

stealer might be exploring new feeding grounds or be the

sole survivor of a larger group.

Dark Pranksters (EL 8): A spiteful pixie enjoys punish-

ing  mortals  who  encroach  on  its  territory,  using  its  sleep

arrows or Ottos irresistible dance and then allowing its two

companion joystealers to drain the victims emotions.

ECOLOGY

Joystealers lead a strange dual existence. They are bound to

the  Ethereal  Plane  but  always  hunger  for  the  emotions  of

creatures from the material world.

The ancestors of joystealers were unseelie fey that fed on

the emotions of ordinary mortals. When the ethergaunts, or

khen-zai as they call themselves (Fiend Folio 64), decided to

reclaim the Material Plane, they sought slaves that would be

useful to their cause of emotional puri cation and physical

eradication. The joystealers were a perfect tool, being mate-

rial  beings  that  destroyed  the  emotions  of  other  material

beings. The black ethergaunts began to amass large armies of

joystealers, whose abilities had no effect on their own per-

fected minds. The fey had never been especially numerous,

so it wasnt long before all of them had been taken by

the khen-zai. Through magical manipulation and

long-term  habituation  to  ethereal  existence,

the  joystealers  became  insubstantial,  partly

fastened to the Ethereal Plane.

Joystealers have been bound to the Ethe-

real Plane for millennia, almost beyond

the realm of mortal memory or record.

However, they hunger still for the feel-

ings and passions of the mortal world.

Under the subjugation of the ether-

gaunts,  joystealers  have  become

cruel  and  evil  to  the  extreme.

Even after escaping ethergaunt

rule, they retain their vicious-

ness, willing to drain a mortal

of  emotion  eternally  for  a

moments revel in the joys of

the stolen passion.

Like  all  fey,  joystealers  are

long-lived and mature slowly.

Environment:  Joystealers

are  inextricably  bound  to  the

Ethereal  Plane  now,  but  they

were  urban  fey  before  their

enslavement.  They  are  most

likely to be encountered within

large cities, where plenty of emo-

tion  is  expressed  in  the  daily  lives

of  residents.  Most  joystealers  restrict

themselves to consuming the emotional energy of societys

forgotten, unless in desperate straits, to avoid drawing atten-

tion to themselves. Slums and waterfronts are their preferred

haunts. The presence of other creatures also helps the joyste-

alers conceal themselves from pursuers once they have fed.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A joystealer is a deli-

cate being that resembles an extremely pale elf with long  hair

and androgynous features. It is coldly attractive by human-

oid  standards,  but  its  eyes  immediately  give  away  its  true

nature. They resemble gems, luminous and without pupils.

A joystealers eyes are deep ruby red when the creature is

hungry but glow golden once it has fed. A typical joystealer

stands about 5 feet tall and has a slight form.

Alignment:  Joystealers  are  concerned  only  with  their

own well-being, without regard for how their behavior affects

others. By that standard, they would have been considered

evil even before their transformation. Now their resentment

and despair has further darkened their souls. Joystealers are

usually neutral evil.

Joystealer

SOCIETY

Joystealers is a name conferred on the creatures by fright-

ened survivors of their attacks. They call themselves insoril.

Insoril  are  extremely  unusual  fey  in  that  they  adapted  to

urban environments. When humans spread into the untamed

lands, many fey retreated before them. The insoril lingered,

for humans were a rich and plentiful source of intense emo-

tionsfar tastier and easier to harvest than those of other

fey, elves, and the like. If several insoril previously dwelt by

a riverside, they remained in the wharves and alleyways of

a river city. If they once inhabited a wood, they haunted the

parks and back streets of a growing town.

The insoril saw themselves as a neces-

sary  part  of  the  world,  draining

excess  emotions  that  would

only  lead  to  con ict  or  pain.

Indeed,  they  were  proud  of

their role. They saw their feed-

ing  as  being  on  a  higher  level

than the bloodstained hunt or the

hard labor of farming. After being

enslaved  by  the  ethergaunts,  the

insoril were put to work as mere

hunters,  and  they  resented  such

debasement.  But  escape  has  not

freed  them,  and  their  feeding  is

now a desperate scramble instead of

the  re ned  culling  they  once  took

pride in. They hate the ethergaunts

for poisoning their purity so. As far

as  other  intelligent  creatures  are

concerned, though, joystealers are

as sel sh and terrible as ever.

TYPICAL

TREASURE

During their enslavement, joyste-

alers  possessed  nothing  of  their

own,  and  being  incorporeal,  they

have no material treasure.

JOYSTEALERS WITH CLASS LEVELS

NPC joystealers advance by character class, most as rogues.

A few become spellcasters, though material components are

a problem for incorporeal creatures. The rare joystealer cleric

usually follows Nerull or Wee Jas.

Level Adjustment: +4.

JOYSTEALERS IN EBERRON

The  ethergaunts  served  the  daelkyr,  their  creators,  nearly

ten thousand years ago, while the inhabitants of Xoriat ran

free on Khorvaire. When the gates to Xoriat were closed, the

ethergaunts took refuge on the Ethereal Plane. After the fall

of the Dhakaani civilization, humans began to move into the

goblinoid lands. The joystealers stayed to feed. Ethergaunts

observed them and began to collect them as slaves.

During the Last War, the battlegrounds of Cyre provided an

excellent base for the ethergaunts. Amid the wartime horrors,

tales of creatures that drained the very heart did not stand out

much. Only the passion of an army of Thrane zealots allowed

the joystealers to make their escape. Now many of the fugi-

tives linger in the Mournland, hiding in the dead-gray mist.

Travelers never suspect that insubstantial creatures within the

mist might be responsible for their spiritual deadening.

JUSTICE ARCHON

Archons are celestials from the plane of Celestia. They guard

that plane and all who are good or innocent,  ghting  ends

wherever  they   nd  such  creatures.  Although  glorious  to

behold and created from the essence of good, archons are

terrifying enemies of any they see as evil.

A glorious but menacing angel dives toward you. She is a radi-

ant warrior clad in bright full plate, wielding a greatsword that

crackles with divine power.

Justice archons consider themselves the purest champions

of  justice  in  Celestia.  Decisive  and  self-righteous,  their

desire  to  act  swiftly  on  behalf  of  justice  sometimes  leads

them astray.

Strategies and Tactics

A justice archon does not attack without provocation, but its

highly tuned sense of justice and retribution often causes

it to become incensed at the mere sight of an evil being or

even the suspicion of an evil act. If it is unsure of who was

responsible for the wrongdoing, a justice archon uses its detect

est opponent with its greatsword. It uses the weapons normal

damage  until  it  can  discover  the  nature  of  its  opponents

melee attack (generally as a result of being hit), then uses its

justice strike if that is more effective. If the opponent pro-

vides a serious challenge, the justice archon teleports away

to bring reinforcements or to strike again when it has some

other advantage.

Dex 12, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 13.

Strategies and Tactics

When  a  justice  archon  champion  decides  violence  is  jus-

ti ed,  it  makes  sure  of  its  overwhelming  superiority.  In

addition to casting aid on itself, it casts  divine favor before

joining battle.

A justice archon champion usually leads a large group of

other archons, generally six to eight justice archons, several

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Justice  archons  often   ght  alone,  but  they  frequently

accompany other champions of good. They provide aerial

support  to  squads  of  hound  archons  or  answer  magical

summons  to  aid  clerics  of  lawful  good  deities.  Celestial

giant  eagles  or  celestial  giant  owls  regularly  accompany

justice archons.

Fallen Angel (EL 8): The justice archon Hanzuriel always

deals swift judgment and harsh justice to wrongdoers. Over

the years, his impetuous decisions have slowly but steadily

drawn him off the path of righteousness. Admonished by

superiors and accused of falling from grace, Hanzuriel  ed

the heavens, convinced of his moral superiority over hand-

wringing layabouts that hide in Celestia while evil does its

foul  works.  Now  unwittingly  lawful  neutral,  Hanzuriel

travels  the  Material  Plane  with  two  like-minded  hound

archons, judging crimes and punishing criminals at will.

Hanzuriels hound archon allies impersonate mortals to root

out the malefactors in a community. When they  nd some-

one they think has broken a law (by their sense of what is

lawful), they report to Hanzuriel, and he and they return to

destroy the individual.

ECOLOGY

As an outsider, a justice archon does not need to eat, drink,

or sleep. A justice archon does not contribute to the ecol-

ogy of an area, and an archon avoids taking any action that

might alter an areas natural balance, unless pursuit of justice

requires doing so.

Environment:  Justice  archons  are  native  to  the  Seven

Mounting Heavens of Celestia. They inhabit Empyrea, the

City  of  Tempered  Souls,  on  Celestias   fth  layer  Mertion,

where re ections of their golden wings  ash in its crystal-

clear waters.

A  few  justice  archons  choose  voluntary  exile  from  the

shining realm of Celestia. These champions remain on the

Material Plane to maintain eternal watch on infernal portals

that border the Lower Planes, guarding against incursions

by  ends.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  typical  justice

archon stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds. It

looks like a beautiful humanoid, usually an elf or human,

with gleaming golden eyes, skin, and hair. Justice archons

favor  full  plate  armor  and  two-handed  weapons,  usually

greatswords but occasionally greataxes or glaives.

Justice archons have no gender, though one might resem-

ble a male or female humanoid.

Alignment:  Natives  of  Celestia,  justice  archons  always

begin existence lawful good. When in the throes of righteous

fury, though, they might lash out at all who oppose them,

and doing this too often can lead a justice archon to change

alignment.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A  justice  archon  has  standard  treasure  for  its  Challenge

Rating, mostly in the form of magic weapons and armor. It

also might wear protective items and use potions to improve

its combat abilities. Remaining possessions usually serve to

enhance  the  archons  glorious  and  imposing  appearance.

Justice archons favor golden necklaces, torcs, circlets, and

other such jewelry, as well as gold enhancements to armor

and clothing.

JUSTICE ARCHONS WITH

CLASS LEVELS

The  abilities  of  the  paladin  class  mesh  well  with  justice

archons natural desire to combat evil. Their innate spell-like

abilities do not increase in caster level with the addition of

paladin levels, but their spell resistance does increase.

Level Adjustment: +5.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A justice archon can be summoned using summon monster

VII or a higher-level summon monster spell. Treat the justice

archon  as  if  it  were  on  the  7th-level  list  on  the  Summon

Monster table (PH 287).

When a justice archon is called by one of the planar ally

spells, it demands only half the usual payment if asked to

 ght  ends, and no payment if yugoloths are the enemy. A

justice archon might continue to  ght remaining yugoloths,

even if it has accomplished the letter of a bargain struck with

its caller.

JUSTICE ARCHONS IN EBERRON

Justice  archons  are  vanguard  commanders  in  the  eternal

battles  that  rage  across  the  plane  of  Shavarath.  Yugoloths

do not dwell there, though, being denizens of Mabar. The

 endish armies sometimes summon yugoloths, which brings

justice archons in swarms. Justice archons might enter Eber-

ron when Mabar is coterminous and yugoloths emerge to

plague mortals.

JUSTICE ARCHONS IN FAERN

Justice archons are native to the House of the Triad, home

to deities of justice and righteous warfare, including Helm,

Torm, and Tyr. They are especially hostile to denizens of the

Barrens of Doom and Despair, servants of deities who delight

in in icting random pain and misery.

SOCIETY

Justice archons outshine other archons in zealous devotion

to  what  is  good  and  right.  They  willingly  bring  succor  to

the injured and the abused, but their passion lies more in

exacting retribution against those responsible for such mis-

treatment. Justice archons are at the forefront of war parties

that hunt down  ends, and they frequently come to the aid

of clerics who pray for assistance against evil. They harbor a

special enmity toward yugoloths. They despise beings that

do not cleave to a philosophy but exist only to cause as much

misery as possible.

If justice archons have a weakness, it is that their lust for

vengeance can cloud their sense of right and wrong. High

priests  with  ambitions  toward  great  temporal  power  have

exploited this tendency by directing the archons fury against

evil  rulers.  Should  a  justice  archon  learn  it  has  been  so

manipulated, though, its revenge against the true villain is

swift, violent, and horrifying. In its fury, it might destroy all

who surround the object of vengeance, whether they share

guilt or not.

Justice archons consider themselves the purest champions

of justice in Celestia. Throne archons (Book of Exalted Deeds

162) are the judges of the heavens, but their cold deliberation

and resentment of being called to the Material Plane make

them too distant in the eyes of the justice archons. The sum-

mons to defeat evil and injustice, wherever it might be found,

is too loud to ignore, and justice archons eagerly answer.

Cooler-headed celestials recognize the usefulness of such

zealotry, but many believe the justice archons are too easily

arousedand  thus  too  prone  to  act  rashly  and  harm  the

blameless who get between them and their prey. These other

celestials encourage justice archons to engage in raids against

the Lower Planes, in which no innocents are at risk.

16

This is a justice archon, a zealous native of

Celestia. Such archons frequently lead squads of

other archons or earthly champions of good

against evil enemies of great power. This result

reveals all outsider and archon traits.

Justice archons can strike an enemy for the

damage it deals, including additional damage from

energy or poison. They are resistant to magic and

ignore some of the damage dealt by non-evil

weapons.

Justice archons hate yugoloths. A justice archon

that answers a planar ally spell usually agrees to

fight yugoloths for no payment. However, justice

archons can be impetuous in their pursuit of

justice, and they are quick to judge.

LIZARDFOLK,

DARK TALON TRIBE

As detailed in the Monster Manual, lizardfolk are primitive

reptilian humanoids that lurk in swampy places. Most lizard-

folk tend toward neutrality, but the example tribe described

here is an exception. Encounters with the Dark Talon lizard-

folk can form the basis of an adventure path.

The Dark Talons are murderous lizardfolk, toughened by

alchemical infusion with black dragon blood, that seek to

conquer lands controlled by other humanoid races. Spurred

on by their mad king, Yarshag, and fanatical druids, the Dark

Talons march from their swamp on a sinister crusade.

Strategies and Tactics

Wasp riders are the  rst wave of a Dark Talon attack. These

warriors soften up the enemy with a few volleys before the

main  army  engages.  Once  the  warband  meets  the  enemy,

the wasp riders patrol the air to guard against the enemys

reinforcements, hunt down foes that  ee, and pick off any

targets of opportunity.

Animal Companion monitor lizard (MM 275)

The typical Dark Talon shaman is ambitious, intelligent, and

charismatic.  These  lizardfolk  see  Yarshag  as  a  near-divine

being whose dictates must be obeyed. They view nature as a

destructive force that exists to serve the lizardfolk, and they

are responsible for capturing and training monsters, leading

warbands, and policing the tribe for heresy. They  ght along-

side the tribes soldiers, though they prefer to use their spells

to support assaults, wading into melee only if forced to.

The Dark Talon shaman presented here had the follow-

ing  ability  scores  before  racial  adjustments  and  Hit  Dice

ability score increases: Str 8, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 15,

Cha 12.

Strategies and Tactics

A typical Dark Talon warband includes a shaman, who uses

spells such as fog cloud to cover the troops. Call lightning is

useful against  ying enemies and targets that are too tough

for  the  soldiers  to  take  down  quickly.  The  shaman  keeps

obscuring  mist  and  entangle  in  reserve  to  cover  a  retreat  or

befuddle a potent foe. Other spells augment the shamans

combat potency.

YARSHAG, DARK TALON KING

The king of the Dark Talons stands before you in shining plate

made  of  onyx-colored  dragon  scales.  His  form  seems  large  in

The shield on his arm is like glistening ebony,

and even his curved sword is a lustrous black.

A would-be  ghter who found his place as a tribal druid, Yar-

shag looks the part of the lizardfolk warlord he has always

wanted to be. He wears the skin of the black dragon that once

oppressed his tribe, and he always surrounds himself with

able-bodied defenders. Not one to lead an attack from the

front rank, Yarshag supports his troops from a safe position

where he can observe and cast spells. When a battle is won,

he ceremoniously rides his vermin companion in to claim

the credit and the best spoils.

Yarshag  had  the  following  ability  scores  before  racial

adjustments, Hit Dice ability score increases, and equipment

bonuses: Str 8, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 14.

Strategies and Tactics

Yarshag is never alone. His personal retinue includes two

fang golems (see page 72), a shambling mound (under a com-

mand plants spell), half a dozen Dark Talon champions, two

Dark Talon shamans, and his beetle companion.

When Yarshag  ghts, he relies on his spells. Sel sh to the

core, he uses every augmenting spell he has on himself and

his companion if he has time. In the  rst round of combat, he

has his fang golems engage the enemy and casts ice storm on

the ensuing melee. He then casts call lightning, so he always

has the option of lashing out with a lightning bolt during his

turn. If he needs to, he uses wind wall to fend off accurate

ranged attacks.

To  insure  his  attackers  have  little  chance  to  get  to  him

quickly  without  magical  aid,  Yarshag  casts  animal  growth

as soon as he can on the monitor lizards that serve the two

Dark Talon shamans. The Dark Talon king follows that up

with a giant vermin spell cast on three spiders he carries in

a ceramic  ask. Later in the battle, he might spontaneously

cast summon natures ally to conjure reptiles or elementals,

further stymieing direct assaults.

Should the clash take a turn for the worst, Yarshag casts

entangle followed by fog cloud. He uses fog cloud immediately

if a melee combatant directly attacks him. He then takes the

form of a giant wasp for added mobility and an easy method

of escape, using Blind-Fight (or faerie  re) to get the better

of his assailant. If forced into direct melee, Yarshag uses his

scimitar (with poison) or his claws. He casts poison on one

of  his  attackers  if  he  can  afford  the  risk.  He  still  uses  fog

cloud and his giant wasp vermin form when the going gets

rough.

If defeat seems imminent, Yarshag expects his followers to

 ght to the deathhe gladly sacri ces them for his survival.

The king of the Dark Talons would rather die than actually

surrender, but he might feign capitulation to buy himself

time. In any case, the form of a Tiny vermin provides an easy

opportunity for a timely getaway.

Other Creatures and Allies

In addition to the tactics discussed earlier, a Dark Talon army

marches into battle with a number of monstrous allies. Sham-

bling mounds use their mighty tendrils to rip apart a towns

forti cations.  Stirges  swarm  over  the  battle eld,  descend-

ing upon enemy soldiers moments before the Dark Talons

army attacks. Ankhegs burrow tunnels under walls, creating

breaches for Dark Talon soldiers, and attack enemy troops

from underneath or behind. The appearance of lizardfolk

riding giant wasps and a bank of fog is often the beginning

of the end for the Dark Talons foes, most of whom expect a

simple, direct attack.

Ankhegs (MM 14): The Dark Talons managed to capture

several clutches of ankheg eggs. Now these beasts serve as

tunnelers (for sieges and home building) and guardians.

Assassin Vines (MM 20): The tribes druids plant these

creatures along unused paths and in out-of-the-way places

near Dark Talon settlements.

Blackscale  Lizardfolk  (MM  III  95):  These  towering

brutes are among the most fanatical members of the Dark

Talon tribe.

Fang Golems (page 72): Yarshag has imparted the tech-

niques for making these creatures to his subordinates. A few

of  the  most  potent  Dark  Talon  shamanss  have  made  fang

golems for themselves.

Giant and Monstrous Vermin (MM 285): Dark Talon

druids include a number of vermin keepers, who train giant

wasps to accept riders and other monstrous vermin to serve

as war beasts.

Lizardfolk (MM 169): Many of the tribes combatants are

normal lizardfolk.

Poison Dusk Lizardfolk (MM III 96): The Dark Talons

include several clans of these lizardfolk. They serve as scouts

and weaponsmiths.

Shambling  Mounds  (MM  222):  Shambling  mounds

serve as living siege weapons in the Dark Talon war machine.

Powerful shamans sometimes ride these monstrous plants

into battle.

Stirges (MM 236): Dark Talon druids tend several storms

of stirges, which in turn serve the tribe in war.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

The  Dark  Talons  tactics  have  thus  far  been  effective  in

overwhelming  villages  and  small  towns  on  the  swamps

edge. Tales have spread through the land of a sinister mist

that rolls in from the swamp and brings terrible monsters.

The fear and uncertainty bred by such rumors sometimes

causes the tribes enemies to  ee in panic rather than stand

and  ght.

Scouting Party (EL 6): Two Dark Talon soldiers, along

with a wasp rider and his mount, patrol Dark Talon territory

for  intruders.  The  wasp  rider  locates  the  enemy  and  then

reports  to  the  soldiers.  Once  the  soldiers  strike,  the  wasp

rider attacks from above to pick off spellcasters or out ank

the enemy. Sometimes a wasp rider scouts ahead of a single

blackscale lizardfolk.

Raiders (EL 8): A Dark Talon shaman and four soldiers

form a raiding party to test and estimate defenses before a

Dark Talon assault. A raiding band might instead include a

shaman, four poison dusk lizardfolk, and a poison dusk lieu-

tenant (ranger 3) on a quick and stealthy survey mission.

HISTORY

The Dark Talon tribe arose from a peaceful lizardfolk clan

called the Emerald Eyes. For years, a black dragon ruled over

the Emerald Eyes swamp, and the lizardfolk were forced to

give the dragon tributeusually a few young lizardfolk for

its larderin return for their continued existence. A greedy

and ambitious druid named Yarshag, who was the tribes elder

shaman, helped broker the deal. Yarshag thereby won a bit

of  the  dragons  favor,  and  he  undermined  or  quietly  mur-

dered  those  lizardfolk  who  spoke  out  against  this  ghastly

arrangement.

One day, a band of dragonslayers entered the swamp to

 nd  and  kill  the  black  dragon.  They  sought  the  Emerald

Eyes help in  nding the dragons lair. When Yarshag saw

that the interlopers were actually strong enough to eliminate

the dragon, he gladly betrayed his mistress and offered to

lead the hunters to her. However, he secretly bid his beetle

companion to bear a message of warning to the dragon. If

the  slayers  won  their  battle,  Yarshag  would  be  hailed  as  a

wise leader who seized the chance to free his people. If the

dragon was victorious, surely she would reward Yarshag for

leading the intruders to their doom.

The battle between the slayers and the black dragon turned

out far better than Yarshag could have dreamt. They slew the

dragon, but only one of them, a dwarf berserker, survived.

Yarshag hid during the clash and watched from a distance,

and when the dragon fell, the treacherous druid leapt upon

the dwarf and  nished him off. Thus, Yarshag was left with

the dragons hoard and, more important, a small clutch of

dragon eggs.

Yarshag believed that he could hatch the dragons and har-

vest their blood, then employ the liquid to impart draconic

strength and cunning to the tribes young. He perfected this

process on his own children, making them stronger, tougher,

and faster. With the great wealth looted from the dragons

trove, he instilled greed and ambition in the tribe. Lizardfolk

who received his gifts swore personal allegiance to him, cul-

minating in a coup that placed Yarshag on the throne. The

few who spoke against Yarshags plans, particularly his desire

to expand his experiments to all the tribes young, were then

cowed or killed.

Since Yarshags rise to power, he has in amed the tribes

covetousness and hatred for the outside world. These two

passions combine to make the newly renamed Dark Talon

tribe  into  a  powerful  force.  Tribal  druids  have  tamed  and

raised a number of swamp monsters. Evangelists from the

tribe have formed alliances with other lizardfolk. The clans

that ally with Yarshags tribe become part of the Dark Talons

army. Those that resist become targets for conquest.

Unless Yarshag is defeated and his horri c experiments

ended, he could leave behind an enduring legacy of destruc-

tion, misery, and warfare.

Environment:  Lizardfolk  usually  inhabit  temperate

marshes, but the Dark Talons prefer underwater, air- lled

caves and burrows accessible only by swimming. Such loca-

tions are highly defensible and dif cult to detect.

Typical Physical Characteristics: The elite of the Dark

Talon  tribe  have  been  infused  with  black  dragon  blood

through Yarshags alchemical process. They are larger, faster,

and tougher than ordinary lizardfolk, close to 7 feet tall and

weighing nearly 250 pounds. Their scales are dusky, re ect-

ing their draconic heritage.

Yarshags process warps the young lizardfolks minds as

it enhances and strengthens their bodies. These tendencies

breed  true  in  the  next  generation  of  lizardfolk,  without

Yarshags in uence.

Alignment:  The  Dark  Talons  ferocity  and  cruelty  set

these lizardfolk apart from others. These stronger, tougher

specimens  have  a  natural  disposition  toward  violence.

Theyre not arbitrary in their attacks, however, nor are they

wantonly destructive. Dark Talon lizardfolk are often neutral

evil, but a great number of them are neutral.

This horri c chamber also holds dozens of lizardfolk eggs, a

crude alchemists lab that processes the blood, and tools used

to seed each egg with the vile concoction.

Dark Talon soldiers keep watch at a communitys palisade.

Contingents of four or more guards protect key points in

the settlement, the importance of the post determining the

number and strength of its sentinels. If an attack breaches the

wall, the soldiers leap from the top of one burrow to another

during the ensuing melee, avoiding the traps.

Yarshag and the Dark Talon tribe have one weakness that

could potentially spell their doom. Several lizardfolk clerics

of Semuanya, along with their followers, have secretly formed

an underground resistance. These lizardfolk know Semuanya

isnt dead. They are horri ed by Yarshags tampering with

their  peoples  eggs.  They  watch  friends  and  allies  being

conquered or forced to submit to Yarshag, and they endure

while icons to their god are cast down and destroyed. With

the right allies, these lizardfolk could lead an uprising that

ends Yarshags evil forever.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Dark  Talon  lizardfolk  have  standard  treasure  for  their

Challenge Rating. The soldiers adorn themselves with  trin-

kets from fallen foes. A Dark Talon village features dozens of

banners, crude statues, and other landmarks festooned with

trophies that proclaim each soldiers accomplishments. Each

DARK TALON LIZARDFOLK

AS CHARACTERS

See page 169 of the Monster Manual for information on lizard-

folk as characters. Other than their physical enhancements,

re ected in game terms by elite statistics, Dark Talon lizard-

folk have the same racial abilities as their ordinary kin.

SOCIETY

Yarshag is the king of the Dark Talon tribe, and his most

trusted lieutenants serve as  eld commanders and lords of

smaller  settlements  and  Dark  Talon  domains.  By  forcing

his most powerful underlings to scatter across a number of

villages and regions, Yarshag makes it almost impossible for

potential rivals to organize and overthrow him. These feudal

leaders  have  tremendous  autonomy  in  their  territory,  but

they all know that any failure invariably leads to execution.

Yarshag rules by fear, yet he richly rewards those lizardfolk

who best serve his needs.

Clergy among the Dark Talons are all druids. These liz-

ardfolk have abandoned the worship of Semuanya because

Yarshag teaches that the god is dead, slain by the deities of

other races. Yarshag claims that the deitys spirit appeared

to him in a dream and exhorted him to wreak vengeance

upon the civilized races. This philosophy helps stoke the

fury of the lizardfolk, particularly those that feel wronged

by peoples from beyond the swamps. The emerging Dark

Talon  cult  holds  that  Yarshag  is  a  dei c   gure  who  will

one day lead the lizardfolk to control the world. Religious

impetus also helps overcome the fears and concerns some

lizardfolk  feel  about  mingling  black  dragon  blood  with

their precious eggs. The strong, vicious lizardfolk born of

such tampering seem to con rm Yarshags teachings that

their people must engage in a campaign against all other

humanoids.

The Dark Talon tribe measures stature and prestige solely

in terms of success in battle. Trophies taken from fallen oppo-

nents, treasure looted from cities, and other tangible items

serve as an easy barometer for a soldiers success. Females

are  just  as  likely  to  become  soldiers  as  males,  particularly

those strengthened by Yarshags process. Dark Talons also

win honor and prestige for the deeds of their children. This

social impetus ensures the tribes numbers remain high. It

also demands expansion into new territory.

A  typical  Dark  Talon  village  is  a  heavily  armed  and

defended fortress. It features a wooden palisade or thick

brambles  tended  by  the  villages  druidsa  barrier  that

serves  as  cover  and  a  rallying  point  should  the  commu-

nity come under attack. Within these outer defenses, the

Dark Talons build their homes with the assumption that

they will eventually be assaulted. They prefer underwater,

air- lled caves and burrows, but if such dwellings arent

possible, the lizardfolk live in burrowed mounds or huts.

Pathways  between  the  burrows  are   lled  with  pit  traps,

snares,  and  other  hazards.  If  the  village  is  attacked,  the

noncombatants rush to set these traps before taking cover

in the burrows.

The  central  structure  of  a  Dark  Talon  village  is  a  laby-

rinthine  collection  of  narrow  tunnels,   ooded  passages,

and tight quarters. This place serves as the living space for

the druid who leads the village. A larger settlement, or one

recently  converted  to  Dark  Talon  control,  usually  holds

one of the black dragon hatchlings that provides the blood

needed to enhance unborn lizardfolk. The dragon is kept

deep within a room in the central complex and fed heavy

doses of a poison that reduces its intellect and keeps it docile.

trained as guardians for vaults, armories, and other strong-

holds.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A lodestone marauder is not a subtle creature. It knows its

most  formidable  weapons  are  its  magnetic  abilities,  and

it  uses  them  to  keep  its  foes  off  balance  and  disarmed.  A

hungry lodestone marauder  rst produces a burst of mag-

netic repulsion and follows this up with attraction. When

creatures draw near, it rips into them with its fearsome claws

and fangs.

The marauder tunneled into the armory almost a week

ago. Our warriors were tossed around like rag dolls and

none could get close enough to harm the beast. One of

our tunnel runners reported that the monster was last

seen feasting on the racks of hammers and axes.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

A lodestone marauder is often encountered individually. It

terrorizes a location and moves on once it has gorged itself.

Individual (EL 9): Most lodestone marauders are solitary

threats  that  are  attracted  to  places  with  large  amounts  of

metal or creatures that carry metallic objects.

EL 9: A mature lodestone marauder recently moved into a

small barony. It is drawn to the large amounts of steel to be

found there, the result of the barons recent preparations for

a military campaign.

Mated Pair (EL 11): Lodestone marauders seek mates, and

breeding pairs lair together.

EL  11:  Sahn  Ilmat,  a  powerful  necromancer,  raised  two

lodestone  marauders,  now  a  mated  pair,  to  act  as  sentries

for his laboratory. They escaped captivity and now roam the

wilds looking for food and a place to live.

ECOLOGY

Lodestone marauders are the result of magical experimen-

tation  and  have  no  place  in  the  natural  world.  They  were

LODESTONE MARAUDER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) can learn

more about lodestone marauders. When a character makes a

successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including

the information from lower DCs.

This is a lodestone marauder, a strange aberration.

This result reveals all aberration traits.

Lodestone marauders eat metal objects and

possess the ability to attract or repel metal.

29  Metallic weapons are less effective against

lodestone marauders. The creatures have some

sort of deflective field.

Lodestone marauders are smart enough to be

sider food rather than treasure. A lodestone marauder has

standard treasure for its Challenge Rating, about 4,500 gp,

which is made up exclusively of metal items.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Training  a  lodestone  marauder  to  take  orders  requires  six

weeks of work and a DC 20 Handle Animal check. Marauder

eggs are worth 4,000 gp apiece on the open market, while

young are worth 6,000 gp. Professional trainers charge 2,500

gp to rear or train a lodestone marauder.

LODESTONE MARAUDERS

IN EBERRON

Lodestone marauders are common in the Mror Holds, where

they are drawn to both the iron deposits in the mountains

and  the  vast  armories  in  the  vaults  of  the  dwarves.  A  few

enterprising dwarves capture newborn lodestone marauders

and train them as guardians.

LODESTONE MARAUDERS

IN FAERN

Lodestone marauders can be found all over Faern. They are

most  common  in  the  Underdark,  where  they  prey  on  the

hordes of drow, duergar, and other underground dwellers.

The boldest races capture them for training.

originally bred as guardians, but most were too wild for this

task and escaped. Some remain in captivity, where they serve

in their original roles.

These  creatures  spend  their  time  hunting  for  prey  and

large  caches  of  metal.  They  can  subsist  on  both  meat  and

metallic objects. Their bodies assimilate metal and use the

nutrients  in  the  substance  to  enhance  their  hides.  As  a

lodestone marauder grows, so too do the number and size

of the spikes on its body. A marauder that subsists on raw

ore grows more slowly than one that feasts on worked metal

objects.

Simple-minded  and  focused  on  eating  and  protecting

their hunting grounds, lodestone marauders act much like

territorial animals. Larger, older individuals fend off younger

interlopers that attempt to take over.

If a lodestone marauder locates an area with plentiful food,

it gorges itself and establishes a den. There, it gathers a pile

of metallic objects to attract a mate. Courtship is brief, but

mates are usually lifelong companions.

After breeding, females lay two to six iron-encased eggs,

which are tended by both parents and hatch in two months.

Lodestone marauder infants stay with their parents for about

six months and then leave to establish their own territories.

No familial bond remains.

Environment:  Lodestone  marauders  are  commonly

found in mountainous areas and underground wherever iron

deposits  are  plentiful.  However,  some   nd  their  way  into

populated areas, posing a serious danger to the inhabitants.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A bulky quadruped,

a lodestone marauder is 10 feet tall and long, weighing 3,500

pounds. Jagged, rusty spikes cover its metal-infused body,

and the creature moves about on spindly but power-

ful legs that end in terrible hooks. Its mouth is

 lled with numerous mandibles that are capa-

ble of shattering iron and steel. Visually,

its  impossible  to  tell  the  difference

between  male  and  female

lodestone marauders.

Alignment:  Lodestone

marauders  are  typically

neutral. As animalistic crea-

tures driven by basic needs,

they are unconcerned with

ethical matters. Their vora-

cious nature pushes some

toward  chaos  or  evil,

however, while guardian

lodestone marauders are

sometimes lawful.

Web (Ex) A Lolth-touched bebilith can throw a web up to

four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a

net but has a maximum range of 30 feet, with a range

increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up

to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place,

allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape the web with

a DC 27 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 27

Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based.

The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. It has a 75%

chance of not burning when any sort of fire is applied to it

(check each round).

Rend Armor (Ex) A Lolth-touched bebilith that hits with both

claw attacks pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This

attack automatically deals 4d6+24 points of damage to

the opponents armor. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is

destroyed.

Plane Shift (Su) As the plane shift spell; at will; caster

level 12th.

Skills A Lolth-touched bebiliths dark, mottled coloration

gives it a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks. It has a +4

racial bonus on Move Silently checks. A Lolth-touched

bebilith has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can

always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed

or threatened.

When Lolth so favors a bebilith, she usually has a special

purpose  in  mind.  Such  spider  demons  often  hunt  down

and destroy driders. Whether this is an inexplicable further

test of those supposedly failed drow or just an expression of

hatred, none can say.

Strategies and Tactics

A Lolth-touched bebilith is a cunning predator like its kin,

but  its  improved  physical  characteristics  make  its  webs

harder to escape and its poison more deadly. Its toughness

and fearlessness make it bolder, and its less likely to retreat

from battle. It starts out using a generous amount of its base

attack bonus with Power Attack, backing off on this aggres-

siveness only when it  nds its targets too hard to hit.

A Lolth-touched drow ranger is a  erce hunter who scouts

the caverns and corridors of the underground, taking out

enemies she can handle alone, and leading her strike team

against  others.  The  Lolth-touched  drow  ranger  presented

here  had  the  following  ability  scores  before  racial  adjust-

ments and Hit Dice ability score increases: Str 15, Dex 13,

Con 14, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 10.

Strategies and Tactics

A Lolth-touched drow ranger specializes in surprise attacks.

She prefers to track her prey unnoticed until the tactical situ-

ation is right, then attack with surprise if possible. Before

entering combat, she drinks her potion of barkskin and casts

longstrider on herself. Her viper animal companion weakens

opponents with its poisonous bite and helps to set up  ank-

ing situations.

Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str

+6, Con +6.

Skills: A Lolth-touched creature gains a +4 racial bonus

on Hide and Move Silently checks.

Special Qualities: A Lolth-touched creature has all the

special qualities of the base creature, plus the following spe-

cial quality.

Fearless (Ex): Lolth-touched creatures have immunity to all

fear effects.

Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +1.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Lolth-touched creatures are a select few who usually lead or

support groups of their lesser kin. They accompany priest-

esses of Lolth, guard the gods temples, and serve as enhanced

mounts or war beasts in drow armies. Occasionally, a favored

drow servant of Lolth might be so blessed.

Individual (EL 112): A single Lolth-touched creature is

usually an elite guardian or agent.

EL 3: A Lolth-touched Large monstrous spider lurks among

the spider carvings in a minor temple to Lolth. Its superior

Hide skill makes it dif cult to distinguish from its surround-

ings,  and  it  waits  until  potential  prey  has  wandered  close

before it strikes. A drow vermin keeper (Underdark 44) has

trained the spider after a fashion, so that it does not attack

anyone displaying the holy symbol of Lolth.

EL  11:  A  Lolth-touched  bebilith  prowls  the  walls  of  a

subterranean chasm, hunting the driders that inhabit cliff

dwellings  and  caves  within.  Sometimes  it  takes  a  web-

swathed victim with it to the Abyss, either to eat at its leisure

or at the behest of the Queen of the Demonweb Pits.

Patrol (EL 315): The Lolth-touched often rise to positions

of leadership among the drow, commanding elite squads that

patrol the subterranean territory near drow cities.

EL 9: Inzadila, a Lolth-touched ranger as described above,

is charged with hunting the choldriths (Monsters of Faern

27), who lead their chitine followers in raids against her home

city. Although she often works alone when spying on chitine

activities, when she acts decisively, she leads a squad of four

4th-level drow rangers as a strike team.

LOLTH-TOUCHED CREATURE LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can learn more

about Lolth-touched creatures. When a character makes a suc-

cessful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the

information from lower DCs.

using  the  appropriate  skill  according  to  the  base  creatures

type.

15

Result

This is a Lolth-touched creature, a superior

specimen. Lolth is the spider goddess of the

drow and Queen of the Demonweb Pits.

15 + CR  Lolth-touched creatures can be of almost any

kind, and they have greatly increased Strength

and Constitution. They are utterly fearless.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

ECOLOGY

Lolth-touched creatures exist alongside drow and their allies.

Sometimes they serve Lolth directly in the Demonweb or are

sent on speci c missions by the Queen of Spiders.

Environment: Lolth-touched creatures are usually found

underground, regardless of the base creatures normal habi-

tat. Most such creatures were natives of the underground.

Lolth-touched  creatures  that  serve  the  Queen  of  Spiders

directly dwell in the Demonweb, the 66th layer of the Abyss.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A Lolth-touched crea-

ture is more muscular and bulkier than ordinary creatures

of its kind. It stands taller if it is bipedal, and its coloration

is darker than would be natural for the base creature. This

coloration allows a Lolth-touched creature to fade into the

shadows more easily. Sometimes it sports a faint emblem of

a spider to mark its favored status.

Alignment: A Lolth-touched creature shifts its alignment

to chaotic evil, matching that of the Spider Goddess.

TYPICAL TREASURE

If the base creature ordinarily possesses treasure, the Lolth-

touched creature does too, according to its Challenge Rating.

Lolth-touched creatures favor the same sorts of items as do

normal specimens of their kind.

LOLTH-TOUCHED CREATURES

IN EBERRON

Lolth is not present in the mainstream pantheons of Eber-

ron, nor is she worshiped among the lesser sects. Most of

Eberrons drow revere the Fury, and this sinister goddess of

passion  lls the role of Lolth in many respects. The Lolth-

touched template can be used in an Eberron campaign with

no changes, creating Fury-touched creatures instead. Drow

of Xendrik worship Vulkoor, a scorpion deity who might

favor his followers in the same way.

The Cults of the Dragon Below are numerous and varied.

Objects of their worship might be ancient  ends or spirits no

longer remembered in the civilized lands, so introducing Lolth

into an Eberron campaign is as simple as creating a cult that

worships a spider demon. Lolth could even be a rakshasa rajah,

a potent  endish overlord trapped deep within Khyber.

LOLTH-TOUCHED CREATURES

IN FAERN

Drow judicators (Underdark 33) are feared knights who serve

Selvetarm, the Champion of Lolth. Their service grants them

many fearsome powers, and they can call spiderlike mon-

sters as servants. These dread champions are often blessed as

Lolth-touched, which makes them much more dangerous in

combat and strengthens their venom while in spider form.

A particularly blessed judicator might have a Lolth-touched

servant as well.

In  the  drow  metropolis  of  Menzoberranzan,  Lolth-

touched guardians protect the training academies on Tier

Breche.  Lolth-touched  bodyguards  also  attend  the  high

nobles when they venture out of the questionable safety of

their estates.

Superior Low-Light Vision (Ex) A lunar ravager can see five

times as far as a human can in shadowy illumination, and

ten times as far if moonlight is present.

Clairaudience/Clairvoyance (Sp) Visual only; a lunar ravager

can view only areas it is familiar with, which must be

illuminated with moonlight at the time of the viewing.

Moon Rider (Su) As the greater teleport spell; at will;

caster level 18th. Using this ability requires 1 minute of

concentration. When outside a lunar ravager lodge, a

lunar ravager must stand in moonlight to use this ability,

and it can transport only itself and items it carries to the

nearest lodge. When inside a lodge, a lunar ravager can

use this ability to travel to any point within 10 miles of the

lodge. A lunar ravager becomes misty and insubstantial

the moment before it teleports.

Lunar ravagers are ferocious fey that live to hunt. These fear-

some creatures dwell in hunting lodges nestled among the

clouds. On the nights when the moon is visible in the sky,

they ride beams of moonlight to the surface world in order

to hunt and slay. Lunar ravagers collect grim trophies and

treasure from their victims before returning to their lodge

to celebrate, rest, and prepare for the next hunt.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

When a lunar ravager  ghts alone, it relies on its spell-like

abilities to surprise its foes, using pass without trace to leave no

sign of its presence and invisibility to close with an enemy. A

ravager observes its prey for a time to determine its victims

abilities and possibly gain a terrain advantage. If the adver-

sary seems worthy, the lunar ravager uses air walk to strike

from above. Once engaged in battle, it tests its opponents

defenses  before  using  Power  Attack.  A  lone  lunar  ravager

facing a group usually seeks to slay a single foe, grab that

victims body, and  ee with the trophy to a safe place to use

its moon rider ability.

Ravagers  try  to  cover  a  large  area  during  a  hunt.  They

spread out in a ragged line, putting between 100 feet and half

a mile between each hunter. Each ravager casts pass without

trace on itself to evade trackers. Then they sweep across the

region, driving all creatures before them. They scream war

cries, sound their bronze horns, and call out to each other

to remain in contact and track prey.

When one ravager spots a potential markanything from

a dragon roused from its lair to a hapless farmer caught out

at  nightit  sounds  its  horn.  The  entire  party  then  uses

invisibility. Further horn calls tell the hunters where to go to

prepare an ambush, while a single ravager drives the quarry

toward its allies. Lunar ravagers  ght with vicious abandon

after theyve encircled their intended kill. Several use air

walk to attack from above, and the rest close in and use their

great size to cut off escape. A few use Power Attack right

from the start, with the rest following suit if the bold ones

are successful. The hunters continue this process through-

out the night, taking trophies and looting the dead. A lunar

ravager hunting party usually  ees after half its members

are slain.

Ive heard the horns that come with the full moon. Ive

helped bury the headless bodies of those whove ventured

into the forest on such nights. Unless you wish to end up

as a ravagers trophy, I suggest you spend the night here.

Ostler the barkeep, advising Regdar

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Lunar ravagers hunt alone or in groups. The greater a ravagers

ability and status, the more likely that it seeks glory alone.

Sometimes, younger lunar ravagers embark on solo hunts to

prove their mettle and earn the respect of their clan.

Individual (EL 7): A lone lunar ravager is on a quest for

blood and fame.

EL 7: Ravnha, a young lunar ravager out to prove herself,

has set a trap near a wooden bridge while under the effect

of her pass without trace ability. She has broken several of the

bridges supports and watches the nearby road for travelers.

When she spies a suitable group, she uses invisibility and air

walk. She then pushes out a remaining critical support and

leaps to attack from above as the bridge collapses.

Hunting  Party  (EL  11+):  Four  or  more  lunar  ravagers

form a hunting party.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Lunar  rav-

agers stand just over 9 feet tall, on average, and

weigh  in  the  neighborhood  of  550  pounds.

Their  skin  is  fair,  though  females  tend

toward pale, and their hair is always blond.

Alignment: Lunar ravagers are blood-

thirsty, savage, remorseless killers who pay

little heed to the welfare of others even

among their kind. Thus, they are usually

chaotic evil. Some lunar ravager bands are

chaotic neutral, hunting to test their skill

and  rarely  killing  weak  foes  for  sport.

These neutral fey might even trade with

other creatures.

SOCIETY

Lunar  ravager  society  is  clannish  and

based  on  the  principles  of  strength,

battle prowess, bluster, and wealth. Each

clan is a family of individuals related by

blood  or  mating.  A  lunar  ravager  wins

status in its clan by returning from raids

with ample loot,  ne trophies, and rich

food and drink. Female and male lunar

ravagers equally earn standing in their

society, based on merit.

A clan of lunar ravagers lives in a hunt-

ing lodge built on a cloud. The residents

of a lodge have basic control over their

direction of travel, but the chaotic rav-

agers  usually  allow  the  wind  to  carry

them where it will. They prefer to keep

moving rather than linger in one place

for too long. This strategy prevents over-

hunting of an area. It also makes lunar

ravagers  dif cult  to  handle,  since  they

attack randomly and move on before the local authorities

can organize.

Relations between lunar ravager clans are similarly hap-

hazard. In a chance meeting, two clans might clash, trade

goods, swap news, engage in a debauched revel, exchange a

few members, or rob each other. Often, some or all of these

events occur, and in no particular order.

These wicked fey see crafts that lack a direct connection

to  ghting, status, or easy living as a waste of time. Although

they forge their own weapons and armor, build lodges, and

make macabre jewelry, they care little for constructing other

items. They prefer to take tools and implements from others,

along with basic needs such as provisions.

Living as raiders and hunters, lunar ravagers usually seek

sustenance  in  remote  locales,  spending  a  few  nights  each

month pillaging and slaying on the surface. They avoid large

settlements, where resistance might be a real threat. If the

ravagers  come  across  a  farm  or  a  poorly  defended  village,

though, they load their sacks with food, casks of ale, live-

stock, and even a peasant or two. As dawn nears, they sound

their horns one  nal time before returning to their lodge to

feast, drink, and celebrate the hunt.

Lunar ravager

EL 11: Arbha, Clonach, Ebhla, and Nuil prowl a

moonlit forest on a midnight hunt. They use char-

acteristic tactics for a hunting party, as described above.

ECOLOGY

Lunar  ravagers  are  supernatural  hunters  that  some  say

embody natures viciousness. However, theyre largely dis-

placed from the natural world. Little more than overgrown

scavengers, they see the land below their lodges as fertile

ground for riches and prey. They hunt for meat, and they

raid settlements for strong drink and supplies.

Mating among lunar ravagers is thought to be much as it

is among humanoids.

Environment: Lunar ravagers hunt in any terrain, though

they only rarely venture underground. They prefer areas with

a clear view of the sky, close enough to civilization for easy

raiding but far enough to avoid large armies and other threats.

Lunar ravagers live within lodges that  oat on the clouds. In

this environment, they hunt birds and other  ying creatures

between raids to the surface world.

Lunar  ravagers  exult  in  toying  with  their  victims,  and

they underestimate smaller creatures. This tendency works

against them when they face skilled opposition. Lunar rav-

agers hate cowardice, but they are not fools, and they retreat

before an opponent that seems to have the upper hand. A

lunar ravagers belt is much more likely to carry the skulls

of dire animals, magical beasts, and common folk than those

of dragons,  ends, and heroes.

Some lunar ravagers embark on long journeys to demon-

strate their  ghting talents and improve their prestige. Such

ambitious ravagers are the smartest, bravest, and most cun-

ning of their kind. They ally with other vicious creatures,

most notably werewolves and evil fey, to wreak havoc wher-

ever they go. Their aim is to return home laden with enough

wealth and fame to attain leadership of their clan.

Stranded ravagers are similarly dangerous. Such an unfor-

tunate usually wanders too far from its lodge or stays on the

surface too long, becoming trapped without the moonlight

it needs to ride home. Whether this situation arises because

of a plot by a jealous rival or mere happenstance, when the

next  night  comes  around,  the  marooned  reaver  discovers

that  its  cloud  lodge  has  drifted  away.  Such  ravagers  seek

out weaker but like-minded creatures, particularly orcs and

ogres, to torment and command. An orc tribe led by a lunar

ravager poses a great threat, for the ravagers intellect, strong

personality, and insight make it a keen commander.

A  few  lunar  ravagers  intentionally  leave  their  lodges

behind, preferring to rule smaller folk on earth rather than

serve among their kind amid the clouds.

dard treasure for the creatures Challenge Rating, largely in

the form of coins and art objects. However, a lunar ravager

encountered alone carries little treasure besides its weapon

and  armor,  along  with  any  trophies  it  might  have  taken

earlier in the hunt.

Lunar ravagers cherish their hunting horns, handed down

through the ages within clans. These ancient bronze horns

produce a bone-chilling tone that unmistakably declare the

approach of the hunt.

LUNAR RAVAGERS WITH

CLASS LEVELS

Lunar ravagers favored class is barbarian, in keeping with

their brutish tendency and love of battle, although rangers

and rogues are also common. Among their kind, a swift knife

in the back is the preferred method of settling a dispute.

Lunar ravager clerics worship Erythnul. That dread deitys

bloodthirsty teachings appeal to their taste for murder and

destruction.

Level Adjustment: +6.

LUNAR RAVAGERS IN EBERRON

The lunar ravagers of Eberron dwell primarily in Xendrik.

Legends tell of six  oating castles, each positioned high over

the continent, that once served as important centers of magi-

cal research for the empire of the giants. Lunar ravagers have

long since descended into savagery, but their homes are still

 lled with untold wonders.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A lunar ravager lodge is  lled with a vast array of treasures

and  trophies,  accumulated  through  untold  centuries  of

murder and theft. Since these fey are greedy folk who mea-

sure their prestige by the possessions they have stolen, they

scavenge every coin and valuable object they can  nd. They

take particular delight in robbing mortals of heirlooms and

sentimental valuables. Ravager lodges have double the stan-

LUNAR RAVAGERS IN FAERN

Lunar ravagers are spread across Toril. They avoid civilized

lands, having learned well the power of a vengeful Harper

or a skilled mage. Rumors abound that the Red Wizards of

Thay have entered into a pact with several lunar ravager clans.

The Thayans pay the ravagers gems, gold, and other riches

in return for transport and service as mercenaries. Perhaps

the hunter fey are part of the Red Wizards latest scheme

against Rashemen.

Sense Magic (Su) A mageripper swarm automatically detects

magic auras within 30 feet, and it knows the strength and

location of each. It can also detect creatures that possess

the ability to cast spells or use spell-like abilities.

Dispelling Aura (Su) At the end of each of a mageripper

swarms turns, it can attempt a dispel check against

one randomly selected ongoing spell or spell-like effect

on each creature in its space. This works like the area

dispel effect of the dispel magic spell, with the following

differences. The dispelled spell is selected randomly from

those currently active on an affected creature, rather than

being the one with the highest caster level. This ability

has no effect on permanent magic items.

For each spell dispelled by its aura, a mageripper

swarm gains temporary hit points equal to 2  that

spells level. These temporary hit points last for up to

24 hours, and a swarm can gain a maximum number of

temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit point

total. A mageripper swarm that gains the maximum

number of temporary hit points and retains them for the

full 24 hours advances 1 Hit Die at the end of this period,

increasing its capabilities as normal for advancement.

Magic Leech (Su) In addition to dealing damage to creatures

whose space it occupies, a mageripper swarm drains

away the ability to cast spells and use spell-like abilities,

feeding on the magical energy.

At the end of a mageripper swarms turn, each

creature in its space must succeed on a DC 19 Will save

or lose one prepared spell or spell slot of the highest level

available. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature

with a spell-like ability that fails its saving throw loses one

daily use of its highest-level ability. If this spell-like ability

is usable at will, the creature is unable to use it for 1

minute. If the target has no spells prepared, no remaining

spell slots, and no uses of spell-like abilities remaining,

this ability has no effect. A mageripper swarm cannot

choose which spell to drain; determine this randomly.

For each spell drained in this way, a swarm gains

temporary hit points equal to 5  the spells level.

These temporary hit points function as described in the

dispelling aura ability.

Distraction (Ex) Fortitude DC 16, nauseated 1 round. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Skills Mageripper swarms have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened.

A mageripper swarm consists of around three hundred Tiny

horrors that seek out and feed on magical energy. The crea-

tures are hazards to spellcasters of all kinds.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

When it detects nearby magical auras, a mageripper swarm

moves immediately toward the strongest aura or the strongest

spellcaster. It attacks relentlessly,  lling the targets space and

draining as much magical energy as it can. It stops only when

destroyed or the source is completely drained.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

A mageripper swarm is always encountered alone, although

it  might  be  found  near  intelligent  creatures  that  use  it  to

protect against spellcasting enemies. Multiple swarms can

infest the same general area if they get out of control and

the supply of magical energy is plentiful enough, but such

swarms dont work together.

Individual (EL 6): The lone wizard Edgar (N male human

wizard 4) has become a prisoner in his tower since a magerip-

per swarm discovered his retreat. After escaping the swarms

initial assaults, he sealed himself in an inner laboratory. The

windowless room keeps out the swarm, but the supply of food

and air is limited. Occasionally he throws open the door and

blasts the swarm with scorching ray spells, but he cant deal

enough damage to overcome it completely. The swarm has

infested his arcane workshop, which is  lled with completed

and half- nished potions, wands, and the like. During one

of his sorties, Edgar activated a Quaals feather token (bird) to

take a distress message to the nearby wizards academy.

ECOLOGY

Mageripper swarms are so bizarre that they are unlikely to

have arisen naturally. Most scholars believe that they were

created deliberately for some purpose.

A mageripper swarm relies on nonvisual senses to discern

its environment. The creatures that make up the swarm can

subsist on meat, but they thrive on magical energy and prefer

to live where that food source is easy to  nd. Such swarms

are real threats in larger cities, where they infest the magic

districts, and in areas inhabited by beings such as elves or

fey that use magic routinely.

Although they cannot consume the magical energy stored

in magic items, the auras of such items still attract magerip-

per  swarms,  much  as  a  candle   ame  attracts  moths.  The

confused  and  hungry  creatures  mill  about  the  item  until

they are destroyed or  nd something else to eat.

Consuming  magical  energy  allows  the  creatures  to

reproduce,  increasing  the  swarms  size.  Individual  swarm

members  live  only  for  a  year  or  so,  but  when  the  swarm

devours  magic,  its  constituent  creatures  can  double  their

numbers within days. They reproduce asexually, with young

budding from the backs of the adults. If a mageripper swarm

grows to double its original size (that is, to 20 Hit Dice), it

splits into two swarms with 10 Hit Dice each.

Beings that are inimical to magic sometimes encourage

swarms to inhabit their environs. Magerippers make effec-

tive guardians, although they move to more fertile feeding

grounds if too few spellcasters inhabit the area. Other crea-

tures  use  them  to  defend  against  magical  assaults.  These

keepers sometimes cast spells on a helpless captive or capture

and bind a spellcaster, leaving the prisoner as food within

the swarms territory.

Magerippers  are  sentient,  although  their  intelligence  is

more the cunning of a predator. They are capable of adapting

their tactics to  t new circumstances. Though driven largely

by the instinct to feed and reproduce, mageripper swarms

can modify their behavior in response to stimuli.

Individuals  become  sluggish  and  unresponsive  if

separated from the swarm, and they soon die.

Environment: Mageripper swarms can be found

in any temperate environment and are attracted to

urban areas. They cant tolerate extremes of heat and

cold. Often a swarm infests the cellar

of a wizards enclave or an ancient

dungeon.

Typical Physical Characteris-

tics: A typical mageripper is about 1

foot long and weighs 3 to 5 pounds.

It  seems  to  be  fashioned  from  a

jumble of unrelated pieces, with

big  chewing  jaws,  insectlike

legs, and tentacles like those of

a displacer beast. Its coloration

is  unnatural,  with  overtones

of  sickly  purple,  blue,  or  pink.

Circular  blotches  along  the  body

mark the location of specialized organs that sense magi-

cal energy.

Alignment:  Mageripper  swarms  are  solely  concerned

with  acquiring  sustenance  and  multiplying.  They  are  not

intentionally  destructive  or  malicious,  but  they  do  act

erratically.  They are always chaotic neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Mageripper  swarms  do  not  accumulate  money  or  most

sorts of treasure, and most folk have no use for the horrible

little things. However, they are often found in the vicinity

of hoards of magic items, and the swarm is more likely to

gather around stronger magical auras. A mageripper swarm

has double standard treasure for its Challenge Rating, about

4,000 gp, all of which is magic items.

MAGERIPPER SWARMS IN EBERRON

The fanatical Ashbound druids regard all arcane magic as

unnatural, but they do not believe in wanton killing. They

 nd mageripper swarms to be effective deterrents. The crea-

tures are not common within the Eldeen Reaches, though,

and seeking them out can lead into the dangerous territories

of  the  Demon  Wastes  or  the  Shadow  Marches.  Aundairs

cities  suffer  from  recurring  infestations  of  mageripper

swarms, and they make good sources for Ashbound druids

who are willing to enter cities.

With  its  lingering  arcane  energy  and  living  spells,  the

Mournland is a fertile feeding ground for magerippers. The

creatures might even have arisen there, perhaps mutated from

mundane pests in the aftermath of the Day of  Mourning.

MAGERIPPER SWARMS IN FAERN

The sewers of Waterdeep lead to innumerable and mysteri-

ous placeshavens for crime gangs, weird cults, and strange

creatures. Mageripper swarms are also found in large num-

bers in Skullport.

The  Red  Wizards  of  Thay  have  set  up  trading  enclaves

throughout Faern, where they offer rare and useful magic

for  sale.  Such  large  concentrations  of  magic  items  are

magnets  for  mageripper  swarms.  Keeping  the  dangerous

creatures under control is a con-

stant worry for the  Thayans.

Earth Glide (Ex) A greathorn minotaur can glide through

stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal

as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing

leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any

ripple or other signs of its presence.

Earth Warp (Su) As a swift action, a greathorn minotaur can

cause the earth and rock around it to twist and warp in a

60-foot-radius emanation around it, doubling movement

costs through that area. Natural stone, finished stone,

and dirt surfaces are subject to this effect. The effect

does not move with the minotaur; when the minotaur

leaves the area, the ground returns to normal. The

minotaur ignores the movement penalties generated by

its own or another greathorns earth warp ability.

Natural Cunning (Ex) Greathorn minotaurs have immunity to

maze spells, never become lost, and can track enemies.

They are never caught flat-footed.

Skills Greathorn minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on Listen,

Search, and Spot checks.

A greathorn is a powerful subterranean relative of normal

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Greathorn  minotaurs  are  likely  to  be  encountered  within

their lairs or leading other minotaurs underground.

Individual (EL 7): A lone greathorn minotaur has carved

a  maze  close  to  duergar  territory,  hoping  to  capture  and

devour as many gray dwarves as possible. It ambushes any

humanoids that cross its path.

Pair (EL 9): Recently bonded, a mated pair  ghts as a team.

The female launches the initial attack. Once battle is joined,

the male emerges from the rock to catch an opponent from

a  ank.

Templars (EL 11): Four greathorn minotaurs have banded

together in service to a temple to the earth aspect of the Elder

Elemental  Eye  (see  page  8).  They  patrol  the  area  near  the

temple, driving off interlopers. The minotaurs use hit-and-

run tactics to slowly sap an enemy groups strength. If hard

pressed, they  ee or hide within the stone, and the wounded

retreat to the temple to rouse its occupants and avenge their

fallen comrades.

ECOLOGY

Greathorn  minotaurs  arose  in  the  untold  reaches  of  the

underground realm as an offshoot of the minotaur race. Great

wells of elemental earth energy warped and twisted several

minotaur tribes, yielding the fearsome beings that now prowl

labyrinths and passages deep within the earth.

Greathorn minotaurs hunt for food, eating just about any-

thing they kill. However, they love the taste of the  esh of

sentient creatures above all other foods. Humanoid prey is

their favorite.

Once every few years, greathorn minotaurs embark on a

great migration. Sages believe that the minotaurs follow the

ebb and  ow of elemental earth energy.

Environment:  Greathorn  minotaurs  live  underground

and rarely venture to the surface. They steal developed ter-

ritory from other denizens when possible, altering it to their

their lairs, complete with numerous dead ends, pits, and

other  traps.  When  on  the  surface,  greathorn  minotaurs

hide during the day and move about at night.

Typical Physical Characteristics:

Greathorn  minotaurs  are  larger

and bulkier than their ordi-

nary  kin,  standing  over

9  feet  tall  and  weighing

nearly a ton. They get their

name from their enormous

horns, which can extend

5  or  more  feet  from

their massive skulls.

Greathorn  mino-

taurs  lack  the  thick,

shaggy  coats  of  their

mundane  cousins,  instead

sporting short, coarse fur the color of

slate.

Males  are  larger  than  females,  and

their horns are longer. The fur of females tends

toward lighter colors, and individuals with pure

white fur have been documented.

Alignment: Greathorn minotaurs thrive on

mayhem and violence, killing and

destroying  with  no  regard  and

seeing  only  might  as  worthy

of respect. Most greathorn mi-

notaurs are chaotic evil.

SOCIETY

Greathorn  minotaurs  are  as  greedy  and  vain  as  they  are

gluttonous  and  domineering.  They  often  settle  disputes

by  killing  and  devouring  those  that  displease  them.  On

the other hand, they gladly work as mercenaries for drow,

duergar, derro, and other evil creatures that provide them

with wealth and the meat of humanoids. Mind  ayers par-

ticularly favor greathorn minotaur sellswords, which make

excellent guards.

Greathorns  go  out  of  their  way  to  murder  or  browbeat

others  of  their  kind,  seeing  them  as  rivalsexcept  when

the creatures are involved in courtship or mating. Males put

on great displays of both prosperity and prowess to attract a

mate. Once bonded, a pair stays together for life and has as

many children as possible.

In areas with lesser minotaurs, greathorn minotaurs are

the undisputed leaders. Blessed with higher intelligence than

their kin, greathorns unify tribes of ordinary minotaurs into

armies that terrorize the surrounding area. An army of this

sort  is  short-livedthe  fractious  nature  of  the  minotaurs

soon tears it apart. When they are not around others of their

kind, greathorn minotaurs have been known to dominate

evil humanoids such as orcs, bugbears, and gnolls.

Temples dedicated to the earth aspect of the Elder Elemen-

tal Eye are strangely attractive to greathorn minotaurs, which

are among such temples most ardent supporters. Given their

egotism,  piety  of  any  other  sort  is  rare  among  greathorn

minotaurs.  They  do  have  clerics,  though,  all  of  whom  are

female. Those females with white fur are groomed from birth

to  become  priestesses  of  the  Elder  Elemental  Eye  and  its

readily.  Greathorn  minotaur  clerics  worship  the  Elder

Elemental  Eye  (see  page  7),  usually  choosing  Destruction

and Earth as their domains. They have no knowledge of this

GREATHORNS IN EBERRON

Greathorn minotaurs are most common in Droaam, where

they rule entire communities of minotaurs. The tribes view

the ascension of a greathorn as an auspicious event, often

using the occasion as an excuse to start a grab for more ter-

ritory.  Smarter  monsters  of  Droaam,  especially  medusas

and ogre mages, commonly employ greathorns as of cers

of minotaur units in their personal armies.

A healthy population of greathorn minotaurs lives in the

twisting chasms of the Demon Wastes.

Nagathas are wormlike creatures created by evil spirit nagas

from the bodies of normal humanoids. They enjoy eviscer-

ating  their  victims  and  take  sadistic  glee  in  the  pain  and

suffering of living creatures. Their cruelty remains the most

obvious  and  twisted  expression  of  the  pain  they  endured

during the hideous transformation into their current form.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Nagathas  are  blind,  so  they  rely  on  their  keen  hearing  to

detect creatures beyond the 60-foot range of their blindsight.

They  are  intelligent  enough  to  fear  ranged  attacks  from

outside  that  distance.  If  nagathas  hear  enemies  approach-

ing from far away, they burrow just beneath the surface and

strike from an ambush position. Similarly, nagathas burrow

to protect themselves from attacks by opponents they cant

hear or sense with blindsight.

Nagathas  guarding  an  entry  often  hide  beneath  the

earth in the doorway, waiting to waylay interlopers. Patrol-

ling nagathas space themselves out, using their blindsight

for  increased  effectiveness  and  mutual  protection.  When

encountered  with  their  naga  master,  guardian  nagathas

engage intruders in melee, keeping them stuck in combat

as the naga casts spells from afar.

102

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

A given group of nagathas is loyal to the spirit naga that cre-

ated them, and they are usually encountered in the company

of  their  master  or  while  performing  some  mission.  They

patrol their masters domain for intruders. Spirit nagas also

throw nagathas against superior forces as fodder.

Guardians (EL 6): A pair of nagathas patrols the marshy

outer reaches of a spirit nagas lair, seeking victims.

Sweepers  (EL  8):  Four  nagathas  slither  through  the

remains  of  an  ancient  churchyard,  protecting  the  nearby

sanctum of their master.

Naga Writhe (EL 11): In the heart of a ruined temple, a

spirit naga schemes while six nagathas stand watch.

ECOLOGY

Nagathas  are  the  product  of  a  process  practiced  by  spirit

nagas that magically corrupts the bodies of captured Medium

humanoids into sickening, wormlike creatures with sharp

claws. Humanoids that unsuccessfully raid spirit naga lairs

provide the most abundant raw material for nagathas. Those

left unconscious in battle often end up being harvested for

this purpose.

Survivors of such transformation bear no resemblance to

their previous forms. Their legs are fused into a wormlike

lower  body,  using  up  much  of  the  muscle  mass  from  the

subjects abdomen and legs. Arm bones re-form and solidify

into enormous bone claws. Their heads stretch into the like-

ness of vipers, and they lose their eyesight. Raw material from

snakes provides the basis for a nagathas poison.

The  nal and perhaps most invasive alteration is made to

the subjects mind. The spirit nagas dull its mental faculties

to  destroy  any  potential  for  arcane  spellcasting,  and  erase

memories and knowledge of its previous existence, but they

deliberately leave a painful emotional echo, allowing a nagatha

to realize that something important has been taken from it.

A nagatha has a poisonous bite that saps a victims

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Environment:  Nagathas  inhabit  temperate  marshes,

making their homes in an ancient ruin or crumbling fortress

with  the  spirit  naga  that  dominates  them.  Nagathas  leave

such areas only if their naga master has been defeated in a

battle they survived.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Nagathas have worm-

like lower bodies, which elongate and contract when they

move. A nagathas head resembles a large vipers, complete

with fangs, and sinewy arms swing its oversized bone

claws. These claws make wielding manufactured weap-

ons all but impossible.

The  average  nagatha  is  about  7  feet  long  and

weighs 150 to 250 pounds.

Alignment:  Nagathas  are  always  chaotic

evil,  being  pain-driven  and  utterly  sadistic.

Their  spirit  naga  creators  encourage  and

foster hatred of other creatures, especially

humanoids.

SOCIETY

The only solace nagathas can  nd after being

transformed  is  in  the  misery  of  similar

company.  Nagathas  retain  no  memory

of  their  humanoid  existence,  but

they are  lled with a lingering

feeling  of  emptiness:  Some-

thing important to them has

been  forever  lost.  Since  this

feeling  is  common  to  all

nagathas,  they  openly

commiserate  with

each  other.  Nobody

understands  the  pain

a  nagatha  feels  better

than another nagatha.

Spirit  nagas  capital-

ize  on  this  sense  of  loss,

having cultivated it in their

creations,  and  take  care

to  express  understanding.

Nagathas  consequently  look

to  their  sympathetic-seeming

parents for a sense of purpose. They are happiest

when attacking invaders that enter their masters

realm, since battle allows them to focus their pain-

ful confusion into a fury that is both cathartic and cruel.

The  procedure  for  creating  a  nagatha  incorporates  a

charm person spell cast on the original humanoid, making

the nagatha loyal to the spirit naga even after transforma-

tion into a monstrous humanoid. The spell is permanently

woven into nagathas so that they always regard their spirit

naga creator as a trusted friend or close relative. Nagathas

react with rage to any suggestion that their master could in

any way be responsible for their pain.

Nagatha

TYPICAL TREASURE

Individual  nagathas  have  no  treasure  but  happily  collect

riches for their naga masters. A spirit naga with  ve to eight

nagathas  has  standard  coins,  double  goods,  and  standard

items for the groups Encounter Level. A spirit naga accom-

panied by nine to twelve nagathas has standard coins, double

goods, and double items.

ADVANCED NAGATHAS

Nagathas usually advance by Hit Dice, growing more

potent as guardians over the span of their miser-

able lives. Those that take class levels usually

advance as  ghters or barbarians, and they

never enter a spellcasting class.

IN FAERN

nagas  to  be  naturally  in-

quisitive,  especially  about

the Art, but they also made

nagas   ercely  self-centered.

Each seeks a domain where its

will is supreme. Independent spirit nagas

are common in the caves along the Naga ow in the

Nagalands of Chondath and Sespech, where lie an-

cient naga spawning grounds. The powerful among

these nagas create many nagathas from local folk.

Spirit nagas congregate in Najara, the Kingdom of Snakes,

A  necrosis  carnex  is  a  ghastly  collection  of  corpse- esh

bound together into an engine of destruction. It is something

like an undead  esh golem, but it retains a glimmer of intel-

ligence and can follow simple orders. Necrosis carnexes serve

undead armies as both shock troops and combat medics.

combat.  Usually  teamed  with  other  undead,  the  carnexes

know that they are at their most effective when using their

foul touch to heal their companions. To facilitate this, they

keeping  their  foes  within  their  malign  aura.  These  crea-

tures love to slay the living and use their necrotic touch on

an  unconscious  but  living  foe  if  an  opportunity  presents

itself.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Necrosis carnexes are often found in the company of other

undead. Powerful intelligent undead keep these creatures

as pets and personal companions, knowing that the necrotic

energy of a carnexs touch can mend their lifeless  esh.

Gate  Guards  (EL  5):  A  pair  of  bugbear  zombies  guard

the entrance to a secret underground temple, forti ed by a

necrosis carnex. When combat begins, the zombies lumber

forward while the necrosis carnex hangs back to heal them,

attempting to keep foes within its malign aura.

Undead Raiders (EL 6): A vampire spawn leads two trog-

lodyte zombies and a necrosis carnex on a raid. The creatures

hide  within  a  temple  dedicated  to  Nerull  during  the  day,

emerging at night to stalk their prey among the back alleys

of a major city. The temple priests deny any involvement with

the undead.

Graveyard Lord (EL 7): In a secret warren beneath an

ancient graveyard, a wight leads four ghouls and a necrosis

carnex. The wight is a strict tactician, ordering the ghouls to

move into  anking positions or to aid it in its attacks (with

the aid another action). It uses the carnex as a healer for itself

and its ghoul minions.

ECOLOGY

Necrosis  carnexes  are  beings  outside  nature.  They  have  a

simple  and  stark  existence,  stemming  entirely  from  their

origin as purposefully created undead. Their limited intelli-

gence means that they respond to situations on an instinctive

level,  although  they  have  some  capacity  to  retain  instruc-

tions and learn the most effective ways to help their allies.

This is a necrosis carnex, an undead creation that

28

23  Necrosis carnexes are particularly vulnerable to

damage from good-aligned weapons and spells.

A necrosis carnex is created from several corpses

bound together with cold iron bands. It serves to

support armies of other undead, though its

behavior is largely instinctive.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

They make few attempts to communicate and

understand only the simplest commands.

Carnexes  automatically  attack  and  kill

living  creatures  unless  instructed  not  to  by

their masters. In the absence of a master, they

view  the  most  powerful  intelligent  undead

creature  in  their  presence  as  a   gure  of

authority and willingly obey that creatures

commands. In the rare event that carnexes

 nd themselves on their own, they seek

out other undead, preferring potent and

sentient  undead  to  which  they  can  ally

themselves.

Environment:  Necrosis  carnexes  can  be

found  wherever  their  abilities  are  needed.

They  have  no  native  environment,  though

they  often  share  the  habitats  of  intelligent

undead.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Every

necrosis carnex is different, because each one

is  cobbled  together  from  several  corpses.  It

might walk on four hands, or have no arms at

all. Each unholy creation is held together by

cold iron bands.

Alignment:  Although  it  is  barely  intel-

ligent,  a  necrosis  carnex  understands  its

dutyto kill and to protect its undead allies. Their unthink-

ing ferocity, and the horri c process used to create them,

make necrosis carnexes always neutral evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

A  necrosis  carnex  carries  no  treasure  of  its  own,  unless  a

patron has granted it a protective magic item of some kind.

The cold iron bands that hold together its undead  esh weigh

10 pounds and are worth 200 gp. Separating the iron from

the moldering meat of a necrosis carnexs corpse requires

1 minute of effort.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A spellcaster of 11th level or higher can create a necrosis

carnex with an animate dead spell. To do so requires three

corpses from Medium creatures and cold-hammered iron

bands worth 200 gp. None of this material is consumed in

the casting and but instead becomes the undead amalgam

of the carnex. When used to create a necrosis carnex, the

animate dead spell has a casting time of 10 minutes.

NECROSIS CARNEXES IN EBERRON

Ranks of Karrnathi undead soldiers are seeded with necro-

sis carnexes whenever possible. A units carnex functions

as a battle eld healer. Unlike a typical humanoid healer, a

necrosis carnex can move to the front of a massed group of

undead and, by being destroyed, lay waste ranks of enemy

soldiers while rejuvenating its allied troops. Introduced late

in the Last War, necrosis carnexes had a decisive in uence

on several battles involving Karrnaths legions.

Necrosis carnex

Undead  servants  of  the  Blood  of  Vol  favor  necrosis

carnexes as companions and healers. Carnexes occasionally

participate in missions with Emerald Claw soldiers who are

led by an undead creature. The necromancers of the Emerald

Claw also value necrosis carnexes as support for their mind-

less undead slaves.

NECROSIS CARNEXES IN FAERN

Necrosis carnexes are relatively rare in Faern, as is the lore

of their construction.

Only a couple of groups use these creatures with any regu-

larity.  Kiaransalees  worshipers  sometimes  create  necrosis

carnexes to protect and bolster their other undead creations.

Thayan necromancers produce and keep carnexes in their

enclaves scattered throughout Faern. These creatures are

never  allowed  to  muddy  the  faade  so  important  to  the

Thayan  representatives,  but  some  enclaves  harbor  secret

reserves of undead troops. A single necrosis carnex can make

such a force much more effective.

Empathic Link (Su) An oaken defender has an empathic

900 feet.

Find Oaken Defender (Su) As the discern location spell;

always active; caster level 18th. An oaken defender can

use this ability only to find another oaken defender on the

same plane as itself. All oaken defenders are considered

to have seen one another for the purpose of this ability.

Oaken  defenders  are  ferocious  protectors  of  the  sacred

groves that dryads inhabit. They are rare creatures, usually

appearing only when a dryads oak is attacked. When roused,

an oaken defender remains only as long as is necessary to

destroy the dryads enemies.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

As guardians of their groves, oaken defenders immediately

attack hostile intruders, unless a dryad or other fey is pres-

ent to calm them. An oaken defender lurks partially under

the ground of its chosen home, hiding in the undergrowth,

rising up in the midst of interlopers when most or all of them

have moved within its reach.

An oaken defender takes advantage of its great size and

overpowering  strength,  using  Power  Attack  to  deal  maxi-

mum damage. Its multiple limbs can serve as both arms and

legs as needed. Against one or two foes, it moves about on

four limbs and thrashes with the other two. When it faces a

large number of enemies, it prefers to stay in place and smash

all its foes using Whirlwind Attack. It commonly uses Power

Attack  in  conjunction  with  Whirlwind  Attack,  especially

when more than four foes are within reach; in such a case,

its gore has a +12 bonus on the attack roll and deals 2d6+23

points of damage.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

To face an oaken defender is to be the enemy of a dryad and its

tree. The dryads of a grove lend their support to the defender,

as  do  any  treants  and  other  forest  protectors  in  the  area.

Sometimes dryads adopt a militant stance and draw travelers

into hostilities, even those who have no evil intent. Even in

such cases, an oaken defender rises to assist.

Guardian (EL 12): The roots of a dryads tree have grown

over and completely enclosed a sacred artifact that is the only

hope of repelling a  endish invasion. The dryad is unwill-

ing to risk death even for such a vital need, and the groves

defender hears her silent cry.

Pair (EL 14): An army on its way to war has camped at

the edge of an ancient forest, and a squad of soldiers is cut-

ting down trees for fuel without regard for the dryads that

live there. Too many soldiers are encamped for the dryads to

in uence with their spell-like abilities, and even the groves

defender cant defeat them all. A second defender comes to

the aid of the assaulted grove.

ECOLOGY

Oaken  defenders  are  massive,  long-lived  creatures  that

embody the fury of nature. They resemble enormous masses

of vegetation.

An oaken defender is quiescent for almost all its exten-

sive life, resting just beneath the surface of a faerie grove.

It might sleep for centuries, while grass, undergrowth, and

small shrubs grow on its hide and obscure its vicious spikes.

It  is  in  constant  empathic  contact  with  the  dryads  of  the

grove, though, and at their alarm, it rises like a mountain to

their defense. Once the threat has passed, it sinks again into

slumber.

While  sleeping,  an  oaken  defender  does  not  eat.  The

ends of its tentacular limbs sprout absorbent tissues that

protrude  from  the  soil  around  the  grove  to  collect  rain-

water. The dryads support it with nourishment from their

trees, which grow delicate roots into its outer skin. Once

an oaken defender has come awake, though, the fury of its

attack makes it ravenous. It consumes its fallen enemies and

might even pursue those who  ee to satiate its rapacious

hunger.

When  an  oaken  defender  ages  to  a  thousand  years,  it

begins the process of reproduction. The new defender starts

out as an acorn from a dryads tree that incubates within a

follicle inside the parent oaken defender. There, it absorbs

nutrients from the parents body, causing the parent to draw

more  nourishment  in  turn  from  the  grove,  and  it  trans-

forms into an embryonic

defender.  The  seed

becomes  something

like an egg, and the

developing  creature

spends nearly a cen-

tury  slowly  growing

within.  At  the  end  of

this  period,  it  is  about

one-quarter  the  size  of

the  parent,  whose  body

is  visibly  distended  by

the  enlarged  cyst.  The

new defender is born

by  bursting  from

the  body  of  the  old,

which  is  killed  in

the  process.  The  par-

ents  corpse  provides

nourishment  for  a

new growth spurt, after

which the young defender

takes  up  the  duties  of  the  old  one.

Sometimes two acorns are incubated

in  this  way,  so  that  a  newborn  defender  can

leave to protect a different grove. None of this takes place in

isolation. The dryads of the grove tend to the old defender,

comforting it and making their farewells. They then assist

the young one with acclimating to its new existence.

Oaken defenders can grow truly massive, depending on

their age, the size of the grove they inhabit, and how many

attackers they have consumed. Conversely, a defender might

decrease in size if the grove is under stress, valuing the health

of the trees (and the dryads who depend on them) over its

own. In extreme circumstances such as drought, a defender

might  even  allow  itself  to  starve  for  the  sake  of  the  oaks

survival.

Environment: Oaken defenders inhabit the same tem-

perate  forests  as  the  dryads  they  protect.  The  presence  of

the defender is signaled by a faerie ring that encircles the

grove with mushroomlike growths (actually the ends of the

creatures limbs).

Variants of oaken defenders might instead take up resi-

dence in other sorts of environments. For example, an oread

(Fiend Folio 134) might have a rocky defender, which grows

from a magical gem, as a guardian. The waterfall of a fos-

sergrim (Fiend Folio 79) could host a cascade defender that

slumbers beneath the falls ledge.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An oaken defender is

a gigantic, disk-shaped being up to 15 feet across and weigh-

ing 5 tons. Six  exible limbs resembling tentacles sprout at

roughly equal intervals from its body, serving as arms or legs

as the situation requires. Its body has a woody appearance,

something like an exposed root, and large spikes protrude

from the top, as long as shortspears. In most situations, oaken

defenders bodies are covered with soil and vegetation, so that

they look like the earth has come to life.

The upper surface of a defenders central body resembles

an enormous, angry face, making it even more

intimidating in combat. It has an immense

mouth,  like  a  jagged  split  in  wood,  with

which  it  eats  defeated  adversaries.  Its

eyes are actually light- and heat-sensi-

tive bulges that let it pinpoint enemies

as well as a sighted being can.

Oaken defenders have no gender,

reproducing in the manner

described above.

Alignment:  Oaken

defenders  are  peace-

ful  by  nature,  as  their

alliance  with  dryads

suggests.  They  are

merciless  when

defending  their

groves,  however,

making  the  de-

cision  to  attack

intruders based on

the situational needs

of the dryads. As such,

most  oaken  defenders  are

neutral  good.  The  few  defenders

that fall outside this ethos are usually neu-

tral. If a groves dryads are corrupt, their defender

might also be wicked.

SOCIETY

Oaken defenders are solitary beings, but they are intimately

entwined with the dryads and the trees of their groves. This

link  is  both  physical,  in  that  they  are  sustained  by  their

charges, and spiritual, through the psychic and emotional

bond  they  share.  Oaken  defenders  see  themselves  as  bul-

warks  of  natures  defense,  and  they  are  very  con dent  in

their ability to protect the sacred groves.

Because they are so widely separated and spend so much of

their lives asleep, oaken defenders dont form communities

with others of their kind. They do maintain a sort of dream

link, through which they are subconsciously aware of one

anothers moods and concerns.

An  individual  defender  doesnt  have  a  name  but  rather

identi es  itself  by  those  it  guards.  For  example,  one  that

dwells in a lakeside grove inhabited by two dryads might be

known as Twin Sisters Shore.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Oaken defenders do not collect treasure. The dryads they

protect  do,  however,  and  these  fey  certainly  keep  useful

items left after the defender has dispatched a threat. Such

dryads  might  have  double  the  standard  treasure  for  their

Challenge Rating.

OAKEN DEFENDERS IN EBERRON

SAMPLE LAIR: THE FAERIE RING

Ancient  trees,  some  of  which  are  aware,  call  the  Eldeen

Reaches home, and in the depths of the forests dwell many

fey of all sorts. The western part of the Towering Wood is

a  manifest  zone  linked  to  Thelanis.  Here  fey  powers  are

augmented,  and  oaken  defenders  are  unusually  large  and

numerous.  The  nearness  of  the  Faerie  Court  might  have

produced the  rst defenders, born in the faerie rings and

mounds that spring from the earth in this region. The elder

Wardens of the Wood also maintain psychic contact with the

oaken defenders to supplement the forests defenses. Oalian

is said to speak to them in their dreams, and legend holds

that the same Gatekeeper druid who awakened the greatpine

was responsible for creating the defenders.

OAKEN DEFENDERS IN FAERN

The  followers  of  Mielikki  revere  dryads  and  other  wood-

land fey, and they consider it a sacred duty to nurture oaken

defenders. During the Four Feasts, worshipers bring offer-

ings of nectar to dryad groves and pour these carefully about

the faerie rings. The birth of a new defender is a rare and

joyous occasion, though tinged with sadness at the death of

the old one. When a young defender takes up residence in

a heretofore unprotected grove, the local clerics and druids

of  Mielikki  hold  a  special  festival  of  celebration  called

Greenhome. For three days, they pray and make offerings

of food, and they undertake services for both the grove and

its defender.

Three dryads inhabit a rugged hillside deep in the heart of

an ancient grove. An oaken defender protects them.

1. Faerie Ring

A clearing lies among the ancient trees. Low berry bushes cluster

here and there, and colorful mushrooms sprout in a ring 30 feet

across.

The area enclosed by the mushrooms is the resting place

of the groves guardian. The clumps of bushes grow around

the creature spines.

Part of the ring extends over a steep hillside. When the

guardian awakens, it can move horizontally out of the hill

if that is more advantageous.

2. Dryad Oaks

Three  magnificent  oak  trees  stand  out  from  the  rest  of  the

forest.

Three trees are keyed to this entry. Each is the home of a

dryad that has taken the shape of a more ordinary-looking

tree  in  the  surrounding  woods.  Unless  intruders  actively

damage  a  tree  or  engage  in  other  destructive  activity,  the

dryads remain camou aged and wait for them to leave. They

use deep slumber and charm person against threats, calling on

the oaken defender only if the opposition is more than they

can deal with.

OGRE

Great size and strength make ogres formidable foes in melee,

as detailed in the Monster Manualbut, handicapped by a

brutish culture and poor grasp of strategy, they cannot win

wars  or  command  territory.  The  savage  and  stupid  giants

rarely amount to much without the in uence of a more intel-

ligent leader. Many other creatures coerce or entice ogres

into aiding them and accepting their training.

This entry presents several examples of unusual ogres that

present interesting challenges to player characters: a spear-

wielding scout, a furious tempest, and a strange servant of

mind  ayers.

OGRE SCOUT

A  female  ogre  in  spiked  leather  rushes  forward  with  surprising

alacrity and lightness of step. As she closes, she points a spear the

Most ogres cant fathom the tactics of a scout, but sometimes

a member of another race takes the time necessary to train

an ogre for the role. Ogre scouts focus on melee attacks to

take advantage of their great reach and enormous strength.

With the extra speed granted by her class, an ogre scout can

charge as far as someone can throw a spear. Even so, ogre

scouts usually carry a ranged weapon to attack  ying enemies

or those who are otherwise beyond their reach.

The ogre scout presented here had the following ability

scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 14, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

An ogre scout prefers to attack from ambush, so that she can

land the  rst blow. If possible, she drinks her potions before

initiating a  ght. In combat, she stays on the move, maneu-

vering toward and away from foes using Spring Attack and

thus taking advantage of her skirmish ability. With her long-

spear in her hands, an ogre scout threatens squares 15 and

20 feet away. She threatens squares up to 10 feet away with

her spiked armor. When an enemy stands adjacent to an ogre

scout, she moves away, counting on her extreme mobility to

protect her from attacks of opportunity.

OGRE TEMPEST

Meetings between orcs and ogres are violent. At times, ogres

who win such battles take orcs as slaves instead of killing them;

at other times, the orcs triumph and take ogres captive. Orcs

recognize the value of ogres in battle, and they treat the cap-

tive giants with surprising fairness. If an ogre seems tractable,

orcs adopt it into their tribe, converting it to their worship of

Gruumsh. Most such ogres become barbarians, but orc tribes

that foster  ghters sometimes train ogres as tempests.

The ogre tempest presented here had the following ability

scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 15, Dex 18, Con 14, Int 9, Wis 8, Cha 7.

Strategies and Tactics

An ogre tempest acts as an orc tribes champion and mascot.

Wielding an orc double axe and covered with markings in

homage  to  Gruumsh,  an  ogre  tempest  making  an  appear-

ance on a battle eld can strike terror into the enemy and

rally shaken orcs.

An ogre tempest uses little strategy. His  rst attack is usu-

ally a charge while swinging his axe with two hands at a foe.

Then he moves slowly through the battle eld, making full

attacks  whenever  possible.  Brutish  and  stubborn,  an  ogre

tempest fells one foe before moving on to cut down another.

He uses Spring Attack primarily while  eeing from combat,

getting in a few blows as he retreats.

OGRE GUARD THRALL

An ogre wielding a greataxe lumbers toward you, its gaze unfo-

cused and its face slack. As it nears, you see four circular depres-

sions in its forehead, each like a scarred-over hole.

Echo Mind Blast (Su) Being mindless, ogre guard thralls are

unaffected by mind blast. When a mind flayer catches

an ogre guard thrall in the area of a mind blast, as a free

action, it can choose to emit a second, weaker mind

blast through the guard thrall. This secondary mind blast

is a 60-foot cone that stuns those caught in its area for

1d4 rounds; a successful DC 16 Will save negates the

stunning effect. An ogre guard thrall can echo only one

mind blast per round. If a mind flayer catches multiple

ogre guard thralls in its mind blast, it must choose one to

use this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Guard Mind Flayer (Ex) As long as an ogre guard thrall is not

flat-footed or immobilized, it automatically protects any

mind flayers within reach, granting each a +2 bonus to

AC. If a mind flayer commands it to do so (a free action),

a guard thrall can use the aid another action to grant that

mind flayer an additional +2 bonus to AC on the next

melee attack against it.

Mind   ayers  regularly  attack  ogre  tribes  in  subterranean

battles, consuming the creatures ample if underused brain

matter. The weak-willed ogres succumb readily to the dep-

redations of the illithids. The mind  ayers stumbled upon a

strange phenomenon during their feedingan ogre uses so

little of its primitive brain that it can survive having much

of  it  consumed.  Of  course,  treating  normal  ogres  in  such

a fashion leaves them comatose, but the insidiously clever

illithids were intrigued by the idea. They began a process of

captive breeding and experimentation that resulted in the

creation of ogre guard thralls, powerful but mindless ogres

with extraordinary healing ability.

When a mind  ayer is within 100 feet, what little remains

of an ogre guard thralls mind picks up the illithids unspo-

ken desires, and the living automaton does as the mind  ayer

wishes. This connection alone is not enough to make the

transformed ogres into adequate bodyguards, so the mind

 ayers  implant  psionically  receptive  crystals  within  their

skulls. The result is a powerful combatant capable of echoing

a mind  ayers mind blasts.

Strategies and Tactics

An  ogre  guard  thrall  uses  whatever  tactics  a  mind   ayer

commands it to follow. Much like a golem, it is incapable of

following complicated commands or thinking on its own.

Ogre guard thralls do not innovate, and they cannot inter-

pret commands differently for a new situation. Thus, most

illithids keep them close by, so they can direct the thralls in

everything. Commanding an ogre guard thrall is a free action

that any mind  ayer within 100 feet can take. A guard thrall

always follows the last command it was given. No illithid

has  established  exclusive  control  of  an  ogre  guard  thrall,

and no nonillithid has discovered a means of commanding

the creatures.

Mind  ayers that are expecting trouble keep ogre guard

thralls nearby. If combat begins, an illithid backs away from

its thralls in hopes of covering a wider area with its own and

the thralls echoed mind blast.

Dim-witted? Yes. Unpredictable? Yes. But useful,

General Aklarl, useful. Why waste the lives of our

soldiers killing these ogres when we can convert them?

Azthaket, Red Hand war sorcerer and

advisor to a hobgoblin general

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Ogres  rarely  operate  alone,  preferring  to  team  up  with

members of their tribe or another race. Training the chaotic

and brutish ogres as specialists takes a great investment in

time, materials, and effort. Such an outlay likely means that

such ogres are put to use as a core part of a military force. A

Hunting  Illithids  (EL  12):  Two  mind   ayers  travel

back to their lair along with four ogre guard thralls that are

dragging  nets   lled  with  stunned  and  wounded  captives.

The prisoners are human miners the mind  ayers intend to

experiment with and use as food. Periodically, a mind  ayer

takes a moment to use mind blast on the guard thralls and cap-

tives (affecting the latter twice). When they encounter other

creatures, the mind  ayers command three guard thralls to

attack. The illithids stand adjacent to and behind the fourth

thrall, using their mind blasts and other psionic abilities.

ECOLOGY

Ogres  sleep  through  the  day  and  hunt  at  night,  although

calling such forays hunting is misleading. The tribe mem-

bers arise at sunset and wander in small groups about their

territory for hours, attacking and eating any creatures they

happen upon. They supplement this diet with fruit and car-

rion  they   nd  along  the  way.  This  random  lifestyle  often

leads to some ogres being left hungry and agitated, which

causes in ghting and makes any encounter with them likely

to begin with bloodshed. Winter hits ogres hard, and a tribe

resorts to raiding to make it through that season.

Ogres mate and give birth much as humans do. A tribes

members are usually related, so when tribes of ogres meet,

mating  is  foremost  on  their  minds.  Ogres  lack  a  sense

of  emotional  attach-

ment. Despite their

greedy nature, they

arent  possessive

about mates or par-

minder that is  uent in Common or Giant accompanies a

specialist ogre almost constantly, except when the ogre is

given a very simple task or a suicide mission, or the minder

is an illithid.

Scouting Party (EL 6): An ogre scout, a bugbear, and two

hobgoblins are scouting for a warband of hobgoblins travel-

ing to raid a village. They move at half speed, hiding and

moving silently as they go, intending to avoid notice and set

up ambushes. The bugbear and hobgoblins hang 50 feet back

from the scout so their movement doesnt give them all away.

When the ogre sees an intelligent creature, she attacks if she

is spotted, but otherwise she waits and attacks from behind

when the enemy has engaged the others in her party. When

combat occurs, the bugbear charges in,  anking with the

ogre when possible. The hobgoblins try to stay out of melee

and ready actions to throw javelins at spellcasters.

Rear Guard (EL 9): Four ogre scouts travel about a mile

behind  a  warband  of  hobgoblins  on  horseback.  The  ogres

simply follow the obvious tracks of their masters through the

woods  and  attack  any  intelligent  creatures  they  encounter,

including anyone else who follows the warband. When  ght-

ing, the ogre scouts attempt to surround enemies, coming from

several directions and covering a wide area with their reach.

Tempest Unit (EL 10): An ogre tempest, two orc battle

priests (see page 115), and four orcs seek glory in battle. The

battle priests stay behind the ogre tempest and use all their

spells to heal the giant, while the other orcs charge in to

 ank foes.

Fighting Core (EL 12): An ogre tempest and two 4th-

level barbarian ogres (MM 199) form the  ghting core of an

orc raiding party. Accompanying these ogres are  ve orc ber-

serkers and a war howler (see page 114). The war howler leads

the group, chanting to bolster the ogres

and  other  orcs.  He  then  tumbles

into  melee  to  attack  vulner-

able  opponents  and  enters

a  rage.  Other  members  of

the  ghting core simply

charge foes, employing

 anking attacks if they

can.

concerned with a young ogres parentage. The feast-or-famine

nature of the ogre lifestyle harshly affects ogre children, so

that just one in three reaches maturity.

Environment:  Most  ogres  live  in  temperate  hills,  but

nearly any land can host an ogre population, especially if it

contains a cave or cavern network in which to take shelter

from inclement weather. Ogres also inhabit the grottoes of

the underground.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An adult male ogre is

about 10 feet tall and weighs roughly 650 pounds. Females

are  smaller,  standing  about  9  feet  tall  and  weighing  600

pounds.

An ogre guard thrall is sometimes gray-skinned and has a

vapid expression. When not commanded by a mind  ayer, it

does little but stand and drool. Indeed, guard thralls would

starve to death if they were not commanded to feed upon the

victims of their illithid masters.

Alignment: Small-minded, sel sh, and wrathful, ogres

are usually chaotic evil. Ogres taken as slaves by another race

might shift alignment if trained and exposed to consistent

treatment. Paladins hoping to convert ogres to the side of

light  should  think  twice,  though.  An  ogre  might  become

neutral evil or chaotic neutral, but only the most unusual

ogre becomes wholly neutral, let alone lawful or good.

SOCIETY

Ogres live in small, primitive tribes. An ogre chieftain leads

a given tribe by right of might, relinquishing command of

the group when he loses a battle to another ogre. A chieftain

that gives up any measure of authority loses it all.

Few ogres are capable of constructing items, so most use

crude weapons such as greatclubs and stone mauls, and they

wear hide armor. Ogres scavenge what they can from slain

foes, but since they possess little ability to think in the long

term, few take good care of such items, which often end up

broken or lost.

Similarly, ogres rarely construct dwellings, preferring to

live in caves, in ruins, or simply under the open sky. Some

tribes  copy  the  dwellings  they  see  other  creatures  using,

making crude tents of animal skins or ramshackle buildings

of piled logs, but such structures rarely stand for more than

a year.

Ogres seldom practice religion unless they are introduced

to the worship of a deity by another race. Those that have a

great deal of contact with orcs, even as enemies, might revere

Gruumsh. Ogres bossed about by other giants worship those

giants  deities.  Such  worship  consist  of  little  more  than

howling the deitys name in battle, but ogres can be taught

to pray in more conventional ways.

Territorial by nature, ogres come into con ict with any

other  intelligent  creatures  they  encounter.  Unfortunately

for ogres, they lack the wits to carry on protracted con icts.

They often  ee the area if their  rst couple of assaults cant

crush resistance.

Most  ogres  have  a  simple  mentality.  Other  creatures

can  force  ogres  to  do  as  they  desire  by  demonstrations  of

strength. Thus, ogres often end up living and working with

such creatures. Even much weaker beings can intimidate a

tribe of ogres by consistently defeating them.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Ogres have standard treasure for NPCs of their Challenge

Rating. They favor armor and weapons, but ogres subjugated

by another race carry whatever equipment is given them.

OGRES AS CHARACTERS

See page 199 of the Monster Manual for information on ogres

as  characters.  Ogre  guard  thralls,  being  mindless,  are  not

suitable choices for player characters.

OGRES IN EBERRON

Most of Eberrons ogres live in Droaam, where they serve in

the monstrous armies of that nation. Long exposure to other

races has caused the ogres of Eberron to be more cultured

if  not  more  intelligent.  Ogres  of  higher  intelligence  and

charisma appear regularly in Droaams armies and among

the wild ogre tribes.

OGRES IN FAERN

Although ogres live all across Faerun, their largest concentra-

tion is found in the Great Gray Land of Thar, which was once

ruled by a line of ogre tharkuls (kings). The Small Teeth of

Amn were also once ogre-held territory, until Crown Prince

Imnel of Amn prevailed during the Ogre Wars. In recent

years, the surviving ogres of Amn have  ocked to the banner

of the Sothillisian Empire, centered on the newly conquered

port city of Murann.

ORC

Orcs  are  among  the  most  dangerous  of  evil  humanoids

because of their great strength and relentless, warlike nature.

An orc at peace is an orc looking for a  ght. As detailed in the

Monster Manual, orc society is like an army waging continual

war against all other creatures. It pauses only to rest between

battles. Its allies are temporary.

Orcs are organized into tribes and clans with a hierarchy

based solely on personal power. As long as an orc chieftain

can continue to lead his tribe to success in battle, they sup-

port him. Loot is a measure of triumph. An orc horde might

fail to defeat an enemy army, but the orcs see the attack as

a victory as long as the warriors sack a few villages, carry

off plenty of food, drink, and treasure, and escape to  ght

another day.

This entry provides several archetypical orc adversaries: a

raging berserker, a feral bard, and a battle priest of Gruumsh.

In addition, two more unusual orc characters might threaten

the PCs: a cleric of pestilence touched by a grim deity, and a

spy who can pass for human.

An orc berserker is a skilled warrior who has proven himself

in combat, both in war and in duels against his rivals in the

tribe. He is vicious and sel sh. The typical berserker cares

only about acquiring personal prestige, treasure, and power.

If the tribe also happens to defeat a foe, so much the better.

Berserkers dont so much lead as have retinues of warriors

who want to share in their fame. The easiest way for an orc

warrior to ascend in the tribes ranks is to impress a berserker

and earn his favor. Orc chieftains look upon their berserk-

ers almost as prized pets. As tribal champions, berserkers

are the backbone of the groups  ghting ability. Their vic-

tories enhance the chiefs reputation. To keep them in line

and douse any thoughts they might have of taking power

for themselves, a chieftain lavishes his berserkers with loot

second only to what he takes for himself.

The orc berserker presented here had the following ability

scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 15, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 10.

Strategy and Tactics

In battle, a berserker allows his warrior hangers-on to engage

the enemy before joining the melee. He drinks his potions

while the warriors move in. A berserker expects his entou-

rage to create  anking opportunities for him, even if they

have  to  submit  to  attacks  of  opportunity  to  do  so.  When

 ghting, a berserker aims to deal as much damage as possible,

using Power Attack even before learning whether he can hit

his opponent.

An orc berserkers bluster hides a core of cowardice. He

prefers  to  terrorize  easy  targets.  Unless  a  berserker  has  a

number of warriors to back him up, he escapes from a capable

foe to fetch reinforcements. The tribe is simply a resource

that he uses for sustenance and protection. A wily orc ber-

serker knows that if he  ees a losing battle, he can always

join a new tribe.

War howlers are rare among orcs, but their talent for inspir-

ing blood thirst in the tribes warriors makes them highly

valuable.  Few  of  them  survive  to  become  practiced  war-

riorstheir  obvious  leadership  skills  make  them  prime

rivals  for  the  chieftains  supremacy.  Only  the  greatest  orc

warlords, those whose rule and talent are beyond reproach,

have the con dence to  eld many war howlers.

War  howlers  are  the  bards  of  the  orcs.  They  memorize

ancient chants of hatred against all other races. The clerics

of Gruumsh teach that the other humanoids stole the lands

that were the orcs birthright. The litanies list their enemies

many crimes, and the war howlers stirring delivery drives

the other warriors forward in battle.

The orc war howler presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 8, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 15.

Strategy and Tactics

True fanatics, war howlers lead from the front. An orc ber-

serker might have a coterie of admiring warriors, but a war

howler is a functional  eld commander. The courage a howler

stokes, along with his devotion to the orc cause, makes him

an inspiring  gure on the battle eld.

Orc war howlers seek out enemy spellcasters, correctly rea-

soning that such enemies can scythe through the orc ranks

with their spells. A howler starts a battle with his inspire

courage ability. He then casts cause fear on a spellcasters near-

est defender, and  nally he rages. Relying on superior speed

and his Mobility feat, he lunges past the remaining enemy

warriors to attack his chosen foe. Inspired orcs follow him

in, some of them tying up the enemys front-line  ghters and

others protecting the war howlers back.

An orc battle priest travels with orc raiding parties and war

bands to provide counsel and religious instruction. The priest

reads the omens, invokes prayers to Gruumsh, and makes the

proper sacri ces before and after battle. A battle priest uses

his spells to enhance other orc warriors. He grants them the

blessing of Gruumsh so that they might slay their enemies

and win glory in the deitys name.

Orcs compete for a battle priests favor by offering him

bribes and other gifts. They know that warriors who receive

spells from a priest have a much better chance of surviving

a battle.

The orc battle priest presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments: Str 10, Dex 12, Con 14,

Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 13.

Strategy and Tactics

A battle priest casts bless at the start of an encounter, then

casts  shield  of  faith  on  himself.  He  saves enlarge  person   for

another warrior who has shown skill and talent in combat.

These  priorities  change  if  an  enemy  cleric,  particularly  a

cleric of Corellon Larethian, is involved in the  ght. In this

case, the priest casts enlarge person on himself and charges

forward to slay his rival.

Battle priests illustrate the fundamental contradiction in

orc culture. They love war, exult in slaughter, and lust after

gold, jewels, and other loot, but they value their own skin

over the good of the tribe as a whole. A priest expects the

warriors to  ght and die for his bene t, as be ts a chosen

disciple of Gruumsh. Yet Gruumshs eye watches his priests.

The deity can forgive self-interested behavior, but he cannot

abide a cleric who cowers in the face of a true adversary. A

battle priest might hem and haw at the edge of a battle, but he

charges into the con ict when an enemy cleric is revealed.

of overcoming damage reduction, and they deal an extra

Horror 157.

Familial Charm (Su) A plague speakers mother acts as if

under a constant charm person spell generated by the

plague speaker. Heroes of Horror 157.

Orc plague speakers are the accursed representatives of Yurt-

rus, the orc god of pestilence. Plague speakers do not choose

their path but are born to it. Legend holds that once each year,

on the winter solstice, Yurtrus reaches out and touches an

infant orc in the womb. This orc is born with whitish skin,

pink eyes, and a slender, weak frame. Other orcs dare not slay

this abomination, for these traits mark the child as Yurtruss

chosen speaker.

A plague speaker is a hallowed  gure who strikes terror

into the rest of the tribe. Yurtrus is said to visit plagues upon

orcs who stray from Gruumshs directives. Orc tribes that go

too long without raiding their neighbors, slaying dwarves

and  elves,  and  despoiling  the  land  court  destruction  at

Yurtruss hands.

A plague speaker is an emissary of Yurtrus, but he is an

outcast. Although the rest of the orcs respect his position,

they also fear him, his blasphemous origins, and his vile god.

He is given a secure place to sleep (well away from the rest of

the tribe), ample food and drink, and a share of the treasure

from any raids. The speaker spends his days tending a small

shrine to Yurtrus, caring for the sick and the dead, and ensur-

ing that the chieftain does nothing to rouse the orc deities

ire. A plague speakers only company is usually his mother,

who idolizes him and might herself be a potent spellcaster.

The orc plague speaker presented here had the following

ability  scores  before  racial  and  template  adjustments,  Hit

Dice ability score increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 8,

Dex 10, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 13.

Strategy and Tactics

Since a plague speaker dwells near an orc lair, but usually

not  within  it,  he  often  becomes  aware  of  disturbances  in

the tribal domain before he is personally threatened. When

this happens, he readies himself to come to the tribes aid

and take intruders by surprise. Though the tribes warriors

gladly take advantage of any confusion he causes, they dont

 ght by his side. A plague speaker stands alone.

Whenever  possible,  before  entering  battle,  a  plague

speaker casts deathwatch. He then follows with aid, protection

from good, resistance, and shield of faith to protect himself, and

bulls strength to increase his damage potential. He usually

announces his presence with bane, followed by cause fear or

hold person against a foe that looks like a tough  ghter. If he

is able, he casts an area dispel magic and then contagion, which

he delivers on the  rst chance he gets after entering combat.

A plague speaker prefers to confer Yurtruss special gift of

contagion by using a claw attack on an opponent that appears

frail.

If the situation takes a bad turn, or if the orcs appear to be

on the verge of defeat, a plague speaker uses meld into stone

to escape his enemies. If the attackers destroy his tribe, a

plague speaker travels in search of a new home. Any orc tribe

he meets must grudgingly accept him, lest they call down

Yurtruss wrath.

Strategy and Tactics

A half-orc in ltrators goal is to gather intelligence for the

tribe and to organize an attack from within. She is not a com-

batant. An in ltrator either reports her  ndings to the tribal

chief or conducts a guerrilla campaign in the hours before

the tribe attacks. She might open a town gate and disable

the mechanism used to close it, assassinate or impersonate

an of cer in the militia, free jailed convicts to help spread

confusion, start  res, and so forth. If an in ltrator is exposed,

she  ees as quickly as possible. She marks those who have

harmed her and returns to hound such persons as soon as she

can, perhaps using a disguise to get close to her enemies.

A  half-orc  in ltrators  combat  pro ciency  is  weak  com-

pared  to  a  typical  orc  champions,  but  her  excellent  skills

make  her  a  subtle  opponent.  She  uses  Bluff  to  feint  or  to

create  a  diversion  to  escape  when  she  must   ght  a  tough

opponent alone, and she employs Tumble to get an

advantageous position on the battle eld.

If an in ltrator is with a tribe under attack,

she  uses  one  of  two  basic  strategies.  She

might  hide  at  the  edge  of  the  camp  or

in  a  rarely  used  side  passage,  trailing  her

A half-orc born to an orc tribe usually  lls the same

role any other orc might. Sometimes, a half-orc who

favors her human parent serves a forward-thinking orc

chieftain as a spy.

In most cases, a half-orc in ltrator is encountered

in a large settlement. She enters the area, usu-

ally posing as a mercenary or vendor, and

assesses  its  defenses  from  inside.  While

she  gathers  information  quietly,  she

also makes maps of the place. An in l-

trator might enter the towns sewers in

search of a secret entrance that avoids

the walls and their guards.

If  an  evil  cult  or  similar

group operates in the com-

munity, the in ltrator makes

contact  with  them  to  offer  an

alliance.

The  half-orc  in ltrator  presented  here

enemies and taking them from behind when they engage

other orcs. Alternatively, she might pose as a slave to insinu-

ate herself into a group of soft-hearted opponents, choosing

a strategic target to eliminate when the time is right.

An in ltrator is no fool. If she is unnoticed but cant use

her sneak attack, she doesnt reveal herself. Discretion is the

better part of valor, and she  ees if the situation looks dire

or if attackers target her for elimination.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Orcs are raiders and warmongers. They travel in bands and

are rarely found alone.

Individual (EL 1/23): A lone orc is a rare sight, and such

a wanderer is usually a scout for a larger group and a capable

individual. Even orc scouts usually travel in pairs.

EL 3: Bruuna is a half-orc in ltrator traveling to the near-

est settlement to scope it out for her tribe. She appears to be

a somewhat civilized half-orc.

Gang (EL 17): Young orcs group into gangs of two to four

to  undertake  small-scale  forays  into  the  territory  of  other

humanoids, looking to pick off travelers and raid outlying

farms and homes for glory and loot. Sometimes the members

of these gangs are redoubtable.

EL 5: Dagu, Gar, and Tareg form a gang that aims to waylay

trekkers on a nearby caravan trail. Tareg, an orc berserker, is

the groups leader, but even he listens to the counsel of Gar

the battle priest. Dagu is a typical orc warrior (MM 203) along

for the fun.

Raiders (EL 69): A squad of orc raiders includes up to

twenty warriors and a few elite individuals who lead.

EL 9: On Bruunas heels comes a crusade led by Shamoz, a

war howler. A berserker named Heg has taken up Shamozs

banner, along with four battle priests and a dozen warriors.

ECOLOGY

Orcs are ferocious creatures with no respect for life or their

surroundings.  Whenever  possible,  they  inhabit  natural

shelters or settlements built by other creatures, rather than

building forti cations from scratch. Wasteful and oblivious

to their consumption, orcs strip their territory bare if they

cant expand into new lands. Their inef ciency fuels their

desire to conquer.

Harsh  living  and  constant  warfare,  both  of  which  con-

tribute to their high mortality rate, de ne the existence of

orcs. These factors are offset by a strong reproductive urge,

and consequently a high birth rate. Orc females carry their

children  to  term  in  only  six  months,  and  multiple  births

are common. Some orc children die due to the tribes unfor-

giving  way  of  life,  but  many  grow  up  toughened  by  their

upbringing.

Orcs reach physical maturity in about thirteen years, and

most are ready to take up the axe for their tribe a year or two

later. Orcs age quickly, reaching old age after only thirty-

seven years.

R

O

118

Omnivorous and not the least bit picky, orcs can subsist on

provisions that other humanoids  nd unacceptable, includ-

ing carrion and the  esh of sentient creatures. Still, most

orcs prefer fresh meat and blood.

Environment:  Orcs  usually  inhabit  temperate  hills,

but they move into any region where they can exploit the

resources. Orcs still prefer areas with natural shelter from

direct sunlight.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An adult male orc is a

little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds. Females

are slightly smaller but often just as strong. All orcs have gray

skin and sport wild, coarse hair, but individuals vary widely

in appearance.

Alignment:  Orcs  are  brutish  and  bloodthirsty,  sel sh

and devious. They kill and destroy without a thought to the

consequences, and they dominate and persecute even other

orcs. Every orc craves personal authority and comfort and

is willing to eradicate rivals to secure these wants. As such,

orcs are often chaotic evil, with chaotic neutral being the

ORC LORE

Characters  with  ranks  in  Knowledge  (local)  can  learn  more

about orcs or half-orcs. A character with Knowledge (religion)

can learn more about orc religious practices. When a character

including the information from lower DCs.

Knowledge (Local)

DC  Result

10

This is an orc (or half-orc), a strong and usually

bloodthirsty humanoid. This result reveals all

humanoid and orc traits.

15  Orcs are bellicose and warlike. Their culture is

based on the right of might and the warrior ideal,

so they often take what they want and need from

others by raiding. They hate all other humanoid

races but reserve a special loathing for elves.

20  Orc crafts are based on war, religion, or survival.

Male orcs dominate, while females form the stable

base of an orc tribe.

Knowledge (Religion)

DC  Result

10  Orcs practice a dark religion centered on their war

deity, Gruumsh. The orc deities hate the elven and

dwarven deities.

The orc pantheon includes Gruumshs war

lieutenants; the mother goddess Luthic,

Gruumshs wife; Shargaas, the orc god of darkness

and trickery; and Yurtrus, the orc deity of death

and disease.

15

20  Oral orc litanies teach that the gods of other

humanoid races, particularly elves and dwarves,

cheated Gruumsh out of good places for his

people to dwell. This belief is the basis of orc

hatred and rage.

The orc deities sometimes bless orcs with unholy

offspring. These powerful young always rise to

positions of power within an orc tribe.

25

pqqqqqqqqqrs

most common exception. An orc individual or group might

adopt a differing outlook, but another creature often controls

or governs such orcsone they fear or revere.

SOCIETY

Orc  society  is  tribal,  and  it  is  based  around  the  ideals  of

survival, strength, fear, and war. These principles are, in turn,

founded in the orcs veneration of Gruumsh.

Orcs  consider  it  a  gift  from  Gruumsh  that  they  can

survive  in  places  where  other  sentient  creatures  cant  or

wont, but they have nothing resembling racial solidarity.

Each values his or her life and comfort above the lives of

others. An orc doesnt trust fellow tribe members enough

to become attached to them or be willing to sacri ce for

them, but seeks as much pleasure, power, and wealth as can

be acquired.

These  views  are  an  obstacle  to  racial  unity.  Orcs  focus

much  of  their  energy  on  gaining  and  maintaining  status

within the tribe. The strong rule the weak, the clever control

the foolish, and the feeble are left with nothing. This world-

view spills over into orcs treatment of everything. Continued

existence is a right only of the  t.

Survival  requires  resources,  however,  and  orcs  see  the

world as theirs for the taking. Orc religion holds that the

dwarven  and  elven  deities  unfairly  cheated  Gruumsh  out

of territory for his creations. So Gruumsh smote the lands

to make caves and badlands for the orcs. He also made his

children strong, so they could take whatever they needed

from others. He made them bloodthirsty and sel sh, so the

frail couldnt drag down the mighty.

Orcs learn these credos at an early age, mostly from cruel

experience.  Infants  are  weaned  quickly,  lest  they  weaken

the mother. As they grow, orc toddlers are more and more

expected  to  ful ll  their  needs  and  wants  for  themselves.

Some long-sighted orc mothers help their children in ways

that wont make the child dependent or incompetent, secur-

ing the young ones loyalty later in life. Children who succeed

at taking what they need become resilient and capable by orc

standards, and they earn a place among the adults.

Modeled  after  Gruumshs  absolute  authority  over  his

lessers in the orc pantheon, orc tribes are usually led by a

chieftain who is the strongest male in the tribe. Male orcs

have complete power over the fate of their mates and chil-

dren. Clerics of Gruumsh, who are also always male, are very

in uential. They cull the weak and undermine ineffectual

chiefs.

Females among the orcs are commonly subservient, and

nothing about orc mating is romantic or monogamous, with

the mightiest warriors taking as many mates as they can sup-

port.  But  every  orc  subconsciously  knows  that  those  who

provide for the tribal home and give birth to the next gen-

eration are the tribes backbone. Further, while many female

orcs do little more than bear children and gather food, strong

females are barred only from becoming clerics of Gruumsh.

Many powerful male orcs are  ercely loyal to their mothers,

giving such females sway in the tribe despite the appearance

of male authority. Magical power also grants in uence, and a

suf ciently strong female orc can carve out a place for herself

if she can defeat the males who would subjugate her.

Few professions have speci c gender associations in orc

culture. Male orcs happen to favor warrior roles, and gifted

females  favor  spellcasting.  This  latter  instance  foments  a

belief among orcs that noncombat magic is a feminine craft;

males who practice magic had better be useful in battle to

avoid the appearance of weakness.

Orcs  of  both  genders  are  averse  to  jobs  that  are  labor-

intensive with little quick reward. Thus, orcs take sentient

creatures as slaves. Slaves do the work no orc wants to do,

such as farming or mining. An orc who owns a slave gains

status, wealth, and personal comfort based on the amount of

work that slave provides.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Though  a  tribes  wealth  is  disproportionately  distributed

toward the top of the chain of command, orcs have standard

treasure for their Challenge Rating. Most orcs favor weapons,

armor,  and  portable  treasures  that  display  both  af uence

and ability. An orc berserker might string the eye teeth of

dwarves he has slain into a silver necklace, while another

orc might wield a bejeweled elven longsword to show his

enemies he has beaten a rich adversary.

ORCS AS CHARACTERS

See page 204 of the Monster Manual for information on orcs

as characters.

ORCS IN EBERRON

The orcs of Eberron number fewer than most other human-

oid races, and they live in inhospitable and remote places.

They are unusual in that they are neither as destructive nor as

evil, in general, as orcs in other settings. Most orcs live in the

Shadow Marches, and the Ironroot and Endworld Mountains

hold decent populations. Khorvaires orcs cling to traditional

ways, and those of the Shadow Marches live and interbreed

with humans. Many orcs still serve the Gatekeeper druid

sect that helped cut Eberrons ties with Xoriat during the

ancient war with the daelkyr. Too many orcs, however, have

turned against the ancient ways and now worship the Dragon

Below,  ghting their kin to release the horrors the Gatekeep-

ers trapped in Khyber.

ORCS IN FAERN

Orcs in Faern are varied. Those from the North and the

Spine of the World are known as mountain orcs, and they are

the oldest of their kind on Toril. The East is home to gray orcs,

which  are  more  civilized  and  devout  than  mountain  orcs

but no less evil. Rare in the lands lit by the sun, deep orcs,

or  orogs,  are  descended  from  mountain  orcs  that  became

trapped underground.

Staggering forward with an uneven gait, this moving corpse is a

large sphere of bloated, rotting flesh. Its bloodshot eyes dart back

and forth, and a gurgling sound issues from deep in its throat.

Diseased Touch (Su) Any living creature struck by a plague

walkers claws must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or

be overcome with racking pain and nausea, causing that

creature to become sickened for 1 minute. The save DC

is Constitution-based. Creatures that have immunity to

disease are not affected by this ability.

Putrid Burst (Ex) When reduced to one-quarter of its starting

hit points or fewer, a plague walker can use a swift action

to explode. This burst has a 30-foot radius and deals

3d6 points of damage to everything in the area. All living

creatures in the area are nauseated for 1 round; a DC 15

Reflex save halves the damage and negates the nauseated

effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a

+2 racial bonus.

If reduced to 0 hit points before it can activate its

putrid burst, a plague walker simply dissolves into a pile

of rotting flesh.

Bloated Target (Ex) The 4 penalty for firing into melee does

not apply to ranged attacks made against a plague walker.

This penalty does, however, apply to other creatures in

melee with it.

though that possibility rarely prevents clerics of Gruumsh

from making and using plague walkers.

Clever hobgoblin warlords order their archers to target a

plague walker when it comes into contact with the enemy, and

evil spellcasters typically use lightning bolt,  reball, and similar

spells against it. In addition to injuring those near the plague

walker, such spells often trigger the walkers putrid burst.

Intelligent undead, particularly those spellcasters that can

create these monsters, pair plague walkers with incorporeal

undead servants. If a walker explodes, its companions ignore

the effect and continue to  ght. This combination is particu-

larly lethal against enemies incapacitated by nausea.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

In  many  ways,  plague  walkers  are  undead  war  machines

set loose on the battle eld. An improperly deployed plague

walker  can  cause  as  much  trouble  for  its  allies  as  for  the

enemy, so these monsters are most popular with evil human-

oids and spellcasters, who have the skill and intelligence to

form battle plans and use group tactics.

Living Trap (EL 3): Temples of Hextor often use plague

walkers as living traps. The high priests order a pit trap con-

structed just inside the main doors to the temple area. When

intruders attack, one of the clerics arms the trap while the

rest fortify the temple. A plague walker stands within the

pit. When an intruder falls in, the spring-loaded cover snaps

back and locks in place, leaving the intruder trapped inside

the pit with the undead horror.

Treat this trap like a CR 2 pit trap (DMG 71), except that

the cover snaps back in place after it is activated. The cover

can  support  up  to  400  pounds.  It  has  hardness  5,  10  hit

points, and a break DC of 18. Destroying the mechanism

that holds the pits cover in place requires a DC 15 Disable

Device check.

Team (EL 5): A barghest employed as a scout by a hob-

goblin  warlord  accompanies  a  plague  walker.  It  shadows

the walker from afar and waits for an enemy to attack. The

barghest uses its spell-like abilities, such as crushing despair,

to hamper opponents while they deal with the plague walker.

Immediately after the plague walker detonates, the barghest

uses dimension door to appear in their midst and attack.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

A plague walker is an undead weapon created by evil mages

and clerics. Its tortured body is  lled with rotting  esh, dis-

eased matter, and other putrid  lth. In battle, it can explode

when suf ciently injured, showering the area around it with

sickening debris.

PLAGUE WALKER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can learn more

about plague walkers. When a character makes a successful

skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the informa-

tion from lower DCs.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Plague walkers are too dim to operate independently; they

are usually commanded in battle by their creators or another

leader. Due to their putrid burst ability, plague walkers usu-

ally roam in advance of their allies. Hobgoblins in particular

love  to  employ  these  creatures,  because  their  armies  and

 ghting units have the discipline to hold back until after a

plague walker detonates. Orcs and other chaotic creatures

rush  into  the  fray  and  get  caught  in  the  creatures  blasts,

ECOLOGY

As undead creatures crafted for use in war, plague walkers

have no place in the natural environment. Tales claim that

they arise as the result of a rare contagion, but in truth any

diseased corpse serves to produce these monstrosities.

A plague walker that becomes separated from its master

remains in place and attempts to ful ll its last orders to

the  best  of  its  abilities.  Thus,  a  walker  ordered  to  stand

guard deep within a dungeon might do so for centuries

until intruders disturb it. Although a plague walker is

barely intelligent, it can understand simple phrases

in Common and can be ordered to ignore creatures

bearing  a  certain  holy  symbol  or  speaking  a

password. Since a walker lacks the intelligence

to deal with complex situations or conditions,

its  must  rely  on  simple  signs  to  distinguish

friend  from  foe.  For  example,  a  plague  walker

might  be  ordered  never  to  attack  a  hobgoblin,  or

to attack only elves.

Clever adventurers who don an opponents uni-

form, display an appropriate holy symbol, or pull

off some other form of deception can confuse a

plague walker or slip by it unmolested. Thus, a

plague walkers master must command it care-

fully, since unclear or easily subverted orders

render the creature ineffective.

Environment: Plague walkers are found

wherever the dark secret of their manufac-

ture spreads.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A

plague  walker  stands  roughly  6  feet  tall  and

weighs 300 pounds.

Alignment: Created only to sicken and destroy, plague

walkers are always chaotic evil.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Creating  a  plague  walker  is  a  relatively  simple  process,

though its cost prevents most spellcasters from producing

the  creatures  in  great  numbers  outside  of  wartime.  Any

arcane or divine caster of 6th level or higher who can cast nec-

romancy spells can craft a plague walker. Doing so involves

performing a horri c ritual that requires 800 gp worth of

unholy  water,  the  corpses  of  four  Medium  creatures  that

died of disease, and two days of prayer. (Two Small corpses

are equivalent to one Medium corpse, and one Large body

counts as two Medium corpses.) At the end of the ritual, the

remains meld into a single plague walker, which obeys its

creators commands to the best of its ability.

A plague walkers creator can order the creature to obey

an underlings commands, effectively ceding control of the

creature. This arrangement makes it possible for armies to

 eld  plague  walkers  under  the  control  of  nonspellcasting

of cers.

PLAGUE WALKERS IN EBERRON

walkers  were  unreliable  during  large  battles  unless  they

were  massed  in  large  formations  that  could  not  be  easily

avoided.

Blood of Vol priests, particularly those with the time and

resources to create them in numbers, use plague walkers as

guardians and enforcers. One faction of the cult in Sharn

stations  plague  walkers  in  its  main  temple.  If  intruders

penetrate the inner shrine, the clerics run to a secure room,

lock  themselves  in,  and  throw  a  switch.  That  act  drops  a

portcullis, trapping the intruders in the temple, and opens

the secret doors to four cubicles, each of which contains a

walker. Even if the intruders defeat the walkers, the sub-

sequent explosions leave them in poor shape to handle the

clerics counterattack.

PLAGUE WALKERS IN FAERN

Plague Walkers  rst appeared centuries ago during the Rot-

ting War of Chondath. The process of creating plague walkers

has since spread across Faern thanks to the machinations

of the Church of Talona. The Red Wizards of Thay produce

plague walkers and sell them across the world. Since trans-

ferring command of a plague walker is so easy, the creatures

make excellent guards and soldiers for a warlord who needs

reliable troops. Crime lords and others who face treachery

from within their own ranks see plague walkers as intimi-

dating, perfectly faithful bodyguards.

DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial

bonus.

A quanlos can choose to inject a victim of its sting

attack with a potent magic toxin, instead of placing

its devouring larvae (see below). This poison saps

the victims will and makes it susceptible to mental

compulsion by the quanlos.

A quanloss puny intellect prevents it from

exercising a fine level of control over its thralls. The

creature lacks the sophistication to order a group of

dwarf artisans to build a castle for it, or to command

an elf wizard to use a specific spell to protect it.

Instead, it relies on a limited set of general commands:

attack, defend, gather food, and so forth.

A quanlos can control a number of creatures equal

to its total Hit Dice at one time. If it takes control of

a creature beyond this limit, it must choose one of

its thralls to release from service. Thralls are freed

immediately upon the death of the controlling quanlos.

Devouring Larvae (Ex) When a quanlos hits a Small or

larger creature with its sting, it injects the foe with a

small number of larvae. The target must succeed on

a DC 17 Fortitude save or become infested with the

larvae, which slowly devour the host from the inside

out. This abilitys save DC is Constitution-based and

includes a +2 racial bonus.

Treat this infestation as a poison that deals 1d6

points of damage as its initial and secondary effects.

The poison deals its initial damage as normal and

its secondary damage once per round. A successful

save does not end the effect. The infected creature

must continue to attempt saves until it dies, receives

a neutralize poison or remove disease spell, or is the

beneficiary of a successful DC 20 Heal check to remove

the larvae.

If a quanlos takes more than 15 points of cold

damage from a single attack, it cannot use its devouring

larvae ability for 24 hours.

A quanlos is an insectoid monstrosity that haunts tropical

swamps and marshlands. It is a  ercely territorial, solitary

creature  that  uses  an  insidious  poison  to  control  other

creatures. A quanloss thralls defend its territory, hunt for

prey, and serve as vessels for its youngliterally working

themselves  to  death.  Young  quanloses  burrow  through  a

hosts   esh,  eating  it  from  the  inside  out  as  they  grow  to

adulthood.

Because  of  their  ghoulish  means  of  reproduction  and

mind-controlling venom, quanloses are often called abyssal

wasps and incorrectly identi ed as a kind of  end.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Quanloses avoid mingling with their own kind. Instead, a

quanlos relies on its thralls to aid in defense, patrol its terri-

tory, and slay intruders. A typical quanlos controls several

weak-willed animals appropriate to its native environment,

such as wolves, bears, and the like. When faced with intrud-

ers, it commands such guardians to attack and watches the

battle from hiding. If possible, it darts in to seize control of

an attacker and turn it against the others.

A quanlos typically avoids direct con ict. It uses its larvae

to  sap  opponents  strength  or  to  encourage  them  to  leave

its territory for safer grounds. However, a quanlos without

thralls is exceptionally aggressive. It actively seeks out poten-

tial  victims,  targeting  lone  creatures  that  it  can  lure  away

without interference.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Unlike  the  insects  they  resemble,  quanloses  are  solitary

from  the  day  they  burst  forth  from  their  larval  hosts  as

full-grown creatures. Each is its own queen and, as with

mundane  insects,  does  not  tolerate  another  queen  in  its

territory. Characters are most likely to face a quanlos along

with its thralls.

Individual (EL 7): The farmers of a local village

tell  tales  of  the  haunted  swamp

where cattle, pigs, and people occa-

sionally go missing. The townsfolk

are  convinced  the  marsh  is

haunted, but in fact a quanlos

dwells there. This creature has

enslaved  a  pair  of  hunters

(3rd-level  human  rang-

ers).  If  the  PCs  enter

the swamp, the quanlos

directs the hunters to attack

them. To avoid killing these

innocent  beings,  the  PCs

must  overcome  them  with

nonlethal force or  nd and

defeat the quanlos.

ECOLOGY

Quanloses  are  something  of  an

oddity. They appear to be insects,

but  each  is  essentially  a  self-

contained  hive.  They  reproduce

asexually,  generating  anywhere

from  fty to  ve hundred eggs in late au-

tumn to early winter. A quanlos carries its

eggs in a thick, rubbery sac beneath its chitin-

ous abdominal plates. The eggs begin to hatch

in late winter, and the wormlike larvae imme-

diately  fall  to  devouring  each  other  and  any

eggs that have not yet hatched. By late spring,

only ten to  fty larvae remain, and the parent

quanlos enters its  nal reproductive phase. The

creature becomes more aggressive and begins to seek hosts,

attacking anything that wanders into its territory. The quan-

los uses its controlling sting to keep its victim still while it

injects  ve to ten larvae into the hosts belly. The larvae ges-

tate for a week to a month, devouring the creatures vitals,

then burst free as adults (these new quanloses are Tiny and

have 2 HD). The erstwhile nestmates, sated by their hosts

 esh, do not attack each other but scatter to  nd their own

territories.  The  hatchling  quanloses  reach  adulthood  in  a

year, and the cycle begins anew.

Despite their short reproductive cycle, quanloses remain

relatively  rare.  Roughly  three-quarters  are  slain  by  other

quanloses  within  the   rst  months  of  their  lives  as  they

search for territory, and a signi cant number fall to other

predators.

Q uanlos

Quanloses  subsist  primarily  on  a  diet  of  small  birds,

snakes, and mammals. They seldom attack anything even as

large as a Small animal unless seeking to inject a host with

their  devouring  larvae.  They  make  no  lairs  or  nests,  and

sages have never observed any sort of sleep cycle or dormant

period.

Environment:  Quanloses  favor  warm  marshes  but

can  sometimes  be  found  in  jungles  or  forests  in  similar

climates.  They  do  not  thrive  in  cold  regions;  the

low temperature renders their larvae dormant and

temporarily halts their repro-

ductive cycle.

Typical Physical Char-

acteristics: Quanloses are

approximately  4  feet  long

from  mandible  to  stinger,

with  a  wing  span  of  9

feet. When heavy with

larvae,  they  can  weigh

up to 120 pounds.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Quanloses  accumulate  bright,  shiny  objects

such  as  coins,  metals,  and  so  forth  for  their

simple nests. A quanlos might order a human-

oid under its control to divest itself of all such

objects other than weapons and armor. Unin-

teresting  objects,  such  as  scrolls  or  boots,

would not be part of a quanloss hoard.

Extracted  quanlos  venom  is  a  prized  com-

modity among those who use such substances.

The venom sells for 50 gp per dose, and an adult

quanlos yields 1d4 doses.

Quanlos stingers are prized in some regions,

where they are made into ornamental daggers

(and sometimes crafted into daggers of venom).

A complete stinger sells for 1,000 gp in regions

where this practice is fashionable, or 500 gp else-

where.

QUANLOSES IN FAERN

Quanloses have spread from the vast jungles of Chult, slowly

creeping northward and eastward into more civilized regions

A  sailsnake  is  an  unusual  breed  of  viper  that  uses  its   ns

to glide from tree to tree, or to coast from the top of a cliff

down into a gorge. It is often beautifully colored and always

aggressive. Sailsnakes are kept as pets or guardian beasts by

yuan-ti.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Sailsnakes are territorial creatures that attack without hesita-

tion, even against threats larger than they are.

A mature sailsnake has bright coloration, which is both a

proud display and a dire threat. At the approach of intruders,

the animal rears up,  ares its forward sail  ns (much as a

cobra spreads its neck hood), and hisses loudly. It grants just

one warning. If the opponent continues to draw closer, the

sailsnake lets loose a blast of venom in an attempt to drive

it away.

Sailsnakes spend most of their time off the ground, either

draped about tree branches or coiled on pillars, natural rock

formations, ruined walls, and the like. This puts them in posi-

tion to ambush potential prey or threats. When on the hunt,

a sailsnake lies quietly. When prey comes within range, the

snake hurls itself from its perch. It spreads its  ns as it nears

the target, expelling its venom spray at the same time.

Sailsnakes are hostile to others of their own kind, so the

creatures do not work together in combat. One serpent might

attack another in preference over other enemies. Sailsnakes

have only the most primitive intelligence and do not adapt

their standard tactics to new situations.

Sometimes yuan-ti use sailsnakes for recreational hunting

in the same way human nobles hunt with trained falcons.

The snakes can be trained after a fashion, learning to attack

a given target, but cannot learn complex tricks. A large part

of a snakes training involves suppressing its instinct to attack

other sailsnakes.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Characters are most likely to run into a sailsnake as a solitary

threat within a jungle or a desert ruin.

Individual  (EL  23):  Encountering  a  sailsnake  on  the

ground is fairly straightforward, and the encounter level is

the same as its Challenge Rating. A sailsnake that has the

advantage  of  height  and  concealment  is  likely  to  surprise

the party, making the encounter more dangerous.

EL 3: A steamy jungle,  lled with  owers and bright tropi-

cal birds, has overgrown the ruins of an ancient yuan-ti city.

On a vine-covered pillar, a sailsnake lurks.

Hunting Party (EL 59): Yuan-ti halfbloods enjoy hunt-

ing humanoids with their trained sailsnakes. Hunters might

be encountered singly or in gangs of up to four.

EL  8:  Ssivileth  and  Haassorass  are  a  mated  pair  of  half-

bloods  who  delight  in  hunting  down  the  wild  elves  that

inhabit  their  forest.  Ssivileth  has  a  Large  sailsnake  she

trained from childhood (advanced to 6 HD), while Haasso-

rass has only recently taken up the sport and is in the process

of training his pet (Medium size). Because its training is not

complete, there is a 50% chance that the pet will not obey his

commands and attack a random enemy or the other sailsnake

instead.

ECOLOGY

Sailsnakes  inhabit  warm  climates,  usually  in  colorful

milieus, and are not found close to civilization except when

domesticated by yuan-ti. They hunt small animals and magi-

cal beasts, and have a taste for shocker lizards. (They hunt this

Sailsnakes are mutated vipers that can glide. This

A sailsnake is an aggressive creature that sprays a

Sailsnakes might have been bred by yuan-ti, and

the snake people sometimes use these animals as

pets, guardians, hunting beasts, or even familiars

and animal companions.

dangerous prey only when they  nd an isolated individual,

and do not pursue if the lizard resists the venom spray.)

Sailsnakes attack larger creatures that threaten them,

and if trained to hunt, will strike without provo-

cation. They are preyed upon in turn by giant

eagles,  griffons,  and  larger  snakes  such  as

king cobras. A sailsnake also makes a meal

for  a  shocker  lizard  clutch  that  survives

its attack.

Sailsnakes  can  live  up  to  twelve  years,

but in the wild a life span of  ve to seven

years  is  more  typical.  The  mating  season  is

very short, just a couple of weeks in the early autumn.

During  this  time,  the  males  become  vibrantly  col-

ored and quest about restlessly in search of females.

Females are very picky and might not mate at all in a

season if they  nd no one to their liking. A compat-

ible pair stays together during this time. The sailsnake

mating ritual is a rare but wondrous sightthe pair

entwine in free fall, then separate and spread their sails

just before impact. The snakes go their separate ways after

the season ends, and the female locates a suitable nesting

area in the hollow of a tree. As birthing time approaches,

she becomes pudgy and sluggish, not moving from her nest

except in dire emergency.

Sailsnakes are ovoviviparous: Their eggs hatch internally,

and  the  young  emerge  from  the  mothers  body.  A  typical

clutch  contains  eight  to  twelve  hatchlings.  The  mother

watches over the young for a few days but then leaves them

to  fend  for  themselves.  A  newborn  sailsnake  is  ravenous,

quintupling its size within the  rst month of life. Its diet

during this time consists of tree frogs, tiny mammals such

as shrews or baby mice, and even insects. It reaches adult size

within a year.

Large  specimens  are  rarely  found  in  the  wild.  Yuan-ti

sometimes breed larger versions of sailsnakes for hunting

more challenging prey, or for service as guardians. A yuan-ti

druid might choose a sailsnake as an animal companion, so

that it gains additional Hit Dice but does not grow in size.

Environment: Sailsnakes are usually found in warm for-

ests, which they share with yuan-ti. Any warm climate will

suit, however, and some varieties of sailsnake prefer warm

deserts, especially among multicolored, wind-carved rock

formations.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical sailsnake is

4 to 6 feet long and can weigh up to 50 pounds.

Young sailsnakes have fairly drab coloration that camou-

 ages them until they are large enough to defend themselves

effectively. As the serpent ages, its scales become more bril-

liant, acquiring a metallic sheen. Streaks and splotches of

green, scarlet, orange, or blue are common. The sailsnakes

environment contributes to its color; minerals in the soil or

pigments from prey animals tint its scales. The sail  ns are

usually golden, bronze, or salmon-pink, with a  ne tracery

of blood vessels. Females are slightly larger than males, but

there is otherwise little difference between the sexes.

Alignment:  Sailsnakes  have  a  very  basic  animal  intel-

ligence and are incapable of moral judgments. Hence, they

are always neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Being animals, sailsnakes do not keep treasure. If found in

the company of yuan-ti, use the normal treasure for a yuan-ti

encounter of the appropriate level (sailsnakes might increase

the  encounter  level  depending  on  their  numbers  and  the

Challenge Ratings of the yuan-ti involved).

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Treat a sailsnake as an alternative animal companion available

to druids of 4th level or higher. Yuan-ti rangers sometimes

use them to help hunt down victims for sacri ces.

A spellcaster who wishes to take a sailsnake familiar must

have the Improved Familiar feat (DMG 200) and must have

an arcane caster level of 5th or higher.

SAILSNAKES IN EBERRON

In  Khorvaire,  the  sort  of  terrain  that  sailsnakes  favor  is

found only in the jungles of southeastern Qbarra. Still, the

creatures  are  not  common  there.  Most  sailsnakes  live  on

Xendrik, where they inhabit the ancient ruins along with

drow and yuan-ti.

SAILSNAKES IN FAERN

In Faern, sailsnakes are denizens of the Serpent Hills. They

are bred by the yuan-ti as more manageable variants of the

larger winged viper (FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting 309).

Winged vipers inhabit the same areas and sometimes prey on

their smaller relatives, although as often as not, a sailsnake

ends up feeding on its would-be predator.

Shadow Jump (Su) As the dimension door spell; up to 3/day;

caster level 1st.

The magical transport must begin and end in an area

with at least some shadow. A skiurid can jump up to 30

feet each day in this manner; this can be a single jump

or a combination of jumps whose distance totals 30 feet.

This amount can be split among several jumps, but each

one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

Chill Darkness (Su) As the darkness spell; 3/day;

caster level 3rd.

A creature within the radius of this effect takes 1d6

points of damage and also takes 1 point of Strength

damage unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Fortitude save.

The creature takes no further damage as long as it

remains within the area, but if it leaves and reenters, it

is subject to both types of damage again. The save DC is

Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

At the end of the effects duration, if any creature has

taken damage within its area, the shadows coalesce into a

small nodule, about the size of a peach pit, that provides

nourishment for the skiurid.

This ability has no effect on undead or creatures

native to the Plane of Shadow. The shadowy illumination

created by this ability is sufficient for the skiurid to use its

shadow jump ability.

Skills Skiurids have a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Climb,

Hide, and Move Silently checks. A skiurid can always

choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or

threatened. A skiurid uses its Dexterity modifier instead

of its Strength modifier for Climb checks.

A skiurid is a shadow-born version of a squirrel, disturbingly

familiar in appearance but undeniably malicious.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Skiurids operate in colonies, taking advantage of their natu-

ral agility and stealth. A nest of them uses chill darkness to

cloak  as  large  an  area  as  possible,  thus  providing  food  for

the entire group. Among creatures of animal intelligence,

however,  this  cooperation  is  a  matter  of  instinct,  not  rea-

soned tactics.

Skiurids prefer not to attack with their feeble bite, using it

only as a last resort when they are caught in melee. If things

go poorly with a chill darkness attack, they quickly disappear

into the shadows.

Skiurids are often encountered with other creatures of

shadow. Their chill darkness ability reinforces the hunt-

ing methods of the other creatures, which are not harmed

by it.

Go ahead. Laugh. I did, once. Once.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Skiurids might be accompanied by beings from the Plane of

Shadow or could be found in the groves of dark fey.

Colony (EL 510): Skiurids form colonies consisting of up

to several dozen individuals. They are alone only under extraor-

dinary circumstances (such as being caught in a trap).

EL 9: A colony of twenty skiurids inhabits a dark grove in

a forest inhabited by shadar-kai (Fiend Folio 150). The shadow

fey prize the coalesced shadows on which skiurids feed, and

they often drive other beings toward the grove to maintain

a high level of production.

Umbral  Banyan  Nest  (EL  1012):  Skiurids  often  live

in or near umbral banyans (Manual of the Planes 171), which

offer protection and a ready supply of captives from which

to drain life.

EL  12:  This  umbral  banyan  supports  a  colony  of  thirty-

four skiurids. They wait until the dark tree snares a living

creature, then blanket the area with their chill darkness.

ECOLOGY

Skiurids  are  native  to  the  Plane  of

Shadow  and  feed  solely  on  life

energy.  Unlike  shadows,  which

attack  victims  directly,  skiurids

blanket an area with chill dark-

ness  and  let  it  drain  life  force

from creatures that enter it. They

then  gather  up  the  nuggets

of  coalesced  shadow  and  store

them within their dens for later

consumption.  This  propensity

makes  skiurids  tempting  prey

for  other  shadow  creatures,

which  covet  the  concentrated

life energy. Shadow mastiffs and

dusk beasts (Manual of the Planes

169)  are  their  usual  predators,

but spellcasters also seek out the

coalesced shadow for use in nec-

romantic magic.

Skiurids  form  large  colo-

nies, allowing them to pool their

abilities  and  harvest  large  quan-

tities  of  life  energy.  They  often

live in or near umbral banyans. Coordinating

their  efforts  helps  the  tree  dispatch  its  prey

more quickly and allows the skiurids to harvest the dying

creatures life force before it succumbs. The relationship is

mutually bene cial.

A typical skiurid lives two to three years, with  ve years

being the maximum. It is mature at six months of age, and a

female can produce several litters in a year, depending on the

availability of food. Adults feed their young life energy; they

gnaw on a nugget of coalesced shadow to extract the nour-

ishment and then allow the pups to sip from their mouths.

A single nugget can sustain a litter of six to eight young for

one day.

Environment: Skiurids are native to the Plane of Shadow

but often end up in other planes of existence along with the

creatures with which they associate.

Sometimes skiurids get left behind accidentally when an

umbral  banyan  shifts  to  a  haunted  forest  on  the  Material

Plane. Despite the disruption, such migrants usually thrive

as long as they remain in the dark heart of the forest. They

are occasionally found with the bitter shadar-kai.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A skiurid is around 14

inches in length, excluding the tail. It looks something like

a gaunt, outsized squirrel, but a malevolent reddish gleam

shines in its eyes. Its body is a deep gray or black, and the

creature blends readily into shadows.

Alignment: Skiurids are interested only in feeding and

are inimical to most life forms other than those of the Plane

of Shadow. Their total disregard for other beings makes them

neutral evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Skiurids do not collect treasure, but their stores of life energy

are  prized  by  many  beings.  Necromancers  in  particular

seek out skiurid hoards and pay well for them; a nugget of

coalesced  shadow  is  worth  1,000  gp.  Skiurids  share  their

dens, so obtaining a hoard usually requires defeating large

numbers of them (as well as any other creatures found in

the den).

A skiurid nest typically contains one shadow nugget per

four adults, representing the excess stored by the colony for

lean times and for rearing young.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A nugget of stored life energy can serve as an optional mate-

rial component for necromancy spells. It has a 50% chance

of increasing such a spells effective caster level by 2.

SKIURIDS IN EBERRON

Skiurids are usually found in Mabar manifest zones. These

are most common in the Shadow Marches, but the jungles

of Xendrik might hide such deadly groves.

When  Mabar  is  coterminous  with  Eberron,  the  dark

places of the world become blacker and more dangerous. At

these times, shadow beings can more easily slip between the

worlds, and colonies of skiurids end up in earthly forests,

especially the fey woods of the Eldeen Reaches.

SKIURIDS IN FAERN

Devotees of the Shadow Weave, dark fey, and creatures of

shadow share a mystical connection with Shar, the deity of

dark magic. Such creatures not only inhabit her home, the

Plane of Shadow, but also favor areas of Faern where Shars

in uence is strong. The Darkhouse of Saeldoon (Faiths and

Pantheons 163) is an example of a cult devoted to the Lady

of Loss. Adding a colony of skiurids to its groves is a simple

matter. Perhaps the cult uses skiurids to extract life energy

from prisoners.

127

SPAWN OF TIAMAT

The  deity  Tiamat,  Creator  of  Evil  Dragonkind,  has  long

sought domination of the world for herself and her prog-

eny. For eons she has struggled against Bahamut, the King

of Good Dragons, in a con ict called the Dragonfall

War, and most people believed that this battle would

last for millennia to come.

Recently, however, Tiamat unveiled her latest and

most terrifying tactic. She created diverse and numer-

ous creatures with the blood of chromatic dragons

and sent forth these spawn to spread destruction

and evil. This incursion of evil dragonblood

creatures threatens the balance of the war

and, by extension, the world.

To  thwart  her  ambitions,  Bahamut

created  the  noble  dragonborn  (Races

of  the  Dragon  5),  but  the  challenge

of  fighting  evil  dragonkind

demands  even  more  heroes

than  the  Platinum  Dragon

can  produce.  Today,  Tiamat

has the upper hand. It might

well  fall  to  the  player  char-

acters  to  prevent  her  spawn

from  permanently  tipping

the  Dragonfall  War  in  favor

of evil.

Every  spawn  of  Tiamat  has  some  vestige

of the power of the Queen of Evil Dragons in its

blood. Many, though, are born not directly to her

but to individual evil dragons throughout the world.

Whether chosen by Tiamat herself or only by  ckle

chance, some chromatic dragon eggs hatch into the

spawn  described  in  this  section.  Usually  a  single

egg is so touched, but occasionally an entire clutch

produces spawn of Tiamat (which might not even be all the

same kind). A given spawn is born only to a dragon that

matches its color, which combined with the word spawn,

forms part of its name. Blackspawn raiders and blackspawn

stalkers,  for  example,  are  born  only  to  black  dragons.

Although spawn  rst began to appear within clutches of

dragon eggs, most of them breed true and now are rapidly

multiplying.

Evil  dragons  recognize  the  birth  of  a  spawn  of

Tiamat as a fortunate omen, a sign of their creators

favor. That said, spawn rarely remain with their parents

for long. They mature much more quickly than true

dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years.

Spawn of Tiamat usually congregate with other

creatures,  whether  in  packs  of  their  kind  or

with like-minded individuals of other races,

particularly  evil  dragons.  Reports  have

surfaced  recently  of  hobgoblin  clerics

and  warlords  gathering  spawn  of

Tiamat and other evil dragons for a

great battle. Whether this is part of

Tiamats  plan  for  the  Dragonfall

War or stems from the goblinoids

general antipathy toward other

races is unknown.

Regardless  of  their  place  in

the  world,  all  spawn  share  an

unswerving loyalty to Tiamat, which their

would-be allies would do well to remember.

The  spawn  of  Tiamat  also  share  her  undying

hatred of good dragonkind, and they look down upon

nondragons of all sorts.

Spawn of Tiamat in Eberron

Tiamat is not pleased with the attitude many of her chil-

dren have adopted. She is proud of the role chromatic

dragons played in defeating the  ends and the quori,

but she feels that they now waste time worrying about

the Prophecy instead of subjugating the world.

Some  chromatic  dragons  agree  with  her  and  have

rededicated themselves to her cause. In addition, she has

whispered  promises  of  a  return  of  the  great  Dhakaani

Empire to certain hobgoblin warlords in Darguun. Using

these contacts, Tiamat has been able to seed the world with

her spawn, and they are ready for when the call to battle

goes forth.

Chromatic dragons not allied with Tiamat see the spawns

arrival as a dire portent that must somehow be related to the

Prophecy, but they are oblivious to the true danger. They

continue to do that for which Tiamat condemns them: They

wait  and  watch,  hoping  to  learn  the  true  nature  of  these

new  dragonblood  through  observation  and  re ection  on

the Prophecy.

All manner of spawn now inhabit Argonnessen. The dif-

ferent varieties have begun to circulate throughout the world

and can be found in Xendrik, Khorvaire, and Aerenal. Few

have gained a foothold in Sarlona.

in Eberron.

Spawn of Tiamat in Faern

The   rst  spawn,  gifts  from  the  Dragon  Queen,  were

summoned  by  Tiamats  followers  in  Unther.  Her  temples

have been secretly breeding more and more spawn and smug-

gling them out of the country to prevent their discovery by

the Mulhorandi occupation force.

The church of Tiamat has since managed to spread spawn

throughout the Old Empires and beyond. Many lurk in dark

corners of the world, roaming swamps, jungles, and caverns

as they hunt their prey and wait for the call to join Tiamats

army.  Some  have  allied  themselves  with  the  Cult  of  the

Dragon,  though  that  groups  goals  never  take  precedence

over serving the will of Tiamat.

Rumors have surfaced of hobgoblins and spawn massing

around  the  Rathgaunt  Hills  in  the  southern  Shaar.  Their

appearance could indicate that the Dragonfall War is about

to spill over into Faern.

Blackspawn raiders are vicious hunters. They are proud to

be  descended  from  Tiamat,  and  they  revel  in  making  her

Strategies and Tactics

Blackspawn  raiders  favor  attacking  from  ambush.  They

prefer to operate in hunting packs, usually groups of two

to four. Together, they set up a good location to lie in wait.

If  the  prey  is  intelligent,  they  use  feinting  tactics:  One

raider attacks with a ranged weapon and then pretends to

 ee, luring the quarry into the ambush.

At the start of an ambush, blackspawn raiders are cun-

ning and even cooperate on attacks. They usually start by

concentrating on an enemy that can be easily surrounded

on the edge of a group. Once they are in the thick of the

 ght, though, their competitive nature interferes with the

plan. Aggressive and bloodthirsty, the creatures value per-

sonal glory and bragging rights above all. Thus, each seeks

to kill the biggest and best foe.

Good  dragons  are  raiders  preferred  prey,  and  against

a mixed group of foes, their  rst target. The blackspawn

raiders  lust  to  kill  good  dragons  overrides  their  innate

competitiveness,  and  they  work  well  as  a  group  against

such enemies. In these situations, they concentrate on a

single foe until its dead or dying, then shift their focus to

the next one.

Sample Encounters

PCs  are  most  likely  to  interact  with  blackspawn  raiders

as  adversaries.  The  hunting  party  is  the  most  common

encounter.

Hunting Party (EL 68): These groups usually contain

two to four individuals.

EL 8: Drago, Vthex, and Sseth are three young males all

seeking to impress the same female, Ssvess, who is leading

this  particular  hunt.  The  males  all  want  to  bag  notewor-

thy prey and succeed in the mission, but they also want to

impress Ssvess so that shell choose one or more of them the

next time she seeks a mate.

Warband (EL 1014): Blackspawn exterminators act as

captains of small groups.

EL 11: Korth, a blackspawn exterminator (ninja 6), leads

a hunting party of four raiders to bring down a very young

copper dragon.

Tribe (EL 17): A tribe usually consists of a war leader (ninja

10), two exterminators (ninja 6), four sergeants (ninja 2), and

sixteen adult blackspawn raiders. Accompanying them are

two dozen immature noncombatants. They also guard about

forty eggs.

131

Ecology

Blackspawn  raiders  are  nomadic  carnivores.  They  hunt  to

eat  and  arent  picky  about  their  prey.  Rats,  boar,  elvesit

doesnt matter. Some creatures taste better than others, but

theyre all edible.

Beyond hunting for mere food, though, blackspawn raiders

frequently kill for pleasure. Tracking,  nding, and bringing

down a challenging foe ful lls a primal desire. After a  ght,

they ritually sample the  esh of a fresh kill and drink a sip

of its blood. One kind of prey thrills a blackspawn raider

with the prospect of both the hunt and the great feast after:

a good-aligned dragon.

Besides hunting, blackspawn raiders are driven to repro-

duce.  They  do  this  through  laying  eggs.  Females  become

fertile about four times a year and  ght among themselves to

choose mates. Gestation takes approximately four weeks. A

female lays two to eight eggs at a time, each of which might

have been fertilized by a different male.

The eggs are durable, with thick, leathery shells. Each is

about 6 inches in diameter. In order to hatch, the eggs must

be  kept  warm  and  protected  from  violent  motion,  such  as

shaking.  After  about  4  weeks,  Tiny  hatchlings  emerge.  A

hatchling develops into an adult in approximately one year.

Environment:  Favoring  their  black  dragon  heritage,

blackspawn  raiders  are  most  at  home  in  warm  marshes.

However, they can live almost anywhere, and they move their

camps to  nd better hunting grounds. They might travel for

many miles to follow up a rumor about favorite prey.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A blackspawn raider

stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.

Females  are  larger  and  meaner  than  males.  Males  have

deeper  coloration  and  more  striking  green-and-black  pat-

terns  on  their  scales.  Except  for  these  minor  facets,  little

differentiates the two genders.

Blackspawn raiders are some of Tiamats spawn.

Blackspawn raiders worship Tiamat as their creator

and their god.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Alignment: Blackspawn raiders are always chaotic evil.

Tiamat bestowed much of the look and all the philosophy of

black dragons upon these spawn. Social codes forbid killing

other blackspawn raiders or directly hindering their ability

to reproduce, but everything else is fair game in the drive to

advance personal status.

Society

Blackspawn raiders call themselves the Children of Tiamat.

Their lives focus on Tiamat and manifesting her will in the

world. They revere her as both the literal mother of their race

and their spiritual mother.

If a raider sights a good dragon or the tribe gains infor-

mation  leading  to  a  good  dragons  lair,  everyone  in  the

community bands together. Petty rivalries and social machi-

nations are temporarily laid aside. Everyone works toward the

common goal of hunting down and killing this favored prey.

(The normal sel shness, greed, and one-upmanship resume

once the hunt is over.)

If a group is skillful and lucky enough to bring down the

dragon, an extended holiday ensues. The community moves

the corpse to its encampment or camps beside a corpse that

is  too  large  to  move.  A  tremendous  feast  celebrates  those

who actively participated in the hunt. The whole commu-

nity shares the dragon meat, eating it fresh, raw, and bloody.

Consuming  the   esh  is  an  act  of  worshipa  paean  to

Tiamatand the blackspawn raiders use every scrap. Any

meat left from the feast is dried and smoked; the tribe wont

hunt again until they have eaten the entire corpse.

Creating  more  spawn  is  the  second  holy  duty  of  black-

spawn raiders. The leaders of a tribe are a council of females,

each of whom has at least  ve living adult children, earning

her the honori c spawnmother. The spawnmothers handle

all the daily duties of leadership: allocating resources and

deciding whether the tribe should move, and if so, where it

should go. They also make all the grand strategic decisions.

This  form  of  matriarchy  among  a  chaotic  evil  people

leads to constant machinations and politics. The status of a

spawnmother is often in  ux: If her living adult progeny ever

become fewer than  ve, she loses her position. Thus, spawn-

mothers favor enterprises that protect their children (and thus

their positions) while putting their rivals offspring at risk.

One common example is stealing eggs from a rival and replac-

ing them with infertile ones or even arti cial replicas.

A chosen few blackspawn raiders are indoctrinated into a

secret society within the tribe and trained in combat tech-

niques to become even more dangerous killers. This ninja

training  creates  the  blackspawn  exterminators,  the  most

experienced  of  whom  become  war  leaders.  These  tactical

leaders handle military matters and run individual hunts,

and they might be sent to dispatch any signi cant threat to

the tribe or the spawnmothers.

Being a spawnmother does not preclude tactical leader-

ship. A fertile female with suf cient training could be both

a  spawnmother  (social  leader)  and  an  exterminator  (hunt

leader).  Its  advantageous  for  even  a  very  fertile  female  to

hone her ninja skills, since the position of spawnmother is

so transitory.

Most races and groups acquainted with blackspawn raiders

do not seek diplomatic relations with these brutal hunters.

near a dragon corpse.

1. War Leaders Tent: In addition to housing the war leader,

this tent is where planning takes place. Hunting parties gather

here before setting out, consulting maps, interviewing scouts,

and discussing where to travel and seek prey.

Hand-drawn maps on a rough folding table depict the local

area,  showing  major  geographic  features  and  trails.  A  DC

A few large, misshapen sacks contain dried meat and other

surplus supplies, and they are also used as improvised seat-

wealth in the form of potions.

A  blackspawn  exterminator  has  standard  treasure  for  an

NPC of Challenge Rating 10, about 16,000 gp. Exterminators

use a variety of poisons, which is included in their treasure.

Blackspawn Raiders with Class Levels

Blackspawn raiders favored class is the ninja from Complete

Adventurer.  They  are  sneaky  killers.  (If  you  are  not  using

Complete Adventurer in your campaign, substitute rogue as

Blackspawn Raiders in Eberron

Eberron blackspawn raiders feel less certainty about their

origin,  but  they  suspect  the  ful lling  of  the  draconic

Prophecy would be very bad for their race. They take plea-

sure  in  killing  dragonmarked  characters  and  dragons  of

any alignment, believing that doing so will stave off a great

catastrophe.

Deadly Charge (Ex) A blackspawn stalker typically begins

a battle by charging at an opponent. In addition to the

normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows

the blackspawn stalker to make a single gore attack

with a +15 attack bonus that deals 4d6+9 points of

damage.

Web (Ex) A blackspawn stalker can throw two webs per

round, up to eight times per day. Each of these attacks

is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum

range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and

is effective against targets up to Huge size. The web

anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.

Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5

bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on

or grab while pulling free.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20

Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 20 Strength

check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. The web

has 12 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage

from fire.

A blackspawn stalker can create sheets of sticky

webbing up to 20 feet square. It usually positions

these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try

to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures

must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web;

otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as

though by a successful web attack. Each 5-foot section

of webbing has 12 hit points and damage reduction

5/.

A blackspawn stalker can move across its own

sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the

exact location of any creature touching the web.

up to 60 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch

This acid damage increases by 1d6 for every 2

additional HD.

Tiamats Blessing (Acid) (Su) All spawn of Tiamat within 5

feet of a blackspawn stalker gain immunity to acid.

Skills Blackspawn stalkers have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened.

Blackspawn  stalkers  are  consummate  hunters  but  lack  the

intelligence of their draconic progenitors. They were created

by Tiamat to instill fear and panic in their prey, from which the

Queen of Evil Dragons draws strength. Blackspawn stalkers

are voracious, always on the lookout for their next meal.

Strategies and Tactics

Blackspawn  stalkers  are  patient.  They  set  traps,  typically

laying webs across the ground or up in trees, as the situa-

tion demands. If the prey manages to evade its web, a stalker

readily takes a more active role, usually slinging webs at the

quarry. It  rst attempts to weaken stronger prey by spitting

acid, then charges in for a devastating gore attack.

Blackspawn stalkers are immune to acid. Their

saliva is extremely acidic, and the stalkers can spit

it quite a distance. They can spin webs and sling

webbing at their prey when hunting.

A blackspawn stalker frequently begins combat by

charging and goring an opponent with its massive

horns. Male blackspawn stalkers also use their

horns in contests of strength to win a mate.

Blackspawn stalkers prefer to hunt from the safety

of trees, using their climbing abilities to gain an

advantage over their prey.

Blackspawn stalkers mate annually, creating as

many as six nests of eggs. Many large birds or

birdlike creatures prey upon the eggs.

Sample Encounters

Blackspawn  stalkers  are  solitary  creatures,  though

mated pairs can be encountered. True dragons (particu-

larly black, but sometimes green or red) employ these

creatures as guards or assistant hunters.

Pair (EL 11): Two blackspawn stalkers have taken

up  residence  in  the  swamp  just  to  the  north  of  the

Celadon forest. They have created six nests lined with

eggs, and they are now hunting for prey to place in

these nests for their hungry offspring to feed upon

once hatched.

Hunters (EL 1012): Aconnax, a greenspawn sneak

raid leader (see page 148), rides a blackspawn stalker on

the fringes of the Dragon Queens territory. The two

patrol in search of interlopers, especially adventurers,

then attempt to ambush them. If they run into trouble,

they retreat to a preset fallback point where two other

blackspawn stalkers lair.

Ecology

Blackspawn stalkers are nearly mindless creatures that

view  each  other  as  competition  for  food  and  mates.

They look favorably upon strength, however, and take

pride in serving a powerful master. Blackspawn stalk-

ers willingly serve true dragons and other spawn. They

prefer black dragons, but red and green dragons also

admire the hunting capabilities of these horrid crea-

tures and sometimes team up with them. If a dragon

or  spawn  mistreats  a  blackspawn  stalker,  or  demon-

strates weakness, the servant leaves, often turning on

the master  rst.

Blackspawn  stalkers  see  Tiamat  as  their  ultimate

master, and they believe that through breeding, they

can create the ultimate servantone that the Dragon

Queen might  nd worthy enough to take as her own.

When left to their own devices, or if their master is slain,

blackspawn stalkers reproduce as much as possible.

When blackspawn stalkers mate, they do so for life, unlike

the arachnids they resemble. A mated pair lays eggs annually,

distributing them in up to half a dozen nests to improve the

chances of survival. The eggs are an important food source

for many other creatures, so very few manage to hatch. On

rare occasions, when an entire clutch remains undisturbed,

the hatchlings go on a massed rampage, killing everything

they encounter.

Blackspawn  stalkers  are  carnivores.  With  their  unique

combination  of  features,  they  can  switch  readily  between

biting and tearing at prey or dissolving it with acidic saliva

and sucking up the remains.

Like dragons, blackspawn stalkers grow larger and more

powerful with age. This is especially true of the most capable

hunters, particularly those used to hunt good dragons (and

allowed to consume the remains afterward).

Environment: Blackspawn stalkers prefer warm or tem-

perate swamps, but they can adapt to dense forests as well.

Wherever they live, they seek out the upper branches of trees

where they build their nests and lay eggs.

stalker stands from 6 to 8 feet tall, with a leg span of 7 to

10 feet in diameter. It can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds.

Females tend to be larger, dominating their male counter-

parts.

Alignment: Blackspawn stalkers are always chaotic evil.

They value strength to subjugate others, but they also seek

an acceptable master to serve.

Typical Treasure

Blackspawn stalkers have treasure typical for their Challenge

Rating, about 4,500 gp. Unlike their draconic progenitors,

these creatures disperse their treasure among many hidden

locations, rather than keeping it all in one great hoard.

Blackspawn Stalkers in Eberron

an electricity burst as a standard action once every

1d4 rounds. Any creature within 10 feet must succeed

on a DC 16 Reflex save or take 4d6 points of electricity

save DC is Constitution-based.

The burst damage increases by 1d6 for each

They  ght to the death only when commanded to do so by

an evil dragon or a follower of Tiamat.

Bluespawn ambushers that serve as guardians lure intrud-

ers into tight, dangerous quarters such as narrow corridors

or  trails.  The  ambushers  remain  out  of  sight,  beneath  the

surface,  then  burst  from  the  ground  behind  their  foes  to

attack. This maneuver cuts off the intruders escape route,

while the ambushers electricity bursts serve as beacons to

draw more guards or alert their masters.

Sample Encounter

Bluespawn  ambushers  hunt  in  packs,  usually  containing

an  equal  number  of  males  and  females.  An  odd  number

likely  represents  a  group  of  males  protecting  a  nest  or  a

group of females out hunting after giving birth (see Ecol-

ogy below). Either makes for a more dangerous encounter,

since bluespawn ambushers become much more aggressive

in such cases.

Pack (EL 9 or 11): Six males let loose lightning bursts into

the night to call back females from the hunt as their young

hatch. The young have not yet emerged from the eggs, and the

females are some distance off. PCs who investigate the lights

on the horizon might encounter the six females dragging

BLUESPAWN AMBUSHER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can learn more

about bluespawn ambushers. When a character makes a suc-

cessful  skill  check,  the  following  lore  is  revealed,  including

the  information  from  lower  DCs.  Those  who  recognize  the

creatures ancestry can also use Knowledge (religion) to learn

more.

Knowledge (Arcana)

Bluespawn ambushers worship Tiamat as their progenitor,

and  they  willingly  serve  evil  dragons  and  other  followers

of  Tiamat  as  guards  and  hunters.  Although  dim-witted,

theyre more than simple beasts and are capable of cunning

tactics.

Strategies and Tactics

Bluespawn ambushers live up to their name. They hunt in

tight-knit  packs  containing  as  many  as  a  dozen  members.

A pack roams on the surface or lies in wait near a source of

water until prey approaches, then swiftly disappears below

the ground. Tunneling, the bluespawn ambushers surround

their prey, and then claw their way to the surface. Upon resur-

facing, they blast the prey with their electricity burst.

The  ambushers  dont  expect  anything  to  survive  this

assault, so they remain on the surface for a moment after-

ward to verify the kill. Should prey live to  ght back or  ee,

they burrow underground again the next round. Thereafter,

each bluespawn ambusher pursues the quarry from under-

ground,  rising  to  the  surface  to  use  its  electricity  burst,

then returning below the surface to wait until the ability

recharges.

If this strategy doesnt work, bluespawn ambushers rely

on their claw and gore attacks. Ultimately, they prefer to live

and  ght another day, so they typically  ee if overwhelmed.

food back to their nests or the whole pack of

twelve as they await the emergence of the

hatchlings.

Ecology

Bluespawn ambushers eat anything

that falls to their electricity burst

but rarely trouble themselves with

Tiny or smaller prey. Instead, they

wait for a suitable number of Small

or  larger  creatures  before  spring-

ing  their  ambush.  A  single

ambusher can subsist for more

than a month on a Small crea-

ture.

After  a  large  meal,  bluespawn

ambushers retreat underground

to  rest.  They  lie  just  beneath

the  surface,  with  only  the

tips  of  their  noses  exposed

(allowing them to breathe). Most

intelligent creatures recognize this

and understand the danger (by suc-

ceeding on a Spot check opposed by

the bluespawn ambushers Hide check

to notice it). Scavengers, attracted to the

carcasses, sometimes fall prey to a second surprise attack

by the bluespawn ambushers.

Bluespawn ambushers mate for life and produce offspring

only once every ten years. After laying eggs underground,

the  females  leave  to  hunt  while  the  males  watch  over  the

clutches. A male signals the hatching with electricity bursts,

summoning the female so that both parents can attend the

emerging young.

Other  spawn  of  Tiamat  value  bluespawn  ambushers  as

guardians and sentinels. The ambushers ability to lurk below

ground and their tremorsense form a potent combination.

Blue dragons, powerful half-dragons, and blackspawn raid-

ers all make use of these creatures. Though ambushers are

desert natives, their masters bring them across the world on

campaigns in Tiamats name.

Environment: Bluespawn ambushers prefer warm des-

erts,  especially  those  with  dunes  of  loose  sand  that  make

burrowing  easier.  In  such  environments,  packs  of  four  to

twelve  ambushers  migrate  from  watering  hole  to  oasis  to

creek, preying on creatures that go to such places to drink.

Their travel path depends on the season and what prey is

likely to be available in given areas, and it rarely changes.

Some desert dwellers have learned these migration patterns

and  avoid  watering  holes  when  bluespawn  ambushers  are

likely to be nearby. They might travel far across the desert

to avoid the voracious hunters.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Bluespawn ambushers

are thick-bodied, burly creatures. A typical specimen stands

about 3 feet tall at the shoulder, and its body is about 4 feet

long and nearly as wide. With its dense muscles and thick

scales, it weighs about 350 pounds.

Female bluespawn ambushers can be distinguished from

males  by  their  slightly  narrower  heads  and  longer  horns.

Alignment: With their simple agenda and loyalty to blue

evil.

Typical Treasure

Bluespawn ambushers rarely have any treasure, but they do

share a hoarding instinct with dragons. Should their prey

be carrying treasure, ambushers bury the spoils near a water

source on their migration route so they can admire it as they

pass through. Only a 20% chance exists that they have coins,

goods, or items.

Bluespawn Ambushers in Eberron

Most bluespawn ambushers live mainly in the Blade Desert

of  Valenar.  Scholars  trace  their  ancestry  to  a  blue  dragon

named Blaphinex, who was killed by other dragons as pun-

ishment for what they saw as unnatural interest in the beasts

of the deserts.

Bluespawn Ambushers in Faern

Bluespawn ambushers can be found wherever blue dragons

live, but most dwell in Unther, the seat of Tiamats power.

Several packs serve Hurthoogul, a male hobgoblin worshiper

of the Chromatic Dragon, who claimed the title Talon of

Tiamat. He has marshaled a few tribes of goblins and hob-

goblins into a small army on the Black Ash Plain, and he

hopes to gather more forces to expel Mulhorands in uence

and gain dominance over the nation. The Mulhorandi have

not discovered this fact.

an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful

critical hit.

Lightning Sweep (Su) 60-ft. cone, 3/day, standard action,

damage 6d6 electricity, Reflex DC 20 half. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

The lightning sweep damage increases by 1d6 for

Electricity Shield (Su) A bluespawn burrowers body

generates a prodigious electrical charge that arcs to

nearby creatures. Any creature that strikes or touches

a bluespawn burrower with its body or a weapon, or

that grapples a bluespawn burrower, automatically

takes 2d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 20

half). A creature wielding a metal weapon takes a 2

circumstance penalty on this saving throw. The save DC

is Constitution-based. A creature takes damage from this

ability only once per round.

Roaming the desert wastes in organized packs, bluespawn

burrowers are used by blue dragons to scout their domains.

Other spawn of Tiamat employ bluespawn burrowers to dig

out  defensive  forti cations  and  erect  glass  monuments  to

their dread queen.

Strategies and Tactics

In  the  wild,  a  solitary  bluespawn  burrower  bursts  from

beneath  the  sand,  attempting  to  grab  the  closest  enemy

while using its tail slap and lightning sweep to clear away

other foes. If it is seriously injured (in game terms, below 40

hit points), it retreats under the sand, possibly dragging an

opponent with it.

Bluespawn burrowers usually hunt in groups. They hide

underground with enough distance between them so that

they can simultaneously attack from multiple sides.

These creatures are particularly dangerous when led by

dragons or more intelligent spawn of Tiamat, who can guide

their tactics. In these situations, the burrowers focus on a

single target in melee and methodically eliminate it while

overlapping their lightning sweeps.

Sample Encounters

Bluespawn

burrower

Whether attacking enemies singly or as a group, bluespawn

burrowers always try to use the surrounding terrain to best

advantage. They are most likely to be found in small packs

of two to four.

Bluespawn  burrowers

also  serve  the  armies

of  Tiamat  as  shock

troops  that  can

burrow  into  an

enemy  fortress

and  destroy  it

from within.

Individual

(EL  9):  A  single

bluespawn  bur-

rower  might  lurk

near the entrance to a

blue dragons lair, seek

a  new  hunting  ground

for  its  pack,  or  launch  an

initial foray into a forti ca-

tion or settlement to gauge

its defenses.

Guard  Pack  (EL  11

13):  Occasionally  blue

dragons  or  other  spawn

organize  bluespawn  bur-

rowers into units that patrol

their territory.

EL  13:  A  quartet  of  blue-

spawn  burrowers  patrol

the area around the lair of

their  mistress,  the  blue

wyrm  Thunder  Rose.

They have instructions to

waylay any possible threat,

and  they  report  daily  on

the  progress  of  any  crea-

tures too powerful for them

to deal with.

Ecology

Bluespawn  burrowers  usually  form  small  packs,  serv-

ing  blue  dragons  or  spawn  that  are  more  powerful.  The

creatures  organize  themselves  according  to  age,  size,  and

ability: Larger members make good soldiers and hunters,

while smaller, weaker combatants create and maintain the

groups home.

Bluespawn burrowers are ferocious carnivores but can go

many  days,  sometimes  weeks,  without  food;  they  expend

little energy when resting in their burrows. Despite their

size, they do not require much water. However, they lurk near

oases and watering holes, which draw the desert creatures on

which they prey. Once they have depleted the food resources

of one area, they move on to the next promising spot.

Other spawn of Tiamat launch expeditions into the desert

territories of bluespawn burrowers to enlist the beasts into

their armies. The spawn direct the burrowers to fuse sand

into glass with their lightning, creating great monoliths that

declare the spawns service to Tiamat.

Environment: Bluespawn burrowers live in the deepest

regions  of  the  desert,  typically  near  an  oasis  or  wherever

other creatures might congregate.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An average bluespawn

burrower is about 5 feet high and 8 to 10 feet in length, weigh-

ing as much as 4,000 pounds. The creatures start life with

dusky gray coloration, and as they grow, their scales change

to a deep, dark blue. In the light of the sun, an adult bur-

rower is somewhat pearlescent.

Like  dragons,  bluespawn  burrowers  grow

larger  and  more  powerful  with  age.  As

they  increase  in  size,  they  shed  their

skins like great serpents.

Alignment: Bluespawn burrowers

are always lawful evil. These creatures

highly value loyalty and obedience.

Typically, their association with

blue dragons aligns the goals

of  the  group  with  that  of

their draconic masters.

When  left  to  their

own  devices,  they

are  less  concerned

with  controlling

an area than with

simply eating.

Typical Treasure

Bluespawn  burrowers

have  treasure  typical

for  their  Challenge

Rating,  about  4,500

gp. Most of this trea-

sure  lies  among  the

remains  of  past  vic-

tims, half buried in the sands around the oases where

the burrowers lurk.

Bluespawn Burrowers in Eberron

Bluespawn burrowers roam a hidden desert deep in the inte-

rior of Xendrik, awaiting the day their blue dragon masters

will return from Argonnessen to lead them against the giants

who remain in the continents jungles.

Bluespawn Burrowers in Faern

Roaming  the  sands  of  the  deep  Calim  desert,  bluespawn

burrowers are thought to serve blue dragon masters in that

inhospitable land. Scholars speculate that one band of the

creatures has come under the control of a powerful mummy

lord that has turned the creatures into undead.

Dragon Slayer (Su) A bluespawn godslayer deals an

extra 2d6 points of damage when it hits a dragon or

dragonblood creature.

Outsider Slayer (Su) A bluespawn godslayer deals an extra

2d6 points of damage when it hits an outsider.

Bluespawn godslayers live for one purpose: to slay Tiamats

enemies.  They  delight  in  combat  and  take  pride  in  their

expertise with weapons. Godslayers guard the lairs of blue

dragons and seek out and slaughter good dragons.

Strategies and Tactics

Bluespawn  godslayers  possess  little  skill  with  ranged

weapons, and their melee attacks explode with electricity,

so  they  rush  to  get  foes  within  their  reach.  A  bluespawn

godslayer  prefers  to  attack  those  it  can  readily  identify  as

enemies of Tiamat. This category includes any dragons or

outsiders  that  oppose  them  and  anyone  carrying  symbols

representing good dragons.

Against smaller foes, a godslayer moves adjacent and uses

Awesome  Blow  to  knock  the  foe  away.  When  the  fallen

creature  tries  to  rise  from  prone,  still  within  reach,  the

godslayer  makes  an  attack  of  opportunity  against  it  and

then makes a full attack on its next turn (providing that

opponent did not  ee).

In groups, bluespawn godslayers surround foes but keep

them just within reach. Then, each uses Awesome Blow to

knock foes through and into the reach of the others, allow-

Sample Encounters

Bluespawn godslayers are often encountered in small groups

or with blue dragons, who protect the spawn from  ying

enemies. They guard blue dragon lairs or work with other

spawn of Tiamat, serving as heavy hitters and anchor points

in an army.

Patrol  (EL  1113):  Blue  dragons  often  deploy  guard

patrols  containing  bluespawn  godslayers  and  bluespawn

burrowers (see page 138).

EL 11: Brakanax, a bluespawn godslayer, and its guard

dogs,  two  bluespawn  burrowers,  patrol  the  caverns  that

lead  to  a  blue  dragons  lair.  They  attack  any  intruders.

Brakanax blocks the passage while the burrowers tunnel

behind interlopers to  ank them and use their electricity

sweeps.

Clutchmates (EL 1216): Several bluespawn godslayers

born to a single dragon might remain with their parent as

guards and companions.

EL 14: Tusenmaug, a young adult blue dragon, soars high

above the desert seeking a caravan to raid. Not far behind

jog three bluespawn godslayers that attack the dragons prey

while the dragon strafes with lightning.

Typical Treasure

Bluespawn godslayers carry little treasure. What valuables

against Tiamats foes. Most are encountered just with their

signature  weapons  and  shields.  Godslayers  despise  being

slowed down on the battle eld, but a few leaders convince

for a giant.

Yes. I am blessed. I have borne Tiamats child in Her

stead. Holy be Her plans, and may those that use this

godslayer come to fruition . . . swiftly.

Kazeranthamus, ancient blue dragon

Bluespawn Godslayers in Eberron

The  birth  of  a  bluespawn  godslayer  is  considered  a  dire

omen. Dragon custom dictates that the mother abandon the

hatchling godslayer in some distant land and then go into

seclusion to contemplate what the birth might mean for the

Prophecy. This leaves bluespawn godslayers to live out their

lives in solitude or in small groups of siblings throughout

Eberron. Since the rise of the humanoid races on Khorvaire,

blue dragons have taken to leaving godslayers in the Demon

Wastes,  the  Blade  Desert,  and  in  wilderness  areas  on  the

continents of Sarlona and Xendrik.

Bluespawn Godslayers in Faern

Bluespawn godslayers live where blue dragons make their

homes. In particular, they roam Anauroch, the Calim

Desert, and Raurin, the Dust Desert. Blue dragons

consider  the  birth  of  a  bluespawn  godslayer

to  be  a  great  boon.  These  spawn  of

Tiamat become able guardians of the

dragons lairs instead of

future rivals. The god-

slayers  happily  serve

in  this  role  until  Tiamat

calls them to service. Each

night, they hope to hear her

call to them in their dreams,

commanding them to take their

place in her great armies.

Ecology

Bluespawn godslayers are genderless and possess no means of

procreation. Instead, they are born to blue dragons blessed by

Tiamat. Blue dragons not devoted to the Chromatic Dragon

often despise godslayers, but they recognize these creatures

value as guardians. They also fear invoking Tiamats wrath,

which might bring godslayers born of other blue dragons

against them.

Godslayers are carnivorous creatures that devour anything

that falls to their blades, including other spawn or even chro-

matic dragons that oppose them. They have the metabolism

of dragons, gorging themselves in a spree of slaughter and

then not eating for months at a time.

Environment:  Bluespawn godslayers live in temperate

and  warm  deserts,  along  with  the  blue  dragons  that  gave

birth to them.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  bluespawn  god-

slayer  stands  about  18  feet  tall  and  weighs  nearly  18,000

pounds.

Alignment: Bluespawn godslayers are usually lawful evil.

Sometimes neutral evil godslayers arise that are willful and

often more intelligent. Thus, they are more likely to resist

the in uences of their mothers and other spawn. Chaotic

and good godslayers are unheard-of.

Society

Tiamat  designed  bluespawn  godslayers  to  kill  enemy

outsiders and metallic dragons, and to face the aspects of

rival dragon gods. They are born to blue dragons who earn

Tiamats  favor  or  who  are  near  to  foes  of  interest  to  the

Chromatic Dragon.

Bluespawn godslayers know they are the favored spawn

of  Tiamat  because  they  are  born  only  to  dragons,

Bluespawn

godslayer

and because

they hear her dis-

tant  roars  in  their

dreams.  They  instinctively

recognize  all  spawn  as  chil-

dren of Tiamat, but they believe

godslayers  to  be  superior  to

all  the  rest.  Fortunately

for  smarter  spawn  and

the blue dragons who

foster  godslayers  as

children,  the  crea-

tures are dull-witted

and  rarely  possess

leadership  ability.

succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of

electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tiamats Blessing (Electricity) (Su) All spawn of Tiamat

within 5 feet of or riding on a bluespawn stormlizard

gain immunity to electricity.

Tiamat created bluespawn stormlizards to serve her other

spawn as mounts, a role they take to readily. Often on the

forefront of her forces, stormlizards enjoy charging over foes,

or pushing into an enemy line and then blasting creatures

between them with their electricity link.

Strategies and Tactics

Bluespawn stormlizards work best in a pack of two to eight.

Roughly half of the packs members charge into melee, while

the  rest  circle  around  to  set  up  a  killing  zone  with  their

electricity link, preferably catching several foes at once. The

stormlizards continually shift positions to make it harder for

the enemy to avoid the lines of lightning. Against creatures

with immunity or signi cant resistance to electricity, storm-

lizards change their tactics, relying on their gore attacks and

setting up  anks.

Sample Encounters

Bluespawn stormlizards are almost never encountered alone.

Usually  they  travel  in  groups  of  four  or  eight,  with  equal

numbers of males and females.

Blackspawn  Knights  (El  9):  Two  blackspawn  raiders

(see page 130) ride on twin bluespawn stormlizards. Eager

for glory, both raiders charge their mounts into melee and let

the stormlizards decide whether or not to use their electricity

link.

Pack (EL 1012): Packs of stormlizards might be groups

of mates or simply siblings.

EL 10: Four bluespawn stormlizards, two male twins and

two female twins, hunt together for a meal large enough to

sate all of them. The individuals range far apart from one

another, keeping their eyes open for Medium or larger crea-

tures. When one spots likely prey, it roars loudly to alert the

others and charges in to occupy the quarry until the rest of

the pack arrives.

For Player Characters

Bluespawn stormlizards make useful mounts, especially if

raised from the egg in captivity and properly handled. Storm-

lizard twins must remain near each other, and often a pair

of twins is trained together. Riding a stormlizard requires

an exotic saddle.

Even a domesticated stormlizard retains its evil alignment

and takes pleasure in slaughter, so controlling it can be dif-

 cult if a rider does not wish to kill an opponent (Handle

Animal DC 20). The DCs of Handle Animal and Ride checks

increase by 5 for nonspawn riders. All DCs further increase

by 10 if a stormlizard is separated from its twin.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a bluespawn storm-

lizard  is  up  to  1,040  pounds;  a  medium  load,  1,0412,080

pounds; and a heavy load, 2,0813,120 pounds.

Bluespawn Stormlizards in Eberron

Bluespawn  stormlizards  live  in  large  numbers  on  Argon-

nessen  and  Xendrik.  Far  smaller  populations  eke  out  an

existence  in  less  hospitable  regions  of  Khorvaire,  mainly

at the edges of Qbarra and within Droaam. The monstrous

armies of Droaam have yet to discover the beasts usefulness

as mounts, seeing them only as dangerous predators, but its

only  a  matter  of  time  until  stormlizard  cavalry  forms  the

vanguard of their forces.

Bluespawn Stormlizards in Faern

Many  evil  creatures  ride  stormlizard  mounts,  including

members of the Cult of the Dragon. What their riders dont

know  is  that  the  beasts  have  a  higher  loyalty.  Bluespawn

creatures  and  refuse  to  attack  them.  When  the  time

electricity link with any other stormlizard, it  rst learns to

use the ability with its twin.

If one of a pair is killed, the other  ies into a rage of grief

and loss, killing indiscriminately until it is killed itself. If

separated for long, both become listless and refuse to eat,

slowly starving to death unless reunited. Thus, a pair must

seek another pair of twins as mates, and all four use the same

lair  for  egg  laying.  However,  stormlizards  dont  mate  for

life, and even within a mated pack, partners might change.

All  members  of  a  mated  group  provide  for  and  guard  the

hatchlings,  but  once  their  young  are  old  enough  to  hunt,

the parents split up: Twin fathers take twin sons and twin

mothers take twin daughters.

Any  creature  capable  of  training  wild  animals  can  ride

bluespawn  stormlizards  as  mounts.  They  are  surprisingly

tractable  so  long  as  twins  remain  within  sight  or  hearing

of each another. Fortunately for those who ride them, their

electricity link never affects a rider unless one somehow gets

between  other  stormlizards.  However,  bluespawn  storm-

lizards are driven to kill; if a rider repeatedly spares enemies,

the mount grows irritable and eventually rebels. Some riders

try to keep their stormlizard mounts in check by  eeing

from foes they dont wish to kill, but they play a dangerous

game by doing so.

Environment:  Bluespawn  stormlizards  live  in  warm

lands. Theyre more populous in arid regions but can adapt

to any temperate or warm environment that provides a dry

place to sleep. Mated pairs look for dry caverns in which to

lay eggs and tend young; lacking this, they make do with

an area of large boulders or even a

closely packed stand of trees.

Typical Physical Char-

acteristics: A bluespawn

stormlizard stands roughly

6 feet tall at the shoulder

and weighs about 4,000

pounds. Males carry slightly

more bulk than females,

but otherwise they look very

similar. With plentiful feed-

ing, though, stormlizards

can attain tremendous size.

Such behemoths often serve

bluespawn godslayers as

mounts.

Older  stormlizards  have

darker  scales  and  scarred

faces, the result of sparring

matches over mates.

Alignment:  With  their

blue dragon heritage and an-

imal  intelligence,  bluespawn

stormlizards are always lawful

evil.

Typical Treasure

Bluespawn stormlizards dont carry

treasure or eat metal when feeding.

Skills Greenspawn leapers have a +10 racial bonus on

Balance, Hide, and Jump checks. In addition, they have

a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always

choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or

threatened.

Predatory  and  territorial,  greenspawn  leapers  hunt  the

unwary in the wild and serve the smaller spawn of Tiamat.

Greenspawn  sneaks  (see  page  148)  use  leapers  as  mounts,

beasts of burden, and guardians.

Strategies and Tactics

A greenspawn leaper uses its treetop mobility to approach

prey  unseen.  Although  it  has  little  chance  of  quieting  its

 nal approach, the leaper stays hidden behind branches and

foliage and uses routes that are impassible on the ground.

Once close enough, the leaper jumps onto prey from above

or strikes from a nearby branch. It tries to avoid injury, but

it stays close to prey so that it can use its poison burst as a

last-ditch tactic if it does get hurt. A leaper might even risk

an attack of opportunity to make a bull rush attempt against

an  opponent  in  the  trees,  hoping  to   nish  it  with  poison

and the fall.

Sample Encounters

Greenspawn leapers are most often encountered alone or in

the company of greenspawn sneaks.

Pair  (EL  4):  Leapers  occasionally  pair  off,  whether  for

mating or dominance displays, and an interruption usually

draws an attack.

EL  4:  A  pair  of  courting  greenspawn  leapers  engage  in

ritual dances and raucous calls, driving most forest animals

into  hiding.  Characters  investigating  the  noise  soon   nd

themselves facing two enraged spawn.

Ambush Party (EL 47): Patrolling greenspawn sneaks

ride  leapers  through  the  forest  to  extend  their  range  and

quickly move into ambush positions.

EL  6:  Two  sneaks  and  their  greenspawn  leaper  mounts

prepare an ambush along a forest path that runs past a small

pond. The sneaks lurk in the pond while the leapers crouch

nearby in trees. When travelers approach, the leapers roar as

they jump down to attack. After a moment, the sneaks rise

from the water to surprise and  ank their targets.

Ecology

Greenspawn leapers are territorial carnivores that prowl for-

ests and jungles as solitary hunters. They spend most of their

lives in the treetops, touching the ground only when they

drop on prey from above. They feed mostly on small prey they

can surprise or chase down, such as birds and canopy-dwell-

ing mammals. They also hunt bigger creatures that live on

the forest  oor but rarely attack anything larger than them-

selves. A greenspawn leaper is careful to avoid damage when

attacking prey, despite its poison burst ability. Greenspawn

leapers learn early that the acidic spray costs them meals, so

they use it only as a last resort.

GREENSPAWN LEAPER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can learn more

about greenspawn leapers. When a character makes a success-

This creature is a greenspawn leaper, a predatory

magical beast related to green dragons that lives in

the forest canopy. This result reveals all magical

beast traits.

Greenspawn leapers are immune to acid and

release a burst of acidic poison from their bodies

when wounded. They are vicious and selfish

creatures.

22  Greenspawn leapers are very territorial and engage

in races against others of their kind through the

canopy to determine dominance.

Greenspawn leapers dislike being out of their trees

and rarely cross open ground or enter water.

Greenspawn leapers mate once every three years.

A leaper raised in captivity can serve a Small

humanoid as a mount among the trees, but it

retains its vicious disposition.

Greenspawn leapers are some of Tiamats spawn.

Greenspawn leapers can sometimes be found

among worshipers of Tiamat.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

A single leaper claims vast areas of a forest as its hunting

grounds, marking trees with scratches and spoor. Most meet-

ings between leapers result in loud  ghts for dominance that

take the form of races about the treetops. The contestants

climb swiftly through the trees, each close by the other, try-

ing to be the  rst to take a risky jump or balance on a narrow

branch. The  rst leaper to fall from the tree or refuse to fol-

low its competitor loses the contest and retreats.

The  race  pits  con dence  against  bravado  as  each  leaper

attempts to outdo and outsmart the other. An experienced

leaper often allows its opponent to lead and attempt a fool-

hardy move. (Of course, this can back re by giving the other

leaper  an  opportunity  to  get  lucky.)  Although  of

animal intelligence, greenspawn leapers are

cunning  competitors  that  engage  in  mali-

cious  cheating  during  such  matches.  An

enterprising leaper might lead a rival toward

a branch it knows is weak and then fall be-

hind, or one in the lead might make

a  jump  and  then  move  the  branch

when its opponent attempts the same

maneuver.

One  year  out  of  three  is

a  mating  year,  when  males

leave their territory to invade

the  territory  of  females.

Within  a  given  females

territory,  males  race

against each other for the

right to mate with her. The

winner remains with the fe-

male  for  several  days  until  she

grows tired of his presence and chas-

es him away. A retreating male faces

a  rough  homecoming,  crossing

the territory of other males and

undergoing challenges, often re-

turning to  nd his territory lost to

interlopers while he was away.

A pregnant female constructs an egg bed out of

interwoven leafy branches. She incubates the eggs

for about two weeks, leaving only once a day to hunt for a

few hours. Once the young leapers hatch, the female leaves

them to fend for themselves within her territory. The hatch-

lings hone their instinctive abilities to climb, jump, and hide,

hunting insects at  rst but gradually taking on larger prey.

When they grow to adolescence, their mother drives them

out of her territory, and they must carve out an area of the

canopy for themselves.

Greenspawn leapers live for an average of  ve years in the

wild. Living in a forest canopy is dif cult for such a relatively

large creature, and dangerous races take their toll. In captiv-

ity (such as when a greenspawn sneak ranger takes a leaper

as an animal companion), a greenspawn leaper can live up to

ten years. Only domesticated leapers are likely to live long

enough to advance in Hit Dice.

Environment: Greenspawn leapers inhabit warm and tem-

perate forests. They live almost entirely in the canopy, leaving

the trees only to attack prey. Large bodies of water, treeless

hills or cliffs, and grassy plains form natural barriers against

leapers, since they are loath to leave the trees for long.

In  regions  where  trees  shed  their  leaves  in  winter,

greenspawn leapers spend the fall gorging and hibernate in

hollowed-out tree trunks. In warmer climes, leapers are ac-

tive all year round.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A greenspawn leaper

is about the size of a leopard or large dog. An adult is about

4 feet long and weighs roughly 100 pounds.

Greenspawn

leaper

The scales of leapers bear shades

of  green  appropriate  to

the forests in which they

dwell. Young and domes-

ticated  greenspawn  leapers

often  have  more  uniform

coloration as a result of their

limited territory. Eggs share this

green color for camou age to protect

them from predators.

Alignment:  Immensely  self-

ish  and  territorial,  greenspawn

leapers are always neutral evil.

Typical Treasure

Greenspawn  leapers  dont  carry  or

hoard treasure.

For Player Characters

Greenspawn  leapers  make  good  treetop

mounts  for  Small  riders,  if  the  creatures  are

raised  from  the  egg  in  captivity  and  properly

handled.  Riding  one  requires  an  exotic  saddle,

and  both  the  leaper  and  its  rider  must  undergo

lengthy and dangerous training to accustom the

creature to its role. A greenspawn leaper retains

territorial attitudes toward other leapers, and its

vicious disposition makes it extraordinarily dif-

 cult to handle (+5 on Handle Animal and

Ride DCs). The DCs of Handle Animal and

Ride checks increase by an additional 5 for

nonspawn riders.

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light  load  for

a  greenspawn  leaper  is  up  to  130  pounds;  a

medium load, 131255 pounds; and a heavy load, 256390

pounds.

Greenspawn Leapers in Eberron

Greenspawn leapers were  rst discovered in the jungles of

Xendrik.  Explorers  brought  back  several  captured  speci-

mens and eggs to Khorvaire for an exhibition during the

Last War, but the creatures escaped. (Some say they were

stolen by Seren barbarians.) Where the creatures are now

is a mystery yet to be solved.

Greenspawn Leapers in Faern

Greenspawn leapers live primarily in the warmer climes of

the south, especially the Chultan jungles, but greenspawn

sneaks (see page 148) have transplanted them to wherever

they live. Typically, sneaks establish a population of leapers

around an outpost to serve as mounts and guards. The sneaks

sometimes cultivate and shape natural breaks in the forest

canopy  to  serve  as  barriers,  training  the  leapers  to  patrol

smaller territories.

It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Sometimes called harrowblades by wood elves and other

forest denizens, greenspawn razor ends are voracious preda-

tors of woodland and swamps. Due to their modi ed wings,

they lack the ability to  y, but they can jump a surprising

distance.

Strategy and Tactics

Razor ends are cunning hunters that are fond of hit-and-

run tactics. They typically lie in wait under the surface of

water or amid undergrowth, then use Spring Attack to great

advantage. They know that one blow will eventually strike a

vulnerable spot and deal massive damage.

Against  multiple  foes,  a  single  razor end  maneuvers to

catch as many creatures as possible in its acid breath, even

if this provokes attacks of opportunity. A surrounded razor-

 end tries to  ght its way out, focusing on one enemy until

it can clear a path for escape.

Razor ends are most dangerous in groups. They are intel-

ligent enough to focus all their attacks on one individual,

typically the one that most threatens the group. They use

their  breath  weapons  liberally,  since  they  are  immune  to

acid, and spray one another with impunity.

Sample Encounters

Razor ends might be encountered alone or in mated pairs,

or used to guard Tiamats armies.

Mated Pair (EL 7 or 9): The party stumbles upon the nest

of a pair of razor ends. Only one is in the lair, guarding the

eggs,  and  it  viciously  attacks  the  intruders.  Once  combat

begins, the razor end calls for its mate with a sharp roar.

The mate arrives 1d4 rounds later and tries to pick off a PC

near the periphery of the battle.

Group  (EL  10+):  Three  or  more  razor ends  work

together to take down large prey or slaughter many weaker

creatures.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Greenspawn

razor end

EL 11: Four

razor  ends  have  been  let

loose by their hobgoblin handler near a busy trade route to

perfect their violence in the wild. They initiate the attack

with their acid breath, then use Spring Attack to move in,

slash once, and back away. In subsequent rounds, they harry

foes from multiple directions, concentrating  rst on whoever

deals the most damage.

Ecology

Greenspawn  razor ends  were  among  the   rst  spawn  cre-

ated by Tiamat, and the  rst originated in her realm in the

Nine Hells. Scores of eggs were distributed to her draconic

and hobgoblin servants throughout the world, interbred as

troops for Tiamats grand army.

Now,  razor ends  are  present  in  nearly  every  force  of

Tiamats followers, guarding key installations such as dragon-

spawn hatcheries. Her servants have placed other razor ends

in carefully selected regions to harass settlements and fron-

tier areas in preparation for the great invasion.

Greenspawn razor ends attack anything that enters their

territory. It isnt the hunt they enjoy so much as the killing,

and they slay larger and smaller creatures with equal glee.

Those  employed  by  other  spawn  roam  about  encamp-

ments but are barely under control. In battle, they are

released  rst as shock troops.

In the wild, razor ends mate for life. Each year,

the female produces a clutch of three to six eggs,

which  she  buries  under  loose  dirt  or  hides  in  a

shallow bog. Mates take turns guarding their nest.

One stays with the eggs while the other hunts and

protects their territory.

Environment:  Greenspawn  razorfiends

live primarily in temperate or warm forests and

marshes. They prefer to build nests near bodies of

fresh water, which they also use to ambush prey.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  green-

spawn  razor end  stands  about  6  feet  tall  at  the

shoulder and can reach 20 or more feet in length.

An adult weighs roughly 6,000 pounds. Its wings

are modi ed for slashing attacks, and as a razor-

 end grows older, the claws become longer and the

membranes  shrink.  When  folded,  a  razor ends

wings resemble knife blades.

Razor ends scales have a dirty green color that

helps them lurk in forest pools.

Alignment:  Greenspawn  razor ends  live  for

slaughter,  but  their  green  dragon  heritage  and

modest intelligence predispose them to a lawful

evil alignment.

Treasure

Greenspawn  razor ends  have  inherited  the  dra-

conic  trait  of  hoarding  wealth,  and  they  collect

from  their  prey  anything  that  glitters  or  shines.

As a result, a razor end hoard includes double coins

and double goods, with standard items. They never have

objects made from cloth, leather, or similar materials, gener-

ally preferring metal.

Greenspawn Razorfiends in Eberron

Many  greenspawn  razor ends  are  found  within  and  near

the  strongholds  of  hobgoblin  warlords  in  Darguun  who

have pledged themselves to Tiamats army. The razor ends

guard  hatcheries  that  incubate  eggs  of  all  other  kinds  of

spawn. Other razor end populations have been established

in Qbarra and the swamplands of the Shadow Marches, as

well as the interior of Xendrik.

Greenspawn Razorfiends in Faern

Greenspawn razor ends are thriving in forests throughout

Faern. They have been spotted within the Chondalwood,

as well as within Thesk and Aglarond. Reports of creatures

resembling razor ends have surfaced around the High Moor

and the Serpent Hills, despite their inhospitable climes, and

rumors exist of similar beings in the Vast Swamp of eastern

Cormyr.

Skills Greenspawn sneaks have a +5 racial bonus on Bluff,

Greenspawn  sneaks  are  the  eyes  and  ears  of  Tiamats

army.  Spellcasters  might  scry  on  foes,  and  dragons  might

spy  on  enemy  troop  movement  from  high  in  the  sky,  but

greenspawn  sneaks  are  scouts  on  the  ground  and  in  the

thick of the action.

Strategies and Tactics

Greenspawn sneaks travel alone or in small groups on scout-

ing  missions.  They  move  carefully,  staying  hidden  from

potential  ambushers.  When  time  is  of  the  essence,  they

attempt to run silently (20 penalty on Move Silently checks,

with additional penalties for terrain; PH 79). On the prowl,

sneaks communicate mostly with gesture and body language,

but if members of a strike team cant see one another, they

call out in short words or phrases of Draconic made to sound

like animal noises.

Greenspawn  sneaks  prefer  to  attack  from  hiding.  After

gaining surprise or at least catching opponents  at-footed,

they employ Bluff to feint in combat or create a diversion to

hide (PH 68). A sneak that successfully feints uses the oppor-

tunity to deliver a sneak attack. If able to hide, it continues to

make sneak attacks or melts away to attack again later from

 ank  foes,  usually  attempting  to  surround  and  eliminate

one enemy at a time.

Although  not  innate  swimmers,  greenspawn  sneaks

inherited the green dragon ability to breathe underwater.

They prefer to spy from or wait in ambush in bodies of water,

usually near bridges or fords that their foes are likely to use.

With their poor swimming ability and small size, however,

they leave the water to engage foes.

Dice ability score increases: Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 10,

Wis 12, Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

A greenspawn sneak raid leader commands two to four strike

teams on a mission to attack an enemy position. Such raids

have speci c goals beyond mere slaughter and looting: For

example, three strike teams might assault a village to divert

attention  from  another  strike  team  that  is  in ltrating  to

gather supplies or assassinate an enemy leader.

A raid leader always puts himself where he can most effec-

tively support the mission. This usually means working with

the team most likely to encounter dif culty; in the

example of the village raid given above, he might

accompany  the  in ltration  team  if  the  assassi-

nation  target  seems  a  tough  combatant  or  the

supplies are well defended. Against clever foes,

a raid leader might take personal action, using

the other strike teams to cover his effort.

Greenspawn sneak raid leaders employ

many  of  the  same  tactics  that  sneaks

use, but those with levels in rogue or

scout  also  tumble  past  opponents

to   ank  and  use  sneak  attacks  or

skirmish.  Although  they  can

attack  at  range,  even  sniping

from hiding, raid leaders prefer

melee combat.

Sample Encounters

Adventurers  are  most  likely  to

encounter  greenspawn  sneaks

singly  or  in  small  strike  teams.

Larger groups assault enemy posi-

tions and guard spawn outposts.

The  strike  team  is  the  most

common encounter.

Strike  Team  (EL  5):  A  strike

team  usually  consists  of  three

sneaks  and  a  single  leader  with

one level in a class.

EL 5: Grayka, Grukex, and

Klaykex follow the orders of

Kleknax,  a  1st-level  ranger.

The three sneaks are on their

 rst scouting mission, so they are

eager  to  prove  themselves,  but  theyre

also wary of displeasing Kleknax.

Scout (EL 59): A greenspawn sneak found

alone is likely to be a low- to mid-level ranger on patrol or

sent to scout an enemy strong point.

EL 7: Graxliss is a 4th-level ranger who rides a greenspawn

leaper (see page 144), as she roams the sneaks territory keep-

ing an eye out for intruders. She is eager to charge her mount

into battle, where it can use its poison burst, and isnt con-

cerned about its possible injury.

Raid (EL 910): In a raid, several strike teams work under

a single raid leader.

EL 10: A greenspawn sneak raid leader directs four strike

teams  against  a  caravan  transporting  offerings  to  a  good

dragon. The strike teams harry and distract the guardians

while the raid leader kills the driver and takes command of

the treasure wagon. When hes in place, his whistle signals

the strike teams to attack the caravans other horses so that

none can follow as he  ees with the treasure.

Outpost  (EL  14):  An  outpost  of  greenspawn  sneaks  is

hidden in a hill or an underground cave accessible only by

water. There, invaders often encounter a prelate (cleric 10), an

acolyte (cleric 1), two raid leaders (ranger 2/scout 3), a scout

(ranger 4) with a greenspawn leaper mount, twenty adults,

and about two dozen immature noncombatants, as well as

eggs.  Some  favored  outposts  are  led  by  a  Talon  of  Tiamat

(cleric 6, talon of Tiamat 4 [Draconomi-

con 134]) instead of a prelate.

Ecology

An outpost of greenspawn sneaks

has a surprisingly small impact on

the local environment. This isnt

due  to  any  love  of  nature,  but

rather to a desire to disguise the

sneaks presence in an area.

O m n ivor ou s

eater s ,

greenspawn  sneaks  have

inherited some of dragons

slow metabolism. Each can

subsist  on  less  than  half

the  food  that  a  hal ing

needs, limiting the tribes

impact on the areas  ora

and  fauna.  Sneaks  are

primarily  hunter-gath-

erers, but they tend wild

plants they particularly

enjoy  eating  and  hus-

band  the  local  animal

resources.

Reproduction follows a

schedule determined by the

tribes prelate, who sets a limit on egg

hatching based on what is best for

the  tribe  and  for  accomplish-

ing Tiamats aims. Usually

a  number  of  eggs  sur-

vive each year equal to

the  number  of  sneaks

in  the  tribe,  but  when

building up for war, the

prelate might allow  ve to ten times as many

eggs to hatch. The tribe sets aside the remaining eggs for use

as  asks of acid in battle (these eggs are  lled with a caustic

 uid that embryonic sneaks breathe and subsist on).

Young greenspawn sneaks are raised communally by tribe

members assigned to the task. Parents claim no ownership

of offspringall are children of Tiamat. The prelate judges

young sneaks capabilities and assigns them their adult roles

in the tribe. Few greenspawn sneaks ever deviate from these

unless retiring from active duty to be caretakers of the young

and in rm.

When assigning a tribal role, the prelate also names the

hatchling.  Greenspawn  sneak  names  have  one  or  two  syl-

lables.  A  hard  consonant  (g  or  k)  begins  the  name:  g

indicates a female, and k, a male.

Environment:  Greenspawn  sneaks  primarily  inhabit

temperate or warm forests and marshes. They live in small,

hidden settlements in wilderness areas abutting the lands

of creatures they consider foes of Tiamat. Sneaks always set

up their outposts near a source or fresh water, be it a pond,

stream, or underground font. This provides drinking water

and a means of escape or concealment for noncombatants

should an outpost be attacked.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Greenspawn sneaks

average  3-1/2  feet  in  height  and  50  pounds  in  weight.

Females  tend  to  be  slightly  broader  and  weigh  up  to  10

pounds more than males, depending on whether they are

carrying eggs.

Alignment: Greenspawn sneaks are nearly always lawful

evil. Those that cannot follow the brutal rules of their society

rarely live long.

Society

Greenspawn  sneaks  have  a  theocratic  and  orderly  society.

They are wholly devoted to Tiamat and think of themselves

as  belonging  to  a  great  army  with  her  as  their  god  and

general.

Chromatic dragons and other spawn serve Tiamats army

in a multitude of ways, but greenspawn sneaks know their

duty  with  perfect  clarity:  Strike  with  surprise,  confound

and kill, then melt away before the enemy even understands

what happened. Every aspect of their lives revolves around

this role.

Greenspawn sneaks are some of Tiamats spawn.

Greenspawn sneaks worship Tiamat and serve her

armies as scouts.

Greenspawn sneaks have a theocratic society and

refuse to follow anyone who doesnt speak for

Tiamat. If their clerics are killed, they might leave the

region to find and serve another priest of Tiamat.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

Three central tenets guide greenspawn sneaks existence:

duty, stealth, and trickery. Duty to Tiamat and tribe comes

 rst. The second most important ideal, stealth, allows them

to do their duty. As scouts for the Chromatic Dragons divine

army, greenspawn sneaks live in small settlements, which

they call outposts, on the fringes of enemy territory. They

know they are the reconnaissance force preparing the way

for the great assault. Thus, they must be circumspect, strik-

ing when the opportunity presents itself but never revealing

their position or intent to others.

Trickery is the tool that gives greenspawn sneaks an edge

over foes. Deceit comes naturally to them, and in their social

interactions they conceal emotions and disguise their true

aims.  When  the  young  hatch,  the  cleverest  get  attention

and training, not the strongest or loudest. These individu-

als attain the highly honored roles of scouts and strike team

members, and one among them might even become prelate.

Those with less talent for deceit and strategy become guards,

egg incubators, and caretakers for children and the elderly.

Of course, trickery must serve the higher goal of helping the

tribe and honoring Tiamat; in ghting is punished by sum-

mary execution.

A high-ranking cleric of Tiamat called a prelate leads a

tribe of greenspawn sneaks. As the mouth of Tiamat, the

prelate commands complete loyalty. He or she chooses a

single successor, called an acolyte, from among the young

of the tribe. Although this acolyte has no of cial author-

ity, in practice, the two clerics act as a unit and are rarely

separated.  This  close  relationship  prevents  power  grabs

or  battles  for  successiongreenspawn  sneaks  refuse  to

follow anyone who cannot speak for Tiamat. Indeed, a tribe

that loses both its prelate and acolyte submits to the rule

of another tribes prelate rather than electing a new leader

from among their number.

As  servants  of  Tiamat,  greenspawn  sneaks  obey  her

highest  authority.  In  most  cases,  this  is  the  prelate,  but

sometimes  a  tribe  serves  a  powerful  evil  dragon  or  even

another group of spawn. Greenspawn sneaks prefer to work

with green dragons and other lawful followers of Tiamat.

Friction and confusion nearly always result when a leader

doesnt appreciate their regimented outlook or the tenets of

their society.

Typical Treasure

Greenspawn sneaks have standard items for their Challenge

Rating  but  rarely  carry  goods  or  coins.  Such  wealth  is

brought back to the outpost and hoarded there as a bed for

egg-laying and to offer to evil dragons the sneaks encounter.

In addition, an outpost often holds a large cache of nonincu-

bated eggs that serve as acid  asks. Greenspawn sneaks craft

their own tools, weapons, and armor, but other items were

likely taken from a foe or stolen in a raid.

Greenspawn Sneaks with Class Levels

Although  their  favored  class  is  ranger,  many  greenspawn

sneaks become rogues, ninjas, or scouts. (The ninja and scout

classes are described in Complete Adventurer.)

150

The armies of Tiamat march to war

Rangers often use greenspawn leapers as mounts, and they

ride them through the treetops and into battle. A greenspawn

sneak ranger who takes the two-weapon combat style gains

the Two-Weapon Defense feat in place of the Two-Weapon

Fighting feat. Most greenspawn sneak rangers pick human-

oid races as favored enemies.

Despite their close relationship with the natural environ-

ment, greenspawn sneaks never become druids.

Greenspawn sneaks speak Draconic. Those with a talent

for languages learn those of their foes, often Common and

Elven.

Level Adjustment: +4.

Dragonsplits are not double weapons. Instead, a wielder

chooses to use either the piercing edge for a greater critical

threat range or the slashing edge for a devastating (but rarer)

quadruple-damage critical.

Greenspawn Sneaks in Eberron

Greenspawn  sneaks  believe  themselves  to  be  the  favored

descendants  of  green  dragons,  an  idea  that  most  green

dragons  dispute.  Nevertheless,  the  sneaks  revere  green

dragons and wish to serve them exclusively. Good dragons

usually  refuse  this  service;  sneaks  take  such  rejection  in

stride and look for another to worship.

For Player Characters

Greenspawn Sneaks in Faern

A  greenspawn  sneak  wields  a  pair  of  dragonsplits,  one-

handed  exotic  melee  weapons  with  which  all  sneaks  are

pro cient. A dragonsplit can be used as a piercing weapon

like  a  short  sword.  Alternative  grips  use  its  long  edge  for

slashing attacks or its short edge for chopping and hacking.

It counts as a light weapon for the purpose of Two-Weapon

Fighting and Weapon Finesse.

Greenspawn sneaks live undiscovered in many forests and

swamps throughout Faern. They avoid areas with a large

population of elves or other good creatures that might inform

the world of their presence. Major communities exist in the

Lurkwood, Mere of Dead Men, High Moor, Marsh of Tun,

Winterwood, Umber Marshes, and Mhair Jungles, but small

tribes  live  in  hundreds  of  other  secret  locations.  Recent

attacks by rogue dragons have the greenspawn hopeful for

a new Rage Of Dragons, and they watch the skies for the

return  of  a  star  the  elves  call  the  Kingslayer,  which  they

believe will be a sign from Tiamat that her divine war has at

last begun. They trust no humans and thus never work with

the Cult of the Dragon.

Armored Mage (Ex) A redspawn arcaniss can wear light

Tiamat  created  the  redspawn  arcanisses  to  be  her  spell-

casters in battle, imbuing them with a red dragons love of

carnage  and  the  magic  all  true  dragons  inherit  with  age.

The arcanisses serve her as engines of destruction, wildly

hurling  deadly  spells  amid  the  Chromatic  Dragons  more

melee-oriented forces.

Strategies and Tactics

Redspawn  arcanisses  enjoy  combat  and  charge  into  frays.

They take a direct approach in combat, rarely using guile or

152

tactics beyond relying on their  re spell af nity and immu-

nity to  re. Even in melee, they prefer to use magic.

An arcaniss casts  re spells recklessly, centering  reballs

on itself to harm  anking foes and using burning hands and

scorching ray spells, all the while healing itself. Should  re

spells be ineffectual, a redspawn arcaniss prefers to retreat,

using other magic as it does so. It casts  re spells to heal,

then  usually  returns  with  other  spawn  of  Tiamat  to  take

revenge.

If  in  battle  it  spots  a  dragonblood  character  (such  as  a

spellscale or dragonborn from the Races of the Dragon supple-

ment) or any creature with a connection to good dragons, a

redspawn arcaniss focuses on that enemy. Even dire opposi-

tion does not discourage an arcaniss from pleasing Tiamat

by killing one of her hated foes.

A redspawn arcaniss typically wears light armor and a light

shield, keeping one hand free for spellcasting. It also carries

a simple weapon, such as a heavy mace, for the rare occasions

when it must resort to physical combat.

Sample Encounter

Redspawn arcanisses know how to handle foes: Burn them to

cinders and feast on their charred bones. They usually form

raiding parties to maximize the destruction.

Raiders (EL 10): Three redspawn arcanisses and a red-

spawn   rebelcher  (see  page  154)  attack  a  town  at  night,

setting  everything  alight  as  they  roam  the  streets.  One

arcaniss rides the  rebelcher and directs its attacks in the

most  useful  manner.  The  other  two  stay  close,  reserving

their  reball spells for when the people of the town mount a

resistance and begin to surround them. The arcanisses have

come in search of weapons and armor for their unhatched

children. Having overcome resistance at the village gate, they

burn their way toward an armorers shop.

Ecology

Redspawn  arcanisses  are  carnivores  that  prefer  freshly

killed,  well-roasted  meat  and  blackened  bones.  They

lack  skill  at  hunting  and  trapping,  but  can  usually

bring down game by a well-placed scorching ray or

even a  reball.

Arcanisses live for the destruction of Tiamats foes.

They  roam  the  wilderness  in  pursuit  of  her  ene-

mies, slaughtering and feeding on the

hapless creatures they encounter.

Their nomadic natures

mean  redspawn  ar-

canisses rarely have

a great effect on the

local  environment,

although a forest  re

can be a sign of their

passing.

Bands  of  arcanisses

stay on the move, ex-

cept  when  laying

and hatching eggs.

Females become fer-

tile for one week, once

a  year.  A  month  after

mating,  a  female  lays  a

single egg. She keeps it in a heated

place, such as a hot spring, a volca-

nic vent, or even a well-tended  re

pit. The egg grows quickly in the

heat and hatches in approximately two weeks.

Hatchling  redspawn  arcanisses  emerge  fully  formed

and adult-sized. They can speak, and they completely un-

derstand how to use the spells Tiamat granted them. The

band  spends  another  week  with  the  newborns,  teaching

them about the lay of the land and offering both religious

and practical information. Usually, a mother provides her

child with a book or a scroll with excerpts from the Scrolls

of Fire (see Society) and speaks of the great destiny awaiting

their race as children of Tiamat. The parents and children

mix and split into two or three new bands, then go their

separate ways.

A hundred small  ames start a hundred  res that might

become a hundred bon res and a hundred mighty blazes

lighting the end of the world. Go forth and burn hot and

bright. Fire spreads.

Excerpt from the Scrolls of Fire

Environment:  Redspawn  arcanisses  haunt  the  fringes

of civilization and move frequently. They dont mind living

in the rough for long periods, and theyre most at home in

large caves in warm hills. Where it is safe for them to do so,

they sometimes venture into towns to buy and sell goods and

seek information.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A redspawn arcaniss

stands about 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

When young, an arcaniss has much more yellow and orange

in its coloring. As it ages, these colors grow redder, eventually

deepening in color to almost black.

Alignment: Redspawn arcanisses are always chaotic evil.

They revel in ruin and pain. They believe that every act

of destruction should honor Tiamat, their mother

and god.

Society

Redspawn arcanisses call themselves the Burn-

ing Ones of Tiamat. They believe themselves

to be the most favored of her spawn: Through

 re  and  destruction,  they  will

cleanse  the  world  of

nondragons  and  rule

over  all  dragonkind.

Their  holy  books,

the Scrolls of Fire, in-

struct  the  arcanisses

in these matters. Pur-

portedly  written  by

Tiamat  herself,  the

Scrolls tell arcanisses

to go forth and torch

the land.

Redspawn ar can isses spend

little  time  in  large  groups,

usually  roving  the  wil-

derness  in  small  bands  of

two to six. They wander as

whim or rumor takes them,

ever careful not to settle in

one  place  too  long  or  grow

too dependent on one another. Most meetings

between bands are chance encounters, such as when two or

more groups seek the lair of a good dragon or other enemy

of Tiamat. These meetings provide a brief opportunity to

share news, and individuals mingle freely before forming

new groups and heading their separate ways. Several bands

might  work  together  to  defeat  a  common  foe,  but  more

often, the most numerous group wins that honor while the

others seek new conquests.

Typical Treasure

Redspawn  arcanisses  have  standard  treasure  for  NPCs  of

their Challenge Rating. They have a strong hoarding instinct,

but they rarely take more treasure than they can carry. Nearly

all their combat equipment is stolen from other creatures or

crafted for them by a more settled race of Tiamats spawn.

They like to acquire items of  ne quality, especially those

with draconic themes. Much of an arcanisss treasure is in

the form of art objects and jewelry.

Redspawn Arcanisses with Class Levels

Sorcerer is the favored class of redspawn arcanisses. As an

associated class, levels of sorcerer stack with an arcanisss

innate  spellcasting  ability.  Levels  of  other  classes  (even

spellcasting classes) are nonassociated.

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Ferocious but stupid, redspawn  rebelchers serve Tiamats

more intelligent spawn as mounts. When left to their own

devices, they live like crocodiles, lounging around pools of

lava instead of water.

Strategies and Tactics

Redspawn   rebelchers  immediately  attack  any  creature

that  comes  within  charging  distance,  except  other  spawn

of Tiamat and chromatic dragons. A redspawn  rebelcher

begins combat with its best form of attack: belching  re. It

then charges the nearest foe and bites at it savagely, all the

while looking for another opportunity to belch  re. It can

use this special ability against enemies up to 60 feet away

but is content to burn those within reach, especially if they

are clustered together.

When used as mounts,  rebelchers follow the commands

of  their  riders.  Although  they  are  powerful  swimmers,

they prefer lava and avoid entering water unless ordered

to do so.

Sample Encounter

Firebelchers can be encountered individually, but most of the

time they form hunting groups of three to twelve. They also

serve other spawn of Tiamat as mounts or guard beasts.

Hunting Party (EL 12): A party of twelve blackspawn

raiders (see page 130) have commandeered a colony of red-

spawn  rebelchers to serve them. The raiders are looking

for a sect of dragon shamans (detailed in Players Handbook

II) dedicated to emulating silver dragons, but they readily

attack other creatures.

The spawn divide into four smaller groups, each containing

three raiders and a  rebelcher: One blackspawn is mounted

while the other two stay within 5 feet of the  rebelcher at

all times to gain immunity to  re. The spawn attack from

four directions, with the riders  rst ordering their mounts to

belch  re. The group then closes. In melee, the blackspawn

raiders on foot try to  ank enemies while staying adjacent

to the redspawn to avoid damage from splashing  ames.

Ecology

Redspawn  rebelchers prefer extremely hot locales, particu-

larly volcanic areas. They spend most of their days basking

in the sun or sliding slowly through lava  ows. This languid

life  belies  the  creatures  predatory  nature  and  surprising

speed.

When hungry,  rebelchers explode into the countryside,

setting  res as they incinerate anything larger than a rabbit

that crosses their paths. Sometimes they ride the lava  ows

of volcanic eruptions, using these upheavals as an excuse to

hunt and add to the destruction. Although  rebelcher attacks

are devastating, the nearby environment adapts to them, as

it might to a volcano that periodically erupts.

A  rebelcher consumes roughly its body weight in meat

at one sitting, then returns to its lair. With a metabolism

like that of dragons, it can survive up to two years on such

a  substantial  meal.  Redspawn   rebelchers  inherit  red

dragons  penchant  for  cruelty,  though,  and  kill  far  more

than they can eat.

Other,  more  intelligent  spawn  of  Tiamat  capture  and

train redspawn  rebelchers as mounts. Although dif cult

to  tame,   rebelchers  are  receptive  to  the  commands  of

other spawnoften after eating a few. Such mounts are not

allowed to eat their  ll; hunger keeps them ferocious and

prevents lethargy. Redspawn arcanisses (see page 152) most

commonly use redspawn  rebelchers, but blackspawn raid-

ers and even greenspawn sneaks have been known to ride

them into battle. No one has reported whitespawn riding

 rebelchers, but this is more likely due to their con icting

environments than to innate hostility.

Adult  female   rebelchers  come  into  season  once  every

three years, near the height of summer. Several males vie for

the privilege of mating with a single female in con icts that

are bloody but rarely fatal. Once the female has conceived,

she drives away the victorious male. She then lays a clutch

of  six  to  eight  eggs,  each  about  a  foot  long  and  weighing

around 25 pounds. She conceals them with small rocks and

debris and guards them against all intruders, including other

 rebelchers.

After a couple of weeks, the baby redspawn  rebelchers

break out of their shells, ravenously hungry. They eat any-

thing they can see and overwhelm, including their siblings.

Typical Treasure

Redspawn   rebelchers  dont  hoard  treasure,  and

their  ery digestive systems destroy any small items of value

they might consume.

For Player Characters

Redspawn   rebelchers  make  interesting  if  challenging

mounts.  They  are  exceptionally  ornery  creatures  and  dif-

 cult to train. Only a very skilled trainers rearing one from

infancy has resulted in successful domestication. For all but

the spawn of Tiamat, Handle Animal DCs with redspawn

 rebelchers  increase  by  10  and  Ride  check  DCs  increase

by 5.

Because of the time and effort involved, a domesticated

 rebelcher mount costs 35,000 gp.

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light  load  for  a  redspawn   re-

belcher is up to 350 pounds; a medium load, 351700 pounds;

and a heavy load, 7011,050 pounds.

Redspawn Firebelchers in Eberron

Redspawn   rebelchers  live  in  the  Menechtarun  desert

and  the  Skyraker  Claws  mountains  of  Xendrik.  Scholars

speculate that they might once have been beasts of burden

or guardian beasts for  re giants long ago, when giants were

cultured builders.

Redspawn Firebelchers in Faern

Redspawn   rebelchers  inhabit  many  of  Faerns  moun-

tainous  areas,  often  in  volcanic  caverns  hidden  beneath

snow-covered  peaks.  Many  large  colonies  of   rebelchers

exist in the Crags near the Neverwinter Wood and in the

Smoking Mountains of Unther. The creatures can also be

found in a few areas near civilization. For example, Thrax-

ata, a young adult red dragon, resides at the top of the Blood

Horn in Deepingdale and encourages redspawn  rebelchers

to live near her lair.

Whitespawn hordelings live for violence. They rove in huge

hordes,  ghting anything they encounter.

Strategies and Tactics

Whitespawn hordelings employ little strategy. All the mem-

bers of a group charge and mob foes. Some attack with swords

and bites, while others who cant yet get into melee hurl darts

and use their breath weapons against enemies. If their melee

attacks cannot pierce a targets armor, they turn to their cold

breath; if neither tactic works, they  ee.

Sample Encounters

Whitespawn hordelings are almost never encountered alone.

Most groups include at least six members.

Pair (EL 2): A pair of whitespawn hordelings are probably

the only survivors of a recent battle.

EL 2: Two blood-spattered hordelings seek more of their

kind after a deadly  ght with orcs. They carry two severed

orc limbs as food.

Pack (EL 5): Whitespawn hordelings group into packs of

about six that form war parties. A single pack has most likely

split from the larger group to attack a separate target.

EL 5: Six whitespawn hordelings scout ahead of the rest of

a war party. They attack anything except chromatic dragons

or other spawn.

War Party (EL 79): A war party comprises two to four

packs. War parties range apart from the main horde, either

at the behest of a powerful and intelligent leader or when

most of the hordelings are involved in some other activity,

such as egg-laying.

EL 8: Twelve whitespawn hordelings attack a town, charg-

ing into the outlying houses in the dead of a winter night.

They were sent to test the towns defenses by a blackspawn

raider (see page 131), who watches from nearby.

Horde (EL 1018): Larger than war parties, hordes con-

tain up to 150 members, all of whom are combatants. One

hordeling barbarian exerts some control over the group, but

it is not much of a leader.

EL 11: Thirty-two whitespawn hordelings descend from

the mountains, led by a 5th-level hordeling barbarian. Fleeing

frost giants that attacked their tribe, they destroy everything

in their path.

Ecology

Whitespawn  hordelings  subsist  as  nomadic  hunters,  the

whole horde moving as one group. When prey is sighted,

the horde splits into packs and war parties. They approach

the quarry from several sides, then charge in to kill as many

creatures  as  they  can.  Because  hordelings  arent  adept  at

stealth, such attacks rarely catch all of a herd. Thus, they  ll

the role of natural predators: The healthiest and most alert

prey survive to propagate.

A horde never remains long in one place. The hordelings

leave lands theyve hunted out or those whose inhabitants

drive them away. Only mating season slows them down.

After the eggs are laid, the hordelings hunt down large or

numerous prey. They place the eggs within the carcasses and

await hatching. The reason for doing so

is unclear, since the bodies provide little

warmth to the eggs, and hordelings are

unaffected by cold. Whitespawn hordel-

ings say they want the young to hear the

call of blood, and this practice ensures

an immediate source of nourishment for

the hatchlings. The eggs hatch in about

a week, and the young mature swiftly.

Hordelings  rarely  live  long  past  their

prime.

Environment: Whitespawn hordel-

ings roam cold lands, rampaging from

one area to the next. Any sort of cold ter-

rain, from mountains to deserts, might

contain them.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:

White spawn horde-lings average 3-1/2

feet in height and 40 pounds in weight.

Females  have  slightly  narrower  shoul-

ders than males and weigh a bit less.

Alignment: Whitespawn hordelings

are usually chaotic evil. Their society is

savage and dedicated to the male cent

Tiamat. Rarely, a neutral evil hordeling

appears;  such  individuals  are  usually

clerics.  Lawful  or  good  hordelings  are

unheard-of.

Society

Whitespawn  hordelings  are  barely  more  intelligent  than

animals,  ruled  by  emotion  and  instinct  more  than  by

rational  thought.  Some  nevertheless  can  craft  crude  tools

and weapons of bone or horn. Their few cultural traditions

revolve around mating and egg laying.

The most threatening member of the horde becomes the

leader. Such leadership consists mainly of intimidation and

lasts only as long as the other hordelings fear and respect that

individual. The leader might be a barbarian, or occasionally a

cleric, but often its simply another hordeling thats meaner

than the rest.

Whitespawn  hordelings  grudgingly  accept  the  rule  of

other creatures, usually more intelligent and powerful spawn

of  Tiamat.  However,  they  willingly  serve  white  dragons,

which the hordelings worship as embodiments of Tiamat.

Whitespawn  hordelings  speak  a  crude  dialect  of

Draconic.

Typical Treasure

Whitespawn  hordelings  typically  have  no  treasure  other

than their weapons. Even leaders dont carry more than what

they need to  ght. Always on the move and trading with no

one, hordelings dont understand the concept of possessions,

which would only weigh them down.

Whitespawn Hordelings with Class Levels

Whitespawn hordelings favored class is barbarian, though few

live long enough to acquire such training. Clerics are usually

neutral evil and serve Tiamat, but most hordes lack them.

Whitespawn hordeling

Whitespawn Hordelings in Eberron

Whitespawn hordelings live mainly in the Frostfell and on

remote, northerly islands in the Lhazaar Principalities that

even the pirate lords dare not approach. The hordelings lack

the means to build boats, but every  ve years during the dead

of winter they engage in migrations,  uttering and swim-

ming across pack ice to other islands and even to Khorvaire.

Scholars of the planes note that these migrations coincide

with Risias coterminous period and are surely related. The

pirates,  and  occasionally  the  dwarves  of  the  Mror  Holds,

have so far dealt with these small incursions, but they worry

that a cold enough winter could form an ice bridge across

the Bitter Sea. Such an event would offer an easy crossing to

thousands of hordelings; if they were to establish a foothold

in the Demon Wastes, nothing would prevent them from

spreading across the continent.

Whitespawn Hordelings in Faern

Whitespawn  hordelings  can  be  found  wherever  white

dragons  live.  Some  sages  speculate  that  the  creatures  are

the result of inbreeding among half-white dragon kobolds,

but this theory doesnt explain their close associations with

white dragons. Metallic dragons say the hordelings appeared

in Faern recently (as dragons reckon time) and were loosed

on the world by Tiamat herself, but humanoid scholars scoff

at the idea that the god would create such stupid minions.

Skills Whitespawn hunters have a +4 racial bonus on

Whitespawn hunters are brutish, crafty stalkers of the frozen

realms. They revere Tiamat as the ultimate predator.

Strategies and Tactics

Whitespawn hunters track their prey for miles, staying out

of sight for as long as possible before launching an attack.

They try to trap their foes in terrain that limits escape, such

as ice  oes or chasms. Once con dent of the kill, after har-

rying opponents with their shortbows, they close and attack

with wild abandon. In melee, they take advantage of their

weapons reach.

Hunting groups prefer to keep one or more individuals out

of sight to watch the engagement, entering when reinforce-

ments are required or when victory seems certain.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Whitespawn  hunt-

ers average 5 feet in height and 125 pounds in weight. They

have white-scaled skin and wiry builds, and they move with

surprising grace. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer,

with less pronounced facial features than males.

Alignment: Whitespawn hunters are always chaotic evil.

They are single-minded when both hunting and committing

terrible acts of depravity, especially against their slaves.

Society

Life  among  whitespawn  hunters  is  brutal  and  short,  with

most  activity  dedicated  to  the  hunt.  Status  within  a  tribe

depends strictly on strength and the willingness to defend

ones position. Males are typically in charge, though in some

tribes powerful females dominate. When a tribe grows too

large to feed, the leader splits off, taking as many potential

mates and sturdy combatants with him as he can. Massive

bloodshed often results from such schisms.

After mating, female whitespawn hunters hide their eggs

inside icebergs and other isolated locations where tempera-

tures rarely rise above freezing, abandoning them to their

fate. The eggs hatch after six months, and the young must sur-

vive on their ownoften by devouring their weaker siblings.

The survivors are deemed strong enough to join the tribe

when it returns to the area, and they are taught additional

skills to become better hunters. Coming of age is a brutal

ritual: A pair of adolescents must undergo a hunt to bring

down a large and dangerous creature. They hunt together,

but only one can bring down the prey and earn adult status.

The other is either killed by the rest of the tribe or  ees into

the wilderness in hopes of creating his own tribefew such

individuals survive.

Sample Encounters

Whitespawn  hunters  prefer  to  travel  in  small  groups,  the

better to bring down prey. However, they are fractious and

competitive  by  nature  and  often   ght  among  themselves,

especially  when  dividing  the  spoils.  Leaders  often  ride

whitespawn iceskidders (see page 163).

Individual  (EL  4):  A  whitespawn  hunter  encountered

alone is usually a scout for the tribe.

EL  4:  After  a  run-in  with  a  band  of  orcs,  a  tribe  of

whitespawn  hunters  sends  out  individuals  to  track  down

their enemies.

Pair  (EL  6):  Most  whitespawn  hunters  travel  in  pairs.

When they encounter prey, one moves in to attack, and the

other hangs back to make a surprise attack at the optimal

moment.

EL 6: Two young whitespawn hunters are sent out to bring

down the largest game possible so they can be accepted as

adults  in  the  tribe.  They  cooperate  with  each  other  to  an

extent, but only one can win the right of adulthoodthe

loser is to be killed or exiled.

Hunting  Group  (EL  10):  A  hunting  group  generally

consists of two whitespawn hunters, a whitespawn berserker

with  a  whitespawn  iceskidder  mount,  and  an  additional

iceskidder. The group uses coordinated tactics to track and

ambush intruders into their territory. They attack anything

they deem edible (that is, most creatures).

Ecology

Whitespawn  hunters  prowl  the  frozen  realms  far  from

civilization. They live a nomadic lifestyle, following herds

of large, dangerous game such as dire elk, polar bears, and

even  remorhazes.  They  build  and  camp  in  easily  trans-

portable  huts,  which  are  hauled  by  slaves  or  whitespawn

hordelings.

Whitespawn  hunters  are  rapacious

meat-eaters and can quickly deplete an

areas stocks of game. When times are

lean, they subsist on carrion, the  esh

of slaves, and the bodies of fallen tribe

members. They even devour the bones,

leaving  virtually  nothing  behind  to

indicate their presence other than bits

of gore and tufts of fur.

Tribes of whitespawn hunters instinc-

tively  know  when  to  move  on  to   nd

richer game or to avoid the worst winter

storms. Their paths often intersect with

those of other tribes, resulting in open

warfare. The winning tribe seizes slaves

and mates from the loser.

Environment: Whitespawn hunters

inhabit the most desolate wastes, prefer-

ring cold plains and frozen waterways.

Occasionally a pack  nds its way into

a  mountainous  region  where  game  is

more plentiful.

Whitespawn berserker

159

Although rather unintelligent, whitespawn hunters value

slave labor. They sometimes capture sentient beings to use as

porters, entertainment, and food. Slaves rarely last more than

a few months, succumbing to their masters casual brutality

and the landscapes bitter cold. Dead slaves are unceremoni-

ously stripped and eaten by the tribe. Whitespawn hunters

sometimes dominate whitespawn hordelings. The hunters

despise their weak and inferior cousins and delight in boss-

ing them around. However, they are just as apt to kill and eat

hordelings as they are to command them.

Whitespawn hunters are uninterested in diplomacy; they

either slaughter or enslave anyone unable to stop them, or

they  avoid  more  powerful  creatures.  Tribes  occasionally

trade  with  other  evil  beings,  notably  orcs,  but  only  when

desperate. During these liaisons, they are happy to divulge

the location of other whitespawn hunter tribes to their trad-

ing partners, hoping to send potential attackers against their

competition.

Unlike most spawn, whitespawn hunters do not especially

venerate Tiamat. However, they do fear and respect her, and

tribes leave offerings from every kill to appease her. The most

elaborate altars to Tiamat boast the skull of a white dragon,

with small items of treasure occasionally laid beneath the

meat as additional offerings. Most hunters wear small icons

of ivory crudely carved in their deitys image.

Likewise,  whitespawn  hunters  do  not  revere  white

dragons;  they  respect  the  creatures  power  and  majesty

but also see them as competition for food. When times are

tough,  whitespawn  hunters  have  no  compunction  about

killing white dragons. Indeed, they consider such action a

testament to Tiamats desire to see the strongest triumph.

SAMPLE LAIR:

WHITESPAWN HUNTER

ENCAMPMENT

This map shows a typical whitespawn hunter encampment

within a winding ice  oe.

1. Wastestalker Yurt (EL 8)

The inside of the yurt is dark and rank. A pile of smelly furs sits

to one side, and the walls are adorned with the skulls of various

animalssome  not  readily  identifiable.  A  rack  made  of  bone

bears the weight of frozen hunks of meat.

The  leader  of  the  tribe,  a  4th-level  barbarian,  lives  in  this

crude yurt, along with his four noncombatant mates. No one

else may enter his yurt.

2. Communal Yurt

This large, open yurt is filthy. Hunks of meat dangle from ropes

in the center. Worn, disgusting pelts of yak, mastodon, and other

large mammals are scattered across the ground, providing places

to sit. Bits of bone litter the floor.

This large yurt is where the tribe gathers for feasts and meet-

ings. The few supplies used by the tribe are stored here, as

well as a small stock of meat.

3. Slave Pen (EL 7)

The back and sides of this pen butt up against a sheer wall of ice.

The remainder is crafted from blocks of ice, with a gate made of

an elaborate array of animal bones. The inside is utterly disgust-

ing,  filled  with  waste,  old  bonesand  the  corpse  of  a  young

male human.

The tribe currently has ten slaves: seven human common-

ers, two orc warriors, and an elf commoner. One slave has

recently died, but the tribe has not yet consumed his corpse.

At least three whitespawn hunters guard the pen at all times

when it is occupied.

4. Family Yurts (EL 67)

This yurt appears to be a family dwelling.

Each yurt shelters four to six individuals (half adults and

half  young).  The  high  ice  walls  buttress  the  backs  of  the

yurts and keep the wind out. An 80% chance exists that a

whitespawn hunter occupies a yurt. Each yurt has one or two

slaves inside at all times.

5. Meat Storage

This chamber has been rudely carved from the ice, providing a

place to store meat. It contains the carcasses of two elk, several

seals,  and  two  humanoids.  The  bodies  are  in  various  states  of

dismemberment, and some have been roughly hacked apart.

This larder, carved into the walls of ice, stores the bulk of

the tribes meat. It is guarded at all times by two whitespawn

hunters,  who  immediately  kill  anyone  who  dares  to  steal

meat.

6. Shrine to Tiamat

Whitespawn Hunters in Eberron

Whitespawn hunters live almost exclusively in the Frostfell,

stalking the tundra on the hunt for game and slaves. During

particularly harsh winters, when Risia is coterminous, hunt-

ers move farther south along drifting pack ice, sometimes

making landfall in the Lhazaar Principalities and the Demon

Wastes. During such campaigns, they typically command

tribes  of  whitespawn  hordelings  to  sweep  ahead  of  them,

softening up potential enemies and providing intelligence

for a successful hunt.

Whitespawn Hunters in Faern

Whitespawn  hunters  live  throughout  the  frozen  north  of

Faern, but most are found in Icewind Dale and the High

Ice north of Anauroch. They prey on the tribes of humanoid

barbarians and on hunters and  shers caught alone on the

windswept ice plains. Rumors persist of whitespawn hunter

encampments in parts of the Glacier of the White Worm.

The creatures avoid the Citadel of the White Worm, though,

WHITESPAWN ICESKIDDER

A  long,  lizardlike  creature  slides  toward  you  across  the  ice,  its

toothy maw gaping open and short legs pumping in unison to

ously until its target falls. It then slows down any remaining

enemies with its breath weapon and makes its escape with

the meal.

Sample Encounters

Whitespawn iceskidders are most likely to be encountered

alone or in pairs. Other creatures (usually spawn of Tiamat)

sometimes  tame  iceskidders  for  use  as  mounts  or  guard

beasts.

Pair  (EL  8):  A  trail  of  shallowly  buried  treasure  leads

through the snow to an ice cave in the side of a glacier, where

a mated pair of whitespawn iceskidders feed on their latest

kill. Runoff from the glacier roars through the cave in a rush-

ing stream, covering the sounds of intruders (Listen check

DCs increase by 5).

Whitespawn War Party (EL 69): Groups of whitespawn

hordelings  or  hunters  sometimes  patrol  on  iceskidder

mounts.

EL 7: A war party of six whitespawn hordelings attacks,

led by a 3rd-level hordeling barbarian and accompanied by a

whitespawn iceskidder. The barbarian and another hordeling

ride into battle on the iceskidders back, though they dont

really control its actions. When the iceskidder overruns a

foe, the hordelings jump off to attack the prone creature.

Family  (EL  910):  Adult  iceskidders  in  a  family  group

teach their young to hunt.

they hibernate in the warm season.

Although of only animal intelligence, whitespawn

iceskidders  are innately evil creatures. They

to terrorize prey.

Strategies and Tactics

Whitespawn  iceskidders  are  typically  solitary,  but  mated

pairs hunt together. An iceskidder attacks the weakest-look-

ing  creature  in  a  group,  hoping  for  a  quick  kill.  It  begins

combat by loosing its freezing breath to damage prey and

hold  it  in  place.  If  a  stronger-looking  creature  gets  in  the

way, the iceskidder attempts to overrun that foe (+16 on the

EL 9: Three whitespawn iceskidders are on the prowl

for a meal: a mother and father with their adoles-

cent child. The young iceskidder is

eager for food and attacks the

nearest creature immedi-

ately, forcing its parents

to  catch  their  child  in

their  breath  weapons

as they follow typical

iceskidder tactics. The

parents  wont  aban-

don the child, so they

 ght  until  it  regains

complete mobility.

Ecology

Whitespawn  iceskid-

ders  live  much  like

bears,  except  that

they  estivate  rather

than hibernate, sleeping

through  the  warm  season.

They  spend  most  of  their

lives  as  solitary  hunters  but

gather  once  a  year  to  mate.  Unlike  bears,

male  iceskidders  remain  with  their  mates,  hunting  with

the mother until the young reach adolescence. Just before

sending off the young iceskidders, the parents lead them on

a teaching hunt.

Despite their bestial natures, whitespawn iceskidders are

still spawn of Tiamat, and this heritage comes to the fore in

their dealings with other creatures. They relish terrorizing

prey, and even after carrying off a victim from a group, a

iceskidder  often  returns  to  attack  again.  Having  enough

food  already,  the  iceskidder  usually  doesnt  eat  victims  of

the second attackit kills for sheer pleasure.

Only chromatic dragons and spawn of Tiamat have any

chance of taming the beasts. White dragons use iceskidders

as  watchdogs,  allowing  them  to  live  within  their  lairs.

Whitespawn hordelings often brave iceskidder lairs to steal

their eggs and raise the hatchlings as mounts. The two crea-

tures are so often seen together that sages speculate they were

born of the same white dragon parent.

Environment:  Whitespawn  iceskidders  live  primarily

in cold marshes and plains, but any place with frozen water

makes a  ne home. They dwell in ice caves or dig dens in

mounds of packed snow, where they eat, mate, lay eggs, and

rear young.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An adult whitespawn

iceskidder measures roughly 11 feet from the end of the nose

to the tip of the tail. Its long, serpentine body weighs about

2,000 pounds.

Males  and  females  look  much  alike.  Only  whitespawn

iceskidders can tell the difference without close examina-

tion. Older individuals have broader scales and longer head

ridges than younger members of the race. Few iceskidders

live longer than about ten years.

Alignment: Cruel and animalistic, whitespawn iceskid-

ders are always chaotic evil.

Whitespawn iceskidder

Typical Treasure

Whitespawn iceskidders carry no treasure, but sometimes

they eat valuable items worn or carried by their prey. Typi-

cally, only gems and precious metals survive in an iceskidders

gullet, irritating its stomach so that it vomits them up. A 5%

chance exists that an iceskidder encountered outside its lair

has consumed some art objects, gems, or coins. An iceskid-

der lair contains standard treasure for the Encounter Level

(coins, gems, and metal items only), buried amid waste in

out-of-the-way spots within the cave.

Whitespawn Iceskidders in Eberron

Whitespawn iceskidders live in the Frostfell and sometimes

drift to Khorvaire or northerly islands of the Lhazaar Princi-

palities by clinging to icebergs that  oat across the Bitter Sea.

Once on land, the creatures seek out cold lands and might

inhabit unusual terrain, such as high mountain passes. One

that  arrives  on  the  mainland  might  travel  very  far  south,

especially during the bitterly cold winters that come every

 ve years when Risia is coterminous. These iceskidders often

get stranded in marshes when the ice retreats.

Whitespawn Iceskidders in Faern

Whitespawn iceskidders live and hunt in many cold lands,

but their populations are particularly large in the Icewind

Dale and in northern Vaasa, Damara, and Narfell. Winter

migrations push them farther south into Impiltur, the Great

Dale, and Thesk in the east and the northern Sword Coast

in the west.

Despite the beasts unsuitability for domestication, the Red

Wizards of Thay are very interested in iceskidders. They offer

5,000 gp for the capture of one and as much as 7,000 gp for

an iceskidder egg.

TOMB SPIDER

Tomb spiders are arachnoid creatures suffused with negative

energy. Their poison reverses healing spells and effects that

target the poisoned creature.

Tomb spiders plant their eggs in the corpses of humanoids.

A host animates as a web mummy, a zombielike mockery of

life. As the eggs hatch, hundreds of tiny tomb spiders swarm

inside the corpse. If released, they form a broodswarm that

 ows over opponents. Thus, the three basic life cycle stages of

a tomb spider are the web mummy, broodswarm, and adult.

Tomb-Tainted Soul (Ex) A tomb spider is healed by negative

energy and harmed by positive energy as if it were an

undead creature.

Skills Tomb spiders have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

and Spot checks, a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks, and

a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks. A tomb spider can

always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed

or threatened.

Tomb spiders have a strong connection to negative energy

and are signi cantly more dangerous than ordinary mon-

strous vermin.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Tomb  spiders,  broodswarms,  and  web  mummies   ght

straightforwardly when encountered alone. When in a mixed

group, a tomb spider ignores attacks against itself if its off-

spring (broodswarms or web mummies) are threatened. It

uses its webs against the most dangerous-looking foes, and

any broodswarms move over the trapped creature.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Tomb  spiders,  broodswarms,  and  web  mummies  can  be

encountered individually, but the most potent threats involve

combinations of multiple monsters.

Individual (EL 6): A tomb spider has recently moved to

richer hunting grounds near some isolated farms. Thus far,

only a few sheep and a dog have disappeared. Now that the

spider is ready to lay eggs, it aggressively seeks a humanoid

host.

Nest  (EL  8):  The  trail  from  a  tomb  spiders  recent  kill

leads back into its web-strewn lair. Two web mummies lurch

around the chamber, while a broodswarm scurries about the

webs. The tomb spider hides until the PCs attack, then jumps

them from behind.

ECOLOGY

Tomb  spiders  are  carnivorous  and  eat  prey  ranging  from

rabbits  to  horses.  However,  their  life  cycle  requires  them

to live near humanoids, monstrous humanoids, or giants in

order to reproduce.

All adult tomb spiders are capable of producing eggs. When

ready to reproduce, a tomb spider  nds a suitable corpse (or

kills such a creature), implants its eggs, and wraps the corpse

in webbing. The host corpse animates as a web mummy and

protects  its  creator.  The  eggs  swiftly  hatch,  and  the  baby

spiders begin to feed on the decaying internal organs of the

host. Under ideal conditions, the individual spiderlings then

proceed to eat each other until a single fully-formed adult

emerges some weeks later. However, a web mummy is often

destroyed before the entire maturation process is complete,

releasing a broodswarm of immature spiders. Rarely, an adult

tomb spider can arise from an immature broodswarm,

but without the protective environment of the web

mummy, most such young quickly die.

Environment:  Tomb  spiders  prefer  to  live  in

temperate forests at the fringes of civilization. They

roam  underground,  looking  for  burial  crypts  or

similar locations that have ready access to surface

settlements. Once they  nd a suitable location, they

begin infesting any corpses that they  nd. When

they have depleted the ready supply of bodies, they

begin hunting surface lands.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  Large

tomb  spider  is  a  dead-gray,  spindly  creature

approximately 10 feet in diameter and weighing

500 pounds. Individuals can be as large as 20 feet

across and weigh up to 2,000 pounds.

Newly hatched spiderlings of a broodswarm are

bright red in color, darkening to gray within the

 rst few weeks of life.

A  web  mummy  begins  with  the  proportions

and  weight  of  the  original  host.  As  the  brood-

swarm  inside  feeds  on  the  hosts  organs,  the

mummys weight decreases and that of the swarm

increases.

Alignment:  Tomb  spiders  are  corrupted  by

negative energy and are always neutral evil.

SOCIETY

While tomb spiders have basic intelligence, they have no true

society, nor do they speak any language. Their sole concerns

are survival and reproduction. For the most part, they are

solitary, with their own hunting territories, but they share

space if prey is plentiful.

Drow  and  driders  honor  all  spiderkind  and  encourage

tomb  spiders  to  nest  near  the  borders  of  their  territories,

whether  between  drider  and  drow  settlements  or  beside

the lands of other creatures. Prisoners and corpses become

treats for the tomb spiders. The spiders look forward to these

meals and dont attack their feeders unless very hungry or

provoked.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Tomb spiders do not collect or hoard treasure, but their lairs

contain  standard  treasure  for  their  Encounter  Level.  This

treasure  represents  the  possessions  of  creatures  killed  for

food or implantation.

TOMB SPIDERS IN EBERRON

Tomb spiders inhabit the wilds of Xendrik. Small numbers

of them have also migrated to Khorvaire in recent years in

the holds of ships. Most dwell in forest areas near port towns,

but individual creatures or small nests have been found in

Sharn, Wyvernskull, and even Vralkek. These tomb spiders

have adapted to urban environments, living in cellars and

sewer systems.

VARAG

This humanoid stands close to 7 feet tall when fighting but moves

and runs on all fours. It has a hunched posture, double-jointed

hind  legs,  and  thick,  sinewy  skin.  The  creature  bears  a  slight

resemblance to a hairy and ferocious hobgoblin, but it has a more

primitive countenance and two curving horns that sweep away

from its skull. It wields a cleaverlike scimitar.

Varags are a feral goblinoid race. This result reveals

all humanoid traits.

Varags pursue their quarry with unfettered

abandon. Fast and agile, a varag can sweep past an

opponent, strike a deadly blow, and scramble away

before the target can react.

Varags are silent killers. Even when running at full

speed, they are surprisingly quiet.

Varags are chaotic and difficult to control. They are

easiest to defeat when forced to stand and fight.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Varags are capable of great stealth and seek to catch their

opponents unaware whenever possible. They initiate combat

by pouncing from afar, using their superior speed to great

advantage.

Varags rely more on their sense of smell to track enemies

than on sight or hearing. Feral and chaotic, they hate  ght-

ing in close formation or under the tight command of an

of cer. They are naturally attracted to  eeing opponents

and  eagerly  run  them  down,  even  at  great  person-

al risk. Varags tend to scatter across the

battlefield,  picking  off  routing

warriors and entering the fray

only  when  they  sense

the prospect of fresh

meat and loot.

Varags  rely  on

Spring  Attack  to

wear  down  op-

ponents.  They

surround  ene-

mies  and  take

turns  attack-

ing.  Half  the

pack  stands  back

to  block  escape,  while

the rest dart in and out

of melee. Varags prefer

to attack lightly armored,

weaker  creatures  rather

than tough, protected  enemies.

Varags avoid static lines of battle.

If faced with well-organized, nu-

merous opponents, they employ

hit-and-run tactics. By the time

their  enemies  ready  a  counterat-

tack, the varags are long gone.

In the blink of an eye, they were upon us. By the

time I readied my axe, Bertold, Dargr, and Xelden were

down and the things were gone.

Keltra, half-orc lieutenant

of the Iron Spire Brigade

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Varags are natural runners that doggedly pursue retreating

foes regardless of how dangerous the hunt becomes, deter-

mined to catch their quarry or die trying.

Individual (EL 1): A single varag is not an uncommon

encounter when withdrawing from a hobgoblin  battle eld.

EL 1: Durel is so determined to run down his quarry that

he became separated by several miles from his hobgoblin

allies.

Hunting Pack (EL 24): Hunting packs comprising two to

four varags ef ciently root out  eeing opponents. Each varag

designates a target, then they all strike  simultaneously.

EL 3: Belik, Garlon, and Thokas make sport of terri ed ene-

mies running for their lives, keeping tallies of their kills.

Driving Brigade (EL 59): A driving brigade consists of

 ve to eight varags and a pack leader.

EL 7: Kilard, a 4th-level varag scout, takes his brigade of six

varags deep into enemy territory to plow through and dis-

hearten armies as they approach or leave hobgoblin battles.

ECOLOGY

In the wild, varags alternate between long periods of rest

and  brief,  bloody  spurts  of  violence.  A  pack  might  slowly

cross  a  stretch  of  uninhabited

wasteland  until  it  nears  a

human  settlement,  then

attack  with  murderous

glee. Varags on the move

are  easy  to  track  by  the

burning  settlements,

ravaged  farms,  and

gnawed  corpses  they

leave in their wake.

Varags  require

three times the nor-

mal  intake  of  food

that  other  Medium

creatures  do,  in  order

to  maintain  their  great

speed and stam-

ina. Those that

do  not  meet

this nutrition-

al requirement

are less effective

hunters. A varag

that  eats  only

twice the normal

amount of a Medi-

um  creature  must  spend

most of its time sleeping to

conserve energy. One whose daily intake is only that

of a Medium creature has its speed reduced to 30 feet

until it can consume adequate food.

Hobgoblins like to use these feral goblinoids to supple-

ment their armies, but because of varags high food demands,

only the wealthy can support them. If not properly cared

for, the weakened varags die off in battle or ally themselves

with more powerful hobgoblin bands that can feed them

regularly.

Varags understand Goblin but are barely able to speak.

Their primitive physiology makes forming complex words

dif cult,  while  their  low  intellects  leave  them  unable  to

learn  much.  Many  varags  lack  language  altogether,  com-

municating among themselves with hand gestures, howls,

and shrieks.

Varag females gestate for  ve to six months before giving

birth to two or three children. A varag grows up quickly

and is considered an adult by the age of eight. Mothers care

for their children for half of this time. At one year of age,

a  young  varag  already  consumes  the  same  daily  amount

of food as an adult hobgoblin. Allowing male and female

varags to freely interact can be dangerous. Left unchecked,

169

they continually mate until their birth rates severely tax

local resources.

Environment: Varags inhabit warm hills but can survive

in colder regions with no dif culty. They also sleep comfort-

ably in underground burrows, though they are not naturally

equipped to dig out such dens.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Varags stand approxi-

mately 7 feet tall when  ghting and weigh 320 pounds on

average. Varags move and run on all fours, in which posture

they are 3 to 4 feet high at the shoulder. Females are smaller

than males, but no less  eet of foot. Varag body language

mimics the behavior of wolves.

Alignment: Varags encountered by PCs are usually cha-

otic evil. They are wild creatures that would easily devolve

into a near-animal state were it not for the civilizing effect

of the hobgoblins who employ them.

SOCIETY

Varags  behavior  is  distinctly  canine,  the  result  of  special

breeding.  They  are  the  magical  product  of  commingling

hobgoblins  and  dire  wolves.  The  resulting  race  has  bred

true ever since.

Hobgoblins employ varags as mercenaries. In exchange

for  high-quality  weapons,  armor,  and  other  treasures,

the varags serve as scouts and marauders. Varags chaotic

nature makes them dif cult to control, so hobgoblin war-

lords simply allow them to run rampant. A varag pack that

accepts payment to overrun a kingdom loots farms, burns

settlements to the ground, and kills all in its path.

Varags  are  highly  valued  members  of  any  hobgoblin

warband.  They  offer  strong  backup  during  battlefield

engagements  and  ruthlessly  pursue  retreating  enemies.

Varags can also follow simple orders, such as the ferrying

of  healing  potions  to  wounded  soldiers.  They  naturally

look  for  strong  role  models  to  guide  them  and  offer

encouragement.

Hobgoblins  are  exceedingly  fond  of  varags.  Every

member of a warband knows that a varag could easily  at-

ten him in combat without breaking a sweat, and none take

for granted the dim-witted creatures dependence. Varags

receive generous praise for even the smallest accomplish-

ments  and  always  eat  well.  The  creatures  in  turn  have

developed an instinctive affection for all hobgoblins, which

they openly and unabashedly express. Varags protect hob-

goblins at all costs. Whenever one witnesses a hobgoblin

being attacked or in need of help, it immediately rushes to

aid without the slightest concern for its safety.

Varags  intense  devotion  wanes  when  food  becomes

scarce. The more they are forced to provide sustenance for

themselves,  the  more  restless  they  become,  seeking  out

other hobgoblins who can feed them. If they become des-

perate enough, varags might even serve goblins and orcs. To

control the creatures population growth and avoid overtax-

ing food resources, one central and well-protected warband

keeps a stable of only female varags. Breeding occurs only

in controlled meetings when more varags are desired.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Varags have standard treasure for NPCs of their Challenge

Rating, about 600 gp. Their  ghting style precludes the use

of shields; reroll any such result.

VARAGS WITH CLASS LEVELS

Varags  favored  class  is  scout,  whose  abilities  complement

their quickness and hunting talents. Varag clerics worship

Maglubiyet. His domains are Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and

Trickery. His favored weapon is the battleaxe.

Level Adjustment: +2.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS:

THE VARAG RACIAL CLASS

If your DM allows it, you can play a varag character. While these

creatures are vile and evil in most settings, they can be viable

characters. This is especially true in the EBERRON campaign

setting,  where  alignment  is  less  restrictive,  and  monstrous

creatures often share settlements with normal player races.

Normally, you cant begin with a 1st-level varag character

because of the races level adjustment. With your DMs per-

mission, however, you can use the varag racial class presented

here to begin play, though you dont gain the full comple-

ment  of  abilities  granted  by  the  race  until  you  are  more

experienced. In essence, you are applying the varags level

adjustment to your character over time, increasing effective

character level (ECL) gradually rather than all at once. Effec-

tive character level equals the varags racial level on the Varag

Racial Class table that follows.

It cannot be gained later during a characters career if it is

not initially chosen.

Class Features

The  following  features  are  gained  by  characters  who  take

varag racial levels that are integrated with a standard class.

Class Level: The Class Level column of the varag racial

class table indicates whether a varag gains a standard class

level at any given racial level. Some racial levels provide a

standard  class  level,  while  others  provide  a  varag-speci c

ability.  Class  levels  grant  all  the  bene ts  normally  associ-

ated  with  a  level  increase,  including  another  Hit  Die  and

increasing base attack bonus, base saves, and ability scores,

along with other class features.

Racial  Hit  Die:  1st-  through  5th-level  varags  do  not

possess class levels. Instead, they gain racial Hit Dice and

abilities.

At  1st  level,  the  varags   rst  racial  Hit  Die  grants  8  hit

points and +0 base attack bonus, and base saves of Fortitude

+0, Re ex +2, and Will +0. A 1st-level varag gains a number

of skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er [minimum 1])  4.

Its racial class skills are Jump, Move Silently, and Survival.

At 2nd level, a varag gains an additional 1d8 hit points and

+1 base attack bonus, and base saves of Fortitude +0, Re ex

+3, and Will +0. A 2nd-level varag gains a number of addi-

tional skill points equal to 2 + Int modi er (minimum 1).

At 4th level, a varag gains an additional 1d8 hit points and

+0 base attack bonus, and base saves of Fortitude +1, Re ex

+3, and Will +1. A 4th-level varag gains a number of additional

skill points equal to 2 + Int modi er (minimum 1).

Varag Base Traits: Varags have the following base racial

traits.

+2 Strength, 4 Intelligence.

Medium size: Varags have no special bonuses or penal-

ties due to their size.

Humanoid (goblinoid): A varag is a humanoid that has

the goblinoid subtype.

Varag base land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

+4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a +4 racial

bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

Automatic  Languages:  Goblin.  Bonus  Languages:

Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Infernal, Giant, Orc.

Favored Class: Scout (Complete Adventurer 10).

Natural Armor (Ex): A varags skin is tough, and it tough-

ens further as the varag doesat 1st level, a varag has a +1

natural armor bonus. At 3rd level, a varags natural armor

bonus  increases  to  +2.  The  varags  natural  armor  bonus

increases to +3 at 5th level.

Feat: Like every other character, a varag character gains

one  feat  at  1st  level  and  another  at  every  Hit  Dice  total

divisible by 3. These feats are in addition to any bonus feats

granted as class features or any other bonus feats.

Ability Score Increases: At 2nd level, a varag characters

Dexterity  score  increases  by  2.  At  3rd  level,  Constitution

increases by 2. At 4th level, Dexterity increases again by 2,

and at 5th level, Strength increases by 2.

Upon attaining any Hit Die total divisible by 4, a varag

character increases one ability score by 1 point, as any char-

acter does. The player chooses which ability score to improve

in this case. The ability improvement is permanent.

Scent  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  a  varag  gains  scent,  but  this

ability has a range of 10 feet instead of the normal 30 feet.

Beginning at 3rd level, the range increases to 20 feet. At

4th level, it increases to 30 feet, becoming the normal scent

ability.

Run: At 2nd level, a varag gains Run as a bonus feat.

Move Silently: At 3rd level, a varags racial bonus on Move

Silently checks improves by +4, for a total of +8. Upon reach-

Spring Attack: At 5th level, a varag gains Spring Attack

as a bonus feat.

VARAGS IN EBERRON

Long ago, Khorvaire was the playground of hobgoblins, who

bred goblins and bugbears as slaves and warriors. In the same

way, varags once toiled for the hobgoblins. With the fall of

the Dhakaani empire, varags now roam across the land, raid-

ing and killing as they please. Of all the goblinoids, varags

are the most likely to wander far from Darguun and other

humanoid lands.

VARAGS IN FAERN

Varags  have  easily  carved  out  a  corner  for  themselves  in

Faern through sheer physical might. Clearly stronger than

hobgoblins and goblins, varags provide a challenge even for

bugbears. When it comes to thinking through a challenge,

however, bugbears beat the chasers every time.

Oath Bond (Su) A verdant prince can strike a powerful

supernatural bargain with another willing creature. The

bargain can be nearly anything, but must involve an

exchange of services or goods. A verdant prince can make

an oath bond with only one creature at a time.

If either party does not hold up its end of the bargain, it

takes a 6 penalty to all ability scores and is sickened until

the bargain is fulfilled. When a bargain isnt fulfilled, the

wronged party becomes immediately aware of the broken

oath and gains a constant awareness of the oathbreakers

distance and direction. This awareness does not extend

across the boundaries of planes, but it does relate the

information that an oathbreaker is not on the same plane.

Only death or a wish or miracle spell can end an

oath bond before the bargain is fulfilled or negate the

penalties that a broken oath bond imposes. When the

oath bond is negated by death or magic, the other party

becomes aware that the oath was ended or suppressed

but not how or where.

Unearthly Grace (Su) A verdant prince adds its Charisma

modifier as a bonus on saving throws, and as a deflection

bonus to Armor Class. Included above.

Verdant  princes  lend  aid  to  those  in  need  and  grant  the

desires of the greedy, but those who strike a bargain with the

fey understand too late what theyve given up in exchange.

Tyrants  among  faeriekind,  verdant  princes  employ  formi-

dable spellcasting ability and magic items.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

A verdant prince  ghts much like a sorcerer or wizard. It typi-

cally begins combat by casting changestaff to create a treant

ally to engage in melee. The prince then retreats to a hard-

to-reach spot, such as a high tree branch, from which it can

cast spells at foes and use magic items. The verdant prince

fears foes wielding cold iron and uses repel metal or stone and

wall of thorns to keep them at bay. If engaged in melee, it uses

Tumble and dimension door to escape.

A verdant prince remains in combat for as long as possible,

casting cure critical wounds to heal and employing spells and

items until they run out. If, despite these efforts, the fey ends

up in dire straits, it  ees for a few rounds using dimension door

to gain some distance and then hides and uses disguise self in

hopes of fooling its foes. If successful in  eeing, a verdant

prince often returns to the scene of the battle the next day

to track foes and gain revenge through some ambush.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

The  rst encounter with a verdant prince seems inoffensive,

if  a  bit  sinister.  Princes  prefer  to  bargain  with  those  they

encounter and to strike a favorable oath bond. They often

use  disguise  self  to  appear  less  threatening  and  offer  aid  in

exchange for something they desire. Verdant princes often

employ evil fey or plant creatures as allies in battle, using

them as shields against melee combat.

music that signals an approaching victim. When the targets

enter the glade, the dryads and satyrs attempt to pacify them

with suggestion and charm person. If that ploy works, the ver-

dant prince shows itself to make an oath bond with the most

pliable person. If the ploy fails, the nymphs reveal themselves

to blind and stun foes, then everyone attacks.

ECOLOGY

Dryads or nymphs who mate with verdant princes, or who

are themselves evil, sometimes give birth to verdant princes.

Verdant princes mature swiftly after birth, becoming full-

grown  and  independent  after  a  season.  Powerful  and

convinced of their superiority, verdant princes care little

for their mothers and typically despise their fathers, even

if either parent was also a verdant prince. Like many other

fey, verdant princes are nearly immortal.

Verdant  princes  have  a  diet  much  like  that  of  humans

but require one-third of the food a human of the same size

needs. Thus, verdant princes have little impact on the envi-

ronment and often rely on fey servants to fetch them what

they require.

Environment: Verdant princes prefer temperate forests

but can live in any environment that sustains humans.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  verdant  prince

stands about 6 feet in height. Slender yet muscular, it looks

humanoid  with  a  number  of  plant  features.  Most  verdant

princes leaves and moss remain green throughout the year.

A few, however, turn color with the seasons; some princes

even lose their leaves in the fall.

Alignment: Verdant princes are born mischievous; their

cruel streak increases as they mature over the course of a

season. By maturity, nearly all become evil, but a few might

be more lawful or chaotic than others. Students of fey lore

hypothesize that a verdant princes alignment and vile nature

varies according to the season of birth. Spring princes tend to

be chaotic but less cruel, while winter princes cleave rigidly

to their words (even when not an oath bond) but are more

despicably black-hearted than most.

SOCIETY

Verdant princes are leaders of evil fey and plant creatures.

Those  that  reside  long  in  a  verdant  princes  realm  often

become evil over time as they repeatedly acquiesce to their

lords will and participate in its plots.

A  verdant  prince  lives  to  ful ll  its  sel sh  desires.  The

creature  lairs  in  a  home  built  by  its  subjects,  sups  on  the

fruit of their labor, bene ts from them as spies, and takes

whatever it desires. Although frequently cruel and imperi-

ous to individuals, a verdant prince makes an effort to appear

magnanimous and forgiving to its subjects at large.

This fey delights in tricking a creature into an oath bond

that leads to anguish and despair. The verdant prince takes

care to ful ll its end of the bargain while requesting some-

thing that seems innocuous but will cause strife.

TYPICAL

TREASURE

A verdant prince typically possesses double standard treasure

for its Challenge Rating, approximately 15,000 gp. This trea-

sure is almost always magic items from defeated foes. Having

no power to detect magic, verdant princes plunder only obvi-

ous magic such as wands, scrolls, potions, and staffs. They

give other treasureto underlings or to creatures who enter

into oath bonds with them.

VERDANT PRINCES IN FAERN

Unknown  to  all  but  the  eldest  son  and  daughter  of  each

generation,  the  Adarbrent  noble  family  of  Waterdeep  has

for decades sent their  rstborn to the Kryptgarden forest to

pledge an oath to King Witchthorn, a verdant prince. These

children must perform an unspeci ed service for the prince

by their eleventh year. In exchange, the familys businesses

and homes gain secret fey guardians. The bargain has worked

well for the family; King Witchthorn has never asked any-

thing of them. Now the Adarbrents view the verdant prince

as a fatherly benefactor, thinking nothing of chaining another

generation to whatever dark plans the fey has in store.

VITREOUS DRINKER

This hunched, shambling figure might be able to pass for human

except for the bulging, wet eyes that cover every inch of its skin,

and  the  long,  repulsively  prehensile  tongue  that  lolls  from  its

gaping  mouth.  Several  translucent,  shadowy  ravens  circle  the

creatures head, their beaks open in silent cries.

Eye Drinking (Su) A vitreous drinker can use its lashing tongue

to magically steal a creatures ability to see. This ability has

no effect on creatures that lack sight. A creature struck by

the drinkers tongue must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude

save. On a failed save, the creatures eyes become covered

with thick, milky cataracts. The creature cannot see farther

than 60 feet, and all melee and ranged attacks it makes

within this range have a 20% miss chance. This effect can

be removed only with greater restoration or miracle, or by

the destruction of the drinker that stole the victims sight.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

A creature who has its sight stolen has a 4 penalty

on Will saves made to resist the vitreous drinkers

abilities and any of its spell-like abilities. The victim

cannot avert its eyes to avoid the drinkers horrific gaze

(see below).

A vitreous drinker can see through the eyes of a

creature whose eyes it drinks, using the victims full,

normal sight. It does not suffer the restrictions and

penalties imposed on a victim of eye drinking. The range

and duration of this ability have no limit, though the

drinker can view through only one victims eyes at a time.

A drinker uses its own Spot skill to view details through

the victims eyes and benefits from its darkvision.

Horrific Gaze (Su) A vitreous drinkers disgusting visage

revolts even the strongest soul. A drinker has a gaze

attack with a range of 60 feet that causes a creature to be

nauseated for 1 round. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save

negates this effect, but a creature must attempt another

save each round it remains within range of the gaze. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Spectral Ravens (Su) A vitreous drinker is accompanied

at all times by spectral ravens that serve the drinker

unconditionally. The drinker shares a powerful symbiotic

link with the spectral ravens. It is constantly aware of what

they see and hear and can direct them as a free action.

The ravens are incorporeal, and a vitreous drinker can

control them as long as they remain on the same plane

as the drinker. The ravens are not creatures, but rather

objects spawned by the drinker. Each raven has 5 hit

points and AC 15. Otherwise, treat them as unattended,

Tiny objects. A vitreous drinker is accompanied by up to

twenty-four ravens, and if any are destroyed, the creature

can restore them at a rate of one per day.

The ravens have a fly speed of 100 feet and perfect

maneuverability. They cannot take independent action,

nor can they do anything to physically affect the world

around them. They exist solely to observe.

Unholy Grace (Su) A vitreous drinker adds its Charisma

modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and as a

deflection bonus to its AC. Included above.

A vitreous drinker is a horri c undead servitor of Vecna. This

creature steals its preys sight, rendering the victim partially

blind. Worst of all, a vitreous drinker can see through its

victims eyes. As servitors of Vecna, vitreous drinkers use

their  ability  to  pry  secrets  away  from  sages,  wizards,  and

other  wise  folk.  The  knowledge  a  vitreous  drinker  accu-

mulates is as fearsome a weapon as its deadly magical and

physical abilities.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Vitreous drinkers settle within towns, cities, or other civi-

lized  areas.  They  use  their  eye  drinking  ability  on  a  wide

range of animals and people within the city or region they

haunt. A single vitreous drinker might ambush and drink the

sight of beggars across the city. These victims are unwitting

sentinels for the drinker, forming a living network of spies

and watchers that it can access at a moments notice. A crafty

drinker that plans ahead can track every movement that an

adventuring party or other target makes in town. If a creature

it has targeted wanders to a spot where it lacks spies, a vitre-

ous drinker uses its spectral ravens to tail the target.

A  vitreous  drinker  is  a  spy,  in ltrator,  and  information

broker. It shies away from direct confrontation unless doing

so is in its best interest. Instead, a vitreous drinker prefers

to ambush its enemies, use its eye drinking ability, and then

retreat to spy upon the victim and its allies. With its excellent

Spot skill, the drinker attempts to read the lips of anyone its

victim can see.

In  most  cases,  a  vitreous  drinker  works  with  powerful

clerics of Vecna. A single drinker might sit at the center of a

wide-ranging network of spies, informants, and in ltrators.

It  gathers  information  for  whatever  goals  it  pursues.  Some

drinkers seek to destabilize an area, weakening its government

and institutions to help usher in a wave of chaos. Others help

various evil groups achieve their goals, either by passing along

information to the group or harassing and slaying its foes.

A vitreous drinker is most dangerous when it has power-

ful allies to call on. A drinker might work with an assassins

guild, for example, helping the killers formulate plans to cut

down a paladin, cleric of good, or other heroic  gure.

In combat, a vitreous drinker  ees unless it is cornered

or it feels it can defeat its enemies. It uses  nger of death

early in the battle to strike down someone who looks vul-

nerable (such as an arcane spellcaster or rogue), followed

by eyebite. Its goal is to weaken its foes, then use vampiric

touch to sap their strength while steadying itself

against any counterattacks. It saves dimension

door as a last resort to escape harm.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

When  a  vitreous  drinker  goes  on  the

offensive,  it  prefers  to  use  hit-and-run

tactics. It attempts to strike a victim

with  its  eye  drinking  ability,

 ee,  and  then  view  its  ene-

mies to learn as much about

their  tactics  as  possible.  It

then  plans  an  appropriate

second attack.

Individual (EL 11): A vit-

reous drinker uses its spectral

ravens to track a partys move-

ment.  Over  the  course  of  several

days,  it  ventures  out  to  use  its  eye

drinking  ability  on  beggars  and  other

unfortunates  in  the  area.  Once  the

drinker  can  watch  as  much  of  the

partys  movements  as  possible,

it  makes  plans  to  ambush  and

attack the weakest member.

Even  then,  it  avoids  a

direct  ght. It uses eye-

bite to hamper a victim,

then  drinks  the  crea-

tures eyes.

ECOLOGY

As undead, vitreous drinkers have no true ecology. The crea-

tures were reputedly created by Vecna for some nefarious

purpose. Some legends state that Vecna actually advises each

of the vitreous drinkers, directing them to some unknown

end. Across countless worlds and the in nite planes, vitreous

drinkers work together to ful ll Vecnas unguessable aims.

Environment:  Vitreous  drinkers  can  be  found  in  any

climate  and  any  terrain.  Urban  slums  with  high  crime

rates, charnel houses, and battle elds are common places to

encounter vitreous drinkers, but they can be found anywhere

where death has a foothold.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Vitreous  drinkers

are  bipedal,  human-shaped  beings  roughly  6  feet  tall  and

weighing 150 pounds. Their bodies are genderless, and as

undead, they do not age.

Alignment: Vitreous drinkers are always neutral evil, as

be ts creatures so closely aligned with Vecna.

SOCIETY

Vitreous drinkers dwell alone. They rarely work together,

since  their  abilities  are  best  suited  for  a  wide,  dispersed

effort. They do work with clerics of Vecna, but they pass

the  information  they  gather  along

to  anyone  who  can  help  them

achieve  their  mysterious  goals.  A

vitreous drinker is just as likely to

give  information  to  an  orc  warlord

as  to  a  brave  paladin  if  it  feels  that

either  would  use  the  information

in a manner that helps the drinker.

An  adventuring  party  could  even

unwittingly serve Vecna under the

right circumstances. A drinker usu-

ally has humanoid allies responsible

for  passing  information  from  the

drinker to others in town, who

then pass it higher up the chain

of  command  to  Vecnas  senior

mortal representatives.

WINDBLADES IN EBERRON

Windblades make their homes in the constantly changing,

chaotic plane of Kythri. Within the Churning Chaos, they

practice and perfect their techniques of slaughter on those

slaadi  and  githzerai  unlucky  enough  to  cross  their  path.

Windscythe  sages  speak  of  the  times  when  Kythri  was

coterminous, and their people brought great slaughter into

the material world.

Windblades might also be encountered within manifest

zones linked to Kythri. Some tribes have survived on Eber-

ron since the planes last coterminous phase. They form small

groups  in  high,  windy,  mountainous  regions,  such  as  the

peaks of Adar in southern Sarlona and the Skyraker Claws

mountains along the north coast of Xendrik.

Erythnul  is  unknown  in  Eberron;  instead,  windscythe

clerics revere the Fury, embodying the passion the god rep-

resents.

WINDBLADES IN FAERN

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, the windblades were cre-

ated by Talos the Destroyer as a force to ride the currents of

his storms and bring destruction in their wake. They make

their  home  within  Furys  Heart,  traveling  to  Toril  when

called by servants of the Storm Lord. Clerics of Talos often

call windblades to augment the destruction wrought by true

believers. A small tribe of windblades is also rumored to be

moving around the Sea of Fallen Stars, sticking to regions

of high cliffs and peaks around the Inner Sea.

WINDRAZOR

A  gangly  creature,  all  gawky  limbs  and  flaps  of  leathery  skin,

drifts through the air. At the tips of its wings are short, sharp,

bony blades. Its elongated skull boasts knobby, hornlike protru-

sions, and its mouth is full of long, sharp teeth.

Windrazor

Strategies and Tactics

Windrazors are pack hunters. They seek prey together, and

together they bring it down.

In combat, windrazors make effective use of Flyby Attack,

approaching in waves, swooping in, delivering claw attacks,

and  ying away again. This ensures that only foes who ready

attacks ever get a chance to strike back in melee, while maxi-

mizing the number of windrazors that can attack.

The in uence of their brutal patron deity leads windra-

zors to favor full attacks (with the potential for rending)

against  wounded  foes.  Otherwise,  the  creatures  linger

near an opponent only if it is poorly armored and otherwise

easy to hit (not protected by magical effects, for example).

WINDSCYTHE

A heavily muscled creature, long of limb with flaps of leath-

ery skin, powers through the air, its extended, bladelike tail

sweeping  along  behind  it.  At  the  tips  of  its  wings,  short,

bony blades clutch at the wind, as though grasping at the

flesh of unseen prey. The fliers narrow skull is crowned with

knobby, hornlike protrusions, and its mouth is full of sharp

teeth. It wears a tunic of chain armor, and a quiver of javelins

is slung low across its back.

Windscythe

Windscythes are the warriors, nobles, tyrants, and priests

of  the  windblades.  Brutish,  violent  creatures  with  a  vora-

cious appetite for raw  esh, windscythes soar through their

domain with the bearing of royalty. Like other windblades,

they were created by Erythnul, god of slaughter, and they

exult  in  ful lling  his  brutal  desires,  spreading  death  and

fear whenever they can.

. . . of the depths of Pandemonium, the dangers are

many, not the least of which are the razors on the winds,

for they hunt and kill with great fervor, slicing with

unseen blades; call on them with caution . . .

Excerpt from On Summoning

Strategies and Tactics

Windscythes  are  cunning  killers,  willing  to  use  any

stratagem to accomplish their goals, from hunting alone to

employing packs of windrazors.

A  windscythes  favorite  combat  tactic  is  a  Flyby  Attack

through  a  group,  attempting  to  shake  opponents  with  its

fearsome critical ability. It continues this strategy until the

foes have dispersed, then selects one of the isolated creatures

to attack with its claws or bite. Multiple windscythes work

in concert to speed up the dispersal process, then combine

their attacks on isolated foespreferably spellcasters  rst.

When  hunting  with  windrazors,  windscythes  let  their

smaller cousins lead the charge, employing them as shock

troops or directing them to herd opponents into convenient

groupings for the windscythes to slice through.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Windrazors usually hunt in packs, sometimes led by wind-

scythes or demons in the service of Erythnul. They are also

occasionally sent to the Material Plane to guard temples of

Erythnul, where they can be found in the company of mortal

priests, bugbears, trolls, and other fell creatures. The windra-

zor  ight is the most common encounter.

Windscythes rarely hunt alone; they know that they are

more  dangerous  in  numbers  and  more  vulnerable  singly.

A windscythe tries to travel with an escort of at least two

windrazors. Windscythes are frequently found in the com-

pany of other creatures that serve Erythnul, and with them,

windscythes  nd their way to the Material Plane.

Windrazor Pair (EL 2): Fuuar and Thua n are scouts sent

to the Material Plane to serve a powerful bugbear shaman

dedicated to Erythnul. The creatures have little respect for

their  savage  hosts,  so  they  spend  most  of  their  time  away

from the bugbear encampment. They are likely to run afoul

of the adventurers either during one of their scouting runs

or when the party has been drawn into the area in response

to the depredations of the bugbear tribe.

Windrazor Flight (EL 4): Surrussh, Fllist, Hwool, and

Luluru are engaged in a prisoner hunt for their windscythe

masters. They are most interested in a creature that moves

quickly, to provide their masters more sport.

Escort (EL 4+): Windrazors sometimes accompany other

servants of the god of slaughter as guards.

EL 4: Thurush and Lishae, two windrazors brought to the

Material Plane by priests of Erythnul, serve as escorts for a

quasit  named  Kamatherdin.  The  quasit  carries  important

messages from one temple to another. With a higher speed

and the ability to turn invisible, the quasit is quite willing to

abandon its windrazor escorts to delay any attackers while it

makes its escape.

Individual Windscythe (EL 4): Hurrall is a bold young

male windscythe who has set off on his own to prove his

bravery to the rest of his wing. Now, apart from them for days

and growing increasingly worried that he could fall victim

to an even more deadly predator, Hurrall has become reck-

lessly eager to attack and kill the  rst thing he sees.

Raid (EL 8+): Windscythes often join with other brutal

chaotic creatures, particularly those that leave them free to

conduct aerial attacks.

EL 8: A group of two windscythes and two trolls is based

in a shrine to Erythnul, carefully hidden beneath the sewers

of a major city. The raiders, bent only on slaughter, rampage

through half a dozen households before the adventurers are

alerted to their presence.

Slaughter (EL 10+): Happy to accompany those devoted

to the god of slaughter, windscythes are a fast strike force.

EL 10: Four windscythes and two trolls, led by a 5th-level

bugbear cleric of Erythnul, fall upon an unsuspecting vil-

lage, leaving devastation in their wake. The ruined village

becomes a haven for disease, and neighboring communities

are deeply troubled by the attack.

ECOLOGY

Windblades  regard  the  entirety  of  Pandemonium  as  their

domain and aggressively pursue intruderseverything from

the Banished (humanoids, goblinoids, and giants who have

been trapped in Pandemonium for ages) to the occasional

slaadi or  ends that attempt to carve out some of Pandemo-

niums territory for themselves.

Environment:  The  tunnels  and  caverns  where  wind-

blades dwell are grim, lightless places, through which the

winds of Pandemonium constantly howl. Here and there,

though, the winds erode enough of the surrounding stone

to create cul-de-sacs, and there the windblades make their

homes.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Windrazors  range

in height from 3 feet to 3 feet 10 inches, weighing 38 to 52

pounds. Though both genders possess the hornlike protru-

sions common to the race, male windrazors have four while

females have only two.

Windscythes range in height from 10 to 12 feet, weighing

from 550 to 800 pounds. Their tails add another 10 to 12 feet

to their overall length. Both genders possess the hornlike

protrusions common to the race, running the length of their

skulls. The more such horns, the older the windscythe.

Alignment: Windblades are always chaotic evil,  nding

SOCIETY

Windblades believe that they were the original manifesta-

11  Windblades are natives of the Windswept Depths

of Pandemonium. This result reveals all outsider

traits.

16  Windrazors are weaker windblades. Windscythes

are much larger and more powerful. All windblades

were created by Erythnul, god of slaughter, and

usually accompany other servants of their foul

patron.

21  Windrazors hunt in groups, employing flyby tactics

to confuse and overwhelm their opponents.

Windscythes slash with their bladelike tails during

such attacks, attempting to scatter groups of foes.

Erythnuls servants, they  nd every excuse possible to shed

mortal blood and cause death and mayhem.

In windblade society, windscythes are the lords and mas-

ters. Windrazors are treated as something between servants

and pets. They care for the young of the windscythes, guard

the  communal  lairs,  and  patrol  the  tunnels  and  caverns

of  Pandemonium  against  intruders  and  possible  invaders.

Windrazors  are  always  second-class  citizens,  afforded  few

rights and considered of minor importance compared to their

larger cousins. They allow this system to continue, despite

their  superior  numbers,  because  they  fear  the  power  and

spellcasting abilities of the windscythe clerics.

Windblades have their own language, called Windsong.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Windblades  have  standard  treasure  for  their  Challenge

Rating (about 600 gp for windrazors, and 1,200 gp for wind-

scythes). They never carry scrolls or oils, which are dif cult

to use in the windy conditions of Pandemonium.

Windblades with class levels have treasure appropriate to

NPCs of their Challenge Rating.

The windrazors are fearsome, yet not the most fearsome

of their kind. Their nobles are larger beasts still, with tails

like scythes.

Margin note in On Summoning

WINDBLADES AS CHARACTERS

Windrazor  leaders  tend  to  be  rangers  or  rogues.  Windra-

zor clerics are virtually unheard-of; windscythes jealously

reserve for themselves the right to commune with the gods.

Similarly, very few windrazors are wizards, though windra-

zor sorcerers are relatively common.

Windscythe leaders tend to be  ghters or clerics. Some

are  wizards,  but  these  are  exceedingly  rare;  the  winds  of

Pandemonium make the required study nearly impossible.

More  windscythes  become  sorcerers,  but  that  class  is  far

more common among the windrazors.

Speak with Plants (Su) As the speak with plants spell; at will;

caster level 4th.

Improved Woodland Stride (Ex) A wizened elder can move

through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns,

briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal

speed and without taking damage or suffering any other

impairment. In addition, thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that have been magically manipulated do not

impede its motion or otherwise affect it.

Entangle (Su) As the entangle spell; at will; DC 15; caster

level 4th. This ability affects a 60-foot-radius area around

the wizened elder and lasts for 1 minute. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

A wizened elder is a stunted, ancient-looking plant creature

related to treants but inhabiting forbidding lands at the very

edge of the tree line. Although not evil, wizened elders are

bitter, cruel creatures that blend perfectly with their harsh

environment.  They  creep  across  the  desolate  landscape,

watching for and driving off intruders.

Strategies and Tactics

Wizened  elders  patrol  singly  or  in  small  groups  (copses).

They  have  excellent  camou age,  being  virtually  indistin-

guishable from other stunted trees and shrubs, even to the

point of having one side mossier than the rest, just like a real,

ancient tree. They prefer to wait, standing still and observing

the situation, then catch enemies off guard.

If a foe does not appear too dangerous, a wizened elder uses

its entangle ability to ensnare it, then  ails at the immobilized

enemy with its limbs. Even if the foe is not held, its reduced

speed means it cant easily outrun the slow plant creature.

Obviously, such tactics dont work against enemies with

ranged attacks. The elders thick bark protects it from most

arrow  damage,  though,  and  slings  are  almost  ineffective

against it. When necessary, it simply retreats. If confronted

by enemies wielding  re, a wizened elder immobilizes them

if possible, then seeks others to overwhelm the threat.

Copses  of  wizened  elders  work  together  to  defeat  more

powerful  enemies.  They  use  intelligent  tactics,  granting

 anking  bonuses  and  assisting  one  another  with  attacks

or defense as the situation merits. They attack one enemy

at a time, starting with those who use slashing weapons or

anyone wielding  re. If outmatched, they retreat, leaving the

enemy stuck in the impeding terrain, and hide among other

shrubs once they are out of the enemys sight.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Wizened  elders  are  not  especially  cooperative  and  rarely

initiate combat. A solitary specimen is the most common

encounter, but groups do gather.

Pair (EL 4): Two wizened elders keep watch over a warm

spring that  ows year-round despite the arctic cold. Travel-

ers often stop here, making it an ideal spot for an ambush.

The elders use entangle to slow their foes. They gang up on

a single opponent, attempting to grapple it, drag it into the

water, and drown it.

ECOLOGY

Wizened elders are found at high elevations or at the edge

of tundra, where trees grow small and bonsailike at the very

edge of habitability. They live a very long time but never get

larger  than  shrubs.  Immature  specimens  are  rarely  seen,

since they are virtually indistinguishable from the ground

cover and berry bushes of their surroundings. This puts them

in danger from browsing herbivores, but they remain alert

to possible threats by listening to the nearby plants. They

can drive off most animals easilyits not often that a bit of

greenery slaps back! The mature plants also protect any area

that harbors younglings, for not many exist.

After a century or so, a wizened elder is able to live inde-

pendently and  nds its own patch of licheny rock or bogland

to inhabit. At this age, it is capable of reproducing. However,

so few exist that  nding a mate is a pro-

tracted and often unsuccessful quest. Both

sexes seek potential mates by querying

the local plant life. Should two elders

meet and  nd each other compatible,

they form a lifelong relationship. Re-

production is a complex process,  lled

with ritual. The result is a single seed,

which the parents plant nearby. The

offspring roots there as it grows (un-

less forced to move by a threat) and

remains in the area for the

next century or two.

A  wizened  elder

roots  itself  shallowly

in  its  chosen  spot  and

feeds as a plant does, ex-

tracting water and what nutrients

it  can  from  the  thin,  sour  soil.

Decomposing   esh  provides  ad-

ditional  nutrients,  so  a  wizened

elder is not above slaying an incau-

tious creature to supplement its diet.

Intruders corpses always go to feed

the soil.

The elders themselves are not ap-

petizing  to  plant-eaters,  although  in  a

harsh  winter  even  such  bitter  browse

might  attract  animals.  The  plants  are

quite capable of driving off ordinary beasts,

but savage monsters sometimes devour them.

They are especially vulnerable to brantas (Frostburn

113), which are adapted to such tough fare.

other races, although they are more likely to be

communicative with druids. Uldras (Frost-

burn 38) share their environment, and

wizened elders consider these arctic

fey to be kindred spirits (though the

gentle uldras might not agree).

In general, religion isnt im-

portant  in  their  lives.  Those

who  are  spiritually  inclined

usually follow druidic or shamanis-

tic paths, though a few might offer

prayers  to  grim  winter  deities.

Wizened elder druids are more

adventuresome  than  most  of

their  kin  and  are  the  most

likely  to  form  partnerships

with uldras or other druids.

Life is hard. Life is cold. These

basic tenets of wizened elders ex-

istence  in uence  their  outlook

and  values  system.  They  have  no

patience with any (including their

own  kind)  who  cannot  survive  a

harsh  environment.  Their  scions

quickly learn to defend themselves

Each wizened elder is a nation unto

itself. Central government is unknown to

these grim folk, and it isnt necessary when

they are so few and widely scattered. Within a copse,

authority naturally goes to the eldest. Wizened elders

who become druids often assume leadership roles; they

are usually the oldest as well.

Environment: Wizened elders are most often found in

cold plains, but the chilly subalpine zones of mountains also

host them. They move slowly about their region and occa-

sionally drift into other kinds of terrain, although they do

not remain there long.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A wizened elder rare-

ly exceeds a dwarf in height, usually standing 4 to 5 feet tall

and weighing around 150 pounds.

Males and females are about the same size, and both pro-

duce growths resembling pine cones every other year. The

male cones have broadly  aring  ns and grow at joints just

below the creatures face; female cones are quite small and

ring the elders trunk. The two have differing patterns of leaf

growth as well, with males sprouting clumps mostly along

their backs while females leaves are distributed more evenly

about their bodies. Leaves are tough and waxy, and they stay

green year round.

Alignment: Wizened elders are usually chaotic neutral,

an  attitude  born  of  solitary  watching.  Those  who  become

druids are more likely to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral

evil. Particularly bitter individuals drift toward neutral evil

or even chaotic evil behavior, especially in extreme old age.

SOCIETY

Wizened elders consider themselves the last, lonely defenders

against the creep of civilization into their wastes. They consider

treants to be distant and overly soft cousins who abandoned them

to inhospitable lands. They are indifferent to hostile toward most

Wizened elders have standard treasure for their Challenge

WIZENED ELDERS IN FAERN

Wizened elders inhabit cold, forbidding wastes, such as Narfell

and Icewind Dale, or sometimes the high slopes of mountain

ranges. Occasionally a Harper travels to speak to these lonely

sentinels about the activities of evil beings in their lands. Some

Uthgardt barbarians share the same region and pay respect to

the ancient treefolk. A small offshoot of the Grandfather Tree

tribe is dedicated to protecting the elders.

Wrackspawns exist because the evil of demons knows no

bounds. The remnants of good souls captured and tortured

in the Abyss, wrackspawns live to in ict pain upon others.

Fear and pain made them what they are, and these are what

they wish to bring to all forms of life.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Wrackspawns  charge  into  combat  heedless  of  any  danger

to themselves. They  use no strategy  beyond  attacking the

nearest living being. Wrackspawns typically ignore undead

and constructs unless attacked by them, and even then they

swiftly turn toward foes who can feel pain. The only excep-

tions are their own kind and demons. Wrackspawns innately

fear demons and  endish creatures, and they shy away from

them in combat.

Wrackspawns wield ugly shortspears created from their

own broken bones. They rarely throw these treasured objects,

preferring to use them in melee. Faced with no alternative,

a wrackspawn might throw its spear at an opponent its sure

it can kill.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Wrackspawns do not parlay or accept surrender. They exist

only to make others feel pain, and they relentlessly pursue

that goal. Fiends use wrackspawns as fodder, bullying the

creatures into combat before them. Those employing wrack-

spawns typically bring four or more along with them, having

emptied their Abyssal torture chambers of victims. Mortals

sometimes gain control of wrackspawns through the use of

summoning spells or as gifts from a  end.

Pack (EL 10): A vrock named Azrath discovered an open

gate  to  the  Material  Plane  while  transporting  four  wrack-

spawns to the service of a marilith. The gate closed behind

Azrath  as  it  went  through,  and  now  the  vrock  roams  the

countryside  looking  for  the  being  who  opened  the  portal

in hopes of controlling that power. Azrath follows its pack

of wrackspawns from the air as they chase and attack any

creature larger than a hare. Occasionally the vrock herds the

wrackspawns toward some target they cannot yet see. When

confronting  foes  worthy  of  its  trouble,  Azrath  allows  the

wrackspawns to attack for a few rounds while casting mirror

image and heroism on itself. Then Azrath uses its stunning

screech on foes from the air before landing to attack with

spores and melee attacks.

ECOLOGY

Wrackspawns  contribute  nothing  to  an  ecology  beyond

destruction. Although they do not eat, they maim and kill

at will. Typically, they ignore Tiny or smaller creatures in

favor  of  larger  prey,  but  with  nothing  else  to  attack,  they

even resort to smashing insects. Wrackspawns never attack

demons or each other, and they care little for creatures that

cant feel pain, such as undead and constructs. If they are

allowed to roam unchecked through an area, their depreda-

tions can lead to the loss of large predators and herbivores.

Environment:  Wrackspawns  are  native  to  the  In nite

Layers of the Abyss. As demonic footsoldiers, they are most

often found in the torture chambers where they come into

being or massing in armies on the Plain of In nite Portals.

Sometimes small groups serve demon lords as guardians or

for use in blood sport (such as hunting condemned souls).

Typical Physical Characteristics: A wrackspawn is the

twisted wreckage of a humanoid being, although it is barely

recognizable  as  such.  The  skin  has  been  burned  and  torn

from its body, and the exposed muscles are blackened. Its

joints  are  bent  in  unnatural  directions,  limbs  sometimes

truncated or split. The ravaged face no longer has eyes, and

few distinguishing features remain.

Most wrackspawns stand about 5 feet tall and weigh 250

pounds.

SOCIETY

Wrackspawns  come  into

being when demons torture

captive  good  souls  in  the

Abyss. The process of trans-

formation  takes  longer  for

some  than  others,  but  most

good  souls  endure  several

years  of  mistreatment  at

the  hands  of  their  captors

before  succumbing  to  their

ministrations and becoming

wrackspawns.

After  creation,  wrack-

spawns  continue  their  own

suffering by pulling broken

bones  from  their  bodies

to  craft  into  jagged  short-

spears. These awful weapons

channel  the  wrackspawns

pain and rage, allowing them

to  inflict  that  pain  upon

others.  A  wrackspawn  that

loses its bone shortspear does

everything  it  can  to  retrieve

it.  If  a  wrackspawn  cannot

regain  its  weapon,  it  cannot

imbue  its  attacks  with  pain

or make a new weapon. Bone

shortspears  separated  from

wrackspawns have no special

qualities.

Other  demons  have  little  concern  for  the  fate  of  these

creatures. In most cases, they are accidental results of tor-

ture. When a good soul is transformed into a wrackspawn, it

becomes a creature of pure evil, and demons  nd torturing it

far less entertaining. Even so, wrackspawns are more useful

in combat than dretches, and demons sometimes use them

as expendable troops.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Wrackspawns possess nothing other than their bone weap-

ons  and  piecemeal  scraps  of  armor  looted  from  infernal

battle elds.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A wrackspawn can be summoned using summon monster IV

or a higher-level summon monster spell. Treat the wrackspawn

as if it were on the 4th-level list on the Summon Monster

table (PH 287).

WRACKSPAWNS IN EBERRON

The  nightmarish  origin  of  wrackspawns  suggests  that

they  are  products  of  Xoriat.  If  this  is  so,  they

are  most  likely  the  remnants  of  beings  who

crossed  between  the  pla-

nar  boundaries  when  last

the Realm of Madness was

coterminous with Eberron

thousands of years ago. An-

other possibility is that the

daelkyr created these twist-

ed beings from humanoids,

much like they did the dol-

gaunts  and  the  dolgrims.

Their  burnt  and  flayed

appearance  is  a  physical

manifestation of the mental

anguish a normal creature

experiences when plunged

into  the  mind-shattering

environment of Xoriat.

Whatever  the  truth  of

the  wrackspawns  origin,

they are unmistakably alien

to the Material Plane now.

Most  are  in  the  service  of

demonic  armies  that   ght

plains  of  Shavarath.  Do

would  be  welcome  after

such  an  existence.  Or  do

they  reconstitute  on  the

battle eld, perhaps as even

more wretched minions?

Mortals who refuse to accept the gods existence (the Faith-

of  the  Dead.  The  Faithless  are  transformed  into  a  living

wall around his City of Judgment, and over time their indi-

vidual  consciousness  breaks  down  until  nothing  of  their

souls remains. Occasionally, a demon prince opens a portal

to the Fugue Plane and sends through raiding  ends that

rend the wall and release some of those trapped within, car-

rying them back to the Abyss. There the maddened souls

endure cruel torment that makes the doom of the wall seem

a kindness until, through pain, they are transformed into

wrackspawns.

YUAN-TI

As  detailed  in  the Monster  Manual,   the  deadly  yuan-ti  are

masters of intrigue and deception, constantly plotting and

scheming for power. To the yuan-ti, open warfare is a waste

of resources. A dagger in the back, a vial of poison slipped

into  a  drink,  an  insurrection  fomented  among  trusted

retainersthese  are  the  weapons  of  choice.  Con dent  in

their effectiveness, the yuan-ti employ these methods against

their own kind and against other races.

This section presents three sample yuan-ti agents. The pure-

blood slayer is a spy and assassin who ventures into human

society. The halfblood deceiver performs a similar role among

the savage humanoids. Where the slayer targets powerful war-

riors, politicians, and spellcasters, the deceiver seizes control

of a tribe and turns it into an unwitting weapon of the yuan-ti.

The abomination cult leader is an example of a powerful yuan-

ti who stands at the center of a vast network of underlings,

conspiracies, and shadowy plans. It manipulates events to suit

its needs, sets its enemies against each other, and uses its skill

at diplomacy to win allies and to isolate enemies.

Yuan-ti  racial  traits  are  summarized  on  page  263  of  the

The  humanoid  figure  before  you  is  clad  in  form-fitting  black

clothing. The glint of chainmail can be seen from beneath a fold

in her shirt. She appears human, but for a moment her eyes take

on a snakelike appearance. Without a sound, she draws a rapier

and leaps to attack.

A pureblood slayer is a highly trained assassin charged with

venturing into human lands in disguise, identifying power-

ful  gures and potential threats to yuan-ti plans, and either

slaying them or subverting them with bribes, promises of

power, and other temptations.

The  pureblood  slayer  presented  here  had  the  following

ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice abil-

ity score increases: Str 12, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 10,

Cha 8.

Strategies and Tactics

A pureblood slayer always enters a  ght with a clear plan and

well-considered preparations. Unless she has surprise or can

ambush her foes, she chooses discretion as the better part of

valor. The typical slayer is well aware that she cannot stand

toe-to-toe with a heavily armored paladin, a raging barbarian,

or a skilled  ghter. Only when she strikes with surprise can

she defeat her enemies.

The slayer uses her Disguise skill to draw close to an oppo-

nent and observe him for a time. Once she has watched him

long enough to use her death attack ability, she hides, casts

invisibility, poisons her rapier, and moves in for the kill. If

possible,  she  begins  her  preparation  while  watching  her

quarry. By using Spring Attack, she can slash at her opponent

and move away before he can react.

The exact approach that a slayer uses depends on where she

plans to make her attack. She prefers public places with large

This is a yuan-ti, an evil snakelike being. This result

reveals all monstrous humanoid traits.

Yuan-ti have deadly poisonous bites, and some can

also burn enemies with acid.

Some yuan-ti can disguise themselves to infiltrate

humanoid societies and sow discord.

Yuan-ti consider themselves to be favored by their

evil deity and wish to advance their own status.

crowds  and  background  noise,  such  as  a  tavern  or  inn.  The

slayer adopts the guise of a traveler or adventurer, observes her

target as he eats or drinks, and then strikes at him from the

anonymity of the crowd of patrons. This tactic allows her to

use a variety of disguises and keep her opponents off balance.

In the wilds, the slayer relies on her alternate form ability

to draw close to her victims. She hides in the grass, watches

her foe, and strikes at him while still in snake form. This

tactic is also useful against a victims mount or allies. A well-

placed bite can kill a horse, leaving the victim stranded in

the middle of nowhere and giving the slayer plenty of time

to plot her next move.

When  the  slayer  is  forced  into  a  confrontation,  such  as

when defending a yuan-ti lair, she relies on Spring Attack

to  defeat  opponents.  She  poisons  several  arrows  and  uses

ranged attacks to soften up resistance before darting in to

attack. If possible, she uses invisibility to stand in the open

and observe a foe.

its options.

Produce Acid (Sp) A halfblood deceiver has the ability to

psionically exude acid from its body, dealing 3d6 points

of acid damage to the next creature it touches, including

a creature hit by its bite attack. If the halfblood deceiver

is grappling or pinning a foe when it uses this power, its

grasp deals 5d6 points of acid damage. The acid becomes

inert when it leaves the halfblood deceivers body, and

the halfblood deceiver is immune to its effects.

Chameleon Power (Sp) A halfblood can psionically change

the color of his equipment and skin, granting it a +10

circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

A halfblood deceiver in ltrates orc, goblin, and ogre tribes

while in disguise, assassinates the current chieftain or helps

a puppet rise to power, and then manipulates the humanoids

to serve his ends. In this manner, the yuan-ti turns potential

enemies  into  useful  allies.  A  sudden  orc  attack  or  similar

calamity could very well be the work of a halfblood further-

ing some unguessable yuan-ti machination.

The halfblood deceiver presented here had the following

ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice abil-

ity  score  increases:  Str  10,  Dex  13,  Con  14,  Int  12,  Wis  8,

Cha 15.

Strategies and Tactics

A halfblood deceiver relies on trickery. His combat training

and wild rage make him a skilled warrior, but underneath

that berserker faade lurks a cunning, calculating mind. A

deceiver rages only when doing so is a surprise tactic or when

necessary for its survival. The deceiver wields the tribe he

leads or in uences like a rapier, carefully guiding it against

the yuan-tis enemies. The deceiver slips from tribe to tribe,

using each of them in turn and abandoning them when they

no longer serve his purposes.

A deceivers campaigns of terror are wide in scope and dif-

 cult to detect. In the fall, he leads his orc tribe to raid and

burn a kingdoms crops, cutting into the food supply. When

the orcs are  nally run down and slain, the deceiver escapes.

Over the winter, he in ltrates a goblin tribe in the moun-

tains.  When  spring  comes,  the  deceiver  leads  the  goblins

on raids against granaries and other storage centers. These

attacks might appear unrelated but combine to put immense,

continual pressure on the regions food supply. Burnt crops,

raided caravans, and destroyed stores all add up to famine,

even during years with excellent weather.

Deceivers seize power through careful manipulation and

intelligent  planning.  Their  overwhelming  personalities

and potent intellects allow them to easily outmaneuver the

simple goblin and orc chieftains they encounter. Usually,

a  deceiver  helps  a  subchief  attain  power  and  then  rules

through that proxy. While a deceiver invariably draws some

suspicion, he can de ect the simple-minded orcs and goblins

by  leading  them  on  successful  raids.  Few  evil  humanoids

question  a  leader  who  brings  them  gold,  slaves,  food,  and

strong drink.

When confronted in battle, a deceiver weighs the risks of

exposing himself against the reward of victory. A deceiver

never feels loyalty to the tribe he leads. After all, he need

only  adopt  a  new  disguise  and   nd  a  new  tribe  to  begin

manipulating anew. The deceivers long-term, strategic view

of situations leads him to cut and run rather than  ght, unless

he feels the odds are absolutely in his favor.

Auras (Ex) Affects all allies within 60 feet who can hear

an abomination cult leader, have Int 3 or higher, and

understand the abomination. The abominations aura is

dismissed if it is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed,

or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by its

allies. Miniatures Handbook 13.

The abomination can project one of the following

minor auras and can switch auras as a swift action.

Master of Tactics: +7 bonus on damage rolls when flanking.

Motivate Dexterity: +7 bonus on Dexterity-based checks,

including initiative checks.

The abomination projects the following major aura in

addition to whichever minor aura it chooses to use.

Motivate Attack: +1 bonus on melee attack rolls.

Constrict (Ex) An abomination cult leader deals 1d6+7 points

of damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, an abomination cult

leader must hit an opponent of up to Large size with a

bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins

the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Aversion (Sp) As the antipathy spell; at will; caster level 16th.

This is a psionic compulsion effect targeting one creature

within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Will

save or gain an aversion to snakes and yuan-ti for 10

minutes. Affected creatures must stay at least 20 feet

away from any snakes or yuan-ti, alive or dead; if already

within 20 feet, they move away. A subject unable to move

away, or one attacked by a snake or yuan-ti, is overcome

with revulsion. This revulsion reduces the creatures

Dexterity score by 4 points until the effect wears off or the

subject is no longer within 20 feet of a snake or yuan-ti.

Grant Move Action (Ex) As a standard action, grant an extra

move action to all allies (but not self) within 30 feet.

Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action

immediately. Miniatures Handbook 13.

Produce Acid (Sp) As the halfblood deceiver.

Chameleon Power (Sp) As the halfblood deceiver.

Skills A yuan-ti abomination has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check,

even if rushed or threatened. It also has a +8 racial bonus

on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid

a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

An abomination cult leader is a commander and mastermind

among the yuan-ti. It leads a small cell of purebloods and half-

bloods, and a variety of orcs, ogres, and other brutish creatures

who serve as mercenaries, slaves, and allies. The cult leaders

magnetic personality allows it to transform even the most

fumbling rookie into a con dent, hard- ghting warrior.

The cult leader presented here had the following ability

scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 13, Dex 8, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 15.

Strategies and Tactics

An abomination cult leader is at its best when surrounded

by a number of underlings. Its marshal class levels grant it

enormous leadership abilities. Even puny goblins or kobolds

are dangerous when commanded by a cult leader.

Usually,  a  cult  leader  acquires  followers  from  among

the survivors of tribes and clans subverted by a halfblood

deceiver. As intended, the tribe causes enough trouble for

civilized lands that a local ruler raises an army to defeat it. At

that point, the deceiver leads the survivors to the cult leader

that commands him. These survivors become virtual slaves,

forced to choose between serving the yuan-ti and trying to

survive in the wilds.

With  orc,  ogre,  goblin,  and  gnoll  servants  gathered  in

this manner, the abomination cult leader is a daunting foe.

Followers quickly learn that servitude has its rewards as the

abomination  leads  them  to  victory  in  battle  and  rewards

them with treasure. The yuan-ti weeds out malcontents and

incompetents, then executes them.

The  cult  leader  keeps  its  motivate  dexterity  aura  active

most of the time. When battle begins, it and its allies gain

a signi cant bonus on initiative. Once battle is joined, the

abomination  switches  to  its  master  of  tactics  aura.  It  then

grants a move action to allies to get them into  anking posi-

tions. At that point, they cut through the enemy.

While the battle rages, the abomination keeps its allies be-

tween it and its enemies. It uses its reach to lash out with its

I

falchion. Baleful polymorph and suggestion allow it to handle

foes that are too strong for its allies. When faced with large

numbers of opponents, it relies on its fear ability.

An  abomination  cult  leader  seeks  power,  wealth,  and

strength.  It  deals  openly  with  other  evil  creatures.  Even

the mightiest necromancer or evil priest cannot resist the

abominations  honeyed  words,  well-considered  plans,  and

thoughtful counsel. With both Intelligence and Charisma

over 20, the abomination is smart enough to create intri-

cate, effective plans and in uential enough to win allies

to help see them through.

Yuan-ti pureblood slayer,

abomination cult leader, and

halfblood deceiver

Cult

leaders

command both

halfblood deceiv-

ers and pureblood

slayers, setting them

both to advance its subtle aims

and plans. Even the yuan-ti under its

command have little idea of the

true scope of their masters goals.

ECOLOGY

Yuan-ti  build  elaborate  cit-

ies,  erecting  temples  to

their  evil  pantheon  and

snatching  slaves  and

sacri ces  from  the  sur-

rounding inhabitants.

Yuan-ti  consider

themselves favored and

devote  considerable  at-

tention to breeding ever

more  perfect  speci-

mens.  Affection  has

nothing  to  do  with

the  process.  After

mating, females lay

their eggs in brood

chambers and then abandon the clutch to the care of ser-

vants  called  broodguards.  Young  receive  training  almost

from hatching and mature quickly.

Environment:  Yuan-ti  are  most  comfortable  in  warm

forests, usually steaming jungles. Sometimes they inhabit

subterranean passages, even right beneath human cities.

Typical Physical Characteris-

tics: Purebloods closely resemble

humans and have similar builds.

Halfbloods have a variety of ser-

pentine  features,  such  as  snake

heads or tails. They are otherwise

about the size of humans. Abomi-

nations are entirely snakelike; they

can reach 12 feet in length and weigh

up to 300 pounds.

Alignment:  Interested  only  in  ad-

vancing  their  own  status  within  their

cruel  society,  yuan-ti  are  usually  cha-

otic evil.

SOCIETY

Yuan-ti society revolves around status, with

the bigger and more powerful abominations

at  the  top  of  the  heap.  Individual  yuan-ti

continually  strive  to  increase  their  status,

even at the expense of their fellows.

Yuan-ti  worship  a   endish

entity  called  Merrshaulk,  a

great,  serpentine  demigod.

They believe themselves to be

the deitys favored children

and see other creatures

as   t  only  for  exploi-

tation  and  slaughter.

All yuan-ti are coldly

intelligent,  but  the

abominations  rule

through  both  brains

and  physical  intimi-

dation.  The  lesser

yuan-ti  dare  not

disobey  their  ter-

rifying leaders.

TYPICAL

TREASURE

Yuan-ti  have  double  stan-

dard treasure for NPCs of their

Challenge Rating. They gather wealth for

themselves  and  especially  seek  magic

items to give them an edge.

YUAN-TI IGNAN

The creature before you resembles a giant serpent with a human-

oid  upper  body.  Long,  sharp  horns  crown  its  head,  and  its  tail

splits  about  two-thirds  of  the  way  along  its  length,  ending  in

sharp hooks. It carries a heavy mace in one hand and a small

shield in the other. The colors of its scales shift from dull brown

to dark red, and a slight heat haze surrounds it.

Constrict (Ex) A yuan-ti ignan deals automatic tail slap

damage (including fire damage) with a successful grapple

check. It also deals this damage when it successfully uses

improved grab with its tail slap attack.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a yuan-ti ignan must

hit an opponent of up to Large size with a tail slap attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Tail Grapple (Ex) A yuan-ti ignans long, powerful tail allows

it to coil around a foe without hampering its ability to

defend itself or to fight with the weapons it wields. If

the ignan grapples a foe using its improved grab ability,

it does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC. It can make

a single grapple check against the foe grappled in this

manner as a swift action each round. The ignan is free

to perform most other actions as normal; if it wants to

move, it must obey the standard rules for moving while in

a grapple.

The yuan-ti ignan loses the option to spend its swift action

in this manner if it uses a standard or full action to

grapple the foe trapped in its tail. The reverse is also

true. Once the yuan-ti ignan uses its swift action in this

manner, it cannot take a standard or full action to grapple

the foe already trapped in its tail.

A yuan-ti ignan can use armed or natural attacks against a

creature grappled in this manner.

Ignans are the product of yuan-ti experimentation designed

to create a creature resembling an abomination with elemen-

tal qualities, in this case  re. Some part of yuan-ti ignans

bloodline  includes  salamanders,  but  they  are  still  mostly

serpent.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Yuan-ti  ignans  are   ercely  aggressive  creatures,  more

inclined to charge into melee combat than to lay traps or

spring ambushes. They are simple, brutish  ghters. When

the yuan-ti must repel invaders, or when they prefer a blatant

display of pure force, they deploy the ignans.

Working alone, a yuan-ti ignan seeks to pin down enemy

spellcasters  by  grappling  them  with  its  tail,  then  uses  its

heavy mace to deal with other opponents in melee combat.

Because yuan-ti ignans are so cruel, though, they often save

the last strike in a full attack to deliver a quick mace blow to

a grappled opponent.

When  working  in  groups  (usually  two  to  four),  yuan-ti

ignans are actually less effective. Their bloodlust overrides

their  puny  common  sense.  When  one  ignan  successfully

grapples  an  opponent,  the  others  virtually  ignore  any

remaining enemies and instead attempt to seize control of

the grappled creature in a ghastly tug-of-war. (The highest

grapple check wins; if the grappled opponent has the high-

est result, it takes advantage of the confusion to pull free.)

Once the grappled creature is dead or beyond their reach,

the others turn their full attention back to the remaining

foes. Without the commanding presence of a smarter yuan-

ti, ignans do not use battle tactics.

This creature is a yuan-ti ignan, the result of bizarre

yuan-ti breeding experiments with elementals. This

result reveals all monstrous humanoid traits and

the fire subtype.

Yuan-ti ignans are aggressive fighters, their

bloodlust fueling their fiery nature. Their skin is

searing hot to the touch, and they are immune to

fire attacks.

The yuan-ti ignans forked, barbed tail allows it to

grab and crush an opponent with a single attack.

A yuan-ti ignan attacks by trapping its enemies

within its coils. Even when the ignan has a victim

grappled, it still fights and dodges its enemies

without any hindrance.

With  their  great  strength  and  physical  toughness,  ignans

are better at surviving the chaos of battle or a surprise raid

than their superiors.

Individual (EL 7): A lone yuan-ti ignan seeks to begin

an encounter as close to its opponents as possible. This lone

brute patrols the jungle around a yuan-ti stronghold. It slips

from one copse of trees to another. Rather than travel

a steady circuit through an area, it waits

at one sentry point for a time before

moving to the next spot.

Bodyguard (EL 9): A yuan-ti

abomination keeps a single ig-

nan as a personal bodyguard.

In  battle,  the  abomination

waits for its ignan servant to

ignans  are  not  trusted

by the majority of yuan-

ti,  and  are  considered

highly expendable. Their

unpredictable  cruelty  makes  them  a

danger  to  the  tribe,  and  when  not  suf ciently

occupied, they commit acts of wanton destruc-

tion  out  of  sheer  boredom.  Stories  persist  of  yuan-ti

fortresses overrun and now controlled by renegade ignans.

Thus, the yuan-ti take care to keep beasts and slaves on hand

when they must breed enough ignans to form a  ghting

force. These creatures form a ready supply of sport to keep

the ignans occupied.

As a result of this risk of insurrection, yuan-ti leaders fre-

quently manufacture reasons for ignan gangs to undertake

lengthy missions outside the enclave. Wise yuan-ti gather

their ignans on the eve of battle, rarely sooner.

Sometimes,  a  yuan-ti  ignan  that  breaks  away  from  its

masters forms its own tribe. These creatures sometimes see

value in forcing others to obey their will, especially if doing

so nets them more captives. Weaker humanoid creatures,

especially  goblins  and  kobolds,  are  prime  candidates  for

servitude.

enclave is easily identi ed by the scorched appearance of

the surroundings. When the rest of the tribe lairs under-

ground (say, in the ruins of an old temple), yuan-ti ignans

generally occupy the deepest parts of the enclave, where

their intense body heat actually serves the tribe by keeping

the tunnels warm.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A yuan-ti ignan is

10 to 14 feet long and weighs 250 to 400 pounds.

Females are usually darker than males,

tending  toward  grays  and  browns

rather than reds.

YUGOLOTH

Greedy, malicious, and beholden to no standard of honor,

yugolths are  ends native to the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna.

They  happily  offer  their  services  to  the  highest  bidder,

serving  demons  and  devils  alike  in  the  eternal  clashes  of

the Lower Planes. They enjoy nothing more than causing

suffering.

The glossary lists racial traits common to all yugoloths.

CORRUPTOR OF FATE

A corpulent creature with sickly yellow skin wears black studded

leather armor. It is armed with a short sword and shortbow. As

Strategies and Tactics

Corruptors of fate work alone or sometimes with a group of

undead or a construct or two. They rarely team up with other

corruptors of fate.

When encountered, corruptors are usually in mercenary

service.  Their  assignments  emphasize  assassination,  but

occasionally theyre used to guard a valuable asset, especially

if the owner expects a threat.

Corruptors of fate take their assignments

very  seriously,  but  also  have  a  strong

instinct  for  self-preservation.  If  a  cor-

ruptor is clearly outmatched, it retreats

with  the  intent  to  return  shortly  with

reinforcements.

Sample Encounters

Unlike  many  yugoloths,  corruptors  of

fate dont have the innate ability to use

plane shift. Transportation is usually ar-

ranged by a corruptors patron or by

a summoning or calling spell.

Individual  (EL  5):  A  lone

corruptor  of  fate  might  be  en-

countered under a wide variety of

circumstances.

EL  5:  A  corruptor  of  fate  named

Misfortune  is  on  an  assassination

mission. Her target is the may-

or of a small town. Why the

mayor? Misfortune doesnt

know. She suspects the as-

signment is part of a much

larger  and  convoluted  plot

conceived  by  her  patron,  a

mind  ayer.

Guard  Duty  (EL  68):  A

corruptor of fate is often accom-

panied by undead or constructs.

It prefers the company of intel-

ligent undead such as wraiths or

even  shadows,  but  can  be  found

with skeletons and zombies.

EL 7: Malefactor, a corruptor of fate, and

two shadows guard a half- ends abode.

Corruptor of fate

Planar Ally (EL 510): A planar ally spell can call one cor-

ruptor of fate with up to 5 class levels. A greater planar ally spell

can call two corruptors of fate with up to 2 class levels each.

EL 10: Malfeasance (male corruptor of fate assassin 5) has

been  called  to  the  Material  Plane  by  a  powerful  cleric  to

eliminate the threat of a pesky enemypossibly the PCs.

Raiding Party (EL 812): A corruptor of fate might lead a

company of other yugoloths, undead, or constructs on a mis-

sion to retrieve an item, kidnap a person, or kill a target.

EL 9: Twisted Fate, a corruptor of fate, and three canoloth

yugoloths  (MM  III  200)  make  a  strategic  strike  against  a

small village to get a holy relic from the local church. Their

patron  is  a  powerful  nycaloth  commander  (MM  III  202)

named General Commander Render, who gives orders with-

out  explanations.

Gatekeepers  (EL  1214):  Guarding  an  important  site,

such as a planar gate, is the province of a skilled corruptor

of fate assassin, usually accompanied by one or more allies.

EL 12: Calamity (female corruptor of fate assassin 5) and a

stone golem guard a gate that leads to Gehenna in an aban-

doned monastery on the Material Plane.

Mercenary Troopers (EL 1218): As mercenary yugo-

loths, corruptors of fate might be hired by demons, devils,

or more powerful yugoloths.

EL  14:  Two  yugoloth  commanders  dispute

the deadliness of the devourer compared to the

dread  wraith.  They  each  wager  their  patron-

age of a thriving corruptor of fate crche. To

settle  the  bet,  they  have  formed  a  team

of a devourer and a dread wraith to

travel  together  on  a  killing  spree

on  the  Material  Plane.  They  have

added  a  corruptor  of  fate  5th-

level  assassin  named  Malice  to

keep  track  of  which  undead

made the killing blow against

a creature. Each commander

believes  that  Malice  will  act

to  further  her  patrons  inter-

est. Malice has taken bribes

from  both  and  doesnt  care

which undead triumphs. In

fact, she intends to announce

a tie upon her return, no mat-

ter what the result.

EL  16:  Soulbinder,  an  11th-

level  male  human  wizard  lich,

is  quite  cunning.  He  resides  in

a  sunken  lair,  like  an  invert-

ed  tower,  under  the  sewers

of a great metropolis. To pro-

tect him, he has an iron golem

crafted  by  his  late  mentor  and

Malign, a corruptor of fate assas-

sin 5, as his guards.

Ecology

Corruptors of fate are outsiders with

no need to sleep, eat, or breathe. Their

apparent fatness is their natural form and

entirely unconnected with food intake. From

birth, a corruptor has the basic body proportions of

an adult.

Once a year for about a week, each adult corruptor of fate

feels the urge to return to Gehenna and mate. This is the

only time a corruptor of fate willingly seeks the company

of another of its kind. A young corruptor reaches maturity

at about ten years of age.

The mother has no maternal feelings toward a newborn

corruptor. She deposits it in a crche (a shared nursery) in

Gehenna to be raised by constructs or undead slaves, which

are immune to the necromantic abilities of the infant cor-

ruptors.

Environment: Corruptors of fate are native to the Bleak

Eternity of Gehenna. Like other yugoloths, theyre planar

mercenaries that go wherever their employers send them.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  corruptor  of  fate

stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Its body

191

resembles that of a very chubby humanoid. In contrast, its

face looks emaciated, with thin yellow skin stretched tightly

across its skull. Its eyes glow with a lurid light.

Male and female corruptors of fate look very similar. Both

have bosomlike rolls of fat on their chests, so most perceive

them as female (DC 20 Spot check to correctly determine a

corruptors gender).

The smell of brimstone is typical of all corruptors of fate,

a by-product of their biology. It is generally noticeable only

when a corruptor attacks. Skills checks to track a corruptor

of fate using scent receive a +2 bonus.

A  corruptor  of  fate  is  accompanied  by  a  faint  sound  of

rolling  dice,  a  supernatural  illusion  telepathically  heard

by anyone in combat with the corruptor. It is an automatic

response and cannot be stopped.

Alignment:  Corruptors  of  fate,  like  all  yugoloths,  are

always neutral evil.

Society

Life for a corruptor of fate is generally one violent assignment

after another. From birth, a corruptor learns to look to its own

survival, even before the demands of a mercenary role.

Growing up is dif cult. Older corruptors of fate torment

weaker or younger creatures. A powerful yugoloth, usually

of commander level or higher, sponsors each crche. Often

the stewardship of the crche changes hands according to

political  machinations  and  upheavals  in  yugoloth  society,

which affect the growing young as well.

The constructs or undead that raise the children are far

from nurturing or maternal. They are entrusted only with

providing the most basic needs, little more than keeping the

young  safe  from  external  threats.  Guardians  occasionally

intervene if their young charges are liable to kill each other

during sibling con icts.

The safest course of action for a young corruptor is to avoid

notice. This environment creates an ideal training ground

for potential assassins: They learn the merits of stealth and

disguise, and they hone their desire to kill. They come to

despise all creatures, especially other corruptors of fate, and

feel most at home with undead and constructs.

Once  it  reaches  maturity,  a  corruptor  of  fate  leaves  the

crche to begin its mercenary career. The crches current

patron gives a corruptor its  rst assignment (usually to kill

one  of  the  patrons  rivals).  If  the  newcomer  is  successful,

the  young  adults  skills  are  considered  suf cient  to  enter

the  assassin  prestige  class.  If  unsuccessfula  result  that

usually means deaththe patron sends a team with a more

experienced corruptor to  nish the job.

A yugoloth patron uses corruptors of fate for both lethal

assignments and devastating warnings to rivals or disobedi-

ent underlings. These warnings usually involve near-lethal

attacks that leave the target cursed. Through regular, chal-

lenging assignments, a patron endeavors to keep a corruptor

busy and content.

A corruptor of fate might occasionally decide to disobey its

patrons orders. Corruptors arent apt to seize power themselves,

though, being happiest in service. One that goes rogue seeks

a different patron, such as a  end or a mind  ayer. Corruptors

prefer evil masters but arent picky; some even  nd their way

into the service of an immoral ruler on the Material Plane.

Typical Treasure

Corruptors of fate without class levels have standard treasure

for their Challenge Rating, about 1,600 gp. They invest in

their  equipment,  demonstrating  a  keen  sense  of  self-pres-

ervation. Most of their items are durable armor or weapons

with perhaps one or two potions or other consumable items.

Assassins carry two to  ve vials of their favorite poison.

For Player Characters

A corruptor of fate can be called using a planar ally spell. It

can also be summoned by summon monster VI or a higher-

level summon monster spell. Treat the corruptor of fate as if

it were on the 6th-level list on the Summon Monster table

(PH 287).

Corruptors of Fate with Class Levels

Corruptors favored class is rogue, and many take levels of the

assassin prestige class. The rare corruptor of fate that chooses

to become a cleric owes allegiance to no deity but to its racial

philosophy of bringing ill luck and death to others. Corrup-

tor clerics choose from the Death, Evil, and Luck domains.

Spell Resistance: A corruptor of fate has spell resistance

equal to 14 + 1 per class level.

Level Adjustment: +4.

Corruptors of Fate in Eberron

Corruptors  of  fate  are  active  participants  as  mercenaries

in the con icts on Shavarath, the Battleground. Although

they are inhabitants of Mabar, their crches are located on

Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead. They are considered native

to both planes.

Corruptors of Fate in Faern

Corruptors of fate inhabit the Barrens of Doom and Despair.

Theyre often found on raids into Hammergrim because of

the many portals that link the two planes, and they sometimes

make their way through portals to the Material Plane.

Corruptor of fate clerics in Faern choose from the Fate,

Hatred, and Luck domains.

Strategies and Tactics

Voors  work  best  as  guardians,  patiently  waiting  for  foes

to approach. Their blindsense often locates creatures long

before they themselves are spotted. If possible, they climb

onto a wall or other high spot, allowing them to attack with

their tentacles at range.

A single voor might be content to pick off targets one by

one but is just as likely to rush into the middle of a group,

targeting a weak-looking foe with its claws while using its

tentacles to keep others at bay. In groups, voors descend upon

their prey en masse, spreading out to threaten overlapping

spaces.

Because of their capacity as guardians, voors have a keen

sense of determining intent and are dif cult to trick with

orders  that  are  counter  to  their  original  commands.  Still,

they arent quite bright enough to look beyond the letter of

their instructions, so they take commands literally.

Sample Encounters

Voors are most likely encountered guarding a  endish shrine

or  other  important  site.  Occasionally,  one  or  two  might

be assigned bodyguard duty for a priest or other  gure of

authority.

Society

Voors serve as guardians, bodyguards, and enforcers for more

powerful  ends. They are tough and dangerous but rather

dim-witted. They readily take orders from stronger  ends

without question. Voors are incredibly patient; one might be

content to sit and guard an area without moving for weeks on

end, all the while awaiting the opportunity to wreak havoc

and destruction. Voors can obey only relatively simple com-

mands, such as guard this area or let only humans that say

Orcus pass. Anything more complex is lost on them.

Although more subservient than most  ends, voors still

delight  in  bullying  lesser  creatures,  perhaps  as  a  way  to

express their bloodlust. Unless given speci c orders to the

contrary, they attack and destroy any lesser  end that dares to

venture into an area they have been charged with protecting.

They then place the carcasses about as a warning to others.

Individual (EL 4): A sole voor protects an evil temple, a

Typical Treasure

Voors  have  standard  treasure  for  their  Challenge  Rating,

about 1,200 gp for a basic version. Since the creatures are

unconcerned with acquiring wealth, this treasure represents

the scattered gear of those unfortunate enough to have fallen

prey to a voor ambush.

For Player Characters

A typical voor can be called using a lesser planar ally spell.

(More  powerful  voors  might  require  planar  ally  or  greater

it were on the 4th-level list on the Summon Monster table

cache of magic items, or a portal to another realm.

Bodyguards (EL 7): Two voors have been charged with

guarding a priest of the Elder Elemental Eye (see page 7).

The priest (NE human cleric 5)  ghts until reduced to half

hit points, then attempts to surrenderat which point the

voors immediately attack him for his treachery.

Ecology

Voors relish the taste of  esh and especially blood. Their

impact on a region is a rampage of slaughter and cruelty.

Voors periodically spawn broods. After  ve years, a juve-

nile voor reaches its mature form and is ready for duty. It

remains near the voor that spawned it, observing the best

techniques for guarding a location and capturing prey.

Environment: Voors hail from the Bleak Eternity

of  Gehenna,  speci cally  the  smoldering  layer  of

Khalas. Their proximity to the Nine Hells means

that they are typically employed by devils, though

others also summon them.

Voors prefer underground locations or those with

lots of high terrain, such as walls or rock outcroppings,

that allow them to climb and better ambush foes. Areas

of  ame and magma remind them of home, so they are

also attracted to such  locations.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Voors  are

humanoid  in  shape,  but  the  resemblance  ends

there. A voor stands 9 feet tall and weighs about

800  pounds.  Its  body  is  heavily  armored  and

covered in tiny maws that the voor uses to rend

opponents and drink their blood. The face of a

voor is an eyeless dome of chitin and bone, ending

in a terrible mouth  lled with sharp teeth.

The massive arms of a voor end in sharp talons.

Each  arm  has  tentacles  that  extend  and  retract  in  a

 ash. Voors do not use these tentacles to grapple, but instead

spear creatures with the sharp ends. Additional tentacles

extend  from  a  voors  shoulders,  which  it  uses  to  hold  an

opponent or occasionally to transport a charge.

Alignment: Voors are capricious and cruel, loyal only to

those whom they serve. They are always neutral evil.

Adaptive Defenses (Ex) A zerns ever-changing

physiology allows it to shrug off effects that attack

its endurance or disrupt its bodily functions. It

is immune to all spells and effects that require a

Fortitude save unless the effect also works on

objects or is harmless. A zern can choose to allow

an effect that requires a Fortitude save to affect it.

Warping Energy (Su) A zern can produce energy

that rends and tears at its opponents

flesh. As a standard action, a zern can

use this ability to make a melee or

ranged attack that deals 1d6 points

of damage per 2 HD plus the zerns

Intelligence modifier. The ranged

version of this attack can reach

to 120 feet and has no range

increment.

Malleable Form (Ex) A zern can

rapidly alter its metabolism,

internal structures, organs, and

other bodily systems to cope with a

variety of environments and situations.

As a swift action, a zern can gain one

of the following benefits. Each benefit

has an unlimited duration. Generally,

a zern remains in one form, and

then slips into another one as the

situation dictates. When a zern

uses a swift action to gain

one of these forms, it loses the benefits of the form it

previously held.

Adrenal Surge: The zerns upper-body muscles bulge and

grow with enhanced power. It gains a +2 bonus on

attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls, including

those using its warping energy ability.

Boneless Form: The zerns body seems to melt into a

puddle of goo as its bones liquefy. It gains a +8 bonus

on Escape Artist checks, which increases to +16 on

checks made to squeeze through a tight area.

Impervious Hide: The zerns skin shifts into plates of

armor. It gains a +4 bonus to AC and DR 5/piercing.

Size Shift: The zern can shift to Large or Small size. A

Large zern gains a +2 bonus to Strength, and its

space and reach increase to 10 feet; one that shifts to

Small takes a 2 Strength penalty. The zern gains the

standard size bonuses or penalties on attacks, Hide

checks, and so forth.

Speed Burst: The zerns legs lengthen and its lower body

muscles bulge and grow. Its base speed increases by

30 feet.

Shifting Guise (Su) As the alter self spell; at will; caster level

8th. A zern can choose to shift into a different monstrous

humanoid form or any humanoid form.

Transmutation Affinity (Ex) The save DCs of any

transmutation spells or spell-like abilities used by a zern

increase by 4.

Zerns are hideous, malevolent creatures who see other living

beings as mere playthings. They warp and shift other crea-

tures into new forms in an attempt to improve them. A zern

can magically alter its form

to disguise its true nature.

Zern

STRATEGIES

AND TACTICS

Zerns use their body-altering

abilities  to  adapt  to  specif-

ic  combat  situations.  A  zern

usually activates its impervious

hide form to protect against unex-

pected attacks or ambushes. Once

engaged, it uses size shift to reach

or corner opponents. If the zern

has the upper hand, it uses adrenal

surge to hasten its victory. It saves

speed burst to escape if the oppo-

sition is tougher than expected.

A  zerns  shifting  guise ability

allows  it  to  adopt  a  multitude  of

forms, especially when setting up

an ambush. A zern might even pose as

one of its targets. In this guise, it can ob-

serve its opponents and strike when

the time is right.

A  zern  holds  back  on  using

its  spell-like  abilities  until  it

learns how its enemies  ght,

preferably  before  they

close  to  melee  range.

It prefers to use baleful

polymorph  to  neutral-

and  reduce  person  to  hamper  warriors  and  other  primary

physical threats. Otherwise, it merely blasts away with its

warping energy.

Zerns  rely  on  their  blade  thralls,  creatures  forged  in

their hideous workshops, to do much of their  ghting. A

zern  prefers  to  blast  its  enemies  from  behind  a  squad  of

blade  thralls  and  other  servant  creatures  such  as  gibber-

ing mouthers, otyughs, and gricks. Sometimes zerns hire

grimlock mercenaries.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Zerns  are  most  likely  to  be  encountered  during  a  slaving

raid. They prefer to travel in groups, although individuals are

occasionally sent out to scout an area before an assault.

Individual (EL 6): A lone zern targets a single creature

to capture and enslave. It adopts a disguise and seeks out a

tavern, inn, or other place where travelers gather, and it tries

to poison its targets food with oil of taggit (DMG 297). Once

the poison takes hold, the zern claims that the victim had a

few drinks too many and offers to carry him up to his room.

From there, it spirits the victim away.

ECOLOGY

The vast majority of zerns live in small enclaves hidden in

the dark corners of the world. They prefer to dig hideouts

within deep forests, in a citys sewer systems, and even within

relatively peaceful corners of the underground realm. Zerns

prey on all creatures, including humans, wild animals, and

even drow and giants. A zern enclave must be far enough

from potential victims to remain safe, but close enough to

plan and execute raids easily.

All  zerns  begin  life  as  male.  At  around  age  forty,  they

undergo a process that turns them female. Once a zern has

given birth to a child (gestation takes a full year), it reverts to

a sterile neutral gender, although parents are still responsible

for the care and education of their young.

Environment: Zerns keep on the move, although they

prefer wetter climates to drier ones. They set up temporary

camps, keeping prisoners in corrals, and move on once they

reach their quota.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Zerns are tall, lanky

humanoids,  standing  around  6  feet  tall  and  weighing  170

pounds. A zerns frame belies its incredible toughness and

ability to shrug off wounds. Its skin covers ropy muscles that

shift and twist in unsettling ways when it moves. Instead

of hair, zerns have several delicate tentacles that also serve

as olfactory organs. Like star sh, zerns can slowly regrow

severed digits and limbs.

Alignment: Zerns see themselves as the only true sentient

creatures in the cosmos. They experiment on other beings

in the same way that a child plays with toys. Supremely self-

centered, zerns are usually neutral evil.

SOCIETY

Zern  society  is  predicated  on  the  concept  that  only  the

zerns are truly sentient. To them,  all other  living things

are  mere  playthings  for  experimentation.  A  zern  sees

itself  as  the  pinnacle  of  biological  development.  Other

creaturesthose too primitive to control their bodies and

alter their forms to suit their needsare obviously evolu-

tionary dead ends.

Zerns  seek  to  discover  the  perfect  biological  form  by

altering creatures to produce new races. By discovering this

 nal form, they believe they can  nally achieve true tran-

scendence and bodily perfection. Unfortunately for other

creatures, zerns experiment only on the strongest, smartest,

and most successful subjects. They also believe in practicing

their art as often as possible, learning from the process of

trial and error.

Zerns sculpt creatures into twisted, deformed beings that

usually die on the operating table. Sometimes they use mystic

processes to turn a subject into one of a variety of horrors,

including arcanovores (see page 197), blade thralls (see page

198),  chokers,  ettercaps,  gibbering  mouthers,  gricks,  and

otyughs. Such monsters are normally found guarding zerns

lairs or helping them capture test subjects.

Although zerns consider all other creatures to be inferior

beings, they sometimes sell their bizarre creations as living

weapons. A zern community in need of money to hire mer-

cenaries or buy a fresh crop of slaves might trade a gibbering

mouther, a few blade thralls, or even an arcanovore to a drow

outpost, a temple of the Elder Elemental Eye, or a gang of

demons.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Zerns  have  standard  treasure  for  their  Challenge  Rating,

about 2,000 gp. They covet items of transmutation magic,

especially wands and wondrous items.

ZERNS WITH CLASS LEVELS

Zerns favored class is transmuter, in keeping with their apti-

tude for transmutation magic. Levels of transmuter do not

increase the DCs of zerns spell-like abilities. Zern clerics

(which  are  rare)  worship  Nerull.  They  see  the  deity  as  a

herald who will one day wipe all imperfect life, other than

zerns, from the world.

Once  in  combat,  a  zern  arcanovore  uses  its  dispel  magic

ability against the opponent with the largest number of exist-

ing magical auras. If a spellcaster is causing dif culties, the

arcanovore moves close and activates its antimagic  eld.

Sample Encounters

Whether in the company of their original creators or other

evil  masters,  zern  arcanovores  prefer  not  to  enter  a   ght

alone. They are most commonly found with mind  ayers,

rakshasas, evil outsiders, and evil priests.

Slaving Party (EL 10): Xalxanorix, a mind  ayer slaver,

has set out to gather thralls and perhaps acquire a few items

of magical power to increase its in uence in its home city.

Accompanied by two loyal troll thralls and a zern arcanov-

ore, the mind  ayer could be encountered by adventurers

traveling  overland  or  through  the  underground.  One  of

Xalxanorixs favorite tactics is to quietly gain control of a

small human community with its mental powers. The mind

 ayer considers such simple folk uninteresting, but once the

community is dominated, it has the villagers call for help,

bringing it a steady stream of adventurers. The mind  ayer

ambushes the adventurers (preferably one by one), takes their

magic equipment, and perhaps adds them to its collection of

guards if they have signi cant abilities.

Demonic Gang (EL 13): A gang of demons led by Ballhan-

aroth, a hezrou, has gone to ground underneath a temple of

Hextor. The demons were part of a host that was broken by

a group of powerful heroes and a gold wyrm. Ballhanaroth

leads two vrocks and one zern arcanovore, and he is willing

to  aid  the  temple  in  return  for  shelter  from  the  pursuing

ZERN EXPERIMENTS

Zerns  (see  page  195)  crafted  other  living  creatures  into

bizarre forms. Some of these monstrous experiments survive

the process and serve their creators as guards. Zerns also sell

their creations to other, inferior beings.

ZERN ARCANOVORE

ations, are anathema to magic of all kinds. They can

Strategies and Tactics

Zern arcanovores rely on the protection and direction

of more powerful creatures. The zerns sell arcanovores

to  mind   ayers,  demons,  devils,  and  other  evil  mas-

ters.  Created  and  bred  by  the  zerns  to  serve  loyally,

the arcanovores ful ll support roles in whatever plans

and encounters their masters concoct. Arcanovores are

far from bright, but they perform their speci c role in

combat ably, targeting and removing the magical protec-

tions  of  their  foes  in  order  to  make  the  attacks  of  their

allies more effective.

powerful adventurers that has been thwarting the temples

plans of late.

Typical Treasure

Zern arcanovores rarely have any treasure, although a wealthy

owner might equip one with a protective magic item.

Ecology

The majority of arcanovores make their permanent homes

with zerns. These creatures are sold to a variety of planar

beings but serve best when used to thwart mortal spellcast-

ers aligned against their masters. Very rarely, a demon- or

devil-purchased arcanovore accompanies its master to other

planes of existence.

Zern arcanovores feed off the dissipating magical energy

of effects they dispel and those suppressed by their antimagic

 elds.

Environment: Arcanovores existence is dictated by those

who purchase them from the zerns. Most  nd a place within

underground lairs, but a few are kept in aboveground sites,

particularly temples dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye

(see page 7).

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  zern  arcanovore

stands between 3 and 4 feet in height and typically weighs

between 80 and 100 pounds. Arcanovores cannot speak, but

they understand Common and follow instructions from their

owners.

An arcanovores talons resemble those of a bird of prey but

possess  prominent  opposable  claws  for  grasping  and   ne

manipulation.

Alignment: Zern arcanovores are always lawful evil and

loyally  follow  their  masters,  however  cruel  or  irresolute.

Like other evil creatures, they revel in cruelty and take every

opportunity to cause pain and fear in those they see as weaker

than themselves.

Society

Zern arcanovores are social creatures, preferring the com-

pany of their owners or creators to solitary existence.

Because  of  their  usefulness  against  powerful  magical

effects, arcanovores are usually treated well and protected

by their masters. Other minions, even some more powerful

than the arcanovores, have strict orders regarding the care

and preservation of these creations.

Adaptive Defenses (Ex) A zern blade thralls resilient

physiology allows it to shrug off effects that attack its

endurance or disrupt its bodily functions. It is immune

to all spells and effects that require a Fortitude save

unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless.

A blade thrall can choose to allow an effect that requires a

Fortitude save to affect it.

Like  arcanovores,  blade  thralls  are  products  of  the  zerns

insidious  biological  experiments.  They  serve  as  warriors,

sentinels, and bodyguards. Their great strength, toughness,

and skill in combat makes them fearsome enemies, while

their poor intelligence and weak personalities make them

ideally suited as expendable troops. A blade thrall obeys its

zern masters with suicidal fanaticism.

Strategies and Tactics

A zern blade thrall  ghts to protect its masters and obeys

their every command. Typically, a blade thrall uses its bulk

to shield a zern. While the zern blasts its enemies with its

warping  energy,  the  blade  thrall  fends  off  attackers  and

provides cover.

A  blade  thrall  employs  simple  tactics  without  a  zern

to  guide  it.  It  charges  toward  the  nearest  opponent  and

 ghts until the foe is dead. It then switches to a different

opponent, and so on, until it dies or its opponents are all

defeated.

Zerns  see  blade  thralls  as  disposable  resources.  A  zern

always  puts  its  safety  above  a  thralls  well-being,  and  the

thralls are bred to willingly accept even suicidal orders from

their masters. For example, a thrall might barrel through a

rank of enemy  ghters, accepting attacks of opportunity, to

attack an enemy spellcaster or archer.

Although blade thralls are skilled combatants capable of

dealing  great  damage,  most  zerns  see  them  as  little  more

than mobile shields. Usually, a thrall makes a few attacks

at the start of a battle. If its attacks are ineffective, the zern

commands it to focus on defense, especially when facing a

foe that the thrall cannot possibly overcome. In this case, the

thralls sole task is to protect the zern. It  ghts defensively

or even takes the total defense action to hold out as long as

possible. A blade thrall might also use the aid another action,

usually to improve the zerns AC.

Blade thralls also serve zerns by capturing living creatures.

They  are  trained  to  wield  nets  and  use  them  to  entangle

and neutralize promising test subjects. Once a creature is

trapped and subdued, the blade thralls drag it back to the

zerns lair.

Sometimes the zerns sell blade thralls to other races. The

thralls obey their new masters as faithfully as they would

zerns.

Sample Encounter

Blade thralls travel with zerns to protect them from harm

and provide physical labor.

Collecting Party (EL 8): A zern and two blade thralls

travel through a dungeon level in search of fresh victims.

The  zern  disguises  itself  as  a  dwarf  cornered  and  trapped

in a net by the two thralls, who make a show of attacking

it. Once the adventurers leap to help the dwarf, the thralls

attack with their nets. The disguised zern watches the battle,

gladly sacri cing the thralls to learn more about its potential

subjects. If the adventurers clearly outclass the blade thralls,

the  zern  waits  for  them  to   nish  off  the  creatures  while

mentally  noting  their  talents,  abilities,  and  tactics.  After

the battle is over, it thanks them for their help and leaves to

fetch reinforcements. If it thinks it can defeat the survivors,

it shifts form and attacks.

Ecology

Zern blade thralls exist wherever zerns settle. They are ser-

vants and slaves, and their dim intellects keep them from

being more independent. A blade thrall left to its own devices

becomes little more than a wild animal.

Blade thralls have no gender and cannot reproduce. They

can  only  be  shaped  by  zerns  from  other  living  creatures.

Being  unaffected  by  diseases,  poisons,  and  other  physical

ailments, blade thralls are theoretically immortal, though

most die in combat after a few years of service.

Environment: Blade thralls have no preferred environ-

ment. They go wherever the zerns command them.

SAMPLE LAIR:

THE DEEPHOLLOWS

The slow drip of water gradually hollowed out this series of

caverns, which are suitable for habitation by subterranean

creatures.

1. Antechamber

Water seeped through a surface crack to begin forming this

series of caves. The original opening to the surface has since

been sealed with a stone plug, and the ground above shows

no obvious entrance (Search DC 25 to locate). A tunnel con-

nects it to other underground areas.

The  oor slopes down gradually at  rst, then steeply. Civi-

lized creatures inhabiting this area might carve rough steps

into the slick stone.

2. Dead End

This series of steep-walled caverns is connected by extremely

narrow  passages,  some  barely  wide  enough  to  admit  a

Medium  creature.  The  passages  eventually  end  in  a  blind

alley  in  which  a  little  stale  water  has  collected.  Civilized

peoples consign their common criminals (as well as those

too poor to pay rent) to this waste area, where mere survival

is a brutal, constant  ght. Uncivilized beings exile the dis-

eased,  cursed,  or  malformed,  and  those  shunned  through

superstition.

The cavern walls are rough, with many ledges and shelves

that afford a bit of surface for sleeping or pitching a small

shelter. Individuals with the highest status inhabit the lower

caves, closer to the meager supply of water. The lower areas

are also less traveled and allow a bit of privacy. Fights over

this territory are frequent.

3. The Bridge

A 5-foot-wide natural bridge spans this cave. It is slick with

dampness, meaning that 2 squares of movement are needed

to enter each square, and running and charging are prohib-

ited. Civilized creatures might install railings, which allows

movement at normal speed as long as a character holds on.

(Running and charging are still not allowed.)

A  hole  worn  in  the  caverns  bottom  opens  into  a  lower

space into which civilized residents dump waste (giving this

area a noisome stench). Guards might be posted at the far end

of the bridge.

4. The Funnel

Ancient eddies swirled about the rock here, resulting in a

series of spiraling ledges that serve as footpaths. They are

narrow and treacherous (DC 7 Balance check to avoid slip-

ping) but allow passage to the wider tunnel at the bottom.

Civilized creatures might construct a lift system for faster

and safer transport.

5. Main Dwellings

This high-ceilinged cave is about 150 feet across at its widest

point, big enough to contain a good-sized encampment or

several  dozen  buildings.  The   oor  slopes  down  gradually,

with  a  10-foot-wide  tunnel  opening  from  a  side  wall  into

area 6. A very large opening leads into area 7. At the lowest

point of the cavern is an opening into yet lower caves (area

8). A stone slab and a mound of rubble cover the opening.

If inhabited by civilized creatures, this cave might contain

multistory buildings or cliff dwellings carved into the walls,

as well as arti cial light sources. Barbaric inhabitants simply

camp on the  oor.

A wide ledge midway up the far wall forms an entrance to

a dead-end network of narrow tunnels. Civilized creatures

might use this area for storage or military barracks.

Near the caverns ceiling is a narrow opening into twisting

hollows that connect with area 4 as well as opening to the

surface, thus allowing air to  ow through the complex.

6. Secondary Dwellings

A second large cave, about 60 feet across at the widest, serves

as  additional  living  space.  If  the  inhabitants  are  civilized,

this area is home to the wealthy and in uential members of

society. Smaller spaces branching off the main cave might

form private estates within this privileged district.

Uncivilized  inhabitants  might  instead  use  this  area  for

noncombatant housing, child-rearing, and the like.

7. Downbelow

These smaller caves connected by sinuous tunnels form less

desirable  living  space.  Brackish  water  pools  in  the  lowest

cave, drinkable in a pinch but not pleasant (especially since

trash and wastes tend to spill into it).

Civilized beings relegate their lowest classes to this area.

Laborers, foreigners, and transient renters dwell in hovels

here and travel into area 5 to work or trade. Barbaric creatures

throw garbage into this area or perhaps keep beasts or slaves

here.

8. The Deeps

Ancient water  ows opened the  oor of the large cavern into

a deep gap within the rock. Its nearly vertical sides make it

unsuitable  for  humanoid  dwellings.  However,   ying  and

climbing monsters sometimes hunt here, such as monstrous

vermin,  carrion  crawlers,  cloakers,  driders,  hook  horrors,

ropers, and other typical underground threats.

A few smaller openings, as well as tunnels dug by burrow-

ing creatures, open off the bottom of this area. A stagnant

pool is home to a variety of oozes. The network of tunnels

grows every year, and eventually a monster might burrow

into the inhabited caves.

9. Reservoir

A lake has formed at the bottom of this enormous cave fed by

an underground stream. The water is mineral rich but fresh,

and it supplies the dwellings above.

Civilized creatures install winches and cables to bring up

the water, or use a system of pipes and pumps. Less techno-

logically advanced beings use a bucket at the end of a rope.

Enormous  stalactites  hang  from  the  ceiling.  They  are

strong enough to support hanging structures, such as nests

or hammocks, or even industrial buildings.

MONSTER FEATS

Presented below are a number of feats that are typically used

by monsters. Some of them (such as Craft Construct) can also

be useful to NPCs and player characters.

ABILITY FOCUS

A particular special ability of a creature with this feat is more

potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Special ability that allows a saving throw.

Bene  t: Add 2 to the DC for all saving throws against the

special ability on which the creature focuses.

Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Its

effects do not stack. Each time the creature takes the feat, it

applies to a different special ability.

AWESOME BLOW

A creature with this feat can choose to deliver blows that send

its smaller opponents  ying like bowling pins.

Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush,

size Large or larger.

Bene  t: As a standard action, the creature can choose to

subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome

blow. If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than

itself with an awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a

Re ex save (DC equal to damage dealt) or be knocked  ying

10 feet in a direction of the attacking creatures choice and fall

prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent

in a straight line, and the opponent cant move closer to the

attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle

prevents the completion of the opponents move, the oppo-

nent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and

the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

Special: A  ghter can select Awesome Blow as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

CLINGING BREATH

This feat enables a creatures breath weapon to cling to crea-

tures and continue to affect them after it has breathed.

Prerequisites: Con 13, breath weapon with recharge time

expressed in rounds.

Bene  t: When a creature uses its breath weapon, it can

choose for it to deal additional damage in the next round

to  all  creatures  and  objects  affected  by  it.  This  additional

damage is equal to half the damage the breath weapon dealt to

that creature or object. A second save is not allowed, but any

creature or object that avoided all damage from the breath

weapon in the  rst round (such as from evasion) does not

take any extra damage.

As a full-round action, a targeted creature can attempt a

Re ex  save  (using  the  breath  weapons  original  save  DC)

to remove the clinging breath weapon and negate further

damage. Rolling around on the ground grants a +2 bonus on

this save.

This feat only works on a breath weapon that has instan-

taneous duration and that deals damage.

When  a  creature  uses  this  feat,  add  1  to  the  number  of

rounds it must wait before using its breath weapon again.

Special:  This  feat  originally  appeared  in Draconomicon;

this is a revised version. If you have Draconomicon, Clinging

Breath is treated as a Metabreath feat.

CRAFT CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]

A creature with this feat can create golems and other magic

automatons that obey its orders.

Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Won-

drous Item.

Bene  t: The creature can create any construct whose pre-

requisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes one day for

each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct, a

spellcaster must spend 1/25 the items price in XP and use

up raw materials costing half of this price.

The  creature  can  repair  constructs  that  have  taken

damage. In one day of work, the creature can repair up to 20

points of damage by expending 50 gp per point of damage

repaired.

A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit

Dice.

FLYBY ATTACK

A creature with this feat can attack on the wing.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Bene  t: When  ying, the creature can take a move action

(including a dive) and another standard action at any point

during the move. The creature cannot take a second move

action during a round when it makes a  yby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard

action either before or after its move.

GITHYANKI BATTLECASTER

A creature with this feat ignores arcane spell failure chances

when wearing light armor.

Prerequisites: Githyanki, ability to cast 2nd-level arcane

spells, base attack bonus +3.

Bene  t: The creature ignores arcane spell failure chances

for any kind of light armor it wears. If it wears medium or

heavy armor or carries a shield, it has the normal arcane spell

failure chance.

Special: A  ghter or wizard can choose this feat as one of

the bonus feats those classes grant.

GITHYANKI DRAGONRIDER [RACIAL]

A creature with this feat has a knack for getting along with

red dragons.

Prerequisites: Githyanki, ride 5 ranks.

Bene  t:  The  creature  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  Diplomacy

checks  when  dealing  with  red  dragons  and  a  +2  on  Ride

checks  it  attempts  when  riding  a  red  dragon.  While  the

creature is mounted on a red dragon, it and its mount gain

a +1 bonus on Re ex saves and a +1 insight bonus to Armor

Class.

Special: The Diplomacy bonus from this feat stacks with

the githyanki racial bonus on Diplomacy checks when deal-

ing with red dragons. A githyanki  ghter can choose this feat

as a bonus feat.

IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK

POWERFUL CHARGE

The natural attacks of a creature with this feat are more dan-

gerous than its size and type would otherwise dictate.

Prerequisite: Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.

Bene  t:  The  damage  for  one  of  the  creatures  natural

attack forms increases by one step, as if the creatures size

had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6,

3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. A weapon or attack that deals 1d10

points of damage increases as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8,

6d8, 8d8, 12d8.

IMPROVED TOUGHNESS

A  creature  with  this  feat  is  signi cantly  tougher  than

normal.

Prerequisite: Base Fortitude save bonus +2.

Bene  t: The creature gains a number of hit points equal

to its current Hit Dice. Each time it gains a Hit Die (such

as by gaining a level or advancing), it gains 1 additional hit

point. If it loses a Hit Die (such as by losing a level), it loses

1 hit point permanently.

Special: A  ghter can select Improved Toughness as one

of his  ghter bonus feats.

LINGERING BREATH

The breath weapon of a creature with this feat forms a lin-

gering cloud.

Prerequisites: Con 15, breath weapon with recharge time

expressed in rounds, Clinging Breath.

Bene  t:  When  the  creature  uses  its  breath  weapon,  it

can choose for the effect to remain for 1 round as a linger-

ing cloud of the same shape and size as the original breath

weapon.

Anyone who enters the cloud takes one-half of the breath

weapons normal effects; any saving throw the breath weapon

normally allows still applies. Damaging breath weapons deal

one-half  their  normal  damage,  and  breath  weapons  with

effects that have durations last for one-half the normal time.

If a creature is affected by the same nondamaging breath

weapon twice, the effects do not stack (use only the longer

duration).

Any  creature  in  the  area  of  the  original  breath  weapon

takes no additional effect from the cloud, provided it is out-

side the cloud by the end of its next turn.

When  a  creature  uses  this  feat,  add  2  to  the  number  of

rounds it must wait before using its breath weapon again.

Special:  This  feat  originally  appeared  in Draconomicon;

this is a revised version. If you have Draconomicon, Lingering

Breath is treated as a Metabreath feat.

MULTIATTACK

A  creature  with  this  feat  is  adept  at  using  all  its  natural

weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.

Bene  t:  The  creatures  secondary  attacks  with  natural

weapons take only a 2 penalty.

Normal:  Without  this  feat,  the  creatures  secondary

attacks with natural weapons take a 5 penalty.

A creature with this feat can charge with extra force.

Prerequisites: Medium or larger, base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t: When the creature charges, if its melee attack

hits, it deals an extra 1d8 points of damage (if it is of Medium

size). For Large creatures, the extra damage is 2d6 points; for

Huge, 3d6; for Gargantuan, 4d6; and for Colossal, 6d6.

This feat only works when the creature makes a charge. It

does not work when the creature is mounted. If the creature

has the ability to make multiple attacks after a charge, it can

only apply this extra damage to one of those attacks.

Special: A  ghter can select Powerful Charge as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY

A creature with this feat can employ a spell-like ability with

a moments thought.

Prerequisite:  Spell-like  ability  at  caster  level  10th  or

higher.

Bene  t: The creature can use one of its spell-like abilities

as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if

the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

Using a quickened spell-like ability is a swift action (see

page 219) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The

creature can perform another actionincluding the use of

another spell-like abilityin the same round that it uses a

quickened spell-like ability. The creature can use only one

quickened spell-like ability per round.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating

a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level

(round down) minus 4. For a summary, see the table below.

For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a

15th-level caster can only quicken spell-like abilities duplicat-

ing spells of 3rd level or lower. In addition, a spell-like ability

that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full

round cannot be quickened.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a

standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity unless

otherwise noted.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its

spell-like abilities.

GLOSSARY

This section of Monster Manual IV provides de nitions and

descriptions  of  monster  characteristics.  If  you  have  come

across a term used earlier in this book that youre not familiar

with, this is the place to  nd out more.

Aligned Strike: Attacks made by a creature that has this

ability are treated as aligned for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction. When it applies, aligned strike appears

in the Atk Options line of a creatures statistics block, fol-

lowed in parentheses by a speci c alignment (chaotic, evil,

good, or lawful).

Aberration Type: An aberration has a bizarre anatomy,

strange  abilities,  an  alien  mindset,  or  any  combination  of

the three.

Features: An aberration has the following features.

d8 Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good Will saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An aberration possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Pro cient with its natural weapons. If generally human-

oid  in  form,  pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any

weapon it is described as using.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Aberrations are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.

Ability  Score  Loss  (Su):  Some  attacks  reduce  the

opponents score in one or more abilities. This loss can be

temporary (ability damage) or permanent (ability drain).

Ability Damage: This attack damages an opponents ability

score. The creatures descriptive text gives the ability and the

amount of damage. If an attack that causes ability damage

scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated amount of

damage (if the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two

dice). Ability damage returns at the rate of 1 point per day

for each affected ability.

Ability  Drain:  This  effect  permanently  reduces  a  living

opponents ability score when the creature hits with a melee

attack. The creatures descriptive text gives the ability and

the amount drained. If an attack that causes ability drain

scores a critical hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if

the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two dice). Unless

otherwise speci ed in the creatures description, a draining

creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit)

whenever  it  drains  an  ability  score  no  matter  how  many

points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this fashion

last for up to 1 hour.

Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 draining creatures racial HD + draining creatures Cha

modi er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive

text). If no saving throw is mentioned, none is allowed.

Air Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals

and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of

Air. Air creatures always have  y speeds and usually have

perfect maneuverability (see Movement Modes, page 213).

Alignment: This line in a monster entry gives the align-

ment that the creature is most likely to have. Every entry

includes a quali er that indicates how broadly that alignment

applies to all monsters of that kind.

Always: The creature is born with the indicated alignment.

The creature might have a hereditary predisposition to the

alignment or come from a plane that predetermines it. It is

possible for individuals to change alignment, but such indi-

viduals are either unique or rare exceptions.

Usually: The majority (more than 50%) of these creatures

have the given alignment. This could be due to strong cul-

tural in uences, or it could be a legacy of the creatures

origin.  For  example,  most  elves  inherited  their  chaotic

good  alignment  from  their  creator,  the  deity  Corellon

Larethian.

Often:  The  creature  tends  toward  the  given  alignment,

either  by  nature  or  nurture,  but  not  strongly.  A  plurality

(4050%) of individuals have the given alignment, but excep-

tions are common.

Animal Type: An animal is a living, nonhuman creature,

usually  a  vertebrate  that  has  no  magical  abilities  and  no

innate capacity for language or culture.

Features:  An  animal  has  the  following  features  (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

d8 Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Good Fortitude and Re ex saves (certain animals have

different good saves).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits:  An  animal  possesses  the  following  traits  (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature that has an Intel-

ligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).

Low-light vision.

Alignment: Always neutral.

Treasure: None.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only. A noncomba-

tive herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary attack.

Such attacks are made with a 5 penalty on the creatures

attack rolls, and the animal receives only 1/2 its Strength

modi er as a damage adjustment.

Pro cient with no armor unless trained for war.

Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.

Aquatic Subtype: Creatures that has the aquatic subtype

always have swim speeds and thus can move in water without

making Swim checks. An aquatic creature can breathe under-

water. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious

special quality.

Archon Subtype: The plane of Celestia is home to a race

of good outsiders known as the archons.

Traits:  An  archon  possesses  the  following  traits  (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Aura  of  Menace  (Su):  A  righteous  aura  surrounds

archons that  ght or get angry. Any hostile creature within

a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to

resist its effects. The save DC varies with the kind of archon,

is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who

fail take a 2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours

or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the

aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot

be affected again by the same archons aura for 24 hours.

Immunity to electricity and petri cation.

 +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.

Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against

evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the

archons Hit Dice). (The defensive bene ts from the circle

are not included in an archons statistics block.)

Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will,

as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can

transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.

Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature

that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster

level 14th). This ability is always active.

Augmented Subtype: A creature receives this subtype

whenever something happens to change its original type.

Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born

with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an

acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired

with  the  creatures  original  type.  For  example,  a  wizards

raven  familiar  is  a  magical  beast  (augmented  animal).  A

creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits

of its current type, but the features of its original type. For

example, a wizards raven familiar has an animals features

and the traits of a magical beast.

Blindsense (Ex): Using nonvisual senses, such as acute

smell  or  hearing,  a  creature  that  has  blindsense  notices

things  it  cannot  see.  The  creature  usually  does  not  need

to make Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of

a creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided

that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the

creature cannot see still has total concealment against the

creature that has blindsense, and the creature still has the

normal miss chance when attacking foes that have conceal-

ment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with

blindsense. A creature that has blindsense is still denied its

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from crea-

tures it cannot see.

Blindsight  (Ex):  This  ability  is  similar  to  blindsense,

but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as

sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echo-

location, a creature that has blindsight maneuvers and  ghts

as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most

kinds  of  concealment  are  irrelevant,  though  the  creature

must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that

creature or object. The abilitys range is speci ed in the crea-

tures descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to

make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range

of its blindsight ability. Unless otherwise noted, blindsight

is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it.

Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a

free action. If so, this is noted in the creatures description.

If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature

gains the bene ts of blindsight only during its turn.

Breath  Weapon  (Su):  A  breath  weapon  attack  usually

deals  damage  and  is  often  based  on  some  type  of  energy

(such as  re). Such breath weapons allow a Re ex save for

half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creatures racial HD +

breathing creatures Con modi er; the exact DC is given in

the creatures descriptive text). A creature is immune to its

own  breath  weapon  unless  otherwise  noted.  Some  breath

weapons allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a

Re ex save.

Change Shape (Su): A creature that has this special qual-

ity can assume the appearance of a speci c creature or type

of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own

physical qualities. A creature cannot change shape to a form

more than one size category smaller or larger than its original

form. Changing shape results in the following changes to the

creature:

The creature retains the type and subtype of its original

form. It gains the size of its new form.

The  creature  loses  the  natural  weapons,  movement

modes, and extraordinary abilities and attacks of its original

form.

The  creature  gains  the  natural  weapons,  movement

modes,  and  extraordinary  abilities  and  attacks  of  its  new

form.

The creature retains all other attacks and special quali-

ties of its original form, except for breath weapons and gaze

attacks.

The  creature  retains  the  ability  scores  of  its  original

form.

The creature retains its hit points and saves.

The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its

original form, although it must be able to speak intelligibly to

cast spells with verbal components and it must have human-

like hands to cast spells with somatic components.

The creature is effectively camou aged as a creature of

its new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if it

uses this ability to create a disguise.

Chaotic  Subtype:  A  subtype  usually  applied  only  to

outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most

creatures  that  have  this  subtype  also  have  chaotic  align-

ments; however, if their alignments change they still retain

the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a

creature that has this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic

alignment,  no  matter  what  its  alignment  actually  is.  The

creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment.

A creature that has the chaotic subtype overcomes damage

reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields

were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).

Class Skills: Any skill in which a monster has acquired

at least one rank or in which the creature has a racial bonus

is  considered  a  class  skill  for  that  kind  of  creature.  Some

monsters, such as the true dragons, have their class skills

explicitly listed. Other monsters class skills can be deter-

mined from their statistics blocks.

Creatures  that  have  a  swim  speed  always  have  Swim  as

a class skill. Creatures that have a climb speed always have

Climb as a class skill. Skills listed in an entry merely because

of synergy with another skill are not class skills. For example,

a whisper demons class skills are Bluff, Concentration, Diplo-

macy, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Knowledge

(nobility),  Knowledge  (the  planes),  Listen,  Sense  Motive,

Spellcraft,  and  Spot.  It  has  other  skill  modi ers,  such  as

Disguise, Intimidate, and Survival, due to synergy bene ts

granted by other skills. The statistics block for the inferno

spider also includes a Jump modi er due to its speed, even

though Jump is not a class skill for the creature.

Cold Subtype: A creature that has the cold subtype has

immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to  re, which means

it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

 re, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the

save is a success or failure.

Constrict (Ex): A creature that has this ability can crush

an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making a

successful grapple check. The amount of damage is given in

the creatures entry. If the creature also has the improved

grab ability (see page 214), it deals constriction damage in

addition to damage dealt by the weapon used to grab.

Construct  Type:  A  construct  is  an  animated  object  or

arti cially constructed creature.

Features: A construct has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

No good saving throws.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the construct has an Intelligence score. However, most con-

structs are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: A construct possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

No Constitution score.

Low-light vision.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity  to  all  mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities

(charms,  compulsions,  phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale

effects).

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and necromancy effects.

Cannot  heal  damage  on  their  own,  but  often  can  be

repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see the

creatures description for details) or through the use of the

Craft Construct feat (see page 203). A construct that has the

fast healing special quality still bene ts from that quality.

Not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal

damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or

energy drain.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save

(unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).

Not  at  risk  of  death  from  massive  damage  (PH  145).

Immediately  destroyed  when  reduced  to  0  hit  points  or

less.

Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or

resurrected.

Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct

is hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based on size, as

shown on the following table.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only, unless gener-

ally humanoid in form, in which case pro cient with any

Pro cient with no armor.

Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.

Damage Reduction (Ex or Su): A creature that has this

special  quality  ignores  damage  from  most  weapons  and

natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon

bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows

the attack was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage

from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-

like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of

weapon  can  sometimes  damage  the  creature  normally,  as

noted below.

The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usu-

ally 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the

ability.  For  example,  the  werewolfs  entry  reads  damage

reduction 10/silver: Each time a foe hits a werewolf with

a weapon, the damage dealt by that attack is reduced by 10

points (to a minimum of 0). However, a silvered weapon deals

full damage.

Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or

slashing damage. For example, the wizened elder has damage

reduction  5/slashing.  When  it  is  hit  with  bludgeoning  or

piercing weapons, the damage dealt by each attack is reduced

by 5 points, but slashing weapons deal full damage.

Some  monsters  are  vulnerable  to  certain  materials,

such as alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron.

Attacks  from  weapons  that  are  not  made  of  the  correct

material  have  their  damage  reduced,  even  if  the  weapon

has an enhancement bonus. Examples: the dwarf ancestors

damage reduction 10/adamantine, the joystealers damage

reduction 5/cold iron, and the defacers damage reduction

10/silver.

Some  monsters  are  vulnerable  to  magic  weapons.  Any

weapon that has at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on

attack rolls and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduc-

tion of these monsters. Such creatures natural weapons (but

not their attacks with weapons) are treated as magic weapons

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (See Magic

G

L

O

S

A

R

207

Strike, page 213). For example, the balhannoth has damage

reduction 15/magic and can strike as a magic weapon for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or

lawful-aligned weapons. When a cleric casts  align weapon,

affected weapons might gain one or more of these proper-

ties, and certain magic weapons have these properties as well.

For example, many demons such as Lolth-touched bebelith

have  damage  reduction  10/good,  while  the  justice  archon

has damage reduction 10/evil. A creature that has an align-

ment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome

this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and

weapons it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had

an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of

the creature. A nashrou demon, for instance, has the chaotic

and evil subtypes, and thus can overcome damage reduction

as if its weapons and natural weapons were chaotic-aligned

and evil-aligned (see Aligned Strike, page 205).

When a damage reduction entry has a dash () after the

slash, no weapon overcomes the damage reduction.

A  few  creatures  are  harmed  by  more  than  one  kind  of

weapon.  The  kashtigur  demon,  for  example,  has  damage

reduction 5/cold iron or good. Either kind of weaponcold

iron or goodovercomes its damage reduction.

A few other creatures require combinations of different

types  of  attacks  to  overcome  their  damage  reduction.  For

example,  the  deathdrinker  demon  has  damage  reduction

15/good and lawful, meaning that a weapon must be good-

aligned and lawful-aligned in order to overcome the demons

damage reduction.

Darkvision (Ex): A creature that has this special ability

can see in the dark, out to the distance given in the creatures

entry. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like  normal  sight,  and  a  creature  that  has  darkvision  can

function just  ne with no light at all.

Dragon Type: A dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually

winged, that has magical or unusual abilities.

Features: A dragon has the following features.

12-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Fortitude, Re ex, and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (6 + Int modi er) per Hit Die, with

quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A dragon possesses the following traits (unless oth-

erwise noted in the description of a particular kind).

Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Immunity to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only unless human-

oid  in  form  (or  capable  of  assuming  humanoid  form),  in

which case pro cient with all simple weapons and any weap-

ons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with no armor.

Dragons eat, sleep, and breathe.

Dragonblood Subtype: A creature that has the dragon-

blood  subtype  has  a  strong  af nity  to  dragonswhich

means that spells, effects, powers, and abilities that affect or

target dragons also affect it. The subtype quali es a creature

to  use  magic  items  normally  only  usable  by  dragons,  and

quali es the creature to take feats that have the subtype as a

prerequisite. The dragonblood subtype also makes creatures

subject to harmful effects that affect dragons.

The dragonblood subtype does not confer the dragon type

or any traits associated with that type. For instance, it does

not give a creature frightful presence.

Dragons automatically qualify for any classes, prestige

classes,  racial  substitution  levels,  feats,  powers,  or  spells

that require the dragonblood subtype. Creatures presented

in  this  book  that  have  the  dragonblood  subtype  include

all  the  spawn  of  Tiamat  (see  pages  128163).  Should  a

creature acquire the dragon type, it loses the dragonblood

subtype.

Earth Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elemen-

tals and outsiders that have a connection to the Elemental

Plane of Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds,

and most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.

Effective  Character  Level  (ECL):  This  number  repre-

sents a creatures overall power relative to that of a character

from the Players Handbook. A creature that has an ECL of 10

is roughly equivalent to a 10th-level character. A creatures

ECL is the sum of its Hit Dice (including class levels) and

level adjustment. For instance, a blackspawn raider has 8 HD

and a +3 level adjustment. It is the equivalent of an 11th-level

character.

Elemental Type: An elemental is a being composed of

one of the four classical elements: air, earth,  re, or water.

Features: An elemental has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Good saves depend on the element: Fortitude (earth,

water) or Re ex (air,  re).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An elemental possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stun-

ning.

Not subject to extra damage from critical hits or  ank-

ing.

Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental does

not have a dual natureits soul and body form one unit.

When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that

restore souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate,

and resurrection, dont work on an elemental. It takes a differ-

ent magical effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or true

resurrection, to restore it to life.

Pro cient with natural weapons only, unless generally

humanoid in form, in which case pro cient with all simple

weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Elementals are pro cient with shields if they are

pro cient with any form of armor.

Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe.

Energy Drain (Su): This attack saps a living opponents

vital  energy  and  happens  automatically  when  a  melee  or

ranged  attack  hits.  Each  successful  energy  drain  bestows

one or more negative levels (the creatures description speci-

 es how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain

scores a critical hit, it drains twice the given amount. Unless

otherwise speci ed in the creatures description, a draining

creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit) for

each negative level it bestows on an opponent. These tempo-

rary hit points last for up to 1 hour.

An affected opponent takes a 1 penalty on skill checks

and ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses

one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die

roll or calculation) for each negative level. A spellcaster loses

one spell slot of the highest level of spells she can cast and (if

applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss persists

until the negative level is removed.

Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until

they  are  removed  by  a  spell,  such  as  restoration.  If  a  nega-

tive level is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the

affected  creature  must  attempt  a  Fortitude  save  (DC  10  +

1/2 draining creatures racial HD + draining creatures Cha

modi er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive

text). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm

to the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away,

but  the  creatures  level  (or  HD)  is  also  reduced  by  one.  A

separate saving throw is required for each negative level.

Environment: This entry in a monster description pro-

vides the climate and terrain (as de ned in Chapter 3 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide) where the creature is typically found.

Note that these environments can also exist in portions of

dungeons due to magical effects or other supernatural inter-

ference,  or  as  features  in  dungeons  or  other  environment

areas.

Evil Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsid-

ers native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are

also called  ends. Most creatures that have this subtype also

have evil alignments; however, if their alignments change,

they  still  retain  the  subtype.  Any  effect  that  depends  on

alignment affects a creature that has this subtype as if the

creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment

actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its

actual alignment. A creature that has the evil subtype over-

comes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any

weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction,

above).

Extraordinary (Ex) Abilities: Extraordinary abilities are

nonmagical, dont become ineffective in an antimagic  eld,

and are not subject to any effect that disrupts magic. Using

an  extraordinary  ability  is  a  free  action  unless  otherwise

noted.

Extraplanar Subtype: A subtype applied to any creature

when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature

that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes

from  plane  to  plane.  This  book  assumes  that  encounters

with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every

creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the

extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home

plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home

plane mentioned in its description. These home planes are

taken from the Great Wheel cosmology of the D&D game

(see Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). If your cam-

paign uses a different cosmology, you will need to assign

different home planes to extraplanar creatures.

Creatures  not  labeled  as  extraplanar  are  natives  of  the

Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they

leave the Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar

subtype when it is on a transitive plane; the transitive planes

in the D&D cosmology are the Astral Plane, the Ethereal

Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.

Fast Healing (Ex): A creature that has the fast healing

special  quality  regains  hit  points  at  an  exceptionally  fast

rate, usually 1 or more hit points per round, as given in the

creatures entry (for example, a blood re ooze has fast healing

8). Except where noted here, fast healing is just like natural

healing (PH 146). Fast healing does not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a

creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated,

it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached.

Favored Class: A monster that takes levels in a class (or

more than one class) has a favored class, just as player char-

acters do. In addition, a monsters racial Hit Dice also count

as a favored class, in effect: If the monster becomes a mul-

ticlass character, neither its favored class nor its racial Hit

Dice count when determining whether the creature takes

an experience point penalty.

Fear (Su or Sp): Fear attacks can have various effects.

Fear Aura (Su) The use of this ability is a free action. The

aura can freeze an opponent (such as a mummys despair)

or function like the fear  spell (for example, the aura of a

gorefang spider). Other effects are possible. A fear aura is

an area effect. The descriptive text gives the size and kind

of area.

Fear Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su) These effects usually work

like the fear spell.

If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC

10 + 1/2 fearsome creatures racial HD + creatures Cha modi-

 er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive text).

All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.

Fey Type: A fey is a creature that has supernatural abilities

and connections to nature or to some other force or place.

Fey are usually human-shaped.

Features: A fey has the following features.

6-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  1/2  total  Hit  Dice  (as

wizard).

noted in a creatures entry).

Low-light vision.

Pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any  weapons

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Fey not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient with

armor. Fey are pro cient with shields if they are pro cient

with any form of armor.

Fey eat, sleep, and breathe.

Fire  Subtype:  A  creature  that  has  the   re  subtype  has

immunity to  re. It has vulnerability to cold, which means

it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if

the save is a success or failure.

Frightful  Presence  (Ex):  This  special  quality  makes  a

creatures  very  presence  unsettling  to  foes.  It  takes  effect

automatically  when  the  creature  performs  some  sort  of

dramatic action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling).

Opponents  within  range  who  witness  the  action  might

become frightened or shaken.

Actions  required  to  trigger  the  ability  are  given  in  the

creatures descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, and

the duration is usually 5d6 rounds.

This  ability  affects  only  opponents  that  have  fewer  Hit

Dice or levels than the creature has. An affected opponent

can resist the effects by making a successful Will save (DC

10 + 1/2 frightful creatures racial HD + frightful creatures

Cha modi er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descrip-

tive text). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw

is immune to that same creatures frightful presence for 24

hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Gaze (Su): A gaze attack takes effect when opponents look

at the creatures eyes. The attack can have almost any sort of

effect:  petri cation,  death,  charm,  and  so  on.  The  typical

range is 30 feet, but check the creatures entry for details.

The type of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is

usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creatures

racial HD + gazing creatures Cha modi er; the exact DC is

given in the creatures descriptive text). A successful saving

throw negates the effect. A monsters gaze attack is described

in abbreviated form in its description.

Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt

a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn

in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature that

has a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents

can avoid the need to attempt the saving throw by not look-

ing at the creature, in one of two ways.

Averting  Eyes:  The  opponent  avoids  looking  at  the  crea-

tures face, instead looking at its body, watching its shadow,

tracking it in a re ective surface, and so on. Each round, the

opponent has a 50% chance to not need to attempt a saving

throw against the gaze attack. The creature that has the gaze

attack, however, gains concealment against that opponent.

Wearing a Blindfold: The opponent cannot see the crea-

ture at all (also possible to achieve by turning ones back

on the creature or shutting ones eyes). The creature that

has  the  gaze  attack  gains  total  concealment  against  the

opponent.

A creature that has a gaze attack can actively gaze as an

attack action by choosing a target within range. That oppo-

nent must attempt a saving throw but can try to avoid this as

described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save

against a creatures gaze twice during the same round, once

before the opponents action and once during the creatures

turn.

Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is

immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless otherwise

noted. Allies of a creature that has a gaze attack might be

affected. All the creatures allies are considered to be averting

their eyes from the creature that has the gaze attack, and have

a 50% chance to not need to attempt a saving throw against

the gaze attack each round. The creature also can veil its eyes,

thus negating its gaze ability.

Giant  Type:  A  giant  is  a  humanoid-shaped  creature  of

great strength, usually of at least Large size.

Features: A giant has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Good Fortitude saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A giant possesses the following traits (unless other-

wise noted in a creatures entry).

Low-light vision.

Pro cient with all simple and martial weapons, as well

as any natural weapons.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Giants not described as wearing armor are not pro cient with

armor. Giants are pro cient with shields if they are pro cient

with any form of armor.

Giants eat, sleep, and breathe.

Goblinoid  Subtype:  Goblinoids  are  stealthy  human-

oids  who  live  by  hunting  and  raiding  and  who  all  speak

Goblin.

Good Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsid-

ers native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures

that have this subtype also have good alignments; however,

if  their  alignments  change,  they  still  retain  the  subtype.

Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature that

has  this  subtype  as  if  the  creature  has  a  good  alignment,

no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also

suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature

that has the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as

if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were good-

aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).

Humanoid Type: A humanoid usually has two arms, two

legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head.

Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary

abilities,  but  most  can  speak  and  usually  have  well-devel-

oped  societies.  They  usually  are  Small  or  Medium.  Every

humanoid creature also has a subtype, such as elf, goblinoid,

or reptilian.

Humanoids that have 1 Hit Die exchange the features of

their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC

class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level war-

riors, which means that they have average combat ability and

poor saving throws.

Humanoids that have more than 1 Hit Die (for example,

gnolls and bugbears) are the only humanoids who make use

of the features of the humanoid type.

Features: A humanoid has the following features (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Good  Re ex  saves  (usually;  a  humanoids  good  save

varies).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, or

by character class.

Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons,  or  by  character

class.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class.

If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is

pro cient  with  that  type  of  armor  and  all  lighter  types.

Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Humanoids are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.

Immediate Action: Some monsters have special abilities

that they can employ by taking an immediate action. Much

like a swift action (see page 219), an immediate action con-

sumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger

expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. Unlike

a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any

timeeven if its not the creatures turn.

When a creature uses an immediate action on its turn, that

is the same as using a swift action, and that action counts as

the creatures swift action for that turn. A creature cannot

use another immediate action or a swift action until after its

next turn if it has used an immediate action when it is not

currently its turn. A creature also cannot use an immediate

action if it is currently  at-footed.

Immunity: A creature that has immunity to an effect is

never harmed (or helped) by that effect. A creature cannot

suppress an immunity in order to receive a bene cial effect.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a creature that has this ability hits

with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of opportunity (see Grapple, PH

155). No initial touch attack is required.

Unless  otherwise  noted,  improved  grab  works  only

against  opponents  at  least  one  size  category  smaller  than

the  creature.  The  creature  has  the  option  to  conduct  the

grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used

in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to

do the latter, it takes a 20 penalty on grapple checks, but is

not considered grappled itself; the creature does not lose its

Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use

its remaining attacks against other opponents.

A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless

the creature also has the constrict ability. If the creature does

not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated

for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals

constriction  damage  as  well  (the  amount  is  given  in  the

creatures descriptive text).

When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab attack,

it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke

attacks of opportunity. It can even move (possibly carrying

away  the  opponent),  provided  it  can  drag  the  opponents

weight.

Incorporeal Subtype: Some creatures are incorporeal

by nature, while others (such as those that become ghosts)

can acquire the incorporeal subtype. An incorporeal crea-

ture has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other

incorporeal  creatures,  magic  weapons  or  creatures  that

strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or

supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack

forms. Even when hit by spells, including touch spells, or

magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative

energy, force effects such as magic missile, or attacks made

with  ghost  touch  weapons).  Nondamaging  spell  effects

affect incorporeal creatures normally unless they require

corporeal  targets  to  function  (such  as  implosion)  or  they

create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would

normally  be  unaffected  by  (such  as  a web  or  wall  of  stone

spell). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can

affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a

50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal creature.

An incorporeal creatures attacks pass through (ignore) nat-

ural armor, armor, and shields, although de ection bonuses

and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against

it. Nonmagical attacks made by an incorporeal creature with

a melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any

melee  attack  an  incorporeal  creature  makes  with  a  magic

weapon  against  a  corporeal  target  has  a  50%  miss  chance,

except for attacks it makes with a ghost touch weapon, while

are made normally (no miss chance).

Any equipment worn or carried by an incorporeal crea-

ture is also incorporeal as long as it remains in the creatures

possession.  An  object  that  the  creature  relinquishes  loses

its  incorporeal  quality  (and  the  creature  loses  the  ability

to manipulate the object). If an incorporeal creature uses a

thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes

corporeal  as  soon  as  it  is   red  and  can  affect  a  corporeal

target normally (no miss chance). Magic items possessed by

G

L

O

S

S

A

R

Y

211

an incorporeal creature work normally with respect to their

effects on the creature or on another target. Similarly, spells

cast  by  an  incorporeal  creature  affect  corporeal  creatures

normally.

An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but

has a de ection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always

at  least  +1,  even  if  the  creatures  Charisma  score  does  not

normally provide a bonus).

An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid

objects,  but  must  remain  adjacent  to  the  objects  exterior,

and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space

is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures

or objects within a square adjacent to its current location,

but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from

an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to

see farther from the object it is in and attack normally, the

incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature

inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature

outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside with

a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal

creature cannot pass through a force effect.

Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water

as  easily  as  they  do  in  air.  Incorporeal  creatures  cannot

fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot

make trip or grapple attempts, nor can they be tripped or

grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that

would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment,

nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures

have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered

by weight.

An  incorporeal  creature  moves  silently  and  cannot  be

heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be. It has no

Strength score, so its Dexterity modi er applies to both its

melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such

as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly

effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal

creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at

full speed even when they cannot see.

Lawful Subtype: The lawful subtype usually applies only

to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes. Most

creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments;

however, if their alignments change, they still retain the sub-

type. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature

that has this subtype as if the creature has a lawful alignment,

no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also

suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature

that has the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as

if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-

aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).

Level Adjustment: Certain monsters can used as the basis

for interesting, viable player characters. These creatures have

a level adjustment entry, which is a number that is added to

the  creatures  total  Hit  Dice  to  arrive  at  its  effective  char-

acter level. A creature that has multiple special abilities is

more powerful as a player character than its Hit Dice alone

would indicate. For example, a drow elf has spell resistance,

bonuses to its ability scores, and spell-like abilities. Its level

adjustment of +2 indicates that a 1st-level drow wizard is the

equivalent of a 3rd-level character.

Some creatures level adjustment entries include the word

(cohort). Although these creatures might be problematic

as  PCs,  they  make  good  companions  for  a  character  who

has taken the Leadership feat. Some other creatures arent

intended for use as PCs or cohorts but can become compan-

ions through the use of the Improved Familiar feat. In these

cases, the level adjustment entry is a dash followed by the

words (Improved Familiar).

Level adjustment is not the same thing as an adjustment

to  a  creatures  Challenge  Rating  because  of  some  special

qualities it possesses. Challenge Rating re ects how dif cult

an opponent is to  ght in a limited number of encounters.

Level adjustment shows how powerful a creature is as a player

character or cohort in campaign play. For instance, a drow

receives a +1 adjustment to its Challenge Rating to account

for its special abilities, indicating that its tougher in a  ght

than its Hit Dice would suggest, but its level adjustment is

+2 to balance its abilities over long-term play.

Living:  Any  creature  that  has  a  Constitution  score  is

a  living  creature.  Constructs  and  undead  are  not  living

creatures.

Living Construct Subtype: A living construct is a new

subtype of construct, a created being given sentience and free

will through powerful and complex creation enchantments.

Living constructs combine aspects of both constructs and

living creatures, as detailed below.

Features: A living construct derives its Hit Dice, base attack

bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the

class it selects.

Traits:  A  living  construct  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Unlike other constructs, a living construct has a Con-

stitution score. A living construct does not gain bonus hit

points by size but gains (or loses) bonus hit points through

a Constitution bonus (or penalty) as with other living crea-

tures.

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  does  not

have low-light vision or darkvision.

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  is  not

immune to mind-in uencing effects.

Immunity  to  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  disease,

nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, and energy drain.

A living construct cannot heal damage naturally.

Unlike other constructs, living constructs are subject

to extra damage from critical hits, effects requiring a Forti-

tude save, death from massive damage, nonlethal damage,

stunning, ability damage, ability drain, and death effects or

necromancy effects.

Unlike other constructs, a living construct can use the

run action.

Living constructs can be affected by spells that target

living creatures as well as by those that target constructs.

Damage dealt to a living construct can be healed by a cure

light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example,

and a living construct is vulnerable to a harm spell. However,

Y

R

A

S

S

O

L

G

212

spells from the healing subschool provide only half effect

to a living construct.

A living construct responds slightly differently from

other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A living

construct that has 0 hit points is disabled, just like a living

creature. He can only take a single move action or standard

action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk

further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater

than 10, a living construct is inert. He is unconscious and

helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an

inert  living  construct  does  not  lose  additional  hit  points

unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature

that is stable.

Can be raised or resurrected.

Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but can still ben-

e t from the effects of consumable spells and magic items

such as heroes feast and potions.

Does not need to sleep, but must rest for 8 hours before

preparing spells.

Low-Light  Vision  (Ex):  A  creature  that  has  low-light

vision can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight,

torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination.

It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under

these conditions.

Magic Strike: Natural weapon attacks made by a creature

that has this ability are treated as magic for the purpose of

overcoming  damage  reduction.  When  it  applies,  magic

strike appears in the Atk Options line of a creatures statis-

tics block.

Magical Beast Type: Magical beasts are similar to ani-

mals but can have Intelligence scores higher than 2. Magical

beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary abilities,

but sometimes are merely bizarre in appearance or habits.

Features: A magical beast has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Fortitude and Re ex saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A magical beast possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Magical beasts eat, sleep, and breathe.

Manufactured Weapons: Some monsters employ man-

ufactured  weapons  when  they  attack.  Creatures  that  use

swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as

characters, including those for additional attacks from a high

base attack bonus and two-weapon  ghting penalties. This

category also includes found items, such as rocks and logs,

that a creature wields in combatin essence, any weapon

that is not intrinsic to the creature.

Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manu-

factured weapons when they make a full attack. When they

do  so,  the  manufactured  weapon  attack  is  considered  the

primary  attack  unless  the  creatures  description  indicates

otherwise (using the manufactured weapon consumes most

of  the  creatures  attention),  and  any  natural  weapons  the

creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks.

These secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary

attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they

take the usual 5 penalty (or 2 with the Multiattack feat)

for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is normally

the creatures primary natural weapon.

Monstrous Humanoid Type: Monstrous humanoids are

similar to humanoids, but they have monstrous or animalis-

tic features. They often have magical abilities as well.

Features:  A  monstrous  humanoid  has  the  following  fea-

tures.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Re ex and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits:  A  monstrous  humanoid  possesses  the  following

traits (unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any  weapons

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Monstrous humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are

not pro cient with armor. Monstrous humanoids are pro-

 cient with shields if they are pro cient with any form of

armor.

Monstrous humanoids eat, sleep, and breathe.

Movement Modes: Creatures can have modes of move-

ment other than walking and running. These are natural,

not magical, unless speci cally noted in a monster descrip-

tion.

Burrow:  A  creature  that  has  a  burrow  speed  can  tunnel

through dirt, but not through rock unless the descriptive

text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run while

burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind

tunnels other creatures can use (either because the material

they tunnel through  lls in behind them or because they do

not actually dislocate any material when burrowing); see the

individual creature descriptions for details.

Climb: A creature that has a climb speed has a +8 racial

bonus  on  Climb  checks.  The  creature  must  succeed  on  a

Climb check to climb any wall or slope that has a DC higher

than  0,  but  it  always  can  choose  to  take  10  (see  Checks

without Rolls, PH 65), even if rushed or threatened while

climbing.  The  creature  climbs  at  the  given  speed  while

climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb (see the Climb

skill, PH 69), it moves at double the given climb speed (or its

base land speed, whichever is lower) and attempts a single

Climb  check  at  a  5  penalty.  Creatures  cannot  run  while

climbing. A creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor

Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special

bonus on their attacks against a climbing creature.

Fly: A creature that has a  y speed can move through the air

at the indicated speed if carrying no more than a light load;

G

L

O

S

S

A

R

Y

213

see Carrying Capacity,  PH 161. (Note that medium armor

does not necessarily constitute a medium load.) All  y speeds

include a parenthetical note indicating maneuverability, as

follows:

Perfect:  The  creature  can  perform  almost  any  aerial

maneuver  it  wishes.  It  moves  through  the  air  as  well  as  a

human moves over smooth ground.

Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a house-

 y or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as readily

as those that have perfect maneuverability.

Average:  The  creature  can   y  as  adroitly  as  a  small

bird.

Poor: The creature  ies as well as a very large bird.

Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.

A creature that  ies can make dive attacks. A dive attack

works just like a charge, but the diving creature must move a

minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make

only claw or talon attacks, but these deal double damage. A

creature can use the run action while  ying, provided it  ies

in a straight line.

For  more  information,  see  Tactical  Aerial  Movement,

DMG 20.

Swim: A creature that has a swim speed can move through

water at that speed without making Swim checks. It has a

+8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special

action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always can choose

to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered.

The creature can use the run action while swimming, pro-

vided it swims in a straight line.

Native  Subtype:  A  subtype  applied  only  to  outsiders.

These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connec-

tion to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated,

or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures

that have this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence

the subtypes name).

Unlike  true  outsiders,  native  outsiders  need  to  eat  and

sleep.

Natural Weapons: Natural weapons are weapons that are

physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee

attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise, it threatens

any space it can reach.

Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high

base attack bonus when using natural weapons. The number

of  attacks  a  creature  can  make  with  its  natural  weapons

depends on the type of the attackgenerally, a creature can

make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one

gore attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although

Large creatures that have arms or armlike limbs can make a

slam attack with each arm). Refer to the individual monster

descriptions.

Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a criti-

cal hit on a natural attack roll of 20.

When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one

of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary

weapon. All the creatures remaining natural weapons are

secondary.

The  primary  weapon  is  given  in  the  creatures  Attack

entry, and the primary weapon or weapons is given  rst in

the creatures Full Attack entry. A creatures primary natural

weapon is its most effective natural attack, usually by virtue

of the creatures physiology, training, or innate talent with

the weapon. An attack with a primary natural weapon uses

the creatures full attack bonus. Attacks with secondary natu-

ral weapons are less effective and are made with a 5 penalty

on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures

that have the Multiattack feat take only a 2 penalty on sec-

ondary attacks.)

Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The

most common are summarized below.

Bite: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing,

slashing, and bludgeoning damage.

Claw or Talon: The creature rips with a sharp appendage,

dealing piercing and slashing damage.

Gore:  The  creature  spears  the  opponent  with  an  antler,

horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.

Slap  or  Slam:  The  creature  batters  opponents  with  an

appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.

Sting: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing

damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in

addition to hit point damage.

Tentacle: The creature  ails at opponents with a powerful

tentacle,  dealing  bludgeoning  (and  sometimes  slashing)

damage.

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores.

These creatures do not have an ability score of 0they lack

the  ability  altogether.  The  modi er  for  a  nonability  is  +0.

Other effects of nonabilities are detailed below.

Strength: Any creature that can physically manipulate other

objects has at least 1 point of Strength.

A creature that has no Strength score cant exert force, usu-

ally because it has no physical body (a whisper demon, for

example). The creature automatically fails Strength checks.

If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modi er to

its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modi er.

Dexterity: Any creature that can move has at least 1 point

of Dexterity.

A creature that has no Dexterity score cant move. If it can

perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its Intel-

ligence modi er to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity

modi er. The creature automatically fails Re ex saves and

Dexterity checks.

Constitution:  Any  living  creature  has  at  least  1  point  of

Constitution.

A creature that has no Constitution has no body (a stone

specter, for example) or no metabolism (a clockwork stal-

lion). It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless the effect works on objects or is harmless. For

example, a zombie is unaffected by any kind of poison but

is  susceptible  to  a  disintegrate  spell.  The  creature  is  also

immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain,

and automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature that

has  no  Constitution  cannot  tire  and  thus  can  run  inde -

nitely without tiring (unless the creatures description says

it cannot run).

Intelligence: Any creature that can think, learn, or remem-

ber has at least 1 point of Intelligence.

A creature that has no Intelligence score (such as a blood-

silk spider) is mindless, an automaton operating on simple

instincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to

mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) and automatically

fails Intelligence checks.

Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although

they might have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.

Wisdom: Any creature that can perceive its environment

in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.

Anything  that  has  no  Wisdom  score  is  an  object,  not  a

creature.  Anything  without  a  Wisdom  score  also  has  no

Charisma score.

Charisma: Any creature capable of telling the difference

between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1 point

of Charisma.

Anything that has no Charisma score is an object, not a

creature.  Anything  without  a  Charisma  score  also  has  no

Wisdom score.

Ooze Type: An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature,

usually mindless.

Features: An ooze has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

No good saving throws.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the ooze has an Intelligence score. However, most oozes are

mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: An ooze possesses the following traits (unless oth-

erwise noted in a creatures entry).

Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all

mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

Blind  (but  have  the  blindsight  special  quality),  with

immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other

attack forms that rely on sight.

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph,

and stunning.

Some  oozes  have  the  ability  to  deal  acid  damage  to

objects.  In  such  a  case,  the  amount  of  damage  is  equal  to

10 + 1/2 oozes HD + oozes Con modi er per full round of

contact.

Not  subject  to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits  or

 anking.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.

Outsider Type: An outsider is at least partially composed

of  the  essence  (but  not  necessarily  the  material)  of  some

plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out

as some other type and become outsiders when they attain a

higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.

Features: An outsider has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Fortitude, Re ex, and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (8 + Int modi er) per Hit Die, with

quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An outsider possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not

have a dual natureits soul and body form one unit. When

an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore

souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resur-

rection, dont work on an outsider. It takes a different magical

effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection to

restore it to life. An outsider that has the native subtype (see

page 214) can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as

other living creatures can be.

Pro cient with all simple and martial weapons and any

weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Outsiders are pro cient with shields if they are

pro cient with any form of armor.

Outsiders  breathe,  but  do  not  need  to  eat  or  sleep

(although  they  can  do  so  if  they  wish).  Native  outsiders

breathe, eat, and sleep.

Paralysis (Ex or Su): A paralysis attack renders the victim

immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take

any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen

and helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a character

can usually resist it with a successful Fortitude saving throw

(the DC is given in the creatures description). Unlike hold

person and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a

new save each round. A winged creature  ying in the air at

the time that it is paralyzed cannot  ap its wings and falls.

A swimmer cant swim and might drown.

Plant Type: This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note

that regular plants, such as one  nds growing in gardens and

 elds, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see Nonabilities,

above) and are not creatures, but objects, even though they

are alive.

Features: A plant creature has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Good Fortitude saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the plant creature has an Intelligence score. However, some

plant  creatures  are  mindless  and  gain  no  skill  points  or

feats.

Traits:  A  plant  creature  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Low-light vision.

Immunity to all mind-affecting spells or abilities (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph,

and stunning.

Not subject to extra damage from critical hits.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Plants breathe and eat, but do not sleep.

Poison (Ex): Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as

ability  damage  (see  page  205)  or  some  other  effect,  to  the

opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted,

another saving throw is required 1 minute later (regardless of

the  rst saves result) to avoid secondary damage. A creatures

descriptive text provides the details.

A creature that has a poison attack is immune to its own

poison and the poison of others of its kind.

The Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to

10 + 1/2 poisoning creatures racial HD + poisoning creatures

Con modi er (the exact DC is given in the creatures descrip-

tive text). A successful save avoids (negates) the damage.

Pounce (Ex): When a creature that has this ability makes

a  charge,  it  can  follow  with  a  full  attackincluding  rake

attacks if the creature also has the rake ability.

Psionics (Sp): These are spell-like abilities that a creature

generates with the power of its mind. The saving throw (if

any) against a psionic ability is 10 + the level of the spell the

ability  resembles  or  duplicates  +  the  creatures  Cha  modi-

 er.

Racial Hit Dice: The Hit Dice a monster has by virtue

of what type of creature it is. Hit Dice gained from taking

class levels are not racial Hit Dice. For example, the corrup-

tor of fate assassin described in this book is a 12 HD creature

because of its  ve levels of assassin, but it has 7 racial Hit Dice

(the same number as a typical corruptor of fate without any

class levels).

Rake (Ex): A creature that has this ability gains extra natu-

ral attacks when it grapples its foe. Normally, a monster can

attack with only one of its natural weapons while grappling,

but  a  monster  that  has  the  rake  ability  usually  gains  two

additional claw attacks that it can use only against a grappled

foe. Rake attacks are not subject to the usual 4 penalty for

attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple.

A monster that has the rake ability must begin its turn

grappling to use its rakeit cant begin a grapple and rake

in the same turn.

Ray (Su or Sp): This form of attack works like a ranged

attack (see Aiming a Spell, PH 175). Hitting with a ray attack

requires  a  successful  ranged  touch  attack  roll,  ignoring

armor,  natural  armor,  and  shield  and  using  the  creatures

ranged attack bonus. Ray attacks have no range increment.

The creatures descriptive text speci es the maximum range,

effects, and any applicable saving throw.

Regeneration  (Ex):  A  creature  that  has  this  ability  is

dif cult to kill. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as non-

lethal damage. The creature automatically heals non lethal

damage at a  xed rate per round, as given in the entry (for

example, a dread blossom swarm has regeneration 5). Certain

attack forms, typically  re and acid, deal lethal damage to the

creature, which doesnt go away. The creatures descriptive

text describes the details.

A  regenerating  creature  that  has  been  rendered  uncon-

scious through nonlethal damage can be killed with a coup

de grace (PH 153). The attack cannot be of a type that auto-

matically converts to nonlethal damage.

Attack forms that dont deal hit point damage (for example,

most poisons) ignore regeneration. Regeneration also does

not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffoca-

tion.

Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their

bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts; details

are in the creatures descriptive text. Severed parts that are

not reattached wither and die normally.

A  creature  must  have  a  Constitution  score  to  have  the

regeneration ability.

Rend (Ex): If a creature that has this ability hits with the

speci ed natural attack, it latches onto the opponents body

and tears the  esh. A rend attack deals damage equal to the

creatures natural attack + 1-1/2 times its Str modi er. The

creatures descriptive text gives the exact amount.

Reptilian Subtype: These creatures are scaly and usually

cold-blooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe

a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that

are truly reptiles.

Resistance to Energy (Ex): A creature that has this spe-

cial quality ignores some damage of the indicated type each

time it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold,  re,

or electricity). The entry indicates the amount and type of

damage ignored. For example, a wrackspawn has resistance

to  re 5, so it ignores the  rst 5 points of  re damage dealt

to it anytime it takes  re damage.

Scent (Ex) This special quality allows a creature to detect

approaching  enemies,  sniff  out  hidden  foes,  and  track  by

sense of smell. Creatures that have the scent ability can iden-

tify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense

of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60

feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as

smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges

noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or

troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the

source is not revealedonly its presence somewhere within

range. The creature can take a move action to note the direc-

tion of the scent. Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet

of the source, the creature pinpoints the sources location.

A  creature  that  has  the  Track  feat  and  the  scent  ability

can follow tracks by smell, making a sucessful Wisdom (or

Survival) check to  nd or follow a track. The typical DC for

a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the

scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how

strong the quarrys odor is, the number of creatures, and the

age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC

increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the

Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of

surface conditions and poor visibility.

Shapechanger Subtype: A shapechanger has the super-

natural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many

magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not

every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger

subtype.

Traits:  A  shapechanger  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Pro cient with its natural weapons, with simple weap-

ons,  and  with  any  weapons  mentioned  in  the  creatures

description.

Pro cient with any armor mentioned in the creatures

description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor

is mentioned, the shapechanger is not pro cient with armor.

A shapechanger is pro cient with shields if it is pro cient

with any type of armor.

Size:  The  nine  size  categories  are  (in  ascending  order)

Fine, Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gar-

gantuan, and Colossal. A creatures size provides a modi er

to its Armor Class and attack bonus, a modi er on grapple

checks it attempts, and a modi er on Hide checks. The Crea-

ture Sizes table above provides a summary of the attributes

that apply to each size category.

Sonic  Attacks  (Su):  Unless  otherwise  noted,  a  sonic

attack follows the rules for spreads (see Aiming a Spell, PH

175). The range of the spread is measured from the creature

using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect,

deafening the subject or stopping its ears does not end the

effect. Stopping ones ears ahead of time allows opponents to

avoid having to attempt saving throws against mind-affecting

sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks (such as

those that deal damage). Stopping ones ears is a full-round

action and requires wax or other soundproof material to stuff

into the ears.

Spell-Like (Sp) Abilities: Spell-like abilities are magical

and work just like spells (though they are not spells and so

have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components).

They go away in an antimagic  eld and are subject to spell

resistance  if  the  spell  the  ability  resembles  or  duplicates

would be subject to spell resistance.

A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can

be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at will has no

use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless

otherwise noted, and doing so while threatened provokes

attacks  of  opportunity.  It  is  possible  to  make  a  successful

Concentration check to use a spell-like ability defensively

and  avoid  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity,  just  as  when

casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be disrupted just as a

spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counter-

spell, nor can they be counterspelled.

For  creatures  that  have  spell-like  abilities,  a  designated

caster level de nes how dif cult it is to dispel their spell-like

effects and to de ne any level-dependent variables (such as

range and duration) the abilities might have. The creatures

caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the crea-

ture has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the

level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of

the same name. If no caster level is speci ed, the caster level

is equal to the creatures racial Hit Dice.

The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10

+ the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates +

the creatures Cha modi er.

Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that might work

differently or be of a different level when cast by characters of

different classes. A monsters spell-like abilities are presumed

to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in question

is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric, druid,

bard, paladin, and ranger, in that order.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A creature that has spell resistance

can  avoid  the  effects  of  spells  and  spell-like  abilities  that

directly affect it. To determine if a spell or spell-like ability

works against a creature that has spell resistance, the caster

must  attempt  a  caster  level  check  (1d20  +  caster  level).  If

the check result equals or exceeds the creatures spell resis-

tance, the spell works normally, although the creature is still

allowed a saving throw.

Spells:  Sometimes  a  creature  can  cast  arcane  or  divine

spells just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and can

activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject

to the same spellcasting rules that characters are, except as

follows.

A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can pro-

vide any somatic component a spell might require by moving

its body. Such a creature also does need material components

for its spells. The creature can cast the spell by either touch-

ing the required component (but not if the component is in

another creatures possession) or having the required compo-

nent on its person. Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize

the Eschew Materials feat to avoid fussing with noncostly

components.

A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class

unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any class abilities.

For example, a creature that casts arcane spells as a sorcerer

cannot acquire a familiar. A creature that has access to cleric

spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives

domain spells if noted, but it does not receive domain granted

powers unless it has at least one level in the cleric class.

Summon (Sp): A creature that has the summon ability can

summon speci c other creatures of its kind much as though

casting a summon monster spell, but it usually has only a lim-

ited chance of success (as speci ed in the creatures entry).

Roll  d%:  On  a  failure,  no  creature  answers  the  summons.

Summoned  creatures  automatically  return  whence  they

came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned

cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.

Most creatures that have the ability to summon do not use

it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned

creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save

their own lives.

An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning

ability for purposes of Concentration checks and attempts

to dispel the summoned creature. As stated on page 37 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide, no experience points are awarded for

summoned monsters.

Supernatural (Su) Abilities: Supernatural abilities are

magical and go away in an antimagic  eld but are not subject

to spell resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled.

Using a supernatural ability is a standard action unless oth-

erwise noted. Supernatural abilities might have a use limit

or  be  usable  at  will,  just  like  spell-like  abilities.  However,

supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of opportunity

and never require Concentration checks. Unless otherwise

noted, a supernatural ability has an effective caster level equal

to the creatures Hit Dice.

The saving throw (if any) against a supernatural ability is

10 + 1/2 the creatures HD + the creatures ability modi er

(usually Charisma).

Swallow Whole (Ex): If a creature that has this ability

begins  its  turn  with  an  opponent  held  in  its  mouth  (see

Improved Grab, page 211), it can attempt a new grapple check

(as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds,

it  swallows  its  prey,  and  the  opponent  takes  bite  damage.

Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to one size

category smaller than the swallowing creature.

Being swallowed has various consequences, depending on

the creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is

considered to be grappled, while the creature that did the

swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its

way  free  with  any  light  slashing  or  piercing  weapon  (the

amount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the

creature description), or it can just try to escape the grapple.

The Armor Class of the interior of a creature that swallows

whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no

modi ers  for  size  or  Dexterity.  If  the  swallowed  creature

escapes  the  grapple,  success  puts  it  back  in  the  attackers

mouth, where it might be bitten or swallowed again.

Swarm Subtype: A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminu-

tive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm

has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A

swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single

initiative modi er, a single speed, and a single Armor Class.

A swarm attempts saving throws as a single creature.

A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of non y-

ing creatures) or a cube (of  ying creatures) 10 feet on a side,

but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order

to attack, it moves into an opponents space, which provokes

attacks of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a crea-

ture of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can

move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa

without impediment, although the swarm provokes attacks

of  opportunity  if  it  does  so.  A  swarm  can  move  through

cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.

A  swarm  of  Tiny  creatures  consists  of  300  non ying

creatures or 1,000  ying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive

creatures  consists  of  1,500  non ying  creatures  or  5,000

 ying  creatures.  A  swarm  of  Fine  creatures  consists  of

10,000 creatures, whether they are  ying or not. Swarms of

non ying creatures include many more creatures than could

normally  t in a 10-foot square based on their normal space,

because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together

and generally crawl over each other and their prey when

moving  or  attacking.  Larger  swarms  are  represented  by

multiples of single swarms. (A swarm of 15,000 centipedes

is ten centipede swarms, each swarm occupying a 10-foot

square.) The area occupied by a large swarm is completely

shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous

squares.

Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no discern-

ible anatomy, so it is not subject to extra damage from critical

hits or  anking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes

half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm

composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all

weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to break

up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its

ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered

or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be

tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple

an opponent.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a

speci c number of creatures (including single-target spells

such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting

spells and abilities (charms, compulsions, phantasms, pat-

terns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence

score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much

damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such

as splash weapons and many evocation spells.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are sus-

ceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of wind

spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a

swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its

constituent creatures (see Winds, DMG 95). For example, a

clockwork  mender  swarm  (Diminutive  creatures)  can  be

blown away by a severe wind. Wind effects deal 1d6 points

of nonlethal damage to a swarm per spell level (or Hit Dice

of the originating creature, in the case of effects such as an

air elementals whirlwind). A swarm rendered unconscious

by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and

dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points exceed

its nonlethal damage.

Swarm Attack: Creatures that have the swarm subtype dont

make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic

damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end

of  their  move,  with  no  attack  roll  needed.  Swarm  attacks

are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A

swarms statistics block has swarm in the Attack and Full

Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of

damage  a  swarm  deals  is  based  on  its  Hit  Dice,  as  shown

below.

A  swarms  attacks  are  nonmagical,  unless  the  swarms

description states otherwise. Damage reduction suf cient to

reduce a swarm attacks damage to 0, being incorporeal, and

other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or

at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms

also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other kinds of attacks

in addition to normal damage.

Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do

not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack.

However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as

described below.

Distraction (Ex) Any living creature vulnerable to a swarms

damage  that  begins  its  turn  with  a  swarm  in  its  square

is  nauseated  for  1  round;  a  Fortitude  save  (DC  10  +  1/2

swarms HD + swarms Con modi er; the exact DC is given

in a swarms description) negates the effect. Spellcasting or

concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires

a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills

that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20

Concentration check.

Swift Action: Some monsters have special abilities that

they  can  employ  by  taking  a  swift  action.  A  swift  action

consumes  a  very  small  amount  of  time,  but  represents  a

larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action.

A creature can perform one swift action per turn without

affecting its ability to perform other actions. In that regard,

a swift action is like a free action. However, it can perform

only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other

actions it takes.

Tanarri Subtype: Many demons belong to the race of

evil outsiders known as the tanarri.

Traits: A tanarri possesses the following traits (unless oth-

erwise noted in a creatures entry).

Immunity to electricity and poison.

Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and  re 10.

Summon  (Sp)  Tanarri  share  the  ability  to  summon

others of their kind (the success chance and kind of tanarri

summoned are noted in each monster description).

Telepathy.

Telepathic  Link  (Ex):  Creatures  that  have  this  ability

share  a  communal  consciousness,  enabling  them  to  com-

municate telepathically with other creatures of their kind.

A group of such creatures within a certain distance of each

other (speci ed in the creatures entry) are in constant con-

tact. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one

in the group is not  at-footed, none of them are. No creature

in the group is considered  anked unless all are.

Telepathy (Su): A creature that has this ability can com-

municate  telepathically  with  any  other  creature  within  a

certain range (speci ed in the creatures entry, usually 100

feet) that has a language. It is possible to address multiple

creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a tele-

pathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is

just as dif cult as simultaneously speaking and listening to

multiple people at the same time.

Trample (Ex): As a full-round action, a creature that has

this ability can move up to twice its speed and literally run

over any opponents at least one size category smaller than

itself. The creature merely has to move over the opponents

in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered

by the trampling creatures space is subject to the trample

attack.

If a targets space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered

trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares

it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over only some of

a targets space, the target can make an attack of opportunity

against the trampling creature at a 4 penalty. A trampling

creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal

space  returns  to  the  last  legal  position  it  occupied,  or  the

closest legal position, if theres a legal position thats closer.

A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creatures

slam damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modi er). The creatures

descriptive text gives the exact amount.

Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity,

but these take a 4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of

opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Re ex saves

to take half damage. The save DC against a creatures trample

attack is 10 + 1/2 creatures HD + creatures Str modi er (the

exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive text). A tram-

pling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target

once per round, no matter how many times its movement

takes it over a target creature.

sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically

pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the

ground.  Aquatic  creatures  that  have  tremorsense  can  also

sense the location of creatures moving through water. The

abilitys range is speci ed in the creatures descriptive text.

Turn  Resistance  (Ex):  A  creature  that  has  this  special

quality (usually an undead) is less easily affected by clerics

or  paladins  (see  Turn  or  Rebuke  Undead, PH   159).  When

resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add

the  indicated  number  to  the  creatures  Hit  Dice  total.  For

example, a vitreous drinker has 14 Hit Dice and +6 turn resis-

tance. Attempts to turn, rebuke, command, or bolster treat a

vitreous drinker as though it had 20 Hit Dice, though it is a

14 HD creature for any other purpose.

Typical  Treasure:  This  entry  in  a  monster  description

describes how much wealth a creature owns. (See DMG 5256

for details about treasure, particularly Tables 35 through 38.)

In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and

has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures

that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend

to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.

Undead Type: Undead are once-living creatures animated

by spiritual or supernatural forces.

Features: An undead creature has the following features.

12-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  1/2  total  Hit  Dice  (as

wizard).

Good Will saves.

Skill  points  equal  to  (4  +  Int  modi er,  minimum  1)

per  Hit  Die,  with  quadruple  skill  points  for  the   rst  Hit

Die, if the undead creature has an Intelligence score. How-

ever,  many  undead  are  mindless  and  gain  no  skill  points

or feats.

Traits: An undead creature possesses the following traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

No Constitution score.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity  to  all  mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities

(charms,  compulsions,  phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale

effects).

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, and death effects.

Not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal

damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to

its physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitu-

tion), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.

Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence

score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such as

an in ict spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing

special quality works regardless of the creatures Intelligence

score.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save

(unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).

Uses its Charisma modi er for Concentration checks.

Not  at  risk  of  death  from  massive  damage,  but  when

reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.

Not  affected  by  raise  dead  and  reincarnate  spells  or

abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead

creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the

living creatures they were before becoming undead.

Pro cient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons,

and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Undead are pro cient with shields if they are

pro cient with any form of armor.

Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.

Vermin Type: This type includes insects, arachnids, other

arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.

Features: Vermin have the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base  attack  bonus  equal  to  3/4  total  Hit  Dice  (as

cleric).

Good Fortitude saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the vermin has an Intelligence score. However, most vermin

are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: Vermin possess the following traits (unless other-

wise noted in a creatures entry).

Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all

mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Pro cient with their natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Vermin breathe, eat, and sleep.

Vulnerability to Energy: Some creatures have vulner-

ability  to  a  certain  kind  of  energy  effect  (typically  either

cold or  re). Such a creature takes half again as much (+50%)

damage  as  normal  from  the  effect,  regardless  of  whether

a  saving  throw  is  allowed,  or  if  the  save  is  a  success  or

failure.

Water Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elemen-

tals and outsiders that have a connection to the Elemental

Plane of Water. Creatures that have the water subtype always

have swim speeds and can move in water without making

Swim checks. A water creature can breathe underwater and

usually can breathe air as well.

Yugoloth Subtype: Possibly the greediest, most sel sh

beings in the Outer Planes, yugoloths reign supreme among

the evil outsiders of Gehenna.
