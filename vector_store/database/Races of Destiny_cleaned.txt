Introduction

Races  of  Destiny  is  a  rules  accessory  for  the  DUNGEONS  &

DRAGONS game. It contains information for both players

and DMs. Players will nd new feats, spells, and prestige

classes for their charactersand a new race that may be

inspiration  for  the  next  character  they  create.  DMs  will

nd a wealth of building blocks for adventures that take

characters  to  human  cities  or  the  remote  fortresses  of

the  illumiansand  along  the  way  theyll  meet  half-elf

diplomats, half-orc mercenaries, and other characters both

fascinating and dangerous.

WHAT IS A

RACE OF DESTINY?

In most D&D worlds, human societies dominate much of

the map, and human culture is standard by which other

cultures are described. Despite other races unusual powers

and long histories, it is humanity and its related races that

seem poised to control the future. This book  focuses  on

these races of destinyhumans and the races that have at

least some human blood within their veins: the half-elves

and  half-orcs.  It  also  explores  races  that  were  once  fully

human, such as the illumians, and creatures that ordinarily

live among humans, such as doppelgangers.

Themes of destiny, community, and interbreeding unite

the  races  of  this  book.  Compared  to  the  elves,  dwarves,

and other longer-lived races, those of human blood have

a relatively short time in the world and strive ardently to

forge their legacies and reshape the world to suit their needs.

Humans explore, conquer, and settle, constantly pushing

the boundaries of civilization. Their villages become towns,

their  towns  become  cities,  and  their  cities  become  the

cosmopolitan ports-of-call for the movers and shakers of

the world.

Sometimes, the human drive to expand and evolve yields

remarkable results. The mingling of human and elf blood

gave rise to the rst half-elves. The union of humans and

orcs brought the rst half-orcs into the world. An ambitious

experiment involving a sorcerous ritual led to the birth of

the illumian race and an entire society built around the

power of the magic word.

WHATS IN THIS BOOK

Most players and DMs can play human characters with-

out too much strain, so rather than dening humans in

general  terms,  this  book  explores  the  trends  that  have

shaped  human  cultures  throughout  history,  covering

such themes as city-building, religion, art, and war. Races

of  Destiny  also  provides  new  insights  into  how  humans

regard other races, as well as feats and prestige classes that

suit the humans versatility and t the books themes of

destiny and community.

Within the D&D milieu, humans interbreed more than

any other race. The human tendency to absorb (some would

say conquer) other races in this manner is touched on briey

as a segue into a discussion of halfbreed races, particularly

half-elves  and  half-orcs.  Half-elves  and  half-orcs  would

seem  to  have  little  in  common  besides  a  shared  human

heritage. However, Races of Destiny explores the social and

psychological ramications of living a life torn between two

very different worlds, covering everything from the half-

orcs outcast attitude to the half-elfs desire for acceptance.

The book also provides new feats, prestige classes, racial

substitution  levels,  and  other  goodies  that  play  off  these

races dual heritage.

To illustrate how humans can evolve within a magical

world,  we  introduce  the  illumianssecret  masters  who

have  used  magic  language  to  transcend  humanity.  Their

ambition and thirst for knowledge rivals that of any human;

however, they have sacriced some of their human versa-

tility for access to arcane secrets that manifest as glowing

sigils about their heads. Whereas humans gather in cities,

illumians nd strength and refuge in the enclaves of their

secret cabals. Herein youll nd the information you need

to create an illumian character, along with enough detail

to ground your new character in illumian culture. Races of

Destiny  also  provides  some  additional  toys  for  illumian

characters  and  NPCs  to  play  with,  including  racial  feats

and prestige classes. Likewise, DMs should have no trouble

inserting the secretive illumians into an ongoing campaign,

using them as patrons, allies, or antagonists in the adven-

tures they create.

Races  of  Destiny  also  discusses  the  panoply  of  strange

races that either live peacefully among humans or have suc-

cessfully inltrated human society, including the twisted

mongrelfolk, the noble aasimar, the less than noble tieings,

and the subtle doppelgangers. Whether youre looking for

an  oddball  race  to  play  or  your  players  next  archenemy,

youll nd something useful here.

In summary, this book explores races whose destiny, for

good or ill, is tied to the fate of the human empires of your

world. If you enjoy playing human characters because of their

versatility and adaptability, you will nd new ways to explore

these human qualities in Races of Destiny. If youre looking for

a humanlike race that trades some of its humanity for super-

natural abilities, the mysterious illumians might capture your

interest. Finally, Races of Destiny explores some of the nuances

of the traditionally angst-ridden halfbreed races, revealing

where they t within human society and giving them new

options that make them even more fun to play.

n a world lled with unusual creatures and bizarre races,

humans stand on their own as a ubiquitous part of any

fantasy campaign. Because D&D players are themselves

human, the ctional humans of the game world describe

a baseline thats easy to relate to. Humans dont have the

special abilities or powers of other races, so they provide a

contrast for the more exotic denizens of the D&D world.

But humans arent boring. No other race has the same

combination of ambition, aggressiveness, and energy. Those

attributes have enabled humanity to spread far and wide,

and in most campaign worlds, human nations cover most

of the map.

Humans are interesting because theyre so active. While

dwarves are mining the depths of the earth and elves are

contemplating  ancient  mysteries,  humans  are  building

empires, settling new lands, and ghting titanic wars with

one another.

The average human isnt as hardy as the average dwarf

or as nimble as the average haling. The average elf has

a greater knack for arcane magic, and the average orc is

certainly  stronger.  But  human  adaptability  and  energy

makes the concept of an average human pretty nebulous.

Individually, humans are vastly different from one another.

Two humans chosen at random have less in common with

each other than two elvesand if the two humans come

from different cultures, they might have less in common

with each other than an elf and a dwarf do.

Human societies are just as varied as the humans that

comprise them. Some human nations are sophisticated

and  organized,  while  others  are  brutal  and  barbaric.

Just by walking down the road in a human land, you

can nd yourself among humans who talk, work, play,

and worship completely differently from the humans

in the community where you started.

This cultural variety is why most campaigns have

multiple human nations, each with its own culture.

Thats the way of humansto divide themselves up

into  different  societies  with  different  behaviors,

customs, and aspirations. Elves, on the other hand,

tend to have a single culture in most campaigns, even

if their communities are spread across the campaign

map and theyre not politically afliated with each

other. Put simply, elves usually act like elves. But

it doesnt mean much to say that humans act like

humans.

Roleplaying Application: If youre playing a

human character, realize that youve got to think

more  about  your  home  culture,  because  humans

dont have the same stereotypical behavior that other

races have. If a player says, Im a dwarf, you know

5

that hell probably act gruff and taciturn, waxing eloquent

about ne stonework and his well-forged axe. That player

has some obvious hooks to hang his characters personality

on.

But if you say, Im a human, you havent said very much

yet. You wont have clear character hooks until you decide

what human culture you hail from and what your place was

in that society. You might be an honor-obsessed swordsman

who reveres his ancestors, or a streetwise gangster with a

quip for every situation. Both characters are equally human.

Once  you  get  a  little  more  specic  about  your  human

characters background, interesting character hooks will

start to emerge from the decisions you make.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Dawn broke upon the eastern shore, spilling light through

Sennas hovel. She rose quickly and tended to the smolder-

ing re, humming to herself as she cooked breakfast for

the rest of the family.

Sennas  father  and  eldest  brother  were  already  awake,

slopping the few hogs that were the bulk of their familys

wealth  and  livelihood.  Winter  was  fast  approaching,  so

Sennas family was feeding the hogs extra in anticipation of

their sale and slaughter. By now, Senna knew the formula:

Half  the  hogs  would  go  to  Duke  Rivus  in  exchange  for

land and protection. The family would keep two hogs to

provide meat through the winter, and the rest would be

sold to Kovar the butcher.

Although  she  was  used  to  discomfort,  Sennas  hands

ached as she pounded out the millet used to make breakfast.

With luck, she mused, well get enough money to x the wagon

and take a trip to Alarak, city of music and life. . . .

A  thousand  miles  south,  the  sun  woke  Venarak  as  its

rays  speared  through  the  dense  jungle  canopy.  Venarak

stretched his lithe, mud-covered body toward the sun and

began to intone his morning prayer. Sacred sun, I give my

thanks to you for bringing your strength into our land.

Protect my wife Kaneka and my daughter Vporo from the

dangers that lurk in our home. Steady my hand as I hunt

and ll our larders with much meat.

Venarak brought both his hands to his head in a nal

salutation. He picked up his bow and quiver, and giving

both his wife and daughter a peck on their cheeks, headed

out into the dense foliage to nd game for his family and

tribe. . . .

Dozens  of  leagues  away,  Nima  cursed  as  the  blare  of

trumpets  woke  her  from  her  tful  slumber.  She  rose

quickly, groaning at how sore her body was from sleeping

in her armor, covered in the mud and lth of the armys

camp. She reached into her pack and pulled out a hunk of

rock-hard jerky, the only food shed had for weeks since

the siege began.

In the faint glow of the morning sun, she could already

make out the columns of soldiers forming ranks for the

next assault. She heard the cries of the wounded echoing

across the battleeld and quickly tuned them out, trying

not to let them get to her. Nima grabbed her polearm and,

with a resolute sigh, marched to join her comrades for the

next attack. . . .

Far from the battleeld, Senjan awoke and dressed quickly

when he heard the sounds of camels grunting outside his

masters  compound.  The  caravan  had  arrived  early,  and

there was much to do.

Once his master unlocked his arm-shackle, Senjan joined

the  other  slaves  in  removing  boxes  and  packages  from

the sides of the beasts. Fruits from the south, spices from

the  north,  and  exotic  wooden  carvings  from  the  island

settlements  in  the  western  seaall  went  into  bunkers

half-buried  in  the  desert  sand.  His  meal  would  have  to

wait until everything was unloaded and the caravan crew

tended. Such was the life of a slave. . . .

HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY

Members of other races shake their heads in amazement

when confronted with the wide spectrum of personalities

that  comprise  humanity.  Even  within  the  same  society,

humans push the limits on variety. However, regardless of

cultural inuence or invidual personality, some psychologi-

cal traits dene the human mind.

ENERGY AND AMBITION

If  humans  have  a  central  psychological  trait,  its  the

remarkable energy and drive they apply to their endeavors.

Whether in trade, exploration, warfare, or the arts, humans

have  an  insatiable  appetite  for  pushing  the  boundaries.

Humans are tenacious when they set their minds to some-

thing, although not as stubborn as dwarves or as farsighted

in their quests as elves. No goal is too far out of reach for

a  motivated  human,  and  no  ambition  is  too  grand.  This

ambitious energy impels humans to settle on the edge of

the wilderness, to build great cities and monuments, and

to crusade against those who threaten them.

AGGRESSION

Human ambition is usually tied to another human trait:

aggression.  Humans  have  a  primal  desire  to  take  what

they  do  not  possess  and  to  expand  their  reach  as  far  as

possible.

While this aggression often translates to violencefrom

a barroom brawl to a global warit can take other forms.

Political maneuvering, commercial trade, and acquisition

of knowledge are all tools of human aggression. In her own

way, a scheming merchant guildmaster is just as aggressive

as a cavalry captain. She doesnt just want to enrich her

guild, she wants to impoverish her rivals in the process.

As  a  result  of  this  aggression,  other  races  are  often

wary when dealing with humans. Nonhuman diplomats

everywhere know the aggressive human mentality and are

mindful that humans may push too hard or immediately

make war to get what they want.

FOCUS ON THE FUTURE

Of  all  the  races  in  the  world,  humans  are  the  most  for-

ward-thinking.  They  spend  less  time  looking  back  and

remembering  the  past,  and  more  time  imagining  the

future.

For example, a dwarf might undertake an adventure to

prove himself worthy to his ancestors (past focus). A half-

ling might adventure so she can revel in the excitement of

the moment (present focus). But a human will adventure

to earn a knighthood and thus a better life for himself and

his children (future focus).

While most other races focus on preserving their way of

life in the face of the worlds dangers, humans actively try

to improve their way of life, both in the short term and for

generations to come. Satisfaction is eeting for a human;

theres always another mountain to climb, another castle

to build, or another land to conquer.

ADAPTABILITY AND VARIETY

Humans  respond  well  to  new  beliefs  and  schools  of

thought,  including  magic  and  technology,  although

repressive human societies may hinder the spread of such

advances (probably to keep them in the hands of the elite).

Humans respond to catastrophe with remarkable exibility

and can bounce back from severe problems with a speed

that amazes some of the other races.

Because  theyre  condent  of  their  ability  to  adapt,

humans naturally seek out challenges that other races nd

daunting.  A  middle-aged  human  scribe  might  purchase

farmland on the frontier and learn to farm, leaving his old

livelihood  and  community  behind.  Then,  when  bandits

threaten his homestead, the new farmer will take up arms

himself and train his children to do the same.

One manifestation of this adaptability is humans accep-

tance of people who act and behave differently from them.

Because theres so much variety from human to human,

its easy for humans to be accepting of nonhuman variety

as well. Humans have to deal with each other all the time,

so its not too much of a stretch for a human to deal with a

dwarf, an elf, or some more exotic creature.

Another  aspect  of  human  adaptability  is  that  a  given

human  behaves  differently  from  day  to  day,  so  humans

are comfortable with changing their own behaviors and

personality traits. The happy-go-lucky minstrel you meet

in the spring might be morose in the summer after a friend

dies, then full of wrath and vengeance in the autumn when

he nds his friends murderer.

The variety of human existence naturally pulls human

personalities in different directions. For example, humans

crave having their own voice and standing out from the

crowd, but they also have a tendency to follow the herd

and adhere to the status quo. An individual human who

strives to break from the mold can later become a defender

of the status quoor can defend some aspects of the status

quo  while  advocating  radical  change  in  other  aspects.

Because of this inner conict, humans as a race are decid-

edly neutral in alignment.

HUMAN BEHAVIOR

No one can easily explain why humans in the D&D game

behave the way they do (just as there arent easy explana-

tions for real-world human behavior). But the game world

does  have  some  particular  inuences  that  help  explain

how  humans  wound  up  so  ambitious,  adaptable,  and

aggressive.

Because of their relatively short lives, humans try to t

as much as possible into the time they have, which helps

explain their zeal and vibrancy. Elves and dwarves have

centuries  to  contemplate  their  place  in  the  world,  but  a

human  probably  has  a  career  in  mind  by  age  15  and  is

raising the next generation by age 25.

The short human life span also means that fewer genera-

tions of humanity are alive at one time. A 50-year-old elf

probably  has  living  great-great-great-grandparents,  but  a

50-year-old human might not have living parents anymore.

Theres more variety in human personality because there

isnt the weight of generations to inuence behavior and

personality.

Humans  also  live  in  more  turbulent  societies  than

other  races.  Human  empires  are  always  emerging  and

collapsing; even a well-established human nation might

be younger than an individual dwarf or elf. The rise and

fall  of  nations  means  that  every  human  generation  is

touched by a revolution, war, or other calamity. Humans

thus take less for granted; they assume that the world will

change under their feet, and they employ their ambition,

adaptability, and aggression to control (or at least survive)

the changes.

Because humans are competitive by nature and require

a great deal of territory, they are constantly brushing up

against  nonhuman  lands.  This  expansion  often  leads  to

conict, and many humans have a siege mentality when

it comes to lands beyond their borders. Again, adaptability

and  aggression  are  the  two  mechanisms  humans  have

developed to get along in such a dangerous world.

Climate and geography also shape human psychology.

A group of humans who live on the frozen tundra, hunt-

ing large game as their primary source of food, views the

world in a much different light from an agrarian society

living in warm, hilly terrain. The tundra hunters rely on

each other for survival and probably dene themselves in

terms of their tribe: I am Shauseh of the Redfang tribe.

But the farmers are rooted in a specic place and might

dene  themselves  in  terms  of  their  occupation  (I  am

Ruthvek the barley farmer) or geographic location (I am

Ruthvek of the Three Hills province).

HUMAN LIFE

Its impossible to quantify the variety of human lifestyles

in a few paragraphs. While the other standard races have a

unifying culture (even if some communities deviate from

that culture), humans vary wildly in the ways that they live

and express themselves. However, the common threads of

human behavior lead to some general trends in how they

live their lives.

When you invent human societies for your D&D game,

consider  the  following  points.  By  emphasizing  specic

parts of a human lifestyle, borrowing ideas from real-world

humans,  and  employing  your  own  inventions,  you  can

create  human  characters  for  your  game  who  have  rich,

fascinating lifestyles.

LEISURE

Humans are hardworking people who throw themselves

fully  into  whatever  they  are  involved  in.  However,  they

also crave leisure time and often complain that they simply

dont have the time to relax as much as they want. Humans

work hard, but they play just as hard.

Like everything else in their lives, what humans consider

leisure can vary from region to region and person to person.

One human society might esteem calligraphy and poetry

as leisure activities, while the humans in the nation across

the river spend their free time dancing and drumming.

Even within the same society, members of different social

classes do different things with their time away from work

and family chores. A human noble might hunt stags, while

a human blacksmith spends his spare time arm-wrestling

in the local pub.

Performance Entertainment

Humans love talking: Storytelling, jokes, witty banter, for-

malized debate, and good old-fashioned gossip all combine

entertainment  with  communication.  Every  social  class

appreciates  dramatic  performances,  even  if  individuals

differ on specic matters of taste. Commoners tend to favor

bawdier, more sensational fare, while the upper class prefers

more rareed and philosophical diversions.

Bards, orators, actors, and poets are integral parts of any

human  community,  but  the  entertainer  doesnt  always

receive the same respect that the entertainment itself does.

In some places a modicum of poetic skill is part and parcel

of being a noble, while in other lands such entertainers are

lower-class citizens. Thus, a mediocre noble poet in one

land might receive more acclaim than his verse deserves,

while a visionary poet dies penniless someplace else.

Tastes and themes in entertainment change rapidly in

human society, and audiences are constantly hungry for

anything new and exotic. Performers from other lands and

of other races are particularly fascinating, so humans will

naturally ock to a gnome bards recital or a dwarf skald

who sings songs from his mountain home.

The availability of magic opens up new possibilities for

entertaining  performances.  Wizards  put  on  spectacular

shows  with  illusion  magic,  complete  with  sounds  and

smells. Gladiators who ght with spells rather than swords

can display their talents for the masses.

When an audience regards magic as just another eld of

endeavor, it wont be impressed by a simple prestidigitation

spell. In a magic-rich society, only magic that features an

element of artistry, grandeur, or mystery is entertaining

to most humans. If magic is uncommon or prohibitively

expensive, then only the privileged can see a spellcasting

artists work, and magical effects are more impressive to

those who witness them.

Competitive Sport

Humans  enjoy  athletics  of  all  kinds,  so  individual  and

team  sports  are  an  important  leisure  activity.  Humans

relish competition and enjoy contests that allow them to

test their skills and talents against others. Feats of speed,

endurance, and coordination are common, such as running,

swimming, wrestling, and horseback riding. In some com-

munities, humans intermingle their physical games with

martial training, creating t participants who can serve as

soldiers during wartime.

In evil societies, entertainment may turn toward violence

and decadence, including intentionally gruesome gladiato-

rial ghts, animal baiting, and other spectacles that rely on

humiliation and pain.

When  you  create  a  human  society  for  your  D&D

game, consider what competitive leisure activities it pre-

fersespecially if its sports involve skills or talents useful

to adventurers. The following competitions are found in

many human societies.

Horse  Racing  and  Charioteering:  Humans  have  a

greater  afnity  for  horses  than  members  of  other  races,

and many of their sports involve these animals.

At its simplest, a horse race is a series of opposed Ride

checks made once per round. Rather than have each horse

and rider move individually in initiative order, have each

rider in the race make a Ride check. The rider with the

highest result is in the lead, with other riders 5 feet back

for each 2 points their result is lower than the leaders (but

they go at least half the distance covered by the leader no

matter how low they roll). For example, if the leader gets

a 24 on her Ride check, a rider with a result of 23 would

be neck-and-neck with the leader (but slightly behind), a

rider with a 20 would be 10 feet behind, and a rider with

a 14 would be 25 feet behind. The lead horse travels four

times its speed on a straightaway and twice its speed if it

has to turn.

When you use this system to resolve a horse race, assume

that the competitors are successfully taking the spur mount

action discussed in the Ride skill description on page 80

of the Players Handbook. If a racer doesnt want to spur his

or her mount, simply assess a 4 penalty on Ride checks

during the race.

While  some  horse  races  take  place  on  fairly  smooth

tracks, its common to include jumps or other obstacles.

Use the leap rules in the Ride skill description to resolve

jumps over obstacles. Racers who fall end their movement

for that round. In the following round, a fallen rider must

stand up (a move action), then attempt a fast mount (as per

the Ride description) or spend a move action to remount

the horse.

Chariot races function similarly to horse races, except

that Profession (teamster) is the relevant skill. Leaping is

nearly impossible; any jumping DCs are tripled.

King  of  the  Ring:  This  game,  which  has  dozens  of

names, takes place in a 20-foot-radius circle. Two competi-

tors begin a match by standing at opposite edges of the

circle, then running toward one another and attempting

to bull rush their rival back outside the circles boundary.

Both  competitors  make  bull  rush  attempts  each  round,

except that neither side can make attacks of opportunity

(unarmed attacks and grappling are against the rules).

A common variant of King of the Ring has more than

two competitors at a time, with the winner being the last

person  remaining  inside  the  ring.  Another  version  of

the  game  involves  varying  the  terrain,  with  contestants

trying to push each other off a log, out of a pond, or off a

hillock.

Gambling:  Humans  love  to  wager  and  will  bet  on

almost anything given the chance. Gambling can come

in  many  forms,  from  cards,  dice,  and  other  games  of

chance, to betting on the outcome of horse racing,  ghting

tournaments, and the like. In lawful areas, particularly

those with strict moral codes, gambling is either frowned

upon or banned. In areas with looser laws and morality,

gambling is out in the open and may be an important part

of social interaction.

Gambling takes three forms. First, humans often bet on

the outcome of someone elses efforts, such as wagering on

a horse race.

Second,  the  gamblers  themselves  may  participate  in

a  game  that  incorporates  both  skill  and  chance.  Most

card games fall into this category. To resolve this sort of

gambling, have the participants make a skill check every

10 minutes. The relevant skill is Profession (card gambler)

for most card games and another Profession skill for games

you  invent  yourself.  The  competitor  with  the  highest

check result wins an amount set by the DM: a typical pot

for  10  minutes  of  play,  depending  on  the  wealth  of  the

competitors and the circumstances of the game. The losing

competitors lose as much as the winner receives, divided

among themselves. In a  ve-person card game, for example,

the winner might get 20 silver pieces after 10 minutes of

Humans relax after a hard day

play, and each of the other four players would lose 5 silver

pieces.

Competitors can employ other skills to improve their

chances.  If  the  game  rewards  blufng  and  concealed

motives, a Bluff check thats higher than everyone elses

Sense Motive check earns the bluffer a bonus on his Profes-

sion check equal to the difference between his Bluff result

and the highest Sense Motive result. If the game involves

easily palmed tokens such as playing cards, a competitor

can cheat by making a Sleight of Hand check opposed by

all the other players Spot checks. A successful Sleight of

Hand check earns a bonus equal to the difference between

the Sleight of Hand result and the highest Spot result. But

unlike blufng at cards, theres generally a game-ending

consequence for failing this Sleight of Hand check: youve

been caught cheating.

The third form of gambling encompasses games of pure

chance,  such  as  roulette  or  simple  dice  games.  Because

theres  no  skill  involved,  resolve  this  sort  of  gambling

by  rolling  the  relevant  dice  (if  its  a  game  like  craps)  or

by assigning a percentage chance of success and rolling

percentile dice (if its roulette or a similar game of chance

that doesnt involve dice).

If you design a scenario involving gambling, make sure

that  PCs  cant  come  out  ahead  simply  by  wagering  on

multiple outcomes. For example, betting on both horses

in a race shouldnt make for a sure prot, and always bet-

ting black on a roulette wheel should result in the gradual

diminishing of a players stake. Make sure that the wagering

authority (the house) has a small but signicant percent-

age advantage.

Other  Games:  Complete  Warrior  has  information  on

jousting and gladiator battles, two other common forms

of competition in human lands.

Roleplaying Application: Decide what your characters

attitude is toward leisure in generalwhether its wasteful

frivolity or a well-earned reward for hard work. Then con-

sider what kinds of leisure your character especially likes

or dislikes, looking at your abilities and skills for guidance.

Brawny characters with the Improved Bull Rush feat would

naturally gravitate toward King of the Ring as participants,

and King of the Ring might also make a particularly good

spectator sport for a low-Strength character who nds the

display of might particularly impressive.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Every human society has its own artistic style and methods

for  expressing  it.  Human  art  covers  the  entire  range  of

expression, from realistic to abstract, and the other races

are often amazed at the artistic works that humans come

up with.

Some  human  cultures  prefer  a  stark,  spare  form  that

implies more than it shows, while others go for a much

more ornate, baroque style. Humans also borrow heavily

from other cultures, especially those nearby. A group of

humans living along the edge of a large forest inhabited

by elves and gnomes may ll their art with nature-related

themes  and  softer,  more  natural  colors.  Humans  living

near dwarves might favor earth tones and intricately carved

stonework.

Art Is Everywhere

Humans  practice  all  forms  of  art:  painting,  sculpture,

music, and a hundred other forms of artistic expression.

Although dwarves produce ne sculptures and physical

objects,  gnomes  create  the  funniest  jokes  and  fables,

and elves compose the most haunting music and poetry,

humans have, at one time or another, created individual

works that have outdone all these other races.

In places where humans struggle just to survive, artistic

talent  takes  a  back  seat  to  more  prosaic  concerns,    and

individuals  with  a  air  for  creation  either  let  it  atrophy

or  channel  it  into  a  craft  that  allows  them  to  express

themselves while doing something useful. Many a bas-

ketweaver, blacksmith, or potter has an artistic bent and

includes decorative ourishes in the everyday items he or

she makes.

The  combination  of  utility  and  artistry  means  that

humans decorate nearly everything, from the hem on a

dress, to the handle of a wooden spoon, to the wall of the

hut where they live. Other races channel their artists in a

specic direction (the gnomes love of gemcutting is a good

example). But human artists like to adapt something, even

if its a completely mundane object, and make it serve an

artistic, decorative function.

Art and Wealth

Regardless of their social class, humans enjoy beautiful art

and do what they can to embellish decorative objects such

as nice clothing and jewelry. Even the poorest humans use

small bits of homemade jewelry or embroidery on their

clothing.  The  higher  the  social  status  of  a  human,  the

greater his or her access to art. A rich and powerful human

has dozens of clothing choices, wears multiple pieces of

precious jewelry, and lives in a home where paintings hang

on every wall. Among humans, art isnt enjoyed just for its

own sakeits a symbol of social status.

Art winds up in the hands of the wealthy and powerful

because  both  skilled  artists  and  the  materials  they  use

(such as gold, rare pigments, and ne silks) are often scarce.

While all humans appreciate art to a degree, only a few

actually produce it. The average human is not artistically

inclined and leaves the creation of artwork to artists and

bards. With relatively few humans creating art, the short

supply of it is snatched up by the upper classes.

Art is a status symbol, but that doesnt necessarily mean

that artists themselves have high social status. Just as the

social status of performers varies among human cultures,

so too does the status of painters, writers, and other artists.

Some  societies  revere  their  artists  and  accord  them  an

1

elevated status, while others consider them second-class

citizens and parasites that are too lazy to do real work.

The Life of an Artisan

While most humans know at least a little about woodcraft,

pottery, sewing, and other common disciplines, true mas-

tery requires years of intense labor and study.

To  become  an  artisan,  a  human  child  begins  as  an

apprentice  to  a  more  experienced  adult.  His  education

includes years spent doing mundane chores for the master

artisan, such as fetching water, preparing raw materials,

and cleaning the workshop. Those apprentices who can

get through these formative years are eventually taught

the  basics  of  their  trade.  After  a  few  more  years,  if  an

apprentice shows promise and talent, he is then named

a journeyman and can set off on his own to establish his

name and reputation.

Roleplaying Application: Think about what forms of

art and decoration your character appreciates, especially

when it comes to assessing the value of a treasure hoard

or buying new equipment. When your character becomes

wealthy (as most do), decide what forms of art he or she

will enjoy and display.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

As the most adaptable and innovative of the races, humans

are proli c creators of new ideas and items, whether magical

or technological.

Humans blend a knack for experimentation with a  ne

balance of time-tested methods and intuitive leaps. They

borrow  heavily  from  other  races  and  cultures,  taking

something  that  was  already  created,  then  expanding

and improving on it to create an item never seen before.

Future-focused humans are unlikely to say, We cant try

it because no ones ever done it that way. Humans rarely

rest on their laurels after a major discovery and often use

their discoveries to fuel research into even more radical

ideas.

Travelers, Builders, and Traders

Human strides in technology run the gamut from exotic

weapons  to  advanced  pottery  techniques.  They  are

particularly  adept  in  two  areas:  shipbuilding  and  castle

construction. Humans have also applied their inventive

nature to a third area of technical expertise:  nance and

commercial matters.

The  drive  to  explore  and  expand  often  leads  humans

to the ocean shoreand beyond. More so than those of

other  races,  humans  build  a  dizzying  array  of  seafaring

craft, from heavy barges to sleek sailing ships to the long-

ships and galleys that make up their navies. Ships enable

humans to extend their reach to new lands, and they also

make  long-distance  commerce  more  practical.  Humans

arent  just  good  shipbuilders,  thoughthey  have  also

mastered navigating the open ocean using both magical

and astronomical means.

While no one matches the dwarves ability to construct

underground fortresses, the best aboveground strongholds

are of human manufacture. The crenellated walls and high

towers that characterize a human castle require mastery

of  architecture,  stonemasonry,  and  the  sheer  logistical

challenge of moving the raw materials to the building site.

In every aspect of castle constructionsize, strength, and

speedhumans are the leaders.

The  third  area  in  which  humans  enjoy  unparalleled

expertise is nance. Humans have an innate understanding

of  mercantile  matters  and  have  developed  sophisticated

techniques to track and account for wealth. Powerful trade

guilds, complex tax structures, and stock ownership are

human  innovations  that  come  into  play  whenever  a  lot

of  money  is  at  stake.  A  haling  trade  caravan  typically

splits its prots equally after it makes a sale at its destina-

tionsimple enough. But a human trade caravan probably

has investors who receive prots according to their per-

centage of ownership, after the caravan pays wages for the

guards, commissions for the negotiators, tariffs for one or

more trade guilds, interest on the loans that nanced the

journey, and taxes to one or more governments. A simple

human  merchant  doesnt  have  to  worry  about  this  sort

of complexity, but its a fact of life on the more lucrative

caravan routes.

Magic

Elves have an afnity for arcane magic, and many extra-

planar  races  have  a  closer  connection  to  the  divine,  but

humans have access to magic whatever its source. As with

other  tools,  humans  adapt  divine  and  arcane  magic  to

further their ambitions, whether noble or craven.

Divine magic is an expression of human diversity and

human energyspecically, the humans drive to emulate

the deities themselves. Humans regard divine magic as a

tool to be used both for self-improvement and to advance

a deitys cause on the Material Plane.

Humans have a practical attitude toward divine magic.

When a cleric casts a spell, its not just an act of devotion

to  the  deity  who  provides  the  divine  power  behind  the

spellits also a tool that advances the ambitions of the

caster. Its signicant that the two gods who have ascended

to divinity within living memory, Vecna and St. Cuthbert,

were once both human. They represent the ultimate ambi-

tion of the human divine spellcaster: to use divine magic

to make oneself more divine.

Clerics often act as the backbone of a community, even

if that community cant agree on which god to worship.

Humans are a race with multiple faiths and views of the uni-

verse, so disagreements and even open warfare can result

between clerics who cant agree on whose god is best. Most

other races have a single deity devoted to the protection

and advancement of that race: Corellon Larethian for the

elves, Yondalla for the halings, and so on. Humans dont

have such a deity (although Zarus, described below, could

become  such  a  deity),  instead  dividing  their  allegiance

among gods of every alignment and concern.

A divine spellcasters place in society depends almost

entirely on which god she worships. The high priest in a

theocracy might be the pinnacle of the social order, but

the cleric of an unpopular or outlawed god might have to

hide her allegiance, administering her faith to a secret cult

of like-minded worshipers.

Arcane spellcasters, on the other hand, are almost always

in the middle or upper class of human society, because they

have either the sorcerers force of personality or the wizards

reasoning and intellectual prowess. Only in human societ-

ies with little social mobility do arcane spellcasters remain

in the lower class for long.

Human sorcerers stand out from the crowd as vibrant,

charismatic individuals with a air for the magical arts.

Societies that have a close relationship with local dragons

revere sorcerers as beings of true power and respect. In

tyrannical societies, sorcerers stand out like bright lights

in a dim room whether theyre part of the ruling class or

leaders of a restive underclass. If they live in a land where

arcane power is a liability, sorcerers use their social skills

(and the fact that they arent carrying a spellbook around

all  the  time)  to  conceal  their  powers  from  their  fellow

humans.

Wizards  tend  to  ock  together  in  human  societies,

sharing magical knowledge and the results of their arcane

research with each other. Humans regard wizardry as an

academic discipline, so most would-be wizards learn the

secrets of arcane power at magical colleges. These schools

also become repositories of knowledge and wisdom and

may double as mundane colleges for those who do not have

magical skill. Its also common for humans to view wiz-

ardry as a skilled trade, so magical knowledge propagates

through the apprenticemaster relationships that govern

other trades.

Varied Attitudes Toward Magic

Humans, the most innovative of spellcasters, can also be

among the most superstitious. In societies where magic

is rare, superstition and fear concerning spellcasters are

particularly acute. Due to a subconscious jealousy of power,

humans from lower social classes sometimes view power-

ful magic with awe and suspicion, especially if its arcane

magic or an effect they havent seen before.

In  lands  where  magic  is  routine,  human  spellcasters

live  well,  providing  the  people  with  ways  to  ease  their

daily burdens . A wizard isnt a purveyor of black magic,

just  another  artisan  to  be  employed  when  needed.  But

humans respect power (and generally want more of it for

themselves), so they are wise enough to treat spellcasters

of any ilk with a modicum of respect.

Roleplaying  Application:  Over  the  course  of  your

adventuring  career,  youll  undoubtedly  see  mechanical

devices and strange magic undreamed of by most humans.

How you react to these sights says a lot about your human

nature. Its normal to be wary of powerful technology or

magic, but a humans ambition and adaptiveness often lead

to curiosity about the mysterious and newwhether that

curiosity is healthy or not.

For example, an elf might bring a mysterious artifact back

to elf loremasters for study, and a dwarf might bring the

artifact to his clan chief for wise consideration of its fate,

but a human might start experimenting with the artifact

right away and is almost certainly scheming about how to

best put the artifact to use.

HUMANS AT WAR

Humans are infamous for being a warlike race. Many of the

most horri c and devastating wars are the result of human

aggression, often directed against other humans. Whenever

humans are pioneers in magic and technology, its often

because they seek an edge on the battle eld.

Military  readiness  and  organization  varies  widely

from one human society to another. Some societies are

extremely  militant  and  organized,  with  large  standing

armies  that  are  disciplined  and  well  equipped.  Other

humans wage war in a ragtag, chaotic fashion, charging

into combat with little regard for safety or cohesion. Either

way, humans are a force to be reckoned with, if for no other

reason than their sheer numbers and instinct for survival.

Humans arent fearsome combatants individually, but they

 ght with tenacity and often show brilliance on the battle-

 eld. Human societies sometimes go to war collectively,

as an entire nation mobilizes for an offensive crusade or

a defensive effort. When humans go to war, they do so in

the thousands.

At  an  early  age,  young  humans  learn  how  to  handle

at  least  one  weapon,  even  if  its  just  a  knife  or  a  farm

implement  they  use  every  day.  Humans  living  near  the

wilderness are typically also handy with a crossbow, sling,

or other ranged weapon used to hunt game. Humans know

that war can erupt wherever they live, so theyre often ready

when marauding bandits assault their village or a hostile

army besieges their city. Other races remark how human

lands are dotted with fortresses even no hostile borders lie

within hundreds of miles.

Human Armies

Human armies tend to have more different kinds of soldiers

and more special-purpose units than armies of other races.

Humans often create mixed units in which a spellcaster

or  two  provides  support  for  a  dozen  melee  combatants.

Every character class has its place in a human army, from

bards who use trumpet fanfares to inspire their comrades,

When a human army marches, foes had better take notice

13

to clerics prepared with healing magic, to wizard snipers

that use magic missiles to harry enemy ofcers.

While  older  races  often  have  army  units  whose  com-

position  is  set  by  centuries  of  tradition,  human  armies

will change in composition to better ght their enemies.

A human army facing a skeleton horde, for example, will

recruit every good-aligned cleric it can nd and have its

blacksmiths work overtime to supply soldiers with blud-

geoning maces.

Life in the Army

Humans  who  show  talent  for  ghting  get  willingly

recruited or unwillingly conscripted into their societys

army. In many human societies, the law requires at least

a brief term of service in the sovereigns ghting force. In

others, would-be soldiers may have to compete for the right

to join the army, especially its elite units.

In  a  strong,  organized  army,  the  soldiers  life  may  be

considerably better than the average commoners. A soldier

gets regular meals, shelter, clothing, and at least a few coins

in wagesall things a commoner must struggle for. But

the downside is obvious: a risk of death, and certainly a

separation from family and community.

More chaotic human societies may not keep a standing

army. The society expects its members to know how to ght

and to rise to the occasion when called. Glory derived from

success in battle is a major social benet in such societies,

because your friends and neighbors have seen your prowess

on the battleeld rsthand.

Human Military Tactics

Human generals are quick to adapt to changing circum-

stances, and most would rather attack than defend. They

display the same traits as humans in other elds: tenacity,

inventiveness, and ambition.

The variety within human culture and society leads to a

wide array of military units, but a couple of military tactics

typify  human  armies:  the  extensive  use  of  cavalry,  and

constructing and destroying aboveground fortications.

Cavalry: Humans have a relationship with horses that

stretches back beyond their oldest history books. And as

long as humans have had horses, humans have ridden them

into battle.

Human generals particularly prize the mounted knight,

because the knight minimizes human weaknesses while

accentuating human strengths. An individual human is

relatively fragile on a D&D battleeld but becomes a lot

tougher once encased in armor and attached to a 1,000-

pound ghting animal. The speed of a horse gives a human

general the ability to react quickly to a changing situation

on the battleeld. Thus, a unit of knights improves the

whole  armys  adaptivitya  key  human  trait  in  war  or

peace.

Fortresses:  Other  races  (especially  gnomes)  remark

that  humans  are  never  at  peace;  theyre  always  waging

war or preparing for war. One reason for this attitude is

the human castles that dominate the landscape and the

walls that surround almost every human settlement of

any size.

A  network  of  well-stocked  castles  is  essential  to  the

administration of any human nation. A human army must

garrison  its  own  lands  to  guard  against  incursions  by

bandits, rebels, and anyone else seeking to thwart the will

of the lands rulers. No army can be everywhere at once,

of course, but strategically placed castles can provide safe

storage for provisions and other supplies the army needs

when it arrives on the scene. A castle also serves as a vis-

ible symbol of the ruling authority and what it represents:

protection in a dangerous world.

Sieges:  For  every  army  encamped  within  a  fortress,

another army is surrounding it, trying to knock down the

walls  or  starve  the  defenders  into  submission.  Humans

incorporate siege engines such as catapults and battering

rams into their war plans, and theyll surely bombard the

walls of a stronghold theyre besieging. But if the armies

are  evenly  matched,  a  stalemate  often  results  while  the

invading army tries to starve out the defenders. In such a

situation, a war between human armies can last for years

or  even  decadesan  exceedingly  long  time,  given  the

relatively short human life span.

Fortresses and sieges are both central to humans at war,

because warfare is all about control of territory. Humans

are ambitious and expansionist, so they regard warfare as

an effective way of acquiring territory or defending it from

the predations of others.

Adventure Seed: Dealing with a besieged castle can be

an exciting adventure, no matter what side of the ght the

PCs are on. Characters defending the castle might have to

sneak out to disrupt the invaders, or creep through enemy

lines while transporting critical provisions and supplies.

PCs working with an invading army can use magic, stealth,

or  subterfuge  to  sneak  into  a  castle  and  cause  mayhem

within while the army attacks from without.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Human societies exhibit the same psychological traits that

individual humans dothey tend to be ambitious, adapt-

able,  and  aggressive.  Some  traits  are  stronger  in  a  given

society than others, of course. A fantasy culture inspired

by the Vikings might be quite aggressive but harbor no

societywide ambitions beyond living to plunder again next

year. One inspired by the ancient Egyptians might work

to build great monuments and be the dominant culture

of its time, but might have a hard time coping with the

inevitable change of historys turning pages.

SOCIETYS DRIVE TO ORGANIZE

Human societies thrive on organization, perhaps because

its  the  only  way  to  keep  such  a  varied  people  under

1

S

N

A

14

control. A haling or a gnome might  enjoy cataloging

a  personal  collection  for  the  personal  satisfaction  that

organization provides. But human societies regard orga-

nization as a means to an end: a more productive, efcient

community.

Take  city  streets  as  an  example.  In  human  cities,  the

streets are straight whenever possible, intersecting with

others to form a grid pattern. Elves regard a grid layout as

unimaginative, and their communities often have winding

roads that encourage contemplation of the natural world.

The  underground  cities  of  the  dwarves  have  a  regular

network of tunnels them, because the dwarves nd regular

patterns to be inherently pleasing.

Humans save their creativity for other aspects of their

lives, however, and they dont necessarily like a street grid

for  aesthetic  reasons.  They  like  a  straight  grid  of  roads

because  the  grid  makes  travel  across  the  city  faster  and

because its easier to assign addresses and give directions if

the roads follow a predictable pattern. In other words, the

organization is just a means to the end of societal efcency

and progress.

Most tellingly, when the landscape does not allow for

straight roads, humanity forces the landscape into shape,

bending the world to the societys will. Others call this

arrogance, but humans call it progress.

SOCIAL CLASS

A  fundamental  tenet  of  human  society  is  social  class,

which is a manifestation of the human drive to organize.

Some  societies  offer  more  class  mobility  than  others.

Societies  that  esteem  battleeld  prowess,  artistic  skill,

and mercantile wealth tend to have more turnover in the

upper classes than societies in which social standing is a

matter of birth and lineage. Some human cultures have

a greater gulf between the upper and lower classes than

others. The nobles in a decadent, imperial society probably

talk, walk, and act completely differently from the lower-

class  untouchables  they  ignore.  In  a  frontier  society,

however, the landowning baron is only marginally better

off than the military captain, the skilled blacksmith, or

the local priest.

No matter how a societys social classes are organized,

humans from that society know the means for social climb-

ing and what sorts of failure result in a fall from social grace.

Even in societies where individual merit doesnt result in

social promotion, parents can always hope their children

marry well and rise through societys ranks.

Roleplaying Application: Because human society is

keenly aware of social class, consider what your familys

social  status  was  during  your  childhood.  Once  your

adventuring career begins, you can dress and act like a

member of whatever social class you wishand if you

survive your rst few adventures, youll probably be rich

compared to most other humans. But whether youre an

alley kid who resents the airs of nobility or a royal scion

determined to live like one of the people, your social

class has a major impact on how you see the world and

how others treat you.

In the real world, having a high socioeconomic status has

natural advantages. But in the D&D world, being from the

upper class doesnt prepare a human for an adventurers life

any better than a lower-class upbringing. When an upper-

class child is learning courteous behavior and elaborate

social customs, her lower-class counterpart is getting into

ghts in alleys and picking pockets in the bazaar square.

Each child learns something potentially useful, but neither

skill set is inherently better than the other. Upper-class

youths  have  more  access  to  education  (especially  about

magical matters), but lower-class youths deal with rigors

and dangers similar to those faced by full-grown adventur-

ers. Social class guides what kind of preparation youve had

for an adventurers life, but it doesnt provide you with a

greater or lesser degree of preparation.

THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY

The immediate familytwo parents and their childrenis

the building block of most human societies. The familys

branches extend to include grandparents and cousins, and

in many places humans live in large tribes. Nevertheless,

humans  have  an  innate  respect  for  the  bond  between

siblings and between parent and child. The typical human

places  the  welfare  of  his  immediate  family  over  that  of

anyone else, even other relatives.

This focus on the immediate family is one consequence

of human mobility and expansion. Humans relocate often,

and they dont usually bring their entire extended family

with them. Dwarves and elves, on the other hand, settle in

one place and live there for centuries, so the community

eventually becomes one extended family.

The short human life span also places greater emphasis

on  the  immediate  family.  Because  only  a  few  genera-

tions of humans are alive at one time, the ties between

one generation and the next are particularly strong. A

human simply cant have the sort of bond with a great-

grandparent  thats  routine  among  the  dwarves,  for

example, because that great-grandparent might not live

long enough to see the childs birth and almost certainly

wont be around long enough for the great-grandchild to

reach adulthood.

In human families, parents expect at least some of their

children  to  follow  in  their  career  footsteps.  Children

apprentice themselves to a parent skilled in a trade, learn-

ing  the  family  business  throughout  childhood.  In  farm

families,  children  gradually  do  more  and  more  chores

around the homestead until theyre accomplished farmers

themselves.

Because human couples often have more than one child,

not everyone can inherit the family business, and the family

farm can be divided into only so many pieces. The oldest

children usually have precedence in matters of inheritance,

H

A

a custom that tends to drive younger siblings away from

home and into other organizations such as religion and

the military.

While many human parents train their children in the

family livelihood, some encourage their offspring to seek

new and better opportunities. If a man is a butcher but

his son wants to become a blacksmith, the father often

supports that desire. Blacksmiths have more community

respect  and  make  more  money  than  butchers,  after  all.

As  long  as  his  children  earn  respect  and  a  good  living,

a parent can easily forgive a child for leaving the family

occupation behind.

Roleplaying  Application:  Give  some  thought  to  the

members  of  your  immediate  family.  You  dont  have  to

write down a whole family tree before you pick up that

twenty-sider, but if you establish the tenor of a few family

relationships, your character will be the richer for it. Mama

didnt raise no dummies, your character might

say after doing something particularly clever.

You might hate wearing leather because your

father was a tanner and you hated the smell of

the tanning process. Imagine what your family life

was like, what your family members are doing now,

and how they feel about your undertaking the life

of an adventurer.

RELYING LESS

ON TRADITION

Human social customs tend to be more com-

munity-based than individual-based. An elf,

for example, remembers being involved in or

affected by a war against the orcs that happened

centuries  ago  and  doesnt  need  a  particular

holiday or ceremony to mark the occasion. But humans

do not live that long. Instead, they pass on their traditions

to  their  children  and  disseminate  them  throughout  the

community. Thus, a human village might celebrate Orc

Surrender  Day  long  after  the  participants  in  the  battle

have died.

Humans  use  societal  traditions  as  a  sort  of  memory

bank that records their history, with individuals remem-

bering  the  important  deeds  of  the  past  and  passing

the stories on. Because no living human performed or

experienced those deeds, the traditions based on them

dont have the same impact. A dwarf bard might fondly

recall  the  epic  he  wrote  for  the  king  decades  ago.  A

human, on the other hand, takes pride in the song his

grandfather wrote for the queen, but he wont waste an

afternoon thinking about it, and he strives to write even

better  songs.  The  individual,  present-day  creation  of  a

new song adds to his familys prestige and proves that

hes a better songwriter than his ancestors were. For a

human composer, his new song has far more merit than

an old song his grandfather wrote.

HUMANS AND

OTHER RACES

Because  of  their  ability  to  thrive  in  almost  any  climate

and terrain, humans often nd themselves coming into

contact with other races, whether they are wanted or not.

Some  human  societies  see  their  nonhuman  neighbors

as  allies,  trading  partners,  or  someone  to  ignore.  Other

nations may see nonhumans as subjects to be conquered

or strangers to be feared.

Dwarves: Humans look up to the stalwart traditions,

deep convictions, and dedication to family and honor that

are central to the dwarves outlook. A dwarfs martial skills

and  beautiful  stonecraft  are  also  worthy  of  admiration.

While  human  and  dwarf  communities  dont  always  see

eye to eye, the two races have always been allies, or at least

cordial neighbors.

Humans who live close to a dwarf stronghold some-

times model their society after the dwarves, which can

bring great joy and pride to the dwarven heart. Still, the

relatively  freewheeling  spirit  of  humans  runs  counter

to the slower-paced culture of dwarves; humans seem

ighty and impatient.

Elves:  Much  of  humanity  considers  elves  to  be

idealized  humans:  hauntingly  beautiful  beings  in

touch with their own inner power. Humans admire

the sheer beauty in everything that elves do, say, or

produce, but they have a hard time understand-

ing the long-range foresight of elves, and many

wrongly believe that elves are indifferent to the

plights of the world.

Humans who live close to elf communities may

prefer  the  smooth  patois  of  Elven  over  their  own

crude-sounding language and may dress in the comfort-

able elven style. Elves regard such efforts with a mixture

of paternal satisfaction and bemusement.

Goliaths:  Most  humans  nd  the  hulking  goliaths

(described in Races of Stone) to be more than a little fright-

ening.  A  goliaths  close  resemblance  to  a  giant  (albeit  a

smaller  one)  triggers  a  humans  primal  fear  of  similar

creatures  such  as  ogres  and  trolls.  Some  closed-minded

humans refuse to consider that goliaths and giants might

be different. Many humans operate from the assumption

of a stereotypelarge equals dumband treat goliaths

accordingly.

Some mountain-dwelling humans have overcome their

fear of these gentle beings and have forged close relation-

ships  with  goliaths,  including  limited  trade  agreements

and pacts of mutual assistance against common foes.

Gnomes: Humans have a rather patronizing though

cordial  view  of  gnomes,  whom  they  regard  as  being

comical and more than a bit silly. Their initial exposure

to gnome humor delights most humans, but they quickly

become  annoyed  when  the  smaller  beings  do  not  let

up  with  their  incessant  pranks.  However,  the  gnomes

1

capacity for working with magic and technology amazes

humans,  who  go  to  great  lengths  to  obtain  both  skills

from gnomes.

Humans dwelling in the same hills and forests as gnomes

nd them to be ne neighbors that are willing to help out

with common problems.

Half-Elves: To humans, half-elves are only marginally

less aloof than elves and seem to possess the same eerie

grace that humans nd both intriguing and a bit difcult

to comprehend. Humans tend to treat half-elves as they

would treat elves, but a little more kindly as they remind

themselves, Hey, this guy is half-human, too.

In areas where elves and humans live together, half-elves

are far more common, and they gain more understanding

and  acceptance  from  humans,  who  view  them  as  ideal

mediators between the two races. Some half-elves thrive

in such a role and become an integral part of these com-

munities. Other half-elves chafe at always being treated

like theyre all elf or all human, so they get away from both

parent races as soon as possible.

Half-orcs:  In  most  places,  humans  and  orcs  have

engaged in violence for as long as anyone can remember.

Despite this animosity, orcs and humans have been known

to interbreed. In human lands, half-orcs are second-class

citizens, and few humans make an effort to see the human

side of such individuals. Humans lay the burden of proof

squarely  on  the  half-orc:  Prove  youre  better  than  an

orc.

In  those  rare  areas  where  humans  and  orcs  coexist

peacefully,  the  lot  of  a  half-orc  is  slightly  better.  Some

half-orcs hold high positions within human settlements

or act as liaisons between the two cultures.

In  purely  human  communities,  half-orcs  are  often

treated with scorn and derision, respected and feared only

for their strength and ferocity.

Halings: Since the two races have lived side by side

for thousands of years, most humans have a strong afnity

for  halings.  Humans  respect  halings  for  their  drive,

curiosity, and willingness to get along. The kinship is so

close  that  some  human  societies  prefer  living  alongside

halings to living alongside other human cultures.

Human and haling communities are sometimes inte-

grated  into  one  another,  and  many  human  cities  have  a

haling neighborhood where the smaller race can retain

a sense of cultural heritage.

Despite this peaceful coexistence, many humans retain

the impression that halings are whimsical or cute, much

to the dismay of these small folk. Over the years, halings

have learned either to tolerate such attitudes or to redouble

their efforts to act ercer than the big folk.

Illumians: The race of illumians (described in Chapter

3) is young even by human standards, so illumians remain

an enigma to the humans that surround them. Humans

who have lived among illumians say that the sigil-enhanced

race  is  a  lot  like  humanityif  anything,  theyre  more

ambitious, more adaptive, and more future-focused than

humans are.

RELIGION

Humans are both more religious and less religious than

members of the other races. They are less religious in that

many humans do not care about religion, and no deity can

claim the worship of more than a fraction of humanity.

Yet they are more religious in that their variety comfort-

ably supports dozens of faiths, each with adherents more

numerous than those of many nonhuman deities.

Less Religious: Humans drive and energy sometimes

get in the way of religious matters. Some humans are too

practical  or  too  busy  with  mundane  concerns  to  spend

time praying to a being they cannot see, have never met,

and  receive  nothing  from.  Humans  generally  demand

tangible assistance from a deitys church before they offer

their fealty in return. Humans naturally juggle multiple

allegiances (to family, to country, to community, and so

forth), and some just dont have room in their lives for a

religious relationship.

Another  barrier  that  keeps  humans  from  embracing

religion is that humans dont have a cohesive mythology and

a set pantheon. The dwarves know that Moradin fathered

them, and the gnomes know theyre the creation of Garl

Glittergold.  Humans  are  not  so  certain  of  their  origins,

and  no  major  deity  demands  their  exclusive  allegiance.

Some humans claim that Pelor is the greatest of the gods,

but  others worship Heironeous or Kord with equal fervor.

Because humanity has so many gods, no one deity can win

the allegiance of the entire race.

More Religious: Many humans are adaptable enough

to work all sorts of religious practices into their daily lives.

Once a bond between deity and human worshiper is estab-

lished, it quickly grows strong. Pelor says I have to get up

before dawn to pray to him, thinks the human. But Pelor

makes sure the elds around the city grow lots of wheat, so

its denitely worth it. In exchange for a benet, whether

tangible or intangible, a human is willing to change her

routine and follow the dictates of a particular religion.

Some humans do worship a deity in a profound and deep

way. In fact, those humans with faith are so staunch in their

convictions  that  their  singlemindedness  frightens  even

dwarves. After all, dwarves know Moradin is their ultimate

father, and that he watches over themits an obvious fact

that no one in dwarven culture would deny. But a deeply

religious human has chosen a deity from among dozens

of equally powerful gods, and she maintains that religious

allegiance  despite  being  surrounded  with  humans  who

dont agree with that choice.

HOW HUMANS WORSHIP

Religious humans tend to ascribe humanlike ambitions to

the gods they worship. Truly devout humans are convinced

that  their  chosen  god  is  the  greatest  deity  imaginable.

Most dwarves, for example, wouldnt bother arguing that

Moradin  is  greater  than  Pelor.  Moradin  is  simply  their

god, and the nondwarven gods are welcome to take care

of  nondwarven  concerns.  But  a  human  who  worships

Pelor might claim that the Shining One is the only deity

worthy of prayer, and that all other deities are

Pelors inferiors. Most humans have a sense that

if enough people worship a deity with

enough fervor, that deity will rule

all other, lesser deities.

The  ambitious  nature  of

human  religions  leads  to

con ict  and  war  when  a

religion  tries  to  man-

date worship or convert

new followers at sword-

point.  Humans  are

the only people who

 ght extensive reli-

gious  wars  among

themselves,  some-

thing  other  races

 nd both puzzling

and frightening.

Religion  has  a

positive in uence

on human society

as  well,  and  even

nonreligious

humans  regard

religious  hu-

mans  highly.

Because  they

have  access  to

a wide range of

helpful  magic,

clerics  receive

treat-

friendly

ment  from  most

humans.  Beyond

casting  spells  on  be-

half of the community, clerics

offer useful advice and mediate dis-

putes,  and  many  good-aligned  religions

feed the hungry and clothe the poor. Hu-

man  cities  have  temples  to  most  good  or

neutral deities, and towns often have small churches and

shrines for the major faiths.

Because humanity has dozens of gods, new deities some-

times appear and new religions take root in human culture.

Unlike those other races, humans believe it is possible for

someone to rise to sainthood and then to godhood, as St.

Cuthbert did. The two deities presented below have small

but growing churches behind them.

URBANUS

Lesser God (Neutral Good)

One of the newest human deities is Urbanus, the god of

cities. One day, in their dreams, the city planners began

seeing a strange  gure, a man with skin of brick and stone

and wood, eyes like windows, and a helm like the roof of a

building. This individual showed them designs

for new buildings, new streets, a com-

pletely new city layout. When each

of  the  planners  awoke,  he  re-

membered every detail of the

dream. Later, the men

shared their dreams,

and they were awed

to learn that each

dream  was  the

same.  The  city

was  built  fol-

lowing  the

n e w   d e -

signs,  and

the plan ners

dedicated  it

to this strange

visitor.

Since  then,

Urbanus  has  ap-

peared  in  every

large  human  set-

tlement.  He  visits

leading citizens in

their  dreams,  en-

couraging them to

improve  and  ex-

pand the city. He

also watches over cit-

ies,  protecting  them

and their inhabitants.

Urbanus appears as a

male human, middle-aged

and  digni ed.  His  skin  is

made of brick and stone and other

building materials. His eyes are windows. His

teeth are paving stones. His helmet (or perhaps

it is his hair) is a domed spire. When he speaks,

his voice sounds like wagon wheels and church

bells and water pumps. Urbanus is a god recently come

into existence, and has limited scopehe has no power

outside cities. Within them, however, his will is supreme.

Though  primarily  a  human  deity,  Urbanus  accepts  the

worship of anyone who lives in a city.

tion.

Cleric Training: Urbanus  nds his own clerics, appear-

ing to them in their dreams. He selects people who live in

cities and love them, people who want to make their city

safer and cleaner and a nicer place to live. Urbanus sends

these people to his priests, who teach them familiarity with

every inch of the city and show them how to appreciate it

fully. His followers are expert guides, and they often show

visitors around.

Quests: Urbanus believes that cities need to grow,

but not always by becoming larger. Sometimes they

need to destroy an evil lurking within them, or to

straighten crooked streets or repair old buildings.

His followers often lead campaigns to restore old city

sections,  and  they  also  help  organize  neighborhood

watches.

Prayers: Prayers to Urbanus center

around the beauty of the city. His wor-

shipers  mention  beloved  locations  or

elements as a way to attract his attention

and win his love.

Shrines:  Urbanus  has  shrines  at

major  locations  in  most  citiesthe

city hall, the main bridge, the front

gates, and so forth. Small plaques are

attached  to  these  locations,  letting

his worshipers know that these spots

are  sacred  to  him.  Nothing  else  is

neededthe entire city is his temple.

Rites:  Urbanus  presides  over  the

dedications of new buildings, the meet-

ings to plan new city sections, and any

other large, peaceful gatherings within

city limits. His ceremonies are short but

poetic, often featuring original poems or songs about

some element of the city.

Herald  and  Allies:  A  massive  iron  golem  is

contrary to the spell description.)

Favored Weapon: Heavy mace.

ZARUS

Greater God (Lawful Evil)

Long ago, according to legend, Zarus was the  rst man,

created  by  the  world  itself.  No  deity  had  a  hand  in  his

creation,  because  no  deity  could  have  conceived  such  a

perfect creature. Members of the other races trembled to

see him, for they knew that he was their superior in every

way. His grace surpassed that of the elves, his sturdiness

astounded the dwarves, his crafts were the awe of gnomes

and hal ings everywhere.

As  long  as  Zarus  was  alone,  the  other  races  allowed

him to live, secure in the knowledge that he could not

reproduce.  But  Zarus  was  not  content.  He  spoke  with

the  world  and  begged  for  a  mateand  it  created  his

wife, Astra. She was as perfect a woman as Zarus was a

man, and the other races trembled yet again, fearing that

this perfect couple would spawn a new race that would

overshadow them all. To prevent this, the leaders of each

race gathered in secret and plotted Zaruss demise. They

brewed a poison and mixed it in fine wine, which they

gave to him as a wedding present.

Zarus  knew  that  the  others  plotted  his

death,  but  he  could  not  honorably  refuse

the  gift.  He  toasted  their  health,  and  drank.

The poison worked swiftly, but as Zarus felt his

life departing the world took pity upon him and

elevated him to godhood. Now Zarus looked down

upon the world, and he wiped away the tears of his

wife  Astra.  Do  not  weep  for  me,  beloved,  he

consoled  her,  for  I  am  now  a  god,

and set to watch over our people. You

will bear me childrenthey already

lie  in  your  womband  these  will  be

the start of our race. All the other races

will quake in fear, knowing that they

cannot match us.

This is the story told in the Book

of  Zarus,  the  holy  scripture  of  his

church.  Zarus  is  called  the  true

human  god  and  is  considered  the

only god who places humans before

all  others.  He  cares  nothing  for  the

other  races,  only  for  humanity,  and

encourages  his  followers  to  prove

themselves  better  than  any  nonhu-

man. Unfortunately, he also fosters the belief that

humans  deserve  to  rule  the  world,  treating  other

races as servants. His priests teach that other races

are  inferior,  in  need  of  human  guidanceand

human masters.

The clerics of Zarus encourage conquest and slavery.

The  worst  sin  a  human  can  commit,  according  to  the

Church of Zarus, is to mate with a nonhuman and pro-

duce a child. This child is a taint on the race and must be

removed.

Zarus appears as an incredibly handsome human male in

his prime, suffused with a golden glow. Zarus encourages

his followers and priests to become as perfect as possible,

and to dominate other races.

Domains: Destiny (see page 163), Evil, Law, Strength,

War.

Cleric  Training:  Zaruss  priests  look  for  attractive,

healthy youths who show pride in their abilities and arro-

gance toward anyone weaker. They recruit these people by

offering to make them the best they can be. These acolytes

are  subjected  to  strict  training,  honing  their  physiques,

and at the same time they are taught that humanity is the

superior race and deserves to rule the world. These young

clerics learn both how to give rousing speeches and how

to wage war. They begin preaching in villages and towns,

spreading their message.

Quests: Zarus sends his followers to destroy enclaves

of other races, kill their heroes and leaders, and steal their

artifacts.  He  encourages  human  armies  to  conquer

non human lands and subjugate their people.

he presents himself in a way each being can understand.

But no matter what the form, its All-Father who is actually

providing guidance and divine power.

A common criticism of the unity church is that some

deities are evil, and many gods war against one another.

All-Fathers followers claim these apparent contra-

dictions are merely tests of faith.

Prayers:  Zarus  prefers  action  to  words,  and  his

followers pray to him by exercising and by taking part

in athletic competitions where they can demonstrate

their superiority. Every morning they perform their

exercises,  vowing  to  be  the  best  they  can

be  and  to  demonstrate  to  other  races  that

humans are superior in every way.

Temples:  Zaruss  temples  are

handsome structures, not elaborate

but  extemely  well  made  and

with  tasteful  decorations.  The

walls are covered with tapestries

depicting mankinds

talents:  scenes  of

hunting,  farming,

weaving, and other occupa-

tions. The altar is always a gold

statue of a perfect human male,

a representation of Zarus himself.

Rites: Zaruss worshipers pray to

him  before  a  physical  competition,

before a war, and before entering the terri-

tory of another race. Ceremonies are short

and direct, and require physical exertion.

Herald and Allies: Zarus has no heraldhe claims

he  needs  none.  He  sends  Medium,  Large,  and  Huge

elementals in response to planar ally spells.

Favored Weapon: Greatsword.

OTHER FORMS OF FAITH

Humans have demonstrated, over the centuries, that they

can believe almost anything they choose, however strange

it sounds.

Pantheism: Some humans worship an entire pantheon

of godspraying to Kord for strength, to Heironeous for

valor, and to Boccob for insight. Urbanus  ts easily into

a pantheistic society, where religious scholars place him

as a servant or ally of Heironeous or Pelor. Zarus is more

dif cult to place in a pantheon, since his worshipers insist

that humanity has no other god. Even so, Zaruss followers

believe in Moradin, Garl Glittergold, and the other nonhu-

man deities; Zarus just wants those deities destroyed or

subjugated.

Monotheism:  A  human  unity  church  claims  that

every known deity is simply one facet of a greater being.

This being, known only as All-Father, is the true creator of

the universe and everything in it. The church believes that

All-Father  appears  differently  to  different  races  because

Deism:  Another  form  of  religion  posits  that

none of the gods exist as deities per se; theyre just

powerful outsiders with delusions of grandeur. The

true creator of the universe is essentially unknowable

because the creator abandoned the universe

after  creating  it,  leaving  powerful

outsiders  to  set  themselves  up  as

 gureheads used to personify ideals.

The only true power, they claim, is

the  universe  itself,  which  has

no consciousness or personality,

but  responds  through  effort  to

the  will  of  sentient

creatures.

HISTORY AND

FOLKLORE

Humans are the youngest of the major

races,  which  means  their  history  is

not as long as that of their neighbors.

The combination of a short time in the world

and an amazing variety of human cultures creates a rich

tapestry of folk tales and historical events, but few myths

and legends that reach across cultural boundaries.

For humans, relatively recent historical events function

as myths and legends. Human children might quiver at

the story of St. Cuthbert and the dragon, for example, and

pass it to their offspring in turn. A young human  ghter

might be inspired by a tale of the Lost Legions Crusade.

But in the D&D world, there are elves and dwarves for

whom the Lost Legions Crusade isnt a legendits a vivid

memory  from  their  own  lifetimes.  Some  older  dragons

have  rsthand knowledge of St. Cuthberts battle against

the dragon.

Human  history  becomes  human  legend  with  great

rapidity, but in most campaign worlds, the recent history

of  humanity is the  recent  history  of the  world.  Because

humans are so widespread and exert such a strong in u-

ence  on  global  events,  almost  every  societyhuman  or

otherwiseknows the major wars, disasters, and triumphs

that comprise human history.

Much of humanitys early history, from primitive ages

when  recordkeeping  was  less  important  than  survival,

has been lost. Scholars and bards have struggled to  nd

evidence  from  the  dawn  of  human  existence,  and  have

created tales around what they have discovered and what

they believe happened.

Roleplaying  Application:  Human  history  has  more

recent events of importance than the history of any other

race. Think about which historical events resonate with

your character. Your character might treat gnomes kindly

because  she  is  ashamed  of  Desslochs  gnome  purges  a

decade ago. Your character might revere the pioneers in

the  Caravan  of  Istagarrai,  founders  of  the  rst  human

settlements in your area. The history your character chooses

says a lot about his attitude toward his people, and toward

himself.

MYTHIC ORIGINS

While humans have a rich, detailed recent history to draw

mythic inspiration from, they dont have as rich a trove of

humanitywide myths. For example, humans dont have a

widely accepted creation story. Instead, each culture has

its own story of how humans came to beeven nonhu-

man cultures such as the elves and dwarves. The majority

of  humans  refuse  to  accept  any  nonhumans  version  of

humanitys  originseven  accounts  from  outsiders  who

claim  to  have  been  there.  Humans  believe  that  such

accounts are biased against humanity (and indeed, many

play on less than attering human stereotypes).

Most human histories agree on one pointthat human-

ity did not have an illustrious beginning. Only the Book of

Zarus claims otherwise.

Tale  of  Clay:  Perhaps  the  most  popular  myth  among

human cultures is the Tale of Clay. According to this bit

of lore, the deities had gathered together to discuss their

various races, and the place of those races in the world.

None of the gods had seen the others creations.

To demonstrate what he was saying, Corellon Larethian

took  a  lump  of  clay  from  the  ground  and  shaped  it  to

resemble the elves. When he was done speaking, Moradin

took the clay and altered it to match the dwarves he had

just created. Each god followed suit, so that the clay looked

like each of the races in turn.

When twilight came, the deities returned to their homes,

leaving the clay forgotten on the ground. The touch of so

many deities had woken the clay to life, and it began to

move.  It  tried  to  stand,  but  it  faltered  because  its  shape

and appearance kept changing, uctuating between the

different races it had displayed.

The lump of clay knew it would have to choose a single

form. But to favor one gods creation over anothers seemed

impossible, so the clay compromised. It took features from

each of the races and merged them together to form a new

design, reminiscent of each but unlike all.

When the gods discovered the clay the next day, they

were  so  impressed  they  allowed  it  to  live,  and  gave  it  a

mate,  designed  as  a  combination  of  each  races  females.

These were the rst humans, and because each god had

blessed  their  union,  they  ourished,  and  their  children

spread across the world.

Dwarfs Fall: A good example of a human creation myth

told by nonhumans is the Dwarfs Fall. Long ago, the tale

goes, a dwarf was walking home. It began to rain heavily,

but  the  dwarf  trudged  on.  Then  his  boot  slipped  in  the

mud and he fell backward, his heavy body sinking into

the  soaked  earth.  Grumbling,  the  dwarf  pulled  himself

free and continued on his way, leaving his outline pressed

into the mud.

As  the  rain  continued,  it  lled  that  outline.  The  rain

turned to ice, and ice began to form above the outline, shap-

ing the top portion of the dwarf as well. For three days and

three nights the wind howled and snow fell. On the fourth

day, the sun rose, and the ice and snow melted away. The

ice replica of the dwarf cracked and disintegrated, leaving

behind a creature cast in the dwarfs image. But the ground

there slanted slightly, so the outline slid downhill, during

the rain and snow. Thus the new creature was taller and

slimmer than the original dwarf. Thus, from the outline

of a dwarf rose the rst man.

The Tale of Oratea: A haling folk tale has humanity

born of older races in a much more literal way. Oratea was a

beautiful female haling, and many of her own kind wooed

her. Then she encountered a pair of travelers, a tall slender

elf named Terian and a stout dwarf named Koemac.

The  travelers  both  loved  her  and  demanded  that  she

choose one of them as her mate. Oratea was greedy and

insisted that she would wed both of them or no one at all.

Finally, Terian and Koemac relented and were both married

to Oratea.

Months  later,  Oratea  became  pregnant.  But  the  gods,

looking down, frowned upon her for her arrogance and

greed. They caused her two husbands to become jealous

and to demand that she choose one of them and be done

with the other.

After much argument, the husbands declared that the

baby  would  be  the  deciding  factor.  Whichever  father  it

resembled  would  stay,  and  the  other  one  would  leave,

never to return. But when Oratea gave birth, she became

the mother of twins.

When the fathers heard the news, they groaned, suspec-

tuing that one child would have elf heritage and the other

would have dwarf blood. But it was not to be so simple.

One baby belonged to Terian and other to Koemac, but the

deities made both babies resemble both fathers, blending

their features together.

Terian and Koemac, recognizing this as a sign of the gods

displeasure, ed. Oratea died of a broken heart, leaving her

children to make their way in the world. The deities took

pity on the babies and helped them to survive. Eventually

the children grew to adulthood, married, and bore more

children.  Orateas  grandchildren  also  had  features  that

were a mixture of elf, dwarf, and haling. These were the

rst humans.

The Broken Mold: Every myth agrees that humanity

was the last major race createdevery myth but one, that

H

is. The Myth of the Broken Mold contends that long ago,

the  gods  gathered  to  create  a  race  of  lesser  beings  with

which they could populate the world. The deities labored

together in a secret chamber, each offering suggestions,

and nally they reached a consensus. They carved a mold,

and when all the gods added their personal touches and

approved the details, a being was cast from that mold.

Emerging from the mold was the rst human. Each of the

gods then wanted to create the second human without any

cooperation, and a struggle broke out. During the confu-

sion, the mold slipped from their hands and shattered on

the ground. Each god blamed the others and departed in

anger, leaving the human in the meeting chamber, alone

but for the broken mold.

In  their  respective  homes,  each  of  the  deities  tried

recreating the mold, but none of them could remember it

exactly. Moradin made it too broad, while Corellon made

it too thin and Yondalla made it too round. All of them,

including  Garl  Glittergold,  made  their  molds  too  short.

Thus, the other races were borndwarf and elf and haling

and gnome.

While the gods were making imperfect versions of their

original creation, the human left in the meeting chamber

struggled to rebuild the broken mold. Centuries later, that

rst human succeeded and created enough copies to extend

humanity across the world. In this way, humans were the

rst of the gods creations, yet the last to reach the world.

LEGENDS

Humanity may have conicting myths, but its legends are

consistent. Or, at least, each legend has the same consistent

form. Some legends are specic to a certain region, while

others can be found in every human settlement. Not every

legend is positivesome tell of a hero failing a quest, or a

man losing himself due to greed or laziness or some other

fault. But most talk of great men and women who overcame

hardships to protect their families and who earned a noble

gift for the entire race.

Recounting legends is a popular pastime at night, when

all the chores are done and the evening meal has been eaten.

Children drift off to sleep to the sound of their parents

recounting an old tale, and their dreams ll with images of

those ancient heroes and heroines. This activity helps shape

the children into adults who value such ideals as bravery,

resourcefulness, loyalty, and hard work. Elders compete

to see who can remember the most legends, and travelers

share legends from other regions, bringing new tales to

each location along the way. Most humans stop believing

in the legends once they grow up; the tales become just

stories  told  for  amusement  and  education,  rather  than

expressions of truth. But some adults still believe, and even

go searching for evidence of those legendary gures from

long ago.

Humanitys  legends  are  too  many  to  recount.  Below

are several examples, all of them widespread throughout

the human community. Each of these legends describes a

pivotal moment in human history and explains why the

human race is different from other races.

Desh

The rst men and women lived out under the sky, dancing

through the meadows by day and collapsing on soft elds

of heather at night. Then, one day when it began to rain,

a woman said to the others, I am tired of being wet. Is

there not some way in which we can stay dry and warm,

and continue to laugh and play?

They looked around and thought. They saw nothing but

heather and grass in their meadow. Then one of them said,

One day when we ran laughing across the valley, I found

a place where tall trees grow. Surely their broad branches

and outstretched leaves will shield us from the rain.

Everyone set out for these trees and soon found them

clustered along one side of a wide valley. They ran beneath

the trees, and the ground there was dry, for the rain could

not pierce the thick foliage. Then the people laughed and

danced again.

Now night began to fall, and one woman turned to the

others. I grow cold, she said. Each day, as the sun caresses

my skin, I am warm and comfortable. But when the sun

sets and darkness covers the sky, I grow cold, and shiver

there among the heather. Is there not some way we could

stay warm throughout the night?

They looked around and thought. At last one of the men

answered. One day, as we were playing, I hid myself within

a wide bush to surprise everyone as they ran past. A cold

wind was blowing, but once among its branches I felt it not,

for the brambles shielded me. Perhaps we can each climb

within a bush, and sleep sheltered by its thorns.

Everyone set out for the bushes and found them on the

other side of the valley. Each selected a bush and climbed

within it. The thick brambles blocked the wind, and they

fell asleep.

The next morning, one of the women stated, Last night,

it  is  true,  I  was  warm.  But  the  brambles  are  sharp,  and

scratched my skin. Also, I miss the warmth of my mate,

who would lie curled up against me when we slept in the

heather.  The  bushes  have  not  enough  room  for  both  of

us together. Is there no way we can stay warm yet sleep

together?

They looked around and thought. After some time, one

of the men replied, Once, as we raced across the meadows,

I spied a cave at the foot of a hill. Perhaps it is deep enough

for several to sleep there together.

Everyone set out for the cave, which lay at the north edge

of the valley. They found it large enough for two to sleep

within it together. But its wide entrance would allow the

wind to rush in.

Perhaps, one of the women suggested, a bush could be

brought here, and set in the cave mouth, to block the wind

from gaining entry.

This  was  done,  and  the  woman  and  her  mate  slept  in

the  cave  that  night.  The  next  morning,  they  declared

themselves warm and refreshed. Everyone wanted such a

sleeping place, but the valley had no other caves.

Setting the bush before the cave blocked the wind, a

woman pointed out. Could we not take four bushes and set

them around a patch of heather, forming a place in which

two mates could sleep safe from the wind?

The men took four bushes and set them around a patch

of heather in the center of the valley.

That will keep the wind at bay, a woman agreed, but

the rain will still fall overhead. Could we not take branches

and leaves from the trees and lay them atop the bushes, to

keep the sleepers dry?

The men did this, and the space was warm and dry and

comfortable. Each other pair of mates wanted such a place to

sleep within, and so more bushes and more branches were

gathered, and more sleeping quarters formed in the valley.

The bushes, having been uprooted, died, but their brambles

still blocked the wind and cold. The leaves and branches,

taken from their trees, also died, but still protected those

beneath them from the rain.

Over time, the men learned to trim away most of the

brambles,  leaving  a  framework  of  bushes.  Then  they

learned to strip bark from trees and wrap this around the

framework, forming a solid wall against the wind. Next

they discovered how to tie the branches and leaves on top,

so that they would not y away and would instead form a

xed roof. Finally, the men realized that they could drive

the bushes into the ground, keeping them from shifting

with  strong  winds,  but  could  leave  one  section  loose  to

slide open as a means of entry.

Each man and woman had a chamber of this sort, and

they were set near each other on the valley oor, not far

from  a  small  stream.  This  became  the  rst  village,  and

the people named it Desh, which in the old tongue means

shelter.

The Horned Plague

All of humanity lived in Desh, along the valley oor. The

village  had  grown,  and  the  hunters  needed  to  wander

far aeld to nd enough food for everyone. One day the

hunters were walking through a forest when they spied a

massive stag, its antlers so wide that they swept the trees

on either side. One of the hunters readied his spear, but

his companion stopped him.

Notice the stags skin, silver as the water in moonlight,

his friend pointed out. This stag is no normal beast. Per-

haps it is a god of the forest, or a gods beloved creature.

Best we leave it to make its way unharmed, and nd other

game.

The rst hunter, whose name was Sharak, shook off his

friends hand where it gripped his spear arm. Our people

go hungry, he replied, That beast would feed many. And

I desire the creatures silvery skin for a tunic. With that,

he let y his spear. Sharaks aim was true, and the stone

spearpoint pierced the stags breast and then its heart. The

majestic  creature  leaped  up,  then  fell  dead  to  the  forest

oor.

Sharak and his companions skinned the stag and por-

tioned out its meat to carry back to the village. But true

warning Sharaks friend had given, for the stag had been

the favorite of a god who dwelt nearby. The god, after seeing

his beloved stag slain, called down a curseall those who

consumed the meat of the stag would be tainted by the

violence of its death.

The  next  day,  the  villagers  who  partook  of  the  meat

became ill. They collapsed, and lay in their beds as if dead.

Many of them did die. Others survived, but not unchanged,

for they became darker, their features twisted, as if a cor-

ruption had spread throughout them and their very features

bore its mark. The village elders, fearing this as a sign of an

illness that threatened to spread throughout Desh, called

to their people.

We must escape this place, they cried. This plague that

does transform men into monsters ravages our people. Soon

the entire village may be lost to it, and our families dead

or changed beyond recognition. Gather your belongings,

therefore, and we will set out for some place that has not

this taint upon it.

The  men  and  women  of  Desh  gathered  their  goods

together  and,  with  many  a  tearful  glance  behind,  ed

the  village  of  Desh.  They  climbed  from  the  valley  and

wandered into the world. At every glen or riverbank that

could provide some food and shelter, some of the people

stopped and made their homes, so that humanity was no

longer gathered all in one place, and could no longer present

such an easy target for any gods displeasure.

Melanas Arrow

A woman named Melana was walking one day when she

came upon a strange sight. There before her stood two men,

both unlike any men she had known. One was as slight as a

child, graceful of limb and face, with owing hair, a smooth

chin, and large eyes. The other was as stout as an oak, with

a long beard and heavy brow, and small eyes gleaming like

the moon. The two were arguing and seemed not to notice

as she drew near.

No true hunter could fail to use a bow, claimed the rst,

gesturing, and Melana saw that in his hands was a bow,

tall as himself and beautifully carved. Any other weapon

is useless, and foolish is the creature who bears it.

Stone is strong, and shatters all before it, the stout one

replied,  hefting  a  strangely  shaped  club.  Melana  could

see  that  the  weapon  was  made  from  stone,  and  carved

into  a  handle  at  the  bottom  and  a  wide  head  at  the  top.

Wood breaks easily, and only a fool would consider it for

a weapon.

Now close enough that she could have tossed her head

and  struck  them  upon  their  chins  with  her  long  braid,

Melana  observed  that  these  two  strangers  stood  shorter

than her by a head. This eased her fear, and she spoke to

them.

What manner of men are you, she asked, and whither

do you come? For surely were you from my village I would

know you.

Both turned, astonished, and regarded her.

And what village is this, that breeds women so tall and

strong? the slight one replied. Surely I have never seen

your like, though I have traveled this wood many times.

Nor have I, the stout one agreed. And I would remem-

ber, had I seen a lass so tall and slender, with hair so long

and cheeks so smooth.

Why do you argue so? Melana asked them. Are you

rivals, determined each to be the better? You speak of stone

and of bow, yet surely neither apart is as strong as the two

together.

Together? the strangers scoffed. Stone and bow cannot

mixwhat can you mean?

Melana turned aside then, and, drawing her knife, cut a

thin branch from a nearby tree. Quick strokes stripped its

bark and notched its ends. Next she knelt and, locating a

small shard of int and a larger stone, she began striking

the int against the stone, shaping it. This she afxed to

the branch, sliding it into one notch and fastening it there

with vine. At the other end she added leaves lifted from

the ground. Finished, she presented this to the strangers.

Behold. She handed the item to the bowman. Here is

an arrow t for your bow, yet crafted with a head of stone.

Now, truly, stone and bow can work together, and both are

the greater for it.

The strangers each studied the arrow in turn. Finally,

they turned to one another.

Indeed, she is correct, the bowman commented. This

arrow, with its head of stone, will pierce more deeply than

my  own  wooden  shafts,  and  survive  the  impact  to  y

again.

And, propelled by your bow, it will strike farther than I

can reach with my mace, the stouter one replied. Clearly

we are the both of us fools, to be arguing one side and the

other, while this towering female beside us sees both sides

together.

Turning  then  to  Melana,  the  bowman  addressed  her.

Remian am I, from the land of the elves. I would know

your name, mistress, who does see more clearly than I and

can so easily settle such an old dispute.

Norabun they call me, the stout one added. Among the

dwarves I am not without fame, yet your wisdom astounds

me. Name yourself, that we may call you friend and thank

you.

I  am  Melana,  she  replied.  I  know  naught  of  elves

and dwarves. My home lies there, beyond the hill, where

humans gather in the village of Whylis. I would know more

of you and your kind, and will gladly call you friend.

And thus humans met elves and dwarves, and the three

races found themselves able to speak together and to agree

upon several things. Yet always humans were at the center,

for elves and dwarves rarely agreed, yet both found common

ground with humans, and so humans were forced to bridge

the gap between them.

Lakeem and the Lure of the Sea

A boy named Lakeem lived in the village of Sonelm. His

father was a hunter, and had trained Lakeem in that profes-

sion. But the boy did not enjoy the bow and the spear, nor

did he relish the death throes of deer and rabbit and boar.

Instead, he loved to run through the forest, exulting as the

wind lifted his long hair about him. Always Lakeem longed

for more speed, to y as the birds did high overhead, his

feet never touching ground.

Lakeems father was displeased with him. If you will not

hunt, you will not eat, he told the boy one day. Go forth

and nd your own way, for I shall not support you.

Saddened,  the  boy  gathered  his  clothes  and  his  knife

and set off. He ran through the forest, past the point where

hunters turned back for home. On Lakeem ran, through

the woods, until nally they thinned. Then he stopped,

for the sight before him stole his breath away.

The woods ended, and beyond them lay a short stretch

of land, grass covering much of it. Near its far edge the

grass vanished, leaving only dirt of a strange shade, yellow

like a new leaf. Beyond that lay the sight that had stopped

Lakeem:  There,  past  that  yellow  land,  stretched  a  vast

plain. It shimmered silver in the sunlight, much the way

the stream near Sonelm glistened as it danced by. But this

plain ran past the limit of Lakeems vision, vanishing into

the distance.

His  heart  pounding,  the  boy  sped  down  the  hill  and

toward this strange sight. The yellow ground, he discovered,

was loose dirt, strangely dry, and clouds of it rose around

him as his feet sped across it. Then he reached the edge.

As he had thought, the plain was water like the stream,

except this water was blue as the night sky, and it went on

forever. How could such a place exist, thought Lakeem.

Is this the home of the stream, to which it returns every

night? Is it perhaps the home of other streams as well, the

way Sonelm houses my father and the others with their

families?

Lakeem  had  often  placed  his  feet  in  the  cool  stream

near home, and now he did the same here. This water was

warmer, and it stung his bare skin. Curious, he slid fully

under the water, enjoying the sensation. Lakeem closed his

eyes and felt himself rising as if carried upon the wind. His

face broke through to air, and he looked about, watching as

his body also rose to the surface. Thus he lay, as if upon a

soft stretch of grass, the water gently stirring him against

the strip of ground.

Finally, Lakeem pulled himself from the water and col-

lapsed upon the ground. Exhausted, he slept, and in his

dreams he ew not over air but across water.

The  next  morning,  Lakeem  walked  along  the  waters

edge, staring out across the endless expanse. After many

hours, he noticed something moving along the water. It

was brown against the blue, and nally he could see it was

a tree branch, still bearing leaves.

I oat upon the water, Lakeem thought. And that branch

does as well. Surely, if I were to lean against the branch, we

would both oat, and then I could rest more comfortably

as the water carried me along.

Retreating to the forest, he found a broad branch that had

been torn loose in some past storm and now lay upon the

ground. It stretched as long as Lakeem himself, and nearly

as wide. One smaller limb rose from it at an angle, still

bearing its broad canopy of leaves. This Lakeem dragged

to the water and tossed in. It bobbed among the waves, and

he leapt in himself, grabbing the branch and stretching his

body along it. The branch oated and held him up as well.

Lakeem wrestled for a better grip, turning the branch until

its limb stood straight up. This he wrapped an arm around,

the other trailing in the water.

Just then a wind blew across the water from the shore.

The leaves on the branch caught the wind, and they bent

forward  but  held.  The  branch  leaped  across  the  water,

propelled forward like an arrow from a bow, and Lakeem

felt his heart soar. He was ying at last, dancing across the

waves, free as a bird!

Over  time  Lakeem  learned  to  hollow  out  the  branch,

making for himself a channel in which to sit. A woven mat

of leaves he hung upon a sturdy frame of branches, and set

this above to catch the wind. By turning this frame, he

could change his direction. By lowering it he could stop

moving. And, with a smaller branch broken off from the

original, he could dig against the water, pushing his craft

elsewhere.

Years later, Lakeem returned to Sonelm. He arrived by

sailing along a broad river, then walking across to the vil-

lage, his boat carried upon his shoulders. The people there

laughed to see him so, and cried out, What, Lakeem, did

you grow a shell to protect yourself in the world?

Lakeem told them of the places he had been, and the

sights he had seen. He brought to his mother strange stones,

worn smooth by the sea and glittering like the moon. To his

father he gave several large sh, their esh succulent and

sweet. He led his parents and the village elders to the river,

and showed them how his boat sailed upon the water.

Then the people admired him, and his father clapped

him upon the back. Truly, you are no hunter, his father

cried, yet you have found your own way, and have returned

to show our people. The villagers of Sonelm made boats

under Lakeems direction. Thus humans learned to sail the

seas, and they became masters of the waves.

LANGUAGE

A culturally diverse race such as humans would naturally

develop a multitude of languagesand in fact thats just

what humans did in the real world.

But  language  barriers  are  even  more  of  an  obstacle  at

the  gaming  table  than  they  are  for  a  real-world  traveler.

A D&D game can quickly bog down when a PC resorts

to extensive sign language and gestures to communicate

with every NPC in town.

For this reason, most D&D worlds posit that all humans

speak a single languageand its one that most nonhu-

mans  know  as  well.  Referred  to  as  Common  in  D&D

rulebooks, this mother tongue makes NPC interaction

function more smoothly, and it emphasizes the central

importance of humans in the affairs of the world. Humans

are  so  ubiquitous  that  their  language  has  become  the

default  tongueeveryone  knows  at  least  a  smattering

of it.

Alternatively,  you  can  assume  a  different  origin  for

Common. Humans borrow technology, magical innova-

tions, and cultural traditions, so it makes a certain amount

of  sense  that  theyd  borrow  language  from  older  races

as  well.  Rather  than  being  a  human  mother  tongue

that other races learn because humans are so prevalent,

Common  could  be  a  jumbled  mixture  of  every  other

language.  Nonhumans  dont  speak  Common  because

its convenient to do so. They speak Common because it

shares many words with their native language and is easy

to learn.

If the DM wants to introduce multiple human languages

in  the  campaign,  he  can  reduce  the  effectiveness  of

Common while retaining its prevalence. In such a world,

almost  everyone  can  speak  Common,  but  the  language

is capable of expressing only basic concepts (hello, how

much does that cost, hands up or Ill shoot). Anyone who

wants to discuss matters in depth must use a more rened

language, whether of human origin or not. Each human

nation might have its own language, or nations could share

the same language but have important cultural and politi-

cal differences (much as the United States, Australia, and

Great Britain do in the real world).

In a campaign where Common is eliminated completely,

characters are forced to spend skill points on learning other

languages. A world full of dozens of languages is more like

the  real  world,  but  its  also  more  difcult  for  characters

to make themselves understood. They may spend a good

chunk of their time nding translators to help them navi-

gate a foreign society. In this sort of campaign, spells such

as tongues and comprehend languages become very important,

as does judicious use of the Diplomacy skill when things

threaten to get lost in translation.

GUTTERSPEAK

Much like the humans who speak it, Common is a language

that changes with the times and displays a wide variety

of dialects, slang, and pidgin variations. In the slums and

ghettos of the largest cities, a debased form of Common

has emerged that incorporates even more elements from

different languages.

Known as Gutterspeak, this dialect makes extensive use

of slang and made-up words. Gutterspeak is the language

of the streets, and the upper class frowns on its use. Using

Gutterspeak in high society is appallingly rude and a sure

sign of low breeding.

Travelers to any human city will hear Gutterspeak, but

the language is much rarer outside large metropolitan areas,

since  most  rural  areas  have  their  own  regional  dialects.

Gutterspeak is constantly changing, and the idioms, curses,

and slang that comprise Gutterspeak in one city might be

unheard of in a city far away.

Although  a  variant  of  Common,  Gutterspeak  has  no

written version of its own. Some storytellers try to recre-

ate this earthy, slang-ridden language in their own works,

typically producing a hard-to-read doggerel.

GUTTERSPEAK PHRASEBOOK

The  following  Gutterspeak  phrases  may  come  up  at  the

gaming table with some regularity. Characters from urban,

lower-class areas are more likely to use these phrases than

those with more education. To capture the feel of Gutter-

speak at the game table, use the following terms (or their

English  translations)  and  invent  your  own  Gutterspeak

words and phrases.

Like tahh on a kesir. Like tusks on an elf. A statement that

indicates that something is ill-tting or inappropriate.

Choor! A general swear word derived from Orc, used to

describe something unpleasant. It is commonly used as an

expletive or in its adjectival form, choory.

Ravan. A shortened form of the Elven word for friend

(ravanthas), used as a casual term for a comrade, friend, or

associate.

He nothin but a babblestunt. A derogative term describing

an overly gregarious haling or gnome, but also used for

anyone who talks incessantly about nothing important.

Kessukoofah  cant  play  lessen  he  jingles.  Roughly:  The

fool isnt welcome unless he has money. Kessukoofah is a

bastardization of Gnome and Elven terms, both of which

mean fool or stupid.

Matta neh standin eh puddles when alush tasa. It doesnt

matter  whether  its  raining  when  youre  standing  in

puddles. A mishmash of Elven and Orc, this is a typical

lament of the poor and downtrodden, meaning that a situ-

ation cant get much worse when youre already as low as

you can be.

Time a kerym oror ya ravan krun. Sometimes a knife is

your best friend. A phrase using the Elven word for knife or

sword (kerym) and the Orc word for best or most (krun).

Nash him to the squeaks, mernar! Feed him to the rats, com-

rades! An obvious statement that utilizes an unlikely blend

of Common, the Orc word for eating or feasting (nash), and

the Dwarven word for comrade or friend (mernar).

CITIES AND

SETTLEMENTS

Humans are a remarkably adaptable race that can survive

almost insurmountable odds. They can survive in nearly

any  climate,  although  they  prefer  warmer  and  drier  cli-

mates. Humans drive and ambition leads them to establish

settlements in even the most unlikely locations, as long as

those places have adequate food and water. Expansionist by

nature, humans crave new territory, which often results in

clashes with other races over prime samples of land.

HUMAN EXPANSION

Just as individual members of other races are alternately

amused by and frustrated with the behavior of individual

humans,  so  too  do  nonhuman  cultures  nd  themselves

at odds with the human societies that border and some-

times envelop them. When the other races use one word

to describe humanity, they often say plague, horde, or

swarm.  Even  if  theyre  being  particularly  diplomatic,

elves and dwarves refer to human societies as everpresent

or busy.

That  is,  after  all,  one  of  humanitys  strongest  traits

human societies can be found everywhere. Harsh climates,

remote locations, and erce locals are seen as challenges,

not barriers. Its difcult to imagine a place so forsaken

that no humans would ever attempt to settle it. Not every

settlement succeeds, of course, but one failure only means

that the next human settlers to lay claim to an area are more

determined and better prepared. As the elves say, Once the

rst humans gain a foothold, we must coexist or retreat,

because the humans never relinquish the ground theyve

seized.

Humans regard ambitious expansion as proof of their

tenacity and worthiness. A human societt rarely gives up on

an objective; it either attains the goal or falls apart trying.

An individual human might quit a task and walk away, but

human societies are always moving forward, looking for

new places to conquer, new areas to settle, new industries

to develop. Once a human society embarks on a crusade,

it often takes a revolution or some other calamity to end

that effort prior to victory.

The  high  birth  rate  of  humans  also  fuels  the  races

expansion. Its not uncommon for human families to raise

four to eight children, each of whom will have families of

their own. That means the parents are always looking for

1

26

ways to make more money, settle more land, and otherwise

provide more support for their growing children. The drive

to provide for ones offspring is particularly powerful in

humans, combining their future focus with their natural

ambition.

That drive is why human societies seem so busy to non-

humans. Humans are never satised, constantly striving

to  improve  upon  what  they  have  already  accomplished.

Humans rarely leave land alone. They cultivate and harvest

it, putting the land to work for their goals. Humans build

their houses only to rebuild them later, making them larger

and stronger with each iteration.

The  human  obsession  with  expansion  plays  into  the

arrogance that comes with ambition and adaptability. If

nonhumans tell humans they cant settle somewhere, you

can count on a village springing up in that location almost

overnight. Human pioneers travel to places other races shy

away from, nding ways to draw sustenance and wealth

from terrain that others say is worthless.

If a region can support a human village, it probably has

one. As a result, humans can nd their own kind no matter

where they go, and they are more likely to get help and

information from these other humans than from members

of any other race. If an area doesnt have any human settlers,

its probably because the place hasnt been discovered yet,

some menace has killed every human who approached, or

a nearby human society has agreed not to settle there in

return for some other consideration.

Adventure  Seed:  Whenever  adventurers  nd  a  place

where humans could live but do not, they should wonder

why. The reason might be obvious: re rains from the sky,

orc  hordes  raze  the  area  regularly,  or  a  virulent  disease

infects all humans who go there. The reason for the absence

of humans might be mysterious (Nobody ever comes back

from  there),  vague  (The  place  is  haunted  by  evil),  or

ctitious (The elves say that powerful magic turns every

trespasser into a toad).

Roleplaying Application: Give some thought to what

kind  of  community  you  grew  up  in.  If  youre  playing

a  barbarian,  druid,  ranger,  or  wizard,  your  choices  are

somewhat  constrained.  Human  barbarians  live  beyond

civilized  society  (thats  what  makes  them  barbarians,

after all), and druids and rangers often live on the frontier

between human civilization and the wilderness. Wizards

tend to come from towns and cities with the colleges and

high-level mentors that possess arcane knowledge.

But even with those provisions, your home community

can be nearly anywhere.

SETTLING THE FRONTIER

When  humans  consider  pioneering  a  new  community,

the rst question they ask is one of usefulness. What does

this location have to offer? Arable land and terrain with

extractable commodities such as timber and iron is obvi-

ously useful to the settler, but other locations are also ripe

for human settlement. Humans are smart enough traders

to  value  the  convenience  of  a  location  where  two  rivers

meet  or  two  roads  cross.  For  groups  such  as  mysterious

cults and esoteric wizard schools, the remoteness of some

locations is why theyre useful. Some humans, for reasons

fair or foul, just want to be left alone.

The  second  concern  for  human  pioneers  is  essential

resources.  Does  the  location  have  access  to  fresh  water?

Is a food source somewhere nearby, whether game or sh

or  fruit  or  grain?  Are  building  materials  near  at  hand?

Humans wont drag stones and logs across a valley if they

can build homes near the quarry and the logging camp

instead.

The third question is one of defense. Not every human

wages  war,  but  settlers  know  the  dangers  of  the  world

and seek ways to minimize the risk to their families. Can

enemies spy on the settlement from a distance, or do the

human  sentries  have  a  commanding  view  of  the  area

around? Can the settlement be attacked from all sides or

easily surrounded, or is there only one good way in? Can

the inhabitants ee if necessary, escaping into the woods

or along the river?

Finally, a decision about a settlement must consider size.

A location might be ideal for the three families now settling

there, but will it remain so? If two more human families

arrive and settle nearby, can the place accommodate them

as well, or will it become too crowded? How big do the

founders hope the settlement will get?

Humans almost never consider a location too big to be

settled. If the rst wave of pioneers cant work all the land,

later settlers and the children of the original pioneers will

take charge of the remaining land.

Adventure Seed: Would-be pioneers hire the adventur-

ers to scout a region of frontier and nd the best spot to

build a new settlement. In addition to dealing with maraud-

ing monsters and the hazards of the wilderness, the PCs

will have to think like settlers and assess each locations

advantages and drawbacks. Some sites have hidden dangers,

while others may be claimed (fairly or not) by rival groups

of settlers.

BUILDING A COMMUNITY

Once  they  select  a  location,  humans  set  to  work.  They

organize the process of settlement, assigning tasks to people

according to their skills. Some fell trees or quarry rocks for

building materials. Others clear obstructions to make room

for houses. Still others mark out where each building will

stand, leaving room for streets in between. The pioneers

assemble  rudimentary  houses  quickly  enough  for  their

families to take shelter as soon as possible.

As soon as humans have basic shelter, they begin work-

ing the land in whatever fashion is appropriate. Settlers on

an arable prairie will clear the land of brush and plow the

R

27

soil, while a logging camp will start felling and sawing up

trees. Only when the business end of a settlement is fully

functional will humans build themselves more luxurious

quarters and more elaborate defenses.

HUMAN ARCHITECTURE

Human structures almost always sit above ground,  and

they are constructed rather than grown or carved. Thus,

human  buildings  are  fundamentally  different  from  the

habitations of dwarves, gnomes, and elves. Humans like

to live on the surface of the world, setting their feet on

the ground but gazing at the sky overhead. They also like

to fashion their homes from the ground up, assembling

materials into oor, walls, and roof. Human settlements

jut from the earth and dont blend in with the landscape,

particularly  in  areas  where  the  humans  have  cut  down

trees and hacked stone from mountainsides to build their

houses.

Much  to  the  consternation  of  druids  and  others  who

revere  unspoiled  wilderness,  the  area  around  a  human

settlement shows damage from human progress. Humans

accept  this  damage  as  a  necessary  consequence  of  their

go-anywhere,  build-anything  attitude.  Humans  do  not

need to spend time nding the perfect cave or the right

mountain valley. They nd an adequate cave or valley, then

start altering it to suit their needs.

VISITING A HUMAN SETTLEMENT

Human  communities  are  usually  more  cosmopolitan

and welcoming than the communities of other races. In

a  human  city,  visitors  can  buy  nearly  everything  from

the everpresent human merchants, including items that

might  be  illegal  or  that  hail  from  far  away.  Travelers  of

all sorts walk the streets, and strange sights and smells

abound. Other races may trade with foreigners, but they

prefer to do so outside their cities or in a single designated

area. Humans have fewer compunctions about strangers,

and more interest in distant landsafter all, their fellow

humans are often strangers from faraway places. As long

as a human communitys visitors follow the rules, theyre

generally welcome (as long as they arent obviously evil

or dangerous). Goblinoids probably cant set foot inside a

dwarven redoubt or an elf treetop village unless theyre

invading the place, but many human settlements tolerate

a goblinoid presence as long as the goblinoids obey the

law.

Even in smaller settlements, humans display this attitude

of worldliness. Dwarf towns and elf villages are wary of

strangers  and  often  attack  those  who  enter  uninvited.

Human  villagers  are  curious  about  the  world,  and  they

welcome anyone who has traveled it, provided they sense no

threat. Strangers bearing news are welcome, and crafts from

distant lands eagerly received. Perhaps humans are more

welcoming because theyre such a young race, or because

they live their lives on open ground and beneath an open

sky. Unless hes obviously dangerous, a stranger visiting a

small town is big newsand good news. Everyone wants

to know who the newcomer is, where he hails from, and

what he brought to sell or barter.

HUMAN ECONOMIES

Humans thrive upon trade, and, unlike other races, they

appreciate money for its own sake. While a gnome might

regard  a  pile  of  coins  as  means  to  an  endan  end  that

often involves a large gema human sees the pile of coins

as the end itself. The accumulation of monetary wealth for

its own sake is a manifestation of humans future-focused

nature.  Humans  appreciate  money  not  for  what  it  buys,

but for what it might buy in the future, were the possessor

of the money so inclined. Knowing that ones wealth is

sufcient to make a particular purchase gives a human as

much satisfaction as the purchase itself.

Humans are excellent traders because they wander across

the world, adapt quickly to new cultures, and have relatively

sophisticated nancial instruments. Gnomes and half-elves

are sometimes better bargainers, but humans have more

practice  dealing  with  foreigners,  assessing  unfamiliar

items, and putting buyers and sellers together.

Humans also have a mercenary attitude toward money-

related misfortunes. Human merchants look for the best

deals  possible,  and  while  most  will  not  cheat  someone

openly, they happily take advantage of another humans

naivete or ignorance.

A human tricked out of his money by a sly merchant is

angry when he nds out about it, but the anger is tempered

with a grudging respect for the merchants skill at deceiving

him. Most humans would ruefully admit that if the situa-

tions had been reversed, they would have taken advantage

in the same way.

EXAMPLE CITY: THREE FALLS

Set where three rivers spill over a short cliff into a large lake,

the city of Three Falls has become a center of commerce.

Travelers sail down the rivers on keelboats, buy and sell

their goods, then either boat back up whence they came,

transfer  to  a  different  river,  or  trade  with  communities

farther west on the shore of Silverfoam Lake.

Three Rivers is a thriving city of twenty thousand. It has

become the trading center for its region; everyone who can

afford the trip boats to the city to sell their goods, instead

of accepting a lower price somewhere else.

A free city, Three Rivers has its own shipyard, its own

government, and a small army to protect it from the hobgob-

lins and worg-riding goblins that live in the surrounding

woods. Spellcasters ock to Three Rivers because it has a

well-regarded school of magic where several master wizards

provide instruction to novices. Druids search the nearby

forests for herbs, and rangers hunt at the forest edge (with

either game or goblinoids as their quarry). Bards frequent

the citys taverns, learning new tales from those who have

traveled the area and singing songs for money and lodging.

Street  performers  delight  visitorsand  steal  from  the

unwary.

Most of Three Falls stands above the falls, arrayed on the

two spits of land between the rivers, and on the banks of

the two outer rivers as well. Each stretch of land is referred

to as a pier, with First Pier being the north shore of the

northernmost river and Fourth Pier the south shore of the

southernmost.

Strong stone walls surround the two outer piers, separat-

ing them from the forests that lurk just beyond bowshot on

either side. Iron-and-wood bridges, wide enough to drive a

wagon across, connect the piers to one another. Rope-and-

pulley systems raise and lower wooden platforms from First

and Fourth Piers to the surface of Silverfoam Lake at the

bottom of the falls. The citys residents have cut stairways

into the cliffsides, for the convenience of anyone unwilling

to chance using the platforms.

Whats  on  Each  Pier:  The  shipyards  run  along  First

Pier, as do sh markets and much of the citys transient

housing (occupied by sailors on shore leave).

Most trade and commerce occurs on Second Pier, the

site of the original trading post. Schools and shops cover

Third  Pier,  while  Fourth  Pier  is  mostly  permenent  resi-

dences. Additional homes stretch along both sides of the

lake, along with hotels and taverns. The newer residents

live down on the lakeshore, and visitors stay here unless

they can afford the pricier rooms up above. Because those

neighborhoods dont have the protection of walls, living

there is more dangerous than elsewhere in the city.

City Government

Almost everything can be found in Three Falls except for

royalty. The town does not lie within any kingdom, so it

owes loyalty to no one but its own citizens. Its status as a

free city is another reason some visitors prefer it to other

locales. As long as a visitor abides by the citys laws and

causes  no  trouble,  he  is  free  to  pursue  his  interests,  no

matter what his religion, race, or occupation.

Retired merchants comprise most of the city council,

and their only interest is in maintaining the status quo.

They want to bequeath an independent, thriving city to

their successors, so theyll listen keenly to information

about  threats  to  Three  Falls.  But  theyre  unwilling  to

involve Three Falls in the affairs of the larger world, and

they wont undertake decisive but risky efforts (such as

dislodging the goblinoids from the surrounding forest).

The council mostly takes an advisory role, choosing one

of its number to take the post of mayor and handle the

day-to-day administration of the city.

Three Falls stays free of outside domination and inward

disorder thanks to its well-trained militia, which numbers

more than two thousand troops. In a citywide emergency,

Three  Falls  can  call  on  security  details  from  the  major

merchant houses and rough-and-tumble sailors from the

less reputable ships in the harbor. Those forces together

can add nearly a thousand soldiers to the defense of the

city.

Three Falls History

A pair of brothers, Chad and Thom Tetherlee, and their

partner Willem Olander, founded Three Falls. The three

men  were  traders  themselves,  but  had  grown  tired  of

constant travel and wanted to open a trading post. They

had sailed up one of the rivers before, and now came down

a  second  one.  The  location  made  sense,  and  they  set  to

work, constructing a crude log cabin between two of the

rivers. But the real key to their plan was the rope bridges

the men stretched across each of the three rivers, so that

traders could reach the cabin no matter which bank they

landed upon. The trading post became an instant success,

and  within  the  year  the  three  men  were  married  and

building houses behind the post itself. A hunter settled

there next, arranging to give the trading post a deal on

the food he caught in return for land for his own home.

Then came a man and his two sons,

who built and repaired boats. And the

town continued to grow.

Soon the growing settlement came

into  contactand  conictwith  a

hobgoblin tribe that had always caught

sh from the rivers just above the falls. The

humans  drove  off  the  hobgoblins,  but  the

hobgoblins still regard the clifftops as right-

fully theirs, and they periodically attack

the city or menace the keelboat traf-

c along one of the rivers.

Three Falls Locations

The following places are well known

to  all  the  citys  residents,  and  any  of  them  can

provide directions to visitors trying to get from one loca-

tion to another.

The Old Post: The original trading post still exists, two

blocks  from  the  falls  in  the  center  of  Second  Pier.  This

small, plain stone building has become a popular bar, where

merchants often discuss business over ale. Travelers looking

to sell goods often head to the Old Post rst and announce

what they have before sitting at a tableinterested parties

then approach them to discuss terms.

Adventurers often use the Old Post as a convenient meet-

ing place, because its easy to get to and everyone knows

where it is. It also functions as an impromptu hiring hall

for  patrons  who  need  specialized  labor  (adventurers,  in

other words).

City  Hall:  This  large,  impressive  stone  building  sits

along  the  edge  of  Third  Pier,  looking  out  over  the  falls.

The city council meets here, and the mayors ofces occupy

much of the second oor. Anyone arrested by the town

guard is brought to City Hall for trial and sentencing.

Trials are typically fair if somewhat rushed; Three Falls

courts deal with so many disputes among merchants that

criminal matters get shunted aside unless theyre particu-

larly notorious or spectacular.

Stockade (The Quiet): Just behind City Hall is a long,

low stone building. This is the Stockade, the city jail and

home of the town guard. A barracks is located in the back of

the building, while the front has jail cells and the captains

ofce. Residents consider themselves lucky if they never

see the inside of this building.

Three Falls residents refer to the stockade as the quiet

because its walls are reputedly so thick that its the only

place in the city where you cant hear the dull roar of the

waterfalls.  A  city  resident  might  complain,  The  watch

caught me being drunk and disorderly in Fourth Pier, so

I had to spend three days in the quiet.

Wizards  Tower:  A  tall,  square  stone  tower  near  the

far end of Third Pier is home to the local wizards guild,

and also its school. Would-be wizards travel to Three Falls

seeking training, but the towers leadership accepts only a

handful as students.

Some city residents worry about

having marginally trained stu-

dent wizards in their midst.

Others  point  out  that  the

school  provides  an  excellent

defense against anything sail-

ing down the river, and that it

is far better to have wizards on

your side than against you.

The  tower  is  more  than

a place of learning. As with

most  institutions  in  Three

Falls, the wizards tower takes

an active hand in commercial activ-

ity. Spellbooks, rare spell components, potions, and scrolls

are  all  available  for  purchase  at  the  tower  (with  an  80%

chance of any item worth 500 gp or less being available).

Shipyards: The shipyards (and ancillary shops that braid

rope and sew sails) cover much of First Pier. Everyone in

the region knows that Three Falls produces the best boats,

and merchants buy or lease their ships here. Workshops on

the clifftops build the ships parts, which are then lowered

to the docks on the pulley platforms for nal assembly.

Sailors gather in the Rusty Anchor tavern alongside the

shipyards,  some  hoping  to  join  the  crew  of  a  merchant

keelboat and others drinking up their share of the prots

from a merchant voyage.

First  Pier  is  a  rough-and-tumble  neighborhood  with

its share of street crime. The biggest dangers for unwary

visitors are the press gangs that roam the shipyard streets

and alleyways at night. After subduing unlucky passersby

with saps and clubs, the gangs deliver unconscious victims

1

to ships docked below the falls. By the time the victims

wake up, theyre in the middle of Silverfoam Lake on their

way to a far-off landhaving involuntarily joined the crew

of a ship.

Foaming Tankard: The most popular inn downside, as

the area along the lake is called, is the Foaming Tankard.

This large, comfortable tavern provides clean rooms, good

ale, good food, and the latest gossip from up and down the

rivers. Bards make this their rst stop upon arrival and vie

for the right to play an evening in the taproom.

Free Market: Established merchants and craftsfolk have

shops  and  warehouses,  but  many  vendors  cannot  afford

such  places,  or  they  make  such  infrequent  visits  that  it

is  not  worth  buying  a  shop.  Instead,  they  gather  in  the

Free Market, a large open-air bazaar in Second Pier east of

the Old Post. Here anyone can claim a space and spread a

blanket on the ground, or erect a wooden stand, and show

his wares. The town guards insist that vendors leave room

to walk between displays and make sure no trouble occurs.

Anyone who obeys these rules can sell freely here.

Someone who does well at the Free Market might wind

up buying or renting a permanent stand along the edge

of the market. The stands cost morenot just in rent but

because  the  city  assesses  taxes  on  those  who  sell  from

xed structures. Despite the extra cost, the permanent

stands are a good deal because customers can more easily

nd a merchant with a specic location amid the tumult

of the market.

Items worth up to 300 gp are generally available at the

Free Market, but it takes a DC 20 Gather Information to

nd someone  to buy or sell the exact item youre interested

in.

Three Falls Personalities

The following denizens of the city are likely contacts and

patrons  for  adventurers  who  use  Three  Falls  as  a  home

base.

Master Nathan Olander: The Tetherlee and Olander

families are still the citys leading citizens, both because

their  ancestors  founded  Three  Falls  and  because  the

families often produce hard-working, charismatic people.

The current Master Olander (male human aristocrat 10)

is no exception. He is serving his third term as the citys

mayor and chief magistrate. The mayor is well liked by

visitors and residents alike because he has a reputation

as someone who can cut through red tape and mediate a

thorny dispute.

Olanders  family  is  rich  and  still  owns  several  valu-

able  spots  in  the  city,  but  the  mayor  shows  no  interest

in increasing that wealth. Instead, Olanders focus is on

keeping  Three  Falls  clean  and  safe,  its  citizens  happy

and  prosperous.  He  is  openly  dismissive  of  the  threat

posed  by  the  goblinoids  in  the  forests.  While  Olander

occasionally  worries  about  the  hobgoblins,  he  realizes

the importance of maintaining the citizens condence

in the city administration, so he makes a show of being

unconcerned with hobgoblin raids or similar threats.

Alastair Lim: Jonathan Lim and his sons Van and Ben

founded the shipyards after they got permission from the

Tetherlee brothers and Willem Olander to settle near their

trading post. Since then, the shipyards have grown to cover

most of First Pier and have become one of the citys most

successful industries. Alastair Lim (male human expert 10)

owns and operates the largest shipbuilding company in the

city, Lim Yards, and is the de facto master of the shipyards

in general.

Lim has no ofcial authority over his peers, but when

he  gives  a  command,  they  obey.  Perhaps  this  is  because

his  family  founded  the  shipyards.  Perhaps  it  is  because

his business is still the largest and most successful. Or it

may be because Lim, a big, burly man with massive scarred

hands and a thick black beard, could crush any of them as

easily as he pounds nails into planks.

News of any venture involving waterborne travel into

or out of Three Falls eventually reaches Lims desk, so he

often hires freelance adventurers to tackle problems such

as  piracy  on  the  western  shores  of  the  lake  or  banditry

farther up one of the rivers.

Geryn and Molly Banon: This cheerful couple owns

and runs the Foaming Tankard. Both are friendly, consider-

ate of their guests, and protective of their patrons. Geryn

(male human expert 3) is a tall, lanky man with a slow smile

and a dry wit, while his wife Molly (female human expert

3) is short and round, and loves to laugh.

Two aspects of the city the Banons have little patience for

is the red tape of City Hall and the Stockade (where Molly

served a few short sentences as a younger girl). If the PCs

need a safe refuge from the city watch, Geryn and Molly

will happily provide it.

Lissandra:  Two  decades  ago,  a  tall,  slender  woman

with snow-white hair arrived in Twin Falls and made her

way to the wizards tower. She was admitted immediately

and became one of the instructors. Since then, Lissandra

(female human wizard 13) has become the mistress of the

tower and head of the local guild. She rarely exits the tower

except to buy food at the market, and though she is always

polite, her quiet tone and piercing green eyes terrify people.

Those who have trained under her say that she is a wizard

of great power, and a demanding but fair instructor.

Captain Tonalsin: Oleg Tonalsin (male human ghter

12)  is  the  captain  of  the  town  guard.  He  has  held  this

post for four years, and will most likely keep it until he is

too old to wear a sword. Everyone likes Tonalsina tall,

broad-shouldered man with a thick brown beard and hair

to match, he is quiet but pleasant, and prefers talking to

ghting. This does not mean he cannot ght, as drunks

and villains can attest, but he always tries to settle disputes

peacefully rst.

Unlike  the  rest  of  the  citys  leadership,  Tonalsin  is

openly worried about the goblins and hobgoblins in the

surrounding  forest.  Some  rangers  have  reported  seeing

larger groups of goblinoids at the forest edge, which might

mean the hobgoblins are preparing to sack Three Rivers

and reclaim the clifftops for themselves.

CREATING HUMAN

CHARACTERS

Humans get no bonuses to their ability scores, no special

qualities  such  as  darkvision,  and  no  other  special  abili-

ties. But theyre still one of the most popular races to play

because they begin play with a free feat and 4 more skill

points than those of other races, and they get an extra 1

skill point every level after that. In addition, their versatility

means that humans can choose any class as their favored

class. Humans also have the advantage that, being so ubiqui-

tous, their presence is accepted (or at least tolerated) almost

anywhere, thus lessening any initial racial stigmas.

SPECIAL HUMAN OPTIONS

As a human character, you qualify for some human-specic

feats and prestige classes unavailable to PCs of other races,

all described in Chapters 5 and 6 of this book.

Feats: Able Learner, Fearless Destiny, Heroic Destiny,

Protected Destiny.

Prestige Classes: Chameleon, urban soul.

HUMANS AS CHARACTERS

Humans  are  the  ultimate  generalists.  They  dont  have  a

specic favored class, and none of their ability scores are

penalized.

Bard: Bards are common among human cultures with

a rich oral tradition, but since music and storytelling are

part of every culture, they can be found almost anywhere.

Human bards excel at greasing the wheels in social situ-

ations and make excellent negotiators and arbiters when

dealing with other races. Human bards tend to be accom-

plished travelers and true multiculturalists, comfortable

in a number of human and nonhuman societies.

Barbarian:  Human  barbarians  wander  some  of  the

most far-ung reaches of the world. Cut off from the rest

of civilization, these hardy individuals live by sheer tenac-

ity  and  strength.  Depending  on  their  relationship  with

other neighboring races, barbarians may be either more

open-minded (respecting any race that is tough enough to

survive) or extremely xenophobic and suspicious of strang-

ers. Unlike barbarians of other races who frequently reject

civilization,  human  barbarians  often  display  a  childlike

fascination  for  the  trappings  of  civilization,  such  as  tall

buildings, rened entertainments, and the sheer number

of people crowded into the typical human city.

Cleric: Considering the zeal with which humans revere

their deities, clerics are common. Human clerics worship

the entire gamut of deities, from the benevolent to the vile.

Clerics serve as the backbone of any community, tending

to their ocks with faith and wisdom as their tools.

Druid: Humans are sometimes drawn to the power and

majesty of raw nature, learning its secrets and protecting

it from harm. Some gain grudging respect from elves and

other forest dwellers due to their commitment to the natu-

ral world. Many human druids are rebels against their own

race, trying to undo the encroachment of other humans

into pristine wilderness.

Fighter: From the dashing knight to the stalwart man-

at-arms, human ghters are both common and respected.

Thanks to their extra feat at 1st level, human ghters know

more tricks than ghters of other races, and they play up

that advantage on the battleeld. Many ghters learned the

rudiments of combat in a national army or local militia.

Monk: The sheer variety of human cultures is fertile

soil for the esoteric mental and physical disciplines that

are a monks bread and butter. The extra feat gained at 1st

level helps a human monk create her own style of martial

arts.

Paladin: The human paladin channels her ambition and

aggression into a drive to undertake dangerous quests and

protect the helpless from the evil. Most human paladins

worship Heironeous or St. Cuthbert.

Ranger: Stealthy scouts and determined hunters, human

rangers stalk the wilderness. More comfortable away from

others, rangers may look down on their city-dwelling kin

and revere those races that live a natural lifestyle. Rangers

are often happiest on the frontier, where they can ply their

skills on behalf of civilization without having to live in

it.  A  human  ranger  is  always  moving  forward,  pushing

against the edges of the map and nding new lands for

others to settle.

Rogue: While not as inherently stealthy or nimble as

rogues of some other races, human rogues enjoy additional

skill  points  that  prove  invaluable.  Some  human  rogues

remain  generalists,  while  others  choose  a  specialty  on

which to focuspicking pockets, second-story work, or

glib con artist, for example. Such rogues are particularly

at home in the large cities and metropolises where many

humans live.

Sorcerer: Humans were the rst to claim that sorcerers

have draconic blood owing in their veins. Charismatic

and  ashy,  human  sorcerers  often  consider  themselves

better than those around them, regardless of race, class,

or social status.

Wizard: Despite their youth as a race and their individu-

ally short life spans, humans make good wizards through

determination,  tenacity,  and  devotion.  Because  of  their

additional feat, human wizards can quickly concentrate on

some aspect of magic, making it truly their own. Because

wizards typically have high Intelligence scores, a human

wizard will often have a truly prodigious number of skill

points to spend.

Half-elves stand with one foot in each of two cultures:

an  elf  society  rich  with  history  and  tradition,  and  a

human  society  vibrant  and  everchanging.  Over  time,

half-elves become adept at shifting gears and reconciling

the two halves of their heritage.

Half-orcs, on the other, are reviled and despised by

orcs (who think theyre too weak) and humans (who

think they theyre too brutish). These creatures are the

butt of jokes, the target of insults, and the subject of

frequent discrimination and senseless attacks. And

all  the  negative  attention  is  because  of  something

the half-orc cant change: his heritage.

Despite  this  obstacle,  half-orcs  survive.  Many

people assume that only a handful of half-orcs exist,

but in fact a large number of them roam the world,

searching in vain for a place that accepts them for

who  they  are,  rather  than  hating  them  for  their

basic nature.

33

n the D&D world, both half-elves and half-orcs stretch

the  normal  denitions  of  race.  Neither  has  its  own

unique culture, instead straddling two disparate societ-

ies. Half-elves and half-orcs react to their dual heritage

in different ways. Half-elves try to achieve a balance between

their elf blood and their human blood, but half-orcs reject

both orcs and humansoften because orcs and humans

reject them. A half-elf expends a great deal of effort trying

to t in despite her hybrid nature. A half-orc expends just as

much effort making his own way in the world and keeping

society at arms length.

Half-elves  and  half-orcs  rarely  live  in  homogeneous

communities of their brethren. A few live among elves or

orcs, respectively, but more often they live among humans,

either as a racial minority or in a community of similar

mixed-blood  outcasts.  They  rarely  feel  at  home  among

humans, because the elf or orc blood running through

their veins can never be completely denied. Even a half-

elf or half-orc raised among humans from birth has an

outlook on life colored by his or her racial heritage.

Races of Destiny focuses on how these two hybrid races

interact with their human side, especially for half-elves

and half-orcs who grew up in a human society. This chapter

describes  how  half-elves  and  half-orcs  compare  to  and

contrast with the rest of humanity

THE HALF-ELF:

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Guild advisor Tal Remar was already awake when the morn-

ing  passed  through  the  intricate  latticework  screen  that

blocked his view of the provincial capital. As he dressed,

the young regent read the various reports that scattered his

desk. Barbarians were raiding caravans to the far east, and

the insipid chamberlain was again demanding that taxes

be lowered in three territories.

He casually scooped up a healthy portion of exquisite

fruit that overowed from the bowl that sat on the desk.

He ignored the human serving girl who quietly came out of

the dark corner in which she was standing and cleaned up

the mess that he left behind. Time to meet with his uncle,

a representative from the elf nations.

After sitting through an hour of rigorously polite greet-

ings  and  another  hour  of  his  uncles  assessment  of  the

current diplomatic crisis, Tal Remar nally had a chance to

speak. It seems to me, honored uncle, that youre expecting

the humans to exhibit more patience than theyve shown,

Tal said. You can wait decades to get the answer you want

from the king, but your human counterparts will be dead

and gone before that happens. Thats why you think theyre

pressing the issue. They just want it resolved before they

reach their dotage.

Tal  and  his  uncle  spoke  for  another  hour,  sharing

anecdotes about the madcap speed of human affairs, then

the elf departed to his embassy while Tal returned to his

ofce. Turning to his service girl, he exclaimed, Why does

diplomacy always take so long? I spent the whole morning

in a conversation that could have taken ve minutes!

The serving girl shrugged as Tal said, How frustrating.

Perhaps  the  gentlemens  dueling  club  will  provide  more

fast-paced diversions this afternoon.

HALF-ELF PSYCHOLOGY

Central to half-elf psychology is the drive to bring disparate

characteristics together. Half-elves are natural uniters and

mediators. The desire for synthesis and unity is strong in a

half-elf, whether he is trying to broker an agreement with

a bitter rival or attempting to reconcile his elf and human

heritages.

AGE CONFUSION IN CHILDHOOD

Half-elves lead difcult childhoods, regardless of whom

they were raised with. A half-elf brought up among humans

ages both physically and emotionally slower than his peers.

While  he  may  appear  to  be  mature  in  body,  a  teenage

half-elf may still retain the worldview of a much younger

child.

That  difference  puts  his  parents  or  other  caregivers

in a dilemma: With whom does a half-elf child play and

learn? If placed with his chronological peers, hell be the

smallest and most immature among themand the gap

will  grow  wider  with  each  passing  year.  On  the  other

hand,  raising  a  half-elf  child  with  his  developmental

peers means an achingly slow trip through childhood.

From the half-elfs perspective, human friend after human

friend matures quickly while the half-elf remains stuck

in place. For one or the other of these reasons, a half-elf

child often withdraws from the world, seeking solitude

where he can.

QUIET EXTERIOR, INNER TURMOIL

Once  a  half-elf  survives  his  lengthy  childhood  and

adolescence,  he  emerges  much  more  serene  and  poised

than those of many other racesat least on the surface.

Half-elves move with a uid grace and have an intuitive

knack for seeing the beauty in the everyday world. Like

elves, half-elves tend to be patient and take a long-term

view of the future. They are relatively unrufed by minor

setbacks, realizing that such difculties mean little in the

long  run.  Half-elves  show  more  of  an  interest  in  song,

poetry, and art than most humans. In a community that

respects bards, artists, or musicians, this afnity can be a

half-elfs ticket to social acceptance.

But in the half-elfs heart and mind, its a different story.

Human ambition and adaptability is in a constant tug-of-war

with the elfs patience and reverence for tradition. A half-

elf truly reaches adulthood when he comes to some sort of

accommodation with both halves of his nature. And when

that happens, the half-elf starts looking for other things to

mend, synthesize, and reunite.

THE FOREIGNER MENTALITY

To a human observer, the typical half-elf retains the aloof-

ness elves are known for. As a result, many humans consider

half-elves to be almost as haughty as elves. Some half-elves

who live among humans try to refute this attitude by taking

pains to demonstrate how laid back and approachable they

are. Those half-elves who succeed in making humans com-

fortable in their presence nd that their eloquence helps

them make their way in society.

Half-elves  have  a  hard  time  convincing  elves  to  treat

them with respect. Most elves regard half-elves as stocky,

clumsy, and lacking in the nuance and subtlety that elves

prize. Unless he is unusually bright and observant, a half-elf

always seems a little slower than usual among elves and may

be treated as slightly inferior. If tensions are high between

elves and humans, half-elves are often treated even worse,

sometimes seen as tainted or cursed.

Because of their mixed heritage, half-elves never truly

feel as though they belong to one race or the other. Among

both humans and elves, the half-elf adopts the persona of the

courteous foreigner: He speaks your language and wants to

respectfully partake of your customs. Hes knowledgeable

and fascinating, but youre unlikely to forget that hes from

somewhere else.

This foreigner mentality means that few half-elves are

shocked when they encounter a new and unusual culture.

Those  half-elves  who  embrace  civilization  become  true

cosmopolitans, sampling everything that life has to offer.

Their human blood gives them a zest for life, while their

elf side lets them appreciate it all the more.

THE HALF-ELF LIFE

Faced  with  trying  to  reconcile  their  presence  in  two

societies  that  dont  quite  mesh,  half-elves  sometimes

adopt  more  than  a  foreigners  mentality.  They  adopt  a

foreigners  lifestyle,  wandering  between  places  where

either they can hide their lineage in anonymity or where

an individuals heritage doesnt matter as much as it does

in other locales.

Half-elves generally adopt a middle position between the

energetic lifestyle of humans and the languid way of life of

the elves. Doing this is another way the half-elf reconciles

his dual nature, but this compromising posture also sets

him apart from the lifestyle and

the  outlook  of  both  his

parents.

LEISURE

Thanks to their long life span (compared to that of humans),

half-elves have the freedom to experiment with countless

forms of amusement over the years. Most turn to the arts

to  nd comfort, and in so doing they become collectors of

 ne works, creating magni cent exhibitions that combine

multiple media from different cultures.

Like elves, half-elves tend to focus intently on one disci-

pline and adhere to it or follow it exceedingly well. A half-elf

who collects rare porcelain, for example, will not be content

until he can  nd every single piece manufactured by a par-

ticular famous crafter. Wandering half-elves are content to

collect ephemeral objects, such as poems, songs, and works

of musicitems that can be carried along anywhere.

Half-elves also share the elves willingness to devote years

to a topic just to see if they are suited for it. A human might

blanch at the prospect of spending  ve years training to

be a painter, then deciding against the effort and putting

down  the  paintbrush  forever.  But  half-elves  have  longer

life spans and thus are inclined to

spend more time pursuing such

diversions.

Half-elves  enjoy  many  of  the

same  entertainment  forms  that

humans do. They like carousing

and gambling, but they  nd the

pleasures  of  such  diversions

all too  eeting. Half-elves also

get  a  great  deal  of  pleasure

from the same leisure pursuits

that elves enjoy, as long as they

can  muster  the  patience  for  the

leisurely pace and esoteric manner

that  elves  bring  to  their  playing

of games and their performance of

dramas and songs. Half-elves raised

by elves are particularly fond of elven

amusements,  and  they  long  for  the

elegance and beauty of elven leisure

activities once theyve been confronted

with  the  harsh  ugliness  that  occurs

outside their home realms.

Half-elves  shy  away  from  the  blood

sports that members of human cultures

participate in, especially those that involve

animals, such as bear baiting, cock ghting,

and dog  ghts. Most even  nd sport hunting

to  be  distasteful,  seeing  it  as  disrespectful

of the natural order of things and a waste of

precious resources. (Hunting for the sake of

subsistence or survival is part of the natural

order and is widely accepted or at least toler-

ated by half-elves.) Gladiatorial combat is also

viewed  with  disfavor,  since  many  half-elves

Half-elf craftwork takes a back seat to no other race

35

cannot  understand  why  humans  tolerate  violence  for

the  enrichment  of  gamblers  and  the  amusement  of  the

jaded.

Because  of  their  natural  inclination  toward  magic  as

well  as  their  penchant  for  social  skills,  many  half-elf

wizards and sorcerers use their magic to become perform-

ers,  blending  arcane  power  and  personal  persuasion  to

deliver spectacular entertainment. While they are not as

inherently talented at such activities as gnomes, half-elves

produce  subtle,  thought-provoking  displays  of  magical

artistry that can inspire the masses. Most of these magical

artists prefer to tailor their shows to the tastes of the audi-

ence, as opposed to creating a repertoire of amusements

and  diverions  that  they  never  deviate  from,  using  the

Gather Information skill to nd out what are the hottest

trends  or  which  themes  have  not  yet  been  explored  in

front  of  the  current  crowd.  Generally,  a  DC  20  Gather

Information check enables a performer to learn enough

about a potential audience to get a +2 circumstance bonus

on a subsequent Perform check.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Half-elves  have  an  inherent  propensity  for  creating

beautiful works of art. They have their elf blood to thank

for granting them a keen eye for seeing the majesty and

subtlety of the natural world and the renement to appreci-

ate it, while their human side gives them the energy and

drive to create with amazing speed and devotion. Some do

this for fame and wealth, while others create art for its own

sake,  helping  to  provide  an  outlet  for  other  frustrations

they  might  have  or  just  simply  to  while  away  the  years.

Half-elf artists have a long enough life span to be prolic,

tempered  with  a  human  sense  of  urgency  so  they  dont

linger overlong on a single project.

While half-elf artisans have mastered almost all artistic

endeavors,  most  become  true  masters  at  music,  poetry,

song,  or  danceespecially  if  they  grew  up  among  the

elves. Those with a magical bent have learned how to mix

their talents for song and visual art with the power of the

occult to create truly amazing works.

Humans nd half-elf bards particularly enjoyable, since

they add a sense of renement and a deep knowledge of

many subjects to their works.

In general, human audiences respond well to half-elves

because  they  have  the  exotic  mystery  of  elves  but  are

grounded in human experience. Viewing the performance

or the artistry of a half-elf is a way for humans to experi-

ence an elfs perspective without having to fully embrace

it. Critics have noted, however, that the art of half-elves

tends to possess a twinge of melancholy and longing that

is  difcult  to  articulate,  which  can  either  be  an  added

dimension  or  a  negative  trait,  depending  on  the  person

doing the viewing.

Elves tend to either love or hate art produced by half-

elves.  Some  elves  nd  half-elf  artwork  work  refreshing,

bold, and innovative, containing elements that are lacking

in the art of their people. Another camp nds half-elf art

crude,  distasteful,  and  lacking  in  subtlety  as  a  result  of

human inuence. A half-elf artist trying to impress elves

may cave in to the demands of his audience and toe the

line, or he may refuse to compromise, seeing such negative

opinions as less than visionary.

Half-elf  artisans  show  just  as  much  pride  and  skill  in

their work as any other talented artist. Thanks to the races

long-term  perspective,  items  produced  by  half-elves  are

built to last the ages (something that dwarves begrudgingly

admire), but are also designed with aesthetics in mind. A

half-elfs  patience  may  frustrate  a  human  customer  who

needs a particular item made in a hurry. On the other hand,

elves may not appreciate half-elf craftsmanship, seeing it as

rushed to completion. Art forms for which creation time

isnt an issue, such as improvised music, get high marks

from elves.

Like elves, half-elves prefer working with natural medi-

umswood, stone, and bark, as well as softer items, such

as cloth and paper. Half-elf craftsfolk are not known for

working with metals, although some of those who were

trained as blacksmiths among humans can produce elegant

works that incorporate uid, natural forms.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Because of the elf blood owing in their veins, most half-

elves nd connecting with arcane magic to be both easy

and natural. Many half-elves become powerful wizards

or  sorcerers,  especially  those  who  were  trained  among

other elves. Half-elves who were raised among humans

are noted for being adaptable and more accepting of new

ideas and magical forms.

Like elves, half-elves have a deep connection with the

natural world and are more able than members of many

other races to see the interrelation between life forms

and forces in nature. When confronted with a problem

that cannot be solved through mundane means, a half-elf

is  inclined to try to solve it through magical means or

by  taking  a  radically  different  approach.  Elves  marvel

at  how  a  half-elf  can  come  up  with  what  they  see  as  a

clearly elven innovation, while humans at the same time

are quick to attribute the new idea to human skill and

versatility.

Half-elf wizards are known to outnumber half-elf sorcer-

ers, primarily because of the propensity for those of elf

blood to intuitively understand the methods and forms of

wizardry. Half-elf wizards can attain incredible power and

demonstrate great diversity, thanks to their extended life

spans (compared to those of humans), their understand-

ing  of  the  natural  world,  and  their  innovative,  outside

the box thinking. Half-elves are more common among

the enrollees of human-dominated wizard schools than

among the schools of the elves, mainly because humans are

more willing to take chances and experiment than elves

are. Still, half-elves bring new insights and innovations

to elven magic, which despite thousands of years of use

still does not provide all the answers.

Wizardry  appeals  to  half-elves  for  another  reason:  its

a  good  synthesis  between  their  two  heritages.  A  half-elf

wizard  is  satis ed  whenever  he  can  combine  ancient  elf

lore with cutting-edge human research.

Half-elf sorcerers, although not as common as wizards,

appear with a frequency that gets notice among the arcane

community. In many ways, these sorcerers are at the top of

their profession, because sorcerers are naturally charismatic

and half-elves are naturally personable. If human sorcerers

are noted for their  amboyant, almost theatrical demeanor,

half-elves  are  just  as  intriguing  because  of  their  more

muted, yet intoxicatingly exotic auras and personalities.

Divine magic does not come as naturally to half-elves,

but there are numerous examples of a half-elf picking up

the  banner  of  a  particular  deitys  cause.  Half-elf  clerics

typically worship nature-oriented deities, such as Corellon

Larethian, Ehlonna, and, in rarer circumstances, Obad-Hai.

Half-elves  raised  among  humans  have  been  known  to

worship almost any of the human deities, especially Pelor,

Fharlanghn, and Olidammara.

Particularly rebellious half-elves worship a deity associated

with whatever society they arent part of (Corellon Larethian

among humans and Ehlonna among elves, for example). Many

half-elf clerics try to reconcile human and elf religious beliefs

by choosing no deity at all, but instead selecting domains

compatible with both human and elf goals.

Half-elf  druids  are  much  more  common  than  half-elf

clerics, mainly due to the connection that all half-elves have

to the natural world. Human and elf societies sometimes

force half-elves to live on their own in the deep forests of

the world, where they come to feel the power, majesty, and

danger that the wilderness offers. Half-elf druids usually

have  a  more  positive  attitude  toward  elves  than  toward

humans,  since  elves  show  much  more  respect  for  plants

and animals than humans do.

Technology  is  often  dif cult  for  half-elves  to  grasp.  If

raised  among  elves,  a  half-elf  views  mechanical  devices

with a suspicious, scornful eye, seeing them as a blight upon

the natural world. Among humans, a half-elf may be more

inclined to tinker with technology, or at least acknowledge

its existence, but few instances exist when half-elves have

fully  embraced  technology.  Half-elves  understand  that

technology has a great potential for making life easier for

those who use it, but they seem to subconsciously overlook

its relevance to their daily lives, regarding it as yet another

weapon that can be abused in the future by those who

dont appreciate how technology ought to be used.

A half-elf wizard uses his magical and technological aptitude at the same time

37

That said, some half-elves buck the stereotype and study

the  edgling sciences of technology with the same zeal

that half-elf artists and bards study song, painting, and

dance. Again, blessed with a longer life span than humans,

half-elves who study or design items of technology can

produce  amazing  creations.  Like  anything  else  they

create, technological devices manufactured by half-elves

are  often  a  wonderful  blend  of  practicality  and  beauty.

Artisans often attempt to create objects of technology that

not only function properly, but have little impact on the

surrounding terrain.

HALF-ELVES AT WAR

In general, half-elves see war as a necessary evil that

should be confronted promptly in order to get it over

with. A half-elf at war strives to combine human ef -

ciency with elven grace. The result, embodied in a

half-elf who is properly trained and equipped for

war, is a combatant with an austere  ghting style

that wastes no movement and dispassionately

dispatches foe after foe.

Half-elves  learn  martial  techniques  and

receive training in whatever military traditions

are prominent in their home society. Elves are

trained from an early age (relatively speaking)

in how to handle a blade and a bow; most half-

elves receive the same training. The techniques of

the  elves  emphasize  quick,  darting  moves,  rapid

swordplay,  and  hit-and-run  tactics  that  take  advantage

of their keen senses, quickness, and reaction time. While

half-elves are not as dextrous as full-blooded elves, they

do their best to emulate these tactics.

Half-elves who are a part of an elf army are generally

relegated  to  the  front  ranks,  where  their  hardier  nature

and their greater bulk (compared to elves) allows them to

stay in the  ght longer, while their more nimble kinfolk

pepper foes with arrows and strike from the  anks. Half-

elves may resent this treatment, seeing themselves thought

of as tainted half-breeds that are pressed into service in the

most dangerous area of the battle eld.

If  raised  among  humans,  a  half-elf  learns  the  tactics

of warfare common in that  society. It should be noted,

however, that even if a human societys view on combat

emphasizes brute force and blunt attacks, a half-elf still

retains  the  gracefulness  derived  from  his  elf  blood.  If

half-elves  are  common  in  a  human-dominated  army,

they  nd their niche in roles that use quick strikes and

stealthscouts, skirmishers, and snipers.

Half-elf  spellcasters,  particularly  sorcerers,  emulate

the same hit-and-run tactics, but using a barrage of spells

rather than arrows. Half-elf spellcasters in the employ of

elves make extensive use of sleep spells and enchantments,

which they can employ without fear of affecting themselves

or their comrades.

This half-elf ranger

uses terrain to his

advantage in a

con ict with

enemies

Because

they  wander  so

much and associ-

ate  with  so  many  other

races, half-elves can be found in the

ranks of other races armies as well. Half-elf mercenaries

are common, drifting from country to  country on the tides

of war. More than a few half-elves have fought alongside

gnomes, hal ings, or more exotic allies. Elves or humans

may  balk  at  these  alliances,  but  half-elves  merely  shrug

and af rm that they are willing to  ght for any group that

accepts them for who they are. Dwarves are the least likely

race to employ half-elves, but some clans appreciate their

value as scouts and skirmishers.

Due to their propensity for guerilla warfare, half-elves

have trouble understanding the role of machines of war in

combat and may underestimate their use and power.

Roleplaying  Application:  Consider  your  characters

attitude  toward  organized  warfare.  What  major  wars

occurred during your characters lifetime? Has she expe-

rienced war as a soldier or a civilian? Consider also how

your  character  feels  about  soldiers  who  wage  war  for  a

living, and about monarchs who order others into battle

from the safety of their royal fortresses.

HALF-ELF SOCIETY

AND CULTURE

Half-elves naturally sit astride two cultures: the inven-

tive, ambitious societies of the humans, and the sedate,

ancient communities of the elves. Within either society,

half-elves  make  for  themselves  a  sort  of  cultural  com-

promise,  blending  the  traditions  of  their  dual  heritage

as best they can.

In  most  cases,  half-elves  express  their  dual  nature  by

 tting  in  when  they  can  and  incorporating  the  best  as-

pects  of  both  cultures  when  they  cant.  They  arent  just

trying to reconcile the two halves of their own psyche,

theyre trying to harmonize and synthesize

the members of any two groups who are

estranged  from  each  other.  Half-

elves raised among humansa

majority of the raceact more

like elves, demonstrating re-

 nement  and  a  love  of  the

arts.  When  half-elves  live

among  elves,  theyre  often

the most ambitious, activist

members  of  their  commu-

nities.  Half-elves  thus  form

a  bridge  between  human  and

elf  cultures,  offering  both  a

familiar  face  and  some  exotic

behavioral tendencies.

One  way  in  which  half-elves

emphasize  their  dual  heritage  is

by  taking  a  name  that  re ects

the absent part of their ancestry.

A  half-elf  among  humans  often

takes  an  elf  name,  while  one

living with elves takes a name

following the human custom.

The resulting foreign-sound-

ing  name  reminds  both  a

half-elf and those around

him that he and other half-

elves stand a half-step apart

from the rest of  society.

A few half-elves live in small

communities composed entire-

ly of their fellow half-elves. Such communities

often spring from racially segregated neigh-

borhoods in teeming metropolises or large

family settlements that grow into villages.

When two half-elves breed, the progeny

is  another  half-elf,  so  these  communi-

ties can sustain themselves inde nitely.

Half-elf  communities  generally  follow

human traditions and are located in human

lands. However, more xenophobic elf societ-

Many half-elves give

up on  tting in with

elves and strike out

on their own instead

ies might have  settlements of exiled half-elves just outside

their borders, and the members of a few half-elf communi-

ties reject both human and elf mores in favor of developing

an exotic culture unique to themselves.

HALF-ELVES AND

OTHER RACES

Fitting in everywhere and yet never quite belonging, half-

elves  have  interaction  with  other  races  that  depends  on

understanding and compromise. Most half-elves do their

best  to   t  in  well  with  whatever  society

they live in, but they are continually re-

minded of how different they

are.  A  few  half-elves  resent

the  customs  and  traditions

of  their  host  society,  but

most embrace new expe-

riences  and  try  to  relate

them  to  something  more

familiar.

Dwarves:  Half-

elves  generally  view

dwarves as in exible and

incapable  of  compro-

mise, and they cant

understand  why

dwarves  cant  ne-

gotiate and experiment

more.  However,  some  as-

pects of dwarf society appeal

to half-elves. Dwarves are

more understanding of the

long view than humans

are, and theyre nowhere

near  as  pretentious  as

elves are.

Dwarves, in turn, see

half-elves as victims of

bad  breeding,  with  a

heritage  that  encompasses

both the elves frivolity and the

humans  arrogance.  Dwarves  have  a

hard  time  understanding  the  wander-

lust that takes hold of many half-elves.

Wise dwarves know that half-elves make

acceptable intermediaries between antago-

nistic bands of dwarves and elves, helping

to foster a spirit of cooperation when a

crisis threatens both races.

Elves: Half-elves have complex emo-

tional reactions when it comes to their

elf kin. If raised among elves, a half-elf of-

ten has to cope with the paternalistic attitude

or outright condescension that comes from elves

who  have  disdain  for  the  half-elfs  young  chronological

age. Many half-elves react to this treatment with jealousy

and bitterness. Some try to overcompensate by acting as

mature and elike as possible, voraciously learning the

intricacies of the culture to the best of their ability. Oth-

er  half-elves  never  overcome  their  feelings  of  inferiority

and end up abandoning their elf kin, regarding them with

loathing and spite.

Most half-elves strive for the middle ground, learning

from and respecting their elf heritage while understanding

that they will never truly belong to it. These individuals

are usually lled with wanderlust, going off to explore the

world but occasionally coming back to reconnect with the

beautiful, serene lifestyle of the elves.

Goliaths:  Half-elves  have  a  mildly  positive  attitude

toward  goliaths  (a  new  race  described  in  Races  of  Stone).

Although  they  are  justiably  somewhat  intimidated  by

the  physical  prowess  of  these  humanoids,  they  can  also

see beneath the goliaths primitive demeanor to nd a rich

culture and deep respect for the world in which the goliaths

live.  Some  half-elves  are  content  to  live  among  tribes  of

goliaths, who view half-elves as only short rather than of

mixed blood.

Gnomes: Half-elves have a favorable view toward gnomes,

enjoying their spirit and zeal for life. Gnomes are generally

quick to overlook a half-elfs mixed heritage, regarding it as

a nonissue. As long as the half-elf is friendly, helpful, and

can take a joke, who cares who his parents were?

Half-elves who leave the homes of their elf or human

parents often nd refuge in the small villages and warrens

of the gnomes, who welcome them with open arms. Half-

elves enjoy the chance to join such a community, even if

they must contend with stooping and crouching most of

the time.

Half-orcs:  Half-elves  show  a  marked  disfavor  toward

half-orcs, at least partly because their parallel heritage hits

uncomfortably close to home. Half-orcs think that half-

elves are too cowardly to make their own way in the world,

and that theyre continually pretending to be something

they arent.

Both elves and humans have serious conicts with orcs,

so half-elves retain this sense of suspicion and distrust. In

addition, the marked difference in the social renement

of the two races makes half-elves feel superior to half-orcs.

Many half-elves think that they got the best traits of both

races, while half-orcs received the worst.

A few half-elves overcome this prejudice and realize that

they and half-orcs have much in common. Both groups are

stigmatized and distrusted, after all.

Halings: Much like gnomes, halings are good partners

for half-elves because halings overlook the mixed-blood

issue. Half-elves understand and appreciate the nomadic

lifestyle of many halings, and some spend years traveling

with a haling clan as it explores new territory. Relatively

short and slender themselves, half-elves do not pay much

attention to the unimposing stature of halings. Half-elves

admire the traits that make halings experts at survival and

capable of standing up to adversity with a grin.

Humans: Just as humans have mixed views on half-elves,

so do half-elves have widely varying opinions of humans. A

half-elfs particular attitude toward humanity depends on the

culture in which he was raised. If he was accepted into the

culture, hell probably have a positive view toward humans.

If he was treated harshly, his attitude will be much more

negative and resentful. Even a half-elf who is entirely accept-

ing of human society and customs can feel the difference

between himself and his full-blooded human kin. Half-elves

admire humanitys passion, drive, and sense of adventure,

but they are dismayed by its shortsightedness, propensity

for violence, and tendency toward xenophobia. Half-elves

become impromptu ambassadors in human lands (whether

they want to or not) due to their natural social skills. They

strive  to  smooth  the  ground  between  humans  and  other

races, if only so that they can continue to survive.

Illumians: Half-elves share a kinship with illumians (a

new race described in Chapter 3) because each race is out-

wardly human but inwardly quite different from humans.

The illumians ongoing experiments in becoming the living

embodiment of a magical language are fascinating to most

half-elves.

HALF-ELVES: NATURAL NEGOTIATORS

Thanks to their racial bonuses on Diplomacy and Gather Infor-

mation  checks,  half-elves  naturally  fill  the  roles  of  negotiator,

arbiter, and diplomat. Lacking a society and culture of their own,

half-elves naturally take to straddling the boundary between dif-

ferent groups, using their skills and grace to smooth out prob-

lems and hostilities. While this status would seem a natural for

a prestige class, you can instead apply the respect granted to a

negotiator as a racewide trait.

As an option, you can decide that half-elves have an elevated

status among both humans and elves if they take up the mantle

of negotiator. Negotiators may come from any class, but should

have  the  maximum  number  of  ranks  possible  in  Diplomacy,

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Gather  Information,  and  Sense  Motive.  Obviously,  members

of socially focused classes such as bard or rogue work best as

negotiators,  but  some  cultures  distrust  these  kinds  of  people

and  have  greater  respect  for  clerics  or  fighters.  In  addition  to

having the requisite skills, negotiators must be decidedly neutral

and must not swear an allegiance to either side. Some of these

negotiators  travel  throughout  the  land,  lending  their  services

where they are needed.

A negotiator in a group of adventurers will shine best at times

when she can use her skills to talk out and solve problems. You

do not have to limit the use of these skills to urban settingsa

negotiator in the thick of the wild may be well respected by a

band of hobgoblins.

HALF-ELF RELIGION

For half-elves, where they grew up determines who they

worship. Half-elves raised by elves tend to worship Corel-

lon Larethian. Those raised by humans worship one of the

human  deities,  often  Ehlonna,  Fharlanghn,  Boccob,  or

Olidammara.

At the same time, half-elves know they were born of two

worlds, so the religious traditions of the other half of their

heritage pull at them strongly. Many half-elves go through

a crisis of allegiance at some point in their lives, and some

convert to the worship of a different deity at that time. Many

of  Ehlonnas  half-elf  clerics  grew  up  sending  prayers  to

Corellon Larethian, for example, but their natural curiosity

about human deities later led them to Ehlonna, and after

much soul-searching, they pledged their allegiance to the

Lady of the Woodlands. Even those who resist the lure of

changing religions are apt to learn quite a bit about the faiths

of both elves and humans, which helps to make them feel

at home with both human and elf religious traditions.

HALF-ELF HISTORY

AND FOLKLORE

Half-elves have no great nations to call their own, and few

myths and legends of any importance. They tend to be avid

storytellers, however, regaling audiences with fables and

folklore from both elf and human traditions.

Half-elves often share a story from the exotic half of their

nature. In a group of humans, a half-elf will tell the tale of

how Corellon Larethian shot out Gruumshs eye. Elves will

instead get a retelling of Lakeem and the Lure of the Sea

(a human legend described on page 24).

HALF-ELF LANGUAGE

Half-elves are naturally bilingual, speaking both Common

and Elven, but their prociency with Elven isnt as perfect

as that of an elf. A bit of human accent often creeps into a

half-elfs speech patterns, and any elf can notice a trace of

half-Elven dialect in a half-elf speaker who utters more than

a few sentences. It generally takes a DC 15 Disguise check

for a half-elf posing as an elf to mask his accent.

Half-elves speak Common perfectly, and many have a love

of the language that leads them to become accomplished

orators or authors. Many half-elves take up the life of a bard,

and  the  best  among  them  speak  Common  better  than  a

full-blooded human.

HALF-ELF SETTLEMENTS

Half-elves take pride in tting into whatever community

they nd themselves in; as a result, segregated communities

dominated by half-elves are rare. Its much more common to

nd a half-elf cousin living with an elf family in a treetop

village, or a half-elf minstrel plying his trade along a river

route dotted with human towns.

When half-elf communities exist, they tend to be very

small, and theyre usually created at the behest of someone

else. A human tyrant might move all the half-elf residents

of a city into a ghetto neighborhood, or an elf community

obsessed  with  purity  might  send  all  the  half-elves  in

the area to exile at the edge of the forest. Occasionally, a

persuasive half-elf manages to gather a crowd of half-elves

into a community with promises of creating a home where

all of them will truly t in.

CREATING HALF-ELF

CHARACTERS

Half-elf is a good choice for your characters race if you know

youre going to be interacting with NPCs in ways other than

showing them the end of your sword. Half-elves are natural

negotiators and diplomats, and youll have a racial edge when

you try to pump the bartender for information or convince

the dragon to let you and your friends pass by.

That  choice  doesnt  necessarily  mean  that  rogue  and

bard are the classes for you, or that you have to spend a lot

of skill points on Diplomacy and Gather Information. You

can  just as easily play a  half-elf ghter whos  just  a  little

more articulate than most ghters, or a half-elf wizard who

blends in better than most of his compatriots of other races.

As long as you want your character to enjoy conversing with

NPCs, half-elf is a solid choice for race no matter what class

you pursue.

HALF-ELVES AS CHARACTERS

Like humans, half-elves have many options available to them

when determining class. Because of their elf blood, many

half-elves become wizards, although most such characters

also  have  levels  in  one  or  more  other  classes.  Half-elves

have  a  natural  social  grace  that  allows  them  to  excel  in

interpersonal situations, and as such many half-elves are

drawn  to  the  ranks  of  the  bards.  Half-elf  sorcerers  also

gain benets to the use of certain social skills, which are

made all that more potent if such a character has a high

Charisma score.

No  matter  which  class  you  choose,  consider  spending

some skill points on Diplomacy and Gather Information,

even if they are cross-class skills for you. Because of the

racial bonuses you already receive for choosing this race,

youll be all the better off after adding even a few skill points.

Half-elves  are  naturally  regarded  as  excellent  spokesper-

sons and may be forced into that role, even if they are not

prepared for it.

Barbarian: Half-elves who grow up in far-ung lands

that offer little in the way of civilization often learn the

ways of the barbarian. This is particularly true if a half-

elf was raised among wild elves or was abandoned by his

parents at an early age to fend for himself. The half-elfs

bonuses on Listen and Spot checks, as well as low-light

vision,  mesh  well  with  the  skills  and  the  needs  of  the

barbarian class.

Bard:  Half-elf  bards  are  extremely  common,  thanks

to the half-elfs racial bonuses on Diplomacy and Gather

Information checks. Half-elves wander a great deal, and a

bard can pick up a tremendous number of tales and songs

as he explores new territory.

For alternative options for the half-elf bard, see the half-elf

racial substitution levels presented on page 157.

Cleric: Clerics are relatively rare among half-elves. As

mentioned earlier, most half-elf clerics worship Corellon

Larethian, a human deity, or no deity at all. Most half-elf

clerics choose deities that exemplify nature, and many take

levels in druid to gain additional powers that are tied to the

power of the land.

Druid: Half-elf druids are common, often found living

on the edge between human and elf territories. Those who

were raised among elves focus heavily on withdrawing into

nature,  while  those  who  were  raised  by  humans  tend  to

become ambassadors and stewards of the land, negotiating

peace between groups that may cause harm to the wilder-

ness they love.

Fighter: Since half-elves are unable to benet from the

increased dexterity of elves or the additional feat gained by

humans, ghter may not seem like an obvious choice for

a half-elfs class. However, half-elves are somewhat hardier

than  elves  (thus  allowing  them  to  stay  in  a  ght  longer)

and are more alert than humans (making them excellent at

skirmishing or some other ghting form that relies more

on speed and quickness than brute strength).

For  alternative  options  for  the  half-elf  ghter,  see  the

half-elf racial substitution levels presented on page 157.

Monk: Similar to the ghter, the monk isnt an obvious

class choice for a half-elf. However, the races keen senses

come in handy for stealthy monks who move like the wind

and  strike  from  the  shadows.  Also,  monasteries  are  well

known  for  accepting  individuals  based  on  their  abilities

and their merit, not their lineage. A half-elf may nd solace

and peace within a monastery when no other place accepts

him.

Paladin:  Half-elf  paladins  are  even  more  scarce  than

half-elf clerics. While human paladins are often respected

for their devotion to their deities, half-elf paladins are more

ecumenical in their outlookbut they smite evildoers just

as hard. Most half-elf paladins eschew the stereotype of the

heavily armed and armored stalwart combatant, acting with

quickness and alacrity to mete out justice. Half-elf paladins

are more common among half-elves raised by humans than

among those raised by elves.

Ranger: Half-elves make superb rangers, thanks in part

to their keen senses. Their elf blood often counts as a ben-

et when dealing with creatures of the forest, particularly

fey, who may distrust any other sort of character. Half-elf

rangers have a slight tendency toward the path of archery

over that of two-weapon ghting, especially if they were

raised among elves.

For  alternative  options  for  the  half-elf  ranger,  see  the

half-elf racial substitution levels presented on page 158.

Sorcerer: Half-elf sorcerers are even more amboyant

and over-the-top than their human counterparts. Although

Diplomacy and Gather Information are cross-class skills for

them, many half-elf sorcerers pick up ranks in these skills,

making  them  much  more  personable  than  the  average

spellcaster.

Wizard:  Many  half-elves  take  at  least  a  few  levels  in

wizard, especially if they grew up among elves. That said,

half-elf wizards are difcult to categorize; between them,

they have studied virtually every variation of the arcane

arts.  Since  half-elves  prefer  to  stay  on  the  move,  half-elf

wizards choose feats and skills that do not require them to

get bogged down; for instance, most shy away from item

creation feats.

SPECIAL HALF-ELF OPTIONS

A  half-elf  character  qualies  for  some  feats  and  prestige

classes  unavailable  to  PCs  of  other  races  (or  most  other

races), as described in Chapters 5 and 6 of this book.

Feats:  Complementary  Insight,  Diverse  Background,

Fearless  Destiny,  Heroic  Destiny,  Human  Heritage,  Pro-

tected Destiny, and Sociable Personality.

Prestige Classes: Outcast champion, scar enforcer.

THE HALF-ORC:

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Wake up and get moving. We dont want your kind here,

the watchman insisted. I keep the peace around here, and

youre not welcome.

Why? Tersh the half-orc wanted to ask. I paid for my lodg-

ings and my foodI bring business, and good hard coins. I dont

start ghts, or curse, or get rowdy. Why am I not welcome? But

he knew the reason.

Leave now, and dont come back, the man demanded,

and Tersh smothered a laugh. Or else!

The threat made him growl. A threat? From this imsy little

man with his puffy face and thinning hair?

Straightening to his full height, Tersh tossed his hood

back, hefted the club on his shoulder, and glowered down

at the man. Or else what? he growled. Youll attack me?

Go aheadI can use a good meal. He bared his tusks fully

and took a step forward.

That was all it took. The man broke and ran, his scab-

bard banging against his leg. Tersh laughed, then sighed.

That was fun, but I have to learn how not to lose my temper

like that. . . .

HALF-ORC PSYCHOLOGY

Spurned by both sides of their heritage, half-orcs are rebels

who dont t into societyand often dont want to t into

society.  Their  central  psychological  trait,  developed  as  a

defense mechanism, is a stubborn independent streak that

keeps everyone and everything at a safe distance.

At  their  best,  half-orcs  are  independent  and  cautious,

always alert for danger from every quarter. At their worst,

theyre rage-fueled time bombs, lashing out at anything that

gets too closewhether its an ally or an enemy.

QUICK TO JUDGE, QUICK TO ANGER

Half-orcs  spend  their  lives  looking  over  their  shoulders,

waiting for the next blow to fall. By the time they reach

adulthood, most have been tricked and betrayed so many

times that they dont easily trust anyone else. The typical

half-orc is abandoned at birth, bullied throughout child-

hood,  and  cast  out  into  the  wilderness  as  an  adolescent.

As a result, most of the half-orcs who reach adulthood are

cunning and wary to the point of being paranoid.

Half-orcs have been in danger their whole lives, so they

have learned to make split-second assessments of a situation

and  react  accordingly.  And  their  stubborn,  independent

streak means that theyll stick with that rst assessment

even  if  they  later  suspect  it  was  the  wrong  call.  Many  a

half-orc has attacked a bystander, only to  learn after the

fact that his foe meant him no harm. Half-orcs realize,

however, that taking time for reasoned contemplation of a

threat is a luxury not usually available to them.

Just as half-orcs are quick to make judgments, so too are

they quick to change moods.

Like  orcs,  they  tend  to  be  sullen  and  short-tempered,

snarling or lashing out at anything that displeases them.

They  prefer  action  to  thought  and  would  rather  settle  a

dispute  with  ghting  than  with  words.  Half-orcs  wear

their emotions on their sleeves, becoming wildly exuberant

when they are happy and deeply brooding when they are

displeased. Perhaps because of this straightforwardness in

the display of their emotions, half-orcs despise trickery and

lies and usually respond to such insults with overwhelming

violence.

A half-orc raised among humans has to learn to keep his

most violent outbursts under control. Exceptions may exist

if  the  humans  of  a  community  are  particularly  barbaric

themselves, but few settlements will tolerate anyone who

attacks with little or no provocation. Most half-orcs learn

to channel their anger into focused rages (some of them

becoming the quintessential barbarian), while still striving

to attain the elusive goal of a contemplative state of mind.

Because half-orcs are creatures of quick judgment, they

have a hard time dealing with tasks that require sustained,

nuanced  reasoning.  Most  philosophical  discussions  not

only go over the heads of most half-orcs, but bore them no

end. While most half-orcs are considerably smarter than

their orc parents, they all retain (to varying degrees) a rather

brutish intellect that tends to categorize people, items, and

concepts in black-and-white terms. To a half-orc, a creature,

idea, or thing is either good, bad, or unworthy of his further

attention.

BRUTAL CHILDHOODS

Most half-orcs grow up hiding from full-blooded human

children, weary of the bombardment of taunts and insults

they  nd  themselves  subjected  to.  Full-blooded  human

adults can be just as cruel, so a half-orc often nds refuge

only within his immediate familyassuming he was not

abandoned as a baby (which is the fate of many half-orcs

soon after they come into the world).

Once a half-orc in a human community reaches puberty,

life changes for him, but it doesnt get any easier. Still visibly

different in appearance from other children, now he is also

noticeably larger and stronger, better able to defend himself

against bullies. Since half-orcs mature slightly more rapidly

than humans, an adolescent half-orc may be almost at his

full adult height and weight, which makes him more than

a match for the human children around him.

Many half-orcs grow up to become bullies themselves,

intent on paying back the other children for years of humili-

ation. After a half-orc is tormented throughout his early

childhood, it understandably feels good to now be bigger

and  stronger  than  most  human  children,  perhaps  even

formidable enough to make adult humans back away.

Other  peoples  underlying  attitudes  toward  the  race,

however, dont change just because a half-orc puts on a few

extra pounds of muscle. If anything, the physical difference

between half-orcs and humans reinforces the stereotype.

Humans  assume  that  half-orcs  are  brutish  bullies,  and

young  half-orcs  unwittingly  exacerbate  that  fear.  By  the

time  a  half-orc  matures  enough  to  learn  how  to  behave

properly in human society, the damage is often done. As

a result, many half-orcs leave home shortly before or soon

after reaching adulthood. They escape to nd someplace

where people do not know them, in the hopes of starting

over.

Roleplaying  Application:  The  key  to  knowing  or

understanding any half-orc lies in the characters parentage.

If your character is a half-orc, think about who  his parents

were, and how they met. Was your characters conception

and birth the result of love, an arranged marriage, or an

abduction? Consider also your childhood: you could have

been kept by your parents, given up for adoption, or left for

dead.

NO TRUE PLACE IN SOCIETY

Human societies usually relegate half-orcs to the fringes,

where  they  eke  out  a  meager  subsistence-level  existence

through begging, menial labor, or selling their formidable

ghting skills. Because of this treatment, many half-orcs

become bitter and resentful toward humans, harboring deep

grudges that last a lifetime. A few lucky half-orcs grow up

in more enlightened societies that dont make value judg-

ments  about  racial  identitybut  even  those  individuals

come face to face with pervasive prejudice as soon as they

visit the wider world.

Half-orcs  who  are  raised  by  orcs  commonly  become

almost indistinguishable on the surface from their more

brutish kin. They must be tough and merciless to survive,

although their higher wisdom enables them to be much

more cunning in their attempts to survive. Half-orcs raised

in an orc tribe or community learn to respect strength above

any  other  quality  and  have  difculty  understanding  the

nuances of subtlety, tact, and diplomacy.

Roleplaying Application: Give some thought to how

your character responds to the glares, rudeness, and outright

unfairness of discrimination. You might try to conceal what

you are, or you might revel in your racial identity because

of  the  intimidation  factor  it  offers.  You  might  hope  that

friends and neighbors will forget overlook your heritage,

or you might display your half-orc nature proudly, daring

anyone to stare or sneer at you.

HERITAGE OF SHAME

No matter where they were raised, all half-orcs share a sense

of shame. Deep down, every half-orc feels that he embar-

rasses both of his parent races, and that people treat him as

a monster because he is one. This sense of shame persists

even when the half-orc in question is a paragon of virtue

and the shame is undeserved. A half-orcss low self-worth

is a wound that wont heal, though its pain can be deadened

from time to time.

This attitude lies at the heart of the half-orc mind-set.

Both his human family and his orc family treat a half-orc

like  a  poor  relation  and  sneer  at  his  shortcomings.Orcs

laugh at half-orcs because of their relative frailty and their

less imposing size. Humans mock them for their coarse

hair,  their  gray  skin,  and  their  intellectual  and  social

clumsiness.

LIVING IN THE NOW

Half-orcs have the shortest life span of any of the common

races.  Even  if  they  survive  their  various  adventures,  few

half-orcs live past the age of 70 or 75, and 60 is considered

an advanced age.

As a consequence of this situation, half-orcs take their

lives either very seriously or not seriously at all. Some indi-

viduals cherish every moment, seeking to wring as much

satisfaction as they can out of life before it ends. Others

feel that, since their lives are so brutish and short, nothing

truly matters, and they do whatever comes to mind with no

thought for the consequences.

For  example,  few  half-orcs  save  money;  they  prefer  to

spend whatever they have right away, while they can. At the

same time, half-orcs rarely bother with luxury items. They

may indulge in good food, good drink, and good weapons

and armor, but ne furniture, rich clothing, and luxurious

homes seem foolish purchases to someone who may not live

long enough to fully enjoy them.

THE STUPID STEREOTYPE

Everyone  assumes  that  half-orcs  are  strong  but  stupid,

and so they are taught as children to rely on their physical

prowess rather than their intellect. Many half-orcs believe

that strength is their only asset, so they fall into the role of

big and stupid because they resign themselves to it and

society expects it.

Half-orcs can be quick and stealthy, but most blunder

about instead because they do not consider themselves agile

or quiet and so have never honed certain skills. Half-orc

rogues are rare but surprisingly effective, in part because

no  one  expects  a  half-orc  to  be  able  to  hide  and  sneak

successfully.

THE HALF-ORC LIFE

Half-orcs make their own way in the world and, in so doing,

essentially invent their own lifestyle. Most half-orcs seldom

encounter other half-orcs, so the only guide they have for

how to live a half-orc lifestyle is the often cruel stereotype

maintained  by  humans  or  orcs.  Whether  a  half-orc  lives

among  humans,  among  orcs,  or  alone,  certain  innate

likes and dislikes arise within the individual. A half-orcs

harsh upbringing encourages and feeds these instinctive

attitudes.

Many half-orcs have a lifestyle dominated by the desires to

survive and to stay free of entanglements with the societies

that spurned them. They grow up defending themselves

from bullies and graduate to becoming bullies themselves.

This sort of life leaves little time for introspection or relax-

ation. Half-orcs are creatures of action, partially because

everyone expects this trait of them. They are considered

too stupid to think things through, too dumb to plan, and

as a result most half-orcs into this belief, charging into situ-

ations rather than considering their actions before carrying

them out. Half-orcs are raised believing that their size and

strength (relative to humans) are their greatest assets, and so

they seek out activities that focus on these features. When

they are not out adventuring, most half-orcs hunt, engage

in physical training, or practice with weapons.

LEISURE

Half-orcs  enjoy  the  simple  pleasures  of  life.  They  like

drinking, eating, carousing, singing boisterous songs, and

getting into an occasional scrap that allows them to test

their mettle.

Loud music, dangerous brawls, and copious quantities of

alcohol have the same effect on a half-orc: They enable him

to  momentarily  lose  himself  in  sensation  and  forget  the

pain and cruelty of his existence. When a half-orc is beating

a drum with all his might or smashing a skeleton to bits,

from selling their  ghting talents. Half-orcs are particularly

fond of art that illustrates idyllic landscapes, because these

works provide a window into a world they could never enter

otherwise.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Half-orcs are rarely taught to read and write, and even fewer

learn advanced subjects. As a result, many technical trades

are  beyond  them,  and  few  would  believe  that  a  half-orc

could be an inventor or an engineer. Half-orcs are relatively

cunning, however, and can often see the practical elements

in a new deviceor the  aws that only someone closely

connected to the real world would notice.

Half-orcs have no problems using devices, and most are

willing to try new types of equipment. Their own lives have

shown them that appearance is not always a key indicator of

quality, and they keep an open mind about new ideas and

new tools. But they are users, not creators, of these ideas

and tools.

This user, not creator tendency extends to magic as well.

Few half-orcs study magic, in part because most spellcasters

and many churches refuse to consider them for admission

as students. Nevertheless, half-orcs have no innate objection

to magic; most are willing to work with

spellcasters,   ght  for  them,  and  use

the  magic  items  they  create.  Half-orc

spellcasters  are  few  and  far  between,  but

those  few  are  highly  respected,  for

he isnt thinking about his heritage or his place in society.

He is entirely caught up in the moment and oblivious to

everything else because its irrelevant.

Because physical acts provide such visceral sensations,

half-orcs   nd  great  joy  in  running,  wrestling,  and  tests

of  strength,  especially  when  competing  against  others.

Even half-orcs who have controlled their violent behavior

still show signs of aggression and are at least moderately

competitive.

When they get caught up in the moment during some

form of intense physical activity, many half-orcs lack the

common  sense  to  know  when  enough  is  enough.  They

either push themselves to such an extent that they get sick

or injured, or they injure someone else.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Half-orcs have little understanding of creative endeavors

and  cannot  comprehend  what  others  see  in  paintings,

sculptures, and certain forms of music. Still, half-orcs do

revel in the beat of primitive music and the display of crude

imagerythe  savageness  of  such  art  forms  appeals  to

their orc blood.

When half-orcs enjoy art, its almost always as a recipient

and not as a creator. In their formative years, half-orcs are

more often handed swords instead of paint brushes

and shields instead of woodcarving tools. Never-

theless, some half-orcs do pick up a brush or

a trowel or a chisel and teach themselves

to create works of beauty. Most mem-

bers of the race are content to

admire such works, and

HALF-ORCS AT

WAR

Half-orcs  are  expected  to

excel at combat, and many do.

Their size and strength give

them  an  inherent  advantage

over  a  large  number  of  foes,

and  many  learn  to  channel

their  childhood  rage  into  a

battleeld  frenzy,  becoming

deadly opponents. Of course,

no  one  expects  them  to  care

about  strategy,  and  as  a

result most half-orcs serve

merely as foot soldiers and

shock troops, to be sent here

and there across the battleeld as the

situation warrants.

Half-orcs are more cunning than many people realize,

and  their  experience  with  pain  and  hardship  provides

them with insight into the ways of armies and soldiers.

Half-orcs make excellent scouts, because they can cover

distances with good speed and can dispatch any enemy

soldiers they encounter along the way. Because half-orcs

have darkvision, they are particularly good at nighttime

scouting and reconnoitering.

HALF-ORC SOCIETY

AND CULTURE

Discussing half-orc society is difcult, because few such

societies exist. Half-orcs rarely encounter one another, and

they almost never gather in numbers greater than what a

single  mobile  encampment  can

accommodate. Particularly at

a  young  age,  some  half-

orcs  assume  that  they  are

the  only  creatures

of  their  kind,  and

they  consider

themselves

a c c i d e n t s

of  breeding

rather  than

members of a

distinct race.

Most  half-

orcs  grow

up either in a

human  com-

munity  or  in

an  orc  tribe.

They adopt the

attitudes  and

interests of that

culture,  even

though  theyre

often ostracized by

that  culture  at  the

same time. Therein lies

part  of  the  reason  why

half-orcs do not form their

own  communities.  They

are taught from birth that

they  do  not  belong  any-

where  or  with  anyone,

and that they can never

t in. Thus, they assume

that  they  have  no  real

place  in  the  world,  and

that no one else could possibly want

In  human  communities,  half-

orcs are treated as the ugly children, the bastards, and the

idiots. They receive abuse every day; they are tolerated only

for their parents sake, and, when they get older, because

of  their  strength.  Every  day  a  half-orc  among  humans

hears  about  how  orcs  are  lthy  creaturesconsidered

as nothing more than animals that walk uprightand

is told that he should try to conceal that portion of his

heritage.

An older half-orc nds satisfying employment

as a bouncer for the local tavern

to live near them.

46

Orcs raise half-orc children to believe that humanity is

weak and decadent, and that a half-orc must be strong to

overcome these vulnerabilities in himself. Half-orcs in an

orc tribe get insulted and abused just as severely as those

in a human community, but the orcs justify this treatment

as a way to make half-orcs stronger and tougher. Orc tribes

discourages half-orcs from engaging in original thought,

urging them to lose themselves in the tribal mentality. If

this indoctrination is successful, a young half-orc regards

himself as a true orc trapped in a half-orc body.

THE SOLACE OF FRIENDSHIP

Half-orcs say they arent looking for a home or for friends.

Only  when  one  befriends  others  and  grows  fond  of  a

placeusually against the half-orcs better judgmentdoes

he realize what a treasure friendship is. Even then, a half-

orc is loath to admit such feelings and reluctant to let his

guard down.

Adventurers  are  a  half-orcs  most  likely  candidates

for  companionship.  Many  who  follow  the  path  of  the

adventurer have seen things far stranger and uglier than

a half-orc, who to them is merely a person who happens

to be larger and coarser than the average human. Many

half-orcs stick with an adventuring lifestyle despite the

dangersnot to win fame and fortune (though that is also

a goal), but because adventurers treat them as equals and

speak to them without fear.

Older half-orcs often settle in trading towns and other

places where adventurers gather. Many become bouncers

for taverns, a job for which their size and strength is useful.

Some retired half-orc adventurers establish inns and water-

ing holes of their own, using their fearsome appearance and

adventuring reputation to attract business from residents

and travelers alike.

Half-orcs value friendship and respect more than mem-

bers  of  any  other  race,  because  they  experience  both  so

rarely. A typical half-orc will do anything for his friends,

and will help them without question. But gaining a half-orcs

trust is difcult, even for his friendsyears of enduring

insults have taught half-orcs to be cautious toward other

folk and to expect harsh words instead of kind ones.

Nor do half-orcs fawn over people to win respect. They

know from experience that such methods foster only false,

transitory approval at best. Instead, most half-orcs act natu-

rally, warn annoying people away, and wait to see whether

anyone can accept them as they are.

HALF-ORCS AND

OTHER RACES

Half-orcs live their lives surrounded by members of other

races. They rarely see other half-orcs, but they usually live

among humans or orcs and often interact with dwarves,

elves, halings, and gnomes.

In their own hostile way, half-orcs raised by humans are of-

ten more tolerant toward other races than anyone else in the

communitytolerant in the sense that theyre just as rude

to elves and dwarves as they are to humans. Such individu-

als also have rsthand experience in being hated for being

different, so they are less likely to scorn other outcasts.

Half-orcs raised by orcs are the opposite. They learn to

hate anyone who is not an orc, and to despise dwarves and

elves in particular. The sections that follow deal primarily

with half-orcs who were raised among humans.

Dwarves: Half-orcs think that dwarves would be funny

if they werent so dangerous. These short, stout creatures are

so serious, so judgmental, and so task-oriented, yet they can

drink for days and sit up singing songs for nights on end.

Half-orcs respect dwarves for their strength, and admire

their  skill  with  both  weapons  and  stone,  but  they  think

dwarves should learn to relax a little. Still, dwarves make

good  companions,  because  they  always  keep  their  word

and theyre good in a ght. These two elements sometimes

unite dwarves and half-orcs, and members of the two races

can be suprisingly staunch companions.

Elves:  Every  half-orc  knows  that  the  elves  look  down

upon him, and every half-orc offers seething resentment

in return for the elves contempt.

That  said,  some  half-orcs  secretly  wish  they  could  be

more elike. Elves are slight, graceful, magical, and enig-

maticeverything a half-orc is not.

Gnomes: Gnomes and half-orcs have little in common.

One race is small, quick, and clever; the other is large, strong,

and not interested in devices or magic. But both races dont

appreciate humans, elves, and dwarves who dismiss them as

unimportant, so theres at least a little common ground.

Goliaths: Most half-orcs have never met a goliath and do

not know this reclusive race exists. Those who do travel into

the mountains, however, often come to respect these stony

creatures. In turn, goliaths who meet half-orcs are surprised

to nd that the half-orcs show more respect toward nature

than some other races and live more closely tied to the earth

and to their instincts. Half-orc barbarians who live near a

tribe of goliath barbarians are often welcome guests who

visit, hunt, and trade regularly with the tribe.

Halings: Of all the common races, halings have the

least in common with half-orcs. To a half-orc, a haling is

essentially a human but on a smaller scalepossessing the

intelligence and quick-witted cruelty of humans, but not

the humans size and strength. Halings see half-orcs as the

embodiment of everything big and brutish about humans.

The two races do not get along, and half-orcs and halings

spend as little time together as possible.

Half-Elves: Half-orcs envy half-elves, sometimes to the

point of hatred. They see half-elves as people who should be

their compatriots, being half-human as they arebut their

other half is elf, lending them grace and beauty while half-

orcs suffer from social ineptness and ugliness. Half-elves are

usually accepted by members of both of their parent races,

while half-orcs have to struggle to be accepted by even one

of  theirs.

Most half-elves dislike half-orcs, or at least feel uncomfort-

able around them, perhaps because seeing them reminds

half-elves  how  easy  their  own  lives  have  been,  and  how

much they have taken for granted.

Humans: As a general rule, half-orcs grow up among

humans and spend most of their time with them. Even

so,  most  humans  see  half-orcs  as  representatives  of

something incomplete or corrupted, and thus they never

get past that broad assumption to an appreciation of the

individual. As a consequence, half-orcs are wary around

humansthey know from long experience how nasty

these people can be.

Illumians: Half-orcs have had little contact with illumi-

ans, and a race of esoteric librarians doesnt interest them

much.

Keep in mind that the above sections only describe half-orcs

who were raised by humans. A typical half-orc raised by

orcs would hate elves and dwarves, distrust humans, and

consider gnomes and halings obnoxious creatures good

only for sport, torture, and food.

HALF-ORC RELIGION

Half-orcs follow either an orc religion or a human religion,

depending on where they were raised. No half-orc deity

exists,  and  half-orcs  have  never  gathered  to  focus  their

prayers on a single entity.

Those who grow up in orc tribes follow Gruumsh, the

chief  god  of  the  orcs.  Gruumsh  is  a  god  of  war  and  of

strength, two of a half-orcs specialties, and thus many half-

orcs nd him an inspiring, if bloodthirsty, god to follow.

Gruumsh teaches that the weak should not be tolerated,

and that everyone must strive for strength and endurance.

He also teaches hatred toward elves and dwarves. Because

these  races  hate  orcs  (and,  by  association,  any  half-orcs

raised  by  orcs),  it  seems  only  reasonable  to  hate  them

back. Gruumsh is a god of action, demanding sacrices

and  victories  in  battle  rather  than  prayer.  Thus,  he  is  a

good  match  for  the  half-orcs  propensity  toward  action

and violence.

A half-orc raised in a human community may worship

whichever human god was revered in their area and by his

human parent. Kord focuses on strength and activity, and

half-orcs can relate to him. Heironeous promotes bravery

and honor, two ideals half-orcs can strive toward. Some of

the noblest half-orcs have been followers of Heironeous,

and this god is open-minded enough to allow even half-orc

paladins (though they are rare).

Half-orcs  who  grow  up  alone  in  the  wild  rarely  have

religion, because no one has taught them about the gods.

Those who later discover the gods may follow Obad-Hai,

placing their faith in nature and neutrality.

HALF-ORC HISTORY

AND FOLKLORE

As mentioned above, half-orcs think they alone suffer their

sad fate, and few realize they have kindred in type if not in

actual blood. Thus, half-orcs have no organized history and

no folklore, because the race is not cohesive as other races

are. Half-orcs simply dont have the town squares, wander-

ing minstrels, and smoky campres required to sustain an

oral tradition. A half-orc typically considers himself either

human or orc in heritage, and takes his history and folklore

from that parent race.

HALF-ORC LANGUAGE

Half-orcs  have  no  language  of  their  own.  Instead,  each

learns the language of his home communityCommon

in a human settlement or Orc in an orc tribe. Most orc

encampments  speak  some  Common  as  well,  in  order  to

trade with others and to eavesdrop on them, so half-orcs

who  live  with  orcs  often  speak  both  tongues.  Because

of  their  lower  tusks,  however,  half-orcs  speak  Common

with difculty, slurring words together. To compensate,

many choose to speak slowly when talking in Common,

but this only reinforces the stereotype that half-orcs are

slow and stupid.

Few  half-orcs  learn  to  read  and  write.  Orcs  have  little

use for literacy, and humans see no point in trying to teach

half-orc children a capability they will probably never need

and might be too dumb to learn.

Half-orcs  who  travel  the  world  are  often  astounded  to

discover  that  most  languages  have  written  forms.  Some

eagerly study writing after they have seen it used, becoming

procient enough to read signs, maps, and menus and to

write their own name and simple statements. Some half-orcs

also learn other languages, astounding humans with their

prociency in Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, and Goblin. Few

half-orcs master Elven, because that language is too musical

for their harsh voicesand because half-orcs have little to

say to elves anyway.

HALF-ORC SETTLEMENTS

Half-orcs, when they do settle down, usually nd themselves

either in human towns or in orc villages. Most other races do

not accept their presence. Even if a half-orc gains acceptance

from a haling or an elf or a dwarf, the friends family and

neighbors often will not share this feeling. Many half-orcs

avoid  the  problem  altogether  by  making  their  homes  in

forests or on mountaintops, well away from other folk. They

hunt, sh, and farm for their food, trekking into the nearest

village infrequently for supplies and news.

Half-orcs  often  account  for  a  small  percentage  of  the

population  in  a  large  human  city.  Humans  are  the  only

major  race,  aside  from  orcs,  that  accepts  half-orcs  at  all,

half-orc,  and  inns  become  strangely  full  whenever  he

wants  a  room.  Whats  worse,  his  human  family  thinks

hes too like an orc, and his orc kin say hes too human.

Half-orcs just cant win.

Since physical prowess and strength come naturally to

half-orc characters, you should use these traits to their full-

est advantagewhile balancing them with other attributes.

No one expects a half-orc to be fast on his feet, so a high

Dexterity can give you an edge in combat. Since everyone

assumes  such  a  character  is  stupid,  give  your  half-orc  a

high Intelligence or Wisdom, and equip him with skills

such as Listen and Sense Motive. Your half-orc will learn

things  no  one  else  does,  just  because  no  one  realizes  he

can understand them. Making the character a rogue or a

spellcaster is another fun way to play against typeand its

easy for your half-orc to conceal his true class. If a half-orc

is carrying a club, everyone who sees him assumes hes a

ghter or a barbarian.

HALF-ORCS AS CHARACTERS

Half-orcs are best suited for the barbarian class, in which

they can make the most of their strength and size. But being

strong and tough is rarely a drawback, and half-orcs as a race

are more versatile than most folk realize.

Barbarian: This is the most common class for half-orcs,

partially due to their strength and partially because of their

upbringing. Half-orcs raised by orcs often become barbar-

ians after leaving home.

Bard: This is probably the most difcult class for half-

orcs  to  succeed  intheir  low  Charisma  puts  them  at  a

disadvantage, as does their brutish appearance. However,

a successful half-orc bard would certainly make people sit

up and take notice, and his rarity would intrigue customers

and patrons.

Cleric:  Half-orc  clerics  usually  worship  Gruumsh  or

one of the more physical-oriented gods, such as Kord. They

concentrate on spells that enhance strength and endurance,

and anything that aids them in battle. Half-orc clerics who

ght undead are rare because of the half-orcs disadvantage

in Charisma. Whatever their religion, half-orc clerics preach

that hardships are tests that only the faithful can pass.

Druid:  Since  half-orcs  live  away  from  other  people,

they can appreciate nature. That trait makes them decent

candidates for the druid class. They may also know a lot

about  local  ora  and  fauna,  since  they  live  by  gathering

food themselves.

Fighter: This is the second most popular class for half-

orcs, since their natural strength works well in concert with

a ghters weapon training in weapons. Half-orc ghters

tend  toward  selecting  Cleave  and  other  Strength-based

feats.

Monk: At rst glance, this raceclass combination might

seem ridiculous: a half-orc monk? But monks focus on the

betterment of the individual, and on being self-sufcient,

both of which t the half-orcs situation. And, since most

and residents of large cities are more tolerant of different

attitudes  and  appearances  than  those  who  live  in  small

towns. In a city, a half-orc can lose himself in the crowd, and

he may not even be the largest, strongest, and most brutish

person around. Cities also provide excellent employment

opportunities, and half-orcs in urban environments have

little trouble nding jobs as bodyguards, bouncers, laborers,

or mercenaries.

CREATING HALF-ORC

CHARACTERS

Half-orcs are both extremely easy and extremely hard to

play. On one hand, most half-orcs are have uncomplicated

character  hooks:  Theyre  big,  strong,  active,  and  not  too

bright. Half-orcs are also individuals without a racial his-

tory or racial culture to guide their behavior. That means

you can decide from scratch what your half-orc character

is like, how he acts, where he is from, and what he wants

out of life.

On  the  other  hand,  half-orc  characters  are  difcult

to portray because other people assume they are stupid,

ingracious, and just as bloodthirsty as their orc relatives.

Overcoming those stereotypes is a challenge, both when

other player characters are involved and when interacting

with NPCs. Some villages and towns wont allow half-orcs

to enter, though theyll happily welcome dwarves, elves,

and  gnomes.  Restaurants  will  close  rather  than  serve  a

clumsy  as  many  folk  assumeand  their  very  size  and

appearance make them the last ones anyone would suspect

of being thieves. The rogues skill points nicely offset the

half-orcs lack of intelligence, while a half-orcs strength

combined with the rogues sneak attack class feature can

deliver a killing blow.

Sorcerer: Half-orcs do not make good sorcerers. The

class depends on Charisma to succeed, and that is typically

a half-orcs weakest ability. However, such characters are

not  unheard  of,  and  at  low  levels  the  half-orcs  natural

strength helps make up for the sorcerers lack of combat

skill.

Wizard: Many half-orcs can barely read or write, but for

those who can, this class is an interesting career choice.

Who would ever suppose that a half-orc could be a wizard?

Backed  by  a  half-orcs  strength,  a  wizards  quarterstaff

becomes an effective weapon.

SPECIAL HALF-ORC OPTIONS

A half-orc character quali es for some feats and prestige

classes  unavailable  to  PCs  of  other  races  (or  most  other

races),  as  described  in  Chapters  5  and  6  of  this

book.

Feats: Channeled Rage, Diverse Back-

ground, Fearless Destiny, Heroic

Destiny,  Human  Heritage,

Menacing  Demeanor,  Pro-

tected Destiny.

Prestige  Classes:

Menacing  brute,  out-

cast champion.

half-orcs have had hard lives, the discipline of the monks

Paladin: Half-orc paladins are rare, both because half-

orcs  dislike  rules  and  because  most  gods  would  never

consider them worthy of such favor. Heironeous considers

each applicant as an individual, however, and has accepted

half-orc paladin worshipers on many occasions. After all,

they can  ght, and they could become powerful symbols

of order if trained properly.

Ranger: Half-orcs spend much of their time alone in

the wild, hunting and tracking, so ranger is a natural class

choice for them. The class is also more versatile than the

 ghter classno one expects a half-orc to have access to

magic, especially if hes carrying a sword. Half-orc rangers

are more likely to take the two-weapon  ghting combat

style than the archery combat style, because they can put

their strength to greater use in melee.

Rogue: No one would suppose a half-orc to be a rogue,

right? But why not? They are big and strong, but not as

he  illumians  are  a  race  created  by  sorcery.

Through  painstaking  ritual,  they  have  devel-

oped a mystical connection to the magic runes that

make up their alphabet. Glowing sigils surround

them, granting the power of an eldritch language

made esh.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Bloodwing Zhaolei wakes before dawn to the tinkling of

chimes in the Bloodwing fortress-monastery. After a half-

hour of calisthenics in her small, stone room, she dons her

personal robes, then a white mantle denoting her junior

status within her cabal.

She walks down the hallway to the common room to

share a meal of porridge, bread, and tea with other junior

members  of  the  cabal.  According  to  their  custom,  the

initiates eat in silence in the dim chamber, the only light

that produced by their slowly rotating sigils.

Pausing after her last sip of tea, Zhaolei briey meditates

on her schedule for the day. Then she reports to the library,

where she continues her translation of The Codicils of Vyurek

the Elder from Illumian to Elven. Carefully transcribing,

Zhaolei intentionally writes slowly, repeating each word

over and over in her mind. She suspects that Bloodwing

Thotho, the librarian, will test her on the book when shes

nished translating it.  After receiving poor  marks  for

reading retention last season, shes more determined

than ever before to excel at her studies.

Zhaolei is almost done with a chapter when the chimes

ring again. She walks quickly to the courtyard, eager to

get her hands on one of the better swords for weapons

training.  Along  the  way  she  mentally  rehearses  the

quick-draw drill shes been practicing for the last two

weeks.  Today  is  her  last  day  to  practice  before  the

weapon master, Bloodwing Rulya, administers a series

of sword exams. Zhaolei draws her sword over and

over again, willing her arm to remain steady so that

the sword tip doesnt quiver in the slightest. Rulya

is a stickler for a calm weapon.

After  precisely  101  repetitions  of  the  training

exercise,  Zhaolei  and  the  other  students  in  her

weapons class snack on fruit and nuts in the court-

yard of the cabals fortress. Unlike breakfast, lunch

is intended to be a social affair. Zhaolei seeks out

Bloodwing Kurret, who nished a translation of

the Codicils last year. After patiently waiting for

him to nish a conversation about sword sharpening,

Zhaolei asks him about the Codicilsand the test shes

likely to face when her translation is complete.

51

You know it would be unfair to help you, Kurret says.

And its bold of you to ask. When I was in your position, I

was too busy memorizing Galgans commentaries on the

Codicils to pester older students.

Zhaolei  bows  politely  and  retreats.  Munching  on  a

plum, she wonders whether Kurret was dropping a hint,

intentionally misleading her, or simply careless when he

mentioned the sage Galgan. Hints and misdirection are

both possible from Kurret, but a careless comment would

be out of character for any Bloodwing.

After lunch, the students pair off for wooden sword duels.

The  clatter  of  dull  blades  lls  the  air  for  the  prescribed

1-minute cycles, after which the students rotate to face a

new foe. Zhaolei wins eight and loses nine. Perhaps Ive been

concentrating on technique and neglecting strategy, she thinks.

I need to watch my fellow students more closely and remember

any weak points.

Tired from practice (not to mention sore from exactly

nine bruises), Zhaolei returns to her bedchamber for an

hour  of  private  meditation.  The  chimes  ring  again,  and

Zhaolei quickly discards her white mantle and outer robe

for a simple gray frock. Then she shufes to the front hall

of the fortress for collective labor.

While the work is usually menial (and mind-numbingly

boring), Zhaolei looks forward to collective labor. Its the

only time of day when she sees the senior members of the

cabal,  as  well  as  the  cabals  children.  The  cabals  house-

matron,  Bloodwing  Haitao,  assigns  groups  to  sweeping,

cooking, wood gathering, and the countless tasks that draw

no attentionuntil theyre left undone. Haitao reminds

all present to contemplate the collective will of the cabal,

and Zhaolei smiles, deciding that Haitao has mastered the

most roundabout way of telling people to be quiet that shes

ever heard.

Despite  Haitaos  admonitions,  Zhaolei  has  a  pleasant

conversation  with  the  members  of  her  work  detail  as

she mops the hallway oors, even if the conversation is

punctuated with frequent, backbreaking trips to the cabals

well. Haitao mixes junior and senior members of the cabal

in  the  work  details,  so  Zhaolei  gets  a  glimpse  into  the

cabals other circles. This evening, two senior members

are talking about a trip into the forest that surrounds the

cabal  fortress.  Maybe  someday  Ill  learn  enough  herb-lore

and nature-magic to run through the forest. Zhaolei sees the

forest beyond the cabals walls only when a work detail

takes her to the upper-oor domiciles, which have small,

barred windows. I wonder if the forest is really as dangerous

as they say.

The low chimes of the dinner bell ring, and the members

of Zhaoleis work detail quickly stow their mops and shed

their work robes before ling into dinner. As with break-

fast, dinner is intended to be a meditative event. Unlike

breakfast, dinner is hot, spicy, and satisfying. Savoring a

baked apple, Zhaolei meditates on the likelihood that shell

pick apples herself one day.

After dinner, Zhaolei has free time, which according

to the cabals rules means she can study in the library or

do  calisthenics.  Zhaolei  makes  a  beeline  for  the  library

shelf where Galgans Commentaries on Vyurek sits. She reads

Galgan until her eyelids droop, then forces herself to page

through a second book shes selected: My Time Among the

Druids by Bloodwing Uuthan.

Ill bet druids eat apples in the forest every day, muses Zhaolei

as she shufes off to bed.

DESCRIPTION

Unlike  the  previous  two  chapters,  which  covered  races

previously described in the Players Handbook, this chapter

gives a full description of a new race known as illumians,

their racial traits, and all other information necessary for

creating illumian characters.

OVERVIEW

Illumians  are  contemplative  humanoids,  driven  and

ambitious, taught from an early age to master every eld

of study.

Personality: Illumians tend to be somewhat cautious,

choosing  to  study  a  situation  and  develop  a  plan  before

acting.

Theyre also proud of their heritage as illumians, extol-

ling the virtues of illumians in general and their cabal in

particular for anyone wholl listen.

Physical Description: Illumians look like the humans

who rst learned the Ritual of Words Made Fleshpale-

skinned and somewhat taller than average. More than half

of all illumians are bald, while the rest have blond or red

hair. Facial hair is almost unheard of.

Of course, their most signicant features are the luminous

sigils that oat above their heads, endlessly circling. These

sigils are described in detail below.

Illumianseven poor onesfavor the most expensive

dress  they  can  afford,  with  ne  embroidery,  long  robes

and capes, and multiple layers. Their bulky dress makes

illumians look bigger and more muscular than they actu-

ally are. Illumians have a great distaste for dirt and take

pains to keep their clothes clean, even in a wilderness or

dungeon setting.

Elaborate facial makeup is also common among illumi-

ans,  particularly  older  ones  who  have  already  mated  for

their  cabal.  While  some  humans  wear  makeup  to  make

themselves  appear  more  attractive,  illumians  wear  it  for

the opposite reason: to keep others at a distance. The more

garish  and  outlandish  an  individuals  makeup,  the  more

likely it is that she wishes to be left alone.

Relations: Illumians regard humans as a brother race,

but remain somewhat distantafter all, the illumians left

pure  humanity  behind  when  they  undertook  the  Ritual

of the Word Made Flesh. Elves are admired for their long

life spans, love of learning, and facility with magic, while

3

dwarves are regarded as consummate craftsfolk but with

little else to offer. Illumians confronted with gnomes and

halings sometimes let a bit of paternalism seep through

their efforts to be polite, subconsciously treating the small

folk like children.

Whenever they can, illumians seek common ground with

species that demonstrate a love of learning, such as dragons

and  outsiders.  Conversely,  illumians  have  regarded  the

githyanki as implacable enemies ever since the githyanki

discovered and sacked the illumians High Library on the

Astral Plane. Except for those of the Gravewhisper cabals

(described below), illumians abhor  undead.

Alignment:  The  cabals  that  form  the  backbone  of

illumian  society  maintain  codes  of  honor  they  expect

members to follow, so illumians have a tendency toward

lawful  alignments.  Gibber  cabals  (described  below)  seek

power in the disorder of invented words, and so have more

chaotic tendencies.

Illumian Lands: Illumians usually form a small com-

munity  far  away  from  civilization,  where  they  are  free

to  make  their  plans  without  outside  interference.  Some

cabals  (or  clusters  of  allied  cabals)  occupy  buildings  or

neighborhoods  in  major  human  cities,  where  eventually

their appearance ceases to arouse particular curiosity. Many

cabals have access to a magic portal that whisks illumians

to the Shadow City of Elirhondas, a teeming metropolis in

which illumians make up the overwhelming majority of

the population.

Religion: Illumian clerics mainly worship Tarmuid, the

First Speaker, who invented the Ritual of the Word Made

Flesh  and  uttered  the  words  that  created  the  illumians

centuries ago. Since then, a few other illumiansmostly

those who participated in the very rst Ritual of the Word

Made Fleshhave ascended to godhood by making a nal

utterance (described below). Tarmuid and these illumian

deities are described in The Illumian Pantheon, later in

this chapter.

Language: Illumians speak the language that Tarmuid

discovered  (or  invented,  according  to  some  cabals),  the

magical language that powered the ritual that created the

rst illumians. Even infants can speak Illumianslowly

and  poorlywithin  a  few  days  of  birth.  Nonillumians

dont have an instinctive grasp of the language and nd it

very hard to learn. Because they arent magically infused

with the language the way illumians are, other speakers of

Illumian receive no power from the hundreds of sigils that

form the languages alphabet.

Names: Illumian personal names are almost always two

or three syllables long, chosen from syllables that have a

positive connotation (the paragraphs below contain a list

of good choices for an illumian PC). Illumians also take

the name of their cabal as their own. Because the cabals

help dene an illumians place in the world, illumians give

their cabal name rst, followed by their personal name.

When speaking in Common, illumians usually translate

their cabal name but leave their personal name in Illumian

because  it  most  likely  doesnt  have  an  exact  match  in

Common.

Male Names: Abthek, Byerek, Duensel, Ghautar, Hautra,

Iarmid, Kaulesh, Kyrish, Ooleg, Shelkau, Vyurek, Yeylea.

Female  Names:  Andrin,  Chalaum,  Eallie,  Fraona,

Nuele, Prekish, Querik, Rhealoo, Sreiska, Woothal, Xiroth,

Zhaolei.

Cabal  Names:  Blackpennant,  Bloodwing,  Driftcloud,

Duskwatcher, Frostpeak, Rustdreamer, Stormwind.

Adventurers: Illumians travel to learn more about the

surrounding world on behalf of their cabals, occasionally

undertaking dangerous missions on behalf of their cabal

leaders. A few illumians have been cast out of their cabals,

but its far more likely that an adventuring illumian left

voluntarily, hoping to gain enough knowledge and power

to attract other illumians and thereby found a new cabal.

Illumians  spend  a  number  of  their  adolescent  or  young

adult years wandering the world, dreaming of being the

master at the center of a powerful illumian cabal.

ILLUMIAN RACIAL TRAITS

Humanoid (human): Illumians are humanoid creatures

with the human subtype.

Medium: As Medium creatures, illumians have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Illumian base land speed is 30 feet.

Luminous Sigils (Su): The sigils that orbit an illumians

head glow softly, providing illumination equal to that

of a candle. Illumians can make their sigils disappear

by concentrating for a moment (a standard action), but

they dont receive the sigils benets and cant use any

special abilities granted by illumian words (see below)

while theyre doused. Restoring the sigils to visibility is

a free action.

Luminous sigils (including power sigils; see below)

are  insubstantial  and  disappear  into  any  matter  they

touch.  An illumians sigils remain present and in effect

even when the illumian takes another form, unless she

would lose her supernatural abilities as a result of the

form change. An illumian wizard who casts a polymorph

spell on herself retains her sigils, but an illumian who

becomes a zombie loses them.

Glyphic  Resonance  (Ex):  Illumians  are  the  physical

embodiment  of  a  magical  language,  so  they  interact

strangely with symbol-based spells. This group includes

all spells whose names contain the word glyph, rune,

sigil,  or  symbol  (such  spells  in  the  Players  Handbook

include explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of

warding, sepia snake sigil, and the various symbol spells).

When an illumian encounters such magic, one of two

things happens: Either the illumians resonance overpow-

ers the spell, or the foreign magic corrupts the mystical

language that denes the illumian. Illumians have a 4

racial penalty on saving throws against these effects if

their level is less than the caster level of the spell. If an

illumians level equals or exceeds the spells caster level,

she is immune to the effect.

Power  Sigils  (Su):  In  addition  to  the  array  of  dimly

glowing luminous sigils that orbits her head, a 1st-level

illumian has a single brightly glowing power sigil that

grants her certain bonuses (see below). A power sigil can

be discerned from other sigils surrounding an illumian

with a DC 10 Spot check, and identied with a DC 15

Knowledge (arcana) check.

On attaining 2nd level in any class, an illumian gains

a second different power sigil, and the bonus granted

by each power sigil increases to +2. Depending on the

combination  of  power  sigils  she  chooses,  an  illumian

gains one or more extra special abilities (see Illumian

Words, below). The benet of each power sigil is given

below, along with the Common translation of each sigils

Illumian name.

Aesh  (vigor):  +1  bonus  on  Strength  checks  and

Strength-based skill checks.

Hoon (life): +1 bonus on Wisdom checks, Constitu-

tion checks, and Wisdom- or Constitution-based skill

checks.

Krau (magic): +1 bonus to caster level for all spells

and spell-like abilities (up to a maximum value equal to

the illumians  character level).

Naen (mind): +1 bonus on Intelligence checks and

Intelligence-based skill checks.

Uur (grace): +1 bonus on Dexterity checks and Dexter-

ity-based skill checks.

Vaul (soul): +1 bonus on Charisma checks and Cha-

risma-based skill checks.

Illumian Words (Su): Each combination of two power

sigils names makes an Illumian word of great power, and

thus grants extra abilities to a character who possesses

those two power sigils. The benet of each word of power

is described below.

Aeshkrau: The illumian can use her Strength score to

determine the bonus spells she gains for a high ability

score,  instead  of  the  normal  ability  score  used  by  her

class  to  determine  this  feature.  If  she  has  more  than

one spellcasting class, she may use her Strength score

in place of any or all of the ability scores used by those

classes for this purpose.

Aeshoon: Twice per day, the illumian can spend a turn

or rebuke attempt as a swift action to gain a bonus on

weapon damage rolls equal to her Wisdom bonus. This

effect lasts until the beginning of her next turn, and it

applies only to weapons with which she has selected the

Weapon Focus feat.

Aeshuur: When the illumian deals damage to a target

with a sneak attack or a critical hit, she gains a +2 dodge

bonus to her AC against that target until the beginning

of her next turn.

Hoonkrau:  The  illumian  can  spend  a  turn  undead

attempt as a swift action to add 1d8 points to the damage

healed by any cure spell she casts before the end of her

next turn, or a rebuke undead attempt as a swift action

to add 1d8 points to the damage dealt by any inict spell

she casts before the end of her next turn. The illumian

may use this ability twice per day.

Hoonvaul: Twice per day, the illumian can expend a

spell slot (but not a slot holding a prepared spell) as a

swift action to gain a bonus equal to the spells level on

turning checks, turning damage rolls, and on attack and

damage rolls when making a smite attack. This effect

lasts until the beginning of the illumians next turn.

Naenaesh: During the time when the illumian pre-

pares spells, she can choose to leave up to two spell slots

unlled to gain the ability to cast any other prepared

spell (or spells) of the same level as if it had been pre-

pared with the Still Spell feat. This effect lasts until the

next time the illumian prepares spells. She cannot ll

the vacant spell slot (or slots) until the next time she

prepares spells.

Naenhoon: Twice per day, the illumian can spend one

or more turn or rebuke undead attempts as a swift action

to add a metamagic effect to a spell she is casting, with

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: ILLUMIAN POWER SIGILS

While  illumian  power  sigils  are  useful  to  most  characters,

multiclass characters gain the maximum benefit from Illumian

words. This is intentionalillumians enjoy multiclassing, and

such pursuits are common among their people.

The DM should resist the temptation to simply add more

power  sigils  without  carefully  considering  the  ramifications.

A  finite  number  of  illumian  power  sigils  exist.  This  limits

the  number  of  Illumian  words  in  the  game,  which  prevents

the number of options available to illumian characters from

becoming overwhelming. Adding even one power sigil to the

list  adds  six  new  combinations,  and  dramatically  increases

the number of Illumian words available to illumians with two

power sigils.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

If  you  choose  to  adjust  the  selection  of  power  sigils  avail-

able in your game, do so with care. In general, the power sigils

dont add directly to a single-class characters combat prowess.

A power sigil that grants a bonus on attack or damage rolls,

for instance, would not be a good addition. Not only would it

benefit single-class characters as much as or more than multi-

classed characters, its power level makes it much more attrac-

tive than any of the other power sigils. Even the krau power sigil

only improves the caster level of a multiclass spellcaster or a

character whose caster level isnt already equal to his character

level (such as a paladin or ranger), and thus isnt attractive to

single-class spellcasters.

Any new Illumian words you create should reward multiclass

characters more than single-class characters.

no effect on the spells casting time or effective level. She

must have the metamagic feat whose effect she wants

to apply. The illumian must expend a number of turn

or  rebuke  undead  attempts  equal  to  the  normal  level

adjustment of the metamagic feat (for example, it costs

two turn or rebuke attempts to apply an Empower Spell

effect). If she chooses to apply the Heighten Spell effect,

it costs her one turn attempt per level that she heightens

the spell, up to a maximum of 9th level.

Naenkrau:  During  the  time  when  the  illumian

prepares spells, she can choose to leave up to two spell

slots unlled to add +1 to the save DCs of all her other

spells  of  that  level  (including  spells  from  different

classes). If she leaves two spell slots unlled, they must

be at different spell levels. This effect lasts until the

next time the illumian prepares spells. She cannot ll

the vacant spell slot (or slots) until the next time she

prepares spells.

Uurhoon: Twice per day, the illumian can expend a

spell slot (but not a slot holding a prepared spell) as a

swift action to gain an insight bonus equal to her Wisdom

bonus on Reex saves and her Dexterity bonus on caster

level checks to overcome spell resistance. This effect lasts

for 1 minute per level of the spell slot expended.

Uurkrau: The illumian can use her Dexterity score to

determine the bonus spells she gains for a high ability

score, instead of the normal ability score used by her

class  to  determine  this  feature.  If  she  has  more  than

one spellcasting class, she may use her Dexterity score

in place of any or all of the ability scores used by her

classes for this purpose.

Uurnaen: During the time when the illumian prepares

spells,  she  can  choose  to  leave  a  1st-level  or  2nd-level

spell  slot  unlled  to  add  an  insight  bonus  equal  to

the  spell  slots  level  on  attack  rolls  when  making  an

unarmed strike or a sneak attack. This effect lasts until

the next time the illumian prepares spells. She cannot

ll the vacant spell slot until the next time she prepares

spells.

Vaulaesh: Twice per day, the illumian  can  expend a

spell slot (but not a slot holding a prepared spell) as a

swift action to gain an insight bonus equal to the spells

level to AC and on weapon damage rolls. This effect lasts

until the beginning of the illumians next turn, and the

damage bonus applies only to weapons with which she

has selected the Weapon Focus feat.

Vaulkrau: Twice per day, the illumian can expend a

spell slot (but not a slot holding a prepared spell) as an

immediate action to gain an insight bonus equal to the

spells level on the next saving throw she makes before

the start of her next turn.

Vaulnaen: Twice per day, the illumian can use a spell

slot (but not a slot holding a prepared spell) to spontane-

ously cast any of her prepared spells of the same spell

level. For example, a 3rd-level bard/1st-level wizard who

had prepared burning hands as a wizard spell could use

one of her 1st-level bard spell slots to cast burning hands.

The  spell  is  cast  using  the  caster  level  at  which  it  is

prepared (the bard/wizard in the above example would

cast burning hands as a 1st-level caster).

Vauluur: The illumian may expend a spell slot (but

not a prepared spell) as a swift action to add 1d6 per

spell level to her unarmed strike damage rolls and her

sneak  attack  damage  rolls.  This  effect  lasts  until  the

beginning of her next turn, and she may use it twice

per day.

Final Utterance (Ex): When an illumian dies, her body

releases the stored Illumian language within it. For 1

round per Hit Die of the illumian, anyone within earshot

hears ululating Illumian syllablesusually gibberish,

but occasionally a prophetic phrase or a nal curse on the

illumians enemies. The illumians body need not remain

intact for the nal utterance to occur. Even if an illumian

succumbs to a disintegrate spell,  her disembodied voice

still utters strange gibberish for several rounds.

+2 racial bonus on saves against spells with the shadow

descriptor: The illumians magical heritage is tied to the

Plane of Shadow.

Superior Literacy: Illumians are always literate, regard-

less of their character class. Speak Language is always a

class skill for illumians, regardless of class.

Automatic  Languages:  Common  and  Illumian.  Bonus

Languages:  Any  except  for  secret  languages  (such  as

Druidic).  Illumians  love  languages  and  travel  far  and

wide to learn new languages from other races.

Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a mul-

ticlass illumian takes an experience point penalty, her

highest-level class does not count. (See XP for Multiclass

Characters, page 60 of the Players Handbook.) Illumians

hold versatility in high esteem, and most members of

the race are multiclass characters. Furthermore, illumian

paladins and monks can leave those classes and return

to them without penalty.

PSYCHOLOGY

Illumians  are  driven  by  the  need  to  understand  a  given

situation, then master it. An illumian wants to be the one

who nds the aw in the blackguards strategy, or who casts

the perfect spell to destroy the lich forever. Illumians would

rather lose a ght to a superior foe than defeat a less capable

enemyespecially if they were able to demonstrate grit

and brains in the losing effort. Winning and losing dont

matter, but mastery does (and mastery and victory tend to

go hand in hand).

Of course, illumians are realistic enough to recognize that

no individual can master everything. Accordingly, illumians

settle for demonstrating competence at tasks beyond their

true calling. An illumian ghter, for example, might seek

mastery of the dire ail, but hell take enough ranks in Ride

to call himself a competent equestrian.

The  ip  side  to  an  illumians  drive  for  mastery  is  his

predilection for variety. Once an illumian is satised with

his level of competence or mastery in a specic area, hell

enthusiastically move on to something new. This craving

for variety eventually pushes illumians beyond the walls

of  their  cabals  stronghold.  Illumians  often  progress  in

completely different elds, which is why mid- to high-level

illumians are so often multiclass characters. An illumian

paladin, for example, might have become satised with his

martial  prowess  and  now  seeks  expertise  in  the  shadow

arts of stealth and subterfuge by taking a level or two in

the rogue class.

Roleplaying  Application:  If  youre  playing  an  illu-

mian character, keep in mind that an illumian is driven

to study a situation before jumping in. Your character is

more likely to ready actions in combat and even delay to

achieve a better sense of how a ght is shaping up before

he or she acts.

An illumian character is eager to demonstrate his mastery.

If your character is condent of his abilities, he might take

extra risks to win a ght or contest in spectacular fashion.

In a sword duel, he might try to disarm a wounded foe and

extract  a  surrender  rather  than  ending  the  ght  as  soon

as possible. Hell be tempted to use esh to stone when hold

person would be just as effective. But when his life and his

comrades  are  endangered,  he  wont  engage  in  wasteful

displays of power.

ILLUMIAN PLOTTERS

The drive for mastery among illumians manifests itself in

another way: a complex, hierarchical social structure. In

any group, an illumian is acutely aware of her position in

the hierarchy. Even more than humans, illumians have an

instinctive drive to be at the top of their hierarchy. Vying

for social position is entirely natural to illumians, and they

are  puzzled  by  social  structures  that  limit  advancement

by birth, gender, race, or other immutable characteristics.

Until theyve studied the matter, illumians might have a

hard time understanding why a serf cant become a lord or

why the elderly king retains his crown when his sons are

clearly more capable rulers.

When  the  social  structure  in  question  is  populated

entirely  by  illumians  (as  is  the  case  in  most  illumian

cabals), the competition for social status can grow intense,

with each illumian plotting her own rise to power while

guarding  her  position  against  the  predations  of  rivals.

But  because  the  drive  for  mastery  is  so  instinctive  to

illumians, they rarely take the ebb and ow of political

fortunes within a cabal personally. Illumians are pragmatic

enough to realize that within their cabal, todays rival may

be  tomorrows  ally.  They  dont  bear  grudges  unless  the

political  machinations  of  their  fellows  have  unusually

cruel or disruptive results.

Illumians love language and are intensely social, eagerly

engaging friend and stranger alike in conversation. But just

as with other activities, an illumian isnt conversing simply

for  the  sake  of  comradeship.  Hes  assessing  his  relative

position in the social hierarchy, trying to learn as much

as he can about his conversation partner, and looking for

opportunities to demonstrate his mastery of a conversation.

Perceptive  conversationalists  who  spend  time  talking  to

illumians feel as if their every word is being scrutinized.

They  sense  that  theyre  being  sized  up  even  in  casual

conversation, as if the illumian is looking for potential allies

and possible rivals.

Roleplaying  Application:  The  illumian  tendency  to

foment plots and intrigues isnt an excuse to spread discord

within your characters party or around the gaming table.

But an illumian character probably takes an interest in whos

running the kingdomand an intense interest in who is

the power behind the throne. An illumian character tends

to  be  the  rst  to  suspect  a  double-cross  from  patrons  or

allies, and a particularly amoral illumian is probably the rst

character to suggest a double-cross if itll help the group.

THE ILLUMIAN LIFE

The outside world sees illumians as power-obsessed schem-

ers who wall themselves off in isolated strongholdsand

theres certainly an element of truth behind the stereotype.

But  what  nonillumians  dont  realize  is  that  illumians

wouldnt want it any other way. Illumians relish the oppor-

tunity  to  wield  power  from  behind  the  scenes,  because

doing so demonstrates their mastery while employing the

studied caution that is an illumian trademark.

Illumians live in isolated strongholds known as cabals.

Each cabal forms a support and training network for the

machinations of the senior leadership. Equal parts fortress,

monastery, college, and way station, the cabal is the center

of illumian life. Almost all illumians grow up within the

cabals walls, learn a profession from the cabals instructors,

and strive to earn a seat at the Black Table where the cabals

leaders rule.

The day-to-day life of an illumian is dictated by the needs

of the cabal. Younger illumians spend their time in train-

ing, while their elders act on orders from the Black Table.

Depending on a particular illumians station and abilities,

the Black Tables directive could be anything from Operate

the cabals pottery kiln to Summon a powerful elemental

and bind it to the cabals service to Assassinate the mayor

of the human town to the north.

While an illumians daily duties vary widely, its possible

to make a few generalizations about life within the walls of

a cabal.

LEISURE

Illumians  nd  the  concept  of  leisure  for  its  own  sake  a

foreign notion. They teach their children from birth that

spare  time  is  wastefulcalisthenics  or  meditation  is  an

acceptable  substitute  if  they  cant  nd  something  more

productive  to  accomplish.  An  illumian  is  never  happier

than when shes putting her skills and powers on the line

in a bid for mastery. Dispelling a rivals protective spells,

stealing a lorebook from a dragons hoard, or completely

beheading a hydrathats fun for an illumian.

But while illumians spurn leisure, they crave variety in

their  studies  and  exercises.  Illumians  tend  to  be  patient

and goal-oriented, discounting simple pleasures such as a

streetside puppet show or a tankard of ale at the local tavern.

Theyd genuinely rather be learning a southern dialect of

Draconic, resharpening their crossbow bolts, or observing

the patrol routines of the city guard.

This doesnt mean that illumians are killjoys. A traveling

illumian might nd a late-night chess opponent in an elf

party member, but he would reject the very idea that chess

counts as leisure, instead regarding the game as training in

strategic thinking and anticipation of an opponents future

actions. Likewise, an illumian might regard a card game as

an exercise in memorization and probability math. Others

accuse illumians of taking the fun out of everyday events,

but they derive a great degree of satisfaction from turning

trivial activities into useful training.

Roleplaying Application: When everyone elses charac-

ter is resting and relaxing, think about how your illumian is

spending her time. She volunteers for every menial task, as

long as it supports the overall party effort. She likes taking

night watch, doesnt mind digging fortications, and nds

copying ancient maps a worthy activity. Your character also

favors useful activities rather than trivial ones. Why spend

a night lounging in the common room of the inn, shell ask

her comrades, when they could be knitting together new

links for a suit of chainmail?

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Illumians  appreciate  and  savor  lifes  luxuriesfrom  the

taste of spicy food to the poetry of an ancient epic to the

glitter of a jeweled pendantbut their enjoyment of these

pleasures is ancillary to a more prosaic purpose. An illumian

cares more about the nourishment of the food, the magic

lore  embedded  within  the  epic  poem,  and  the  portable

wealth of the pendant.

Illumians  create  art  for  three  reasons:  to  inspire  their

fellows, to pass along information, and to show off their

skill as artists.

Stylistically, illumians favor a sort of idealized realism in

their art. Portraiture is particularly common, whether in the

form of a marble bust, an oil painting, or a chalk drawing

in a sketchbook or historical tome. Many illumian cabals

have a hall of revered destinies in their fortresses, full of

marble busts and oil paintings of champions and historical

gures important to the cabal.

The wall frescoes that commonly decorate a cabals inte-

rior walls feature group portraits of illumians important

to the cabal, as well as battle scenes that depict illumians

57

slaying monsters and  defeating foes. Both the  portraits

and  the  battle  scenes  are  highly  posed,  with  the  more

important  illumians  occupying  higher  positions  in  the

painting.  Traditional  illumian  paintings  never  depict

anyone  looking  down  on  the  central  illumiantheir

eyes  are  always  lower  than  the  sigils  that  surround  the

illumians head.

Another stylistic conceit common in illumian art is the

sigils themselves, which are an exception to the illumian

tendency  toward  realism.  Traditional  illumian  portraits

dont show the actual sigils that  oat around the head of a

particular illumian. Instead, the artist paints the name of

the subject (in Illumian) where the sigils would ordinarily

 oat. Sculptors employ a similar technique, but the limita-

tions of the medium mean that they rely on illusion magic

to create the  oating names.

Even  illumian  jewelry  and  decorative  arts  follow  the

trend  toward  realism.  Illumian  handcrafts  are  intended

to represent a speci c creature or object: a necklace that

looks like a serpent, a ruby pendant that looks like a drop

of blood on an open palm, and so on. Embroidery and other

decorations on clothes likewise depict real objects. The edge

of a cloak, for example, likely bears an embroidered feather

or vein pattern, not a simple stripe or abstract design.

Treasure:  The  following  art  objects  are  particularly

demonstrative  of  illumian  culture.  They  can

replace or supplement treasure generated

on  Table  37,  page  55  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide.

In addition, certain mundane items

are  more  likely  to  appear  in  illumian

treasure hoards. Masterwork artisans tools

take the form of a  ne calligraphy kit, and

a disguise kit (which includes a

selection of rare cosmet-

ics) is twice as likely to appear. Eliminate the climbers kit

entry on Table 38, page 56 of the  Dungeon Masters Guide,

and replace it with 5968   Disguise kit (50 gp).

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

A magical ritual created the  rst illumians, and as a result

the race has close ties to magic. Furthermore, the illumian

facility for language and love of the written word nudges

many of them into wizard trainingat least as a sideline

to their other pursuits.

Because illumians have such a strong magical heritage,

they regard the study of such arts quite highly. An illumian

who learns the greatest arcane secrets isnt just expanding

the study of magic, but delving into the forces that created

his race.

Diviner and illusionist wizards are particularly common

among illumians, because those spells are so useful in an

intrigue- and espionage- lled world. However, the races

most powerful wizards and sorcerers include a multitude

of enchantment spells in their repertoires. The power word

spells, above all enchantments, are regarded with particular

awe by illumians.

Illumians  are  a  young  race,  and  their  deities  attained

godhood only within the last few centuries. As a result, they

dont show the same fervor for divine magic that humans

do. Illumian clerics are as likely to worship a nonillumian

deityor  venerate  a  set  of  philosophical  principlesas

they are to pray to an illumian god.

Illumian enclaves always feature an extensive library

of  arcane  texts,  bestiaries,  biographies  of  important

magicians,  outer-plane  travelogues,  and  tomes  of  inter-

est  to  spellcasters.  Illumian  wizards  create  spellbooks

with  various  magical  protections,  and  theyre

discovery while carrying out a mission

willing  to  trade  a  nely  crafted  spellbook  for  lore  they

dont possess.

Illumian enclaves show off the races afnity for alphabets

and  languages  in  another  way:  Secure  areas  are  guarded

with glyphs of warding, explosive runes, or one of the symbol

spells.

Many  illumian  enclaves  also  include  a  magic  portal

that leads to Elirhondas, the illumian city on the Plane of

Shadow. Older illumian enclaves still maintain portals to

the Astral Plane, where the illumians Great Library once

stood before the githyanki sacked it centuries ago.

ILLUMIANS AT WAR

When Tarmuid created the rst illumians centuries ago,

he instructed them to form cabals across the surface of the

worlda directive the illumians took to heart. Illumians

do not openly govern great cities or nations, although more

than one monarch is under the secret inuence or control

of an illumian cabal. Illumian wars tend to be small-scale

affairs involving a handful of cabals and less than a thousand

illumians. But what they lack in epic grandeur, illumian

battles make up for in subterfuge and ruthlessness.

Conict among illumians occurs most commonly when

two cabals nd themselves working at cross-purposes and

are unable to settle the issue diplomatically. Such silent

wars begin with various dirty tricks, then gradually escalate

into sabotage and assassination before culminating in an

all-out assault on the fortress of one of the cabals. Illumians

employ nonillumians as willing allies or uninformed cat-

spaws, but in either case many of the casualties in a silent

war arent aware of the true nature of the battle.

For example, the Bloodwing cabal provides covert assis-

tance to the church of St. Cuthbert in the duchy of Rossalia,

while the Graypeak cabal works at inltrating the Rossalian

dukes court. When a schism develops between the duke

and the church, the Bloodwing and Graypeak cabals nd

themselves at war with each other. The silent war begins

when  a  Graypeak-controlled  magistrate  revokes  citizen-

ship rights for Bloodwing members openly working with

the  church  of  St.  Cuthbert.  The  Bloodwings  retaliate  by

revealing war crimes in the magistrates past, forcing him

to retire in disgrace. Though no one has fallen in battle and

the two sides havent spoken directly, silent war has been

declared between the Bloodwings and Graypeaks.

The Graypeaks magically disrupt various religious rituals

performed by St. Cuthberts clerics, and the Bloodwings arm

the bandits that live in the Rossalian backcountry. Although

the rest of the duchys citizens dont realize it, theyve been

drawn into the silent war as well: The bandit attacks draw

away  the  dukes  soldiers,  and  attendance  dwindles  at  St.

Cuthberts temples. Then a team of Graypeak rogues steals

a number of relics from the main St. Cuthbert cathedral,

offering  to  return  them  if  St.  Cuthberts  clergy  spurns

its allegiance with the Bloodwing cabal. In response, the

Graypeaks  intentionally  fail  in  an  assassination  attempt

on  the  dukebut  the  assassin  claims  allegiance  to  the

Bloodwings before killing himself.

As the Bloodwing-backed bandits menace the provin-

cial capital, the Bloodwings make a dealan expensive

onewith  the  Northsun  cabal  to  learn  the  location  of

the Graypeak cabals fortress. The Bloodwings assault the

fortress  with  every  cabal  member  they  can  muster  and

every mercenary they can afford. The surprise attack is

a success, most of the Graypeaks are killed or captured,

and the Bloodwings recover the St. Cuthbert relics. The

Bloodwings  have  won,  but  they  are  impoverished  and

exposed. The Northsun cabal knows rsthand how weak

the Bloodwing cabal is, and now it prepares to expand its

inuence into Rossalia.

More  rarely,  an  illumian  cabal  specically  targets

another  cabalprobably  because  the  target  has  access

to magic, lore, or a power source that the aggressor cabal

wants. This activity is particularly common among ascen-

sion cabals and gauntlet cabals (described below), which

tend to be more aggressive than other cabal types.

While  illumians  most  often  war  among  themselves,

that isnt to say that every cabal is too paranoid to trust its

fellows. Illumians are nothing if not pragmatic, and they

recognize the value of reliable allies. When two cabals form

an alliance, they usually exchange a number of members,

jointly reveal secrets to one another, and intertwine their

operations as much as possible. The closer the integration

between two allied cabals, the less likely a betrayal will

occur, because each cabal can quickly wreck the operations

of the other.

Because illumians live in isolated fortresses and work

their plots subtly, its rare for a nonillumian army to make

war on them. But if a cabals palace plot goes awry, an angry

king  may  mount  a  crusade  and  besiege  the  offending

cabals fortress. Illumians rarely meet such threats head

on.  Theyre more  likely to foment  revolution  elsewhere

to distract the king, or subvert the military leaders of the

retribution force, often with magic, bribes, or promises of

power.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

The main social bond a typical illumian feels is to his or

her  cabal.  Because  the  cabal  raises  its  children  together,

bonds of family arent nearly as important as they are to

other races, but loyalty to the cabal is reinforced each and

every day within the walls of the enclave.

A  cabal  consists  of  between  one  hundred  and  three

hundred members. At any given time, more than 90 percent

of  a  cabals  members  live  within  the  walls  of  the  cabals

fortresslike enclave. There they study, raise their children,

provide for the cabals defense, and hatch plots for use in

the outside world. Some illumians never leave the safety

of their cabals enclave, although most journey beyond its

walls on missions from time to time.

CABAL STRUCTURE

Every cabal has its own structure, but most adhere in gen-

eral terms to the structure of the  rst cabals established by

Tarmuid when he created the illumian race and bade them

spread across the world.

A council of elders known as the Black Table rules each

cabal.  They  set  broad  objectives  for  each  of  the  cabals

directorates:  groups  of  several  dozen  illumians  led  by  a

director. The directors make the day-to-day decisions that

keep the cabal running, from how to acquire provisions to

which magical experiments to attempt.

A cabal might maintain directorates for defense, child

rearing,  magical  research,  espionage,  internal  loyalty,

resource acquisition, and religion. The Black Table assigns

all adult illumians to a directorate, and the director who

leads that directorate assigns daily tasks that further the

directorates (and by extension the cabals) goals.

Most  cabals  include  a  few  nonillumian  members,  but

these  individuals  rarely  interact  with  the  culture  of  the

enclaves, instead acting as go-betweens or long-term spies

in larger communities near the enclave. Members of other

races  nd long-term residence among an illumian cabal to

be sti ing and monotonous. Short-term visits are another

matter. Illumians tend to be hospitable (to invited guests,

anyway) and accommodating, so those who have spent a

week or two within the walls of an illumian enclave remark

more on its orderly, peaceful nature than on the regimented,

driven aspects of cabal life.

Black  Table:  The  original  cabals  set  nine  seats  at  the

Black Table, although the size of this ruling body can vary

between six and twelve. Illumians and only illumians sit at

the Black Table, and they do so for life. When a vacant seat

opens at the Black Table, those who hold seats send an in-

vitation (often but not always to

a  current  director)

to  someone

satisfactory to at least two-thirds of those currently seated

at the Black Table.

By  custom,  the  oldest  illumian  at  the  Black  Table  acts

as a chairperson when the group meets, but each seat at

the table has an equal say in the affairs of the cabal. The

youngest illumian at the Black Table functions as a liaison

between the ruling body and the rest of the community,

issuing decrees and taking matters of import back to the

Black Table for consideration. The other illumians who sit

at the Black Table remain aloof from the rest of the cabal,

preferring the company of their fellows and relishing the

deference that other illumians show them.

Director: While those who sit at the Black Table can be

aloof,  mysterious   gures,  the  directors  are  the  hands-on

leaders of the cabal and the most well-known (if not always

the most popular) members. Cabals have between six and

twelve directorates, each with dozens of members. Some

directorates  handle  mundane  tasks  required  to  keep  the

community functioning, such as gathering food, maintain-

ing the enclave, and caring for children. Other directorates

handle more dangerous or dif cult work: protecting the

cabal  from  attack,  keeping  rivals  under  surveillance,  or

conducting magical experiments.

Directors serve at the pleasure of the Black Table, and

they can be removed or reassigned by decree of the ruling

body. In practice this happens only when a directors ethics

or competence is called into question, because bad direc-

tors re ect poorly on the Black Table that appointed them.

Directors suspected of wrongdoing or guilty of frequent

failure are summoned before the Black Table long before

the rest of the cabal knows of a leadership crisis.

The directors of large directorates empower sub directors

to make decisions on minor matters. For example, the direc-

tor of a large cabals defense

directorate might

have  subdi-

The rulers of an illumian cabal take their responsibilities very seriously

godhood. After Tarmuid created the Ritual of Words Made

Flesh, he spent the rest of his mortal life trying to nd a

way for the Illumian language to express a divine state. He

succeeded on his deathbed, and Tarmuids nal utterance

has inspired other illumians to attempt the same feat. So

far  only  a  handful  of  illumians  have  successfully  made

nal utterances (see Illumian Deities, below). Despite the

low  success  rate,  dozens  of  cabals  across  the  multiverse

feverishly conduct magical research in hopes of making a

chosen illumian ready to attempt a nal utterance and take

the mantle of godhood.

Some ascension cabals are little more than cults of per-

sonality led by the most powerful illumian in residence.

Others have made signicant progress in unlocking the

secrets of immortality and divine power.

Ascension  cabals  are  often  named  after  the  illumian

who seeks godhood with the cabals help. Notable ascen-

sion cabals include Chelshae, Sons of Galadan, Zhukasti,

Finalsteps, and Valak Ascendant.

Typical  Directorates:  Ascension  cabals  maintain  the

usual array of directorates, named in honor of the illumian

deity-to-be. For example, the Sons of Galadan cabal refers

to its intelligence directorate as The Eyes of Galadan, the

defense directorate as the Fists of Galadan, and the resource

directorate as the Bounty of Galadan. The personal retinue

and servants of the would-be deity form a directorate unto

themselves, and research-related directorates are as large as

the cabal can manage.

rectors  for  day  watch,  night  watch,  magical  defenses,

strategic reserve, and training. Directors can hire and re

subdirectors as they wish.

Arbiter: Almost every cabal has a justice directorate, which

in a small cabal consists of just one illumian: the arbiter. An

arbiter is the judge and jury for crimes committed within

the  walls  of  the  cabals  enclavehe  or  she  orders  arrests,

questions witnesses, decides the case, and metes out punish-

ment. If the cabal has more than a few dozen members, the

justice directorate will be lled out with subarbiters who act

as investigators and court ofcers for the arbiter. Subarbiters

can make arrests, question suspects, and research illumian

case law, but only the arbiter can render judgments.

Lorekeeper: Lore directorates are also common among

illumian cabals. The director, referred to as the lorekeeper,

functions as the head librarian for the cabal. Lorekeepers

are expected to have great familiarity with the  tomes  in

their keeping, and as a result lorekeepers are great sages

and researchers. Many illumians aspire to the position of

lorekeeper because of their love of language. In some cabals,

the lorekeeper is more highly regarded than the illumians

who sit at the Black Table.

Final Seed: From the earliest days of the illumian race,

cabals have sent one or more capable members to live away

from the enclave. These members, known as the nal seed,

have only one duty: rebuild the cabal should misfortune

befall it. Final seeds are given copies of key illumian texts

so they can start a new library if they have to, and they know

how to contact friendly cabals for aid.

While illumians agree that being chosen as a nal seed is

a great honorthey are considered paragons of the cabals

idealsmany accept the honor only with great reluctance.

A nal seed must live apart from the safety of the cabal,

visiting it only briey. For illumians who have grown up in

the structured environment of their enclaves, the outside

world can be a lonely, bewildering place.

Roleplaying  Application:  Think  about  the  position

your  character  held  in  his  or  her  cabal  before  he  or  she

became an adventurer, and how he or she interacted with

the cabal leadership. Perhaps you studied at the elbow of

the loremaster, or maybe the arbiter investigated you for a

crime you didnt commit.

CABAL TYPES

While all illumian cabals have the same overall structure

(Black  Table  rulers  instructing  multiple  directorates,  all

secreted away in an isolated enclave), they have varied goals.

A  cabal  that  communes  with  the  spirits  of  its  members

ancestors  has  different  goals,  and  thus  a  different  set  of

directorates, than a cabal devoted to protecting the Gam-

rakian Forest from further harm.

Ascension Cabals

Among  the  more  mysterious  types  of  cabals,  ascension

cabals exist to help one or more of their members achieve

Plots:  Ascension  cabals  keep  an  eye  on  their  neigh-

borsthe better to protect the ascending illumianbut the

majority of their plots involve tracking down lore about the

nal utterance and the ascension process. This means garner-

ing lore from rival illumian cabals, whether ascension cabals

or otherwise. A rival ascension cabal might possess previously

unknown aspects of the nal utterance, and cabals of differ-

ent types might have clues to ascension in their histories and

arcane tomes. Because cabals closely guard their knowledge,

ascension cabals dont hesitate to resort to trickery, theft, or

violence to acquire the information they seek.

Intracabal  plotting  is  likewise  erce  among  ascension

cabals. Mid- to high-level members of a cabal  constantly

jockey for position, try to curry favor with the deity-to-be,

or even supplant the ascendant ones place on the path to

divinity.

Enemies  and  Allies:  More  ascension  cabals  collapse

from within than are destroyed from without. Either the

inghting over the illumian chosen for ascendancy tears

the cabal apart, or the cabal disperses after a candidate for

godhood fails to make a proper nal utterance. More rarely,

an ascension cabal falls to an outside force such as another

ascension cabal, a stronger cabal angered by too-aggressive

lore seeking, or some magical or monstrous force the cabal

unwittingly unleashed.

Ascension cabals have few external enemies, and likewise

few allies. Ascension can bring little to an alliance other

than  a  promise  of  a  gods  favor  when  ascension  occurs,

and thats a promise that few nonillumians take seriously.

Particularly charismatic illumians in charge of an ascension

cabal can sometimes found their own mystery cults and

attract nonillumian worshipers.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in ascension cabals.

An illumian cleric of Tarmuid who voluntarily leaves an

ascension cabal, nagged by doubts over whether Tarmuid

wants more illumians to achieve a divine state.

An  illumian  ghter/wizard  whose  spirit  was  deemed

not strong enough to achieve divinity, but whose older

brother is a candidate for ascension.

An illumian ranger/bard walking the earth, looking for

clues about the nal utterance on behalf of her ascension

cabal.

Enclaves:  The  enclaves  of  ascension  cabals  look  like

temples or churches. They include sanctuaries, altars, and

areas set aside for various ceremonies to honor the deity-

in-waiting.  The  living  quarters  of  the  ascendant  one  are

generally  lavish,  if  for  no  other  reason  than  the  various

directorates competition to please the future deity.

Compared  to  other  kinds  of  cabals,  ascension  cabals

defend  their  enclaves  lightly.  They  tend  to  possess  less

magic, lore, and riches than other cabals because theyre so

focused on achieving ascension. An ascension cabal enclave

is relatively easy to nd, but the outside world regards it as

just another cult out in the wilderness.

Adventure Hook: After acquiring an important piece

of lore for an ascension cabal, the PCs are invited to remain

in the enclave while the ascendant one attempts a nal

utterance.  But  the  nal  utterance  fails,  and  the  illumi-

ans  blame  the  PCs,  accusing  them  of  providing  altered

manuscripts on orders from a rival ascension cabal. The

illumians try to imprison the PCs within their enclave,

and the PCs have to escape the clutches of illumians who

blame them for the death of an illumian who was on the

cusp of immortality.

Chain Cabals

Chain  cabals  are  one  of  the  two  most  common  kinds  of

illumian cabal (gauntlet cabals are the other). Chain cabals

pride themselves on their top-notch spy networks, which

inltrate  nearby  power  centers  such  as  governments,

churches, and even monster lairs. Preservation of the status

quowith the cabal kept safe to observe everythingis

the highest goal of a chain cabal.

Notable chain cabals include Bloodwing, Rustdreamer,

Blackpennant, Thirdhorizon, and Kilnre.

Typical Directorates: A chain cabal has a spy directorate

for each power in its immediate region, usually named with

an  Eyes  on  construction.  For  example,  the  Bloodwing

cabal is concerned with the machinations of the Sumberton

nobility, the barghest-led Hellmaw tribe of goblinoids in the

nearby forest, and a mysterious group of Tiamat-worshiping

dragon cultists. The Bloodwings have an Eyes on Sumberton

directorate, an Eyes on Hellmaw directorate, and an Eyes

on Tiamat directorate.

Nearly all cabals include a directorate with a mandate to

observe the outside world, but the Eyes on chain director-

ates are more aggressive than others. When the subject of

its spying threatens the regional status quo, a directorate

takes  covert  actiondiplomatic  maneuvering,  sabotage,

or even assassinationto keep the illumians safe and the

existing power structure intact.

Chain cabals also maintain home directorates responsible

for administering the enclave and education directorates

that  raise  young  illumians.  Directorates  devoted  to  the

enclaves defense and research are present in nearly every

chain cabal.

Plots:  Chain  cabals,  acting  through  their  Eyes  on

directorates,  spend  their  efforts  upholding  the  status

quo. Usually, nonillumians dont even know of the cabals

existenceand if they did, they wouldnt necessarily be

happy about it. For every chain cabal that keeps a placid

province free of marauding monsters and political skull-

duggery, another chain cabal keeps a tyrant in power and

her people impoverished. Chain cabals tend to be amoral,

interested only in preserving existing conditions and keep-

ing themselves unobtrusive and safe.

Intracabal plotting is particularly rife among chain cabals.

Directorates responsible for spying on the outside world plot

against each other as they compete for the cabals resources

and the Black Tables attention. Some go so far as to plant

agents  in  a  rival  directorates  ranks  or  sabotage  crucial

missions so the rival directorate will be embarrassed and

politically weakened. The Black Table stamps out overheated

rivalries when it nds out about them, unless the rivalry

has escalated to the point where the members of the Black

Table themselves take part.

Enemies and Allies: The Eyes on directorates prize

agents  who  blend  in  with  their  targets,  so  chain  cabals

employ nonillumian allieshumanoids who live nearby

or wield signicant political power. Shapechangers such

as  doppelgangers  are  enticed  with  riches  to  join  a  chain

cabal, or threatened with exposure if they spurn the cabals

advances.

A  chain  cabal  tends  to  have  few  enemies  because  its

adept at remaining secret, or at least deecting attention

away  from  itself  in  a  crisis.  But  by  denition,  the  Eyes

on directorates target the powerful forces near the cabals

enclave. If a government or other regional power discovers

evidence of illumian spyingand survives the destabilizing

missions the illumians are sure to launchthe chain cabal

has created a motivated and powerful enemy.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in chain cabals.

An  illumian  rogue/sorcerer  condent  in  his  ability  to

inltrate any place at any time.

An  illumian  barbarian/druid  who  has  spent  so  much

time in deep cover as a tribal shaman that she wonders

where her true loyalties lie.

An illumian bard who travels the land, delivering and

receiving secret messages for an Eyes on directorates

agents.

Enclaves:  Because  they  expend  their  effort  in  covert

actions, chain cabals have relatively modest enclaves, such

as  a  well-guarded  keep  in  the  middle  of  nowhere.  Some

chain cabals build portals or teleportation circles that help

their agents travel back and forth between their targets and

the cabals enclave.

Chain cabals also develop a network of safe houses and

secret lairs where members can meet without returning to

the main enclave. Such places are well hidden and heavily

trapped  against  intruders.  An  abandoned  siege  tunnel,

forgotten  catacombs,  and  an  unassuming  at  above  a

merchants shop are havens where the spies of a chain cabal

might meet in secret.

Adventure Hook: Despite the best efforts of illumian

agents, the king has granted land and title to three retired

generalsland right next to the enclave of a chain cabal.

The chain cabal turns to the PCs, asking them to inltrate

the inner circle of the new nobles. When they do, they learn

that the retired generals were known both for their ambition

and their ruthlessness. Thats why the king granted them

land as far from the capital as possible.

Eclipse Cabals

Nobody knows how many eclipse cabals exist, and thats

the point. When Tarmuid, the creator of the illumian race,

assembled the rst cabals, he gave each a fragment of the

Ritual of the Word Made Flesh and commanded the illu-

mians to keep it safe. The eclipse cabals havent expanded

beyond Tarmuids original mandate. They keep themselves

as secret as possible, devoted utterly to protecting the part

of the ritual in their possession. The perfect eclipse cabal

disappears  shortly  after  its  founding,  reappearing  only

when the illumian people need to reassemble the Ritual

of Words Made Flesh.

They arent well known, but Duskwatcher, Blacktower,

Driftcloud,  Rubytalon,  and  Evershade  are  all  names  of

eclipse cabals.

Typical Directorates: Eclipse cabals maintain the same

directorates as other cabals: administration, defense, educa-

tion,  and  resources.  If  an  eclipse  cabal  has  an  espionage

directorate  or  a  research  directorate,  its  usually  rather

small.

Plots: Eclipse cabals tend to be drawn into plots unwill-

ingly,  because  all  they  care  about  is  keeping  their  very

existence a secret. A cabal might have to take action, how-

ever, against someone who learns its secret. Members of an

eclipse cabal also might need to leave its enclave periodically

to refresh its magical protections or acquire resources the

enclave cant provide for itself. Finally, eclipse cabals are

storehouses for items and lore from the earliest days of the

illumians.

Enemies and Allies: An eclipse cabal spurns an alliance

on the rare occasion when someone nds the cabal in the

rst place. No one is to be trusted beyond the cabalnot

even well-meaning noneclipse illumians. Eclipse cabals

rely almost exclusively on allies whose loyalty is beyond

question, such as constructs and summoned creatures.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in eclipse cabals.

An illumian rogue desperate to escape the boredom of

the enclave and see the wider world rsthand.

An  illumian  cleric/paladin  on  a  quest  to  nd  a  rare

magical object to restore the fading illusions around his

enclave.

An illumian ranger/wizard exiled from an eclipse cabal

for a crime she cant remember. The cabal wiped clean

her memories so she couldnt reveal the location of the

enclave.

Enclaves: Eclipse cabals have the most well-protected

enclaves. They are always located in forbidding, isolated

places far from curious eyes, protected by layer after layer

of illusions and mundane camouage. An intruder who

pierces  the  veils  that  obscure  an  eclipse  enclave  must

contend with a heavily trapped fortress guarded by magical

constructs and illumians desperate to keep their existence

a secret.

Adventure  Hook:  A  researcher  in  an  eclipse  cabal

accidentally  unleashes  a  magical  plague  that  wipes  out

almost the entire cabal. One illumian teleports away and

hires  the  PCs  to  bring  their  healing  magic  back  to  the

enclave. The PCs must nd the enclave and gain entrance,

but their illumian guide has never been outside and doesnt

know about the cabals defenses. Once the PCs deal with

the plague, theyll have to contend with illumians who are

gratefulbut  not  about  to  let  anyone  leave  the  enclave

knowing its location.

Gauntlet Cabals

While chain cabals spin a web of intrigue to preserve the

status  quo,  gauntlet  cabals  use  espionage  as  a  means  of

control. They dont have armies at their disposal, so they

employ a combination of diplomacy, magic, and trickery

to  exert  inuence  on  the  political  and  religious  leaders

near their enclave.

Notable gauntlet cabals include Stormwind, Blackame,

Palerider, Warhorn, and Frostpeak.

Typical Directorates: Gauntlet cabals have the usual

directorates  focused  on  the  cabals  upkeep:  resources,

education, defense, and research. But because the outside

world  draws  their  attention,  gauntlet  cabals  produce

a  number  of  agents  who  work  beyond  the  walls  of  the

enclave.  Gauntlet  cabals  organize  multiple  directorates

devoted to diplomatic efforts, espionage, and small-scale

military actions, divided both by the kind of activity and

the target. For example, one directorate might be respon-

sible for diplomacy and espionage against Baron Vulreget,

while another directorate spies on the barons army and a

third handles the cabals relations with the rebels seeking

the barons overthrow.

Because gauntlet cabals seek as much power and control

as  they  can  manage,  the  directorates  within  a  particular

gauntlet cabal shift as the cabal wins victories and suffers

defeats. A directorate assigned to overthrow a churchs hold

on a particular province, for example, disbands or takes on

new duties once it succeeds at destroying the church. As

a result, the directorates within a gauntlet cabal may have

vague names or names that dont describe what they actually

do. The Stormwind cabal, for example, has a special projects

directorate that handles issues of internal loyalty, a third

column  directorate  that  handles  magical  threats,  and  an

honor directorate that trains elite strike teams, which are

then used by the other directorates.

Plots: Gauntlet cabals are ambitious and always active,

constantly fomenting plots against political, religious, and

magical powers. The local government near a gauntlet cabal

is always riddled with spies in the pay of the illumians,

and  a  successful  gauntlet  cabal  has  achieved  direct  or

indirect control over the governments actions as well. A

gauntlet cabal likewise tries to control or drive off powerful

individuals or monsters (such as the wizard in the mysteri-

ous tower or the blue dragon lairing nearby).

The most effective gauntlet cabals act as puppet masters,

using their pawns to control others. For example, a gauntlet

cabal might use blackmail and magic to control the com-

mander  of  a  military  garrison,  then  turn  that  garrison

against the elf community in a nearby forest. Or the gauntlet

cabal could have the garrison pledge its troops to a religious

crusade sponsored by the local church of Heironeousin

exchange for the placement of a few illumians in the higher

levels of the priesthood.

Enemies  and  Allies:  Gauntlet  cabals  rarely  lack

enemiesany group that has fallen on the wrong side of a

gauntlet cabal plot is a potential foe. On the other hand, if

the cabals plans come to fruition, the foe is rarely left with

enough power to exact revenge on the illumians. A careful

gauntlet cabal can avoid reprisals from failed plots by cover-

ing its tracks and pinning the blame on nonillumians. But

no plot is foolproof, and many gauntlet cabals have been

destroyed  by  military  sieges,  magical  attacks,  religious

crusades, and assassinations by secret societies.

Just  as  a  gauntlet  cabal  can  have  nearly  anyone  as  an

enemy, so too can it ally itself with nearly anyone. Gauntlet

cabals care only about power and control, and if an alliance

helps one toward those ends, the cabals Black Table is rarely

squeamish about making a deal. Even an arrangement with

the githyanki isnt out of the question, although any cabal

known to have dealings with them would be ostracized by

other illumians.

A gauntlet cabal has only one implacable enemy: another

gauntlet cabal. When two gauntlet cabals try to control the

same prize, the conict quickly escalates into war; gauntlet

cabals easily recognize the ngerprints of rival illumians.

Gauntlet  cabals  sometimes  war  with  chain  cabals,  who

see the gauntlet cabals efforts as meddling. But because

gauntlet cabals and chain cabals seek different prizes, the

possibility exists for a mutually advantageous pact (turning

a chain cabal into a network of spies for a gauntlet cabal,

which then focuses its attention elsewhere).

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in gauntlet cabals.

An  illumian  rogue  trained  from  birth  as  a  master  of

disguise  and  assassination,  but  then  ensorceled  by  a

would-be target to leave his cabal behind forever.

An illumian cleric/sorcerer who is the sole survivor of

a gauntlet cabal destroyed by demons and who will stop

at nothing to rebuild the cabal.

An illumian ghter/ranger sent into the outside world

by a powerful gauntlet cabal to identify future targets for

the cabals machinations.

Enclaves: Gauntlet cabals know that its just a matter of

time before they anger someone with the wherewithal to

attack the cabals enclave. Therefore, gauntlet cabals spare

no effort to ensure that any attack on the enclave is costly

for the attackers. But unlike eclipse cabals, gauntlet cabals

place less effort on keeping the location of their enclave

secret,  instead  choosing  to  make  the  enclave  obviously

more  trouble  than  its  worth  to  attack.  A  gauntlet  cabal

might establish an enclave in the middle of a swamp, amid

a steep mountain range, or buried deep beneath the earth.

Each enclave features strong battlements clearly augmented

by magic, as well as monstrous defenders such as dragons

and giants.

Inside an enclave, the focus shifts from a demonstration

of strength to a demonstration of power and wealth. Lavish

interior decoration adorns areas seen by nonillumians, the

better  to  court  visitors  to  the  enclave  as  potential  allies.

Colorful illusion magic, magically animated statues, and

richly dressed servants project the impression that the cabal

is successful and so an alliance might be lucrative.

Adventure Hook: A horde of barbaric orcs is invading

settled lands near a gauntlet cabal. The cabal sends the PCs

to turn aside or disperse the horde by any means necessary.

A few weeks into their mission, the PCs receive new orders,

directly from the Black Table: Bring the orc horde to the

capital and sack the palace.

Gibber Cabals

Unlike other kinds of cabals, gibber cabals attract chaotic

illumians. They tend to be smaller cabals, but they perform

an important function: They are responsible for the creation

of  new  words  in  the  Illumian  language.  Gibber  cabals

experiment with nonsense syllables, words, and phrases.

Usually they create only gibberish, but occasionally they

produce a word or phrase with a mystical meaning previ-

ously unknown to illumian scholars.

Gibber cabals otherwise function like typical illumian

cabals. They plot against power structures in their vicinity,

protect their enclave against attack, and accumulate magical

and historic lore.

Gibber cabals assume nonsensical names. Notable gibber

cabals  include  Swordfeather,  Greenmouth,  Ablecadaver,

Turtlewing, and Openstalker.

Typical Directorates: While other cabals take prosaic or

themed names for their directorates, gibber cabals employ

fanciful or nonsense names. While this custom can be con-

fusing to outsiders, those who grow up within the walls of

a gibber cabal enclave know the directorate names through

daily use.

The Openstalker cabal, for example, uses a rhyming slang

to name its directorates. The pretense directorate handles

defense, the besmirch directorate handles magical research,

and the split-sticks directorate handles logistics.

Plots: Gibber cabals devote themselves to various forms

of esoteric magical study, which include experiments that

increase  the  vocabulary  of  the  Illumian  language.  Sages

within gibber cabals contend that when everything in the

universe can be described perfectly in Illumian, those who

speak the language will be able to reshape reality just by

speaking their every desire. Mid- to high-level members of

a gibber cabal rarely leave the enclave because theyre too

busy with magical rituals and experiments.

ones, and march them back to where theyve never been.

Is the prophecy gibberish, or will its meaning be revealed

over time?

An  illumian  cleric/druid  seeking  lore  about  a  chime-

ric  creature  that  looks  like  a  four-winged  feathered

dragonand speaks uent Illumian.

An  illumian  barbarian/bard  craving  new  experiences

that will inspire new words in the Illumian language.

Enclaves:  Gibber  cabals  build  underground  enclaves

so  theyre  less  likely  to  be  disturbed.  Almost  all  feature

twisting corridors, dead-end hallways, frequent illusions,

and a plethora of secret doors. The labyrinthine nature of

a gibber cabal enclave is its best defense. Intruders become

so confused when navigating their way through an enclave

that the cabal can muster an effective hit-and-run defense,

then capture the intruders when they discover they cant

nd the exit.

Adventure Hook: A gibber cabal is paying well for living

specimens of several rare monsters. The cabals research-

ers want to create names in the Illumian language for the

creatures, but they need living examples to do so. The PCs

must  hunt  down  the  monsters  and  keep  them  alive  but

pacied long enough to return them to the gibber cabals

labyrinthine enclave.

Gravewhisper Cabals

Like other illumians, members of gravewhisper cabals speak

uent Illumianbut they speak it to the dead. Gravewhis-

per cabals keep their elder members active after death by

turning  them  into  liches,  vampires,  or  similar  undead.

Gravewhisper researchers study necromancy to the exclu-

sion of other schools of magic, and undead minions guard

the sinister enclaves of the gravewhisper cabals.

Illumians in gravewhisper cabals regard themselves as

more pragmatic than the rest of their race. Theres no need

to lose the accumulated wisdom of the cabal to old age or

misadventure, they contend, when necromantic rituals can

keep those who sit at the Black Table aliveand contribut-

ing to the cabals agendaforever.

Notable gravewhisper cabals include Cryptdelver, Black-

shroud, Finalveil, Darkwake, and Lore-Reborn.

Typical  Directorates:  In  addition  to  the  usual  direc-

torates  of  security,  intelligence,  research,  and  education,

gravewhisper cabals maintain an acquisitions directorate

(which  acquires  unusual  or  noteworthy  bodies  from  the

outside world), a rites directorate (which handles burial and

body-preservation activities), and a deathruler directorate

(which  handles  day-to-day  control  of  the  cabals  undead

minions). The administration directorate, responsible for

feeding and caring for the denizens of the enclave, tends to

be smaller and less powerful than in other kinds of cabals

because many gravewhisper cabal members dont require

sustenance or creature comforts.

Plots:  Gravewhisper  cabals  know  that  much  of  the

outside  world  doesnt  understand  their  fascination  with

Defense  and  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  cabals

enclave  fall  to  lower-level  members  and  those  with  less

interest in magical affairs. Gibber cabals maintain a cadre

of illumian barbarians on guard against enemy attack; illu-

mians from gibber cabals usually have at least a few levels

in the barbarian class to reect a young life spent guarding

the enclave. Gibber cabals sometimes try to inltrate nearby

communities or exert political inuence on a regional scale,

but are too inward-looking to make concerted efforts against

the outside world.

Enemies and Allies: Gibber cabals befriend communi-

ties of outcasts, who then take up residence within or near

the cabals enclave. Given their habit of spouting gibberish,

illumians from gibber cabals tend to be less judgmental than

others. The Swordfeather cabal, for example, draws driders

from  across  the  underground  realms  to  its  labyrinthine

enclave.  Different  gibber  cabals  work  with  lycanthropes

or  with  tieings,  half-celestials,  and  similar  crossbred

creatures. Because gibber cabals feature confusing passages

and mazes, cabals keep trained minotaurs as guards.

Gibber cabals keep to themselves, so they dont have many

enemies. The Swordfeathers battle the drow because the

illumians  harbor  driders,  but  theres  no  other  reason  for

enmity between the two groups.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in gibber cabals.

An illumian barbarian sent out into the wider world with

the prophetic command to muster an army of solitary

necromancy and the undead; on occasion, crusading pala-

dins and various other do-gooders have put gravewhisper

enclaves  to  the  torch.  Gravewhisper  cabals  rely  on  the

wisdom and leadership of powerful undead, so a successful

attack can leave a gravewhisper cabal permanently bereft

of such leadership. Gravewhisper cabals are therefore para-

noid about the safety of their enclaves. They aggressively

inltrate any nearby power structures (political, religious,

or magical) and maintain a network of agents to warn them

of potential threats.

Gravewhisper cabals lust after necromantic lore of all

kinds, going to great lengths to acquire tomes that detail

the ner points of lichdom rituals, ways to contact a soul

after death, and similar matters. They also occasionally

engage in corpse snatching, stealing the body of a recently

deceased noble, hero, or notable citizen. Once the body is

safely ensconced within the gravewhisper cabals enclave,

the  illumians  raise  it,  transform  the  body  into  a  loyal

undead minion, or perform other experiments on it.

Enemies and Allies:  Undead creatures perform  the

basic  functions  within  a  gravewhisper  cabal.  Zombies

and skeletons make up much of the cabals manual labor,

while ghouls and wights guard the enclave from attack.

Shadows and spectres act as the cabals spies in the outside

world. Intelligent undead, however, are actually members

of the cabal, not  just its servants. A gravewhisper  cabal

usually includes vampires or liches among the members

of its Black Table.

Typical Characters: While members of a gravewhisper

cabal tend toward evil, not all need be of that alignment.

Illumians  in  gravewhisper  cabals  regard  the  creation  of

undead as a necessary task to keep the cabals leadership

intact, not a terrible blasphemy that deles both body and

spirit. The following characters are typical of those who

grow up in a gravewhisper cabal.

An illumian cleric of Pelor who has kept secret her fear

and loathing of the undead. After a childhood surrounded

by  creatures  that  repulsed  her,  shes  eager  to  destroy

undead and imprison those who spawn them.

An illumian wizard/monk interested in sharpening both

body and mindby whatever means necessary.

An  illumian  bard/cleric  who  worships  Wee  Jas  and  is

curious about ways to cheat death without resorting to

traditional lichdom or vampirism.

Enclaves:  Gravewhisper  enclaves  feature  extensive

catacombs.  While  the  catacombs  crawl  with  ambulatory

undead,  they  are  dominated  by  bodies  lying  in  various

states of preservation, waiting for resurrection, conversion

to undead, or ritual use.

Adventure Hook: One of the PCs has died in the middle

of an adventure, and the other characters are carrying the

body back to a friendly temple for resurrection. Along the

way, minions and illumian members of a gravewhisper cabal

repeatedly waylay them. The cabal believes, rightly or wrongly,

that the dead PC possesses information that they can acquire

with speak with dead or less savory necromantic rituals.

Quill Cabals

While  vengeance  cabals  take  the  ght  to  the  githyanki,

quill  cabals  instead  attempt  to  reassemble  the  lore  the

illumians lost when the githyanki sacked the Library of

the Sublime. Avaricious book collectors, quill cabals stop

at  nothing  to  acquire  tomes  they  dont  already  possess.

Their libraries are rst-rate, which makes them a target for

forces that desire the knowledge ensconced on the shelves

of illumian enclaves.

Typical Directorates: The two most important director-

ates in a quill cabal are the acquisitions directorate (which

acquires new tomes and lore for the cabals library) and the

collections  directorate  (which  organizes,  researches,  and

guards the library). The other directorates exist solely to

support these two directorates, and the illumians at a quill

cabals  Black  Table  are  almost  all  former  acquisitions  or

collections directors.

Quill cabals also include outreach directorates devoted

to working with libraries in nearby communities, often at

a wizards college or major temple. The illumians arrange

to staff the library with their sages and make loans from

the quill cabals library in exchange for access to the stacks.

While the illumian librarians quickly extract any useful lore

from the library theyre stafng, they remain afterward to

watch for new books.

Plots:  A  quill  cabal  does  its  utmost  to  obtain  new  or

recently discovered books, so the acquisitions directorate

is at the forefront of the cabals plots. An acquisitions direc-

torate might hire explorers to delve into ancient ruins, or

it might sponsor a long journey to acquire a work of great

worthsometimes from a willing seller, but often without

the knowledge of the books current owner.

Quill cabals have their share of intracabal plotting. Con-

ict can emerge between the acquisitions directorate and

the outreach directorate if an outside library has important

lore. The acquisitions directorate wants to seize the material

outright, but the outreach directorate wants to preserve the

relationship with the outside library.

Enemies  and  Allies:  Quill  cabals  maintain  friendly

relations with other kinds of illumian cabalsthey have

a reason to be cordial, and all cabals recognize the value of

rebuilding the storehouse of knowledge that was once the

illumians greatest possession.

Through their outreach directorates, quill cabals develop

powerful allies among wizard colleges, religious libraries,

and collectors of lore. While these alliances are pervasive,

they  dont  always  run  deep.  For  example,  the  church  of

Boccob  may  appreciate  the  librarians  from  a  quill  cabal,

but that doesnt mean they would mount a crusade to save

the cabal from a githyanki attack.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in a quill cabal.

to put to use her obscure knowledge of how to bypass a

ruins ancient traps and protective wards.

An illumian cleric/ranger who travels the world acquiring

rare books on behalf of his cabal.

An illumian paladin trying to perform a series of quests

referred to in an ancient text, Trials of Kilnre Yushao.

Enclaves: Quill cabals are packed to the brim with books,

maps, scrolls, and lore in all its forms. Shelves line even

the hallways in a quill cabal enclave. The central library is

usually riddled with traps that kill or imprison intruders

while leaving fragile books unharmed.

Every  quill  cabal  enclave  has  a  shrine  to  Aulasha  (see

Religion, below), and she gures prominently in much of

the artwork and architectural ornamentation. Quill cabal

enclaves also maintain the usual array of magical laborato-

ries as well as workshops for papermaking, binderies, and

the like. If the cabal has an active outreach directorate, the

enclave creates magic portals to remote libraries where its

librarians work.

Adventure Hook: Explorers have recently discovered

the ruins of an ancient culture, half buried by a massive

sandstorm in a far-off desert. A quill cabal wants the PCs

to race to the ruins and acquire any valuable texts before

treasure-seekers scatter the contents of the ruins across a

hundred bazaars.

Root Cabals

The rarest of illumian cabals, root cabals establish enclaves

in the most isolated, forbidding wilderness the world has

to  offer.  Root  cabals  are  fervent  defenders  of  the  forests,

mountains,  and  swamps  they  call  home,  protecting  the

area around their enclaves from predation by monsters and

settlement by civilized races. In the solitude that isolation

affords, they study the local ora and fauna, trying to tap

into the life energy of the natural world.

Notable  root  cabals  include  Autumnleaf,  Thorntwist,

Frostrime, Tidechant, and Oakmaw.

Typical  Directorates:  Root  cabals  contain  a  gleaner

directorate  responsible  for  gathering  food  from  the  sur-

rounding land, a predator directorate that patrols the area

for intruders, a nurselog directorate that instructs the young,

a seeder directorate that uses magic to protect and sustain

the land, and a taproot directorate that performs magical

research into life energy.

Plots: Root cabals expend a great deal of effort keeping

their  turf  safe  from  marauding  beasts  and  encroaching

civilization.  A  typical  root  cabal  might  try  to  frighten

away human pioneers, sow dissent among a clan of nearby

giants, or acquire the magic balm that arrests an epidemic

of tree-blight.

Enemies and Allies: Root cabals work with intelligent

creatures that can be trusted to live in concert with the

land,  such  as  centaurs,  goliaths  (described  in  Races  of

Stone),  and  lizardfolk.  Others  ally  themselves  with  fey

inclined  to  help  guard  their  lands,  such  as  dryads  and

nymphs. The most strident root cabals trust only plants

and animals, relying on druid-enhanced ora and fauna

as guardians.

Root cabals stay out of illumian politics, so their only

enemies  are  those  who  threaten  the  ecosystem  that  sur-

rounds  a  cabals  enclave.  Root  cabals  often  have  to  drive

intruders away, whether those intruders are well-meaning

human settlers, marauding orc armies, or aggressive giant

clans. Root cabals that use their lands for magical experi-

mentation sometimes draw the ire of self-styled defenders

of the natural world, such as treants, nonillumian druids,

and organized groups of lycanthropes.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in root cabals.

An illumian druid/ranger whose hard work on behalf of

the cabal has earned her a year of detached dutyhope-

fully long enough to sate her wanderlust.

An illumian cleric of Obad-Hai who is the lone survivor

of his cabal, which was destroyed by a ight of marauding

green dragons.

An illumian druid/bard, sent by a root cabal to learn all

she can about lands far and wide, who magically cor-

responds with her masters during her adventures.

Enclaves:  Root  cabals  use  the  natural  terrain  at  their

disposal to build their enclaves. Sometimes their enclaves

are camouaged by terrain, such as a dungeonlike enclave

under  a  mossy  hillock.  More  often  their  enclaves  appear

as  weird  structures  that  stand  out  from  the  surrounding

land while obviously being a part of it; root cabals want the

architecture  of  their  enclaves  to  imply  that  These  lands

are under our protection. In a forest, a root enclave might

seem overly curious about the lore contained within the

Library of the Sublime, so vengeance cabals wonder whether

they have ulterior motives in hunting down the githyanki

who looted it.

Typical Characters: The following characters are typical

of those who grow up in vengeance cabals.

An illumian paladin who seeks a silver dragon steed so

he can joust with red dragon-riding githyanki.

An illumian ghter/wizard who retreats to the Material

Plane, eager to put ceaseless war against the githyanki

behind her.

An illumian bard/rogue fascinated with recovering books

taken from the Library of the Sublime and later scattered

across the multiverse.

Enclaves:  Even  more  than  other  cabals,  the  enclaves

of  vengeance  cabals  are  armed  camps.  Most  are  walled

fortresses in isolated wastelands of the Material Plane or

the Plane of Shadow, although a few vengeance cabals create

oating fortress-ships that drift on the haze of the Astral

Plane.  Almost  all  enclaves  of  vengeance  cabals  have  one

or more planar portals within them, leading to the Astral

Plane or to the shadow city of Elirhondas.

Adventure  Hook:  Using  extensive  illusion  and

enchantment magic, a spy for the githyanki has inltrated

a vengeance cabal and is tipping off the githyanki about

illumian raids. Because the members of the cabals Black

Table dont know who can be trusted within the cabal, they

invite the PCs to stay at their enclave for a time and uncover

the traitor.

be a spherical tangle of branches supported by dozens of

massive oak trunkswith animated branches set to grasp

intruders. A mountain enclave might be a graceful series of

towers attached to a sheer cliff at the end of a box canyon. A

subterranean enclave might be a warren entirely within a

hollowed-out stalagmite in a massive underground cavern.

Adventure Hook: A spontaneous series of crop failures

sparks an investigation by the PCs, and the trail soon leads

to a nearby root cabal. The cabal is tapping the life energy

of  the  regions  soil  for  its  magical  experiments.  The  PCs

must convince the cabal to stop, force it to do so, or nd it

an alternative source of magical energy.

Vengeance Cabals

Vengeance cabals are the most recent cabal type to emerge

in illumian society, and the least common cabal type. They

are somewhat more common outside the Material Plane,

because an extraplanar location provides them readier access

to their greatest enemies.

Vengeance cabals exist to hunt down and slay as many

githyanki as they can nd, in revenge for the destruction

of the illumians Library of the Sublime (see below).

Notable vengeance cabals include Astralhunter, Githslayer,

Tornpage, Bitterblood, and Oathkeeper.

Typical  Directorates:  Like  other  cabals,  vengeance

cabals are divided into directorates, but they have a military

organization within each directorate. The directorates them-

selves have names inspired by the military, such as infantry,

headquarters,  and  intelligence.  A  captain  is  in  charge  of

each directorate, supported by a network of lieutenants as

well as rank-and-le illumians.

Plots:  Almost  everything  a  vengeance  cabal  does  is

devoted to revenge against the githyanki for sacking the

Library of the Sublime. Vengeance cabals combine direct

action (illumian strike teams that roam the Astral Plane

looking  for  githyanki  to  slay)  with  subtler  interventions

(giving githyanki city maps to mind ayers and aiding githz-

erai assault teams). Vengeance cabals take reasonable care to

avoid reprisals from the githyanki, but if a vengeance cabal

can lure angry githyanki into attacking its enclave, thats

just another chance to kill more of the hated enemy.

Enemies  and  Allies:  The  githyanki  are  obviously  at

the  top  of  a  vengeance  cabals  enemies  list.  Most  cabals

disregard other enemies unless they directly threaten the

well-being  of  the  cabal.  Githyanki  from  communities  or

military units that actually took part in the sacking of the

Library of the Sublime are particularly hated. Illumians can

usually identify such githyanki if enough of their history

is known, and they are shown no mercy.

Vengeance cabals have common cause with the githyan-

kis two traditional foes: githzerai and mind ayers. Because

githzerai and illumians share a lawful outlook and a love of

learning, cooperation between them is commonplace. Alli-

ances with mind ayers happen less often, simply because

mind ayers make such disturbing allies. Mind ayers also

LAWS AND JUSTICE

Illumian law sits entirely in the hands of each cabals arbiter,

who enforces the cabals laws and metes out punishment.

No one, visitor or cabal member, is beyond the reach of the

arbiter for crimes that occur within the walls of the enclave

or during a cabal mission. The arbiter handles every aspect

of the illumian justice system, from the investigation of a

crime to the trial and the sentencing.

The arbiter heads the justice directorate and investigates

the  most  serious  crimes  personally,  assigning  subordi-

nates to more routine cases (assuming the cabal is large

enough to warrant assistants). Any member of the justice

directorate can make arrests, but only the arbiter can judge

someones  guilt  or  innocence.  The  arbiter  is  more  than

just  a  judge,  however.  The  arbiter  questions  witnesses,

cross-examines the accused, and can stop a trial to gather

evidence. When the arbiter is satised that he has all the

relevant evidence, he renders a judgment (and sentence,

if necessary) on the spot.

The  illumian  code  of  laws  varies  from  cabal  to  cabal.

Because illumians love the written word so intensely, arbiters

keep a law library full of Black Table decrees, legal precedents,

and prior opinions they can turn to for guidance. In this

respect, the illumian justice system is more like a modern

court system than a medieval one. However, the notion of an

impartial judge and a separate jury is foreign to illumians. An

arbiter has total control of the legal process, which is efcient

if the arbiter is fair and competent and potentially dangerous

if the arbiter has an ulterior motive.

Those who feel an arbiters decision is unfair can draft a

written appeal to the Black Table. The members of the Black

Table must read the appeal, but need not act on it. By custom,

they can only overturn the arbiters decision by removing the

arbiter from his or her post, but they can change a punishment

by decree. The right of appeal isnt limited to the accused;

victims or other wronged parties may appeal to the Black

Table if they feel a punishment was too lenient.

The illumian formula for sentencing includes restitution

for the victim, a deterrent punishment, and some degree

of  social  stigma  for  the  criminal.  Arbiters  employ  great

creativity in developing punishments that thematically t

the crime. For example, an illumian convicted of poisoning a

rivals wine might be assigned the following punishment:

Pay an annual stipend to the victim (restitution).

At every meal, serve the victim (social stigma).

Taste  each  course  before  offering  it  to  the  victim,  but

receive  no  other  food  and  thus  linger  on  the  brink  of

starvation (deterrent).

Roleplaying Application: Your character has undoubt-

edly  seen  illumian  justice  in  action,  but  were  you  the

accused, the victim, or merely a bystander?

TRAVELERS AND RENEGADES

Not every illumian belongs to a cabal, and even those who

are  part  of  illumian  society  dont  necessarily  spend  all

their time answering to a director or the Black Table. An

illumian might take up the life of an adventurer for any

number of reasons.

An Agent Outside: Cabals are eager to learn about life

beyond the walls of their enclaves, so theyll send representa-

tivesyoung illumians trained in self-defenseto explore

the surrounding world. As long as the illumian provides

periodic reports on her activities and whereabouts (in person

or via magical correspondence), cabals are content to allow

this detached duty to last for years.

Seeker of Lore: Cabals covet rare tomes, maps of recently

discovered ruins, and specic items of historical or magical

signicance. They send trained members out into the world

on missions of acquisition. As long as a particular illumian

continues to make valuable nds from time to time, a cabal

keeps him delving into ruins.

Renegade: Cabals dont banish members as punishment,

because an illumian knows too many of his cabals secrets

to be released into the outside world with a grudge against

the cabal that raised him. Sometimes, though, an illumian

ees his cabals enclave rather than face the judgment (fair

or unfair) of an arbiter. The arbiter (and by extension the

cabal) is pragmatic enough to weigh the value of recapturing

a renegade illumian against the cost in manpower that such

a pursuit would require.

Orphan: Not every cabal lasts forever. The survivors of a

cabal destroyed by rivals must make their way in the world as

well as they can until they join another cabal or found a new

one. Some illumians, once they have tasted independence,

spurn cabal life for good, living among humans or other

races and no longer associating with their own race.

Roleplaying  Application:  As  an  illumian,  you  come

from an insular, secretive society. Your reason for standing

apartat least to a degreefrom that society says a lot about

your characters motivations.

ILLUMIAN RELIGION

In general, dwarves worship Moradin and elves worship

Corellon Larethianor, at least, gods associated with their

race. But illumians dont have the long history or power-

ful gods of those races. Perhaps a quarter of all illumians

worship  the  same  gods  that  their  human  ancestors  did

before the Ritual of Words Made Flesh transformed them

into illumians. Other illumians worship no deity, instead

seeking guidance from more abstract philosophies. The rest

worship illumians who have ascended to godhood within

the last few centuries.

HUMAN GODS

Gods of magic and learning nd a welcome audience among

illumians, with Boccob being particularly revered. More

illumians worship Boccob than all the other human deities

combined. Boccobs clerics promise the faithful that if they

live lives devoted to learning, they will become librarians in

Boccobs great library, surrounded forever by the limitless

wisdom of the ages.

Vecna holds sway among evil illumianstheir love of

conspiracies perfectly matches Vecnas portfolio of secrets.

Gravewhisper cabals in particular build shrines to Vecna in

which they hatch plots of perdy and undead dominion.

ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY

Perhaps  a  quarter  of  illumian  cabals  have  no  shrines  to

specic gods within their walls, and the cabals clerics frown

on the worship of deities. Instead, they teach devotion to

an  abstract  philosophy  or  principle,  embodied  in  one  or

more cleric domains.

For  example,  an  illumian  root  cabal  might  have

clerics who teach reverence for natural law and the

unimpeachable order of the seasons of life. Those

clerics  have  access  to  the  Animal,  Plant,  and  Law

domains, and they counsel cabal members to obey the

dictates  of  the  cabal  and  protect  the  lands  in  their

care. The clerics of a gauntlet cabal

that  secretly  controls  a  powerful

merchant  guild  have  access

to  the  Travel  and  Trickery

domainsthe  better  to

extend  the  cabals  secret

grasp across the miles.

THE

ILLUMIAN

PANTHEON

Increasingly, cabals at least

pay lip service to the illu-

mian  pantheon,  though

the  deities  represented

were  themselves  mortals

within the memories of the

longer-lived races. Tarmuid

especially  is  beloved  by

almost  all  illumians  regardless  of

alignment,  for  he  created  the  race

and watches over it to this day.

Ascension cabals always venerate one or more members

of the illumian pantheon, because theyre seeking to join

its ranks. Half of the other cabals have shrines to Tarmuid

and at least a few of the additional illumian deities.

TARMUID, THE FIRST

Demigod (Lawful Neutral)

Tarmuid,  the  wizard/monk  who  created  the  Ritual  of

Words Made Flesh, was the rst illumian and the creator

of the illumian race. After he showed other humans how

they too could transform themselves into illumians, he

spent the rest of his lifespan researching how the Illumian

language that infused his body might possess the secret of

eternal life. For decades he searched in vain for a means

of ascension. Then, upon his deathbed, his nal utterance

contained words of transguring power, and he became a

demigod and protector of the illumian people.

To this day, Tarmuid dwells in the Castle of the Innite

Sigil  at  the  heart  of  the  illumian  shadow-metropolis  of

Elirhondas, where he dispatches his clerics and followers

to eliminate threats to the illumian raceoften by subtle

means, but occasionally with an overwhelming crusade.

When Tarmuid appears to the faithful, it is as a pale

but  handsome  illumian  in  glowing

white robes, with every letter in the

Illumian alphabet whirling about his

head.

Portfolio: Illumians, magic, languages.

Domains: Magic, Protection, Law.

Cleric  Training:  Tarmuids  clerics  are  well

versed in illumian history, and they learn as many lan-

guages as they can. Acolytes of Tarmuids faith learn

scripture  by  translating  the  holy

text into other tongues, then trans-

lating it back into Illumian.

Tarmuids worshipers also

pride  themselves  on  their

ability to memorize long li-

turgical passages and recite

them word for word.

Tarmuids  clerics  turn

undead rather than rebuke

them  and  cast  cure  spells

spontaneously.

Quests: Tarmuid sends

his  representatives  into

the world to discover new

kinds of magic or to protect

a  signicant  number  of

illumians from a threat. He

also  has  high-level  cleric

inquisitors  who  secretly

work  among  the  cabals,  ensuring

that  they  adhere to the principles

Tarmuid set down when he created

the  rst  cabals.  Whenever  a  plot  arises  that  involves  the

Ritual of Words Made Flesh, Tarmuids agents are there to

make sure that the ritual stays safely split up, but in illumian

hands.

Prayers: Tarmuids prayers, spoken exclusively in Illu-

mian, tend to be long-winded and feature owery language.

Rather than ask for aid from Tarmuid directly, prayers of

intercession ask Tarmuid to help the worshiper unlock the

secrets of his or her own inner power.

Shrines: Tarmuids shrines are prominent in the enclave

of every cabal where illumians worship him, and even cabals

that  dont  actively  worship  Tarmuid  keep  a  small  shrine

as a historical monument and for illumian visitors. Such

shrines usually feature a bust of Tarmuid (with

a permanent image for the halo of sigils) atop a

black altar. The walls are covered with scriptures

and sayings in elaborately painted or gilded letters,

exhorting illumians to tap into their inner power.

Rites:  Whenever  an  illumian  is  born,  the  entire

cabal  gathers  to  recite  the  The  Ritual  Renewed,  a

reenactment  of  Tarmuids  rst  performance  of  the

Ritual of Words Made Flesh. The ritual itself is not

performedits complicated and potentially

deadly,  and  the  instructions  are  split  into

hundreds of parts and spread among the

cabals. Illumians also call on clerics

of  Tarmuid  to  bless  new  enclave

buildings and the formation of

new cabals.

Herald and Allies: Tar-

muid  uses  a  20th-level

illumian  monk  as  his

herald;  Vuliak  is  the  cur-

rent heralds name. He sends

hound archons, zelekhuts, and

maruts in response to the planar ally

spells.

Favored  Weapon:  Quarter-

staff.

AULASHA,

THE LIBRARIAN

Holy symbol

of Alausha

Demigod (Lawful Good)

Aulasha, a loremaster and a childhood

friend  of  Tarmuid,  was  the  second

illumian to make a nal utterance that resulted in her

ascension, becoming a deity only twenty years after

Tarmuid. She appears as a kindly crone with white

hair and a brown robe; tiny books surround her head

where sigils would otherwise oat.

Aulasha took the vast store of illumian knowledge

and  lore  as  her  domain,  and  together  with  her  fol-

lowers she built the Library of the Sublime. About a

hundred years ago a githyanki army sacked and looted

the library, driving Aulasha away with only a fragment

of her priesthood.

Today,  Aulashas  whereabouts  are  known  only  to  her

most  trusted  clerics.  She  relentlessly  hunts  across  the

cosmos for the contents of her library, and her followers

have vowed to rebuild it better than before. Aulasha was

so  full  of  sorrow  after  the  librarys  destruction  that  she

added grief and sorrow to her portfolio, and she is vener-

ated whenever an illumian mourns a lost friend or suffers

a similar tragedy.

The destruction of the Library of the Sublime was the

illumian peoples greatest tragedy, and not every illumian

has forgiven Aulasha for letting the githyanki overrun

it. An active cult of illumians tries to destroy Aulashas

faith and even end her divinity because they feel

she betrayed the illumian people. The cult, known

as  Respect  Only  the  Brave,  claims  adherents  in

dozens  of  cabals,  and  clerics  of  Aulasha  are  always

on  their  guard  against  plots  or  outright  attacks  from

cultists.

Portfolio: Learning, books, grief.

Domains: Good, Knowledge, Law.

Cleric Training: If the spoken word is central

to  Tarmuids  faith,  then  the  written  word  is

Aulashas province. Her would-be clerics spend

hours poring over religious tomes, memo-

rizing  their  contents.  Many  spend

time  as  scribes,  creating  newand

impressively illuminatedcopies

of important books.

Quests:  Aulashas  fol-

lowers  are  obsessed  with

rebuilding  the  Library  of

the Sublime; as such, they

can  be  found  scouring  every

plane  of  existence  for  tomes

stolen by the githyanki. Thousands of

Aulashas worshipers toil daily in the

shadow-metropolis of Elirhondas to

build a new library. Because Aulasha

has taken on grief and mourning as part of

her portfolio, her high-level followers now

deal with illumians who have died, either

performing funeral rites or raising the dead

body if the soul has unnished business.

Prayers:  Aulasha  has  set  down  several  books  of

written prayer, known as the Volumes of Sacred Liturgies

(or the Crimson Books, because of their traditionally red

lettering). Aulashas worshipers read the liturgies silently

or recite them with the book openeven if they have

the words memorized.

Shrines: A small altar to Aulasha usually adorns a cabal

enclaves library; her simple rites demand little in the way of

space or ceremony. Even librarians who arent particularly

devout genuect in the direction of the shrine when theyre

tackling particularly difcult researchor when they cant

seem to nd a mislaid book.

Rites: Recently clerics of Aulasha have been perform-

ing  funeral  rites,  which  traditionally  are  part  of  a  cleric

of  Glautrus  repertoire.  Unlike  Glautrus  rites,  Aulashas

funerals emphasize audience participation, with each friend

and family member offering a blessing, a favorite memory,

or a comforting word to the survivors.

Herald and Allies: Aulashas herald, a solar, died defend-

ing  the  Library  of  the  Sublime  from  the  githyanki,  and

Aulasha hasnt appointed a replacement. Her favorite planar

allies are hound archons, trumpet archons, and planetars.

Favored Weapon: Warhammer.

GLAUTRU, THE SEER

Demigod (Neutral)

Glautru was an illumian cleric of Boccob before he ascended

to  godhood  himself  several  centuries  after  Tarmuid  and

Aulasha. He still visits Boccob from time, but he takes his

responsibilities as the god of illumian fate very seriously

and regards Boccob as a wise colleague, no longer worthy

of worship.

Illumian clerics say that Glautrus vision is so keen that

he can read an illumians entire destinyfrom birth to

death and beyondsimply by looking at his or her aura

for  a  moment.  When  Glautru  meets  someone  new,

he takes a moment to study the individuals aura,

makes a cryptic comment, then opens his book

to write down his  ndings. No one other than

Glautru has ever tried to read the book and

lived.

Glautru  usually  appears  as  a  purple-

robed  man  with  a  white  goatee,

carrying a massive, ironbound book

in one hand. Where his legs would

be is a column of  re that levitates

him a few inches above the ground

and propels him forward.

Glautru  ponders  the  in nities

of  fate  and  destiny  from  a  labyrinthine

fortress  of   ame  on  the  Elemental  Plane  of

Fire. Occasionally a visitor accidentally stumbles

into the  ery maze (such as when a plane shift

or similar spell goes awry), and is confronted

with Glautru, annoyed that his contemplations

have been interrupted.

Portfolio: Prophecy, fate, life and death.

Domains: Death, Destiny (see page 163),

Fire, Healing.

Cleric Training: Glautrus clerics spend

Holy symbol

of Glautru

a great deal of time in meditation, staring

into  a   ickering   re  for  hours  on  end

and  trying  to  discern  prophecy  in  the

dancing of the  ames. They also receive training in the

healing arts, working in an enclaves sick ward or an outside

hospital.

Glautrus clerics rebuke undead rather than turn them

and cast in ict spells spontaneously.

Quests: When issues of fate and prophecy are concerned,

Glautrus worshipers place themselves in the thick of mat-

ters. Like Aulasha, Glautru sends his high-level followers to

attend to matters of life and death, including resurrections

and efforts to recover illumian souls that have been stolen

or imprisoned in some way.

Prayers: Prayers to Glautru are elliptical and hard for

others  to  understand  because  they  refer  to  dreams  and

omens that only the worshiper has experienced. Theyre

usually voiced in the future tense: Glautru will bless this

place, as he will blow the leaves from the trees . . . the leaves

of  ery red and burnt orange. Yet Glautru will never leave

me . . . begins a common prayer to bless a new house of

worship, for example.

Shrines: Glautrus priests keep a golden brazier burning

at the center of the Seers shrines. Additional adornment is

rare. By tradition, only rough-hewn furniture and no art of

any kind is welcome in Glautrus houses of worship. Items

of a divinatory nature such as dice, fonts of water, and

crystals feature prominently, however.

Rites: Glautrus rites are divinatory, seeking guid-

ance from Glautrus connection to the  ery cosmos.

Because Glautru knows the fate of each illumian,

his clerics traditionally perform illumian funer-

als, somber affairs in which a cleric recites the

dead illumians lineage, brie y notes a lesson

to be learned from the fate of the deceased,

and then cremates the body.

Herald and Allies: Glautrus herald

is a black dragon wyrm. He sends

Medium,  Large,  and  Huge   re

elementals as planar allies.

Favored Weapon: Longsword.

SOORINEK,

THE DOUBTER

Demigod (Lawful Evil)

In  life,  Soorinek  was  a  powerful  illumian

sorcerer  who  disdained  religion  as  mere

trappings  designed  to  accrue  power  from

the gullible and weak-minded. Imagine her

surprise when her  nal utterance resulted in

her ascension to godhood. Since then she has

appeared as a black-skinned illumian with

a  jharisthe  equivalent  of  the  question

mark in the Illumian language oating

around her head.

Soorinek assumed her new role with a mixture of

enthusiasm and reluctance. She quickly saw the power

that an organized church could bring, so she took the

secret-stealing and espionage that was her hallmark in

life as her portfolio in godhood. But she is unwilling to

behave  like  an  omniscient,  omnipotent  deity,  and  she

uses the power of her church to tear down anyone or any

group that exceeds its rightful place and authority. Many

a powerful king, proud general, and pious priest has fallen

victim to the subtle plotting of Soorineks followers. Even

her fellow deities arent immune to Soorineks drive to make

sure no one exceeds their station.

Soorinek directs her church from a citadel shaped like

a gray orb that hangs in the nothingness of the Negative

Energy Plane. But she has been spending more time lately

conferring with the archdevils of the Nine Hells than in

her lonely spherical palace.

Cleric Training: Soorinek pits her would-

be clerics against one another from the  rst

day  in  seminary  training,  announcing  that

only  the  top  quarter  of  a  given  group

will  attain  the  priesthood.  A  series

of tests and examinations gives the

acolytes ample opportunity to betray

and  sabotage  each  another,

so  only  those  well  versed

in  political  maneuvering

become Soorineks clerics.

Quests: The sharpest nail

gets  the  file,  states  one  of

Soorineks proverbs She orders her

minions  to  neutralize  or  tear  down

a  power  structure  that  has  over-

stepped its bounds. Sometimes she

targets powerful and ambitious cabals,

sending her worshipers to bring them

to heel. She also directs her clerics

and followers to work as agents of

illumian revenge, exhorting them

to attack any group that has wronged

the illumians.

Holy symbol

of Soorinek

Prayers: Soorineks prayers begin with the phrase

Soorinek says . . . and take the form of proverbs. There

are no group prayers in Soorineks faith, and her prayers

of  intercession  describe  a  Soorinek  worshiper

alone against the world.

Shrines: Soorineks shrines feature gaudy

paintings, with frescoes on the walls depicting

illumians about to perform great deeds such as

monster slaying, marching off to war, or casting

powerful spells. But they never actually depict

the great deeds themselves; and, by tradition,

each  illumian  face  is  painted  so  that

looks toward the same place: an utterly

blank wall at the far end of the shrine.

Furniture tends to be simple and

individualized, with chairs rath-

er than pews and pillows rather

than kneeling rails.

it

Rites: Soorineks clerics

offer  a  number  of  rites

for  illumians  seeking  a

blessing  of  good  fortuneor  ill  for-

tune for a hated rival. Rites are usually

brief,  one-on-one  affairs  between  priest

and  worshiper.  Clerics  of  Soorinek  hold

con dentiality in high regard, so an illumian

usually feels comfortable performing a rite that wishes

bad luck on an enemy, con dent that the cleric wont

tell anyone about performing the rite.

SYERET,

THE LIGHTBRINGER

Demigod (Chaotic Good)

Depicted in painting and sculp-

ture as a golden-armored illumian

bearing  an  oversized  torch,  the

bard Syeret was the  fth illumian

to ascend to godhood and the  rst

to do so as the head of an ascension

cabal. He has since taken the ascension

cabals under his wing, promising to use

my torch to light the way to divinity for

all.  Syeret  likewise  is  popular  among

gibber  cabals,  because  he  values  creativ-

ity  and  his  prayers  incorporate  invented

words.

Syeret became a deity less than three

centuries

ago, and he hasnt yet established a per-

manent base. He has started palace construction several

times amid the white dust of Arboreas third layer, only

to start over again when a new architectural inspiration

strikes.

Portfolio: Inspiration, light, creativity.

Domains: Chaos, Sun, Travel.

Cleric  Training:  Syerets  clerics,  in

addition  to  learning  the  songs  and  scrip-

tures  essential  to  religious  life,  must  create

an  artistic  masterpiece  of  some  kind  before

being  admitted  to  the  priesthood.  Because

many of Syerets followers have bardic train-

ing,  hymns  and  musical  works  are  the  most

common  acolyte  masterworks,  but

would-be clerics may opt for dramas,

oratories, or  ne arts such as paint-

ing or sculpture.

Quests: Syeret delights

in  the  new,  so  his  follow-

ers shepherd recently created

objects  and  ideas  into

being. They help found

cabals, create new mas-

terworks of magic lore, and gather the

raw materials for new magic items and

artifacts for the illumian people.

Holy symbol

of Syeret

Prayers: Syeret demands that his worship-

ers improvise their prayers, which tend to

be rhythmic and rhymed. Its common for

prayers  to  Syeret  to  include  nonsensical

words to justify a rhyme scheme and repeated syllables

to keep a prayers rhythm intact.

Shrines: Continual  ames and other forms of magical light

illuminate every corner of Syerets shrines. Art abounds, as

does music (animated instruments play themselves even

when  no  one  is  around).  In  keeping  with  Syerets  com-

mand  to  continually  create,  worshipers  keep  his  shrines

in a perpetual state of redecoration. A curious shrine-goer

could chip away at the paint on the walls and  nd dozens

of different layers, each a different color.

Rites:  Clerics  of  Syeret  want  to  bless  every  new  cre-

ation  they  can,  and  they  have  an  extensive  collection

of  ceremonies  for  everything  from  a  new  enclave

building to a newly strung longbow. Syerets worship-

ers  hold  seasonal  holiday

rites on the equinoxes and

solsticesfestive  occasions

when illumians give thanks for

the safety of the enclave and the

continued progress of their race.

Herald  and  Allies:  Syeret  uses

Janni genies, leonal guardinals, and

planetar  angels  are  his  usual

planar allies.

WATHAKU, THE SILENT

Demigod (Neutral Evil)

Wathaku  is  the  youngest  of  the

illumian  gods,  having  attained

godhood less than a century ago.

If  Wathaku  has  his  way,  he  will

also be the last illumian to ascend to

godhood.  Wathaku  seeks  nothing

less than the death of all illumians,

the unmaking of his fellow illumian

deities, and the end of the Illumian language.

The  motivation  behind  Wathakus  desires  is  a

mystery,  because  few  sources  document  Wathakus

life prior to becoming a deity. So far his church is little

more than a secret cult, outlawed in almost every illumian

cabal. Even so, a few madmen and the truly desperate  nd

a  reason  to  live  by  Wathakus  nihilistic  philosophy,  so

his religion has slowly grown over the years. Wathakus

clericswho  typically  pretend  to  worship  another  god

or  no  god  in  particulartry  to  steal  the  fragments  of

the Ritual of Words Made Flesh that each cabal guards.

If  Wathaku  can  gain  possession  of  a  complete  copy  of

the ritual, perhaps he can reverse it and literally unspeak

the  Illumian  language,  destroying  all  illumians  in  the

process.

When  he  deigns  to  appear  to  his  followers,  Wathaku

appears as a burly illumian with blank skin where his mouth

would  be  and  a  single  silver  line  where  his  sigils  would

otherwise  oat. Wathaku has no known fortress or base,

instead moving incognito from cabal to cabal by taking the

form of mortal illumians.

Portfolio: Entropy, wrath, endings.

Domains: Destruction, Evil, Strength.

Cleric Training: Wathakus high priests never admit it

until training is nearly complete, but all would-be clerics

must pass a secret test, even after theyve memorized the

necessary prayers and scriptural passages. Each cleric must

secretly  kill  an  illumian  and  transcribe  his  or  her   nal

utterance, which is added to a secret trove of manuscripts

kept by Wathakus church.

Quests:  Wathaku  exists  to  erase  everything  illu-

mian.  His  agents  work  in  secret  to  bring  about  the

downfall  of  illumian  cabals  and  the  unraveling  of

illumian plots. Whatever the rest of the illumian

gods plan, Wathakus followers seek to thwart.

Prayers: In keeping with his name,

Wathaku  has  no  spoken  prayers.

Instead,  his  worshipers  meditate  on  a

particular  prayer,  repeating  it  in  their

minds  as  they  meditate.  A  slightly

bowed  head  and  brie y  closed

eyelids are the only outward

indication that a follower of

Wathaku is praying.

Shrines: Wathaku favors no formal

shrines because his is a secret religion.

When a group of worshipers gather, they

place crude  gurines on a shelf and

perform their silent prayers, then

disperse immediately.

Rites: Wathakus only rite is a rite

of initiation, full of so many loath-

some activities that afterward the

present worshipers have all the

blackmail material theyll ever

need  to  hold  over  the  new

initiate. This threat helps

to ensure the continued

loyaltyand silence

of every initiate, even if ones faith later wavers.

Herald and Allies: Wathaku has no heraldhe either

ignores a situation or takes care of it himself. He responds to

planar ally spells with succubus demons, retriever demons,

and marilith demons.

Favored Weapon: Morningstar.

HISTORY AND FOLKLORE

As a bookish people, illumians are acutely aware of their his-

tories. The traditions and laws of their cabals are drilled into

them from an early age. But because illumian cabals dont

mix much, illumians have less shared folklore and common

history than most races. Still, some events are so crucial to

illumian history that every child knows about them. Others

have spread from cabal to cabal over the centuries, grow-

ing and twisting with each telling until they have become

legends not found in any illumian history book.

RITUAL OF WORDS MADE FLESH

The  most  important  event  in  illumian  history  is  the

founding of the race itselfan event that happened mere

centuries ago.

Tarmuid was a monk, scholar, and powerful wizard who

lived  in  a  far-off  island  monastery.  A  natural  linguist,  he

began to notice certain patterns in ancient magic texts he was

translating. Over time, Tarmuid discerned a common pattern

to how various ancient languages expressed magical con-

cepts. After years of research and experimentation, Tarmuid

developed his own language, based on the underpinnings of

magical expression. Tarmuid called this language, invented

from the bones of long-dead languages, Illumian.

As Tarmuid became more adept at speaking Illumian, he

noticed  that  each  word  he  spoke  carried  residual  magical

power that infused both the speaker and anyone who heard

the words. Tarmuid sought a way to use the language itself

to create a vessel that would be receptive to the power within

his words. After countless failed experiments, Tarmuid devel-

oped the Ritual of Words Made Flesh, a spoken rite that would

transform any human who heard it into a creature infused

with the power of the Illumian language. Through the ritual,

what was once human would become illumianthe Illumian

language in tangible, humanoid form.

Tarmuid performed the ritual on himself, becoming the

worlds rst illumian. He quickly shared his discovery with

the humans living in the monastery, and they too became

illumians. Only after creating several hundred illumians

did  Tarmuid  begin  to  worry  that  the  Ritual  of  Words

Made Flesh could be twisted to other purposes, creating

less useful transformations or even utterances that would

destroy those who heard them.

Tarmuid convinced his fellow illumians of the rituals

danger, but they in turn persuaded him not to destroy the

instructions  for  performing  the  Ritual  of  Words  Made

Flesh. Instead, the illumians split up into small groups

and scattered across the globe, each group taking along

part of the rituals instructions. Those groups soon evolved

into the cabals that are today the foundation of illumian

society, and each cabal still guards part of the Ritual of

Words  Made  Flesh.  Because  illumians  now  reproduce

infant illumians normally, the ritual isnt needed to sustain

the illumian race.

Adventure Hook: Through theft, murder, and subter-

fuge, cultists of Wathaku have assembled many of the parts

of the Ritual of Words Made Flesh. Ultimately, they intend

to reverse the ritual and uncreate illumians everywhere.

The PCs must chase Wathakus agents from cabal to cabal,

trying  to  safeguard  the  parts  of  the  ritual  that  Wathaku

doesnt yet have.

THE JOURNEY OF

NEVERLOST KAODEI

Popular  folklore  among  the  illumians  contends  that

Tarmuid performed the Ritual of Words Made Flesh one

last time in secret before splitting up the instructions and

scattering the illumians across the world. The only human

to hear the nal performance of the ritual was a bard named

Kaodei, who happened to be visiting the monastery when

Tarmuid created the rst illumians.

Tarmuid made a risky, improvised alteration to the ritual

as he performed it for Kaodei. As a result, Kaodei became

an illumian who never ages, suspended forever as a young

adult. Kaodei isnt immortal, says the legend, but he doesnt

age  naturally  and  needs  only  fear  death  by  accident  or

violence.

To this day, Kaodei walks the earth at Tarmuids behest,

traveling from cabal to cabal and safeguarding the future

of the illumian race. Kaodei is a powerful spellcaster and a

master of disguise, say the legends, so he doesnt reveal his

true nature. The handsome illumian is credited for dozens

of heroic efforts on behalf of his people, often arriving just

as beleaguered illumians are losing hope.

Adventure Hook: A mysterious illumian lies delirious

and  ill,  referring  to  himself  as  Kaodei  and  describing

how doppelgangers have inltrated an illumian cabal. The

PCs must decide whether its better to try to nd a cure

for Kaodeis illness or to rush to the cabal and do Kaodeis

work for him. They might try to discern whether the sick

illumian is really Kaodei or simply an illumian inspired by

his legend.

THE ASCENSION OF TARMUID

After  dividing  up  the  Ritual  of  Words  Made  Flesh  and

spreading  illumian  cabals  across  the  world,  Tarmuid

retreated to his laboratories to further rene the Illumian

language  and  study  its  interaction  with  various  magical

phenomena. He kept his closest friends with him as a per-

sonal cabal, and he observed that as the divine spellcasters

among them prayed for spells, their words fused with magic

in a unique manner.

Thus  began  Tarmuids  second  great  research  project:

uncovering the connection between the Illumian language

and the divine power of the gods themselves. For decades

Tarmuid  tried  to  use  the  Illumian  language  to  tap  into

divine power, to no avail. Even as his body began to fail

him, he persisted in his attempts to channel divine power

with his words.

On his deathbed, Tarmuid chanted in Illumian unceas-

ingly,  voicing  words  and  concepts  both  thrilling  and

perplexing  to  the  illumians  caring  for  him.  One  night

Tarmuids heart failed, and the founder of the illumian race

began his nal utterance, the Illumian words within him

returning to the cosmos.

In that nal utterance, Tarmuids last, instinctive expres-

sion  succeeded  where  his  conscious  efforts  had  failed.

Tarmuid found himself returned to life and over owing

with divine energya demigod whose every word was an

explosion of divine power. After spending time in seclu-

sion to understand his new role, Tarmuid began revealing

himself to illumian cabals, pledging to shepherd the race

into a bright future.

Adventure  Hook: An  ascension  cabals  most  elderly

member is nearly ready to make her  nal utterance, perhaps

to join Tarmuid in the ranks of the divine. She asks the PCs

to recover a powerful magic sword so that she can carry it

into divinity with her. If the PCs succeed, they may win a

reward from the illumians newest deity, but they have to

get the sword to her before she makes her  nal utterance.

THE SACK OF THE LIBRARY

A race founded by scholars and obsessed with language,

the illumians are inveterate book collectors. The greatest

aggregation of their lore was the Library of the Sublime,

a fortress on the Astral Plane where even the most fragile

tome would be immune from the further decay of time.

Protected by the demigod Aulasha the Librarian, an illumian

city of scholars grew up around the library, collaborating

on  research  into  magic,  the  multiverse,  and  even  more

esoteric mysteries. It was said that the discussion in a single

salon within the library would stagger the imagination of

earthly sages, so great was the accumulated knowledge and

wisdom there.

But knowledge itself is a treasure, and not everyone was

content to let the illumians keep such treasure to them-

selves.  Centuries  ago,  a  powerful  githyanki  army  led  by

Vlaakith the lich-queen herself laid siege to the Library of

the Sublime, eager to acquire for themselves the knowledge

within its tomes. The illumians of the library mounted a

defense  that  was  both  strategically  brilliant  and  appall-

ingly desperate, but in the end the githyanki were just too

numerous and powerful. They seized and looted the library,

slaughtering any illumian who didnt  ee. Then, the treasure

trove of wisdom within the Library of the Sublime proved

too much for the covetous githyanki, who fell into  ghting

among themselves over the books. Various githyanki fac-

tions absconded with parts of the librarys collection, and

many other books were lost in the battles that followed the

invasion of the library.

Though the attack happened years ago, the tale of the

Library of the Sublime still brings tears to illumian eyes.

To this day, illumians hate the githyanki with a passion that

overcomes  the  usual  illumian  pragmatism  toward  other

races. Some illumians bear a grudge against the library-god

Aulasha, because she was unable to prevent the sacking of

the library. Entire cabals exist for the express purpose of

The Library of the Sublime has been devastated, but some of its secrets may still await discovery

79

rebuilding  the  illumian  collection  of  lore  until  it  again

matches the shelves of the Library of the Sublime.

Adventure  Hook:  A  faction  among  the  githyanki  is

rumored to have reassembled a working copy of the Ritual

of Words Made Flesh from the contents of the Library of the

Sublime. The githyanki are seeking additional knowledge of

Illumian, which will enable them to adapt the ritual to turn

githyanki into illumians. The PCs must either prevent the

githyanki from acquiring the lore they want, interrupt the

ritual directly, or sabotage it by planting false but convincing

illumian lore into githyanki hands.

RAISING ELIRHONDAS

Shortly after the sack of the Library of the Sublime, Tarmuid

appeared to the illumian cabals in turn. He commanded

each of them to send one capable representative to a loca-

tion deep on the Plane of Shadow marked by a concentric

ring  of  volcanoes  that  erupted  shadowstuff  in  a  regular,

clockwise pattern. Within weeks, thousands of illumians

were camped within the volcanic valley, expecting Tarmuid

to announce a counterstrike against the githyanki for the

destruction of the Library of the Sublime.

Instead, Tarmuid appeared before the multitude and said

simply, Build a city here. The assembled illumians argued

briey, and several skeptics returned to the Material Plane.

Those  who  remained  started  using  magic  to  construct

buildings, establishing what is now the illumian shadow-

metropolis of Elirhondas.

Despite the powerful magic employed by the illumians,

the construction process was neither quick nor easy. The

shifting nature of the Plane of Shadow caused perplexing

structural problems, and it took a great deal of illumian inge-

nuity to stabilize the region enough to keep the city intact.

Worse,  the  builders  had  to  contend  with  near-constant

assaults from various ends, undead hordes, and a strike

force of githyanki. Despite these obstacles, the illumians

succeeded, and today Elirhondas is the largest settlement

of Illumians to be found anywhere.

Many of the illumians who built the city remained there,

forming the cabal of Elirhondas that rules the city to this day.

Others returned to their cabals and are now counted among

the illumians greatest heroes. To most illumians, the raising

of Elirhondas is an inspiring counterpoint to the tragic sack-

ing of the Library of the Sublime. The builders of Elirhondas

were  able  to  put  aside  their  natural  tendency  for  plotting

and subterfuge and work together toward a common good:

a refuge for every illumian regardless of cabal afliation.

Adventure  Hook:  For  years,  an  illumian  cabal  has

revered  its  representative  to  Tarmuids  beckoning,  but

a  rival  cabal  offers  evidence  that  the  illumian  hero  was

actually  a  skeptic  who  left  the  Plane  of  Shadow  before

the city was built, then later claimed to have taken part

in the construction of Elirhondas. The PCs must travel to

Elirhondas and ask high-ranking illumians there whether

their fellow cabal member is a hero or a scoundrel. While

there, the PCs start to suspect that the answers they receive

have more to do with illumian politics than the truth, so

they must investigate in secret.

THE SEARCH FOR TRUEROOT

Trueroot  is  a  substance  referred  to  in  the  lorebooks  of

root cabals, but no illumian can claim to possess it or have

mastered its creation. Hundreds of illumian herbalists and

druids have spent their lives in search of trueroot, inspired

by an account of its accidental discovery in the Annals of

Oakmaw Nellek.

The  Annals,  a  heavily  annotated  laboratory  notebook

of an illumian druid named Nellek, describe a series of

experiments in grafting various magically enhanced roots

onto treants, then planting seeds from the treants, cross-

breeding the resulting saplings, then grafting the saplings

with each other and repeating the process. Nellek recorded

information about hundreds of failures, the creation of a

dozen healthy but normal tree species, and one spectacular

resulta  powerful  sapling  with  roots  that  pulled  pure

magical  energy  forth  from  an  unknown  source.  Nellek

explains how magical energy from the trueroot sapling,

when channeled into nearby plants, caused them to grow at

ten times their usual rate. When channeled into members

of the cabal, the trueroot energy gave them almost limitless

spellcasting abilities and perfect health.

After conducting preliminary experiments, Nellek took

branches from the sapling to graft elsewhere and continue

the experiment. Though he took only a few small branches,

the original trueroot sapling sickened and died. Nelleks

efforts to grow another trueroot sapling failed, and he died

a bitter, frustrated botanist.

Since Nelleks initial experiments, dozens of illumians

have tried to conduct their research in his footsteps and

grow  trueroot  for  themselves.  None  of  them  has  gained

an understanding of where Nellek went wrong, and thus

far no one has nurtured another trueroot. But the lure of

limitless  power  still  draws  the  nest  illumian  minds  to

wander the forest, seeking rare cuttings for their grafting

experiments.

Adventure Hook: A blight has fallen across the pastoral

woodlands of the plane of Arboreaa root cabal has created

a  sapling  similar  to  a  trueroot  that  draws  the  essence  of

Arborea itself onto the Material Plane. The PCs must nd

the root cabal and convince its members to stop siphoning

the energy of Arborea.

THE HUNTING SECRET

Illumian folklore typically has a teaching function, and few

tales are as instructive as the hunting secret. At the heart of

the story (the details of which differ with each storyteller) is

a secret shared between two illumiansa secret that nds

its way across time and geography to ruin the fortunes of

both illumians. In other words, the secret itself hunts down

the people who broke its condence.

Illumian storytellers take great pride in coming up with

elaborate variations on the story of the hunting secret, but

the structure is always the same. In the tale, one illumian

tells another illumian something in condence, and then

the two illumians are separated with no hope of reuniting.

One of the two illumians breaks the condence and shares

the  secret,  condent  that  the  breach  is  harmlessafter

all, the secret-sharer is so far away that revealing the secret

doesnt do any harm.

The best illumian bards earn their keep with the middle

part of the story. They describe the tortuous path that the

secret takes as it is passed from person to personand the

more clever steps in the path the secret takes, the better.

At several points in the narrative, it seems as if the secret

will nally come to rest, never to be related again, but then

its somehow passed on to a new character in the story.

The story of the hunting secret ends when the secret is

revealed in the presence of the second illumian, causing all

sorts of misfortune and woe. This misfortune is reected

back to the illumian who broke the condence in the rst

place, leading to a tragic, but satisfying end to the tale.

Adventure Hook: A careless PC lets slip a secret, which

has a way of turning up at the most inopportuneand

eventually  dangerousmoments.  Is  the  PC  living  the

tale of the hunting secret, or is there an overt campaign

among the illumians to spread this particular secret?

LANGUAGE

The illumians were literally constructed out of their own

language, infused with its essence. Understandably, its a

complex language. The Illumian alphabet has more than

a  thousand  symbols,  each  corresponding  to  an  entire

syllable, not just a single sound.

Illumian  syllables  often  have  a  degree  of  meaning

themselves.  For  example,  the  vaul  sigil  appears  in

the  Illumian  words  for  death  (kreevaul),  resurrection

(vaulagrea), and reverence for ones ancestors (nevaulak).

But an illumian word is more than the sum of its syllables,

and not every word having to do with the soul contains

the vaul syllable.

As a side effect, the written form of the Illumian syllable-

based alphabet is extraordinarily compact. Even a long word

can be expressed in four or ve letters, so illumian books

have  fewer  pagesor  contain  more  informationthan

books written in other languages.

ILLUMIAN PHRASEBOOK

If  youre  playing  an  illumian  character,  you  can  use  the

following Illumian phrases at the gaming table. Depending

on your play style, you can use the actual Illumian words

or their English translations.

Pauthak kireyu! Literally, Press the advantage! The most

common  illumian  battle  cry,  given  as  illumian  soldiers

charge into enemy ranks.

Tarmuid boradu. This saying, which translates as Tarmuid is

when an illumian is acting in an embarrassing or ineffective

way (which Tarmuid would likely disapprove of).

Yeshae  tal!  Meaning  By  the  ritual!  this  is  a  common

unusually large, this phrase doesnt translate literally. But the

Illumian language uses ten symbols in its alphabet to serve as

ILLUMIAN NAMES

Once the illumians dispersed into cabals, a simple naming

convention emerged. Every illumian takes the name of his

or her cabal as a family name, and is given a personal name

by his or her parents. To emphasize the importance of the

cabal in illumian life, illumians usually identify themselves

to  outsiders  by  giving  their  cabal  name  rst,  then  their

personal name. Within the walls of their enclave and among

other cabal members, they use only personal names. After

all, in an illumian cabal, the family name is superuous

because everyone shares it.

Personal  names  dont  have  any  intrinsic  meaning  in

Illumiantheyre simply two- or three-syllable identiers.

Illumian  cabal  names  are  usually  compounds  of  simple

words in the Illumian language.

When an illumian name is spoken in a language other than

Illumian, the personal name is untranslatable and is simply

pronounced. The cabal name is translated into an equivalent

compound word such as Bloodwing or Oakmaw.

Random Name Generation: Illumian personal names

almost  always  have  two  or  three  syllables.  Because  the

Illumian alphabet has more than a thousand components,

countless acceptable combinations exist. Table 35, on the

previous page, should sufce to provide a quickly generated

random  name.  Roll  on  the  table  two  or  three  times  and

combine  the  syllables,  adjusting  the  sounds  if  necessary

so the name sounds pleasing to the ear.

You can generate a cabal name on the y by consulting

Table  36  and  rolling  once  in  each  column,  creating  a

compound word.

EXAMPLE CABAL:

BLOODWING

Bloodwing is a typical chain cabal. Comtaining more than

two  hundred  members,  it  concentrates  on  keeping  the

province of Rossalia peaceful and free of strife.

The  Bloodwing  enclave  is  a  granite  edice  created  by

magic  within  the  heart  of  the  Rossalian  forest,  far  from

the prying eyes of civilization. The Bloodwings maintain

a magic portal to an underground lair in Sumberton, the

nearest city of reasonable size, and a planar portal that con-

nects with Elirhondas once a week.

Several decades ago, the Bloodwing cabal enjoyed a close

alliance with the local church of St. Cuthbert, combining

their forces with church knights to repulse monstrous

attacks on the province. But a rival cabal, the Graypeaks,

subverted the Bloodwings relationship with the church,

which no longer trusts illumians of any afliation. About

a decade ago, the Graypeaks and Bloodwings went to war,

and the Bloodwings emerged victorious. The war fostered

instability throughout the region, however, so ever since

the Bloodwings have focused on reestablishing contact

(and a measure of control) over the various powers in the

region.

The  Bloodwing  cabal  has  three  main  directorates  that

keep tabs on the rest of Rossalia: Eyes on Sumberton, Eyes

on Hellmaw, and Eyes on Tiamat.

Eyes on Sumberton: Members of the noble classes of

Rossalia live in a semifeudal state. Most maintain private

armies  of  knights  to  patrol  their  lands,  and  they  arent

beyond occasionally going to war with one another over

a real or imagined slight. The noble courts in the city of

Sumberton  are  snakepits  of  alliances  and  betrayals,  and

the Eyes on Sumberton directorate uses a network of spies,

paid informants, and like-minded allies to keep the inght-

ing from spreading across the region. This usually means

convincing a particularly hotheaded noble to refrain from

attacking a neighbor or breaking up an alliance of nobles

before it can dominate the politics of the region.

Adventure Hook: The Eyes on Sumberton directorate has

used diplomacy, enchantment magic, and blackmail to keep

Lord Macazril from planning a war on Lord Tarvanand

the gnome town under Tarvans protectionto no avail.

The directorate hires the PCs to inltrate Macazrils keep

and sabotage his ability to make war on the eve of battle.

Eyes on Hellmaw: For the last two years, the Hellmaw

goblin tribe has wandered the borders of Rossalia, sporadi-

cally raiding the settled communities. Small groups of elite

illumians,  in  concert  with  a  friendly  tribe  of  centaurs,

have  thus  far  discouraged  more  serious  incursions.  But

the Hellmaw tribe is large enough that the Bloodwings

would be hard-pressed to stop a Hellmaw invasion, so its

considering plots that either eliminate the tribes barghest

leaders (and probably disperse the tribe) or entice it to raid

a different province.

Adventure  Hook:  The  Hellmaw  tribe  has  captured  two

illumian scouts from the Bloodwing cabal and taken them

to be interrogated by the barghests. If the Hellmaw goblins

learn that the Bloodwings have been thwarting them for

years, they might march right to the Bloodwing enclave.

The  PCs  must  rescue  the  captive  illumian  scouts  before

they reveal the truth about the Bloodwing cabals efforts.

Eyes on Tiamat: The Bloodwing cabals Black Table cre-

ated the Eyes on Tiamat directorate only three months ago.

Agents of the Eyes on Sumberton directorate uncovered and

destroyed a coven of Tiamat-worshiping nobles. Mysterious

correspondence  found  in  the  secret  temple  revealed  the

existence,  but  not  the  location,  of  cells  of  a  region-wide

Tiamat  cult.  The  directorate  is  using  every  investigative

technique it can to nd the cells and eliminate them before

they can hatch an evil dragon-inspired plot that threatens

all of Rossalia.

Adventure Hook: The directorate uncovers the name of a

Tiamat cultist among miners in the Rossalian mountains.

The  PCs  must  inltrate  the  mine,  gain  the  trust  of  the

cultist, and pretend to join the cult, balancing their fake

identities with their duty to the cabal until theyve learned

enough to shut the cult down.

IMPORTANT CABAL MEMBERS

The  following  NPCs  are  important  members  of  the

Bloodwing cabal. They have statistics appropriate for their

station, so you can use them even if you arent using the

Bloodwing cabal.

Bloodwing Ruthek, Black Table

Ruthek is the oldest of the Bloodwings to sit at the Black

Table and has a great deal of inuence over the Black Tables

agenda. Over the decades, he has seen the Bloodwing cabal

extend its reach over much of the province of Rossalia,

then survive a bitter war with a rival cabal, the Graypeaks.

His  is  a  voice  of  caution  at  the  Black  Table,  urging  the

cabal  to  consolidate  its  gains  rather  than  foment  new,

aggressive plots.

Although  his  loyalty  is  beyond  question,  Ruthek  isnt

above using the resources of the cabal for personal ends.

His eldest son lives a life of indolence and luxury as a well-

cared-for  Final  Seed.  Ruthek  has  an  older  daughter  who

disappeared during the cabals battles with the Graypeaks,

and he periodically insists that one of the Eyes on director-

ates engage in a mission to search for her. Divination magic

has revealed that Rutheks daughter is alive, but the cabal

cant pinpoint her location.

Bloodwing Gulthau, Black Table

As the youngest illumian sitting among the cabals lead-

ers, Gulthau speaks for the Black Table. Unlike the other

Bloodwings at the Black Table, Gulthau regularly observes

rank-and-le members of the cabal going about their duties,

and he makes it a point to consult with each of the cabals

directors daily.

Gulthau is a committed worshiper of Tarmuid, and hes

quick  to  extol  the  virtues  of  a  proper,  cabal-comes-rst

attitude. Hes also particularly keen on defensive measures

for  the  cabals  enclave,  because  he  saw  combat  rsthand

during the war against the Graypeaks and hes not eager to

do so again. Gulthau doesnt get along with Mulao the arbiter

because hes annoyed with Mulaos persistent investigations

that rarely result in charges and trials.

of damage on any successful attack against at-footed or

anked  targets,  or  against  a  target  that  has  been  denied

its  Dexterity  bonus  for  any  reason.  This  damage  applies

to  point-blank  ranged  attacks  as  well.  Creatures  with

concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and

creatures immune to critical hits are all immune to sneak

attacks. Gulthau may choose to deliver nonlethal damage

with  his  sneak  attack,  but  only  when  using  a  weapon

designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion (Ex): If Gulthau is exposed to any effect that

normally allows him to attempt a Reex saving throw for

half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

interacts strangely with symbol-based spells. See page 53

roll when making an unarmed strike or a sneak attack.

orbit Gulthaus head provide illumination equal to that of

a candle. He can make these sigils disappear as a standard

action, but loses the sigils benets and cant use any special

theyre  doused.  Restoring  the  sigils  to  visibility  is  a  free

action.

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Gulthau  retains  his  Dexterity

bonus to AC even when at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or other-

wise immobile).

had endure one of arbiter Mulaos investigations as soon

as she took ofce; he suspected that Kerrea eliminated her

superior to attain his position.

Despite a rocky start, Kerrea has injected new vitality

into her directorate, and she spends as much time visiting

her  agents  and  contacts  in  the  city  of  Sumberton  as  she

does  in  the  Bloodwing  enclave.  The  Bloodwings  within

her directorate are ercely loyal to her, but the other direc-

tors regard her as somewhat recklessand envy a director

whose directorate consumes more than a fair share of the

cabals resources.

Bloodwing Mulao, Arbiter

Mulao has been the Bloodwing Cabals arbiter for more

than two decades, and he has twice spurned offers to join

the Black Table. Hes almost as old as Ruthek, but he uses

a punishing regimen of calisthenics to keep himself in

shape, often joining adolescent exercise classes or defense

directorate weapons training.

Mulao has a deep reverence for illumian law, but he enjoys

the investigative part of his job more than the exercise of

judicial power. Mulao spends much of his time snooping

around  the  enclave,  asking  questions  of  cabal  members

but rarely revealing exactly what or whom hes investigat-

ing. When it comes time to mete out punishment, Mulao

simply looks up the relevant legal precedents and assigns a

historically justiable punishment, without regard to the

specics of the case.

A rumored spy within the Bloodwing cabal is Mulaos

current obsession, and no Bloodwing is above suspicion.

Mulao is contemplating setting up a sting operation where

sensitive (and false) information is revealed to the cabal at

large. When that information turns up beyond the enclaves

wall, Mulao will have gained an important clue.

ELIRHONDAS,

SHADOW METROPOLIS

Only a small number of cabals contain more than a few hun-

dred members, so the only dense accumulation of illumians

in  one  place  is  the  metropolis  of  Elirhondas.  Created  by

representatives from hundreds of cabals, Elirhondas is a city

nestled deep within the Plane of Shadow. Few travel there

except at the invitation of an illumian who knows the way.

Its possible to reach Elirhondas by traveling to the Plane

of Shadow and walking to the city. Many cabals have planar

portals within their enclaves that connect to Elirhondas

directly. Even cabals without access to powerful magic have

access to an Elirhondas portal that briey opens at regular

intervals (once a month or four times a year, for example).

Because  Elirhondas  is  made  of  shadowstuff,  it  can  be

a frightening place to visit. Its a black-and-white world,

where  everything  gently  twists  and  warps  before  a

visitors eyes. Even illumians who call Elirhondas home

are occasionally startled by a particularly menacing bit of

shadowa door that momentarily appears to be a gaping

maw, or a tower that looms so large in the sunless sky that

it looks ready to topple over.

In  theory,  Tarmuid  rules  Elirhondas,  but  he  is  rarely

seen there, preferring to remain within his fortress abode.

In practice, Elirhondas is ruled like an overgrown cabal,

with  a  twelve-member  Black  Table  and  directorates  that

handle city functions. Unlike most cabals, the Elirhondas

cabal stays out of political matters, focusing entirely on the

defense of the city and the well-being of its visitors.

Among  the  highlights  of  the  city  are  the  following

locations.

Spinward Mountains: Elirhondas sits in the middle of

a circle of shadow volcanoes. Each volcano spews a massive

amount of shadow-stuff into the dark sky for about 2 min-

utes, then the next volcano in the ring (going clockwise)

erupts for 2 minutes, and so on; the erupting shadows circle

the city every 30 minutes. The residents of Elirhondas use

the  eruptions  of  the  Spinward  Mountains  as  a  massive

public clock, and they direct visitors using spinward and

antispinward rather than right and left.

Castle of the In  nite Sigil: Tarmuids personal abode,

a massive gothic structure, sits at the center of the city. An

ever-changing, glowing sigil hangs suspended above the

castles ramparts. The sequence of Illumian letters above

the  castle  is  usually  randomor  at  least  the  pattern  is

too  complex  for  even  illumian  sages  to  discernbut  in

times of crisis the glowing sigil spells out a message from

Tarmuid to his faithful. No living illumian sets foot within

the Castle of the In nite Sigil unless expressly invited by

Tarmuid. Such invitations are rarely offered.

Tombs of the Brave: Row after row of sarcophagi, each

tomb bearing the carved likeness of an illumian hero, cover

several  city  blocks  in  this  neighborhood.  The  plaza  is  a

monument to the illumians who fell defending the Library

of the Sublime from githyanki raiders. Its also a common

meeting  place  for  illumians,  especially  those  about  to

embark on a mission that advances the cause of their cabal

or illumians in general.

Library  of  the  New:  Aulashas  clerics  have  selected

this site to one day hold a replacement for the destroyed

Library of the Sublime. Illumian builders determinedly

raise  new  walls  and  buttresses,  but  construction  goes

slowly  because  the  builders  lack  manpower,  especially

powerful spellcasters. While the library isnt done, books

have  already  started  arriving,  both  from  the  efforts  of

Aulashas clerics and those of the quill cabals. Watchful

sentinels stand guard over several temporary warehouses

full of tomes on the site.

Boulevard of Doors: Hundreds of cabals have planar

portals  that  link  to  Elirhondas.  The  other  side  of  those

portals  is  almost  always  a  door  on  the  walls  that  mark

the boundaries of this wide boulevard. The Boulevard of

Doors bustles at all times, because travelers constantly pass

through on the way to and from the Material Plane cabals.

This is the busiest street in Elirhondas; the air is vibrant

with the cries of barking street vendors, the low voices of

conspirators, and the low rumble of the erupting shadow

volcanoes in the distance.

Elirhondas  Enclave:  The  civil  administration  of

Elirhondas  is  set  up  like  a  cabalalbeit  one  with  more

than a thousand members. The cabals Black Table meets

in the walled compound in this quarter of the city, and the

directorates (defense, justice, maintenance, and so on) keep

their of ces here as well.

builders returned to their cabals when the city was complete,

while  others  took  up  residence  in  the  city  permanently.

Several dozen, worried about the citys long-term survival,

opted for a third choice. They lie in suspended animation

within these chambers, ready to be awakened by the citys

Black Table if the githyanki or another enemy threatens

Elirhondas to the point where its living residents cannot

defend it. That day has not yet come, but inhabitants of the

city sleep easier knowing that dozens of powerful wizards

and other high-level heroes can be awakened at a moments

notice to defend the illumians of Elirhondas.

Elirhondas (Large City): Conventional; AL LN; popula-

tion 22,000 adults (varies widely); 40,000 gp limit (100,000

gp for spellbooks and magic items that take book, scroll,

or other written form); Isolated (95% illumian, 2% human,

1% half-elf, 1% githzerai, 1% other).

Authority Figures: Black Table councilor Chaosei, illumian

wizard  17;  High  priest  Eltau,  illumian  cleric  16;  shadow

sentinel General Sheokru, paladin 8/shadow sentinel 10.

CREATING ILLUMIAN

CHARACTERS

Illumian  characters  obey  all  the  rules  for  characters

described in the Players Handbook. As an illumian, youll

want to consider carefully the power sigils you choose at

1st and 2nd level. Once youve studied the available options,

youll  notice  that  only  a  few  of  the  illumian  words  (the

combinations of two power sigils) are particularly effective

for any one class. Thats one reason why many mid- to high-

level illumian characters are multiclass characters; theyre

exercising the maximum benet from the power sigils that

oat around their heads. Look carefully at the combinations

offered among the power sigils, since they make certain

multiclass choices particularly attractive.

SPECIAL ILLUMIAN OPTIONS

As an illumian character, you qualify for some illumian-

specic feats and prestige classes unavailable to PCs of other

races, all described in Chapters 5 and 6 of this book.

Feats:  Bright  Sigil,  Enhanced  Power  Sigils,  Human

Heritage,  Improved  Power  Sigil  (Aesh),  Improved  Power

Sigil (Hoon), Improved Power Sigil (Krau), Improved Power

Sigil (Naen), Improved Power Sigil (Uur), Improved Power

Sigil (Vaul), Subtle Sigil.

Prestige Classes: Loredelver, shadow sentinel.

ILLUMIANS AS CHARACTERS

Because  illumians  have  the  versatility  of  their  human

forebears, they take easily to any class.

Barbarian: Barbarians are very rare in illumian society,

but members of gibber cabals nd that theyre able to chan-

nel their rage to potent effect. The aesh power sigil is a good

choice for illumian barbarians.

Bard: Illumian society holds wordswhether written,

spoken, or sungin high regard; after all, illumians are

literally made of words. Some illumian bards are musicians,

but the storytellers and orators are more common among

illumians than wandering minstrels. Several power sigils

make good options for bards, particularly the naen, uur, and

vaul power sigils.

Cleric: Illumian clerics divide their devotions between

the races pantheon, abstract philosophy, and human gods

(especially Boccob and Vecna). The hoon and vaul power

sigils vie equally for popularity among illumian clerics.

Druid: Root cabals include many druids, who as a class

are rare in other types of cabals. As with clerics, both the

hoon and vaul power sigils are common among druids.

Fighter:  Illumians  make  a  lot  of  enemies  with  their

plotting and spying, so cabals insist that members have at

least a bit of combat training. Illumian ghters typically

prefer the aesh or uur power sigils, depending on whether

they favor brute force or agility.

Monk: The illumian race was founded in a monastery,

so its no surprise that monks still number highly among

the race today. The uur power sigil enhances an illumian

monks acrobatic and stealth abilities, but the hoon and aesh

power sigils are useful as well.

Paladin:  While  illumians  are  famous  for  their  subtle

plots, they also need questing crusaders from time to time.

Illumian paladins are rare, but they feel their sigils mark

them  as  Tarmuids  own  champions.  Illumian  paladins

choose  power  sigils  based  on  their  specic  talentsthe

aesh, hoon, krau, and vaul power sigils are all common.

Ranger: The combination of skills and combat prowess

that the ranger class offers makes it attractive to illumians.

The classs particular approach to solving problems directs

the illumian rangers choice of power sigils, with aesh, hoon,

krau, and uur all providing benets.

Rogue: With the amount of spying and covert activities

that a cabal performs, the abilities and skills of a rogue are

in  high  demand.  Illumian  rogues  typically  choose  from

the  hoon,  naen,  uur,  and  vaul  power  sigils,  though  more

physically oriented rogues select the aesh power sigil.

Sorcerer: While its a relatively rare occurrence, some

illumians  have  a  gift  for  instinctive  magic  and  become

sorcerers.  Sorcerers  with  the  vaul  sigil  are  particularly

persuasive,  though  a  few  prefer  to  augment  their  talents

with the hoon, naen, or uur power sigil.

Wizard: Along with rogue and bard, wizard is the most

common  class  chosen  by  illumians,  for  what  other  class

provides its own book full of arcane secrets? The naen power

sigil  ts  perfectly  into  the  wizards  role  as  the  master  of

knowledge.

Multiclass  Characters:  The  illumian  race  combines

classes as well or better than any other race, and every com-

bination has its own best options for power sigils. Multiclass

spellcasters consistently pick up the krau power sigil.

hile  rarely  the   rst  race  to  appear  on  any

given  world,  humans  soon  established

their dominance in numerous lands across

the multiverse. A remarkable variety of hu-

man-descended races (such as half-elves and half-orcs) and

creatures associated with humanity has arisen, perhaps as a

natural result of humans sharing territory with magic and

other humanoids. While these races dont always have an

overt connection to humans, theyre usually found living

in human cultures.

USING THIS CHAPTER

The races described here are presented as an option for

PCs  as  alternate  character  races.  These  races  also  give

the Dungeon Master new options when building foes to

confront the characters. Sly doppelgangers, friendly mon-

grelfolk, violent skulks, and secretive underfolk inhabit

the world around the characters and sometimes become

heroes themselves, while remaining unknown to the gen-

eral populace.

MONSTER CLASSES

need that book to use these classes. Monster classes work

just like other classes, with the following exceptions.

When  using  monster  classes  to  create  a  character,

you can ignore level adjustment. This is replaced by

the characters monster class level. (The level adjust-

ment is, in effect, built into the monster classs level

progression.)

The only way to take a level of a monster class is to be

that monster. A doppelganger cannot multiclass as

a skulk, nor can a human  ghter multiclass to take

levels  as  a  doppelganger.  She  must  begin  taking

levels in the monster class at 1st level.

Monster classes do not grant a character skill points

or Hit Dice at every level, nor do they grant a feat

every three levels. When a level grants skill points,

a Hit Die, or a feat, the gain is noted on the class

table.

Each monster class has a CR (Challenge Rating)

column. This has no meaning for players or PCs

and is given only as an aid to DMs who want

to  adjust  monster  CRs  by  regressing  existing

creatures.

Some of the races described in this chapter use the monster

class rules detailed in Savage Species. You dont necessarily

A monster character using a monster class cannot

multiclass until she completes the full progression

91

This aasimar conceals her

true nature beneath bulky

clothing and a large-

brimmed hat

in  her  monster  class.  This  rule  keeps  characters  from

gaining the bene ts of a monsters type and then quickly

switching to a standard class. However, a DM may explic-

itly waive this rule (of cially declaring a variant ruling)

if he desires a slightly higher-powered campaign.

A monster class does not impose an experience penalty

for multiclassing, as other classes do.

AASIMAR

Graceful,  regal,  and  noble,  aasimars  are  the  distant  de-

scendants  of  a  coupling  between  a  human  and  a

good-aligned outsider. While nowhere near as pow-

erful as their celestial forebears, aasimars still retain

a touch of the divine in their blood and wear it with

pride. Devoted champions of good, aasimars spend

their days  ghting evil in whatever form it takes.

In a world of violence, injustice, and evil, aasimars are

on the front lines, lending their abilities where needed.

Some try to stave off evil by teaching and leading by

example in the  ght against ignorance, prejudice, and

greed. Others present an aloof and lofty demeanor,

an  intimidating  aura  that,  while  noble,  keeps

people from trying to get too close. Among good

people, aasimars are held in high opinion as a

standard by which all should live, while those

of an evil nature view aasimars as self-righteous

and dangerously moralistic.

Personality: Aasimars practically radiate good

will  and  a  positive  attitude.  Most  aasimars  are

kind, pleasant, and approachable. However, some

project a crusading zeal and sense of purpose that

can be daunting and unapproachablehearkening

to  the  vengeful,  judgmental  aspect  of  their  celestial

ancestor. Few aasimars crave the limelight, and they

shun  positions  of  authority,  except  in  instances

where they can lead by example.

Physical  Description:  From  a  distance,

aasimars appear as standard humans. Up close,

their  celestial  bloodline  shines  through  in

their  tall  stature  and  attractive  features.

Some bear a minor physical trait that high-

lights their celestial nature, such as silver

or  golden  hair,  metallic  eyes,  or  a  rich,

melodic voice. Humanoids  nd aasimars

aesthetically pleasing and watch them with

admiration.

Relations:  Aasimars  maintain  ex-

cellent  relations  with  beings  of  good

alignment.  They  are  found  primarily

among humans, but they also associate

with  elves,  dwarves,  and  good-aligned

humanoids.  They  are  extremely  stern

and disapproving toward evil beings of

all kind and do not willingly deal with

orcs, goblins, and other races noted for their evil alignment.

Aasimars are extremely suspicious of half-orcs, but they can

overlook blood or upbringing if an individual proves that

he leads a life of good and honor.

Aasimars treat one another with respect and friendship,

seeing other aasimars as cousins united in the cause of good.

However, if they encounter an aasimar who has fallen to

evil,  they  become  frightful  to  behold  in  their  anger  and

righteous indignation.

Alignment: Blood infused with the power of the celes-

tial  realms  virtually  guarantees  that  aasimars  are  good

in  alignment,  although  individuals  vary  wildly  in  their

interpretation  and  may  favor  lawful  or  chaotic  behavior.

In extremely rare instances, an aasimar turns from good,

becoming neutral or even evil. Fallen aasimars live as hunted

beings, reviled by their own kind for betraying the blood

the ows in their veins.

Aasimar Lands: Aasimars are relatively few in number

and do not hold any lands of their own. Most are loners,

wandering from place to place and providing aid and good

deeds  when  needed.  Others  integrate  themselves  more

thoroughly into human society, although their predilection

for action and good deeds means that they rarely take up a

sedentary vocation.

Religion: The indisputable fact of their celestial ancestry

leads aasimars to become deeply devoted beings who feel a

personal connection with a particular deity. Even those who

do not become paladins (their favored class) are profoundly

religious and forthright in their faith. While they are not

prone to proselytizing, by words and action aasimars show

the power and righteousness of their deity to those who

have not yet seen the light and truth that they experience

themselves.

Language: Aasimars speak Common and have an intui-

tive understanding of Celestial from birth. Aasimars learn a

variety of languages to assist them as they wander the world

in their quest for good.

Names: Aasimars are given names appropriate for the

area and society in which they were raised. The majority,

raised by human parents, bear human names. Some adopt

a more celestial-sounding name on reaching adulthood to

demonstrate their devotion to their deity and to the cause

of good.

Male Names: Exelar, Henzio, Mortibal, Overmar, Sen-

talial, Vitarri.

Female  Names:  Alleraia,  Eretri,  Irethia,  Marethial,

Savial, Terim.

Adventurers: Aasimars readily take to the adventuring

lifestyle. Many become paladins, acting as righteous tools

of their deity. Clerics are nearly as common, followed by

ghters.  Lawful  aasimars  nd  a  monks  discipline  very

appealing. Blessed with a naturally high Charisma, some

aasimars become sorcerers and bards. Aasimars dislike the

pragmatic deceitfulness of rogues, and barbarian aasimars

are almost unheard of.

AASIMAR RACIAL TRAITS

+2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Aasimars inherit a measure of

the insight and presence of their celestial forebears.

Outsider (native): Aasimars are outsiders who are native to

the Material Plane. Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders

need to eat and sleep.

Medium: As Medium creatures, aasimars have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

Aasimar base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Aasimars can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like  normal  sight,  and  aasimars  can  function  just  ne

with no light at all.

Daylight (Sp): An aasimar can use daylight once per day

as a 1st-level caster or a caster of her class level, whichever

is higher.

Resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5: Aasimars

gain a slight resistance to acid, cold, and electricity from

their celestial blood.

+2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks: Aasimars have

keen senses.

Automatic  Languages:  Common  and  Celestial.  Bonus

Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Haling,

and Sylvan. Aasimars enjoy learning languages that enable

them to communicate with good creatures.

Favored  Class:  Paladin.  The  paladin  class  levels  of  an

aasimar who becomes an ex-paladin class do not count

when determining whether she takes an experience point

penalty for multiclassing.

Level adjustment +1.

DOPPELGANGER

Scholars have debated for centuries about the origin of the

doppelgangers. Shadowy, mysterious, and enigmatic, these

shapeshifters learned long ago how to integrate themselves

into  human  society.  For  this  reason,  learned  men  and

women believe that doppelgangers were once human. How

doppelgangers gained their unique abilities is unknown,

even to themselves.

Doppelgangers do not have a society of their own. They ll

any desire for companionship and social interaction through

their association with other races. Although doppelgangers

act  independently,  following  their  own  motivations  and

goals, rumors persist of a secret cabal of elder doppelgang-

ers who desire nothing less than control of the world. Little

evidence corroborates these rumors, which may have been

perpetuated by the doppelgangers themselves to lend even

more mystery to their races reputation.

Personality: Discerning a doppelgangers true personal-

ity is akin to grasping quicksilver, although certain traits

seem to be common among members of the race. In their

natural form, doppelgangers are cold, mysterious, and aloof,

and almost never give any indication what they are actu-

ally feeling or thinking. Doppelgangers are natural liars,

and even allies wonder at the validity of a doppelgangers

acknowledgment of an emotional state.

While in disguise, doppelgangers behave according to

the personality of the mimicked humanoid. Because they

can only imitate a creatures physical form, not emotional or

psychological qualities, doppelgangers watch their quarry

from afar for as long as possible, getting every idiosyncrasy,

nuance, and personality trait down pat before assuming the

creatures form.

Doppelgangers feel the same basic desires as members

of  any  other  race,  but  more  than  anything,  they  wish  to

simply belong to a group, even if for just a short while.

Doppelgangers  use  their  abilities  as  a  test  of  their  own

cunning and superiority, and they believe that they succeed

only when they remain completely unnoticed by the race

they are trying to mimic. Clinically curious, doppelgang-

ers seek to understand a race by becoming part of that race

for a while, before moving on to in ltrate another, more

challenging group.

Physical  Description:  In  their  natural  form,  doppel-

gangers  are  gaunt,  gray-skinned,  genderless  humanoids

with  long,  gangly  limbs,  standing  around  5-1/2  feet  tall

and weighing about 150 pounds. Doppelganger bodies are

slender and frail-looking, although this appearance belies

their  hardy  constitution  and

natural agility. Their heads are large in proportion to the

rest of their bodies, and their faces are featureless except

for two large, octopoidlike eyes.

Doppelgangers  are  rarely  seen  in  their  true  form,  and

spend  most  of  their  time  mimicking  other  humanoids.

A  doppelganger  can  only  duplicate  the  appearance  of

a  humanoid  and  does  not  gain  any  special  abilities  of  a

mimicked race, such as an elfs low-light vision. Its ability

to duplicate another form is remarkable, and it can copy a

humanoid form to the minutest detail. Doppelgangers have

an incredible memory when it comes to retaining forms, and

a doppelganger can remember any shape it has mimicked,

even if it was years in the past.

Relations: Either despite or because of their shapeshift-

ing nature, doppelgangers do not have strong relations with

other races. They view all humanoid races with the same

level of neutrality, heavily in uenced by contempt. Dop-

pelgangers consider themselves superior to other humanoid

races, although they rarely espouse this viewpoint while

dealing with the races in question. They see humanoids as

mere pawns to be deceived and used in whatever manner

seems necessary at the time. On the other hand, most dop-

pelgangers do not have any preconceived notions about a

racethey all have their positive and negative qualities,

and none are any better or worse in comparison (except for

doppelgangers themselves, of course).

In  turn,  other  races  are  extremely  suspicious

of  a  creature  that  can  assume

their  own  forms  and  blend

in with impunity. In some

places, doppelgangers have

thoroughly in ltrated posi-

tions  of  authority,  using

their newfound power in

whatever way they see  t.

When  a  doppelganger

is discovered, pogroms

and  witch-hunts  inevi-

tably  follow,  as  the

accuses  anyone  and

everyone  of  being  a

chaos. Doppelgangers regu-

larly portray creatures of

different alignments, although their psyches are amazingly

toughened to resist any permanent shift from acting in such

a manner. They retain their own objectivity regardless of

the intensity of emotions that they exhibit on the surface.

On occasion, doppelgangers stray from the racial norm of

neutralityand their inclination toward duplicity and de-

ceit means that most of these individuals fall to evil.

Doppelganger  Lands:  Doppelgangers  have  no  lands

that  they  openly  declare  as  their  own.  However,  they

consider all the lands of the other races free for the taking.

Doppelgangers with a longing for power simply overthrow

an authority gure and assume his or her place instead of

trying to garner power from the ground up.

Religion:  Doppelgangers  lack  religious  conviction.

They understand why a race would worship a higher being,

although they do not feel much desire to propitiate a deity.

For this reason, doppelganger clerics are exceedingly rare,

despite the fact that doppelgangers occasionally masquerade

as members of the clergy for one church or another. Of all

the deities, Boccob, the Uncaring God of Magic, is most

likely to hold a doppelgangers attention, if only because

of his neutral attitude.

Language:  Doppelgangers  have  no  language  of  their

own and communicate among themselves by means of their

detect thoughts ability. Doppelgangers learn a multitude

of  languages  to  lend  credence  to  their  disguises.  Their

mastery of shapechanging carries over to speech, and they

can imitate particular accents with ease.

Names: To a doppelganger, a name is just another prop

to be used in its disguise. A doppelganger uses hundreds

of names throughout its lifetime, although none of those

names can truly be said to belong to that individual. Still,

each doppelganger does have a single, unique name, which

is almost never used. Doppelganger names are derived from

an ancient human language that died millennia ago, giving

further  weight  to  the  theory  that  they  descended  from

human origins. Since doppelgangers lack distinct gender,

there are no male or female variations in naming.

Doppelganger Names: Ansilikus, Melanuxor, Sanjaki-

lar, Tepilmurae, Verenkilar, Xestilophon.

Adventurers:  Naturally  stealthy  and  deceptive,  dop-

pelganger adventurers favor the rogue class. Doppelganger

bards number a close second. Those who spend a great deal

of time mimicking warriors become ghters or rangers. As

mentioned above, doppelganger clerics are notoriously rare,

and druids even more so, mainly because doppelgangers

are so focused on social intricacies that they barely think

about the natural world. Doppelganger paladins are one in

a million, and are viewed with considerable suspicion by

the rest of their race.

DOPPELGANGER RACIAL TRAITS

+2  Strength,  +2  Dexterity,  +2  Constitution,  +2  Intel-

ligence, +4 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Doppelgangers have

improved their minds and bodies through centuries of

mimicking humanoid forms.

Monstrous  Humanoid  (Shapechanger):  Doppelgang-

ers  are  monstrous  humanoids  with  the  shapechanger

subtype. They retain this type and subtype regardless of

any humanoid form they may assume.

Medium: As Medium creatures, doppelgangers have no

special bonuses or penalties due to size.

Doppelganger base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Doppelgangers can see in the dark out to 60

feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like normal sight, and doppelgangers can function just

ne with no light at all.

Racial Hit Dice: A doppelganger begins with four levels

of monstrous humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a

base attack bonus of +4, and base saving throw bonuses

of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4

Racial  Skills:  A  doppelgangers  monstrous  humanoid

levels give it skill points equal to 7  (2 + Int modier).

Its class skills are Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise

(Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis),

and Spot (Wis).

Racial  Feats:  A  doppelgangers  monstrous  humanoid

levels give it two feats.

+4 natural armor bonus: Doppelganger skin is resilient

and tough.

+4  racial  bonus  on  Bluff  and  Disguise  checks:  Dop-

pelgangers have a talent for deception. When using its

change shape ability, a doppelganger gets an additional

+10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it can read

an opponents mind, it gets a further +4 circumstance

bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.

Detect  Thoughts  (Su):  A  doppelganger  uses  detect

thoughts  as  the  spell  (caster  level  18th;  Will  DC  13

action.

Change Shape (Su): A doppelganger can assume the shape

of any Small or Medium humanoid. In humanoid form,

the doppelganger loses its natural attacks. A doppelganger

can  remain  in  its  humanoid  form  until  it  chooses  to

DOPPELGANGER MONSTER CLASS

Monstrous Humanoid (Shapechanger)

If you want to play a doppelganger at 1st level, you can use

the doppelganger monster class. To use the monster class,

generate your character with the racial traits given below

(rather than the doppelganger racial traits presented above),

and then take levels in the doppelganger class as you would

levels of other classes. For more information on monster

classes, see the Monster Classes section at the beginning

of this chapter.

As the ultimate inltrators and spies, doppelgangers

may seem like the perfect choice for players who enjoy

stealthy and deceptive characters. Extremely well rounded

and adaptable with excellent natural armor, doppelgang-

ers  excel  at  any  class,  although  their  lack  of  moral  or

ethical conviction hinders them from becoming clerics

or paladins.

A doppelganger begins play with relatively few abilities:

immunity to sleep and charm effects, a Constitution bonus,

and two good saving throws. As it advances in level, a dop-

pelganger learns how to detect thoughts, receives increases

in  its  ability  scores,  and  ultimately  acquires  the  change

shape  ability  that  denes  the  race.  This  ability  comes  to

them slowly, however, and young doppelgangers keep a low

prole until they reach their full strength.

Racial Traits at 1st Level

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Constitution.

Even young doppelgangers are exceptionally hardy.

Medium: As Medium creatures, doppelgangers have no

special bonuses or penalties due to size.

Speed: Doppelganger base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Doppelgangers can see in the dark out to 60

feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

All of the following are class features of the doppelganger

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: Doppelgangers are

procient with all simple weapons, but have no prociency

with any armor or shield.

Natural  Armor:  A  doppelganger  gains  a  +1  natural

armor bonus at 2nd level. This bonus improves by 1 every

two levels thereafter, up to +4 at 8th level.

Detect Thoughts (Su): At 2nd level, a doppelganger can

detect thoughts, as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 10

negates).

Change Shape (Su): At 3rd level, a doppelganger becomes

able to assume the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid.

A doppelganger can change its shape once per day at 3rd

level (but can revert to its normal form at any time), three

times per day at 5th level, and an unlimited number of times

per  day  at  8th  level.  In  humanoid  form,  a  doppelganger

loses its natural attacks. A doppelganger can remain in its

humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one. A

change in form cannot be dispelled, but a doppelganger

reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell

or ability reveals its natural form.

HALF-OGRE

The same wild frontiers that produce half-orcs from unions

between tribes of human and orc barbarians also produce

half-ogres.  Ogres  and  humans  ght  in  times  of  war  and

trade  in  times  of  peace.  In  peaceful  times,  ogres  value

humans intelligence and adaptability, while humans value

ogres strength and toughness. Half-ogres inherit a blend

of the physical characteristics of their parents. They may

be found in either parents community (where their status

varies according to local sentiment).

Personality: Half-ogres are generally low in intelligence

but quick to anger. Where a half-orc understands alterna-

tives to action, half-ogres do not. Successful half-ogres are

those with enough self-control to live in a civilized land.

Half-ogres love simple pleasures such as feasting, drink-

ing,  boasting,  wrestling,  drumming,  and  wild  dancing.

While some claim to be able to sing, few other races would

agree. A half-ogre is likely to assume that rened enjoyments

such as poetry, courtly dancing, and philosophy are just

tools for making fun of him.

Physical Description: Half-ogres are taller than humans

or  half-orcs,  but  not  as  tall  as  ogres.  Adults  are  typically

closer to the height and weight of an ogre than of a human.

Their  skin  color  ranges  from  dull  yellow  to  dull  brown.

his favored weapon is the greatclub. Half-ogre barbarians

and  ghters revere him as a war god even if they are not evil

themselves. Erythnul also numbers ogres and half-ogres

among his followers. Worshipers of Vaprak or Erythnul who

are tired of explaining themselves, or who dont want to give

other races yet another reason to distrust them, simply dont

make their religion public knowledge. Half-ogres who want

to solidify their connection to their human heritage follow

human deities, and they may be outspoken in

their shows of piety.

Language: Giant, which has no

alphabet of its own, uses Dwarven

script  on  the  rare  occasions

when  an  ogre  needs  to

write something.

Names:  A

half-ogre  typi-

cally  chooses  a

name  that  helps

him make a speci c

impression.  If  he

wants  to   t  in  among

humans,  he  chooses

a  human  name.  If  he

wants  to  intimidate

others,  he  chooses  a

guttural ogre name. A half-

ogre raised entirely by humans

has  a  human  given  name,

but  he  might  choose  another

name once he is away from his

hometown. Some half-ogres, of

course,  are  not  quite  bright

enough  to  choose  a  name

this carefully. Ogre names are

similar  enough  to  orc  names

that  players  may  choose  from

the orc lists (see Half-Orcs, page 18

of  the  Players  Handbook)  when  making

their characters.

Adventurers:  Half-ogres  living  among  humans  are

drawn almost invariably toward violent careers in which

they can put their strength to good use. Frequently shunned

from  polite  company,  half-ogres   nd  acceptance  and

friendship among adventurers, many of whom are fellow

wanderers and outsiders.

Half-Ogre Racial Traits

+6  Strength,  2  Dexterity,  +2  Constitution,  2  Intelli-

gence, 2 Charisma: Half-ogres are big, brawny creatures

without a great deal of intelligence or couth.

Giant: Half-ogres are creatures with the giant type.

Large: As Large creatures, half-ogres take a 1 penalty

to Armor Class and a 1 penalty on all attack rolls. They

also have a reach of 10 feet.

This half-ogre barbarian

gets a charge out of combat

Their  thick  hides  sport  patches  of

dark, warty bumps, and their heads

are topped by a mop of dark hair.

Relations: Because they are the

offspring  of  giants,  half-ogres  have

a  rough  time  getting  along  with  dwarves  and

gnomes.  Of  course,  ogres  are  rarely  on  good

terms  with  elves,  humans,  or  hal ings  either.

On the other hand, they understand

the prejudice that half-orcs experience and

relate well to them.

A  half-ogre  seeks  a  way  to  gain  acceptance  from

those who hate or fear his ogre cousins. Most exploit their

innate toughness so that others have no choice but to accept

them, whether out of admiration or fear. A few demonstrate

piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether

or not such displays are genuine).

Alignment: Half-ogres inherit a tendency toward chaos

from their ogre parents, but, like their human parents, they

favor neither good nor evil. Half-ogres raised among ogres

and willing to live out their lives with them, however, tend

toward evil.

Half-Ogre  Lands:  Half-ogres  have  no  lands  of  their

own, living among ogres or humans depending on their

circumstances and the tolerance of the locals.

Religion:  Like  ogres,  evil  half-ogres  worship  Vaprak

the Destroyer. The rapacious Vaprak is a chaotic evil deity

of combat, destruction, aggression, frenzy, and greed. His

domains include Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and War, and

MONGRELFOLK

Those people who have heard of mongrel-

folk know them as brutish, ugly creatures

who  bear  the  worst  features  of  all  their

parent races.

And that is exactly how the mongrel-

folk like it.

reinforcing the stereotype about their race in general. In

such a situation, ordinary-appearing mongrelfolk are often

able to move about more freely, because no one associates the

slightly tall dwarf or slightly stocky elf with the hideously

deformed creature hiding in the woods nearby.

Personality: Mongrelfolk grow up knowing that they

do not belong to one particular race, but are kin to all of

them. They are perhaps the most

open-minded of the humanoid

races in terms of dealing with each

othermongrelfolk  see

nothing wrong

with  having  orc

friends, any more than

they  have  problems  allying  with

dwarves  or  elves  or  gnomes.  They  treat

every race as equals and as distant cous-

ins and hope to be treated the same

way  in  return.  To  facilitate  this

In  actuality,  mongrelfolk  can  pass

for  members  of  their  parent  racesany

of them. In fact, when someone meets a mon-

grelfolk, he always assumes the new acquaintance is

a  member  of  one  of  the  other  major  humanoid

racesjust  not  his  own.  Dwarves  see

mongrelfolk as unusually tall and broad-

shouldered  elves,  while  elves

might  consider  them

to be surprisingly tall

and  slender  dwarves.

Orcs view them as oddly short

and ugly humans, while humans might

see  them  as  tall  and  strangely  comely

orcs.  To  each  race,  a  mongrelfolk  looks  like  a  member

of  another  race,  because  they  have  features  common  to

several species. Mongrelfolk use this inability to pin down

their  ancestry  to  their  advantage.  After  all,  it  is  difcult

to describe the culprit of a crime if a witness cannot even

identify her race with certainty.

Those  few  mongrelfolk  who  are  born  with  clearly

nonhuman features serve as a distraction from the rest of

the race. They grow up knowing that they will be spat upon

by the other races, but secretly honored by their own kin.

These visibly misshapen mongrelfolk make sure that people

in the area know who they are and where they are, thus

goal,  mongrelfolk learn how to imitate the other

races. They practice archery and woodcraft to be more

like elves, stonework to be more like dwarves, and

cooking to be more similar to halings.

The  races  real  talents  lie  in  the  area  of  stealth.

Mongrelfolk  are  naturally  sneaky,  expert  at

vanishing into a crowd. They hone these skills,

working to become quieter and quicker and

less obtrusive, and their familiarity with

different  races  makes  this  task  even

easier.

Physical  Description:  Mongrelfolk

range in height from a little under 5 feet to almost

6 feet tall, and they weigh between 125 and 230

pounds. Their skin ranges from pale to dark, per-

haps with gray or pink undertones, and their hair ranges

from ne to coarse and black to white-blond. They usually

have large green or brown eyes, which can be dark or pale

or (as is often the case) indeterminate enough to look dark

in shadow but pale in bright light. Their ears are slightly

upswept  and  come  to  mild  points  at  the  upper  tips,  and

they usually have heavy brows and jaws. Mongrelfolk favor

simple, functional clothing and rarely wear jewelry.

Relations: Mongrelfolk get along extremely well with

the  other  humanoid  races,  for  two  reasons.  First,  the

mongrelfolk  themselves  appreciate  each  races  unique

traits and culture, and they enjoy meeting and mingling

A mongrelfolk rogue on the prowl

98

with people. Second, other races never realize mongrelfolk

are among them, taking each mongrelfolk instead for a

member of another race. This allows the mongrelfolk to

move freely through the world, avoiding any racial bias

and giving none in return. Mongrelfolk are perhaps closer

to half-elves than to any other race, because half-elves can

also be mistaken for a member of one of their two parent

races. Mongrelfolk feel a degree of pity toward half-orcs

and half-ogres, who are clearly not human and are perse-

cuted for their differences.

Alignment:  Mongrelfolk  tend  toward  neutrality  and

chaos. They live their lives by their own standards, prefer-

ring to follow instinct rather than rules. Mongrelfolk lean

more toward good than evil, simply because they know that

helping  others  earns  them  more  respect  from  the  world

at large. But some decide that since no other race fully ac-

cepts them, they should not care what happens to anyone

else, and they focus entirely upon their own welfare and

prosperity, even to the point of harming others to achieve

their goals.

Mongrelfolk Lands: Mongrelfolk do not claim their

own lands, and deliberately so. Their race focuses on blend-

ing  in  with  other  races,  and  so  they  carefully  establish

small  communities  within  a  variety  of  lands,  preferably

in large villages or cities where their presence will not be

noticed. Mongrelfolk establish their largest populations in

human cities because humanity contains a great variance of

appearance. Human cities also generally support a racially

mixed population, giving the mongrelfolk even more cover.

Those mongrelfolk who are visibly nonhuman can usually

be found within a days ride of such places, and they live

within caves and swamps close enough to a major road that

travelers can see and hear of them.

Religion:  Mongrelfolk  worship  their  own  god,

Meriadar. The deity appears as a humanoid with an elfs

ears, a dwarfs nose, a humans chin, an orcs jaw, and a

gnomes  eyes.  His  height,  weight,  build,  and  coloring

shift  from  second  to  second,  making  it  impossible  to

pin  down  his  true  features.  Meriadar  encourages  his

people to use their ability to blend in among the other

races, and to remember that they represent the ultimate

result of a mixed society. His priests teach mongrelfolk

the ways of each parent race, help establish and maintain

their hidden communities, and see to the welfare of the

misshapen mongrelfolk set out as distractions from the

rest. Meriadar expects open-mindedness and compassion

from his worshipers, and an attempt to meet and befriend

members of every parent race.

Language: Mongrelfolk speak Common. Many also

speak  Elven,  Dwarven,  Gnome,  Halfling,  Orc,  or  sev-

eral  of  the  above.  Mongrelfolk  have  their  own  pidgin

language, known appropriately enough as Mongrel, but

they only use this when other races are watching.

Names:  Mongrelfolk  pick  their  names  from  those

used  by  other  races,  and  they  take  care  to  use  names

that sound close to those of several different races. They

adopt different last names or clan names depending on

what race they encounter. A mongrelfolks clan name is

used as a middle name, staying constant no matter what

disguise the individual uses. Mongrelfolk clan names are

one syllable in length, and can easily sound like the first

portion of a last name, allowing a mongrelfolk to utter

his clan name and then the fictitious one after it, and

thereby identify himself to any mongrelfolk nearby.

Male Names: Andion, Austen, Caden, Elzedar, Haraze,

Jerain, Michel, Randal, Tahriol, Winden.

Female Names: Betra, Candace, Deliah, Esthel, Gerta,

Jenemia, Lissende, Marte, Safire, Vendela.

Clan Names: Bar, Cam, Del, Fir, Gav, Lim, Mon, Nek,

Pul, Ras.

Adventurers: Mongrelfolk love meeting people and

seeing new places. They particularly enjoy visiting places

where no one knows them, and where they can start fresh

without having to worry about anyone determining their

real ancestry. Mongrelfolk also like spending time with

their parent races, studying each culture and trying to

fit into it or least learn how to prosper within it.

Ultimately,  mongrelfolk  prefer  traveling  to  settling

down. They roam from place to place, plying a craft such

as tinkering or carpentry that earns them respect and

coin  wherever  they  go  and  also  provides  them  a  good

cover for their excursions. Mongrelfolk have a natural

gift  for  stealth  and  thieving;  though  not  all  become

rogues, they keep an eye open for any wealth that might

be had, both for themselves and for their families back

home.

MONGRELFOLK RACIAL TRAITS

+4  Constitution,  2  Intelligence,  4  Charisma:  Mon-

grelfolk are hardy, but they lack proper education and

others nd their appearance repulsive or at least vaguely

unsettling.

Humanoid (human): Mongrelfolk are humanoid creatures

with the human subtype.

Medium:  As  Medium  creatures,  mongrelfolk  have  no

special bonuses or penalties due to size.

Mongrelfolk base land speed is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Mongrelfolk can see twice as far as a

human in starlight, moonlight, and similar conditions of

poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Emulate  Race  (Ex):  Because  of  their  radically  mixed

heritage,  mongrelfolk  can  use  magic  items  that  only

function for a user of a certain race. This ability works like

the emulate race function of the Use Magic Device skill.

A mongrelfolk can automatically emulate any humanoid

race, with no need for a skill check. Mongrelfolk who

have the Use Magic Device skill have a +4 racial bonus

on attempts to emulate nonhumanoid races using that

skill.

SEA KIN

Humans have always held an af nity for the sea. Long ago,

it is said, some returned to its watery embrace

and live beneath the waves to this

day. Others believe the sea kin

came  into  being  through

the  intermingling  of

seallike fey or magical

hybridiza-

tion, since

they

display traits found in mammals that live in watery envi-

ronments.

Sea kin live in shoals and coral reefs adjacent to the shore,

although rumors persist of colonies that have taken to the

open sea. Sea kin towns are wondrous to behold, existing

in  harmony  with  the  rise  and  ebb  of  the  tide  as  it   ows

through their homes. As might be expected, sea kin have

a deep, almost mystical understanding of the ocean, and

they do whatever they can to protect it from harm.

Personality: Sea kin are relatively shy beings who prefer

their  own  kind.  However,  they  live  close  to  (or  within)

human, elf, and other societies and have learned to integrate

themselves  as  much  as  they  can.  Some  act  as  mediators

between humans and various aquatic species.

The social shyness of the race is countered by its intense

curiosity.  New  people  and  experiences  intrigue  sea  kin.

Quiet and observant, sea kin prefer to watch events from

afar before coming closer to investigate. The same applies to

their relationships with others, and it may take considerable

time for another being to gain the trust of a sea kin.

On the whole, sea kin are positive and upbeat, and they

live life with gusto. They are relatively unsophisticated and

often confused by the social complexities of the landbound

races. Sea kin delight in natural beauty but are also drawn

to the creations of other races, particularly treasuring items

that are both practical and aesthetically

appealing.  For  this  reason,

sea kin are not in-

terested  in  the

acquisition

of  gold  or

riches  for

A sea kin community is notable for its location and its architecture

sake of wealth, but they yearn to possess items that they

 nd beautiful.

Physical Description: To a casual observer, a sea kin

looks like a regular  human. On closer examination, however,

the differences between the races become more apparent.

The skin of sea kin is slightly shiny and slippery; it exudes a

protective layer of oil that keeps them warm as well as help-

ing them move through water. The hands and feet of sea kin

are longer than those of a human and have tough webbing

between their  ngers and toes. Sea kin eyes are pitch black

and have a secondary transparent eyelid that allows them

to see unhindered underwater. Their hair is either pitch

black or a metallic hueshining silver, glimmering gold,

or tawny copper. The most disturbing aspect of sea kin is

their mouths, which can open wider than a humans and

are  lled with small, needle-sharp fangs suited for tearing

apart food rather than chewing it.

Sea  kin  wear  clothing  made  from  natural  elements,

particularly  seaweed,  although  they  love  clothes  made

by humans and other land-dwelling races. Because they

spend a large amount of time on land, sea kin carry weap-

ons and equipment similar to that used by land-dwelling

humanoids.

Relations:  Sea  kin  get  along  with  most  aquatic  races,

and  they  maintain  alliances  with  merfolk  and  locathah

communities. They distrust tritons, who view other races

with a slight xenophobic attitude anyway. Sahuagin prey on

lone sea kin who stray too far from the safety of their shoals,

and as a result the two races have been bitter enemies for as

long as either race can remember.

Sea kin enjoy the company of humans; some communi-

ties of mixed sea kin and  humans have lived in harmony for

generations. However, in greedy, suspicious, or just plain

evil human societies, sea kin are viewed as competitors for

resources and as impediments to waterborne travel. Sea kin

prefer leaving for safer waters when con ict seems likely,

but the most tenacious of them might stay to  ght what

they consider to be intolerance or unrestrained cruelty.

Sea kin surround themselves with creatures of the sea

such  as  packs  of  seals,  sea  lions,  walruses,  and  similar

creatures, just as humans do with canines and other domes-

ticated animals that are kept as pets and companions rather

than livestock. As might be expected, sea kin take a dim

view of humans who hunt these creatures, although they

can  be  made  to  understand  the  necessity  of  slaying  the

animals if no other food is available.

Alignment: Sea kin are shy but friendly, and they wish

to get along with their neighbors. They tend toward neutral

good, with a strong sense of community and willingness to

help others. They see their few laws as a way to help bring

order to the tumultuous ocean. Sea kin who live among

humans  adopt  a  more  lawful  attitude,  while  those  who

live along the untamed shore are much more chaotic and

free-spirited.

Sea Kin Lands: Sea kin build impressive communities

among rocky crags and cliffs. Their dwellings are designed

to be partially underwater at high tide, allowing the waves

to lap across the oor. In some areas, coastal humans and

sea kin have built fully integrated communities friendly to

both species.

Because  of  the  relative  scarcity  of  prime  locations  in

which to construct their coral homes, sea kin sometimes

inhabit the same territories as aquatic races. In the case of

merfolk and sea elves, this incursion rarely causes problems,

although squabbles can occur when food runs low.

Religion: Sea kin venerate nature, especially as it relates

to the ocean. Those who worship a particular deity are drawn

to Obad-Hai, although sea kin have been known to worship

any of the same deities as the local humans. Those who feel

closer to the sea worship Eadro, a sea deity also venerated

by locathah and merfolk, or Deep Sashelas, an elf undersea

god of knowledge and beauty.

Language: Sea kin speak Common, heavily peppered

with Elven phrases (spoken with a sea elf dialect) and the

occasional word of Aquan. Because sea kin spend so much

time in the water, they write primarily on durable surfaces

such as shell or stone with a orid, liquid script that is very

pleasing to the eye. Sea kin tales are lled with evocative

allegories that relate to their ocean home, and their stories

tend to be long epics with cyclical themes. Sea kin  who

are more isolated become uent in Aquan, the language of

aquatic creatures.

Names: Sea kin have strict guidelines about how names

are granted to newborns. A male child must take the name

of his great-great-grandfather, while a female must follow

the same tradition on the maternal side. New names are

imports, added when sea folk encounter an individual who

greatly impresses them and who has aided the sea kin in

some grand fashion. For this reason, linguists note more

than a few elf and haling names among sea kin commu-

nities. Orc, dwarf, and gnome names are almost entirely

absent, indicating that either sea kin hold these beings in

poor regard or they simply havent had enough contact with

those races to warrant the inclusion of names from their

languages.

Male  Names:  Darrius,  Eemel,  Marriton,  Oskil,  Phen,

Rokar.

Female Names: Ammera, Evaa, Lilellia, Sorras, Talisera,

Veras.

Adventurers: Sea kin generally prefer to stick close to

the safety of their coral homes, occasionally trading with

nearby land-dwelling people. That said, sea kin also have

a strong sense of curiosity, and some individuals become

adventurers out of sheer inquisitiveness. Other sea kin turn

to adventuring after a particularly violent encounter with

a dangerous race, becoming obsessed with hunting down

those enemies.

Because of their understanding of the natural ebb and

ow of the sea and the seasons, sea kin are drawn to the

path of the druid, and many display an afnity for nature

magic, particularly that associated with water, wind, and

sea. Sea kin warriors are tough, persistent ghters who have

few qualms about tackling their enemies head on.

SEA KIN RACIAL TRAITS

Humanoid  (human):  Sea  kin  are  humanoid  creatures

with the human subtype.

Medium: As Medium creatures, sea kin have no bonuses

or penalties due to size.

Sea kin base land speed is 30 feet. Their base swim speed

is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Sea kin can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, and similar conditions of poor

illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color

and detail under these conditions.

4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at

each additional level: Sea kin (like their human ancestors)

are versatile and capable. (The 4 skill points at 1st level

are added on as a bonus, not multiplied in.)

+2 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks: Sea kin naturally

secrete a slippery oil to facilitate swimming. This secre-

tion also makes it easy for them to slip out of restraints.

Hold Breath (Ex): A sea kin can hold his breath for a

number of rounds equal to 8  his Constitution score

before he risks drowning.

Weapon Familiarity: Sea kin treat tridents and nets as

simple weapons.

Water Dependency: A sea kin must immerse his entire

body in water at least once a week or suffer ill effects.

After a week has passed, a sea kin must make a Constitu-

tion check every day thereafter (DC 10 + 1 per additional

day) or take 1 point of Constitution damage. Once a sea

kin immerses his body in water, he immediately regains

1d4 points  of Constitution per hour that he remains

in water.

Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Aquan,

Elven, and Sahuagin.

Favored Class: Druid. A multiclass sea kins druid class

does not count when determining whether he takes an

experience point penalty for multiclassing.

SHARAKIM

Humans assume that all orcs are the sameugly, brutish,

violent, and determined to kill anyone who stands in their

path. These suppositions rarely prove false. But even orcs

display  variation  within  the  species,  and  one  group  in

particular stands apart from all others.

The sharakim (the name means the tainted or those

with taint in an old human dialect) were once human. At

least, their forebears were. Legends claim that, long

ago, all humans resided in the village of Desh. They

lived peacefully until a hunter named Sharak killed

a sacred stag, and all those who ate of the stags  esh

became ill. Many died, but others were transformed,

twisted into hideous caricatures of humanity by the

evil they had committed. The humans who escaped

the curse scattered, leaving Desh to be lost forever.

Those creatures who had once been human gathered

together and  ed as well, making their own way in the

world but forever after hated by humans because they

stood as a reminder of that sin. These became

the sharakim.

Sharakim live in small villages and towns.

They are comfortable in hills and mountains,

especially places that feature long shadows and

high  cliffs  on  every  side.  They  are  eager  for

outside contact, and thus settle close to other

races.  They  make  frequent  forays  to  nearby

towns and encourage their neighbors to visit

them, whereupon they take the part of lavish

hosts.  Sharakim  spend  their  waking  hours

 ghting  the  impression  people  assume  based

on  their  appearance;  only  in  the  privacy  of

their own homes do they relax and gather their

thoughts.

Personality: Sharakim learn from early childhood

that they were created from sin, and that others believe

their existence is a curse upon the world. This knowledge

makes  them  sullen  when  they  are  alone,  and  eager  to

please when they are with other races. Humans compare

them to puppies, which hate to be alone and accept any

treatment because it means attention. Sharakim despise

other orcs, seeing them as examples of what they could

have become, and they make every effort to distinguish

themselves from those monsters. They bathe frequently

and are fastidious about their clothing and manners. They

learn to speak Common and strive to pronounce the words

without an accent, which is dif cult because of their

tusks. Sharakim villages are models of tidiness and

order, each house carefully placed in relation to

its neighbors, and each one kept spotlessly clean.

Sharakim strive to better themselves individually,

constantly improving their knowledge and skills to make

themselves worthy of social interaction.

Physical Description: Sharakim stand between 5 feet

and  6  feet  tall  and  weigh  140  to  275  pounds.  Their  skin

ranges from light gray to coal black; their hair is thick but

not  coarse,  and  such  a  deep  black  it  seems  almost  blue,

though some sharakim sport silver or white streaks. They

usually have either jet-black or slate-gray eyes, and more

rarely eyes of dark blue or dark green. Small, curved horns

protrude from both temples, and their lower canines are

sharp tusks that jut up past their upper lips. Sharakim noses

are usually short and snubbed, with wide nostrils.

Sharakim, due to their

human roots, are a special

breed indeed

Sharakim dress as well as their circumstances allow, to

distinguish themselves from orcs. They prefer  nely made

shirts and pants, with soft leather boots and gloves. Many

wear hats with broad brims, pulled low to cover their horns,

while others prefer cloaks with deep hoods. Sharakim keep

their thick  ngernails trimmed, and their tusks and horns

polished.  They  decorate  their  horns  and  tusks,  carving

them like ivory, capping them with precious metals, or even

imbedding gems in them. Their hair is braided or pulled

103

back and held by a ne metal clip. Sharakim hate to expose

their feet and hands, because both are oversized and feature

thick, talonlike nails.

Relations: Sharakim go out of their way to ingratiate

themselves with other races. They greet anyone they meet

openly and cheerfully, often in the strangers native lan-

guage. Gnomes have the easiest time adjusting to sharakim,

being able to look past their appearance and admire their

drive and education, and the two races often live near one

another, visiting to trade information and goods. Halings

admire the determination of sharakim but still feel uncom-

fortable around them, and become shy in their presence.

Elves and dwarves do not trust the sharakim, proclaiming

that an orc in fancy clothes is still an orc. They cannot deny

the races intelligence and renement, but they still suspect

a sinister motive behind the civilized behavior. Humans

nd themselves torn in their reactionsthe sharakim look

like orcs, but they act completely human. Human merchants

happily  do  business  with  sharakim,  but  priests  suspect

darker intentions behind their eagerness, and ghters prefer

not to trust them as comrades in battle.

Alignment: Sharakim love rules, because they like to

show that they can understand and obey such strictures.

They  strive  to  be  generous  and  helpful,  making  lawful

good their most common alignment. Some sharakim lean

toward neutrality, and a few are actively chaotic, preferring

an individual approach to a mandated path.

Sharakim  Lands:  Sharakim  live  in  villages  nestled

among high hills or low mountains. They prefer the protec-

tion of cliffs around them, but they also like to be close to

other races, so their homes are usually no more than a few

days travel from a human or gnome village. Sharakim do

not like open water, preferring to avoid settlements located

next to rivers or lakes.

Sharakim can be found in large human cities, where they

delight in the number of people present and in the chance

to  mingle  with  everyone  openly.  They  purchase  homes

and redecorate them, creating elaborate carvings on door

frames and columns and hanging intricate tapestries on

the walls. Sharakim are known as excellent hosts no matter

where they live, because their homes are always luxurious

and well maintained, and because they go out of their way

to make guests comfortable.

Religion: The sharakim have no deity of their own. They

abhor Gruumsh, the god of the orcs, and most do not feel

themselves worthy to pray to any human god. Those who

dare approach a human deity pray to Heironeous, asking

him to look past their twisted exteriors and see the honor

and lawfulness within.

Language:  All  sharakim  speak  Common,  and  most

speak at least one other language, usually Dwarven, Elven,

or Gnome. Though a few sharakim learn Orcthe better to

understand their enemiesthey will not speak Orc under

any circumstances, and nothing written in that language

is allowed in their homes.

Sharakim love to read. They collect books in a variety

of languages,  and many  who  live  in cities become book-

sellers.

Names: Sharakim prefer to take either human names or

names that t with the society around them. They love long

names, since short names seem brutishsharakim never

use an abbreviation of anyones name, and they insist that

friends and business partners use their full names as well.

A sharakims last name is his clan name, and his given name

is of human derivation. A sharakim is named at birth, but

when he reaches adulthood his elders select a new name

for him, one that ts his personality and talents. Sharakim

keep  their  birth  name  as  a  middle  name.  Sometimes  a

sharakim adds a third name once he is older and settled

in a particular business; then his adult name becomes his

rst middle name, and the birth name remains as a second

middle name.

Male Names: Alastair, Benjamin, Carrington, Daniel,

Malcolm, Nathaniel, Reginald, Winchester.

Female  Names:  Aurora,  Bedelia,  Christina,  Clarissa,

Elizabeth, Margaret, Winnifred.

Clan Names: Andromar, Barechian, Helefern, Lochla-

man, Malendik, Norferat, Sarekar.

Adventurers: Every sharakim feels he has to prove his

worth, both to himself and to others. He strives to show

that he is as smart, as noble, as honorable, and as skilled as

any human or dwarf or elf, because he believes this effort

will win their respect. Most sharakim, upon reaching adult-

hood,  leave  their  villages  to  go  adventuring.  This  allows

them to encounter strangers, make new friends, and hone

their skills. Earning riches is less important than winning

renown, and a sharakim who is immortalized in song is the

pride of his clan.

SHARAKIM RACIAL TRAITS

+2 Strength, 2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma:

Sharakim are naturally strong but their size makes them

clumsy. Their monstrous appearance works against them

in social settings, but their culture forces them to be well

educated.

Humanoid (human): Sharakim are humanoid creatures

with the human subtype.

Medium: As Medium creatures, sharakim have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

Sharakim base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Sharakim can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like normal sight, and sharakim can function just ne

with no light at all.

+1  natural  armor  bonus:  Sharakim  skin  is  tough  and

difcult to pierce.

Shadow  Afnity  (Ex):  Sharakim  are  born  to  darkness,

and despite their claims they operate best in night and

shadow. In areas of darkness or shadowy illumination, a

(including  half-orcs):  Sharakim  despise  orcs,

and learn special combat techniques that enable

them to ght them more effectively.

guages:  Dwarven,  Elven,  Gnome,  and

Orc.

SKULK

Once members of an underprivileged

caste of an ancient empire, the humans

who  would  become  skulks  withdrew

from the world through a magical cer-

emony that solidied their untouchable

status.  The  ritual  granted  them  natural

camouage, allowing skulks to blend in

perfectly with their surroundings.

Skulks  gather  in  small  bands  within  or

near human communities. When night falls,

they engage in raids that result in bloodshed

as  the  skulks  innate  hatred  for  humans

manifests itself in murderous rage. They use

ambush, deception, and superior numbers

to overwhelm their victims.

Personality:  Skulks  are  angry,  violent

creatures  who  harbor  jealous  hatred  for

all beings more fortunate than them (which

includes just about everyone). They have a pow-

erful self-preservation instinct, often mistaken

for cowardice, that keeps them to the shadows.

They have little regard even for their own people,

and skulk mothers have been known to abandon

their  own  young  if  it  meant  protecting  their

own skin.

Physical Description: Skulks stand between 5 feet and

6 feet tall and weigh 120 to 180 pounds. They are completely

hairless  and  wear  little  or  no  clothing.  It  is  difcult  to

determine, at rst glance, whether a skulk is male or female.

Their  skin  is  usually  dull  gray,  but  an  individual  can

change its color on a whim, from a subdued brown to a

lurid red or yellow. Skulks are capable of assuming

any natural human esh tone to better blend

in. They have pupilless blue eyes, regardless of

their skin coloration.

Relations: Skulks typically hate all human-

oid  races,  but  display  particular  viciousness

toward  their  human  forebears.  Even  those

skulks  who  arent  evil  dont  usually  trust

other  races,  remaining  on  the  outskirts  of

civilization rather than trying to integrate

themselves.

Alignment:  Naturally  violent  and  cruel,

skulks tend toward chaos and evil, though a

few manage to avoid these tendencies. Good

skulks  are  outcasts  even  among  their  own

people, and lawful skulks are extraordinarily rare

(but can become leaders among their race).

Skulk Lands: Skulks have no lands of their

own, instead living near or within human

towns  and  cities.  They  are  parasitic  in

nature, living off what they can scrounge

or  steal.  Particularly  bold  skulks  even  live

among humans for short periods of time, using

disguise and subterfuge to survive.

Religion:  Skulks  typically  worship  deities

devoted  to  evil,  deception,  treachery,  and

murder.  Nerull  and  Vecna  nd  numerous

worshipers  among  the  skulks.  Nonevil  skulks

venerate deities such as Boccob or Olidammara.

Their most revered deity is the god Syrul, a neu-

tral  evil  god  of  lies,  deceit,  treachery,  and  false

promises. Her domains are Evil, Knowledge, and

Trickery, and her favored weapon is the dagger.

Language: Skulks speak a bastardized version

of Common, rife with words and concepts from

long-dead  human  cultures.  They  can

understand  speakers  of  Common,  and

vice versa.

Names:  Skulk  names  are  typically

simple, one- or two-syllable monikers.

something, its probably not

a good thing

They  avoid  harsh,  sibilant  sounds  (such  as  f,  s,  or  x),  the

better to signal their allies quietly. Skulks do not recognize

any ties to family or clan, and thus rarely use anything more

than a single name.

Male Names: Hadan, Krem, Lar, Lorrid, Mullev.

Female Names: Adal, Ev, Ilen, Olleg, Udge.

Adventurers:  Skulks  who  are  brave  enough  to  leave

their  people  are  rare,  but  can  prove  effective  adventur-

ers. Skulk adventurers, however, are outcasts from their

coterie,  forced  into  a  life  of  danger  by  necessity  rather

than choice. In any case, skulk adventurers are most often

rogues, ghters, or barbarians. Skulk bards who overcome

the  races  naturally  insensitive  personality  can  become

exceptional spies.

SKULK RACIAL TRAITS

+4  Dexterity,  2  Wisdom,  4  Charisma:  Skulks  are

agile  and  graceful,  but  have  weak  wills  and  subdued

personalities.

Humanoid (human): Skulks are humanoid creatures with

the human subtype.

Medium: As Medium creatures, skulks have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

Skulk base land speed is 30 feet.

Racial  Hit  Dice:  A  skulk  begins  with  two  levels  of

humanoid,  which  provide  2d8  Hit  Dice,  a  base  attack

bonus of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +0,

Ref +3, and Will +0.

Racial Skills: A skulks humanoid levels give it skill points

equal to 5  (2 + Int modier). Its class skills are Hide

(Dex) and Move Silently (Dex).

Racial Feats: A skulks humanoid levels give it one feat.

+8 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a +15 racial

bonus on Hide checks: Skulks excel at keeping to the

shadows. These bonuses apply only when a skulk is wear-

ing light armor or no armor.

Innate Nondetection (Su): Skulks are difcult to detect

by  divination  spells  such  as  clairaudience/clairvoyance,

locate  creature,  detect  spells,  and  items  such  as  a  crystal

ball. If a divination is attempted upon a skulk, the caster

of the divination must succeed on a DC 20 caster level

check.

Peerless Camouage (Ex): Skulks can move at full speed

(and can even run) while hiding, taking no penalties on

Hide checks due to movement.

Trackless  Path  (Ex):  The  DC  of  any  Survival  check  to

follow the trail of a skulk is increased by 10.

Automatic  Language:  Common.  Bonus  Languages:

Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass skulks rogue class

does not count when determining whether he takes an

experience point penalty for multiclassing.

SKULK MONSTER CLASS

Humanoid (Human)

If  you  want  to  play  a  skulk  at  1st  level,  you  can  use  the

skulk monster class. To use the monster class, generate your

character with the racial traits given below (rather than the

skulk racial traits presented above), and then take levels in

the skulk class as you would levels of other classes. For more

information on monster classes, see the Monster Classes

section at the beginning of this chapter.

Skulks are masters of stealth, relying on superior camou-

age and other talents to sneak up on victims. They make

excellent burglars, spies, and, of course, assassins. They lack

versatility, but make up for that with unparalleled excellence

at defying detection.

Skulks begin play with none of their extraordinary or

supernatural  abilities,  but  are  quite  capable  at  sneaking

already. They soon master the races innate talents of stealth

and camouage, reaching full strength by 3rd level.

RACIAL TRAITS AT 1ST LEVEL

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dexterity,  2

Wisdom, 4 Charisma. Skulks are agile and graceful, but

have weak wills and subdued personalities.

Speed: Skulk base land speed is 30 feet.

Medium: As Medium creatures, skulks have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

+4  racial  bonus  on  Move  Silently  checks  and  +5  racial

bonus on Hide checks: Skulks excel at keeping to the

shadows. These bonuses apply only when a skulk is wear-

ing light armor or no armor.

Automatic Language: Common.

CLASS SKILLS

The skulks class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Hide (Dex) and Move Silently (Dex).

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the skulk monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: Skulks are procient

with all simple weapons, but have no prociency with any

armor or shield.

Racial  Skill  Bonus:  A  skulks  racial  bonus  on  Move

Silently checks improves to +6 at 2nd level and to +8 at 3rd

level. A skulks racial bonus on Hide checks improves to

+10 at 2nd level and to +15 at 3rd level.

Trackless Path (Ex): Beginning  when a skulk reaches

2nd level, the DC of any Survival check to follow his  trail

is increased by 10.

Innate Nondetection (Su): A skulk of 3rd level or higher

is difcult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudi-

ence/clairvoyance, locate creature, detect spells, and items such

as a crystal ball. If a divination is attempted upon the skulk,

TIEFLING

A  tie ing  is  the  descendant

of a union between an infer-

nal  creature  and  a  human.

Shunned  and  maligned

by  the  world  at  large,  tief-

lings maintain a low pro le

and  make  their  livings  as

spies,  thieves,  assassins,  or

smugglers.  Few  find  the

legitimate  world  very

appealing, and instead they

blossom in the seedier side

of society.

Tie ings are diametrically

opposed  to  aasimars  (see

page  92),  and  the  two  have

found themselves innately at

odds for untold generations.

Some tie ings serve as mere

soldiers for the dark powers,

while others devise their own

sel sh goals, seeing coopera-

tion with infernal beings for

mutual bene t.

Personality: Tie ings have

a  well-deserved  reputation

for being conniving, sneaky,

and  underhanded.  They  are

universally  self-serving  and

only look out for number one.

Some  take  their  evil  nature

to  an  extreme  and  become

champions of woe, despair,

and violence. Most tief-

lings,  however,  prefer

to  skulk  behind  the

scenes, using deceit and

surprise as their primary

weapons.

In rare instances, a tie ing  ghts her natural impulses

toward evil and strives to do good (or at least not to cause

harm). These repentant beings face persecution and mistrust

from others of their kind.

Physical  Description:  Tie ings  appear  human  at  a

glance,  although  they  all  possess  at  least  one  unnatural

feature  that  reveals  their  infernal  heritage.  At  the  least,

tie ings  have  a  disturbing  demeanor  or  carry  a  whiff  of

brimstone about them, but most also possess small horns,

red eyes, or needle-sharp teeth. In extreme cases, a tie ing

may have a barbed tail or cloven feet. No two tie ings have

the same appearance.

Relations: Tie ings are universally reviled by members

of almost every other race, good or evil. Most are perse-

cuted  and  cast  out  from  society  when  their  true  nature

is revealed. In such a case, the outcast takes to the wild,

dons a disguise, or, more

commonly,  works  her-

self  into  a  position  of

power  and  authority

so  that  she  can  make

her  own  rules.  Tie ings

find  easier  acceptance

among evil races such as

orcs, goblins, and gnolls,

but  only  if  they  prove

their  own  strength  and

power. As a result of this

relentless  rejection,  tief-

lings  view  other  races

as  nothing  more  than

chattel or pawns in their

convoluted schemes.

Alignment:  Due  to

their  infernal  blood,

almost  all  tie ings  are

evil.  Whether  rapacious

and chaotic, self-serving

and subtle, or adhering to

a twisted and rigid sense

of honor and lawfulness,

few  tie ings  escape  the

taint  in  their  blood  that

bids them toward evil.

Tie  ing Lands: Like

other  planetouched

creatures,  tie ings  are

too  few  in  number

to  claim  their  own

lands.  However,

they can be found

almost anywhere,

particularly in evil

and lawless lands

where their lack of scruples is an asset. Tie ings typically

crave power, preferring to pull strings from the shadows

rather than rise to overt positions of authority.

Religion: Most tie ings are too consumed by their own

agenda to pay attention to religion. Those who choose to

worship are devoutly dedicated to dark and infernal powers

such as Hextor, Nerull, and Wee Jas.

Language:  Like  aasimars,  tie ings  are  largely  raised

language.  The  Infernal  tongue  comes  naturally  to  them;

some parents of tieings have been horried when their

childs rst words sounded as if they had emerged from the

Abyss. Tieings learn several different languages during

their wandering travels.

Names:  Most  tieings  have  human  names,  although

one may acquire an infernal-sounding name, especially if

raised by parents who accepted the taint of their offspring.

Some tieings take on multiple names and switch aliases

numerous times during their lives to help them from be-

ing hunted down.

Male Names: Gooruth, Kharkuk, Mexil, Takkak, Vex-

imitron, Zarek.

Female  Names:  Cherrakia,  Keberii,  Seshra,  Shalim,

Nessis, Ventera.

Adventurers: Subtle and devious, tieings are natural

rogues, striking from the shadows and manipulating the

weak minded. Tieings devoted to a dark deity become

clerics.  Martial  tieings  become  ghters  or  rangers,

choosing humans and other good races as their favored

enemies.  Their  naturally  poor  Charisma  hinders  most

tieings  in  learning  the  bardic  arts,  though  a  few  are

attracted to the idea of entertaining and thereby manipu-

lating others.

TIEFLING RACIAL TRAITS

+2  Dexterity,  +2  Intelligence,  2  Charisma:  Tieings

infernal heritage grants them quickness and cleverness,

but others nd their sinister aura unsettling.

Outsider (native): Tieings are outsiders who are native to

the Material Plane. Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders

need to eat and sleep.

Medium: As Medium creatures, tieings have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

Tieing base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Tieings can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like  normal  sight,  and  tieings  can  function  just  ne

with no light at all.

+2 racial bonus on Bluff and Hide checks: Tieings are

deceptive and stealthy.

Darkness (Sp): A tieing can use darkness once per day as

a 1st-level caster or a caster of her class level, whichever

is higher.

Automatic  Languages:  Common  and  Infernal.  Bonus

Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin,

Haling, and Orc.

Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass tieings rogue class

does not count when determining whether she takes an

experience point penalty for multiclassing.

Level adjustment +1.

UNDERFOLK

The underfolk are descendants of bands of humans who

choseor were forcedto live in the caves and twisting

passageways of the underground world. Over generations,

these  humans  adapted  to  this  strange  world,  lled  with

natural wonders and dangerous creatures. Some underfolk

societies have not ventured to the surface in generations,

and  others  have  forgotten  their  true  origins  altogether.

However, those who live close to the caves that give entry

to the underground realms make occasional forays to the

surface  and  even  engage  in  limited  trade  with  surface-

dwelling humans.

Underfolk are a simple, clannish people dedicated to their

homes and the safety of their race. Because of the multitude

of evil and predatory races and creatures in the caves and

tunnels  they  call  home,  underfolk  have  become  quick,

stealthy, and survival-oriented. Although rather primitive

and rustic when it comes to technology, underfolk make up

for this lack with a superior knowledge of how to survive

beneath  ground,  although  even  they  avoid  the  deepest

depths of the subterranean realms.

Personality:  Underfolk  are  insular  and  focused  on

their  tribes  well-being.  They  can  be  mildly  xenophobic

and suspicious of strangers, although they become deeply

loyal to those who are true to their word and prove their

worth.  While  not  as  bound  to  their  grudges  as  dwarves

are, underfolk nevertheless take oaths very seriously and

immediately sever ties with any being who lies or otherwise

deceives them.

Underfolk  maintain  a  deep  spiritual  connection  with

their home and have come to understand the subtle rhythms

of its seasons. They delight in the natural beauty of under-

ground  caves,  warrens,  and  grottos,  and  do  their  best  to

keep them from harm. Underfolk have a rich oral tradition

and ll their speech with allegories, oaths, and hyperbolic

statements. Unlike those of dwarves, who share a similar

custom, underfolk stories are poetic and rather dreamlike

in quality.

Singing is a favorite pastime among underfolk, and every

individual knows a litany of tunes.

Physical  Description:  Underfolk  are  both  short  and

slight,  with  builds  similar  to  elves.  They  typically  stand

between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall, weighing 100 to 150 pounds.

Their eyes and ears are proportionally larger than those of

humans, having evolved to enable underfolk to see in pitch

blackness  and  make  out  the  quietest  sounds.  Underfolk

have thick body hair to keep them warm in the chill of their

tunnels, and they wear their typically black or silvery-white

tresses long.

Underfolk depend for survival on their ability to blend

into the surrounding terrain. Their skin has evolved special

pigmentation that can mimic the various rocky hues found

in the underground, allowing them to seemingly disappear

into a nearby wall.

dwarves or gnomes show a healthy respect for Moradin or

Garl Glittergold.

Language: Underfolk live close enough to the surface

that they still speak a heavily accented version of Common,

with  each  tribe  infusing  its  speech  with  phrases  from

Dwarven, Gnome, or other languages from nearby races.

Underfolk learn to speak these languages as well, and they

 nd Undercommon especially useful. Few underfolk bother

to learn how to read, and those who do use Dwarven script

rather than Common.

Names: Underfolk names were originally human, but

have  evolved  over  generations  of  isolation  from  humans

and the in ux of words from subterranean races. The few

linguists who have studied the simple and guttural under-

folk names see connections with surface cultures that died

out long ago.

Relations:  Underfolk  prefer  to  keep  to  themselves,

although  of  necessity  tribes  try  to  build  goodwill  with

friendlier races that live nearby. Underfolk who live close

to the surface have contact with humans, hal ings, and the

occasional elf society, and serve as guides for those who want

to plumb the depths of the underground realms. However,

they  are  shy  and  suspicious  when  dealing  with  surface-

dwellers.  Underfolk  are  decidedly  neutral  when  dealing

with dwarves, because this stout race views underfolk as

primitive and barbaric. Those dwarves who overlook this

prejudice   nd  a  kind  people  who  simply  want  to  be  left

alone. In turn, underfolk occasionally provide aid to dwarves

when needed, especially when their mutual assistance is

needed  to   ght  against  their  common  foesdrow,  orcs,

and the like.

Underfolk are the target of drow, svirfneblin, and kuo-toa

aggression, and they do their best to avoid contact with these

races. However, as hunter-gatherers, underfolk commonly

have to enter their enemies territory to  nd enough food to

survive. Also, due to their relative closeness to the surface,

underfolk come into hostile contact with orcs, who have

need of the same caves that the underfolk inhabit.

Alignment:  Concerned  primarily  with  their  own

survival  and  the  well-being  of  the  tribe,  underfolk

remain neutral, with a slight tendency toward good or

lawfulness. Chaotic underfolk are not common, but

are typically relegated to the outskirts of society rather

than  driven  out  entirely,  since  the  tribes  welfare

depends on every individuals efforts. On occasion,

underfolk tribes that live in close contact with

drow or deep gnomes have fallen to evil, after

centuries of warfare, depression, and cynicism

have  worn  down  their  sense  of  justice  and

hope.

Underfolk Lands: Underfolk live in the

shallowest regions of the underground,

within a mile or so of the surface. Tribes

live in the same territory as orcs, goblins,

drow,  and  other  subterranean  dwellers,

but do their best to remain unnoticed. Most

underfolk tribes number between  fty and

one hundred individuals, although larger

tribes  exist,  including  at  least  a  few

cities  of  nearly  a  thousand  people.

Underfolk  tribes  with  a  militaristic

bent make forays into orc and goblin

warrens,  in  an  effort  to  drive  those

creatures out of areas they want to

claim for themselves.

Religion:  Underfolk  are  deeply

spiritual  and  connected  closely

with the natural world. Some tribes

brought the memories of the sur-

face  gods  with  them,  especially

Obad-Hai. Tribes in close contact with

An underfolk barbarian emerges from darkness into light

109

Male Names: Baroo, Gungir, Hoornoo, Mettar, Narar,

Turungo.

Female Names: Ahmpa, Bethera, Halla, Noola, Tooloo,

Vema.

Adventurers: Hardy, self-reliant, and erce in battle,

underfolk  commonly  become  barbarians  or  rangers.

Because  of  their  tie  to  the  natural  world,  underfolk

spellcasters  are  druids  or  clerics,  although  wizards

and  sorcerers  exist  among  tribes  in  close  contact  with

gnomes. Their rich oral history and love of song make

bards  a  common  sight  among  the  underfolk,  acting  as

liaisons and diplomats between far-ung tribes. Rogues

are uncommon, but they excel in the darkness, slinking

among  the  stones  with  quiet  grace.  Paladin  and  monk

underfolk are exceedingly rare.

UNDERFOLK RACIAL TRAITS

Humanoid (human): Underfolk are humanoid creatures

with the human subtype.

Medium: As Medium creatures, underfolk have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

Underfolk base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Underfolk can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise

like normal sight, and underfolk can function just ne

with no light at all.

4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at

each additional level, since underfolk (like their human

ancestors) are versatile and capable. (The 4 skill points at

1st level are added on as a bonus, not multiplied in.)

+2 racial bonus on Listen checks: Living as underground

hunters  for  generations  has  given  underfolk  keen

hearing.

Weapon  Familiarity:  Underfolk  treat  light  and  heavy

picks as simple weapons rather than martial weapons.

Camouage (Ex): Underfolk can change their skin col-

oration at will to mimic the surrounding terrain, giving

them a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. In rocky terrain,

this bonus increases to +10. This ability works even if an

underfolk is viewed with darkvision, although true seeing

negates the bonus.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Underfolk are dazzled in bright

sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Drow,

Dwarven, Gnome, Goblin, and Orc. Underfolk mingle

with  subterranean  races  and  learn  their  languages  to

facilitate interaction.

Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multi-

class  underfolk  takes  an  experience  point  penalty,  his

highest-level class does not count.

Sometimes  its  good  to  be  a  ghter,  able  to  wield  any

weapon. Other times, youd be better off as a rogue, with

stealth and the ability to backstab foes. And sometimes,

nothing  but  spells  will  do  the  trick.  When  these

situations collide and you need one answer, you need

a chameleon.

Chameleons are dilettantes in every class and masters

of none. They know enough of each classs skills and

abilities to mimic that class effectively. You can mas-

querade as a ghter, a rogue, or even a wizard or a cleric.

Part of it is power, of courseyou learn to harness your

own natural energy, shaping it into whichever class

you require that day. But the rest is pure attitudeyou

are a talented performer, and when you walk into a

room with a holy symbol around your neck, people

believe you have true faith.

BECOMING A CHAMELEON

A  member  of  any  class  can  become  a  chame-

leonbecause, after all, a chameleon can become

anyone.  The  easiest  path  is  through  the  rogue

class,  since  the  rogues  large  number  of  skill

points makes meeting the skill requirements easy.

Bards also make excellent chameleons, since they are

talented performers who already know some magic.

he seven prestige classes provided in this chapter

are designed for the races described in Chapters

13 of this book (humans, half-elves, half-orcs,

and  illumians),  as  well  as  the  various  human-

oid races discussed in Chapter 4. Most of these

prestige classes work best in human-dominated cultures

and urban settings.

Table 51, below, provides a brief characterization of each

prestige class.

Chameleons who were spellcasters have a clear advantage,

because their spell lists are not as limited. Chameleon clerics

are rare, but extremely valuable, because they can heal and

turn undead with more potency than a chameleon merely

posing as a priest. The class is also an interesting choice for

monkstheir discipline makes it easier to adapt the body

to each new role, even if their poor social skills hamper

their performances.

CLASS FEATURES

The chameleons class features allow you to adopt a variety of

roles, from armored warrior to spellcaster to sneaky rogue.

You cant use any abilities gained from your aptitude focus,

ability boon, or mimic class feature abilities to qualify for a

feat, prestige class, or other option. You can use your bonus

feat to qualify for such options, but if you change the feat,

you suffer the normal drawbacks for no longer meeting a

prerequisite or requirement.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: You gain prociency

with all simple weapons and with all forms of armor, includ-

ing shields (but not tower shields).

Aptitude Focus (Ex): Once per day, you can select one

of ve areas upon which to focus your ever-shifting talents.

After meditating for 1 hour, you gain the chosen abilities

for 24 hours or until you change your aptitude focus. An

aptitude focus ability is usable once per day at 1st level, twice

per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 10th level.

At 5th level, you can change your aptitude focus one time

per  day,  and  at  10th  level  you  can  change  your  aptitude

focus two times per day. If you change to the arcane focus

or divine focus ability, you must still obey the normal rules

for preparing spells (including any rest required).

Arcane  Focus:  You  gain  the  ability  to  prepare  and  cast

arcane spells, which may be chosen from the spell list of

any arcane spellcasting class. You prepare and cast these

spells just as a wizard does, including the use of a spellbook

(chameleons often use stolen or borrowed spellbooks; see

page 178 of the Players Handbook for details). Your spells per

day are noted on Table 52: The Chameleon. You gain bonus

spells for a high Intelligence score, just as a wizard does.

When Table 52 indicates that you get 0 spells per day of a

given spell level, you gain only the bonus spells you would

be entitled to based on your Intelligence score for that spell

level. Your caster level is equal to twice your class level.

You  also  gain  a  +2  competence  bonus  on  Knowledge

(arcana) checks and Spellcraft checks and a +2 bonus on

Will saves; at 5th level, the bonuses improve to +4.

Combat  Focus:  You  gain  prociency  with  all  martial

weapons. You also gain a +2 competence bonus on attack

rolls and weapon damage rolls and a +2 bonus on Fortitude

saves. At 5th level, the bonuses improve to +4.

Divine Focus: You gain the ability to prepare and cast divine

spells, which may be chosen from the spell list of any divine

spellcasting class. You prepare and cast these spells just as a

cleric does, except that you cannot spontaneously cast spells.

You can only prepare new divine spells at sunrise. Your spells

per day are noted on Table 52: The Chameleon. You gain

bonus spells for a high Wisdom score, just as a cleric does.

When Table 52 indicates that you get 0 spells per day of a

given spell level, you gain only the bonus spells you would be

entitled to based on your Wisdom score for that spell level.

Your caster level is equal to twice your class level.

You  also  gain  a  +2  competence  bonus  on  Knowledge

(religion)  checks  and  a  +2  bonus  on  Fortitude  and  Will

saves; at 5th level, the bonuses improve to +4.

Stealth  Focus:  You  gain  trapnding  (see  page  50  of  the

Players Handbook), uncanny dodge (see page 26 of the Players

Handbook), a +2 competence bonus on Disable Device, Hide,

Move  Silently,  Open  Lock,  and  Search  checks,  and  a  +2

bonus on Reex saves. At 5th level, the bonuses improve

to +4.

Wild Focus: You gain wild empathy (see page 35 of the

Players Handbook; treat your druid level as equal to your class

level), woodland stride (see page 36 of the Players Handbook),

Knowledge (nature), and Survival checks, and a +2 bonus on

Fortitude saves. At 5th level, the bonuses improve to +4.

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain a bonus feat. You

must meet the prerequisites for this feat. At the start of each

day, you can choose to change your bonus feat to any other

feat for which you meet the prerequisites.

Mimic Class Feature: At 3rd level, you gain the ability

to mimic a certain class feature possessed by other char-

acters. Once per day, you can use any of the class features

described  below.  At  6th  level,  you  can  use  this  ability

twice per day (either to mimic the same class feature on

two different occasions or two different class features

at separate times). At 9th level, you can use this ability

three times per day.

Evasion  (Ex):  As  an  immediate  action,  you

can  avoid  damage  from  certain  attacks  with

a successful Reex save. You can activate this

ability  after  you  have  rolled

a  successful  Reex  save,  but

before you have taken damage.

This  ability  lasts  for  1  minute.

See the monk class feature, page

41 of the Players Handbook.

Rage  (Ex):  You  can  y  into  a

screaming  blood  frenzy.  See  the

barbarian  class  feature,  page  25

of  the  Players  Handbook,  except

that the duration of the rage is 1

round + 1 round per point of your

(newly  improved)  Constitution

modier.

Smite (Ex): You can smite a foe with

a  normal  melee  attack.  You  add  your

Charisma  bonus  (if  any)  to  the  attack

roll and deal 1 extra point of damage per

class level. See the paladin smite evil class

feature, page 44 of the Players Handbook..

Sneak Attack (Ex): You can deal an extra

1d6 points of damage per three class levels

when  anking  an  opponent  or

any time the target would be

denied  its  Dexterity  bonus

(except on ranged attacks, which

must be point-blank to deliver the

extra damage). See the rogue class

feature, page 50 of the Players Hand-

book. Treat your rogue level as equal to your class level for

the purpose of defeating improved uncanny dodge.

Turn/Rebuke Undead (Su): You can turn or rebuke undead

creatures (your choice when activating the ability) by chan-

neling the power of your faith through a holy symbol. See

Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Players Handbook.

Treat your cleric level as equal to your class level.

Ability Boon (Ex): At 4th level, when choosing an apti-

tude focus, you also gain a +2 competence bonus to an ability

score of your choice. This bonus lasts until you change your

aptitude focus. At 7th level this bonus improves to +4, and

at 10th level to +6.

Double Aptitude (Ex): At 7th level, you can adopt two

aptitude  focuses  in  the  same  amount

of time it previously took for you to

adopt  one.  For  example,  you  could

adopt  both  the  combat  focus  and

the  wild  focus  to  mimic  a  ranger,

or the divine focus and arcane focus

to mimic a mystic theurge. You cant

adopt  the  same  aptitude  focus  twice

simultaneously.  You  can  still  only

adopt as many focuses per day as

indicated by your aptitude focus

ability.

Rapid  Refocus  (Ex):  At  8th

level, you gain the power to change your

aptitude focus in only 10 minutes.

PLAYING A CHAMELEON

Most  people  spend  their  lives  dened  by  a

single  class,  a  single  set  of  abilities.  Mages

curse  their  inability  to  wear  armor  and

wield  weapons.  Fighters  desperately  wish

they  had  magic.  Rogues  long  for  strength

to  go  with  their  guile,  and  priests  wonder

what it must be like to be stealthy. But not

you. You can become any of those classes,

any  time  you  want.  You  have  no  limits.

Some days you have magic, and other days

youre a erce warrior, a talented sneak, or

a clever hunter. Whatever you need to be,

you can become.

Every  chameleon  is  trained  at  the

School of Broad Horizons, also known

by  its  students  as  Mimic  Mansion.  In

many ways this school is a monastery,

a  reclusive  compound  where

teachers break students of old

habits and force them to rely

on  new  skills  and  abilities.

Even after you leave, you are not

free of the Mimic Mansion. Your

superiors  expect  you  to  report

in  regularly  on  your  activities.  Sometimes  they  require

you to undertake assignments for them, usually with no

explanation.  But  you  always  obey.  Really,  you  have  no

choiceyou owe everything to the school, and you know

it. Besides, you never know when someone nearby might

be  another  chameleon,  watching  you  and  reporting  on

your behavior.

Posing as a ghter, Jonata Q uimbel the chameleon

Combat

How you ght depends entirely on your persona for that

day. If youre playing a ghter or a paladin, you charge into

the fray, weapons drawn. As a barbarian, you usually race

around the edges, harrying opponents with your speed.

When youre a rogue, you sneak in and attack from behind.

As a spellcaster, youll probably stand back and use your

spells to their best advantage, though you may wade in with

your staff or mace after that. Given a choice (and time to

switch), youll choose whichever class your comrades most

needusually either a ghter or a spellcaster.

The worst combat situation for you is an ambush. You have

no time to prepare a ghting persona, so you have to make

do with your current role, whatever that is. Fortunately, you

always have your knowledge, skills, and your ability with

weapons. Arcane spellcasters dont use heavy weapons or

armor,  so  if  youre  properly  equipped  you  can  target  the

enemys mages and take them down quickly. And if you

have spells that day, no one expects you to suddenly draw a

sword and hack them down, which gives you the advantage

of surprise. You wear armor under your robes for just such

an occasion.

At higher levels, you can actually change your class in

the middle of the day. This gives you much more exibility,

knowing that you can expend all your resources in a given

ght  and  come  back  fully  recharged  after  a  brief  rest.

Imagine starting the day as a spellcaster, exhausting your

spells, and then switching to a ghterespecially if the

spells  you  selected  have  durations  that  extend  into  your

second aptitude.

Advancement

Chameleons  look  for  people  with  good  natural  abilities,

open minds, and a knack for performance. Once a potential

recruit is selected, they watch her for several days before

offering an invitation to a retreat. Chameleons only invite

those with a true desire for change, and those who have

the  mental  strength  to  focus  their  energies  to  tap  their

potential.

At the retreat, you and the other recruits meet several

chameleons who demonstrate their varied skills. Of course,

meeting someone who can cast spells but also claims she

is a ghter is not very convincing. But the next morning,

when that same person works up a barbarian rage or sneaks

up and steals your pouch, you begin to believe. Then the

chameleons offer you a choice. You can decline their offer

and return to your normal lifethe chameleons are only

passing  through  (local  chameleons  never  participate  in

the retreat), and you wont ever see them again. Or you can

embrace  your  destiny  and  travel  to  the  School  of  Broad

Horizons to begin your training.

Life at Mimic Mansion is not easy. The compound has

no luxuries, and you are forced to endure long days, harsh

conditions, and difcult assignments. To be a chameleon

requires mastery of the physical, mental, and spiritual, and

it forces you to look past frivolous desires and concentrate

on your real goal: to break free of your old mind-set. The

chameleons  teach  that  every  person  has  the  potential

to  become  a  member  of  every  classeveryone  can  cast

spells, everyone can walk through the woods unnoticed,

everyone can unleash a raging fury in battle or sneak up

on their enemies. But society teaches that each person can

only excel at one role. The chameleons shatter this notion.

They force you to realize the only thing stopping you from

doing everything, acquiring every talent, is your own lack

of belief. Once that barrier has been overcome, they teach

you to master each ability. But being a chameleon is more

than discovering you can cast spells and ght, rather than

one  or  the  other.  Using  each  ability  requires  the  right

mind-set, for you are not merely pretending to be a ghter

or wizard. When you channel those abilities, you actually

become  a  member  of  that  class  for  the  day.  Your  power

comes from that self-condence, and your acceptance of

a destiny greater than society would allowed.

You earn full chameleon status by passing a nal exam,

which involves masquerading in each of your many roles.

You simply need to convince someone that you are, in fact,

a member of a given class. Once you have persuaded a new

person for each class, you graduate from the mansion and

you are given a small tattoo of a chameleon in the space

between your rst and second nger. This identies you as

a chameleon, and allows you to prove your identity to other

chameleons you may meet.

After entering this class, you should always keep your

Bluff skill at the highest rank possible. This skill is para-

mount to chameleons, for obvious reasons. Disguise is also

useful, since sometimes you need to become a new person

when you change your skill set.

Several of the key skills required in pulling off a success-

ful impersonation of another class (such as Disable Device,

Open Lock, Handle Animal, and various Knowledge skills)

cant be used untrained, so a few ranks in each are vital.

Spellcraft is also importantit allows you to study spellcast-

ers and their methods, which means you can mimic them

more accurately.

Resources

Mimic  Mansion  provides  its  graduates  with  the  basics

for their transformations. These include armor, weapons,

thieves tools, a holy symbol (fake), and a spellbook (written

in gibberish). When sending someone out on a mission,

the school can provide additional resources if necessary.

It expects such items to be returned after the mission is

complete.

Chameleons are expected to be self-sufcient whenever

possible. They are also required to maintain the secrecy of

their class, and of the school, at all costsany chameleon

who is captured and interrogated is given up for dead by the

school. The best she can hope for is that another chameleon

will sneak in to kill her quickly.

CHAMELEONS IN THE WORLD

Chameleons  add  spice  and  intrigue  to  your  game.  They

are  unpredictable,  keeping  other  characters  guessing  as

to their true class, abilities, and motives. But chameleons

are also very useful to a party. They can cast spells, sneak,

ght, and even heal (to a degree), as the occasion requires.

Even so, Mimic Mansion has its own agenda, and this can

cause tension within a group, or get the entire party into

a sticky situation.

Organization

Every chameleon owes her allegiance to the Mimic Mansion

and its senior instructors, but most chameleons do not learn

the schools true purpose until after they graduate. Teaching

people to access their full potential is only a means to an

end. The schools real goal is to create an army of untrace-

able assassins, people who can become anyone and use any

abilities required to get the job done.

An assassin named Salazar founded the School of Broad

Horizons. Salazar was extremely effective, but he kept run-

ning up against situations that required stealth, spells, and

swords. If only I had all those abilities, he kept thinking,

thered be no stopping me. One day, Salazar heard about

a  monk  who  claimed  that  everyone  had  the  potential  to

become  anything  they  desired.  He  sought  out  the  holy

man, though it took years to nd him, and pretended to be a

humble man embittered by his lot in life. The monk, whose

name was Seng Li, believed Salazars lies and accepted him

as a student. After several years, Salazar nally mastered the

power to switch skill sets and access all the abilities he had

within himself. He then killed the monk and returned to

his home city.

But  Salazar  was  now  older,  and  no  longer  fast  enough

and  strong  enough  to  be  a  top  assassin.  So  he  selected

three  young  men,  each  displeased  with  his  place  in  life,

and  offered  to  train  them.  These  men  became  the  rst

chameleons,  and  Salazar  accepted  jobs  on  their  behalf.

Assignments were usually assassinations, but some were

robberies or information-gathering or even protection. With

the money from these jobs, Salazar built the compound and

sent his protgs out to nd more students. Thus the School

of Broad Horizons began.

Salazar still runs the school, though most of the students

know him only as Master Sallah and rarely see him. With

his senior trainers (his original students), he coordinates the

activities of graduates, and his agents pass along job offers

that he accepts or rejects based upon his own assessment.

When accepting a job, Salazar nds out what chameleons are

in the area, and assigns one the task. His agents then convey

instructions to the selected graduate, who is expected to

comply without question.

Chameleons  who  prove  their  loyalty  and  their  lack  of

scruples can become agents themselves. An agent handles a

particular city or region, establishing a permanent residence

to create a cover identity. She reports back to the school

every week, detailing not only her own activities but the

whereabouts and actions of every chameleon in the area.

Other chameleons report in to the agent when they arrive,

and then check back in before leaving.

An agent who demonstrates her worth may be offered a

position as trainer at the mansion or as a recruiter. Recruit-

ers wander from place to place, convening to hold retreats

whenever  an  agent  nds  a  potential  recruit.  If  a  recruit

seems worthy, she is escorted to Mimic Mansion to begin

her training. Trainers live in the compound and spend all

their time teaching new students.

Some chameleons react poorly to news of their schools

real  mission  and  refuse  to  handle  illegal  assignments.

Salazar has ways to force their compliance, but these tactics

sometimes fail, and a few chameleons have gone rogue. They

are actively hunted by agents and recruiters and targeted

for death on sight. Some of these rebels  wander the world,

using  their  talents  as  they  see  t  rather  than  as  Salazar

demands.

NPC Reactions

If a chameleon is doing her job efciently, NPC reactions are

based on the class she is mimicking and not on her nature

as a chameleon. If word gets out of an adventurer who can

carry a sword and shield one day and cast spells the next,

reactions change. Commoners, businessmen, and rogues

have an attitude of friendly, eager to hear stories about the

chameleons  versatility  (see  Inuencing  NPC  Attitudes,

page  72  of  the  Players  Handbook).  Fighters,  barbarians,

and rangers may feel the same, but also become annoyed

that  their  own  skills  are  so  easily  reproduced.  Sorcerers

and wizards are indifferent or unfriendly, believing that

true  magic  cannot  be  so  easily  acquired.  Clerics,  druids,

and paladins are unfriendly or hostile, actively seeking to

expose chameleons as frauds; they pretend to have divine

powers, which insults the gods and those who receive their

genuine favor.

CHAMELEON LORE

Characters with Knowledge (local) or both Gather Infor-

mation and Perform can research the Chameleons to learn

more about them. When a character makes a skill check,

read or paraphrase the following, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: Sometimes, people arent what they seem. And

some of them can seem to be anyone. Like a human cha-

meleon, they blend in.

DC 15: These people can masquerade as ghters, mages,

thievesanything.

DC  20:  Somehow  they  learn  to  mimic  each  classs

abilities, even spellcasting. And they all train at a school

somewhere.

DC 30: Sometimes, these chameleons just seem to be

traveling.  But  strange  deaths  or  burglaries  occur  when

theyre around. And, after all, whod make a better assassin

or thief than someone who can be anyone?

CHAMELEONS IN THE GAME

It is easy to bring a chameleon into your game, since they can

mimic the special abilities of any other class. Their ability

to switch class sets makes them versatile, even if they never

reach the full potential of any one class. At the same time,

chameleons can serve as spies, thieves, and assassins. They

could join any group that is moving toward their own goal,

both for company and for camouage.

Chameleons can be fun to play, because they let players

dabble  in  all  the  existing  classes  without  being  tied  to

one. The classs darker side also makes it fun to roleplay,

especially  if  the  character  has  qualms  about  her  assign-

ments and is considering quitting the organization. The

best way to make a chameleon character happy is for them

to be useful. Parties that have one member of every class

may  not  need  chameleons,  but  a  group  with  no  arcane

spellcasters and no rogues may be desperate for their skills.

Give them tasks that require changing skill sets, and make

sure assignments from Mimic Mansion occasionally arrive

to complicate matters.

Adaptation

Chameleons can be reworked as a completely nonmagical

class, where they have no spells but use Sleight of Hand to

make items disappear, and potions or powders to create

smoke, fog, and re. They could be made completely magical

as well or even psionic, using spells or psionics to actually

gain the abilities of other classes.

If youre using the EBERRON Campaign Setting, the chame-

leon prestige class should be available to changeling player

characters as well as humans and doppelgangers. In this

case, the Able Learner feat extends to changelings as well.

Encounters

Chameleons are most common in cities and larger towns.

They  watch  any  newcomers,  both  to  gauge  any  threats

and  to  examine  possible  new  recruits.  Chameleons  on  a

mission  can  go  anywhere,  from  the  richest  court  to  the

poorest hovel.

EL 6: The PCs enter a noisy bar, and the bartender gives

them the only available seatsat a table with a nondescript

stranger. She inquires about their recent travels, and offers

to trade information about the road. The PCs cannot tell if

she is a ghter, a rogue, a priest, or even a spellcaster.

Languages: Common, Elven, Celestial.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Jonata does an extra 3d6 extra points

of damage on any successful attack against at-footed or

anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies

to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Crea-

tures  with  concealment,  creatures  without  discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Jonata may

choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack,

but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Aptitude Focus (Ex): Once per day, Jonata can select

one  of  ve  areas  upon  which  to  focus  her  ever-shifting

talents. After meditating for 1 hour, she gains the noted

abilities  for  24  hours  or  until  she  changes  her  aptitude

focus. Jonata currently has adopted combat focus, provid-

ing prociency in all martial weapons, a +2 competence

bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, and a +2

bonus on Fortitude saves (included). See the chameleon

class description for details.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Jonata  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Trapnding  (Ex):  Jonata  can  nd,  disarm,  or  bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Jonata  retains  her  Dexterity

bonus to AC even when at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe  (she  still  loses  his  Dexterity  bonus  if  paralyzed  or

otherwise immobile).

LOREDELVER

I think of myself as a liberator. Its my job to liberate the ancient

lorenot to mention the vast wealththat has been imprisoned

by history.

Stormwind Vaora, loredelver

Loredelvers are illumian spellcasters who nd and explore

ruins,  disable  the  magical  protections  that  guard  them,

and  sift  through  the  ancient  secrets  found  within.  They

rarely spend time in the enclaves of the illumians, instead

crisscrossing the world in search of archaic lore for their

cabals library.

BECOMING A LOREDELVER

Most  characters  become  loredelvers  after  taking  at  least

ve levels of wizard and one or two levels of rogue. A few

sorcerers wind up in the class, but they need to take extra

levels in the rogue class to gain the requisite skill ranks.

Bards who lean toward exploration and discovery sometimes

enter this class after picking up a level of rogue, but give up

signicant bardic abilities to do so.

Entry Requirements

Race: Illumian.

Skills: Decipher Script 10 ranks; Disable Device 5 ranks;

Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks; Knowledge (dungeoneering)

5 ranks.

Spells or Spell Like Abilities: Ability to cast at least one 3rd-

level arcane spell from the divination school.

Special: Trapfinding class feature.

CLASS FEATURES

As a loredelver, your class features relate to your core mis-

sion of exploring tombs, ruins, and forgotten sites looking

for ancient manuscripts and other lore. Your spellcasting

ability continues to advance at nearly its full rate, bolstered

by a few spell-like class abilities that augment your ability

to nd magical auras and defeat traps.

Spells  per  Day:  At  each  level  after  1st,  you  gain  new

spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had

also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which

you  belonged  before  adding  the  prestige  class  level.  You

do not, however, gain any other benet a character of that

class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane

spellcasting class before becoming a loredelver, you must

decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of

determining spells per day and spells known.

Bardic Knowledge (Ex): Loredelvers extensively study

the reports of their fellow loredelvers as well as historical

and magical texts. You can attempt to recall some relevant

piece of information about local notable people, legendary

items, or noteworthy places. See the bard class feature, page

29 of the Players Handbook. You use your loredelver level +

your Intelligence modier (plus levels in bard, if any) to

make bardic knowledge checks.

Magical  Insight  (Ex):  A  loredelver  has  an  uncanny

insight into the workings of magic. You gain a +5 insight

bonus on Spellcraft checks made to determine the school

of magic of magical auras.

Detect Magic (Sp): A loredelver develops a preternatural

sense for the presence of magic. At 2nd level and higher,

you can use detect magic (as the spell, page 219 of the Players

Handbook) at will.

Evasion (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you have a hair-

trigger sense of dangerous magic. If you are exposed to any

effect that normally allows you to attempt a Reex saving

throw for half damage, you take no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Spontaneous Casting (Su): At 4th level, you gain the

ability to spontaneously cast certain spells using your exist-

ing arcane spell slots. You can lose any prepared spell or

spell slot of the designated level to cast a specic spell. You

use your highest arcane caster level as the caster level for

the spell.

At 4th level and higher, you can lose any prepared spell

or spell slot of 2nd level or higher to cast knock (see page 246

of the Players Handbook).

At 7th level and higher, you can lose any prepared spell

or spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast arcane eye (see page

200 of the Players Handbook).

At 10th level, you can lose any prepared spell or spell

slot of 6th level or higher to cast greater dispel magic (ss page

223 of the Players Handbook).

Fearless  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  you  have  learned  to  steel

yourself  against  the  horrors  that  guard  the  places  youre

exploring.  You  gain  immunity  to  fear,  magical  or  other-

wise.

Arcane Sight (Sp): By the time you reach 6th level, you

have honed your sensitivity to the magical auras that sur-

round you. You can use arcane sight (as the spell, page 201

of the Players Handbook) at will.

Improved  Evasion  (Ex):  Beginning  at  8th  level,  you

can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful

Reex save and take only half damage on a failed save. See

the monk class feature, page 42 of the Players Handbook.

Greater Arcane Sight (Su): At 9th level, you have reached

the  pinnacle  of  magical  sensitivity.  You  can  use  greater

arcane sight (as the spell, page 201 of the Players Handbook)

at will.

PLAYING A LOREDELVER

You have left behind your cabalperhaps foreverfor the

thrill of walking where no one has stepped for thousands

of years. You relish the challenge of breaking into ancient

sites that have kept their secrets for centuries.

But you arent just a tomb robber. Your cabal has trained

you in esoteric techniques that help you overcome magi-

cal defenses. In exchange, you deliver to them the ancient

tomes you recover, as well as your own journals about your

adventures. Any treasure you recover that isnt of academic

interest to the cabal is yours to keep.

Combat

Like  other  spellcasters,  you  rely  almost  entirely  on  your

magic in a ght. Becoming a loredelver doesnt slow down

your spellcasting progress too much, so you should have

potent offensive and defensive spells at your disposal.

But  your  spellcasting  cant  always  mask  your  below-

average  hit  points  and  unfamiliarity  with  weapons,  so

youll often resort to the tried-and-true spellcaster defense:

befriending a ghter to stand in front of you.

At higher levels, your loredelver class features can provide

an edge in combat. Arcane eye is a great reconnaissance tool

that can make sure you gain the advantages of good terrain

and preght preparation. Arcane sight lets you identify which

enemies  are  beneting  from  magical  effects.  When  you

reach 10th level, your ability to spontaneously cast greater

dispel magic makes you an effective counter for an enemy

spellcaster or a front-line ghter overloaded with magical

effects.

Its also a class with a built-in excuse to adventure. Illu-

mian cabals know the locations of dungeons, ancient ruins,

and  other  sites  rich  with  adventuring  possibilities.  The

loredelver does the dangerous work, and the cabal provides

support and further opportunities to explore.

Advancement

When cabals choose members to undergo loredelver

training,  they  usually  look  for  a  combination  of

spellcasting prowess and enough physical condition-

ing to survive the rigors of travel and combat. But the

most important attribute is a relentless curiosity,

which manifests itself in the desire to explore

every lost ruin and forgotten crypt the world

has to offer.

Once  your  cabal  assigns  you  to  loredelver

duty, you begin looking at your surroundings

in a new light. After poring over countless

diagrams of poison needle launchers, deadfall

snares,  and  camouaged  pits,  youre  always

scanning  walls,  oors,  and  ceilings  for  the

kinds of traps youve read about. You start to

see ickers of magical auras, even when you

dont have detect magic active.

As  you  advance,  youll  probably  develop  a

bigger spellbook than a typical wizard. Like

any loredelver worth his salt, you copy any

useful spells from the treasure troves you

uncover before turning over your loot

to your cabal.

Resources

Organization

Loredelvers  dont  have  a  strong  organization  among

themselves; they work at the behest of the cabal

that  trained  them.  The  specics  of  loredelver

training have spread to most illumian cabals, so

any cabal that wants a loredelver needs only

nd a worthy candidate, provide training, then

send him out into the world with a map.

Many cabals have a directorate devoted

to  loredelving,  called  the  acquisitions

directorate.  While  not  every  member

of  the  directorate  is  a  loredelver,  the

directorates  expedition  leaders  and

elite  agents  usually  include  a  high

number of loredelvers. Quill cabals

in particular are rife with loredelv-

ers,  and  many  illumian  children

aspire to positions in the acquisi-

tions directorate.

A  loredelver  is  almost

always  on  the  road  tracking

down lost lore for the cabal,

tarrying  at  the  enclave

only long enough to heal,

train, and plan the next

expedition.

Because  your  travels  are

ostensibly  in  service  to

your  cabal,  its  librar-

ians and researchers

are  at  your  dis-

posal.  They  can

point  you  toward

ancient  dungeons

and warn you about

possible traps men-

tioned  in  historical

texts. And when you

turn  over  the  tomes  you  nd

and  the  journals  you  keep  during  your

travels,  cabal  researchers  might  nd  clues

in  them  that  send  you  on  to  even  more  thrillingand

lucrativeadventures.

LOREDELVERS IN THE WORLD

The loredelver prestige class is a good t for a spellcaster

who wants to use magic to perform roguelike functions in

the party, such as providing reconnaissance, opening locks,

and disabling dangerous traps.

Loredelvers from

different  cabals

rarely  congregate,

because  at  least  to

a  degree  theyre

all  rivals  for  the

same  lore.  But

every  loredelver

keeps  a  journal  of

his travels, and those

journals  eventually  nd

their  way  into  the  cabals

library.  Cabals  trade  or  borrow

books  with  other  friendly  cabals,  and

loredelver  journals  are  a  prized  part  of

such exchanges. When one loredelver makes annotations

in another loredelvers journal, it can mark the beginning

of a lively and informative correspondence. Two loredelv-

ers who have never met might use journal annotations to

argue about the meaning of a particular rune in ancient

High Draconic. But they wouldnt  necessarily  recognize

each other if they were imprisoned together by the same

angry dragon.

A loredelver takes danger in stride

and sometimes strides right over it

119

Perhaps the most famous journals are those of Inkwell

Carvin, a loredelver whose exploits are legendary among

illumians.  Carvin  single-handedly  braved  the  ziggurat

of Thelm, the Moaning Caves, and Otralaks Tower in his

quest to retrieve the dispersed parts of the Library of the

Sublime. Five years ago, Carvin stopped checking in with

the Inkwell cabal, and many loredelvers suspect he has been

killed or captured by the githyanki.

Loredelvers can rise through the ranks of their directorate

like any illumian, although few reach leadership positions

because  theyre  far  too  often  absent  to  play  the  political

games needed for high-level promotion. Political consid-

erations aside, most acquisitions directorates function as

meritocracies: The more you bring back for the library, the

better your chances of promotion.

NPC Reactions

Loredelvers  engender  a  mixture  of  adulation  and  envy

when they visit the enclave of their cabal. In general, cabal

members have an initial attitude of friendly toward them

(see  Inuencing  NPC  Attitudes,  page  72  of  the  Players

Handbook). If a political struggle is under way, either in the

acquisitions directorate or the cabal as a whole, then the

sudden arrival of a loredelver is less welcome, but attitudes

rarely drift to worse than indifferent. Attitudes also reect

indifference if a loredelver returns to a cabal that has fallen

on hard times during his absence; the cabal resents that the

loredelver was off on exciting adventures while the rest of

the cabal was dealing with encroaching famine and attacks

by foe after foe.

Loredelvers need to tread carefully when it comes to the

nonlore treasure they collect from the dungeons and ruins

they explore. Most cabals expect loredelvers to turn over

information, not treasure, and they assume that loredelvers

use their wealth to buy protective items, pay for colleagues

(often nonillumian PCs), and otherwise make themselves

more  effective  loredelvers.  But  a  loredelver  who  comes

back from a mission dripping with gold and jewels should

be prepared for the cabals reaction. In general, aunting

wealth from a mission earns a loredelver a 4 circumstance

penalty on interactions with most cabal members and a +4

circumstance bonus on interactions with the cabals youth

and other would-be loredelvers.

LOREDELVER LORE

Characters  with  Knowledge  (history)  can  research  indi-

vidual  loredelvers  to  learn  more  about  them.  (While

loredelvers arent historical personages themselves, theyre

known among historians for the data they provide.) When

a character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the fol-

lowing, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Loredelver is a term the illumians use to describe

their archeologists.

DC 15: Loredelvers are illumian spellcasters who spe-

cialize in breaking into tombs and ancient places, looking

for old manuscripts, spellbooks, and other items for their

libraries.

DC  20:  The  loredelvers  are  trying  to  track  down  the

thousands of books that the illumians lost when the githy-

anki sacked their library.

Additionally, loredelvers appear frequently in the tales

told  by  bards.  Bardic  knowledge  checks  for  information

about loredelvers reduce the DC of the check by 5.

LOREDELVERS IN THE GAME

Because theyre beyond the day-to-day reach of their cabals,

loredelver  PCs  are  easy  to  work  into  an  ongoing  game.

Simply arrange for a loredelver to visit his cabals enclave

from  time  to  time,  perhaps  to  have  researchers  study  a

mysterious map or translate the inscription the PCs found

in a tomb somewhere.

If  you  have  a  loredelver  at  your  table,  make  sure  you

provide magic traps for him to nd and disable. Loredelvers

love site-based adventures such as treks into ancient ruins

and dungeons. At higher levels, you can provide challenges

that a loredelver can overcome with his class features, such

as  encounters  that  depend  on  noticing  magical  auras  (a

disguised villain or a room hidden by illusion) and lots of

dangerous magic to dispel.

Loredelvers also provide a useful adventure hook even

if  none  of  the  PCs  are  interested  in  the  prestige  class.

Loredelvers may hire PCs to act as expedition guards or do

a preliminary exploration of a ruin in a loredelvers absence.

If the PCs nd a loredelvers journal, theyll have enough

clues for a dozen adventures in their hands.

Adaptation

While  the  loredelver  lls  an  important  role  in  illumian

culture, you can adapt the class to other groups that have

an interest in ancient lore. The prestige class is a natural for

any secret society with spellcasters who want to break into

magically guarded places.

Encounters

If  the  PCs  encounter  a  loredelver  in  the  middle  of  an

adventure, the loredelver almost always represents a rival

who is intent on exploring the same site as the PCs. To put

a classic twist on the rivalry, establish the loredelver as an

antagonist and then introduce a powerful monster or other

threat to both the PCs and the loredelver. The PCs might

want to make a temporary alliance with the loredelver, but

both sides should be alert for a double-cross.

EL 9: Newsun Ralouf is a novice loredelver exploring in

the company of two jann who have promised to lead him

to great wealth nearby. Ralouf has already cast mage armor

and darkvision; his statistics below reect this.

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to

ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures

with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits

are  all  immune  to  sneak  attacks.  Ralouf  may  choose  to

deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only

when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a

sap (blackjack).

himself also affect his familiar if the latter is within 5 feet

at the time. He may also cast a spell a target of You on his

familiar.

Glyphic Resonance (Ex): As an illumian, Ralouf inter-

acts strangely with symbol-based spells. See the illumian

racial description, page 53, for details.

Illumian  Word  (Su):  Raloufs  combination  of  power

sigils  provides  him  with  the  naenkrau  illumian  word.

During the time when he prepares his spells, he may choose

DCs of all his other spells of that level. He may leave up to

two spell slots unlled, and multiple unlled slots dont

stack.

Luminous  Sigils  (Su):  The  supernatural  sigils  that

orbit Raloufs head provide illumination equal to that of

a candle. He can make these sigils disappear as a standard

action, but loses the sigils benets and cant use any special

abilities granted by power sigils or his illumian word while

theyre doused. Restoring the sigils to visibility is a free

action.

Power Sigils (Su): Raloufs krau power sigil grants a +2

bonus to Raloufs caster level (included). His naen power

sigil grants a +2 bonus on Intelligence checks and all Intel-

ligence-based skill checks (included).

on saves against spells with the shadow descriptor.

Trapnding  (Ex):  Ralouf  can  nd,  disarm,  or  bypass

traps  with  a  DC  of  20  or  higher.  He  can  use  the  Search

skill to nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Glyphic Resonance (Ex): As an illumian, Vaora interacts

strangely with symbol-based spells. See the illumian racial

description, page 53, for details.

Illumian Word (Su): Vaoras combination of power sigils

provides her with the naenkrau illumian word. During the

time when she prepares her spells, she may choose to leave

a spell slot unlled in order to add 1 to the save DCs of all

her other spells of that level (including spells from other

classes). She may leave up to two spell slots unlled, and

multiple unlled slots dont stack.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Vaora is exposed to any effect

that normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Luminous Sigils (Su): The supernatural sigils that orbit

Vaoras head provide illumination equal to that of a candle.

She can make these sigils disappear as a standard action, but

loses the sigils benets and cant use any special abilities

granted by power sigils or her illumian word while theyre

doused. Restoring the sigils to visibility is a free action.

Power Sigils (Su): Vaoras krau power sigil grants a +2

MENACING BRUTE

I wouldnt draw that sword if I was you.

Wogar, menacing brute

Life as a half-orc in a human city is never easy, and some

half-orcs are driven to desperation by the struggle of living

in a place where one is never truly welcome. The menacing

brute takes advantage of how most humans fear half-orcs,

playing  on  that  dread  to  make  his  living.  He  combines

resourcefulness and determination with a ready wit and

the willingness to do jobs that others nd distastefuland

do them well.

BECOMING A MENACING BRUTE

Menacing brutes typically combine levels of ghter with

one or two levels of rogue. Fighter levels are essential for

bringing the brutes base attack bonus to a respectable level,

while brutes enjoy adding a little sneak attack damage to

their rst solid hits in melee. Rogue levels are not neces-

sary, but they can help a half-orc who is not exceptionally

intelligent meet the skill prerequisites for the class.

CLASS FEATURES

The menacing brutes class features focus on making you an

intimidating presence on the battleeld. You can demoral-

ize your opponents with a stare and strike terror into their

hearts as you slay their companions.

Demoralizing Stare (Ex): You gain a competence bonus

on Intimidate checks equal to your menacing brute level.

In addition, when you successfully use the Intimidate skill

to demoralize an opponent, the target remains shaken for

an additional 1 round per class level.

Resourceful Search (Ex): At 2nd level, you become

extremely  resourceful  at  nding  discarded  pieces  of

equipment. Once per day, you can attempt a Search check

in order to nd any nonmagical item of your choice, with

a maximum market price of 200 gp, without paying for

it. The gold piece value of the item determines the time

it takes for you to nd it, as well as the minimum size of

community in which it can be found (see the table below).

For example, if you are searching for a wagon (35 gp), you

would need to look in a small town or larger community

and  succeed  on  a  DC  15  Search  check  after  spending

2d410 minutes searching. If you sought a breastplate (200

gp), you could nd it in a metropolis by making a DC 25

Search check and spending 2d4 hours digging through

alleyways, trash bins, and the like. You can never nd a

masterwork item or magic item of any value while using

this ability.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you deal extra

damage when anking an opponent or any time the target

would  be  denied  its  Dexterity  bonus  (except  on  ranged

attacks,  which  must  be  point-blank  to  deliver  the  extra

damage). See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Players

Handbook.

Ruthless Cut (Ex): At 4th level and higher, you gain a

+4 bonus on a roll to conrm a threat on a critical hit.

Making an Example (Ex): At 5th level, any time you

deal enough damage with a melee attack to drop a creature

(typically by dropping it to less than 0 hit points or killing

it), all foes within 30 feet of the enemy must succeed on

a  Will  save  (DC  15  +  your  Cha  modier)  or  cower  until

the start of their next turn. If the blow that dropped the

creature was a critical hit, add +4 to the save DC. This is a

mind-affecting fear effect.

it, so much the better. Your class name says it allyoure

accustomed to using your muscle to get your way. You lean

on the recalcitrant, squash the rebellious, and murder the

opposition.  Nothing  gets  between  you  and  getting  a  job

done.

You  are  probably  a  member  of  some  illegal  (or  at  least

shady) organization that employs you for your particular

combination of skills. This organization might be a crime

gang, a casino or similar business where you help maintain

order,  or  simply  a  rich  patron  with  his  ngers  in  a  few

unscrupulous  operations.  In  exchange  for  doing  your

employers  dirty  work,  you  earn  a  degree  of  respect  and

prestige  within  the  organizationnobody  else  wants  to

do your job. Most people are afraid of you, so its easy to

intimidate the petty thieves and con artists in your organiza-

tion. You have some freedom to pursue other opportunities

when your services arent needed, which leaves you open to

adventurethough usually youre expected to stay close to

your organizations base of operations.

Combat

As a bully, youre happier leaning on opponents to get your

way than you are actually wading into a fair ght. You use

your Intimidate skill to make sure your enemies arent at

their best when facing you. Once combat starts in earnest,

take every opportunity to ank your enemies for the extra

sneak  attack  damage.  That  said,  youre  just  as  good  in

straight-up melee as any other ghter, so theres no reason

to hang back or slink around in the shadows. Your style is

blunt and direct, and that applies in combat as well as in

conversation. Hit your foes hard enough, and they wont

hit back.

Youre  at  your  best  when  your  side  outnumbers  your

opponents. Other thugs can help you ank your enemies,

and  if  they  have  the  sneak  attack  ability  too,  youll  put

anked enemies down quickly. Once you reach 5th level,

you can sometimes end a combat quickly by dispatching

one opponent early on and making the rest cower. Cowering

creatures lose their Dexterity bonus, so theyre susceptible

to sneak attacks from your allies, anking or no anking.

Once the rst one falls, the others quickly follow.

in the prestige class, and you might drift from employer to

employer as the need for your services changes. You might

be a full-time freelancer, taking odd jobs of a particularly

violent  sort  as  they  come  up,  and  lling  gaps  in  your

schedule with more traditional adventuring. At all times,

you  continue  to  practice  the  basic  tools  of  your  trade:

intimidation and brutality.

As  you  gain  levels,  you  have  a  good  number  of  skill

points to spend (perhaps even if you have an Intelligence

penalty) and some exibility about how to spend them. Most

menacing brutes spend skill points on Intimidate at every

level, making them exceptionally good at that particular

skill. Even if you dont buy Intimidate at every level, your

competency doesnt suffer much, thanks to your demoral-

izing stare ability. Whichever approach to Intimidate you

choose, consider increasing your ability further with the

Menacing Demeanor feat (see page 153). Your skill and feat

choices depend on the kinds of jobs you typically pursue.

If keeping an ear to the street is important, buy ranks in

Gather  Information  and  Knowledge  (local).  If  stealth  is

more important, consider buying ranks in Hide and Move

Silently as cross-class skills.

Resources

One  of  your  dening  characteristics  is  the  ingenuity

reected in your resourceful search class ability. You are

supposed  to  be  self-reliant  and  have  the  wherewithal  to

acquire what you need to do your job properly. At the same

time, you are either a member of a powerful organization or

the employee of a powerful individual, and the organization

or the employer has resources that can help you accomplish

the tasks set before you. To a certain extent, your resource-

ful search ability reects the resources available by virtue

of your position. When you need more valuable gear than

you can scrounge using that ability, you might still be able

to gain some benet from your organization or employer.

If youre willing to carry and use stolen goods that could

land  you  in  (more)  trouble,  you  can  acquire  most  gear

(mundane or magical) for 90% of its market price. Unless

youre willing to go into full-time work as a fence, you are

limited to one signicant purchase of this sort per month

of game time.

Advancement

You probably started on the road to becoming a menacing

brute early in life, guring that being big and strong gave

you an edge. Before long, someone else recognized your

strength and your ability to intimidate your foes as well as

your resourcefulness and wit and offered you a job. Many

people would have balked at that job, whether it involved

extortion or murder, but you grabbed the opportunity and

proved your worth.

Now  that  you  can  ofcially  call  yourself  a  menacing

brute (though youve probably been one all your adult life),

you continue in the same sort of work. Your employment

advancement is not necessarily tied to your advancement

MENACING BRUTES IN THE WORLD

Menacing brutes ll a role common in urban crime stories:

the thug who leans on people until they come around to the

criminal masterminds way of thinking. Menacing brutes

might appear in any campaign where organized crime exists,

whether it takes the form of a small local thieves guild or

a  larger  organization  dedicated  to  fear  and  intimidation

for prot.

Organization

Menacing  brutes  nd  work  in  a  tremendous  variety  of

merely shady. By their nature, menacing brutes are rarely

an integral part of such organizations. They are freelancers,

called in to deal with specic troublesome situations, and

they are most effective when close ties to the structures of

power do not hinder them. A menacing brutes job might

involve  extorting  protection  money  from  local  busi-

nesses, breaking up ghts, kicking out rowdies, standing

behind his employer to look intimidating, acting

as a bodyguard, destroying property, or killing

competitors and enemies.

NPC Reactions

A  menacing  brute  wields  the  power  he

does  precisely  because  others  fear

him. Playing on the innate fear that

half-orcs inspire just happens to be

the  brutes  stock  in  trade.  Most

NPCs  have  an  initial  reaction

of unfriendly toward a menac-

ing  brute,  though  the  brutes

Intimidate  skill  often  makes

them behave friendly (see Inu-

encing NPC Attitudes, page 72

of the Players Handbook).

Members  of  law  enforce-

ment  organizations,  as  well  as

people whom a brute has previ-

ously  intimidated,  are  usually

hostile toward a menacing brute.

Other  criminals  are  indifferent

to  friendly,  depending  on  their

relationship  to  the  brute

and his organization. Few

people are helpful.

MENACING

BRUTE LORE

Characters  with

Knowledge  (local)  can

research menacing brutes

or the organizations they work

for  to  learn  more  about  them.

When  a  character  makes  a  skill

check,  read  or  paraphrase  the  fol-

lowing,  including  the  information  from

lower DCs.

DC 10: Some half-orcs thrive on fear and

use intimidation to get their way.

DC  15:  Certain  half-orcs  are  particularly  skilled  at

intimidation and work as enforcers for criminal organiza-

tions. This check result also reveals a basic sketch of the

organization and the kinds of activities it is involved in.

DC 20: More details about the organization: the areas

where it is strongest, specic locations where members are

commonly seen, and so on.

A DC 20 Gather Information check can allow a character

to arrange a meeting with an NPC menacing brute.

MENACING BRUTES IN THE GAME

Menacing brutes probably already exist in your campaign,

whether they have this prestige class or not. If the players

in your campaign have any interaction with an illegal or

shady organization, sending a menacing brute to lean on

them can be a logical extension of that interaction. (Since

PCs are not particularly vulnerable to intimidation,

a higher-level menacing brute works better as an

NPC opponent than one with a single level in the

prestige class.)

If your campaign is not strongly

oriented toward the PCs as cham-

pions of good arrayed against the

forces of evil, a player character

could  become  a  menacing

brute. The class

works best in

a  campaign

focused  on

activity  in  an

urban  center,

and the player will

be happiest if there

is  ample  opportunity

for  interaction  with  NPCs  (rather

than monsters). Even so, theres no

reason why a menacing brute cant

wander into a dungeon from time

to time.

Adaptation

The  menacing  brute  is  a  fairly

generic class and should require

little  adaptation

to  use  in  any

campaign. You

could use it without

alteration in any evil or

criminal organiza-

tion,  such  as  the

Zhentarim in Toril

or the Order of the Emerald Claw in

Eberron. (Eberrons dragonmarked

mercantile  houses  undoubtedly

make use of menacing brutes as well, though they are more

likely to disavow all knowledge of their activities.)

You might choose to signicantly alter the class by open-

ing it to races other than half-orcs. The class is designed

to expand a particular aspect of the half-orc mind-set: the

realization that humans fear half-orcs, and a savvy half-orc

can exploit that fear for personal gain. If you open the class

to other races, you might add an additional feat requirement,

Encounters

Most  encounters  with  menacing  brutes  devolve  quickly

into combat.

the PCs into some course of action desired by the villains

in the campaign. He tries to use Intimidate to get his way,

but if that fails he resorts to his ail while attempting to

ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures

with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits

OUTCAST CHAMPION

We  are  not  half-humans,  inferior  to  you  by  virtue  of  sharing

only half your blood. We are a race of our own, and we will not

lay down our swords until we are a nation of our own, masters

of our own destiny.

Ethirindel, Crown Prince of Everyn

Outcast champions bring hope to those who have no place

in society. They lead by example, but their methods differ

widely. Some outcast champions unite under the banner of

freedom and dignity, while others stir their charges with

talk  of  rightful  conquest  of  their  oppressors.  While  one

outcast champion might employ stealth and subtle measures

to achieve his goals, another announces his intentions with

a bloody sword held aloft.

BECOMING AN

OUTCAST CHAMPION

Almost any half-human character can qualify as an outcast

champion by 5th level. Paladins, ghters, bards, and rogues

are the most common outcast champions, due to the classs

focus on martial leadership. Even the occasional barbarian

or monk nds cause to rally his comrades and take up arms

against oppressive regimes.

Entry Requirements

Race: Half-elf, half-orc, or half-ogre.

CLASS FEATURES

The outcast champions class features focus on working with

a small group of allies against overwhelming odds.

Aura  of  Condence  (Ex):  Your  presence  emboldens

allies within 30 feet who can see you (including yourself).

They add your class level as a morale bonus on their Will

saves. This effect is lost if you fall unconscious or die.

Avenging Strike (Ex): You are surrounded by allies who

rely on you for victory, and you take this responsibility to

heart. You can attempt an avenging strike on an enemy who

has dealt damage to an ally of yours within the last hour. The

avenging strike must be delivered with a melee attack. You

add your Charisma modier (if positive) to your attack roll

and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage per outcast champion

level. If you accidentally strike a creature that has not dealt

damage to an ally within the last hour, the avenging strike

has no effect, but that use of the ability is still expended.

You may use an avenging strike once per day per point of

Charisma bonus (minimum 1/day).

Desperate Fury (Ex): You are at your best when times

are worst. Beginning at 3rd level, once per day when you

are reduced to fewer than one-half your full normal hit

points, or when you are fatigued or exhausted, you can

enter a state of desperate fury. While in a desperate fury,

you gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and

Constitution.  The  desperate  fury  lasts  for  3  rounds  +  1

round per point of your (newly improved) Constitution

bonus. Unlike with a barbarians rage, you have no penal-

ties or limitations while in a desperate fury; however, if you

become frightened, panicked, or cowering, the desperate

fury ends immediately.

At 5th level, you become able to share the effect of your

desperate fury with allies within 30 feet who can see you.

These allies gain the same benets as you for as long as your

desperate  fury  lasts  (even  if  an  ally  becomes  frightened,

panicked, or cowering).

Teamwork (Ex): You are skilled at creating a strong bond

of  teamwork  between  yourself  and  your  allies.  Starting

at 4th level, whenever you or any ally within 30 feet who

can see or hear you uses the aid another action, the bonus

provided on attack rolls, AC, or skill checks improves by 2

(from +2 to +4).

PLAYING AN OUTCAST CHAMPION

If you have taken up the role of an outcast champion, the

plight of your people is the most important factor in your

world. Their suffering goads you to action, and the prospect

of their freedom makes all your troubles seem worthwhile.

To others, you might seem obsessed, and your intensity puts

people off. But their opinions dont matter to youall that

matters is the struggle to bring hope to the hopeless.

As an outcast champion, you might be the leader of an

organization dedicated to the freedom of a certain group of

half-elves, half-orcs, half-ogres, or some other marginalized

and oppressed people. If you are not the leader, you hold a

position of authorityusually a military position, but that

may depend on your background and expertise. As the name

of the class suggests, outcast champions are never minor

functionaries  or  behind-the-scenes  players.  You  stand  as

an exemplar of your race and your cause.

the foes who are dealing the most damage to you or your

allies. Try to draw enemy reyou should have enough

hit points to soak up damage for a while, and when you

become sorely wounded, you only become more fearsome

(and  receive  an  extra  store  of  hit  points)  thanks  to  your

desperate fury ability.

You should also take the initiative to coordinate your

allies in the battle. They look to you as a leader, and you

feel a sense of responsibility for keeping them alive. Make

sure they stay within 30 feet of you, so that they benet

from  the  effect  of  your  aura  of  confidence,  teamwork,

and  (once  you  reach  5th  level)  desperate  fury  abilities.

If members of the party are having trouble hitting their

opponents, instruct them to use the aid another actiona

+4 bonus on a characters attack or AC is far more useful

than a failed attack.

Advancement

Maybe you chose the role of an outcast champion, but it is

equally possible that it chose youor, more specically,

that  the  members  of  the  community  you  support  have

chosen you to represent them and lead their struggle for

freedom  and  justice.  You  have  at  least  a  nugget  of  true

leadership potential, reected in your interaction skills. You

can inspire people to do what you want them to do, either

through  diplomatic  persuasion  or  through  intimidating

coercion. Desperate people are always looking for leaders

or saviors, and you have the ability to back up your words

with actions.

Your  advancement  as  an  outcast  champion  is  not  so

much about training as it is about developing your natural

talents and strengthening the bond that connects you to

your community. Your early abilities involve forging your

own resolve and tempering your fury into a weapon. Your

condence inspires others, and eventually your desperate

fury does the same. By 4th level, you broaden your focus to

include a real sense of leadership.

It is a good idea to expand your skills as you advance in

this class. If you met the entry requirements with ranks

in Diplomacy, then put points in Intimidate, or vice versa.

Having multiple options for how you manage people can

be useful. Of course, its never a bad idea to stick with your

strengths as well, increasing your ranks in the skill that

got you into the class in the rst place. The Leadership feat

(if your DM allows it) can be a good way to develop your

position within your community, allowing you to marshal

followers to help your cause.

Combat

Resources

Your place in a battle is usually leading from the front. Your

class features work best when you are in melee with your

allies close at hand. Your attack bonus and hit points are as

good as a ghters, and you probably have the weapon and

armor prociencies to stand toe to toe with your enemies.

Use your avenging strike to concentrate on taking down

Almost by denition, the members of your community have

little in the way of material resources to assist your struggle

for their liberation. That said, you can always rely on their

hospitality, such as it is: A bed of straw and a cold replace

might be all they have to offer, but as their champion, you

are always welcome to whatever they have.

Your  community  can  provide  much  more  than  mate-

rial goods. When the law comes looking for you, you can

count on a hiding place in a barn or shed. When you need

to sneak into the city to raid the barons manor, you can

hide in a barrel on the vintners cart or among the sheep

being  brought  to  market.  Your  companions  can  usually

benet from such favors as well, assuming they share in

your struggle on behalf of the dispossessed.

structure at all. An outcast champion might claim some

rank or title, or their community might bestow one on

him (Champion being a common title of this nature),

but that rank rarely has signicance beyond the renown

that the champion earns through his actions. Some outcast

champions style themselves kings or princes, but such

titles are more expressions of hopeful anticipation than

of political reality.

OUTCAST CHAMPIONS

IN THE WORLD

The  outcast  champion  is  not  an  isolated  characterhe

embodies  social  forces  in  the  campaign.  If  dispossessed

half-elves or a half-orc underclass exists in your campaign,

then the outcast champion should be available to rally these

oppressed communities.

Organization

Outcast champions are not organized into a single group, but

by their nature they are part of organizations or movements.

An outcast champion might never interact with another

member of the same prestige class, but he is responsible to a

community, the group of outcast half-humans he represents

and for whose liberation he ghts.

An  outcast  champion  stands  as  the  representative  of  a

popular uprising or movement for change. If he is not the

leader in fact, he might be in charge of a groups military

affairs or defenses. An outcast champion has a specialized

role within his organization. He is more likely to lead a raid

on the treasury where the taxes are stored than to lobby for

change in the city council chamber, and would rather hunt

down a ruthless sheriff who slaughtered a half-orc family

than petition the baron for justice in the case. Even if some

members of the organization work for change in political

or diplomatic ways, the typical outcast champion prefers a

more active role.

For  outcast  champions,  the  struggle  of  their  people  is

integral  to  their  lives.  It  motivates  every  adventure  and

consumes  every  waking  thought.  The  exact  nature  of

their activities, however, depends largely on the status of

the community they serve. If the community has already

risen in open revolt, then the champions life is one long

military campaign, leading strike teams against the enemy

in strategic locations. More often, however, the oppressed

people continue to eke out a meager subsistence on their

farms or in their ghetto, while the outcast champion does

what he can to better their lot without their active participa-

tion. He might plunder ancient ruins to bring wealth into

his  community,  or  ght  his  way  up  the  feudal  chain  of

command until he confronts some distant emperor to win

freedom for his people.

Some movements that include outcast champions are

rigidly  organized  military  operations,  in  which  every

ghting member has a rank and position. Most, however,

are loosely organized, if they actually have any denite

NPC Reactions

As might be expected, any individual who belongs to a group

an outcast champion ghts against has a low opinion of the

character. If an outcast champion is actively ghting against

a local ruler, that ruler and the forces of law serving that

ruler (soldiers, constables, and so on) have an initial attitude

of  hostile  toward  the  character  and  any  members  of  his

movement or organization (see Inuencing NPC Attitudes,

page 72 of the Players Handbook). Most citizens of the area

have an unfriendly attitude, unless they are sympathetic

to the champions cause. Sympathetic characters have an

initial  reaction  of  friendly,  while  members  of  the  move-

ment are initially helpful. Few greet an outcast champion

with indifference, unless they are unaware of his identity

and his mission.

OUTCAST CHAMPION LORE

Characters can use Knowledge (local) or Gather Information

to research a particular outcast champion or his community

and learn more about him. When a character makes a skill

check,  read  or  paraphrase  the  following,  including  the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Basic information about the outcast champions

half-human community: Some members of the community

feel oppressed and marginalized, or the community is in

open revolt. No specics about the individual.

DC 15: The existence of the outcast champion: The people

of this community look to a hero they believe will throw

off the oppressors yoke or lead them to freedom.

DC  20:  The  name  of  the  outcast  champion  and  some

details about his activities and abilities.

OUTCAST CHAMPIONS

IN THE GAME

Its easy to introduce an outcast champion into an ongoing

campaign. If your campaign includes a group of oppressed

half-humans,  an  outcast  champion  could  suddenly  arise

within  that  community  and  galvanize  it  into  action.  Of

course, even if such a group hasnt appeared in the campaign,

its easy to postulate that the PCs might simply never have

noticed it. Alternatively, the player characters might begin

hearing rumors of an uprising in a distant land where their

adventures are leading them.

A  PC  outcast  champion  works  best  if  the  rest  of  the

players  are  on  board  with  the  character  concept.  They

might be of the same race, or at least associated with the

128

champions community somehow. Or they could simply be

sympathetic to the champions cause and methods, willing

to participate in adventures related to the ultimate goal of

freedom or vengeance for the champions oppressed com-

munity. However, even if the other PCs have no interest

in  the  outcast  champions  mission,  an  outcast  champion

character can remain involved in his communitys struggle,

even if only by sharing some of his treasure with the leaders

of the community.

Adaptation

The outcast champion is a fairly

generic class, and should fit into

any campaign with little or no

customization.

Encounters

An encounter with an outcast champi-

on is most interesting if it involves the

champions cause. If the PCs oppose

the champion, then a combat such

as the EL 8 encounter described

below  is  appropriate.  If  the

PCs  are  actually  or  potentially

sympathetic to the champions

cause, then an interesting diplo-

matic or roleplaying encounter can

result, such as the EL 12 encounter

described below. An NPC outcast

champion is almost always encoun-

tered  with  followers  or  allies  who

are  part  of  his  communitys  mili-

tary operations.

EL 8: Gruthak is a half-orc

outcast  champion  who  is

trying  to  persuade  a  nearby

tribe of orcs to invade the PCs

homeland  to  liberate  the

half-orcs living in that land.

He  is  accompanied  by  five

1st-level  half-orc  barbarians

(use  Table  412,  page  113  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide, to generate statistics and gear

Avenging  Strike  (Ex):  Twice  per  day,  Ethirindel  can

attempt to use an avenging strike on an enemy who has

dealt damage to an ally within the last hour. The avenging

strike must be delivered with a melee attack. Ethirindel

adds +2 to his attack roll and deals an extra 5d6 points of

damage with a successful avenging strike attack.

Desperate Fury (Ex): Once per day, when he is reduced

to fewer than one-half his full normal hit points, or when

he  is  fatigued  or  exhausted,  Ethirindel  can  enter  a  state

of desperate fury for 5 rounds. If he becomes frightened,

panicked, or cowering, his desperate fury ends immediately.

The following changes are in effect as long as he is in his

desperate fury: hp increase by 13; AC 22, touch 12, at-footed

20; Grp +16; Atk +18 melee (1d8+7,  +1 elf bane longsword)

or  +16  ranged  (1d8+5,  +1  human  bane  composite  longbow);

SV Fort +11, Ref +5; Str 18, Dex 14, Con 14; Climb +8, Hide

+4, Jump +8, Move Silently +4.

Ethirindel can share the effect of his desperate fury with

all allies within 30 feet who can see him. These allies gain

the same benets as Ethirindel for as long as his desperate

fury  lasts  (even  if  they  become  frightened,  panicked,  or

cowering).

Aura  of  Condence  (Ex):  Ethirindel  and  his  allies

within 30 feet who can see him gain a +5 morale bonus

on  their  Will  saves.  (This  bonus  is  already  included  in

Ethirindels statistics.)

Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic sleep

effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered

an elf.

Teamwork (Ex): Whenever Ethirindel or any ally within

30 feet who can see or hear him uses the aid another action,

the  bonus  provided  on  attack  rolls,  AC,  or  skill  checks

improves by 2 (from +2 to +4).

Possessions: +2 elven chain, +1 heavy steel shield, +1 elf bane

longsword, +1 human bane composite longbow (+3 Str bonus)

with  2  adamantine  arrows,  5  silver  arrows,  10  cold  iron

arrows, and 23 normal arrows, gauntlets of ogre power, circlet

SCAR ENFORCER

We have been abandoned by our fathers and mothers. We are

treated as children and slaves despite our talents and ambitions. If

they will not give us what we want through their own conscience,

then we shall take it, by guile and the blade.

Vakra, Bane of Elves

Scar enforcers are angry, embittered half-elves who have

rejected both sides of their ancestry. They band with others

of similar attitude, collectively known as the Scars, using

stealth  and  violence  to  strike  back  at  the  societies  that

marginalize them.

BECOMING A SCAR ENFORCER

Taking levels of rogue is the easiest way to become a scar

enforcer; all the entry skills are class skills for you, and your

sneak attack dice from rogue levels stack with those you

gain from scar enforcer levels. Bards are the natural second

choice, followed by clerics (with the Trickery domain) and

sorcerers. Dexterity (for sneaking) and Charisma (for bluff-

ing) are key abilities for you.

Entry Requirements

Race: Half-elf.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

Skills: Bluff 8 ranks, Hide 4 ranks, Move Silently 4 ranks.

CLASS FEATURES

While not an ideal straight-up combatant, the scar enforcer

is more than a match for human and elf opponents. You

work best striking from hidden positions, using your sneak

attack  and  smite  abilities  to  deal  massive  damage  with  a

single blow.

Spells per Day: At each even-numbered level, you gain

new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if

you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which

you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do

not, however, gain any other benet a character of that class

would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a scar enforcer, you must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

Favored  Enemy  (Ex):  As  a  member  of  this  class,  you

gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and

Survival checks when using these skills against humans

or elves. Likewise, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon damage

rolls against these races. See the ranger class feature, page

47 of the Players Handbook.

Smite Enemy (Su): Once per day starting at 2nd level,

you can deliver a powerful melee attack to a human or elf

foe. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) on your attack

roll and deal an extra 1 point of damage per class level. If

you accidentally smite a creature that is neither an elf nor a

human, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used

up for the day.

At 5th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 8th

level, you can use this ability three times per day.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you deal extra

damage when anking an opponent or any time the target

would  be  denied  its  Dexterity  bonus  (except  on  ranged

attacks,  which  must  be  point-blank  to  deliver  the  extra

damage). See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Players

Handbook.

Disguise  Self  (Sp):  Starting  at  4th  level,  you  can  use

disguise  self  three  times  per  day,  but  only  to  assume  the

appearance of a human or an elf.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): Beginning at 7th level, you

can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being

observed. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Players

Handbook.

Forgo  Heritage  (Ex):  At  10th  level,  you  leave  behind

your racial heritage. You are no longer considered an elf or

a human for the purpose of benecial or harmful effects.

(You still count as a half-elf for the purpose of qualifying

for this class.)

PLAYING A SCAR ENFORCER

As a scar enforcer, you have the benet of stealth and a fear-

some reputation that aids your work. Your organization, the

Scars, is rightly feared for harboring assassins, leg breakers,

and extortionistsand you use that fear to your advantage.

Your methods employ guile and cunning, moving through

Table 56: The Scar Enforcer

Hit Die: d8

the shadows with ease to land a blow on your hated foe. You

can rely on your fellow scar enforcers for aid, but remember

that youre still dealing with cutthroat murderers who have

their own agendas. Use racial tension to your advantage by

playing  off  stereotypical  fears  to  sway  opinions.  Always

remember that humans and elves have betrayed you and

your peoplethey are not worthy of your pity or respect.

As a relatively small group, scar enforcers occasionally

work together, creating effective strike teams that blend

their skills with deadly success. More commonly, a scar

enforcer operates on his own, mixing the needs of the Scars

with his own goals in a way that benets both. The core

leaders of the Scars are based in a huge metropolis called

Pal Ador (see below), but they have begun creating cells in

other cities. The Scars operate numerous illegal ventures,

including extortion, racketeering, and murder-for-hire. The

head of your cell assigns you dirty tasks to perform, increas-

ing in difculty as you gain levels. You have the freedom to

do whatever it takes to get the job done, as long as it does

not jeopardize the Scars. Unlike an outcast champion (see

the previoous section), as a scar enforcer you have little

interest in working to right the social injustices that you

perceive half-elves suffer. You are focused on revenge, and

you know that spilling blood is  more effective than any

diplomatic compromise.

Combat

Scar enforcers are both brutish thugs and crafty sneaks, and

work best from the shadows. They certainly have no concept

of ghting fair. The key is to stay hidden until you can strike

with certainty and do your best to pick off enemies one at a

time. Focus your attention on your favored enemies, taking

them out quickly before retreating to prepare for another

assault.  Use  disguise  and  spells  early  on  to  confuse  and

demoralize your foes, who will often be ghting on their

home territory. Never remain standing in one place for too

long, especially when ghting multiple opponents.

If youre in Pal Ador, everyone has heard of the Scars,

and  sometimes  your  reputation  alone  can  cause  lesser

opponents to ee, letting you deal with your primary target

unhindered.  Use  the  urban  terrain  to  your  advantage,

ghting from staircases, rooftops, and sewers to keep the

enemy guessing, as well as giving yourself cover and several

possible escape routes.

Make sure you work with allies who complement your

skills in an efcient manner and who dont shy away from

your  methods.  Flanking  can  be  remarkably  effective,

especially  if  you  and  your  allies  share  favored  enemies.

Still, never forget the more subtle methods of assassination.

You probably dont have a large number of hit points or a

particularly  high  AC,  so  strike  hard  and  strike  quickly

before eeing, letting your opponent quiver in fear of the

Scars.

At 4th level, you can blend into human and elf societies

with ease, thus allowing you easier access to your target.

If events turn against you, your hide in plain sight ability

gained at 7th level means that you can practically vanish

in the face of armed guards looking for intruders.

Advancement

The Scars are very particular about who can join their ranks.

First, you must be a half-elf. Second, you must prove your

rancor and disgust for both humans and elves. Last, you

must show both remarkable skill and a complete lack of

morals. Potential recruits are watched from afar and with

no interference by a high-ranking member. If you are spied

upon while performing some grandiose or clever scheme

against humans or elves, you may later be approached by

the sponsor, who gives you one simple command: Join or

die. If you accept, you undergo a probationary period in

which you must perform acts of cruelty against elves and

humans. If you refuse, the sponsor disappearsand your

days are then numbered, as the rest of the Scars hunt you

down to ensure their secrecy.

Once admitted as a Scar, you receive your marka wicked

cut across the chest, which is then smeared with ash and

special powder to create a deep, vivid pink scar. From then

on, the only way to leave the Scars is to die. You are sent on

missions of increasing difculty, murdering and stealing

from those who betrayed you.

As you gain levels in the scar enforcer class, maintain

high ranks in Hide, Listen, and Move Silently. Focus on

Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive if youre more of an

inltrator, sneaking out in the open to worm your way

closer  to  your  foes.  Magic  items  that  benet  rogues  are

extremely useful, as are items that boost your Charisma or

disguise your appearance.

Resources

The Scars offer their members a safe haven, information on

possible targets, a cadre of lesser henchmen and informants,

and a sympathetic ear when it comes to the injustices that

half-elves endure. Although a relatively small organization,

the Scars have built an infamous reputation that can strike

fear in nobles and peasants alike.

The  Scars  started  out  in  one  city,  but  have  begun

branching out, inltrating towns that have large half-elf

populations.  Therefore,  they  may  be  able  to  provide  aid

outside the connes of Pal Ador. As criminals, the Scars have

access to weapons, armor, illegal substances, and forbidden

magic items. They have contacts throughout the city, in the

form of sympathizers as well as ofcials they have bribed

or blackmailed into submission.

SCAR ENFORCERS IN THE WORLD

If the PCs nd themselves involved with the Scars, they will

have to make up their minds about how they feel toward

humans,  elves,  and  half-elves.  Obviously,  if  they  belong

to one of these races, the decision can be straightforward.

Adventures revolving around the Scars tend to be gritty

and dark, focusing on subterfuge, racial tension, betrayal

and loyalty, and the more sinister aspects of city life. You

can  introduce  the  Scars  in  the  form  of  a  single  agent,  a

squad of hit men sent to handle the adventurers, a power-

ful thieves guild, or allies in the struggle against human

and elf oppressors.

The Scars work well in campaigns in which elves and

humans are at odds. Because of this enmity, half-elves are

looked  down  upon  and  treated  as  second-class  citizens,

pariahs,  or  worse.  However,  this  climate  allows  a  player

portraying a half-elf to rise to the challenge, proving his

worth in the face of adversity and discrimination.

Organization

The Scars are organized like most criminal groups, with a

strong leader, a small inner circle of trusted lieutenants, and

a myriad of soldiers, informants, and specialists.

Although the Scars are rightfully known as thieves and

extortionists, they truly shine as assassins for hire. Despite

the fact that they despise both humans and elves, they have

few qualms about taking a contract from a member of one

race  that  results  in  the  death  of  a  member  of  the  other.

They are less inclined to murder a fellow half-elf, but will

do so if the price is right or they believe that the subject

deserves to die. This callous disregard for life is one of the

reasons  why  many  half-elves  do  not  support  the  Scars

political rhetoricthey think a murderer is a murderer,

regardless of race.

Each  lieutenant  has  his  own  area  of  expertise  and  is

responsible for nding individuals that suit the organiza-

tions  needs. For example, Zola, a powerful sorcerer, locates

talented spellcasters who can be brought into the group, and

also eliminates rivals who pose too much of a threat or dont

agree to join. At their core, however, the Scars are criminals,

and everyone in the group has his own schemes and tricks

to become as wealthy and powerful as possible. The Scars

leader and lieutenants take 50% of each members earnings.

With this money, the Scars purchase weapons, information,

and  safe  houses,  provide  bribes  to  local  authorities,  and

occasionally invest in legitimate businesses.

maintain  the  unity  of  his  large  criminal

gang, all the while  ghting against retaliatory

strikes from humans and elves. He is a brutal

and completely remorseless individual.

An individual scar enforcer spends his day planning for

a job or maintaining his turf by shaking down merchants,

taking bribes, and breaking legs. Some are sent out to in ltrate

the manors and palaces of wealthy humans and elves, either

going in undetected or passing themselves off as part of the

household. Because their enemies are as determined to end

their violent activities as the Scars are to continue them,

the  Scars  remain  constantly  on  the  move  and  rotate  their

stronghold between several safe houses on a regular basis.

The Scars are intimately familiar with Pal Adors exten-

sive sewer system, which allows them to move undetected

throughout most of the city. However, the age and labyrin-

thine design of the sewers means that they are not very safe,

and it is not uncommon for the Scars to  nd monsters and

patrols in the murky depths. The sewers are riddled with

secret  passageways,  long-forgotten  tunnels,  and  hidden

strongholds of other underworld factions.

The man responsible for raising the Scars to their cur-

rent level of infamy is a shadowy half-elf named Mezriss.

Raised on the unforgiving streets of Pal Ador, he quickly

took to a life of crime and joined an ordinary criminal gang

who called themselves the Scars. Mezriss assassinated the

former  leader  through  a  slow,  insidious  contact  poison

hidden in a magni cent crown that he presented the

leader as a gift of respect. Once he took over, Mezriss

changed the scope and mission of the gang, turning

it from a ragtag group of thieves to a highly ef cient

band of assassins and criminals, bent on revenge for

the inequality and humiliation they suffered for being

half-humans. Over time, the inner cabal of the Scars

was replaced solely with half-elves. Mezriss works to

Although the group presents itself as a unied front,

divisions  exist  within  the  Scars.  Some  factions  have  a

softer opinion of either humans or elves, and are more

likely  to  work  with  them  than  their  peers.  A  power

struggle  can  erupt  when  a  faction  raises  the  idea  of

eliminating either humans or elves from the city, then

having  half-elves  live  alongside  the  survivors.  These

opinions have been quashed each and every time so far,

but are occurring with greater regularity. Anyone who

becomes too outspoken must deal with Mezriss, which

usually means a blade in the back.

NPC Reactions

The Scars are feared and reviled by most of the populace of

Pal Ador, who see them as nothing more than criminals,

thieves, and murderers. Most individuals have an unfriendly

or hostile attitude toward a member of the Scars (see Inu-

encing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Players Handbook).

While there are many independent criminals in Pal Ador,

the Scars are the biggest and most powerful of the lot, con-

trolling most of the illicit activity within the city walls. For

this reason, they are hated but respected. Since they have

their ngers in so many schemes, its almost impossible not

to deal with them in some way.

Half-elves regard the Scars in a much better light than

the general populace does. Although some are sickened

by the Scars violent and immoral actions, the downtrod-

den half-elves of Pal Ador see them as revolutionaries and

liberators. The Scars have extensive contacts among the

half-elf community who can usually provide a minor bit

of assistance or, at the very least, turn a blind eye to the

Scars activities.

The Scars have an impressive list of enemies, including

the  legitimate  government  of  Pal  Ador,  many  merchant

groups, and rival criminal bands. Both the human and elf

factions loathe them, but they also make use of the Scars

against each other. Through the Scars, the human and elf

governments wage a covert war, granting each government

plausible  deniability  and  saving  face  with  the  public.  In

addition, the Scars are actively persecuted by lawful and

good religions within Pal Ador (and in other cities where

the group has established cells). However, in corrupt Pal

Ador, even these seemingly upstanding groups may utilize

the services of the Scars in one way or another.

SCAR ENFORCER LORE

Characters with Gather Information can research the scar

enforcers. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 10: The Scars are a criminal band of half-elf murder-

ers, thieves, and extortionists.

DC 15: The Scars despise both humans and elves and

attack them whenever they can. They consider themselves

revolutionaries in the name of half-elves everywhere.

DC 20: The Scars hire themselves out to anyone who can

afford their price, and while they hate humans and elves,

they sometimes do their dirty work.

DC 30: The Scars are thoroughly enmeshed in the citys

corrupt politics. They have swayed opinions in their favor

for years and have been known to eliminate ofcials who

cause them too much trouble.

PCs  trying  to  establish  contact  with  the  Scars  for  a

job should make a DC 20 Gather Information check to

discover  the  necessary  intermediaries  and  protocols  for

contacting  them.  If  the  person  is  either  a  human  or  an

elf, the DC is increased to 30. However, the Scars do not

preclude working for or with humans and elves, but do so

only to increase tensions between those two races and at

a markedly increased price.

SCAR ENFORCERS IN THE GAME

As described above, the Scars are found mainly in one  city.

However, you can easily introduce them into a large town

of your own. As a secret criminal group, its easy to assume

that  they  have  been  there  for  a  long  time,  keeping  their

activities well hidden from the general populace.

The prestige class appeals to players who enjoy skull-

duggery,  murky  morality,  and  grim  plotlines.  The  scar

enforcer  is  a  combination  of  erce  combatant,  sneaky

spy,  and  social  engineer  who  specializes  in  threats  and

intimidation. When you design a campaign that involves

the Scars, make sure you include opportunities for them

to  use  their  skills  and  reputation  to  dazzle  the  locals.

Remember to play up the racial tension and simmering

anger within the city (or area).

Adaptation

Scar enforcers were designed with the city of Pal Ador in

minda place where humans and elves live in an unsteady

truce with deep suspicions toward each other. You could

place the Scars in any city within your campaign or have

them act as a roving band of mercenaries who ght for the

rights of half-elves. Alternatively, the Scars could simply

be part of the local thieves guild or assassins guild, with an

additional political motivation that sets them apart.

Encounters

If the PCs visit Pal Ador, they will eventually encounter

the  Scars,  even  in  a  mundane  situation  such  as  dealing

with a merchant who owes them money. If they become

involved  in  the convoluted politics  of  the  city, they  may

become targets of the Scarsfor recruitment, harassment,

or assassination.

EL  8:  Quinn,  a  scar  enforcer,  and  two  half-elf  bravos

(see  Sample  Half-Elf  NPCs,  page  183)  begin  shadowing

and questioning the adventurers, convinced they are on a

mission for either the human or elf government.

THE CITY OF PAL ADOR

Pal Ador (Metropolis): Nonstandard; NE; 3,000 gp; Assets

600,000 gp; Population 30,000 (37% human, 20% elf, 18%

half-elf, 10% haling, 7% gnome, 5% dwarf, 3% half-orc).

Pal Ador is an enormous city bisected by a large, turgid river.

It is an ancient and grand city that has fallen to decadence,

declining steadily over the past centuries. At the moment,

Pal Ador is a divided city, both guratively and literally.

Its two largest races, humans and elves, live in an unsteady

accord, with the river acting as a natural border that barely

keeps the peace.

Pal Ador is situated on a large open plain dotted with

treesthe river on which it sits is the only notable feature.

Although in its decline, Pal Ador is lled with grand, tower-

ing buildings, expansive manors, and a bustling merchants

district. The architecture on the elf side of town is markedly

different from the human side, reecting its inhabitants

unique  style.  Regardless  of  their  location,  all  buildings

show signs of slow decay and the place exudes a genteel

rot. Pal Ador is noted for its huge sewer system, built to last

for centuries. These sewers have become the territory of all

manner of scum, criminals, and dissidents.

Pal  Ador  was  created  long  ago  as  a  settlement  that

bordered human and elf territories. The two races lived

in harmony, and Pal Ador quickly became a trading and

cultural center. The two nations established embassies ve

hundred  years  ago,  and  ideas  and  good  will  ourished.

This all came to an end two hundred years later when the

political foundation on which the city was built began to

crack. Over time, divisions between the citys elves and

humans grew. The two nations that were once allies and

partners  came  to  blows,  and  portions  of  Pal  Ador  were

sacked several times by both sides.

After almost seventy-ve years of war, a truce was nally

established, and Pal Ador was once again used as a neutral

ground for humans and elves. Trade started up again, and

buildings were repaired, but attitudes were never again the

same. The two races pulled back on opposite sides of the

river, maintaining their own governments as well as polite,

if  icy,  relations  with  each  other.  The  war  also  corrupted

the morals and ethics of its rulers and inhabitantsif you

werent on the take, you were a victim to be exploited. Finally

having regained its status as a trading city, Pal Ador is still

a  dangerous  place  to  live,  and  violence  in  the  streets  is  a

common occurrence. Nobles rarely leave the safety of their

homes, and when they do, they travel under heavy guard.

After centuries of relative peace early in its history, Pal

Ador  featured  a  relatively  large  half-elf  population.  In

harmonious times, half-elves were accorded the same rights

and respect as any citizen. Today, however, they are viewed

with  suspicion  and  distastemany  live  no  better  than

slaves. Indeed, although slavery is technically illegal on

both sides of the river, an underground slave trade thrives

(and is ignored by authorities, as long the slave owner is

not enslaving his own race). Half-elves try to better their

lives, but between the corruption of the government and

the prejudice of both humans and elves, they have had little

success. Humans, elves, and half-elves who visit the city

must quickly decide which side they are onneutrality

is not tolerated.

Both  sides  of  the  town  are  ruled  by  councils,  heavily

inuenced  by  the  local  merchants  guild  and  criminal

elements.  Each  faction  has  a  sizable  army  relative  to  the

population of the city, and nobles maintain a larger than

average coterie of bodyguards, treating their homes as small

city-states within the metropolis.

SHADOW SENTINEL

In the darkest hour, in the darkest place, I guard the ramparts

and make sure no one threatens our homeland.

Blackpennant Thautar, illumian shadow sentinel

Shadow sentinels are elite illumian warriors who protect

their  people  from  githyanki  raiders,  demonic  invasions,

and hordes of barely imaginable monsters from the Plane

of Shadow. They have learned to imbue their weapons with

shadowstuff itself, causing them to ow like quicksilver,

then strike as the hardest steel.

BECOMING A SHADOW SENTINEL

The most straightforward path to sentinelhood is to attain

5th level as a ghter and then convince the sentinel lead-

ers in Elirhondas that you have what it takes to defend

illumian  lands  against  monstrous  invasion.  The  entry

requirements  for  the  prestige  class  are  broad  enough

that  illumians  from  almost  any  class  can  eventually

qualify. Because illumians often multiclass anyway, its

not unheard of for spellcasters to join the ranks of the

sentinels,  even  though  the  prestige  class  doesnt  offer

advanced spellcasting power.

Entry Requirements

Race: Illumian

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Weapon Focus (any slashing weapon).

Special: Must pass combat examination from sentinel

leaders.

CLASS FEATURES

The shadow sentinels class features focus almost entirely on

wielding the umbral blade given to each new member.

Shadow Points (Su): Upon entering this class, you gain

a reservoir of shadow essence that you can draw upon to

power your class features. This reserve increases in size as

you advance in level; Table 57 indicates your daily limit

of shadow energy. It takes 8 hours of rest to restore your

shadow points to their maximum.

Spending shadow points is a swift action.

Umbral Blade (Su): As a new member of the class, you

receive an umbral blade in an elaborate ceremony conducted

in the Tombs of the Brave in Elirhondas. In the hands of

anyone not trained in its use, an umbral blade is merely a

weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus made of some unusu-

ally dark, oily metal. An umbral blade may be any kind of

slashing melee weapon, from a dagger to a longsword to a

greataxe; each new shadow sentinel can choose the specic

weapon. You can infuse the umbral blade with the power of

shadow itself, unlocking greater powers. Your umbral blade

acts as a lens, focusing your power to accomplish feats no

other weapon can match.

In time, your umbral blade grows in power as you become

more familiar with it. At 4th level, your umbral blade gains

a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

The enhancement bonus rises to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 8th

level, and +5 at 10th level. This enhancement bonus only

applies when you wield it; for any other character it is only

a +1 weapon.

You cant add other special properties or powers to your

umbral blade.

You can have only one umbral blade at a time. If you lose

your umbral blade, you can transform any slashing melee

weapon that has at least a +1 enhancement bonus into a

new umbral blade (with all the appropriate powers for your

class level) by meditating and infusing the blade with the

power of shadow. Doing this costs 100 XP, takes 24 hours,

and uses up all your shadow points for that day.

Morphic Blade (Su): Even as a beginning shadow sen-

tinel, you have rudimentary control over your umbral blade.

You can spend 1 shadow point to change the dimensions

of your weapon, turning it into a slashing melee weapon

of your choice (sized appropriately for you). This change

lasts  for  24  hours  or  until  you  change  the  umbral  blades

dimensions again, whichever comes rst.

At 5th level, you can spend 3 shadow points to allow your

umbral blade to mimic a special material (such as adamantine,

silver, or cold iron). This effect lasts for 1 minute per class

level. Your umbral blade retains the normal hardness and

hit points for a weapon of its type.

At 9th level, you can spend 5 shadow points to allow your

umbral blade to mimic a specic alignment (chaos, evil, good,

or law) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

This effect lasts for 1 minute per class level. If the weapon

has a different alignment (such as granted by your race or

subtype), the new one suppresses the original alignment

for the duration of the effect.

Shadowstrike (Su): You can spend 1 shadow point to

momentarily turn your umbral blade into uid shadowstuff,

enabling you to pierce an opponents defenses. Your next

attack with your umbral blade (if made before the start of

your next turn) is treated as a touch attack. The attack even

ignores any AC bonus from cover (except total cover) that

the target may have, since the blades uid nature allows it

to reach around barriers.

Shadowbane (Su): At 2nd level and higher, you can spend

1 shadow point to grant your umbral blade the equivalent of

the bane special ability against evil outsiders and against

creatures native to the Plane of Shadow. The effect lasts for

1 round per class level.

Shadowsharp  (Su):  At  3rd  level  and  higher,  you  can

spend 1 shadow point to double the threat range of your

umbral  blade.  This  benet  is  the  equivalent  of  the  keen

special ability. The effect lasts for 1 minute per class level.

Shadow Drain (Su): At 7th level and higher, you can

spend 1 or more shadow points when striking a living crea-

ture with your umbral blade. The attack permanently drains

1 point of Strength from the target per shadow point spent.

You can spend a maximum number of shadow points per

round on this ability equal to one-half your class level.

PLAYING A SHADOW SENTINEL

As a shadow sentinel, you are among the best of the best,

entrusted with the guardianship of the illumian race. Your

umbral blade marks you as a paragon of the illumian race and

the sworn enemy of anyone who threatens it.

While  most  shadow  sentinels  live  in  a  garrison  in

Elirhondas, ready to defend the city at a moments notice,

you might have a greater degree of freedom to travel and

adventure. Some shadow sentinels are placed on inactive

reserve, free to return to their cabals or live independent

lives until they receive a magical summons to aid in the

defense  of  Elirhondas.  The  Black  Table  that  directs  the

affairs of Elirhondas sometimes sends shadow sentinels

on  long-term  missions  that  take  them  far  beyond  the

ramparts of the shadow city. Shadow sentinels can resign

their commissions at any time, although few do. Even after

resigning from the organization, a sentinel retain their

umbral blades and can still advance in the class because

they understand how to practice and hone their mastery

over shadow.

Combat

Shadow  sentinels  tend  to  be  straightforward,  efcient

opponents in melee, cutting down their enemies as quickly

as possible. Against opponents who arent familiar with your

umbral blade, you can gain a signicant advantage by ghting

conventionally for a few rounds, then surprising your enemy

with an attack that ignores his armor and shield.

When you reach the higher levels of the prestige class,

youll  quickly  become  adept  at  guring  out  how  best  to

bypass  a  monsters  magical  defenses,  using  the  relevant

Knowledge  skill  to  learn  more  about  your  enemy.  Once

you understand the limits of a foes damage reduction and

armor, you can use the morphic blade and shadowsharp class

features to make every cut of your umbral blade count.

Advancement

Becoming a shadow sentinel is no easy task. You must travel

to Elirhondas, rst obtaining permission from your cabal to

do so. Then you must succeed in a series of duels, physical

tness tests, and grueling contests devised by the senior

leaders of the shadow sentinels. Only one in ten illumians

passes  the  necessary  exams.  You  are  taught  meditative

techniques that enable you to store shadow energy within

yourself,  followed  by  training  in  specic  combat  moves

that compliment your unique weapon. After a few months

of training, youre ready to receive your umbral blade and

call yourself a shadow sentinel.

Ongoing  training  is  mostly  a  matter  of  nurturing  the

shadow energy within you and learning to absorb and chan-

nel more and more of it. Shadow sentinels can accomplish

much of this training on their ownits more a matter of

practice and repetition than guided instruction.

Your prowess as a shadow sentinel is tied directly to the

effectiveness of your umbral blade. Accordingly, choose feats

that maximize your ability to wield that weapon effectively

(such as Improved Disarm and feats with Power Attack as

a prerequisite) and feats that keep you alive long enough to

cut at your foes (such as Combat Expertise and feats with

Dodge as a prerequisite).

Resources

You  are  given  an  umbral  blade  when  you  rst  become  a

shadow sentinel, but its your responsibility to replace it if

its lost or sundered. Shadow sentinels provide their own

armor,  although  in  most  cases  their  cabals  back  on  the

Material Plane made it for them.

Shadow sentinels on active duty count on illumian spell-

casters to whisk them into combat, so they tend to armor

themselves  as  heavily  as  possible.  If  youre  adventuring

beyond Elirhondas, youll want to balance the protective

benet of heavy armor and shield with the versatility of

faster movementand the extra damage from a two-handed

weapon.

SHADOW SENTINELS

IN THE WORLD

The shadow sentinel prestige class invests an illumian PC in

the races survival, immersing the PC in illumian battles and

intrigues. Because the class is mechanically straightforward,

its a particularly good class for a player who wants to play a

mysterious race such as the illumians without the difculty

of complicated multiclassing or spellcasting.

Organization

All  shadow  sentinels  call  the  garrison  at  Elirhondas

their  home  base,  because  illumians  there  developed  the

shadow-ghting techniques that became the organizations

hallmark.

The shadow sentinels function as a directorate within

the city. Their leader, General Sheokru, takes orders only

from the Black Table in Elirhondas. In practice, the Black

Table  leaves  the  shadow  sentinels  to  their  own  devices,

occasionally asking for a few capable sentinels to perform

missions away from the shadow city.

The sentinels conduct themselves like a small army, with

a corps of of cers giving orders to squads, each of which has

a sergeant to handle speci c, moment-by-moment tactics.

Advancement through the ranks can be quite rapid. The

shadow sentinels  ght often enough that battle eld promo-

tions are common.

Shadow sentinels spend much of their time drilling or

teaching the rudiments of melee combat to the citys less

elite guards. But at least once a month, a raiding force or

rampaging monster poses a threat to Elirhondas, and the

shadow sentinels mobilize in response.

The  shadow  sentinel  garrison  is  home  to  dozens  of

illumians  who  assist  the  sentinels  but  are  not  sentinels

themselves, including armorers, weaponsmiths, and arcane

and divine spellcasters. The founder of the shadow sentinels,

Duskwatcher Vlaukea, lives in the garrison.

Although more than a century old, he still

advises  senior  sentinel  of cers  on

matters of traininghe did invent

the  shadow  sentinel  technique,

after all.

NPC Reactions

Almost  every  illumian  has  heard  of

the shadow sentinels and their courage

in the defense of Elirhondas and illumians

everywhere,  so  most  illumians  have

an  initial  attitude  of  friendly  toward  a

shadow sentinel bearing an umbral blade

(see In uencing NPC Attitudes, page 72

of the Players Handbook). Githyanki are

likewise aware of the shadow sentinels

and  greet  them  with  anger  or  fear.

Their  initial  attitude  is  uniformly

hostile.  Few  other  creatures  have

ever heard of Elirhondas or the

shadow sentinels, so the senti-

nels  reputation  doesnt  affect

most NPCs attitudes.

SHADOW SENTINEL

LORE

Characters with Knowledge (arcana)

can research the shadow sentinels

to learn more about them. When

a character makes a skill check,

read  or  paraphrase  the  follow-

ing,  including  the  information

from lower DCs.

DC  10:  The  shadow  sentinels  are  elite

illumian soldiers who wield black swords.

DC  15:  Shadow  sentinels  defend  the  illumian  city  of

Elirhondas on the Plane of Shadow, and theyve kept it safe

for decades, mostly against githyanki attacks.

DC 20: The black swords the sentinels carry are called

umbral blades. Shadow sentinels can make an umbral blade

shift and grow by channeling shadow through it.

DC  30:  General  Sheokru  leads  the  shadow  sentinels,

and he can do whatever he wants with his troops as long as

Elirhondas stays safe.

SHADOW SENTINELS IN THE GAME

Illumian characters have heard of shadow sentinels from

childhoodtheyre famous protectors of the race. Other

characters meet shadow sentinels only if they visit Elirhon-

das or run afoul of powerful illumian interests.

If you have a shadow sentinel PC at your gaming table,

make sure that the PC doesnt feel chained to Elirhondas and

can freely leave to adventureeven if the tasks dont have

anything  to  do  with  the  illumian

race.  An  occasional  reminder  of

the organizations importance is

suf cient.

they are sent on missions of great importance. Elirhondas

itself can make a great headquarters for a group of high-level

PCs. Because its on the Plane of Shadow, its easy to reach

from anywhere, yet mysterious and insulated from the strife

of the Material Plane.

Adaptation

As written, the shadow sentinels are strictly designed for

illumians, and theyre tied tightly to that races culture. The

mechanics of the class would be appropriate for any race

or group with a connection to the Plane of Shadow, so you

could use shadow sentinels even in a campaign that doesnt

feature illumians.

Encounters

If the PCs wind up ghting shadow sentinels, youll want

to give some thought ahead of time to how the sentinels

will spend their shadow points during the battle. Shadow

sentinel ghts are more fun if they last long enough for the

sentinels to spend their points and use all their tricks with

their umbral blades.

EL 9: The characters encounter a pair of shadow sen-

tinel  guards  while  on  an  adventure  that  seems  totally

unrelated to the illumian race. Unfortunately, the PCs

patron has become enmeshed in illumian politics, and

now  the  characters  have  been  marked  as  enemies  of

Elirhondas.

URBAN SOUL

The  citys  streets  are  my  arteries,  and  its  buildings  my  bones.

Threaten my city, and you threaten me.

Parethian, urban soul of Rel Astra

Urban souls are the chosen champions of the deity Urba-

nus  (described  in  Chapter  1),  charged  with  protecting

city  denizens  from  external  dangers  such  as  marauding

monsters, and from subtler threats to the city such as crime

and urban unrest.

BECOMING AN URBAN SOUL

Bards and rogues have the easiest path into this prestige

class, although rogues have to buy Knowledge (architecture

and engineering) as a cross-class skill. Wizards can enter the

class with relative ease, but the lack of spellcasting advance-

ment makes it unlikely that theyll be interested.

Entry Requirements

Race: Human.

Skills: Knowledge (local) 10 ranks, Knowledge (architecture

and engineering) 5 ranks, Gather Information 5 ranks.

Special: Blessing from the temple of Urbanus.

CLASS FEATURES

The urban souls class features focus on survival in cities

and large communities. Many of your powers rely on your

being within the boundary of a city. For the purpose of your

class  features,  the  term  city  applies  to  any  community

with more than 5,000 inhabitants (that is, at least as large

as a small city).

City Ramparts (Ex): Once per day, you can call upon

the combined might of a communitys citizens to fortify

yourself  in  body  and  mind.  Doing  this  grants  you  a  +4

141

bonus to Constitution and a +2 bonus on Will saves, and

it also toughens your skin, giving you damage reduction

5/adamantine. This effect lasts for at least 1 round per point

of (adjusted) Constitution modier (minimum 1 round).

If  you  are  within  a  city,  the  duration  increases  as  noted

below:

Small city

Large city

Metropolis or larger

(3 + Con modifier) rounds

(5 + Con modier) rounds

(10 + Con modifier) rounds

Mob  Violence  (Su):  At  8th  level,  you  become  able  to

channel the anger of a restive populace into fury you unleash

on your enemies. You can activate the mob violence class

feature for a number of rounds per day equal to your class

level, split up as you like. Activating or deactivating this

ability is a free action. While you have this class feature

active, your attacks deal extra damage as noted below.

Small city

Large city

Metropolis or larger

1d6 points of damage

2d6 points of damage

3d6 points of damage

You can use this ability twice per day at 5th level and

three times per day at 9th level.

Urban Sustenance (Ex): You rely on the presence of a

city for your physical needs, and you suffer when you travel

beyond such areas. While within a city, you need not eat,

drink, or sleep, and you heal at twice the normal rate. If

you cast spells, you must still rest for the normal amount

of time needed to regain spells.

However, you cannot heal naturally at all outside a city,

and  you  eventually  weaken  if  kept  away  from  an  urban

environment. If you remain outside a city for 24 hours, you

must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1 point of

Strength damage and 1 point of Constitution damage. Each

day after the rst that you remain outside a city, the save

DC increases by +1.

Citybred Senses (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, you gain a

+2 insight bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks made

within a city.

At 6th level, your bonus improves to +4, and at 10th level,

it improves to +6.

Meld Into  City (Sp):  Beginning  at  3rd level,  you can

meld your body and possessions into the wall of a build-

ing, into the street, or into any other stone structure that

is part of a city. This ability otherwise functions like meld

into stone, usable at will, with your urban soul level as the

caster level.

See the City (Sp): At 4th level and higher, you can create

a magical sensor (as clairaudience/clairvoyance, except that

only sight is allowed) three times per day, using your urban

soul level as the caster level. The sensor is not limited by the

clairaudience/clairvoyance spells range; you can see anyplace

within the city youre in.

Urban Skill Mastery (Ex): By 6th level, you have become

so familiar with moving through cities that you can do so

with extraordinary ease. While in a city, you can take 10 on

any of the following skill checks even when under stress:

Balance, Climb, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble.

Hear the City (Sp): At 7th level and higher, you can speak

with a building, street, or other part of a city once per day.

This ability is the equivalent of a stone tell spell (using your

urban soul level as the caster level), except that it works on

any part of a city.

You can use this ability twice per day at 10th level.

Citywalk (Sp): At 10th level, you can magically travel

between  cities  at  will.  This  ability  functions  much  like

transport via plants, except that you must begin the journey

within a city, and you end the journey on the outskirts of

a specied city on the same plane.

You  cannot  specify  a  particular  endpoint  (such  as  the

Laughing  Manticore  Tavern  in  Rel  Astra  or  the  Mayors

Reception Hall in Greyhawk). The ability deposits you in a

safe location determined by the DM (assuming one exists)

just outside the destination city. If the specied city doesnt

exist, or if no safe location outside the city exists, the ability

fails.

You must concentrate for a specic period of time to acti-

vate this ability. The size of the destination city determines

how long the concentration must last, as noted below. If

your  concentration  is  interrupted  during  this  time,  you

must start again.

CITY-BONDED

SUBSTITUTION LEVEL

Urban souls who desire a deep connection to a specic city

may take this substitution level instead of the 10th level

of the urban soul prestige class. For more information on

substitution levels, see Chapter 6.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills

The city-bonded substitution level grants the class skills

of the urban soul prestige class plus Diplomacy and Sense

Motive.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modier.

Class Features

All the following are features of the city-bonded substitu-

tion  level.  These  three  substitution  benets  replace  the

10th-level urban souls citywalk ability; the character still

receives the benets of the citybred senses and hear the city

class features.

City Bond (Su): This class feature offers greater power

within your city in exchange for the exibility to travel. As

long as you remain within the boundaries of your chosen

city, you do not age. (If you leave the city, you age normally.)

Your class features that depend on your being inside a city

function only when youre within the boundaries of your

chosen city.

This  bond  enables  you  to  draw  more  strongly  on  the

collective strength of the city, even if its not the largest

urban  environment.  For  the  purposes  of  your

class features, your chosen city is considered

a  metropolis,  regardless  of

its actual size. If your citys

population  drops  below  5,000

inhabitants, you lose access to

your class features until the

population grows again.

Intracity Teleport

(Sp):  You  can  magi-

cally travel between

any  two  points

within  your  city

at  will.  This  class

feature functions like

the  greater  teleport

spell,  except  that

it  requires  a  full-

round action, and

both  the  origin

and  destination

must  be  within

your city.

Urban Renewal

(Sp): As a city-bond-

ed  urban  soul,  the

cityscape  is  yours

to  command.  You

gain  access  to  the

following  spell-like

abilities:  disintegrate

(objects  only),  stone

shape,  and  wall  of  stone.

You  can  use  these  abilities  a

total of ve times per day, split up however you

choose (two disintegrates and three walls of stone, for

example). Your caster level is equal to your urban

soul level.

PLAYING AN URBAN SOUL

The  city  streets  are  your  home  turf,  and  youre  tougher,

more  mobile,  and  more  perceptive  there.  Because  your

power  is  tied  to  the  urban  environment,  youre  loath  to

thousand adventures more thrilling than those found in

Urban souls have the blessing of Ur-

banus,  deity  of  cities,  but  you  stand

at  arms  length  from  the  de-

itys  clergy.  You  can

count  on  assistance

and advice from the

temples  of  Urba-

nus,  but  youre

not  under  their

command, nor are

they under yours.

Youve been cho-

sen  by  Urbanus

for  purposes  of

his own, and Ur-

banus  doesnt

share

always

his

reasons

with  either  ur-

ban souls or his

clerics.

Combat

Youll  face  an

important  de-

cision  in  every

battle: Is this battle

dangerous  enough

to  warrant  using

the  city  ramparts  class

feature?  Youre  much

better  protected  with

your city ramparts ability ac-

tive, but frequent use might leave

you bereft of protection when you

Parethian, urban soul of

the city of Rel Astra

need it most.

Youll be able to manage your city ramparts

ability more efciently if youre able to learn

about your foes beforehand. Stealth skills and the see the city

and hear the city class features help you scout your enemies

and avoid unpleasant surprises in combat.

When  you  gain  the  mob  violence  class  feature  at  8th

level,  youll  have  another  time-limited  advantage.  Your

mob violence ability will be more effective if you manage

it carefully as well.

143

Advancement

New  urban  souls  are  recruited  by  the  will  of  Urbanus

himself. He appears to a prospective urban soul in a dream,

commanding a visit to the deitys temple the next day. The

temples  high  priest  receives  a  similar  prophetic  dream

and prepares various rites to welcome and bless the new

urban soul.

As you gain levels in the prestige class, you can operate in

conjunction with the clerics of Urbanus or as an indepen-

dent agent. Urban souls dont necessarily share the neutral

good alignment of Urbanus, but they have an alignment

conducive to the city theyre in. If your alignment varies

greatly from neutral good, it might place a strain on your

relationship with the church of Urbanus.

Once youre in the urban soul prestige class, let the nature

of the cities you patrol guide your feat and skill choices. If

your city is under siege or beset by enemies, concentrate on

combat-related feats and skills such as Balance, Climb, Jump,

and Tumble that improve your maneuverability in a ght.

If youre investigating hidden corruption within the city,

take skills such as Gather Information and Intimidate.

Resources

Urban  souls  can  usually  count  on  free  or  inexpensive

healing  at  temples  of  Urbanus,  subject  to  their  available

resources. The temple is also a good source for information,

especially if an urban soul is visiting a city for the rst time.

Many urban souls travel from city to city, asking at each

temple in turn about what threats need to be eliminated.

URBAN SOULS IN THE WORLD

The urban soul prestige class is a natural for campaigns that

feature  frequent  forays  into  urban  environments.  Urban

souls also make good city guides or patrons. An urban soul

makes an effective antagonist if the PCs come to a city with

mayhem (or a subtler plot) in mind.

Organization

Urban  souls  have  an  organizational  connection  to  the

church  of  Urbanus,  but  they  arent  part  of  the  religious

hierarchy and answer to none but the deity. A few urban

souls adopt a single city and devote themselves utterly to

its welfare, while others wander from city to city, sampling

their splendors.

Beyond seeing to the welfare of the city they inhabit, few

urban souls have a larger agendabut keeping tabs on the

threats to an entire metropolis can be a full-time job. Over

the course of a week, a typical urban soul might contend

with  a  war  between  two  rival  thieves  guilds,  a  trading

company smuggling dangerous poisons into the city, and

an infestation of wererats in the city sewers. When the city

is safe, an urban soul can relax and enjoy the diversions that

urban life offers.

Some urban souls earn a degree of fame (or at least noto-

riety) among the citizens of a city. Parethian of Rel Astra is

well known among the citys residents, for example, even if

tales about him are as much folklore as fact. More often, an

urban soul keeps a low prole, blending in among both high

society and low. Roughly half of all urban souls are nomadic,

moving city from city as the mood strikes them.

Urban souls can wander as they like until they reach 10th

level. At that point, they can remain devoted to city life

in general, in which case they attain 10th level normally.

But if they choose to bond themselves with a single city,

they instead take the substitution level described above.

Once an urban soul has established such a bond, it cannot

be broken unless the urban soul dies or the city is razed to

the ground.

Most urban souls accede to subtle pressure to conform to

the citys alignment and prevalent social mores. For example,

if a city forbids halings within its walls, an urban soul

based there is more likely to be unfriendly to halings. If

two cities are rivals, urban souls hailing from those cities

are probably enemies too.

NPC Reactions

If a particular urban soul is well known within a city, most

long-term  residents  have  an  initial  attitude  of  friendly

(see  Inuencing  NPC  Attitudes,  page  72  of  the  Players

Handbook). Even if an urban soul moves from city to city or

keeps a low prole, he gets a +2 circumstance bonus during

interactions with a citys long-term residents.

Conversely, those who threaten a citys status quo have an

instinctive dislike of urban souls. An urban soul interacting

with criminals, invaders, or other enemies of the city takes

a 2 circumstance penalty on interactions, except for uses

of the Intimidate skill.

URBAN SOUL LORE

Characters with Knowledge (local) or Gather Information

(used within a city) can research urban souls to learn more

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 10: An urban soul is a magical guardian of a city.

Every city has one.

DC  15:  Urban  souls  are  chosen  by  the  god  of  cities,

Urbanus, to protect the cities in their care. The bigger the

city, the more powerful the urban soul. This DC is also

sufcient to learn basic details about a famous urban soul

afliated with a particular city.

DC 20: Urban souls depend on the city for their power.

Outside a city, theyre a lot less dangerous.

DC 30: Detailed information about specic urban souls

active in a particular city recently, except for urban souls

who took pains to remain incognito during their visit.

URBAN SOULS IN THE GAME

The  viability  of  an  urban  soul  PC  depends  on  an  agree-

DM. Because much of the urban souls power works only

within  a  citys  boundaries,  its  not  fair  for  a  DM  to  offer

this prestige class, then set adventures in far-off dungeons,

hostile wilderness, or other isolated sites. But the player of

the urban soul should expect that on occasion, the action

will head beyond the city wallsthe DM has a whole table

of players to keep happy.

D&D  is  a  game  of  challenges,  and  the  DM  has  every

right to design occasional encounters that are particularly

difcult for urban souls because they involving leaving the

city. As long as an urban soul character can use his best

powers most of the time and relishes the additional chal-

lenges when they happen, this prestige class can enrich a

campaign.

With an urban soul in the game, you have a built-in excuse

to  develop  adventure  sites  and  interesting  places  within

the cities of your campaign world. If the urban soul at your

table wants to protect a specic city, you now have a base of

operations for the rest of the party.

Adaptation

While this prestige class is designed with humans in mind,

its easy to imagine that Urbanus would choose nonhuman

urban souls for cities dominated by other races. The illithid

city of Illkool Rrem might have a mind ayer urban soul,

for example, and the dwarf city of Uruz probably has a dwarf

urban soul. But in most campaign worlds, only humans have

a vast network of cities that stretch across dozens of nations

and societies. Nonhuman urban souls are tied to a smaller

set of cities, so they may have a harder time adventuring.

Encounters

An encounter with an urban soul should show off urban

terrain  as  much  as  possible.  Battles  on  the  rooftops,  in

the sewers, or in a crowded marketplace make the urban

environment  come  to  lifeand  they  offer  plenty  of

opportunities for an urban soul to use a wide array of class

features.

EL 10: Walvor the urban soul is visiting a series of cities,

trying to nd one with a government to her likingthe

more  heavy-handed,  the  better.  Shes  traveling  in  the

company of a vampire bodyguard, a gift from the head of

the assassins guild in the last city Walvor visited. Because

both Walvor and the vampire can use spider climb, theyll

scramble up nearby buildings to gain an edge in combat,

or to escape via the rooftops if theyre overmatched.

Language: Common.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Walvor  does  an  extra  4d6  points

of damage on any successful attack against at-footed or

anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies

to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Crea-

tures  with  concealment,  creatures  without  discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Walvor may

choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack,

but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Citybred Senses (Ex): Walvor gains a +2 insight bonus

on Listen, Search, and Spot checks made within a city.

City  Ramparts  (Ex):  Once  per  day,  Walvor  can  call

upon the might of the city to fortify herself in body and

mind. The following changes are in effect as long as she

benets  from  the  City  Ramparts  ability:  hp  increase  by

18; SQ damage reduction 5/adamantine; Fort +8, Will +4.

This effect lasts for 13 rounds if Walvor is in a metropolis,

8 rounds if shes in a large city, 6 rounds if shes in a small

city, and 3 rounds otherwise.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Walvor  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Trapnding (Ex): Walvor can nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Walvor  retains  her  Dexterity

bonus to AC even when at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe  (she  still  loses  her  Dexterity  bonus  if  paralyzed  or

otherwise immobile).

Urban Sustenance (Ex): While within a city, Walvor

need not eat, drink, or sleep, and she heals at twice the

normal rate. She doesnt heal naturally at all beyond a city.

If she remains outside a city for 24 hours, she must suc-

ceed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength

damage and 1 point of Constitution damage. Each day after

the rst that she remains outside a city, the DC of the save

increases by 1.

EL 17: Parethian is the urban soul bonded to the city of

Rel Astra, although you can use him in whatever city you

wish. Hes an antagonist if the PCs intend mayhem in his

city, but hes a useful ally if the PCs wind up in trouble over

their heads. Parethian might hire the PCs to take care of an

emerging threat to his city, especially if the threat lies well

beyond the city walls.

nel the citys power to deal an extra 3d6 points of damage

with any successful attack. He can activate mob violence

for 10 rounds per day, split up as he likes.

Urban  Renewal  (Sp):  A  total  of  ve  times  per  day,

Parethian can use any of the following spell-like abilities

(caster level 10th): disintegrate (objects only), stone shape, and

wall of stone.

Bardic Music: Use bardic music seven times per day. See

the bard class feature, page 29 of the Players Handbook.

City Bond (Su): As long as Parethian remains within the

boundaries of Rel Astra, he does not age. His class features

that depend on being inside a city function only when hes

within Rel Astra. His chosen city is considered a metropolis

when hes using his class features, regardless of its actual

current size.

Citybred  Senses  (Ex):  Parethian  gains  a  +6  insight

bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks made within Rel

Astra.

City Ramparts (Ex): Three times per day, Parethian can

call upon the might of the city to fortify himself in body

benets from the city ramparts ability: hp increase by 34;

SQ  damage  reduction  5/adamantine;  Fort  +11,  Will  +12.

This effect lasts for 13 rounds as long as Parethian remains

in Rel Astra.

Hear the City (Sp): Twice per day, Parethian can speak

with a building, street, or other part of a city. This is the

equivalent of a stone tell spell, caster level 10th, except that

it works on any part of a city.

Intracity Teleport (Sp): At will, Parethian can use greater

teleport  (as  a  full-round  action)  between  any  two  points

within Rel Astra.

Meld Into City (Sp): Parethian can meld his body and

possessions into any stone structure that is part of Rel Astra.

This functions like meld into stone, usable at will, caster level

10th.

See the City (Sp): Parethian can create a magical sensor

(as  clairaudience/clairvoyance,  except  that  only  sight  is

allowed) three times per day, caster level 10th. The sensor

can observe anywhere within Rel Astra.

Substitution Level: Parethian has taken the city-bonded

substitution level instead of his normal 10th level of urban

soul.

Urban Skill Mastery (Ex): Parethian can take 10 with

any of the following skills even when under stress: Balance,

Climb, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble.

Urban Sustenance (Ex): While within Rel Astra, Par-

ethian need not eat, drink, or sleep, and he heals at twice

the normal rate. He doesnt heal naturally at all outside of

Rel Astra. If he remains outside Rel Astra for 24 hours, he

common trait among the races of destiny is versatil-

ity. This chapter provides new skill uses, feats, and

substitution levels for human, half-elf, half-orc,

and illumian characters.

SKILLS

The following section describes new uses for the skills noted

in the Players Handbook.

DECIPHER SCRIPT

(INT; TRAINED ONLY)

In addition to piecing together the gist of an ancient scroll

or tome written in some obscure language, Decipher Script

allows you to write in code to conceal the meaning of your

writing so others cannot read it while you (and anyone who

knows the code) can.

Check: You can create a secret code that befuddles the

reader. The DC is 20 for the simplest of messages, 25 for a

standard text, and 30 or higher for extremely lengthy or

complex writings. The DC for someone using the Decipher

Script skill to decode the text is equal to your check result.

Anyone with a key to your code can read the text normally,

although a separate Decipher Script check may be neces-

sary if the original text was confusing and esoteric in

the  rst place.

Failure to decode the text has the same effects as for

other uses of the Decipher Script skill, as described on

page 71 of the Players Handbook.

Action: Deciphering the equivalent of a single page

of coded script takes 1 hour.

Try Again: No.

DISGUISE (CHA)

Sometimes you want to make an object to appear like

something else. This skill lets you modify the appear-

ance of an object to slip it past guards or to make it

appear as some innocuous piece of equipment.

Check:  You  can  use  this  skill  to  temporarily

change the appearance of an object, so that it is not

immediately evident what function the object actu-

ally serves. This use of the skill requires time and

some additional material to dress up the object.

The  objects  disguise  can  include  an  apparent  change  of

height or weight of no more than one-tenth the original

unless specially crafted accessories are utilized (possibly

requiring a separate Craft check). Your Disguise check result

is opposed by the Search checks of anyone looking at the

item, or otherwise searching in the area in question.

Try Again: No.

Special:  The  DM  makes  the  Disguise  check  for  you

secretly, so that youre not sure how well the objects disguise

holds up to close examination.

GATHER INFORMATION (CHA)

In addition to nding out juicy bits of rumor, you can use

this skill to understand an organizations structure, includ-

ing nding out whos in charge and what sort of authority

the leader has.

Check: You can learn a broad overview of the command

structure of an organization: who the ofcers or leaders are;

how many layers of command exist between the highest-

level  ofcers  and  the  average  foot

soldier  (or  entry-level  opera-

tive); how to identify ranks

within the organization;

and  what  kind  of

authority  the  vari-

ous members have.

Discovering  the

names  of  specic  mem-

bers of the organization

adds 10 to the DC of the

Gather  Information

check,  and  knowing

their  location  adds

another 5.

The more secretive

the  organization,  the

more  difficult  this

information is to obtain.

Publicly  recognized  orga-

nizations are much easier

to  learn  about  than

organizations that dont

officially  exist.  You

can  only  obtain  this

information  if  some-

one in the community

actually  knows  it.  At

the  DMs  discretion,

members  of  the  local

community  may  be

completely  ignorant  of

an  organization  operating

in  their  area.  For  example,

if  a  bandit  crew  is  using

the remote and long-aban-

doned monastery dozens of miles away, and no one outside

the organization knows they are there, the average citizen

cant provide any information about their command struc-

ture.

The table below shows the various DCs and examples of

what sorts of groups they represent.

Organization  DC  Examples

Secretive

Unknown

10  Local government, local guild

15  Private club, military

25  Espionage group, criminal cartel

30  Shadow government, underground cult

Invitation-only club, local criminals

KNOWLEDGE

(NOBILITY AND ROYALTY) (INT)

Knowledge  about  the  intricacies  of  the  noble  and  royal

courts also gives insight into the bureaucracy that helps

support them. This skill lets you know the easiest ways to

bypass the multiple layers of assistants, majordomos, and

chamberlains  to  meet  with

the person in charge.

Check: You can use this

skill to discover the levels of

bureaucracy within a royal

household,  government,  or

other large body of authority.

If  you  make  a  check  (DC

15 + organization size

modier;  see  below),

you  gain  a  +2  cir-

cumstance  bonus  on

Bluff, Diplomacy, and

Gather  Information

checks pertaining to

that  particular  orga-

nization for one week.

However,  failure  by

5  or  more  means

you  make  a  false

assessment  of  the

situation,  imposing

a 2 penalty on the

use of those skills for

one  week  instead.

(The  DM  should

make  this  check

in secret, and apply

the appropriate modier

when required.) The size and

complexity  of  the  organiza-

tion may provide a bonus or

a penalty on this check; see

the table below.

Action: Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowl-

answer or you dont.

Try Again: No. The check represents what you know, and

thinking about a topic a second time doesnt let you know

something you never learned in the rst place.

KNOWLEDGE (RELIGION) (INT)

Churches,  cults,  and  religious  sects  have  their  own

structure, levels of hierarchy, and procedures for accom-

plishing tasks, all in the name of tending to their ocks

and worshiping their deities. As with Knowledge (nobility

and royalty) above, you know how to navigate the maze of

clerks, scribes, and church leaders to talk to the person

you want.

Check: You can use this skill to understand the struc-

ture of authority within a church, cult, or other religious

organization. If you make a check (DC 15 + organization

size  modier;  see  below),  you  gain  a  +2  bonus  on  Bluff,

Diplomacy, and Gather Information checks made during

the next week that pertain to that particular organization.

However,  failure  by  5  or  more  means  you  make  a  false

assessment  of  the  situation,  imposing  a  2  penalty  on

the use of those skills for one week instead. The size and

complexity of the organization may provide a bonus or a

SURVIVAL (WIS)

The Survival skill is not only important in the wilderness,

but can be the difference between life and death on the

mean streets of the city. In huge cities, the poor and desti-

tute must scrounge for food, nd places to sleep, and avoid

dangerous animals that call the streets home.

Check: You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in

urban settings. The table below gives the DCs for various

tasks that require Survival checks.

Task

Get along in an urban setting without paying

for food or services. You can provide relatively

clean water and fresh food for one other person

for every 2 points by which your check results

exceeds 10.

Locate a relatively warm and dry place to stay in

for a 24-hour period. You must reroll this check

every day.

Keep from getting lost in confusing streets with

which you are not familiar.

Follow tracks (see the Track feat, page 101 of

the Players Handbook). Most streets in urban

settings are a mix of soft (mud) and hard

(cobblestones) surfaces.

Action: Varies. A single Survival check may represent

activity over the course of hours or a full day.

Try Again: Varies. For getting along in urban settings or

nding a warm and dry place, you make a Survival check

once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until

the next check is made.

Synergy:  If  you  have  5  or  more  ranks  in  Knowledge

(local), you gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks within urban

areas covered by your expertise in that skill.

LISTEN (WIS)

Sometimes you want to hear a whispered conversation across

the room or make out what two people are talking about in

a loud, crowded room.

Check:  You  can  use  this  skill  to  clarify  overheard

conversations. The DCs given in the Players Handbook are

RACIAL FEATS

Feats marked with the [Racial] tag require the character to

be of a specic race in order to select the feat. These feats

share no other special properties and are considered to be

a subset of a larger category of feats (in this book, all racial

feats are general feats).

GENERAL AND

RACIAL FEATS

The feat descriptions below use the same format presented

in the Players Handbook.

ABLE LEARNER [RACIAL]

You have a great aptitude for learning.

Prerequisite: Human or doppelganger.

Benet: All skill ranks cost 1 skill point for you to pur-

chase, even if the skill is cross-class for you. The maximum

number  of  ranks  you  can  purchase  in  a  cross-class  skill

remains the same.

This feat does not affect the skill point cost to learn a

language or to gain literacy (for a barbarian or other illiterate

character).

Normal: Cross-class skills cost 2 skill points per rank.

Special: This feat may only be taken at 1st level.

BRIGHT SIGIL [RACIAL]

You have established a greater degree of control over your

sigils. When you concentrate, you can emit strong illumina-

tion from the glowing symbols that surround your head.

Prerequisite: Illumian.

Benet:  As  a  standard  action,  you  can  increase  the

illumination from your illumian sigils to provide a bright

glow. Your sigils shed illumination equivalent to a daylight

spell. The brighter light lasts as long as you concentrate,

and for 1 round thereafter.

Normal:  An  illumians  sigils  ordinarily  emit  a  5-foot

radius of shadowy illumination, equivalent to a candle.

CHANNELED RAGE [RACIAL]

You can focus your rage to counter charms and compul-

sions.

Prerequisites: Half-orc, ability to rage.

Benet: You may spend one of your daily uses of rage as

an immediate action to add your Strength bonus on a Will

saving throw.

CITY SLICKER

You are very familiar with city life and the inner workings

of your hometown.

bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as

noted in the skill description.

Normal: Synergistic skills provide a +2 bonus on skill

checks.

DIVERSE BACKGROUND [RACIAL]

You  have  a  wide  and  diverse  background,  giving  you  a

greater understanding of different occupations.

Prerequisite: Half-human.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

have both the human and orc subtypes. Half-ogres (see Chapter

4) would retain their giant type while also gaining the human

subtype. Typically, the result is that such races enjoy all the ben-

efits (and suffer all the drawbacks) provided by both subtypes.

For example, half-elves could use human-only magic items while

still qualifying for elf-only prestige classes.

VARIANT:

HALF-HUMANS AND HUMANLIKE RACES

According to the Players Handbook, half-elves and half-orcs are

treated  as  elves  and  as  orcs,  respectively,  for  the  purpose  of

determining various game effects, but not as humans. Other hu-

manlike races, such as the aasimars and tieflings, are described

as humans with a trace of celestial or fiendish blood, but are

outsiders rather than humanoids.

These limitations mean that many options available in this

book are off limits to such races. At the DMs discretion, half-

human  and  humanlike  races  can  be  grouped  together  with

humans  as  humanoids  with  the  human  subtype  (rather  than

their  own  subtype).  This  means  that  such  races  qualify  as

human for the purpose of meeting a prerequisite for a feat or

prestige class, for activating a human-only magic item, for adju-

dicating effects that treat humans differently from other races,

and the like.

For most half-human races, this is only a very minor change.

Such races retain whatever humanoid subtypes they possessed,

while gaining the human subtype. Half-elves, for example, would

have  both  the  human  and  elf  subtypes,  while  half-orcs  would

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

In the case of other half-humans or humanlike races, this repre-

sents a much larger change. Planetouched races descended from

humans would change from outsiders with the native subtype to

humanoids with the human subtype. Planetouched races that this

change affects include the aasimar and tiefling (see Chapter 4),

the chaond and zenythri (from Monster Manual II), the mechana-

trix and shyft (from Fiend Folio), and the genasi (from Monsters

of  Faern).  Half-celestial,  half-fiend,  and  half-dragon  humans

would change from outsiders or dragons to humanoids with the

human subtype. Regardless, these characters would retain any

traits possessed by all creatures of their original type (outsiders

retain darkvision; dragons retain darkvision, low-light vision, and

immunity to sleep and paralysis; and so forth).

If you choose not to offer this variant, you can achieve a similar

effect with the Human Heritage feat (see page 152).

for 1 hour requires a Gather Information check. You must

make another Gather Information check for every hour of

the search, as well as each time the trail becomes difcult to

follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town.

to track down your quarry, depend on the community size

and the conditions; see the table below:

allow effective trailing.

Special: You can cut the time per Gather Information

check in half (to 30 minutes per check), but you take a 5

penalty on the check.

INITIATE FEATS

Initiate feats show that a follower has achieved some distinc-

tion with his or her patron deity, and therefore has gained

access to additional spells and abilities. Some of these feats

allow the addition of these spells to the spell lists of other

classes. If you have more than one class that qualies for

this addition, you must choose only one spell list to which

they will be added. No character can have more than one

initiate feat, since such a feat presumes a deep level of com-

mitment to a single deity.

Master of the Roof: You know how to use the slopes to your

advantage. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against any

RACIAL

SUBSTITUTION LEVELS

A  substitution  level  is  a  level  of  a  given  class  that  you

take instead of the level described for the standard class.

Selecting a substitution level is not the same as multiclass-

ingyou remain within the class for which the substitution

level is taken. The class features of the substitution level

simply replace those of the standard level.

Essentially,  each  set  of  substitution  levels  presents  a

racially avored variant standard class. The DM may add

more  racial  substitution  level  options  (such  as  half-elf

clerics  or  half-orc  rogues)  at  his  option,  using  these  as

guidelines.

To qualify for a racial substitution level, you must be of

the proper race. For instance, to select a racial substitution

level of half-orc bafrbarian, you must be a half-orc.

Of the four races featured in this bookhuman, half-

elf, half-orc, and illumiansubstitution levels are offered

here only for half-elves and half-orcs. Humans are far too

generalized to take advantage of racial substitution levels,

while illumians already possess the capability to adapt their

racial  abilities  to  specic  classes  by  choosing  particular

power sigils.

For  each  class  with  racial  substitution  levels,  you  can

select each substitution level only at a specic class level.

When you take a substitution level for your class at a given

level, you give up the benets gained at that level for the

standard class, and you get the substitution level benets

instead.  You  cant  go  back  and  gain  the  benets  for  the

level you swapped outwhen you take your next level in

the standard class, you gain the next higher level as if you

had gained the previous level normally. For instance, if you

are a 5th-level bard and take the half-elf bard substitution

level for 6th level, you forever lose the benets normally

provided to a standard 6th-level bard (gaining instead the

racial substitution benets for a 6th-level bard). When you

gain another level in bard, you gain the 7th-level benets

of the standard bard class.

Unless  otherwise  noted  in  the  description  of  a  racial

substitution  level  benet,  a  character  who  takes  a  racial

substitution level gains spellcasting ability (increases in

spells per day and spells known, if applicable) as if he had

taken this level in the standard class.

A  character  need  not  take  all  the  substitution  levels

provided  for  a  class.  For  instance,  a  half-orc  barbarian

might decide to take only the racial substitution level at

2nd level, ignoring the other substitution levels.

The  description  of  each  substitution  level  benet

explains  what  occurs  to  the  standard  class  ability  not

gained, if that ability would normally increase at a specic

rate (such as the gnome rangers favored enemy).

When  a  substitution  level  changes  the  base  classs

Hit Die or class skill list, the change applies only to the

specific  substitution  class  level,  not  to  any  other  class

levels. A half-orc who takes the half-orc druid substitu-

tion level as a beginning character gains 10 hit points

(from the substitution levels d10 Hit Die), and gains an

additional  1d10  hit  points  for  each  additional  half-orc

druid  substitution  level  she  takes  later  in  her  career,

but she gains only the normal d8 Hit Die for each of her

standard druid levels.

HALF-ELF BARD

Blessed with a smooth grace and demeanor that many nd

appealing, the half-elf bard is a common sight. The half-elf

bard gives up some of her performance abilities to become

more well versed in social interaction and negotiation.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a half-elf bard substitution level, a character must be

a half-elf about to take her 1st, 6th, or 8th level of bard.

Class Skills

Half-elf bard substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard bard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modier (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the half-elf bards racial

substitution levels.

Soothing Voice (Su): A 1st-level half-elf bard with 3 or

more ranks in Diplomacy can spend one daily use of her

bardic music to use a composed, steady voice and reason to

calm the emotions in others around her. This ability works

in much the same way as the half-elf bards fascinate ability,

with the following differences.

The  creature  to  be  soothed  must  be  within  30  feet  of

the bard and must be able to understand the language she

is  speaking.  To  use  this  ability,  the  half-elf  bard  makes

a Diplomacy check. Her check result is the DC for each

affected creatures Will save against the effect. On a suc-

cess, the creature is affected as if by the calm emotions spell.

The effect lasts as long as the creature listens to the bard,

although the creature may wander off on its own if there

is nothing to keep its interest.

This  benet  replaces  the  standard  bards  ability  of

countersong.

Command (Sp): A 6th-level half-elf bard with at least 9

ranks in Diplomacy may spend one daily use of her bardic

music to issue a command (as the spell) to a creature within

30 feet. Alternatively, the command can affect all creatures

that the bard has affected with her soothing voice or fascinate

ability. A Will saving throw (DC 11 + bards Cha modier)

negates the effect.

This  benefit  replaces  the  standard  bards  ability  of

suggestion.

Table 62: Half-Elf Bard Racial Subsitution Levels

Secrets of the Diplomat: At 8th level, a half-elf bard adds

the following spells to her spells known: 1stcommand;

2ndzone of truth; 4thsending.

This  benet  replaces  the  4th-level  spell  learned  by  a

standard bard at 8th level. From now on, the bard knows

one fewer 4th-level bard spell than normal (not counting

the spells she learned from this substitution feature).

HALF-ELF FIGHTER

Lacking the bonus feat of humans and the high Dexterity of

elves, half-elf ghters are not particularly common. Those

who do take up a life of the blade often become talkative

swashbucklers  who  blend  quick  swordplay  with  a  sharp

tongue. They seek to confuse and demoralize foes, rather

than overcoming them with brute force.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To  take  a  half-elf  ghter  substitution  level,  a  character

must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 6th level

of ghter.

Class Skills

Half-elf ghter substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard ghter class, plus Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense

Motive.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modier (or four

times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the half-elf ghter racial

substitution levels.

Blade Focus (Ex): The half-elf ghter focuses his combat

talents  on  ghting  with  slender  blades.  At  1st  level,  the

half-elf ghter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the

longsword and rapier.

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon

Focus, but is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for

the purposes of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and so

on that require the feat. For example a half-elf ghter with

this ability could take Weapon Specialization (rapier) with-

out selecting Weapon Focus (rapier) as a separate feat.

This benet replaces the standard ghters 1st-level bonus

feat.

Main-Gauche  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  the  half-elf  ghter

learns how to ght using a dagger in his off-hand in defense

as well as offense. The half-elf ghter is treated as having

tures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. It is a

language-dependent, mind-affecting ability.

aimed  at  tricking  his  opponent  into  letting  his  guard

down. Whenever a half-elf  ghter  ghts defensively, he

may attempt a Bluff or Diplomacy check as a free action,

opposed by his opponents Sense Motive check (the oppo-

nent may also add his base attack bonus on this check).

HALF-ELF RANGER

Not all rangers spend their entire lives in the untamed wilds

of the forests and hills. Some half-elves  nd a mix of rural

and urban life to their taste, and temper their wilderness

lore with the ability to interact well with a wide range of

individuals. The half-elf ranger is the ultimate investigator

and bounty hunter. She  nds social skills just as important

for survival as  ghting prowess.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To  take  a  half-elf  ranger  substitution  level,  a  character

must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 4th, or 13th level

of ranger.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modier (or four

Class Features

All the following are features of the half-elf ranger racial

substitution levels.

Urban Tracking (Ex): The half-elf ranger gains Urban

Tracking (see page 154) as a bonus feat.

An  8th-level  ranger  with  Urban  Tracking  can  cut  the

time required per Gather Information check to 30 minutes

without taking the normal 5 penalty on the check. (This

benet augments, but does not replace, the standard 8th-

level ranger class feature of swift tracker.)

This benet replaces the Track feat normally gained as a

bonus feat by a standard 1st-level ranger.

Street  Magic:  At  4th  level,  a  half-elf  ranger  adds  the

following  spells  to  her  class  spell  list:  1stcomprehend

languages,  detect  secret  doors,  message;  2nddetect  thoughts,

tongues; 3rdphantom steed; 4thdimension door.

A ranger who selects this substitution feature loses the

following spells from her class spell list: 1stdetect animals

or plants, detect snares and pits, entangle, summon natures ally

I;  2ndsnare,  speak  with  plants,  summon  natures  ally  II;

3rdcommand plants, diminish plants, plant growth, summon

natures ally II, tree shape; 4thcommune with nature, summon

natures ally IV, tree stride.

Skill  Mastery  (Ex):  At  13th  level,  a  half-elf  ranger

becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can

use  them  reliably  even  under  adverse  conditions.  Upon

gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to

3 + her Intelligence modier. When making a skill check

with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and

distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.

This benet replaces the standard rangers camouage

ability.

Class Features

All the following are features of the half-orc barbarian racial

substitution levels.

Reckless Charge (Su): At 2nd level, the half-orc barbar-

ian gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls when making a charge,

but takes a 4 penalty to AC. These values replace the normal

bonus and penalty accorded to a charging character.

This benet replaces the standard barbarians uncanny

dodge ability. If the barbarian would later gain improved

uncanny dodge as a barbarian class feature, he gains un-

canny dodge instead.

Insightful Rage (Ex): While raging, a half-orc barbar-

ian of 5th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to

disbelieve illusion spells.

This benet replaces the standard barbarians improved

uncanny dodge ability.

Two-Handed  Strike  (Ex):  The  half-orc  barbarian

focuses his combat talents toward massive, two-handed

melee weapons. At 7th level, the half-orc barbarian gains

a +2 bonus on damage rolls with any two-handed melee

weapon.

This  benet  replaces  the  standard  barbarians  damage

reduction 1/ gained at 7th level. From this point forward,

the half-orc barbarians damage reduction is treated as one

point less than the noted value (1/ at 10th level, 2/ at

13th level, and so forth).

HALF-ORC BARBARIAN

HALF-ORC DRUID

Most half-orcs are raised in harsh lands, far from civiliza-

tion. They tap into their inner anger and power to become

devastating berserkers who charge into combat with relish.

Those who grew up among orcs are particularly fond of

huge, cleaving weapons that can reap terrible destruction.

This substitution allows a half-orc barbarian to sacrice

some of his intuitive defenses to become more aggressive

in combat.

Hit Die: d12.

While  most  orcs  revere  their  primary  deity,  Gruumsh,

others are drawn to the primal brutality of nature. Half-orc

druids are noted for their brute strength and force of will,

summoning animals that are more powerful than normal

and ghting with impressive physical prowess.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a half-orc druid substitution level, a character must be

a half-orc about to take her 1st, 4th, or 6th level of druid.

Requirements

To take a half-orc barbarian substitution level, a character

must be a half-orc about to take his 2nd, 5th, or 7th level

Class Skills

Half-orc druid substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard druid class, plus Intimidate.

Class Features

All the following are features of the half-orc druid racial

substitution levels.

Tough Animal Companion (Ex):  The half-orc druid

tends to attract physically powerful specimens. Her animal

companion gains Toughness as a bonus feat.

Bully Animal (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, when the

half-orc druid uses her wild empathy ability, she adds her

Strength  modier  to  the  check  instead  of  her  Charisma

modier.

This benet replaces the sxtandard druids resist natures

lure ability.

Augmented Natures Allies (Su): Starting at 6th level,

any animal summoned by a half-orc druid with a summon

natures ally spell gains a +4 bonus to Strength and Constitu-

tion. These bonuses dont stack with those granted by the

Augment Summoning feat.

This benet replaces the standard druids ability to use

wild shape one additional time per day. From this point on,

the half-orc druids number of daily wild shapes is reduced

by one (2/day at 7th level, 3/day at 10th level, and so on).

HALF-ORC PALADIN

At rst glance, the concept of a half-orc paladin seems a

contradiction in terms. But those rare half-orcs with the

necessary dedication to law and goodness become the most

zealous protectors of righteousness.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To  take  a  half-orc  paladin  substitution  level,  a  character

must be a half-orc about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 6th level of

paladin.

Class Skills

Half-orc paladin substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard paladin class, except that Diplomacy is dropped

and Intimidate is added.

Table 67: Half-Orc Paladin Racial Subsitution Levels

Class Features

All the following are features of the half-orc paladin racial

substitution levels.

Righteous Fury (Ex): A half-orc paladin can y into

a fury of righteous fervor once per day, dealing powerful

blows to his enemies. Entering a righteous fury is a free

action.  While  in  a  righteous  fury,  the  half-orc  paladin

gains a +2 morale bonus on melee weapon damage rolls.

This bonus increases by 1 for every four class levels, to

+3 at 4th level, +4 at 8th level, up to a maximum of +7 at

20th level. The half-orc remains in this fury for 1 round

plus 1 round per point of Charisma bonus (minimum 1

round).

At 5th level, and at every ve class levels thereafter, the

half-orc paladin may enter this righteous fury one additional

time per day.

This  benet  replaces  the  standard  paladins  smite  evil

ability.  A  half-orc  paladin  who  selects  this  substitution

feature never gains any daily uses of smite evil.

Aura  of  Awe  (Su):  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  a  half-orc

paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). In addi-

tion, evil creatures within 10 feet of the character take a 2

penalty on saves against fear effects (or on checks made to

resist his Intimidate attempts).

This substitution feature replaces the base paladins aura

of courage ability.

Remove Fatigue (Sp): At 6th level, a half-orc paladin can

remove the fatigued condition from all allies within a 30-

foot burst centered on him. (This has no effect on exhausted

allies.) He can use this ability one additional time per week

for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three

times per week at 12th, and so forth).

This benet replaces the standard paladins remove disease

ability.  A  half-orc  paladin  who  selects  this  substitution

feature never gains any weekly uses of remove disease.

s  social  creatures,  the  races  of  destiny  create

spells  that  focus  on  community  life.  Those

aware  of  their  special  role  in  the  world  also

craft unique magic that can reshape the  ow of

fate itself. The following spells and magic items offer new

choices for spellcasters and nonspellcasters alike.

SWIFT AND

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

The  Miniatures  Handbook  introduced  the  concept  of  a

new action type: the swift action. Likewise, the Expanded

Psionics  Handbook  introduced  another  new  action  type:

the immediate action. These two game concepts are not

restricted to miniatures play or psionics and can be utilized

in  a  regular  D&D  roleplaying  game.  Some  of  the  feats,

spells, or items in Races of Destiny and future DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS supplements use these concepts. A description

of how they work follows.

Swift Action: A swift action consumes a very small

amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of

effort  and  energy  than  a  free  action.  You  can  perform

one swift action per turn without affecting your ability

to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is

like a free action. However, you can perform only a single

swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions

you take. You can take a swift action any time you would

normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions

usually involve spellcasting or the activation of magic

items;  many  characters  (especially  those  who  dont

cast spells) never have an opportunity to take a swift

action.

Casting a quickened spell is a swift action (instead

of a free action, as stated in the Quicken Spell feat

description  in  the  Players  Handbook).  In  addition,

casting any spell with a casting time of 1 swift action

(such as choose destiny) is a swift action.

Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 swift action

does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Immediate Action: Much like a swift action, an

immediate action consumes a very small amount

of  time,  but  represents  a  larger  expenditure  of

effort  and  energy  than  a  free  action.  However,

unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be

performed at any timeeven if its not your turn.

Casting feather fall is an immediate action (instead

of a free action, as stated in the spell description

in the Players Handbook), since the spell can be cast

at any time.

161

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as

using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for

that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or a

swift action until after your next turn if you have used

an immediate action when it is not currently your turn

(effectively, using an immediate action before your turn

is equivalent  to using  your  swift  action  for  the  coming

turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are

at-footed.

USING NEW DOMAINS

IN A CAMPAIGN SETTING

If you choose to introduce one or both of the new domains

featured in this book to a published campaign setting, the fol-

lowing deities are suggested.

Forgotten Realms: Gond (City), Haela Brightaxe (Destiny),

Horus-Re (Destiny), Mask (City), Savras (Destiny), Waukeen

(City).  These  deities  are  described  in  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign Setting.

Eberron: Boldrei (City), The Undying Court (Destiny). These

deities are described in the EBERRON Campaign Setting.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

In general, deities whose portfolios include trade, wealth,

or  community  may  offer  the  City  domain  (unless  the  deity

is closely associated with rural life). Nonhuman deities very

rarely offer the City domain. Those whose portfolios include

fate, heroism, or predestination may offer the Destiny domain

to their clerics (deities of luck or good fortune typically offer

the  Luck  domain  instead,  though  some  offer  both).  The

Destiny domain is most closely associated with nonchaotic

deities.

ANIMATE CITY

Transmutation

Level: City 9

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: 60 ft.

Area: 60-ft.-radius emanation, cen-

tered on you

Duration: 1 min./level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The buildings and other structures of

the city attack your enemies. Every

round  on  your  turn,  every  enemy

within  the  spells  area  is  subject  to

one  melee  attack  as  if  from  a  Gar-

gantuan  animated  object  (slam  +15

melee, 2d8+10 damage). The animated

citys  attacks  disregard  cover  and

concealment  (even  invisibility  is

useless).

In  addition,  all  enemies  within

the  area  of  the  spell  move  at  half

normal  speed  (regardless  of  their

mode  of  movement).  Damage  dealt

to the animated city structures has

no effect.

You may cast this spell only when

within a community at least as large

as  a  small  city  (see  page  137  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

BESTOW CURSE,

GREATER

Transmutation

Level: Bard 6, cleric 7, Destiny 7,

sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The spellcaster places a curse on the

creature touched, choosing one of the

three following effects:

One ability score is reduced to 1, or

two ability scores take 6 penalties

(minimum 1).

8  penalty  on  attack  rolls,  saving

throws,  ability  checks,  and  skill

checks.

Each  turn,  the  subject  has  a  25%

chance to act normally; otherwise,

he takes no action.

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

You may also invent your own curse,

but it should be no more powerful than

those described above, and the DM has

nal say on the curses effect.

A greater curse cannot be dispelled,

nor can it can be removed with a break

enchantment, limited wish, or remove curse

spell. A miracle or wish spell removes

the greater curse, but each greater curse

also  must  have  a  single  means  of

removing it with some deed that the

spellcaster designates. The deed must

be  something  that  the  subject  can

accomplish  within  one  year  (assum-

ing  he  undertakes  it  immediately).

For example, the deed might be slay

the  dragon  under  Castle  Bluecraft,

or climb the tallest mountain in the

world.  The  cursed  victim  can  have

help accomplishing the task.

CHARM PERSON, MASS

Enchantment (Charm)

[Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S

Target: One or more creatures, no

two of which can be more than 30

ft. apart

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell functions like charm person,

except that mass charm person affects a

number of creatures whose combined

HD do not exceed twice your level, or

at least one creature regardless of HD.

If there are more potential targets than

you can affect, you choose them one

at a time until you choose a creature

with too many HD.

You gain a limited ability to discern a

successful path for your actions. For

the  duration  of  the  spell,  any  time

you make an attack roll, skill check,

ability  check,  or  saving  throw,  you

may  roll  twice  and  select  which  die

roll to use.

CITY LIGHTS

Level: City 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 60 ft.

Area: 60-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  temporarily  absorb  all  nearby

articial light and release it as a are.

Any articial light (including magical

and  mundane  sources)  ickers  out

momentarily,  then  a  burst  of  light

ares from you. All creatures within

the  area  (except  you)  are  blinded

for  1  round  if  they  fail  a  Fortitude

save; regardless of the saving throws

success,  all  creatures  in  the  area  are

dazzled for 1 minute. Afterward, the

lights  return  to  normal.  Sightless

creatures are unaffected.

The spell only functions if at least

four  active  articial  light  sources

(torches, lanterns, light spells, and so

forth) are within 60 feet of the caster.

The  spells  name  refers  to  its  most

common use (in well-lit city streets),

but it can function in any area with

sufcient lighting.

City  lights  counters  or  dispels  any

darkness spell of equal or lower level,

such as darkness.

Material  Component:  A  pinch  of

tinder.

(object)

This  spell  instantly  transports  you

from one community to a second des-

ignated community. Each community

must be at least as large as a small city

(see page 137 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide). The destination city may be as

distant  as  100  miles  per  caster  level.

Interplanar  travel  is  not  possible.

You  can  bring  along  objects  as  long

as  their  weight  doesnt  exceed  your

maximum  load.  You  may  also  bring

along one additional willing Medium

or smaller creature (carrying gear or

objects up to its maximum load) or its

equivalent (see below) per three caster

levels. A Large creature counts as two

Medium  creatures,  a  Huge  creature

counts as two Large creatures, and so

forth. All creatures to be transported

must be in contact with one another,

and at least one of those creatures must

be in contact with you. Only objects

held or in use (attended) by another

person receive saving throws and spell

resistance.

You must have visited the destina-

tion  city  at  some  point  in  the  past.

You do not have precise control over

your  arrival  point;  you  appear  at  a

randomly  determined  safe  location

within  the  borders  of  the  city  (not

within a building).

Material Component: A chip of city

stone or brick from the selected des-

tination.

If  you  are  not  within  100  feet  of  a

spell has no effect. If you move more

than  100  feet  from  the  community

before the duration elapses, the spells

effect ends immediately. For example,

you  could  retain  the  effect  while

adventuring within the citys sewers,

would end the effect.

COMMUNE WITH CITY

Divination

Level: City 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Instantaneous

You  become  one  with  a  community

that you are in, attaining knowledge

of the surrounding community. You

instantly gain knowledge of as many

as three facts from among the follow-

ing  subjects:  the  population  of  the

community, the dominant race within

the community and the percentage of

the  population  it  encompasses,  any

given  races  percentage  of  the  total

population,  the  level  of  the  highest-

level  character  in  a  given  class,  the

type  and  alignment  of  one  of  the

communitys  power  centers  (if  the

community  has  more  than  one,  roll

randomly),  a  signicant  economic

factor affecting trade within the city,

or a major news item within the city

(see  Gather  Information,  page  74  of

the Players Handbook).

DELAY DEATH

Necromancy

Level: Cleric 3, Destiny 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject of this powerful spell is

unable to die from hit point damage.

While  under  the  protection  of  this

spell, the normal limit of 9 hit points

before  a  character  dies  is  extended

without limit. A condition or spell that

destroys enough of the subjects body

to prohibit raise dead (such as a disinte-

grate effect) still kills the creature, as

does  death  brought  about  by  ability

score damage or drain, level drain, or

a death effect.

The  spell  does  not  prevent  the

subject from entering the dying state

by dropping to 1 hit points. It merely

prevents death as a result of hit point

loss.

If  the  subject  has  fewer  than  9

hit  points  when  the  spells  duration

expires, he or she dies instantly.

DISCERN BLOODLINE

Divination

Level: Bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, M

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature per round

Duration: Concentration, up to 1

round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster can instantly tell the race

of  the  targeted  individual,  plus  any

inherited templates possessed by the

target (such as celestial or half-dragon).

Each  round  that  the  caster  remains

concentrating  he  can  determine

the  race  and  inherited  templates  of

another target.

FRIENDLY FACE

Illusion (Glamer)

Level: Bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 min./level (D)

You subtly change your appearance so

that it seems particularly friendly to

the viewer. You gain a +5 circumstance

bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Infor-

mation checks made to inuence or

gain information from creatures with

Intelligence scores of 3 or higher, as

long as those creatures arent already

hostile toward you.

This  spell  does  not  alter  your

appearance in any signicant way, and

thus provides no bonus on Disguise

checks.

INSIGNIA OF ALARM

Abjuration

Level: Bard 2, cleric 2, paladin 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: 400 ft. + 40 ft./level spread,

centered on you

Target: All wearers of special insig-

nia within range

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  alerts  all  wearers  of  a

specic  insignia  (see  below)  within

range.  Such  creatures  hear  a  single

mental ping (as the alarm spell, page

197 of the Players Handbook) when this

spell is cast.

This spell requires signicant prepa-

ration.  Before  using  this  spell  you

must forge specially crafted insignias.

These  can  be  crafted  in  the  form  of

amulets, badges, rings, or any similar

object,  but  each  one  must  bear  the

same  logo,  crest,  or  symbol.  Each

insignia costs 10 gp. Militias, guilds,

or churches within a city use this spell

to call all its members together.

Focus: A specially prepared insignia

(see above).

INSIGNIA OF BLESSING

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-

Affecting]

Level: Cleric 3, paladin 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell functions just like insignia

of alarm except that the insignia wear-

ers are also lled with courage. Each

insignia  wearer  gains  a  +1  morale

bonus  on  attack  rolls  and  on  saving

throws against fear effects.

INSIGNIA OF HEALING

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Bard 3, cleric 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will half (harm-

less); see text

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless);

see text

This  spell  works  just  like  insignia  of

alarm except the insignia wearers are

instead healed by positive energy. The

spell  cures  1d8  points  of  damage  +1

point per caster level (maximum +10)

to all wearers of the insignia.

Since undead are powered by nega-

tive energy, this spell deals damage to

them instead of curing their wounds.

Any undead creature can apply spell

resistance and attempt a Will save to

take half damage.

INSIGNIA OF WARDING

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 3, paladin 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  works  just  like  insignia  of

alarm except the insignia wearers also

gain a +1 divine bonus to AC and on

Fortitude saves.

LOCATE CITY

Divination

Level: Bard 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/

wizard 1

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: 10 miles/level

Area: 10 miles/level radius circle,

centered on you

Duration: Instantaneous

You  sense  the  distance  and  direc-

tion  to  the  nearest  community  of  a

minimum  size  designated  by  you  at

the time of casting. For instance, you

could choose to nd the nearest com-

munity at least as large as a village, or

you  could  choose  to  locate  only  the

nearest metropolis.

This  spell  measures  the  distance

to  the  nearest  community  as  the

minimum distance one would have to

travel to reach the city without moving

through solid objects. Thus, a caster

on the surface isnt likely to locate a

subterranean city half a mile beneath

his feet, even if the next closest com-

munity is 5 miles away overland.

OMEN OF PERIL

Divination

Level: Cleric 1, Destiny 1, druid 1

Components: V, F

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Instantaneous

A brief supplication grants you a vision

that hints at how dangerous the imme-

diate future is likely to be. Based on an

assessment of the casters immediate

surroundings and likely path of travel,

the caster receives one of three visions:

safety, peril, or great danger.

The  base  chance  for  receiving  an

accurate reply is 70% + 1% per caster

level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM

makes the roll secretly.

If the omen of peril is successful, you

receive one of three eeting visions:

Safety: The caster isnt in any imme-

diate danger. If he continues on his

present course (or remains where he

is  if  hes  been  stationary  for  some

time before casting the spell), hell

face no signicant monsters, traps,

or challenges for the next hour or

so.

Peril: The caster will face challenges

typical of an adventure: challenging

but  not  overwhelming  monsters,

dangerous traps, and other hazards

for the next hour or so.

Great danger: The casters very life

is at grave risk. He will likely face

powerful NPCs or deadly traps in

the next hour.

If  the  roll  fails,  you  receive  one  of

the  other  two  results,  determined

randomly by the DM, and you dont

necessarily know you failed because

the DM rolls secretly.

Choosing which vision is correct

takes  some  educated  guesswork  on

the part of the DM, who should assess

the partys likely courses of action and

what dangers theyre likely to face.

The  form  that  an  omen  of  peril

takes depends on whether the caster

worships  a  specic  deity,  venerates

nature as a druid, or simply upholds

abstract principles. A druid might see

a white dove for safety, a dark cloud

obscuring  the  sun  for  peril,  and  a

forest re for great danger. A cleric

of Fharlanghn might see a vision of

a straight road for safety, a crossroads

for peril, and a washed-out bridge for

great danger.

Unlike the more powerful augury,

an omen of peril doesnt respond to a

specic  question.  It  only  indicates

the level of danger likely for the next

hour, not what form the danger will

take.

Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones,

or  similar  tokens  of  at  least  25  gp

value.

PHANTOM GUARDIANS

Illusion (Figment)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S, M

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if

ROOFTOP STRIDER

interacted with)

Spell Resistance: No

This spell creates the illusion of one

or more Small or Medium gures of

a chosen humanoid race. Each gure

is effectively a minor image, and can

appear dressed in any way the caster

chooses. When the spell is cast, each

gure is given a brief set of orders to

follow for the spells duration, such as

walk back and forth along that wall

or stand by this gate. The orders can

be  different  for  each  gure.  These

instructions  cant  be  changed  later.

The  illusory  gures  cant  speak  or

react  to  their  surroundingsthey

are typically used to scare off would-

be  intruders  (as  the  spells  name

suggests).

Material  Component:  A  piece  of

charcoal.

PROUD ARROGANCE

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

level)

Target: One creature/level, no two

of which can be more than 30 ft.

apart

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  lets  a  group  of  creatures

resist effects that convince them they

should  not  be  following  their  pres-

ent  course  of  action.  The  creatures

affected  gain  a  +4  resistance  bonus

on saves against charm, compulsion,

and fear effects.

The proud arrogance spell only func-

tions for creatures of the same race as

the  caster.  In  other  words,  a  human

wizard  casting  the  spell  can  target

only humans with it.

Material  Component:  A  piece  of

polished brass.

Transmutation

Level: Assassin 1, City 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

all Jump checks to clear a horizontal

distance of 5 feet or less. You do not

need  to  make  Balance  checks  for

running or charging across a sloped

surface.

Components: V, S, M, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Duration: Concentration, up to 1

round/level

With this spell you can touch a book

or  scroll  and  absorb  the  knowledge

contained  within  as  if  you  had  just

read  it.  This  is  equivalent  to  a  solid

reading  but  not  deep  studythe

character does not gain perfect recall

of the information, just whatever he

would  have  gotten  from  reading  it

completely once. If you cant read the

language of the source, the spell has

no  effect.  This  spell  cannot  be  used

to  prepare  spells  or  to  cast  magical

scrolls,  nor  does  it  have  any  effect

when  reading  a  magical  book  (such

as a tome of understanding).

Material  Component:  A  scrap  of

given to each new shadow guardian,

the  caster  can  give  each  guardian  a

simple trigger that causes it to attack,

such  as  attack  anyone  approaching

within 30 feet or attack anyone not

wearing  these  colors.  The  shadow

guardians  have  no  special  visual

the like can easily fool them.

The  shadow  guardians  deal  normal

only 50% normal

damage.

This spell allows the target to enter a

binding agreement with a deity, who

provides a measure of protection when

the need is dire.

Once  this  spell  is  cast,  the  pact

remains  dormant  until  the  target

is  reduced  to  fewer  than  half  of  her

full  normal  hit  points.  The  target

immediately  gains  5  temporary  hit

points per caster level, damage reduc-

tion 5/magic, and a +4 luck bonus on

saving throws. The hit points, damage

reduction,  and  saving  throw  bonus

disappear when the spell ends.

This  spell  functions

as unseen servant, ex-

you  may  cast  this  spell  to  reroll  the

save, but with an insight bonus equal

to your caster level (maximum +20).

Alternatively,  if  you  are  struck  in

combat  you  can  apply  the  insight

bonus to your AC against the attack

(even  if   at-footed);  if  your  new  AC

exceeds  the  attack  roll,  the  attack

misses you.

Casting this spell has a side effect:

until the start of your next turn, you

take a 4 penalty on all saving throws

and to your AC.

The  subject  suddenly  feels  as  if  the

walls of the city are closing in around

him.  If  the  subject  fails  a  Will  save,

he believes he is trapped in a maze of

narrow city alleys that twist and turn

in circles. The subject remains in his

current  location,  but  is  effectively

stunned as long as the spell lasts. Each

round at the end of his turn, the sub-

ject may attempt a DC 15 Intelligence

effect. If the subject takes any damage,

the spell immediately ends.

The  spell  must  be  cast  in  a  com-

order.

ANTICIPATORY STRIKE

REALIZED POTENTIAL

Psychoportation

Level: Psion/wilder 2

Display: Auditory

Manifesting Time: 1 immediate

action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Instantaneous

Power Points: 3

You  take  your  normal  action  for  the

round at the time that you manifest this

power, rather than waiting for your turn

to come up in the initiative sequence. In

subsequent  rounds,  your  place  in  the

initiative order does not changeyou

anticipate  your  action  for  this  round

only. You can take a standard action and

a move action, or a full-round action, just

as  you  could  if  you  were  taking  your

action at your normal place in initiative

order. You cant activate this power if

youre at-footed, and you cant use the

power  a  second  time  until  after  your

next turn has passed.

For  example,  if  you  normally  act

on initiative count 15, you could use

this power to take your turn again on

initiative  count  12,  but  this  means

that you wouldnt be able to act on the

next rounds initiative count 15 (since

youve already used that turns actions),

and  you  wouldnt  be  able  to  use  the

power again until after your next turn

(that is, after the next rounds initiative

count 15).

Augment: If you spend 2 additional

power points, your place in the initia-

tive order changes, much as if you had

delayed (but you may move earlier in

the initiative order rather than later).

Power Points: 5

The target receives a vision of her own

Augment: If you spend 2 additional

In  effect,  you  can  take  your  normal

move action and then take any standard

depending on how events unfold.

you  choose  during  the  next  round.

Unlike  the  normal  use  of  readied

Augment: If you spend 8 additional

power points, you can walk normally

on  any  city  surface  as  if  it  were

even clothes-drying lines. Your speed

remains unchanged, even when walk-

n  campaigns where humans are the most populous

of the races, basing an adventure among the lands

of humanity works pretty much as described in the

Dungeon Masters Guide. Humans are social creatures

who  prefer  living  in  communities  with  others  of  their

kind, although loners, homesteaders, and explorers who

live far from the rest of their kind are common as well.

This chapter provides advice on breathing more life and

variety  into  the  numerous  communities  that  humans

and their kind call home. Towns are broken down in to

their component parts, letting the DM tailor each town

to his liking. This chapter also provides numerous sample

NPCs from a wide variety of challenge ratings, including

several  low-level  but  ubiquitous  NPC  classes  that  make

up the bulk of human townsaristocrats, commoners,

experts, and warriors.

Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide provides guide-

lines  for  randomly  generating  communities  of  various

sizes and levels. In most cases, these rules work best when

creating  average  communities,  primarily  dominated  by

humans and their kin. Provided here are rules for creating

even more variety and detail in a given area or town.

The rules in the Dungeon Masters Guide reect the fact

that humans are the most common race living in cities. In

addition, these towns try to emulate the pseudo-medieval

feel of the genre, in which peasants work the land, millers

make the our, merchants haggle in the streets, and city

guards keep an eye out for trouble.

However, theres nothing stopping you from altering

the way in which humans, and the towns in which they

live,  operate.  Terrain  is  a  major  factor  in  how  towns

come  into  being  and  evolve.  A  town  located  on  an

oasis  in  the  middle  of  the  desert,  for  instance,  looks

and acts differently from one in the foothills of a lofty

mountain range. Your imagination is the limit when

it  comes  to  deciding  how  an  exotic  human  culture

would construct its town.

ELEMENTS OF A TOWN

Humans and their kind are noted for living in close-

knit communities. Most cultures create permanent

communities that combine houses, shops, places of

worship, inns, and all the other structures that one

would expect.

Larger settlements are divided up into neigh-

borhoods, or districts, that cater to a particular

segment of the population, trade, racial group, or

some other division. In general, a town boasts one

district  per  1,000  people  in  its  population  (thus,

171

communities  smaller  than  a  small  town  do  not  have

separate districts). For each 1,000 people in a town, roll on

Table 81 below to determine what sort of districts exist.

You can deal with duplicate rolls in one of three ways. First,

you may choose to reroll duplicate or inappropriate rolls.

Second, duplicate rolls presume that the town has a much

larger district of that type for its size. Third, duplicate rolls

may indicate that the town has multiple districts of the

same type, located in different parts of town. For instance,

if you roll foreign district three times, you may decide that

the town hosts three different foreign cultures.

If the same result comes up three or more times, assume

that the town is famous for a given kind of district and prob-

ably derives a major portion of the towns economy from

that district. Each of these kinds of districts can appear in

any sort of town, regardless of alignment or power center,

with some exceptions. If the towns power center is magi-

cal (see Power Center

for  the  Community,

page 137 of the Dungeon Masters Guide), then at least one

of the districts must be either a temple or wizard district

(depending on the type of power center).

Because most people live close to (or in) the same place

that they work, it should be assumed that each district has

an adequate number of houses or living quarters, along

with individual shops, food stalls, inns, and services

that cater to the population. In general, 50% to 70% of

any settlement is devoted to residential buildings. The

size and composition of a particular district is up to the

DM. In addition, feel free to add additional types of

districts that you feel appropriate, such as docks or

wharfs (which have been left out to keep the table

as generic as possible).

Each district described below includes a list of

sample encounters that are likely to occur when

the adventurers are present. For more information,

see Urban Encounters, page 101 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide.

One of many busy streets in the arcane district

Merchant District: The merchant district is lled with

stores, shops, and bazaars, owned by sellers who hawk all

manner of goods. This area is usually thronging with people

during the day and virtually vacant at night, with patrols

of city guard and private watchmen keeping vandals and

petty thieves from causing too much mayhem. In smaller

cities, the merchant district is indistinguishable from the

artisan district, with craftsfolk selling their goods from the

stalls and shops in which the products are made.

Typical  Encounters:  Animal,  bullies,  employment  offer,

re,  found  item,  guards  need  help,  lost  child,  muggers,

pickpockets,  robbery  in  progress,  spectacle,  spell  gone

awry.

Military District: The military district is the site of a

large fort, castle, keep, armory, parade ground, and other

structures  dedicated  to  supporting  the  towns  militia  or

army. These districts are commonly walled off, even within

the city proper, and designed with defense in mind. This

district has a much higher percentage of city guards and

soldiers, although the exact amount depends on the size

of the military in the town. Strangers and those without a

good reason to be in the area are actively discouraged from

entering it.

Typical Encounters: Admirer, construction accident, duel/

mageduel in progress, employment offer, escaped prisoner,

guard harassment, guards need help, spectacle.

Noble  District:  The  noble  district  is  lled  with  the

homes of the towns elite. The houses in this area are large

Arcane District: This district holds a high concentra-

tion  of  adepts,  sorcerers,  wizards,  and  alchemists.  Stores

lled with material components for spells line the streets

and magic items are sold to those with the money to pay

for  them.  To  the  untrained  eye,  arcane  districts  may  be

indistinguishable  from  university  districts,  since  many

arcane districts host schools and academies that teach the

art of magic. If the town has a magical power center, the

arcane district will typically be the most powerful district

within its walls.

Typical Encounters: Duel/mageduel in progress, prominent

personage, spell gone awry.

Artisan  Quarter:  This  quarter  boasts  the  majority  of

the towns blacksmiths, cobblers, wheelwrights, and other

craftsfolk  who  make  the  communitys  goods.  In  smaller

settlements,  artisans  sell  their  wares  directly  from  their

shops, while larger cities may allow artisans to move their

goods to the merchant district (see below) for sale. Artisans

are typically divided up even further into guildsgroups

of likeminded craftsfolk who set dened prices for goods

in relation to labor.

Typical  Encounters:  Construction  accident,  contest  in

progress, employment offer, found item, guard harassment,

overturned/runaway cart, robbery in progress.

Foreign District: The foreign district is normally only

found  in  the  larger  settlements  (typically  small  cities  or

larger)  or  in  smaller  towns  that  interact  with  a  foreign

people. The district is fully integrated in the society, but

retains  a  distinct  cultural  avor  that  is  notably  different

from the town that hosts it. In the largest of cities (large

city or metropolis), newcomers to the city frequently nd

their way to the foreign district of their homeland and are

encouraged to live there if the group they belong to is not

held in high regard.

In smaller cities, a foreign district may be indistinguish-

able from a racial district, especially if one racial group is

more prevalent than others. Most foreign districts, however,

cater to a specic human society, with its own language (or

dialect), customs, foods, and, in some cases, laws.

Typical Encounters: Brawl/street ght/gang war in progress,

bullies, contest in progress, guard harassment, mistaken

identity, muggers, spectacle.

and well furnished, and the area is lled with restaurants,

shops selling ne and exotic wares, theaters, and other places

that cater to the upper classes. This district is typically well

patrolled, especially at night, with double the usual number

of city guards.

Typical Encounters: Contest in progress, employment offer,

found item, guard harassment, mistaken identity, monster,

muggers,  pickpockets,  prominent  personage,  robbery  in

progress, spectacle, spell gone awry.

Racial  District:  Similar  to  foreign  districts,  racial

districts  are  areas  that  hold  a  large  concentration  of  one

particular  race,  such  as  elves,  gnomes,  or  dwarves.  This

district encompasses many of the elements of all the districts

described  here,  with  a  sampling  of  temples,  merchants,

artisans and the like, all focusing on the particular demands

and tastes of the race in question. A racial district typically

has unusual architecture that ensures its buildings stand

out from the buildings surrounding the district. If racial

tensions are high in the community, racial districts may feel

more like armed encampments, with strangers getting the

cold shoulder or worse.

Typical Encounters: Brawl/street ght/gang war in progress,

bullies, contest in progress, guard harassment, mistaken

identity, muggers, spectacle.

Temple District: The temple district hosts a large number

of temples, churches, and places of worship. Depending on

the town, the temple district may hold a wide variety of faiths,

or a large number of temples of varying size dedicated to a

single deity. Many of these temples serve as seminaries where

students can learn the wisdom of their faith. As expected,

the temple district has a much higher percentage of clerics

(and adepts or druids) than the rest of the city.

Typical Encounters: Admirer, brawl/street ght/gang war

in progress, bullies, contest in progress, employment offer,

guard harassment, lost child, mistaken identity, prominent

personage, spectacle, spell gone awry.

Thieves District: The thieves district boasts the major-

ity of the towns brothels, taverns, and other places of ill

repute. All manner of illegal activities may be found here,

including  gambling,  prostitution,  stolen  goods,  and  the

like. As the name denotes, thieves, pickpockets, con men,

and criminals of all sorts walk the streets looking for easy

prey. A prosperous or ourishing thieves district may simply

indicate that the town is much more open and liberal in its

interpretation of entertainment, catering to the vices of the

people in the name of commerce.

Typical Encounters: Animal, brawl/street ght/gang war

in  progress,  bullies,  construction  accident,  contest  in

progress, corpse, duel/mageduel in progress, employment

offer, escaped prisoner, re, found item, guard harassment,

mistaken identity, monster, muggers, overturned/runaway

cart, pickpockets, robbery in progress, spell gone awry.

University District: The university district holds several

places of higher learning, as well as libraries, scribe services,

and academies. In smaller cities, the university district may

be considered part of or afliated with the temple district

(focusing on theology) or the arcane district (with a focus

on arcana and esoteric lore).

Typical Encounters: Admirer, contest in progress, employ-

ment  offer,  found  item,  lost  child,  mistaken  identity,

pickpockets,  prominent  personage,  spectacle,  spell  gone

awry.

District Prosperity

As not all towns are created equal, neither are individual

districts within a city. To determine the economic status of

a particular district, roll on Table 82 below.

Terrible

Table 82: District Prosperity

d10  District Prosperity

1

23  Struggling

47  Average

89  Prosperous

Flourishing

10

Terrible:  The  district  is  in  utter  disrepair,  completely

destitute, or entirely riddled with crime and corruption.

Buildings are either abandoned or in serious need of repair

and only fools would venture out onto the streets at night.

Businesses in this district carry a pathetic range of goods

or cater only to hard-luck cases or criminals.

In the cases of areas that are normally not associated with

such conditions, you can assume that a calamity has stricken

174

the district. For example, rolling the terrible result for a

noble district may indicate that some sort of social upheaval

has taken place, with a majority of the houses being looted

and burned by the masses.

Struggling:  The  district  is  undergoing  an  economic

downturn,  suffers  from  graft  and  corruption,  or  has  a

general  lack  of  qualied  people  to  run  its  primary  busi-

ness. Thieves and criminals are common in these districts,

although they keep their activities relatively covert to avoid

the occasional city guard or private mercenary forces that

sometimes wander the streets.

Average: The district is normal in most respects, produc-

ing typical volumes of goods (or whatever is appropriate)

and is neither particularly rich nor poor. Goods and services

can be found for the prices listed in the Players Handbook

and Dungeon Masters Guide. Crime is at an average level and

most inhabitants are not too worried, but try not to nd

themselves alone in an alleyway at night.

Prosperous:  The  district  is  particularly  well  off  and

boasts ne buildings, a healthy income (as per the citys

general income), and a respected (or infamous) reputation.

Arcane, temple, and university districts are well known for

their education, merchant districts have a ne array of goods

for sale, and artisan districts produce excellent goods that

fetch a handsome price. In the case of seedier districts, such

as thieves districts, the area is probably under the thrall of

organized crime, which imposes its own rules and justice,

keeping the streets (relatively) safe so that the average rube

may be parted with his money at a faster pace. A prosperous

district is a good indicator of the primary industry or service

that the town provides.

Flourishing:  The  district  is  extremely  successful,

wildly popular, or undergoing some sort of boom. Noble

districts are noted for their extravagant wealth, foreign

districts have a powerful sway on the citys government

and  culture,  and  military  districts  feature  well-stocked

and well-funded fortresses full of soldiers and armaments,

indicating  the  militarys  inuence  on  the  populace.  A

ourishing  district  is  one  of  the  main  attributes  that

denes a town.

COMMUNITY ATTRIBUTES

While the Dungeon Masters Guide provides rules for generat-

ing random towns, it still leaves several important aspects

open to interpretation. The following tables provide bene-

cial and negative attributes that can give the town its own

unique avor, as well as generating ideas for adventures.

You can either choose to give a community an attribute or

roll randomly for the result.

Beneficial Attributes

These attributes represent events or improvements that have

a positive effect on the general populace.

Artist Haven: The community has a larger percentage

of  artists,  performers,  and  craftsfolk  who  produce  ne

quality artwork. Characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus

on all Perform checks as well as Craft checks that produce

items of beauty and art, thanks to the open-minded and

supportive populace.

If large enough, the town has at least one artisan, mer-

chant, or foreign district.

Blessed: The community has received a blessing from a

positive and benecial deity. Crops are plentiful, and food

costs 1d610% less than the price listed in the Players Hand-

book. The default NPC attitude toward strangers is friendly,

unless the strangers are obviously hostile (see Inuencing

NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Players Handbook).

Center of Learning: The community has a multitude of

organizations and buildings dedicated to higher learning.

The populace has a higher rate of literacy than the norm, as

well as a greater percentage of wizards, sorcerers, and clerics.

Books and scrolls (including magical ones) are available at

a 1d310% reduced rate.

If large enough, the town has at least one arcane, temple,

or university district, or a combination of all three.

Cosmopolitan Society: The towns population is par-

ticularly diverse and well integrated, inspiring an inux

of  new  ideas,  open-mindedness,  and  tolerance  toward

strangers. The town is automatically an integrated racial

mix  (see  Racial  Demographics,  page  139  of  the  Dungeon

Masters  Guide).  The  default  NPC  attitude  toward  anyone

If  large  enough,  the  town  has  at  least  one  arcane,

artisan, or temple district.

Magically Advanced: The town has a higher number of

spellcasters than normal, some of whom have discovered

new magical techniques, or the community is situated

in a place that is magically active. Any time an

arcane spell is cast, there is a 5% chance that

the spell is treated as if the caster level were

one level higher.

If  large  enough,  the  town  includes  at

least one arcane or temple district.

Military Stronghold: The town has

a  particularly  large,  well-stocked,  and

well-trained  standing  militia  or  army.

The town boasts at least one armory, fort,

or other defensive building in excellent

condition. Weapons and armor, includ-

ing magical ones, can be purchased for

1d310% less than the prices listed in the

Players Handbook or the Dungeon Masters

Guide.

If  large  enough,  the  town  has  at  least

one military district.

Pilgrimage  Destination:  The  town  is

a sacred spot or hosts a religious festival that

draws  the  faithful  from  distant  lands.  While

the  town  may  have  temples  to  other  deities,

the  town  is  dedicated  to  one  in  particular.  The

town  boasts  a  particularly  venerated  location

such as a temple, the site of a martyrs death, or a

statue of a saint. The default NPC attitude toward

members  of  the  faith  is  friendly,  and  unfriendly

toward members of an opposing faith (see

In uencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the

Players Handbook).

If large enough, the town has at least one temple district.

Tourist Destination: The town sits in an area of natural

beauty, has a curious monument or festival, or some other

attribute that draws tourists from far and wide to see it. The

town draws most of its income from catering to the tour-

ists and sightseers who come to visit, boasting more inns,

taverns, and shops than the norm. The gp limit of the town

increases by one category (see Generating Towns, page 137

of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

If large enough, the town includes at least one foreign or

thieves district.

Trade Center: The town is a center for trade in the region

and has large stockpiles of goods for sale. The amount of

ready cash in the community increases to 3/4 its gp limit

 1/10 its population. In addition, choose three different

types of goods, such as weapons, armor, foodstuffs, textiles,

or  other  broad  categories.  The  cost  for  purchasing  those

types of items is reduced by 1d310%.

If  large  enough,  the  town  has  at  least  one  artisan  or

merchant district.

For many performers, an audience of one is enough

is indifferent (see In uencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of

the Players Handbook), regardless of race, creed, or religion.

This applies even if the neighboring locale has a different

attitude toward any given race, creed, or religion.

If large enough, the town has at least one foreign or racial

district.

Economic  Boom:  The  community  is  undergoing  an

upsurge in its economy, due to enhanced trade, demand for

goods, or savvy brokering by its merchants. The amount of

ready cash in the community increases to its full gp limit

 1/10 its population.

Innovative Breakthrough: The town has discovered

some new technology, technique, or long-forgotten craft that

provides a boon to one particular aspect of the community.

For instance, the town has recently created a printing press

that allows mass production of texts, or a magical technique

that gives boosts to healing magic. This breakthrough has

not yet made its way known to the rest of the world and may

be a jealously guarded secret.

sidents are being rounded up, and commodities, such as

weapons, armor, and foodstuffs, have been commandeered.

The soldier in charge is the highest-level  ghter in the com-

munity.  Adventurers  must  either  join  the  military  or  be

considered potential enemies of the state.

Plague Ravaged: A deadly disease is running rampant

throughout the town. Choose one of the following contact

or inhaled diseases: cackle fever, mind re, shakes, or slimy

doom (see Disease, page 292 of the Dungeon Masters Guide);

1d810% of the population is infected with this disease. As a

result, most of the populace remains indoors and away from

strangers. There is a 50% chance that the local military has

quarantined the town, limiting or  denying access both into

and out of the af icted area.

Racial  Tension:  The  town  is  mired  in  deep  tension

between two or more races of its population. The default

attitude between these races is unfriendly or hostile (see

In uencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Players Hand-

book).  Harsh  words  and  segregation  are  the  norm,  along

with beatings, lynchings, and clashes in the street.

Religious Tension: A deep religious divide affects the

town, either between two different religions or a schism

occurring within the dominant faith of the community.

Characters of one of the chosen beliefs (or sect of a single

belief) are readily accepted by those of the same creed, but

will be expected to denounce rival factions.

Severe  Seasons:  The  seasons  in  the  region  have

produced  harsh  and  unpredictable  weather,  disrupting

farming and causing all manner of problems. The type

of weather depends on the terrain and temperature of the

Famine can destroy the

body and the spirit

Negative Attributes

These  attributes  represent  elements  that  have  a  negative

effect on the general populace.

Crime Wave: The town is under the grip of a terrible

crime  wave  due  to  organized  crime,  roving  bandits,  or

simply an anarchic society. Citizens are wary about going

out at night and are immediately suspicious of strangers.

The  default  NPC  attitude  is  unfriendly  (see  In uencing

NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Players Handbook).

Cursed: The town has been af icted with a terrible curse,

causing great misfortune and woe. The effects of the curse

is up to the DM; here are some suggestions:

All male children die before the age of 3.

Those who do not give offerings to a particular well fall

ill and perish within a month.

The  townsfolk  have  fallen  prey  to  lycanthropy,  which

seems to manifest without warning.

On the  rst day of the new year, the townsfolk are over-

come with bloodlust, attacking anyone who does not live

in the village.

Economically Depressed: Due to severed trade routes,

poor business decisions, or the loss of the primary source of

income, the town is undergoing a severe economic depres-

sion. The amount of ready cash in the community decreases

to one-quarter its gp limit  1/10 its population. All goods

increase in price by 2d1010%.

Famine:  Due  to  poor  weather,  war,  drought,   ood,  or

other bad fortune, there is not enough food in the town

to sustain the population. Foodstuffs increase in price by

2d1010%, if they are available at all. Most or all the popu-

lace is suffering the effects of starvation (see Starvation and

Thirst, page 304 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Magically Repressed: Arcane spellcasters are regarded

with deep suspicion and distrust in this     town. The default

attitude  toward  arcane  spellcasters  is  unfriendly  (see

In uencing  NPC  Attitudes,  page  72  of

the Players Handbook). Optionally,

the town sits in an area in

which magic works errati-

cally,  with  spells  failing

10% of time.

Military

Coup: A coup

has occurred

in the town,

which is

now  un-

der the

control of

an  oppres-

sive  military

regime. Heavily

armed  soldiers  roam  the

streets.  Every  able-bodied  man  is

being  conscripted  into  the  military,  dis-

location of townheat wave, torrential rains, unseason-

able cold, or some other adverse weather. Food supplies

are low, increasing the price by 1d1010%, and at least 10%

of the populace is suffering the effects of starvation or

thirst (see Starvation and Thirst, page 304 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

War Ravaged: The community has been devastated by

war. The outer buildings of the town have been burned or

seriously damaged, major infrastructure is in disrepair, and

a shortage of basic services and food grips the community.

The population has been reduced by one category for its size.

For instance, a large town has the population of a small town,

although this number does not drop below the population

of a hamlet (which will have its base population reduced by

half). All goods that have not been looted increase in price

by 2d610%. The populace is extremely wary and guarded

against strangers. The default NPC attitude is unfriendly

(see  Inuencing  NPC  Attitudes,  page  72  of  the  Players

Handbook), increasing to hostile toward anyone afliated

with the offending government, race, or other group that

attacked the town.

CITYFOLK

More than any other race, humans and their ilk are associ-

ated with cities. Those who choose to reside in cities prefer

more people than they can count all around them, speaking

every  language  known  and  a  few  that  arent.  They  enjoy

seeing new sights, hearing new sounds, and encountering

new ideas and toolsall without leaving the comfort of

home. They hate the smell of manure and grass or the quiet

of an open eld. They feel oddly vulnerable when no one

else is around, and insignicant if they can see the entire

night sky at once. Strength is in numbers, and comfort lies

in thick walls and close-grouped buildings.

These are the cityfolk. The term was rst used by farmers

and villagers to describe people who lived in large cities.

The  term  originated  as  an  insult,  implying  that  people

who had no sense and no skill and could not live on their

own  or  make  an  honest  living  from  their  own  toil.  But

the city-dwellers heard the term and were delighted by it.

After all, it describes them perfectly. They have different

jobs, different skills, different interests and origins, but all

share one traitthey all live in the city, and wouldnt live

anywhere else.

OCCUPATIONS

Cityfolk normally fall into one of four occupation categories:

laborers, craftsfolk, professionals, and merchants.

Laborers occupy the lowest rung on the economic ladder.

These  hard-working individuals  keep  society owing by

hauling goods through town, cleaning the streets, toiling

in workshops, and the like. They eke out a living making a

handful of silver pieces per week.

Craftsfolk  create  boots,  weapons,  doorknobs,  and  any-

thing else their neighbors need (or at least want to buy). They

may be builders, repairing old houses and constructing new

ones. They may be alchemists, brewing strange concoctions

in dark alleyway shops. Depending on their craft and talent,

they may take in anything from a few silver pieces to several

gold pieces per day, and they occupy the lower-middle to

middle class.

The broad category of professionals includes sages, bards,

barristers,  animal  trainers,  healers,  teachers,  priests,  and

even  warriors-for-hire.  These  individuals  sell  their  own

skills  rather  than  creating  products  for  purchase.  Like

craftsfolk, their income varies dramatically based on their

SAMPLE TOWN AND DISTRICTS

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Heres an example of how to use the information provided here

to  create  a  unique  town,  complete  with  a  general  idea  of  its

component parts.

Presented  here  is  the  community  of  Blackwell.  After  rolling

on  the  tables  provided  in  Generating  Towns,  page  137  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide, the DM determines that the town has

the following attributes.

Blackwell  (Large  Town):  Conventional;  NG;  3,000  gp;  Assets

600,000 gp; Population 4,000 (79% human, 9% halfling, 5% elf,

3% dwarf, 2% gnome, 1% half-elf, 1% half-orc).

district struggling, and the thieves district prosperous.

A roll on Table 83: Attributes determines that the town has

a negative attribute, and a roll on Table 85: Negative Attributes

reveals that the town is currently in the grip of severe seasons,

with food prices increased by a staggering 30%.

Armed with this information, the DM can now put explana-

tions to whats happening to the city. The severe seasons have

disrupted agriculture in the area, forcing the town to survive

by  importing  food  from  other  areas.  The  merchant  area  is

doing as well as it can (producing average wealth by compen-

sating for less food volume by increasing prices). While the

town has always had a large, dangerous thieves quarter, it is

doing particularly well these days, probably due to a thriving

black market, racketeering schemes, and the  despair of the

community  contributing  to  more  drinking,  gambling,  and

other  illicit  forms  of  entertainment.  The  towns  temple  dis-

trict is struggling, which the DM chalks up to the populaces

disgust with the local clergy not being able to deal with the

problem and a lack of faith in the deities. Temples have fewer

attendees, buildings are going without repairs, and clerics are

treated with much less respect in this hard-luck town.

The  town  has  four  distinct  districts  (one  district  per  1,000

people). The DM rolls four times on Table 81: Kinds of Districts,

and  the  results  include  a  merchant  district,  a  temple  district,

and two thieves districts. The DM decides to combine the two

thieves districts, creating a single particularly large district.

Rolling on Table 82: District Prosperity, the DM determines

that the merchant district is of average prosperity, the temple

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

skill set, but they usually occupy the middle to upper class

of the city.

The category of merchants includes all those who make

their  living  overseeing  the  exchange  of  goods  that  they

dont themselves create. Merchants buy from rural farmers,

craftsfolk, and professionals and sell to those willing to pay

the right price. They survive on the prots they make on

each sale. Merchants are the ultimate manifestation of the

city, existing only to put product and customer together in

an efcient manner. Successful merchants make up a large

portion of the middle class of the city.

Of course, not everyone ts into this

nice  picture.  Some  cityfolk

have  no  honest  occupation

at  all,  instead  mak-

ing  their  money

by  taking  from

others,  whether

they beg in the

streets,  mug

travelers,  steal

from  peoples

home s ,   or

charge  pro-

tection  from

craftsfolk.  This

category  of  city-

folk  is  the  most

loathed  by  rural

types,  since  they

have  no  respect

for those unwill-

ing to do a days

honest work.

SOCIAL

STATUS

Lineage  is  of  little

importance  to  cityfolk,

except as a source for stories. Adventur-

ers like cityfolks willingness to accept

anyone into their circle. Who you were before you arrived

does not matter, nor does what you did. All that matters is

that you are there now, and what you can do for the city as

a whole. Can you offer something the city wants or needs?

If so, youre welcome. If not, you either nd something you

can do, or you move on to a new community.

Since parentage does not matter, cityfolk use a different

measure to determine rank: property. This can mean land,

goods, or money, but the cityfolk with the most property

are considered civic leaders. Everyone wants to earn more

property, and so they turn to these leaders for advice. Since

civic  leaders  hold  the  most  property,  they  are  also  most

concerned with the welfare of the city. They organize their

fellow cityfolk to stamp out crime, expand marketplaces,

plant new parks, build new homes, and anything else that

needs doing. In cities where an ofcial city council exists,

most of the civic leaders have seats on it. For cities without

such a structure, they operate as an unofcial council, and

anyone who ignores their suggestions soon learns that the

civic leaders hold the real power within city limits. They can

stop shipments to someones store, refuse to buy a companys

goods, and suggest that students no longer take a teachers

classes.  A  respected  leader  can  encourage  people  to  do

what he thinks is best. Fortunately, the civic leaders really

do want whats best for the citythey just dont always care

what happens to their fellow cityfolk in the process.

ROLEPLAYING CITYFOLK

Cityfolk are not known for their combat skills, and

in truth most dont like to ght. That

does not make them easy targets,

however.  They

know  their

home  cit y

better  than

anyone  and

can  disap-

pear  down

an  alley  or

over a wall or

into  a  crowd

before  an  as-

sailant can blink.

Then  they  can  sum-

mon reinforcements and

cut the attacker off, hem-

ming  him  in  on  all  sides

and beating him by sheer

force of numbers.

Cityfolk want to know

everything  that  goes  on

in  their  city.  They  love  to

gossip,  and  news  of  a  strangers

arrival  can  travel  faster  than  the  person

himself,  particularly  if  he  has  money  or

could otherwise benet the city. Some offer themselves as

guides, both to show off their knowledge and to win favor

with the newcomer. Cityfolk know every good tavern and

inn in the city, and where to nd anything one wishes to

buy. They believe their behavior reects on the city itself,

so they do everything possible to be polite, friendly, and

helpful.

It is common for cityfolk to spend their entire lives in one

city. Those who leave almost always travel to other urban

centers, seeking new opportunities. Some move on because

their old city had too many practicers of a particular profes-

sion, and they look for a city that can offer them more work.

Others amass their funds and move to a new, smaller city

so they can be men of property there and become instant

For humans of different cultures,

language is often the largest barrier

civic leaders. Rarely do cityfolk leave for a small village or an

isolated farmhouse. The city is in their blood, and cityfolk

cannot live without it.

SAMPLE NPCS

The following NPCs include the individuals who the player

characters are likely to interact with, and they should make

it easier for you, as the DM, to design and run adventures

set in the various human lands.

The  NPCs  detailed  here  span  most  levels  of  play  and

ll the standard archetypes of most human-centric lands.

Although the NPCs described here have good or neutral

alignments, you can use them as foes by simply changing

the  alignments  and  alignment-related  abilities  (such  as

cleric domains).

SAMPLE HUMAN NPCS

The following human NPCs are representative of important

or ubiquitous roles in human society. This section provides

examples of the basic fabric of human society, including

court wizards, and the like. Some of these NPCs are not

heroic, but represent the individuals who form the backbone

of a given society.

Human Bandit (CR 1)

The human bandit is an opportunist, lying in wait along

highways and little-traveled roads, looking for easy prey. If

used as an ally, the bandit knows secret routes and the fastest

way through heavily guarded areas. If used as an antagonist,

the bandit is a common foe who uses hit-and-run tactics

along with the threat of death to earn a living. The human

bandits statistics can also be used for tough street thugs.

healing magic and substantial martial prowess, along with

the support of his congregation. As a foe, the curate can bring

with a sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed

for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

The  newly  released  Races  of  Destiny offers  players  and

DMs  many  new  options  for  their  games.  One  of  the

most  exciting  of  these  is  the  new  race  known  as  the

illumians. Devoted to knowledge and intrigue, the illu-

mians  organize  themselves  into  cabals  with  secret

motives  and  hidden  agendas.  This  short  scenario  pits

the adventurers against a group of illumians who have

devoted themselves to the dark arts of necromancy.

The Finalveil Cabal is a short D&D adventure for four

7th-level  player  characters  (PCs).  It  takes  place  in  and

around a small crypt complex protected by an illumian

cabal  known  as  the  Finalveil. As  always,  feel  free  to

adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make

it work with your campaign.

PREPARATION

You  (the  DM)  need  the  D&D  core  rulebooksthe

Players  Handbook, the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide,  and  the

Monster Manualas well as Races of Destinyto use this

adventure. The information presented here utilizes the

D&D v.3.5 rules.

To get started, print out the adventure, including the

map. Read through the scenario at least once to famil-

iarize  yourself  with  the  situation,  threats,  and  major

NPCs (particularly their motivations). Then review the

information  on  the  illumians  in  Races  of  Destiny. Text

that appears in shaded boxes is player information that

you can read aloud or paraphrase for the players at the

proper times. Monster and NPC statistics are provided

with  each  encounter  in  abbreviated  form  or,  where

appropriate,  the  proper  page  in  the  Monster  Manual is

referenced.

BACKGROUND

Illumian  cabals  are  hidden  organizations  that  pursue

their  individual  agendas  in  secret.  These  cabals  are

grouped into broad categories according to their goals

and  methods.  Those  that  use  undeath  as  a  means  of

preserving  knowledge  are  known  as  gravewhisper

cabals.

One  gravewhisper  cabal,  known  as  the  Finalveil

Cabal,  has  long  held  a  tome  of  great  power  called  the

Veiled  Codex in  one  of  its  crypts.  The  members  of  this

group  have  been  using  the  lore  from  this  ancient

volume to turn the eldest and most powerful members

of  the  cabal  into  undead  creatures,  thus  ensuring  that

death  cannot  rob  the  organization  of  talents  and

wisdom.  The  illumians  of  the  Finalveil  Cabal  regard

their  use  of  necromantic  magic  and  their  association

with undead creatures as pragmatic rather than evil

1

nothing more than a tool for the preservation of impor-

tant  knowledge.  They  devote  themselves  to  gathering

the necessary materials for these transformations and to

ensuring  that  the  organizations  existence  remains  a

secret.

Despite  their  efforts  to  keep  their  activities  hidden,

however, the members of the Finalveil have attracted a

number  of  powerful  enemies  over  the  centuries.

Several  good-aligned  churches,  having  learned  about

the  growing  number  of  undead  creatures  the  cabal  is

creating,  have  mounted  efforts  to  destroy  them.

Furthermore,  at  least  two  other  cabals  of  illumians

oppose  the  use  of  necromancy  as  a  tool,  despite  the

convenience  it  provides  in  the  preservation  of  impor-

tant  illumian  scholars.  Other  groups  too,  whether

knowingly or not, have worked to destroy the undead

creatures  within  the  Finalveil.  Unbeknownst  to  the

members  of  the  cabal,  these  enemies  have  gathered

important information about the group and the source

of its knowledge.

ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS

The  characters  must  penetrate  the  catacombs  of  the

Finalveil Cabal and retrieve the powerful tome known

as the Veiled Codex. Along the way, they must overcome

both  the  living  and  the  undead  servants  of  the  cabal.

Whatever  their  reasons  for  acquiring  the Veiled  Codex,

the  characters  earn  themselves  a  powerful  and  subtle

enemy  when  they  interfere  with  the  cabals  activities,

and  the  adventure  opens  up  the  possibility  of  a  long-

term campaign against the secretive illumians.

ADVENTURE HOOKS

As DM, you know best how to involve your PCs in an

adventure.  You  can  use  the  following  hooks  to  spur

your  imagination,  modifying  them  as  necessary  to  fit

your campaign or the characters.

The  Finalveil  Cabal  has  many  enemies,  none  of

whom are more vehement or violent than the other

illumian cabals. Most of these latter groups have more

noble purposes and more humane methods than the

sinister  Finalveil,  but  a  few  are  just  as  ruthless.

Because the player characters have already achieved a

small amount of fame for their exploits, one of these

illumian  cabals  seeks  them  out  and  openly  asks  for

their help in dealing with the Finalveil. This adven-

ture hook is an excellent way to introduce the secre-

tive  illumians  into  your  campaign.  For  a  more

intrigue-filled  variant,  you  can  have  another  cabal

with  darker  motives  contact  the  PCs.  This  tactic

makes  the  characters  unwitting  pawns  in  a  struggle

between two evil organizations.

Not all of the Finalveils enemies are illumians. Despite

their efforts at secrecy, the members of the Finalveil

have also attracted the enmity of several good-aligned

churches, any one of which might commission the PCs

to  recover  and/or  destroy  the Veiled  Codex.  Clerics

proposing such a mission might serve a nature god

such as Obad-Hai who abhors the unnatural presence

of the undead that the cabal creates, or a fierce god of

honorable confrontation such as St. Cuthbert. They

might even be servants of Boccob (or some other god

of learning) who simply want to add the lore of the

Veiled Codex to their own stores of knowledge.

The Veiled  Codex is  an  ancient  tome.  Of  those  few

scholars  who  have  actually  heard  of  it,  even  fewer

know  that  it  is  currently  in  the  possession  of  the

Finalveil  Cabal.  Through  other  adventures  or

research, the characters might find references to the

manuscript  in  other  ancient  tomes  and  unearth

descriptions  of  the  powerful  lore  that  it  contains.

Once aware of its existence, the PCs might decide to

seek  it  out  on  their  own  initiative.  Depending  on

their  nature  and  priorities,  they  might  undertake

such a mission for any number of reasonsperhaps

to destroy the book, perhaps to claim its knowledge

for their own use, or possibly to turn it over to a well-

meaning organization or powerful individual.

BEGINNING THE

ADVENTURE

The Finalveil Cabal is a site-based scenario in which the

action  occurs  in  and  around  the  hidden  catacomb

complex that houses the Veiled Codex and its protectors.

The  adventure  begins  when  the  characters  enter  the

catacombs (see Entry Points, below).

THE FINALVEIL ENCLAVE

The  catacombs  occupy  a  small  underground  complex

beneath a pedestrian graveyard in a city of your choos-

ing. On the surface above the catacombs is a mortuary

that  is  open  to  the  public  and  a  small,  nondescript

building  that  serves  as  the  cabals  safehouse.  The

surrounding  community  could  be  large  or  small,

depending  on  the  needs  of  your  campaign  and  the

ability of the characters to travel from place to place.

2

Although  the Veiled  Codex is  often  stored  in  these

catacombs, few of the cabals powerful undead masters

ever come here. This minor enclave depends more on

secrecy  than  the  outright  power  of  its  guardians  to

protect the valuable tome.

INTERIOR FEATURES

The  noteworthy  features  and  conditions  within  the

catacombs are described below.

Ceilings: The  ceilings  of  the  corridors  and

rooms  within  the  catacombs  are  about  12  feet  high.

The ceiling in the grand room with the coffin-shaped

dais is 20 feet high.

Floors: The  floors  throughout  the  complex  are

made of fairly even bedrock covered by worked stone.

Moving over these floors is relatively easy compared to

those found in many dungeon settings.

Light: Most  of  the  complex  is  unlit  and  remains

dark even during the day. A few areas have some illu-

mination,  which  is  noted  in  the  appropriate  area

descriptions.

Spiral  Staircase:  A  spiral  staircase  leads  up

from the catacombs to the safehouse, which is located

in  a  nondescript  aboveground  building.  Characters

can  walk  up  or  down  this  staircase  without  making

Climb checks, but doing so hampers movement. Each

square  moved  on  the  staircase  costs  10  feet  of  move-

ment,  and  characters  cannot  run  or  charge  while  on

the stairs. The staircase rises 40 feet from the floor of

the dais chamber.

Staircase  from  Mortuary:  The  long,  straight

staircase leading down from the cabals mortuary is the

ideal route for the characters to use in penetrating the

complex. Characters can walk up or down this staircase

without  making  Climb  checks,  but  doing  so  hampers

movement. Each square moved on the staircase costs 10

feet of movement, and characters cannot run or charge

while on the stairs. The staircase descends 40 feet from

the mortuary to the floor of the catacombs.

ENTRY POINTS

The catacombs have two entrances, but only onethe

staircase  leading  from  the  mortuaryis  likely  to  be

available  to  the  characters  during  their  initial  foray

against the cabal. This staircase may come to the char-

acters attention in any number of ways (see Adventure

Hooks, above). Alternatively, you can allow the charac-

ters  to  discover  information  about  the  spiral  staircase

leading down from the cabals safehouse.

After  spending  some  time  in  the  small  catacomb

complex,  the  characters  should  be  aware  of  both

staircases.  Thus,  they  can  use  either  entrance  for  any

subsequent forays they make against the cabal.

Mortuary Entrance (EL 4)

A few  of the cabals enemies have already located  this

entrance, so it is the easier of the two for PCs to find.

The cabal trusts to the careful construction of the secret

door at the back of the curators office to prevent discov-

ery of the catacombs beneath.

Creature:  The  curator  is  within  the  mortuary

during daylight hours.

Curator: Male illumian sorcerer 4; hp 10.

Development:  Anyone  searching  the  curators

office may make a DC 30 Search check to locate the

secret door, but foreknowledge of the existence of the

catacombs can provide a hefty circumstance bonus on

this check. Although the exact value of this bonus is

left to your discretion, +6 is appropriate for a charac-

ter who has been told the location and nature of the

secret door.

Cabal Complex Entrance (EL 4)

The safehouse that sits above the catacomb complex is

a lightly guarded, nondescript building. The doorway

to  the  staircase  that  leads  to  the  catacombs  is

concealed in the same manner as the door hidden in

the mortuary.

Creatures:  Unlike  the  mortuary  entrance,

however,  this  one  is  watched  and  guarded  by  cabal

members from within the safehouse. Thus, PCs who try

to force their way into the catacombs via this entrance

are confronted by opponents who, though no match for

the PCs, are determined to stop them.

Cabal Guards: Male and female illumian fighter

1/sorcerer 1; hp 8.

Development: Anyone searching the entry area

of  the  safehouse  may  make  a  DC  30  Search  check  to

locate the secret door, but foreknowledge of the exis-

tence  of  the  catacombs  can  provide  a  hefty  circum-

stance bonus on this check. Although the exact value

of this bonus is left to your discretion, +6 is appropriate

for  a  character  who  has  been  told  the  location  and

nature of the secret door.

INSIDE THE CATACOMBS

The following areas are keyed to the catacomb map.

1. EMBALMING CHAMBER

This room is devoted to preparing the corpses of lesser

cabal members (those lacking the power necessary for

conversion to vampirism or lichdom) for burial.

3

The acrid smell in the air of this small chamber is

reminiscent of the alchemical ingredients used to

preserve bodies for burial, and the rooms furnish-

ings bear out this impression. Empty jars line the

walls,  and  three  large  workbenches  fill  much  of

the  rooms  interior.  Despite  signs  of  regular  use,

the room is eerily still.

This room contains nothing of import to the characters,

although lesser members of the cabal use it frequently.

2. EXCAVATION CHAMBER (EL 6)

Although  this  enclave  is  currently  only  a  minor

outpost of the Finalveil Cabal, the sinister organization

plans  an  expansion  of  these  facilities  in  the  coming

years. To that end, two undead creatures have been set

to  excavating  more  chambers  to  house  the  cabals

preserved  dead.  Because  their  plans  for  expansion

wont  come  to  fruition  for  some  time,  the  cabal

members  have  left  the  zombies  here  unsupervised,

knowing that even slow labor will produce the neces-

sary results given enough time.

This rough, square chamber is obviously the site of

an  ongoing  excavation.  Its  walls,  unlike  those  in

the rest of the catacombs, are made of rough-hewn

stone  that  appears  to  have  been  exposed  quite

recently. The rubble from this excavation has been

pushed to the side of the room.

Two  hulking  gray  corpses  move  about  the

chamber under their own power, hewing yet more

stone  from  the  walls  with  their  powerful  blows.

Though the creatures stand nearly 8 feet tall, their

bodies slump and sag, as though their frames can

no longer hold the decaying flesh that drapes their

bones.

Each of the squares on the outside of the room is filled

with  dense  rubble  that  impedes  movement.  Entering

such a square costs 2 squares of movement, and within

it, the DC for a Balance or Tumble check increases by +5

and the DC for a Move Silently check increases by +2.

For more information on dense rubble, see page 90 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Creatures: Two  mindless  minotaur  zombies

occupy  this  chamber,  working  tirelessly  to  excavate  a

new  catacomb  section.  They  attack  any  intruders  that

they detect.

DD Minotaur  Zombies  (2): hp  83  and  81;  see

Monster Manual, page 267.

3. SYMBOL CHAMBERS

These  two  long  chambers  house  the  bodies  of  long-

dead, lesser members of the Finalveil Cabal. Most of the

members  who  die  before  attaining  the  level  of  power

that would merit induction into unlife are laid to rest in

chambers  such  as  this  one.  The  cabals  traditional

respect for departed members, however, demands that

it  protect  their  earthly  remains  with  magic  traps  and

undead guardians created for this purpose.

3a. Wraith Chamber (EL 8)

Shadowy  illumination  (see  page  164  in  the  Players

Handbook)  reaches  this  room  from  the  dais  chamber

(area 4).

The  artistry  of  the  three  coffins  that  occupy  this

chamber  is  a  testament  to  the  importance  that

their makers placed on the treatment of the dead.

Faint  illumination  enters  the  room  from  the  far

end,  causing  the  coffins  to  cast  long  shadows

across  the  floor.  From  somewhere  within  these

shadows,  three  sinister,  spectral  figures  robed  in

darkness  glide  forward.  They  have  no  visible

features  or  appendages  save  the  glowing  red

pinpoints where their eyes should be.

The  cabal  has  set  both  undead  guardians  and  deadly

traps to defend the bodies of its deceased members.

Creatures: Three  wraiths  loyal  to  the  Finalveil

Cabal  guard  this  chamber  at  all  times.  Once  minor

members  of  the  cabal,  they  were  transformed  into

undead  creatures  as  a  reward  for  their  exemplary

service.

DD Wraiths: hp  35,  32,  32;  see  Monster  Manual,

page 258.

Traps:  Each  of  the  chambers  coffins  is  trapped

with symbol spells that drain the strength of those who

trigger them.

aa Symbol of Weakness Trap: CR  8;  magic

device; proximity trigger; no reset; spell effect (symbol of

weakness, 13th level cleric, 3d6 Strength damage, DC 20

Fortitude  negates);  Search  DC  32;  Disable  Device  DC

32. Market Price: 45,500 gp, 3,640 xp.

3b. Bodak Chamber (EL 8)

Shadowy  illumination  (see  page  164  in  the  Players

Handbook)  reaches  this  room  from  the  dais  chamber

(area 4).

This chamber resembles area 3a in most ways, except

that  the  undead  guardian  stationed  here  is  a  solitary

bodak rather than a group of wraiths.

4

Faint  illumination  filters  into  this  area  from  an

entrance at its western end, revealing three large

coffins.  The  rooms  only  occupant  is  a  gray-

fleshed,  hairless  humanoid  with  an  elongated,

skull-like head and horrid, empty eyes.

The coffins house the remains of lesser cabal members

who did not merit induction into unlife.

Creature: A  bodak  loyal  to  the  Finalveil  Cabal

guards this area. Once a human scholar allied with the

cult, the bodak was corrupted by the knowledge within

the Veiled  Codex  and  transformed  into  an  undead

monster.

DD Bodak: hp 58; see Monster Manual, page 28.

Traps:  Each  of  the  chambers  coffins  is  trapped

with symbol spells that drain the strength of those who

trigger them.

32. Market Price: 45,500 gp, 3,640 xp.

4. DAIS CHAMBER

This  grand  chamber  is  the  heart  of  the  enclave.  The

ceiling  here  is  higher  than  in  other  sections  of  the

catacombs,  and  it  reaches  a  height  of  20  feet  at  the

center.  Three  continual  flame  torches  attached  to  the

walls  provide  normal  illumination  within  the  cham-

ber  and  shed  dim  light  along  the  passages  and  into

areas 3a and 3b.

The  chamber  contains  numerous  coffins,  plus  a

coffin-shaped dais that holds pride of place at the very

center.

Light  from  three  torches  illuminates  this  large

chamber, revealing dozens of coffins, one of which

serves as a dais in the center of the room. A sinister-

looking warrior with pale skin and red, haunting

eyes  advances,  whirling  a  deadly  spiked  chain.

Glowing magical symbols encircle the creatures

head, bathing its whole form in pale blue light.

The  dais  serves  as  the  coffin  for  the  guardian  of  the

Veiled Codex.

Creature: An illumian vampire of moderate power

lairs  here  and  guards  the Veiled  Codex.  This  creature,

whose  name  is  Finalveil  Iarmid,  is  a  newly  formed

undead  by  the  cabals  standards,  but  he  is  loyal  and

dangerous nonetheless.

Blood Drain (Ex): Iarmid can suck blood from a

living  victim  with  his  fangs  by  making  a  successful

grapple check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood, deal-

ing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin

is  maintained.  On  each  such  successful  attack,  Iarmid

gains 5 temporary hit points.

Children  of  the  Night  (Su): Once  per  day,

Iarmid  can  call  forth  1d6+1  rat  swarms,  1d4+1  bat

swarms,  or  a  pack  of  3d6  wolves  as  a  standard  action.

These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve him for

up to 1 hour.

Dominate (Su): Iarmid can crush an opponents

will just by looking into his or her eyes. This effect is

similar to a gaze attack, except that Iarmid must use a

standard  action,  and  those  merely  looking  at  him  are

not affected. Anyone he targets must succeed on a DC

14 Will save or fall instantly under Iarmids influence as

though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The

ability has a range of 30 feet.

Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous

humanoid  slain  by  Iarmids  energy  drain  rises  as  a

vampire spawn (see Monster Manual, page 253) 1d4 days

after  burial.  If  Iarmid  instead  drains  the  victims

Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn

if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or

more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is

under Iarmids command and remains enslaved until his

destruction.  At  any  given  time,  Iarmid  may  have

enslaved spawn totaling no more than 12 Hit Dice; any

spawn he creates that would exceed this limit are created

as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that

is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so

Iarmid can control a number of lesser vampires in this

fashion. He may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in

order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire

or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.

Energy  Drain  (Su): Any  living  creature  hit  by

Iarmids  slam  attack  gains  two  negative  levels  (DC  14

Fortitude  save  to  remove).  For  each  negative  level

bestowed, he gains 5 temporary hit points. Iarmid can

use his energy drain ability once per round.

Final Utterance (Ex): When Iarmid dies, every-

one  within  earshot  of  him  hears  ululating  Illumian

syllables for 6 rounds. The words may be gibberish, or

they may pronounce a prophetic phrase or a final curse

on his enemies.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Iarmid deals 1d6 extra points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its  Dexterity  bonus  for  any  reason.  This  damage  also

applies  to  ranged  attacks  against  targets  up  to  30  feet

away.  Creatures  with  concealment,  creatures  without

discernible  anatomies,  and  creatures  immune  to  extra

damage  from  critical  hits  are  all  immune  to  sneak

attacks. Iarmid may choose to deliver nonlethal damage

with  his  sneak  attack,  but  only  when  using  a  weapon

designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Alternate  Form  (Su): Iarmid  can  assume  the

shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard

action.  This  ability  is  similar  to  a  polymorph spell

(caster level 12th), except that Iarmid does not regain

hit  points  for  changing  form  and  must  choose  from

among the forms mentioned here. While in his alter-

nate  form,  Iarmid  loses  his  natural  slam  attack  and

dominate  ability,  but  he  gains  the  natural  weapons

and extraordinary special attacks of his new form. He

can remain in that form until he assumes another or

until the next sunrise.

Fast  Healing  (Ex): Iarmid  heals  5  points  of

damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point.

If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, he automatically

assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. He must

reach  his  coffin  home  within  2  hours  or  be  utterly

destroyed. (He can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Any

additional damage dealt to Iarmid while he is in gaseous

form has no effect. Once at rest in his coffin, Iarmid is

helpless. He regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no

longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit

points per round.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, Iarmid

can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level

5th), but he can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a

fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

Glyphic  Resonance  (Ex):  Iarmid  is  immune

to  symbol-based  magic  of  caster  level  6th  or  below.

6

He  takes  a  4  racial  penalty  on  his  saving  throws

against  symbol-based  magic  of  caster  level  7th  or

higher.

Illumian  Word  (Su): Iarmids  power  sigils

combine  to  form  the  word  aeshuur.  When  he  deals

damage to a target with a sneak attack or critical hit, he

gains  a  +2  dodge  bonus  to  his  AC  against  that  target

until  the  beginning  of  his  next  turn.  Iarmid  may  use

this ability twice per day.

Power  Sigils  (Su): Iarmid  has  the  power  sigils

aesh (vigor) and uur (grace). Aesh grants him a +2 bonus

on  Strength  checks  and  Strength-based  skill  checks,

and uur grants him the same bonus on Dexterity checks

and Dexterity-based skill checks.

Shadow  Heritage  (Ex): Iarmid  has  a  +2  racial

bonus on saves against spells with the shadow descrip-

tor.

Spider  Climb  (Ex):  Iarmid  can  climb  sheer

surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.

Superior  Literacy  (Ex):  Speak  Language  is  a

class skill for both of Iarmids classes.

Trapfinding  (Ex):  Iarmid  can  find,  disarm,  or

bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the

Search  skill  to  find,  and  the  Disable  Device  skill  to

disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used

to  create  it).  If  his  Disable  Device  result  exceeds  the

traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the

trap without triggering or disarming it.

Turn Resistance (Ex): Iarmid is treated as a 10-

HD undead for the purpose of resolving a turn, rebuke,

command, or bolster attempt.

Undead Traits: Iarmid is immune to mind-affect-

ing  effects,  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,

disease,  death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harm-

less. He is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability  damage  to  his  physical  ability  scores,  ability

drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from

massive damage. He cannot be raised, and resurrection

works only if he is willing. He has darkvision out to

60 feet.

Possessions:  Masterwork  chain  shirt,  +1  spiked  chain,

masterwork  shortbow  with  10  arrows,  potion  of  inflict

minor wounds.

Tactics: Iarmid  attacks  a  flat-footed  creature  if

possible  so  as  to  take  advantage  of  his  sneak  attack

ability.  If  he  manages  to  deal  sneak  attack  damage,

he  triggers  the  power  of  the  mystical  symbols  that

surround  him.  Unlike  most  vampires,  Iarmid  does

not try to flee if the battle goes against him. Not only

does he know that the leaders of the Finalveil would

enact  swift  and  final  vengeance  against  him  should

he  allow  the  book  to  be  taken,  but  he  has  little  to

gain  by  retreating,  since  his  coffin  lies  within  this

chamber.

Treasure:  Within  Iarmids  coffin  lies  the Veiled

Codex.

CONCLUDING THE

ADVENTURE

Upon  retrieving  the Veiled  Codex, the  characters  have

successfully  completed  the  adventure.  Although  the

catacombs contain relatively little treasure, the PCs can

sell the Veiled Codex if they choose.

The safehouse above the catacombs houses two low-

level illumian guards who pose no threat to characters

as  powerful  as  the  PCs  (See  Cabal  Complex  Entrance,

above). If captured, however, these two might divulge

information that could lead to further conflicts with the

Finalveil Cabal. In particular, the PCs might be able to

learn  the  location  of  another  cabal  outpost  from  the

guards.  By  making  repeated  attacks  on  the  cabals

enclaves, the party could become a persistent thorn in

the side of the Finalveil.

The Veiled  Codex  contains  detailed  instructions  for

conducting  the  magic  rituals  necessary  to  become  a

lich. As treasure, it can be sold for at least 15,000 gp. On

the other hand, if someone sent the PCs to retrieve the

book,  they  could  expect  a  reward  equal  to  its  market

value when they turn it over to their employer or offer

proof  of  its  destruction,  depending  upon  the  terms  of

their agreement.

FURTHER ADVENTURES

As noted at the beginning of the adventure, characters

who  successfully  complete  their  mission  earn  the

enduring  enmity  of  the  Finalveil  Cabal.  However,

because  months  of  game  time  could  pass  before  the

cabal is ready to strike back, the characters could easily

fail to understand that theyve made a powerful foe by

recovering the Veiled Codex.

This  adventure  can  also  serve  as  a  gateway  to

interactions  with  other  illumian  cabals.  Once  the

PCs are aware of the illumians and their cabals, they

might be forced to turn to them again when seeking

other lore.

The Veiled  Codex  can  lead  to  additional  adventures

as well. Certain cryptic passages within the tome hint

at  other  manuscripts  that  can  unlock  the  powers  of

undeath. These tomes, even more ancient and terrible

7

than  the Veiled  Codex,  have  long  been  sought  by  the

leaders of the Finalveil Cabal. But because they now

hunt and hate the characters, the cabal members are

likely  to  investigate  any  location  that  the  characters

visit. And if one of those sites holds a clue to the loca-

tion of a book they seek, they will certainly find and

pursue it. Thus, the PCs could easily find themselves

embroiled in a race with the cabal for possession of an

evil  tome.  Should  it  fall  into  the  cabals  hands,  its

members  would  surely  use  it  to  make  life  miserable

for their enemiesincluding the PCs.
