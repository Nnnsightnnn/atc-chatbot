introduction

Faern is littered with the wreckage of the pastshat-

tered castles, ruined cities, forgotten dungeons, nameless

strongholds,  shunned  temples,  and  other  ruins  too

decayed  to  identify.  But  what  were  these  places  in  their  days

of glory, and what forces brought them low? Each crumbling

edice has a story to tella tale of glory and power followed by

slow decline or outright destruction through betrayal, war, or

catastrophe. When heroes explore such a site, they venture into

its story and become part of it, adding their deeds to a tale that

may have begun thousands of years before their birth.

Like our own world, the land of Faern has been sculpted

and shaped by the merciless winds of history and time. Ancient

wars, terrible catastrophes, personal tragedies, and great triumphs

have all given rise to consequences that in turn caused other wars

and disasters. Thus has the endless cycle of cause and effect been

propagated across thousands of years and hundreds of cities and

kingdoms.

Lost Empires of Faern offers rationales for how and why the

ruined places of the past may demand the attention of the player

characters in your game. In a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, no

ruined castle should be a nameless mound of rubble lled with

random monsters. Was it once the stronghold of a Netherese lich

who outlived his land by centuries? Or the fortress of an evil

warlord who dreamed of carving out his own kingdom from the

chaos following Phalorms fall? Or could it be the secret retreat

of a sinister Nar conjurer who bound a demon within its walls

some fteen centuries ago? An adventure site with links to the

past offers a wonderful opportunity to ground your adventures

in the setting and immerse your players in the fantastic world

that their characters inhabit and explore.

The Ruin-Based

Campaign

The  history  of  Faerns  lost  empires  is  a  tale  of  unparalleled

magical might, lost imperial majesty, and age-old, cataclysmic

wars involving numerous realms and many races. It is also an

incomplete  chronicle  replete  with  overlooked  arcane  wonders,

untold entombed evils, and long-forgotten gods. In ancient vaults

and ruins, legacies both foul and fair lie patiently in the dark,

awaiting the right moment, the right adventurer, or the right

sign to herald their return to the light.

Campaigns in Faern can embroil characters in ongoing events

occurring throughout the continent. From the plots and schemes

of ambitious rulers to the hidden agendas of rival churches and

secret societies, the adventuring landscape of Faern is an ever-

shifting backdrop whose precise nature varies with the successes

and failures of numerous factions. Lost Empires of Faern adds

to this rich tapestry of deeds and machinations by returning to

present-day Faern some of the lore and magic of the civilizations

gone by.

The history of Faern is the foundation upon which the cur-

rent-day world rests. To most people, the overt signs of history

are meaningless, and old ruins and empty mines are places to be

avoided. To a sage or adventurer, however, such locations serve as

windows into the past. A fallen realm or forgotten empire may

seem to exert little inuence in the here and now, but it holds

great potential for both dire perils and marvelous wonders.

The historical realms described in Lost Empires of Faern

are not meant to be intriguing destinations for time-traveling

characters. Rather, adventures and even entire campaigns can be

designed around an ancient kingdom that the heroes know only

Faern is littered with the wreckage of the pastshat-

tered castles, ruined cities, forgotten dungeons, nameless

strongholds,  shunned  temples,  and  other  ruins  too

decayed  to  identify.  But  what  were  these  places  in  their  days

of glory, and what forces brought them low? Each crumbling

edice has a story to tella tale of glory and power followed by

slow decline or outright destruction through betrayal, war, or

catastrophe. When heroes explore such a site, they venture into

its story and become part of it, adding their deeds to a tale that

may have begun thousands of years before their birth.

Like our own world, the land of Faern has been sculpted

and shaped by the merciless winds of history and time. Ancient

wars, terrible catastrophes, personal tragedies, and great triumphs

have all given rise to consequences that in turn caused other wars

and disasters. Thus has the endless cycle of cause and effect been

propagated across thousands of years and hundreds of cities and

kingdoms.

Lost Empires of Faern offers rationales for how and why the

ruined places of the past may demand the attention of the player

characters in your game. In a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, no

ruined castle should be a nameless mound of rubble lled with

random monsters. Was it once the stronghold of a Netherese lich

who outlived his land by centuries? Or the fortress of an evil

warlord who dreamed of carving out his own kingdom from the

chaos following Phalorms fall? Or could it be the secret retreat

of a sinister Nar conjurer who bound a demon within its walls

some fteen centuries ago? An adventure site with links to the

past offers a wonderful opportunity to ground your adventures

in the setting and immerse your players in the fantastic world

that their characters inhabit and explore.

The Ruin-Based

Campaign

The  history  of  Faerns  lost  empires  is  a  tale  of  unparalleled

magical might, lost imperial majesty, and age-old, cataclysmic

wars involving numerous realms and many races. It is also an

incomplete  chronicle  replete  with  overlooked  arcane  wonders,

untold entombed evils, and long-forgotten gods. In ancient vaults

and ruins, legacies both foul and fair lie patiently in the dark,

awaiting the right moment, the right adventurer, or the right

sign to herald their return to the light.

Campaigns in Faern can embroil characters in ongoing events

occurring throughout the continent. From the plots and schemes

of ambitious rulers to the hidden agendas of rival churches and

secret societies, the adventuring landscape of Faern is an ever-

shifting backdrop whose precise nature varies with the successes

and failures of numerous factions. Lost Empires of Faern adds

to this rich tapestry of deeds and machinations by returning to

present-day Faern some of the lore and magic of the civilizations

gone by.

The history of Faern is the foundation upon which the cur-

rent-day world rests. To most people, the overt signs of history

are meaningless, and old ruins and empty mines are places to be

avoided. To a sage or adventurer, however, such locations serve as

windows into the past. A fallen realm or forgotten empire may

seem to exert little inuence in the here and now, but it holds

great potential for both dire perils and marvelous wonders.

The historical realms described in Lost Empires of Faern

are not meant to be intriguing destinations for time-traveling

characters. Rather, adventures and even entire campaigns can be

designed around an ancient kingdom that the heroes know only

from stories. For example, addressing a threat from the vanished

past might require adventurers to explore an ancient empires

culture, learn its history, and understand its magical nuances. In

so doing, characters could acquire a particular mastery necessary

to survive a disaster or solve a problem that began long ago. At

that point, the way is open for them to rediscover spells created

Ancient Secrets

E xploring  the  ruins  of  ancient  civilizations  is

probably  the  single  most  common  activity  for

adventuring companies. Whether theyre confront-

ing  an  ancient  evil  in  its  lair  or  simply  treasure-hunting  for

personal gain, most groups of PCs nd themselves in ancient

ruins more than a few times over the course of their careers.

However, few adventurers ever consider the origins of the ruins

they explore. Ancient dungeons and crumbling crypts dont just

spring up out of nowhere; the peoples who constructed them

did so for specic reasons using styles and methods particular

to their cultures.

This chapter is dedicated to characters who go beyond the

surfacethose who choose to learn the whys and wherefores of

the ancient civilizations whose monuments dot Faern. These

historians  and  scholars  safeguard  the  knowledge  of  Faerns

past,  and  they  can  be  valuable  assets  to  adventurers  as  well.

For  example,  a  trap  could  be  so  cunningly  hidden  that  the

most keen-eyed rogue might miss it, but a character versed in

history  and  ancient  cultures  would  recognize  the  crumbling

friezes  on  the  walls  as  the  decorations  of  a  royal  tomb  and

warn her companions that its certain to be well protected. Or

a character who knows ancient languages might be able to read

ruined signposts and determine the fastest, safest route to the

PCs objective.

Not  all  characters  with  detailed  knowledge  of  the  ancient

past are historians, tomb guardians, or mages eager to recapture

the mighty lore of the past. Many undead creatures and other

long-lived beings still remember Myth Drannor and Ascalhorn

rsthand, and Netherils numerous legacies include a secret society

of watchers and guardians that has passed down the traditions of

the Arcane Age from one generation to the next. This chapter

is for the players of these characters as well.

Ancient Feats

Those who study the lore of the vanished past often come across

long-lost arcana, forgotten schools of combat, and boons granted

by  gods  who  are  no  longer  worshiped  in  Faern.  In  addition,

characters with a scholarly interest in the works and writings

of  fallen  civilizations  often  wish  to  learn  unusual  tricks  and

techniques to make their studies easier.

Arcane Manipulation

You  are  learned  in  the  arcane  ways  of  Netheril,  where

masters of magic once molded and shaped arcane energy to

their own will.

Prerequisite: Wizard level 1st.

Benet: When you prepare spells, you can break down up to

three existing arcane spell slots to create a specied number of

lower-level spell slots. (A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level for this

purpose, so a 1st-level spell slot could be broken into two 0-level

spell slots.) The sum of the levels of all the new spell slots must

equal the level of the original. The number of spell slots you can

create in this manner is otherwise unlimited. Spell slots that you

break down into multiple lower-level slots remain that way until

the next time you prepare spells, at which time you can choose

to restore your spell slots to normal or break them up again.

Normal: A character can always choose to use a higher-level

spell slot to prepare a lower-level spell, but any remainder spell

levels are lost.

Arcane Transfiguration

Drawing upon forgotten lore, you broaden your arcane studies

and master a school of magic previously prohibited to you.

Prerequisites: Item Reprieve, Spell Reprieve, specialist wizard

level 10th.

Benet: Choose a school of magic that was previously prohib-

ited to you because of your arcane specialization. You can now

learn and cast spells from that school normally, as if you were

not a specialist wizard.

ANCIENT SECRETS

Special: You can select this feat only once. The school you

choose must be one for which you have already taken both the

Spell Reprieve and the Item Reprieve feats.

or spell sacriced must be one level higher than the level of the

desired effect from the item. If the check fails, both your spell slot

(or prepared spell) and 1 charge from the item are expended.

Channel Charge

You can power a charged magic item with your own magical

ability.

Prerequisites: Use Magic Device 5 ranks, ability to cast 4th-

level spells.

Benet: When you use a spell trigger magic item with charges

(such as a wand or a staff), you can make a Use Magic Device check

(DC 15 + the items caster level). If you succeed, you can sacrice a

spell slot or prepared spell instead of using a charge. The spell slot

Cormanthyran Moon Magic

You have mastered the ancient elven techniques of drawing power

from Sehanine Moonbows light.

Prerequisites:  Knowledge  (history)  4  ranks,  ability  to  cast

3rd-level spells.

Benet: When you cast a spell under moonlight, your effective

caster level increases by 2. This feat provides no benet when the

moon is not visible (during the day, underground, during a new

moon, or the like).

However, few adventurers ever consider the origins of the ruins

they explore. Ancient dungeons and crumbling crypts dont just

spring up out of nowhere; the peoples who constructed them

did so for specic reasons using styles and methods particular

to their cultures.

This chapter is dedicated to characters who go beyond the

surfacethose who choose to learn the whys and wherefores of

the ancient civilizations whose monuments dot Faern. These

historians  and  scholars  safeguard  the  knowledge  of  Faerns

past,  and  they  can  be  valuable  assets  to  adventurers  as  well.

For  example,  a  trap  could  be  so  cunningly  hidden  that  the

most keen-eyed rogue might miss it, but a character versed in

history  and  ancient  cultures  would  recognize  the  crumbling

friezes  on  the  walls  as  the  decorations  of  a  royal  tomb  and

warn her companions that its certain to be well protected. Or

a character who knows ancient languages might be able to read

ruined signposts and determine the fastest, safest route to the

PCs objective.

Not  all  characters  with  detailed  knowledge  of  the  ancient

past are historians, tomb guardians, or mages eager to recapture

the mighty lore of the past. Many undead creatures and other

long-lived beings still remember Myth Drannor and Ascalhorn

rsthand, and Netherils numerous legacies include a secret society

of watchers and guardians that has passed down the traditions of

the Arcane Age from one generation to the next. This chapter

is for the players of these characters as well.

Ancient Feats

Those who study the lore of the vanished past often come across

long-lost arcana, forgotten schools of combat, and boons granted

by  gods  who  are  no  longer  worshiped  in  Faern.  In  addition,

characters with a scholarly interest in the works and writings

of  fallen  civilizations  often  wish  to  learn  unusual  tricks  and

techniques to make their studies easier.

Arcane Manipulation

You  are  learned  in  the  arcane  ways  of  Netheril,  where

masters of magic once molded and shaped arcane energy to

their own will.

Prerequisite: Wizard level 1st.

Benet: When you prepare spells, you can break down up to

three existing arcane spell slots to create a specied number of

lower-level spell slots. (A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level for this

purpose, so a 1st-level spell slot could be broken into two 0-level

spell slots.) The sum of the levels of all the new spell slots must

equal the level of the original. The number of spell slots you can

create in this manner is otherwise unlimited. Spell slots that you

break down into multiple lower-level slots remain that way until

the next time you prepare spells, at which time you can choose

to restore your spell slots to normal or break them up again.

Normal: A character can always choose to use a higher-level

spell slot to prepare a lower-level spell, but any remainder spell

levels are lost.

Arcane Transfiguration

Drawing upon forgotten lore, you broaden your arcane studies

and master a school of magic previously prohibited to you.

Prerequisites: Item Reprieve, Spell Reprieve, specialist wizard

level 10th.

Benet: Choose a school of magic that was previously prohib-

ited to you because of your arcane specialization. You can now

learn and cast spells from that school normally, as if you were

not a specialist wizard.

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

Craft Scepter [Item Creation]

You know the ancient Netherese secret of creating magic scep-

tersdevices that can contain much more powerful spells than

a magic wand can.

Prerequisite: Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, caster level 9th.

Bene t: You can create a scepter that holds any spell of 7th

level or lower that you know. Unlike a magic wand, a scepter can

contain up to two spells, each of which has a cost in charges to

use. Both spell effects draw from a common pool of charges, so

they can be used in any combination.

Crafting a scepter takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base

price. The base price of a scepter is its caster level  the spell

level  750 gp for the highest-level spell included, plus the caster

level  the spell level  375 gp for the second spell, if any. To

craft a scepter, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and

use up raw materials costing one-half of this amount. A newly

created scepter has 50 charges. Any scepter that stores a spell

with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a

commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base

price, you must expend  fty units of the material component or

pay  fty times the XP cost.

See page 153 for more information on scepters.

Familiar Concentration

In the tradition of Narfells ancient summoners, your familiar

can concentrate to maintain spells for you.

Prerequisites: Improved Familiar, caster level 9th.

Bene t:  When  you  cast  a  spell  requiring  concentration,

you can designate your familiar as the concentrator. At any

time during the spells duration, you can hand over control

of it to your familiar as a free action, provided the creature

is within 5 feet of you and its Intelligence score is at least

10 + the level of the spell. The familiar then concentrates to

maintain and direct the spell just as you would. You cannot

take back control of a spell once you have transferred it to

your familiar.

Godsight [Regional]

You  enjoy  the  special  blessing  of  a  deity  of  the  Mulhorandi

pantheon, who has granted you unerring powers of perception.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Mulhorandi (aasimar, human [Mulan]

or tie ing), Mulhorand region.

Bene t: You gain the following spell-like abilities, each usable

three times per day: detect evil, detect magic, detect poison, detect

undead, read magic.  Your  caster  level  equals  your  character

level.

When you take this feat, you can choose detect chaos, detect

good, or detect law instead of detect evil.

Special: You can take this feat only as a 1st-level character.

Greenbound Summoning

You are learned in a long-forgotten manner of summoning once

practiced by the Eaerlanni elves of the High Forest. Creatures

answering your call are automatically imbued with the powers

of the forest.

Prerequisite: Ability to cast any summon natures ally spell.

Bene t: All animals that you summon using summon natures

ally acquire the greenbound template (see page 173) for as long

as the summoning spell lasts.

Item Reprieve

You learn how to use items from a school of magic previously

prohibited to you.

Prerequisite: Spell Reprieve, specialist wizard level 5th.

Bene t: Choose one of the schools of magic that was previously

prohibited to you because of your arcane specialization. You now

can use spell completion and spell trigger magic items from that

school normally, as if you were not a specialist wizard.

Special: The school you select must be one for which you have

already taken the Spell Reprieve feat.

Jergals Pact

You have made a bargain with Jergal, seneschal to the god of

death. Although Myrkul, Cyric, and most recently Kelemvor have

all served as the god of death, each has honored these pacts.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, Great Fortitude.

Bene t: You gain a +2 bonus on saves to resist gaining negative

levels or to remove them. If the effect that bestowed a negative

level  allows  a  Fortitude  save  to  remove  it,  you  can  choose  to

attempt it after only 1 hour. (You can also choose to wait the

usual amount of time before attempting the save.)

Normal: You make saving throws to remove negative levels

24 hours after gaining them.

Multilingual

You have an uncanny knack for languages.

Prerequisites: Int 15.

Bene t: You know three more languages than you normally

would. Your choices for these extra tongues are not restricted to

your racial or regional list of bonus languages, though you still

cant select secret languages such as Druidic unless you belong

to the race or class in question. Furthermore, Speak Language

is always a class skill for you, and you receive a +2 bonus on all

Decipher Script checks.

Special: You can take this feat only as a 1st-level character.

Netherese Battle Curse

You can channel your own arcane energy into a powerful curse

upon those who dare to face you in battle.

Prerequisites:  Knowledge  (history)  4  ranks,  Power  Attack,

arcane caster level 1st.

Bene t: By giving up an arcane spell slot or prepared spell

before making an attack roll, you can perform a battle curse

as a melee attack. You gain a bonus on the attack roll equal

to  the  level  of  the  spell  or  spell  slot  so  sacri ced.  If  your

attack hits, the target must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 +

level of spell or slot expended + your Cha modi er) or take a

2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill

checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 minute. The effects of

multiple battle curses dont stack, and any foe that successfully

resists  your  battle  curse  cannot  be  affected  by  it  again  for

24 hours.

Any  effect  that  dispels  or  removes  a  curse  eliminates  the

battle curse. Your caster level equals your character level for this

purpose.

Servant of

the Fallen

You  keep  alive  the  wor-

ship  of  a  deity  who

has died or vanished.

Your  faith  in  this

fallen deity allows you

to wield divine magic in

his or her name.

Prerequisites:  Cleric

level 1st, dead or forgot-

ten  god  (for  example,

Amaunator,  Bhaal,

Moander, or Myrkul) as

patron deity.

Bene t: You can

name a dead god as

your  patron  deity

and  still  receive

your  cleric  spells

normally.  In  addi-

tion,  you  can  call  upon

the  universal  remnant

of  your  deitys  power

once per day to gain a +1

luck bonus on any single

die roll. You can also be

raised or resurrected normally.

do  not  normally  receive  spells.  Characters  who  do

not worship active gods in Faern suffer the

fate of the Faithless in the Fugue Plane after

death.

Special:  You  can  take  this  feat  only  once.

Choosing  this  feat  changes  your  patron  from

your previous deity to the dead or forgotten deity

of your choice, and you take no penalties for making this change.

If you later choose a different patron deity, you lose the bene t

of this feat, but your new patron may grant you spells just as he

or she would for any other cleric.

See Ancient Deities, page 41, for a list of notable dead gods,

their alignments, and their domains.

Spell Reprieve

Your studies of the less restrictive arcane traditions of old allow

you to cast one spell from a prohibited school.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (history) 2 ranks, specialist wizard

level 1st.

Bene t: Choose a spell from one of your prohibited schools

of a level that you can cast. You can now learn and prepare that

spell normally.

Special:  You  can  take  this  feat  multiple  times,  each  time

choosing a new spell from

any  of  your  prohibited

schools.

Trapmaster

You  have  studied  the  fu-

nereal  architecture  and

lethal  traps  of  a  dozen

long-dead  cultures.  Your

familiarity with ancient

tombs, vaults, and other

such  sites  has  in-

stilled  in  you  an

uncanny  knack  for

avoiding traps.

Prerequisites:  Int  13,

trap sense +2.

Bene t: The bonus for

your trap sense ability in-

creases by 4. In addition,

you  gain  a  +2  bonus

on all Disable Device

checks.

Wounding

Spell

[Metamagic]

Because you have studied

the  cruel  arts  of  the

Athalantan magelords of

old, you know how to cast

spells that cause terrible,

bleeding wounds.

P r e r e q u i s i t e s :

Knowledge (history)

4 ranks, Empower Spell.

A wounding lightning bolt

Bene t: When affected by this feat, a spell that deals damage

to a creature also in icts a bleeding wound that does not heal

normally. On each subsequent round, the victim loses 1 hit point

at the beginning of your turn. The continuing hit point loss can

be stopped with a Heal check (DC equal to the spells save DC, or

the save DC it would otherwise have in the case of a spell with

no save), a cure spell, or a heal spell.

ANCIENT SECRETS

You cannot apply this feat to a spell that does not deal damage

A wounding spell occupies a spell slot two levels higher than

the spells actual level.

Prestige Classes

Elf sages watch over the prisons of ancient demons and guard

artifacts  of  terrible  evil  power.  Modern  mages  resurrect  the

ancient magic of Athalantar. In Mulhorand, servitors of ancient

gods rule the nation and lead its armies. A secret society composed

of fallen Netherils descendants works to prevent the return of

that empire, struggling covertly against the Shades and any mage

they deem too close to discovering Netherils secrets.

Cultist of the Shattered Peak

The  pride  of  wizards  and  arcanists  nearly  doomed  Faern

once. Never again.

Khemal Serist, Cultist of the Shattered Peak

BECOMING A

CULTIST OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

Cultists of the Shattered Peak possess skill at arms, stealth, and

a smattering of ancient lore. Most of those now operating in

Faern began their careers as  ghter/rogues. Single-class rogues

or ranger/rogues are also fairly common, though they must wait

until they have gained the requisite combat training. The cults

sometimes ruthless tactics make paladins rare in its ranks, and

arcane spellcasters are simply not permitted.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Race:  Human  of  Netherese  descent  (home  region  Anauroch,

Halruaa, Nimbral, the North, the Ride, Uthgardt Tribesfolk,

or the Western Heartlands).

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Decipher Script 4 ranks, Disable Device 4 ranks, Knowledge

(history) 4 ranks, Speak Language (Loross).

Special: Sneak attack +1d6.

Special: You may not have any levels in an arcane spellcasting

class.

The Cult of the Shattered Peak is a highly secretive society whose

members are all direct descendants of the Netherese. Cult cells

are scattered all across Faern, but the majority are concentrated

within  and  around  the  former  boundaries  of  Netheril.  Many

cultists live among the Bedine tribes of the Anauroch and the

folk  of  the  North  and  Tun.  Smaller  cells  operate  across  the

Western Heartlands, monitoring Netherese ruins both known

and unknown.

Most of the tales about secret Netherese cults depict their

members as power-mad wizards bent on raising the Empire of

Magic  once  again,  or  exploiting  its  secrets  for  personal  gain.

But the Cult of the Shattered Peak bears no resemblance to the

cults in these stories, since its membership includes not a single

arcane spellcaster. The members of this cult recall the hubris of

Netheril and its citizens oppression of those they viewed as lesser

races, and they seek to ensure that the ways of old Netheril

remain dead and buried. To that end, they employ a variety of

tacticsspreading  misinformation,  discrediting  scholars  who

get too close to resurrecting some aspect of Netherese life, and

even outright assassination, if necessary. Their methods may be

ruthless at times, but the cultists  rmly believe that they are

working toward the greater good.

TABLE 12: THE CULTIST OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

CLASS FEATURES

As a cultist of the Shattered Peak, you are focused on preventing

arcane spellcasters from rediscovering the old ways of Netheril.

Because that goal sometimes places you in direct con ict with

arcane spellcasters, cult training grants you a number of abilities

aimed at ensuring victory against such foes. All the following are

class features of the cultist of the Shattered Peak prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: You are pro cient with all

simple  and  martial  weapons,  as  well  as  with  light  armor  and

bucklers.

Spellcasting:  You  have  the  ability  to  cast  a  small  number

of arcane spells. To cast a cultist spell, you must have an Intel-

ligence score of at least 10 + the spells level, so if you have an

Intelligence of 10 or lower, you cannot cast these spells. Bonus

spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these

spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Int modi er. When

you get 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 0 1st-level

spells at 1st level), you gain only the bonus spells you would be

entitled to based on your Intelligence score for that spell level.

You can learn sorcerer/wizard spells from the schools of abjuration

or enchantment only. You have access to any spell on those lists

and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a wizard can. You

prepare and cast spells just as a wizard does.

Ominous  Presence  (Ex):  When  adventurers  or  explorers

come  too  close  to  discovering  some  great  Netherese  secret,

you prefer to frighten them off rather than kill them if at

all possible. Upon becoming a cultist of the Shattered Peak,

you  gain  a  bonus  equal  to  your  class  level  on  all  Bluff  and

Intimidate checks.

Zeal  (Ex):  You  gain  a  +1  morale  bonus  on

attack rolls against arcane spellcasters and a +1

morale bonus on saving throws against

arcane spells and effects. The bonus

on  attack  rolls  does  not  apply  to

a  creature  with  arcane  spell-like

abilities unless it is also an arcane

spellcaster.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning

at 2nd level, you deal extra damage

when you are  anking an opponent

or  at  any  time  when  the  target

would be denied its Dexterity bonus.

This extra damage applies to ranged

attacks only if the target is within

30 feet. See the rogue class feature,

page 50 of the Players Handbook.

Smite  Mage  (Su):  If  you  are

forced  into  battle  with  an  arcane

spellcaster, your life depends on quick

and decisive action. Starting at 3rd

level, you can attempt to smite an

arcane spellcaster with one normal

melee attack once per day. You add

your Charisma bonus (if any) to your

attack roll, and you deal an extra 1

point of damage per cultist level you

possess on a successful attack. If you

accidentally smite a creature that is

not an arcane spellcaster, the smite

has no effect, but the ability is still

used up for that day.

Death Attack (Ex): Sometimes the

only  way  to  stop  especially  determined

foes from acquiring forbidden knowledge is to

kill them. At 5th level, you gain a death attack that works like

the assassin ability of the same name, except that the DC of the

Fortitude save to avoid the kill or paralysis effect is 15 + your Int

modi er. See the assassin class feature, page 180 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide.

PLAYING A CULTIST OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

Certain objects and places are best left undisturbed, and sorcerers

and wizards are the most likely to disturb them. Your task is to

stop  such  individuals  from  doing  so  by  any  means  necessary.

This goal places you in direct or indirect con ict with many of

Faerns arcane spellcasters. Not all mages are opposed to your

cause, but until you know that a particular arcane spellcaster

isnt going to abuse his power, its only wise to treat him as a

potential adversary.

Secrecy allows you to do your work with a minimum of resis-

tance from your adversaries and also protects you from reprisals.

Thus, you usually operate covertly, as part of a hidden cell within

the organization. You receive information and orders through the

one or two other cell members you know, or through messages

left for you by comrades you never see. You might

also be assigned to protect and assist other members

without their knowledge. This high degree of secrecy

means that if you or any of your colleagues are

captured or questioned, none of you can reveal

much about the cult.

Combat:  You  admire  ef ciency.  When

combat  seems  the  best  way  to  achieve  the

cults goals, you dont shrink from it, but

you can often accomplish the same ends

through  stealth,  guile,  or  distraction.

Your  ghting skills are on a par with the

rogues, and you excel in any  ght in

which a rogue would do well.

A carefully planned sneak attack

is  your  best  way  to  begin  any

violent encounter, and you should

actively seek opportunities to  ank

opponents so that you can make

even more use of sneak attacks.

A well-aimed enchantment spell,

such  as  charm  person  or  sleep,

may allow you to avoid a  ght

altogether, but save such assaults

for weaker foes that are more

likely to prove susceptible to

them. Defensive spells such

as shield can give you a nice

edge  in  a   ght  and  may

prove  more  reliable  than

offensive spells.

At 5th level, your death

attack  becomes  one  of  the  most

powerful  weapons  in  your  arsenal.

Studying  your  foe  before  you  strike

is essential, so dont be in a hurry to

enter  combat  if  you  think  you  could

watch from concealment and strike a decisive blow before the

 ght really begins.

Advancement: Cultists of the Shattered Peak believe in the

value  of  information.  Upon  joining  the  cult,  you  receive  few

orders other than Keep your eyes open and Report back when

you  nd information of interest, especially concerning powerful

magic or mages.

Later, you may be called upon to join your fellow cultists on

a mission of particular importance. At this point, you might be

asked to steal a dangerous artifact from the vaults of a powerful

mage, or attack the camp of an evil adventuring party looking

for old magic in Netherese tombs, or assassinate someone who

knows too much.

of fallen Netherils descendants works to prevent the return of

that empire, struggling covertly against the Shades and any mage

they deem too close to discovering Netherils secrets.

BECOMING A

CULTIST OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

Cultists of the Shattered Peak possess skill at arms, stealth, and

a smattering of ancient lore. Most of those now operating in

Faern began their careers as  ghter/rogues. Single-class rogues

or ranger/rogues are also fairly common, though they must wait

until they have gained the requisite combat training. The cults

sometimes ruthless tactics make paladins rare in its ranks, and

arcane spellcasters are simply not permitted.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Race:  Human  of  Netherese  descent  (home  region  Anauroch,

Halruaa, Nimbral, the North, the Ride, Uthgardt Tribesfolk,

or the Western Heartlands).

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Decipher Script 4 ranks, Disable Device 4 ranks, Knowledge

(history) 4 ranks, Speak Language (Loross).

Special: Sneak attack +1d6.

Special: You may not have any levels in an arcane spellcasting

class.

The Cult of the Shattered Peak is a highly secretive society whose

members are all direct descendants of the Netherese. Cult cells

are scattered all across Faern, but the majority are concentrated

within  and  around  the  former  boundaries  of  Netheril.  Many

cultists live among the Bedine tribes of the Anauroch and the

folk  of  the  North  and  Tun.  Smaller  cells  operate  across  the

Western Heartlands, monitoring Netherese ruins both known

and unknown.

Most of the tales about secret Netherese cults depict their

members as power-mad wizards bent on raising the Empire of

Magic  once  again,  or  exploiting  its  secrets  for  personal  gain.

But the Cult of the Shattered Peak bears no resemblance to the

cults in these stories, since its membership includes not a single

arcane spellcaster. The members of this cult recall the hubris of

Netheril and its citizens oppression of those they viewed as lesser

remain dead and buried. To that end, they employ a variety of

tacticsspreading  misinformation,  discrediting  scholars  who

get too close to resurrecting some aspect of Netherese life, and

even outright assassination, if necessary. Their methods may be

ruthless at times, but the cultists  rmly believe that they are

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

As  you  advance,  you  may  want  to  add  levels  of  rogue,

ghter, or ranger as well as levels of cultist because increasing

your stealth, your combat skills, or both is always a good idea.

Pay attention to your spell selection as well. Aim for a mix

of  defensive  spells  (such  as  resist  energy  and  nondetection),

offensive spells (such as touch of idiocy and deep slumber), and

generally useful spells (such as dispel magic, rage, arcane lock,

and heroism). The more varied your spell selection, the more

exibility you have.

Resources: Upon joining the Cult of the Shattered Peak, you

receive a badge or other identifying mark that you must wear

on your clothing at all times, so that other cultists can easily

recognize you. The Cult of the Shattered Peak has at least twenty

such identiers, ranging from scarves tied in a certain manner to

brooches set with a specic type of stone. A DC 15 Spot check

is sufcient to recognize a cultists secret sigil, provided that the

observers know what to look for. In certain special circumstances

(such as the pursuit of a traitor to the cult who knows the sigils),

you may choose not to wear the mark for a short time, but if

you forgo it without good reason, you face stringent loyalty tests

and questioning from cult leaders.

You can also deliver messages to other cult members by means

of a variety of special signs and signals. For example, owers

tied with a green ribbon and hanging upside down in a window

might indicate a cult member in trouble, or a discolored stone

in a cobbled street might indicate a safe house nearby.

CULTISTS OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

IN FAERN

The Cult of the Shattered Peak consists of no more than a few

dozen individuals of widely disparate origins. Of necessity, they

must sift through countless tidbits of from informants, rumor-

mongers, and the stories of travelers for clues as to who might

be seeking ancient Netherese lore. Cultists often assume cover

identities as traveling merchants, peddlers, sellswords, hunters, or

other folk who can wander over great distances without inviting

suspicion.

Organization: The organization of the cult is simple. All

members, called Brothers or Sisters, are free to act as they

see  t  to  achieve  the  organizations  goals.  Bitter  rivalries

sometimes  spring  up  between  individuals  who  embrace  dif-

ferent methods for accomplishing those goals. For example,

members  inclined  toward  evil  tend  to  favor  assassination

and  intimidation,  while  those  inclined  toward  good  prefer

misdirection and suggestion.

The leader of the organization, known as the Master of the

Shattered Peak, is the most senior Brother who is willing to take

on the mantle of leadership. He coordinates the efforts of dozens

of individuals scattered over many lands, communicating through

traveling cult members and secret signs.

The Cult of the Shattered Peak maintains a secret stronghold

in the southern reaches of the Scimitar Spires. There, within the

legendary Shattered Peak, lies a mountain fortress hidden beyond

gaping chasms and torturous cliffs.

NPC Reactions: The few people who are aware of the cult

generally view it as an organization of dangerous, wizard-hating

zealots. Arcanists of any sort are likely to hold unfriendly attitudes

toward known cultists, but most other individuals are indifferent

toward the organization and its goals. In the past, the cult has

often interfered with the activities of Zhentarim wizards skulk-

ing about in the sands of Anauroch, and so the Zhentarim are

almost always hostile toward members of the cult.

Cultists of the Shattered Peak regard magelords (see page

17)  as  cruel  and  dangerous,  and  most  magelords  return  the

sentiment.

CULTISTS OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

IN THE GAME

Any  time  the  PCs  seek  out  the  lost  lore  or  magic  of  fallen

Netheril, they risk drawing the attention of the Cult of the Shat-

tered Peak. The cultists take a dim view of adventurers recklessly

opening  Netherese  tombs  or  unearthing  powerful  Netherese

magic. If intimidation and deception fail to turn the intruders

away, the cult takes decisive action to remove them, either via

its own members or through intermediaries such as mercenaries

or paid assassins.

Conversely, PCs pursuing a villain who seeks ancient Netherese

power, or who simply wields arcane magic cruelly or recklessly,

may  nd  a  secret  ally  in  the  cult.  Cultists  might  provide  the

heroes with information about their adversarys whereabouts and

activities, or even offer the services of a cult scout or assassin to

ensure the defeat of their common foe.

A player character cultist is apt to receive orders or requests

for aid at unexpected times. Not all the characters cult activities

should occur as a result of orders from the cult hierarchy; the

cultist should have plenty of opportunities to discover situations

or information that allow proactive advancement of the cults

interests.

As the cultist accumulates successes in the eld, the character

should acquire more cult contacts. Eventually, he should be in a

position to get information through a network of junior cultists

and have the authority to direct their activities to some degree.

ADAPTATION

The Cult of the Shattered Peak could be active throughout Faern

because foolish, irresponsible, and greedy arcane spellcasters can be

found almost everywhere. Cult cells could monitor (and counter)

the magical activities of the Zhentarim and the Red Wizards of

Thay wherever they operate, and both organizations cover a lot

of territory. Likewise, the cult might be active anywhere arcane

spellcasters hold the reins of power, from the Elven Court to

Rashemen and from the Vilhon Reach to Waterdeep.

ENCOUNTERS

When the PCs explore a mysterious desert ruin and recover a

trove of magic items, the cult decides that they cannot be allowed

to  keep  what  they  have  found.  An  experienced  cultist  known

as Khemal Serist is dispatched to ensure that their discoveries

remain lost to the world.

EL  9:  Khemal  Serist  has  risen  quickly  within  the  cult,

proving  his  effectiveness  and  adaptability  on  a  number  of

missions. Though he has slain a few arcane spellcasters who

could not be turned from their goal of unearthing Netherese

lore,  he  much  prefers  to  distract  opponents,  focusing  their

attention elsewhere when they get too close to knowledge that

should remain lost. Since his target group on this mission has

already recovered artifacts, he must take them back by either

force or guile.

Smite Mage (Su): Once per day, Khemal can attempt to smite

an arcane spellcaster with one normal melee attack, adding +0

to his attack roll and dealing an extra 3 points of damage on a

successful attack. If he accidentally smites a creature that is not

an arcane spellcaster, the smite has no effect, but the ability is

still used up for that day.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Khemal  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against at-footed or anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Khemal can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion (Ex): If Khemal is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Reex saving throw for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Ominous Presence (Ex): Khemal gains a bonus equal to his

cultist of the Shattered Peak level on all Bluff and Intimidate

checks (already gured into the statistics above).

Trapnding (Ex): Khemal can nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device check

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Zeal (Ex): Khemal gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls

against arcane spellcasters and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws

against arcane spells and effects. The bonus on attack rolls does

not apply to a creature with arcane spell-like abilities unless it is

also an arcane spellcaster.

Cultist Spells Prepared (caster level 3rd; 10% arcane spell

failure): 1stcharm person (DC 12), endure elements, shield.

Spellbook: as above plus 1sthold portal, hypnotism, protection

Glorious Servitor

Let the enemies of my lord and god fall before my might. I am his

chosen, and I shall let none stand who dare oppose his will!

Netheris Ket, Glorious Servitor of Sebek

Glorious  servitors  are  exceptionally  loyal  and  devout  servants

of the Mulhorandi gods. Exalted above most other mortals, a

glorious servitor strives to live an exemplary life that embodies

her deitys beliefs and values. She has many rivals and enemies

both inside and outside her deitys cult, but she welcomes any

challenge  that  gives  her  an  opportunity  to  demonstrate  her

faithfulness and dedication.

BECOMING A GLORIOUS SERVITOR

Most glorious servitors are chosen from the multitude of paladins,

clerics, ghters, and monks dwelling throughout the Mulhorandi

lands. Of these, clerics and paladins have the easiest route into

the  prestige  class,  since  they  have  Diplomacy  and  Knowledge

(religion) as class skills. Monks and rangers also take up this holy

cause from time to time, although some of the required skills are

cross-class for them. Those who were rogues or rogue/assassins

before entering this class usually serve Set, while those who were

sorcerers or wizards typically serve Thoth.

The key abilities for a glorious servitor are Charisma (to lead

and  inuence  her  deitys  church),  Wisdom  (to  understand  the

motivations of her religious and political enemies), and Strength

(to ght the battles ahead).

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

As  you  advance,  you  may  want  to  add  levels  of  rogue,

ghter, or ranger as well as levels of cultist because increasing

your stealth, your combat skills, or both is always a good idea.

Pay attention to your spell selection as well. Aim for a mix

of  defensive  spells  (such  as  resist  energy  and  nondetection),

offensive spells (such as touch of idiocy and deep slumber), and

generally useful spells (such as dispel magic, rage, arcane lock,

and heroism). The more varied your spell selection, the more

exibility you have.

Resources: Upon joining the Cult of the Shattered Peak, you

receive a badge or other identifying mark that you must wear

on your clothing at all times, so that other cultists can easily

recognize you. The Cult of the Shattered Peak has at least twenty

such identiers, ranging from scarves tied in a certain manner to

brooches set with a specic type of stone. A DC 15 Spot check

is sufcient to recognize a cultists secret sigil, provided that the

observers know what to look for. In certain special circumstances

(such as the pursuit of a traitor to the cult who knows the sigils),

you may choose not to wear the mark for a short time, but if

you forgo it without good reason, you face stringent loyalty tests

and questioning from cult leaders.

You can also deliver messages to other cult members by means

of a variety of special signs and signals. For example, owers

tied with a green ribbon and hanging upside down in a window

might indicate a cult member in trouble, or a discolored stone

in a cobbled street might indicate a safe house nearby.

CULTISTS OF THE SHATTERED PEAK

IN FAERN

The Cult of the Shattered Peak consists of no more than a few

dozen individuals of widely disparate origins. Of necessity, they

must sift through countless tidbits of from informants, rumor-

mongers, and the stories of travelers for clues as to who might

be seeking ancient Netherese lore. Cultists often assume cover

identities as traveling merchants, peddlers, sellswords, hunters, or

other folk who can wander over great distances without inviting

suspicion.

Organization: The organization of the cult is simple. All

members, called Brothers or Sisters, are free to act as they

see  t  to  achieve  the  organizations  goals.  Bitter  rivalries

sometimes  spring  up  between  individuals  who  embrace  dif-

ferent methods for accomplishing those goals. For example,

members  inclined  toward  evil  tend  to  favor  assassination

and  intimidation,  while  those  inclined  toward  good  prefer

misdirection and suggestion.

The leader of the organization, known as the Master of the

Shattered Peak, is the most senior Brother who is willing to take

on the mantle of leadership. He coordinates the efforts of dozens

of individuals scattered over many lands, communicating through

traveling cult members and secret signs.

The Cult of the Shattered Peak maintains a secret stronghold

in the southern reaches of the Scimitar Spires. There, within the

legendary Shattered Peak, lies a mountain fortress hidden beyond

gaping chasms and torturous cliffs.

NPC Reactions: The few people who are aware of the cult

generally view it as an organization of dangerous, wizard-hating

zealots. Arcanists of any sort are likely to hold unfriendly attitudes

toward known cultists, but most other individuals are indifferent

toward the organization and its goals. In the past, the cult has

often interfered with the activities of Zhentarim wizards skulk-

ing about in the sands of Anauroch, and so the Zhentarim are

almost always hostile toward members of the cult.

Cultists of the Shattered Peak regard magelords (see page

17)  as  cruel  and  dangerous,  and  most  magelords  return  the

sentiment.

it only on yourself, you do not regain hit points for changing

form, and you can assume only the designated shape. This ability

is usable once per day per glorious servitor level.

Your natural attacks in your bestial form are treated as magic

weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Fearlessness  (Su): Because  the  power  of  your  deity  suf-

fuses both your body and your mind, you are immune to fear

effects.

Spell  Resistance  (Su):  Your  deitys  glory  makes  you  more

resistant to magic than other mortals. You gain spell resistance

equal to 12 + your glorious servitor level.

Divine  Shield  (Su):  At  2nd  level,  you  gain  a  +2  de ection

bonus to AC when you are in animal form. This bonus increases

to +4 at 4th level and to +6 at 6th level.

Increased Strength (Ex): Your connection to the divine grants

you great physical strength. At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level, you gain

a +1 inherent bonus to Strength in both your normal and your

bestial form.

Divine  Voice  (Ex):  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  you  can  speak

any languages you know with your normal human voice while

in bestial form. This ability allows you to cast spells with verbal

components normally while in bestial form, although you cannot

cast spells that require somatic components unless you use the

UNFAITHFUL SERVITORS

If  you  willfully  violate  the  orders  of  your  deity,  you  lose  all

supernatural and spell-like abilities of the prestige class and cannot

progress  further  as

a  glorious  servitor.

In  much  the  same

way  as  a  paladin,

you regain your abili-

ties and advancement

potential  if  you  atone

for your violations. You can

also regain your abilities if you

switch allegiance to one of your

deitys rivals in the Mulhorandi

pantheona tactic that earns you

the  unending  enmity  of  your

previous deitys church.

PLAYING A

GLORIOUS SERVITOR

Because  you  maintain  such

a  deep  connection  with  the

divine,  each  action  you

perform  is  in  fact  an  act

of  your  deity.  Those  out-

side  Mulhorand  may

perceive  you  as  just  a

gods pawn, but they are

wrong.  In  Mulhorand,

you  are  more  than  a

heromore even than

a guardian of the people. You

are  a  champion

of  all  that  Mul-

horand  was,  is,  and

will be.

From the moment

you become a glori-

ous servitor, you

play  a  variety

of  roles  on

behalf  of  your

god  and  your

churchmes -

senger,  emissary,

guardian of the sacred

tombs,  and  more.

As you earn greater

trust and accumulate

ever  more  glorious

accomplishments,  your

duties expand to include re-

cruitment, crusading, spying,

assassination, and any other

tasks  that  advance  your  deitys

agenda  in  Mulhorand  and  the  rest  of  Faern.

When you reach the pinnacle of your power, you may be placed

in charge of your own church or awarded a high position within

the government or military.

Combat: The wishes of your deity dictate your approach to

combat. Horus-Re demands fairness and righteous-

ness  from  his  minions,  while  Set  encourages

deception and trickery.

Your spell resistance

can ward off some

magical  attacks,

especially  from

low-level spellcasters,

allowing  you  to  con-

centrate  your  defenses

on  more  formidable

foes. Furthermore, your

Godsight feat and your

true  seeing  ability

allow  you  to  pierce

false  illusions,  identify

your enemies, and see the

world as it truly is.

Your  ability  to

change  shape  is  one

of your gods greatest

gifts  to  you.  In

bestial  form,  you

can travel unnoticed,

especially  through

wilderness  lands,

and   ght  using

the  natural  at-

tacks  of  your

bestial  form.

If  your  form

allows  you  to

fly  or  swim,

you gain still more

strategic  options

in  combat.  When

you  reach  2nd

level,  you  gain

greater protec-

tion  against

attacks  while

in your bestial

form, and that

defense  grows

stronger as you

attain  higher

levels.  At  3rd

level,

your

ability to speak

in  your  bestial

form allows you to

communicate strategic

information  to  your

Netheris Ket,

a glorious servitor of Sebek

is usable once per day per glorious servitor level.

Your natural attacks in your bestial form are treated as magic

fuses both your body and your mind, you are immune to fear

equal to 12 + your glorious servitor level.

bonus to AC when you are in animal form. This bonus increases

Increased Strength (Ex): Your connection to the divine grants

you great physical strength. At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level, you gain

a +1 inherent bonus to Strength in both your normal and your

bestial form.

Divine  Voice  (Ex):  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  you  can  speak

any languages you know with your normal human voice while

components normally while in bestial form, although you cannot

When you reach the pinnacle of your power, you may be placed

in charge of your own church or awarded a high position within

the government or military.

Combat: The wishes of your deity dictate your approach to

combat. Horus-Re demands fairness and righteous-

ness  from  his  minions,  while  Set  encourages

deception and trickery.

Your spell resistance

can ward off some

allies and even cast spells without changing back to humanoid

form. At 5th level, you can use your greater command ability to

stop enemies in their tracks before they can attack you. Finally,

your transformation to outsider at 7th level renders you immune

to many effects that work only against humanoids, though you

are still vulnerable to holy word and other spells and effects that

target outsiders.

Advancement: Before naming a glorious servitor, the church

carefully screens and tests initiates for their loyalty, combat ability,

and faithfulness. Thus, by the time you enter the class, you are

fully aware of your place in your deitys grand scheme.

Your  role  upon  entering  the  prestige  class  is  to  serve  as  a

special  emissary,  agent,  and  troubleshooter  for  your  church.

Your routine duties are likely to involve delivering messages to

outposts, other churches, and the far-ung armies of Mulhorand.

In addition, you may be tasked with hunting down the enemies

of your deity, seeking out lost artifacts and treasures that might

bring glory to your faith, and spying on your churchs enemies

to discover their secrets.

Keeping your ranks maximized in Diplomacy and one or more

Knowledge  skills  is  an  excellent  strategy,  since  knowledgeable

and politically savvy glorious servitors make the most effective

emissaries of the gods. You may also wish to buy ranks in Bluff

and Intimidate if you plan to work in foreign lands where your

deity may not have such a fearsome reputation.

Resources:  The  best  resource  you  have  to  offer  your  com-

patriots is the full support of your church. In addition to gear,

money, and shelter in times of need, the church can offer a wealth

of information. Knowing that you would never willingly cause

harm to your church, the faithful rarely question your actions

and  provide  whatever  support  they  can  without  reservation.

You are also an asset to any group that must navigate the great

bureaucracy of Mulhorand. Because of your high status, your

requests are handled with greater urgency than those of lesser

citizens. Finally, you may be able to use your bestial form to

spy on others and access forbidden areas inconspicuously, thus

reducing the risk to yourself and your comrades.

GLORIOUS SERVITORS IN FAERN

Glorious  servitors  are  found  primarily  in  the  larger  cities  of

Mulhorand, and to a lesser extent in Murghm, Semphar, and

the conquered lands of Unther. The glorious servitors of Horus-

Re  and  Anhur  may  also  be  encountered  in  border  outposts

defending Mulhorand from outside threats. Many of those who

have attained high levels in the prestige class also hold positions

of  importance  in  Mulhorand  society  and  act  on  matters  of

state on behalf of their patron deities. Sets glorious servitors,

however, tend to assume less prominent positions in Mulhorand

so that they can carry out their deitys poisonous plans from

the shadows. Glorious servitors who travel to other regions of

Faern sometimes serve as ambassadors and spies for Mulhorand,

accumulating information while carrying out their deities plans.

Many of those who have attained high levels in the prestige class

hold positions of importance in Mulhorand society and act on

matters of state on behalf of their patron deities.

Glorious servitors have no common organization, since each

is rst and foremost a member of her particular church.

NPC REACTIONS

A glorious servitor is a champion of her faith just as a paladin

or  a  high-level  cleric  is,  and  she  is  treated  in  much  the  same

way by the allies and enemies of her church. Anyone favorably

disposed toward a cleric of Anhur, for instance, should also be

favorably disposed toward a glorious servitor of Anhur. Almost

all  Mulhorandi  begin  with  a  helpful  attitude  toward  glorious

servitors of any deities except Set and Sebek.

Clerics, paladins, and servants of non-Mulhorandi deities are

generally suspicious of a glorious servitors motives and begin

with an indifferent or unfriendly attitude toward her.

GLORIOUS SERVITOR LORE

Characters with Knowledge (religion) can research the vari-

ous  Mulhorandi  deities  to  learn  more  about  their  glorious

servitors.  When  a  character  makes  a  skill  check,  read  or

paraphrase the following material, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: Mulhorandi gods are served by special champions

known as glorious servitors.

DC 15: Glorious servitors often begin their careers as clerics

or paladins but later become elite emissaries and agents of their

gods. Many high-ranking Mulhorandi bureaucrats, generals, and

ofcials are glorious servitors of one god or another.

DC 20: Glorious servitors have a number of special powers,

including the ability to take on the form of creatures sacred to

their gods.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success  can

learn important details about specic glorious servitors in your

campaign.

GLORIOUS SERVITORS IN THE GAME

Most glorious servitors undertake missions on behalf of their

churches  in  the  lands  of  the  Old  Empires.  In  addition,  they

sometimes  investigate  matters  of  interest  to  the  Mulhorandi

in foreign lands. They often explore newly discovered dungeons,

work against Thayan agents, and spy out the strength of various

rulers and wizards.

As  a  character  attains  higher  levels  in  the  prestige  class,

she  gains  increasing  fame  among  the  faithful.  This  added

recognition means that she receives an increasing number of

requests for assistance and advice from rank-and-le members

of her church. Likewise, she becomes a target for enemies of

the faithparticularly the glorious servitors of rival gods. But

fame isnt all badthe character can expect a warm welcome

and a good dose of hospitality whenever she visits a place where

her  patron  is  venerated.  Members  of  the  faithful  may  also

be able to provide useful information or timely warnings of

impending trouble. Requests for aid arent always troublesome,

eitherthe  character  can  accept  or  reject  tasks  at  her  own

discretion (though she cant expect to go far if she makes a habit

of atly refusing orders from superiors), and some missions can

lead to satisfying and protable adventures as well as increased

rank and status in the faith. A senior glorious servitor seldom

gets ordered around, and she may even get a chance to give a

few orders of her own.

ADAPTATION

In  campaigns  set  outside  Mulhorand  and  its  environs,  most

glorious servitors have connections with a Mulhorandi enclave

of some kind. Some such enclaves are mercantile (a group of

Mulhorandi families conducting business in a foreign land, for

example); others have a diplomatic function (such as the neigh-

borhood around a Mulhorandi embassy in a foreign capital). A

glorious servitor operating in foreign lands might be asked to

serve as a scout or spy, or to carry out some other clandestine

mission. She can also serve as a missionary for her faith outside

her own country.

ENCOUNTERS

When  the  PCs  investigate  reports  of  slavers  operating  in  the

coastal  marshes  along  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Shores,  they  nd  a

glorious servitor of Sebek acquiring slaves to send back to her

masters in Gheldaneth.

EL  12:  Netheris  Ket  has  fought  hard  to  gain  her  exalted

position within the cult of Sebek. Now that she has access to

her deitys giant crocodile form, she uses it frequently to inspire

loyalty in her followers. She scouted this area in her bestial form,

planned the slave-gathering operation, then moved her followers

into position. When accosted by the PCs, Netheris attempts to talk

her way out of the situation using her Diplomacy skill. Should

that tactic fail, she begins combat with spellcasting, then closes

for melee in her bestial form.

Bestial Form (Su): Three times per day, Netheris can assume

the form of a giant crocodile as a standard action and remain in

that form for up to 1 hour. This ability functions like a polymorph

she does not regain hit points for changing form, and she can

assume only the giant crocodile form.

Divine Shield (Su): Netheris gains a +2 deection bonus to

AC when she is in giant crocodile form.

Divine  Voice  (Ex):  Netheris  can  speak  any  languages  she

knows with her normal human voice while in giant crocodile

form. This ability allows her to cast spells with verbal components

normally while in bestial form.

Fearlessness (Su): Netheris is immune to fear effects.

Increased Strength (Ex): Netheris has a +1 inherent bonus to

Strength in both her humanoid and her giant crocodile form.

Magelord

So they ran me out of Secomber. They said I wasnt good enough.

They said my spells were too weak. Now they will see what kind

of wizard Ive become. Theyll see. Wholl be sorry then?

Rimmen the Magelord

Quick to anger, haughty, and proud of his Art, the magelord is

an arcane spellcaster who studies an ancient magical tradition

known for extremely fast and versatile spellcasting. Sometimes

a spellslinger for hire, sometimes a professional arcane duelist,

the typical magelord believes he has the right to wring respect,

wealth, and power from the world around him through the use

of arcane force. In reality, he is little more than a cruel bandit

lord who uses his magical gifts to dominate and intimidate less

talented individuals.

Like a school of fencing or a martial arts style, the magelord

tradition  has  been  passed  down  over  the  centuries  from  one

practitioner to another. Few magelords give away such knowl-

edgeindeed, anyone who would study this aspect of the Art

must either bribe a magelord with princely gifts and service or

undertake years of research to unearth ancient texts describing

the techniques.

The way of the magelord rewards ambition and recklessness,

and it tends to encourage a certain contempt for the risks of

power. Thus, most magelords regard their power as a tool with

which to fulll their own desires as opposed to a gift they can

use to serve others. A few, however, study magelord lore in hopes

of using their magic against tyranny and injustice.

allies and even cast spells without changing back to humanoid

form. At 5th level, you can use your greater command ability to

stop enemies in their tracks before they can attack you. Finally,

your transformation to outsider at 7th level renders you immune

to many effects that work only against humanoids, though you

are still vulnerable to holy word and other spells and effects that

target outsiders.

Advancement: Before naming a glorious servitor, the church

carefully screens and tests initiates for their loyalty, combat ability,

and faithfulness. Thus, by the time you enter the class, you are

fully aware of your place in your deitys grand scheme.

Your  role  upon  entering  the  prestige  class  is  to  serve  as  a

special  emissary,  agent,  and  troubleshooter  for  your  church.

Your routine duties are likely to involve delivering messages to

outposts, other churches, and the far-ung armies of Mulhorand.

In addition, you may be tasked with hunting down the enemies

of your deity, seeking out lost artifacts and treasures that might

bring glory to your faith, and spying on your churchs enemies

to discover their secrets.

Keeping your ranks maximized in Diplomacy and one or more

Knowledge  skills  is  an  excellent  strategy,  since  knowledgeable

and politically savvy glorious servitors make the most effective

emissaries of the gods. You may also wish to buy ranks in Bluff

and Intimidate if you plan to work in foreign lands where your

deity may not have such a fearsome reputation.

Resources:  The  best  resource  you  have  to  offer  your  com-

patriots is the full support of your church. In addition to gear,

money, and shelter in times of need, the church can offer a wealth

of information. Knowing that you would never willingly cause

harm to your church, the faithful rarely question your actions

and  provide  whatever  support  they  can  without  reservation.

You are also an asset to any group that must navigate the great

bureaucracy of Mulhorand. Because of your high status, your

requests are handled with greater urgency than those of lesser

citizens. Finally, you may be able to use your bestial form to

spy on others and access forbidden areas inconspicuously, thus

reducing the risk to yourself and your comrades.

GLORIOUS SERVITORS IN FAERN

Glorious  servitors  are  found  primarily  in  the  larger  cities  of

Mulhorand, and to a lesser extent in Murghm, Semphar, and

the conquered lands of Unther. The glorious servitors of Horus-

Re  and  Anhur  may  also  be  encountered  in  border  outposts

defending Mulhorand from outside threats. Many of those who

have attained high levels in the prestige class also hold positions

of  importance  in  Mulhorand  society  and  act  on  matters  of

state on behalf of their patron deities. Sets glorious servitors,

however, tend to assume less prominent positions in Mulhorand

so that they can carry out their deitys poisonous plans from

the shadows. Glorious servitors who travel to other regions of

Faern sometimes serve as ambassadors and spies for Mulhorand,

accumulating information while carrying out their deities plans.

Many of those who have attained high levels in the prestige class

hold positions of importance in Mulhorand society and act on

matters of state on behalf of their patron deities.

Glorious servitors have no common organization, since each

is rst and foremost a member of her particular church.

NPC REACTIONS

A glorious servitor is a champion of her faith just as a paladin

or  a  high-level  cleric  is,  and  she  is  treated  in  much  the  same

way by the allies and enemies of her church. Anyone favorably

disposed toward a cleric of Anhur, for instance, should also be

favorably disposed toward a glorious servitor of Anhur. Almost

all  Mulhorandi  begin  with  a  helpful  attitude  toward  glorious

servitors of any deities except Set and Sebek.

Clerics, paladins, and servants of non-Mulhorandi deities are

generally suspicious of a glorious servitors motives and begin

with an indifferent or unfriendly attitude toward her.

GLORIOUS SERVITOR LORE

Characters with Knowledge (religion) can research the vari-

ous  Mulhorandi  deities  to  learn  more  about  their  glorious

servitors.  When  a  character  makes  a  skill  check,  read  or

paraphrase the following material, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: Mulhorandi gods are served by special champions

known as glorious servitors.

DC 15: Glorious servitors often begin their careers as clerics

or paladins but later become elite emissaries and agents of their

gods. Many high-ranking Mulhorandi bureaucrats, generals, and

ofcials are glorious servitors of one god or another.

DC 20: Glorious servitors have a number of special powers,

including the ability to take on the form of creatures sacred to

their gods.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success  can

learn important details about specic glorious servitors in your

campaign.

GLORIOUS SERVITORS IN THE GAME

Most glorious servitors undertake missions on behalf of their

churches  in  the  lands  of  the  Old  Empires.  In  addition,  they

sometimes  investigate  matters  of  interest  to  the  Mulhorandi

in foreign lands. They often explore newly discovered dungeons,

work against Thayan agents, and spy out the strength of various

rulers and wizards.

As  a  character  attains  higher  levels  in  the  prestige  class,

she  gains  increasing  fame  among  the  faithful.  This  added

recognition means that she receives an increasing number of

requests for assistance and advice from rank-and-le members

of her church. Likewise, she becomes a target for enemies of

the faithparticularly the glorious servitors of rival gods. But

fame isnt all badthe character can expect a warm welcome

and a good dose of hospitality whenever she visits a place where

her  patron  is  venerated.  Members  of  the  faithful  may  also

be able to provide useful information or timely warnings of

impending trouble. Requests for aid arent always troublesome,

eitherthe  character  can  accept  or  reject  tasks  at  her  own

discretion (though she cant expect to go far if she makes a habit

of atly refusing orders from superiors), and some missions can

lead to satisfying and protable adventures as well as increased

rank and status in the faith. A senior glorious servitor seldom

gets ordered around, and she may even get a chance to give a

few orders of her own.

ADAPTATION

In  campaigns  set  outside  Mulhorand  and  its  environs,  most

glorious servitors have connections with a Mulhorandi enclave

of some kind. Some such enclaves are mercantile (a group of

Mulhorandi families conducting business in a foreign land, for

example); others have a diplomatic function (such as the neigh-

borhood around a Mulhorandi embassy in a foreign capital). A

glorious servitor operating in foreign lands might be asked to

serve as a scout or spy, or to carry out some other clandestine

mission. She can also serve as a missionary for her faith outside

her own country.

ENCOUNTERS

When  the  PCs  investigate  reports  of  slavers  operating  in  the

coastal  marshes  along  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Shores,  they  nd  a

glorious servitor of Sebek acquiring slaves to send back to her

masters in Gheldaneth.

EL  12:  Netheris  Ket  has  fought  hard  to  gain  her  exalted

position within the cult of Sebek. Now that she has access to

her deitys giant crocodile form, she uses it frequently to inspire

loyalty in her followers. She scouted this area in her bestial form,

planned the slave-gathering operation, then moved her followers

into position. When accosted by the PCs, Netheris attempts to talk

her way out of the situation using her Diplomacy skill. Should

that tactic fail, she begins combat with spellcasting, then closes

for melee in her bestial form.

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

Magelords are relatively rare, but societies and fellowships of

them have arisen in many lands over the centuries. The most

famous of these was based in the old realm of Athalantar, the

Kingdom of the Stag. Bards still sing of the cruelty and evil of

the magelords who ruled over the nation, evoking terrible images

of a century when tyranny and deadly ambition reigned. The

wizards of the Stag Kingdom were cruel, avaricious, driven men

with an exceptional talent for magic. Ostensibly, they served as

high of cials of the realm who brutally enforced their princes

will, but in truth they ruled the Stag Kingdom from behind the

throne.

BECOMING A MAGELORD

You must  nd a practicing magelord and persuade her to teach

you the secret techniques of using magic in the magelord style.

This process usually requires you to spend at least ten days in

that wizards company and either pay her at least 10,000 gp or

offer a service of equivalent value. If you cannot  nd a magelord

willing to tutor you, you can research the secret traditions of the

magelords on your own. To do so, you must locate and obtain

rare tomes and treatises costing at least 10,000 gp and spend

1  month  practicing  the  techniques  described  therein.  You  can

ful ll this requirement at any point in your arcane career prior

to adding a level of magelord, so you need not wait until you are

ready to advance to do so.

Wizards, wizard/rogues, and wizard/assassins make excellent

magelords, and wizard/blackguards are also good candidates for

this class. Wizard/ ghters are more rare, though their  ghting

ability lends itself well to this prestige class.

Intelligence is the most important ability for a magelord, since

it bears directly on spellcasting. Constitution is also important,

since magelords tend to live in uncivilized lands and often engage

in combat, making Concentration checks a frequent necessity.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Skills: Intimidate 3 ranks, Knowledge (history) 6 ranks, Knowl-

edge (arcana) 6 ranks.

TABLE 15: THE MAGELORD  HIT DIE: D4

Feats:  Improved  Initiative,  Spell  Mastery,  Signature  SpellPG,

Weapon Focus (ray).

Spells: Ability to cast 5th-level arcane spells.

Special: You must have the evasion special quality as either a

class feature or a racial trait.

Special: You may not be lawful in alignment.

Special: You must be tutored by a magelord or obtain rare tomes

to study the tradition. Either option costs no less than 10,000

gp or a service of equivalent value.

CLASS FEATURES

The magelord tradition emphasizes mastery of a variety of spells

and teaches practitioners to employ mastered spells with greater

speed and  exibility. All the following are class features of the

magelord prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: You gain no new pro ciency

with weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: At each magelord level, you gain new spells per

day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable)

as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class

to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You

do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that class

would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting

class before becoming a magelord, you must decide to which class

to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,

caster level, and spells known.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, you deal extra

damage  when  you  are   anking  an  opponent  or  at  any  time

when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra

damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within

30  feet.  See  the  rogue  class  feature,  page  50  of  the Players

Handbook.

Bonus Mastered Spell (Ex): When you attain 2nd level, you

can choose one spell that you already know. From that point on,

you can prepare that spell without referring to a spellbook, as

if you had chosen to master it with the Spell Mastery feat. You

can choose another known spell to master in this manner at 4th,

6th, and 8th level.

Signature Supremacy (Ex): By 3rd level, you have become

so familiar with your mastered spells that you can convert any

4th-level  or  lower  prepared  spell  into  any  4th-level  or  lower

mastered  spell,  just  as  a  good  cleric  can  spontaneously  cast

prepared spells as cure spells. Upon attaining 7th level, you can

convert any 9th-level or lower prepared spell into a 9th-level or

lower mastered spell in the same manner.

Magelord Mastery (Ex): At 10th level, you can apply one or

more metamagic feats that you know to a spell that

you have converted to a mastered spell by means

of  either  the  signature  supremacy  ability  or  the

Signature  Spell  feat.  The  level  of  the  prepared

spell to be converted must equal or exceed that of the

mastered spell with the desired metamagic feats applied.

For example, you could convert the 5th-level prepared

spell teleport into the 1st-level mastered spell magic missile

modi ed by the Empower Spell, Still Spell and Silent

Spell feats.

PLAYING A MAGELORD

To survive and thrive in their treacherous world,

the original magelords of Athalantar developed

a highly resourceful means of handling spells.

Their new ways of managing magic gave them

more personal power, a better chance to survive,

and a variety of ways to eliminate foes. Now those

 rst magelords are gone, and their power is yours.

You can be as intimidating as a thug, as stealthy

as a rogue, and as murderous as an assassin

without sacri cing the ability to cast potent

arcane spells.

You answer to no one and use

your power as you see  t. Though

you aid others when doing so suits

your purpose, no organization sup-

ports your ways or offers you resources.

Combat: You have learned to wield magic

in an incredibly  exible manner. Initially, you can use

spells that keep you out of sight (such as invisibility) to

increase  your  opportunities  for  sneak  attacks.  At  3rd

level, you can swap out a mid-level or low-level prepared

spell for a mastered spell on the  y, and at 7th

level, you can swap out any prepared spell for

any mastered spell.

The key to success as a magelord is to select

your mastered spells carefully. If you prefer a

defensive approach to combat, master spells that

provide instant protection or a quick escape. If you

want to be ready for a  ght at any time, master a good selection

of offensive spells. With the offensive option, for example, you

should master attack spells such as magic missile, scorching ray,

 reball, phantasmal killer, and cloudkill. You can then prepare

defensive  or  generally  useful  spells,  such  as  shield,  protection

from  arrows,   y,  globe  of  invulnerability,  and  wall  of  stone,

and swap them out for attack spells as needed. This approach

to spell selection allows you to be prepared for most situations

you might face and still have a good selection of spells available

for attack.

Finally, when you reach the pinnacle of magelord power, you

can apply metamagic feats to mastered spells during casting.

Advancement:  Your  versatile  command  of  magic  is  your

greatest asset, so maximizing the advantage it provides is the

wisest  course.  Whenever  you  become  eligible  for  another

feat,  consider  taking  Spell  Mastery  again.  After  all,  the

more  spells  you  master,  the  less  you  must  rely  on  a

spellbooka  distinct  advantage  if  you  must  travel

light or if your spellbooks are stolen. If you plan on

taking Spell Mastery multiple times, increase

your  Intelligence  to  maximize  the  bene t

it  offers.  In  addition,  you  should  consider

taking metamagic feats that power up your

already formidable  spellcasting ability.

A number of skills can also provide

considerable bene t for you. Improv-

ing  your  stealth-oriented  skills  aids

you in making sneak attacks, which

augment  your  combat  prowess  con-

siderably.  In  addition,  purchasing

some ranks in Bluff and Intimidate

to back up the threat of your magic

is a wise move.

Resources:  Like  all  magelords,  you

are  a  loner.  Anyone  else  who  follows

this path is a rival, not an ally. You

must rely on yourself, because no one

else is trustworthyand that is as

it should be.

MAGELORDS

IN FAERN

Because magelords often hire them-

selves  out  to  anyone  willing  to  meet  their

prices, they can be found almost anywhere

in Faern. However, their generally greedy

and ambitious nature makes them likely

to switch employers on the spot when a

better deal presents itself. In fact, its not

uncommon for a hired spellslinger to

become  the  master  of  the  house  if

his employer proves weak or foolish.

Magelords   ourish  in  lands  without  a

strong  central  authority,  particularly

places where an individuals wits, skill, and ruthlessness offer the

best opportunities for personal gain, and where issues of law are

settled by tests of individual strength.

The fact that no societies or fellowships of magelords exist in

Faern today is probably a result of the fact that most magelords

are loners. However, if a group of them were to  nd common

cause, a new society could arise at any time.

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

Magelords are relatively rare, but societies and fellowships of

them have arisen in many lands over the centuries. The most

famous of these was based in the old realm of Athalantar, the

Kingdom of the Stag. Bards still sing of the cruelty and evil of

the magelords who ruled over the nation, evoking terrible images

of a century when tyranny and deadly ambition reigned. The

wizards of the Stag Kingdom were cruel, avaricious, driven men

with an exceptional talent for magic. Ostensibly, they served as

high of cials of the realm who brutally enforced their princes

will, but in truth they ruled the Stag Kingdom from behind the

throne.

BECOMING A MAGELORD

You must  nd a practicing magelord and persuade her to teach

you the secret techniques of using magic in the magelord style.

This process usually requires you to spend at least ten days in

that wizards company and either pay her at least 10,000 gp or

offer a service of equivalent value. If you cannot  nd a magelord

willing to tutor you, you can research the secret traditions of the

magelords on your own. To do so, you must locate and obtain

rare tomes and treatises costing at least 10,000 gp and spend

1  month  practicing  the  techniques  described  therein.  You  can

ful ll this requirement at any point in your arcane career prior

to adding a level of magelord, so you need not wait until you are

ready to advance to do so.

Wizards, wizard/rogues, and wizard/assassins make excellent

magelords, and wizard/blackguards are also good candidates for

this class. Wizard/ ghters are more rare, though their  ghting

ability lends itself well to this prestige class.

Intelligence is the most important ability for a magelord, since

it bears directly on spellcasting. Constitution is also important,

since magelords tend to live in uncivilized lands and often engage

in combat, making Concentration checks a frequent necessity.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Skills: Intimidate 3 ranks, Knowledge (history) 6 ranks, Knowl-

edge (arcana) 6 ranks.

TABLE 15: THE MAGELORD  HIT DIE: D4

Feats:  Improved  Initiative,  Spell  Mastery,  Signature  SpellPG,

Weapon Focus (ray).

Spells: Ability to cast 5th-level arcane spells.

Special: You must have the evasion special quality as either a

class feature or a racial trait.

Special: You may not be lawful in alignment.

Special: You must be tutored by a magelord or obtain rare tomes

to study the tradition. Either option costs no less than 10,000

gp or a service of equivalent value.

CLASS FEATURES

The magelord tradition emphasizes mastery of a variety of spells

and teaches practitioners to employ mastered spells with greater

speed and  exibility. All the following are class features of the

magelord prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: You gain no new pro ciency

with weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: At each magelord level, you gain new spells per

day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable)

as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class

to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You

do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that class

would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting

class before becoming a magelord, you must decide to which class

to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,

caster level, and spells known.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, you deal extra

damage  when  you  are   anking  an  opponent  or  at  any  time

when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra

damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within

30  feet.  See  the  rogue  class  feature,  page  50  of  the  Players

Handbook.

Bonus Mastered Spell (Ex): When you attain 2nd level, you

can choose one spell that you already know. From that point on,

you can prepare that spell without referring to a spellbook, as

if you had chosen to master it with the Spell Mastery feat. You

can choose another known spell to master in this manner at 4th,

6th, and 8th level.

Signature Supremacy (Ex): By 3rd level, you have become

so familiar with your mastered spells that you can convert any

4th-level  or  lower  prepared  spell  into  any  4th-level  or  lower

mastered  spell,  just  as  a  good  cleric  can  spontaneously  cast

prepared spells as cure spells. Upon attaining 7th level, you can

convert any 9th-level or lower prepared spell into a 9th-level or

lower mastered spell in the same manner.

Magelord Mastery (Ex): At 10th level, you can apply one or

more metamagic feats that you know to a spell that

you have converted to a mastered spell by means

of  either  the  signature  supremacy  ability  or  the

Signature  Spell  feat.  The  level  of  the  prepared

spell to be converted must equal or exceed that of the

mastered spell with the desired metamagic feats applied.

For example, you could convert the 5th-level prepared

spell teleport into the 1st-level mastered spell magic missile

modi ed by the Empower Spell, Still Spell and Silent

Spell feats.

PLAYING A MAGELORD

To survive and thrive in their treacherous world,

the original magelords of Athalantar developed

a highly resourceful means of handling spells.

Their new ways of managing magic gave them

more personal power, a better chance to survive,

and a variety of ways to eliminate foes. Now those

 rst magelords are gone, and their power is yours.

You can be as intimidating as a thug, as stealthy

as a rogue, and as murderous as an assassin

without sacri cing the ability to cast potent

arcane spells.

You answer to no one and use

your power as you see  t. Though

you aid others when doing so suits

your purpose, no organization sup-

ports your ways or offers you resources.

Combat: You have learned to wield magic

in an incredibly  exible manner. Initially, you can use

spells that keep you out of sight (such as invisibility) to

increase  your  opportunities  for  sneak  attacks.  At  3rd

level, you can swap out a mid-level or low-level prepared

spell for a mastered spell on the  y, and at 7th

level, you can swap out any prepared spell for

any mastered spell.

The key to success as a magelord is to select

your mastered spells carefully. If you prefer a

defensive approach to combat, master spells that

provide instant protection or a quick escape. If you

want to be ready for a  ght at any time, master a good selection

of offensive spells. With the offensive option, for example, you

should master attack spells such as magic missile, scorching ray,

 reball, phantasmal killer, and cloudkill. You can then prepare

defensive  or  generally  useful  spells,  such  as  shield,  protection

from  arrows,   y,  globe  of  invulnerability,  and  wall  of  stone,

and swap them out for attack spells as needed. This approach

to spell selection allows you to be prepared for most situations

you might face and still have a good selection of spells available

for attack.

Finally, when you reach the pinnacle of magelord power, you

can apply metamagic feats to mastered spells during casting.

Advancement:  Your  versatile  command  of  magic  is  your

greatest asset, so maximizing the advantage it provides is the

wisest  course.  Whenever  you  become  eligible  for  another

feat,  consider  taking  Spell  Mastery  again.  After  all,  the

more  spells  you  master,  the  less  you  must  rely  on  a

spellbooka  distinct  advantage  if  you  must  travel

light or if your spellbooks are stolen. If you plan on

taking Spell Mastery multiple times, increase

your  Intelligence  to  maximize  the  bene t

it  offers.  In  addition,  you  should  consider

taking metamagic feats that power up your

already formidable  spellcasting ability.

A number of skills can also provide

considerable bene t for you. Improv-

ing  your  stealth-oriented  skills  aids

you in making sneak attacks, which

augment  your  combat  prowess  con-

siderably.  In  addition,  purchasing

some ranks in Bluff and Intimidate

to back up the threat of your magic

is a wise move.

Resources:  Like  all  magelords,  you

are  a  loner.  Anyone  else  who  follows

this path is a rival, not an ally. You

must rely on yourself, because no one

else is trustworthyand that is as

it should be.

MAGELORDS

IN FAERN

Because magelords often hire them-

selves  out  to  anyone  willing  to  meet  their

prices, they can be found almost anywhere

in Faern. However, their generally greedy

and ambitious nature makes them likely

to switch employers on the spot when a

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

NPC REACTIONS

Most people regard hired spellcasters as cold-hearted mercenar-

ies who are reliable only to the limits of their own self-interest.

Magelords in Faern are viewed in much the same way. All too

often, these wizard-robed thieves and tyrants use their power to

plunder and dominate those who lack the strength to stop them.

On the bright side, very few nonarcanists can really distinguish

between a magelord and any other kind of wizard, so few people

are prejudiced against magelords in particular. Thus, a magelord

can expect the same welcome that any wizard would receive in

a town or city.

Other  wizards  are  usually  indifferent  or  unfriendly  toward

the magelord because of his obvious contempt for the Art in its

traditional form.

MAGELORD LORE

Characters with Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history) can

research the magelord tradition and nd information on notable

magelords  (or  magelord  societies)  and  their  actions.  When  a

character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following

material, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Wizards who call themselves magelords are skillful,

quick, and often quite proud and cruel as well.

DC 15: At best, magelords are spellslingers or duelists-for-

hire. More often, however, they are petty tyrants and villains

who use their magic to plunder and dominate the weak. In the

past, societies of magelords have virtually ruled kingdoms, such

as ancient Athalantar.

DC 20: Their magical tradition emphasizes the alteration or

exchange of spells on the y, so that they always have battle-spells

ready and are rarely caught without a good offense or defense at

hand.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can learn

important details about specic magelords in your campaign.

MAGELORDS IN THE GAME

Evil  magelords  make  excellent  adversaries  for  good-aligned

adventurers.  Defeating  a  black-hearted  wizard  whose  spells

and hired swords are terrorizing a town is a classic adventure.

Magelords may also appear as hired muscle in the service of

other, more powerful lords. Despite their tarnished reputation,

many  magelords  are  perfectly  content  to  work  for  good-  or

neutral-aligned  princes  and  nobles.  Such  magelords  tend  to

remain  quite  loyal  as  long  as  their  employer  rewards  them

handsomely for their services.

Most magelords dont require much in the way of specialized

adventures to be happy. However, having a magelord in the game

can provide lots of adventure opportunities. As a magelord gains

power and accumulates successes, the demand for his specic abili-

ties increases. Likewise, a high-prole magelord tends to attract

rivals in much the same way that notorious gunghters once

did in the American west. Finally, most magelords (particularly

those who delight in mayhem) are natural foes for the Cult of

the Shattered Peak.

ADAPTATION

Experienced magelords can be found almost anywhere in Faern,

but prospective magelords might nd it necessary to visit a locale

where  wizards  congregate  in  order  to  locate  tutors  or  acquire

the necessary research materials. Such locales include regions in

which wizards are a preferred class (see page 28 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting).

ENCOUNTERS

An enemy of the PCs hires a magelord to hunt down and destroy

the  party  leader  (preferably  an  arcane  spellcaster)  to  punish

the PCs for their previous interference in his plans. Claiming

that the character in question is holding stolen property, the

magelord  Rimmen  of  the  Scarlet  Eye  challenges  her  to  an

arcane duel.

EL 14: Rimmen shares the attitude of the old magelords of

Athalantar that arcane might entitles the bearer to take what he

wants. He enjoys showing off his power and intimidating others

with it. In combat, he uses defensive spells to prepare if he has

the chance, but he readily converts any nonattack spells he has

left to reball, magic missile, or disintegrate during battle.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Rimmen deals an extra 2d6 points of

damage on any successful attack against at-footed or anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Rimmen can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Rimmen  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally allows him to attempt a Reex saving throw for half

damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Familiar: Rimmens familiar is a weasel named Shensa. The

familiar uses the better of her own and Rimmens base save bo-

nuses. The creatures abilities and characteristics are summarized

below.

Familiar Benets: Rimmen gains special benets from having

a familiar. This creature grants Rimmen a +2 bonus on Reex

saves.

Alertness (Ex): *Shensa grants her master Alertness as long

as she is within 5 feet.

Empathic Link (Su): Rimmen can communicate telepathi-

cally with his familiar at a distance of up to 1 mile. The master

has the same connection to an item or a place that the familiar

does.

Share Spells (Su): Rimmen can have any spell he casts on

himself also affect his familiar if the latter is within 5 feet at

the time. He can also cast a spell with a target of You on his

familiar.

Signature Supremacy (Ex): Rimmen can convert any 4th-

level or lower prepared spell into any 4th-level or lower mastered

spell, just as a good cleric can spontaneously cast prepared spells

as cure spells.

Trapnding (Ex): Rimmen can nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device check

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Attach (Ex): If Shensa hits with a bite attack, she uses her

powerful jaws to latch onto the opponents body and automatically

deals bite damage each round. She loses her Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class and has an AC of 12. While attached, Shensa can

be struck with a weapon or grappled herself (by achieving a pin

against her).

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): Shensa can deliver touch spells for

Rimmen (see Familiars, page 52 of the Players Handbook).

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Shensa is exposed to any effect

that normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw

and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Speak with Master (Ex): Shensa can communicate verbally

with Rimmen. Other creatures do not understand the communica-

tion without magical help.

Speak with Weasels (Ex): Shensa can speak with weasels,

minks,  polecats,  ermines,  skunks,  wolverines,  badgers,  dire

weasels, and other creatures of the family Mustelidae. Such

communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing

creatures.

Skills: Shensa has a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks

and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Hide checks. She uses her

Dexterity modier instead of her Strength modier for Climb

checks. She can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even

if rushed or threatened.

Olin Gisir

Hush! Know that we walk in the ruins of the temple of Astaroth,

a demon lord of the Abyss. It is said that the demon sleeps here

still, seeking to poison the words of those who wander in. Luckily,

I know just the spells to ensure that he remains asleep. . . .

Meraera of the Olin Gisiae

As all Faernians know, elves have very long memories. Events

that took place thousands of years ago and have been largely

forgotten by the shorter-lived races are still fresh in the minds

of  the  elves,  since  they  occurred  only  a  generation  or  so  ago

from their perspective. Along with such clear memories comes

considerable knowledge, some of which is best kept secret.

The  Olin  Gisiae  (which  means  secret  keepers  in  Elven;

singular Olin Gisir) are elite elf mages who have taken it upon

themselves to guard these dark secrets from the rest of the world,

ensuring that ancient demons remain bound away in protective

circles,  unholy  artifacts  remain  forgotten,  and  places  of  dark

power remain unvisited by mortals.

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

NPC REACTIONS

Most people regard hired spellcasters as cold-hearted mercenar-

ies who are reliable only to the limits of their own self-interest.

Magelords in Faern are viewed in much the same way. All too

often, these wizard-robed thieves and tyrants use their power to

plunder and dominate those who lack the strength to stop them.

On the bright side, very few nonarcanists can really distinguish

between a magelord and any other kind of wizard, so few people

are prejudiced against magelords in particular. Thus, a magelord

can expect the same welcome that any wizard would receive in

a town or city.

Other  wizards  are  usually  indifferent  or  unfriendly  toward

the magelord because of his obvious contempt for the Art in its

traditional form.

MAGELORD LORE

Characters with Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history) can

research the magelord tradition and nd information on notable

magelords  (or  magelord  societies)  and  their  actions.  When  a

character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following

material, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Wizards who call themselves magelords are skillful,

quick, and often quite proud and cruel as well.

DC 15: At best, magelords are spellslingers or duelists-for-

hire. More often, however, they are petty tyrants and villains

who use their magic to plunder and dominate the weak. In the

past, societies of magelords have virtually ruled kingdoms, such

as ancient Athalantar.

DC 20: Their magical tradition emphasizes the alteration or

exchange of spells on the y, so that they always have battle-spells

ready and are rarely caught without a good offense or defense at

hand.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can learn

important details about specic magelords in your campaign.

MAGELORDS IN THE GAME

Evil  magelords  make  excellent  adversaries  for  good-aligned

adventurers.  Defeating  a  black-hearted  wizard  whose  spells

and hired swords are terrorizing a town is a classic adventure.

Magelords may also appear as hired muscle in the service of

other, more powerful lords. Despite their tarnished reputation,

many  magelords  are  perfectly  content  to  work  for  good-  or

neutral-aligned  princes  and  nobles.  Such  magelords  tend  to

remain  quite  loyal  as  long  as  their  employer  rewards  them

handsomely for their services.

Most magelords dont require much in the way of specialized

adventures to be happy. However, having a magelord in the game

can provide lots of adventure opportunities. As a magelord gains

power and accumulates successes, the demand for his specic abili-

ties increases. Likewise, a high-prole magelord tends to attract

rivals in much the same way that notorious gunghters once

did in the American west. Finally, most magelords (particularly

those who delight in mayhem) are natural foes for the Cult of

the Shattered Peak.

ADAPTATION

Experienced magelords can be found almost anywhere in Faern,

but prospective magelords might nd it necessary to visit a locale

where  wizards  congregate  in  order  to  locate  tutors  or  acquire

the necessary research materials. Such locales include regions in

which wizards are a preferred class (see page 28 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting).

ENCOUNTERS

An enemy of the PCs hires a magelord to hunt down and destroy

the  party  leader  (preferably  an  arcane  spellcaster)  to  punish

the PCs for their previous interference in his plans. Claiming

that the character in question is holding stolen property, the

magelord  Rimmen  of  the  Scarlet  Eye  challenges  her  to  an

arcane duel.

EL 14: Rimmen shares the attitude of the old magelords of

Athalantar that arcane might entitles the bearer to take what he

wants. He enjoys showing off his power and intimidating others

with it. In combat, he uses defensive spells to prepare if he has

the chance, but he readily converts any nonattack spells he has

left to reball, magic missile, or disintegrate during battle.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Rimmen deals an extra 2d6 points of

damage on any successful attack against at-footed or anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Rimmen can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Rimmen  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally allows him to attempt a Reex saving throw for half

damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Familiar: Rimmens familiar is a weasel named Shensa. The

familiar uses the better of her own and Rimmens base save bo-

nuses. The creatures abilities and characteristics are summarized

below.

Familiar Benets: Rimmen gains special benets from having

a familiar. This creature grants Rimmen a +2 bonus on Reex

saves.

Alertness (Ex): *Shensa grants her master Alertness as long

as she is within 5 feet.

Empathic Link (Su): Rimmen can communicate telepathi-

cally with his familiar at a distance of up to 1 mile. The master

has the same connection to an item or a place that the familiar

does.

Share Spells (Su): Rimmen can have any spell he casts on

himself also affect his familiar if the latter is within 5 feet at

the time. He can also cast a spell with a target of You on his

familiar.

Signature Supremacy (Ex): Rimmen can convert any 4th-

level or lower prepared spell into any 4th-level or lower mastered

spell, just as a good cleric can spontaneously cast prepared spells

as cure spells.

Trapnding (Ex): Rimmen can nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device check

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Attach (Ex): If Shensa hits with a bite attack, she uses her

powerful jaws to latch onto the opponents body and automatically

deals bite damage each round. She loses her Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class and has an AC of 12. While attached, Shensa can

be struck with a weapon or grappled herself (by achieving a pin

against her).

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): Shensa can deliver touch spells for

Rimmen (see Familiars, page 52 of the Players Handbook).

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Shensa is exposed to any effect

that normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw

and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Speak with Master (Ex): Shensa can communicate verbally

with Rimmen. Other creatures do not understand the communica-

tion without magical help.

Speak with Weasels (Ex): Shensa can speak with weasels,

minks,  polecats,  ermines,  skunks,  wolverines,  badgers,  dire

weasels, and other creatures of the family Mustelidae. Such

communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing

creatures.

Skills: Shensa has a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks

and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Hide checks. She uses her

Dexterity modier instead of her Strength modier for Climb

checks. She can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even

if rushed or threatened.

BECOMING AN OLIN GISIR

The Olin Gisiae have an informal organization. As inveterate

collectors  of  useful  information,  theyre  quick  to  notice  elves

and half-elves who might qualify for the class and just as quick

to welcome newcomers into their ranks.

Olin Gisiae are recruited exclusively from the ranks of wiz-

ards and other arcane casters. The ideal candidate

possesses  a  keen  mind  and  an  irresistible

curiosity that sends her hunting for an-

cient mysteries on her own. Usually,

a  seasoned  secret-keeper  watches

prospective  recruits  for  some

time to determine their mo-

tives and desires. Those who

seem to be seeking power or

personal glory are ignored, or

sometimes even killed if their

searches  threaten  to  reveal

dangerous secrets to the world.

Those who respect the secrets

they discover are contacted

and offered training.

The quickest and easiest path

to Olin Gisir is via the wizard

class.  A  wizard  gains  access  to

new  spell  levels  faster  than  a

bard or sorcerer does, and her

bonus feats allow her to pick

up  a  second  metamagic  feat

at an earlier level than other

spellcasters.  Sorcerers  take  up

this path on occasion, though

they  must  purchase  some

cross-class  skills  to  meet  the

requirements. While bards have

easy access to the required skills,

their  slower  spell  progression

means  that  they  cannot  take

this class before 13th level.

Intelligence is a key ability, since an Olin Gisir relies heavily

upon spellcasting and ancient knowledge. Charisma is also a key

ability for sorcerers who choose to follow this path.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Race: Elf or half-elf.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Knowledge

(arcana) 10 ranks, Knowledge (history)

10 ranks.

Feats:  Iron  Will  and  any  two

metamagic feats.

Spells: Ability to cast 3rd-level

arcane spells.

Sp ecial: Abjuration must not be

a prohibited school for you.

CLASS FEATURES

Olin Gisiae focus on knowledge,

both  arcane  and  mundane.

Though they are not front-line

combatants, their ability to read

signs and banish single threats

enable them to protect the se-

crets of the ancients with great

ef ciency. All the following are

class features of the Olin Gisir

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro -

ciency: You gain no new pro ciency

with weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting:  At  each  Olin

Gisir level, you gain new spells per

day, and an increase in caster level

(and spells known, if applicable) as

if you had also gained a level in an

arcane spellcasting class that granted

you access to 3rd-level spells before you

Meraera of the Olin Gisiae

22

added the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you have

access to 3rd-level spells from more than one arcane spellcasting

class when you gain a level as an Olin Gisir, you must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells

per day, caster level, and spells known.

Ancient  Knowledge  (Ex):  You  have  studied  ancient  lore  in

considerable depth. You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge (arcana),

Knowledge (history), and Use Magic Device checks. You also gain

the same bonus on bardic knowledge checks if you possess that

class feature. The bonus increases to +2 at 4th level, to +3 at 7th

level, and to +4 at 10th level.

Secret (Ex): You have picked up countless bits of forgotten

lore from ancient tomes you have uncovered, the whispers of

imprisoned  ends you have been set to guard, and other even

more dangerous sources. Add your Intelligence modi er to your

Olin Gisir level. You can choose any one secret for which that

result equals or exceeds the number in the left column of Table

17. You can choose another secret in the same manner at 4th,

7th, and 10th level, though you may not select the same secret

more than once.

Signs and Portents (Sp): At 2nd level, you learn to ferret out

ancient, hidden evils by reading mystic omens in the world around

you. Three times per day, you can use augury, as the spell (caster

level equals your character level).

Word of Dispel (Sp): At 5th level, you gain additional power

against the old perils you seek to destroy or subdue. You can

add dispel chaos, dispel evil, or dispel law (your choice) to the

5th-level arcane spells that you can cast. If you cast spells as

a wizard, you simply add the spell to your spellbook. If you

cast spells as a sorcerer, you acquire it as a bonus spell known

at that level. The spell you have chosen is now an arcane spell

for you.

against your enemies. You can add dictum, holy word, or word

of chaos (your choice) to the 7th-level arcane spells that you can

cast. If you cast spells as a wizard, you simply add the spell to

your spellbook. If you cast spells as a sorcerer, you acquire it as

a bonus spell known at that level. The spell you have chosen is

now an arcane spell for you.

PLAYING AN OLIN GISIR

You are silent and somber most of the timeafter all, the tasks

youre  charged  with  arent  trivialities.  You  tend  to  keep  silent

about what you know, as much for the sake of your companions

sanity as for the preservation of secrets. If your knowledge can

help your companions, though, you freely offer as much as they

need, provided that doing so does not compromise a secret. You

keep a detailed journal of odd portents and omens that you see

while traveling, so that you can return later and investigate.

Your initiation into the ranks of the Olin Gisiae was almost a

seamless transition. After you had spent years seeking knowledge

for its own sake, you were approached by an Olin Gisir, who offered

you membership in an association dedicated to seeking knowledge

and using it to protect and serve the elf race. Though you have

no particular obligation to other members, you are always willing

to share information with them, assist them with missions, and

offer them hospitality as needed.

Combat: You are a scholar and watcher, not a  ghter, so you

prefer to rely on allies or mystically summoned creatures to deal

with intruders who are attempting to delve into the secrets you

guard. Many of your fellow Olin Gisiae who do not travel learn

the  art  of  creating  golems,  shield  guardians,  and  other  loyal

constructs that can serve as warriors while their masters stand

back and rain down magical destruction on their foes.

Your knowledge of history and magic allows you to identify

ruins,  read  inscriptions  on  ancient  tombs,  and  activate  even

the most outlandish magical artifacts. Remain aware of your

surroundingsyou may be able to avoid perils, elude foes, or

summon  aid  by  making  good  use  of  the  secrets  you   nd  in

ancient places.

Divination spells help you stay alert and prepared for any

danger that might be heading your way. Spells such as see invis-

ibility, detect thoughts, arcane sight, and true seeing help monitor

your immediate surroundings, and clairaudience/clairvoyance,

arcane eye, scrying, and prying eyes help you look farther a eld.

You  can  never  have  too  many  allies,  so  dont  overlook  the

various summon monster spells, and make sure you take spells

that can boost your allies abilities. Haste gives a big boost to

your allies in combat, as do heroism and rage. Glitterdust is also

advantageous for making invisible foes visible to those who  ght

on your side.

Advancement: As an apprentice secret-keeper, you learn the

lore of long-forgotten places of power and how to harden your

mind against ensorcelment by powerful demons and undead lords.

In addition, you learn the abjuration spells needed to keep such

beings bound and sleeping.

As you gain levels in the Olin Gisir class, you should learn

as many abjuration spells as possible. Spells such as magic circle

and dismissal are invaluable for keeping creatures of darkness

BECOMING AN OLIN GISIR

The Olin Gisiae have an informal organization. As inveterate

collectors  of  useful  information,  theyre  quick  to  notice  elves

and half-elves who might qualify for the class and just as quick

to welcome newcomers into their ranks.

Olin Gisiae are recruited exclusively from the ranks of wiz-

ards and other arcane casters. The ideal candidate

possesses  a  keen  mind  and  an  irresistible

curiosity that sends her hunting for an-

cient mysteries on her own. Usually,

a  seasoned  secret-keeper  watches

prospective  recruits  for  some

time to determine their mo-

tives and desires. Those who

seem to be seeking power or

personal glory are ignored, or

sometimes even killed if their

searches  threaten  to  reveal

dangerous secrets to the world.

Those who respect the secrets

they discover are contacted

and offered training.

The quickest and easiest path

to Olin Gisir is via the wizard

class.  A  wizard  gains  access  to

new  spell  levels  faster  than  a

bard or sorcerer does, and her

bonus feats allow her to pick

up  a  second  metamagic  feat

at an earlier level than other

spellcasters.  Sorcerers  take  up

this path on occasion, though

they  must  purchase  some

cross-class  skills  to  meet  the

requirements. While bards have

easy access to the required skills,

their  slower  spell  progression

means  that  they  cannot  take

this class before 13th level.

Intelligence is a key ability, since an Olin Gisir relies heavily

upon spellcasting and ancient knowledge. Charisma is also a key

ability for sorcerers who choose to follow this path.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Race: Elf or half-elf.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Knowledge

(arcana) 10 ranks, Knowledge (history)

10 ranks.

Feats:  Iron  Will  and  any  two

metamagic feats.

Spells: Ability to cast 3rd-level

arcane spells.

Sp ecial: Abjuration must not be

a prohibited school for you.

CLASS FEATURES

Olin Gisiae focus on knowledge,

both  arcane  and  mundane.

Though they are not front-line

combatants, their ability to read

signs and banish single threats

enable them to protect the se-

crets of the ancients with great

ef ciency. All the following are

class features of the Olin Gisir

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro -

ciency: You gain no new pro ciency

with weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting:  At  each  Olin

Gisir level, you gain new spells per

day, and an increase in caster level

(and spells known, if applicable) as

if you had also gained a level in an

arcane spellcasting class that granted

you access to 3rd-level spells before you

Meraera of the Olin Gisiae

22

added the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you have

access to 3rd-level spells from more than one arcane spellcasting

class when you gain a level as an Olin Gisir, you must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells

per day, caster level, and spells known.

Ancient  Knowledge  (Ex):  You  have  studied  ancient  lore  in

considerable depth. You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge (arcana),

Knowledge (history), and Use Magic Device checks. You also gain

the same bonus on bardic knowledge checks if you possess that

class feature. The bonus increases to +2 at 4th level, to +3 at 7th

level, and to +4 at 10th level.

Secret (Ex): You have picked up countless bits of forgotten

lore from ancient tomes you have uncovered, the whispers of

imprisoned  ends you have been set to guard, and other even

more dangerous sources. Add your Intelligence modi er to your

Olin Gisir level. You can choose any one secret for which that

result equals or exceeds the number in the left column of Table

17. You can choose another secret in the same manner at 4th,

7th, and 10th level, though you may not select the same secret

more than once.

Signs and Portents (Sp): At 2nd level, you learn to ferret out

ancient, hidden evils by reading mystic omens in the world around

you. Three times per day, you can use augury, as the spell (caster

level equals your character level).

Word of Dispel (Sp): At 5th level, you gain additional power

against the old perils you seek to destroy or subdue. You can

add dispel chaos, dispel evil, or dispel law (your choice) to the

5th-level arcane spells that you can cast. If you cast spells as

a wizard, you simply add the spell to your spellbook. If you

cast spells as a sorcerer, you acquire it as a bonus spell known

at that level. The spell you have chosen is now an arcane spell

for you.

against your enemies. You can add dictum, holy word, or word

of chaos (your choice) to the 7th-level arcane spells that you can

cast. If you cast spells as a wizard, you simply add the spell to

your spellbook. If you cast spells as a sorcerer, you acquire it as

a bonus spell known at that level. The spell you have chosen is

now an arcane spell for you.

PLAYING AN OLIN GISIR

You are silent and somber most of the timeafter all, the tasks

youre  charged  with  arent  trivialities.  You  tend  to  keep  silent

about what you know, as much for the sake of your companions

sanity as for the preservation of secrets. If your knowledge can

help your companions, though, you freely offer as much as they

need, provided that doing so does not compromise a secret. You

keep a detailed journal of odd portents and omens that you see

while traveling, so that you can return later and investigate.

Your initiation into the ranks of the Olin Gisiae was almost a

seamless transition. After you had spent years seeking knowledge

for its own sake, you were approached by an Olin Gisir, who offered

you membership in an association dedicated to seeking knowledge

and using it to protect and serve the elf race. Though you have

no particular obligation to other members, you are always willing

to share information with them, assist them with missions, and

offer them hospitality as needed.

Combat: You are a scholar and watcher, not a  ghter, so you

prefer to rely on allies or mystically summoned creatures to deal

with intruders who are attempting to delve into the secrets you

guard. Many of your fellow Olin Gisiae who do not travel learn

the  art  of  creating  golems,  shield  guardians,  and  other  loyal

constructs that can serve as warriors while their masters stand

back and rain down magical destruction on their foes.

Your knowledge of history and magic allows you to identify

ruins,  read  inscriptions  on  ancient  tombs,  and  activate  even

the most outlandish magical artifacts. Remain aware of your

surroundingsyou may be able to avoid perils, elude foes, or

summon  aid  by  making  good  use  of  the  secrets  you   nd  in

ancient places.

Divination spells help you stay alert and prepared for any

danger that might be heading your way. Spells such as see invis-

ibility, detect thoughts, arcane sight, and true seeing help monitor

your immediate surroundings, and clairaudience/clairvoyance,

arcane eye, scrying, and prying eyes help you look farther a eld.

You  can  never  have  too  many  allies,  so  dont  overlook  the

various summon monster spells, and make sure you take spells

that can boost your allies abilities. Haste gives a big boost to

your allies in combat, as do heroism and rage. Glitterdust is also

advantageous for making invisible foes visible to those who  ght

on your side.

Advancement: As an apprentice secret-keeper, you learn the

lore of long-forgotten places of power and how to harden your

mind against ensorcelment by powerful demons and undead lords.

In addition, you learn the abjuration spells needed to keep such

beings bound and sleeping.

As you gain levels in the Olin Gisir class, you should learn

as many abjuration spells as possible. Spells such as magic circle

and dismissal are invaluable for keeping creatures of darkness

23

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

at bay, and other abjurations can help keep you alive if you are

forced into combat.

Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration, Spell Focus, and

Greater Spell Focus are excellent feat choices, since the creatures

you are likely to guard tend to have spell resistance and high

saving throw bonuses. Metamagic and item creation feats are

also useful, since they can give your spells some extra punch in

emergencies.

Resources: As an Olin Gisir, you are part of a respected fel-

lowship of magical guardians and watchers scattered throughout

elf towns and cities. You can expect a warm welcome in any elf

realm, and if you discover that you need immediate and signicant

help to avert a major catastrophe (such as the escape of a demon

or the rising of a lich lord), your fellow elves will do everything

in their power to assist you. Such assistance might come in the

form of skilled warriors to guard you, potions or scrolls to provide

you with magical aid, or even the loan of powerful magic items

for your confrontation with the forces of evil.

Outside elf settlements, the Olin Gisiae are not widely known.

However, a small number of human sages and scholars are aware

of your order and inclined to aid you if so requested.

OLIN GISIAE IN FAERN

Olin Gisiae can ll many roles in your campaign. They make

excellent NPC advisors, since they can provide information about

dungeons the PCs might explore or artifacts they might retrieve.

They can also function as reinforcements for a group on a difcult

mission or even as adversaries, should the party be unfortunate

enough to wander into a protected area. Few secret-keepers sub-

scribe to a philosophy of Strike rst and ask questions later,

but even reasonable Olin Gisiae can be drawn into conict with

PCs intent on meddling in the secrets they guard.

Olin Gisiae are loosely organized, usually coming together

only if a truly terrible secret they have been protecting seems

about to emerge. The typical secret-keeper chooses to guard a

single site or a group of nearby sites, such as a demons prison or

a tomb complex that serves as a lair for several powerful undead

creatures.  A  few,  however,  prefer  to  travel  with  adventuring

groups, seeking out places that even their fellows have forgotten.

These roving secret-keepers usually arrange some means, either

magical or mundane, to regularly report their ndings back to

a fellow Olin Gisir, who can quickly send a team to investigate

should the missives suddenly cease.

Now and then, an old and very powerful Olin Gisir chooses

to sacrice her mortal life and undergo the transformation into

a baelnornMona powerful, good-aligned elf lich who eternally

guards a site important to her people. Such fearsome guardians

usually choose to stand vigil over the most dangerous of sites,

such as the ruins of Myth Drannor.

NPC REACTIONS

Most elves understand the mission of the Olin Gisiae and sup-

port it wholeheartedly. Thus, an Olin Gisir can expect a friendly

or  helpful  welcome  in  almost  any  elven  community.  Among

non-elves who know about the Olin Gisiaes mission and duties,

good-hearted folk are usually friendly, but those who see the secret-

keeper as an obstacle for some reason are usually unfriendly or

hostile. Characters who are unaware of a secret-keepers appointed

task are usually indifferent.

Olin Gisiae get along well with loremasters but nd the ambi-

tious magelords reckless and arrogant.

OLIN GISIR LORE

Characters with Knowledge (history) or Knowledge (geography)

can research the Olin Gisiae to learn more about them. When a

character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following

material, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Olin Gisiae are elf spellcasters who guard danger-

ous sites on behalf of their secret fellowship.

DC 15: An Olin Gisirs protectorate is considered sacrosanct.

Anyone entering one risks the secret-keepers wrath.

DC 20: Secret-keepers know powerful magic for binding and

banishing demonic beings.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can learn

specic, detailed information about important Olin Gisiae in your

campaign.

OLIN GISIAE IN THE GAME

Because Olin Gisiae operate in relative isolation and seclusion,

adding  one  to  your  game  is  simple.  Its  entirely  possible  that

characters with levels in this prestige class have always existed

in the campaign world, but the PCs simply havent come across

one before.

This  prestige  class  appeals  to  PCs  who  like  to  know  what

mortals were not meant to know. If one of your PCs takes levels

in the Olin Gisir class, be sure to give her an opportunity to use

that knowledge from time to time, whether by allowing her to

uncover some extra information about an adventure site, or by

creating a full-blown adventure focused around slumbering horrors

and ancient mysteries.

ADAPTATION

Some Olin Gisiae range far beyond elf lands. If your campaign

is set in an area far from the Elven Court and Evereska, its a

good bet that any Olin Gisiae operating in the area are seeking

out lost lore or trying to track down a foe from ancient times.

In addition, one or two Olin Gisiae usually live with any sizable

enclave of elves.

ENCOUNTERS

PCs may encounter an Olin Gisir in the wilds, living in a small

hut near the site of some ancient evil. Secret-keepers might also

be encountered in inns or adventurers guilds, seeking to recruit

adventurers as extra muscle to help secure some forgotten ruin.

EL  11:  Meraera  has  spent  many  years  studying  ancient

lore  in  and  around  Silverymoon.  Upon  hearing  of  a  recently

discovered tower in the ruins of Siluvanede, she hastened to the

nearest adventurers guild in search of aid for an expedition to

the ruins.

Sunmaster

The Netherese of old knew Amaunator, the great sun lord, whose

light and order lled the world for an age. We know him now

as Lathander. For centuries we have thought of Lathander as

a god of morning, but his glory now ascends toward its noontide

height. Just as the sun brightens while it climbs into the sky, so

will Lathanders glory and radiance grow as he resumes the glory

and mastery that were his of old. All who worship him will see

an end to this long night in which we live.

Andar, Sunmaster

The  sunmasters  are  members  of  a  sect  within  the  church  of

Lathander who believe that the Morninglord is the living rein-

carnation of Amaunator, the long-vanished sun god who stood

high in the ancient Netherese pantheon. Sunmasters revere this

at bay, and other abjurations can help keep you alive if you are

forced into combat.

Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration, Spell Focus, and

Greater Spell Focus are excellent feat choices, since the creatures

you are likely to guard tend to have spell resistance and high

saving throw bonuses. Metamagic and item creation feats are

also useful, since they can give your spells some extra punch in

emergencies.

Resources: As an Olin Gisir, you are part of a respected fel-

lowship of magical guardians and watchers scattered throughout

elf towns and cities. You can expect a warm welcome in any elf

realm, and if you discover that you need immediate and signicant

help to avert a major catastrophe (such as the escape of a demon

or the rising of a lich lord), your fellow elves will do everything

in their power to assist you. Such assistance might come in the

form of skilled warriors to guard you, potions or scrolls to provide

you with magical aid, or even the loan of powerful magic items

for your confrontation with the forces of evil.

Outside elf settlements, the Olin Gisiae are not widely known.

However, a small number of human sages and scholars are aware

of your order and inclined to aid you if so requested.

OLIN GISIAE IN FAERN

Olin Gisiae can ll many roles in your campaign. They make

excellent NPC advisors, since they can provide information about

dungeons the PCs might explore or artifacts they might retrieve.

They can also function as reinforcements for a group on a difcult

mission or even as adversaries, should the party be unfortunate

enough to wander into a protected area. Few secret-keepers sub-

scribe to a philosophy of Strike rst and ask questions later,

but even reasonable Olin Gisiae can be drawn into conict with

PCs intent on meddling in the secrets they guard.

Olin Gisiae are loosely organized, usually coming together

only if a truly terrible secret they have been protecting seems

about to emerge. The typical secret-keeper chooses to guard a

single site or a group of nearby sites, such as a demons prison or

a tomb complex that serves as a lair for several powerful undead

creatures.  A  few,  however,  prefer  to  travel  with  adventuring

groups, seeking out places that even their fellows have forgotten.

These roving secret-keepers usually arrange some means, either

magical or mundane, to regularly report their ndings back to

a fellow Olin Gisir, who can quickly send a team to investigate

should the missives suddenly cease.

Now and then, an old and very powerful Olin Gisir chooses

to sacrice her mortal life and undergo the transformation into

a baelnornMona powerful, good-aligned elf lich who eternally

guards a site important to her people. Such fearsome guardians

usually choose to stand vigil over the most dangerous of sites,

such as the ruins of Myth Drannor.

NPC REACTIONS

Most elves understand the mission of the Olin Gisiae and sup-

port it wholeheartedly. Thus, an Olin Gisir can expect a friendly

or  helpful  welcome  in  almost  any  elven  community.  Among

non-elves who know about the Olin Gisiaes mission and duties,

good-hearted folk are usually friendly, but those who see the secret-

keeper as an obstacle for some reason are usually unfriendly or

hostile. Characters who are unaware of a secret-keepers appointed

task are usually indifferent.

Olin Gisiae get along well with loremasters but nd the ambi-

tious magelords reckless and arrogant.

OLIN GISIR LORE

Characters with Knowledge (history) or Knowledge (geography)

can research the Olin Gisiae to learn more about them. When a

character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following

material, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Olin Gisiae are elf spellcasters who guard danger-

ous sites on behalf of their secret fellowship.

DC 15: An Olin Gisirs protectorate is considered sacrosanct.

Anyone entering one risks the secret-keepers wrath.

DC 20: Secret-keepers know powerful magic for binding and

banishing demonic beings.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can learn

specic, detailed information about important Olin Gisiae in your

campaign.

OLIN GISIAE IN THE GAME

Because Olin Gisiae operate in relative isolation and seclusion,

adding  one  to  your  game  is  simple.  Its  entirely  possible  that

characters with levels in this prestige class have always existed

in the campaign world, but the PCs simply havent come across

one before.

This  prestige  class  appeals  to  PCs  who  like  to  know  what

mortals were not meant to know. If one of your PCs takes levels

in the Olin Gisir class, be sure to give her an opportunity to use

that knowledge from time to time, whether by allowing her to

uncover some extra information about an adventure site, or by

creating a full-blown adventure focused around slumbering horrors

and ancient mysteries.

ADAPTATION

Some Olin Gisiae range far beyond elf lands. If your campaign

is set in an area far from the Elven Court and Evereska, its a

good bet that any Olin Gisiae operating in the area are seeking

out lost lore or trying to track down a foe from ancient times.

In addition, one or two Olin Gisiae usually live with any sizable

enclave of elves.

ENCOUNTERS

PCs may encounter an Olin Gisir in the wilds, living in a small

hut near the site of some ancient evil. Secret-keepers might also

be encountered in inns or adventurers guilds, seeking to recruit

adventurers as extra muscle to help secure some forgotten ruin.

lore  in  and  around  Silverymoon.  Upon  hearing  of  a  recently

Sunmaster

The Netherese of old knew Amaunator, the great sun lord, whose

light and order lled the world for an age. We know him now

as Lathander. For centuries we have thought of Lathander as

a god of morning, but his glory now ascends toward its noontide

height. Just as the sun brightens while it climbs into the sky, so

will Lathanders glory and radiance grow as he resumes the glory

and mastery that were his of old. All who worship him will see

an end to this long night in which we live.

Andar, Sunmaster

The  sunmasters  are  members  of  a  sect  within  the  church  of

Lathander who believe that the Morninglord is the living rein-

carnation of Amaunator, the long-vanished sun god who stood

high in the ancient Netherese pantheon. Sunmasters revere this

ancient vision of Lathander as a deity of glory, light, and perfect

ordera regal god who might one day lay claim to lordship over

the Faernian pantheon. Through their deeds and faith, they hope

to demonstrate that Lathanders ascent is nearly complete, and

that Amaunators long noontime reign is soon to begin.

Although the sunmasters have served Lathander loyally and

well for fteen centuries now, their doctrinal differences with the

rest of the Morninglords clergy have caused discord and created

schisms  on  more  than  one  occasion.  Most  Lathanderites  see

ANCIENT SECRETS

ANCIENT SECRETS

the cause. As you gain more status, junior members may begin

coming to you for advice, and elder members may ask you to

undertake special missions.

Combat:  Your  spells  and  abilities  can  banish  darkness  and

restore order to chaos. You possess more offensive spell ability

than most clerics because you can prepare spells from the Sun

and Law domains as cleric spells. Your preferred mode of combat

is to attack with spells such as searing light and orders wrath,

smiting your foes with the pure power of the sun.

To  use  searing  light  most  effectively,  consider  taking  feats

such as Precise Shot and Weapon Focus (ray). The former allows

you to use searing light more readily against foes in melee

combat  with  your  allies,  and  the  latter  improves

your chance to hit. If you take care to choose

lawful allies, you can aim orders wrath nearly

anywhere  you  wish  without  hurting  your

friends,  because  the  spell  doesnt  harm

lawful creatures.

When  you  reach  the  pinnacle  of

your  power  as  a  sunmaster,  you  receive

the  sunform  ability,  which  makes  you  a

formidable melee opponent against any foe

that is susceptible to  re damage. However,

your ability to cast spells is severely curtailed

while youre using sunform unless you have

the  Still  Spell,  Silent  Spell,  and  Eschew

Materials feats.

Advancement: Your recruitment into

the  sunmasters  sect  was  like  a  burst

of  brilliant  sunlight.  As  you

listened to the words of another

sunmaster,  the  truth  became

dazzlingly  clear.  You  joyfully

undertook a quest to  nd a true

holy symbol of Amaunator and

were welcomed with open arms by

your  fellow  sunmasters  once  you  had

succeeded.

As  you  attain  higher  levels  in  the  prestige  class,  you  take

on  responsibility  for  advancing  those  aspects  of  Lathanders

worship that most directly re ect the glory of Amaunator. In

particular, you must begin recruiting new followers and clerics

for your order, lest Amaunators worship die out again. The old

temples of Amaunator were called courts, and each was headed

by a high priest who held the title of Righteous Potentate. When

you rule over your own army of the faithful, you can make that

title your own.

Your abilities closely match those of most typical clerics,

so any tool that would serve a cleric well should also aid you.

Feats such as Spell Penetration and Spell Focus can help

you  become  a  more  effective  spellcaster  in  combat,

and feats such as Craft Wondrous Item and Craft

Magic Arms and Armor allow you to create

powerful tools for use in your crusade against

the foes of order.

Resources:  The  Church  of  Lathander  is

widespread  and  powerful,  and  its  members

generally support your efforts. While many

Lathanderites  are  uncomfortable  with  your

heretical  beliefs,  they  recognize  that  the

sectarian  differences  within  the  faith  are

relatively minor compared with the need to

curtail the abominable acts of Faerns many

evil  gods  and  their  clergy.  Unless  you

make a point of browbeating all the

Lathanderites you meet about the

inaccuracy of their beliefs, you

can expect food, lodging, and

shelter in almost any shrine or

temple of Lathander.

Your  fellow  sunmasters  are  even

more inclined to offer you help when

needed than is the mainstream Church of

Lathander. Other sunmasters are often will-

ing to assist you in short missions, loan you

useful magic items, or heal you when you

cannot  heal  yourself,  and  they  expect  the

their deity as a good powera god of renewal, hope, and rebirth.

Sunmasters view Lathander (or Amaunator, as they often call

him) as a deity that brings order to the world, just as the sun

provides the regularity of day and night, season after season, year

after year.

BECOMING A SUNMASTER

Clerics, especially former Lathanderites, are best suited to take

on the role of sunmaster. The most dif cult and important step

in entering this prestige class is turning aside from the accepted

tenets of Lathanders faith by choosing the Servant of the Fallen

feat, then devoting prayers and faith to Amaunator as an aspect

of Lathander.

A small number of nonclerics who oppose darkness, chaos, and

disorder (usually paladins and wizard/clerics) become sunmasters

because they believe that Lathander will reward their faith with

triumph over their shadowy adversaries.

As with clerics, sunmasters bene t from high scores in Wisdom

and Charisma.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Alignment: Any lawful.

Skills:  Knowledge  (history)  8  ranks,  Knowledge  (geography)

4  ranks,  Knowledge  (religion)  4  ranks,  Speak  Language

(Loross).

Feats: Servant of the Fallen (Amaunator) (see page 9).

Spells: Ability to cast 2nd-level divine spells.

Domains: Law, Sun.

Patron Deity: Amaunator.

Special:  You  must  own  a  holy  symbol  of  Amaunator,  either

personally recovered from a ruined temple of that deity or

given to you by an existing sunmaster.

CLASS FEATURES

Since sunmasters wield the unbridled power of the noonday sun,

their abilities center around the properties of heat and light. The

following are class features of the sunmaster prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: You gain no new pro ciency

with weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: At each sunmaster level, you gain new spells per

day, and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable)

as if you had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to

which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You

do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that class

would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting

class before becoming a sunmaster, you must decide to which class

to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,

caster level, and spells known.

Sun Spells: You can prepare any Sun domain spell as if it were

on your divine spell list. The spell uses a spell slot of a level equal

to its level in the Sun domain list.

Glaring Eyes (Sp): Starting at 2nd level, your eyes glow with

the brilliant orange color of the sun. You can produce a searing

light effect from your eyes once per day (caster level equals your

character level). Additionally, you can never be blinded or dazed

by spells or effects with the light descriptor, or by natural light

of any kind. You can use searing light twice per day at 5th level

and three times per day at 8th level.

Resistance to Fire (Ex): Your link to the sun gives you increas-

ing resistance to its  re. At 3rd level, you gain resistance to  re

5. Your  re resistance increases to 10 at 6th level and to 15 at

9th level.

Law Spells: Beginning at 4th level, you can prepare any Law

domain spell as if it were on your divine spell list. The spell uses

a spell slot of a level equal to its level in the Law domain list.

Planning Domain: At 7th level, you gain access to the Plan-

ning Domain and acquire its granted ability (see Players Guide

to Faern). On any given day, you can choose spells from the

Planning Domain or from one of the domains you chose as a

1st-level cleric to  ll your domain spell slots. You do not gain

additional domain spells each day, only a broader choice of domain

spells at each spell level.

Sunform (Sp): Upon reaching 10th level, you gain the ability

to become an insubstantial ball of bright, glowing light the size of

a Medium creature. This effect is identical to that of the gaseous

form spell, except as follows. In sunform, you radiate daylight as

the spell, gain a  y speed of 120 feet (perfect), and have immunity

to  re, light, and air effects. In addition, you gain a melee touch

attack that deals 6d6 points of  re damage. You can remain in

sunform for up to 10 rounds. Sunform is the equivalent of an

8th-level spell and is usable once per day.

PLAYING A SUNMASTER

Like  the  morninglords  of  Lathander,  you  represent  an  elite

sect  of  clerics  and  holy  warriors.  Your  task  is  to  demonstrate

the superiority of Lathanders faith through your own actions,

thereby hastening the day when he completes his millennia-long

ascension and once again shines forth as the supreme lord over

Faerns squabbling and fractious pantheon. Many of your fellow

Lathanderites  shrink  from  the  grandeur  of  your  vision  for

Amaunators emergence  from Lathanders  faith,  arguing that

no one deity can know what is right for all creatures under the

sunbut you know they are wrong. Only your bold action and

glorious  triumphs  in  the  never-ending  war  against  chaos  and

darkness will illuminate the truth of your belief for all to see.

The sun will rise tomorrow, as it does every day. This glowing

orb is the absolute representation of your faith, and its supreme

dependability is your guide. Be lawful. Know what is right, and

support the right path in all your doings. Rid the world of dark-

ness  with  the  suns  perfect   re.  You  can  expect  trouble  from

rival sects within Lathanders faith and also from followers of

Horus-Re, who mistakenly believe that their deity is Faerns

only sun god.

As  a  sunmaster,  you  are  still  part  of  Lathanders  church,

and as such, you are loyal to both its precepts and its of cials.

As a new member, you can expect to receive plenty of advice on

proper deportment and actions. Later on, you gain respect and

admiration  from  your  fellow  sunmasters  simply  by  virtue  of

your increasing power, which clearly demonstrates your deepen-

ing relationship with the sun. Since the hierarchy within your

sect is based largely on merit, however, you can gain even more

status by actively promoting its interests, achieving victories in

the ongoing battle against chaos, and recruiting new members to

Glaring Eyes (Sp): Starting at 2nd level, your eyes glow with

the brilliant orange color of the sun. You can produce a searing

light effect from your eyes once per day (caster level equals your

character level). Additionally, you can never be blinded or dazed

by spells or effects with the light descriptor, or by natural light

of any kind. You can use searing light twice per day at 5th level

and three times per day at 8th level.

Resistance to Fire (Ex): Your link to the sun gives you increas-

ing resistance to its  re. At 3rd level, you gain resistance to  re

5. Your  re resistance increases to 10 at 6th level and to 15 at

9th level.

Law Spells: Beginning at 4th level, you can prepare any Law

domain spell as if it were on your divine spell list. The spell uses

a spell slot of a level equal to its level in the Law domain list.

Planning Domain: At 7th level, you gain access to the Plan-

ning Domain and acquire its granted ability (see Players Guide

to Faern). On any given day, you can choose spells from the

Planning Domain or from one of the domains you chose as a

1st-level cleric to  ll your domain spell slots. You do not gain

additional domain spells each day, only a broader choice of domain

spells at each spell level.

Sunform (Sp): Upon reaching 10th level, you gain the ability

to become an insubstantial ball of bright, glowing light the size of

a Medium creature. This effect is identical to that of the gaseous

form spell, except as follows. In sunform, you radiate daylight as

the spell, gain a  y speed of 120 feet (perfect), and have immunity

to  re, light, and air effects. In addition, you gain a melee touch

attack that deals 6d6 points of  re damage. You can remain in

sunform for up to 10 rounds. Sunform is the equivalent of an

8th-level spell and is usable once per day.

PLAYING A SUNMASTER

Like  the  morninglords  of  Lathander,  you  represent  an  elite

sect  of  clerics  and  holy  warriors.  Your  task  is  to  demonstrate

the superiority of Lathanders faith through your own actions,

thereby hastening the day when he completes his millennia-long

ascension and once again shines forth as the supreme lord over

Faerns squabbling and fractious pantheon. Many of your fellow

Lathanderites  shrink  from  the  grandeur  of  your  vision  for

Amaunators emergence  from Lathanders  faith,  arguing that

no one deity can know what is right for all creatures under the

sunbut you know they are wrong. Only your bold action and

glorious  triumphs  in  the  never-ending  war  against  chaos  and

darkness will illuminate the truth of your belief for all to see.

The sun will rise tomorrow, as it does every day. This glowing

orb is the absolute representation of your faith, and its supreme

dependability is your guide. Be lawful. Know what is right, and

support the right path in all your doings. Rid the world of dark-

ness  with  the  suns  perfect   re.  You  can  expect  trouble  from

rival sects within Lathanders faith and also from followers of

Horus-Re, who mistakenly believe that their deity is Faerns

only sun god.

As  a  sunmaster,  you  are  still  part  of  Lathanders  church,

and as such, you are loyal to both its precepts and its of cials.

As a new member, you can expect to receive plenty of advice on

proper deportment and actions. Later on, you gain respect and

admiration  from  your  fellow  sunmasters  simply  by  virtue  of

your increasing power, which clearly demonstrates your deepen-

ing relationship with the sun. Since the hierarchy within your

sect is based largely on merit, however, you can gain even more

status by actively promoting its interests, achieving victories in

the ongoing battle against chaos, and recruiting new members to

the cause. As you gain more status, junior members may begin

coming to you for advice, and elder members may ask you to

undertake special missions.

Combat:  Your  spells  and  abilities  can  banish  darkness  and

restore order to chaos. You possess more offensive spell ability

than most clerics because you can prepare spells from the Sun

and Law domains as cleric spells. Your preferred mode of combat

is to attack with spells such as searing light and orders wrath,

smiting your foes with the pure power of the sun.

To  use  searing  light  most  effectively,  consider  taking  feats

such as Precise Shot and Weapon Focus (ray). The former allows

you to use searing light more readily against foes in melee

combat  with  your  allies,  and  the  latter  improves

your chance to hit. If you take care to choose

lawful allies, you can aim orders wrath nearly

anywhere  you  wish  without  hurting  your

friends,  because  the  spell  doesnt  harm

lawful creatures.

When  you  reach  the  pinnacle  of

your  power  as  a  sunmaster,  you  receive

the  sunform  ability,  which  makes  you  a

formidable melee opponent against any foe

that is susceptible to  re damage. However,

your ability to cast spells is severely curtailed

while youre using sunform unless you have

the  Still  Spell,  Silent  Spell,  and  Eschew

Materials feats.

Advancement: Your recruitment into

the  sunmasters  sect  was  like  a  burst

of  brilliant  sunlight.  As  you

listened to the words of another

sunmaster,  the  truth  became

dazzlingly  clear.  You  joyfully

undertook a quest to  nd a true

holy symbol of Amaunator and

were welcomed with open arms by

your  fellow  sunmasters  once  you  had

succeeded.

As  you  attain  higher  levels  in  the  prestige  class,  you  take

on  responsibility  for  advancing  those  aspects  of  Lathanders

worship that most directly re ect the glory of Amaunator. In

particular, you must begin recruiting new followers and clerics

for your order, lest Amaunators worship die out again. The old

temples of Amaunator were called courts, and each was headed

by a high priest who held the title of Righteous Potentate. When

you rule over your own army of the faithful, you can make that

title your own.

Your abilities closely match those of most typical clerics,

so any tool that would serve a cleric well should also aid you.

Feats such as Spell Penetration and Spell Focus can help

you  become  a  more  effective  spellcaster  in  combat,

and feats such as Craft Wondrous Item and Craft

Magic Arms and Armor allow you to create

powerful tools for use in your crusade against

the foes of order.

Resources:  The  Church  of  Lathander  is

widespread  and  powerful,  and  its  members

generally support your efforts. While many

Lathanderites  are  uncomfortable  with  your

heretical  beliefs,  they  recognize  that  the

sectarian  differences  within  the  faith  are

relatively minor compared with the need to

curtail the abominable acts of Faerns many

evil  gods  and  their  clergy.  Unless  you

make a point of browbeating all the

Lathanderites you meet about the

inaccuracy of their beliefs, you

can expect food, lodging, and

shelter in almost any shrine or

temple of Lathander.

Your  fellow  sunmasters  are  even

more inclined to offer you help when

needed than is the mainstream Church of

Lathander. Other sunmasters are often will-

ing to assist you in short missions, loan you

useful magic items, or heal you when you

cannot  heal  yourself,  and  they  expect  the

Andar, a sunmaster

origins can be traced to the worship of ancient Amaunator.

important details about specic chapter houses or fellowships of

sunmasters in your campaign.

SUNMASTERS IN FAERN

No proof exists that Amaunator has returned from the dead

except  the  words  of  the  sunmasters.  Lathander  has  not  pro-

claimed himself the new incarnation of Amaunator, but neither

has he denied it. The god is keeping his own counsel on the matter

for now, although he has made it clear to both morninglords and

sunmasters that he considers all who follow him true believers,

thus heading off the worst of the sectarian inghting.

Organization: The sunmasters are more formally known as

the Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun, a recognized knightly and

cleric order within Lathanders faith. Chapter houses and shrines

dedicated  to  the  worship  of  Lathanders  sun  aspect  are  often

entrusted to the keeping of the brotherhood. Thus, a sunmaster

often reports to the ranking cleric of Lathander in the area,

as well as a superior brother of the Glorious Sun who might be

located in a different city.

A typical chapter house of the Glorious Sun is headed by a

handful of sunmasters who are attached to a large temple of

Lathander. A typical chapter consists of one to ve sunmasters,

plus two to ve clerics and acolytes who have accepted Amauna-

tor as their deity but have no levels in the prestige class yet,

and two to ten ghters, paladins, or warriors who adhere to the

sunmaster beliefs.

NPC REACTIONS

Most non-Lathanderites view the sunmasters as simply one more

faction within Lathanders church, hardly worth distinguishing

from  groups  such  as  the  morninglords  or  the  Order  of  the

Aster. Thus, a sunmaster can expect the same sort of reaction

that any cleric of Lathander would receive from a given group

or  individual.  Evil  characters  take  a  dim  view  of  sunmasters,

since  they  know  that  Lathanders  clerics  crusade  against  evil

wherever they nd it. Good folk are sometimes put off by the

zeal  of  the  sunmasters  but  generally  admire  the  good  works

they accomplish.

SUNMASTER LORE

Characters with Knowledge (religion) can research the sunmas-

ters to learn more about them. When a character makes a skill

check, read or paraphrase the following material, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The sunmasters are a particular sect or order within

the Church of Lathander.

DC 15: Sunmasters especially venerate Lathanders aspect

as a deity of the sun and crusade fervently against creatures of

evil and darkness. They wield powers of light and re.

DC 20: Sunmasters believe that Lathander is the incarna-

tion or continuation of Amaunator, the old god of the sun, who

was a powerful deity in the time of ancient Netheril. They also

believe  that  Lathanders  power  is  ascending,  and  that  he  will

soon  reincarnate  himself  as  Amaunator,  claiming  the  mantle

of lordship over the rest of the gods. Their views are considered

somewhat heretical by many other Lathanderites.

SUNMASTERS IN THE GAME

While  sunmasters  strongly  lean  toward  lawful  neutral  as  op-

posed to lawful good, they typically appear as allies rather than

adversaries or rivals to good-aligned adventurers.

This  prestige  class  appeals  to  players  who  like  to  play  of-

fensive-minded  clericsthat  is,  divine  spellcasters  who  use

their spells to attack rst and heal later. Because sunmasters are

determined, condent, and sometimes overzealous in confronting

evil, players who like to be out front and in charge should enjoy

playing them.

ADAPTATION

Sunmasters function openly wherever Lathander is venerated.

They are often covertly active in places where churches of evil

deities hold sway or in locales where Horus-Re worshipers wield

secular inuence. Their secret activities involve establishing and

protecting  groups  of  Lathander  worshipers,  confronting  and

eliminating rival clerics, and ghting the spread of chaos in any

way they can.

ENCOUNTERS

The PCs may encounter Andar the sunmaster in a large city,

where he has organized a torchbearer service that enables citizens

to move about at night without stumbling around in the dark.

Andars torchbearers are mostly orphans he has rescued from

the streets.

EL 8: Andar occasionally receives word of suspicious activi-

ties and clandestine meetings from his torchbearers. When such

reports  indicate  undead  activity  or  crimes  in  the  making,  he

sometimes seeks out adventurers to help him right the problem.

In combat, Andar tries to stay out of melee range long enough

to make the best use of his heat metal and searing light spells,

as well as his glaring eye ability.

Spell Descriptions

The spells in this section are presented in alphabetical order.

AURA OF THE SUN

Abjuration [Light]

Level: Cleric 4, paladin 4

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 10 ft.

Area: 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: No

Spell Resistance: None

By casting aura of the sun, you  ll the area around you with

warm, glowing light that eliminates natural shadows and hampers

magical darkness. Any creature attempting to cast a spell from the

shadow subschool or a spell with the darkness descriptor within

an aura of the sun must succeed on a caster level check (DC 11

+ your caster level), or the spell fails.

Areas of magical darkness originating from 3rd-level or lower

spells and effects are temporarily suppressed when overlapping

with an aura of the sun. Creatures that take penalties in bright

light also take them while within an aura of the sun, and an

undead creature takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage at

the end of its turn every round that it spends within the spells

area. Furthermore, any creature attempting to hide within the

aura takes a 4 penalty on Hide checks.

This effect is centered on you and moves with you. Anyone

who enters the aura immediately becomes subject to its effect,

but creatures that leave are no longer affected.

BACKBLAST

Abjuration [Fire]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Until expended or 10 minutes/level (D)

Though this spell was originally created by the phaerimms, it has

since been stolen by spellcasters of other races and can now be

found in grimoires across Faern. Backblast protects you in the

same manner as the spell turning spell, except that it turns only

spells with the  re descriptor that are targeted on you. Effect and

area spells are unaffected, as is any spell with a range of touch.

The DM secretly rolls 1d4+2 to determine the total number of

spell levels that can be turned. Backblast otherwise follows the

rules for the spell turning spell.

In addition to the above, backblast grants you  re resistance

10. This effect persists until the end of the round in which the

spell turning effect ends.

BLOODBRIARS

Evocation

Level: Druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Saving Throw: Re ex negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Target: 1 creature

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell, commonly used by the armathors of Myth Drannor

in the apprehension of criminals, snares the target in a tangle

of invisible, razor-sharp briars of mystical energy. The affected

creature suffers no ill effects as long as it does not attempt to

move, attack, cast a spell with material or somatic components,

or perform any other action that requires movement. During

any round in which the target moves in any fashion,

however, it takes 1d8 points of damage (no save).

Damage from the spell disrupts spellcasting;

a subject that attempts to cast a spell with

a material or somatic component must

make a Concentration check (DC 10

+ spell level + damage dealt) or lose

the spell.

Material Component: A drop

of blood.

Range: Touch

Target: Stone or stone object

touched, up to 1 cu. ft./level

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You cause a rock or section of stone to be-

come transparent. This spell affects naturally

occurring stone, ore, gemstones in the rough, and even worked

stone such as a statue or tunnel wall, but not worked metals, cut

gems,  or  fabricated  stone  materials  such  as  brick  or  concrete.

Visibility through the affected stone is perfectly clear and limited

only by the available light or by objects and creatures embedded

in the stone (such as a creature using meld into stone). Clearstone

grants line of sight, but not line of effect, through the affected

stone.  This  spell  does  not  change  a  stones  hardness  or  other

qualities in any way.

Clearstone can be made permanent using permanency (mini-

mum caster level 11th, 1,500 XP).

Arcane Material Component: A small,  at piece of glass.

CRUSHING SPHERE

This spell functions like Otilukes resilient sphere, except that the

sphere painfully constricts the target, hampering her movements

and breathing. The target is entangled and takes 3d6 points of

nonlethal damage per round as the sphere contracts. If the target

is rendered unconscious, any remaining damage from the crushing

sphere is lethal damage.

Material Component: An eggshell, which is crushed as the

spell is cast.

EBON RAY OF DOOM

partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  re a ray of black energy

that drastically slows down the

rate  at  which  the  subject  can

recover  hit  points.  Any  creature

attempting to restore hit points to the

subject by means of any sort of healing

magic must succeed on a caster level check

(DC 15 + your caster level), or the healing

effect fails. A subject with fast healing or a

regeneration  ability  must  make  a  Fortitude

save at the beginning of its turn each round. Failure indicates

that the ability does not function in that round.

GHOST PIPES

Transmutation

Level: Bard 1

Components: V, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around a creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

By means of this spell, you can cause one musical instrument

you touch to  oat a few feet above the ground and play itself.

The  instrument  must  be  intact  and  in  playable  condition  (no

missing strings, clogged mouthpieces, or other impediments to

proper use). The instrument plays any tune you desire as though

a skilled musician were playing it, regardless of whether you can

play the instrument in question. If used in conjunction with your

By means of this spell, you can cause one musical instrument

The  instrument  must  be  intact  and  in  playable  condition  (no

missing strings, clogged mouthpieces, or other impediments to

proper use). The instrument plays any tune you desire as though

a skilled musician were playing it, regardless of whether you can

Level: Cleric 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Mulhorandi priests have used this spell for millennia to select

humans of the purest Mulan bloodlines to follow the path of

the glorious servant.

When you cast this spell, you learn the basic ancestry of the

subject creature. The information revealed includes the subjects

type, race, subrace, and all subtypes the creature possesses.

You  turn  the  subject  into  a  half-fiend  by  imbuing  it  with

the essence of the infernal planes. The subject can have no

more  character  levels  than  you  do,  and  it  must  either  be

willing  to  undergo  the  transformation  or  be  restrained  in

some manner. Upon completion of the spell, the subject can

attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the half-fiend template

(see  page  147  of  the  Monster  Manual).  In  addition,  the

subjects type changes to outsider, and the moral component

of its alignment changes to evil. For the purpose of this spell,

treat the half-fiend template as an acquired template rather

than an inherited one.

The newly created half-end also gains a +4 level adjustment,

raising the XP required for it to achieve its next character level.

For example, a 5th-level sorcerer who becomes a half-end by

means of this spell becomes a 9th-level character who needs

45,000 XP to gain his sixth class level.

You cannot cast Nar endbond on yourself.

Arcane Material Component: Precious gems with a total value

equal to the XP cost of the spell.

XP  Cost:  500  XP  per  character  level  of  the  half-end

created.

bonus)  around  the  subject.  In  addition,  the  subject  becomes

immune to 2nd-level or lower spells with the force descriptor

and gains damage reduction 5/magic. Unlike mundane armor,

the force armor created by mailed might of the magelords has

no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance, and it

mandates no speed reduction. Furthermore, since the armor is

made of force, incorporeal creatures cant bypass it the way they

do normal armor.

Arcane Material Component: A miniature adamantine shield

You surround the subject with a brilliant violet glow that grants

Any weapon or natural attack normally used to deliver a poison

or  disease  (such  as  a  mummys  touch  or  a  snakes  bite)  still

deals the normal amount of hit point damage, but the poison

or disease is blocked. This spell does not reverse or prevent the

effects of poison and disease in a subject already affected by

one or both at the time of casting.

Each subject of Sakkratars triple strike can take two extra attacks

when making a full attack action, provided that it attacks with a

melee weapon it is holding. These extra attacks are made using the

subjects full base attack bonus, plus any modiers appropriate to

the situation. In addition, each affected creatures melee weapon

bursts into pure white ame, gaining the keen and aming burst

special abilities for the duration of the spell. This effect is not

cumulative with similar effects, such as a haste spell or a weapon

of speed, nor does it grant an extra action.

Once you summon a disk, a single spell of up to 5th level can be

cast into it, either by you or by another spellcaster. If no spell is

cast into the disk within 10 minutes of its creation, it vanishes

into nothingness and the spell is wasted.

The disk stores an imbued spell inde nitely until it is shattered

(a standard action requiring only 1 point of damage or a DC 5

Strength check). At that point, the spell immediately takes effect

as if it had just been cast by the spellcaster who  rst placed it in

the disk. Touch-range spells and spells that have speci c targets

(such as cause critical wounds or expeditious retreat) are targeted

upon the creature or object that shattered the disk, while area

and effect spells are triggered as though the broken disk were

the spells point of origin. For example, a stored  reball would

detonate in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the disk, whereas

a  ame blade would appear in the hand of the  creature  that

shattered the disk. If the spell stored in the disk does not have

a valid target (such as a disk imbued with cause critical wounds

that is broken by a falling rock), the spell simply fails to manifest

and is wasted.

This  potent  spell  opens  your  senses  to  the  Weave,  allowing

you to perceive its very fabric as clearly as you might see the

trees  in  a  forest  while  standing  in  the  heart  of  it.  When  a

spell is cast, you can visually observe its effects on the Weave.

Thanks  to  this  heightened  understanding,  you  can  use  the

counterspell  action  to  do  much  more  than  merely  counter

another casters spell.

Srinshees spell shift grants you a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft

checks made to identify spells for counterspelling. Furthermore,

instead of simply negating the effect of a spell you successfully

counter, you can choose from among the following options as

long as Srinshees spell shift lasts.

Aid: You can boost the effectiveness of an allys spell by ap-

plying any one metamagic feat from the following list: Empower

Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen

Spell. To use this option, you must expend a spell slot (or sacri ce

a prepared spell) whose spell level equals or exceeds that of the

allys spell with the desired metamagic feat applied. For example,

empowering an allys  reball would require you to expend a 5th-

level or higher spell slot.

Manipulate: You can seize control of the spells range, area,

or targets, as appropriate, and reshape these factors as you choose.

For example, you could cause an enemy wizards  reball to explode

at his feet, or you could cause his haste spell to target your allies

within the area he has speci ed. Only one property of the spell,

chosen from among those that the caster can normally designate,

can be manipulated in this manner. For example, you could not

STORM SHIELD

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 3, druid 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 30-ft.-radius emanation

Duration: 1 minute/level or until discharged (D)

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: See text

This spell creates a small, glowing sphere of amber light at a

point  you  designate.  Any  effect  that  deals  electricity  damage

(such as a lightning bolt or a blue dragons breath weapon) that

passes within 30 feet of the storm shield is attracted to it and

strikes the shield instead of its intended target. In the case of

area spells such as lightning bolt, this redirection occurs if any

portion of the spells area is within 30 feet of the storm shield.

In such a case, the entire effect is drawn to the storm shield, and

all creatures or objects that otherwise would have been in the

spells area remain unharmed.

The storm shield takes full damage (no saving throw) from

any effect drawn into it. The shield can absorb up to 20 points

of  electricity  damage  per  caster  level  before  dissipating.  Any

remaining damage is applied to all creatures within 10 feet of

the storm shields position (Re ex half; spell resistance applies).

For example, suppose a storm shield cast by a 5th-level cleric has

already absorbed 78 points of electricity damage when it is struck

by a lightning bolt that deals 45 points of damage. The  rst 22

points of damage is enough to destroy the storm shield, so every

creature within 10 feet of it takes 23 points of electricity damage

(or 11 with a successful save).

spherical ball measuring 5 inches in diameter at one end. The

sun scepter functions as a physical weapon that deals 2d6 points

of bludgeoning damage and has the axiomatic, disruption, and

 aming burst special abilities. You can strike with it as a melee

separate targets as long as all targets are within 10 feet of each

other. Each mouth strikes with an attack bonus equal to your

caster level plus the modi er for the ability score that controls

your  spellcasting,  and  each  deals  2d6  points  of  damage  on  a

successful hit.

Because the mouths are tangible, they can be destroyed. Each

has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. If

a mouth is destroyed, it fades away

into  nothingness,  but  the  other

mouths  remain.  If  all  the  mouths

are destroyed, the spells duration ends. The

main tentacle cannot be attacked.

TYCHES TOUCH

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 2

Components: S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature

Duration: 24 hours or until dis-

charged

Sa ving Throw:

Will negates

Sp ell Resistance:

Yes

This  spell  confers

either a protection or

a  curse  (your  choice

at  the  time  of  cast-

ing) upon a single living

creature.  The  effects  of

the  two  options  are  as

follows.

Protection:  The  subject

gains a +4 sacred bonus on the  rst saving throw

made after the spell is cast, a +3 sacred bonus on the

second saving throw, a +2 sacred bonus on the third, and a +1

sacred bonus on the fourth.

Curse:  The  subject  takes  a  4  penalty  on  the   rst  saving

throw made after the spell is cast, a 3 penalty on the second

saving throw, a 2 penalty on the third, and a 1 penalty on

the fourth.

Tyches touch lasts for 24 hours or until its power is exhausted

(after the fourth saving throw). Only one Tyches touch spell can

affect a given creature at one time. Tyches touch spells automati-

cally counter and dispel each other if cast on the same creature,

regardless of how many saving throws the  rst casting of the spell

has already affected. In recent years, both Beshaba and Tymora

have been known to grant Tyches touch.

Created by a court mage serving the Stag King

of Athalantar, this spell provides you with

a bit of breathing room when you

are  threatened  by  swarming

foes. When you cast the spell,

you project a blast of concen-

tric force that pushes away

creatures surrounding you.

Each creature is affected as

if it had been subjected to a

bull rush maneuver by a foe

of Large size with a Strength

score equal to 20 + your caster

level  (maximum  25),  and

the  attacker  had  moved

with the target (though

you  need  not  move  at

all). Movement caused

by  this  spell  provokes

attacks  of  opportunity,

just  as  the  movement

resulting  from  a  normal

bull rush would. Creatures grappling you are

not affected by this spell.

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: 30-ft.-long tentacle extending from your hand

Duration: Concentration, to a maximum of 1 round/level

This spell creates a shadowy tentacle of energy that extends 30

feet from your hand, splitting off into three smaller tentacles

about 10 feet from its end. Each of these smaller tentacles ends

in a fanged, slavering maw. All three of these mouths can be

directed  to  attack  as  a  full-round  action,  or  one  of  them  can

THESKYNS HEARTY HEAVE

Once you summon a disk, a single spell of up to 5th level can be

cast into it, either by you or by another spellcaster. If no spell is

cast into the disk within 10 minutes of its creation, it vanishes

into nothingness and the spell is wasted.

The disk stores an imbued spell inde nitely until it is shattered

(a standard action requiring only 1 point of damage or a DC 5

Strength check). At that point, the spell immediately takes effect

as if it had just been cast by the spellcaster who  rst placed it in

the disk. Touch-range spells and spells that have speci c targets

(such as cause critical wounds or expeditious retreat) are targeted

upon the creature or object that shattered the disk, while area

and effect spells are triggered as though the broken disk were

the spells point of origin. For example, a stored  reball would

detonate in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the disk, whereas

a  ame blade would appear in the hand of the  creature  that

shattered the disk. If the spell stored in the disk does not have

a valid target (such as a disk imbued with cause critical wounds

that is broken by a falling rock), the spell simply fails to manifest

and is wasted.

Material Component: A golden egg worth 200 gp.

SRINSHEES SPELL SHIFT

Abjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

This  potent  spell  opens  your  senses  to  the  Weave,  allowing

you to perceive its very fabric as clearly as you might see the

trees  in  a  forest  while  standing  in  the  heart  of  it.  When  a

spell is cast, you can visually observe its effects on the Weave.

Thanks  to  this  heightened  understanding,  you  can  use  the

counterspell  action  to  do  much  more  than  merely  counter

another casters spell.

Srinshees spell shift grants you a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft

checks made to identify spells for counterspelling. Furthermore,

instead of simply negating the effect of a spell you successfully

counter, you can choose from among the following options as

long as Srinshees spell shift lasts.

Aid: You can boost the effectiveness of an allys spell by ap-

plying any one metamagic feat from the following list: Empower

Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen

Spell. To use this option, you must expend a spell slot (or sacri ce

a prepared spell) whose spell level equals or exceeds that of the

allys spell with the desired metamagic feat applied. For example,

empowering an allys  reball would require you to expend a 5th-

level or higher spell slot.

Manipulate: You can seize control of the spells range, area,

or targets, as appropriate, and reshape these factors as you choose.

For example, you could cause an enemy wizards  reball to explode

at his feet, or you could cause his haste spell to target your allies

within the area he has speci ed. Only one property of the spell,

chosen from among those that the caster can normally designate,

can be manipulated in this manner. For example, you could not

STORM SHIELD

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 3, druid 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 30-ft.-radius emanation

Duration: 1 minute/level or until discharged (D)

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: See text

This spell creates a small, glowing sphere of amber light at a

point  you  designate.  Any  effect  that  deals  electricity  damage

(such as a lightning bolt or a blue dragons breath weapon) that

passes within 30 feet of the storm shield is attracted to it and

strikes the shield instead of its intended target. In the case of

area spells such as lightning bolt, this redirection occurs if any

portion of the spells area is within 30 feet of the storm shield.

In such a case, the entire effect is drawn to the storm shield, and

all creatures or objects that otherwise would have been in the

spells area remain unharmed.

The storm shield takes full damage (no saving throw) from

any effect drawn into it. The shield can absorb up to 20 points

of  electricity  damage  per  caster  level  before  dissipating.  Any

remaining damage is applied to all creatures within 10 feet of

the storm shields position (Re ex half; spell resistance applies).

For example, suppose a storm shield cast by a 5th-level cleric has

already absorbed 78 points of electricity damage when it is struck

by a lightning bolt that deals 45 points of damage. The  rst 22

points of damage is enough to destroy the storm shield, so every

creature within 10 feet of it takes 23 points of electricity damage

(or 11 with a successful save).

Material Component: A small chip of amber.

SUN SCEPTER

Conjuration (Creation) [Lawful, Light]

Level: Cleric 6

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Scepter of light

Duration: 1 round/level [D]

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  conjure  a  radiant,  macelike  scepter  of  solid  light,  ap-

proximately 3 feet long and 1 inch in diameter, with a dazzling,

spherical ball measuring 5 inches in diameter at one end. The

sun scepter functions as a physical weapon that deals 2d6 points

of bludgeoning damage and has the axiomatic, disruption, and

 aming burst special abilities. You can strike with it as a melee

separate targets as long as all targets are within 10 feet of each

other. Each mouth strikes with an attack bonus equal to your

caster level plus the modi er for the ability score that controls

your  spellcasting,  and  each  deals  2d6  points  of  damage  on  a

successful hit.

Because the mouths are tangible, they can be destroyed. Each

has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. If

a mouth is destroyed, it fades away

into  nothingness,  but  the  other

mouths  remain.  If  all  the  mouths

are destroyed, the spells duration ends. The

main tentacle cannot be attacked.

Material  Component:  Three  hairs  and

Dreams

Past

of the

Faerns past surrounds its present like an unpredictable

and pervasive force of nature, affecting its peoples in

many subtle ways. Sleeping threats can be awakened

by seemingly innocent acts, and adventurers can stumble upon

hidden evils, forgotten ruins, and the lost lore of ancient civi-

lizations in both likely and unlikely places. A relic of the past

can turn up anywhere at any timeperhaps as an archaic coin

given in payment for goods or services, or the fulllment of a

thousand-year-old Calishite prophecy, or a travelers discovery of

a forgotten city shrouded in a powerful mythal. Artifacts, archaic

prophecies, and deserted ruins are a just a few of the elements

from Faerns past that can be used to create adventures lled

with danger and historical intrigue.

The arcane power wielded by these ancient peoples can make

the  epic  spells  of  today  look  like  the  dabblings  of  fools  and

children.  Faerns  ancient  peoples  could  transport  people  and

goods on a large scale with teleportation magic, create portals by

the dozen, and even construct entire ying cities. The treasures

that survive such a kingdoms fall are often passed from hand to

hand across the continent, spreading far beyond the land where

they  were  made.  Thus,  artifacts  and  other  magic  items  from

lost empires can easily be incorporated into campaigns set in the

current year, even if the action takes place in lands far removed

from those that created the objects in question.

In  addition,  many  ancient  civilizations  left  living  legacies

that  survive  to  this  day.  Nations  such  as  Halruaa,  secretive

orders such as the Witches of Rashemen, and races such as the

daemonfey are only a few of the living creatures whose ancestors

inhabited the legendary kingdoms of the past. Contact with any

such group offers adventurers the opportunity to unearth old

magic items, spells, or magical traditions that may prove useful

in current-day Faern.

The Ruins of the Past

Some of the bold, young kingdoms of yesteryear disappeared into

obscurity relatively quickly, leaving little behind to mark their

passing. Others became mighty empires that lasted for centuries,

and a fortunate few endured for millennia. Yet after their rise to

power, even these fabled realms inevitably fell. Some kingdoms

ended in cataclysmic destruction, while others slowly declined,

either vanishing entirely or taking on less prominent roles in

current-day Faern.

Though their specic creeds varied widely, most of Faerns

truly great ancient civilizations built cultures rich in divine power,

arcane lore, and military might. Today, the fractured secrets of

those empires lie scattered throughout innumerable ruins and

hidden places, waiting for someone who can piece together the

fragments and learn the secrets they hold.

The key to making the past an essential part of the present is

to make ancient civilizations relevant to the campaigns current

crises and challenges. Clever adventurers often try to mine ruins

for archaic magic and lore to defeat current-day threats, especially

those that have their roots in centuries gone by.

Cities into Dungeons

The cities, towers, and castles of Faerns past are the dungeons

of today, and each has a unique origin that dictates what explorers

can nd there. For example, a ying Netherese city might have

plunged into the Sea of Falling Stars and come to rest intact on

the sea oor, where some sahuagin found it and made it their

own. If a magelords tower was shattered during a spectacular

spell-battle,  perhaps  her  vengeful  ghost  still  haunts  its  ruins.

Likewise, a keep abandoned after a long siege might now serve

as a haven for a tribe of hobgoblins.

The following sections describe the kinds of events that have

given rise to some of Faerns most interesting adventure sites.

CONQUERED LANDS

Both the empty Imaskari cities of the Raurin Desert and the

forsaken dwarven citadels of the North owe their current desolate

DREAMS OF THE PAST

states to wars, invasions, and uprisings that took place long ago.

In the wake of such bloody events, the inhabitants of the disputed

areas  were  typically  enslaved,  slaughtered,  or  driven  out,  and

entire cities and towns were reduced to smoking ruins. Realms

such as Ammarindar and Eaerlann in the eastern verge of the

High Forest are good examples of conquered lands.

Stone  buildings  typically  survive  a  citys  destruction  more

or less intact, though their walls bear scorch marks from re

and scars of physical violence from weapons of war and spells.

Large portions of conquered cities and entire castles are often

left  standing,  though  pillagers  usually  strip  them  of  obvious

valuables at the time of the attack. Looters sometimes overlook

certain structures (such as warded towers and prisons), leaving a

few secrets within.

ABANDONED EMPIRES

Plague, loss of wealth, and diminished military might can all

herald the fall of a great empire. Some realms struggling against

such  debilitating  problems  gradually  diminish,  only  to  disap-

pear entirely over time. Others slowly decline but continue to

exist, though they have been reduced to mere shadows of their

former glory. A few, such as Mulhorand and Unther, rise and

fall multiple times.

The best signs of an empire in decline are abandoned outposts

located along its fringes. When a kingdom scales back its border

defenses for lack of funding or soldiers, it leaves behind a string

of abandoned keeps, watchtowers, outposts, and trading villages,

most of which remain whole and intact, since destroying them

gains  attackers  little.  Few  such  buildings  contain  anything

of  value  because  the  former  residents  emptied  them  before

deserting them.

CATACLYSMS AND FORCES OF NATURE

An empire or city destroyed by a cataclysmic geological event

leaves few recognizable reminders of its former glory. Such events

have created dozens of ruins and destroyed many others over

the millennia. Faern has also been shaken by several magical

cataclysms,  the  most  notable  of  which  was  the  catastrophic

destruction of the Weave by Karsusan event that sent dozens

of ying Netherese cities crashing to the ground.

Cataclysmic events typically result in widespread death and

the massive destruction of settled areas. Earthquakes have been

known to swallow towers and huge sections of cities, thus creating

instant underground ruins. Volcanic eruptions, avalanches, and

mudslides can bury large areas in a matter of moments, preserving

any items that werent destroyed outright. Sandstorms and rising

Twenty Ancient Adventure Ideas

You can use the ideas presented in the following list to design

adventures  and  campaign  themes  around  elements  of  the

ancient past.

1    Miners tunneling near a ruined keep discover a powerful

lichs long-lost phylactery.

2    A merchant gives ancient coins as change, not realizing

that they were minted by a lost empire. The merchant

does  not  know  the  coins  origins  and  claims  to  have

received them as payment for a prior transaction.

3    An old folk song contains clues to solving an archaic

mystery.

4    Spellwards holding back a terrible evil have begun to

decay.  Adventurers  must  gather  the  parts  of  a  frag-

mented artifact from locations throughout Faern and

piece it back together to restore the failing wards.

5    A spellcasters wild surge yanks an object or creature

10   A character dreams of a long-dead ancestor who tells of

an age-old blood oath that the dreamer is duty-bound to

fulll.

11   An adventurer learns that she is descended from an ancient

royal line whose forgotten kingdom now lies in uncivilized

lands.

12   Zealous worshipers of a long-dead god proclaim the return

of their deity.

13   An  ancient  war-construct  is  reactivated  and  goes  on  a

rampage.

14   The cure for a devastating magical plague lies with an

imprisoned evil creature that offers to trade the item for

his release.

15   An aging artifact in an old ruin makes its presence known

via a sudden release of strange, magical energy.

true.

17   An adventurer experiences repeated visions of a horric

from the past and brings it into the present.

event that occurred long ago.

6    A mudslide, sandstorm, or earthquake unearths a buried

ruin.

7    A  merchant  at  a  bazaar  sells  adventurers  an  old,

worn-out item that turns out to be a powerful, ancient

artifact.

8    Invisibility wards concealing an ancient, arcane tower

fail, revealing its existence to surprised locals.

9    After an unusual storm, a mysterious artifact of legend

is found oating in midair.

18   A long-lived being who left Faern ages ago unexpectedly

returns.  He  knows  much  ancient  lore  but  threatens  to

cause severe harm because of his antiquated sensibilities

and prejudices.

19   An  ancient  suit  of  armor,  imbued  with  the  mind  of  a

legendary hero, has one last mission to fulll. It attempts

to possess the next person to wear it and nish what it

started long ago.

leaves few recognizable reminders of its former glory. Such events

have created dozens of ruins and destroyed many others over

the millennia. Faern has also been shaken by several magical

cataclysms,  the  most  notable  of  which  was  the  catastrophic

destruction of the Weave by Karsusan event that sent dozens

of ying Netherese cities crashing to the ground.

Cataclysmic events typically result in widespread death and

the massive destruction of settled areas. Earthquakes have been

known to swallow towers and huge sections of cities, thus creating

instant underground ruins. Volcanic eruptions, avalanches, and

mudslides can bury large areas in a matter of moments, preserving

any items that werent destroyed outright. Sandstorms and rising

Twenty Ancient Adventure Ideas

You can use the ideas presented in the following list to design

adventures  and  campaign  themes  around  elements  of  the

ancient past.

d20 Adventure

1    Miners tunneling near a ruined keep discover a powerful

lichs long-lost phylactery.

2    A merchant gives ancient coins as change, not realizing

that they were minted by a lost empire. The merchant

does  not  know  the  coins  origins  and  claims  to  have

received them as payment for a prior transaction.

3    An old folk song contains clues to solving an archaic

mystery.

4    Spellwards holding back a terrible evil have begun to

decay.  Adventurers  must  gather  the  parts  of  a  frag-

mented artifact from locations throughout Faern and

piece it back together to restore the failing wards.

5    A spellcasters wild surge yanks an object or creature

10   A character dreams of a long-dead ancestor who tells of

an age-old blood oath that the dreamer is duty-bound to

fulll.

11   An adventurer learns that she is descended from an ancient

royal line whose forgotten kingdom now lies in uncivilized

lands.

12   Zealous worshipers of a long-dead god proclaim the return

of their deity.

13   An  ancient  war-construct  is  reactivated  and  goes  on  a

rampage.

14   The cure for a devastating magical plague lies with an

imprisoned evil creature that offers to trade the item for

his release.

15   An aging artifact in an old ruin makes its presence known

via a sudden release of strange, magical energy.

16   Signs and portents from an ancient prophecy begin coming

true.

17   An adventurer experiences repeated visions of a horric

from the past and brings it into the present.

event that occurred long ago.

6    A mudslide, sandstorm, or earthquake unearths a buried

ruin.

7    A  merchant  at  a  bazaar  sells  adventurers  an  old,

worn-out item that turns out to be a powerful, ancient

artifact.

8    Invisibility wards concealing an ancient, arcane tower

fail, revealing its existence to surprised locals.

9    After an unusual storm, a mysterious artifact of legend

is found oating in midair.

18   A long-lived being who left Faern ages ago unexpectedly

returns.  He  knows  much  ancient  lore  but  threatens  to

cause severe harm because of his antiquated sensibilities

and prejudices.

19   An  ancient  suit  of  armor,  imbued  with  the  mind  of  a

legendary hero, has one last mission to fulll. It attempts

to possess the next person to wear it and nish what it

started long ago.

20  A portal to another world opens, inviting an invasion simi-

lar to one that occurred ages ago when it rst opened.

Faerns past surrounds its present like an unpredictable

and pervasive force of nature, affecting its peoples in

many subtle ways. Sleeping threats can be awakened

by seemingly innocent acts, and adventurers can stumble upon

hidden evils, forgotten ruins, and the lost lore of ancient civi-

lizations in both likely and unlikely places. A relic of the past

can turn up anywhere at any timeperhaps as an archaic coin

given in payment for goods or services, or the fulllment of a

thousand-year-old Calishite prophecy, or a travelers discovery of

a forgotten city shrouded in a powerful mythal. Artifacts, archaic

prophecies, and deserted ruins are a just a few of the elements

from Faerns past that can be used to create adventures lled

with danger and historical intrigue.

The arcane power wielded by these ancient peoples can make

the  epic  spells  of  today  look  like  the  dabblings  of  fools  and

children.  Faerns  ancient  peoples  could  transport  people  and

goods on a large scale with teleportation magic, create portals by

the dozen, and even construct entire ying cities. The treasures

that survive such a kingdoms fall are often passed from hand to

hand across the continent, spreading far beyond the land where

they  were  made.  Thus,  artifacts  and  other  magic  items  from

lost empires can easily be incorporated into campaigns set in the

current year, even if the action takes place in lands far removed

from those that created the objects in question.

In  addition,  many  ancient  civilizations  left  living  legacies

that  survive  to  this  day.  Nations  such  as  Halruaa,  secretive

orders such as the Witches of Rashemen, and races such as the

daemonfey are only a few of the living creatures whose ancestors

inhabited the legendary kingdoms of the past. Contact with any

such group offers adventurers the opportunity to unearth old

magic items, spells, or magical traditions that may prove useful

in current-day Faern.

The Ruins of the Past

Some of the bold, young kingdoms of yesteryear disappeared into

obscurity relatively quickly, leaving little behind to mark their

passing. Others became mighty empires that lasted for centuries,

and a fortunate few endured for millennia. Yet after their rise to

power, even these fabled realms inevitably fell. Some kingdoms

ended in cataclysmic destruction, while others slowly declined,

either vanishing entirely or taking on less prominent roles in

current-day Faern.

Though their specic creeds varied widely, most of Faerns

truly great ancient civilizations built cultures rich in divine power,

arcane lore, and military might. Today, the fractured secrets of

those empires lie scattered throughout innumerable ruins and

hidden places, waiting for someone who can piece together the

fragments and learn the secrets they hold.

The key to making the past an essential part of the present is

to make ancient civilizations relevant to the campaigns current

crises and challenges. Clever adventurers often try to mine ruins

for archaic magic and lore to defeat current-day threats, especially

those that have their roots in centuries gone by.

Cities into Dungeons

The cities, towers, and castles of Faerns past are the dungeons

of today, and each has a unique origin that dictates what explorers

can nd there. For example, a ying Netherese city might have

plunged into the Sea of Falling Stars and come to rest intact on

the sea oor, where some sahuagin found it and made it their

own. If a magelords tower was shattered during a spectacular

spell-battle,  perhaps  her  vengeful  ghost  still  haunts  its  ruins.

Likewise, a keep abandoned after a long siege might now serve

as a haven for a tribe of hobgoblins.

The following sections describe the kinds of events that have

given rise to some of Faerns most interesting adventure sites.

CONQUERED LANDS

Both the empty Imaskari cities of the Raurin Desert and the

forsaken dwarven citadels of the North owe their current desolate

seas can  ow over settled areas in a few short hours, creating

water- lled ruins that are quite challenging to explore. Perhaps

the rarest and most destructive catastrophic events of all are the

meteors or comets that occasionally strike Toril, leaving behind

only deep craters.

Since catastrophes strike with little warning, the ruins they

produce are usually  lled with the dead and their wealth. Most

buildings caught in such an event are heavily damaged, buried,

collapsed,  or  reduced  to  dust  and  rubble,  and  even

those  that  remain  standing  can  be  potential

death  traps  for  explorers  because

of their unstable  oors, walls, and

ceilings.  Structures  with  unusual

or unique protections may escape

the  worst  effects  of  a  cataclysm,

though  gaining  access  to  them

may  require  excavation  or  tele-

portation magic. Explorers face

extraordinary  challenges  when

retrieving the treasures and magic

embedded within such ruins.

BUILT UPON

THE ASHES

Both  survivors  of  cataclysms

and conquerors who have razed

enemy  kingdoms  often  build

new  cities  over  the  ruins  of

the  old.  For  example,  the

village  of  Secomber  is  built

atop the ruins of Hastarl,

the  capital  of  fallen

Athalantar, while Wa-

terdeep stands atop the

ruins of Aelinthaldaar, the

capital city of Illefarn. With the

passing of years, knowledge of the old

city beneath such a site fades until the citizens

forget that they live above ancient ruins.

Ruins under existing settled areas present different problems

for explorers than more remote ruins do. Typically, those wish-

ing to excavate or explore within an existing city must  rst seek

permission from the local ruler. Laws, religious customs, corrup-

tion, and the general attitude of the explorers can all play a part

in the rulers decision on such an issue, and he might insist on

a share of any treasure recovered in exchange for permission to

explore the ruins.

Interesting Sites

Many cities, keeps, and other ruins of fallen empires have long

since been plundered, but more than a few have lain undisturbed

since the demise of their creators. Such untouched caches of lore

are  doorways  to  the  past,  often   lled

with  unknown  treasures  and  unspeak-

able terrors.

The  accessibility  of  any  ruin  de-

pends  largely  on  the  condition

of  its  structures.  Some  an-

cient buildings still stand

strong, despite decades of

exposure to the elements,

but  the  ravages  of  war

and the inexorable march

of  years  have  dangerously

eroded  others.  Explor-

ers  seeking  entry  into

seriously  deteriorated

or  damaged  ruins  risk

death  via  collapse  or

cave-in (see page 66 of

the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide),  as  well  as  the

hidden  dangers  of  the

site itself.

How to Use the Random Ruins Tables

Tables 21 through 27, on the next few pages, provide a

way  for  the  DM  to  determine  the  occupants  and  physical

features of a ruined site. To use the tables that are based on

a d% roll (all of them except Table 24), make anywhere

from  one  to  six  d%  rolls,  ignoring  or  rerolling  duplicate

results. The number of d% rolls you make can be randomly

generated by rolling 1d6, or you can simply pick a number

that suits your purposes.

For example, assume you want to use Table 23 to determine

the recognizable features of a ruined castle or keep. You roll

1d6 and get a result of 4, so you next make four d% rolls.

Those results are 24 (courtyard), 42 (meeting hall), 55 (magical

defenses), and 79 (stable). Combining those results, you reveal

to the players that standing before them is a ruined castle in

which the courtyard, the meeting hall, and the stables are all

relatively intact, and at least one of those areas has some form

of magical protection still active.

Much evidence of how a city once functioned can be gleaned

from the layout of its ruins. The orderly nature of a well-planned

CASTLES AND KEEPS

Perhaps the most prevalent ruined structure found in Toril, the

ruined castle survives as a symbol of kingly ambition and lord-

ship over a realm. The castles and keeps of Faern are usually

houses  for  magic  artifacts  and  religious  relics.  Certain  castles

also  gained  fame  or  notoriety  for  housing  military,  religious,

and monastic orders.

EXTRADIMENSIONAL SPACES

Spellcasters from various lost empires created permanent extradi-

mensional spaces and demiplanes to serve as homes, sanctuaries,

prisons, and storehouses, and many of them still exist today.

OUTPOSTS

The  far- ung  borders  of  ancient  civilizations  were  generally

defenses may also be present if the castle was occupied by capable

Ruined  strongholds  usually  occupy  positions  of  strategic

signi cance.  As  fortresses,  they  held  garrisons  of  troops  and

armories  lled with weapons, and they sometimes served as safe

houses  for  magic  artifacts  and  religious  relics.  Certain  castles

also  gained  fame  or  notoriety  for  housing  military,  religious,

and monastic orders.

EXTRADIMENSIONAL SPACES

Spellcasters from various lost empires created permanent extradi-

mensional spaces and demiplanes to serve as homes, sanctuaries,

prisons, and storehouses, and many of them still exist today.

OUTPOSTS

The  far- ung  borders  of  ancient  civilizations  were  generally

marked with a series of outposts, which served as way stations,

prevalent in the distant empire with which they were afliated,

though they were usually constructed of local building materials.

of a ruined outpost.

TEMPLES

Faerns deities have a long and convoluted history, part of which

can be gleaned from the contents of ruined and abandoned temples

built by the citizens of past empires. Some of these temples mark

the areas where gods that are now dead or forsaken were once

worshiped; others show where (and when) new gods arose. A few

of these ancient places of worship are among the earliest holy (or

unholy) sites dedicated to deities that are still worshiped today.

Ancient  temples  can  serve  as  repositories  for  divine  relics,

or house magic items and tomes that detail archaic rituals and

prayers. Legends describing lost divine treasures may tempt the

faithful to seek out old temples in hopes of discovering ancient

knowledge about their gods, and explorers may uncover unknown

aspects of existing deities by means of religious artifacts recovered

from such places.

TOMBS AND BURIAL GROUNDS

Many cultures regard the interment of the dead as one of the most

solemn and important duties of the living. Final resting places

vary considerably with the cultures that created them, and the

ancient burial places of lost civilizations can be found throughout

Faern. Grand vaults, pyramids, mausoleums, and stone crypts

house Faerns dead on the surface, and deep catacombs, dwarven

crypts, and the bone pits of savage races house the bones of the

ancients belowground.

Some of the more elaborate burial places (such as the mighty

pyramids of the Mulhorandi) were built exclusively for emperors,

archpriests, glorious servitors, and other individuals of equally

high rank. Those buried in such magnicent graves are often

accompanied by riches and magic items that they possessed in life,

of all sorts.

TOWERS

Ruined arcane towers are scattered across the entire length and

breadth of Faern. Some are far from civilized areas; others stand

in the middle of cities and towns. Be it a wizards spire, a magical

university, or a summoning chamber hidden deep beneath the

earth, such a tower typically belonged to a mage of great power

who used it as a home, library, and laboratory. Now abandoned,

these arcane towers lure the curious with rumors of forgotten

magical practices, mysterious spells, and items of great power.

Arcane towers provide a wealth of adventuring opportuni-

ties for those who seek magical power and lore, but experienced

adventurers  know  better  than  to  presume  that  the  owner  of

an  abandoned  tower  is  dead.  Extremely  powerful  wizards  and

sorcerers who travel to other planes or even other worlds may

spend centuries at a time away from Toril but still fully intend

have alarms that notify their masters in the event of an intrusion,

and some can recall their owners from other dimensions should

the need arise.

Ancient Deities

Ancient  ruins  often  house  shrines,  mausoleums,  or  temples

dedicated to deities that either died long ago or are sleeping so

deeply that they may as well be dead. But the death of a god takes

a long time, and even a deity that has long since lost its mortal

worshipers may persist as a universal principle or a symbol that

still retains a tiny spark of divine power. Conversely, deities that

are truly dead may still have worshipers who perform their rites

and observe their holy days, thus keeping their cults alive.

In fact, clerics devoted to dead or dying gods exist in small

numbers throughout Faern. As might be expected, deities that

died fairly recently (such as Bhaal, Myrkul, and Moander) tend

to have more worshipers than those that perished long ago (such

as Auppenser).

Unlike the clerics of living deities, a cleric of a dead or dying

god must take the Servant of the Fallen feat (see page 9) in order

to obtain spells. This feat represents a special pact with the dead

god or a strong devotion to his symbols and principles. In some

cases, this feat can also grant a cleric the ability to petition spells

from near-divinitiesbeings who almost became gods and were

once worshiped as such.

In truth, serving a dead deity has few advantages, especially

when so many active and living gods are available for worship.

However, those few advantages can be signicant ones. For ex-

ample, the lack of an organized or recognized church can prove

to be quite an advantage to an ambitious character with a strong

personal agenda. After all, if youre the only cleric of Auppenser

in the area, whos going to argue about whether your actions and

words conform to the accepted beliefs and practices of the faith?

In the end, devotion is not simply a matter of calculating the most

advantageous path. The worship of a dead god may be entirely

appropriate for a character who holds to that deitys tenets or

hails from an area near the churchs former power base.

Amaunator

A Netherese deity of order and the sun, Amaunator was also

revered as the patron of law and time. The justice he dealt was

always harsh but eminently fair. Amaunator was a careful and

meticulous  deity  who  made  certain  that  every  agreement  was

written down, contracted, signed, sealed, and witnessed.

When Netheril fell, Amaunator was largely abandoned by the

common folk because they believed that he had done nothing to

prevent the disaster. Some religious scholars insist that Amaunator

died, but others (notably the sunmasters of Lathanders church)

argue that he was reborn as Lathander. Still others believe he sur-

vives as the vengeful Bedine deity known as Atar the Merciless.

Auppenser

The  Master  of  the  Invisible  Art  and  the  Lord  of  Reason,

Auppenser was a deity of thought, reason, self-knowledge, and

serenity. His worship reached his zenith in the days of Jhaamdath,

the Twelve Cities of Swords. In this society, the great bladelords

ruled as a psiocracy, and physical and mental self-knowledge were

considered the highest virtues.

Auppenser was gravely weakened by the destruction of Jhaam-

dath, and his faith simply dwindled into nonexistence over the

next few centuries. Of all the ancient gods, however, Auppenser

alone still maintains a glimmer of awareness and a handful of

devoted worshipers.

Bhaal

Bhaal, the god of assassins, murderers, and death by violence,

was part of a triumvirate of surpassingly powerful mortals who

challenged Jergal for mastery over death, evil, and murder. Jergal

acquiesced, and his portfolios were divided among the

three, with death going to Myrkul, evil to Bane, and

murder to Bhaal.

Bhaal was a cruel god whose portfolio included as-

sassination, murder, and all forms of death by violence.

As fate would have it, however, the god of murder was

himself murdered by Cyric during the Time of Troubles.

But Bhaal left behind a small army of mortal descen-

dants known as bhaalspawn, who now seek to claim the

divine mantle that their progenitor once held.

Gilgeam

Supreme leader of the gods of Unther and deic ruler

of that land for almost two thousand years, Gilgeam

was  known  for  his  jealousy,  cruelty,  and  pride.  He

called himself the Father of Victory and claimed to

rule over many of the lands surrounding Unther, even

though these subject realms had long ago shaken off

Unthers rule.

When the Time of Troubles came to an end, Gilgeam

was  drastically  reduced  in  power  as  punishment  for

centuries-long abuse of his worshipers. Soon thereafter,

he was slain by Tiamat in a battle that devastated the

city of Unthalass.

Ibrandul

A Calishite deity of darkness, underground places, and

stealth, Ibrandul was quite popular among adventurers.

During the Time of Troubles, he was killed by Shar, who

absorbed much of his portfolio. The Lady of Sorrows

even  masqueraded  as  Ibrandul  for  a  time  to  conceal

her dark deed.

Leira

The Lady of Mists was the goddess of deception and

illusion and the patroness of illusionists and liars. She

was not widely worshiped except among practitioners of

illusion magic, although many casual worshipers paid

her homage to placate her before making important

decisions and judgments. Leira perished shortly after the

Time of Troubles, when Mask betrayed her to Cyric.

Moander

An ancient god of rot, corruption, disease, and decay,

Moander has been banished from Faern on more than

one occasion. Though he was never widely worshiped,

he commanded the allegiance of a number of small

cults, ruling over his miserable followers as a cruel and

petty tyrant. Moander was slain on his home plane by

the human bard Finder Wyvernspur, who then seized

his divine power.

Myrkul

Many centuries ago, a mortal named Myrkul and his two compa-

triots (Bhaal and Bane) rose to take Jergals place in the Faernian

pantheon. Also known as the Lord of Bones or the Lord of the

Dead, Myrkul was a cold, malignant, and rational death god, and

mortals feared him greatly. After he was destroyed atop Blackstaff

Tower in Waterdeep during the Time of Troubles, Cyric briey

usurped his portfolio. Eventually, however, Kelemvor Lyonsbane

wrested the rulership of the dead away from the Black Sun.

Ramman

The onetime war deity of the Untheric pantheon and the chief

rival  of  Gilgeam,  Ramman  was  a  strong  but  fair  champion

who led Unther to its rst great victories. Initially, he battled

against the Imaskarithe hated overlords who had enslaved the

Untheric people. Some time later, he fought furiously to defend

Unther against the terrible invasions of the Orcgate Wars, in

which several other members of the pantheon died. Ramman

nally perished in the Time of Troubles, when he was slain by

the vengeful deity Hoar.

Tchazzar

The great warlord known as Tchazzar led the cities of Chessenta

in rebellion against Unther more than four hundred years ago.

After establishing Chessenta as an independent land and ruling

it for many years, the mighty hero-king disappeared from the

realm without a trace.

In truth, Tchazzar was a great red dragon who had hoped to

achieve godhood by founding a temple and establishing a heroic

myth to attract worshipers. To that end, he used shapechanging

magic to take human form and become a hero in the eyes of

Chessentans. Some time after he achieved his goal of attaining

divinity, Tchazzar was devoured by Tiamat, but many Chessentans

still revere the memory of the legendary warlord.

Epic Magic

Faerns ancient realms are often associated with magic of as-

tonishing power. Indeed, legend has it that the citizens of certain

ancient magical kingdoms could create cities that ew through

the air, hide entire forests from the sight of enemies, and unleash

terrible catastrophes capable of reducing entire kingdoms to ruins.

The legacies of such wizardry still exist today in several forms,

including old elven mythals that support dozens of spells as well

as great bindings and barriers that keep lost strongholds secure.

Their power is also apparent in the vast wastelands that were

great nations before ancient spells brought them low.

current-day  spellcasters  no  longer  have  access  to  true  spells  of

10th level and higher. Instead, access to epic magic comes via two

featsImproved Spellcasting Capacity and Epic Spellcastingthat

function in very different ways.

The  Improved  Spellcasting  Capacity  feat  grants  spell  slots

above  9th,  theoretically  without  limit.  Before  Mystras  ban,

powerful mages could ll these spell slots either with true spells

of 10th level or higher, or with 9th-level or lower spells fortied

by various metamagic feats. After Mystras ban, only the latter

option remained available.

The Epic Spellcasting feat allows the development and casting

of epic spells (spells requiring the use of the epic spell system

presented  in  the  Epic Level Handbook, cast  through  superior

mastery of the Spellcraft skill). Mystras ban has never applied

to epic spells, even those that duplicate the effects of 10th-level

and higher spells developed before the fall of Netheril.

Epic spells did exist during the days of Netheril, but the Neth-

erese largely abandoned their development after the discovery of the

nether scrolls. During the age of Netheril, epic spells were largely

the province of the Fair Folk and were thus almost exclusively

associated with elven high magic. The Netherese, for their part,

preferred to develop and use 10th-level and higher spells.

Epic Spell

The fact that spells such as Ioulaums longevity, Mythanthors

create  mythal,  Proctivs  move  mountain,  and  Tolodines  killing

wind have existed as both high-level spells and epic spells invari-

ably leads to some confusion among scholars of the Art. In the

case of Ioulaums longevity, the famed archwizard Ioulaum created

a 10th-level version before the fall of Netheril and an epic spell

version after Karsuss Folly. The latter was the version cast by

Ioulaums apprentice Tabra, who then destroyed all records she

could nd of it.

Mystras Ban and Epic Magic

All those who live by magic know that in ages long past, mages

had access to spells of great power. In the aftermath of Netherils

fall, however, Mystra banned certain high-level spells that she

deemed  too  powerful  for  mortals  to  wield  responsibly.  Thus,

This spell deals 20d6 points of damage to every creature within

its area. A living target that is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points

(or a construct, object, or undead that is reduced to 0 hit points)

is  utterly  destroyed  as  if  disintegrated,  leaving  behind  only  a

trace of ne dust. This spell also extends the casters current age

category by 1 year for every living creature it slays.

acquiesced, and his portfolios were divided among the

three, with death going to Myrkul, evil to Bane, and

murder to Bhaal.

Bhaal was a cruel god whose portfolio included as-

sassination, murder, and all forms of death by violence.

As fate would have it, however, the god of murder was

himself murdered by Cyric during the Time of Troubles.

But Bhaal left behind a small army of mortal descen-

dants known as bhaalspawn, who now seek to claim the

divine mantle that their progenitor once held.

Gilgeam

Supreme leader of the gods of Unther and deic ruler

of that land for almost two thousand years, Gilgeam

was  known  for  his  jealousy,  cruelty,  and  pride.  He

called himself the Father of Victory and claimed to

rule over many of the lands surrounding Unther, even

though these subject realms had long ago shaken off

Unthers rule.

When the Time of Troubles came to an end, Gilgeam

was  drastically  reduced  in  power  as  punishment  for

centuries-long abuse of his worshipers. Soon thereafter,

he was slain by Tiamat in a battle that devastated the

city of Unthalass.

Ibrandul

A Calishite deity of darkness, underground places, and

stealth, Ibrandul was quite popular among adventurers.

During the Time of Troubles, he was killed by Shar, who

absorbed much of his portfolio. The Lady of Sorrows

even  masqueraded  as  Ibrandul  for  a  time  to  conceal

her dark deed.

Leira

The Lady of Mists was the goddess of deception and

illusion and the patroness of illusionists and liars. She

was not widely worshiped except among practitioners of

illusion magic, although many casual worshipers paid

her homage to placate her before making important

decisions and judgments. Leira perished shortly after the

Time of Troubles, when Mask betrayed her to Cyric.

Moander

An ancient god of rot, corruption, disease, and decay,

Moander has been banished from Faern on more than

one occasion. Though he was never widely worshiped,

he commanded the allegiance of a number of small

cults, ruling over his miserable followers as a cruel and

petty tyrant. Moander was slain on his home plane by

the human bard Finder Wyvernspur, who then seized

his divine power.

Mythals

Many of Faerns ancient places are protected by mighty arti ces

of epic magic known as mythals. Characters within the area of a

mythal may gain the bene ts of wondrous magical effects, such as

the ability to  y at will, walk up sheer walls, invoke healing spells

at will, or even banish demons with a single word. Conversely,

a mythal might deny those within its con nes access to entire

schools or types of spells, or prevent teleportation, scrying, death

magic, or healing.

The  construction  of  a  mythal  should  not  be  undertaken

lightlyeven a minor one requires an epic spell of some dif culty.

But some of those who seek to understand and master the lore

of fallen kingdoms know the secrets of mythal-raising and seek

to use that long-forgotten knowledge.

While high-level spells capable of creating mythals may once

have existed, most surviving mythals, near-mythals, and similar

magical  arti ces  were  actually  constructed  with  unique  spells

derived from the mythal spell seed. For example, the legendary

mage Mythanthor used an epic spell he had researched to raise

the mythal of Myth Drannor. Mythals of similar origin often

bear some resemblance to each other and may share common

conventions or features.

What Is a Mythal?

Any permanent magical ward or  eld raised via epic magic can

be considered a mythal. Some scholars draw distinctions between

true mythals, wizard mythals, and near-mythals, but the differences

among these effects are largely based on semantics and tradition.

Mythals developed in accordance with the teachings of elven high

magic may look different from wards or barriers based on other

traditions, but they are functionally equivalent. The only real

distinction is that the great elven mythals of old (true mythals)

were the  rst ones raised in Faern. They were ambitious and

enduring, and they often covered sizable areas.

Mythals  still  exist  in  a  number  of  places.  Those  raised  by

elven high mages include Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, the

Elven  Court,  Myth  Adofhaer,  Myth  Dyraalis,  Myth  Nantar,

Myth  Ondath,  Myth  Rhynn,  and  Myth  Unnohyr,  as  well  as

others now lost to history. Mythals such as those at Shoonachs

Imperial Mount, Myth Iiscar, and Myth Lharast have also been

crafted by non-elves using epic spells.

Raising a Mythal

A unique epic spell to raise a new mythal can be developed in

much  the  same  way  as  other  epic  spells  (see  the  Epic  Level

Handbook).  All  mythals  are  permanent  effects  based  on  the

mythal spell seed, and all provide magical bene ts to some (or all)

creatures within their bounds. Such spells are usually developed as

Epic Spell Seeds

Epic magic in Faern generally conforms to the rules described

in the Epic Level Handbook. Two spell seeds common to some

of Faerns greatest works of epic magic are presented here.

SEED: MYTHAL

Evocation

Spellcraft DC: 25

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 30 ft.

Area: 100-ft.-radius emanation

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You create a persistent magical  eld centered on the point you

choose. You (or other casters cooperating with you) can then cast

a number of other spells into this  eld, thereby either granting

or denying access to them to creatures within the  eld. Effects

you can include in your mythal fall into four categories: prevalent

spells  (always  active),  arointed  spells  (always  denied  to  those

within the  eld), vanguard spells (available on demand to those

within the  eld), and prevalent powers (persistent effects that

do not map to any particular spell). Your mythal can include up

to one effect per caster level, but each component spell you cast

into it affects the Spellcraft DC of your raise mythal spell (see

Mythals, below).

Once raised, a mythal cannot be dispelled, disjoined, or sup-

pressed by any nonepic spell. A character attempting to dispel

your mythal with an epic spell (such as superb dispelling) must

succeed on a caster level check (DC 21 + your caster level) to

succeed. An antimagic  eld suppresses the portion of the mythal

that it overlaps but otherwise does it no harm.

SEED: SHADOW

Illusion (Shadow)

Spellcraft DC: 23

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 0 feet

Target: One duplicated creature, object, or spell

Duration: 1 hour

Saving Throw: Will disbelief

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  fashion  a  double  of  one  creature,  item,  or  spell  entirely

from shadows.

You can use this seed to duplicate any creature of CR 5 or

lower. For each +1 you add to the creatures CR, the Spellcraft DC

increases by 2. You specify the creatures type, subtype, gender, age,

and appearance. The creature appears to be an average specimen

of its kind and at all times remains under your absolute com-

mand. No telepathic link exists, so you must be able to exercise

command over it in some other way to control it. The shadow

creature cannot become more powerful by increasing its level,

improving its abilities, or augmenting any other intrinsic features.

If slain, it disappears, seeming to melt away into shadows.

A spell created with the shadow seed can also duplicate a

speci cally named, unique creature, but this usage increases the

Spellcraft DC by 20. Such a duplicate is alive for the spells

duration and possesses the full hit points, knowledge (including

class levels, skills, and speech), and personality of the original

creature.

The shadow seed can also be used in spells to duplicate any

nonmagical, unliving, unattended object up to 10 cubic feet in

volume. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to create

a complex item (a Craft [armorsmithing] check to make plate

mail, for example). You can create matter ranging in hardness

and rarity from cloth all the way to gold or steel. A simple object

(such as a knife, a saddle, a wooden box, or a rock) has a natural

duration of 12 hours. For each additional cubic foot of matter

created, the Spellcraft DC increases by 1. Attempting to use any

shadow object as a material component or as a resource during

epic spell development causes the spell to fail and the object to

dissolve immediately.

An epic spell created with the shadow seed can duplicate spells

of up to 1st level from a single school of magic. Each additional

spell level beyond 1st increases the Spellcraft DC by 5, and each

additional school of magic to be included adds 2 to the Spellcraft

DC. Allowing the duplication of both arcane and divine spells

adds 10 to the DC. If the spell to be duplicated has an XP cost,

then the caster must pay that in addition to any XP required by

the epic spells casting.

Anyone physically interacting with a creature, object, or effect

created via the shadow seed gains a Will save to disbelieve. A

Epic Spellcasting Classes

The following epic spellcasting classes have appeared in various

FORGOTTEN REALMS sourcebooks without any specific mention

of whether advancing in them increases the characters caster

level.

Elven  High  Mage:  The  elven  high  mage  prestige  class

appears  in  Races  of  Faern.  Such  a  characters  caster  level

increases by 1 with each level of spell progression (that is, +1

per two levels).

Netherese Arcanist: This prestige class appears in Players

Guide to Faern. The Netherese arcanists caster level increases

by 1 with each level of the prestige class.

Epic Spell Seeds

Epic magic in Faern generally conforms to the rules described

in the Epic Level Handbook. Two spell seeds common to some

of Faerns greatest works of epic magic are presented here.

SEED: MYTHAL

Evocation

Spellcraft DC: 25

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 30 ft.

Area: 100-ft.-radius emanation

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You create a persistent magical  eld centered on the point you

choose. You (or other casters cooperating with you) can then cast

a number of other spells into this  eld, thereby either granting

or denying access to them to creatures within the  eld. Effects

you can include in your mythal fall into four categories: prevalent

spells  (always  active),  arointed  spells  (always  denied  to  those

within the  eld), vanguard spells (available on demand to those

within the  eld), and prevalent powers (persistent effects that

do not map to any particular spell). Your mythal can include up

to one effect per caster level, but each component spell you cast

into it affects the Spellcraft DC of your raise mythal spell (see

Mythals, below).

Once raised, a mythal cannot be dispelled, disjoined, or sup-

pressed by any nonepic spell. A character attempting to dispel

your mythal with an epic spell (such as superb dispelling) must

succeed on a caster level check (DC 21 + your caster level) to

succeed. An antimagic  eld suppresses the portion of the mythal

that it overlaps but otherwise does it no harm.

SEED: SHADOW

Illusion (Shadow)

Spellcraft DC: 23

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 0 feet

Target: One duplicated creature, object, or spell

Duration: 1 hour

Saving Throw: Will disbelief

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  fashion  a  double  of  one  creature,  item,  or  spell  entirely

from shadows.

You can use this seed to duplicate any creature of CR 5 or

lower. For each +1 you add to the creatures CR, the Spellcraft DC

increases by 2. You specify the creatures type, subtype, gender, age,

and appearance. The creature appears to be an average specimen

of its kind and at all times remains under your absolute com-

mand. No telepathic link exists, so you must be able to exercise

command over it in some other way to control it. The shadow

creature cannot become more powerful by increasing its level,

improving its abilities, or augmenting any other intrinsic features.

If slain, it disappears, seeming to melt away into shadows.

A spell created with the shadow seed can also duplicate a

speci cally named, unique creature, but this usage increases the

Spellcraft DC by 20. Such a duplicate is alive for the spells

duration and possesses the full hit points, knowledge (including

class levels, skills, and speech), and personality of the original

creature.

The shadow seed can also be used in spells to duplicate any

nonmagical, unliving, unattended object up to 10 cubic feet in

volume. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to create

a complex item (a Craft [armorsmithing] check to make plate

mail, for example). You can create matter ranging in hardness

and rarity from cloth all the way to gold or steel. A simple object

(such as a knife, a saddle, a wooden box, or a rock) has a natural

duration of 12 hours. For each additional cubic foot of matter

created, the Spellcraft DC increases by 1. Attempting to use any

shadow object as a material component or as a resource during

epic spell development causes the spell to fail and the object to

dissolve immediately.

An epic spell created with the shadow seed can duplicate spells

of up to 1st level from a single school of magic. Each additional

spell level beyond 1st increases the Spellcraft DC by 5, and each

additional school of magic to be included adds 2 to the Spellcraft

DC. Allowing the duplication of both arcane and divine spells

adds 10 to the DC. If the spell to be duplicated has an XP cost,

then the caster must pay that in addition to any XP required by

the epic spells casting.

Anyone physically interacting with a creature, object, or effect

created via the shadow seed gains a Will save to disbelieve. A

Epic Spellcasting Classes

The following epic spellcasting classes have appeared in various

FORGOTTEN REALMS sourcebooks without any specific mention

of whether advancing in them increases the characters caster

level.

Elven  High  Mage:  The  elven  high  mage  prestige  class

appears  in  Races  of  Faern.  Such  a  characters  caster  level

increases by 1 with each level of spell progression (that is, +1

per two levels).

Netherese Arcanist: This prestige class appears in Players

Guide to Faern. The Netherese arcanists caster level increases

by 1 with each level of the prestige class.

rites requiring multiple casters, primarily because the Spellcraft

DCs would otherwise be too high even for the most experienced

To create a mythal, use the following procedure.

1.  Begin with the mythal seed.

2.  Choose the powers you want your mythal to have.

3.  Calculate the component cost of each power.

4.  Total the component costs and divide by 1,000. Add this value

to the base Spellcraft DC of the mythal seed.

5.  Add any the value of any epic spell factors (such as increased

area)  from  Table  22  in  the  Epic  Level  Handbook  that

apply.

6.  Determine which mitigating factors (from Table 23 in the

Epic Level Handbook) your raise mythal spell will employ.

7.  Obtain the approval of your DM.

8.  Research your raise mythal spell.

MYTHAL COMPONENTS

Each mythal is dened by the particular suite of powers it offers

through its components and the effects it denies to those within

its area, as follows.

Prevalent  Spells:  Prevalent  spells  are  always  in  effect  on

creatures within the mythal. You must make all the decisions

necessary for a prevalent spell upon creating your mythal, just

as if you were creating a use-activated magic item. A spell with

a duration of instantaneous cannot be used as a prevalent spell.

The cost of a prevalent spell varies with its normal duration.

Since it is always in effect, a spell with a short duration costs

more to make prevalent than one with a long duration.

Renewable Spells: A prevalent spell that would normally end

after its capacity has been reached (such as stoneskin, protection

from energy, or spell turning) can be designated as a renewable

prevalent spell. Such a spell confers its benets on any given user

only once per 24 hours. When its effect is exhausted through

whatever  means  are  normal  for  the  specic  spell,  it  does  not

renew itself upon that subject until 24 hours after the rst time

its benets are used (the rst time that damage was negated by

a stoneskin or protection from energy, for example). If the spells

benets have not yet been exhausted by that time, the effect con-

tinues until it is exhausted and is then immediately renewed.

Arointed Spells: Arointed spells automatically fail when cast

inside the mythal or targeted at creatures or objects within it.

You can aroint a single spell or all spells that share a common

factor, such as a descriptor, energy type, subschool, or school.

Vanguard Spells: A vanguard spell is activated with a command

word as a standard action, just as if it were a magic item in the

users possession. Any creature within the mythal can activate a

vanguard spell as often as desired.

You can reduce the cost of a vanguard spell component by

making it available a limited number of times to each creature

in any 24-hour period.

Prevalent Powers: Components not easily described by spells

fall into three categories: minor (comparable to spells of 1st to

3rd level or minor magic items), medium (comparable to spells of

4th to 6th level or medium magic items), or major (comparable

to spells of 7th to 9th level or major magic items).

A prevalent power is a good way to represent a spell that could

not normally be made prevalent. For example, if you want your

mythal to automatically use dismissal on every evil outsider that

enters, you can describe the effect as a medium prevalent power.

A meteor swarm produced whenever any evil dragon enters would

count as a major prevalent power. Prevalent powers that continue to

function round after round should be considerably more expensive

than those powers that function only once upon entry.

Keyed Powers: Any component of a mythal can be keyed to

specic creatures. For example, a prevalent y spell can be made

specic to elves, humanoids, or creatures carrying certain tokens. In

the same manner, spells with certain descriptors (such as the death

descriptor) can be arointed for particular categories (such as good-

aligned dwarves), and vanguard spells can be made available only

to creatures that undergo a process of attunement to the mythal.

You  can  key  a  mythal  component  by  designating  specic

observable characteristics that bar or permit access to various

effects, or by designating certain individuals present at the casting

to be affected, or by designating a process by which a creature may

at some future date gain access to mythal powers. For example,

a creature might have to undergo a special rite, perform specic

actions within the mythal, or the like. Keyed components are

twice as expensive as unkeyed components.

Spell Trigger: You can reduce the component cost of any spell

by making it accessible only to creatures capable of producing

the effect with a spell trigger item.

Limited Area: If the effect is available only within a certain section

of the mythal (25% or less of the total area), the cost is halved.

CREATING THE RAISE MYTHAL SPELL

To create a specic raise mythal spell from the mythal seed and

the components you have chosen, total the component costs of

the effects you want the mythal to produce, as given on Table

29. The total Spellcraft DC modier for your suite of mythal

powers equals 25 + (total component cost divided by 1,000).

Mythals need not pay the 5 modier for a permanent duration,

since the mythal seed already produces a permanent effect.

Mitigating  Factors:  Mythals  with  numerous  components

typically have very high Spellcraft DCsoften 300 or higher.

However,  raise  mythal  spells  are  almost  always  built  with

signicant  mitigating  factors.  Mythals  often  require  a  sizable

expenditure of XP and the cooperation of numerous additional

spellcasters, and many deal signicant backlash damage. In addi-

tion, mythals often feature special mitigating factors not found

in other epic spells, as given in Table 210. These mitigating

factors are explained in detail below.

Anchored

Caster Dies: The death of the caster may seem like an insuper-

able deterrent to the creation of a mythal, but many elven high

mages are more than ready to go to Arvandor by the time they

become capable of such magic. In elf society, sacricing ones

life to create a mighty work of the Art ranks among the most

highly honored ways to leave the world.

Capstone: A mythal with a capstone possesses a critical physical

componenta standing stone, a massive throne, a great tree, a

beautiful fountain, or the likethat focuses and tethers the magic.

Destroying the capstone destroys the mythal, so mythal-makers

who use capstones always conceal them carefully and defend them

with powerful magic.

Corruptible:  The  base  duration  of  a  corruptible  mythal  is

one hundred years instead of permanent. The mythal does not

fail automatically after a hundred years have passed, but it must

begin to make integrity checks once per year at that point. An

integrity check is a Spellcraft check using the original casters

Spellcraft modier at the time the mythal was raised (even if

the original caster is no longer present or alive). The DC for the

check varies with time and circumstances, but initially, it equals

the mythals nal Spellcraft DC (after mitigating factors have

been applied) minus 20. For example, if a mythals Spellcraft DC

was 46 after applying the mitigating factors, its initial integrity

DC is 26. Thereafter, the DC of the integrity check increases by

1 per ten full years past one hundred, by 1 per previous failed

integrity  check,  and  by  2  per  anchor-damaging  event  (if  the

mythal is both corruptible and anchored).

When a mythal fails an integrity check, roll d% and consult

Table 211 to determine the effect.

The base duration of a corruptible mythal can be increased in

increments of 100% (to two hundred years, three hundred years,

or more) by applying the normal epic spell factor for increased

duration, at a cost of +2 to the DC per iteration. This factor is

applied after the 3/4 reduction to the DC for making the mythal

corruptible in the rst place.

Corruptible mythals are often maintained periodically through

the  use  of  epic  mythal  rejuvenation  spells  created  specically

for that purpose. The base DC for the rejuvenation spell equals

one-half that of the raise mythal spell that created the particular

mythal before mitigating factors were applied, though it may also

feature mitigating factors of its own.

If you want a mythal to last forever, dont make it corruptible;

if you want a quick and dirty mythal thats easier to raise, or

if you want to stretch to make your mythal as capable as pos-

sible, make it corruptible and plan on maintaining it once every

century or two.

Anchored:  An  anchored  mythal  is  reinforced  by  the  shape

and ow of the Weave in its immediate vicinity. Major changes

to its physical, magical, or spiritual environmentfor example,

the destruction of a city, the burning of a forest, or the presence

of a powerful and hostile outsider (one whose Hit Dice exceed

the mythals caster level and whose alignment opposes that of

the caster in any respect) for at least 24 hourscan damage the

mythal. A mythal integrity check (see Corruptible, above) is made

whenever such an anchor-damaging event takes place. See Table

211 for the effects of failure.

The Year of Oaths Forsaken

The  year  626  DR,  some  two  thousand  years  before  the

Year of Lightning Storms (1374 DR), was known as the Year

of Oaths Forsaken. In this era, Faern was dominated by a

number of mighty empires, almost all of which subsequently

fell. During the Year of Oaths Forsaken, Netheril neared the

peak of its power, Narfell and Raumathar battled for dominance

in the cold lands around Lake Ashane, Jhaamdath expanded

throughout the lands south of the Sea of Fallen Stars, and

modern Calimshan was arising from the old realm of Coram-

shan. Great elven realms such as Cormanthyr, Eaerlann, and

Illefarn still held sway over large portions of the world, and

the  great  dwarven  kingdoms  of  Ammarindar  and  Delzoun

still stood unbowed.

The following map offers a glimpse of Faern as it stood

in the Year of Oaths Forsaken. Netherils green elds had

not yet been swallowed by the sands of Anauroch, the old

forests of the North were larger than they are today, and

Jhaamdath had not yet been drowned by the high magic of

Nikerymath, but many other lands looked much the same

as they do today.

increments of 100% (to two hundred years, three hundred years,

or more) by applying the normal epic spell factor for increased

duration, at a cost of +2 to the DC per iteration. This factor is

applied after the 3/4 reduction to the DC for making the mythal

corruptible in the rst place.

Corruptible mythals are often maintained periodically through

the  use  of  epic  mythal  rejuvenation  spells  created  specically

for that purpose. The base DC for the rejuvenation spell equals

one-half that of the raise mythal spell that created the particular

mythal before mitigating factors were applied, though it may also

feature mitigating factors of its own.

If you want a mythal to last forever, dont make it corruptible;

if you want a quick and dirty mythal thats easier to raise, or

if you want to stretch to make your mythal as capable as pos-

sible, make it corruptible and plan on maintaining it once every

century or two.

Anchored:  An  anchored  mythal  is  reinforced  by  the  shape

and ow of the Weave in its immediate vicinity. Major changes

to its physical, magical, or spiritual environmentfor example,

the destruction of a city, the burning of a forest, or the presence

of a powerful and hostile outsider (one whose Hit Dice exceed

the mythals caster level and whose alignment opposes that of

the caster in any respect) for at least 24 hourscan damage the

mythal. A mythal integrity check (see Corruptible, above) is made

whenever such an anchor-damaging event takes place. See Table

211 for the effects of failure.

The Year of Oaths Forsaken

The  year  626  DR,  some  two  thousand  years  before  the

Year of Lightning Storms (1374 DR), was known as the Year

of Oaths Forsaken. In this era, Faern was dominated by a

number of mighty empires, almost all of which subsequently

fell. During the Year of Oaths Forsaken, Netheril neared the

peak of its power, Narfell and Raumathar battled for dominance

in the cold lands around Lake Ashane, Jhaamdath expanded

throughout the lands south of the Sea of Fallen Stars, and

modern Calimshan was arising from the old realm of Coram-

shan. Great elven realms such as Cormanthyr, Eaerlann, and

Illefarn still held sway over large portions of the world, and

the  great  dwarven  kingdoms  of  Ammarindar  and  Delzoun

still stood unbowed.

The following map offers a glimpse of Faern as it stood

in the Year of Oaths Forsaken. Netherils green elds had

not yet been swallowed by the sands of Anauroch, the old

forests of the North were larger than they are today, and

Jhaamdath had not yet been drowned by the high magic of

Nikerymath, but many other lands looked much the same

as they do today.

The Wards of Silverymoon

The wards of Silverymoon (see Silver Marches) is a fairly typi-

cal wizard mythal created in 843 DR by Elu Dualen (Alustriel

Silverhand) and several other wizards acting together.

The details of the wards are given on the table below. Unless

The total cost for the components is 353,400. Dividing this value

by 1,000 yields a Spellcraft DC modier of +353. Adding this

modier to the base Spellcraft DC of 25 brings the DC to 378.

The wards extend for 1,000 yards in all directions, increasing the

area of the emanation from 100 feet to 3,000 feet and adding

+116 to the DC. Thus, the total Spellcraft DC is 494.

Like most latter-day mythals, Silverymoons wards are both

anchored and corruptible, so the DC drops to 278 (3/4  3/4

 494). However, the increased duration factor was applied ten

times, so that Silverymoons wards would not begin to erode

for one thousand years from the time they were raised. Adding

+2  10 raises the DC to 298. This value means that creating

this  particular  raise  mythal  spell  requires  the  expenditure  of

2,682,000 gp and 107,280 XP, plus 49 days of research.

The mitigating factors for Silverymoons mythal include an

expenditure of 10,000 XP (100), plus the cooperation of three

additional wizards casting 9th-level spells (51), six additional

wizards casting 6th-level spells (66), and nine additional wiz-

ards casting 3rd-level spells (45), plus 5d6 points of backlash

damage (5). Applying these factors gives a nal Spellcraft DC

of 31an easily assured success for an epic-level wizard with

the proper feats and magic items.

the

Crown

Wars

I n the dim mists of Faerns past, long before the

rise of even the most ancient human or dwarven

kingdoms,  the  elves  founded  mighty  empires

across  the  length  and  breadth  of  Faern.  The  greatest  of

these empiresAryvandaar, Keltormir, Miyeritar, Illefarn,

Ilythiir,  and  Shantel  Othreiercoexisted  peacefully  for

thousands  of  years  before  greed,  envy,  and  pride  brought

them low. The series of vicious, bloody wars that destroyed

the  ancient  realms  of  the  elves  has  come  to  be  known  as

the Crown Wars.

The Crown Wars consisted of ve major campaignssome

of which happened concurrentlythat eventually involved all

the major elven civilizations. For three thousand years the elves

fought one another, tearing down most of what they had spent

millennia building and practicing fratricide on a scale unseen

before or since. In fact, one elf subrace became so twisted by

evil that its members were forever divorced from the light of

day. These elves, now known as drow, live underground to this

day, and their hatred for other elves remains as strong as it was

in those ancient times.

Although time has wiped away many of the great citadels

and  fortresses  built  before  and  during  the  Crown  Wars,  a

surprising number of them have survivedthough not neces-

sarily intactdue to magical preservation. A sense of awesome

agelessness pervades the ruins from this era, and anyone who

enters them knows instinctively that they are old beyond mea-

sure. Their architecture seems strange and almost alieneven

to modern-day elves. Many of these ruins also harbor lethal

magic  traps  capable  of  obliterating  not  only  intruders,  but

also the ruins themselves and a sizable chunk of countryside

surrounding them.

Finally, and perhaps most signicantly, the ruins from this

era serve as silent monuments to the tragic history of Faerns

elves. Historians and philosophers debate whether the Crown

Wars  were  the  impetus  for  the  many  subsequent  tragedies

that befell the elves, or whether they were merely the earliest

recorded example of that races propensity for disaster. Elf PCs

often feel a haunting sense of grief while exploring the ruins of

a Crown Wars fortress, as though the very stones were imbued

with deep sorrow, and even non-elf characters may feel subdued

or disquieted.

History

Much of the written history of the Crown Wars was lost in the

terrible battles that occurred at the close of the Fifth Campaign.

Elf sages in Evermeet, Evereska, and a few other bastions of

elven lore have charge of the few chronicles that remain.

Because the Crown Wars took place so long ago, the follow-

ing timeline represents only a rough estimate of the dates that

certain events occurred.

30,000 The War of the Seldarine begins. Araushnee is cast

and thrown down into the Nine Hells.

18,000  Some Ilythiiri houses discover Ghaunadaur and begin

venerating him in secret. In the centuries that follow,

rival Ilythiiri houses turn to other dark deities, such

as Lolth.

17,600  The Sundering occurs, and Evermeet is created with

elven  high  magic.  The  spell  reaches  both  back  and

forward in the mists of time.

17,100  The War of Three Leaves begins. Ilythiiri spies and

assassins incite Syrpiir, Thearnytaar, and Eiellr into

a three-sided conict to prevent them from unifying

into a single state.

Miyeritar  and  pressures  Shantel  Othreier  to  accept

Aryvandaaran occupation or suffer the same fate.

11,800  Aryvandaaran  forces  occupy  Miyeritar,  though  a

number of dark and sylvan elf clans continue to resist.

Many elves of Illefarn provide secret safe havens for

Miyeritari.

11,700  The  Second  Crown  War  begins.  Ilythiir  launches

surprise attacks against Orishaar, an ally of Aryvan-

daar.

11,600  The Ilythiiri burn Syrpiir to the ground.

Ilythiiri clan into her service. The church of Lolth

rises to prominence.

11,450  Thearnytaar and Eiellr invade Ilythiir. More than

half of their forces are slain by the corrupt, demon-

granted magic of the dark elves.

11,400  Eiellr is razed by Ilythiiri dark elves and traitorous

wild elves.

11,300  Miyeritar is conquered by Aryvandaar, thus ending

the First Crown War.

11,200  Thearnytaar falls to Ilythiiri forces utilizing domi-

nated monsters and undead creatures. Ilythiir begins

to skirmish with Keltormir.

10,900  Malkizid, the fallen solar, becomes the secret patron

of the Vyshaan lords. The Third Crown War begins.

Aryvandaar, now known as the Vyshaantar Empire,

invades Shantel Othreier.

10,700  An  orc  horde  falls  upon  the  embattled  armies  of

Aryvandaar  and  Shantel  Othreier  at  the  Battle  of

the  Gods  Theater.  Almost  seventy  thousand  elves

perish before Aryvandaar wins the day and occupies

northern Shantel Othreier.

10,600  Shantel  Othreier  is  conquered  by  the  Vyshaantar

Empire,  ending  the  Third  Crown  War.  Resistance

movements spring up in Miyeritar and Shantel Oth-

reier.

10,500  The Dark Disaster reduces Miyeritar to a dead waste-

land. The Crown Wars halt for a time while the elves

begin worshiping evil gods such as Ghaunadaur and

Lolth.

10,300  Keltormir withdraws its forces from eastern Keltormir,

holding its line at Highlands Edge.

10,270  With  Keltormirs  withdrawal,  the  Vyshaanti  and

10,110  Elf clerics and high mages in Illefarn begin a decades-

long prayer for salvation.

10,100  Ilythiir destroys Shantel Othreier.

10,000  The  Seldarine  respond  to  the  arcane  and  divine

high magic of the elves by smiting the Ilythiiri. All

dark  elves  are  transformed  into  drow  and  driven

underground,  thus  ending  the  Fourth  Crown  War.

The Seldarine summon elves of all other clans and

nations to the Elven Court to settle their differences

and restore peace.

9900  The Vyshaantar Empire annexes Illefarn. Persecution

of  high  mages  and  powerful  clerics  in  Vyshaantar

lands begins as the sun  elves seek to eliminate any

threats to their power.

9800  The Vyshaantar Empire occupies all the remaining

elven  realms  on  Faern  and  begins  colonization  of

Evermeet.

9600  The  rst drow civilizations make their presence known

by harassing their ancient enemies in the Vyshaantar

Empire.

9200  The Fifth Crown War begins when the Vyshaantar

Empire rebels against the proclamations of the Elven

Court, which direct the elves of Aryvandaar to repudi-

ate their Vyshaan rulers. Malkizid abandons House

Vyshaan and retreats to the infernal planes.

9000  The Fifth Crown War ends with the utter defeat of

the  Vyshaantar  Empire.  The  lands  of  Aryvandaar

are largely abandoned for an age.

Keepers of the Past

In elven communities such as Evermeet, the Fortress Home of

Evereska, and the remnants of the Elven Court in Cormanthyr,

the most basic lore of the Crown Wars is easily accessible in the

libraries and halls of learning. A great sage may know more

speci c details than those other lorekeepers can provide, such

as the location of a speci c city or fortress, but for the most

part, any elf with an interest in history can learn about the

Crown Wars with relative ease.

Dif culties often arise when members of other races seek this

same knowledge. The Crown Wars era is quite possibly the single

greatest shame in the history of the elf race, and the elves have

no desire to share the details with outsiders. Especially in sun

elf communities, non-elf researchers are frequently denied access

to information about the Crown Wars. As a result, the majority

of Faerns people believe that the Crown Wars were simply an

internal struggle for supremacy among the elf subraces.

PCs  wishing  to  research  the  Crown  Wars  are  likely  to

encounter  strong  resistance  unless  everyone  in  the  group  is

an elf. If a group that includes other races can demonstrate

a  pressing  need  for  the  informationsuch  as  an  imminent

threat to the elf race that might be averted by knowledge of

the Crown Warsthe sages may be more lenient; otherwise,

non-elf PCs must be creative in gaining the desired information.

able  to  steal  a  few  tomes  from  an  elven  library,  or  a  cleric

might attempt to bypass the elves altogether by requesting the

knowledge from her deity.

Songs and Stories

Because the Crown Wars took place so long ago, only limited

information is available about them today. The following tales

are well known in elf society, and most elves have at least a basic

knowledge of them. Members of other races or less educated

elf subraces (such as wild elves or nomadic wood elves) know

signi cantly less about the Crown Wars than the sun elves and

moon elves do.

THE BEGINNING

The First Crown War began as a seemingly minor debate over

territory and governance. Aryvandaaran historians had discov-

ered a link between the family of their ruler, Coronal Ivsaar

Vyshaan, and the Olrythii, the ruling house of Miyeritar. Always

ambitious, the members of House Vyshaan saw this connection

as the perfect excuse to claim rulership over Miyeritar. The dark

elves and wood elves of Miyeritar, a staunchly independent lot,

were not at all interested in being ruled by the haughty sun

elves.  After  several  centuries  of  negotiating,  bickering,  and

feuding  with  the  Olrythii,  the  Vyshaan  ran  out  of  patience,

marshaled their armies, and marched on Miyeritar, intending

to annex it by force since diplomacy had failed. Thus began the

First Crown War.

After two centuries of  ghting, Miyeritar was occupied by

the sun elves of Aryvandaar, though several dark and sylvan elf

clans continued to resist. The Vyshaanti did not bring Miyeritar

fully  under  their  control  until  approximately   ve  centuries

after  the  occupation.  Meanwhile,  supposedly  in  retaliation

for Aryvandaars aggression against the Miyeritari, the dark

elves of Ilythiir rose up and attacked their  nearest  enemies in

10,600  Shantel  Othreier  is  conquered  by  the  Vyshaantar

Empire,  ending  the  Third  Crown  War.  Resistance

movements spring up in Miyeritar and Shantel Oth-

10,500  The Dark Disaster reduces Miyeritar to a dead waste-

land. The Crown Wars halt for a time while the elves

reassess what they have done.

10,450  The Fourth Crown War begins. The Ilythiiri openly

begin worshiping evil gods such as Ghaunadaur and

Lolth.

10,300  Keltormir withdraws its forces from eastern Keltormir,

holding its line at Highlands Edge.

10,270  With  Keltormirs  withdrawal,  the  Vyshaanti  and

Ilythiiri come into direct con ict for the  rst time.

10,110  Elf clerics and high mages in Illefarn begin a decades-

10,000  The  Seldarine  respond  to  the  arcane  and  divine

high magic of the elves by smiting the Ilythiiri. All

dark  elves  are  transformed  into  drow  and  driven

underground,  thus  ending  the  Fourth  Crown  War.

The Seldarine summon elves of all other clans and

nations to the Elven Court to settle their differences

and restore peace.

9900  The Vyshaantar Empire annexes Illefarn. Persecution

of  high  mages  and  powerful  clerics  in  Vyshaantar

Court, which direct the elves of Aryvandaar to repudi-

ate their Vyshaan rulers. Malkizid abandons House

Vyshaan and retreats to the infernal planes.

9000  The Fifth Crown War ends with the utter defeat of

the  Vyshaantar  Empire.  The  lands  of  Aryvandaar

are largely abandoned for an age.

Keepers of the Past

In elven communities such as Evermeet, the Fortress Home of

Evereska, and the remnants of the Elven Court in Cormanthyr,

the most basic lore of the Crown Wars is easily accessible in the

libraries and halls of learning. A great sage may know more

speci c details than those other lorekeepers can provide, such

as the location of a speci c city or fortress, but for the most

part, any elf with an interest in history can learn about the

Crown Wars with relative ease.

Dif culties often arise when members of other races seek this

same knowledge. The Crown Wars era is quite possibly the single

greatest shame in the history of the elf race, and the elves have

no desire to share the details with outsiders. Especially in sun

elf communities, non-elf researchers are frequently denied access

to information about the Crown Wars. As a result, the majority

of Faerns people believe that the Crown Wars were simply an

internal struggle for supremacy among the elf subraces.

PCs  wishing  to  research  the  Crown  Wars  are  likely  to

encounter  strong  resistance  unless  everyone  in  the  group  is

an elf. If a group that includes other races can demonstrate

a  pressing  need  for  the  informationsuch  as  an  imminent

threat to the elf race that might be averted by knowledge of

the Crown Warsthe sages may be more lenient; otherwise,

non-elf PCs must be creative in gaining the desired information.

able  to  steal  a  few  tomes  from  an  elven  library,  or  a  cleric

knowledge from her deity.

Songs and Stories

Because the Crown Wars took place so long ago, only limited

information is available about them today. The following tales

are well known in elf society, and most elves have at least a basic

knowledge of them. Members of other races or less educated

elf subraces (such as wild elves or nomadic wood elves) know

signi cantly less about the Crown Wars than the sun elves and

moon elves do.

THE BEGINNING

The First Crown War began as a seemingly minor debate over

territory and governance. Aryvandaaran historians had discov-

ered a link between the family of their ruler, Coronal Ivsaar

Vyshaan, and the Olrythii, the ruling house of Miyeritar. Always

ambitious, the members of House Vyshaan saw this connection

as the perfect excuse to claim rulership over Miyeritar. The dark

elves and wood elves of Miyeritar, a staunchly independent lot,

were not at all interested in being ruled by the haughty sun

elves.  After  several  centuries  of  negotiating,  bickering,  and

feuding  with  the  Olrythii,  the  Vyshaan  ran  out  of  patience,

marshaled their armies, and marched on Miyeritar, intending

to annex it by force since diplomacy had failed. Thus began the

First Crown War.

After two centuries of  ghting, Miyeritar was occupied by

the sun elves of Aryvandaar, though several dark and sylvan elf

clans continued to resist. The Vyshaanti did not bring Miyeritar

fully  under  their  control  until  approximately   ve  centuries

after  the  occupation.  Meanwhile,  supposedly  in  retaliation

for Aryvandaars aggression against the Miyeritari, the dark

elves of Ilythiir rose up and attacked their  nearest  enemies in

THE CROWN WARS

THE CROWN WARS

the smaller kingdom of Orishaar. The stated premise for the

conict was weak, considering that the moon elves of Orishaar

had no connection with Aryvandaar beyond a trade alliance,

and the Ilythiiri had little to do with the beleaguered elves of

Miyeritar. Though it was initially seen as a thinly veiled excuse

for the Ilythiiri to seize some land from the moon elves, this

offensive continued to gain momentum and eventually escalated

to become the Second Crown War.

THE SECOND CROWN WAR

From The Saga of Woe, an ancient elven folk tale, author

unknown:

And when the folk of Ilythiir heard about the brutal attacks by

the sun elves of Aryvandaar against their northern kinfolk, a

shadow fell upon their hearts. The cunning dark elves claimed

this shadow was the result of grief and woe, and so skilled was

their  artice  that  all  were  tricked  by  it.  When  the  Ilythiiri

attacked Orishaar, the elves of all the empires believed that the

grief-stricken dark elves were simply lashing out in vengeance

on behalf of their cousins to the north.

But  the  shadow  upon  the  hearts  of  the  SsriTelQ uessir

stemmed not from grief, but from greed and envy. The shadow

wove its insidious tendrils about them and whispered to them

of  wicked  acts  and  fell  deeds.  To  their  own  damnation,  the

Ilythiiri heeded the council of the shadow and were drawn by

it into darkness.

Purportedly,  the  Second  Campaign  was  an  attempt  by  the

Ilythiiri to avenge their wronged cousins in Miyeritar, which

boasted the only other major enclave of dark elves on Faern.

Ilythiirs savage attack wiped out Thearnytaar, Eiellr, Syr-

piir,  and  Orishaar,  and  the  dark  elves  continued  to  conduct

brutal raids against the elves of Keltormir for the next twelve

hundred years.

It was during this campaign that the epithet dhaerow was

rst  used  to  describe  the  dark  elves  of  Ilythiir.  Depending

upon the intonation, inection, and context, dhaerow could be

translated as face of shadow, heart of night, traitor, or a

host of other, even less complimentary terms. One by one, the

great Ilythiiri houses sought to gain the power to conquer their

enemies from demonic patrons. Seeing an opportunity to subvert

an  entire  subrace  to  evil,  Lolth  sent  the  balor  Wendonai  to

Ilythiir. Wendonai successfully led House Sethomiir, the ruling

house of the Ilythiiri, into darkness by favoring Geirildin, its

coronal, with gifts of dark power. Other high Ilythiiri nobles

sought similar patronage, some because they envied the coronals

newfound power, others because they were determined to carve

out their own kingdoms from the wreckage of the neighboring

elven states.

Guided  by  their  demonic  patrons,  the  Ilythiiri  came  to

relish  warfare  and  torture  and  despise  elven  ideals.  Their

previous  justication  for  the  waravenging  their  northern

brothersbegan  to  ring  hollow  after  centuries  of  bloodshed

and butchery. Even the peaceful moon elves of Keltormir were

increasingly horried by their erstwhile brethrens actions and

began to arm themselves for a retaliatory strike at Ilythiir.

WENDONAI, BALOR SEDUCER

A rarity among his kind, the balor Wendonai prefers the subtle

art of corruption to the simple joy of destruction. When the

Ilythiiri  rst  began  to  practice  tainted  magic  and  worship

blasphemous gods, the Dark Seldarine of the Demonweb Pits

dispatched  Wendonai  to  answer  the  dark  elves  summons.

Wendonai took delight in showing the Ilythiiri the true nature

of corruption. Though it would be entirely too simple to say

that he was responsible for the fall of the Ilythiiri, his demonic

inuence  is  plain  in  the  barbarous  ferocity  of  the  Ilythiiris

attacks on their neighbors and kin.

After the fall of the Ilythiiri, Wendonai acted as advisor,

tutor, and occasionally consort to the Matron Mothers of the

most powerful drow families. His greatest success resulted in the

Dark Court Slaughter, an attack by duergar and drow against

the Elven Court around the year 4400 DR. But his efforts

to grow the Land under Shadow cost him the favor of Lolth

in 2549 DR, since the Spider Queen detested the idea of drow

returning to the Realms Above.

Thereafter, Wendonai allied himself with Eltab, Lord of

the Hidden Layer, and served as his emissary to Faern for

several centuries. Wendonai returned to Faern in 623 DR at

the command of a Nar demonbinderUna but was subsequently

banished from the continent for two thousand years by an epic

spell cast by a cleric of Horus-Re. Now, with only three years

left  in  his  term  of  banishment,  Wendonai  looks  forward  to

his glorious return, and he has already set plans in motion to

exact revenge against the God-Kings of Mulhorand and their

followers.

Wendonai  is  a  unique  balor  who  has  taken  levels  in  the

end  of  corruption  prestige  class  (see  Fiend  Folio).  He  pos-

sesses charm monster as a spell-like ability (usable at will) in

addition to the normal spell-like abilities of a balor and a end

of corruption.

Death  Throes  (Ex):  When  killed,  Wendonai  explodes  in

a blinding ash of light that deals 100 points of damage to

anything within 100 feet (Reex DC 32 half). This explosion

automatically destroys any weapons Wendonai is holding.

Entangle (Ex): Wendonais +1 flaming whip entangles foes

much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points

and needs no folding. If it hits, the target and Wendonai im-

mediately make opposed Strength checks; if Wendonai wins,

he drags the target against his aming body (see below). The

target  remains  anchored  against  Wendonais  body  until  it

escapes the whip.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy (DC 27), charm

Summon  Tanarri  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  Wendonai  can

automatically  summon  4d10  dretches,  1d4  hezrous,  or  one

nalfeshnee,  glabrezu,  marilith,  or  balor.  This  ability  is  the

equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Vorpal  Sword  (Su):  Wendonai  carries  a  +2  keen  vorpal

longsword that looks like a wavy ame.

Alternate Form (Su): Wendonai can assume any humanoid

form of Small to Large size as a standard action. This ability

functions like the polymorph spell, except that it allows only

humanoid forms.

Grant Wish (Sp): Once per day, Wendonai can grant a wish to

a mortal (not an elemental, outsider, or nonliving creature).

Fiendish Graft: Once per month, Wendonai can bestow a

endish graft; see Appendix 2 of the Fiend Folio for details.

Fiends  Favor  (Su):  Once  per  day,  Wendonai  can  grant  a

touched creature a +3 bonus to one ability score that lasts for 24

hours. When the effect expires, the creature takes a 3 penalty

to the same score for the next 24 hours.

Flaming Body (Su): Wendonais body is wreathed in ame.

Anyone grappling him takes 6d6 points of re damage each

round.

Mind Shielding (Su): Wendonai is immune to detect thoughts,

discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern alignment.

Soul Bargain (Su): Wendonai can enter into a binding agree-

ment with a mortal at the cost of the latters soul.

Temptation (Su): Wendonai can offer a good creature the

opportunity to change its alignment to evil. This ability works

like the temptation function of the atonement spell.

True Seeing (Su): Wendonai has a continuous true seeing

ability, as the spell (caster level 20th).

Possessions: +1 aming whip.

THE THIRD CROWN WAR:

THE DARK DISASTER

In about 10,900 DR, the fallen solar Malkizid became the

secret patron of the Vyshaantar high mages and taught them

many terrible secrets of high magic. While the Second Crown

War continued to rage in the south, Aryvandaar (now known

as  the  Vyshaantar  Empire)  attempted  to  annex  the  sun  elf

and  moon  elf  kingdom  of  Shantel  Othreier,  thus  beginning

the Third Crown War.

The elves of Shantel Othreier resisted Aryvandaars attacks

for three centuries, but with the sudden, mysterious death of Yn-

loeth, their coronal, they nally surrendered and diplomatically

joined the Vyshaantar Empire, thus ending the Third Crown

War.

About a century thereafter, a horrid magical storm known

as the Dark Disaster laid waste to Miyeritar. History (as written

by the victors of the Third Crown War) says that Miyeritars

attempts to stop Aryvandaars armies caused the Dark Disaster.

In truth, the fell magic that produced it was called forth by

Vyshaantar  high  mages  and  proceeded  unopposed  because  a

Vyshaantar  assassination  campaign  had  destroyed  many  of

Miyeritars high mages in the months before. The Dark Di-

saster hung over Miyeritar like a funeral shroud for months,

and when its cloying mists and bloody rains nally dissipated,

the once-proud forest had been reduced to a blasted, poisonous

wasteland. Although many of Miyeritars original inhabitants

had ed long before the killing storm hit, innumerable innocents

died horribly. Even today, the High Moor still stands desolate,

its interior dotted with the ruins of the once-proud kingdom

of Miyeritar. Only a few elves versed in historymostly high

mages and high priestsknow that most of Miyeritars sur-

viving mages gave their lives in a now-lost ritual designed to

preserve Miyeritars legacy, in the hope that her light would

someday rise again from the kingdoms ashes.

THE FOURTH CROWN WAR: THE DESCENT

The destruction of Miyeritar enraged the Ilythiiri, who right-

fully blamed Aryvandaar for the Dark Disaster. In the wake

of  the  killing  storm,  the  Ilythiiri  turned  their  high  magic

fully  to  the  pursuits  of  war,  and  the  result  was  devastation

on an unparalleled scale. Within four decades after the Dark

Disaster, the Ilythiiri utterly destroyed the realm of Shantel

Othreierthe  closest  outpost  of  Vyshaantar  power.  In  the

words of the Song of the Sundered Crown, Ilythiiri high mages

called stones from the sky, and caused the earth to boil and

the trees to scream. Refugees from the doomed kingdom of

Shantel Othreier told tales of Ilythiiri atrocities that made the

actions of the Aryvandaar for the past several centuries seem

tame by comparison.

In  the  face  of  this  savage  assault,  the  remaining  elven

kingdoms gathered in a great conclave and made a decision that

would  haunt  elvenkind  foreverthe  Ilythiiri,  or  dhaerow,

would be cast out of Corellons favor and divorced for all time

from their brethren. The most powerful high mages and clerics

of the Seldarine joined together to perform a ritual that altered

the Ilythiiris bodies to match the corruption of their souls.

returning to the Realms Above.

Thereafter, Wendonai allied himself with Eltab, Lord of

the Hidden Layer, and served as his emissary to Faern for

several centuries. Wendonai returned to Faern in 623 DR at

the command of a Nar demonbinderUna but was subsequently

banished from the continent for two thousand years by an epic

spell cast by a cleric of Horus-Re. Now, with only three years

left  in  his  term  of  banishment,  Wendonai  looks  forward  to

his glorious return, and he has already set plans in motion to

exact revenge against the God-Kings of Mulhorand and their

followers.

Wendonai  is  a  unique  balor  who  has  taken  levels  in  the

end  of  corruption  prestige  class  (see  Fiend  Folio).  He  pos-

sesses charm monster as a spell-like ability (usable at will) in

addition to the normal spell-like abilities of a balor and a end

of corruption.

Death  Throes  (Ex):  When  killed,  Wendonai  explodes  in

a blinding ash of light that deals 100 points of damage to

anything within 100 feet (Reex DC 32 half). This explosion

automatically destroys any weapons Wendonai is holding.

Entangle (Ex): Wendonais +1 flaming whip entangles foes

much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points

and needs no folding. If it hits, the target and Wendonai im-

mediately make opposed Strength checks; if Wendonai wins,

he drags the target against his aming body (see below). The

target  remains  anchored  against  Wendonais  body  until  it

escapes the whip.

automatically  summon  4d10  dretches,  1d4  hezrous,  or  one

nalfeshnee,  glabrezu,  marilith,  or  balor.  This  ability  is  the

equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Vorpal  Sword  (Su):  Wendonai  carries  a  +2  keen  vorpal

longsword that looks like a wavy ame.

Alternate Form (Su): Wendonai can assume any humanoid

form of Small to Large size as a standard action. This ability

functions like the polymorph spell, except that it allows only

humanoid forms.

Grant Wish (Sp): Once per day, Wendonai can grant a wish to

a mortal (not an elemental, outsider, or nonliving creature).

Fiendish Graft: Once per month, Wendonai can bestow a

endish graft; see Appendix 2 of the Fiend Folio for details.

Fiends  Favor  (Su):  Once  per  day,  Wendonai  can  grant  a

like the temptation function of the atonement spell.

True Seeing (Su): Wendonai has a continuous true seeing

ability, as the spell (caster level 20th).

Possessions: +1 aming whip.

THE THIRD CROWN WAR:

THE DARK DISASTER

In about 10,900 DR, the fallen solar Malkizid became the

secret patron of the Vyshaantar high mages and taught them

many terrible secrets of high magic. While the Second Crown

War continued to rage in the south, Aryvandaar (now known

as  the  Vyshaantar  Empire)  attempted  to  annex  the  sun  elf

and  moon  elf  kingdom  of  Shantel  Othreier,  thus  beginning

the Third Crown War.

The elves of Shantel Othreier resisted Aryvandaars attacks

for three centuries, but with the sudden, mysterious death of Yn-

loeth, their coronal, they nally surrendered and diplomatically

joined the Vyshaantar Empire, thus ending the Third Crown

War.

About a century thereafter, a horrid magical storm known

as the Dark Disaster laid waste to Miyeritar. History (as written

by the victors of the Third Crown War) says that Miyeritars

attempts to stop Aryvandaars armies caused the Dark Disaster.

In truth, the fell magic that produced it was called forth by

Vyshaantar  high  mages  and  proceeded  unopposed  because  a

Vyshaantar  assassination  campaign  had  destroyed  many  of

Miyeritars high mages in the months before. The Dark Di-

saster hung over Miyeritar like a funeral shroud for months,

and when its cloying mists and bloody rains nally dissipated,

the once-proud forest had been reduced to a blasted, poisonous

wasteland. Although many of Miyeritars original inhabitants

had ed long before the killing storm hit, innumerable innocents

died horribly. Even today, the High Moor still stands desolate,

its interior dotted with the ruins of the once-proud kingdom

of Miyeritar. Only a few elves versed in historymostly high

mages and high priestsknow that most of Miyeritars sur-

viving mages gave their lives in a now-lost ritual designed to

preserve Miyeritars legacy, in the hope that her light would

someday rise again from the kingdoms ashes.

THE FOURTH CROWN WAR: THE DESCENT

The destruction of Miyeritar enraged the Ilythiiri, who right-

fully blamed Aryvandaar for the Dark Disaster. In the wake

of  the  killing  storm,  the  Ilythiiri  turned  their  high  magic

fully  to  the  pursuits  of  war,  and  the  result  was  devastation

on an unparalleled scale. Within four decades after the Dark

Disaster, the Ilythiiri utterly destroyed the realm of Shantel

Othreierthe  closest  outpost  of  Vyshaantar  power.  In  the

words of the Song of the Sundered Crown, Ilythiiri high mages

called stones from the sky, and caused the earth to boil and

the trees to scream. Refugees from the doomed kingdom of

Shantel Othreier told tales of Ilythiiri atrocities that made the

actions of the Aryvandaar for the past several centuries seem

tame by comparison.

In  the  face  of  this  savage  assault,  the  remaining  elven

kingdoms gathered in a great conclave and made a decision that

would  haunt  elvenkind  foreverthe  Ilythiiri,  or  dhaerow,

would be cast out of Corellons favor and divorced for all time

from their brethren. The most powerful high mages and clerics

of the Seldarine joined together to perform a ritual that altered

the Ilythiiris bodies to match the corruption of their souls.

54

THE CROWN WARS

THE CROWN WARS

Although  the  conclave  had  intended  to  punish  only  the

Ilythiiri, the ritual altered all the dark elves of Faern except

those who had already altered their own forms. The corrupted

dark  elves  were  then  driven  underground  by  the  combined

might of the united elven nations. This event, known as the

Descent, mirrored the fall of Lolth and her offspring from the

Seldarine and thus helped to seal the new elf subraces loyalty

to the Spider Queen. The word dhaerowwhich once meant

traitorwas likewise corrupted to drow, which became the

name of the corrupted dark elves.

Why all dark elves, and not just the Ilythiiri, were trans-

formed into drow remains one of the enduring mysteries of the

Descent. Some of the more humble elf theologians believe it

was an unintended consequence of the sort that always seems to

occur when the Fair Folk overreach themselves in the applica-

tion of high magic. In their eyes, the disastrous sundering of

Evermeet from Faern, the Dark Disaster, and the destruction

of Jhaamdath fall into that same category.

THE FIFTH CROWN WAR:

ARYVANDAARS FALL

The Fourth Crown War and the Descent that ended it were

spiritually  debilitating  events  that  forced  the  surface  elves

into a tenuous peace. At the apparent insistence of Corellon

Larethian  himself,  more  than  one  hundred  representatives

were selected from each of the elf subraces except the drow.

These elves, chosen from all stations and walks of life, were

transported to a forest in the east that was far removed from

conicts, political and otherwise, so that they could debate the

cause of their divisiveness and strife. This place, established in

Corellons name as a place of decision and judgment, became

known as the Elven Court.

During this time of judgment, many elves displaced by the

Crown Wars set off to search for the near-mythical realm of

Evermeet,  a  land  far  away  from  the  other  elven  kingdoms

that remained untouched by the ravages of the Crown Wars.

Answering a call from deep within their souls, they followed

a trail into the west that they could sense but not see. Upon

reaching the coast, they built ships and sailed them into the

uncharted western seas, where they at last found Evermeet.

Much to their surprise, Evermeet had already been an elven

homeland for quite some time. Not even the wild elves native to

the island could say how long they had been here. Ultimately,

the elves decided that the highest houses of Aryvandaar would

settle the isle and do their best to civilize it until a coronal

could arrive to claim governance over it.

Meanwhile, after nearly a millennium of debate, the elves of the

Elven Court judged the sun elf clan of Vyshaan, the ruling house

of Aryvandaar and the Vyshaantar Empire, to be the root cause

of the strife and suffering of the Crown Wars. The punishment

proposed for the Vyshaan was severethey were to be stripped of

their rulership and their nobility, and their lives would be declared

forfeit for their crimes against elvenkind. But the spies that the

Vyshaanti had planted among the representatives at the Elven

Court had forewarned them of the decision, allowing the clan to

marshal its forces for active resistance.

The Fifth Crown War began as recklessly as the four before

it had. At the behest of Malkizid, the mad king Giilvas Vyshaan

ordered the murder of all the wizards and high mages who stood

against him, counting on his high mage sons and brothers to

protect  the  clan.  The  troops  and  supporters  of  the  Vyshaan

were quite loyal, but even they could not hope to stand against

the combined power of all the other elvesespecially with the

power  of  Corellon  Larethians  mandate  behind  them.  Even

Malkizid saw that victory for the Vyshaanti was impossible,

so he returned to the Nine Hells, abandoning the sun elves to

their fate. The Fifth Crown War lasted only two hundred years

before the obvious madness of the Vyshaan lords compelled even

their most ardent followers to abandon their cause. Without

the support of their elf allies and their infernal patron, the

elves of the Vyshaan clan were slowly but inexorably crushed

by the allied forces of the remaining elven kingdoms. Rumors

and dark tales tell of four Sons of Vyshaan who escaped the

destruction of their clan and ed west to await a time when

they could return to Faern in triumph, at the head of a new

Vyshaantar Empire. Serious scholars and sages, however, usually

dismiss such tales as pure ction.

The Crown Wars nally drew to a close some three thousand

years after the march of the Vyshaan clan rst ignited the strife

among the elven kingdoms. The elves of current-day Faern

rarely speak of this time of madness even among themselves, let

alone in the presence of non-elves. However, a few remnants of

that period survive in the Elven language. To this day, vyshaan

is a vile curse and an insult nearly as potent as calling an elf

dhaerow.

Important Sites

Although the long march of years has buried the majority of

the locations important to this period of history, a few scattered

ruins remain, especially in the High Forest and on the High

Moorthe sites of the former kingdoms of Aryvandaar and

Miyeritar, respectively. Other sites may also remain, buried deep

in  forgotten  forests  and  unexplored  dales,  perhaps  magically

preserved against decay.

Ruins from the Crown Wars era are treasure troves of vastly

powerful artifacts and magic. This section presents overviews

of several such sites, broken down by kingdom. The locations

of these sites are deliberately imprecise so that DMs can drop

them into convenient spots in their campaigns.

Aryvandaar

The  proud  sun  elf  kingdom  of  Aryvandaar  once  stretched

from the present bounds of the High Forest in the east to the

banks of the River Dessarin. In the days of the Crown Wars,

this whole region was solid forest.

Current-day historians portray the elves of Aryvandaar as a

haughty lot who believed themselves superior to all other elves

and vastly superior to non-elves. The Vyshaan clan, Aryvandaars

ruling house, constructed many enormous fortresses and citadels

for the war effort, as well as several cities so beautiful that even

the most jaded and cynical elf would weep for joy at the sight of

them. Their magic produced impossibly slender spires of stone

and crystal, stonework so ne and intricate it resembled lace,

and  perfectly  smooth,  seamless  construction.  Many  of  these

features are still visible in Aryvandaaran ruins.

ARKRYM (GREAT SWORD)

This  small  outpost  at  the  border  between  Aryvandaar  and

Miyeritar experienced rapid growth in the early years of the

First Crown War because it served as one of the principal stag-

ing points for the invasion of Miyeritar. The preserving magics

that had kept the citadel whole for centuries nally failed about

ve thousand years ago, and Arkrym is now little more than

a  tangled  mess  of  collapsed  walls  and  broken-topped  towers.

Based on the apparent age of the ruins, many sages mistakenly

assume the town to be an outpost of Sharrven.

The Vyshaanti stripped many treasures from the site during

their nal stand in the Fifth Crown War, and other elves looted

more of them after the eradication of the Vyshaan clan. Still

others were claimed by the various monsters that laired in the

ruins over the intervening millennia. However, a few chambers

that were sealed with powerful magical traps (at least CR 16)

still contain relics of the warsmostly weapons, armor, and

spellbooks. The ruins have been uninhabited since the last oc-

cupant (a beholder) was slain by a party of adventurers from

Silverymoon.

SHAALKAR MANOR

This site was named for Ealar Shaalkar, the elf explorer who

discovered it. No record of its original name has ever been found.

Historians believe that Shaalkar Manor was once the manor

house of a particularly inuential sun elf noble, though not a

member of the Vyshaan clan.

The aboveground structure is gone except for a few low walls

and the broken remnants of a path that might have once wound

through  a  garden.  The  mausoleum  on  the  grounds  appears

untouched by the ravages of time, and in fact it is less than a

decade old. A group of Evereskan tomb guardians, upon hearing

about the discovery of Shaalkar Manor, traveled to the site to

see whether any tombs lay underground. They discovered the

familial crypts but were unable to excavate more than one level

because of certain strange magical wards and curses they could

neither detect nor counter. After losing ve of their number,

the tomb guardians withdrew, constructed the mausoleum over

the excavated shaft to shelter the dead, and promptly circulated

orders to all the elven strongholds on Faern that this tomb

was to be left strictly alone.

Recently, adventurers have begun to wonder why the tomb

guardians would go to that much effort just to keep people

away from a tiny familial crypt in the middle of nowhere.

A few groups have ventured to the site to see whether more

than just bizarre magical traps might be buried down there,

but none have succeeded in opening any more sections of the

tombs to date.

Illefarn

Illefarn prospered the longest of all the elven kingdoms of the

Crown Wars era. A mighty nation that was said to rival Corman-

thyr at its height, Illefarn controlled much of the Sword Coast

during its heyday. About 1100 DR, the moon elf and sun elf

citizens of Illefarn abandoned their kingdom and traveled west

to Evermeet. Various ruins scattered up and down the Sword

Coast give mute evidence of the scope of ancient Illefarns rule,

but they provide few clues about the lives of its people.

Much confusion surrounds the legacies of ancient Illefarn

because  two  different  realms  actually  bore  that  name.  The

second  Illefarn  was  a  weak  alliance  between  the  moon  elves

of the Ardeep and the shield dwarves of Dardath, formed at

the Council of Illefarn in 342 DR. This second realm was a

short-lived state that preceded the founding of Phalorm, the

Realm of Three Crowns, and it bore little resemblance to the

mighty elven realm of old.

CRYPTS OF AELINTHALDAAR

Aelinthaldaar,  the  capital  city  of  Illefarn,  once  stood  where

Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, stands today. Founded about

8,500 DR, the city was razed by high magic in 1100 DR

by order of Illefarns coronal, just before the citizens departed

for Evermeet.

Because no ruins were left behind, little is known of this

ancient  city.  The  only  traces  of  Aelinthaldaar  that  remain

today  are  the  crypts  beneath  Waterdeeps  Pantheon  Temple

and a high magic effect that still persists within the cityand

both are closely guarded secrets known only to the Fair Folk

of Waterdeep. The crypts contain fell weapons captured from

the armies of Aryvandaar, and the high magic ward prevents

the  citys  plateau  from  collapsing  or  settling,  thus  keeping

whole  districts  of  the  City  of  Splendors  from  sinking  into

Undermountain.

SONG PATHS

Among Illefarns enduring legacies are the song paths of its

poet-mages.  These  individuals  created  vast  portal  networks

linked to songs and poems of epic length. These networks could

be  activated  by  walking  over  certain  enchanted  stones  while

singing the songs used to create them. Many such song paths

linked outposts and hidden glades in Illefarns vast forests, and

together they spanned most of the Sword Coast North.

Most  of  the  song  paths  were  disabled  shortly  before  the

Retreat  to  Evermeet,  but  at  least  one  still  remains  because

the elf noble who was to disenchant it could not bear to do so.

Instead, he took with him all available copies of the poetic work

that activated the portal system and separated it into smaller

parts, so that no whole version of it remained in existence.

This  song  path,  called  Voices  of  the  Lost  after  the  song

that activated it, lies along the River Delimbiyr. It connects

Although  the  conclave  had  intended  to  punish  only  the

Ilythiiri, the ritual altered all the dark elves of Faern except

those who had already altered their own forms. The corrupted

dark  elves  were  then  driven  underground  by  the  combined

that period survive in the Elven language. To this day, vyshaan

is a vile curse and an insult nearly as potent as calling an elf

dhaerow.

Important Sites

Although the long march of years has buried the majority of

the locations important to this period of history, a few scattered

ruins remain, especially in the High Forest and on the High

Moorthe sites of the former kingdoms of Aryvandaar and

Miyeritar, respectively. Other sites may also remain, buried deep

in  forgotten  forests  and  unexplored  dales,  perhaps  magically

preserved against decay.

Ruins from the Crown Wars era are treasure troves of vastly

powerful artifacts and magic. This section presents overviews

of several such sites, broken down by kingdom. The locations

of these sites are deliberately imprecise so that DMs can drop

them into convenient spots in their campaigns.

Aryvandaar

The  proud  sun  elf  kingdom  of  Aryvandaar  once  stretched

from the present bounds of the High Forest in the east to the

banks of the River Dessarin. In the days of the Crown Wars,

this whole region was solid forest.

Current-day historians portray the elves of Aryvandaar as a

haughty lot who believed themselves superior to all other elves

and vastly superior to non-elves. The Vyshaan clan, Aryvandaars

ruling house, constructed many enormous fortresses and citadels

for the war effort, as well as several cities so beautiful that even

the most jaded and cynical elf would weep for joy at the sight of

them. Their magic produced impossibly slender spires of stone

and crystal, stonework so ne and intricate it resembled lace,

and  perfectly  smooth,  seamless  construction.  Many  of  these

features are still visible in Aryvandaaran ruins.

ARKRYM (GREAT SWORD)

This  small  outpost  at  the  border  between  Aryvandaar  and

Miyeritar experienced rapid growth in the early years of the

First Crown War because it served as one of the principal stag-

ing points for the invasion of Miyeritar. The preserving magics

that had kept the citadel whole for centuries nally failed about

ve thousand years ago, and Arkrym is now little more than

a  tangled  mess  of  collapsed  walls  and  broken-topped  towers.

Based on the apparent age of the ruins, many sages mistakenly

assume the town to be an outpost of Sharrven.

The Vyshaanti stripped many treasures from the site during

their nal stand in the Fifth Crown War, and other elves looted

more of them after the eradication of the Vyshaan clan. Still

others were claimed by the various monsters that laired in the

ruins over the intervening millennia. However, a few chambers

that were sealed with powerful magical traps (at least CR 16)

still contain relics of the warsmostly weapons, armor, and

spellbooks. The ruins have been uninhabited since the last oc-

cupant (a beholder) was slain by a party of adventurers from

Silverymoon.

SHAALKAR MANOR

This site was named for Ealar Shaalkar, the elf explorer who

discovered it. No record of its original name has ever been found.

Historians believe that Shaalkar Manor was once the manor

house of a particularly inuential sun elf noble, though not a

member of the Vyshaan clan.

The aboveground structure is gone except for a few low walls

and the broken remnants of a path that might have once wound

through  a  garden.  The  mausoleum  on  the  grounds  appears

untouched by the ravages of time, and in fact it is less than a

decade old. A group of Evereskan tomb guardians, upon hearing

about the discovery of Shaalkar Manor, traveled to the site to

see whether any tombs lay underground. They discovered the

familial crypts but were unable to excavate more than one level

because of certain strange magical wards and curses they could

neither detect nor counter. After losing ve of their number,

the tomb guardians withdrew, constructed the mausoleum over

the excavated shaft to shelter the dead, and promptly circulated

orders to all the elven strongholds on Faern that this tomb

was to be left strictly alone.

Recently, adventurers have begun to wonder why the tomb

guardians would go to that much effort just to keep people

away from a tiny familial crypt in the middle of nowhere.

A few groups have ventured to the site to see whether more

than just bizarre magical traps might be buried down there,

but none have succeeded in opening any more sections of the

tombs to date.

Illefarn

Illefarn prospered the longest of all the elven kingdoms of the

Crown Wars era. A mighty nation that was said to rival Corman-

thyr at its height, Illefarn controlled much of the Sword Coast

during its heyday. About 1100 DR, the moon elf and sun elf

citizens of Illefarn abandoned their kingdom and traveled west

to Evermeet. Various ruins scattered up and down the Sword

Coast give mute evidence of the scope of ancient Illefarns rule,

but they provide few clues about the lives of its people.

Much confusion surrounds the legacies of ancient Illefarn

because  two  different  realms  actually  bore  that  name.  The

second  Illefarn  was  a  weak  alliance  between  the  moon  elves

of the Ardeep and the shield dwarves of Dardath, formed at

the Council of Illefarn in 342 DR. This second realm was a

short-lived state that preceded the founding of Phalorm, the

Realm of Three Crowns, and it bore little resemblance to the

mighty elven realm of old.

CRYPTS OF AELINTHALDAAR

Aelinthaldaar,  the  capital  city  of  Illefarn,  once  stood  where

Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, stands today. Founded about

8,500 DR, the city was razed by high magic in 1100 DR

by order of Illefarns coronal, just before the citizens departed

for Evermeet.

Because no ruins were left behind, little is known of this

ancient  city.  The  only  traces  of  Aelinthaldaar  that  remain

today  are  the  crypts  beneath  Waterdeeps  Pantheon  Temple

and a high magic effect that still persists within the cityand

both are closely guarded secrets known only to the Fair Folk

of Waterdeep. The crypts contain fell weapons captured from

the armies of Aryvandaar, and the high magic ward prevents

the  citys  plateau  from  collapsing  or  settling,  thus  keeping

whole  districts  of  the  City  of  Splendors  from  sinking  into

Undermountain.

SONG PATHS

Among Illefarns enduring legacies are the song paths of its

poet-mages.  These  individuals  created  vast  portal  networks

linked to songs and poems of epic length. These networks could

be  activated  by  walking  over  certain  enchanted  stones  while

singing the songs used to create them. Many such song paths

linked outposts and hidden glades in Illefarns vast forests, and

together they spanned most of the Sword Coast North.

Most  of  the  song  paths  were  disabled  shortly  before  the

Retreat  to  Evermeet,  but  at  least  one  still  remains  because

the elf noble who was to disenchant it could not bear to do so.

Instead, he took with him all available copies of the poetic work

that activated the portal system and separated it into smaller

parts, so that no whole version of it remained in existence.

This  song  path,  called  Voices  of  the  Lost  after  the  song

that activated it, lies along the River Delimbiyr. It connects

THE CROWN WARS

THE CROWN WARS

a spot near Daggerford, a hilltop near the con uence of the

rivers  Delimbiyr  and  Hark,  a  tiny  island  at  the  top  of  the

Shining Falls, the ruin known as Elven Port, the headwaters

of the Delimbiyr in the Talons, and a submerged rock in the

shallows off the coast of the Lizard Marsh (which was part of

the mainland when the song path was made).

Ilythiir

Even the Vyshaanti were never as

reviled by their fellow elves as the

dark, monstrous Ilythiiri. The cur-

rent-day drow bear their ancestors

no  great  love,  primarily  because

the  Ilythiiri  serve  as  reminders

of just how far the dark elves have

fallen. Because of the hatred that all

other elves have borne the Ilythiiri

through  the  millennia,  fewer

ruins remain from Ilythiir than

from any other kingdom of the

Crown Wars era. Most of those

that  have  survived  are  twisted

places of darkness and evil built

shortly before the Descent. How

these  sites  have  survived  to  the

present  day  remains  a  mystery,

though  some  suggest  that  they

were  preserved  by  Lolth  herself,

or  by  one  of  the  other  drow

gods  with  a  perverse  sense  of

humor.

ATHAMAULT

(THE IRON PIT)

Built  during  the  Second  Crown

War,  the  Iron  Pit  was  one  of  the

greatest  Ilythiiri  fortresses.  A

labyrinthine  series  of  tunnels,

dungeons,  and  catacombs  near

what  is  now  the  Lake  of  Steam,

Athamault was one of the  rst subterranean

structures that the dark elves built. Had the

other elf subraces known about it at the time, they would have

taken its existence as a sure sign of the Ilythiiris descent into

madness and evil.

In the underground alchemical laboratories of Athamault,

the Ilythiiri created twisted monstrosities and researched unholy

spells of such vile nature that even the drow of today hesitate

to  use  them.  The  surface  elves  never  found  Athamault,  and

although the early drow carried off as many of its treasures as

they could, many dark and powerful secrets still lie hidden in

its forgotten vaults.

CITADEL OF SLIME

Though its name conjures images of a forti ed castle, the Citadel

of Slime is actually nothing more than a fetid cave. Shaped

by degenerate Ilythiiri into a form they believed suitable for a

temple to Ghaunadar, the citadel was used for horri c ritual

sacri ces of enemy captives during the Crown Wars.

Because  of  its  isolated  underground  locale,  this  cave  re-

mains relatively well preserved, though it is still

infested with slimes and oozes. In

recent years, a cabal of heretical

drow  dedicated  to  the  worship

of  Ghaunadar  has  taken  up

residence  here.  No  known

relics  from  the  Crown  Wars

era  remain  in  the  citadel,  but

intrepid (and strong-stomached)

adventurers  might  be  able  to

seize  the  treasures  brought  here

by its current inhabitants.

Miyeritar

Quite a few ruins from the era of

the Crown Wars have survived on

the High Moor, thanks in part to

the areas transformation into an

all-but-uninhabitable wasteland. Its

population of vicious monsters and

the devastating effects of the Dark

Disaster have ensured that most of

those sites remain desolate, empty

ruins of interest only to the most

avid scholars. Nevertheless, a few

sites  still  retain  some  vestige  of

their former power.

KRAANFHAORS DOOR

Located  about  100  miles  due

south of Secomber, this depres-

sion in the High Moor marks

the former site of the Citadel of

Kraanfhaor,  one  of  Miyeritars

greatest  wizard  schools.  Today,  all  that

remains of the citadel is a series of gulches

and half-buried walls. A small cave on the western side of the

dell  leads  into  a  cavern  complex  carved  out  by  centuries  of

running water.

A remnant of Miyeritar still lingers here despite centuries

of infrequent occupation by bugbears and leucrottas. Within

the eastern potion of the cavern complex stands an ornately

decorated  stone  door.  The  carving,  done  in  the  style  of  the

Miyeritari, depicts several elf spellcasters working magic with

dragons. Many have tried to uncover the secret of Kraanfhaors

Door, but no one has yet found a way to open it, and all at-

A wizard studies Kraanfhaors Door

tempts to burrow into the chamber beyond it have failed. Some

believe that the great library of Kraanfhaor may still stand

behind this door, and  nding it would unlock many secrets of

elven high magic.

enough  to  deal  with  such  an  epic  threat,  decrease  his  levels

enough to make his CR appropriate and simply omit his high

mage status from the description.

Legacies of the

Crown Wars

Though they are ancient history even to the elves, the Crown

Wars left an indelible legacy on the face of Faern. They in-

 uenced every aspect of the continents development, from its

geography (via the destruction of Miyeritar and the subsequent

creation of the High Moor) to the social (the Descent of the

Ilythiiri and the birth of the drow). This section discusses ways

that the DM can incorporate these legacies into the campaign

using adventure seeds and some ancient, forgotten legacies of

the Crown Wars.

Adventure Seeds

Apart  from  the  obvious  explore  the  ancient  ruins  to   nd

treasure  plotline,  any  number  of  ways  exist  to  incorporate

aspects  of  the  Crown  Wars  into  current-day  campaigns.  For

example, an adventure can be set in some ancient ruins, or the

history of these ancient elven con icts can be woven into the

campaigns overall plot.

THE FOUR SONS

Pirates have been harassing elven ships traveling to and from

Evermeet.  This  situation  is  unusual  enough  in  and  of  itself,

since pirates rarely attack elven vessels for fear they might be

carrying  high  mages  or  other  powerful  spellcasters.  Further

examination  of  the  circumstances  reveals  some  even  more

unsettling information. The pirates have been sailing ships of

elven make and  ying  ags bearing an unusual heraldic device

that sages recognize as the emblem of the Vyshaantar Empire.

Are  these  pirates  the  four  sons  of  Vyshaan  alluded  to  in

the ancient elven legends and prophecies, or are they simply

charlatans hoping to capitalize on superstition and fear?

VENGEANCE FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE

Shortly before the fall of Shantar Othreier, a powerful moon

elf high mage foresaw his nations inevitable defeat and placed

himself and his small force of soldiers into a state of mystical

stasis that would last until he could rally the defenders of Shan-

tar Othreier once again. But the spell went disastrously wrong.

Although it did place the high mage and his forces in a deep

slumber and tether their souls to their bodies, it did not halt

the ravages of time. Now, after centuries of half-dead slumber,

the high mage and his ghastly followers have arisen again, and

they think the Crown Wars are still in progress.

Manual for the undead soldiers. The high mage is a lich with

Buried Secrets

The saying Some things are best left forgotten is quite true

in reference to remnants of the Crown Wars era. The following

locations hold just a few of the forgotten secrets of the Crown

Wars and the elves who fought them.

ILYTHIIRI TEMPLE TO LOLTH

When  the  Ilythiiri   rst  discovered  and  began  to  worship

the Dark Seldarine, they did not fully understand their new

deities. They knew that Lolth was a spider-goddess, but they

were less clear about the nature of the other gods in their

unholy  pantheon.  As  a  result,  many  of  their  early  temples

contained iconography and ritual rooms that modern drow

would  consider  at  best  baf ing  and  at  worst  blasphemous.

Masked  spiders  cavorted  with  ooze  monsters,  while  eight-

limbed, undead elves wielding swords looked on. Gradually, as

their high priests died horrible deaths at the hands of their

offended gods, the early Lolth cults determined what forms

of worship were acceptable, and the Ilythiiri religion took on

the forms familiar to the drow of today. A few of the early

temples of the Ilythiiri can be found in the Shaar, serving as

homes for various arachnoid monsters.

OCCUPATIONAL FORTS

A number of ancient forts in various states of decay dot the

blasted landscape of the High Moor. Remnants of Aryvandaars

occupation, these small, heavily forti ed complexes were placed

in troublesome areas of Miyeritar so that Aryvandaaran forces

could more easily deal with insurgents, rebels, and other disrup-

tive elements.

Each  occupational  fort  was  a  walled  compound  built  of

mortar and brick woven with various spell-resistance effects and

strengthening magic. Within the walls were a barracks suitable

for a company of sun elf soldiers, an eyrie for twelve griffons,

and a small, separate tower for Aryvandaaran battle mages.

Clerics were stationed at each fort to supply the soldiers with

food, drink, and healing, and the wizards used their divination

magic to sniff out troublemakers before they could incite the

local populace to rebellion. The system was surprisingly effective

in that a relatively small body of soldiers could pacify large

swaths of territory while the main force engaged the enemys

regular troops on the battle eld. Most of these occupational

forts were razed during the Fifth Crown War and its aftermath,

but several still survive, scattered across the High Moor. Most

of them now serve as citadels and outposts for the monsters

that have chosen them as lairs.

THE CROWN WARS

THE CROWN WARS

a spot near Daggerford, a hilltop near the con uence of the

rivers  Delimbiyr  and  Hark,  a  tiny  island  at  the  top  of  the

Shining Falls, the ruin known as Elven Port, the headwaters

of the Delimbiyr in the Talons, and a submerged rock in the

shallows off the coast of the Lizard Marsh (which was part of

Even the Vyshaanti were never as

reviled by their fellow elves as the

rent-day drow bear their ancestors

no  great  love,  primarily  because

of just how far the dark elves have

fallen. Because of the hatred that all

other elves have borne the Ilythiiri

through  the  millennia,  fewer

ruins remain from Ilythiir than

from any other kingdom of the

Crown Wars era. Most of those

that  have  survived  are  twisted

places of darkness and evil built

shortly before the Descent. How

these  sites  have  survived  to  the

present  day  remains  a  mystery,

though  some  suggest  that  they

were  preserved  by  Lolth  herself,

or  by  one  of  the  other  drow

ATHAMAULT

(THE IRON PIT)

Built  during  the  Second  Crown

War,  the  Iron  Pit  was  one  of  the

greatest  Ilythiiri  fortresses.  A

Although it did place the high mage and his forces in a deep

slumber and tether their souls to their bodies, it did not halt

the ravages of time. Now, after centuries of half-dead slumber,

the high mage and his ghastly followers have arisen again, and

they think the Crown Wars are still in progress.

Buried Secrets

The saying Some things are best left forgotten is quite true

in reference to remnants of the Crown Wars era. The following

locations hold just a few of the forgotten secrets of the Crown

Wars and the elves who fought them.

ILYTHIIRI TEMPLE TO LOLTH

When  the  Ilythiiri   rst  discovered  and  began  to  worship

the Dark Seldarine, they did not fully understand their new

deities. They knew that Lolth was a spider-goddess, but they

were less clear about the nature of the other gods in their

unholy  pantheon.  As  a  result,  many  of  their  early  temples

contained iconography and ritual rooms that modern drow

would  consider  at  best  baf ing  and  at  worst  blasphemous.

Masked  spiders  cavorted  with  ooze  monsters,  while  eight-

limbed, undead elves wielding swords looked on. Gradually, as

their high priests died horrible deaths at the hands of their

offended gods, the early Lolth cults determined what forms

of worship were acceptable, and the Ilythiiri religion took on

the forms familiar to the drow of today. A few of the early

temples of the Ilythiiri can be found in the Shaar, serving as

homes for various arachnoid monsters.

OCCUPATIONAL FORTS

A number of ancient forts in various states of decay dot the

blasted landscape of the High Moor. Remnants of Aryvandaars

occupation, these small, heavily forti ed complexes were placed

in troublesome areas of Miyeritar so that Aryvandaaran forces

could more easily deal with insurgents, rebels, and other disrup-

tive elements.

Each  occupational  fort  was  a  walled  compound  built  of

mortar and brick woven with various spell-resistance effects and

strengthening magic. Within the walls were a barracks suitable

for a company of sun elf soldiers, an eyrie for twelve griffons,

and a small, separate tower for Aryvandaaran battle mages.

Clerics were stationed at each fort to supply the soldiers with

food, drink, and healing, and the wizards used their divination

magic to sniff out troublemakers before they could incite the

local populace to rebellion. The system was surprisingly effective

in that a relatively small body of soldiers could pacify large

swaths of territory while the main force engaged the enemys

regular troops on the battle eld. Most of these occupational

forts were razed during the Fifth Crown War and its aftermath,

but several still survive, scattered across the High Moor. Most

of them now serve as citadels and outposts for the monsters

that have chosen them as lairs.

God-Kings

East

of the

Sages and bards throughout Faern tell fantastic stories

of the  rst human empires, which arose in the far

eastern lands uncounted ages ago. Between the dusty

plains of the Raurin Desert and the icy northern reaches of

the Great Glacier,  ve different human empires grew mighty

under the direction of their godlike rulers. The people of these

empires practiced slavery on a scale unknown to any race except

the yuan-ti, committed arcane atrocities of great magnitude,

and waged catastrophic wars in which great armies clashed and

untold thousands died. Centuries of con ict, destruction, and

imperial decline eventually wiped these empires from the face

of Faern, leaving innumerable ruins across the eastern portion

of the continent. A wealth of fabulous riches and forgotten lore

is hidden within some of these shattered remnants of the past,

awaiting discovery by the bold and adventurous.

The eastern empires of old were ruled by absolute tyrants

with limitless ambition. The  rst of them was the human realm

of  Imaskara  mysterious  kingdom  of  power-mad  arti cers

determined to achieve arcane supremacy. They used their magic

to dominate others and even reached into other worlds to enslave

the people there. Emboldened by their successes, the Imaskari

wizards  grew  so  arrogant  and  audacious  that  they  dared  to

defy the godsan act that led to their downfall. With the aid

of their own deities, the slaves threw off the chains of their

Imaskari masters and founded the twin dynasties of Mulhorand

and Unther.

The northern empires of Narfell and Raumathar had far

humbler beginnings. Warrior bands from both nations had once

served as mercenaries in the armies of Unther and Mulhorand,

and  this  association  with  the  two  southern  empires  sparked

imperial desires in the Nar and Raumathari rulers. Numerous

kingdoms in northern Faern were soon united under an evil

emperor beholden to  endish lords, and the new empire, which

was called Narfell, became a twisted land haunted by sinister

demon-worshipers. The Raumvirans turned to arcane warfare,

and its strength came from its warrior-wizards and their fell

battle-magic. Raumathari mages created armies of constructs

armed with weapons that were a fearsome blend of sword and

sorcery and used them to conquer the surrounding territory.

Throughout  the  ensuing  centuries,  Narfell  and  Raumathar

warred  ceaselessly  over  land  and  resources.  The  two  empires

remained bitter enemies and eventually began a war so utterly

consuming that it resulted in their mutual annihilation.

History

Historians  point  to  eastern  Faerns  long  history  of  divine

intercession  and  cataclysmic  wars  as  proof  of  an  exotic  past

very different from that of the west. After all, it was in the

east that gods  rst assumed mortal form and gigantic portals

were opened to other worlds, bringing hundreds of thousands

of alien orcs and humans to Faern.

Since the time when the  rst humans settled in the East,

numerous kingdoms have arisen and fallen, and several ancient

peoples have vanished. Of the  ve eastern empires, only the

realms of Unther and Mulhorand still endure, and they are

much reduced in power from their previous heights.

Keepers of the Past

Histories  of  the  ancient  East  exist  in  surprising  abundance,

primarily because Mulhorand and Unther have enjoyed such

longevity. Though many Imaskari, Nar, and Raumathari records

were lost in the cataclysms that ended those empires, Untheric

and  Mulhorandi  scribes  set  down  not  only  the  histories  of

their own lands, but also the major events that took place in

neighboring realms. These ancient texts are still preserved in

temples and arcane towers throughout the Old Empires.

Of the two sources, the Mulhorandi records are signicantly

more accurate than the Untheric ones. During his many centu-

ries of rule in Unthalass, Gilgeam the God-King often rewrote

ancient histories to glorify his own role in events and to bury

stories that conicted with his own accounts.

PCs attempting to learn the history of the eastern empires

can  nd  a  wealth  of  information,  but  as  the  level  of  detail

increases, the source becomes important. A character who is

well versed in history might be able to recall specic informa-

tion with a Knowledge (history) check (see Table 41: Eastern

THE PURPLE LIBRARY

Ilphemon, the founder of the Underdark city of Deep Imaskar,

ordered  his  people  to  compose  a  written  history  of  Imaskar

so that its rich history would never be forgotten. This tome

is kept within the extradimensional vaults of Deep Imaskars

Purple Library, along with ancient artifacts and a great many

arcane writings. The library is a sacred shrine dedicated to the

ancient Imaskari.

THE STONE OF KEST

In the northern foothills of the Dragonsword Mountains stands

a forgotten monument that was once known as the Stone of

Kest. This obelisk stands better than 60 feet tall, and though it

is somewhat weathered, the tale carved into its four surfaces is

still legible. The Stone of Kest records the story of the Orcgate

Warsin particular, the roles of various Mulhorandi deities

and the deaths of Untheric gods such as Nergal and Marduk.

The stone is scribed in an archaic form of Mulhorandi rendered

in hieroglyphs (Decipher Script DC 25).

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

THE DIVINITY PLAYS

In Skuld, the Mulhorandi celebrate their gods, their history,

and their culture on midsummers day each year. The daylong

celebration  features  church-organized  plays  that  highlight

the  great  events  of  the  past.  Each  play  begins  at  sunrise

and  is  repeated  over  and  over  until  the  final  performance

at sunset.

Local bards and actors portray the gods respectfully, though

their human qualities are highlighted. Horus-Res peers often

scoff at his rigid approach to life. The shortsighted plans of

hot-headed Set always fail, yet somehow these failures end up

helping Horus-Re. The Red Wizards are portrayed as bumbling

brats, much to the amusement of the crowds.

In 1374 DR, a new work was added to the Divinity Plays.

The  Taking  of  Unther  is  a  reenactment  of  the  death  of

Gilgeam and the rescue of the Untheric people by the pharaohs

armies.

THE FIREDAWN CYCLE

The Wychlaran of Rashemen keep alive an oral epic known as

the  Firedawn  Cycle.  This  ancient  tale  describes  Raumathars

dizzying rise to power, its lust for mechanical terrors, and its

horric,  cataclysmic  destruction  at  the  hands  of  end-sum-

moning sorcerers. Very few outside Rashemen have ever heard

this epic song chanted in its full, eerie length, and the witches

refuse to let it be written down.

Important Sites

The humans of the ancient East built mighty nations unlike

those  that  existed  anywhere  else.  The  realms  detailed  here

are ancient and exotic, and their histories span thousands of

years.

Imaskar

The mysterious and mighty Imaskari Empire that dominated

the central Hordelands some four thousand years ago began

its rise to power in what is now the barren wasteland known as

the Raurin Desert. At one time, the proud Imaskari claimed all

the lands between the Methwood in the west and the distant

Katakoros Mountains in the east. After the empire was over-

thrown, the surviving Imaskari hastily abandoned their cities.

The  Mulan  slaves  also  left,  primarily  because  they  despised

their former masters to such an extent that they rejected all

things Imaskari.

The  Imaskari  built  their  cities  and  towns  from  a  purple

stone found naturally in the mountains surrounding the Raurin

Desert. The extreme durability of this stone is the main reason

that so many Imaskari ruins have survived to the present day.

Such places are quite dangerous to explore, however, because of

their many defenses. Most ruined Imaskari cities and articer

towers are protected by constructs (usually golems) dedicated

to guarding against intrusion. In addition, the Imaskaris great

distrust of priests and gods led the empires articers to erect

clever spellwards and arcane traps that severely inhibited divine

magic. Some of these wards punished spellcasters with a vicious

backlash of arcane energy proportionate to the amount of divine

energy released.

Portals and extradimensional spaces were common means

of transportation in the heyday of the empire, and many still

exist  within  Imaskari  ruins.  Articers  also  used  portals  to

travel throughout their cities, and particularly wealthy ones

even used them to move about within their homes. Most slaves

were forbidden access to portals, so they had to navigate the

cramped and narrow streets of Imaskari cities on foot. With

the passage of years, most of these aging portals have become

prone to malfunction and portal seepage (see page 60 of the

FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign  Setting  for  information  on

malfunctioning  portals.)  The  presence  of  numerous  portals

in a single location creates impediments for explorers, since

each doorway may connect with some unknown destination.

Worse still, decayed portals to the Elemental Planes that once

provided the Imaskari with heat and water now threaten to

ood the surrounding areas with re, ice, or worse due to their

seepage.

BHALUIN

The drowned city of Bhaluin rests on a large island in Brightstar

Lake, some 10 miles out from the shores of western Semphr.

Bhaluin was a northern port city of Imaskar and a military

center for the empire. The armies stationed here served as the

empires vanguard against frequent dragon invasions from the

north.

Many of Bhaluins ruins extend into the lake and lie partially

submerged under several feet of water. A well-preserved royal

palace of rose-colored stone with seven slender minarets stands

in the center of the ruined city.

Bhaluin is presently occupied by followers of the dead god

Myrkul. Their leader is Viandos Rippek (NE male human cleric

9 of Myrkul/horned harbinger 4 [see Faiths and Pantheons]),

an obsessed priest devoted to recovering Imaskari magic that

was used against the Mulhorandi gods millennia ago. While

the followers of Bhaluin comb the upper ruins of the city for

such magic, a small army of Rippeks undead servants searches

the  underwater  areas.  Viandos  hopes  to  discover  an  artifact

or spell that could slay the current god of deaththe hated

Kelemvor.

JORHAT CITADEL

High in the Jorhat Mountains northeast of the Raurin Desert

stands  the  shattered  Imaskari  castle  once  known  as  Jorhat

Citadel. Though centuries of harsh climate and neglect have

now reduced many of its structures to crumbling piles of rubble,

the ruins still suggest a strength unknown in most modern-day

fortresses.

This stronghold was once a sprawling complex consisting of

numerous terraces, stairs, tunnels, and overhangs where Imas-

kari armies kept watch on neighboring Kara-Tur. So effective

was this fortress that it was among the last redoubts to stand

against  the  Mulan  rebellion.  When  the  uprising  reached  its

gates, the articer Mardava unleashed a mighty spell to defend

Jorhat against the Mulan slaves. The spell ended disastrously,

killing  both  the  attacking  slaves  and  the  citadels  defenders.

Furthermore,  the  energies  unleashed  transformed  Mardava

into an undead nightshade (CE female nightwalker), and she

has prowled Jorhats lower levels ever since.

METOS

The fortress called Metos was the westernmost outpost of the

Imaskari Empire. At the time of its construction in the Meth-

wood, it was a sizable structure with enough extradimensional

space to house ve thousand soldiers. Imaskari articers created

numerous demiplanes containing gardens and hunting grounds

to make the complex self-sufcient. Access to any portion of

Metos required the correct portal key.

The fortress was abandoned when Lord Articer Yuvaraj

recalled  his  armies  to  ght  the  Mulan  slaves.  The  Imaskari

general stationed at Metos left the fortress virtually unmanned,

condent  that  its  complex  portal  defenses  could  thwart  any

intruders. Persistent legends claim that Turami refugees eeing

the Mulan slaves somehow gained entry to the Imaskari fortress

and dwelled there for centuries before migrating westward to

the lands now known as Unther, Chessenta, and Turmish.

PALACE OF THE PURPLE EMPEROR

An  uncharted  stone  spire  towering  above  the  dunes  of  the

Raurin Desert marks the location of Inupras, Imaskars impe-

rial capital. The Palace of the Purple Emperor, near the citys

heart, is the nest known example of the Imaskari articers

skill with extradimensional space. The palace is ten times bigger

on the inside than on the outside, and it contains hundreds of

dimensional halls, vaults, and arcane chambers, including the

Great Imperial Library.

During the slave revolt, the great battle for Inupras took

place high above the Imperial Palace. Lord Articer Yuvaraj,

wielding a fabled tome of the  Imaskarcana, rode his copper

dragon  mount  into  combat  to  join  his  articers  in  a  spec-

tacular spell-battle against the god-kings Gilgeam and Anhur.

The  destructive  arcane  and  divine  energies  released  in  that

conict razed the imperial city and transformed Raurin into a

desert. The Palace of the Purple Emperor survived unscathed,

presumably because it was protected by wards of epic magic.

In the decade following the uprising, the sweeping sands of the

Raurin Desert swallowed up the remains of Inupras as well as

the emperors wondrous palace.

PLAINS OF PURPLE DUST

This northern region of the Raurin Desert is a vast wasteland

of  purple  sand  dunes,  stony  crags,  and  rocky  badlands.  The

ne purple sand radiates faint magica lesser legacy of the

magical energies released during the spell-battles that heralded

the  empires  fall.  Dozens  of  ancient  arcane  towers  made  of

purple stone lie hidden among massive sand hills and extinct

volcanic  cones,  and  spectral  magesthe  undead  remains  of

Imaskari articershaunt the badlands. The area is also home

to  dangerous  predators,  most  notably  brown,  blue,  and  brass

dragons. Several oases dot the northern edge of this desolate

region, providing water and refuge for passing caravans.

RAUDOR

The ruined city of Raudor lies partially buried under fallen

rock and desert sands on the western slopes of the Raurinshield

Mountains.  The  historical  records  of  the  Deep  Imaskari

indicate  that  the  Fourth  Imaskarcana  was  lost  here  when

the city fell.

For miles around the ruins, a stench of decay lls the air.

The few tales that exist about Raudor speak of an overpowering

evil presence that rules the slithering creatures living in the

citys slave tunnels. In fact, a solitary mind ayer elder brainUnd

now resides in Raudor. Long ago, this creature absorbed the

last  mind  ayers  of  the  community,  and  it  has  begun  to  go

mad from centuries of isolation. The elder brain is sterile and

unable to produce tadpoles, but it is attended by three brain

golemsFF that hunt the mountains for goblins to drag back for

their masters repasts.

RAURIN, THE DUST DESERT

Once a lush vale, the area now known as the Raurin Desert

was the birthplace of the Imaskari Empire. The majority of

surviving  Imaskari  structures  can  be  found  within  this  vast

expanse of purple dust.

Purple sand dunes topped with white salt caps extend in

all  directions.  The  titanic  blocks  of  hardened  lava  that  jut

out  of  the  sandy  waste  serve  as  enduring  reminders  of  the

destructive forces unleashed by the god-kings and articers

during the battles preceding Imaskars fall. Untold numbers

of forgotten Imaskari cities, strongholds, and tombs lie under

the sands of Raurin, lost in memory to all but the citizens of

Deep Imaskar.

The Dust Desert is home to a number of rogue efreet and

djinn, most of which are the descendants of elementals enslaved

by the Imaskari. Purple worms and dragons (primarily brown,

blue, and copper) also dwell here, making their lairs under the

dunes  and  in  the  ruins.  In  addition  to  the  regular  residents,

Choun the Old (LN male human monk 5/Shou discipleRac 4),

a wandering monk from Kara-Tur, roams the Raurin Desert in

his personal quest for enlightenment. He knows the locations

but not the names of various ruins, though he does not bother

to explore them.

SOLON

The ruined city of Solon lies east of the Raurinshield Moun-

tains on the northeastern edge of the Raurin Desert. Though

Solon has been rebuilt twice over the centuries, it now lies

in ruins once again. The cause of its most recent fall was a

magically  wrought  eruption  that  covered  the  city  with  ash

and magma a decade ago. Solons ruler, Ambuchar Devayam

(LE male human lich necromancer 18), apparently caused the

disaster through the misuse of an Imaskari artifact. Survivors

reported  that  just  prior  to  the  eruption,  the  necromancer

had  unearthed  a  mysterious  shrine  dedicated  to  the  darker

paraelemental  and  quasi-elemental  forces  of  ice,  ash,  and

vacuum. The shrine still remains, encased within a massive

sphere of black stone.

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

THE DIVINITY PLAYS

In Skuld, the Mulhorandi celebrate their gods, their history,

and their culture on midsummers day each year. The daylong

celebration  features  church-organized  plays  that  highlight

the  great  events  of  the  past.  Each  play  begins  at  sunrise

and  is  repeated  over  and  over  until  the  final  performance

at sunset.

Local bards and actors portray the gods respectfully, though

their human qualities are highlighted. Horus-Res peers often

scoff at his rigid approach to life. The shortsighted plans of

hot-headed Set always fail, yet somehow these failures end up

helping Horus-Re. The Red Wizards are portrayed as bumbling

brats, much to the amusement of the crowds.

In 1374 DR, a new work was added to the Divinity Plays.

The  Taking  of  Unther  is  a  reenactment  of  the  death  of

Gilgeam and the rescue of the Untheric people by the pharaohs

armies.

THE FIREDAWN CYCLE

The Wychlaran of Rashemen keep alive an oral epic known as

the  Firedawn  Cycle.  This  ancient  tale  describes  Raumathars

dizzying rise to power, its lust for mechanical terrors, and its

horric,  cataclysmic  destruction  at  the  hands  of  end-sum-

moning sorcerers. Very few outside Rashemen have ever heard

this epic song chanted in its full, eerie length, and the witches

refuse to let it be written down.

Important Sites

The humans of the ancient East built mighty nations unlike

those  that  existed  anywhere  else.  The  realms  detailed  here

are ancient and exotic, and their histories span thousands of

years.

Imaskar

The mysterious and mighty Imaskari Empire that dominated

the central Hordelands some four thousand years ago began

its rise to power in what is now the barren wasteland known as

the Raurin Desert. At one time, the proud Imaskari claimed all

the lands between the Methwood in the west and the distant

Katakoros Mountains in the east. After the empire was over-

thrown, the surviving Imaskari hastily abandoned their cities.

The  Mulan  slaves  also  left,  primarily  because  they  despised

their former masters to such an extent that they rejected all

things Imaskari.

The  Imaskari  built  their  cities  and  towns  from  a  purple

stone found naturally in the mountains surrounding the Raurin

Desert. The extreme durability of this stone is the main reason

that so many Imaskari ruins have survived to the present day.

Such places are quite dangerous to explore, however, because of

their many defenses. Most ruined Imaskari cities and articer

towers are protected by constructs (usually golems) dedicated

to guarding against intrusion. In addition, the Imaskaris great

distrust of priests and gods led the empires articers to erect

clever spellwards and arcane traps that severely inhibited divine

magic. Some of these wards punished spellcasters with a vicious

backlash of arcane energy proportionate to the amount of divine

energy released.

Portals and extradimensional spaces were common means

of transportation in the heyday of the empire, and many still

exist  within  Imaskari  ruins.  Articers  also  used  portals  to

travel throughout their cities, and particularly wealthy ones

even used them to move about within their homes. Most slaves

were forbidden access to portals, so they had to navigate the

cramped and narrow streets of Imaskari cities on foot. With

the passage of years, most of these aging portals have become

prone to malfunction and portal seepage (see page 60 of the

FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign  Setting  for  information  on

malfunctioning  portals.)  The  presence  of  numerous  portals

in a single location creates impediments for explorers, since

each doorway may connect with some unknown destination.

Worse still, decayed portals to the Elemental Planes that once

provided the Imaskari with heat and water now threaten to

ood the surrounding areas with re, ice, or worse due to their

seepage.

BHALUIN

The drowned city of Bhaluin rests on a large island in Brightstar

Lake, some 10 miles out from the shores of western Semphr.

Bhaluin was a northern port city of Imaskar and a military

center for the empire. The armies stationed here served as the

empires vanguard against frequent dragon invasions from the

north.

Many of Bhaluins ruins extend into the lake and lie partially

submerged under several feet of water. A well-preserved royal

palace of rose-colored stone with seven slender minarets stands

in the center of the ruined city.

Bhaluin is presently occupied by followers of the dead god

Myrkul. Their leader is Viandos Rippek (NE male human cleric

9 of Myrkul/horned harbinger 4 [see Faiths and Pantheons]),

an obsessed priest devoted to recovering Imaskari magic that

was used against the Mulhorandi gods millennia ago. While

the followers of Bhaluin comb the upper ruins of the city for

such magic, a small army of Rippeks undead servants searches

the  underwater  areas.  Viandos  hopes  to  discover  an  artifact

or spell that could slay the current god of deaththe hated

Kelemvor.

JORHAT CITADEL

High in the Jorhat Mountains northeast of the Raurin Desert

stands  the  shattered  Imaskari  castle  once  known  as  Jorhat

Citadel. Though centuries of harsh climate and neglect have

now reduced many of its structures to crumbling piles of rubble,

the ruins still suggest a strength unknown in most modern-day

fortresses.

This stronghold was once a sprawling complex consisting of

numerous terraces, stairs, tunnels, and overhangs where Imas-

kari armies kept watch on neighboring Kara-Tur. So effective

was this fortress that it was among the last redoubts to stand

against  the  Mulan  rebellion.  When  the  uprising  reached  its

gates, the articer Mardava unleashed a mighty spell to defend

Jorhat against the Mulan slaves. The spell ended disastrously,

killing  both  the  attacking  slaves  and  the  citadels  defenders.

Furthermore,  the  energies  unleashed  transformed  Mardava

into an undead nightshade (CE female nightwalker), and she

has prowled Jorhats lower levels ever since.

METOS

The fortress called Metos was the westernmost outpost of the

Imaskari Empire. At the time of its construction in the Meth-

wood, it was a sizable structure with enough extradimensional

space to house ve thousand soldiers. Imaskari articers created

numerous demiplanes containing gardens and hunting grounds

to make the complex self-sufcient. Access to any portion of

Metos required the correct portal key.

The fortress was abandoned when Lord Articer Yuvaraj

recalled  his  armies  to  ght  the  Mulan  slaves.  The  Imaskari

general stationed at Metos left the fortress virtually unmanned,

condent  that  its  complex  portal  defenses  could  thwart  any

intruders. Persistent legends claim that Turami refugees eeing

the Mulan slaves somehow gained entry to the Imaskari fortress

and dwelled there for centuries before migrating westward to

the lands now known as Unther, Chessenta, and Turmish.

PALACE OF THE PURPLE EMPEROR

An  uncharted  stone  spire  towering  above  the  dunes  of  the

Raurin Desert marks the location of Inupras, Imaskars impe-

rial capital. The Palace of the Purple Emperor, near the citys

heart, is the nest known example of the Imaskari articers

skill with extradimensional space. The palace is ten times bigger

on the inside than on the outside, and it contains hundreds of

dimensional halls, vaults, and arcane chambers, including the

Great Imperial Library.

During the slave revolt, the great battle for Inupras took

place high above the Imperial Palace. Lord Articer Yuvaraj,

wielding a fabled tome of the  Imaskarcana, rode his copper

dragon  mount  into  combat  to  join  his  articers  in  a  spec-

tacular spell-battle against the god-kings Gilgeam and Anhur.

The  destructive  arcane  and  divine  energies  released  in  that

conict razed the imperial city and transformed Raurin into a

desert. The Palace of the Purple Emperor survived unscathed,

presumably because it was protected by wards of epic magic.

In the decade following the uprising, the sweeping sands of the

Raurin Desert swallowed up the remains of Inupras as well as

the emperors wondrous palace.

PLAINS OF PURPLE DUST

This northern region of the Raurin Desert is a vast wasteland

of  purple  sand  dunes,  stony  crags,  and  rocky  badlands.  The

ne purple sand radiates faint magica lesser legacy of the

magical energies released during the spell-battles that heralded

the  empires  fall.  Dozens  of  ancient  arcane  towers  made  of

purple stone lie hidden among massive sand hills and extinct

volcanic  cones,  and  spectral  magesthe  undead  remains  of

Imaskari articershaunt the badlands. The area is also home

to  dangerous  predators,  most  notably  brown,  blue,  and  brass

dragons. Several oases dot the northern edge of this desolate

region, providing water and refuge for passing caravans.

RAUDOR

The ruined city of Raudor lies partially buried under fallen

rock and desert sands on the western slopes of the Raurinshield

Mountains.  The  historical  records  of  the  Deep  Imaskari

indicate  that  the  Fourth  Imaskarcana  was  lost  here  when

the city fell.

For miles around the ruins, a stench of decay lls the air.

evil presence that rules the slithering creatures living in the

citys slave tunnels. In fact, a solitary mind ayer elder brainUnd

now resides in Raudor. Long ago, this creature absorbed the

last  mind  ayers  of  the  community,  and  it  has  begun  to  go

mad from centuries of isolation. The elder brain is sterile and

unable to produce tadpoles, but it is attended by three brain

golemsFF that hunt the mountains for goblins to drag back for

their masters repasts.

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

Mulhorand

The  Empire  of  Mul-

horand  has  risen  and

declined  twice,  and  it

now looks poised to begin

a  third  imperial  ascent.

At its height, Mulhorand

held a vast tract of land

east of the Sea of Fallen

Stars that stretched from

Thay to distant Semphr

and included the Raurin

Desert and much of the

Eastern Shaar.

Forgotten  prayer

towers  and  burial  pyra-

mids,  symbols  of  the

empires  ancient  divine

dynasties,  lie  scattered

throughout  Mulhorand

and its former domains.

These ruins are decorated

with stylized art depict-

ing the gods engaged in

erudite  activities.  The  burial

pyramids  of  prominent  deities

contain  huge  amounts  of  gold,

ornate  sarcophagi,  and  divinely

powered  burial  goods.  Such  sites  were

typically  protected  by  numerous  traps

and  guarded  by  golems  much  larger  than

those seen elsewhere.

DELHUMIDE

During Thays rebellious break with its parent empire, fiends

utterly razed the Mulhorandi provincial capital of Delhumide.

The  wrecked  city  is  now  a  sprawling  mass  of  debris  and

rubble in which no building stands more than one story high.

Rumor holds that fiends from the Abyss and foul creatures

of  the  Underdark  dwell  within  a  maze  of  tunnels  beneath

the  old  city.  Despite  these  horrors,  adventurers  often  visit

Delhumide in search of its legendary gold and divine artifacts.

Tharchion  Invarri  Metron  (LE  male  human  fighter  11),

current ruler of the Thayan province of Delhumide, claims

a share of any wealth recovered by adventurers who explore

the shattered city.

KEPETUR

The prayer tower of Kepetur is an abandoned obelisk in the

southern Pyrados region of Thay. At the time of the Thayan

rebellion, the Red Wizards claimed some of the Mulhorandi

prayer towers in the disputed area and reduced the rest to rubble.

In Kepetur, the priests and divine minions of Anhur managed to

keep the Red Wizards at bay for several tendays, but the towers

fell shortly after the arrival of the arch end Eltab.

Land of the Dead

Once he had gained control of Kepetur, Eltab opened a permanent

gate to the Abyss, through which demons continue to enter Faern

to this day. But the warding spells placed there by the Red Wizards

prevent the scores of  ends in Kepetur from leaving the obelisk.

Legend has it that Kepetur still contains many divine relics that

its defenders hid before the arrival of Eltab.

LAND OF THE DEAD

This  holy  vale  at  the  edge  of  the  Sword  Mountains  is  the

burial ground of the Mulhorandi god-kings. The valley holds

dozens  of  sloped  pyramids,  ziggurats,  and  towering  obelisks,

each housing the remains of a Mulhorand deitys incarnation.

All the tombs are elaborately decorated with divine scenes and

hieroglyphic script. The most magni cent of all is a massive

monument  carved  from  an  entire  mountainthe  tomb  of

Pharaoh  Horuseres  II.  God-kings  were  traditionally  buried

with  incredible  treasures,  including  magni cent  gems,  gold

coins,  and  the  personal  belongings  they  wore  in  life.  Lethal

mechanical  traps  and  gemstone  golemsMon  protect  the  dead

inside their tombs while glorious servitors keep watch over the

sacred valley of their gods.

SEKRAS

This small city along the River of Swords served as a major

worship center for Sebek, the much-reviled Mulhorandi deity

of rivers. With the silent approval of Horus-Re, paladins of

Osiris razed the city and dumped all the temple property into

the river.

Since the destruction of Sekras, its ruins have been a breed-

ing ground for werecrocodiles and sphinxes. Recently, however,

the god Sebek has appointed Sipari (NE female human cleric

10 of Sebek/glorious servitor 3 of Sebek) as the secret guard-

ian of Sekras. Since accepting this sacred charge, she has been

recovering her gods relics from the river and slowly rebuilding

the temple. She remains cautiously watchful for any sign of the

paladins of Osiris.

SEMKHRUN

The Oracle City of Semkhrun was founded more than twenty-

 ve hundred years ago in the plains of southern Semphr. The

city eventually became a center for divination studies and grew

famous for housing the Oracle of Fahzakhum, an artifact with

the ability to foretell the future. Inquirers from as far away as

Kara-Tur and Netheril sought out Semkhrun and heaped lavish

sums of money upon the city priests in hopes of gaining access

to the oracle. Renaming themselves the Masters of the Oracle,

the greedy priests demanded tribute from all who would question

the oracle. They used the gold offerings to build mighty palaces,

obelisks, and burial pyramids in imitation of those constructed

by the divine dynasties in Skuld.

Word  of  the  priests  arrogance  eventually  reached  the

god-kings, who sent their armies to punish Semkhrun. All the

Masters of the Oracle were put to the sword, and the blasphe-

mous citys population was enslaved. Glorious servitors entombed

Semkhrun under earth and sand, wiping it from the face of

the land. The name Semkhrun was stricken from all maps and

scrolls, so few records now bear its name. The  nal fate of the

Oracle of Fahzakhum remains unknown, although rumors have

linked the artifact to the wandering prophet known as Serkent

of the Howling Gap (NG male human diviner 11).

Narfell

The human empire known as Narfell once stretched from the

Giantspire Mountains to Lake Ashane, encompassing southern

lands that would eventually become Impiltur, the Great Dale,

Thesk, and the northwestern portion of Thay. Few Nar keeps

and even fewer Nar cities survived the cataclysmic war that

destroyed  the  empire,  and  those  that  still  exist  are  scattered

throughout the lands that Narfell once held.

The typical Nar fortresses were squat buildings with numer-

ous  underground  levels  and  rooms.  Each  fortress  contained

at  least  one  conjuring  chamber  that  was  used  to  summon

 ends. Nar sorcerers placed glyphs and wards throughout the

underground levels to protect against uncontrolled  ends. The

fortresses of Narfells more powerful conjurers often contained

portals leading to the Abyss and the Nine Hells. Many Nar ruins

are still plagued with demons and devils that were summoned

nearly twenty centuries ago.

CITY OF WEEPING GHOSTS

Along the shores of Lake Ashane in the Great Dale lie the ruins

of the once proud Nar city known as Shandaular. Before the rise

of Narfell, Shandaular was the capital of a minor Nar kingdom

called Ashanath. When its leaders refused to join the new empire,

the Nentyarch of Tharos destroyed the city. Today, the ruins

are  haunted  by  hundreds  of  wraiths  and  dread  wraithsthe

victims of the ancient nentyarchs merciless wrath.

DUN-THAROS

Formerly the imperial capital of Narfell, Dun-Tharos is now

a broken ruin deep in the heart of the Rawlinswood. During

the  empires   nal  days,  Raumathari  battle  mages  laid  waste

to Dun-Tharos, leaving only broken towers, wrecked temples,

and rubble.

Dun-Tharos has been virtually unexplored since its fall. A

powerful druid once took up residence here, claiming the title of

nentyarch after the Nar lords of old. He grew a living fortress

of trees over the ruins in an effort to cleanse the Rawlinswood

of Narfells foul taint. Recently, however, a mysterious being

called  the  Rotting  Man  and  his  army  of  diseased  creatures

chased off the druid and took control of the ruins.

Now the remains of Dun-Tharos lie half buried under rot-

ting masses of dead and dying trees. Adventurers seeking the

treasure- lled  vaults  underneath  Dun-Tharos  must  get  past

the mass of vegetation as well as the Rotting Man (see Unap-

proachable East for further information).

FORTRESS OF THE HALF-DEMON

One of the few Nar ruins within the borders of Rashemen, this

keep is located in the North Country, near Lake Ashane. The

otherworldly stone used to construct the fort is credited with

preventing its destruction at the hands of the Raumvirans. The

stone of the fortress walls is icy cold to the touch and gives off

a harmless, glowing, green vapor. A gigantic iron gate in the

shape of a demonic face marks the entrance.

A hagspawned creature named Losk (CE male hagspawnUna

 ghter 4/wizard 9) has recently claimed the ancient keep. His

gang of cutthroats and thieves is now searching the dungeons

for anything of value.

FORTRESS NARDER

The  ruins  of  this  fortress  lie  at  the  far  eastern  edge  of  the

Forest of Lethyr. In the days of the empire, Fortress Narder

served as a gathering point for Nar armies preparing to debark

for  Raumathar.  When  the  con ict   nally  reached  this  area,

however, an unknown Raumathari spell reduced Narder to a

mass of broken stone.

A  foul,  twisted  sickness  now  permeates  the  ruins  of  the

ancient fortress, seeping from the dungeon to poison the sur-

rounding water, soil, and air. With the aid of other druids, the

former Nentyarch of Dun-Tharos has been working to cleanse

the corruption, but progress has been slow because of frequent

attacks from the hezrou demons that lurk in the depths of the

fortress. The nentyarch fears that a source of evil powermost

likely a transplanted chunk of the Abysslies at the heart of

the fortress.

throughout  Mulhorand

and its former domains.

These ruins are decorated

with stylized art depict-

ing the gods engaged in

erudite  activities.  The  burial

pyramids  of  prominent  deities

contain  huge  amounts  of  gold,

ornate  sarcophagi,  and  divinely

powered  burial  goods.  Such  sites  were

typically  protected  by  numerous  traps

and  guarded  by  golems  much  larger  than

those seen elsewhere.

DELHUMIDE

During Thays rebellious break with its parent empire, fiends

utterly razed the Mulhorandi provincial capital of Delhumide.

The  wrecked  city  is  now  a  sprawling  mass  of  debris  and

rubble in which no building stands more than one story high.

Rumor holds that fiends from the Abyss and foul creatures

of  the  Underdark  dwell  within  a  maze  of  tunnels  beneath

the  old  city.  Despite  these  horrors,  adventurers  often  visit

Delhumide in search of its legendary gold and divine artifacts.

Tharchion  Invarri  Metron  (LE  male  human  fighter  11),

current ruler of the Thayan province of Delhumide, claims

a share of any wealth recovered by adventurers who explore

the shattered city.

KEPETUR

The prayer tower of Kepetur is an abandoned obelisk in the

southern Pyrados region of Thay. At the time of the Thayan

rebellion, the Red Wizards claimed some of the Mulhorandi

prayer towers in the disputed area and reduced the rest to rubble.

In Kepetur, the priests and divine minions of Anhur managed to

keep the Red Wizards at bay for several tendays, but the towers

fell shortly after the arrival of the arch end Eltab.

Land of the Dead

Once he had gained control of Kepetur, Eltab opened a permanent

gate to the Abyss, through which demons continue to enter Faern

to this day. But the warding spells placed there by the Red Wizards

prevent the scores of  ends in Kepetur from leaving the obelisk.

Legend has it that Kepetur still contains many divine relics that

its defenders hid before the arrival of Eltab.

LAND OF THE DEAD

This  holy  vale  at  the  edge  of  the  Sword  Mountains  is  the

burial ground of the Mulhorandi god-kings. The valley holds

dozens  of  sloped  pyramids,  ziggurats,  and  towering  obelisks,

each housing the remains of a Mulhorand deitys incarnation.

All the tombs are elaborately decorated with divine scenes and

hieroglyphic script. The most magni cent of all is a massive

monument  carved  from  an  entire  mountainthe  tomb  of

Pharaoh  Horuseres  II.  God-kings  were  traditionally  buried

with  incredible  treasures,  including  magni cent  gems,  gold

coins,  and  the  personal  belongings  they  wore  in  life.  Lethal

mechanical  traps  and  gemstone  golemsMon  protect  the  dead

inside their tombs while glorious servitors keep watch over the

sacred valley of their gods.

SEKRAS

This small city along the River of Swords served as a major

worship center for Sebek, the much-reviled Mulhorandi deity

of rivers. With the silent approval of Horus-Re, paladins of

Osiris razed the city and dumped all the temple property into

the river.

Since the destruction of Sekras, its ruins have been a breed-

ing ground for werecrocodiles and sphinxes. Recently, however,

the god Sebek has appointed Sipari (NE female human cleric

10 of Sebek/glorious servitor 3 of Sebek) as the secret guard-

ian of Sekras. Since accepting this sacred charge, she has been

recovering her gods relics from the river and slowly rebuilding

the temple. She remains cautiously watchful for any sign of the

paladins of Osiris.

SEMKHRUN

The Oracle City of Semkhrun was founded more than twenty-

 ve hundred years ago in the plains of southern Semphr. The

city eventually became a center for divination studies and grew

famous for housing the Oracle of Fahzakhum, an artifact with

the ability to foretell the future. Inquirers from as far away as

Kara-Tur and Netheril sought out Semkhrun and heaped lavish

sums of money upon the city priests in hopes of gaining access

to the oracle. Renaming themselves the Masters of the Oracle,

the greedy priests demanded tribute from all who would question

the oracle. They used the gold offerings to build mighty palaces,

obelisks, and burial pyramids in imitation of those constructed

by the divine dynasties in Skuld.

Word  of  the  priests  arrogance  eventually  reached  the

god-kings, who sent their armies to punish Semkhrun. All the

Masters of the Oracle were put to the sword, and the blasphe-

mous citys population was enslaved. Glorious servitors entombed

Semkhrun under earth and sand, wiping it from the face of

the land. The name Semkhrun was stricken from all maps and

scrolls, so few records now bear its name. The  nal fate of the

Oracle of Fahzakhum remains unknown, although rumors have

linked the artifact to the wandering prophet known as Serkent

of the Howling Gap (NG male human diviner 11).

Narfell

The human empire known as Narfell once stretched from the

Giantspire Mountains to Lake Ashane, encompassing southern

lands that would eventually become Impiltur, the Great Dale,

Thesk, and the northwestern portion of Thay. Few Nar keeps

and even fewer Nar cities survived the cataclysmic war that

destroyed  the  empire,  and  those  that  still  exist  are  scattered

throughout the lands that Narfell once held.

The typical Nar fortresses were squat buildings with numer-

ous  underground  levels  and  rooms.  Each  fortress  contained

at  least  one  conjuring  chamber  that  was  used  to  summon

 ends. Nar sorcerers placed glyphs and wards throughout the

underground levels to protect against uncontrolled  ends. The

fortresses of Narfells more powerful conjurers often contained

portals leading to the Abyss and the Nine Hells. Many Nar ruins

are still plagued with demons and devils that were summoned

nearly twenty centuries ago.

CITY OF WEEPING GHOSTS

Along the shores of Lake Ashane in the Great Dale lie the ruins

of the once proud Nar city known as Shandaular. Before the rise

of Narfell, Shandaular was the capital of a minor Nar kingdom

called Ashanath. When its leaders refused to join the new empire,

the Nentyarch of Tharos destroyed the city. Today, the ruins

are  haunted  by  hundreds  of  wraiths  and  dread  wraithsthe

victims of the ancient nentyarchs merciless wrath.

DUN-THAROS

Formerly the imperial capital of Narfell, Dun-Tharos is now

a broken ruin deep in the heart of the Rawlinswood. During

the  empires   nal  days,  Raumathari  battle  mages  laid  waste

to Dun-Tharos, leaving only broken towers, wrecked temples,

and rubble.

Dun-Tharos has been virtually unexplored since its fall. A

powerful druid once took up residence here, claiming the title of

nentyarch after the Nar lords of old. He grew a living fortress

of trees over the ruins in an effort to cleanse the Rawlinswood

of Narfells foul taint. Recently, however, a mysterious being

called  the  Rotting  Man  and  his  army  of  diseased  creatures

chased off the druid and took control of the ruins.

Now the remains of Dun-Tharos lie half buried under rot-

ting masses of dead and dying trees. Adventurers seeking the

treasure- lled  vaults  underneath  Dun-Tharos  must  get  past

the mass of vegetation as well as the Rotting Man (see Unap-

proachable East for further information).

FORTRESS OF THE HALF-DEMON

One of the few Nar ruins within the borders of Rashemen, this

keep is located in the North Country, near Lake Ashane. The

otherworldly stone used to construct the fort is credited with

preventing its destruction at the hands of the Raumvirans. The

stone of the fortress walls is icy cold to the touch and gives off

a harmless, glowing, green vapor. A gigantic iron gate in the

shape of a demonic face marks the entrance.

A hagspawned creature named Losk (CE male hagspawnUna

 ghter 4/wizard 9) has recently claimed the ancient keep. His

gang of cutthroats and thieves is now searching the dungeons

for anything of value.

FORTRESS NARDER

The  ruins  of  this  fortress  lie  at  the  far  eastern  edge  of  the

Forest of Lethyr. In the days of the empire, Fortress Narder

served as a gathering point for Nar armies preparing to debark

for  Raumathar.  When  the  con ict   nally  reached  this  area,

however, an unknown Raumathari spell reduced Narder to a

mass of broken stone.

A  foul,  twisted  sickness  now  permeates  the  ruins  of  the

ancient fortress, seeping from the dungeon to poison the sur-

rounding water, soil, and air. With the aid of other druids, the

former Nentyarch of Dun-Tharos has been working to cleanse

the corruption, but progress has been slow because of frequent

attacks from the hezrou demons that lurk in the depths of the

fortress. The nentyarch fears that a source of evil powermost

likely a transplanted chunk of the Abysslies at the heart of

the fortress.

JASTAATH CASTLE

These crumbling ruins are all that remain of an immense castle

that was built high upon the western slopes of Mount Nar long

before the rise of Narfell. Archaic texts refer to the priest-kings

of Jastaath as the  rst Nars to parley with demons of the Abyss.

Abandoned for unknown reasons, the castle has lain under an

eternal blanket of snow and ice since the fall of Narfell.

Kryonar, the renegade white dracolich wyrm that lairs on

Mount  Nar  near  the  frozen  castle,  considers  any  visitor  to

Jastaath a potential spy from the Cult of the Dragon.

Kryonars  murderous  nature  and  the  castles

remote location have thus far discouraged

explorers.

VAL MURTHAG

Devastated by earth-shattering Rau-

mathari battle-magic, the Nar fortress

of Val Murthag was leveled during the

 nal war between the two empires. Lo-

cated on the western edge of the Great

Dale,  the  castle  at  Val  Murthag  was

Narfells unholy spiritual center

of demon worship. Crumbling

walls of weathered stone are

all that remain of the surface

structure, but the deep vaults below the

ruins  house  trapped  demons,  restless

undead, stolen Raumathari treasures,

and the secrets of a foul ritual once

used  to  transform  mortals  into

 ends.

For  the  past  few  weeks,  a

renegade  Red  Wizard  and  her

imp familiar have been system-

atically exploring Val Murthag,

hoping to unearth its demonic

secrets. Branimern Rythil (LE

Jastaath Castle on Mount Nar

Raumathar

Nestled in the northern reaches of eastern Faern, the Raumath-

ari Empire quickly expanded to dominate the lands south of the

Icerim Mountains and north of Lake Eltabbar in the land that

is now Thay, including the western half of the Endless Wastes.

Like its enemy Narfell, Raumathar was a short-lived empire

that lasted fewer than nine hundred years. Its catastrophic end

was so absolute that few traces of it survive.

A Raumathari ruin usually consists of several tall towers

grouped  together,  all  guarded  by  deadly  battle-spells.  Keeps

and citadels were normally warded to prevent outsiders from

entering, and dozens of intact spelltraps that target  ends are

embedded in the roofs and walls. As these arcane protections

age and decay, they leak bizarre magical energies into the sur-

rounding terrain, corrupting the nearby  ora and fauna.

ALMOREL

Settled more than  fteen centuries ago at the height of the Rau-

mathari Empire, Almorel has outlasted its founders and become

one of the major trading cities of the Endless Wastes. The city,

which sits on the southern shore of the Lake of Mists, is a regu-

lar stop for caravans and

adventurers traveling the

Golden Way. Far beneath

Almorel lies an extensive

system  of  ancient,  un-

derground  tunnels  and

abandoned war-chambers.

These rooms contain me-

chanical horrors that the

Raumvirans  constructed

speci cally to hunt down

and  trap  the   ends  of

the Nars.

BEACON CAIRN

Just  east  of  the  Sunrise

Mountains,  the  ruins  of

Beacon  Cairn  mark  the

southernmost  boundary

of  Rashemen.  The  town

was  originally  founded

by  the  Raumathari  bat-

tlemage  who  created  the

magically illuminated pin-

nacle of rock from which

the town takes its name.

Some two thousand years

ago, Beacon Cairn served

as a hiding place for magic

weapons of war.

After  the  Tuigan  invasion,

the  Huhrong  of  Rashemen  sta-

tioned a small garrison of warriors

here to keep watch over the horse riders of the Endless Wastes.

Early  in  1373,  however,  Beacon  Cairn  was  attacked  by  an

unknown enemy that  attened the town and slaughtered the

inhabitants. The few stone buildings left standing display huge

gouge  marksprobably  from  the  attacks  of  some  gigantic,

clawed creature. The Wychlaran suspect that the Red Wizards

were ultimately responsible for the towns destruction.

GAUROS

Several  old  Raumathari  ruins  dot  this  remote,  mountainous

section of Thay. Most notable among them is the Bronze Battle-

tower built by the ancient Raumathari mage Vostas. Foreseeing

her empires impending doom, Vostas concealed her battletower

with formidable warding spells that rendered it invisible and

undetectable by magic. Vostas died when Raumathar fell, and

the battletower has been passed down through her descendants.

The current owner is Iarokhna Nuchlev (NE female human

sorcerer 3/druid 3/durthanUna 2), a renegade Wychlaran. The

epic spell that Vostas used to conceal the Bronze Battletower

still functions, keeping Iarokhna and the Raumathari secrets

in the tower well hidden.

RING OF GRAY FLAMES

Along the border between Rashemen and the Endless Wastes

stands a bizarre Raumathari ruin consisting of  ve cracked and

broken towers arranged in a ring. Each tower is topped by a

 ickering crown of gray  ame. Primarily because of the strange

grinding noises that often emanate from at least two of the  ve

towers, the so-called Ring of Gray Flames is blamed for the

unusual constructs that roam the surrounding areas.

The original purpose of this ring is unknown, but it disrupts

any divine magic cast within a 100-foot radius and makes sum-

moning outsiders a dangerous business. (Anyone attempting to

summon an outsider within 100 feet of the ring must succeed

on a Spellcraft check [DC 15 + spell level] or be immolated in

gray  ames that deal 1d6 points of  re damage per level of

the summoning spell attempted.)

WINTERKEEP

Built on the western edge of the Endless Wastes along the Great

Ice Sea, this ancient city was once the capital of the Raumathari

Empire. Though its palaces were long ago destroyed by freezing

cold,  re, and decay, its underground stone halls have survived

mostly intact. Dozens of deep, twisting passageways and care-

fully hidden rooms give mute evidence of the strategic mindset

for which the ancient Raumvirans were famous.

A single bheur hagUna and her orglashUna servants stalk the

tunnels of Winterkeep every summer, but they leave when the

 rst snow comes. Rumor has it that the Wychlaran know the

safest way to this isolated ruin, but few are willing to make

such a treacherous journey through the barren steppes of the

Endless Wastes.

Unther

Once a mighty realm that claimed the lands south of the Sea

of Fallen Stars as well as the southern half of the Aglarond

Peninsula, Unther is now a much-diminished empire in danger

of disappearing entirely. During its  rst imperial rise, Unther

expanded  into  Chessenta,  the  Shaar,  and  parts  of  Dambrath

and  Estagund.  In  order  to  spread  the  Untheric  religion  to

these  new  lands,  the  god-kings  directed  the  construction  of

temples, ziggurats, and other religious monuments throughout

the empire. With the death of the Untheric pantheon and the

subsequent decline of the empire, these structures were largely

abandoned. Like Mulhorandi religious sites, Untheric ruins are

treasure troves of religious artifacts and wealth protected by

huge constructs and traps that deliver deadly poisons.

CITADEL OF BLACK ASH

More than six hundred years ago, the Untheric deity Gilgeam

transformed an abandoned dragon lair on a southeastern slope

of  the  Smoking  Mountains  into  his  private  stronghold.  The

Father of Victories called his new fortress the Citadel of Black

Ash, after the swampy quagmire of volcanic ash surrounding

the mountains base.

When Gilgeams loyal clerics and high champions were forced

to  ee the riots that followed their god-kings death, the citadel

became their secret sanctuary. For years, the generals plotted

their return to power while the priests prayed for the return

of their god-king. Meanwhile, soldiers mined the mountains

tunnels extensively for gems to  nance the upcoming war.

The  efforts  of  Gilgeams  faithful  ended  in  1372,  when

volcanic activity covered the citadel in a superheated cloud of

 ery ash, killing almost everyone inside. The structure is now

almost  completely  buried  in  ash,  which  helps  to  protect  the

gemstones, weapons, and divine magic items that lie within its

vaults. Dozens of huecuvasthe undead remains of Gilgeams

clericsnow haunt the place.

GOD-TOMBS

When  the  gods  of  Unther  died,  they  were  entombed  in   at-

topped ziggurats far from civilized areas. Inanna, Girru, Ki,

Marduk, Nanna-Sin, Nergal, Ramman, and Utu were all laid

to rest in this manner, but Gilgeams body was never recovered

for burial.

Because the Untheric priests feared public disgrace if the

slumber of their gods was disturbed, they  lled the ziggurats

with traps and other hazards to deter thievery. The sarcophagus

of each dead god was placed deep within its ziggurats mazelike

system of rooms and passages. Mechanical traps, many contain-

ing virulent poison, were placed in halls and door locks. The

traps were rigged so that either disabling or springing one would

activate  others,  creating  a  cascade  of  deadly  effects.  Finally,

Gargantuan stone golems were built into various chambers so

as to appear part of the walls.

GREAT BARROW

Just off the Great Road, near the southernmost portion of the

Rawlinswood in the Great Dale, lies the Great Barrow, a massive

burial mound ringed by numerous smaller mounds. The Great

Barrow was built in the heady days of the First Untheric Empire

as a tomb for the slain Untheric god Nergal. Gilgeam oversaw

the  gods  lavish  burial  and  sealed  Nergals  still-living  family

and servants inside the lesser tombs surrounding that of the

deity. Once all the tombs had been buried under earthen hills,

Gilgeam slaughtered the builders, raised them as undead crypt

things, and set them to guard Nergal and his family.

Travelers  in  the  area  of  the  Great  Barrow  often  report

encountering skeletal undead that choke and gasp as if desper-

ately trying to breathe. Whether these creatures are Gilgeams

appointed  crypt-things  or  the  restless  undead  remnants  of

Nergals family remains a mystery.

UNTHALASS

The decrepit former capital of Unther has suffered terribly from

natural disasters and centuries of neglect. Great  oods have twice

destroyed huge sections of Unthalass, submerging entire city

blocks under mud and muck. Such damage was rarely repaired;

clawed creature. The Wychlaran suspect that the Red Wizards

were ultimately responsible for the towns destruction.

GAUROS

Several  old  Raumathari  ruins  dot  this  remote,  mountainous

section of Thay. Most notable among them is the Bronze Battle-

tower built by the ancient Raumathari mage Vostas. Foreseeing

her empires impending doom, Vostas concealed her battletower

with formidable warding spells that rendered it invisible and

undetectable by magic. Vostas died when Raumathar fell, and

the battletower has been passed down through her descendants.

The current owner is Iarokhna Nuchlev (NE female human

sorcerer 3/druid 3/durthanUna 2), a renegade Wychlaran. The

epic spell that Vostas used to conceal the Bronze Battletower

still functions, keeping Iarokhna and the Raumathari secrets

in the tower well hidden.

RING OF GRAY FLAMES

Along the border between Rashemen and the Endless Wastes

stands a bizarre Raumathari ruin consisting of  ve cracked and

broken towers arranged in a ring. Each tower is topped by a

 ickering crown of gray  ame. Primarily because of the strange

grinding noises that often emanate from at least two of the  ve

towers, the so-called Ring of Gray Flames is blamed for the

unusual constructs that roam the surrounding areas.

The original purpose of this ring is unknown, but it disrupts

any divine magic cast within a 100-foot radius and makes sum-

moning outsiders a dangerous business. (Anyone attempting to

summon an outsider within 100 feet of the ring must succeed

on a Spellcraft check [DC 15 + spell level] or be immolated in

gray  ames that deal 1d6 points of  re damage per level of

the summoning spell attempted.)

WINTERKEEP

Built on the western edge of the Endless Wastes along the Great

Ice Sea, this ancient city was once the capital of the Raumathari

Empire. Though its palaces were long ago destroyed by freezing

cold,  re, and decay, its underground stone halls have survived

mostly intact. Dozens of deep, twisting passageways and care-

fully hidden rooms give mute evidence of the strategic mindset

for which the ancient Raumvirans were famous.

A single bheur hagUna and her orglashUna servants stalk the

tunnels of Winterkeep every summer, but they leave when the

 rst snow comes. Rumor has it that the Wychlaran know the

safest way to this isolated ruin, but few are willing to make

such a treacherous journey through the barren steppes of the

Endless Wastes.

Unther

Once a mighty realm that claimed the lands south of the Sea

of Fallen Stars as well as the southern half of the Aglarond

Peninsula, Unther is now a much-diminished empire in danger

of disappearing entirely. During its  rst imperial rise, Unther

expanded  into  Chessenta,  the  Shaar,  and  parts  of  Dambrath

and  Estagund.  In  order  to  spread  the  Untheric  religion  to

these  new  lands,  the  god-kings  directed  the  construction  of

temples, ziggurats, and other religious monuments throughout

the empire. With the death of the Untheric pantheon and the

subsequent decline of the empire, these structures were largely

abandoned. Like Mulhorandi religious sites, Untheric ruins are

treasure troves of religious artifacts and wealth protected by

huge constructs and traps that deliver deadly poisons.

CITADEL OF BLACK ASH

More than six hundred years ago, the Untheric deity Gilgeam

transformed an abandoned dragon lair on a southeastern slope

of  the  Smoking  Mountains  into  his  private  stronghold.  The

Father of Victories called his new fortress the Citadel of Black

Ash, after the swampy quagmire of volcanic ash surrounding

the mountains base.

When Gilgeams loyal clerics and high champions were forced

to  ee the riots that followed their god-kings death, the citadel

became their secret sanctuary. For years, the generals plotted

their return to power while the priests prayed for the return

of their god-king. Meanwhile, soldiers mined the mountains

tunnels extensively for gems to  nance the upcoming war.

The  efforts  of  Gilgeams  faithful  ended  in  1372,  when

volcanic activity covered the citadel in a superheated cloud of

 ery ash, killing almost everyone inside. The structure is now

almost  completely  buried  in  ash,  which  helps  to  protect  the

gemstones, weapons, and divine magic items that lie within its

vaults. Dozens of huecuvasthe undead remains of Gilgeams

clericsnow haunt the place.

GOD-TOMBS

When  the  gods  of  Unther  died,  they  were  entombed  in   at-

topped ziggurats far from civilized areas. Inanna, Girru, Ki,

Marduk, Nanna-Sin, Nergal, Ramman, and Utu were all laid

to rest in this manner, but Gilgeams body was never recovered

for burial.

Because the Untheric priests feared public disgrace if the

slumber of their gods was disturbed, they  lled the ziggurats

with traps and other hazards to deter thievery. The sarcophagus

of each dead god was placed deep within its ziggurats mazelike

system of rooms and passages. Mechanical traps, many contain-

ing virulent poison, were placed in halls and door locks. The

traps were rigged so that either disabling or springing one would

activate  others,  creating  a  cascade  of  deadly  effects.  Finally,

Gargantuan stone golems were built into various chambers so

as to appear part of the walls.

GREAT BARROW

Just off the Great Road, near the southernmost portion of the

Rawlinswood in the Great Dale, lies the Great Barrow, a massive

burial mound ringed by numerous smaller mounds. The Great

Barrow was built in the heady days of the First Untheric Empire

as a tomb for the slain Untheric god Nergal. Gilgeam oversaw

the  gods  lavish  burial  and  sealed  Nergals  still-living  family

and servants inside the lesser tombs surrounding that of the

deity. Once all the tombs had been buried under earthen hills,

Gilgeam slaughtered the builders, raised them as undead crypt

things, and set them to guard Nergal and his family.

Travelers  in  the  area  of  the  Great  Barrow  often  report

encountering skeletal undead that choke and gasp as if desper-

ately trying to breathe. Whether these creatures are Gilgeams

appointed  crypt-things  or  the  restless  undead  remnants  of

Nergals family remains a mystery.

UNTHALASS

The decrepit former capital of Unther has suffered terribly from

natural disasters and centuries of neglect. Great  oods have twice

destroyed huge sections of Unthalass, submerging entire city

blocks under mud and muck. Such damage was rarely repaired;

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

Gilgeam simply ordered new structures built over the old. The

buried areas of Unthalass now form a sizable undercity, which

is populated primarily by wererats and lamias.

The largest ruin in Unthalass is the Ziggurat of Eternal

Victorythe  glorious  palace  of  the  god-king  Gilgeam.  The

palace once stood 300 feet high and boasted sixteen tiers of

blue-enameled brick decorated with gold, silver, brass, and other

precious metals. Beneath the ziggurat lay a labyrinthine complex

of lower levels and tunnels in which the Gilgeamite priests ran

Unthers bureaucracy.

Almost  fteen  years  ago,  Gilgeams  titanic  battle  with

Tiamat shattered the aboveground portion of the pyramid palace

and  scattered  Gilgeams  faithful.  The  ziggurat  has  remained

deserted  ever  since.  Today,  the  palace  ruins  are  patrolled  by

Mulhorandi soldiers who have orders to prevent any plundering

of Gilgeams fabled wealth. The general of Mulhorands armies

in Unthalass, Lord Khemenhet (LG human male paladin 8

of Horus-Re/glorious servitor 7 of Horus-Re) is preparing to

excavate  the  Ziggurat  of  Eternal  Victory.  He  seeks  worthy

volunteers  among  the  glorious  servitors  of  Mulhorand  to

enter  the  deadly  pyramid  and  return  its  fabled  treasures  to

the pharaoh.

Legacies of the

Old Empires

Innumerable relics of the past litter the lands of the East. The

few adventure options described here merely scratch the surface

of the campaign potential in these exotic lands.

Adventure Seeds

In kingdoms where gods lived among their people and demons

were gladly welcomed as allies, the opportunities for exciting

and unusual adventurers seem unlimited.

THE DEMON-BOND

Several persons reported missing in Thesk and the Great Dale

have turned up months later with endish physical attributes.

They have no memory of what befell them, but they are clearly

no longer the humans and orcs they once were. As the news

of these events has become public, panic has spread through

both countries. Ofcials have placed the blame on an airborne

plague, but the real culprit is Amurrul (CE male human wizard

13/Nar demonbinderUna 3), a demented wizard who has studied

the dark sorcery of ancient Narfell (see page 71). Amurrul is

now searching for stronger victims from which he can create

even more powerful half-ends.

THE GODSFLESH GOLEM

Dismayed over the destruction of the Untheric pantheon, Nidiba

(LE female human cleric 13 of Gilgeam) has been laboring to

construct a golem from the dead esh of the old gods. Over

the past ten years, she has broken into various god-tombs and

burial  pyramids  to  acquire  the  mummied  remains  of  dead

Untheric manifestations and the incarnations of Mulhorandi

deities. Nidiba believes that the godsesh golem she is creating

will possess the abilities of an avatar and be powerful enough

to punish the offending Mulhorandi dynasty. Glorious servi-

tors  in  Mulhorand  are  aware  of  the  thefts  from  the  tombs

of their gods, but they have not linked these incidents to the

grave-robbing in Unther.

Buried Secrets

The evil mages of the Unapproachable East hid away some of

their foulest creations in secret dungeons and towers that have

now fallen into ruin. Many of these ancient hiding spots have

gone unnoticed and undisturbed for centuries.

FORGOTTEN RAUMATHARI ARSENAL

Near the end of the war with Narfell, desperate Raumathari

battlemages created prototype constructs with which to destroy

their enemies. Unfortunately, the Raumvirans were destroyed

before they could test their new constructs. Dozens of bizarre,

golemlike machines and constructs with names such as Dread-

naught and Fiend-Render can be found in ruins throughout the

ancient Raumathari lands.

IMASKARI TORTURE CHAMBERS

Scornful of gods yet also fearful of them, Imaskari articers

abducted untold numbers of priests, druids, shamans, and other

divine  spellcasters  from  across  Faern  and  placed  them  in

extradimensional prisons. Protected by wards and barriers that

prevented the captives from communicating with their gods, the

Imaskari articers conducted cruel experiments to determine

the nature of divine magic. The results of this research enabled

the Imaskari to create a host of spells and magic items that

targeted divine spellcasters, including the epic-level spell that

sealed off Toril from the Mulhorandi gods.

The victims of Imaskari torture are long gone, but hundreds

of ancient godly symbols and divine relicssome from gods

long deadlie forgotten in these torture chambers. A few of

these items are artifacts that could bring about unimaginable

disasters if they were to fall into the wrong hands.

Heirs to the Empire

Empires such as Imaskar and Raumathar may be long gone, but

their citizens descendants still live in Faern today. Mulhorand

and Unther still exist, but many descendants of their former

citizens have broken away from their parent kingdoms.

CHESSENTA

The warring cities of this fractious land were founded by Untheri

citizens during their empires rst rise to power. Plagued by the

political and religious oppression of their tyrannical masters, the

cities of Chessenta eventually broke away from their decrepit

parent,  forsaking  the  Untheric  ways  as  well  as  the  Untheric

gods. But the inuence of Unther is still visible in the many

Untheric ruinsincluding temples, ziggurats, and abandoned

fortressesthat still stand in many Chessentan cities.

DEEP IMASKAR

About four thousand years ago, a group of Imaskari survivors

sought refuge in the Underdark from their wrathful ex-slaves.

These  refugees  constructed  a  city  called  Deep  Imaskar  far

beneath the Endless Wastes and employed epic magic to seal it

off from the outside world. Now, after millennia of isolation,

a few Deep Imaskari have begun to leave their great city and

explore the world their ancestors abandoned. But most citizens

of Deep Imaskar retain their desire for isolation, so the minds

of these would-be explorers are wiped clean of any knowledge

of their native citys existence when they leave its gates. Under-

standably, the Deep Imaskari harbor strong suspicions about

any humans of Mulan descent.

MULHORAND

The lore of the ancient East is better preserved in Mulhorand

than  in  any  other  area.  An  unbroken  line  of  deic  rulers

stretches back almost three thousand years to the days when

the Mulan slaves overthrew their Imaskari lords. The presence

of  the  Mulhorandi  deities  as  physical  incarnations  kept  the

empires past alive for many years, and the glorious servitors

have taken on the burden of preservation now that their deities

incarnations have been laid to rest. Because the Mulhorandi

have always been exacting historians, temple libraries and mage

towers throughout the empire are lled with precise accounts

of the great events of old.

Now that the physical manifestations of the Mulhorandi

deities are no more, humans have taken on the burden of ruling

Mulhorand. The country remains an absolute theocracy, and its

leaders have recently embarked on a new campaign to conquer

Unther.  The  invasion  of  Unther  marks  a  new  age  of  divine

imperialism that could spread the Mulhorandi faith far and

wide, and perhaps even bring about a new golden age in an old

empire. Mulhorandi clerics and champions have been directed

to  explore  their  nations  other  neighbors  and  assess  whether

they too might benet from joining the empire.

NARFELL

Little remains of the Empire of Narfell, but the Nar people

live on as savage, horse-riding barbarians in the north. More

than a dozen nomadic Nar tribes claim the frigid plains south

of the Great Glacier and north of the Rawlinswood as their

rightful ancestral lands.

The  Nars  retain  little  memory  of  their  imperial  past,

and they preserve few of Narfells ancient traditions. Unlike

the  Witches  of  Rashemen,  who  still  hold  many  secrets  of

Raumathars ancient magic, the Nars have forgotten the dark

and  terrible  power  that  their  forebears  commanded  fteen

centuries ago. In fact, the Nars regard those who open tombs

and plunder ruins as dangerous fools who are all too likely to

hurt other people with their reckless prying. Thus, the Nar tribes

often go out of their way to drive off or kill any adventurers

they catch exploring ancient Nar ruins.

considering options for independence. The ruler of Semphr,

Caliph Abu Bakr (LN male human ghter 16), is still quietly

pursuing his dream of establishing his own empire and hoping

that he can nd some ancient magic with which to defend his

kingdom from the armies of Skuld. He recently dispatched an

expedition to the buried city of Solon to search out an Imas-

kari temple known to contain four black artifacts of ancient

Imaskari make.

THAY

The ruling class of Thay, like that of Mulhorand, is composed

entirely of Mulan humans. In terms of its values and methods,

however, Thay resembles ancient Imaskar more than it does

ancient Mulhorand. Like the Imaskari Empire, Thay is a land

in which wizards rule supreme, and gods and divine magic are

regarded with some suspicion. In the four centuries since Thays

successful rebellion against Mulhorand, the Red Wizards have

expanded  their  domains  from  the  fertile  plateau  of  Thay  to

the Priador, the mouth of the Lapendrar, the Wizards Reach,

the borderlands of Thesk, and the slopes of the Sunrise Moun-

tains. Although the Red Wizards have not managed to subdue

Aglarond or Rashemen, Thay dominates the eastern shores of

the Sea of the Fallen Stars, posing an ever-present threat whose

true power has not yet been measured.

UNTHER

The ancient nation of Unther appears to be facing its doom at

last. In less than one year, Mulhorand has succeeded in conquer-

ing the majority of Unthers holdings, leaving only a remnant

of land around the old city of Messemprar. Chaos and disorder

now reign throughout the nation of Unther.

The only obstacles in the path of further Mulhorandi con-

quests are the various warlords who bicker and feud constantly

over land. Some of these are Untheric nobles, others are Gil-

geamite clerics who have forsworn their previous allegiance, and

still others are nothing more than local bandit lords. Mulhorand

could crush any one of these groups with ease, but it lacks the

military strength to crush them all at once.

The leaders of Unther, such as they are, are divided into three

broad factions. The rst consists of Untheri who seek peace with

Mulhorand and are willing to become vassals of the pharaoh in

exchange for the power to crush their rivals. In the second faction

are those who favor the surviving nobles of Unther as leaders and

regard an Untheric kingeven one who once served Gilgeamas

preferable to either chaos or conquest. The third faction, which

is popular among the disaffected common folk, is composed of

true revolutionaries who would sweep away all vestiges of the old

order, and throw the Mulhorandi out as well.

To complicate matters further, the Red Wizards of Thay

have decided that Mulhorand cant be allowed to conquer all

of Unther uncontested. They have been offering covert support

to the surviving nobles in the rst two factions, but not the

third, since they have no use for revolutionaries of any sort.

SEMPHR AND MURGHM

The leaders of these semiautonomous protectorates of Mulho-

rand have grown fearful about the invasion of Unther and are

WITCHES OF RASHEMEN

The Witches of Rashemen (or Wychlaran) are members of an

ancient order of female spellcasters that emerged shortly after

centuries ago. In fact, the Nars regard those who open tombs

and plunder ruins as dangerous fools who are all too likely to

hurt other people with their reckless prying. Thus, the Nar tribes

often go out of their way to drive off or kill any adventurers

they catch exploring ancient Nar ruins.

considering options for independence. The ruler of Semphr,

Caliph Abu Bakr (LN male human ghter 16), is still quietly

pursuing his dream of establishing his own empire and hoping

that he can nd some ancient magic with which to defend his

kingdom from the armies of Skuld. He recently dispatched an

expedition to the buried city of Solon to search out an Imas-

kari temple known to contain four black artifacts of ancient

Imaskari make.

THAY

The ruling class of Thay, like that of Mulhorand, is composed

entirely of Mulan humans. In terms of its values and methods,

however, Thay resembles ancient Imaskar more than it does

ancient Mulhorand. Like the Imaskari Empire, Thay is a land

in which wizards rule supreme, and gods and divine magic are

regarded with some suspicion. In the four centuries since Thays

successful rebellion against Mulhorand, the Red Wizards have

expanded  their  domains  from  the  fertile  plateau  of  Thay  to

the Priador, the mouth of the Lapendrar, the Wizards Reach,

the borderlands of Thesk, and the slopes of the Sunrise Moun-

tains. Although the Red Wizards have not managed to subdue

Aglarond or Rashemen, Thay dominates the eastern shores of

the Sea of the Fallen Stars, posing an ever-present threat whose

true power has not yet been measured.

UNTHER

The ancient nation of Unther appears to be facing its doom at

last. In less than one year, Mulhorand has succeeded in conquer-

ing the majority of Unthers holdings, leaving only a remnant

of land around the old city of Messemprar. Chaos and disorder

now reign throughout the nation of Unther.

The only obstacles in the path of further Mulhorandi con-

quests are the various warlords who bicker and feud constantly

over land. Some of these are Untheric nobles, others are Gil-

geamite clerics who have forsworn their previous allegiance, and

still others are nothing more than local bandit lords. Mulhorand

could crush any one of these groups with ease, but it lacks the

military strength to crush them all at once.

The leaders of Unther, such as they are, are divided into three

broad factions. The rst consists of Untheri who seek peace with

Mulhorand and are willing to become vassals of the pharaoh in

exchange for the power to crush their rivals. In the second faction

are those who favor the surviving nobles of Unther as leaders and

regard an Untheric kingeven one who once served Gilgeamas

preferable to either chaos or conquest. The third faction, which

is popular among the disaffected common folk, is composed of

true revolutionaries who would sweep away all vestiges of the old

order, and throw the Mulhorandi out as well.

To complicate matters further, the Red Wizards of Thay

have decided that Mulhorand cant be allowed to conquer all

of Unther uncontested. They have been offering covert support

to the surviving nobles in the rst two factions, but not the

third, since they have no use for revolutionaries of any sort.

SEMPHR AND MURGHM

The leaders of these semiautonomous protectorates of Mulho-

rand have grown fearful about the invasion of Unther and are

WITCHES OF RASHEMEN

The Witches of Rashemen (or Wychlaran) are members of an

ancient order of female spellcasters that emerged shortly after

Sonjars Tower

In the shadows of the Giants Belt Mountains, half buried under

the purple sands of the Raurin Desert, lies an abandoned arcane

tower dating back to the downfall of ancient Imaskar. This tower

once belonged to the arti cer Sonjar, a senior wizard in service

to the lord arti cer during the empires  nal days.

This adventure is suitable for 11th-level characters.

Background

Sonjars tower was built inside a gigantic geodea naturally

formed,  hollow,  egg-shaped  stone  lined  with  crystals.  From

the outside, it looks like just another outcropping of stonea

rounded crag that rises about 50 feet above the desert  oor.

The interior resembles a great cavern whose walls are lined with

amethyst crystals. The geode has no physical entrance, but a

portal on its outer surface permits access. Within the geode,

Sonjars windowless tower rises 60 feet above the  oor.

Durdyn, a drow sellsword, has recently taken over the tower.

He and his band of mercenaries (known as Durdyns Devils) were

hired by House Vrasl of Undrek-thoz, which is located in the

eastern Underdark. Their mission is to investigate legends that

ancient humans of the Raurin Desert possessed magic capable

of thwarting the gods. With such magic, the matron mothers

hope to uncover the reason for Lolths silence at last.

The Earth Node

Sonjar was initially attracted to this geode by the concentration

of earth power that it embodies. A class 1 earth node extends

160 feet from the exterior of the geode, a class 2 node extends

80 feet from its exterior, and its entire interior is a class 3 earth

node. (See Underdark for more information on earth nodes.)

Any  creature  that  comes  within  190  feet  of  the  geodes

exterior can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to sense the

concentration of earth power around the geode. A spellcaster

who is aware of the earth node can attempt to add its power to

his spells. With a successful Spellcraft check, he can increase

his effective caster level by an amount equal to the value of

the layer in which he currently stands. The DC for the check

is 10 in the class 1 section (+1 increase), 15 in the class 2 sec-

tion (+2 increase), or 20 in the class 3 section (+3 increase). A

character with the Node Magic feat can also access the earth

nodes granted spells, as given on Table 42, below.

Sonjars Tower

73

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

The archway holds a functioning portal programmed to grant

entrance  only  to  living  creatures.  This  feature  protects  the

interior  of  the  geode  from  sand  and  weather.  The  portal  is

transparent so that viewers can see their destination (the geode

plaza; see area 2).

Recent sandstorms revealed the top of the geode to Shianax,

Durdyns brown dragon ally, who dug a path in the sand to the

20-foot-diameter, semicircular entrance.

2. GEODE PLAZA

The crystalline walls and ceiling of this unusual cavern radiate

a sparkling display of soft light and color that bathes the interior

in gentle twilight. An aged plaza of purple-gray stone extends

in all directions to the cavern walls. Nearby stands a curiously

angular, windowless tower that is nearly tall enough to touch the

cavern ceiling. A stone archway in its base appears to offer the

only access. To the left of the tower stands a small stone building,

and to the right are three tear-shaped pools. The caverns left

wall is lined with metallic doorways built into the crystal.

The  plaza  offers  the  towers  residents  a  pleasant  spot  for

contemplation.

Creatures: Durdyns mercenaries occasionally stroll around the

plaza or step outside the geode altogether. The dragon Shianax

also passes through this area a couple of times a day, emerging

from area 11 to exit the geode and hunt in the desert nearby.

Mercenaries: Arrak and Rayeth (see area 13).

Shianax: See area 11 for statistics.

3. TOWER ENTRANCE

The odd tower stands about 60 feet tall. Except for a 10-foot-

wide  archway  lled  with  blank  stone  at  the  base,  it  has  no

windows, doors, or other exterior features. Some owing script

graces the keystone of the arch.

The stone arch is the entrance to the tower, but it contains no

door or portcullis. The arch is a portal that conveys anyone

touching it to some point within. A user who speaks a destina-

tion (one, two, three, or exit) aloud in Roushoum, the ancient

language of the Imaskari, is conveyed to area 12, 14, 19, or

back to area 3, respectively. The portal understands no other

languages. If no destination is specied in that language, the

user is transported to the waiting room (area 12). This variable

portal is marked with a V at each destination, since it can be

used in the same way from any oor of the tower.

The Roushoum runes (Decipher Script DC 30) read: Sonjar,

Articer, Master of the Amethyst Tower.

4. POOLS

These three teardrop-shaped pools were built of ceramic tiles,

some  of  which  have  cracked  with  age.  The  water  inside  is

muddy but appears drinkable.

Sonjars slaves once drew their water from these pools. Fresh

water trickles into the bottom of each one from a miniature

portal to the Elemental Plane of Water.

5. SLAVE BARRACKS (EL 11)

These four iron-framed doorways have no doors. Each of the

rst three has a pile of dust in front of it, and only the crystal

wall of the cavern can be seen beyond it. A glance through the

fourth doorway reveals a dull gray room in which four strange,

misty humanoid gures drift, seemingly frozen.

These four doorways once led to extradimensional spaces that

were used as slave barracks. The entrance to each room was a

portal with an iron-rimmed frame built into the wall of the

geode. The magic sustaining three of the barracks has collapsed,

depositing their dusty contents in front of the entrances.

5A. INHABITED BARRACKS

The surviving entrance (area 5a) leads to an intact barracks

room. The furniture, clothing, and personal possessions of the

slaves in this chamber have long since turned to dust.

The portal is unkeyed for entry but keyed for exit. Further-

more, it allows those outside the space to see in, but those inside

see only a gray wall when they look at the exit.

Any creature that enters the slave barracks cannot exit unless

it has access to a spell such as phase door or teleport, or someone

on the outside calls its name. A successful DC 20 Spellcraft check

reveals that a specic key is needed to free a person trapped in

the barracks, but it does not reveal the keys nature.

Creatures: Four thousand years ago, at the time of the slave

uprising, a Mulan overseer named Imket (see area 6), who was loyal

to Sonjar, forced a handful of slaves into their barracks (area 5a)

before returning to his own quarters. Trapped in their room when

Sonjar died, the four slaves perished of starvation, only to rise later as

spectres. They ceased moving long ago and look like oating statues

to outside observers. Durdyn ordered his crew not to disturb them,

since they didnt seem capable of escaping on their own.

Spectres (4): hp 32 each; see Monster Manual, page 232.

Tactics: The spectres have never had the opportunity to touch

living esh, and they are eager to do so. Thus, they attack any

living creature that enters the barracks.

Development: If all the characters become stuck in the slave

barracks with no means of egress, a group of NPC adventurers

eventually happens by and notices their predicament. The PCs

cant talk through the portal, but one of the NPCs could safely

enter,  speak  to  the  trapped  PCs  long  enough  to  learn  their

names, then be retrieved by another NPC outside.

6. OVERSEERS BARRACKS (EL 11)

The oor of this plain gray stone chamber is covered with a

few inches of dust. A trembling human with pale, cracked skin

and studded leather armor leans against the wall. He stares

vacantly  at  the  ceiling,  seemingly  unaware  that  he  is  being

watched. Clutched in his st is a whip of black leather.

Similar in function to the slave barracks, this extradimensional

room  once  housed  Sonjars  overseers.  Unlike  the  slaves,  the

overseers were free to come and go from their quarters during

daylight hours. To enter or exit the room from sunrise to sunset,

a character need only touch the portal. During the night, the

portal allows only entry.

Creature:  The  pitiful  creature  in  this  room  was  Imket,

Sonjars  favorite  slave.  In  life,  Imket  was  a  capable  hunter

and  a  cruel  overseer.  During  the  uprising,  he  grew  fearful

of  angering  his  master  and  forcibly  returned  a  handful  of

slaves (see area 5a) to their barracks. Sonjar never returned

to the tower, and Imket survived for years as the geodes sole

occupant. Years later, he nally died alone, still believing that

his wrathful master was punishing him by cursing him and

imprisoning him here. At odd intervals, Imket exits the room

and wanders the geode, but sometimes tendays or months pass

between his forays. He has not emerged since Durdyns Devils

moved into the geode.

long as he has at least 1 hit point remaining.

Turning Immunity (Ex): Imket cannot be turned, rebuked,

destroyed, or commanded.

Undead Traits: Imket is immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works

on objects or is harmless. He is not subject to extra damage from

critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to his physical

ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion,

or  death  from  massive  damage.  He  cannot  be  raised,  and

resurrection works only if he is willing. He has darkvision out

to 60 feet.

Unkillable  (Ex):  The  only  ways  to  destroy  Imket  perma-

nently are to destroy his body (by total immersion in acid, or

a disintegrate or undeath to death spell, for example) or remove

the curse that keeps him from dying. The caster of the remove

curse spell must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check to suc-

cessfully remove the curse.

Possessions: +2 studded leather armor, +3 scourge, gloves of

Dexterity +2.

7. KITCHEN

Scalding  steam  billows  out  of  this  iron-framed  archway,  ob-

structing any view of what lies inside.

This extradimensional space once served as the kitchen. In this

chamber, slaves prepared the foods brought back by Sonjars

hunting parties.

A metal table, a glazed ceramic sink, and a cooking hearth

stained  with  soot  are  the  only  items  left  intact.  The  sink  is

equipped with a spigot-shaped portal that connects to the Elemen-

tal Plane of Water. In like manner, the hearth is connected to

the Elemental Plane of Fire. Both portals were left open by the

slave chef when he ed to join the uprising. The ceaseless mixing

of water and re has lled the kitchen with clouds of heated

steam, which escape through the doorway. (See page 303 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide for the effects of extreme heat.)

A tiny, circular hole on the oor in the northern corner

is  another  portal  that  was  used  for  trash  disposal.  Tiny  or

smaller objects and creatures placed upon it are automatically

transported to the refuse pit (area 9). The excess water falling

from the sink also drains out through this portal.

The table is also a portal. On a verbal command, it imme-

diately transports any inanimate objects upon it to the dining

table in the grand hall (area 13). The slaves delivered Sonjars

meals to him in this manner.

8. LARDER

Meat brought back by Sonjars hunting parties was cured and

stored in this extradimensional larder. All foodstuffs kept in

here have long since crumbled into dust.

9. REFUSE PIT (EL 4)

To one side of the stone plaza is a rusted iron trapdoor. Faint

streamers of mist seep up around its edges.

This 5-foot-by-5-foot iron trapdoor is about 1/2 inch thick. It

covers the opening to a pit 15 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter.

The oor of the pit is ooded to a depth of 4 feet.

With the arrival of Durdyn and his followers, the ancient

10. AIR PORTALS

The walls of the geode are dotted with small, one-way portals

leading to and from the Elemental Plane of Air. Only a handful

of them still function, bringing fresh air (and sometimes lesser

elementals) into the geode and returning the stale air whence it

came. The winds rushing through these damaged portals sound

vaguely like the wails of a keening spirit (see City of the Spider

Q ueen), though they cause no ill effects.

11. MONSTER KENNEL (EL 11)

This stone building has a wide archway with no door. Slitlike

sots pierce the upper walls, creating a row of small, high win-

dows along the sides.

Once the kennel where Sonjar kept his prized monsters, this

building is now home to a temperamental brown dragon named

Shianax.

Creature: The dragon is serving as a desert guide for Durdyns

Devils. Durdyn pays for her service with gold and gems.

Sorcerer Spells Known (caster level 3rd): 0daze, detect

Tactics:  Shianax  attempts  to  parley  with  newcomers  to

ascertain  their  motives.  Intruders  who  might  be  allies  are

ushered into the grand hall for a meeting with Durdyn. If

a party of adventurers seems hostile but easily intimidated,

Shianax tries to chase them out of the geode before calling

for reinforcements. The dragon ees from intruders who pose

a serious threat.

Treasure: Most of Shianaxs personal treasure is in her lair,

which is a rocky crag a days march away. She keeps the gold

and gems that Durdyn has paid her beneath a loose agstone

in the back of the kennel (Search DC 15). The hoard includes

1,150 gp, 35 pp, ve tourmalines (50 gp each), a ne peridot

(200 gp), and two rubies (400 gp each).

12. WAITING HALL

Faded  frescoes  of  ancient  human  spellcasters  decorate  the

12-foot-high walls of this hall. A pile of splinters and frayed

fabric that might once have been an upholstered chair lies on

the oor by the western wall. A door to either side of the foyer

and two archways provide egress.

This hall originally served as a waiting room for those seeking

audience with Sonjar. One of the two doors leads to a cloakroom,

the other to a washroom. The archways lead east into a larger

room beyond.

The portal here functions like the one described in area 3.

If no destination is designated, it conveys the user to area 3.

13. GRAND HALL (EL 11)

This  magnicent  chamber  has  a  20-foot-high,  domed  ceiling.

The  stone  walls  and  the  dome  are  painted  with  images  of

stern-faced men and women holding various icons, including a

map, a large egg, a silver rod, and a ball of light. The room is

furnished with a single granite-topped dining table and a few

piles of dust that might once have been other tables or chairs.

In  the  east  wall  is  a  large  window  that  looks  out  on  a  vast

glacial landscape, as if the tower were perched on the side of

a mountain.

The east wall is a transparent portal that displays one of several

specic scenic locales, as directed by its user. The portal permits

neither creatures nor objects to pass through; its sole purpose

is aesthetic.

Durdyn has gured out how to change the view that the

portal  displays,  but  he  mistakenly  believes  that  it  has  other

functions he has not yet discovered.

Creatures: At least two of Durdyns followersusually Arrak

Abaeir and Rayeth  el Kapynare on guard in this room at

any time. Arrak serves as Durdyns right hand and keeps an eye

on the activities of his other followers. Rayeth is a half-drow

recruited from the streets of Undrek-thoz. An outcast and an

orphan,  he  impressed  Durdyn  not  only  with  his  exceptional

ghting skills but also with his open disdain of the ruling drow

matriarchy.

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

GOD-KINGS OF THE EAST

a character need only touch the portal. During the night, the

portal allows only entry.

Creature:  The  pitiful  creature  in  this  room  was  Imket,

Sonjars  favorite  slave.  In  life,  Imket  was  a  capable  hunter

and  a  cruel  overseer.  During  the  uprising,  he  grew  fearful

of  angering  his  master  and  forcibly  returned  a  handful  of

slaves (see area 5a) to their barracks. Sonjar never returned

to the tower, and Imket survived for years as the geodes sole

occupant. Years later, he nally died alone, still believing that

his wrathful master was punishing him by cursing him and

imprisoning him here. At odd intervals, Imket exits the room

and wanders the geode, but sometimes tendays or months pass

between his forays. He has not emerged since Durdyns Devils

moved into the geode.

Imket:  Male  human  curst  ghter  10;  CR  11;  Medium

tion (scourge).

Languages: Mulhorandi, Roushoum.

Fast Healing (Ex): Imket regains 1 hit point per round as

long as he has at least 1 hit point remaining.

Turning Immunity (Ex): Imket cannot be turned, rebuked,

destroyed, or commanded.

Undead Traits: Imket is immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works

on objects or is harmless. He is not subject to extra damage from

critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to his physical

ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion,

or  death  from  massive  damage.  He  cannot  be  raised,  and

resurrection works only if he is willing. He has darkvision out

to 60 feet.

Unkillable  (Ex):  The  only  ways  to  destroy  Imket  perma-

nently are to destroy his body (by total immersion in acid, or

a disintegrate or undeath to death spell, for example) or remove

the curse that keeps him from dying. The caster of the remove

curse spell must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check to suc-

cessfully remove the curse.

Possessions: +2 studded leather armor, +3 scourge, gloves of

Dexterity +2.

7. KITCHEN

Scalding  steam  billows  out  of  this  iron-framed  archway,  ob-

structing any view of what lies inside.

This extradimensional space once served as the kitchen. In this

chamber, slaves prepared the foods brought back by Sonjars

hunting parties.

A metal table, a glazed ceramic sink, and a cooking hearth

stained  with  soot  are  the  only  items  left  intact.  The  sink  is

equipped with a spigot-shaped portal that connects to the Elemen-

tal Plane of Water. In like manner, the hearth is connected to

the Elemental Plane of Fire. Both portals were left open by the

slave chef when he ed to join the uprising. The ceaseless mixing

of water and re has lled the kitchen with clouds of heated

steam, which escape through the doorway. (See page 303 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide for the effects of extreme heat.)

A tiny, circular hole on the oor in the northern corner

is  another  portal  that  was  used  for  trash  disposal.  Tiny  or

smaller objects and creatures placed upon it are automatically

transported to the refuse pit (area 9). The excess water falling

from the sink also drains out through this portal.

The table is also a portal. On a verbal command, it imme-

diately transports any inanimate objects upon it to the dining

table in the grand hall (area 13). The slaves delivered Sonjars

meals to him in this manner.

8. LARDER

Meat brought back by Sonjars hunting parties was cured and

stored in this extradimensional larder. All foodstuffs kept in

here have long since crumbled into dust.

9. REFUSE PIT (EL 4)

To one side of the stone plaza is a rusted iron trapdoor. Faint

streamers of mist seep up around its edges.

This 5-foot-by-5-foot iron trapdoor is about 1/2 inch thick. It

covers the opening to a pit 15 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter.

The oor of the pit is ooded to a depth of 4 feet.

With the arrival of Durdyn and his followers, the ancient

gray  ooze  that  lives  in  the  pit  became  active  after  a  long

dormant period.

Iron Trapdoor: 1/2 in. thick, hardness 10, hp 20, Strength

DC 23 to lift.

Gray Ooze (1): hp 31; see Monster Manual, page 202.

10. AIR PORTALS

The walls of the geode are dotted with small, one-way portals

leading to and from the Elemental Plane of Air. Only a handful

of them still function, bringing fresh air (and sometimes lesser

elementals) into the geode and returning the stale air whence it

came. The winds rushing through these damaged portals sound

vaguely like the wails of a keening spirit (see City of the Spider

Q ueen), though they cause no ill effects.

11. MONSTER KENNEL (EL 11)

This stone building has a wide archway with no door. Slitlike

sots pierce the upper walls, creating a row of small, high win-

dows along the sides.

Once the kennel where Sonjar kept his prized monsters, this

building is now home to a temperamental brown dragon named

Shianax.

Devils. Durdyn pays for her service with gold and gems.

Tactics: Anyone entering the tower without Shianax as an

escort is assumed to be hostile and attacked by Rayeth and Arrak.

The two mercenaries coordinate their attacks, trying to take

down the opponents that resemble ghters rst. Arrak shoots

as many of his poison-tipped arrows as possible before engaging

in melee. Rayeth trips foes with his spiked chain, leaving them

vulnerable to sneak attacks from Arrak.

14. ARTIFICE CHAMBER

A stone table occupies the center of this room. In the southwest

corner, a massive black iron oven lies on its side. On the walls

are four blank archways similar to the one at the base of the

tower.  Several  shelves  lining  the  south  wall  hold  tarnished

religious  symbols,  empty  bottles,  and  notes  written  in  ancient

script.

This  chamber  once  served  as  Sonjars  laboratory,  torture

chamber, and workshop. He conducted experiments, interroga-

tions, and other arcane investigations on creatures secured to

his table.

The archways are all portals. The one on the east wall func-

tions like the portal at the base of the tower (area 3), except

that it allows travel to the towers other oors. If no destination

is given, it transports the user to area 3.

The portals connecting with areas 15 and 17 are opaque from

this side, but those leading to areas 16 and 18 are transparent

so that characters in this room can see beyond them. The portal

from area 15 is transparent from the other side, so the two drow

in that chamber can see intruders and prepare for combat.

15. LIBRARY (EL 12)

Rows of shelves made of softly glowing magical force line the

walls of this chamber. On the shelves are hundreds of crum-

bling scrolls, pieces of yellowed parchment, and leather-bound

tomes.

Sonjars library contains books penned by numerous Imaskari

articers throughout the empires history. These aged works are

very brittle, and most crumble to dust if touched.

Karushon,  a  senior  mage  of  House  Vrasl,  was  assigned

to accompany Durdyn and oversee the activities of his band.

The  wizard  spends  a  signicant  amount  of  his  time  casting

amanuensisMag to copy the information from this library for

his matron. He is always accompanied by his drow sister Xian,

an arachnomancerUnd who has long been considered the black

sheep of House Vrasl because of her decision to study arcane

magic. During Lolths silence, she has positioned herself to seize

control of House Vrasl upon returning home.

If either Karushon or Xian observes intruders in the arti-

cer room (area 20), both prepare for battle. Karushon casts

deeper darkness, then begins casting offensive spells. Xian uses

her spiderform ability to become a Large monstrous spider, then

grapples an opponent to deliver her strength-sapping, poisonous

touch.

Beyond this doorway lies an empty chamber built of feature-

less gray stone. The air seems to waver and icker from time

to time, and when it does, the room beyond slowly twists and

warps.

The magic supporting this empty extradimensional space has

decayed signicantly, causing it to blink in and out of existence.

The iron forge that once occupied it was dumped onto the oor

of the laboratory (area 14) when the room rst blinked out.

The magic of the room continues to function intermittently.

Anyone inside it when the magic fails falls into the lab, taking

1d6 points of damage. The room reappears in 1d8 rounds and

19. CHAMBER OF EARTHSTARS (EL 4)

This  chamber  appears  to  have  no  ceiling.  Numerous  tro-

phiesincluding  a  beholder  skull,  a  huge  dinosaur  bone,  a

complete elf skeleton, and the preserved head of some angelic

creaturehang on the walls.

This  chamber  was  Sonjars  trophy  room.  Each  of  the  four

alcoves contains a transparent portal that leads to a destination

in some other part of the lost Imaskari Empire.

On the west wall is a portal that connects with areas 14,

12, and 3, and it works like the portal described in area 3. If

no destination is specied, the user is transported to area 3.

On the east wall is a portal that connects with Sonjars cham-

bers (area 20). This one is opaque on this side but transparent

on the other. Durdyn uses it to spot anyone poking around in

this chamber so that he can ready himself for combat.

Several  oor-to-ceiling  viewing  portals  are  interspersed

around the perimeter of this chamber.

Trap: Each trophy in this chamber is trapped with a single

glyph of warding that activates when touched.

Glyph  of  Warding  (Blast):  CR  4;  spell,  spell  trigger,  no

reset; spell effect (glyph of warding [blast], 10th-level cleric,

5d8 electricity, Ref DC 14 half); multiple targets (all targets

within 5 ft.); Search DC 28; Disable Device DC 28.

Development: A member of Durdyns Devils passed through

a corner portal in this room some time ago and never returned.

Durdyn is considering whether to go after the lost sellsword or

hire adventurers to rescue him.

20. SONJARS CHAMBERS (EL 13)

The ceiling of this luxurious bedchamber is 15 feet high, and

the walls are decorated with frescoes reminiscent of the four

elements. On the oor along the north wall is a line of decayed

and frayed silken oor pillows that once formed a sprawling

bed. An aged desk and a chair lie in pieces in the southern por-

tion of the room. Several doorways appear to lead nowhere.

The portal on the south wall allows travel to the towers other

oors. It is otherwise identical to the portals in areas 3 and 20.

Nezram the World-Walker

Nezram, a Mulhorandi wizard known as the World-Walker, has

returned to Faern after an absence of nearly seven hundred

years. Though he is a master of transportation magic, portals,

and planewalking, the World-Walker is perhaps best known for

his love of gem-based magic.

Rumors of a ying Netherese city and a surviving colony

of his peoples ancient enemies drew Nezram back to Faern.

The World-Walker is concerned that a heretofore  unknown

Imaskari realm could pose a threat to his beloved empire.

Upon his return, Nezram found his old tower in ruins and

his spellbook missing. With the assistance of his living descen-

dants, the Nezramites, the great wizard is presently building

a new tower in the town of Nezras on the eastern slopes of

Mulhorands Sword Mountains. He has recently learned that

his  spellbook,  Unique  Mageries,  now  belongs  to  Maeve  of

Starmantle  (CN  female  half-drow  wizard  13/archmage  3),

daughter of the late Quarra of Cathtyr, but he has not yet

decided how to retrieve it.

The World-Walkers fascination with gems is evident from

the half-dozen unique gem-based spells he developed. Embedded

in his robes are nearly a dozen magically attuned gems that

require only his willing touch to activate.

Beyond this doorway is a bleak, gray stone chamber. Wrought

iron manacles and bone fragments peek through the heavy layer

of dust on the oor.

Sonjar kept the priests he had kidnapped in this prison when he

was not experimenting on them. The entrance and exit func-

21. BATH

The  main  feature  of  this  marble-lined  room  is  an  immense

ceramic tub that contains a portal to the Elemental Plane of

Water. A shelf on the wall holds several decayed bags of dust that

were once bath herbs. The small latrine in the corner contains

a portal that connects with the refuse pit (area 9).

22. ORCHARD DEMIPLANE (EL 8)

Beyond  this  doorway  lies  an  otherworldly,  sunlit  orchard

beneath a cloudless, bright blue sky. Rows upon rows of trees

laden with apples, pears, and other fruits extend far off into

the distance.

Sonjar created a circular demiplane nearly a mile in diameter

in which he planted hundreds of fruit trees. The orchard hums

with the sound of bees and is perpetually warm and fragrant.

Because  no  predators  exist  here,  the  bees  have  proliferated

throughout  the  demiplane.  The  orchard  is  also  home  to  a

tieing named Ewa.

Creature: A refugee from Thay, Ewa ed into the Underdark

before joining Durdyns Devils. When not meditating under a

Realms

of the

High Forest

In far older days, when the High Forest spanned much

of the land from the River Dessarin to the Graypeaks,

numerous elven and dwarven realms rose to prominence.

Dwarven kingdoms grew mighty by working metal and stone,

while  elves  nurtured  great  civilizations.  For  many  ages  these

realms  ourished,  enduring  repeated  invasions  by  orcs,  wars

among the elves, and incursions from the Underdark. Ultimately,

however, all of these civilizations were doomed to fall.

A single act of endish summoning that took place nearly ve

hundred years ago led to a demonic conagration that devoured

the  elven  kingdoms  of  the  High  Forest  and  neighboring  Am-

marindar, leaving the North forever changed. The High Forest

and its mountains reverted to a savage and lush wilderness in which

lost wonders from these bygone civilizations lie concealed.

The High Forest is littered with the ruins of the three elven

civilizations that succeeded ancient Aryvandaar. Here in the deep

woods, far removed from the more famous ruins of Cormanthyr,

lie  the  age-old  remains  of  great  woodland  societies  that  once

dwelled under the trees. The graceful architecture of these forgot-

ten elven cities is still amazingly well preserved. Delicate spires,

beautiful towers, and ancient temples offer fantastic places for

adventurers, antiquarians, and treasure seekers to explore. The

magic of the mythals that protect these places has diminished

greatly with the elves departure from the High Forest, but these

ancient defenses still embody considerable power.

In the mountains north and east of the High Forest, the shield

dwarves of old carved out two magnicent realms. Within the

Graypeaks, the Nether Mountains, the Rauvin Mountains, and

the Ice Mountains lie the ruins of many great dwarfholds from

this period. Most of the grand halls, labyrinthine mines, and

massive foundries of these realms still stand whole and intacta

testament to the durability of dwarven stonecraft.

History

The last chapter in the history of the High Forest elves began nearly

ten thousand years ago, when some sun elves returned to the forest

and founded the nation of Siluvanede amid the ruins of Aryvandaar.

The moon elves who arrived soon after founded the hidden kingdom

of Sharrven in the woodland areas to the south. The last and mighti-

est of the elven realms that rose in the High Forest was Eaerlann,

a powerful kingdom of moon elves and wood elves that was said to

rival the legendary Cormanthyr in spirit and lore.

Meanwhile, in the mountain peaks and deepest caverns, the

shield dwarves were carving out two mighty nations. Delzoun,

the great Northkingdom, rose as a chain of impregnable citadel

fortresses throughout the Nether and Rauvin mountains. Am-

marindar, on the other hand, was a secret dwarven realm rich

in arcane lore and metalcraft.

In  recent  times,  interest  in  the  High  Forest  has  begun  to

revive. The elves have returned to their ancient haunts, and a

new realm known as the Silver Marches has emerged from the

lands of old Delzoun. Reclamation of long-lost ancestral lands

is the new watchword for the civilized realms of the North, and

for now these efforts appear promising.

Keepers of the Past

The  history  of  the  High  Forest  is  rich  with  tales  of  heroic

wars and battles, of love gained, and of kingdoms lost. Because

such stories are still popular, characters can learn much about

the lost elven and dwarven kingdoms of the North simply by

listening to the tales and songs in public houses. Since the fall

of  the  High  Forest  kingdoms  happened  relatively  recently  by

dwarf and elf reckoning, the information in these tales is still

relatively accurate.

Wulgreth consorts with an imp during his summoning spree

THE HARPERS

The centuries-old organization known as the Harpers has long

been a force for political stability and social justice in the North.

Those Who Harp place great value on the past and seek to pre-

serve it in song and tale so that others may appreciate the vital

lessons that history provides. Such knowledge becomes particularly

relevant when past events violently intrude upon the present.

Izai  Thunnvangan  (CG  female  wood  elf  ranger  9/Harper

agent 2) knows more about the ancient Eaerlanni elves than any

other Harper. She has devoted her life to the Harper cause and

is perhaps the most senior Harper currently active in the High

Forest. Izai has recently been monitoring the Old Road in the

eastern part of the forest, looking for clues that might explain

the recent disappearance of several elves in that area.

Songs and Stories

Some information, however, requires more than a trip to a tavern.

The Sorrowwood, a mysterious ring of trees located deep within

the High Forest, provides mystic visions of the past to those who

seek knowledge. Alternatively, characters can seek out a dwarf

who can sing the Dirge of Delzoun, an epic song taught only

to dwarf bards.

THE DIRGE OF DELZOUN

Only a handful of dwarf bards from the North know this grim

ballad, and it has never been translated into any language other

than  Dwarven.  Only  a  few  humans  and  elves  have  ever  been

privileged to hear the entire song, which takes nearly 30 hours

to sing.

The Dirge of Delzoun recounts the story of the northern

shield dwarves, from the rise of their mighty cities to their settle-

ment of land within the Silver Marches. Woven throughout the

lengthy dirge are stories of Delzouns greatest heroes, deadliest

Keepers of the Past

The  history  of  the  High  Forest  is  rich  with  tales  of  heroic

wars and battles, of love gained, and of kingdoms lost. Because

such stories are still popular, characters can learn much about

the lost elven and dwarven kingdoms of the North simply by

listening to the tales and songs in public houses. Since the fall

of  the  High  Forest  kingdoms  happened  relatively  recently  by

dwarf and elf reckoning, the information in these tales is still

relatively accurate.

THE HARPERS

The centuries-old organization known as the Harpers has long

been a force for political stability and social justice in the North.

Those Who Harp place great value on the past and seek to pre-

serve it in song and tale so that others may appreciate the vital

lessons that history provides. Such knowledge becomes particularly

relevant when past events violently intrude upon the present.

Izai  Thunnvangan  (CG  female  wood  elf  ranger  9/Harper

agent 2) knows more about the ancient Eaerlanni elves than any

other Harper. She has devoted her life to the Harper cause and

is perhaps the most senior Harper currently active in the High

Forest. Izai has recently been monitoring the Old Road in the

eastern part of the forest, looking for clues that might explain

the recent disappearance of several elves in that area.

Songs and Stories

Some information, however, requires more than a trip to a tavern.

The Sorrowwood, a mysterious ring of trees located deep within

the High Forest, provides mystic visions of the past to those who

seek knowledge. Alternatively, characters can seek out a dwarf

who can sing the Dirge of Delzoun, an epic song taught only

to dwarf bards.

THE DIRGE OF DELZOUN

Only a handful of dwarf bards from the North know this grim

ballad, and it has never been translated into any language other

than  Dwarven.  Only  a  few  humans  and  elves  have  ever  been

privileged to hear the entire song, which takes nearly 30 hours

to sing.

The Dirge of Delzoun recounts the story of the northern

shield dwarves, from the rise of their mighty cities to their settle-

ment of land within the Silver Marches. Woven throughout the

lengthy dirge are stories of Delzouns greatest heroes, deadliest

enemies, ercest battles, and lost treasuresthe likes of which

Ollyn Grimtongue (NG male shield dwarf bard 13) of Citadel

Felbarr has been named dirgekeeper by King Emerus Warcrown.

This semiofcial title designates Ollyn as the sole dwarf who may

add new lines to the epic story of the Northkingdom. Dwarf bards

wishing to learn the dirge must demonstrate both knowledge and

skill (12 ranks each in Knowledge [history] and Perform [sing])

before Ollyn consents to teach it to them.

THE SORROWWOOD

Hidden in the dense woods of Unicorn Run, this small copse of

magic oaks was planted by the ancient elves of Aryvandaar. The

leaves of these trees change color like those of normal oaks but

never fall from the branches. They simply turn from summer

green to autumn shades of red and gold to winter brown, then

back again to green in the spring.

The Sorrowwood serves as a living recorder of elven history.

These  trees,  whose  roots  are  said  to  touch  the  roots  of  every

other tree in the High Forest, hold a history of the elves that

goes back more than ten thousand years.

The  elves  of  Sharrven  named  this  grove  the  Sorrowwood

because the history it related was full of sadness, death, and war.

The Sorrowwood is not an oracle and does not give answers to

questions asked. Rather, those who go there seeking knowledge

are drawn into an incredibly lifelike vision in which they must

interact with spectral representations of people, places, and events

from long ago. So vivid are these images that those awakening

from the vision often nd themselves clutching an ancient relic

or bleeding from a wound.

Important Sites

The  High  Forest,  the  Nether  Mountains,  and  the  Graypeaks

contain some of the most interesting sites in all of Faern. Most

of the dungeons in this region are not only difcult to reach but

also extremely dangerous to visit. Ancient magical forces, endish

warlords, and weird weather phenomena are only a few of the

terrors that await explorers here.

Ammarindar

Ammarindar, the southerly sister realm of Delzoun, once spanned

the entire Graypeak range as well as the vast region under De-

limbiyr Vale to the edge of the High Forest. The shield dwarves

of this kingdom settled primarily in the central Graypeaks, but

they also established a large mining colony  in  the  mountains

north of High Gap.

Ammarindar  was  a  relatively  minor  realm  compared  to

Delzoun or Shanatar, but what it lacked in inuence and size,

it more than made up in wealth. The dwarves of Ammarindar

mined vast amounts of adamantine ore from beneath the Gray-

peaks and crafted the metal into legendary suits of armor that

brought great prosperity to Ammarindar. Because the kingdom

was not subject to the devastating orc attacks that perpetually

threatened  dwarf  kingdoms  in  the  north  and  south,  it  grew

steadily in prosperity.

Ammarindar stood strong through the rise and fall of many

neighboring kingdoms, including Netheril and Sharrven, only

to fall at last before an onslaught of demons. Because the end

came  with  little  warning,  the  dwarves  eeing  the  murderous

hordes from Ascalhorn were forced to leave behind most of their

belongings, including their precious gold and gems. Thus, caches

of hastily buried treasure and dwarven heirlooms still lie scattered

throughout the tunnels and halls beneath the Graypeaks.

The citizens of Ammarindar chose hollowed areas of tremen-

dous size to house their communities so that they would have

plenty of room for buildings and roads. Most of Ammarindars

structures are roughly spherical in shape, and each appears to

ow from the surrounding stone. Protected from the outside ele-

ments and unoccupied until recently, the ruins of Ammarindar

have  survived  more  or  less  intact  through  the  centuries.  The

gracefully arching tunnels and halls of the capital city and the

surrounding clanholds reveal a great deal about how the dwarves

of old Ammarindar lived.

Reaching the ruins of Ammarindar may prove challenging for

surface dwellers. The stone giants in the Graypeaks have taken to

throwing interlopers off the mountains into the valleys below, and

goblins from Dekanter infest the southern slopes. The presence

of the goblins draws blue dragons that lair on the mountaintops

down lower in search of easy prey. Visitors who use the demon-dug

tunnels underneath the mountains to reach to Ammarindar risk

encountering patrols of the Scourged Legion.

CITADEL YAUNOROTH

Citadel  Yaunoroth  was  constructed  in  response  to  growing

concerns about the orc invasions that were plaguing the dwarves

of  the  North.  The  fortress  served  as  Ammarindars  southern

bastion, and it was never attacked until the hordes of Ascalhorn

stormed the kingdom.

One of the key battles for Ammarindar occurred at Citadel Yau-

noroth. The defenders, led by Princess Olmma, the sister of Queen

Helmma,  were  clearly  overmatched,  but  their  sacrice  bought

precious time for the dwarves eeing south to reach safety.

The ruins of this rounded dwarfhold, built into the moun-

tainside overlooking Bleached Bones Pass, incorporate miles of

curved,  dwarf-sized  tunnels  that  extend  throughout  the  lower

Graypeaks. A single, rough-hewn tunnel of goblin make connects

the lower reaches of Yaunoroth with the mines of Dekanter.

Many ghosts and other undead creatures still haunt Yauno-

roth, walking the tunnels and calling out for their long-dead kin.

The spirit of Princess Olmma (LN female shield dwarf ghost

ghter 6) still commands these troops and can muster them to

ght if needed.

NORTHPEAK

North and west of High Gap is a small group of well-tunneled

mountains collectively called Northpeak, in which Ammarindars

most active mining complex was located. Rich in adamantine

ore,  the  mines  of  Northpeak  furnished  the  raw  materials  for

the dwarf-crafted armor worn by the elite forces of Eaerlann,

Netheril,  and  Illefarn.  Now  Northpeak  serves  as  a  war  camp

for a garrison of the endish Scourged Legionthe formidable

army  of  tanarukksMon,  orcs,  and  other  demonkin  led  by  the

The garrison is commanded by Vhoks lieutenant, Trawg (CE

male tanarukk ghter 6/sorcerer 2), who is busy securing North-

Trawg has been growing more and more frustrated because the

orogsRac from Splendarrmornn have been conducting increasingly

frequent raids on the camp. The fact that only tanarukks have

been slain in these attacks has caused Trawg to wonder about

the orogs motives. Since all his

efforts to ally with them have

failed, Trawg is now committed

ment  for  their  attacks  on  the

time, because he is now faced with an unforeseen dilemma. His

patrols have captured a few tanarukksMon in the tunnels outside

Splendarrmornn. Ufarskaddun has declared these demonic orcs

abominations and ordered them destroyed, but he foresees a

time in the near future when he will have to lead a crusade

against  these  end-tainted  aberrations.  But  since  the  orog

leaders forces are far inferior

to  those  of  the  Scourged

Legion, he must bide his time

while encouraging other orog

tribes from the Underdark to

join him.

ROYAL CAVERNS OF

SPLENDARRMORNN

Shining Mountain, the western-

most summit of the Graypeaks,

was  the  site  of  Ammarindars

royal capital. Through centuries

of digging and stone shaping, the

dwarves hollowed out much of

the mountain, creating a tremen-

dous central vault surrounded by

several  immense  caverns.  The

vast halls of Ammarindar were

linked  together  by  a  lattice  of

sweeping tunnels. Gently arching

stone paths bridged the different

levels of the citys open spaces,

creating a magnicent stone web

of roadways.

The centerpiece of Splendar-

rmornn  was  the  legendary

Adamantine  Palace,  a  castle

constructed  entirely  of  the

black  metal  for  which  it  was

named.  Most  of  its  interior  walls  and  ceilings  were  decorated

with engraved images inlaid with precious metals and set with

gemstones. Though most of the gold, silver, and gems have been

stripped away from the engravings, enough still remains to show

the vast wealth commanded by the dwarves who lived here.

The sole outside entrance to the Royal Caverns lies behind the

Shining Falls, high above the Delimbiyr River. The citys great

adamantine gates still lie where they fell ve hundred years ago.

The invaders left little of the citys portable wealth behindin

fact,  the  Harpers  warn  that  adventurers  seeking  the  ancient

treasures of Ammarindar would have better luck searching the

ruins of Hellgate Keep.

Splendarrmornn has recently become home to nearly two

hundred orogs from the Lowerdark. Their leader, Ufarskaddun

(LE  male  orog  ghter  13),  discovered  the  ruins  two  years

ago while seeking out a base from which to invade the surface

lands. Since they took over the site, the orogs have been busy

XOTHOL

This  dwarven  college  of

magic was founded nearly two

thousand  years  ago  by  King

Azkuldar III. Xothol was to be

Ammarindars  secret  weapon

should the Netherese ever turn

a conquering eye on the shield

dwarves. The college was care-

fully tucked away beneath the

southwestern  Graypeaks,  and

its  existence  was  kept  secret

from  most  of  Ammarindars

population.

The dwarf wizards of Xothol

developed  new  spells  and  new

methods  of  spell  preparation,

all  of  which  were  designed  to

thwart the Netherese arcanists.

After Netherils fall, however,

support for Xothol waned. King

Tormalk eventually closed the

college and ordered it magically

sequestered until a time when

Ammarindar needed its protection again. The collected lore of

Xothol remains untouched to this day.

Delzoun

Many  ages  ago,  Delzoun  was  a  proud  and  powerful  kingdom

that  maintained  prosperous  trade  relations  with  the  mighty

nations of Eaerlann, Netheril, and Illefarn. At its height, the

great Northkingdom of the shield dwarves extended southward

from the Ice Mountains to encompass both the Rauvin and the

Nether Mountains.

Much like their kinfolk in Ammarindar to the south, the

dwarves of Delzoun were highly regarded by their allies and trad-

ing partners for their skill with metalworking and stonemasonry.

The Netherese placed great value on these traditional dwarven

skills and readily traded their gold and arcane lore for Delzouns

gems, ironwork, and weapons.

stripped away from the engravings, enough still remains to show

the vast wealth commanded by the dwarves who lived here.

The sole outside entrance to the Royal Caverns lies behind the

Shining Falls, high above the Delimbiyr River. The citys great

adamantine gates still lie where they fell ve hundred years ago.

The invaders left little of the citys portable wealth behindin

fact,  the  Harpers  warn  that  adventurers  seeking  the  ancient

treasures of Ammarindar would have better luck searching the

ruins of Hellgate Keep.

Splendarrmornn has recently become home to nearly two

hundred orogs from the Lowerdark. Their leader, Ufarskaddun

(LE  male  orog  ghter  13),  discovered  the  ruins  two  years

ago while seeking out a base from which to invade the surface

lands. Since they took over the site, the orogs have been busy

XOTHOL

This  dwarven  college  of

magic was founded nearly two

thousand  years  ago  by  King

Azkuldar III. Xothol was to be

Ammarindars  secret  weapon

should the Netherese ever turn

a conquering eye on the shield

dwarves. The college was care-

fully tucked away beneath the

southwestern  Graypeaks,  and

its  existence  was  kept  secret

from  most  of  Ammarindars

population.

The dwarf wizards of Xothol

developed  new  spells  and  new

methods  of  spell  preparation,

all  of  which  were  designed  to

thwart the Netherese arcanists.

After Netherils fall, however,

support for Xothol waned. King

Tormalk eventually closed the

college and ordered it magically

sequestered until a time when

Ammarindar needed its protection again. The collected lore of

Xothol remains untouched to this day.

Delzoun

Many  ages  ago,  Delzoun  was  a  proud  and  powerful  kingdom

that  maintained  prosperous  trade  relations  with  the  mighty

nations of Eaerlann, Netheril, and Illefarn. At its height, the

great Northkingdom of the shield dwarves extended southward

from the Ice Mountains to encompass both the Rauvin and the

Nether Mountains.

Much like their kinfolk in Ammarindar to the south, the

dwarves of Delzoun were highly regarded by their allies and trad-

ing partners for their skill with metalworking and stonemasonry.

The Netherese placed great value on these traditional dwarven

skills and readily traded their gold and arcane lore for Delzouns

gems, ironwork, and weapons.

REALMS OF THE HIGH FOREST

REALMS OF THE HIGH FOREST

Beginning about sixteen hundred years ago, successive incur-

sions by foes from the Underdark and frequent orc raids forced

the Northkingdom into a steady retreat. On the terrible day in

the Year of the Black Unicorn (100 DR) when Delzoun nally

fell,  only  Citadels  Adbar,  Felbarr,  Sundbarr,  and  a  few  other

surface dwarfholds survived.

The surface lands now known as Old Delzoun are dotted

with  shattered  roads,  crumbling  outposts,  and  razed  villages

that once bore names such as Osstkar and Meruindelve. Thiev-

ing bands of outlaws and orc raiders prowl these broken lands

hunting for easy prey. The dwarves have stepped up patrols in

the area, but they are still too infrequent to offer travelers any

real protection.

The  dwarves  of  Delzoun  preferred  function  over  form  in

their architecture, primarily because frequent orc raids left little

time for ornamental design. In the aboveground portion of their

empire, the shield dwarves constructed sturdy fortresses whose

outer walls were built of thick stone reinforced with skeletons of

iron beams. In the belowground portion of the realm, the major

halls and entrances to the underground tunnel maze known as

the  Fardrimm  were  equipped  with  strong  defenses,  including

reinforced walls, ironbound gates, and spiked pit traps. The shat-

tered gates, breached walls, and smashed defenses that now litter

Delzouns broken lands offer mute evidence of the centuries of

relentless enemy attacks that nally brought the great dwarven

empire low.

Athalantar

Founded in 183 DR by Uthgrael Aumar, the so-called Stag

King, Athalantar was located just south of what is now the

High  Forest.  The  Stag  King  carved  out  his  nation  amid

savage trolls and hobgoblins, mistrustful elves, and dwarves

who cared little for the lives of surface dwellers. Uthgrael, a

former adventurer, used his natural leadership ability to unite

the leaderless farming communities along the Delimbiyr River

into a prosperous kingdom of farmers, hunters, and soldiers. The

young kingdom of Athalantar seemed destined for greatness

and prosperity in a time of collapsing empiresuntil the Stag

King died in 216 DR.

When their father perished in battle against an enormous

horde of orcs, the seven princes of Athalantar fell to bickering

over the throne, and their conict soon escalated into outright

warfare. Ultimately, the kings eldest son, Belaur Aumar, seized

the throne in 218 DR with the aid of the mightiest mages of

the realm. But unlike his wise, politically astute father, Belaur

was a slow-witted dullard who was easily manipulated by his

newfound friends. The very mages whose power had secured

him the throne quickly became the true rulers of Athalantar,

and King Belaur was reduced to a mere puppet. The common

folk of Athalantar feared and hated these magelords, espe-

cially Undarl, the so-called Mage Royal.

By 224 DR, ve of Belaurs brothers had either vanished

or died (by Belaurs order or as a result of their own schem-

ing), and the last was dwelling in faraway Calimshan. Only

one Aumar other than the king remained in Athalantarthe

young  Elminster,  who  had  survived  the  destruction  of  his

home village and the murder of his parents by Undarl. While

Undarl and the puppet king Belaur tightened their grip on

the kingdom, Elminster went into hiding under a variety of

aliases, all the while studying magic and formulating a plan

for revenge.

In  240  DR,  Elminster  returned  to  the  capital  city  of

Hastarl at the age of 28 and enacted his plan for revenge. He

shattered the rule of the magelords and slew both King Belaur

and the Mage Royal Undarl, revealing the latter as a yuan-ti.

(Even that identity was only a mask, however, because Undarl

was actually one of the dreaded malaugrym from the Plane

of Shadow.) By his authority as the last prince of Athalantar,

Elminster then crowned the outlaw knight Helm Stoneblade

the new king of Athalantar. With his homeland in good hands,

Elminster, now a Chosen of Mystra, departed for the city of

Cormanthor. Sadly, Athalantar survived for only a little more

than a century thereafter. In 342 DR, a marauding orc horde

wiped out the entire kingdom.

Today,  only  the  elven  histories  from  the  early  days  of

Myth  Drannor  and  a  few  confused  legends  in  Secomber

include the story of Athalantar. Elminster is the ultimate

source of information on the Kingdom of the Stag, but the

Sage of Shadowdale remains notoriously close-mouthed about

his own past.

HASTARL

Athalantars capital and only true city was Hastarl. Though

it was as crowded and lthy as any other city on Faern, its

residents  were  quite  proud  of  it  and  rmly  believed  that  it

would one day be a pinnacle of human culture and learning.

The rule of the magelords largely quashed that dream, and

the  destruction  of  the  kingdom  in  342  DR  snuffed  it  out

completely. Later, the town of Secomber, which was built over

the ruins of Hastarl, became a base of operations for many

modern adventurers in the Western Heartlands.

UNDARLS TOWER

Along  the  north  bank  of  the  Delimbiyr  River,  just  a  few

miles west of Hastarl, the crumbling ruins of Undarls tower

thrust up from a rocky outcropping like a broken tusk. Most

of the towers aboveground living areas have been destroyed

by more than a thousand years of exposure to the elements,

but the malaugryms basement laboratory still exists, hidden

beneath a secret trapdoor and protected by powerful preserving

magic. In addition to spellbooks, arcane research equipment,

and magic items, the lab also contains a leaky portal to the

Plane of Shadow that has been allowing shadow creatures to

slip forth into the surrounding area for centuries.

ASCORE

In  the  time  of  the  Netherese  Empire,  Ascore  was  a  bustling

dwarven port city on the northwestern shores of the Narrow

Sea. Trade goods from Netheril and beyond owed ceaselessly

into Delzoun via the stone docks of this eastern gateway to the

realm and an underground highway called the Lowroad.

The fall of Netheril and the disappearance of the Narrow Sea

marked the end of this port. Today Ascore is a lonely, windswept

ruin on the edge of the Anauroch Desert. Bizarre stone ships lie

half buried under the sand where the docks once were.

The ruins of Ascore are most notable for thirteen pyramids

of  unknown  origin.  These  structures  are  made  of  an  unusual

red stone not unlike the bleeding stone of Karse. A Shadovar

expedition from the City of Shade has been studying these red

pyramids for the past year.

FARDRIMM

Most of this sprawling maze of underground tunnels lies below

the  broken  surface  lands  now  known  as  Old  Delzoun.  At  the

height of the Northkingdoms strength, Fardrimm was a hidden

highway  that  linked  all  the  great  dwarfholds  with  Delzouns

other holdings. But the tunnels were difcult to keep clear, and

Underdark invaders had seized control of much of the Fardrimm

long before the end of Delzoun in 100 DR.

The  Fardrimm  remains  an  impressive  system  of  broad

tunnels, although much of it is controlled by creatures of the

Underdark. Drow refugees from Ched Nasad and chitine hunt-

ers from Yathchol have taken advantage of the dwarves long

absence by constructing their own tunnels to link up with the

Fardrimm. But the dwarves inuence is still obvious from the

old dwarf-delves, strongholds, hidden armories, great temples,

and depleted mines that are scattered throughout the tunnels

of the Fardrimm.

Dwarf patrols from Citadels Adbar, Felbarr, and Sundbarr keep

watch over the portions of the Fardrimm that surround their for-

tresses, but they have made no effort to recover control over the

entire tunnel system. The wealthy and idealistic merchant Rurik

Silverhilt  (CG  male  shield  dwarf  ghter  6),  however,  believes

that the Fardrimm may once again become a safe underground

highway in the sole possession of the dwarves. Rurik pays hand-

somely for any aid in clearing out the tunnels between Adbar

and Felbarr, and he has already sealed off a handful of monster

tunnels around Citadel Adbar. Much remains to be done before

he can realize his dream, but the eager Rurik sees much prot

in this venture. Several returning caravans have already boasted

of heavy prots from trade with races of the Underdark.

GHAURINS HOLD

The ruins of this four-thousand-year-old stone manor belonged to

the heroic dwarf warrior Ghaurin, the greatest son of the ancient

Stoneheart clan. The few remaining stones of the manor known

as Ghaurins Hold sit by the Forkthe juncture where Adbar

Road and Fork Road meet in Old Delzoun.

During millennia of adventuring, the Stoneheart clan had

collected innumerable souvenirs, which it displayed in its ances-

tral mansion. Eventually, the hold became a sort of historical

museum where travelers could go to see the legendary swords,

axes, and armor worn and wielded by dwarves and their enemies

throughout time.

In 882 DR, when ends from Ascalhorn were devouring so

much of the North, the Stoneheart clan stood rm and repelled

the rst demon onslaught. But the second demon assault was

much  more  severe,  and  dwarves  fell  by  the  score.  When  his

entire clan lay dead around him and all seemed lost, Ghaurin

called upon Moradin to preserve his ancestral home from the

endish despoilers. Seemingly in answer to his prayer, a sudden

earthquake collapsed the surface portion of the great mansion,

crushing the invaders and sealing off the caverns below. Trapped

below the rubble, Ghaurin was transformed into a sentient stone

golem. In this new form, he closed off all the tunnels connecting

his mansion to the Fardrimm. Since then, Ghaurin has tirelessly

patrolled the myriad tunnels and cellars of his ancestral home,

keeping them safe from intruders.

THE LOWROAD

This forgotten stretch of natural and carved tunnels once served

as an underground trade route linking the citadels of Delzoun with

the port city of Ascore and its primary trading partner, Netheril.

In Old Delzoun, its course loosely corresponds with the River

Redrun and the Fork Road, running through the heart of the

Fardrimm all the way to Felbarr. The Lowroads destinations in

ancient Netheril now lie beneath the sands of the Anauroch.

In its heyday, the Lowroad was lined with dozens of forti-

ed and gated way stations, any of which could close the tunnel

in times of danger. When Netheril fell, the fearful dwarves of

Ascore sealed off the portion of the Lowroad leading east. The

undead spirits of trapped Netherese and dwarf merchants who

died  alongside  their  caravans  now  roam  the  Lowroad  east  of

Ascore.

Eaerlann

Eaerlann, the predominant elven kingdom of the High Forest,

endured for nearly six thousand years. The wood elves and moon

elves who made up its populace dwelled in woodland cities and

towns of fabulous beauty throughout the northern and eastern

portions of the High Forest.

While  Eaerlann  was  still  a  young  realm,  its  leaders  noted

Siluvanedes gradual slide toward evil and decided to take decisive

action to prevent the Siluvanedenn from repeating the errors

of their arrogant ancestors in Aryvandaar. With Sharrven as

an ally, the Eaerlanni forcibly subdued the realm of Siluvanede,

ushering in a ve-thousand-year period of peace and prosperity.

In  the  waning  years  of  Eaerlann,  its  population  began  to

dwindle as its residents left for Evermeet or joined the newer

realms appearing along the Sword Coast. Thus weakened, Eaerlann

was unable to mount any effective defense against the demons

of Hellgate Keep that emerged from Ascalhorn in 882 DR, and

the realm quickly fell before their onslaught.

Most travelers seeking the known Eaerlanni ruins go by way

of the Old Road, an ancient boulevard of cracked and broken

cobblestones  that  connects  Elven  Port,  Mhilamniir,  and  the

Nameless  Dungeon.  West  of  Mhilamniir,  forest  undergrowth

has  largely  swallowed  up  the  Old  Road,  though  the  portions

action to prevent the Siluvanedenn from repeating the errors

of their arrogant ancestors in Aryvandaar. With Sharrven as

an ally, the Eaerlanni forcibly subdued the realm of Siluvanede,

ushering in a ve-thousand-year period of peace and prosperity.

In  the  waning  years  of  Eaerlann,  its  population  began  to

dwindle as its residents left for Evermeet or joined the newer

realms appearing along the Sword Coast. Thus weakened, Eaerlann

was unable to mount any effective defense against the demons

of Hellgate Keep that emerged from Ascalhorn in 882 DR, and

the realm quickly fell before their onslaught.

Most travelers seeking the known Eaerlanni ruins go by way

of the Old Road, an ancient boulevard of cracked and broken

cobblestones  that  connects  Elven  Port,  Mhilamniir,  and  the

Nameless  Dungeon.  West  of  Mhilamniir,  forest  undergrowth

has  largely  swallowed  up  the  Old  Road,  though  the  portions

that occasionally peek through the roots and shrubs can guide

travelers to other sites along its path.

Many  Eaerlanni  cities  consisted  of  hollowed-out  trees  and

platforms  connected  by  dozens  of  slender  rope  bridges.  Each

major settlement held at least one tree-temple dedicated to the

elven gods. Most of these cities have long since succumbed to

the forces of time and nature, but a few traces of some remain.

MYTH GLAURACH

This fabled, mythal-cloaked city was built upon the nameless ruins

of an ancient Aryvandaaran city located amid the rushing waters

and deep-forested hills of the Talons, at the headwaters of the

Delimbiyr. Myth Glaurach was a gleaming garden city of ornate

manors, climbing terraces, and soaring, white-domed towers, but

its legendary mythal did not protect it from the ravaging orc

horde that sacked it in 864 DR.

In 1372 DR, Countess Sarya Dlardrageth arrived in the ruins

of Myth Glaurach with her feyri forces and began a meticulous

study of the mythal. In the early months of 1374 DR, the dae-

monfey sorceress succeeded in corrupting the mythal, perverting

many of its ancient wards and using its power to summon and

bind large numbers of ends to her service. Saryas army marched

against the elves of Evereska and the High Forest and wrought

great destruction until a host assembled in Evermeet by Lord

Seiveril Miritar halted her forces and drove her back. The sun

elf  mage  Araevin  Teshurr  of  Evermeet  managed  to  remove

Saryas corruption from the mythal and alter it to prevent future

tampering by ends. The daemonfey abandoned Myth Glaurach

shortly after Saryas defeat.

Presently, most of Evermeets host is still encamped in the

ruins of Myth Glaurach, and Lord Seiveril Miritar has dispatched

numerous search parties and patrols to search out Saryas new

hiding place. The elves have not yet charted the destinations of

the numerous portals they have found buried in the tunnels below

the grand mages former palace.

MHILAMNIIR

This  Eaerlanni  city  once  boasted  numerous  temples  dedicated

to the Seldarine. In fact, Mhilamniir was the seat of power for

Eaerlanns elf clergy before the demonic hordes struck. The rav-

aged city was largely reduced to rubble by the demons of Hellgate

Keep, and its ruins are now entirely covered over by thick moss

and tangles of ivy.

The  largest  surviving  building  in  Mhilamniir  is  a  great

temple to Corellon that stands in a grove near the city center.

For more than six hundred years, the very old female green

dragon Chloracridara and her brood have made their home

beneath the temples shattered dome. A bizarre woodsman (NE

male half-green-dragon/wood half-elf ranger 5/sorcerer 2) who

claims kinship with the dragon offers travelers the opportunity

to question his all-knowing mother, provided they can meet

her price.

HELLGATE DELL

Ascalhorn was established atop Ascals Horn in the northeastern

corner of the High Forest to defend Eaerlanns frontier. After

the fall of Netheril, the Eaerlanni conceded the stronghold to

Netherese refugees, a decision which proved costly centuries later.

A Netherese wizard named Wulgreth began summoning devils

to the city in 820 DR to win an advantage over his rivals. In

desperation, other wizards heeded the whispers of feyri agents

and began summoning demons in 880 DR. In the Year of the

Curse (882 DR), the summoned demons wiped out the summoned

devils and then seized the city. Shortly thereafter, the demonic

horde swept down Delimbiyr Vale and overran both Eaerlann

and Ammarindar.

Five  years  ago,  the  Harpers  razed  the  ruins  of  Ascalhorn

(also known as Hellgate Keep). The great treant Turlang claimed

stewardship over Hellgate Dell and extended the borders of the

High Forest to envelop its ruins. Vigilant treants now stand guard

over the site to keep explorers from entering and ends from

The Mythal of Glaurachyndaar

Although Myth Glaurachs mythal was signicantly damaged

by  the  corrupting  spells  of  the  daemonfey  sorceress  Sarya

Dlardrageth, Araevin Teshurr has successfully restored most

of its original strength and purpose.

The mythal aroints the casting of several types of spells,

makes several other spells prevalent, and vanguards a small

number of other spells (see Mythals, page 45). Most of the

vanguard spells are usable only by individuals who have success-

fully undergone a ritual to attune themselves to the mythal.

The mythal of Myth Glaurach aroints spells of the conjura-

tion (summoning) subschool and spells with the death, evil,

re, and acid descriptors. The following spells are prevalent

throughout the mythal: antipathy (to all evil-aligned demons,

devils,  dragons,  drow,  duergar,  goblinoids,  orcs,  and  trolls),

death ward, detect scrying, and protection from evil.

The Outer Ward of the mythal formerly barred all ends

and all beings who had ever eaten elf, dwarf, or human esh

from entering the city. This particular ward was the rst one

that Sarya disabled, and it has not been restored.

The Inner Ward covers the entire city and its outer wall

plus a vertical distance of 100 feet into the air above and the

ground below. In this portion of the mythal, calm animal is

a prevalent spell, and another prevalent component regulates

the growth of plants in the city to prevent Myth Glaurach

from becoming completely overgrown.

Any character wishing to attune herself to the mythal must

spend 10 days researching a special rite and make a DC 20

Spellcraft check to master it, then perform the rite, which re-

quires 24 hours and an expenditure of 2,000 XP. Any character

attuned to the mythal can use the following vanguard spells:

banishment, discern lies, feather fall, freedom of movement,

make whole, quench, remove curse, remove disease, remove fear,

remove paralysis, sending, and tongues.

leaving. But the Harpers only contained the evil under Hellgate

Dell; they did not eradicate it. This fact makes Turlang feel that

he is watching over a festering wound that could erupt again at

any time.

ONTHRILAENTHOR

Carved out of the eastern Star Mounts by the dwarves of Am-

marindar for their elf allies, the ancient mines of Onthrilaenthor

have  not  been  used  since  the  fall  of  Eaerlann.  Two  hidden

entrances to Onthrilaenthor existone on the gnarled badlands

near the southeastern base of the Star Mounts, and the other on

the northern slopes, just north of the Heart Blood River.

The mines of Onthrilaenthor encompass miles of tunnels,

spiral stairs, storage chambers, and vertical shafts that reach

upward into the peak of the most southern Star Mount. The

presence of stables and openings to the sky within that peak sug-

gest that the Eaerlanni at one time employed aerial mounts.

Fierce winds pour through these openings and rush through

the mines shafts and tunnels. Walking against the wind is ex-

tremely difcult, and most conversations carried on at a volume

below a yell are drowned out by the roaring winds.

The  mines  were  home  to  a  ock  of  harpies  for  a  decade.

These creatures were routed by an adult deep dragonMon named

Onskarrarrd, who had abandoned his lair near Ched Nasad after

the catastrophe that threw that entire region into chaos.

TURNSTONE PASS

Not all ruins are buildings or tombs. Turnstone Pass was once a

vital surface trade route between Ascalhorn and the dwarven city

of Sundbarr. Now, however, this long-neglected road has fallen

into disrepair. Along the length of Turnstone Pass, hidden evils

have taken up residence in the crumbling way stations that once

provided shelter and water for merchant caravans and travelers.

In the Year of the Boot (1343 DR), the Moonlight Men, led by

Mintiper Moonsilver, destroyed the Nethertide Horde in the pass

before it could threaten Everlund or Silverymoon.

Turnstone Pass has little trafc these days. Those that dare

walk along it risk attacks by thieves at best or predatory demons

at worst. Turlang, the treant guardian of Hellgate Dell, has

buried the portion of the pass that lies within the High Forest,

hoping  to  create  an  effective  deterrent  for  anyone  seeking

Hellgate Keep.

Sharrven

The ancient elven realm of Sharrven was founded by moon elves

along with a few sun elves who rejected the elitism and insuf-

ferable  arrogance  of  the  Siluvanedenn  nobles.  Sharrvens  end

came a few centuries after it had joined forces with Eaerlann to

defeat Siluvanede in the Seven Citadels War. Without warning,

mysterious portals created by feyri survivors of Siluvanede opened

simultaneously  throughout  the  kingdom,  releasing  a  torrent

of rampaging monsters. Sharrvens survivors ed to Eaerlann

and Evereska, leaving their former realm vacant but for a few

settlements and outposts.

Today, little remains of Sharrven because the creatures that

slaughtered the elves also demolished most of their settled areas.

Most of the surviving structures are topped with tremendous

stone  perchesreminders  of  the  time  when  elf  warriors  rode

silver and gold dragons into battle. The only fortress still standing

is a tower known as Farsilver that is highly reminiscent of the

buildings in Silverymoon. This structure is protected by magical

wards of the sort that the moon elves commonly placed on their

buildings.

To  this  day,  travelers  in  the  southern  region  of  the  High

Forest are likely to encounter a bizarre variety of terrain and

unusual creatures. Many of these beasts can trace their lineage

to the fall of Sharrven.

FARSILVER

The ancient fortress of Farsilver is an ivy-clad stone tower in the

southeastern portion of the High Forest, due north of Loudwater.

This rare remnant of Sharrven was a southerly outpost of the

realm.

The magical wards inside Farsilver dim any light sources and

prevent magical darkness from functioning. Each of the gemstone

windows in the towers top oor functions like a crystal ball with

detect thoughts, except that the users scrying is limited to the

direction the particular window is facing. Under a full moon, the

towers main entrance becomes a portal to the ruined Sharrven

city of Lhuve.

Farsilver has become the base of operations for two members

of  the  Eldreth  Veluuthra,  a  fanatical  elf  supremacist  group

dedicated to the eradication of humans. Fairra Waeviyrn (NE

female sun elf ghter 8) and Urrinnar Mithanai (CE male sun elf

wizard 7) ambush lone merchant wagons traveling to Loudwater.

Neither elf has any compunction about slaying humans or those

who accompany them, so a raid typically includes at least one

murder. After a successful raid, the elves burn the wagons and

leave the bodies of their victims to rot.

NITHRITHVINAES TOMB

About 40 miles due east of the Stronghold of the Nine lies the

only  known  burial  ground  for  the  noble  houses  of  Sharrven.

A single statue, now weathered beyond recognition, marks the

entrance  to  this  underground  tomb.  Beyond  it  lies  a  massive

labyrinth  of  rough-hewn  catacombs  that  extends  deep  under

the earth. Winding passages, each leading to a separate crypt

designated for a specic noble household, branch off in dozens

of different directions. Each family crypt is an elaborate vault

containing one or more stone mausoleums. Several of these crypts

are guarded by baelnornMon spellcastersusually members of the

crypts noble house who accepted unlife to stand guard over the

dead and protect their families secrets.

When Sharrven was a living realm, its leaders frequently

came to the tombs to ask respected baelnorns for advice and

magical aid. But the elf liches have had few visitors for the past

four thousand years, except for the occasional tomb robber. The

Caerilcarn, a group of elves that proclaims itself the vanguard

of  a  new  Eaerlann,  has  recently  contacted  the  most  senior

baelnorn, Alarendi Eveningshine (CG female moon elf baelnorn

wizard 17/archmage 2). Alarendi is currently considering the

groups request for assistance in taking back the High Forest

for the elves.

REALMS OF THE HIGH FOREST

REALMS OF THE HIGH FOREST

Siluvanede

This kingdom of sun elves was the  rst elven realm established in

the High Forest after the Crown Wars. Siluvanede occupied the

northwestern High Forest, which also included the Silverwood

at  the  time.  The  Siluvanedenn  favored  long,  graceful,  stone

structures and bright colors, so they  lled their cities with tall

towers and slender spires built of brightly colored stone and brick.

Magni cent manors lined every street, and every boulevard ended

in a park garden where artisans came to create works of art from

stone, wood, and magic.

But beneath Siluvanedes beauty lay a growing cancernamely,

a tendency to embrace the dark ways. In the early days of Silu-

vanede, the memories of the Elven Courts decree against the

Vyshaanti and the Descent of the Drow were still fresh in the

minds of many sun elves, so the citizens of the new kingdom were

more than a little fearful of the Seldarine. In response to those

fears, temples were outlawed in the new kingdom,  and  priests

were persecuted and driven out. The godless nature of Siluvanede

later contributed to House Dlardrageths success in subverting

the Siluvanedenn houses to their own dark cause. As more and

more Siluvanedenn fell in with the plots of House Dlardrageth,

an increasing number of them chose to follow the dark path laid

out by their Vyshaan forebears.

LOTHEN, CITY OF THE SILVER SPIRES

This magni cent city of silvery stone once marked the southern

border of Siluvanede. Before Eaerlann annexed it, Lothen was

a center of studies for the Siluvanedenn. The rampaging hordes

from Hellgate Keep never reached the City of Silver Spires, so

Lothen was spared from the devastation wrought by the demons

elsewhere in the High Forest.

Today, Lothens slender stone towers still stand strong, but the

great city is populated by orcs from the Tanglethorn, Sharpspike,

and Horned Lord tribes. Orc druids have converted several of the

old elven temples into temples of Malar, and the forest around

Lothen  is   lled  with  beasts  of  Malar  that  serve  as  spies  and

sentries for their orc druid masters.

Far below Lothen lies a stronghold of House Dlardrageth,

which occupies several long-forgotten conjuring chambers. When

Sarya and her sons were freed from their prison beneath Hellgate

Keep  ve years ago, they settled into this underground space so

that they could covertly seek out the descendants of their feyri

servitors and locate the sites where other feyri were imprisoned.

When the Dlardrageths occupied Myth Glaurach last year, they

largely abandoned their  rst refuge here.

THE NAMELESS DUNGEON

During the Crown Wars, the elves of Aryvandaar built a citadel

known as Nar Kerymhoarth in the northeastern region of the

High Forest to serve as an armory for their war magic. When

the empire dissolved, the armory was abandoned.

Five  thousand  years  ago,  a  group  of  rebellious  sun  elves

in uenced by House Dlardrageth claimed the old armory and

restocked  it  with  magic  created  by  the  elves  of  the  ancient

Vyshaantar  Empire.  Years  later,  in  the  closing  campaigns  of

the Seven Citadels War, the army of Eaerlann defeated more

than  two  thousand  feyri  warriors  of  House  Dlardrageth  and

House Vyshaan and imprisoned them in magical stasis in the

belowground levels of the armory. The imprisoned feyri were

soon  forgotten  by  their  jailors,  and  their  prison,  which  was

known as the Nameless Dungeon, became a place of intrigue for

adventurers.

After the fall of Eaerlann, the wood elf patrols that guarded

this part of the High Forest successfully barred access to the

Nameless Dungeon for a time. In 1369 DR, a contingent of orcs

and tanarukks from the Scourged Legion seized the dungeon,

only to be driven off by a tribe of dark nagas and other scalykind

from the Slitherswamp. These monsters, which had traveled to

the dungeon through a portal, settled in and made the place

their lair.

In early 1374 DR, the daemonfey Sarya released powerful

magic from the Gatekeepers Crystal to free the imprisoned feyri.

The resulting explosion wrecked the upper levels of the keep and

killed many of its naga and yuan-ti residents, trapping the rest

in the lower levels of Nar Kerymhoarth.

TELARDON, THE CITY OF EMERALD SPIRES

Telardon was constructed on the western edge of the Silverwood,

overlooking the Evermoors, in the days when those regions were

part of the High Forest. The City of Emerald Spires was well

known in Siluvanede and beyond for the unusual magical artifacts

created by its wizards.

During  the  Seven  Citadels  War,  the  combined  might  of

Eaerlann  and  Sharrven  reduced  Telardon  to  rubble.  In  their

haste to level the city, however, the Eaerlanni overlooked dozens

of underground chambers and libraries in which a few rebellious

sun elves had been practicing their  endish arts.

Now  only  a  few  crumbling  piles  of  green  stone  mark  the

spot where the great emerald towers of Siluvanede once stood,

but hundreds of sun elf magic items remain buried beneath the

ground. Centuries of disuse have caused the magic of these ancient

artifacts  to  decay,  and  their  mingled  energies  have  become  a

corrupting force that transforms animals, humanoids, and even

fey  in  the  area  into  plantlike  monsters  known  as  greenbound

creatures (see the greenbound creature template, page 73). Dozens

of trolls that have succumbed to this greenbinding effect now

dwell within Teladorns ruins.

Legacies of the

High Forest

The collected stories of the elven and dwarven kingdoms that

once occupied the High Forest form a complicated tapestry of

heroic battles, devastating betrayals, demonic intervention, and

powerful high magic. These and many other past events have

left their mark on the landscape of the North.

Adventure Seeds

THE FORGOTTEN MYTHAL

The Eaerlanni hid away many items of power and imprisoned

many evil creatures before their kingdom fell, and most of these

acts have long since been forgotten. But the recent release of the

imprisoned feyri from the Nameless Dungeon has generated much

interest in unearthing other Eaerlanni secrets.

In  particular,  several  old  songs  in  Elven  mention  the

mythal-cloaked, Siluvanedenn city of Myth Adofhaer, which the

Eaerlanni sent away from Faern some six thousand years ago.

Rumor holds that an old tome explaining the causes of Myth

Adofhaers exile and specifying the conditions necessary for its

return has recently been found in a ruined library of Eaerlann.

The organization known as Eldreth Veluuthra is very interested

in a city of sun elves who might share its members contempt for

the diminution of elven power over the centuries, and its agents

are furiously searching for the missing tome.

HIGHWAYS FROM HELLGATE

Centuries ago, the demons under Hellgate Keep dug an extensive

network of tunnels under the lands surrounding the High Forest.

A few of these passages connected with the Fardrimm, and others

reached as far as the Nether Mountains and Northpeak.

An opportunistic demon by the name of Scauuont (CE male

bar-lguraBV) now uses these tunnels to travel about the area unde-

tected. He has recently taken to visiting a distant village, cruelly

murdering a few of its citizens, then escaping through the tunnel

system before his crimes are discovered. Three townsJalanthar

in Rauvin Vale, Newfort in Sundabar Vale, and Quaevarr in the

Moonwoodhave been terrorized in the past week alone. All

the demons victims died the same waypainful torture by slow

evisceration. The authorities in the Silver Marches are baf ed

because no one has seen the perpetrator, and no one knows about

the tunnels that crisscross the area.

THE PLUNDER OF HELLGATE KEEP

The demons that poured forth from Hellgate Keep  ve hundred

years ago returned from their rampage laden with spoils from

Eaerlann, Delzoun, and Ammarindar. Many priceless heirlooms

and unique treasures vanished into the dark pit of Hellgate Keep

to become playthings for the  ends.

When  Ammarindar  and  Eaerlann  fell  to  the  demons,  the

Harpers compiled the following lists of wondrous items that they

knew had been lost to Hellgate Keep.

REALMS OF THE HIGH FOREST

REALMS OF THE HIGH FOREST

Siluvanede

This kingdom of sun elves was the  rst elven realm established in

the High Forest after the Crown Wars. Siluvanede occupied the

northwestern High Forest, which also included the Silverwood

at  the  time.  The  Siluvanedenn  favored  long,  graceful,  stone

structures and bright colors, so they  lled their cities with tall

towers and slender spires built of brightly colored stone and brick.

Magni cent manors lined every street, and every boulevard ended

in a park garden where artisans came to create works of art from

stone, wood, and magic.

But beneath Siluvanedes beauty lay a growing cancernamely,

a tendency to embrace the dark ways. In the early days of Silu-

vanede, the memories of the Elven Courts decree against the

Vyshaanti and the Descent of the Drow were still fresh in the

minds of many sun elves, so the citizens of the new kingdom were

Very few of these items have been recovered, despite many

attempts by dwarves and elves of noble houses. In fact, many

demons have used pieces of this ancient booty to lure highborn

elves and dwarves into traps. Treasure seekers hoping to wrest

this ancient wealth from the demons must rst get past Turlang

and his treants (see Hellgate Dell, page 90).

VOLCANIC COUNTDOWN

A  recent  series  of  minor  earthquakes  in  Silverymoon  Pass

generated a massive rockslide that exposed an ancient fortress

of Delzoun on the slopes of the Nether Mountains. Both King

Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr and Helm Dwarf-Friend,

Master of Sundabar, have claimed sovereignty over this fortress

and sent garrisons to secure the site. Adventurers, thieves, and

bandits from all over the North are racing to the fortress in

hopes of gaining dwarven treasure, but aftershocks continue to

rock the pass, making travel difcult.

Unbeknownst to those arriving at the fortress, the earthquakes

have been squeezing magma from a deep volcanic rift. With each

new tremor, the magma pushes higher, threatening to burst up

through the mountain and swallow the fortress with all its ancient

treasures. Adventurers who reach the site nd themselves in a

race against time to salvage any of the dwarven treasure.

Heirs of the High Forest

The legacies of Eaerlann, Ammarindor, and the demonic forces

that  destroyed  them  still  endure.  Their  descendants  take  the

forms of wood elf villages in the High Forest, the new Silver

Marches  realm,  and  the  demon-led  hordes  of  orcs  that  still

frequent the area.

THE CAERILCARN

For many years, some of the elves in the High Forest and the

Silver  Marches  have  dreamed  of  raising  a  new  Eaerlann.  A

number of wood elf elders and moon elf nobles who share this

dream have formed the Caerilcarn, or Council of the Wood. The

Caerilcarn has never claimed to represent all the elves in the

regionnot all wood elf clans or villages even bother to send

representatives, and not all moon elf houses feel that cleansing

Delimbiyr Vale or the important sites of Eaerlann is a reasonable

and necessary goal. In practice, the council offers the elves of

the region a forum in which to discuss issues of mutual concern

and pass along news of events in different parts of the forest.

Through the efforts of the Caerilcarn, the ruins of the Eaerlanni

site known as Talltrees have been resettled, and new settlements,

including Reitheillaethor and Nordahaeril, have been founded.

In  the  wake  of  the  recent  daemonfey-led  invasion  of  the

High Forest, the Caerilcarn has suddenly become much more

important. Wood elf leaders on the council cooperated with each

other to evacuate villages and clans in the path of the orc and

demon onslaught and organized a westward ight to the Lost

Peaks. There, the elf leaders successfully massed an army of

wood elves, and moon elves from Silverymoon and Everlund

joined  the  Argent  Legion  forces  that  marched  to  their  aid.

Now, with the army of Evermeet occupying the ruins of Myth

Glaurach, the dream of a restored Eaerlann does not seem so

distant after all.

Morgwais, the Lady of the Wood, is generally recognized as

the councils leaderat least as wood elves reckon such matters.

Another important voice is that of Yrind Morninglight (LG

male wood elf ghter 9), who foresees a return to greatness for

the elves of the North. Yrind is the spokesman for those council

members who favor formally refounding Eaerlann and binding

the  wood  elf  tribes  and  moon  elf  clans  together  as  a  living,

breathing elven realm.

HOUSE DLARDRAGETH

The members of House Dlardrageth are the endish descendants

of a proud, noble sun elf house whose members chose to mingle

their blood with that of demons. After their armies were defeated

at the gates of Evereska, before the Lost Peaks, and on the Lonely

Moor,  these  daemonfey  abandoned  their  stronghold  at  Myth

Glaurach as well as many of their other safe houses, including

the one they had established under the ancient Siluvanedenn city

of Lothen (see page 92). But despite the losses they suffered in

Sarya Dlardrageths war against Evereska and the High Forest,

the daemonfey are far stronger than they have been in millennia

now that the thousands of feyri warriors recently freed from the

Nameless Dungeon have swelled their ranks.

Feyri spies and agents still haunt various secret places in and

around the High Forest, but the main body of the daemonfey

armymore  than  a  thousand  veterans  of  the  Seven  Citadels

Warescaped destruction at the Lonely Moor and ed to parts

unknown. Though they are relatively few in number, these ancient

feyri warriors are skilled in magic and swordplay, blessed with

the demonic heritage of the daemonfey, and absolutely loyal to

Sarya Dlardrageth.

THE SILVER MARCHES

This new realm is a patchwork of human, elven, and dwarven

lands scattered throughout the Rauvin and Sundabar Vales. Many

citizens of the Silver Marches are descended from the inhabitants

of Eaerlann, Delzoun, and Netheril.

The Silver Marches already counts many of Delzouns former

holdingsmost notably Sundabar, Citadel Adbar, and the recently

reclaimed Citadel Felbarras members of its federation. Even

more dwarfholds are expected to seek membership as the dwarves

continue to take back their ancestral lands.

Many of the elves now living in Everlund and Silverymoon

are the children or grandchildren of Eaerlanni who ed north

and west to escape the fall of their kingdom in 882 DR. In fact,

a handful of the older elves in the Silver Marches were actually

present during the fall of Eaerlann and remember that event all

too well.

Fallen Netheril

N etheril,  the  Empire  of  Magic,  straddled

northern Faern some two thousand years

ago,  encompassing  what  is  now  the  Great

Desert  of  Anauroch  and  its  surrounding  wilderness.  The

Netherese are perhaps most famous for the arrogance of their

arcanists, who carved off mountaintops, raised them up into

the sky, and built oating cities atop them. Their incredible

mastery of the Art came to an abrupt end when the hubris of

Karsus, greatest of the archwizards, caused almost all these

ying cities to fall.

Few  people  realize,  however,  that  Netherils  true  legacy  is

the  diaspora  of  the  Art  that  occurred  after  the  empires  fall.

While the life-draining spells of the phaerimms were turning

the lands of Netheril into desert, many Netherese ed to other

lands, bringing with them a culture of magecraft and a hunger

to recapture the glory they had lost.

High and Low Netheril

From the moment that the rst oating city ascended into the

sky and set off across Faern, Netheril was effectively divided

into two countries, each with its own separate history and culture.

High Netheril consisted of the oating cities occupied by the

archwizards and their servants, and Low Netheril encompassed

the  demesnes  of  the  lesser  arcanists,  the  towns  of  the  Free

Folk, and the barbarian tribes that roamed the northern and

southwestern plains.

The  fall  of  High  Netheril  was  one  of  the  most  dramatic

moments in Faerns history. Karsus, the greatest of Netherils

arcanists, challenged Mystryl, the goddess of magic, to an arcane

duel for supremacy. The ensuing battle nearly destroyed the Weave

and caused the sky cities of the archwizards to plummet back to

earth.

The  fall  of  Low  Netheril  was  much  more  gradual.  The

Netherese  slowly  abandoned  the  heartlands  of  the  realm  and

spread west, south, and east into the border areas that were once

wilderness. During this migration, the Empire of Magic gradually

fragmented. In fact, the distinction between Low Netheril and

95

the Netherese survivor states that followed is more the conceit

of modern sages than a true fulcrum of history.

The  roots  of  Netherils  geographic,  cultural,  and  magical

division  lie  in  the  emergence  of  the  mythallarthe  greatest

invention of the archwizards and the chief reason that their legacy

did not endure. Powered by the Weave itself, a mythallar allowed

a Netherese arcanistPG to create powerful magic items without

expending personal energy. As long as the items created with a

mythallars power remained within a few miles of it, they were as

permanent as any normal magic item. When removed from the

mythallars area, however, these quasi-magic items rapidly became

inert. Two decades later, Ioulaum employed his own mythallar

to even more dramatic effect. After casting a powerful spell to

shear off a mountain peak, he fashioned the mountaintop into

a quasi-magic item, suspending it point-down in the air, and set a

mythallar atop it. On the at side of the peak, now facing upward,

he constructed a city, and highborn Netherese ocked there to

live among the clouds.

The impact of Ioulaums invention was twofold. Every elite

arcanist  began  striving  to  construct  her  own  mythallar,  and

thereby  her  own  oating  city.  The  result  was  immediate  and

persistent. Highborn Netherese, archwizards (thereafter dened

as individuals who ruled oating cities), and their attendants and

apprentices migrated wholesale to the oating cities in the clouds.

While they continued to craft new spells, their production of

true magic items dropped to almost zero, since they could always

bring the city with them to power their quasi-magic items.

Meanwhile, Netherese commoners and less powerful arcanists

who were not yet capable of creating mythallars continued to dwell

in cities and keeps on the ground. Although mythallars sufced

for getting around in the towns of Low Netheril, travel outside

these settlements continued to require the difcult but regular

production of permanent magic items. Research into powerful

new spells dropped to almost zero in Low Netheril because most

of the arcanists who were capable of such craftings had migrated

to the  oating cities in the sky.

The language of High Netheril was Loross, while the tongue

of  Low  Netheril  and  the  subsequent  survivor  states  was

Netherese. Both of these languages were scribed in the runes of

dragons. The living language closest to both of these tongues

is  Halruaan,  although  Illuskan,  Tethyrian,  Chondathan,  and

Damaran all bear traces of Netherese linguistic in uence, and

small pockets of Netherese and Loross speakers survive. Written

examples of Loross are found primarily in the lost tomes of the

archwizards,  which  are  recovered  occasionally  from  the  ruins

of the shattered sky cities and the tombs of arcanists who died

before the Fall of High Netheril. The walls of Low Netherils

ruins, most of which are now covered by the sands of Anauroch,

bear many Netherese phrases, and Netherese command words are

often inscribed on magic items constructed by the archwizards.

Today, bards speak frequently of High Netheril, thanks to

none  too  subtle  patronage  from  the  Churches  of  Azuth  and

Mystra. Their cautionary tales and songs describe the hubris of

the greatest archwizards and their all-too-literal fall. Those who

seek the legacies of the Empire of Magic,  however,   nd  that

little other than the spells of the archwizards survived the fall

of High Netheril. Most Netherese ruins and magic items date

back to Low Netheril and the Netherese Diaspora.

The history of Netheril is a long and rich one. Thanks to excel-

Keepers of the Past

The greatest storehouses of Netherils lost lore lie in the heart

of Mount Talath in Halruaa. The Library of Raumark holds

countless  texts  brought  to  Halruaa  by  Netherese   eeing  the

Karsuss  Folly,  and  the  Library  of  Shadows  holds  countless

texts preserved by the Shadovar during their sojourn into the

Plane of Shadow. Candlekeep also holds many volumes collected

from the Netherese Diaspora into the North and the Western

Heartlands, and the keepers of these books make them far more

accessible than the librarians of Mount Talath or the Shadovar

of Thultanthar make theirs.

Most  learned  folk  of  Faern  know  at  least  the  basics  of

Netherils history, and the lands bordering Anauroch are home

to  numerous  sages  who  have  more  than  a  passing  interest  in

Netherese esoterica. Many sages in Candlekeep, Evereska, Hal-

ruaa, Nimbral, Silverymoon, and Suzail have made the study

of Netherese history and archaeology their primary focus, and

they frequently engage in extensive debate over the minutiae of

Netherese life.

Any PC or NPC who is well versed in history can recall speci c

information with a Knowledge (history) check (see Table 61:

Netheril Information for DCs).

Information about Netheril and its fall can also be gained

from the living and undead beings who experienced it  rsthand.

Known Netherese liches include Aumvor the Undying, several

members of the Grand Cabal who dwell in the Host Tower of

the Arcane and the ruins of Illusk, and the legendary Larloch

of Warlocks Crypt (detailed in Lords of Darkness). High Prince

Telamont Tanthul (see Lords of Darkness), ruler of Thultanthar,

is also old enough to remember old Netheril, though he embraced

the shadow world instead of undeath. These individuals do not

welcome inquiries into the mysteries of Netheril, but the follow-

ing survivors of its fall can sometimes be persuaded to provide

 rsthand recollections.

GHOST SORCERESS OF SPELLGARD

Atop a serpentine rock ridge that marks the border between the

Fallen Lands and the sands of Anauroch stands the crumbling

ruin of a once-grand castle that was known as Saharelgard when

the High Mages of Netheril ruled the Empire of Magic. Thieves

long ago stripped the castle of its wealth, mighty items of magic,

furnishings, and luxuries. Thanks to the damp air, thick mats of

MORASHA OF

THE LONELY

MOOR

In  the  heart  of  the

Lonely Moor stands

a ruined castle of black

basalt  that  belongs  to  the

lich  known  as  Aumvor  the

Undying.  Within  it  dwells

his  great-grandniece  Mora-

sha  (LE  female  Netherese

human necromancer 5/cleric

5 of Jergal/mystic theurge 8).

Morasha  was  a  low-ranking

arcanist  during  the  Shadowed

Age  of  Low  Netheril,  and

though  she  is  quite  mad,  she

does remember a great deal about

that period. She does not part with

information  easily,  but  she  can  often

be persuaded to answer questions in exchange for dark secrets

of necromancy that she does not yet know. She is already quite

conversant in the dark arts and is willing to sink to any depth of

depravity, so information of interest to her is likely to be both

unutterably vile and extremely obscure.

ORACLE OF ELLYNTAAL

The  legendary  inventor  of  the  mythallar  was  one  of  the  few

sorcerer-kings who neither perished in the fall of Netheril nor

 ed  to  Halruaa.  Thanks  to  his  crafting  of  the  lost  epic  spell

Ioulaums  longevity  (see  page  43),  Ioulaum  of  Seventon  lived

for centuries, throughout most of the Netherese era. When the

phaerimms arrived, however, he soon realized that their lifedrain

spells were causing his life-sustaining magic to fail. Foreseeing

the doom of Netheril, he embraced lichdom and established a

lair in the depths of the Northdark.

In 339 DR, Ioulaum disappeared from Netheril. Because the

archwizard had been an immensely popular  gure and something

of a folk hero, the news of his disappearance touched off a panic

among the populace. The High Mages of Netheril grew fearful of

a popular revolt, and Karsus was moved to cast Karsuss avatar,

the spell that  nally doomed the Empire of Magic.

After the fall, Ioulaum quietly continued to choose apprentices

from among the most promising Netherese refugees. Curiously,

he also accepted apprentices from the nearby mind  ayer city

of Ellyntaal, and his illithid students,

who  called  themselves  the  Alhoon,

are  believed  to  have  been  the   rst

illithiliches.  Ioulaums  inten-

tions  became  clear  when

he created an undead elder

brain  from  the  minds

of  his  illithid  students

and  then  merged

his  own  sentience

into  it.  Most  of

his  illithilich  ap-

prentices  were

destroyed  in  this

arcane  ritual,  but

a  few  escaped  and

spread  the  secret  of

illithilich  creation  to

mind   ayer  commu-

nities  throughout  the

Realms Below.

Ioulaums last human

apprentice,  Tabra  (NG

female  human  wizard  18/

archmage 5), witnessed the rite

and  thought  her  master  had

been destroyed in a battle with

his own students. In revenge,

she  slaughtered  the  last  few

of Ellyntaals mind  ayers by

casting Ioulaums longevity on herself in the midst of the

community. She then destroyed all records of the spell (except

her  own  and  those  that  Ioulaum  himself  had  secretly  hidden

away) and  ed to the surface.

Thanks to many subsequent castings of that epic spell, Tabra

still lives today. Until recently, she operated a rooming house

and festhall called Bargewright Inn and often worked with the

Harpers. Most of the locals suspected that she was a gold dragon

in disguise, thanks to her apparent longevity and infrequent cast-

ing of shapechange to assume the form of a dragon. Recently,

however, she was captured by the Shadovar and brought back

to the City of Shade. Her present circumstances are unknown,

but if she yields to the persuasions of the Shadovar, the princes

of Shade may gain some important clues about Ioulaums last

known location and circumstances.

Ioulaum  survives  today  in  the  form  of  an  undead  elder

brainUnd (LN elder brain lich wizard 31/archmage 5/Netherese

arcanistPG 5). Now known as the Oracle of Ellyntaal, he lairs

Keepers of the Past

The greatest storehouses of Netherils lost lore lie in the heart

of Mount Talath in Halruaa. The Library of Raumark holds

countless  texts  brought  to  Halruaa  by  Netherese   eeing  the

Karsuss  Folly,  and  the  Library  of  Shadows  holds  countless

texts preserved by the Shadovar during their sojourn into the

Plane of Shadow. Candlekeep also holds many volumes collected

from the Netherese Diaspora into the North and the Western

Heartlands, and the keepers of these books make them far more

accessible than the librarians of Mount Talath or the Shadovar

of Thultanthar make theirs.

Most  learned  folk  of  Faern  know  at  least  the  basics  of

Netherils history, and the lands bordering Anauroch are home

to  numerous  sages  who  have  more  than  a  passing  interest  in

Netherese esoterica. Many sages in Candlekeep, Evereska, Hal-

of Netherese history and archaeology their primary focus, and

they frequently engage in extensive debate over the minutiae of

Netherese life.

Any PC or NPC who is well versed in history can recall speci c

information with a Knowledge (history) check (see Table 61:

Netheril Information for DCs).

Information about Netheril and its fall can also be gained

from the living and undead beings who experienced it  rsthand.

Known Netherese liches include Aumvor the Undying, several

members of the Grand Cabal who dwell in the Host Tower of

the Arcane and the ruins of Illusk, and the legendary Larloch

of Warlocks Crypt (detailed in Lords of Darkness). High Prince

Telamont Tanthul (see Lords of Darkness), ruler of Thultanthar,

is also old enough to remember old Netheril, though he embraced

the shadow world instead of undeath. These individuals do not

welcome inquiries into the mysteries of Netheril, but the follow-

ing survivors of its fall can sometimes be persuaded to provide

 rsthand recollections.

GHOST SORCERESS OF SPELLGARD

Atop a serpentine rock ridge that marks the border between the

Fallen Lands and the sands of Anauroch stands the crumbling

ruin of a once-grand castle that was known as Saharelgard when

the High Mages of Netheril ruled the Empire of Magic. Thieves

long ago stripped the castle of its wealth, mighty items of magic,

furnishings, and luxuries. Thanks to the damp air, thick mats of

moss, mold, and fungi have obscured its  ne halls.

Lady Saharel, the Sorceress of Saharelgard, was once a leading

member of the High Mages of Netheril. She survived the fall

of the Empire of Magic as an archlichMon and lived on in the

ruins of her castle, which was renamed Spellgard, for centuries

FALLEN NETHERIL

in the depths of the abandoned mind ayer city, surrounded by

echoing chambers carved with alien illithid sculptures. Because

staying overlong in these strangely preserved, empty halls results

in a strange form of madness (a lethal form of cackle fever and

mindre that invariably ends in death), only Ioulaums undead

servitors and the ghosts of the mind ayers slain by Tabra remain

here with him.

The few intrepid explorers who have chanced upon the Oracle

of Ellyntaal have gained bits of arcane knowledge dating back to

the height of Netheril from their meetings with it. Thus far, no

one suspects that this oracle was once the legendary Ioulaum,

but word of its existence has begun to spread in whispers across

the North. Ioulaum extracts a terrible price for the information

he providesthe voluntary, permanent loss of some fraction of

the questioners sanity (permanent loss of 1d4 points of Wisdom)

or the complete knowledge of a new epic spell (which is then

forever lost to the questioner).

THE SHACKLED SCRIBE OF LARLOCH

The  lich  known  as  Rhaugilath  the  Ageless  (LG  male  human

archlichMon wizard 22/archmage 5/Netherese arcanistPG 2) ruled

the oating city of Orbedal before the fall of High Netheril.

When Orbedal crashed to earth near the mouth of the Winding

Water,  Rhaugilath  (still  alive  thanks  to  his  phylactery)  was

trapped beneath its rubble.

In  the  months  following  the  fall,  Rhaugilaths  archrival

Larloch found the ruins of Orbedal and claimed them for his

own. He built his crypt (now known as Warlocks Crypt) from

the shattered spires of Orbedal, then began exploring the rest of

the ruins in earnest. Many years later, his delvings reached the

pocket in which Rhaugilath was trapped. The two battled ercely,

but at last Larloch prevailed and bound Rhaugilath to his will.

Rhaugilath was but the rst of sixty liches  who  serve the

legendary master of Warlocks Crypt today. Larlochs favorite

captive spends the majority of his time recording the history of

Netheril, and his as yet incomplete multivolume opus, titled Of

the Fall of Netheril, continues to expand. After Larloch reviews

the nished chapters, they are sent to Candlekeep for archiving.

It is unlikely that the work will ever be completed, however, since

Rhaugilath considers the full story of the Netherese Diaspora

and  the  subsequent  rebirth  of  Netheril  (an  event  that  is  still

unfolding) to be integral components of his treatise.

From time to time, Larloch permits Rhaugilath access to one

of two spellseither dream or nightmare, depending on his whim.

The lich-king of fallen Orbedal uses these rare rewards to reach

out to individuals he has scried and bequeath a small fragment

of Netherese lore to them. Rumor has it that those who receive

such bequests can faintly hear the forlorn sighs of Rhaugilath

and the dry chuckle of Larloch before their visions fade.

THE TERRASEER

Long  before  the  rise  of  Netheril,  the  sarrukh  empire  known

as  Isstossefl  dominated  the  Anauroch  basin.  In  its  heyday,

Isstossefl encompassed the eastern shores of the old Narrow

Sea as well as the fertile lands that stretched from the Saiyad-

dar to the High Ice, and from the waters edge to the Plain of

Standing Stones.

Today,  the  shrunken  remnants  of  this  once-great  empire

include only the buried city called Oreme and whatever caverns

its  remaining  inhabitants  can  hold  against  the  might  of  the

phaerimms. The sixty sarrukh liches of Oreme take turns ruling

their tiny realm, each emerging from hibernation to take the

throne for four years, then returning to somnolence in the Crypt

of Dreaming Lizards when the next lich awakens.

Unbeknownst  to  the  Netherese,  the  archwizard  known  as

Arthindol the Terraseer was actually a sarrukh lich from ancient

Isstossefl who adopted the guise of a human arcanist during

his  turns  on  the  throne  of  Oreme.  By  making  periodic  visits

to Netheril, he sought to further the study of the Art among

the Netherese and shape the evolution of their history. In this

manner, he hoped to cultivate new forms of magic that might

enable the sarrukh to defeat the phaerimms once and for all.

It is unclear whether the Terraseer considers his Netherese

experiment a success or a disaster, but he has not emerged from

Oreme since Karsuss Folly. Since he is currently midway through

his latest four-year reign, anyone who locates the crypts of Oreme

and enters in peace can ask to speak with him. If a visitor treats

the asabis that guard Oreme with respect and shows real promise

as a student of the Art, Arthindol (N male sarrukh lich wizard

25/archmage 5) might acquiesce to a bold request for information

about Netheril in exchange for some new arcane lore that the

sarrukh can use against the phaerimms. Then again, he might

simply slaughter such impertinent questioners.

Songs and Stories

The following section details the history of Netheril, from its

initial evolution to its ultimate fall and the rise of the survivor

states from its ashes.

THE FIRST AGE

Netherils history began nearly ve thousand years ago on the

shores of the Narrow Sea, which was swallowed up by the High

Ice centuries ago. Seven shing villagesFenwick, Gers, Gilan,

Gustaf, Moran, Nauseef, and Janickjoined together for mutual

defense and benecial trade. They christened their tiny new realm

the Alliance of Seventon, in honor of the seven villages. In the

calendar of the Dalereckoning, this historic event occurred in the

year 3859, but the calendar of Netheril marks the founding of

Seventon as the beginning of the year 1 NY (Netheril Years).

Nether  the  Elder,  Shaman-King  of  Gers,  emerged  as  the

leader of Seventons ruling council and renamed the land Netheril

(Nethers Land). In time, he became a tyrant concerned only

with power and position. After murdering all his rivals, he was

assassinated by his son, Alandril Nether the Younger, who suc-

ceeded him as the rst king of Netheril. However, a ruling council

of appointed representatives served as a check on the power of

Nether the Younger, and their power increased with each of his

successors.

During this period, the Netherese began to study the Art under

the tutelage of several moon elf ambassadors from Eaerlann. The

elves saw promise in the edging realm of Netheril and sought

to nurture it as an ally against the ever-present danger of the

orcs and their destructive hordes. Another who recognized the

potential of the Netherese was the mysterious wizard known as

the Terraseer, who appeared centuries after the arrival of the Fair

Folk and began to instruct certain Netherese arcanists in other

forms of magic either unknown to or rejected by the elves.

THE NETHER AGE

The Nether Age began with the discovery of the nether scrolls

amid the ruins of Aryvandaar. A Netherese arcanist descended

from Therion of Gers discovered two sets of golden scrolls in

the ancient cellars of the fortress now known as the Citadel of

Mists. At the time of his discovery, the arcanist was an apprentice

studying in Glaurachyndaar (later known as Myth Glaurach), the

City of Scrolls. During his tenure in Eaerlann, he secretly explored

many Vyshaantar ruins with the aid of a serpentskin tome given

to him in condence by the mysterious Terraseer.

With the discovery of the nether scrolls, the Netherese began

a  long  period  of  magical  experimentation  and  research  that

advanced their understanding of the Weave and its applications

by leaps and bounds. In the process, the Netherese abandoned

many of the guiding principles taught to them by the Eaerlanni

elves, and relations between the two kingdoms soured. However,

the Netherese found new allies in the Stout Folk of Delzoun,

and trade began to ow along the Narrow Sea between Netheril

and the dwarven port of Ascore.

Toward  the  end  of  this  age,  one  set  of  nether  scrolls  was

stolen, despite the great precautions that the leading Netherese

arcanists of the day took to secure them. Unbeknownst to the

Netherese, the thieves were acting on behalf of the high mages of

Cormanthyr. Alarmed by reports from their Eaerlanni brethren

to the west and by the rapidity with which the Netherese had

mastered the Art, the high mages sought to study the texts that

had brought about such dramatic advances before Netheril could

threaten Cormanthyr. The elves hid the scrolls in the depths of

Windsong Tower in Cormanthor (later Myth Drannor) and gave

them the form of the Quess Ar Teranthvar (Golden Grove of

Hidden Knowledge), a golden beech tree.

THE MYTHALLAR AGE

After the Nether Age, the focus of Netherese magic changed yet

again with the rise of an arcanist named Ioulaum, whose power

eclipsed that of all who came before him and, some would say,

all who have come since. Over the course of his long lifetime,

Ioulaum performed many amazing deeds and made dozens of

miraculous discoveries, but his most signicant contribution was

the invention of the mythallar. This single arcane advancement

enabled both the relatively cheap production of quasi-magic items

and the creation of Netherils oating cities. Once the Netherese

mastered the use of the mythallar, enclave after enclave rose up

into the sky, dividing the Empire of Magic into Low and High

Netheril.

THE SILVER AGE

During the Silver Age, the Netherese began to look beyond the

borders of the Anauroch basin. Driven in part by the need for

raw materials, the High Mages of Netheril established the mines

of Dekanter to furnish them with rare metals. The High Mages

of Netheril established numerous outposts during this period,

both to spy on the empires neighbors and to facilitate trade with

them. Other arcanists set out on their own, seeking isolation in

which to pursue their studies.

THE GOLDEN AGE

Though the distinction between the Silver Age and the Golden

Age is a largely arbitrary one, most sages agree that Netherils

Golden Age began with the birth of the Chronomancer. By this

time,  dozens  of  oating  cities  were  soaring  above  Netherils

loosely dened borders, and the Empire of Magic had reached

the height of its power.

AGE OF DISCOVERY

The Age of Discovery began when a chardalynLD mine was found

in  Low  Netheril.  After  this  discovery,  the  Netherese  aborted

their research into the mysteries of gem magic and focused their

efforts on further development of the magic without sacrice

concept ushered in by the invention of the mythallar.

Travel and exploration were the passions of the period. The

Netherese  oating  cities  moved  beyond  the  immediate  border

areas of Low Netheril and began ranging over all Faern. The

archwizards also developed an interest in exploring other worlds

and created many planar portals for this purpose.

THE SHADOWED AGE AND THE

NETHERESE DIASPORA

The birth of Karsus marks the beginning of the Shadowed Age in

virtually all histories of Netheril. A genius of Ioulaums caliber,

he quickly mastered even the most complex magic of the time.

After building his own enclave, Karsus began experimenting with

heavy magic. Later, he nurtured the shadowy studies of Telamont

Tanthul, who would subsequently become ruler of Thultanthar.

When Ioulaum vanished, Karsus made the fateful move for which

he is best knownhe cast a spell called Karsuss avatar, which

created a link between him and Mystryl and wrested control of

the Weave from her. This event, later known as Karsuss Folly,

was the direct cause of High Netherils fall.

As Karsuss body swelled with divine power, his mind lled

with unimaginable knowledge, including a dreadful understanding

of the mistake he had just madehe had stolen divinity from

the one being who knew the Weave well enough to constantly

repair  the  damage  done  to  it  by  the  magic-hungry  Netherese

and phaerimms. To save the Weave before the damage became

irreparable, Mystryl sacriced herself. Her death negated magic

throughout  Faern,  sending  the  ying  cities  crashing  to  the

ground, and also severed her link to Karsus, petrifying his body.

Almost immediately, the goddess of magic was reincarnated as

Mystra, and she recreated the Weave in time to save the three

cities of High Netheril that had not yet hit the ground. The new

Weave had stricter spellcasting requirements that prevented the

excesses of the Netherese.

Of equal import during this era was the emergence of the

phaerimmsstrange,  subterranean  sorcerers  whose  life-drain-

ing spells were slowly transforming fertile Low Netheril into

the Great Sand Sea. The environmental changes they induced

precipitated the greatest migration of humanity that had ever

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

in the depths of the abandoned mind ayer city, surrounded by

echoing chambers carved with alien illithid sculptures. Because

staying overlong in these strangely preserved, empty halls results

in a strange form of madness (a lethal form of cackle fever and

mindre that invariably ends in death), only Ioulaums undead

servitors and the ghosts of the mind ayers slain by Tabra remain

here with him.

The few intrepid explorers who have chanced upon the Oracle

of Ellyntaal have gained bits of arcane knowledge dating back to

the height of Netheril from their meetings with it. Thus far, no

one suspects that this oracle was once the legendary Ioulaum,

but word of its existence has begun to spread in whispers across

the North. Ioulaum extracts a terrible price for the information

he providesthe voluntary, permanent loss of some fraction of

the questioners sanity (permanent loss of 1d4 points of Wisdom)

or the complete knowledge of a new epic spell (which is then

forever lost to the questioner).

THE SHACKLED SCRIBE OF LARLOCH

The  lich  known  as  Rhaugilath  the  Ageless  (LG  male  human

archlichMon wizard 22/archmage 5/Netherese arcanistPG 2) ruled

the oating city of Orbedal before the fall of High Netheril.

When Orbedal crashed to earth near the mouth of the Winding

Water,  Rhaugilath  (still  alive  thanks  to  his  phylactery)  was

trapped beneath its rubble.

In  the  months  following  the  fall,  Rhaugilaths  archrival

Larloch found the ruins of Orbedal and claimed them for his

own. He built his crypt (now known as Warlocks Crypt) from

the shattered spires of Orbedal, then began exploring the rest of

the ruins in earnest. Many years later, his delvings reached the

pocket in which Rhaugilath was trapped. The two battled ercely,

but at last Larloch prevailed and bound Rhaugilath to his will.

Rhaugilath was but the rst of sixty liches  who  serve the

legendary master of Warlocks Crypt today. Larlochs favorite

captive spends the majority of his time recording the history of

Netheril, and his as yet incomplete multivolume opus, titled Of

the Fall of Netheril, continues to expand. After Larloch reviews

the nished chapters, they are sent to Candlekeep for archiving.

It is unlikely that the work will ever be completed, however, since

Rhaugilath considers the full story of the Netherese Diaspora

and  the  subsequent  rebirth  of  Netheril  (an  event  that  is  still

unfolding) to be integral components of his treatise.

From time to time, Larloch permits Rhaugilath access to one

of two spellseither dream or nightmare, depending on his whim.

The lich-king of fallen Orbedal uses these rare rewards to reach

out to individuals he has scried and bequeath a small fragment

of Netherese lore to them. Rumor has it that those who receive

such bequests can faintly hear the forlorn sighs of Rhaugilath

and the dry chuckle of Larloch before their visions fade.

THE TERRASEER

Long  before  the  rise  of  Netheril,  the  sarrukh  empire  known

as  Isstossefl  dominated  the  Anauroch  basin.  In  its  heyday,

Isstossefl encompassed the eastern shores of the old Narrow

Sea as well as the fertile lands that stretched from the Saiyad-

dar to the High Ice, and from the waters edge to the Plain of

Standing Stones.

Today,  the  shrunken  remnants  of  this  once-great  empire

include only the buried city called Oreme and whatever caverns

its  remaining  inhabitants  can  hold  against  the  might  of  the

phaerimms. The sixty sarrukh liches of Oreme take turns ruling

their tiny realm, each emerging from hibernation to take the

throne for four years, then returning to somnolence in the Crypt

of Dreaming Lizards when the next lich awakens.

Unbeknownst  to  the  Netherese,  the  archwizard  known  as

Arthindol the Terraseer was actually a sarrukh lich from ancient

Isstossefl who adopted the guise of a human arcanist during

his  turns  on  the  throne  of  Oreme.  By  making  periodic  visits

to Netheril, he sought to further the study of the Art among

the Netherese and shape the evolution of their history. In this

manner, he hoped to cultivate new forms of magic that might

enable the sarrukh to defeat the phaerimms once and for all.

It is unclear whether the Terraseer considers his Netherese

experiment a success or a disaster, but he has not emerged from

Oreme since Karsuss Folly. Since he is currently midway through

his latest four-year reign, anyone who locates the crypts of Oreme

and enters in peace can ask to speak with him. If a visitor treats

the asabis that guard Oreme with respect and shows real promise

as a student of the Art, Arthindol (N male sarrukh lich wizard

25/archmage 5) might acquiesce to a bold request for information

about Netheril in exchange for some new arcane lore that the

sarrukh can use against the phaerimms. Then again, he might

simply slaughter such impertinent questioners.

Songs and Stories

The following section details the history of Netheril, from its

initial evolution to its ultimate fall and the rise of the survivor

states from its ashes.

THE FIRST AGE

Netherils history began nearly ve thousand years ago on the

shores of the Narrow Sea, which was swallowed up by the High

Ice centuries ago. Seven shing villagesFenwick, Gers, Gilan,

Gustaf, Moran, Nauseef, and Janickjoined together for mutual

defense and benecial trade. They christened their tiny new realm

the Alliance of Seventon, in honor of the seven villages. In the

calendar of the Dalereckoning, this historic event occurred in the

year 3859, but the calendar of Netheril marks the founding of

Seventon as the beginning of the year 1 NY (Netheril Years).

Nether  the  Elder,  Shaman-King  of  Gers,  emerged  as  the

leader of Seventons ruling council and renamed the land Netheril

(Nethers Land). In time, he became a tyrant concerned only

with power and position. After murdering all his rivals, he was

assassinated by his son, Alandril Nether the Younger, who suc-

ceeded him as the rst king of Netheril. However, a ruling council

of appointed representatives served as a check on the power of

Nether the Younger, and their power increased with each of his

successors.

During this period, the Netherese began to study the Art under

the tutelage of several moon elf ambassadors from Eaerlann. The

elves saw promise in the edging realm of Netheril and sought

to nurture it as an ally against the ever-present danger of the

orcs and their destructive hordes. Another who recognized the

potential of the Netherese was the mysterious wizard known as

the Terraseer, who appeared centuries after the arrival of the Fair

Folk and began to instruct certain Netherese arcanists in other

forms of magic either unknown to or rejected by the elves.

THE NETHER AGE

The Nether Age began with the discovery of the nether scrolls

amid the ruins of Aryvandaar. A Netherese arcanist descended

from Therion of Gers discovered two sets of golden scrolls in

the ancient cellars of the fortress now known as the Citadel of

Mists. At the time of his discovery, the arcanist was an apprentice

studying in Glaurachyndaar (later known as Myth Glaurach), the

City of Scrolls. During his tenure in Eaerlann, he secretly explored

to him in condence by the mysterious Terraseer.

a  long  period  of  magical  experimentation  and  research  that

advanced their understanding of the Weave and its applications

by leaps and bounds. In the process, the Netherese abandoned

many of the guiding principles taught to them by the Eaerlanni

elves, and relations between the two kingdoms soured. However,

the Netherese found new allies in the Stout Folk of Delzoun,

and trade began to ow along the Narrow Sea between Netheril

and the dwarven port of Ascore.

Toward  the  end  of  this  age,  one  set  of  nether  scrolls  was

arcanists of the day took to secure them. Unbeknownst to the

Cormanthyr. Alarmed by reports from their Eaerlanni brethren

Windsong Tower in Cormanthor (later Myth Drannor) and gave

which to pursue their studies.

Golden Age began with the birth of the Chronomancer. By this

time,  dozens  of  oating  cities  were  soaring  above  Netherils

THE SHADOWED AGE AND THE

NETHERESE DIASPORA

The birth of Karsus marks the beginning of the Shadowed Age in

virtually all histories of Netheril. A genius of Ioulaums caliber,

he quickly mastered even the most complex magic of the time.

After building his own enclave, Karsus began experimenting with

the Great Sand Sea. The environmental changes they induced

precipitated the greatest migration of humanity that had ever

102

103

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

occurred in western Faern. For nearly two centuries, the Neth-

erese migrated west, south, and east, founding new realms and

merging with other groups to form new ethnicities. By the time

the  sharnsMon  nally  succeeded  in  containing  the  phaerimms,

Netheril was already lost to the sands of history.

Important Sites

The great human empire called Netheril began as the Alliance

of Seventon, a cluster of villages on the southeastern shore of

the Narrow Sea, beneath the region now known as the eastern

High Ice. At its height, Low Netheril occupied the entirety of the

area that the Fair Folk called the Anauroch basin. High Netheril

encompassed all the Netherese oating enclaves, which roamed

throughout  Faern  and  even  beyond.  In  fact,  the  wanderings

of the High Netherese were constrained only by the existence

of certain powerful empires, such as Calimshan, Cormanthyr,

Delzoun, Illefarn, Jhaamdath, Mulhorand, Narfell, Raumathar,

and Unther, that possessed the magical prowess to project their

military might into the skies.

A  disproportionate  number  of  the  surviving  Netherese

ruins are from Low Netheril, primarily because most of High

Netherils oating cities were shattered beyond recognition when

they fell. Most of Low Netherils ruins are outposts and tombs

that were constructed before Karsuss Folly and settlements that

Netherese refugees built after the fall.

Likewise, more Low Netherese artifacts have been found in

the North and the Western Heartlands than in the area that

was Low Netheril, thanks to the encroachment of the High Ice,

the blowing sands of southern Anauroch, and the magic-draining

capabilities of the phaerimms. Most surviving magic items of

Netherese manufacture are not quasi-magic items dependent on

mythallars, since the emigrants and refugees prudently left those

behind.

The Lost Kingdoms

After Karsuss Folly, the oating cities of Asram, Anauria, and

Hlondath (also known as the Three Realms), settled slowly down

to  earth  along  Netherils  southeastern  frontier,  saved  by  the

grace of Mystra. The survivors of these enclaves built realms

of the same names in the remaining fertile lands between the

spreading sands of Anauroch and the region now known as the

Desertsmouth  Mountains.  Although  popular  lore  holds  that

Netheril fell by the hand of Karsus, many scholars consider the

Lost Kingdoms to be the last age of Low Netheril.

ANAURIA

The richest of the Lost Kingdoms was Anauriaa human-ruled

land of humans, elves, and half-elves. The Anaurian nobles hunted

boar, stags, and monstrous game while the farmers produced food

for the Three Realms and enough spare grain to sell to all the

lands about the Inner Sea. Anauria fell to a horde of orcs in 111

DR, but its inhabitants fought with such fury that the ranks of

the victors were as badly depleted as those of the vanquished.

The ruins of Anauria still bear the heraldic marks of its noble

houses: Maluradek (human), Nemrin (human), Nyntynel (elven),

Olyrnn (elven), and Thardresk (human, royal).

The  ruins  of  Amazandar,  Anaurias  capital,  lie  due  west

of Rausrawna (known to Anaurians as Mount Shaddath), the

westernmost peak of the Desertsmouth Mountains. All that now

remains of the so-called City of Gems are a few half-buried ruins

shattered by the might of the orcs, plus the deep mining shafts

beneath the city that give access to still-rich veins of gemstones.

Today,  Amazandars  gem  mines  are  home  to  the  phaerimms

and their minions, including legions of beholder-led orcs twisted

by the fell spells of the phaerimms. The undercroft of a ruined

temple of Jergal reportedly contains the fabulous tomb of King

Thausimbel the Wise and his daughter, Queen Shaddara the Fair.

In truth, it contains a portal leading to the Dungeon of Swords in

the Serpent Hills (see Serpent Kingdoms). This portal is actually

the keystone of a portal network of Anaurian tombs.

The ruins of Anauril, the City of Swords, lie north and east

of Amazandar and due west of the Twisted Tower of Shadowdale.

These ruins are in far better condition than the remains of the

City  of  Gems  because  the  tide  of  orcs  nally  crested  on  the

blades  of  Anaurias  defenders  at  Anauril.  The  City  of  Swords

was named for the ne steel blades manufactured there, many

of which were magically enhanced by the wizards of houses Nyn-

tynel and Olyrnn. An impressive number of these magic swords

are still within the ruins, but they are wielded by the legion of

swordwraithsFF that still defends Anaurils sand-covered walls.

The shattered remnants of Helvara, the main agricultural and

shing center of the realm, are located on the southern shore of

Lake Miir, hard by the anks of the Desertsmouth Mountains.

Two  fortressesTower  Hlithal  and  Tower  Ramanathhave

also survived more or less intact. The troops that manned these

structures once guarded Anauria against the goblins of Araugul

(Goblinmount) to the far south and Orlath Wood to the west,

the  nomadic  orc  hordes  from  the  mountains  to  the  east,  the

brigands and monsters from the Hunters Hills to the south, and

occasional outlaw raiders from Asram to the north.

ASRAM

Asram was the second richest of the Lost Kingdoms. Its citizens

organized regular expeditions into the Great Sand Sea to bring

back the lost magic of Netheril as well as its precious metals

(gold, zinc, and copper). In Asram, the Art was widely employed

to meet everyday needs, and the worst excesses of High Netherils

jaded nobles were practiced at all levels of society. Asram was

eventually destroyed by a plague that Talona unleashed during

a deic battle with her rival, Kipyutto. Because the plague still

clings to these ruins, they remain largely untouched.

The remnants of Phelajarama, Asrams capital, lie due west

of the headwaters of the River Tesh, in the southern reaches of

Atars Looking Glass. Although gold-leafed statues of serpents

and  other  treasures  still  lie  within  the  scorched  husks  of  its

ancient villas, the City of the Serpent now stands largely silent

and abandoned, guarded by the threat of Talonas touch. From

time to time, however, the Shadovar come here to experiment

with new workings of the Art, and they delight in demonstrating

their spells on uninvited guests.

In Orolin, the City of Magicians, villas and orchards once

clustered around a circular city core that featured canals, parks,

and a fortress. More than a decade ago, during battles between

the Bedine and the Zhentarim, the canals were poisoned and the

crenellated rampart-walls of the fortress were breached in many

locations. Today, a crumbling fortress surrounded by several acres

of ruined buildings stands in a broad, grassy valley overlooked

by  ridges.  Four  canals  divide  the  citys  remains  into  quarters,

and a fth canal encircles the whole ruin. At the center of the

fortress, an artesian well still bubbles to the surface within an

impressive fountain. The Zhent dead still roam these ruins as a

ravening pack of ghouls under the control of a small band of

Talontar blightlords, who journeyed here after receiving visions

from Talona heralding the imminent outbreak of another great

plague. Bedine legends speak of a ne treasure buried in Oron (as

the ruins are now known), but so far little has been recovered.

Other ruins of Asram include the city of Ulshantir, noted

for its coppersmiths and ne brass goods, and the port city of

Miirsar, whose people once harvested blue-scaled brench and spicy

crabn from the waters of Lake Miir.

HLONDATH

Northerly  Hlondath  was  a  land  of  loggers  and  herders  who

tended sheep, goats, and roth. Hlundites made sturdy wagons,

ne furniture, and paper, and they also shipped raw lumber to

other lands. Hlondath initiated a series of conicts against the

Fair Folk of Cormanthyr in hopes of stealing some greater magic

from them. Instead, these so-called Crown against the Scepter

Wars cost the Hlundites much blood and treasure and brought

them no usable returns. Hlondath nally collapsed as the spread-

ing sands of Anauroch consumed its elds, driving the people

eastward into the Moonsea and Dalelands regions.

The  capital  city  of  Mhaelos  now  lies  beneath  the  drifting

sands of the northeastern Sword, to the north and west of the

mines of Tethyamar. According to Zhentarim spies in the region,

bands of bladesingers from Evermeet have made repeated forays

to the site. Such activity suggests that the Hlundites stole some

item of value from Cormanthyr that remains lost to this day.

The fortied city of Rulvadar, which stood just west of the

Border Forest, served as a bastion of might against marauding

ogres, orcs, and goblinoids of the Moonsea North. From this

refuge, companies of spearmen made repeated forays into the area

now known as the Border Forest. Like its sister city Mhaelos, Rul-

vadar is now buried beneath the Great Sand Sea. The Zhentarim

have partially excavated the central fortress, and from time to

time they post garrisons within this lonely ruin. Such duties were

considered one of the Zhentarims harshest forms of punishment

until the recent discovery of a cache of enspelled, gem-encrusted

circlets dating back to the waning days of the Crown against the

Scepter Wars.

long after the latter was abandoned, leaving only isolated ruins

scattered along the western edge of the Desertsmouth Mountains.

These ruins are home to orcs or worse, and their treasures have

long since been plundered.

Oum  was  a  crossroads  town  that  straddled  the  border  of

Hlondath and Asram. Its people included booksellers, sages, and

proud crafters who made mirrors and glass windows, ne clothing,

jewelry, lamps, pottery, and ironware. Today the town is all but

gone, and its largely wooden buildings have vanished. However,

those who know where to dig occasionally nd valuable trinkets

that can be sold in Cormyr and Sembia, and at least one tome

of lost Netherese lore has been recovered here.

Low Netheril

At its height, Low Netheril was a land of small towns, scattered

enclaves,  and  nomadic  barbarian  tribes.  It  was  surrounded  by

beast-roamed forests and linked to other realms by ying steeds

and y spells rather than roads.

The landbound enclaves of Low Netheril, known as demesnes,

were ruled from mighty towers by lesser arcanists who had not

yet mastered the techniques of creating High Netherils great

oating cities. Each demesne exhibited magical conditions (such

as  green  meadows,  deep  forest,  badlands,  altered  gravity,  and

unusual weather) tailored to the rulers latest whim.

Members  of  the  Netherese  underclass,  known  as  the  Free

Folk, dwelt in tree towns like those of the Eaerlanni elves. Over

the years, the Free Folk began to resent the tyrannical arcanists,

who regarded them as mere cattle and considered them suitable

only for labor and experimentation. They looked to their deities

to lead them to a shining freedom somewhere out of reach of

the archwizards.

The Rengarth and Angardt barbarian tribes roamed the area

north of the Narrow Sea and the western plains formed from

the seabed of the Old Narrow Sea. The Rengarth were deeply

suspicious of magic, and their presence helped to deter the Neth-

erese from settling the northern shores of the Narrow Sea. The

Angardt tribe was originally a Rengarth clan until its members

willingly embraced sorcery, causing a civil war that eventually

divided the tribe.

The  passage  of  time  and  the  scouring  sands  of  Anauroch

have left few ruins in Low Netheril proper. Most of those that

remain,  including  Hlaungadath  (detailed  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting), Rasilith, Runlatha, and Spellgard

(page 100), are buried beneath the drifting sands or encased in

the High Ice. Some are guarded by minions of the phaerimms,

and  a  few  are  still  inhabited.  Travelers  across  the  Great  Sand

Sea often encounter odd magical effects, and some manage to

recover a trinket or minor magic item, but for the most part,

the Empire of Magic has vanished.

INDEPENDENT CITIES

Port Miir was a city of moneylenders and caravan-masters on the

eastern shore of Lake Miir at the western terminus of Berothirs

Trail, which led west to the Twisted Tower of Shadowdale. The

city was ruled by a loose band of wizards who struggled to control

the rampant thievery. An earthquake buried the trail and the city

MINES OF DEKANTER

During the Silver Age, the Netherese established the mines of

Dekanter on the eastern slopes of the Graypeak Mountains. These

mines provided gold, iron, mercury, silver, and platinum to meet

the ever-growing demand for such metals in Netheril. Late in

the Golden Age, the mines played out, but instead of abandoning

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

occurred in western Faern. For nearly two centuries, the Neth-

erese migrated west, south, and east, founding new realms and

merging with other groups to form new ethnicities. By the time

the  sharnsMon  nally  succeeded  in  containing  the  phaerimms,

Netheril was already lost to the sands of history.

Important Sites

The great human empire called Netheril began as the Alliance

of Seventon, a cluster of villages on the southeastern shore of

the Narrow Sea, beneath the region now known as the eastern

High Ice. At its height, Low Netheril occupied the entirety of the

area that the Fair Folk called the Anauroch basin. High Netheril

encompassed all the Netherese oating enclaves, which roamed

throughout  Faern  and  even  beyond.  In  fact,  the  wanderings

of the High Netherese were constrained only by the existence

of certain powerful empires, such as Calimshan, Cormanthyr,

Delzoun, Illefarn, Jhaamdath, Mulhorand, Narfell, Raumathar,

and Unther, that possessed the magical prowess to project their

military might into the skies.

A  disproportionate  number  of  the  surviving  Netherese

ruins are from Low Netheril, primarily because most of High

Netherils oating cities were shattered beyond recognition when

they fell. Most of Low Netherils ruins are outposts and tombs

that were constructed before Karsuss Folly and settlements that

Netherese refugees built after the fall.

Likewise, more Low Netherese artifacts have been found in

the North and the Western Heartlands than in the area that

was Low Netheril, thanks to the encroachment of the High Ice,

the blowing sands of southern Anauroch, and the magic-draining

capabilities of the phaerimms. Most surviving magic items of

Netherese manufacture are not quasi-magic items dependent on

mythallars, since the emigrants and refugees prudently left those

behind.

The Lost Kingdoms

After Karsuss Folly, the oating cities of Asram, Anauria, and

Hlondath (also known as the Three Realms), settled slowly down

to  earth  along  Netherils  southeastern  frontier,  saved  by  the

grace of Mystra. The survivors of these enclaves built realms

of the same names in the remaining fertile lands between the

spreading sands of Anauroch and the region now known as the

Desertsmouth  Mountains.  Although  popular  lore  holds  that

Netheril fell by the hand of Karsus, many scholars consider the

Lost Kingdoms to be the last age of Low Netheril.

ANAURIA

The richest of the Lost Kingdoms was Anauriaa human-ruled

land of humans, elves, and half-elves. The Anaurian nobles hunted

boar, stags, and monstrous game while the farmers produced food

for the Three Realms and enough spare grain to sell to all the

lands about the Inner Sea. Anauria fell to a horde of orcs in 111

DR, but its inhabitants fought with such fury that the ranks of

the victors were as badly depleted as those of the vanquished.

The ruins of Anauria still bear the heraldic marks of its noble

houses: Maluradek (human), Nemrin (human), Nyntynel (elven),

Olyrnn (elven), and Thardresk (human, royal).

The  ruins  of  Amazandar,  Anaurias  capital,  lie  due  west

of Rausrawna (known to Anaurians as Mount Shaddath), the

westernmost peak of the Desertsmouth Mountains. All that now

remains of the so-called City of Gems are a few half-buried ruins

shattered by the might of the orcs, plus the deep mining shafts

beneath the city that give access to still-rich veins of gemstones.

Today,  Amazandars  gem  mines  are  home  to  the  phaerimms

and their minions, including legions of beholder-led orcs twisted

by the fell spells of the phaerimms. The undercroft of a ruined

temple of Jergal reportedly contains the fabulous tomb of King

Thausimbel the Wise and his daughter, Queen Shaddara the Fair.

In truth, it contains a portal leading to the Dungeon of Swords in

the Serpent Hills (see Serpent Kingdoms). This portal is actually

the keystone of a portal network of Anaurian tombs.

The ruins of Anauril, the City of Swords, lie north and east

of Amazandar and due west of the Twisted Tower of Shadowdale.

These ruins are in far better condition than the remains of the

City  of  Gems  because  the  tide  of  orcs  nally  crested  on  the

blades  of  Anaurias  defenders  at  Anauril.  The  City  of  Swords

was named for the ne steel blades manufactured there, many

of which were magically enhanced by the wizards of houses Nyn-

tynel and Olyrnn. An impressive number of these magic swords

are still within the ruins, but they are wielded by the legion of

swordwraithsFF that still defends Anaurils sand-covered walls.

The shattered remnants of Helvara, the main agricultural and

shing center of the realm, are located on the southern shore of

Lake Miir, hard by the anks of the Desertsmouth Mountains.

Two  fortressesTower  Hlithal  and  Tower  Ramanathhave

also survived more or less intact. The troops that manned these

structures once guarded Anauria against the goblins of Araugul

(Goblinmount) to the far south and Orlath Wood to the west,

the  nomadic  orc  hordes  from  the  mountains  to  the  east,  the

brigands and monsters from the Hunters Hills to the south, and

occasional outlaw raiders from Asram to the north.

ASRAM

Asram was the second richest of the Lost Kingdoms. Its citizens

organized regular expeditions into the Great Sand Sea to bring

back the lost magic of Netheril as well as its precious metals

(gold, zinc, and copper). In Asram, the Art was widely employed

to meet everyday needs, and the worst excesses of High Netherils

jaded nobles were practiced at all levels of society. Asram was

eventually destroyed by a plague that Talona unleashed during

a deic battle with her rival, Kipyutto. Because the plague still

clings to these ruins, they remain largely untouched.

The remnants of Phelajarama, Asrams capital, lie due west

of the headwaters of the River Tesh, in the southern reaches of

Atars Looking Glass. Although gold-leafed statues of serpents

and  other  treasures  still  lie  within  the  scorched  husks  of  its

ancient villas, the City of the Serpent now stands largely silent

and abandoned, guarded by the threat of Talonas touch. From

time to time, however, the Shadovar come here to experiment

with new workings of the Art, and they delight in demonstrating

their spells on uninvited guests.

In Orolin, the City of Magicians, villas and orchards once

clustered around a circular city core that featured canals, parks,

and a fortress. More than a decade ago, during battles between

the Bedine and the Zhentarim, the canals were poisoned and the

crenellated rampart-walls of the fortress were breached in many

locations. Today, a crumbling fortress surrounded by several acres

of ruined buildings stands in a broad, grassy valley overlooked

by  ridges.  Four  canals  divide  the  citys  remains  into  quarters,

and a fth canal encircles the whole ruin. At the center of the

fortress, an artesian well still bubbles to the surface within an

impressive fountain. The Zhent dead still roam these ruins as a

ravening pack of ghouls under the control of a small band of

Talontar blightlords, who journeyed here after receiving visions

from Talona heralding the imminent outbreak of another great

plague. Bedine legends speak of a ne treasure buried in Oron (as

the ruins are now known), but so far little has been recovered.

Other ruins of Asram include the city of Ulshantir, noted

for its coppersmiths and ne brass goods, and the port city of

Miirsar, whose people once harvested blue-scaled brench and spicy

crabn from the waters of Lake Miir.

HLONDATH

Northerly  Hlondath  was  a  land  of  loggers  and  herders  who

tended sheep, goats, and roth. Hlundites made sturdy wagons,

ne furniture, and paper, and they also shipped raw lumber to

other lands. Hlondath initiated a series of conicts against the

Fair Folk of Cormanthyr in hopes of stealing some greater magic

from them. Instead, these so-called Crown against the Scepter

Wars cost the Hlundites much blood and treasure and brought

them no usable returns. Hlondath nally collapsed as the spread-

ing sands of Anauroch consumed its elds, driving the people

eastward into the Moonsea and Dalelands regions.

The  capital  city  of  Mhaelos  now  lies  beneath  the  drifting

sands of the northeastern Sword, to the north and west of the

mines of Tethyamar. According to Zhentarim spies in the region,

bands of bladesingers from Evermeet have made repeated forays

to the site. Such activity suggests that the Hlundites stole some

item of value from Cormanthyr that remains lost to this day.

The fortied city of Rulvadar, which stood just west of the

Border Forest, served as a bastion of might against marauding

ogres, orcs, and goblinoids of the Moonsea North. From this

refuge, companies of spearmen made repeated forays into the area

now known as the Border Forest. Like its sister city Mhaelos, Rul-

vadar is now buried beneath the Great Sand Sea. The Zhentarim

have partially excavated the central fortress, and from time to

time they post garrisons within this lonely ruin. Such duties were

considered one of the Zhentarims harshest forms of punishment

until the recent discovery of a cache of enspelled, gem-encrusted

circlets dating back to the waning days of the Crown against the

scattered along the western edge of the Desertsmouth Mountains.

These ruins are home to orcs or worse, and their treasures have

Oum  was  a  crossroads  town  that  straddled  the  border  of

Hlondath and Asram. Its people included booksellers, sages, and

proud crafters who made mirrors and glass windows, ne clothing,

jewelry, lamps, pottery, and ironware. Today the town is all but

At its height, Low Netheril was a land of small towns, scattered

enclaves,  and  nomadic  barbarian  tribes.  It  was  surrounded  by

beast-roamed forests and linked to other realms by ying steeds

and y spells rather than roads.

were ruled from mighty towers by lesser arcanists who had not

The Rengarth and Angardt barbarian tribes roamed the area

north of the Narrow Sea and the western plains formed from

the seabed of the Old Narrow Sea. The Rengarth were deeply

suspicious of magic, and their presence helped to deter the Neth-

erese from settling the northern shores of the Narrow Sea. The

Angardt tribe was originally a Rengarth clan until its members

remain,  including  Hlaungadath  (detailed  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting), Rasilith, Runlatha, and Spellgard

(page 100), are buried beneath the drifting sands or encased in

the High Ice. Some are guarded by minions of the phaerimms,

and  a  few  are  still  inhabited.  Travelers  across  the  Great  Sand

Sea often encounter odd magical effects, and some manage to

the Empire of Magic has vanished.

INDEPENDENT CITIES

Port Miir was a city of moneylenders and caravan-masters on the

eastern shore of Lake Miir at the western terminus of Berothirs

Trail, which led west to the Twisted Tower of Shadowdale. The

city was ruled by a loose band of wizards who struggled to control

MINES OF DEKANTER

During the Silver Age, the Netherese established the mines of

Dekanter on the eastern slopes of the Graypeak Mountains. These

mines provided gold, iron, mercury, silver, and platinum to meet

the ever-growing demand for such metals in Netheril. Late in

the Golden Age, the mines played out, but instead of abandoning

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

them, Netherese arcanists converted them into laboratories for

experimentation in the Art.

Today, the mining complex is an extensive, crumbling ruin

surrounded by low hills (talus piles from the mines). Its inhabit-

ants  include  the  Dekanter  subrace  of  goblins  (see  Monstrous

Compendium:  Monsters  of  Faern),  some  gargoyles,  and  a

mysterious illithilichMon known only as the Beast Lord (LE mind

 ayer lich wizard 15). The mines are laden with the dangerous

legacies of untested Netherese spellcasting, but rumor holds that

their tunnels still harbor a few valuable treasures.

RASILITH

The  ancient  city  of  Rasilith  served  as  the  capital  of  ancient

Thaeravel, the Land of Alabaster Towers, for centuries before the

Alliance of Seventon was founded. While Netheril expanded south

and west, the sorcerers of Thaeravel grew old and decadent, with-

drawing into their towers to further their studies of the Art.

At  the  end  of  the  Nether  Age,  the  arcanists  of  Netheril,

armed with newfound knowledge gleaned from the nether scrolls,

overran the Land of Alabaster Towers. The attackers ripped many

spells previously unknown to them from the minds of captive

Thaeravelian sorcerers, reducing them to gibbering husks. The

fate of those who  ed is unknown, although some speculate that

they transformed themselves into phaerimms and eventually had

their revenge.

The only known trace of lost Thaeravel is the legendary Float-

ing Tower, the home and later the tomb of Ondil of the Many

Spells. Ondil  ed the fall of Rasilith to the area that would later

become Athalantar. Centuries ago, his tower was plundered by the

Bright Blades adventuring band (including a young Elminster

Aumar). Today, nothing is left of the tower except a few twinkling

motes of magic dancing in the vale north of Secomber where it

once stood.

After the fall of Thaeravel, Rasilith became an important

garrison city in southern Netheril. Arcanists eager to acquire new

knowledge of the Art from Thaeravels ancient runes descended on

the city in droves. Rasilith gradually faded in importance during

the Mythallar Era and was one of the  rst cities abandoned to

the phaerimms during the Shadowed Age.

Today,  this  ancient  city  lies  half  buried  in  the  depths  of

the  Quarter  of  Emptiness,  encircled  by  walls  of  thick,  gray

stone. Inside the walls, alabaster towers ring a central fortress

of later construction. In the courtyard of the fortress is a well

that leads down to a warren of caverns ruled by the phaerimms

and guarded by their asabiSK servitors. Any surviving remnants

of  Thaeravelian  lore  are  probably  in  the  hands  of  the  elder

phaerimms in that settlement.

RUNLATHA

Runlatha (or Northreach, in the Loross tongue), was founded

during  Netherils  First  Age  and  became  a  thriving  port  once

trade relations had been established with the dwarves of Ascore.

After the mines of Dekanter were established, Runlatha gradually

reverted to a backwater town. During the Age of Discovery, it

was ruled by a cruel arcanist who delighted in imprisoning and

torturing exotic creatures from other lands and planes.

Exploring the mines of Dekanter

106

Runlathas ruler died during the fall of High Netheril. Shortly

thereafter, a charismatic warrior known as the Bey of Runlatha

assembled a host of Free Folk from the surrounding lands and

led them west to Ascore by way of the Lowroad with the aid of

some dwarf rangers. From there, the Runlathan refugees marched

slowly westward across the Northkingdom, hoping to found a

new realm in lands as yet unclaimed.

The bey and his dream died on the western border of Delzoun.

Three former prisoners of Runlathas late rulera nalfeshnee

named Zukothoth, a rakshasa named Ickshar, and a mind  ayer

named Xssa of Ellyntaaltracked the refugees down. Driven

nearly mad by the torture they had endured and lacking a better

target on which to vent their fury, they attacked the bey and

his followers. Though he died in that battle, the bey managed to

collapse a cavern on his attackers. Zukothoth was killed and

returned to the Abyss, but Ickshar and Xssa were trapped in

stasis by an arcanist ally and buried in the subsequent cave-in.

After the beys death, his followers scattered and reverted to a

primitive way of life. Among the Uthgardt tribes, who trace their

ancestry back to the Runlathan refugees and some Illuskan reav-

ers driven inland, the bey is remembered in myths as Beorunna

(Berun in the Illuskan tongue), the father of Uthgar.

The remains of Runlatha are buried beneath the High Ice

and no longer accessible, but the ancient citys legacy lives on

in many of the prized Uthgardt magic weapons that have been

handed down from generation to generation. Ickshar and Xssa

remain  trapped  in  the  depths  of  their  subterranean  cavern,

which now lies beneath the Uthgardt ancestor mound known as

Beorunnas Well. Buried with them is a vast fortune in Netherese

treasures, as well a wide variety of slimes, jellies, molds, and

insectoid creatures.

Netherese Colonies

Netherese arcanists  rst began exploring the lands to the west

of  Eaerlann  at  the  urging  of  the  Terraseer,  who  sought  to

establish a spy outpost from which he could observe the Fair

Folk of Illefarn. Although the  rst such colony lasted only two

hundred sixty- ve years, its unintended success as a trademeet

inspired the founding of other sites, such as Tzindylspar, the

Selskar  Orders  Tower  of  the  Star  (see  Dungeon  #101),  and

magocratic Illusk (see page 144). Although some scholars include

such colonies within greater Low Netheril, all were constructed

before Karsuss Folly and yet independent of the High Mages

of Netheril. Thus, they were part of neither Low Netheril nor

the postfall Netherese Diaspora.

OLD OWL WELL

North of the Sword Mountains, along the remnants of the trade

route  that  once  linked  the  dwarven  port  city  of  Barrhindlun

with Delzoun, lie the ruins of a Netherese outpost built at the

direction  of  the  Terraseer.  The  mysterious  arcanist  convinced

the High Mages of Netheril to build a spy outpost at that spot

so that they could observe events in Illefarn.

Unbeknownst to the Netherese, the Terraseer had a hidden

agenda. Beneath the site, a large supply of chardalynsLD lay in

an ancient vault that the sarrukh had built in the waning days

of  Isstossef  l.  But  the  captive  deepspawn  that  guarded  the

vault performed their task all too wellthe constant stream of

magical beasts they disgorged made the region too dangerous to

settle. So the Terraseer sought an empire with enough might to

overcome the dangers and recover the chardalyns.

At great military cost, the Netherese destroyed wave upon

wave of magical beasts and eventually succeeded in establishing

the outpost, which they named Quesseer. Netherese scouts then

tracked  the  remaining  magical  beasts  back  to  their  caverns,

defeated the deepspawn therein, and recovered an unimaginable

supply of chardalyns. This chance discovery in turn led to a

great deal of research into gem magic (see Magic of Faern),

which may have been the Terraseers intent all along.

Thanks  to  the  great  battles  necessary  to  secure  the  site,

however,  the  elves  of  Illefarn  were  well  aware  of  the  outpost

by the time it was  nally established. Since its original purpose

had been compromised and it lay in unclaimed wilderness at the

nexus of several diverse communities, Quesseer instead became

a  trademeet  for  Netherese  expatriates,  Illuskan  seafarers,  Ice

Hunter tribesmen, Illefarni elves, and the isolated shield dwarf

clans of fallen Haunghdannar. The outpost was notable for its

elaborately constructed well, which still delivers bountiful, clean,

fresh water, and for the large number of magical beasts (primarily

owlbears) that continued to plague the surrounding region.

Less than three centuries after its construction, Quesseer was

abandoned when Illusk fell to a great orc horde. Since then, Old

Owl Well, as the outposts well is called, has served as an excellent

water source for passing caravans. Various monsters, humanoid

tribes, and power groups have claimed Quesseer as a lair, but the

traders in the region always hire mercenary companies to drive

out the usurpers. The most recent occupant was an orc tribe that

heeded the visions of its shaman and marched on Triboar, only

to be consumed by Claugiyliamatar, the ancient green dragon of

the Kryptgarden Forest.

Since  the  destruction  of  the  orcs,  Old  Owl  Well  has  once

again  been  open  to  passing  merchants  and  adventurers.  The

underground caverns from which it draws its water may contain

still more vaults of the sarrukhSK, as yet undiscovered, though

those too might contain deepspawn guardians (see page 166).

TZINDYLSPAR

In the western Nether Mountains, just north of Silverymoon

Pass and northeast of Silverymoon, lie the buried remnants of

Tzindylspar, the legendary City of Rubies founded by Netherese

emigrants and the Stout Folk of Old Delzoun. The inhabitants

of Tzindylspar grew wealthy mining a rich vein of ruby beneath

the city. They traded their raw and cut gems with the far-off

kingdom of Calimshan via a portal created by an enterprising

Netherese arcanist. During the Cajaan Dynasty, a steady stream

of rubies  owed south through the portal. The Calishites used the

stones as currency, and ruby jewelry (especially pectorals) from

Tzindylspar quickly became the rage among the Calishite elite.

Since few people from Calimshan were willing to visit the frigid

northern city, most Calishite noble houses dispatched hal ing

trade representatives to Tzindylspar to manage their affairs.

The fall of the Cajaan Dynasty to the beholders of the Alimir

Hive precipitated a sudden collapse in Tzindylspars ruby trade.

them, Netherese arcanists converted them into laboratories for

experimentation in the Art.

Today, the mining complex is an extensive, crumbling ruin

surrounded by low hills (talus piles from the mines). Its inhabit-

ants  include  the  Dekanter  subrace  of  goblins  (see  Monstrous

Compendium:  Monsters  of  Faern),  some  gargoyles,  and  a

mysterious illithilichMon known only as the Beast Lord (LE mind

 ayer lich wizard 15). The mines are laden with the dangerous

legacies of untested Netherese spellcasting, but rumor holds that

their tunnels still harbor a few valuable treasures.

RASILITH

The  ancient  city  of  Rasilith  served  as  the  capital  of  ancient

Thaeravel, the Land of Alabaster Towers, for centuries before the

Alliance of Seventon was founded. While Netheril expanded south

and west, the sorcerers of Thaeravel grew old and decadent, with-

drawing into their towers to further their studies of the Art.

At  the  end  of  the  Nether  Age,  the  arcanists  of  Netheril,

armed with newfound knowledge gleaned from the nether scrolls,

overran the Land of Alabaster Towers. The attackers ripped many

spells previously unknown to them from the minds of captive

Thaeravelian sorcerers, reducing them to gibbering husks. The

fate of those who  ed is unknown, although some speculate that

they transformed themselves into phaerimms and eventually had

their revenge.

The only known trace of lost Thaeravel is the legendary Float-

ing Tower, the home and later the tomb of Ondil of the Many

Spells. Ondil  ed the fall of Rasilith to the area that would later

become Athalantar. Centuries ago, his tower was plundered by the

Bright Blades adventuring band (including a young Elminster

Aumar). Today, nothing is left of the tower except a few twinkling

motes of magic dancing in the vale north of Secomber where it

once stood.

After the fall of Thaeravel, Rasilith became an important

garrison city in southern Netheril. Arcanists eager to acquire new

knowledge of the Art from Thaeravels ancient runes descended on

the city in droves. Rasilith gradually faded in importance during

the Mythallar Era and was one of the  rst cities abandoned to

the phaerimms during the Shadowed Age.

Today,  this  ancient  city  lies  half  buried  in  the  depths  of

the  Quarter  of  Emptiness,  encircled  by  walls  of  thick,  gray

stone. Inside the walls, alabaster towers ring a central fortress

of later construction. In the courtyard of the fortress is a well

that leads down to a warren of caverns ruled by the phaerimms

and guarded by their asabiSK servitors. Any surviving remnants

of  Thaeravelian  lore  are  probably  in  the  hands  of  the  elder

phaerimms in that settlement.

RUNLATHA

Runlatha (or Northreach, in the Loross tongue), was founded

during  Netherils  First  Age  and  became  a  thriving  port  once

trade relations had been established with the dwarves of Ascore.

After the mines of Dekanter were established, Runlatha gradually

reverted to a backwater town. During the Age of Discovery, it

was ruled by a cruel arcanist who delighted in imprisoning and

torturing exotic creatures from other lands and planes.

Runlathas ruler died during the fall of High Netheril. Shortly

thereafter, a charismatic warrior known as the Bey of Runlatha

assembled a host of Free Folk from the surrounding lands and

led them west to Ascore by way of the Lowroad with the aid of

some dwarf rangers. From there, the Runlathan refugees marched

slowly westward across the Northkingdom, hoping to found a

new realm in lands as yet unclaimed.

The bey and his dream died on the western border of Delzoun.

Three former prisoners of Runlathas late rulera nalfeshnee

named Zukothoth, a rakshasa named Ickshar, and a mind  ayer

named Xssa of Ellyntaaltracked the refugees down. Driven

nearly mad by the torture they had endured and lacking a better

target on which to vent their fury, they attacked the bey and

his followers. Though he died in that battle, the bey managed to

collapse a cavern on his attackers. Zukothoth was killed and

returned to the Abyss, but Ickshar and Xssa were trapped in

stasis by an arcanist ally and buried in the subsequent cave-in.

After the beys death, his followers scattered and reverted to a

primitive way of life. Among the Uthgardt tribes, who trace their

ancestry back to the Runlathan refugees and some Illuskan reav-

ers driven inland, the bey is remembered in myths as Beorunna

(Berun in the Illuskan tongue), the father of Uthgar.

The remains of Runlatha are buried beneath the High Ice

and no longer accessible, but the ancient citys legacy lives on

in many of the prized Uthgardt magic weapons that have been

handed down from generation to generation. Ickshar and Xssa

remain  trapped  in  the  depths  of  their  subterranean  cavern,

which now lies beneath the Uthgardt ancestor mound known as

Beorunnas Well. Buried with them is a vast fortune in Netherese

treasures, as well a wide variety of slimes, jellies, molds, and

insectoid creatures.

Netherese Colonies

Netherese arcanists  rst began exploring the lands to the west

of  Eaerlann  at  the  urging  of  the  Terraseer,  who  sought  to

establish a spy outpost from which he could observe the Fair

Folk of Illefarn. Although the  rst such colony lasted only two

hundred sixty- ve years, its unintended success as a trademeet

inspired the founding of other sites, such as Tzindylspar, the

Selskar  Orders  Tower  of  the  Star  (see  Dungeon  #101),  and

magocratic Illusk (see page 144). Although some scholars include

such colonies within greater Low Netheril, all were constructed

before Karsuss Folly and yet independent of the High Mages

of Netheril. Thus, they were part of neither Low Netheril nor

the postfall Netherese Diaspora.

OLD OWL WELL

North of the Sword Mountains, along the remnants of the trade

route  that  once  linked  the  dwarven  port  city  of  Barrhindlun

with Delzoun, lie the ruins of a Netherese outpost built at the

direction  of  the  Terraseer.  The  mysterious  arcanist  convinced

the High Mages of Netheril to build a spy outpost at that spot

so that they could observe events in Illefarn.

Unbeknownst to the Netherese, the Terraseer had a hidden

agenda. Beneath the site, a large supply of chardalynsLD lay in

an ancient vault that the sarrukh had built in the waning days

of  Isstossef  l.  But  the  captive  deepspawn  that  guarded  the

vault performed their task all too wellthe constant stream of

magical beasts they disgorged made the region too dangerous to

settle. So the Terraseer sought an empire with enough might to

overcome the dangers and recover the chardalyns.

At great military cost, the Netherese destroyed wave upon

wave of magical beasts and eventually succeeded in establishing

the outpost, which they named Quesseer. Netherese scouts then

tracked  the  remaining  magical  beasts  back  to  their  caverns,

defeated the deepspawn therein, and recovered an unimaginable

supply of chardalyns. This chance discovery in turn led to a

great deal of research into gem magic (see Magic of Faern),

which may have been the Terraseers intent all along.

Thanks  to  the  great  battles  necessary  to  secure  the  site,

however,  the  elves  of  Illefarn  were  well  aware  of  the  outpost

by the time it was  nally established. Since its original purpose

had been compromised and it lay in unclaimed wilderness at the

nexus of several diverse communities, Quesseer instead became

a  trademeet  for  Netherese  expatriates,  Illuskan  seafarers,  Ice

Hunter tribesmen, Illefarni elves, and the isolated shield dwarf

clans of fallen Haunghdannar. The outpost was notable for its

elaborately constructed well, which still delivers bountiful, clean,

fresh water, and for the large number of magical beasts (primarily

owlbears) that continued to plague the surrounding region.

Less than three centuries after its construction, Quesseer was

abandoned when Illusk fell to a great orc horde. Since then, Old

Owl Well, as the outposts well is called, has served as an excellent

water source for passing caravans. Various monsters, humanoid

tribes, and power groups have claimed Quesseer as a lair, but the

traders in the region always hire mercenary companies to drive

out the usurpers. The most recent occupant was an orc tribe that

heeded the visions of its shaman and marched on Triboar, only

to be consumed by Claugiyliamatar, the ancient green dragon of

the Kryptgarden Forest.

Since  the  destruction  of  the  orcs,  Old  Owl  Well  has  once

again  been  open  to  passing  merchants  and  adventurers.  The

underground caverns from which it draws its water may contain

still more vaults of the sarrukhSK, as yet undiscovered, though

those too might contain deepspawn guardians (see page 166).

TZINDYLSPAR

In the western Nether Mountains, just north of Silverymoon

Pass and northeast of Silverymoon, lie the buried remnants of

Tzindylspar, the legendary City of Rubies founded by Netherese

emigrants and the Stout Folk of Old Delzoun. The inhabitants

of Tzindylspar grew wealthy mining a rich vein of ruby beneath

the city. They traded their raw and cut gems with the far-off

kingdom of Calimshan via a portal created by an enterprising

Netherese arcanist. During the Cajaan Dynasty, a steady stream

of rubies  owed south through the portal. The Calishites used the

stones as currency, and ruby jewelry (especially pectorals) from

Tzindylspar quickly became the rage among the Calishite elite.

Since few people from Calimshan were willing to visit the frigid

northern city, most Calishite noble houses dispatched hal ing

trade representatives to Tzindylspar to manage their affairs.

The fall of the Cajaan Dynasty to the beholders of the Alimir

Hive precipitated a sudden collapse in Tzindylspars ruby trade.

107

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

One of the last Calishites to visit the City of Rubies was Ynamalik

Nadim yn Rahimat el Cajaan, a powerful sorcerer-prince who

suspected that Tzindylspars rich vein of ruby encompassed an

earth node. Seeking a new base of power beyond the reach of

the eye tyrants, Ynamalik Nadim and several members of his

family returned to the City of Rubies the following year, bring-

ing a small army through the portal with them. Unprepared

for an attack by their erstwhile trading partners, the defenders

of Tzindylspar were no match for the invading Calishites, and

within a tenday all the citys residents had been either slaughtered

or enslaved.

At Nadims direction, the Calishites transformed the earth

node into a shrine of the dao (see Manual of the Planes) like those

that were prevalent during the Vahlen and Erehnir dynasties,

when genie worship was common. Nadim planned to summon an

army from the Elemental Plane of Earth and use it to overthrow

the beholders. But Nadim died of heartstop, and his followers

lacked the magical expertise to open a permanent portal to an

elemental plane without him. Since Nadim had sealed the portal

back to Calimshan with a gate seal spell, most of his followers

took their chances in the northern wilderness.

Almost eight centuries later, an earthquake buried the remains

of  Tzindylspar,  erasing  it  from  the  surface  of  Faern.  Four

hundred years after that, a second powerful earthquake shook

the  northwestern  Nether  Mountains,  collapsing  Tzindylspars

connection with the surface and opening new underground caverns

that linked its lower mines with the Fardrimm. Over time, a

steady trickle of monsters from the Realms Below wandered up

into the city and established lairs therein. Eventually, a small

band of mind ayers of the Tamer creed claimed the ruins of

Tzindylspar and built a settlement in which they could conduct

breeding experiments.

In centuries that followed, the illithids of Tzindylspar grew

in strength and number and bred all sorts of monstrous thralls.

The  desirable  ones  were  fed  to  captive  deepspawn  for  perfect

replication, while the rejects were consumed by the mind ayers.

The illithids plan for regional conquest faltered when a third

powerful earthquake shook the region, destroying much of the

city and killing most of its inhabitants. The tremor also dam-

aged the portal linking Tzindylspar with Calimshan, causing it

to malfunction. However, at least one deepspawn and one illithid

survived  the  quake.  The  mind  ayer  eventually  transformed

itself into an illithilich and became consumed with the study

of node magic. It has spent the last few decades exploring the

subterranean reaches of the Fardrimm and only rarely returns

to its lair.

In the Year of the Ruby Pendant (845 DR), a shield dwarf

prospector of the Fardrimm returned to Silverymoon bearing

a ruby-encrusted pectoral fashioned in the style of Calimshans

Second Age. He spoke of a ruined city buried in the heart of

a mountain overrun with monsters. But before he could lead a

return  expedition,  the  dwarf  was  decapitated  in  his  sleep,  and

the pectoral was stolen. Intrigued, scholars of the Ladys Col-

lege unearthed ancient accounts referring to the Ruby City of

Tzindylspar, but a subsequent wave of explorers failed to discover

any trace of the lost city on the surface, thanks to the destructive

effects of the earthquakes. In the centuries since, a few intrepid

adventurers have sought to rediscover the dwarfs trail through

the Fardrimm to the lower mines of Tzindylspar, and from there

to the city. As yet, however, none who have sought the passage

have returned.

Shattered Cities

At  its  height,  High  Netheril  boasted  fty-four  oating  cities,

nearly  all  of  which  were  destroyed  by  Karsuss  folly.  A  few,

however,  met  their  ends  in  other  ways.  Aquessir  (Shadowtop

Borough) fell three years before Karsuss Folly when its mythal-

lar failed, and ill-planned spell research obliterated Maunator

(Sunrest) during the Golden Age. The spells of the phaerimms

brought down Lhaoda and Tith Tilendrothael. Cities shattered in

the Fall of High Netheril included Akintaer (Quagmire), Delia,

Doubloon,  Eileanar  (enclave  of  Karsus),  Farenwey  (Yeomans

Loft), Jethaere, Jiksidur, Jockteleg, Lathery, Nhalloth, Orbedal

(Sanctuary), Palter, Phylornel (Buoyance), Sakkors, Spiel, Xinlenal

(enclave of Ioulaum), and many others whose names have been

lost to history. Of all the cities destroyed by Karsuss Folly, the

remains of only threeJiksidur, Nhalloth, and Sakkorshave

been located and identied. A fourth may lie in the depths of the

Korinn Archipelago, and a fth is said to be in the northwestern

reaches of Anauroch.

JIKSIDUR

At the time Karsus cast his fateful spell, the enclave of Jiksi-

dur was high above eastern Faern spying on the empires of

Narfell  and  Raumathar.  Larloch,  Sorcerer-King  of  Jiksidur,

was warned by contingency magic that the enclaves doom was

imminent, so he abandoned it on dragonback just before its fall.

As a consequence of that action, the city turned upside down

during its descent and was crushed under its own bulk upon

impact. Agents of the Nentyarch of Narfell tunneled into the

sheared-off peak shortly after its fall to salvage what treasures

they could nd.

The  remnants  of  Jiksidur  now  form  the  mountain  known

as  Harks  Finger,  which  rises  incongruously  from  the  plains

of  Narfell.  Some  of  Jiksidurs  treasures  now  lie  in  the  tombs

of  Narfells  demonbinders,  and  Larloch  managed  to  recover

others through barter with Szass Tam, the Thayan Zulkir of

Necromancy, by giving him two artifacts (the Death Moon Orb

and  Thakorsils  Seat)  in  return.  Many  of  Jiksidurs  treasures,

however, still lie buried beneath the mountains roots.

NHALLOTH

The enclave of Nhalloth lies under nearly 200 feet of water

in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Its resting place is about 19 miles

northwest of Thonns Fist (also called Vosos), the northernmost

large island of the archipelago that lies off the southern coast

of the Altumbel Peninsula. Nearly nine hundred years old as a

oating city at the time of Karsuss Folly, Nhalloth has been

underwater for more than seventeen centuries. It was discovered

by surface dwellers in the Year of the Creeping Fang (1305 DR).

Since then, innumerable treasure seekers have scoured it, but few

have come away with more than awe at the architecture that

remains intact despite the fall and the seas erosion.

SAKKORS

The enclave of Sakkors, already some eighteen centuries old at

the time of the fall, tumbled from a height of hundreds of feet

into the Sea of Fallen Stars just south of the modern-day site of

Urmlaspyr. It continued its rapid plunge on an angle, striking the

edge of the continental slope and rolling into the Plains of Duna,

where it crushed three small sea elf and merfolk colonies as well

as its own surface architecture. It nally came to a halt with a

great impact about 90 miles south and 630 feet below sea level.

Sakkors is now little more than a pile of rubble honeycombed

with dangerous magical effects that have been corrupted by time

and the sea. Hundreds of quasi-magic items and a few artifacts

are buried beneath silt and rubble along Sakkors 15-mile-long

path. After sixteen hundred years in the water, however, very

little remains recognizable, and still less remains usable.

Surviving Cities

Two oating cities of High Netheril survived Karsuss Folly by

escaping to other planes.

SELNARRA

Selnarra (Opus in the Loross tongue) escaped destruction by

the grace of the Moonmaiden, who transferred the enclave and

its  entire  population  to  the  Gates  of  the  Moon  (see  Players

Guide to Faern).  Today,  Selnarra  continues  to  oat  in  that

planes  moonlit  sky,  untouched  by  the  passage  of  time.  The

Selnarrans of the current era are aasimar descended from the

rescued Netherese and Selnes servitors. A few Selnarrans have

visited Faern, but they are considered nonnative outsiders when

resident on Abeir-Toril.

THULTANTHAR

Thultanthar  (Shade  in  the  Loross  tongue)  escaped  into  the

Plane of Shadow, where its inhabitants battled the malaugrym

and other horrors of that shadowy world for generations before

returning to Faern in the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR). The

City of Shade, as it is now known, and its inhabitants are further

detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, Lords of

Darkness, and Players Guide to Faern.

Western Diaspora

The lifedrain spells of the phaerimms coupled with the literal fall

of High Netheril precipitated one of the greatest migrations of

humanity that has ever occurred in western Faern. From 461

DR to 333 DR, Netherese refugees moved west and southwest

into the lands now known as the Silver Marches, the Backlands,

and  Sunset  Vale.  Those  who  followed  the  northern  mountain

passes were welcomed by the shield dwarves of Citadel Sundbarr

(see Silver Marches) and the Fair Folk of Eaerlann. In time, the

elven city of Ascalhorn was given over to the Netherese refugees

on the condition that they help defend Eaerlann and foreswear

the use of their forebears most dangerous arcane practices.

Those few who had embraced Karsus as a savior were perse-

cuted for their beliefs. They made their way to his petried corpse

in the High Forest and built the city of Karse at its foot.

The survivors who migrated down the twin waterways now

known as the Winding Water and the River Reaching merged

with Calishites, Chondathans, and Talr to form edgling realms

such as the Duchy of Indoria, which was located in the region

now known as the Fields of the Dead. Some migrated to planned

subterranean cities such as Gauntlgrym (see page 143) and the

Netherese Caverns of Philock (see Underdark), while others used

the Art to craft new cities, such as Helbrester.

HELBRESTER (THE SUNSET TOWERS)

This fortied city of linked towers rose like a hand reaching for

the stars from a low-lying island just east of the site of Irphong.

Its famed towers were great cylinders built of green-hued local

island stone by a small group of refugees from Low Netheril. They

chose to settle in the Nelanther Isles because weakened Calishite

control over the region allowed them to establish an independent

realm fairly close to many population centers.

The city consisted of towers built so close together, and linked

on so many levels, that only seabirds and creeping beasts could

use the spaces between. Great domed crystal ceilings were raised

over many towers to allow light into the gardenlike interiors of

large halls, but the smaller rooms and passages existed in almost

perpetual gloom, illuminated by oating driftglobes.

The founders of Helbrester used magic to prolong their lives

and  became  known  as  elders.  Preferring  to  spend  their  time

in  arcane  studies,  they  favored  a  policy  of  isolation  from  the

world. Though the elders constructed a number of portals to the

mainland, they used them only to magically abduct beasts they

wanted to dine on or steal items they wanted to possess.

As  time  passed,  the  original  elders  died  or  withdrew  into

seclusion,  acquiring  an  age-crazed  reputation  among  their

descendants.  Meanwhile,  Helbresters  population  swelled  with

their offspring and the children of their unions with abducted

mainland folk. These new Helbrestans began to trade with other

realms and set up their city as a reprovisioning and repair port

for ships plying the Sword Coast. When pirates sought to seize

control of Helbrester, the elders blasted the intruders and their

ships with powerful spells, winning Helbrester a touch-it-not

reputation.

Mainlanders seeking freedom from various forms of oppres-

sion sailed to the Sunset Towers in hopes of settling there and

were usually accepted. The city slowly grew into a neutral-ground

port used by pirates and merchant shippers alike, though many

coastal Tethyrians considered it a pirate power waiting to erupt.

Helbrester was governed by the Lords and Ladiesthe heads

of twelve of its most senior families, including Arathtaea, Hal-

lowhand, Iyrimsar, and Kolthund.

Unbeknownst  to  the  Helbrestans,  two  elders  named  Thak-

loamur and Mingaudorr, who had retired from public life many

years before, were still lurking in hidden, spell-guarded rooms and

passages. Eventually, they attained two different and imperfect

forms of lichdom. Both forms of undeath required the liches to

subsume energy (life essence for Thakloamur, and spell power for

Mingaudorr) from time to time, or crumble away. So Thakloamur

became a kidnapper and murderer, and Mingaudorr a thief of

magic. The two managed to elude detection for some years by

preying almost exclusively on visiting outlanders, although dark

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

One of the last Calishites to visit the City of Rubies was Ynamalik

Nadim yn Rahimat el Cajaan, a powerful sorcerer-prince who

suspected that Tzindylspars rich vein of ruby encompassed an

earth node. Seeking a new base of power beyond the reach of

the eye tyrants, Ynamalik Nadim and several members of his

family returned to the City of Rubies the following year, bring-

for an attack by their erstwhile trading partners, the defenders

of Tzindylspar were no match for the invading Calishites, and

within a tenday all the citys residents had been either slaughtered

or enslaved.

At Nadims direction, the Calishites transformed the earth

node into a shrine of the dao (see Manual of the Planes) like those

that were prevalent during the Vahlen and Erehnir dynasties,

when genie worship was common. Nadim planned to summon an

army from the Elemental Plane of Earth and use it to overthrow

the beholders. But Nadim died of heartstop, and his followers

lacked the magical expertise to open a permanent portal to an

elemental plane without him. Since Nadim had sealed the portal

back to Calimshan with a gate seal spell, most of his followers

took their chances in the northern wilderness.

Almost eight centuries later, an earthquake buried the remains

of  Tzindylspar,  erasing  it  from  the  surface  of  Faern.  Four

hundred years after that, a second powerful earthquake shook

the  northwestern  Nether  Mountains,  collapsing  Tzindylspars

connection with the surface and opening new underground caverns

that linked its lower mines with the Fardrimm. Over time, a

steady trickle of monsters from the Realms Below wandered up

into the city and established lairs therein. Eventually, a small

band of mind ayers of the Tamer creed claimed the ruins of

Tzindylspar and built a settlement in which they could conduct

breeding experiments.

In centuries that followed, the illithids of Tzindylspar grew

in strength and number and bred all sorts of monstrous thralls.

The  desirable  ones  were  fed  to  captive  deepspawn  for  perfect

replication, while the rejects were consumed by the mind ayers.

The illithids plan for regional conquest faltered when a third

powerful earthquake shook the region, destroying much of the

city and killing most of its inhabitants. The tremor also dam-

aged the portal linking Tzindylspar with Calimshan, causing it

to malfunction. However, at least one deepspawn and one illithid

survived  the  quake.  The  mind  ayer  eventually  transformed

itself into an illithilich and became consumed with the study

of node magic. It has spent the last few decades exploring the

subterranean reaches of the Fardrimm and only rarely returns

to its lair.

In the Year of the Ruby Pendant (845 DR), a shield dwarf

prospector of the Fardrimm returned to Silverymoon bearing

a ruby-encrusted pectoral fashioned in the style of Calimshans

Second Age. He spoke of a ruined city buried in the heart of

a mountain overrun with monsters. But before he could lead a

return  expedition,  the  dwarf  was  decapitated  in  his  sleep,  and

the pectoral was stolen. Intrigued, scholars of the Ladys Col-

lege unearthed ancient accounts referring to the Ruby City of

Tzindylspar, but a subsequent wave of explorers failed to discover

any trace of the lost city on the surface, thanks to the destructive

effects of the earthquakes. In the centuries since, a few intrepid

adventurers have sought to rediscover the dwarfs trail through

the Fardrimm to the lower mines of Tzindylspar, and from there

to the city. As yet, however, none who have sought the passage

have returned.

Shattered Cities

At  its  height,  High  Netheril  boasted  fty-four  oating  cities,

nearly  all  of  which  were  destroyed  by  Karsuss  folly.  A  few,

however,  met  their  ends  in  other  ways.  Aquessir  (Shadowtop

Borough) fell three years before Karsuss Folly when its mythal-

lar failed, and ill-planned spell research obliterated Maunator

(Sunrest) during the Golden Age. The spells of the phaerimms

brought down Lhaoda and Tith Tilendrothael. Cities shattered in

the Fall of High Netheril included Akintaer (Quagmire), Delia,

Doubloon,  Eileanar  (enclave  of  Karsus),  Farenwey  (Yeomans

Loft), Jethaere, Jiksidur, Jockteleg, Lathery, Nhalloth, Orbedal

(Sanctuary), Palter, Phylornel (Buoyance), Sakkors, Spiel, Xinlenal

(enclave of Ioulaum), and many others whose names have been

lost to history. Of all the cities destroyed by Karsuss Folly, the

remains of only threeJiksidur, Nhalloth, and Sakkorshave

been located and identied. A fourth may lie in the depths of the

Korinn Archipelago, and a fth is said to be in the northwestern

reaches of Anauroch.

JIKSIDUR

At the time Karsus cast his fateful spell, the enclave of Jiksi-

dur was high above eastern Faern spying on the empires of

Narfell  and  Raumathar.  Larloch,  Sorcerer-King  of  Jiksidur,

was warned by contingency magic that the enclaves doom was

imminent, so he abandoned it on dragonback just before its fall.

As a consequence of that action, the city turned upside down

during its descent and was crushed under its own bulk upon

impact. Agents of the Nentyarch of Narfell tunneled into the

sheared-off peak shortly after its fall to salvage what treasures

they could nd.

The  remnants  of  Jiksidur  now  form  the  mountain  known

as  Harks  Finger,  which  rises  incongruously  from  the  plains

of  Narfell.  Some  of  Jiksidurs  treasures  now  lie  in  the  tombs

of  Narfells  demonbinders,  and  Larloch  managed  to  recover

others through barter with Szass Tam, the Thayan Zulkir of

Necromancy, by giving him two artifacts (the Death Moon Orb

and  Thakorsils  Seat)  in  return.  Many  of  Jiksidurs  treasures,

however, still lie buried beneath the mountains roots.

NHALLOTH

The enclave of Nhalloth lies under nearly 200 feet of water

in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Its resting place is about 19 miles

northwest of Thonns Fist (also called Vosos), the northernmost

large island of the archipelago that lies off the southern coast

of the Altumbel Peninsula. Nearly nine hundred years old as a

oating city at the time of Karsuss Folly, Nhalloth has been

underwater for more than seventeen centuries. It was discovered

by surface dwellers in the Year of the Creeping Fang (1305 DR).

Since then, innumerable treasure seekers have scoured it, but few

have come away with more than awe at the architecture that

remains intact despite the fall and the seas erosion.

SAKKORS

The enclave of Sakkors, already some eighteen centuries old at

the time of the fall, tumbled from a height of hundreds of feet

into the Sea of Fallen Stars just south of the modern-day site of

Urmlaspyr. It continued its rapid plunge on an angle, striking the

edge of the continental slope and rolling into the Plains of Duna,

where it crushed three small sea elf and merfolk colonies as well

as its own surface architecture. It nally came to a halt with a

great impact about 90 miles south and 630 feet below sea level.

Sakkors is now little more than a pile of rubble honeycombed

with dangerous magical effects that have been corrupted by time

and the sea. Hundreds of quasi-magic items and a few artifacts

are buried beneath silt and rubble along Sakkors 15-mile-long

path. After sixteen hundred years in the water, however, very

little remains recognizable, and still less remains usable.

Surviving Cities

Two oating cities of High Netheril survived Karsuss Folly by

escaping to other planes.

SELNARRA

Selnarra (Opus in the Loross tongue) escaped destruction by

the grace of the Moonmaiden, who transferred the enclave and

its  entire  population  to  the  Gates  of  the  Moon  (see  Players

Guide to Faern).  Today,  Selnarra  continues  to  oat  in  that

planes  moonlit  sky,  untouched  by  the  passage  of  time.  The

Selnarrans of the current era are aasimar descended from the

rescued Netherese and Selnes servitors. A few Selnarrans have

visited Faern, but they are considered nonnative outsiders when

resident on Abeir-Toril.

THULTANTHAR

Thultanthar  (Shade  in  the  Loross  tongue)  escaped  into  the

Plane of Shadow, where its inhabitants battled the malaugrym

and other horrors of that shadowy world for generations before

returning to Faern in the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR). The

City of Shade, as it is now known, and its inhabitants are further

detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, Lords of

Darkness, and Players Guide to Faern.

Western Diaspora

The lifedrain spells of the phaerimms coupled with the literal fall

of High Netheril precipitated one of the greatest migrations of

humanity that has ever occurred in western Faern. From 461

DR to 333 DR, Netherese refugees moved west and southwest

into the lands now known as the Silver Marches, the Backlands,

and  Sunset  Vale.  Those  who  followed  the  northern  mountain

passes were welcomed by the shield dwarves of Citadel Sundbarr

(see Silver Marches) and the Fair Folk of Eaerlann. In time, the

elven city of Ascalhorn was given over to the Netherese refugees

on the condition that they help defend Eaerlann and foreswear

the use of their forebears most dangerous arcane practices.

Those few who had embraced Karsus as a savior were perse-

cuted for their beliefs. They made their way to his petried corpse

in the High Forest and built the city of Karse at its foot.

The survivors who migrated down the twin waterways now

known as the Winding Water and the River Reaching merged

with Calishites, Chondathans, and Talr to form edgling realms

such as the Duchy of Indoria, which was located in the region

now known as the Fields of the Dead. Some migrated to planned

subterranean cities such as Gauntlgrym (see page 143) and the

Netherese Caverns of Philock (see Underdark), while others used

the Art to craft new cities, such as Helbrester.

HELBRESTER (THE SUNSET TOWERS)

This fortied city of linked towers rose like a hand reaching for

the stars from a low-lying island just east of the site of Irphong.

Its famed towers were great cylinders built of green-hued local

island stone by a small group of refugees from Low Netheril. They

chose to settle in the Nelanther Isles because weakened Calishite

control over the region allowed them to establish an independent

realm fairly close to many population centers.

The city consisted of towers built so close together, and linked

on so many levels, that only seabirds and creeping beasts could

use the spaces between. Great domed crystal ceilings were raised

over many towers to allow light into the gardenlike interiors of

large halls, but the smaller rooms and passages existed in almost

perpetual gloom, illuminated by oating driftglobes.

The founders of Helbrester used magic to prolong their lives

and  became  known  as  elders.  Preferring  to  spend  their  time

in  arcane  studies,  they  favored  a  policy  of  isolation  from  the

world. Though the elders constructed a number of portals to the

mainland, they used them only to magically abduct beasts they

wanted to dine on or steal items they wanted to possess.

As  time  passed,  the  original  elders  died  or  withdrew  into

seclusion,  acquiring  an  age-crazed  reputation  among  their

descendants.  Meanwhile,  Helbresters  population  swelled  with

their offspring and the children of their unions with abducted

mainland folk. These new Helbrestans began to trade with other

realms and set up their city as a reprovisioning and repair port

for ships plying the Sword Coast. When pirates sought to seize

control of Helbrester, the elders blasted the intruders and their

ships with powerful spells, winning Helbrester a touch-it-not

reputation.

Mainlanders seeking freedom from various forms of oppres-

sion sailed to the Sunset Towers in hopes of settling there and

were usually accepted. The city slowly grew into a neutral-ground

port used by pirates and merchant shippers alike, though many

coastal Tethyrians considered it a pirate power waiting to erupt.

Helbrester was governed by the Lords and Ladiesthe heads

of twelve of its most senior families, including Arathtaea, Hal-

lowhand, Iyrimsar, and Kolthund.

Unbeknownst  to  the  Helbrestans,  two  elders  named  Thak-

loamur and Mingaudorr, who had retired from public life many

years before, were still lurking in hidden, spell-guarded rooms and

passages. Eventually, they attained two different and imperfect

forms of lichdom. Both forms of undeath required the liches to

subsume energy (life essence for Thakloamur, and spell power for

Mingaudorr) from time to time, or crumble away. So Thakloamur

became a kidnapper and murderer, and Mingaudorr a thief of

magic. The two managed to elude detection for some years by

preying almost exclusively on visiting outlanders, although dark

108

FALLEN NETHERIL

FALLEN NETHERIL

rumors began to circulate in the city. Then one fateful day, they

met and began to feud in earnest.

Towers came crashing down as one lich or the other sought to

destroy his rival. The bewildered Helbrestans raced through the

rubble with drawn swords seeking the source of the threat but

were powerless to stop the destruction. At last, when the entire

southern end of Helbrester collapsed, Mingaudorr was thrown

down and buried in the rubble.

Pirates promptly came plundering, and the few Helbrestans

who survived their raids  ed the city forever. The pirates who

sought to claim the remaining towers as strongholds were slain

by the stalking Thakloamur, and when a pirate  eet

gathered to hunt down this mysterious

slayer, the lichs spells blasted entire

ships to tumbling embers.

The  tremors  caused  by

this battle freed Mingaudorr,

who  worked  a  titanic

spell  that  destroyed

not  only  his  foe,

but  also  the  very

island  upon  which

Helbrester  stood,

plus  all  that  was

left  of  the  city  and

Mingaudorr  himself.

The riven island was

hurled into the skies,

and  Helbrester  was

no more.

Some  believe  that

Thakloamur,  Mingaudorr,

or both survived that  nal

battle  in  some  way.  Their

opinions  are  supported  by

the fact that from time to

time,  along  the  coasts  of

Amn and Tethyr, mysteri-

ous  portals  open  without

warning to take beings and

objects to some unknown otherwhere. On the other hand, these

spells could be the work of Helbrestan descendants, or even folk

who gained such spells from other refugees of old Netheril.

Today, nothing but jagged shoal rocks and tumbled stones lie

off Irphong where the proud towers of Helbrester once rose. The

treasures of Netheril that once bedecked these proud halls were

looted long ago and now lie in pirate caches and noble vaults

throughout Tethyr, Amn, and the Nelanther.

KARSE

In the years immediately following Karsuss Folly, a cult arose in

Karsuss honor. Its members believed that the very act that had

caused the empires collapse had also transformed Karsus into a

being both human and divine, and that his divinity still persisted.

They predicted that Karsus would be reborn to lead humankind

into a new age of magic that would be built on the ashes of the

old but tempered with experience.

Though the Cult of Karsus attracted a good number of ad-

herents, its enemies outnumbered them considerably. Eventually,

religious persecution drove the cultists to build a holy city in the

depths of the High Forest. They founded the city of Karse at the

base of a tall butte of red stone, which they believed to be the

remnants of the Momentary Gods physical form.

Long before casting his fateful spell, Karsus had experimented

with a discovery he called heavy magic and,

in the process, inadvertently turned an-

other arcanist named Wulgreth into

a lich. Wulgreth of Netheril never

forgave  Karsus,  and  after  his  rivals

death, he exacted his somewhat petty re-

venge by secretly fomenting divisions

within the Cult of Karse. Because

of  his  machinations,  the  city

of  Karse  was  torn  apart  by

religious strife a little more

than  a  decade  after  its

founding,  and  the  cult

disintegrated.  Wul-

greth  of  Netheril

then  moved  into

the  citys  ruins

to ensure that no one

would ever rebuild it.

In time, he became a

demilichEL.

More than a thousand

years  later,  an  Ascalhi

wizard,  by  chance  named

Wulgreth  as  well,  traf cked

with devils in de ance of the

ancient  pact  his  forebears

had made with the Eaerlanni

elves to abandon the dark arts

of the Netherese. Thanks to

the devils who did his bidding,

Wulgreth of Ascalhorn bested

his rivals for six decades, and

they eventually began to traf c with demons in their own defense.

The  demons  they  summoned  did  their  jobs  far  too  wellnot

only did they destroy the devils, but they also conquered all of

Ascalhorn, then overran Eaerlann and Ammarindar, destroying

both kingdoms.

Wulgreth  of  Ascalhorn   ed  the  destruction,  accompanied

only by Jingleshod the Iron Axeman, his man-at-arms. When

Jingleshod realized that Wulgreth intended to exact his revenge

against the demons by raising an army of undead from the ruins

of Karse, the Iron Axeman  nally found the courage to slay his

master.  Unfortunately,  he  did  so  while  Wulgreth  was  casting

his epic spell. The arcane energies that the archwizard had been

molding at the moment of his death were released, transforming

him into a lich and the region surrounding the ruins of Karse

into the Dire Wood.

Today, Wulgreth of Netheril is  nally deaddestroyed by

the magic of Galaeron Nihmedu, an elf shadow adept. But Wul-

greth of Ascalhorn (LE male human lich wizard 20/archmage

Dire Wood and its attendant wizard weather cannot be destroyed,

and Jingleshod (NG male iron half-golem/half-human  ghter 10)

cannot die until Wulgreth is slain. The ruined city of Karse is

likely to remain a festering sore in the heart of the High Forest

for generations to come.

Legacies of Netheril

The Empire of Magic left behind a legacy of awesome magic and

hidden secrets. Its people migrated to many other lands, and their

descendants still thrive throughout Faern. The buried ruins of

Netherils fallen cities, arcanist laboratories, and long-forgotten

outposts provide ample opportunities for adventurers to test their

mettle,  and  forgotten  monsters  and  portals  to  perilous  planes

threaten Faern with destruction every day.

This section offers a selection of adventure hooks involving

Netheril, nations and peoples that claim Netherese heritage, and

horrible arcane secrets.

Adventure Seeds

Virtually any adventure involving epic magic from the ancient

past  can  use  Netheril  as  a  backdrop.  The  sheer  power  of  the

Netherese arcanists and their general lack of concern for the

consequences of their magic ensure that plenty of world-threaten-

ing artifacts exist for enterprising adventurers to recover, destroy,

or keep from the hands of villains.

RED TIGER TOTEM

Ranjar Redclaw (CN male human barbarian 5), a warrior of the

Red Tiger tribe, has received a series of visions while attempting

to commune with his tribes totem spirit at Beorunnas Well. He

now believes that a living incarnation of the Red Tiger totem

is trapped in the depths of the well, but he has been unable to

convince the tribes shaman, Aedelthrang the Black (CE male

human cleric 9 of Uthgar), of the veracity of his vision. Barred

from recruiting other members of his tribe for this foolhardy

chase  and  disdaining  the  help  of  the  Black  Lions,  who  have

strayed far from traditional ways, Ranjar is now seeking a band

of brave adventurers to help him liberate the trapped spirit.

The truth of the matter is rather more sordid. After spend-

ing centuries locked in temporal stasis, the mind  ayer Xssa

of Ellyntaal has managed to extend his consciousness enough

to project an image of his companion, the rakshasa known as

Ickshar,  to  the  misguided  Ranjar.  But  while  the  tiger-headed

Ickshar might resemble the Red Tiger beast totem, he is more

apt to serve Malar than Uthgar. If freed, Ickshar and Xssa

might well ally with the Red Tigers, or even seize control of the

tribe and forge it into a potent threat in the northern reaches

of  the  Silver  Marches.  An  adventurer  who  manages  to  com-

municate with the beys ghost (CG male human ghost  ghter

10/wizard 5/eldritch knight 5) might learn enough to avoid the

mind  ayers gambit and leave the mind  ayer and the rakshasa

trapped within their eternal stasis.

WAXING OF THE MOON

Kyriani Agrivar (N female half-drow wizard 12) owns a tavern

called Selnes Smile in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. She inherited

her business from an avatar of the Moonmaiden who lived in

Waterdeep up until the Time of Troubles. During her days as

an adventurer, Kyriani and her companions (most of whom are

now busy with the reclamation of Tethyr) acquired an artifact

known as the Eye of Selne that can open and close temporary

portals of arbitrary diameter to other planes. Not realizing what

they had found, they placed the artifact upon a high shelf and

largely forgot about it.

After  receiving  a  vision  from  Selne,  Kyriani  approaches

a band of adventurers allied with (or at least friendly to) the

Church of Selne and asks them to take up a quest in the name

of the Moonmaiden. If they agree, she tells them to take the

artifact to Elahzad, the House of the Moon and perform

the Ritual of the Waxing from the center of the alabaster palace

there. Kyriani knows nothing about such a place or ritual, but

a bit of research reveals that Elahzad lies in the Hills of Scent

in the heart of the Sword of Anauroch, near the City of Shade.

Further delving reveals that the Ritual of the Waxing can be

performed by any follower of Selne on the night following the

new moon.

Unbeknownst to Kyriani or the adventurers, this task is but

the latest move in the endless chess match between Selne and her

archrival Shar. If the adventurers reach Elahzad despite attacks

by agents of the Shadovar and clerics of the Dark Lady and then

correctly perform the required ritual, a temporary portal to the

Gates of the Moon opens in the sky above the temple. Then, to

the amazement or horror of all who watch, the ancient Netherese

 oating city of Selnnara returns to Faern to wage war against

the Shadovar of Thultanthar.

Buried Secrets

All civilizations leave behind secrets and mysteries when they pass

into the mists of history, and Netheril was no exception.

NETHERESE ARTIFACTS

The lesser arcanists of Low Netheril crafted both quasi-magic

items powered by nearby mythallars and true magic items that

they could employ beyond their demesnes. The latter items, which

were generally not rechargeable, often took the form of crowns

(known as archyres), gems (chardalynsLD and gems magicked with

the aid of the Attune Gem feat; see Magic of Faern), scepters

(charged devices of middling power compared to wands or staffs;

see the Craft Scepter feat, page 8), and shatter-rings (treat as an

alternate form of wand).

Very few Netherese runes, sigils, and symbols have survived to

the present day because almost all involved movement (animated

signs) or metamorphosis (one sign turns into another while operat-

ing). Modern-day Faernians examining such devices usually  nd

only a lifeless frozen image from either end of the operation.

NETHERESE MANTLES

Netherese arcanists favored a type of magic item almost unknown

today. Introduced to the Netherese by the Fair Folk of Eaerlann

Mingaudorr claims another victim

off Irphong where the proud towers of Helbrester once rose. The

treasures of Netheril that once bedecked these proud halls were

looted long ago and now lie in pirate caches and noble vaults

throughout Tethyr, Amn, and the Nelanther.

KARSE

In the years immediately following Karsuss Folly, a cult arose in

Karsuss honor. Its members believed that the very act that had

caused the empires collapse had also transformed Karsus into a

being both human and divine, and that his divinity still persisted.

They predicted that Karsus would be reborn to lead humankind

into a new age of magic that would be built on the ashes of the

old but tempered with experience.

Though the Cult of Karsus attracted a good number of ad-

herents, its enemies outnumbered them considerably. Eventually,

religious persecution drove the cultists to build a holy city in the

depths of the High Forest. They founded the city of Karse at the

base of a tall butte of red stone, which they believed to be the

remnants of the Momentary Gods physical form.

Long before casting his fateful spell, Karsus had experimented

with a discovery he called heavy magic and,

in the process, inadvertently turned an-

other arcanist named Wulgreth into

a lich. Wulgreth of Netheril never

forgave  Karsus,  and  after  his  rivals

death, he exacted his somewhat petty re-

venge by secretly fomenting divisions

within the Cult of Karse. Because

of  his  machinations,  the  city

of  Karse  was  torn  apart  by

religious strife a little more

than  a  decade  after  its

founding,  and  the  cult

disintegrated.  Wul-

greth  of  Netheril

then  moved  into

the  citys  ruins

to ensure that no one

would ever rebuild it.

In time, he became a

demilichEL.

More than a thousand

years  later,  an  Ascalhi

wizard,  by  chance  named

Wulgreth  as  well,  traf cked

with devils in de ance of the

ancient  pact  his  forebears

had made with the Eaerlanni

elves to abandon the dark arts

of the Netherese. Thanks to

the devils who did his bidding,

Wulgreth of Ascalhorn bested

his rivals for six decades, and

they eventually began to traf c with demons in their own defense.

The  demons  they  summoned  did  their  jobs  far  too  wellnot

only did they destroy the devils, but they also conquered all of

Ascalhorn, then overran Eaerlann and Ammarindar, destroying

both kingdoms.

Wulgreth  of  Ascalhorn   ed  the  destruction,  accompanied

only by Jingleshod the Iron Axeman, his man-at-arms. When

Jingleshod realized that Wulgreth intended to exact his revenge

against the demons by raising an army of undead from the ruins

of Karse, the Iron Axeman  nally found the courage to slay his

master.  Unfortunately,  he  did  so  while  Wulgreth  was  casting

his epic spell. The arcane energies that the archwizard had been

molding at the moment of his death were released, transforming

him into a lich and the region surrounding the ruins of Karse

into the Dire Wood.

Today, Wulgreth of Netheril is  nally deaddestroyed by

the magic of Galaeron Nihmedu, an elf shadow adept. But Wul-

Dire Wood and its attendant wizard weather cannot be destroyed,

and Jingleshod (NG male iron half-golem/half-human  ghter 10)

cannot die until Wulgreth is slain. The ruined city of Karse is

likely to remain a festering sore in the heart of the High Forest

for generations to come.

Legacies of Netheril

The Empire of Magic left behind a legacy of awesome magic and

hidden secrets. Its people migrated to many other lands, and their

descendants still thrive throughout Faern. The buried ruins of

Netherils fallen cities, arcanist laboratories, and long-forgotten

outposts provide ample opportunities for adventurers to test their

mettle,  and  forgotten  monsters  and  portals  to  perilous  planes

threaten Faern with destruction every day.

This section offers a selection of adventure hooks involving

Netheril, nations and peoples that claim Netherese heritage, and

horrible arcane secrets.

Adventure Seeds

Virtually any adventure involving epic magic from the ancient

past  can  use  Netheril  as  a  backdrop.  The  sheer  power  of  the

Netherese arcanists and their general lack of concern for the

consequences of their magic ensure that plenty of world-threaten-

ing artifacts exist for enterprising adventurers to recover, destroy,

or keep from the hands of villains.

RED TIGER TOTEM

Ranjar Redclaw (CN male human barbarian 5), a warrior of the

Red Tiger tribe, has received a series of visions while attempting

to commune with his tribes totem spirit at Beorunnas Well. He

now believes that a living incarnation of the Red Tiger totem

is trapped in the depths of the well, but he has been unable to

convince the tribes shaman, Aedelthrang the Black (CE male

human cleric 9 of Uthgar), of the veracity of his vision. Barred

from recruiting other members of his tribe for this foolhardy

chase  and  disdaining  the  help  of  the  Black  Lions,  who  have

strayed far from traditional ways, Ranjar is now seeking a band

of brave adventurers to help him liberate the trapped spirit.

The truth of the matter is rather more sordid. After spend-

ing centuries locked in temporal stasis, the mind  ayer Xssa

of Ellyntaal has managed to extend his consciousness enough

to project an image of his companion, the rakshasa known as

Ickshar,  to  the  misguided  Ranjar.  But  while  the  tiger-headed

Ickshar might resemble the Red Tiger beast totem, he is more

apt to serve Malar than Uthgar. If freed, Ickshar and Xssa

might well ally with the Red Tigers, or even seize control of the

tribe and forge it into a potent threat in the northern reaches

of  the  Silver  Marches.  An  adventurer  who  manages  to  com-

municate with the beys ghost (CG male human ghost  ghter

10/wizard 5/eldritch knight 5) might learn enough to avoid the

mind  ayers gambit and leave the mind  ayer and the rakshasa

trapped within their eternal stasis.

WAXING OF THE MOON

Kyriani Agrivar (N female half-drow wizard 12) owns a tavern

called Selnes Smile in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. She inherited

her business from an avatar of the Moonmaiden who lived in

Waterdeep up until the Time of Troubles. During her days as

an adventurer, Kyriani and her companions (most of whom are

now busy with the reclamation of Tethyr) acquired an artifact

known as the Eye of Selne that can open and close temporary

portals of arbitrary diameter to other planes. Not realizing what

they had found, they placed the artifact upon a high shelf and

largely forgot about it.

After  receiving  a  vision  from  Selne,  Kyriani  approaches

a band of adventurers allied with (or at least friendly to) the

Church of Selne and asks them to take up a quest in the name

of the Moonmaiden. If they agree, she tells them to take the

artifact to Elahzad, the House of the Moon and perform

the Ritual of the Waxing from the center of the alabaster palace

there. Kyriani knows nothing about such a place or ritual, but

a bit of research reveals that Elahzad lies in the Hills of Scent

in the heart of the Sword of Anauroch, near the City of Shade.

Further delving reveals that the Ritual of the Waxing can be

performed by any follower of Selne on the night following the

new moon.

Unbeknownst to Kyriani or the adventurers, this task is but

the latest move in the endless chess match between Selne and her

archrival Shar. If the adventurers reach Elahzad despite attacks

by agents of the Shadovar and clerics of the Dark Lady and then

correctly perform the required ritual, a temporary portal to the

Gates of the Moon opens in the sky above the temple. Then, to

the amazement or horror of all who watch, the ancient Netherese

 oating city of Selnnara returns to Faern to wage war against

the Shadovar of Thultanthar.

Buried Secrets

All civilizations leave behind secrets and mysteries when they pass

into the mists of history, and Netheril was no exception.

NETHERESE ARTIFACTS

The lesser arcanists of Low Netheril crafted both quasi-magic

items powered by nearby mythallars and true magic items that

they could employ beyond their demesnes. The latter items, which

were generally not rechargeable, often took the form of crowns

(known as archyres), gems (chardalynsLD and gems magicked with

the aid of the Attune Gem feat; see Magic of Faern), scepters

(charged devices of middling power compared to wands or staffs;

see the Craft Scepter feat, page 8), and shatter-rings (treat as an

alternate form of wand).

Very few Netherese runes, sigils, and symbols have survived to

the present day because almost all involved movement (animated

signs) or metamorphosis (one sign turns into another while operat-

ing). Modern-day Faernians examining such devices usually  nd

only a lifeless frozen image from either end of the operation.

NETHERESE MANTLES

Netherese arcanists favored a type of magic item almost unknown

today. Introduced to the Netherese by the Fair Folk of Eaerlann

Mingaudorr claims another victim

110

111

FALLEN NETHERIL

and Cormanthyr, Netherese mantles were personal magical shields

constructed through repeated applications of the Craft Contingent

Spell feat (see Unapproachable East). A typical Netherese mantle

included spells such as endure elements, feather fall, greater mage

hand, lesser globe of invulnerability, lesser ironguardMag, mage

hand,  protection  from  arrows,  protection  from  energy,  and/or

unseen servant. Some more powerful mantles include spells such as

globe of invulnerability, greater ironguardMag, and spell turning.

While  such  mantles  can  still  be  crafted  today,  no  one  has

duplicated the ability of the archwizards to create a wardrobe of

differing mantles. For example, a particular Netherese archwizard

might wear a battle mantle, an everyday mantle, an exploration

mantle, and so on, exchanging them as needed.

Unlike  most  magic  items,  a  mantle  cannot  be  found  in  a

monsters treasure hoard or in the depths of a ruin. Only a few

masters of the Art have revived the ancient practice of mantle

construction. However, an unusually large number of Netherese

survived the fall of Netheril by embracing lichdom or shadow,

lingering on as ghosts, or casting life-sustaining magic. Thus,

adventurers could encounter a foe sporting a spell mantle and

be ill prepared for his magical versatility.

Heirs to the Empire

Although most of High Netherils citizens died when their oat-

ing cities crashed, many of Low Netherils people survived and

went on to found new realms outside the reach of the lifedrain

spells of the phaerimms. When those realms also failed, the heirs

of Netheril scattered farther. Some settled new lands of their own,

and others melded with existing human settlements.

that their knowledge of Netheril should be kept secret until they

rule supreme over a new Netherese Empire.

FLIGHT OF RAUMARK

The inhabitants of Halruaa (see Shining South) and Nimbral

are direct descendants of the Netherese, though they also have

a trace of Lapalian ancestry. After the Fall of Netheril, some

Netherese sought to rebuild, so they founded Anauria, Asram, and

Hlondath. Others desired a new home far from the depredations

of  the  phaerimms  and  Karsuss  Folly.  To  that  end,  Raumark,

the Archwizard of Hlondath, led a great migration of skyships

to the Halruaan basin in the southern reaches of Faern, where

he and his people founded a new nation. Several centuries later,

a group of dissatised Halruaans broke away and founded the

island realm of Nimbral. Although both realms have preserved

many of Netherils traditions and arcane practices, each has also

evolved its own unique traditions.

NETHERESE PUREBLOODS

Aside from the inhabitants of Thultanthar, three small groups

of pureblooded Netherese still exist. The Marsh Drovers of the

Farsea Marshes are thought to be Anaurians who were never

absorbed by the Chondathan inhabitants of Cormyr. The Tunlar

barbarians of the Plains of Tun are believed to be descendants

of the Angardt barbarians of southwestern Netheril who have

chosen to retain their ancient traditions of sorcery. Finally, the

nomadic barbarians of the Ride, just north of the Moonsea, are

believed to be descendants of the Rengarth barbarians of northern

Netheril (also cousins of the Low Netherese) who retain their

hostility to magic.

EMPIRE OF SHADOWS

With the exception of the enclave called Selnarra, which was

saved by the grace of Selne, Thultanthar (the City of Shade) is

the only known Netherese enclave anywhere in the Faernian

cosmology. Although its citizens have been warped and altered

by their long exile on the Plane of Shadow, and their shadow

magic seems strange and alien, they are still the closest link to

Netheril on Faern. Unfortunately for scholars everywhere, the

Shadovar are notoriously secretive and arrogant. They believe

UTHGARDT BARBARIANS

These proud, erce barbarians of the North are descended from

Illuskan seafarers driven inland and Netherese survivors from

Runlatha. No evidence exists that all the Uthgardt barbarians

were related to the Netherese, but a few links remaina tendency

toward black hair in some families, or a few ceremonial words

that resemble Netherese phrases, and the like. Of all the Uthgardt

tribes, the Tree Ghost tribe has the most Netherese blood, while

the Red Tigers have the least.

Spell Mantles

Spell  mantles  are  created  by  using  the  Spell  Mantle  feat,

described below. A contingent spell is an effect that activates

upon the caster when certain conditions are met. The only dif-

ference between a contingent spell and a mantled spell is that

the user can also trigger the latter voluntarily as a standard

action, even if the triggering conditions are not met. In this

case, the mantled spell functions like a spell-like ability.

SPELL MANTLE

You can create a mantle from the contingent spells you carry.

Prerequisites: Craft Contingent SpellUna, Knowledge (arcana)

5 ranks, Knowledge (history) 2 ranks.

Benet: You can use a standard action to activate a particu-

lar contingent spell you carry as a spell-like ability, even if the

conditions specied for its activation have not been met.

Normal:  When  you  create  a  contingent  spell,  you  must

specify a condition or event that will trigger the effect, much

like the contingency spell.

the

Imperial South

The vast southwestern region of Faern is a diverse

land of geographical extremes. Sweeping plains and

towering  mountains  border  deep  forests  or  hug

the sea along lengthy coastlines. The area boasts sun-scorched

desert, vast savannahs, dark and tangled woodlands, and trackless,

monster-infested mountains. These exceedingly ancient lands were

rst settled by the elves of the long-lost Crown Wars kingdoms,

then later colonized by djinn and efreet, and nally settled by

humans.  This  chapter  focuses  on  the  human  kingdoms  that

arose thousands of years after older realms such as Keltormir

and Ilythiir had fallen.

The humans who inhabited these ancient realms were sinister,

grasping, and ambitious. Over the course of centuries, the armies

of Coramshan, the Shoon Empire, and Jhaamdath massacred

nearly all the genies and elves of the south and drove out most

of the shield dwarves and halings. The forces of Coramshan

and Mir (forebears of modern Calimshan) destroyed the genies

of the Calim Caliphates and Memnonnar. Calimshan in turn

overran High Shanatar, driving the Stout Folk back into the

Underdark. The rulers of the Shoon Imperium massacred the

elves of the southern forests during expansions to the north, east,

and south. Only the Fair Folk of the Wealdath and Shilmista

survived their reign. In their rush to build a mighty armada that

could dominate the Sea of Fallen Stars, the leaders of Jhaamdath

struggled mightily to wrest control of the Chondalwood from

the elves, but in the end, the high mages of Nikerymath had the

last word.

History

From of the mists of ages long forgotten, human, dwarven, and

elven kingdoms arose throughout the south of Faern. As in so

many other regions, humans became dominant and gradually

supplanted the older races. The history of these human civiliza-

tions is fraught with murderous dynasties, powerful elemental

forces, elven high magic, and genocidal warfare.

11,000  Taark Shanat the Crusader and his eight sons lead a

great  exodus  of  dwarves  from  Bhaerynden  to  a  new

kingdom in the west. These emigrants become known as

shield dwarves and establish the underground realm of

Shanatar beneath present-day Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan,

and the Lake of Steam.

10,800  The followers of Shanat are attacked by the mysterious

inhabitants of Rringlor Noroth. The Stout Folk prevail

after Taark slays the four blue dragons that claimed the

Rift of Dhalnadar. The Wyrmskull Throne is formed.

Taark Shanat renames the wyrms lair Brightaxe Hall

and founds the kingdom of Alatorin.

10,500  The eight sons of Shanat set off to found their own

kingdoms nearby. Because each son claims a different

child of Moradin as a patron deity, each subkingdom

becomes closely linked with the church of a particular

god or goddess.

9600  The drow city of Guallidurth is founded. The rst drow

civilizations rise in the Underdark.

9000  The subkingdoms of Shanatar battle each other in a

bid to extend their borders. This series of conicts is

known as the Spawn Wars because the dwarves make

extensive use of deepspawn legions.

8800  After a severe drought, an attack by a ight of red

the king of Ultoksamrin.

8100  The mind ayers of Oryndoll attack the eastern kingdoms

of Shanatar, beginning the Mindstalker Wars.

8080  Shanatar beats back the mind ayers and discovers that

The  ongoing  struggles  of  the  two  noble  genies  create

the Calim Desert.

6095  The  Shanataran  dwarves  ally  with  Calishite  humans

against the remaining genies.

lord)  establishes  a  portal  between  his  holdings  on  the

Elemental Plane of Earth and a cavern complex beneath

what is now the occupied town of Kzelter.

7700  Rogue marids from the Calim Empire enter Selmalyr

(undersea  Vilhon  Reach),  sparking  war  with  the  sea

elves. The marids and their jann spread into Sers, where

they ally with the other aquatic races. Because these new

Marid States are located in deep water beneath the Hmur

Plateau, their residents face no direct elven retribution

for their expansionist activities.

7690  Calim negotiates the borders of his empire with the elves

and dwarves and nally claims the lands south of the

River Agis.

Coramshan.

5360  The dwarves of High Shanatar battle the giants of Nede-

heim in a conict called the Giant Wars. During this

sixty-year period, more than half of the giant population

south of the Cloud Peaks is exterminated, and the realm

of Nedeheim is reduced to scattered clanholds.

5330  The Murabir (warlord-ruler) of Coramshan seizes much

of  southern  High  Shanatar  (including  Iltakar,  home

to  the  modern-day  ruins  of  Shoonach),  while  dwarf

armies  battle  giants  to  the  north.  Lirremar  (present-

ending the Third Spider War.

6100  The Era of Skyre ends when the high magic of the

their elemental essences to the sky and earth, respectively.

Jhaamdaths Seventh and Eighth Cities of the Sword.

5100  Mir cements control of all lands south of the River Ith

and begins founding fortress-cities on the northern shore

soon rages between the two armies of the Stout Folk.

Keepers of the Past

Numerous  libraries,  colleges,  and  monasteries  throughout  the

south preserve the ancient history of these exotic lands. Most

of  these  institutions  are  located  in  Calimshans  coastal  cities

and in remote mountainous regions. A few are administered by

enigmatic loremasters who pursue agendas that go beyond simply

recording the past.

EARTHVAULT

When Shanatar was yet young under the mountains, its mages

asked Diuthaizos, a learned dao from the Elemental Plane of

Earth, to be their great lorekeeper. The dao acquiesced and has

been  the  forgotten  custodian  of  Shanatars  history  for  nearly

thirteen thousand years now.

The story of all Shanatar, High and Deep, is carved in Terran

on the walls of the Earthvault, a vast cylindrical cavern under the

Marching Mountains. The text is a continuous spiral that begins

at the vaults lowest point and has been slowly winding upward

as the history of the dwarves unfolds. Diuthaizos has only lately

recorded the history of Iltkazar and the recent battles between

the duergar and the gold dwarves.

Only dwarves are permitted to enter the Earthvault, although

Diuthaizos  accepts  generous  bribes  to  admit  nondwarves.  The

dao is quite content with his tasks, since the work is easy and his

enslaved duergar have built him an impressive hall. These slaves

have also enriched their genie master with gems and gold pilfered

from various Underdark ruins.

THE FIRESTORM CABAL

The air and  re genasi of this secret order claim ancestral ties to

the age-old elemental dynasties founded by Calim and Memnon. In

a hidden keep on Calimshans southwestern coast, the Firestorm

Cabal  maintains  meticulous  records  of  Calishite  and  Tethyr-

ian families with elemental bloodlines. Taken all together, the

thousands of scrolls in their library form a detailed history of

the genie-founded land, with descriptions of the dynasties, their

laws, and the major events of Calimshan and Tethyr throughout

the past nine thousand years.

At present, the Firestorm Cabal has fewer than two dozen

members, but it accepts genasi from either Calimshan or Tethyr

as initiates. Recently, the members have been hotly debating the

prospect of freeing their imprisoned grandsires. Some dream of

great rewards from the noble genies, while others fear a backlash

against geniekind not seen since the days of Coramshan.

The  cabal  is  ruled  by  a  Council  of  Five  whose  foremost

members  are  Arhapan  (LN  male  air  genasi   ghter  9)  and

Suilizon (LE female  re genasi wizard 10). Despite differences

of opinion within the group, their belief in the superiority of

all genasi ensures continued cooperation among the members.

This genasi  rst policy has led to the recent admittance of

the cabals  rst water genasi, Ahamuor (NE female water genasi

cleric 6 of Istishia), who can trace her bloodline to the noble

marid Ajhuu.

MONASTERY OF ST. FANAL

Founded nearly fourteen centuries ago by a priest of Ilmater,

the Monastery of St. Fanal is dedicated to the principle that

knowledge of the past can alleviate the sufferings of the present.

This center for scholarly learning, art, and historical knowledge

is located in the hills just west of the Alimir Mountains, on

the  Pevadaas  Trail.  Saint  Fanal  made  it  his  cause  to  learn,

teach,  and  preserve  history  for  all.  The  priest  believed  that

making knowledge available to the oppressed could expand their

capabilities  and  thus  give  them  opportunities  not  normally

open to them.

The monastery trains scribes to be objective in both observa-

tion and investigation. Its library holds a number of historical

tomes penned since 132 DR that detail the human kingdoms

surrounding the Lake of Steamnamely the Border Kingdoms,

the Shaar, and Calimshanfrom the Age of Shoon onward.

Brother Bedon (LG male human cleric 7 of Ilmater/monk

3), the head of the monastery, has established a policy that no

one seeking knowledge can be denied. He sees his work as a tool

to end regional strife and makes a concerted effort to assist all

visitors committed to good and peace.

Songs and Stories

Ten thousand years of human civilization have led to the creation

of a number of immortal legends and tales in the south. From the

royal courtyards of Calimport to the street stages of Tethyr, actors,

bards, and minstrels sing and act out the legends from which the

areas heritage is woven. Most of these stories serve to entertain;

others contain clues to ancient mysteries still unsolved.

THE CALEPH AUGURIES

Ulsahab,  the  fabled  city  of  seers,  is  located  on  Mount  Abba-

layat, an isolated peak along the western ridge of the Marching

Mountains. This sprawling collection of squat, unadorned stone

buildings and mazelike streets is ringed with high walls that ward

off mountain snows and deadly downdrafts. Travel to Ulsahab

requires careful navigation through areas of treacherous mountain

passes, icy badlands, and wind-blasted cliffs.

The city is home to the Abbalayar, the famed arcane prophets

of Calimshan. Some insist that the seers are neither human nor

genasi, but a new race of humankind. Whatever their nature,

devout prophets of the Abbalayar claim to have received visions

on the walls of the Earthvault, a vast cylindrical cavern under the

Marching Mountains. The text is a continuous spiral that begins

at the vaults lowest point and has been slowly winding upward

as the history of the dwarves unfolds. Diuthaizos has only lately

recorded the history of Iltkazar and the recent battles between

the duergar and the gold dwarves.

Only dwarves are permitted to enter the Earthvault, although

Diuthaizos  accepts  generous  bribes  to  admit  nondwarves.  The

dao is quite content with his tasks, since the work is easy and his

enslaved duergar have built him an impressive hall. These slaves

have also enriched their genie master with gems and gold pilfered

from various Underdark ruins.

THE FIRESTORM CABAL

The air and  re genasi of this secret order claim ancestral ties to

the age-old elemental dynasties founded by Calim and Memnon. In

a hidden keep on Calimshans southwestern coast, the Firestorm

Cabal  maintains  meticulous  records  of  Calishite  and  Tethyr-

ian families with elemental bloodlines. Taken all together, the

thousands of scrolls in their library form a detailed history of

the genie-founded land, with descriptions of the dynasties, their

laws, and the major events of Calimshan and Tethyr throughout

the past nine thousand years.

At present, the Firestorm Cabal has fewer than two dozen

members, but it accepts genasi from either Calimshan or Tethyr

as initiates. Recently, the members have been hotly debating the

prospect of freeing their imprisoned grandsires. Some dream of

great rewards from the noble genies, while others fear a backlash

against geniekind not seen since the days of Coramshan.

The  cabal  is  ruled  by  a  Council  of  Five  whose  foremost

members  are  Arhapan  (LN  male  air  genasi   ghter  9)  and

Suilizon (LE female  re genasi wizard 10). Despite differences

of opinion within the group, their belief in the superiority of

all genasi ensures continued cooperation among the members.

This genasi  rst policy has led to the recent admittance of

the cabals  rst water genasi, Ahamuor (NE female water genasi

cleric 6 of Istishia), who can trace her bloodline to the noble

marid Ajhuu.

MONASTERY OF ST. FANAL

Founded nearly fourteen centuries ago by a priest of Ilmater,

the Monastery of St. Fanal is dedicated to the principle that

knowledge of the past can alleviate the sufferings of the present.

This center for scholarly learning, art, and historical knowledge

is located in the hills just west of the Alimir Mountains, on

the  Pevadaas  Trail.  Saint  Fanal  made  it  his  cause  to  learn,

teach,  and  preserve  history  for  all.  The  priest  believed  that

making knowledge available to the oppressed could expand their

capabilities  and  thus  give  them  opportunities  not  normally

open to them.

The monastery trains scribes to be objective in both observa-

tion and investigation. Its library holds a number of historical

tomes penned since 132 DR that detail the human kingdoms

surrounding the Lake of Steamnamely the Border Kingdoms,

the Shaar, and Calimshanfrom the Age of Shoon onward.

Brother Bedon (LG male human cleric 7 of Ilmater/monk

3), the head of the monastery, has established a policy that no

one seeking knowledge can be denied. He sees his work as a tool

to end regional strife and makes a concerted effort to assist all

visitors committed to good and peace.

Songs and Stories

Ten thousand years of human civilization have led to the creation

of a number of immortal legends and tales in the south. From the

royal courtyards of Calimport to the street stages of Tethyr, actors,

bards, and minstrels sing and act out the legends from which the

areas heritage is woven. Most of these stories serve to entertain;

others contain clues to ancient mysteries still unsolved.

THE CALEPH AUGURIES

Ulsahab,  the  fabled  city  of  seers,  is  located  on  Mount  Abba-

layat, an isolated peak along the western ridge of the Marching

Mountains. This sprawling collection of squat, unadorned stone

buildings and mazelike streets is ringed with high walls that ward

off mountain snows and deadly downdrafts. Travel to Ulsahab

requires careful navigation through areas of treacherous mountain

passes, icy badlands, and wind-blasted cliffs.

The city is home to the Abbalayar, the famed arcane prophets

of Calimshan. Some insist that the seers are neither human nor

genasi, but a new race of humankind. Whatever their nature,

devout prophets of the Abbalayar claim to have received visions

THE FOUNDING STORIES

The children of Calimshan learn much of their nations history

from  the  Founding  Stories,  a  collection  of  hundreds  of  local

fables,  myths,  and  legends.  The  stories  center  around  the

misadventures of Calishite men and women who were

forced to deal with deceptive genies, foreign

traders,  and  monstrous  creatures.  The

people of Calimshan take great pride in

the Founding Stories, and many believe

that at least a kernel of truth anchors

each fable.

More  than  a  century  ago,  the

great  Calimshan  ruler  Kamaryn

Saban el Djenispool ordered a tome

of the Founding Stories printed

for each household in Calimshan.

Hundreds  of  these  illustrated,

leather-bound books can still be

found in Calimshans cities and

towns.

Important

Sites

The mysterious ruins of the South

beckon  to  many  adventurers,  but

the dif cult climate and dangerous

creatures  discourage  many  groups.

The forests and mountains are home

to hostile dragons, dwarves, elves, and

giants, all of which recall the cruelties that

Calimshan, Jhaamdath, and their successors

have  visited  on  their  neighbors  over  the

centuries. Tribes of giants, orcs, and goblinkin

dwell throughout the sparsely settled wilderness,

making travel through such areas especially dangerous.

Coramshan

The  human  kingdom  of  Coramshan  emerged  from  Calims

former empire following a bloody purge of ruling genies. Named

after the warrior-hero Coram, the new kingdom became the  rst

human-ruled realm in the south of Faern. Coramshan encom-

passed all the lands south of the River Agis and the Marching

Mountains, between the coasts of the Shining Sea and the Sea

of Swords. At that time, the Calim Desert was much smaller,

and most of Coramshan was a fertile plain. Today, little is known

of the ancient empire except for tales of old genie magic and

near-mythical dynasties.

CALIM SEE

The bakkals (priestly rulers) of Coramshan and the caliphs of

Calimshan were buried in Calims See, a cluster of great mauso-

leums built into the northern Marching Mountains. Dozens of

passages in this ancient burial ground lead to great underground

crypts that bear the names of famous Calishite dynasties. The

bakkals believed that a rich burial ensured a better position in

the afterlife, so nearly all the rulers buried here took copious

amounts of gold and gems with them into their graves.

All  the  mausoleums  are  heavily  warded

with  spelltraps  and  inhabited  by  genies

bound  to  protect  the  deceased  for  all

eternity. The people of both Coram-

shan  and  Calimshan  buried  their

dead  in  Calim  See  until  the  end

of  Calimshans  Seventh  Age,

when  battling  genies  caused  an

avalanche of rock that buried the

main entrance.

DARK CALIMPORT

Deep  beneath  Calimport  lies  a

dark city made up of innumer-

able  levels  of  wells,  sewers,

tombs, caverns, and cellars. Cen-

turies of war, dragon attacks, and

devastation have added layer upon

layer to this strange collection of

ruins. Known as Dark Calimport

(or Muzhahajaarnadah), this un-

dercity  traces  its  origins back to

Coramshan,  whose  crumbling

basements  and  sewers  form  the

undercitys foundation.

Thieves and assassins hide out in

the upper levels of Dark Calimport,

conducting  dark  bazaars  to  trade

foul magic, forbidden lore, and illicit

secrets. Kobolds, skulksFF, and feral

vermin  roam  the  middle  and  lower

levels, and rumor holds that a gate to Ithal

Pass lies somewhere within a middle level.

An assassin of Dark Calimport

In the deepest level of Dark Calimport stands a many-pillared

temple of dark blue stone that was once dedicated to Tyche but

has been corrupted to the service of Shar. The Temple of Old

Night, as it is now called, is Shars greatest stronghold, and her

clerics claim absolute dominion over the lowest third of Dark

Calimport. Irtemara el Eradsari (NE female human cleric 9 of

Shar/nightcloakFP 8) is high priestess of the temple.

DASHADJEN

This military fortress-city in the Calim Desert housed Calims

armies until Coramshan seized it after the Era of Sky re. Cen-

turies of con ict between the disembodied spirits of Calim and

Memnon have reduced the once-formidable fortress to sand and

fractured chunks of stone.

THE IMPERIAL SOUTH

THE IMPERIAL SOUTH

A single shrine, the Altar of Air, that stands in the middle

of the fortress has so far been spared the genies wrath. Built

by lesser djinn in the early years of Coramshan, it honors

the imprisoned genie lord Calim and contains an impressive

array  of  elemental  magic  and  treasure  for  him  to  reclaim

upon his release.

El Sadhara (LE female mummy cleric 14 of Akadi), an undead

priestess who has mistaken Calims presence for a manifestation

of her airy god, now guards the long-forgotten shrine.

THE NECROPOLISES OF NYKKAR

Throughout the long history of Coramshan and Calimshan, the

necroppar (clerics of the dead) prepared the dead for afterlife in

the sacred necropolises of Nykkar. The bakkals and nobles were

entombed  in  Calim  See,  while  commoners  were  buried  under

these necropolises.

First Necropolis: This collection of ruined buildings sits on a

wind-blasted plateau in the hills west of the Marching Mountains.

Crumbling walls and fallen roofs are all that remain of ancient

preparation  chambers,  laboratories,  temples,  and  libraries,  but

dozens of scattered stairwells still give access to the underground

tombs. Dirt and debris carried by the constant winds have scoured

the  ruins,  eroding  away  the  stone  signs  and  statues  that  once

graced its buildings.

A  strange  magic  residue  on  the  plateau  bestows  the  ben-

ets of the Empower Spell feat on spells from the school of

necromancy, though they do not require higher spell slots or

longer  casting  times.  Azzami  (LN  male  djinni  ghter  5),

the guardian of Nykkar, prevents the ogre tribes dwelling in

the mountains and valleys around the First Necropolis from

plundering the tombs.

Second  Necropolis:  Four  decaying  temples  dedicated  to  the

elements still stand in the City of Sorrow, which rests in the

hills just south of the central Marching Mountains. The Second

Necropolis served as both preparation place and burial ground for

hundreds of thousands of deceased Calishites from Calimshans

Second Age until the Age of Shoon. The crypts below the second

necropolis are more grand and opulent than those of the rst,

featuring immense mausoleums and family crypts guarded by

elaborate traps that combine spells with physical perils. Nizzem

(LN male djinni rogue 5), the twin of Azzami, guards the City

of Sorrow.

Third  Necropolis:  The  Isle  of  Memory,  which  lies  off  the

southern shore of Calimshan near the mouth of the River of Ice,

is the only one of the three necropolises that is currently active.

Its purpose is the same as that of the othersto prepare the rulers

and nobles of Calimshan for the afterlife and inter them.

Yazind (LN female human cleric 7 of Kelemvor) is the senior

necroppar on the Isle of Memory. In an edice called the Seven-

Skulled Tower, she maintains a library of the dead in which the

names of all those buried in Calim See and the three necropolises

are recorded. Yazind also records tomb desecrations, undead ris-

ings, and grave thefts in any of the necropolises. As an ardent

worshiper  of  Kelemvor,  Yazind  frequently  hires  trustworthy

adventurers to bring peace to restless spirits that she nds in

the older necropolises.

High Shanatar

At its height, the kingdom of High Shanatar stretched from the

River Agis and the Marching Mountains to the Troll Mountains,

and  from  the  western  coast  to  the  Alamir  Mountains.  The

kingdom included cities both atop and beneath the ruined cities

of Memnonnar, as well as isolated dwarfholds carved into the

mountains to the north.

During the 3,360 years that High Shanatar lasted, the Stout

Folk rarely knew peace. Wars against the First Kingdom of Mir

and the giants of Nedeheim greatly weakened the dwarf kingdom,

and centuries of persecution by the rulers of Calimshan drove it

into a long, inexorable decline. A few citizens of High Shanatar

eventually ed underground to Deep Shanatar or voyaged north

to found other realms, such as Oghrann, Ammarindar, Delzoun,

and Haunghdannar.

Most of High Shanatars surviving ruins share traits typical

of shield dwarf realmsgreat square chambers, vaulted ceilings,

and vast halls, some measuring as much as a mile long. Invariably,

such ruins are protected by deadly mechanical traps, golems, and

magical rooms that are actually constructs.

FORTRESS OF THE WAILING DWARF

Fortress Kuldelvon is the proper name of a memorial citadel

built nearly seven thousand years ago in the Troll Mountains to

honor the dwarf hero Karlyn Kuldelver. Carved into the western

mountainside  of  Mount  Batyr  is  an  image  of  a  tremendous

dwarf. Wind owing into its hollow ears and eyes rushes out

its mouth, producing an eerie cacophony of cries that echoes

throughout the valley below. Behind the graven dwarf lies an

entire dwarven city that was abandoned when the rest of High

Shanatar  fell.  The  exiled  hunched  giant  Managg  (CE  male

maurUnd giant barbarian 3) rules over half a dozen troll tribes

dwelling within Fortress Kuldelvon.

THE GREAT SPANS

The most visible ruins of High Shanatar are its rune-covered

bridges,  which  span  rivers  and  valleys  all  over  southwestern

Faern. These great stone bridges are adorned with ancient runes

that serve as maps to the fallen holds of High Shanatar.

In  the  Omlaranding  Mountains  is  a  great  span  infested

with displacer beasts and wyverns. Known as Borthuns Walk,

it leads to a forgotten keep built by Clan Diamondblade. Along

Eshpurta Road just east of the Amnite city of Keczulla stand

twin bridges built by the dwarves of the subkingdom Korolnor.

Clan Kuldelver Bridge (called the Axe Bridge by Amnites) spans

the Vudlur River. The Karlyn Bridge (called the Star Bridge by

the Amnites), which spans the Splendarrllur River, was part of a

dwarf-built road that led to the Fortress of the Wailing Dwarf.

NEMESSOR TUNNEL

Naturally formed passages lead from surface caves on Nemes-

sor Island to the ruins of an abandoned mining colony below.

The great hall and several side chambers are lled with piles of

broken stonethe remains of the structures that once housed

the colony. Scattered about the chambers is a variety of aged and

rusted mining equipment of dwarven make.

Beyond the ruined hall, a partially collapsed tunnel leads east

under the Sea of Swords, then branches out into a network of

subterranean highways that passes under Zazesspur, Shoonach,

and the Starspire Mountains. The tunnel and its side chambers

are  choked  with  deadly  plantsnotably  shriekers,  sporebatsFF,

udorootsXPH,  violet  fungi,  and  yellow  musk  creepersFF.  For

centuries, several tribes of xenophobic myconidsMM2 have rooted

here, cultivating the aggressive plants to defend their kingdom.

RRINNOROTH

This dwarven ghost town sits on a plateau on a southwestern

mountain in the Kuldin Peaks. Rrinnoroth was built as an outpost

to protect High Shanatar from the goblin raiders in the valleys

below. A major tunnel below the site leads down to the ruins of

Drakkalor, an abandoned city of Deep Shanatar now inhabited

by a confederation of skulks.

An ancient red dragon named Charvekannathor the Scarlet

has laired in Rrinnoroth for more than eight hundred years. Over

the centuries, he has stripped the cavernous dwarfhold of every

valuable and set up explosive traps and teleportation wards to

protect his lair and treasure hoard. Charvekannathor takes ight

several times a month to hunt prey in the nearby valleys.

SWORDSMERE

Inside Mount Sklagarra in the western part of the Troll Moun-

tains, an abandoned complex of dwarf-carved caverns surrounds

a subterranean lake full of carnivorous, sightless sh. On a lone

island  in  the  center  of  the  lake  sits  an  elegant  manor  called

Heralds Hall that serves as the secret headquarters of the Heralds,

a renegade group of Harpers. The manor contains innumerable

artifacts, spellbooks, and weapons that have made history in the

past few centuries.

The Heralds sealed off the passages leading from Swordsmere

to Deep Shanatar to ensure their privacy, leaving no external

entrances. Thus, the complex is accessible only by portals from

Athkatla,  Baldurs  Gate,  Beregost,  Eshpurta,  and  Murann.

Dozens of runic guardians and shield guardians patrol the tunnels

and caverns, and even the area under the lake. They recognize

only Herald members and have orders to contain and imprison

all others.

Memnonnar

More than nine thousand years ago, the noble efreeti Memnon

founded a kingdom on a narrow strip of land along the Sea of

Swords. Memnonnar, as it was named, was bounded by the Sul-

duskoon River in the north and the River Agis in the south. Its

cities were lled with towers, temples, and citadels of scarlet brick

topped by domes and minarets inlaid with brass, much like the

buildings in the fabled City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of

Fire. The streets teemed with human, genasi, and efreet citizens,

while slaves toiled underground, mining gems and precious metal

for their ery lords.

After Memnons imprisonment by elven magic, the surviving

efreet foresaw their doom and hid their genie lore and magic from

the humans. Shortly thereafter, the forces of Coramshan drove off

and slew Memnons genies and razed most of his cities. Dwarves

out of High Shanatar settled in the abandoned cities, only to be

expelled later by furious Calishites who would brook no dwarves

within their lands. During the ensuing centuries, the Calishites

resettled many of the ancient efreet cities and built new ones over

the ruins of the old. Thus, most of Memnonnars surviving ruins

represent a mix of dwarven, efreet, and human architecture.

MEMNONNAR

Memnon led his Army of Fire to Faern through the portal

known as the Great Brass Gate and founded the city of Memnon-

nar around it. Now, thousands of years later, half of Memnons

once-great efreet metropolis lies in ruins. The surviving half, now

the Calishite city of Memnon, lies just across the Agis River.

The  fact  that  the  brick  ruins  of  Memnonnar  are  hot  to

the touch is a smoldering reminder that an open portal to the

Elemental Plane of Fire that lies below them. Hidden under the

smoking rubble are luxurious palace rooms, lost chambers lled

with  arcane  treasures,  and  vaults  overowing  with  rubies  and

genie gold. Armed garrisons from Fort Agis make annual forays

to these ruins to hunt elementals and seek treasure.

The mine tunnels below the ruins, where the walls are so hot

that they glow, are home to re elementals, mephits, salamanders,

and various other heat-loving creatures.

Deep below the center of the original city lies the Great Brass

Gatea massive brass ring about 100 feet in diameter that hovers

vertically above the dungeon oor. The gate is a two-way portal

to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and the hellish conditions around

it have been created by portal seepage. The passages and caverns

nearest the gate are lled with smoky, unbreathable air, and any

creature within 50 feet of it takes 2d6 points of re damage

every round.

The Great Brass Gate has been guarded since the fall of the

city by a bodyguard of Memnon who was tasked to serve until

death. Ufbrann (LE male efreeti ghter 4) allows only creatures

with ery bloodlines (such as re genasi or characters with the

Bloodline of Fire feat) to pass through the gate.

MYRATMA

The ruins of this ancient efreet settlement lie beneath the forti-

ed Tethyrian city bearing the same name. The dwarves of High

Shanatar removed the brass xtures that had adorned the original

city and dismantled its buildings to line their newly built tunnels

and halls with scarlet brick.

A  vengeful  undead  guardian  named  Kalloch  (LE  female

human mummy sorcerer 9) has lived in Myratmas tunnels since

the fall of the city. Over the centuries, she has amassed a mighty

army of undead, recruiting her soldiers from the Tethyrian grave-

yards that connect to her tunnels. Flameskulls (see page 171),

ghouls, ghasts, and worse now clog Myratmas ancient tunnels,

waiting for Kallochs order to feast on the citizenry above.

Jhaamdath

The empire of Jhaamdath originated north of the Nikerymath

Forest  (now  the  Chondalwood)  as  a  confederation  of  twelve

cities  that  shared  strong  interests  in  military  expansion  and

mercantile trade. Jhaamdaths people were renowned for their

the imprisoned genie lord Calim and contains an impressive

THE NECROPOLISES OF NYKKAR

Throughout the long history of Coramshan and Calimshan, the

necroppar (clerics of the dead) prepared the dead for afterlife in

the sacred necropolises of Nykkar. The bakkals and nobles were

entombed  in  Calim  See,  while  commoners  were  buried  under

these necropolises.

First Necropolis: This collection of ruined buildings sits on a

wind-blasted plateau in the hills west of the Marching Mountains.

Crumbling walls and fallen roofs are all that remain of ancient

preparation  chambers,  laboratories,  temples,  and  libraries,  but

dozens of scattered stairwells still give access to the underground

tombs. Dirt and debris carried by the constant winds have scoured

the  ruins,  eroding  away  the  stone  signs  and  statues  that  once

southern shore of Calimshan near the mouth of the River of Ice,

is the only one of the three necropolises that is currently active.

Its purpose is the same as that of the othersto prepare the rulers

High Shanatar

At its height, the kingdom of High Shanatar stretched from the

River Agis and the Marching Mountains to the Troll Mountains,

and  from  the  western  coast  to  the  Alamir  Mountains.  The

kingdom included cities both atop and beneath the ruined cities

of Memnonnar, as well as isolated dwarfholds carved into the

mountains to the north.

During the 3,360 years that High Shanatar lasted, the Stout

Folk rarely knew peace. Wars against the First Kingdom of Mir

and the giants of Nedeheim greatly weakened the dwarf kingdom,

and centuries of persecution by the rulers of Calimshan drove it

into a long, inexorable decline. A few citizens of High Shanatar

eventually ed underground to Deep Shanatar or voyaged north

to found other realms, such as Oghrann, Ammarindar, Delzoun,

and Haunghdannar.

Most of High Shanatars surviving ruins share traits typical

of shield dwarf realmsgreat square chambers, vaulted ceilings,

and vast halls, some measuring as much as a mile long. Invariably,

such ruins are protected by deadly mechanical traps, golems, and

magical rooms that are actually constructs.

FORTRESS OF THE WAILING DWARF

Fortress Kuldelvon is the proper name of a memorial citadel

built nearly seven thousand years ago in the Troll Mountains to

honor the dwarf hero Karlyn Kuldelver. Carved into the western

mountainside  of  Mount  Batyr  is  an  image  of  a  tremendous

dwarf. Wind owing into its hollow ears and eyes rushes out

its mouth, producing an eerie cacophony of cries that echoes

throughout the valley below. Behind the graven dwarf lies an

entire dwarven city that was abandoned when the rest of High

Shanatar  fell.  The  exiled  hunched  giant  Managg  (CE  male

maurUnd giant barbarian 3) rules over half a dozen troll tribes

dwelling within Fortress Kuldelvon.

THE GREAT SPANS

The most visible ruins of High Shanatar are its rune-covered

bridges,  which  span  rivers  and  valleys  all  over  southwestern

Faern. These great stone bridges are adorned with ancient runes

that serve as maps to the fallen holds of High Shanatar.

In  the  Omlaranding  Mountains  is  a  great  span  infested

with displacer beasts and wyverns. Known as Borthuns Walk,

it leads to a forgotten keep built by Clan Diamondblade. Along

Eshpurta Road just east of the Amnite city of Keczulla stand

twin bridges built by the dwarves of the subkingdom Korolnor.

Clan Kuldelver Bridge (called the Axe Bridge by Amnites) spans

the Vudlur River. The Karlyn Bridge (called the Star Bridge by

the Amnites), which spans the Splendarrllur River, was part of a

dwarf-built road that led to the Fortress of the Wailing Dwarf.

NEMESSOR TUNNEL

Naturally formed passages lead from surface caves on Nemes-

sor Island to the ruins of an abandoned mining colony below.

The great hall and several side chambers are lled with piles of

broken stonethe remains of the structures that once housed

the colony. Scattered about the chambers is a variety of aged and

rusted mining equipment of dwarven make.

Beyond the ruined hall, a partially collapsed tunnel leads east

under the Sea of Swords, then branches out into a network of

subterranean highways that passes under Zazesspur, Shoonach,

and the Starspire Mountains. The tunnel and its side chambers

are  choked  with  deadly  plantsnotably  shriekers,  sporebatsFF,

udorootsXPH,  violet  fungi,  and  yellow  musk  creepersFF.  For

centuries, several tribes of xenophobic myconidsMM2 have rooted

here, cultivating the aggressive plants to defend their kingdom.

RRINNOROTH

This dwarven ghost town sits on a plateau on a southwestern

mountain in the Kuldin Peaks. Rrinnoroth was built as an outpost

to protect High Shanatar from the goblin raiders in the valleys

below. A major tunnel below the site leads down to the ruins of

Drakkalor, an abandoned city of Deep Shanatar now inhabited

by a confederation of skulks.

An ancient red dragon named Charvekannathor the Scarlet

has laired in Rrinnoroth for more than eight hundred years. Over

the centuries, he has stripped the cavernous dwarfhold of every

valuable and set up explosive traps and teleportation wards to

protect his lair and treasure hoard. Charvekannathor takes ight

several times a month to hunt prey in the nearby valleys.

SWORDSMERE

Inside Mount Sklagarra in the western part of the Troll Moun-

tains, an abandoned complex of dwarf-carved caverns surrounds

a subterranean lake full of carnivorous, sightless sh. On a lone

island  in  the  center  of  the  lake  sits  an  elegant  manor  called

Heralds Hall that serves as the secret headquarters of the Heralds,

a renegade group of Harpers. The manor contains innumerable

artifacts, spellbooks, and weapons that have made history in the

past few centuries.

The Heralds sealed off the passages leading from Swordsmere

to Deep Shanatar to ensure their privacy, leaving no external

entrances. Thus, the complex is accessible only by portals from

Athkatla,  Baldurs  Gate,  Beregost,  Eshpurta,  and  Murann.

Dozens of runic guardians and shield guardians patrol the tunnels

and caverns, and even the area under the lake. They recognize

only Herald members and have orders to contain and imprison

all others.

Memnonnar

More than nine thousand years ago, the noble efreeti Memnon

founded a kingdom on a narrow strip of land along the Sea of

Swords. Memnonnar, as it was named, was bounded by the Sul-

duskoon River in the north and the River Agis in the south. Its

cities were lled with towers, temples, and citadels of scarlet brick

topped by domes and minarets inlaid with brass, much like the

buildings in the fabled City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of

Fire. The streets teemed with human, genasi, and efreet citizens,

while slaves toiled underground, mining gems and precious metal

for their ery lords.

After Memnons imprisonment by elven magic, the surviving

efreet foresaw their doom and hid their genie lore and magic from

the humans. Shortly thereafter, the forces of Coramshan drove off

and slew Memnons genies and razed most of his cities. Dwarves

out of High Shanatar settled in the abandoned cities, only to be

expelled later by furious Calishites who would brook no dwarves

within their lands. During the ensuing centuries, the Calishites

resettled many of the ancient efreet cities and built new ones over

the ruins of the old. Thus, most of Memnonnars surviving ruins

represent a mix of dwarven, efreet, and human architecture.

MEMNONNAR

Memnon led his Army of Fire to Faern through the portal

known as the Great Brass Gate and founded the city of Memnon-

nar around it. Now, thousands of years later, half of Memnons

once-great efreet metropolis lies in ruins. The surviving half, now

the Calishite city of Memnon, lies just across the Agis River.

The  fact  that  the  brick  ruins  of  Memnonnar  are  hot  to

the touch is a smoldering reminder that an open portal to the

Elemental Plane of Fire that lies below them. Hidden under the

smoking rubble are luxurious palace rooms, lost chambers lled

with  arcane  treasures,  and  vaults  overowing  with  rubies  and

genie gold. Armed garrisons from Fort Agis make annual forays

to these ruins to hunt elementals and seek treasure.

The mine tunnels below the ruins, where the walls are so hot

that they glow, are home to re elementals, mephits, salamanders,

and various other heat-loving creatures.

Deep below the center of the original city lies the Great Brass

Gatea massive brass ring about 100 feet in diameter that hovers

vertically above the dungeon oor. The gate is a two-way portal

to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and the hellish conditions around

it have been created by portal seepage. The passages and caverns

nearest the gate are lled with smoky, unbreathable air, and any

creature within 50 feet of it takes 2d6 points of re damage

every round.

The Great Brass Gate has been guarded since the fall of the

city by a bodyguard of Memnon who was tasked to serve until

death. Ufbrann (LE male efreeti ghter 4) allows only creatures

with ery bloodlines (such as re genasi or characters with the

Bloodline of Fire feat) to pass through the gate.

MYRATMA

The ruins of this ancient efreet settlement lie beneath the forti-

ed Tethyrian city bearing the same name. The dwarves of High

Shanatar removed the brass xtures that had adorned the original

city and dismantled its buildings to line their newly built tunnels

and halls with scarlet brick.

A  vengeful  undead  guardian  named  Kalloch  (LE  female

human mummy sorcerer 9) has lived in Myratmas tunnels since

the fall of the city. Over the centuries, she has amassed a mighty

army of undead, recruiting her soldiers from the Tethyrian grave-

yards that connect to her tunnels. Flameskulls (see page 171),

ghouls, ghasts, and worse now clog Myratmas ancient tunnels,

waiting for Kallochs order to feast on the citizenry above.

Jhaamdath

The empire of Jhaamdath originated north of the Nikerymath

Forest  (now  the  Chondalwood)  as  a  confederation  of  twelve

cities  that  shared  strong  interests  in  military  expansion  and

mercantile trade. Jhaamdaths people were renowned for their

118

119

THE IMPERIAL SOUTH

THE IMPERIAL SOUTH

swordsmanship, a fact that earned the confederation the name

Twelve Cities of the Sword.

Jhaamdath was originally governed by a psiocracya ruling

body of powerful psions and psychic warriors known as bladelords

who were drawn from prominent noble families. In 276 DR, a

military coup dissolved the bladelord psiocracy and installed a pow-

erful metamind (see Expanded Psionics Handbook) as emperor.

Imperial  Jhaamdath  expanded  rapidly  west  and  south.  Its

leaders also turned a covetous eye on the Sea of Fallen Stars and

began to build a great naval armada in preparation for conquering

the inland sea. The need for wood to build their ships turned the

people of Jhaamdath into terrible despoilers of nearby woodlands.

Jhaamdathan forces mercilessly slaughtered the elves of Nikery-

math when the latter fought to defend their forest home, but still

Jhaamdath sought more wood. In desperation, the elves of the

Chondalwood used elven high magic to call forth a tremendous

tidal wave from the Sea of Fallen Stars and send it crashing over

Jhaamdath, drowning all twelve of its great cities.

The  tidal  wave  expanded  Jhaamdath  Bay  and  reshaped  it

into the Vilhon Reach of today. A few isolated towers and keeps

that  survived  the  great  wave  later  sank  underwater  because  of

the changed seascape. The only Jhaamdathan sites that entirely

escaped the catastrophe were graveyards and outposts far from the

submerged cities and the ruins of Lirremar, now buried beneath

the city of Hlondeth.

Today,  the  sea  basin   oor  under  the  Vilhon  Reach  (called

Selmal Basin) is littered with the rubble of Jhaamdaths twelve

cities. Psionic energy leaking from the dozens of famed psionic

swords and artifacts that now lie beneath stones, sea plants, and

sand has perverted many of the local sea creatures into phrenic

monsters (see Expanded Psionics Handbook). The structures that

sank intact are now occupied by koalinths, sea hags, and scrags.

The dangers inherent to underwater adventuring have thus far

prevented most land dwellers from exploring this sea basin.

DHINNILITH

No underwater explorer has yet located the ruins of Dhinnilith,

Jhaamdaths imperial city, but legends persist that it somehow

survived the ancient catastrophe. On a moonless night every few

years, a phantom city of stone slowly appears in the air just above

the waters of the Vilhon Reach. At sunrise, the city fades away

to whatever nether dimension spawned it. Sages are at a loss to

explain the citys strange appearances, the last of which occurred

in the Year of the Unstrung Harp (1371 DR).

The phantom city is deserted except for a cloudlike undead

creature formed from the psychic residue of the citys sudden

demise.  This  tormented  creature  is  a  caller  in  darkness  (see

Expanded Psionics Handbook) of unusual size and power (22 Hit

Dice). Its form shows thousands of human faces, all screaming

out silently in terror and pain.

No one has yet explored this ghost city, or even determined

whether its streets are substantial enough to be walked upon.

DORDRIEN

After the fall of the Twelve Cities of the Sword, a Jhaamdathan

noble named Dordrien led a band of survivors north across the

Sea of Fallen Stars and founded a town on the site that would

later become Daggerdale. On the western slopes of the Dagger

Hills, he raised a sizable keep to guard the small Jhaamdathan

enclave, which endured for more than a century before orc raids

caused its decline.

Few  traces  remain  today  of  the  human  settlement  that

preceded Daggerdale. However, the crumbling foundations of

Dordrien Keep are still visible on a barren hilltop, and the crypts

of the Dordrien family can be found 2 miles to the north of

that ruin.

The Crypts of Dordrien are built into the limestone caverns

beneath  Dagger  Hills.  Natural  tunnels  in  the  caves  lead  to  a

drow  outpost  called  Szith  Morcane  in  the  Upper  Underdark.

Drow refugees from the recently destroyed city of Maerimydra

had been using the crypts as a staging ground for surface raids

until adventurers hired by Randal Morn, ruler of Daggerdale,

ended that effort. The crypts are now home to numerous undead

Jhaamdathan royalty, plus a nest of bebiliths summoned by the

drow  wizard  Solom  Nedrazak,  Archmage  of  Szith  Morcane

(CE male drow wizard 13/archmage 2). Irritated by constant

interruptions from the surface, Solom plans to create a magical

barrier in the crypts to permanently separate his outpost from

the surface world.

JHOURAM

Built on a hilly region just 10 miles south of the Silvanus Eyes

islands in Jhaamdath Bay, this port city was well known for its

robust trade with the coastal kingdoms surrounding the Sea of

Fallen Stars. When the elf-wrought disaster struck, Jhourams

hills  dispersed  the  main  force  of  the  tidal  wave,  preserving

many of the buildings behind them. The sections of the city

that  survived  the  disaster  later  sank,  though  they  remained

mostly intact.

The gray-stoned rotundas, colonnaded halls, and domed palaces

that made up Jhourams center are now grown over with barnacles

and ropy sea plants. Marintagh (CE female sea hag sorcerer 10)

and a pair of green hags rule over a tribe of kapoacinths from

the palace of the citys bladelord. The sea hags minions have

recovered a wealth of psionic weapons, gold, and gems from the

port citys vaults and armory.

Shoon Imperium

In the Sixth Age of Calimshan, the Shoon Dynasty established

its brutal rule over the empire. During the next four centuries,

the  Shoon  Imperium  also  gained  control  of  lands  from  the

River Chionthar to Tashalar, and from the Trackless Sea to the

Landrise. The dynasty of Shoon spanned a mere fourteen rulers,

and all its emperors were talented spellcasters and arcane research-

ers who delighted in creating magic items and spells.

Four centuries of unbridled Shoon expansionism demanded

construction  on  an  unheard-of  scale.  Dozens  of  thick-walled

fort-towers and watchtowers were built to secure newly conquered

lands, and numerous extravagant palaces were built of colorful

brick  to  house  the  ever-traveling  royal  court.  In  secret,  the

Shoon emperors ordered the creation of subterranean chambers

in  which  they  could  conduct  life-prolonging  experiments  in

absolute privacy.

120

The  notoriously  cruel  Shoon  rulers  oversaw  the  massive

slaughter of dwarves, gnomes, and elves in neighboring realms

and  conducted  bizarre  experiments  on  captured  unicorns,

dragons, and fey, hoping to wring the secrets of eternal youth

from their captives. During this time, wild elves were eradicated

from the Snakewood, and most of the elves in the Wealdath

and the Forest of Mir were slaughtered. Nor were the merci-

less Shoon above killing Calishitestheir violent purges slew

millions of citizens and reduced huge sections of Shoon cities

to dust and rubble. The rulers overly cruel nature and great

ambitions ultimately caused its enemies to unite and bring down

the empire, destroying the Shoon dynasty and burning down

its infamous imperial city.

SHOONACH

In the Shoon dynastys last days, Shoonach, the imperial capital,

was razed by the forces of King Strohm of Tethyr and a silver

dragon  descended  from  Rhimnasarl,  the  great  wyrm  slain  by

Q ysar Shoon IV. Now the former seat of the evil Shoon Imperium

is a sprawling, ruined metropolis alongside the River Agis. Miles

of crumbling stone buildings and paved streets radiate outward

from the remains of the imperial center. Dozens of undead beings

and monstrous tribes dwell within these ruins, prevented from

escaping by ancient magical wards set by Shoons emperors.

The  ruins  of  Shoonach  consist  of  more  than  a  half-dozen

identi able districts, all of which lie within its great outer walls.

The  elds in the citys western, central, and southeastern areas

(once called Fedhiyajar, or Grain Towns) now grow wild wheat,

tendriculoses, and other carnivorous plants. Only shattered bar-

racks, smithies, and training arenas now remain in the district of

Iltakar (once called the Warriors City) in the northern part of

Shoonach. This district is home to  fty gnolls who follow Bhurkh

(LE male gnoll  ghter 6), a charismatic leader seeking to conquer

the ruins. Just west of the Imperial City district was Mamlukkar,

the Slave Village. Massive walls were erected around this district

after Shoonach fell, presumably to stave off some magical disease

that had swept the area. The moans of plague-rotted undead can

be heard day and night from inside the walled area.

The Imperial City district, built around the great hill known

as the Imperial Mount, lies at the heart of the ruins. In this

section are the burnt shells of the imperiums once lavish temples,

palaces, of cial buildings, and residences. Undead from this area

constantly attack the tribes of lamias, gnolls, and goblins that

live in Shoonachs other districts. An extensive undercity below

Imperial Mount serves as an outpost for a small garrison of drow

that has already recovered a wealth of magic items.

In the eastern section of Shoonach is Debukkher, the Town of

Tombsa wide-open expanse of broken boulevards and crumbling

statues. Dozens of tunnel entrances in this area lead underground to

opulent crypts and tombs in which mortuary paintings and carved

reliefs portray the grandiose lives of long-dead viziers and calephs.

Below the tomb city lies the hidden lair of Q ysar Shoon VII (NE

male human demilichEL necromancer 31/archmage 5)perhaps

the last survivor of the Shoon Dynasty. After centuries of lichdom,

Shoon VII became a demilich and was somehow imprisoned within

the Tome of the Unicorn. Freed just before the Fall of the Gods,

to dust and rubble. The rulers overly cruel nature and great

ambitions ultimately caused its enemies to unite and bring down

the empire, destroying the Shoon dynasty and burning down

its infamous imperial city.

SHOONACH

In the Shoon dynastys last days, Shoonach, the imperial capital,

was razed by the forces of King Strohm of Tethyr and a silver

dragon  descended  from  Rhimnasarl,  the  great  wyrm  slain  by

Q ysar Shoon IV. Now the former seat of the evil Shoon Imperium

is a sprawling, ruined metropolis alongside the River Agis. Miles

of crumbling stone buildings and paved streets radiate outward

from the remains of the imperial center. Dozens of undead beings

and monstrous tribes dwell within these ruins, prevented from

escaping by ancient magical wards set by Shoons emperors.

The  ruins  of  Shoonach  consist  of  more  than  a  half-dozen

identi able districts, all of which lie within its great outer walls.

The  elds in the citys western, central, and southeastern areas

(once called Fedhiyajar, or Grain Towns) now grow wild wheat,

tendriculoses, and other carnivorous plants. Only shattered bar-

racks, smithies, and training arenas now remain in the district of

Iltakar (once called the Warriors City) in the northern part of

Shoonach. This district is home to  fty gnolls who follow Bhurkh

(LE male gnoll  ghter 6), a charismatic leader seeking to conquer

the ruins. Just west of the Imperial City district was Mamlukkar,

the Slave Village. Massive walls were erected around this district

after Shoonach fell, presumably to stave off some magical disease

that had swept the area. The moans of plague-rotted undead can

be heard day and night from inside the walled area.

The Imperial City district, built around the great hill known

as the Imperial Mount, lies at the heart of the ruins. In this

section are the burnt shells of the imperiums once lavish temples,

palaces, of cial buildings, and residences. Undead from this area

constantly attack the tribes of lamias, gnolls, and goblins that

live in Shoonachs other districts. An extensive undercity below

Imperial Mount serves as an outpost for a small garrison of drow

that has already recovered a wealth of magic items.

In the eastern section of Shoonach is Debukkher, the Town of

Tombsa wide-open expanse of broken boulevards and crumbling

statues. Dozens of tunnel entrances in this area lead underground to

opulent crypts and tombs in which mortuary paintings and carved

reliefs portray the grandiose lives of long-dead viziers and calephs.

Below the tomb city lies the hidden lair of Q ysar Shoon VII (NE

male human demilichEL necromancer 31/archmage 5)perhaps

the last survivor of the Shoon Dynasty. After centuries of lichdom,

Shoon VII became a demilich and was somehow imprisoned within

the Tome of the Unicorn. Freed just before the Fall of the Gods,

moon elf wizard 3) while attempting to drain her soul, thanks

to the magical chaos of the Time of Troubles. Zallanora is now

imprisoned in the Tome of the Unicorn in his stead.

The Shoon qysars protected their cities with mythal-like magic

wards and spell effects that still prevent undead from entering

or leaving the city. Fire spells cast anywhere in Shoonach are

treated  as  if  affected  by  the  Maximize  Spell  feat,  although

they do not require higher spell slots or longer casting times.

Teleportation magic and spells with the air or cold descriptor

are impeded, requiring a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level)

to cast. A 4 penalty applies to attack rolls and damage rolls

with all projectile weapons.

Tethir

The Forest of Wealdath (once called Tethir) is a woodland of

great mystery and intrigue. Using high magic developed ages ago

by the elves of ancient Keltormir, the Fair Folk of the forest

imprisoned two godlike genies of Calimshan. But humans fearful

of high magic began to persecute the elves of Keltormirs frag-

mented forests. The ensuing centuries of warfare with Calimshan

reduced the elf population of Tethir to nearly nothing, leaving

dozens of abandoned villages and towns throughout the Forest

of Wealdath.

The ruins of Tethir, like the elven villages of today, are hidden

high in the treetops of the forest. Sculpted by a mysterious life-

magic that the native elves still practice, the ancient villages of

Tethir are composed of magically shaped trees linked by bridges

molded from vines and branches. Few walking upon the forests

trails realize that they are traveling under a lost elf enclave, since

the individual dwellings are concealed in hollowed treetops and

on disguised platforms.

Many of these abandoned elven villages still endure, although

the passage of time has rendered them unrecognizable. Centuries

of  unchecked  tree  growth  have  concealed  many  of  the  older

dwellings, and most have sustained some damage from lightning,

wind,  re, and blight. Explorers skilled in the ways of the forest

know that elven ruins and lore can be found as easily in a fallen

tree trunk as in an ancient city high in the treetops.

MYTH RHYNN

The abandoned, mythal-cloaked city of Myth Rhynn lies deep in

the Wealdath within a densely forested area known as Mytharan

Woods, which is home to gnolls, lycanthropes, dragons, and spiders

of all kinds. Myth Rhynn was built by the elves of Keltormirthe

ancestors of the Fair Folk who presently dwell within the Forest

of Wealdath.

Myth Rhynn once served as an elven burial ground, with each

tree marking the entrance to an underground crypt. The dead of

ancient Keltormir rest in the lower tombs, and the elves interred

after Keltormirs fall occupy the upper tombs.

The ancient mythal aroints all necromantic magic, including

any effect that would animate or raise the dead. These archaic

wards once prevented dragons and humans from entering the

city as well, but the mythal has decayed considerably with the

passage of time, and now anyone can enter. The corruption has

also created a plant growth effect, and dozens of stone tombs

have been cracked open by monstrous tree roots and vines.

A human lich named Mallin (LE male human lich evoker 14)

has claimed the tombs of Myth Rhynn for his lair. His decayed

physical  form  makes  him  appear  to  be  nothing  more  than  a

disembodied collection of  ying bones. Mallin despises the wild

elves of Wealdath, but he chooses not to leave the protection of

the corrupted mythal when dealing with the Fair Folk.

TALLTREES

This abandoned village of nearly two dozen trees lies in the south

central region of the Wealdath. Talltrees was once a center of

healing and learning for the elves of Tethir, but now it serves

as  a  resting  place  for  elf  sentinels  patrolling  the  forest.  Four

disguised  tree  trunks  house  the  only  forest- oor  entrances  to

the village above. The lowest dwellings of Talltrees are 30 feet

off the ground, and most of the homes are hidden even higher

in the forest canopy. The villages aged branch-bridges no longer

support the weight of a Medium humanoid, so travel through

the treetops is quite treacherous.

During the Age of Shoon, the Fair Folk grew to fear the magic

of the Shoon wizards, so they made secret forays into Shoonach

towers  and  libraries  to  steal  arcane  items  that  might  be  used

against them. They concealed their loot (including Calishite staffs,

war-wands, protective rings, and elemental spellbooks) within deep

tree roots, trunk-towers, and extradimensional vaults in Talltrees,

then set lethal traps and druidic wards to protect it.

Talltrees  is  presently  under  the  protection  of  Irindriaul

Greenleaves (NG female wild elf druid 11). The self-appointed

curator of Talltrees, she considers it her duty to prevent anyone

from plundering the abandoned city.

Legacies of the Past

The empires of Calimshan, Jhaamdath, Tethir, and Shanatar have

left their marks forever upon the face of Faern in the form of

ruins, artifacts, and legends. Many hidden treasures from these

empires still lie forgotten in ruins, and many imprisoned creatures

from these ancient days await release.

Adventure Seeds

Most adventures in the ruins of the ancient South require peril-

ous journeys through exotic lands that are very different from

the Western Heartlands or cities of the Sword Coast. Rumors

of old dwarven ruins, strange elven villages, and hidden dynastic

vaults can entice adventurers from anywhere in Faern to seek

out  their  share  of  strange  high  magic,  curious  psionic  blades,

and fabulous riches.

CLAIMANT TO THE THRONE

In the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR), shield dwarves from clan

Ghalmrin recovered the Wyrmskull Throne and hid it in their

dwarfhold deep within the Starspire Mountains. The clan has

direct blood ties to the old kings of Shanatar, but it lacks the

support needed to rule because its numbers are too few. Thus,

Clan Ghalmrin has offered the Wyrmskull Throne to the  rst

to bring about a great change for all dwarves in the South.

SUNKEN AHJUUTAL

Fishermen in the Shining Sea have recently located the drowned

city of Ahjuutal some 30 miles south of Almraiven. Much of

the ancient city appears intact and relatively close to the surface,

although the buildings are overgrown with kelp and encrusted

with coral growths. The discovery of the long-lost city has sparked

great interest throughout Calimshan. Adventurers, thieves, and

sages are seeking brave ship captains to ferry them to the ruined

marid city, which predates even Coramshan. Viziers and advisors

to the caliph caution that the discovery of Ahjuutal after so many

centuries may be a sign that the noble marid Ajhuu (or one of

his kin) has returned to claim what once belonged to him.

SWORDWRAITHS OF JHAAMDATH

Thousands of Jhaamdathan warriors drowned the night their

empire fell, but death did not still their sword arms, and they

rose  again  as  undead  swordwraithsFF.  In  recent  weeks,  they

have begun to trudge out of the waters of the Vilhon Reach

at sundown. Marching singly or in pairs, they visit death upon

nearby  coastal  cities,  seeking  out  elves  in  preference  to  other

targets when possible.

For the past year, the number of swordwraith attacks has been

steadily growing, giving rise to panic in the coastal cities of the

Vilhon Reach. No cause has yet been pinpointed for the rising

undead rampage, and most agree that only someone brave or

foolhardy enough to plunge deep into the bay waters can discover

the cause of these assaults.

Buried Secrets

In addition to the constant threat posed by raiders, dragons, and

goblinkin in the Imperial South and the Vilhon Reach, insidious

perils with dire histories await discovery in some of Faerns less

accessible areas.

THE CALIM DESERT

When  the  minds  of  the  disembodied  genie  lords  Calim  and

Memnon battle each other, the Calim Desert rages with  ery

sandstorms. Over the centuries, their innumerable con icts have

transformed  the  regions  previously  fertile  plains  into  scarred

wastelands  of  burnt  sands  and  broken  stone.  The  nomads  of

the Calim Desert often refer to the genies warring presences

as  Calims  Breath,  the  Scorching,  Memnons  Crackle,  or  the

Firewinds.

122

123

THE IMPERIAL SOUTH

Elven wards prevent the two genie lords from leaving the

Calim Desert or entering any city within its boundaries. Neither

genie can form a physical body and so cannot be harmed in any

way. Both use illusions to communicate with others, since they

have no actual voices.

Calims disembodied presence lls the air above the desert and

makes his presence known with wind. The noble djinni has the

following spell-like abilities: 3/daygust of wind (DC 19), major

image (DC 20), wind wall; 1/daycontrol weather, whirlwind

(DC 25). Caster level 17th.

Memnon is bound to the earth of the  desert.  A  sharp  in-

crease in temperature or a slowly moving sand dune indicates

his presence. The noble efreeti can use the following spell-like

abilities: 3/daymajor image (DC 19), wall of re, wall of stone;

1/dayincendiary cloud (DC 24), earthquake (DC 24). Caster

level 17th.

The blasted sands of the Calim Desert also hide the ruins of

various forgotten cities and old forts. Travelers in this parched

land  must  take  care  to  avoid  the  nomadic  raiders  and  purple

worms that make the desert their home.

THE CALIMEMNON CRYSTAL

This crystal is the greatest legacy of the elves of Tethir and Mir.

Grown with the aid of high magic, the diamondlike gem contains

the trapped physical forms of the genies Calim and Memnon, as

well as more than one hundred of their genie servants.

The  Calimemnon  Crystal  oats  within  another  construct

of  elven  high  magicthe  Spinning Keep of Sirwadjen.  This

bizarre structure is a rounded tower that hovers above the Calim

Desert. Numerous spellwards around it prevent access by sending

intruders to the far ends of Faern, and dozens of air elementals

patrol the halls of the chilly keep. The chamber containing the

crystal is freezing cold and illuminated only by the soft light of

the crystal itself. If the disembodied mind of either genie were to

bypass the Spinning Keeps wards and touch the crystal, it would

be reunited with its physical form and gain the powers of all the

other genies in the gem.

The  ancient  baelnorn  Pharos  (N  male  moon  elf  baelnorn

wizard 24) cast the high magic that created the crystal prison

and the keep, and he has stood guard over both for nearly nine

thousand years. He has placed illusions of the crystal throughout

the keep to mislead gem-seekers and set traps to warn him of

their presence.

THE SLUMBER OF THE WIND

During Coramshans bloody purge of geniekind, Calims generals

placed their leaders queen and twin sons in temporal stasis and

hid them in an extradimensional space in the Forest of Mir. Like

Mordenkainens magnicent mansion, the palace is invisible on

the outside and spacious on the inside. In addition to the three

genies, the palace holds most of Calims art, riches, and magic

treasures. The ancient crystal dragonMM2 Klaruuotur and several

vassal djinn loyal to Calim tend to the sleeping royal family and

await their lords release.

Heirs to the Empire

Of the Imperial Souths many civilizations, only Calimshan has

endured  until  the  present  day.  The  southern  kingdoms  of  the

elves and dwarves fared far worse, leaving behind only scattered

remnants of their previous civilizations.

CALIMSHAN

Calimshan is the oldest of all human civilizations still in existence,

and it remains the foremost power in southwestern Faern. The

Calishites  are  renowned  for  their  love  of  luxury,  wealth,  and

impressive titles, and their cities are famous for exotic bazaars, de-

bauched harems, and murderous thieves guilds. The current ruler

of Calimshan, Syl-Pasha Pesarkhal, seeks to continue this period

of peace by forging alliances with neighboring kingdoms.

ELVES OF WEALDATH

The once numerous Fair Folk of Tethir have been reduced to

two elf tribes. Under the dark foliage of the Forest of Tethyr,

the elves of Elmanesse and Suldusk dwell among the mysterious

ruins of their ancestors. Treespeaker Rhothomir (N male wild elf

cleric 11 of Rillifane), a somber elord from the hidden forest

village of Suldanessellar, rules both tribes jointly. Bowlord Allain

Kevanarial (NG male wild elf ranger 4/sorcerer 3/arcane archer

3), the spokesperson for the Elmanesse, patrols the northern and

central regions of the Wealdath and is the forests nest archer.

Scoutlord Mirthal Aendryr (N male wild elf ghter 10/rogue

10) patrols the more dangerous eastern portions of the woods

where the Suldusk elves dwell.

Both the Bowlord and the Scoutlord forbid logging within the

foresta policy that threatens the fragile peace between the elves

and the Tethyrian humans. The wild elves remain suspicious of

any humans and are skeptical of any overtures from the lords

of Tethyr.

The  Eldreth  Veluuthra  is  not  active  in  the  Wealdath,  but

the organization would have no shortage of members should it

ever seek to recruit here. Many wild elves view the high magic

that imprisoned Calim and Memnon with great scorn because it

freed the humans of Calimshan to begin their war of persecution

against the elves. In fact, these elves would prefer to see the high

magic undone, in the hope that the freed genies might once again

enslave their former human subjects.

ILTKAZAR, THE MITHRAL KINGDOM

Bereft  of  its  sister  kingdoms  for  almost  thirteen  centuries,

the  Mithral  Kingdom  of  Iltkazar  survives  as  the  last  dwarf

kingdom of Shanatar. King Mith Barak (LG male great wyrm

silver dragon) rules the Mithral Kingdom in the illusory guise

of a shield dwarf.

An ancient library in Iltkazar preserves much lore from the

lost kingdoms of High Shanatar and Deep Shanatar as runes

engraved on countless mithral plates. Few nondwarves are permit-

ted to view these archives, which hold much of Shanatars lost

lore. (See Underdark for more about Iltkazar.)

the Dream of

Cormanthyr

While Netheril climbed to its zenith in

what is now the Anauroch Desert, the

greatest  elven  civilization  Faern  has

ever known arose in the Great Forest to the east. The empire of

Cormanthyr stretched from the Stormhorns to the Dragon Reach.

Its capital was Myth Drannor, the City of Song, which produced

marvels of magic, art, and poetry.

In  many  ways,  the  passing  of  Cormanthyr  represented  the

end of elven civilization in Faern. Never again would a grand

empire of the elves rise on the mainland. The pockets of elven

power that still exist todayEvereska, Evermeet, and the forests

of Tethyrare but shadows of Cormanthyrs grandeur.

Compared  with  the  elven  civilizations  of  the  Crown  Wars

era, Cormanthyr fell comparatively recently. Many of its ruins

still stand in the depths of the forest known as Cormanthor, and

numerous inhabitants of Myth Drannor are still alive in one form

or another. Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Blackstaff

Arunsun, both of whom were heavily involved in the citys politics,

are still important personages in Faern, and many of the demons

and devils involved in the sack of the city still brood in their foul

lairs in the Abyss and the Nine Hells.

Infernal inuence was a strong factor in the fall of Corman-

thyr. Other empires were brought down by civil war, internal

politics, or strange, monstrous foes, but Cormanthyrs fall was

largely the handiwork of endish forces. Powerful ends of all evil

alignments still inhabit Cormanthyrs ruins along with their lesser

servitors and lackeys, and Myth Drannor fairly teems with the

inhabitants of the Lower Planes. Fiend-infested Cormanthyran

ruins are an excellent way to bring an element of supernatural

terror  (or  just  good  old-fashioned  demon-stomping)  into  your

campaign.

History

The history of Cormanthyr stretches from approximately 4000

DR  until  the  Fall  of  Myth  Drannor  in  714  DR,  which  is  ap-

propriately called the Year of Doom. General information is easy

to come by, since many records, journals, and chronicles tell of

125

Cormanthyr and the Fall of Myth Drannor. The elves doubtless

have even more information, but they do not share it lightly with

other races.

Naming Notes

Elf naming conventions can be a bit confusing because many

names sound alike. The primary terms used in this chapter

are dened below.

Cormanthyr  is  the  name  of  the  predominantly  elven

empire that arose in the forest of Cormanthor in 4000 DR.

Cormanthyr is pronounced kor-man-THEER.

Cormanthor  is  the  name  of  the  forest  in  which  the

Cormanthyr Empire was located, and also the name of the

empires capital before the raising of its mythal. As the name

of the forest, the term is pronounced kor-manth-OR, and as

the name of the city, it is pronounced kor-MANTH-or.

Myth Drannor is the name given to Cormanthor (the city)

after its mythal was raised.

records  of  Cormanthyrs  history.  Copious  and  largely  complete

annals  of  Cormanthyrs  history  can  be  found  in  any  major

library,  especially  in  areas  with  large  elf  populations  (such  as

Evermeet, Evereska, or Silverymoon). The elves have kept certain

secretssuch as the ultimate fate of the nether scrollsfrom the

historians  of  other  races,  but  most  of  Cormanthyrs  history  is

readily accessible to the average PC with a little bit of dedicated

research and a Knowledge (history) check (see Table 81: Corman-

thyr Information for DCs).

Songs and Stories

The history of Cormanthyr begins with the six elven nations that

combined to form the empire.

KINGDOMS TO EMPIRE

After the vicious ghting of the Crown Wars, the Elven Court

became the rst permanent settlement in the Arcorar (the forest

that  would  later  become  Cormanthor).  Though  never  heavily

populated, the Elven Court was nevertheless an important seat

of elven power in mainland Faern.

Meanwhile, far to the northwest of the Elven Court, the sylvan

elf civilization of Rystall Wood was a wild, carefree realm in what

is now the Border Forest. Though Rystall Wood survived for many

centuries, little physical evidence of its existence remains, since the

sylvan elves built few permanent structures.

At  the  heart  of  the  Great  Forest,  the  citizens  of  the  pre-

dominantly sun elf settlement known as Jhyrennstar used powerful

magic to grow the trees to phenomenal heights. To the southwest,

refugees from Aryvandaar founded the nation of Uvaeren.

Other elven settlements at that time included Yrlaancel, a small

city-state near the border of Rystall Wood, and Semberholme, a

refuge for the mothers, children, and elderly of the Elven Court.

From these six lands, the great empire of Cormanthyr was born.

WAR AND PEACE

Throughout  the  millennia  following  the  Crown  Wars,  the  six

realms  of Arcorar  ourished  and  grew,  despite intermittent at-

tacks by goblins, orcs, and drow. Jhyrennstars wizards and druids

nurtured the trees in their realm to incredible size. The elves of

Uvaeren constructed libraries of legendary beauty and complexity,

storing information not just in books, but also in intricate magi-

cal constructs, ornate mosaics, and crystal chimes that conveyed

information through music. The elves of the Elven Court made

their rst contact with the dwarves during this time, and after a

few brief skirmishes over logging rights in the Great Forest, the

two races struck an alliance.

The rst disaster was a catastrophe known as the Twelve Nights

of Fire. A falling star struck Arcorar, obliterating Uvaeren and

slaying most of its inhabitants, including the coronal and nearly

all the members of the noble houses. The meteor strike touched

off res that destroyed a vast swath of forest, cutting off Rystall

Wood from the rest of the Cormanthor. Most of the survivors

migrated to Semberholme or Jhyrennstar.

The next major threat to the realms of Arcorar came from

belowground. Hordes of drow and duergar boiled up out of their

Underdark  tunnels  and  struck  the  heart  of  the  Elven  Court.

Because tradition demanded that the elves and their dwarf allies

set aside their weapons here, more than thirty clans of elves and

dwarves lost their leaders in the initial assault. The denizens of

the Underdark conquered the dwarven realm of Sarphil and razed

and despoiled the Elven Court.

While the drow gloated in their caverns, Rystall Wood declared

itself wholly independent of the rest of Arcorar, and the rest of the

elves struggled to nd common purpose. Unity seemed the only

answer, but it remained an elusive goal. Finally, Coronal Oacenth

of Jhyenstarr intoned a prophecy as he lay dying of illness. If we

are to survive as the People, he said, one coronal must vow to

unify the tribes of this great land. One coronal must unify sun and

moon, sky and sea, and tree, root, and earth, that all may achieve

a long-lasting peace and strength in unity.

At the dying coronals behest, the young nobles who sought

to succeed him competed in a number of tests to determine their

worthiness. The high mages who had survived the massacre at

the  Elven  Court  crafted  three  mighty  artifacts  known  as  the

elfblades. Kahvoerm Irithyl drew the Crownblade during a grand

high  magic  ceremony,  thus  becoming  the  rst  Coronal  of  the

United Lands of Arcorar, which he renamed Cormanthor. Upon

the death of Coronal Oacenth, Coronal Kahvoerm declared the

lands of Cormanthor to be a single, united kingdom, and a single,

united people. He then spent fteen years wandering the forest

sylvan elves built few permanent structures.

At  the  heart  of  the  Great  Forest,  the  citizens  of  the  pre-

dominantly sun elf settlement known as Jhyrennstar used powerful

magic to grow the trees to phenomenal heights. To the southwest,

refugees from Aryvandaar founded the nation of Uvaeren.

Other elven settlements at that time included Yrlaancel, a small

city-state near the border of Rystall Wood, and Semberholme, a

refuge for the mothers, children, and elderly of the Elven Court.

From these six lands, the great empire of Cormanthyr was born.

WAR AND PEACE

Throughout  the  millennia  following  the  Crown  Wars,  the  six

realms  of Arcorar  ourished  and  grew,  despite intermittent at-

tacks by goblins, orcs, and drow. Jhyrennstars wizards and druids

nurtured the trees in their realm to incredible size. The elves of

Uvaeren constructed libraries of legendary beauty and complexity,

storing information not just in books, but also in intricate magi-

cal constructs, ornate mosaics, and crystal chimes that conveyed

information through music. The elves of the Elven Court made

their rst contact with the dwarves during this time, and after a

few brief skirmishes over logging rights in the Great Forest, the

two races struck an alliance.

The rst disaster was a catastrophe known as the Twelve Nights

of Fire. A falling star struck Arcorar, obliterating Uvaeren and

slaying most of its inhabitants, including the coronal and nearly

all the members of the noble houses. The meteor strike touched

off res that destroyed a vast swath of forest, cutting off Rystall

Wood from the rest of the Cormanthor. Most of the survivors

migrated to Semberholme or Jhyrennstar.

The next major threat to the realms of Arcorar came from

belowground. Hordes of drow and duergar boiled up out of their

Underdark  tunnels  and  struck  the  heart  of  the  Elven  Court.

Because tradition demanded that the elves and their dwarf allies

set aside their weapons here, more than thirty clans of elves and

dwarves lost their leaders in the initial assault. The denizens of

the Underdark conquered the dwarven realm of Sarphil and razed

and despoiled the Elven Court.

While the drow gloated in their caverns, Rystall Wood declared

itself wholly independent of the rest of Arcorar, and the rest of the

elves struggled to nd common purpose. Unity seemed the only

answer, but it remained an elusive goal. Finally, Coronal Oacenth

of Jhyenstarr intoned a prophecy as he lay dying of illness. If we

are to survive as the People, he said, one coronal must vow to

unify the tribes of this great land. One coronal must unify sun and

moon, sky and sea, and tree, root, and earth, that all may achieve

a long-lasting peace and strength in unity.

At the dying coronals behest, the young nobles who sought

to succeed him competed in a number of tests to determine their

worthiness. The high mages who had survived the massacre at

the  Elven  Court  crafted  three  mighty  artifacts  known  as  the

elfblades. Kahvoerm Irithyl drew the Crownblade during a grand

high  magic  ceremony,  thus  becoming  the  rst  Coronal  of  the

United Lands of Arcorar, which he renamed Cormanthor. Upon

the death of Coronal Oacenth, Coronal Kahvoerm declared the

lands of Cormanthor to be a single, united kingdom, and a single,

united people. He then spent fteen years wandering the forest

before plunging the Crownblade into a hillock revealed to him

in a vision. The magic of the sword summoned forth a tall, white

tower, which he named the Rule Tower. This edi ce became the

center of the great city of Cormanthor.

AGE OF STRIFE

The next three thousand years brought Cormanthyr rapid expan-

sion as well as strife and struggle. Orc raids from Vastar posed a

constant threat, as did the reemergence of the drow of Maerimydra

and the meteoric rise of Netheril. When the Eaerlanni elves began

secretly smuggling gnome slaves out of Netheril, Cormanthyrs

people aided the refugees in their  ight.

The Fair Folk were concerned enough to risk open war with

Netheril by stealing one set of the nether scrolls, but the Netherese

never discovered the identity of the thieves. The Khovanilessa (Trio

Nefarious), three nycalothsMM3 summoned by Netherese arcanists,

rampaged through Cormanthyr during this period as well and were

imprisoned by elven high magic. Rystall Wood fell to orcs and giants,

in part because of the isolationist tendencies of the sylvan elves and

their refusal to ally with the humans of Hlondath and Asram.

THE AGE OF ALLIANCE

Coronal Eltargrim, seeing the losses that the good people of Faern

had  suffered  because  of  their  refusal  to  band  together,  became

determined to prevent a similar fate from befalling Cormanthyr.

Despite strong opposition from the nobility, he summoned the lead-

ers of the human tribes dwelling in the Dalelands to Cormanthor.

After a solid year of discussion and negotiation, the elves and the

humans forged an alliancethe famous Dale Compact. This agree-

ment promised peace and friendship between the humans and the

elves and granted the Dalesmen the right to dwell in the cleared

land around Cormanthor, provided that they cut only deadwood

and bramble from the forest.

The forging of the Dale Compact and the raising of the Standing

Stone occurred on Midwinters Night that same year, marking the

start of the Dalereckoning calendar. Twenty years later, the elven

holiday of Cinnaelos Cor (Day of Corellons Peace) was added to

the Calendar of Harptos as Shieldmeet.

Coronal Eltargrim spent a great deal of time contemplating

the  oath  demanded  of  future  coronals  by  the  dying  Coronal

Oacenthparticularly  the  promise  to  unify  the  tribes  of  this

great land. After due consideration, he came to the controversial

conclusion that Oacenth had intended that phrase to include non-

elves. He began ful llment of this vow by opening Cormanthyrs

borders to a few select non-elf wizards, druids, and settlers. Soon

thereafter, Elminster Aumar, Prince of Athalantar, arrived wearing

the telkiira (see page 155) of the noble House Alastrarra, which

had been granted to him by its dying lord. The return of this item

marked the next step in welcoming other races to Cormanthyr.

Elminsters mission was one of learning, but many elves could

not abide a human wearing a stolen telkiira into the city. Despite

Coronal Eltargrims declaration that the mage was Sha-quessir (an

elf friend), many saw him as a portent of doom. Elminster was

drawn into the politics of the noble houses, many of which sought

a pawn to block Eltargrims plan for the uni cation of the races.

Thanks  to  the  young  mages  cleverness  and  Mystras  guidance,

however, their plans to stop the integration of Cormanthyr failed.

When the elven high mage Mythanthor raised a mythal over the

city, Eltargrim renamed the city Myth Drannor and opened it to

all the good folk of Faern. A few elf nobles chose to leave the city

rather than share it with lesser races, but many more remained,

eager to see the result of Eltargrims grand experiment.

THE GLORY OF MYTH DRANNOR

In the centuries the followed, Myth Drannors defenders overcame

racial  tensions,  orc  attacks,  and  a  resurgent  Cult  of  Moander.

Demron created his six baneblades during this period, and the

sun  elf  Saeval  Ammath  returned  from  an  expedition  into  the

western  mountains  bearing  a  red  dragon  egg.  The  subsequent

hatching of Garnetallisar and his growth into an honorable being

was a wonderful breakthrough, but his presence would eventually

lead to ful llment of the conditions needed to release the Trio

Nefarious. Josidiah Starym descended into the Underdark to recover

the Warblade and prove his worth to the coronal, whose heir he

wished to marry.

THE DECLINE

By the time Coronal Eltargrim died, Cormanthyr had reached the

apex of its power and glory. Sister-cities were established throughout

the forest of Cormanthor and even in distant locales elsewhere in

Faern. Eltargrim passed on to Arvandor by a conscious act of will

at the Midsummer Festival, feeling that at long last his work was

done. The dream of Cormanthyr was a reality, and all the tribes

of the Great Forest lived and worked in harmony. But before the

required  mourning  period  had  passed,  Eltargrims  heir,  Aravae

Irithyl, was murdered. The culprit was Illitrin Starym, who feared

that Aravaes beloved would return and displace him as head of

House Starym. Illitrins treachery was never discovered.

After  Aravaes  murder,  the  noble  houses  pushed  to  end  the

Mourning Days and choose a successor immediately. But the moon

elf wizard known as the Srinshee, now the de facto regent of Cor-

manthyr, held  rm to Aravaes wishes, primarily because preparing

the high magic necessary for the succession ceremony would take

at least the remaining year and a half of the Mourning Days.

For the  rst time in Cormanthyrs history, the succession was

open to any noble or commoner. Finally, when the time arrived

for the Claiming Ceremony, no sun elf survived the touch of the

Crownblade. When the other races demanded their chances to try

the sword, many of the sun elf houses resorted to assassinations and

open violence against any they perceived as potential candidates.

Coronal Oacenths dream crumbled along with the Rule Tower,

which was shattered by elven battle-magic.

Finally, at dusk on the sixth day after Midsummer, the Srinshee

spoke to all the people of Myth Drannor. In a voice heavy with

grief, she told the people of Cormanthyr that they had forgotten the

dream of Coronal Oacenth and the reality that Coronal Eltargrim

had made of it. She then announced her intent to draw the Crown-

blade herself and, to the amazement of many, she succeeded. The

sun elves who had fought so bitterly to keep the of ce of coronal

in the hands of their own kin reacted violently to her success and

launched potent magical attacks at her, which failed utterly.

Finally, with tears of grief for the divisions that had sundered

Cormanthyr, the Srinshee announced that she would not be coro-

Forest were truly united and the dream of Cormanthyr realized in

the hearts of all its citizens. As her last acts in Myth Drannor, the

Srinshee rebuilt the Rule Tower and, through an impressive display

of high magic, created an even more massive Diamond Tower to

serve as the symbol of a uni ed Cormanthyr. After urging her

people one last time to keep working toward a truly uni ed land

of elves and non-elves and promising to return when that hope was

realized, the Srinshee vanished from the face of Faern

along with the Crownblade and the Diamond Tower.

None of them have

been seen since.

THE FALL

With  the  loss  of

Coronal  Eltargrim,

Aravae  Irithyl,  the

Srinshee,  and  the

Crownblade, the true

fall of Myth Drannor

began. A representa-

tive body called the

Council  of  Twelve

assumed  leadership

of  Cormanthyr,  but

its  members  were

prone  to  in ghting

and petty politicking.

Cormanthyr  rapidly

became  more  like  a

loosely allied confed-

eration of city-states

than  a  single,  cohe-

sive nation. To further compound the citys troubles, the colonial

expansion that had spawned cities such as Silverymoon began to

draw many of the best and brightest mages and craft-workers away

from Myth Drannor, causing a gradual stagnation of the art and

magic that had always been its hallmarks.

Perhaps most signi cantly, the interracial respect and friend-

ship for which Myth Drannor had been justly famous began to

erode shortly after the coronals death. Several of the citys noble

houses migrated to purely elven enclaves, and humans and dwarves

purchased their vacant villas. This trend caused other elf clans to

fear that non-elves were grabbing up all the land in Myth Drannor,

so they too departed. Thus, the exodus of the elves soon created a

domino effect that weakened the City of Song considerably.

In the decades following the tragic Claiming Ceremony, the

City of Song (and indeed, all Cormanthyr) split into numerous

political factions, forming an intricate and deadly web of intrigue

that rivaled any drow court. The noble houses began to vie with one

another for power and in uence. Without the Srinshees guidance,

the court mages fragmented to pursue separate agendas. Several

of the more senior mages split off to form a group called the

Eternal Srinnala, which was dedicated to pursuing the wishes the

Srinshee had expressed before she vanished. The commerce guilds

also began to squabble among themselves. Surprisingly, the citys

priests came together as one. Whether they venerated Corellon,

Moradin, Yondalla, Garl Glittergold, or one of the countless human

deities, the clerics shepherded the city as best they could through

the troubled years.

The Akh Velahr was built up heavily, and its soldiers were trained

to near perfection in anticipation of a civil war between the fractious

power groups within the city. That war never occurred, but the threat

of it left the army well prepared for the Army of Darkness.

THE WEEPING WAR

Despite  all  its  internal  strife,  Myth  Drannor  might  even-

tually  have  found

peace again had the

Trio  Nefarious  not

returned.  The  three

nycalothsAulmpi-

ter,  Gaulguth,  and

Malimshaerhad

brooded  in  their

mystical  prison  for

nearly  two  millen-

nia,  plotting  their

revenge.  Finally,

the  ight of the red

dragon  Garnet  over

the  throne  of  the

coronal  ful lled  a

condition  of  their

release,  and  a  gnoll

shaman  of

the

Moonsea  was  able

to  summon  them

forth.  As  soon  as

they were freed, the

three  ends put their plans into motion. Ruthlessly establishing

themselves as the leaders of dozens of barbaric humanoid tribes,

they used a combination of magic, brute force, and sheer terror to

organize the disparate tribes of orcs, goblins, ogres, bugbears, and

other monsters into a single cohesive army, which the elves would

later dub the Army of Darkness.

While the Trio Nefarious was assembling its army, the people

of Cormanthyr were busy dealing with other dangers. After many

centuries of relative inactivity, the drow had gone on the warpath

once again and retaken the Twisted Tower from the worshipers

of Eilistraee. Over the next several years, they harried the north-

western reaches of Cormanthyr and even struck into Cormyr and

the Dalelands occasionally. Although it was never clear whether

the drow had predicted or known about the Army of Darkness,

they were in an excellent position to exploit the coming war for

their own bene t.

The Weeping War, as the elves called the campaign that led to

the fall of Myth Drannor, began in the Year of Despairing Elves

(711 DR). In its opening gambit, called the Northern Massacres,

the Army of Darkness invaded Cormanthyrs northern reaches.

A reversal of fortune occurred over the next two years, when the

forces of Cormanthyr managed to slay two of the nycaloths that

commanded the Army of Darkness and reclaim the Elven Court.

But while these valiant acts bought the citizens of Myth Drannor

time to evacuate the city, the beleaguered forces of the Akh Velahr

erode shortly after the coronals death. Several of the citys noble

houses migrated to purely elven enclaves, and humans and dwarves

purchased their vacant villas. This trend caused other elf clans to

fear that non-elves were grabbing up all the land in Myth Drannor,

so they too departed. Thus, the exodus of the elves soon created a

domino effect that weakened the City of Song considerably.

In the decades following the tragic Claiming Ceremony, the

City of Song (and indeed, all Cormanthyr) split into numerous

political factions, forming an intricate and deadly web of intrigue

that rivaled any drow court. The noble houses began to vie with one

another for power and in uence. Without the Srinshees guidance,

the court mages fragmented to pursue separate agendas. Several

of the more senior mages split off to form a group called the

Eternal Srinnala, which was dedicated to pursuing the wishes the

Srinshee had expressed before she vanished. The commerce guilds

also began to squabble among themselves. Surprisingly, the citys

priests came together as one. Whether they venerated Corellon,

Moradin, Yondalla, Garl Glittergold, or one of the countless human

deities, the clerics shepherded the city as best they could through

the troubled years.

The Akh Velahr was built up heavily, and its soldiers were trained

to near perfection in anticipation of a civil war between the fractious

power groups within the city. That war never occurred, but the threat

of it left the army well prepared for the Army of Darkness.

THE WEEPING WAR

Despite  all  its  internal  strife,  Myth  Drannor  might  even-

tually  have  found

peace again had the

Trio  Nefarious  not

returned.  The  three

nycalothsAulmpi-

ter,  Gaulguth,  and

Malimshaerhad

brooded  in  their

mystical  prison  for

nearly  two  millen-

nia,  plotting  their

revenge.  Finally,

the  ight of the red

dragon  Garnet  over

the  throne  of  the

coronal  ful lled  a

condition  of  their

release,  and  a  gnoll

shaman  of

the

Moonsea  was  able

to  summon  them

forth.  As  soon  as

they were freed, the

three  ends put their plans into motion. Ruthlessly establishing

themselves as the leaders of dozens of barbaric humanoid tribes,

they used a combination of magic, brute force, and sheer terror to

organize the disparate tribes of orcs, goblins, ogres, bugbears, and

other monsters into a single cohesive army, which the elves would

later dub the Army of Darkness.

While the Trio Nefarious was assembling its army, the people

of Cormanthyr were busy dealing with other dangers. After many

centuries of relative inactivity, the drow had gone on the warpath

once again and retaken the Twisted Tower from the worshipers

of Eilistraee. Over the next several years, they harried the north-

western reaches of Cormanthyr and even struck into Cormyr and

the Dalelands occasionally. Although it was never clear whether

the drow had predicted or known about the Army of Darkness,

they were in an excellent position to exploit the coming war for

their own bene t.

The Weeping War, as the elves called the campaign that led to

the fall of Myth Drannor, began in the Year of Despairing Elves

(711 DR). In its opening gambit, called the Northern Massacres,

the Army of Darkness invaded Cormanthyrs northern reaches.

A reversal of fortune occurred over the next two years, when the

forces of Cormanthyr managed to slay two of the nycaloths that

commanded the Army of Darkness and reclaim the Elven Court.

But while these valiant acts bought the citizens of Myth Drannor

time to evacuate the city, the beleaguered forces of the Akh Velahr

THE DREAM OF CORMANTHYR

THE DREAM OF CORMANTHYR

Important

Sites

At its height, the empire of

Cormanthyr stretched from

the  Stormhorns  and  the

Desertsmouth  Mountains

to the Dragon Reach, and

from the Moonsea in the

north to the Sea of Fallen

Stars. Although much of

its land was unsettled wil-

derness, the city of Myth

Drannor was by no means

its only important site.

Myth Drannor

Called the City of Song, the City of Spells, the City of Brother-

hood, and a thousand other fanciful names, the fabled city of Myth

Drannor was the epitome of beauty. Its graceful, slender towers

were built of wood and stone, and arcane towers in the shapes of

giant animals, cresting waves, and even more exotic images dotted

the city. The few buildings that were actually grown using elven

rituals had an organic beauty unmatched in Faern.

Since its fall, Myth Drannor has become more famous as a

deadly dungeon than as a place of beauty and learning. The citys

catacombs are home to several wyrms, plus devils summoned by

the Church of Bane, a few phaerimms that survived the Shadovar

hunting parties, cabals of alhoons, and the Cult of the Dark Naga.

Even the baelnorns that protect a few sites within the ruins assume

that  any  interloper  is  a  grave-robbing  de ler.  The  most  deadly

danger,  however,  often  comes  from  other  adventuring  groups.

Many raiders travel to Myth Drannor every year seeking magic

and vast riches, and few of them are scrupulous enough to leave

another band to its own devices.

Semberholme

Semberholme was founded on the shores of Lake Sember as a

sanctuary and refuge for the women, children, and in rm imme-

diately after the Descent of the Drow. The site was chosen partly

because the forest here was thick enough to obstruct the movements

of enemies both on the ground and in the air, but an even more

important consideration was the network of limestone caves beneath

the entire area. These caverns were both large and numerous, with

entrances that were nearly impossible to  nd. Whenever an enemy

threatened Semberholme, entire communities could simply vanish

into these caves in an eyeblink and outlast their attackers.

Although Semberholme was also abandoned during the Retreat,

a few of the surrounding villages still exist, and a small number of

Fair Folk dwell in Deepingdale. So far, the region has been mostly

free of harassment from the Cormanthor drow, but once the drow

properly establish a foothold in the region, these settlements may

become targets.

Vale of Lost Voices

This holy burial site was created on the spot where the true Venom

ambushed and slew those who had killed his mate. The few members

of the sylvan elf clan Audark who survived this massacre became

baelnorns so that they could watch over and protect their fallen

kinfolk. Over the centuries, other elves also began to use the Vale

as a burial site for honored warriors.

The Vale of Lost Voices remains a sacred place to this day,

despite the fact that Rauthauvyrs Road cuts straight through it.

Sun elf mausoleums of stone and gold stand beside subtle moon

elf tombs and nearly invisible sylvan elf graves. Travelers other

than elves are advised to stay on the road, lest they draw the wrath

of the baelnorn guardians. Even elf pilgrims come alone, never

many of the nobles still

blamed  non-elves  for

the fall of the empire,

humans,  dwarves,  and

members of other races

were  no  longer  welcome  in

Cormanthyr. A trading village

called  Elventree  was  estab-

commerce,  but  Coronal

Oacenths  dream  of  unity

was over. After centuries of decline, the

elders of the Elven Court began the Retreat,

leaving Cormanthor a virtually uninhabited

forest within three decades.

Today, surface-dwelling drowlargely worshipers of Vhaeraun

and other drow deities exiled by the priestesses of Lolthhave

of the Elven Court.

became apparent, the elves

mounted  a  campaign  to

reclaim the Elven Court.

After the Weeping War,

the  Elven  Court  became

the  de  facto  center  of

and abandoned it once again, leaving it open

arrived  Cormanthor  drow  have  claimed  much  of  its  area,  but

THE DREAM OF CORMANTHYR

in groups, because the Vale of Lost Voices is considered a place

of solitude and quiet reection. Not surprisingly, the Cormanthor

drow have given the place a wide berth.

Legacies of

Cormanthyr

Cormanthyrs demise left behind many legacies. Some are widely

known, and others are secrets even to the most learned sages of

Faern. The seeds of adventure are abundant in the ruins of Myth

Drannor and the Elven Court, and even the largely benevolent

elves buried secrets that are best left forgotten.

Adventure Seeds

Myth Drannor is quite possibly the single biggest adventure site in

Faern. An enormous, ruined city lled with deadly traps, deadlier

monsters, and vast piles of treasure to be won is like a beacon

to  adventurers  everywhere.  Adventures  centered  on  reclaiming

past glories or preventing ancient evils from breaking free of the

protective magic that has held them in check make for exciting

games that invoke the feel of Cormanthyr.

RETURN OF THE ELFBLADES

A young elf warrior has recently surfaced in Evereska wielding a

sword that he claims is the Warbladeone of the fabled lost elf-

blades of Cormanthyr. The blade seems to display powers consistent

The Mines of Tethyamar

In  the  Year  of  Adamantine  Ore  (149  DR),  shield  dwarf

prospectors discovered rich veins of adamantine and iron in

the Tethyamar caverns beneath the northwestern slopes of the

Teshan Mountains (now the Desertsmouth Mountains), high

above the elds of Hlondath. The dwarves sent word back to

the Stout Folk of fallen Oghrann, who had been gradually

migrating north and east along the Storm Horns for centuries,

harried by the goblin worg-riders of Hlundadim. Upon hearing

of these rich deposits, numerous clans decided to migrate north

and settle the caverns of Tethyamar.

Roryn, blood of Thordbard, of the Iron House of Oghrann

founded the kingdom of Tethyamar in the Year of Depths Un-

known (145 DR). The Stout Folk constructed a subterranean

city at the heart of the mines and built up a rich trade with

the  surrounding  realms  of  Asram,  Cormanthyr,  Hlondath,

the  Cloudlands  of  Avaeraether,  and  Anuria  (whose  famed

weaponsmiths forged most of their swords from Tethyamaran

steel). For two generations the Stout Folk battled orcs, ogres,

and hobgoblins, slowly carving out their kingdom with bloodied

axes and sharpened pickaxes.

Tethyamar  fell  at  least  once  during  this  period.  In  the

Year of Hostile Hails (88 DR), it was overrun by orcs of the

Dragonspine Mountains, who had also conquered Swordcrag, a

mining village of Tarkhaldale. Although the dwarves reclaimed

their mines within two years, Tarkhaldale collapsed in the Year

of Dashed Dreams (87 DR). In the wake of this near-defeat,

the richest mining clans of Tethyamar funded the construc-

tion of the Hlundite fortress-city of Rulvadar to defend the

kingdom against the depredations of the orcs.

Despite its early trials, Tethyamar prospered in the centuries

that followed. The dwarves traded ore and forged goods with the

folk of Cormyr, Myth Drannor, Northkeep, Teshar, Hlontar,

and Merrydale. The founding of Flostrens Hold at the mouth

of the River Tesh in the Year of Stagnant Water (747 DR)

opened new markets for the Stout Folk, but that event also

planted the seeds of Tethyamars nal fall.

After a consortium of Sembian merchants known as the

Twelve  Lords  purchased  the  hold  the  following  year,  large

volumes of Tethyamaran ore and wares destined for southern

markets began to ow down the River Tesh. In the Year of

Strife (753 DR), Flostrens Hold was renamed Zhentil Keep after

Zhentar the wizard, who had died defending the community.

Over time, the Lords of Zhentil Keep came to covet such

wealth  for  their  own.  Backed  by  a  brotherhood  of  wizards

known as the Zhentarim, they established a series of mines in

the Dragonspine Mountains to the north, but the production

from these mines never came close to that of Tethyamars. As

frustrations rose in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim sent troops to

skirmish with Tethyamaran patrols along the banks of the River

Tesh, hoping to extract trade concessions from the dwarves.

In  the  Year  of  Spreading  Spring  (1038  DR),  the  sands

of Anauroch began to spread southward once again. In the

decades that followed, the humanoids of the Goblin Marches

grew increasingly short of resources and banded together in

hopes of conquering the rich, human-held territories to the

west and east. In the Year of Slaughter (1090 DR), a great

host of goblins marched west and encountered a vast alliance

of human armies. The resulting epic conict was later dubbed

the Battle of Bones. A smaller host of goblins, orcs, ogres, and

giants marched east toward the sparsely populated northern

Dalelands and the rich cities of the Moonsea. Although popular

legends claim that the wizard Ashaba manifested as a great

wall of water and turned aside the invaders, the truth is far

with those recorded for the Warblade, but several wizards who

had questioned the swords nature have been murdered. A cloud

of suspicion has fallen on the young warrior, who still protests his

innocence. The PCs must nd a way to test the veracity of his

claims before mob justice threatens an elf who might be the true

heir of the Arms-Major of Cormanthyr.

Buried Secrets

Even the elves have skeletons in their closets. Despite the wonders

and glories of Cormanthyr, the elves would rather that certain

remnants of the empire were forgotten and left to lie in peace.

THE ELFBLADES

The elfblades are without a doubt the greatest treasures of Corman-

thyr. These three powerful artifacts not only granted their wielders

considerable power, but also selected the ruler of Cormanthyr, the

arms-major, and the spell-major. Any humanoid (not necessarily

an elf) who could successfully draw one of the three blades from

its scabbard was deemed worthy for the ofce with which it was

associated, but all three imposed disastrous consequences on un-

worthy candidates who attempted to draw them. The Crownblade,

for example, consumed the rejected candidate utterly in a gout of

arcane re.

Of  all  the  relics  of  Cormanthyr,  the  elfblades  are  the  ones

that the elves would most dearly love to regain. The bearer of the

Warblade could muster an army with ease, while the possessor of

the Artblade could gain access to any magical library in Faern as

an honored guest. But the return of any of these weapons is unlikely

in the extreme. Sages correctly suspect that the Crownblade waits

with the Srinshee in Arvandor for the coming of a coronal who

can reforge Cormanthyr and create the unity of which Coronals

Oacenth and Eltargrim once dreamed. The Warblade lies in the

Underdark, hidden in a secret vault beneath the temple to Lolth

in the ruins of Maerimydra. The Artblade vanished along with

the last spell-major, Josidiah Starym, at the Battle of Stars Shining

near the end of the Weeping War.

upon the humanoid shamans to march their forces north into

the Desertsmouth Mountains and lay siege to the rich mines

of Tethyamar.

The Stout Folk held out for fourteen years, only to fall in

the Year of the Dark Dawn (1104 DR) to a legion of blood-

thirsty barghests and demons summoned by the circle magic

of orc adepts backed by an archmage who claimed to be Great

Hulundadim reborn. Although the Zhentarim had hoped to

rule the mines of Tethyamar after defeating the Stout Folk,

the arrival of the barghest pack made such  endeavors nigh

impossible. The barghests progenytieings of mixed goblin,

orc, and barghest blood known as worghestsclaimed dominion

and have ruled the ever-feuding tribes of Tethyamar without

interruption ever since.

In the Year of the Arch (1353 DR), Randal Morn slew

Malyk, the Zhent puppet in Daggerdale, freeing much of the

dale from the Zhentarims yoke. By the following year, emis-

saries of Manshoon had forged an alliance with the humanoid

rulers of Tethyamar with the express purpose of overrunning

Daggerdale from the west. Fate intervened in the Year of the

Harp (1355 DR), when Manshoon saw an opening to seize the

Citadel of the Raven, which was manned by the allied cities of

the Moonsea. At Manshoons behest, the armies of Tethyamar,

backed by hosts of Zhentarim-summoned devils, marched on

the ancient fortress. When the forces of the citadel sallied forth

against the approaching horde, the Zhentarim treacherously

slew the remaining defenders and claimed the fortress for their

own.  After  routing  the  suddenly  exposed  human  army,  the

Tethyamaran forces returned home, enriched by Zhent gold

and plunder seized from the eld of battle.

Today,  many  of  Tethyamars  Stout  Folk  still  wander

rootless, dreaming of the day when they can take back their

home. From time to time, some return to reclaim the ranges

and caverns that their people once held, but such expeditions

invariably end in defeat. The last one, mounted in the Year of

the Harp (1355 DR) during the attack on the Citadel of the

Raven, came closest to succeeding, since most of Tethyamars

warriors were away at the time. Though the expedition ended

in failure after the unexpectedly quick return of the humanoid

army,  it  did  have  one  lucky,  unintended  consequence.  The

rulers of Tethyamar have since refused to honor their original

pledge  to  the  Zhentarim  to  overrun  Daggerdale,  correctly

fearing that the Stout Folk have been awaiting just such an

opportunity to reclaim their ancestral halls. This situation

has in turn prompted the Zhentarim to recall most of the

magelings  they  had  placed  at  the  disposal  of  Tethyamars

worghest rulers, thus rendering the alliance largely toothless

and leaving Daggerdale unbowed.

Another expedition ended in failure in the Year of the Wave

(1364 DR), when Borlin, blood of Ghellin, of the Iron House

mustered a small army of Stout Folk and marched north to

storm the mines. The Mithral Legion successfully stormed one

of the gates of Tethyamar, only to run afoul of an orc-crafted

portal that deposited them in the depths of the mines. One

by one the dwarves died while battling their way back to the

surface. The last to fall was Borlin himself, who died within

sight of the great doors of Tethyamar.

Ghellin, the last king of Tethyamar, died of old age in the

Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), still dreaming of retaking his

lost realm. Leadership of the Iron House passed to his twin

sons, Tasster and Teszter, born of the Thunder Blessing, who

had inherited their fathers dream of reclaiming Tethyamar.

The mines of Tethyamar still exist, and they remain in

excellent repair except for temples to Moradin and other such

structures that have been deliberately despoiled. If the monsters

that lair in their tunnels could be routed, Tethyamar could

easily become an operating mine and stronghold again within

a few years.

THE DREAM OF CORMANTHYR

THE DREAM OF CORMANTHYR

in groups, because the Vale of Lost Voices is considered a place

of solitude and quiet reection. Not surprisingly, the Cormanthor

drow have given the place a wide berth.

Legacies of

Cormanthyr

Cormanthyrs demise left behind many legacies. Some are widely

known, and others are secrets even to the most learned sages of

Faern. The seeds of adventure are abundant in the ruins of Myth

Drannor and the Elven Court, and even the largely benevolent

elves buried secrets that are best left forgotten.

Adventure Seeds

Myth Drannor is quite possibly the single biggest adventure site in

Faern. An enormous, ruined city lled with deadly traps, deadlier

monsters, and vast piles of treasure to be won is like a beacon

to  adventurers  everywhere.  Adventures  centered  on  reclaiming

past glories or preventing ancient evils from breaking free of the

protective magic that has held them in check make for exciting

games that invoke the feel of Cormanthyr.

GLORIOUS RECLAMATION

Incensed by the blasphemous presence of drow in the Elven Court,

three elvesa bladesingerRac, a cleric of Corellon, and a ranger of

Shevarashhave begun traveling from one settlement to another,

gathering followers to cleanse the ancient site of its dark elf menace.

Most  of  these  followers  are  not  seasoned  warriorsthey  are

idealistic young recruits entirely unsuited to facing a drow raiding

party. The PCs must determine the true intentions of these three

crusaders and decide what, if anything, to do about the situation.

RETURN OF THE ELFBLADES

A young elf warrior has recently surfaced in Evereska wielding a

sword that he claims is the Warbladeone of the fabled lost elf-

blades of Cormanthyr. The blade seems to display powers consistent

The Mines of Tethyamar

In  the  Year  of  Adamantine  Ore  (149  DR),  shield  dwarf

prospectors discovered rich veins of adamantine and iron in

the Tethyamar caverns beneath the northwestern slopes of the

Teshan Mountains (now the Desertsmouth Mountains), high

above the elds of Hlondath. The dwarves sent word back to

the Stout Folk of fallen Oghrann, who had been gradually

migrating north and east along the Storm Horns for centuries,

harried by the goblin worg-riders of Hlundadim. Upon hearing

of these rich deposits, numerous clans decided to migrate north

and settle the caverns of Tethyamar.

Roryn, blood of Thordbard, of the Iron House of Oghrann

founded the kingdom of Tethyamar in the Year of Depths Un-

known (145 DR). The Stout Folk constructed a subterranean

city at the heart of the mines and built up a rich trade with

the  surrounding  realms  of  Asram,  Cormanthyr,  Hlondath,

the  Cloudlands  of  Avaeraether,  and  Anuria  (whose  famed

weaponsmiths forged most of their swords from Tethyamaran

steel). For two generations the Stout Folk battled orcs, ogres,

and hobgoblins, slowly carving out their kingdom with bloodied

axes and sharpened pickaxes.

Tethyamar  fell  at  least  once  during  this  period.  In  the

Year of Hostile Hails (88 DR), it was overrun by orcs of the

Dragonspine Mountains, who had also conquered Swordcrag, a

mining village of Tarkhaldale. Although the dwarves reclaimed

their mines within two years, Tarkhaldale collapsed in the Year

of Dashed Dreams (87 DR). In the wake of this near-defeat,

the richest mining clans of Tethyamar funded the construc-

tion of the Hlundite fortress-city of Rulvadar to defend the

kingdom against the depredations of the orcs.

Despite its early trials, Tethyamar prospered in the centuries

that followed. The dwarves traded ore and forged goods with the

folk of Cormyr, Myth Drannor, Northkeep, Teshar, Hlontar,

and Merrydale. The founding of Flostrens Hold at the mouth

of the River Tesh in the Year of Stagnant Water (747 DR)

opened new markets for the Stout Folk, but that event also

planted the seeds of Tethyamars nal fall.

After a consortium of Sembian merchants known as the

Twelve  Lords  purchased  the  hold  the  following  year,  large

volumes of Tethyamaran ore and wares destined for southern

markets began to ow down the River Tesh. In the Year of

Strife (753 DR), Flostrens Hold was renamed Zhentil Keep after

Zhentar the wizard, who had died defending the community.

Over time, the Lords of Zhentil Keep came to covet such

wealth  for  their  own.  Backed  by  a  brotherhood  of  wizards

known as the Zhentarim, they established a series of mines in

the Dragonspine Mountains to the north, but the production

from these mines never came close to that of Tethyamars. As

frustrations rose in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim sent troops to

skirmish with Tethyamaran patrols along the banks of the River

Tesh, hoping to extract trade concessions from the dwarves.

In  the  Year  of  Spreading  Spring  (1038  DR),  the  sands

of Anauroch began to spread southward once again. In the

decades that followed, the humanoids of the Goblin Marches

grew increasingly short of resources and banded together in

hopes of conquering the rich, human-held territories to the

west and east. In the Year of Slaughter (1090 DR), a great

host of goblins marched west and encountered a vast alliance

of human armies. The resulting epic conict was later dubbed

the Battle of Bones. A smaller host of goblins, orcs, ogres, and

giants marched east toward the sparsely populated northern

Dalelands and the rich cities of the Moonsea. Although popular

legends claim that the wizard Ashaba manifested as a great

wall of water and turned aside the invaders, the truth is far

more mundane. In secret negotiations, the Zhentarim prevailed

with those recorded for the Warblade, but several wizards who

had questioned the swords nature have been murdered. A cloud

of suspicion has fallen on the young warrior, who still protests his

innocence. The PCs must nd a way to test the veracity of his

claims before mob justice threatens an elf who might be the true

heir of the Arms-Major of Cormanthyr.

the

Old North

For as many ages as elves, dwarves, and humans have

dwelled  on  Faern,  the  North  has  been  a  rich  but

forbidding land of cold, inhospitable terrain. Its dark

and dangerous woods hide tribes of trolls, goblins, and hobgoblins

inured  to  the  cold.  Orcs  and  giants  struggle  to  survive  in  its

frozen mountain ranges, and nomadic human barbarians prowl

its frigid hills and plains, raiding towns for food and gold. A few

civilized settlements occupy defensible positions by the sea, on

hilltops, or along river valleys. Those who pass quietly through

the ruins of the innumerable kingdoms that have risen and fallen

here can almost hear the voices of lost civilizations whispering

their tales of glory and anguish.

The long history of the North begins with the ancient elven

realm of Illefarn and its successorsArdeep, Iliyanbruen, and

Rilitharand the shield dwarf kingdoms of Besilmer, Dardath,

Gharraghaur, Haunghdannar, and Melairbode. The realms that

succeeded these were shaped by four different waves of human

migration. The seafaring Northmen settled Ruathym, Old Illusk,

the other isles of the Trackless Sea, the northern Sword Coast,

and the lower Delimbiyr valley, in roughly that order. Netherese

refugees ed west, seeking new lands beyond the reach of the

phaerimms  and  the  hated  archwizards.  In  like  manner,  the

Tethyrian  tribes  migrated  northward,  eeing  the  atrocities  of

Calimshan and the Shoon Dynasty. Finally, Chondathan traders

spread language, commerce, and knowledge from the Heartlands

into  the  Savage  Frontier.  Out  of  this  mixture  emerged  such

realms as Athalantar, Delimbiyran, Elembar, Illusk, Phalorm,

Stornanter, Tavaray, Uthtower, and Yarlith, all of which have

risen and fallen in turn, leaving only the independent towns and

cities that dot the North today.

History

For the most part, the history of the North chronicles the halting

spread of humankind in the face of relentless humanoid hordes

and  rampaging  wyrms.  When  the  Fair  Folk  retreated  from

Illefarn, humans claimed their lands  and forged kingdoms of

their own. From these evolved great city-states such as Waterdeep,

Neverwinter, and Luskan.

For as many ages as elves, dwarves, and humans have

dwelled  on  Faern,  the  North  has  been  a  rich  but

forbidding land of cold, inhospitable terrain. Its dark

and dangerous woods hide tribes of trolls, goblins, and hobgoblins

inured  to  the  cold.  Orcs  and  giants  struggle  to  survive  in  its

frozen mountain ranges, and nomadic human barbarians prowl

its frigid hills and plains, raiding towns for food and gold. A few

civilized settlements occupy defensible positions by the sea, on

hilltops, or along river valleys. Those who pass quietly through

the ruins of the innumerable kingdoms that have risen and fallen

here can almost hear the voices of lost civilizations whispering

their tales of glory and anguish.

The long history of the North begins with the ancient elven

realm of Illefarn and its successorsArdeep, Iliyanbruen, and

Rilitharand the shield dwarf kingdoms of Besilmer, Dardath,

Gharraghaur, Haunghdannar, and Melairbode. The realms that

succeeded these were shaped by four different waves of human

migration. The seafaring Northmen settled Ruathym, Old Illusk,

the other isles of the Trackless Sea, the northern Sword Coast,

and the lower Delimbiyr valley, in roughly that order. Netherese

refugees ed west, seeking new lands beyond the reach of the

phaerimms  and  the  hated  archwizards.  In  like  manner,  the

Tethyrian  tribes  migrated  northward,  eeing  the  atrocities  of

Calimshan and the Shoon Dynasty. Finally, Chondathan traders

spread language, commerce, and knowledge from the Heartlands

into  the  Savage  Frontier.  Out  of  this  mixture  emerged  such

realms as Athalantar, Delimbiyran, Elembar, Illusk, Phalorm,

Stornanter, Tavaray, Uthtower, and Yarlith, all of which have

risen and fallen in turn, leaving only the independent towns and

cities that dot the North today.

History

For the most part, the history of the North chronicles the halting

spread of humankind in the face of relentless humanoid hordes

and  rampaging  wyrms.  When  the  Fair  Folk  retreated  from

Illefarn, humans claimed their lands  and forged kingdoms of

their own. From these evolved great city-states such as Waterdeep,

Neverwinter, and Luskan.

THE OLD NORTH

1358

Alliance expels Luskans forces from Ruathym by apply-

ing combined diplomatic and military pressure. Luskan

and the allied island realms of the Trackless Sea join

to form the Captains Confederation. The Ebondeath

Sect in the Mere of Dead Men collapses when Myrkul

is destroyed.

Keepers of the Past

Much of the Norths written history has been destroyed in war

or burnt in res set by plundering orcs. Much of the informa-

tion in the libraries of recordkeepers and loremasters today is

secondhand knowledge, since few documents written by historians

of the earlier kingdoms still exist. This scarcity of rsthand ac-

counts means that any original documents found by adventurers

are highly prized indeed.

THE BIRTHRIGHT MERCHANT

The Birthright Merchant is an entrepreneurial, outspoken woman

known  to  her  customers  simply  as  Kayt  (NG  female  aasimar

diviner 9). Kayt operates her business out of Mirabar, employ-

ing a team of historically minded spellcasters who are dedicated

to unearthing the secrets of the past. She charges her diviners

and investigative scouts to identify recovered heirlooms, trace

bloodlines, ascertain land rights, and track down heirs. Through

their efforts, they have been able to resolve many discrepancies

and  reunite  countless  heirs  with  lost  lands  and  property.  The

aasimar also employs a conjurer who can summon the outsider

and elemental ancestors of her planetouched clients from their

home  planes.  Kayts  fees  are  high,  but  so  are  the  stakesher

clients can learn whether they come from royalty or are related

to heroes of olden days.

THE HERALDS HOLDFAST

About 30 miles west of Silverymoon, along the River Rauvin, is

an ancient, spellguarded citadel called the Heralds Holdfast. This

squat, moss-covered tower of gray stone is one of ve mysterious

ofces  operated  by  the  Heralds.  Inside  the  place  is  a  massive

library of heraldry in which the lineage of prominent humans,

elves,  dwarves,  halings,  gnomes,  giants,  and  even  orcs  and

goblinkind has been recorded for the past eight hundred years. Its

most notable section is the Chamber of Man, a library in which

the histories of dozens of human kingdoms are recorded.

Old  Night  Shalara  Swordshigh  (CG  female  human  bard

7/ranger 4) is currently in charge of the Holdfast. Her assistant,

Ollarent Hillgreen (LG male haling diviner 7/loremaster 2) is

the senior sage and keeper of the Library of Man. The great sage

protects his library the way a dragon guards its hoard, refusing to

part with secrets for any amount of coin. Only at the direction

of Shalara does Ollorinth trade information, and then only in

return for a much-desired relic or historic tome.

Songs and Stories

The epic tales of the old North are lled with warring dragons,

orc invasions, heroic defenders, and legends of fantastic treasures.

The sheer volume of tales involving the Norths heroes, villains,

and kingdoms helps to explain why bards are more numerous here

than nearly anywhere else in Faern.

MINTIPER MOONSILVER

Ballads  and  poems  composed  by  the  legendary  bard  Mintiper

Moonsilver (CN moon half-elf male ghter 5/rogue 5/bard 9)

about his adventures can be enjoyed anywhere from Luskan to

Myratma. The Lonely Harpist is still active in Faern and can

be heard singing in drinking halls and taverns along the entire

length  of  the  Sword  Coast.  His  collected  works  are  kept  in  a

chapbook in the Vault of the Sages in Silverymoon. This small

tome is a compilation of Mintipers odes, poems, and tales, many

of  which  contain  references  to lost  ruins  and  magic  treasures

scattered across western Faern.

THE REGHED SAGA

The barbaric Reghedmen of Icewind Dale, descended from ancient

Illuskans, perform the history of their proud people as an eerie

chant and dance known as the Reghed Saga. Tribal leaders claim

that this saga is the truth as told by their forefathers since the

rst warrior. The great majority of the Reghed Saga speaks of

tribal  wars  and  dead  heroes,  but  the  oldest  parts  describe  the

founding of Old Illusk, its great kings, and how its own civilized

arrogance brought it to an end. Because custom dictates that only

tribal leaders can perform the saga and only members of the tribe

can witness it, few strangers have ever seen it.

Important Sites

The ruins of countless kingdoms litter Faern, but such remnants

are more prevalent in the North than anywhere else. Because the

lands of the Savage Frontier and the Sword Coast have always

been rich in resources and yet particularly hostile to civilization,

kingdoms have risen and fallen here with disturbing regularity.

Crowns, scepters, signet rings, and thrones grace many treasure

hoards in the North, since petty lords and princelings seeking

kingdoms  to  call  their  own  often  demanded  regalia  betting

their newly gained status.

Ardeep

The elven realm of Ardeep, also known as the Realm of the

Deepening Moon, has a history that stretches back thousands

of years. Ruled by the coronals of Shantel Othreier, Aryvandaar,

and Illefarn at various times, Ardeep emerged as an independent

realm in its own right after the razing of Aelinthaldaar. Ardeep

later allied with the dwarves of Dardath, the humans of Delim-

biyran, the gnomes of Dolblunde, and the halings of Secomber

to form Phalorm, the Realm of Three Crowns. But after the fall

of Phalorm, most of Ardeeps moon elves retreated to Evermeet,

leaving the forest abandoned for centuries. During this period,

heavy logging reduced the forest to the size it is today. Moon elf

refugees from Eaerlann eventually reconstituted the realm, but

Ardeep never regained its former splendor.

Ardeeps borders varied nearly as much as its rulers did, but

they generally encompassed the forested lands north of the River

Delimbiyr, between the areas now known as the Forlorn Hills

and the Sword Coast. Most folk of modern-day Faern believe

that the elves inhabited only the area currently covered by the

Ardeep Forest, but in truth the Realm of the Deepening Moon

occupied at least three times that much territory. Thus, the ruins

of Ardeep can be found not only in the depths of Ardeep Forest,

but also in the surrounding countryside.

Ardeep Forest is a thick woodland of tall blueleaf, duskwood,

and  weirwood  trees.  Its  verges  are  deceptively  pleasant,  with

sun-dappled  paths  roamed  by  foraging  deer.  Farther  into  the

forest,  the  terrain  is  broken  by  ridges  and  breakneck  gullies

cloaked  in  thick  vines  and  shrubbery  and  concealed  by  mist.

Wild boars roam through ruins hidden beneath the forest loam,

and faintly glowing mushrooms provide dim spots of ghostly

illumination.

The Fair Folk call Ardeep the Faraway Forest because of its

distance from Evermeet. Outlaws and a few lonely elves dwell in

its depths, and many elves and half-elves who live in Waterdeep

come to Ardeep from time to time to revisit the green silences of

unspoiled woodlands. Three small glades near the northwestern

edge of the forest are traditional meeting spots for young lovers

whose families are actively hostile to their matches. Harpers also

meet in Ardeep from time to time, and rangers patrol the edges

of the wood to ensure that neither large predatory beasts nor

brigands settle here.

DANCING DELL

Soft moss, short grasses, and ferns cloak this smooth bowl and

the raised ring of earth that surrounds it. In the middle of the

bowl stands the Ladystone, a nger of rock touched by Eilistraee

and sacred to her. The Ladystones powers guard the dell and can

strike at intruders as commanded by the goddess or her priestesses.

The origin of the Ladystone is unknown, but it is believed to

date back to the earliest settlements in Ardeep.

Qilu Veladorn of the Seven Sisters sometimes leads worship

services here, and Eilistraee herself has manifested in Dancing

Dell on more than one occasion.

GREEN GLADE

This ring of elm trees lies in the southeastern reaches of the

Ardeep Forest. Fern thickets cloak its approaches, and no trailno

matter how well clearedsurvives for more than one night in

its vicinity.

Perpetual spring has reigned within this circle of trees for

centuries, and the entire glade is under a permanent hallow effect.

These features have been attributed to a wide range of deities

over the years, but they are in fact the effects of a minor mythal.

The mythal also enhances minor healing effects cast within its

boundaries. (Specically, the Empower Spell feat is automatically

applied to all conjuration [healing] spells cast within the circle.)

Finally, any nonmagical woodno matter how oldbrought into

the Green Glade begins to spout and grow, even if it has been cut,

stained, polished, fashioned into furniture, or damaged by re.

HOUSE OF LONG SILENCES

A faade of pale white stone separates the echoing halls of this

ancient, ruined manor from the surrounding stands of cedars

and blueleafs. The House of Long Silences encompasses a nexus

of two-way portals, including links to an abandoned watchtower

in the eastern reaches of the Trollbark Forest, the undercroft of

the Temple of Labelas in the ruined city of Mhiilamniir, and

a  subterranean  grotto  beneath  the  Snakewood.  In  addition,  a

one-way portal from Evermeet exits in the neighboring woods.

Lord  Elorndar  Floshin  (NG  male  sun  elf  ghter  1/wizard

5/eldritch knight 10), whose estate encompasses the lands between

Daggerford  and  Ardeep  Forest,  has  created  a  web  of  warding

spells in the manor and the surrounding woodlands that alerts

him to intrusions.

RELURAUNS TOMB

In a clearing at the heart of Ardeep Forest lies the vault of a

fallen elf warrior named Reluraun (male CE moon elf ghost

ghter 12), whose spirit was twisted into a mad, undead creature

by evil magic during his nal battle. Reluraun appears as two

disembodied eyes and a pair of skeletal arms and hands that

wield Relurauns Hoarcut, a +3 icy burst longsword. Relurauns

tomb is guarded by no less than three baelnorns (LG moon elf

baelnorn wizard 13), and his cofn oats alone in a domed,

underground vault. An extremely lifelike efgy of the warrior

clutches Wyrmsheart, a +2 dragon bane longsword.

Gauntlgrym

South of Mirabar, next to the Valley of Khedrun, the ruins of an

ancient subterranean city lie beneath the Crags. Built ages ago by

the dwarves of Delzoun for the humans of Illusk, Gauntlgrym

once boasted a population of more than thirty thousand dwarves

and humans. Although technically an independent kingdom, it

remained a vassal realm of Illusk until the latters fall.

Today, Gauntlgrym is a dismal collection of lightless tunnels

and damp halls in which only monsters dwell. Its peaktop ven-

tilation shaft descends more than a dozen levels to hundreds of

chambers and halls. In times past, this shaft was the lair of the

adult red dragon Abbenevaustour, a cruel wyrm with a peculiar

penchant for illithid esh.

Until a few years ago, the citys lower levels were infested

with  mind  flayers.  A  bizarre  illithid  breeding  experiment

yielded  a  highly  prolific  race  of  half-illithid  derro  about

ten years ago, and these fast-reproducing illithiderro (also

called madminds) outnumbered the mind flayers within just

a  few  years.  Craving  their  freedom,  they  rebelled,  hunting

down  and  slaughtering  their  former  masters  and  claiming

their realm. Since then, the madminds have been spreading

through the lower levels of Gauntlgrym like a plague. How-

ever, they have yet to reach the uppermost portion of the

city, which is currently home to the Hargrath, a company

of bugbears, goblins, and leucrottasMon led by Yorthon (CE

male baphitaurUnd fighter 8).

A single tunnel in Gauntlgryms lowest section leads down

to Nuur Throth, an earth node imbued with elemental magic.

(See Underdark for more information on earth nodes.) Tun-

nels from the northern part of the city connect to the Great

Worm Cavern, an ancient burial mound in the Frost Hills

far to the north.

chant and dance known as the Reghed Saga. Tribal leaders claim

that this saga is the truth as told by their forefathers since the

rst warrior. The great majority of the Reghed Saga speaks of

tribal  wars  and  dead  heroes,  but  the  oldest  parts  describe  the

founding of Old Illusk, its great kings, and how its own civilized

arrogance brought it to an end. Because custom dictates that only

tribal leaders can perform the saga and only members of the tribe

can witness it, few strangers have ever seen it.

Important Sites

The ruins of countless kingdoms litter Faern, but such remnants

are more prevalent in the North than anywhere else. Because the

lands of the Savage Frontier and the Sword Coast have always

been rich in resources and yet particularly hostile to civilization,

kingdoms have risen and fallen here with disturbing regularity.

Crowns, scepters, signet rings, and thrones grace many treasure

hoards in the North, since petty lords and princelings seeking

kingdoms  to  call  their  own  often  demanded  regalia  betting

their newly gained status.

Ardeep

The elven realm of Ardeep, also known as the Realm of the

Deepening Moon, has a history that stretches back thousands

of years. Ruled by the coronals of Shantel Othreier, Aryvandaar,

and Illefarn at various times, Ardeep emerged as an independent

realm in its own right after the razing of Aelinthaldaar. Ardeep

later allied with the dwarves of Dardath, the humans of Delim-

biyran, the gnomes of Dolblunde, and the halings of Secomber

to form Phalorm, the Realm of Three Crowns. But after the fall

of Phalorm, most of Ardeeps moon elves retreated to Evermeet,

leaving the forest abandoned for centuries. During this period,

heavy logging reduced the forest to the size it is today. Moon elf

refugees from Eaerlann eventually reconstituted the realm, but

Ardeep never regained its former splendor.

Ardeeps borders varied nearly as much as its rulers did, but

they generally encompassed the forested lands north of the River

Delimbiyr, between the areas now known as the Forlorn Hills

and the Sword Coast. Most folk of modern-day Faern believe

that the elves inhabited only the area currently covered by the

Ardeep Forest, but in truth the Realm of the Deepening Moon

occupied at least three times that much territory. Thus, the ruins

of Ardeep can be found not only in the depths of Ardeep Forest,

but also in the surrounding countryside.

Ardeep Forest is a thick woodland of tall blueleaf, duskwood,

and  weirwood  trees.  Its  verges  are  deceptively  pleasant,  with

sun-dappled  paths  roamed  by  foraging  deer.  Farther  into  the

forest,  the  terrain  is  broken  by  ridges  and  breakneck  gullies

cloaked  in  thick  vines  and  shrubbery  and  concealed  by  mist.

Wild boars roam through ruins hidden beneath the forest loam,

and faintly glowing mushrooms provide dim spots of ghostly

illumination.

The Fair Folk call Ardeep the Faraway Forest because of its

distance from Evermeet. Outlaws and a few lonely elves dwell in

its depths, and many elves and half-elves who live in Waterdeep

come to Ardeep from time to time to revisit the green silences of

unspoiled woodlands. Three small glades near the northwestern

edge of the forest are traditional meeting spots for young lovers

whose families are actively hostile to their matches. Harpers also

meet in Ardeep from time to time, and rangers patrol the edges

of the wood to ensure that neither large predatory beasts nor

brigands settle here.

DANCING DELL

Soft moss, short grasses, and ferns cloak this smooth bowl and

the raised ring of earth that surrounds it. In the middle of the

bowl stands the Ladystone, a nger of rock touched by Eilistraee

and sacred to her. The Ladystones powers guard the dell and can

strike at intruders as commanded by the goddess or her priestesses.

The origin of the Ladystone is unknown, but it is believed to

date back to the earliest settlements in Ardeep.

Qilu Veladorn of the Seven Sisters sometimes leads worship

services here, and Eilistraee herself has manifested in Dancing

Dell on more than one occasion.

GREEN GLADE

This ring of elm trees lies in the southeastern reaches of the

Ardeep Forest. Fern thickets cloak its approaches, and no trailno

matter how well clearedsurvives for more than one night in

its vicinity.

Perpetual spring has reigned within this circle of trees for

centuries, and the entire glade is under a permanent hallow effect.

These features have been attributed to a wide range of deities

over the years, but they are in fact the effects of a minor mythal.

The mythal also enhances minor healing effects cast within its

boundaries. (Specically, the Empower Spell feat is automatically

applied to all conjuration [healing] spells cast within the circle.)

Finally, any nonmagical woodno matter how oldbrought into

the Green Glade begins to spout and grow, even if it has been cut,

stained, polished, fashioned into furniture, or damaged by re.

HOUSE OF LONG SILENCES

A faade of pale white stone separates the echoing halls of this

ancient, ruined manor from the surrounding stands of cedars

and blueleafs. The House of Long Silences encompasses a nexus

of two-way portals, including links to an abandoned watchtower

in the eastern reaches of the Trollbark Forest, the undercroft of

the Temple of Labelas in the ruined city of Mhiilamniir, and

a  subterranean  grotto  beneath  the  Snakewood.  In  addition,  a

one-way portal from Evermeet exits in the neighboring woods.

Lord  Elorndar  Floshin  (NG  male  sun  elf  ghter  1/wizard

5/eldritch knight 10), whose estate encompasses the lands between

Daggerford  and  Ardeep  Forest,  has  created  a  web  of  warding

spells in the manor and the surrounding woodlands that alerts

him to intrusions.

RELURAUNS TOMB

In a clearing at the heart of Ardeep Forest lies the vault of a

fallen elf warrior named Reluraun (male CE moon elf ghost

ghter 12), whose spirit was twisted into a mad, undead creature

by evil magic during his nal battle. Reluraun appears as two

disembodied eyes and a pair of skeletal arms and hands that

wield Relurauns Hoarcut, a +3 icy burst longsword. Relurauns

tomb is guarded by no less than three baelnorns (LG moon elf

baelnorn wizard 13), and his cofn oats alone in a domed,

underground vault. An extremely lifelike efgy of the warrior

clutches Wyrmsheart, a +2 dragon bane longsword.

Gauntlgrym

South of Mirabar, next to the Valley of Khedrun, the ruins of an

ancient subterranean city lie beneath the Crags. Built ages ago by

the dwarves of Delzoun for the humans of Illusk, Gauntlgrym

once boasted a population of more than thirty thousand dwarves

and humans. Although technically an independent kingdom, it

remained a vassal realm of Illusk until the latters fall.

Today, Gauntlgrym is a dismal collection of lightless tunnels

and damp halls in which only monsters dwell. Its peaktop ven-

tilation shaft descends more than a dozen levels to hundreds of

chambers and halls. In times past, this shaft was the lair of the

adult red dragon Abbenevaustour, a cruel wyrm with a peculiar

penchant for illithid esh.

Until a few years ago, the citys lower levels were infested

with  mind  flayers.  A  bizarre  illithid  breeding  experiment

yielded  a  highly  prolific  race  of  half-illithid  derro  about

ten years ago, and these fast-reproducing illithiderro (also

called madminds) outnumbered the mind flayers within just

a  few  years.  Craving  their  freedom,  they  rebelled,  hunting

down  and  slaughtering  their  former  masters  and  claiming

their realm. Since then, the madminds have been spreading

through the lower levels of Gauntlgrym like a plague. How-

ever, they have yet to reach the uppermost portion of the

city, which is currently home to the Hargrath, a company

of bugbears, goblins, and leucrottasMon led by Yorthon (CE

male baphitaurUnd fighter 8).

A single tunnel in Gauntlgryms lowest section leads down

to Nuur Throth, an earth node imbued with elemental magic.

(See Underdark for more information on earth nodes.) Tun-

nels from the northern part of the city connect to the Great

Worm Cavern, an ancient burial mound in the Frost Hills

far to the north.

THE OLD NORTH

THE OLD NORTH

Old Illusk

Founded by ancient Northmen from the western island of Ru-

athym, Illusk was razed and rebuilt numerous times. Its people

faced great dif culties in expanding their civilization beyond the

original city, primarily because orcs, giants, and other predatory

creatures threatened them on every side. No wooden structures

of old Illusk survived the ravages of time, war, and  re.

The original founders of Illusk favored rune magic, and they

employed runes, glyphs, symbols, and similar magic to protect

their  fortresses,  homes,  and  tombs.  The  Netherese  refugees

who resettled Illusk adopted and re ned the use of rune magic,

combining it with the potent personal defenses of their spell

mantles to forge a web of spells that provided protection against

the ever-present dangers of the North. Illuskan tombs from

this later period contain many Netherese spellbooks, scepters,

and  other  items  that  the  refugees  brought  with  them  from

Netheril.

HOST TOWER OF THE ARCANE

This ancient multispired tower was erected more than seventeen

centuries ago to protect Illusk from phaerimms that might pursue

 eeing Netherese to their new home. Though the tower has now

become the home of the Arcane Brotherhood, it has changed

little since the days when the Grand Cabal met here. The Host

Tower contains many portals that lead to other planes, including

a demiplane shadow of the tower itself.

Laeral of the Seven Sisters imprisoned many of the Netherese

liches and demilichesEL of the Grand Cabal in the towers shadow

demiplane,  from  which  they  spent  centuries  trying  to  escape.

Others  ed to the ruins of Illusk and took up residence in its

ancient underground tombs. Many of the wards imprisoning the

Old Ones have been sundered, but some remain in place, since

even the leaders of the Arcane Brotherhood do not dare release

all these malignant masters of the Art.

RUINS OF ILLUSK

The ruins of the original city of Illusk are nestled within the

city of Luskan, on the south shore of the Mirar River. Crumbled

forti cations, shattered towers, toppled statues, and cracked tomb

entrances overgrown with creepers and vines cover an area equal

to several city blocks. The stone walls around the ruins do little

to protect the inhabitants of Luskan from the dangerous undead

dwelling in the ancient graves belowground and the vermin that

occupy the remains of the surface structures.

Dozens  of  Netherese  arcanists  who   ed  their  homeland

lived, died, and were buried with their magic in Illusk. Today,

the wealthy townsfolk of Luskan continue to bury their dead in

mausoleums on the south end of the ruins amid crumbling vaults

and moldering tombs. Runic guardians and archaic spellwards

guard the ancient burial chambers and tunnels underneath the

mausoleums.

Phalorm

At the Council of Axe and Arrow, the moon elves of Ardeep, the

shield dwarves of Dardath, the rock gnomes of Dolblunde, the

hal ings of Secomber, and the humans of Delimbiyran agreed

to unite, forging a new kingdom called Phalorm, or the Realm

of Three Crowns. Phalorm lasted less than a century before it

fell to successive waves of orc and goblinoid attacks.

In the waning years of Phalorm, the elves, weary of warring

with the orcs, withdrew from Phalorm and left for Evermeet. The

dwarf population, by then greatly reduced, retreated to defensive

holdings deep beneath the Dark Hills (now known as the Forlorn

Hills) or journeyed east to join Ammarindar.

DELIMBIYRAN

The Kingdom of Man arose quickly after the fall of Phalorm,

primarily because the humans of the region had outgrown any

need for an alliance with other peoples. Claiming all the territories

that  had  once  been  part  of  Phalorm,  King  Javilarhh  II  built

a new kingdom called Delimbiyran. Most of its populace was

human, but the gnomes and hal ings of the region who chose

to remain within the alliance and submit to the new kings rule

were welcomed as well.

To address the orc problem, the king constructed a chain of

border castles along the eastern fringe of the High Moor to keep

the orcs of that area in check. Over the next  fty years, during

a period known as the Endless Battle, the humans of Delimbiyr

Vale  launched  repeated  military  incursions  into  the  southern

High Moor and Sword Mountains to slaughter the orcs where

they lived.

Disaster then struck the young kingdom. In the process of

transforming herself into a lich, Dark Mother Lalondra Worul,

the reigning high priestess of Shar, brought death to all the True

Servants of Shar, whose continued health she had bound to her

own. Lalondras disappearance and the wholesale demise of the

Mistress of the Nights senior clergy shattered the power of Shars

church, inciting its undisciplined underlings to riot in cities along

the Sword Coast. King Davyd ordered his troops to clamp down

on the violence, prompting a Sharran fanatic to martyr himself

by assassinating Delimbiyrans monarch.

The kings death and the absence of a legitimate heir plunged

the Kingdom of Man into an ill-timed civil war. In the following

year, orc raiders from the High Forest overran many of the newly

proclaimed splinter kingdoms of Delimbiyran, sweeping them

away in an orgy of  re and slaughter. The Duke of Calandor

(secretly backed by the mages who would later form the Covenant)

forged an alliance among the warring lordlings, and their com-

bined forces eventually defeated the orcs. This brief cooperation

largely ended the warring among the splinter kingdoms, but the

Kingdom of Man was no more.

DELIMBIYRAN, THE SHINING CITY

The city of Delimbiyran survived only a few decades after the

collapse of the Kingdom of Man. In 714 DR, a battle between

 ends and the elf and dwarf defenders of distant Myth Drannor

ended abruptly with the violent destruction of the Warriors

Gate. The resultant explosion extended through the portal and

out the Gate of Songs, which lay in the royal stronghold at

the  heart  of  Delimbiyran.  These  uncontrolled  magical  ener-

gies incinerated much of the Shining City and devastated the

surrounding region as well. Only a handful of artifacts from

144

the once-thriving human civilizations of the lower Delimbiyr

river valley survive today.

LAUGHING HOLLOW

South of the Delimbiyr River, just inside the northwestern edge

of the Misty Forest, lies an old dwarven quarry called Laughing

Hollow. Numerous entrances lead from this quarry to a dwarfhold

under Mount Illefarn.

Perpetual twilight reigns in the forested area within a 1-mile

radius of the hollow, regardless of the time of day. Melandrach,

the  mysterious,  self-proclaimed  King  of  the  Woods  (N  male

wild elf  ghter 7/druid 10) watches over this darkened section

of the forest. Few dare visit here, since the tales maintain that

Melandrach takes a dim view of those who would disturb the

peace of his realm.

MOUNT ILLEFARN

Under the hills east of Daggerford are the ruins of a sprawling

dwarfhold  that  encompassed  a  labyrinth  of  living  quarters,

halls, workshops, mines, secret doors, and tunnels. The dwarves

left behind a number of magic items that manipulate earth and

water when this dwarfhold was abandoned.

The upper levels of the complex have been reclaimed by the

dwarves of Clan Ironeater. The lower levels are home to tribes of

goblins, orcs, ogres, and trolls that follow an undead necromancer

named Kelthas the Dread (CE male human mohrg necromancer

10). After his death at the hands of adventurers more than a

decade ago, Kelthas returned to plague the dwarves as a mohrg.

He and his followers worship Myrkul in a profaned shrine of

Moradin that has been rededicated to the dead god.

The  mechanical  pumps  that  the  ancient  dwarves  built  to

empty water from the lower sections of the mines long ago ceased

functioning, so the lowest sections of the mine tunnels are  lled

with freezing cold, fouled water.

STONETURN, THE HOUSE OF STONE

Along the eastern edge of Ardeep Forest stand the ruins of

an immense square tower built by the dwarves and elves of

Illefarn. The structure remains largely intact, though ancient

spell-battles coupled with many years of neglect have caused

numerous  roof  collapses  and  pits.  The  hundreds  of  rooms,

atriums, halls, and temples that make up the House of Stone

are all pieced together in a seemingly haphazard manner and

protected by bizarre traps of dwarven make. At the heart of

the structure is Stoneturn Well, an ancient water source that

draws from the Underdark lake of Asmaeringol. The connec-

tion  also  allows  Underdark  monsters  and  water  elementals

into the ruins.

Local folklore maintains that the House of Stone contains

a freakish silver forest and many other metallic wonders that

seem to have no purpose. Legends also tell of gold, gems, and a

great dwarven armory protected by all manner of traps, hidden

doors, magical wards, and the undead remains of slain dwarf

warriors.

The moon elves of Ardeep stopped guarding these ruins years

ago, so adventurers have begun trying to brave the dangers of

the House of Stone. Arallia Silverbow (N female moon elf rogue

5), apprentice to Elaith Craulnober, has been studying the ruins

for the past few months, probing tunnels and disabling traps as

she works her way to the towers center section.

protected by bizarre traps of dwarven make. At the heart of

the structure is Stoneturn Well, an ancient water source that

draws from the Underdark lake of Asmaeringol. The connec-

tion  also  allows  Underdark  monsters  and  water  elementals

into the ruins.

Local folklore maintains that the House of Stone contains

a freakish silver forest and many other metallic wonders that

seem to have no purpose. Legends also tell of gold, gems, and a

great dwarven armory protected by all manner of traps, hidden

doors, magical wards, and the undead remains of slain dwarf

warriors.

The moon elves of Ardeep stopped guarding these ruins years

ago, so adventurers have begun trying to brave the dangers of

the House of Stone. Arallia Silverbow (N female moon elf rogue

5), apprentice to Elaith Craulnober, has been studying the ruins

for the past few months, probing tunnels and disabling traps as

she works her way to the towers center section.

THE OLD NORTH

Legacies of the

Old North

Most citizens of the cities in the North are blissfully unaware

of  the  long  and  tortured  history  of  their  realm.  Waterdeep,

Luskan, Secomber, Neverwinter, Daggerford, and many other

settlements  are  successors  of  the  elven,  dwarven  and  human

kingdoms of old. The northern settlements with the most diverse

populations (typically dwarf, elf, gnome, haling, half-elf, half-orc

and human citizens) have inherited many of the same problems

faced by their ancestors.

No great empires arose to rule for millennia in the North.

Instead, an untold number of abandoned elven villages, destroyed

human  towns,  and  fallen  dwarven  kingdoms  have  left  behind

crypts, tombs, mines, and towers, most of which have never ap-

peared on any map. Many of these ruined places contain secrets

and hidden terrors that have never seen the light of day.

Adventure Site:

Keep on the Frontier

Grimmantle Keep sits on a hill in a central region of the Crags,

along the western slopes that overlook the River Mirar. Gaucelm

Gonfrey, the undead Thief-King of Grimmantle, rules a dangerous

gang of thieves, murderers, and other outlaws while plotting the

rebirth of the kingdom he swore to win in life.

Background

The frontier kingdom of Grimmantle was founded by humans

in the eastern Crags in 272 DR, during a long respite from orc

attacks. In 304 DR, Lord Gonfrey usurped the throne after mur-

dering the aged king, but he ruled for only one year before he in

turn was murdered by an assassins poisoned arrow. The people of

Grimmantle buried their hated thief-king far beneath the Crags.

Two years later, Grimmantle was swept away by the Thousand

Fangs orc horde on its way to Neverwinter and Illusk.

Gonfrey slumbered in death for centuries, but his story was not

over. In the months preceding the Time of Troubles, the death-god

Myrkul chose to bestow the gift of undeath upon Gonfrey and

convert him into a death knightMM2. Whatever plans Myrkul

had for his new servant were forever lost when the god himself

perished in Waterdeep. Gonfrey wandered the North for years,

then nally returned home to the ruins of Grimmantle.

Since moving back into his old keep, Gonfrey has assembled

a small band of humans that he hopes will become the founda-

tion of a new kingdom. With the aid of illusions from Quaerel

Nhommingtun,  his  court  mage,  Gonfrey  hides  his  undead

nature from the others, even going so far as to dine with them

on occasion.

Keep Features

The keep still bears many scars of ancient orc attacks, including

gouged  walls,  shattered  rooftops,  and  broken  gates  and  doors.

Gonfreys on-duty guards are positioned as noted, but those off

duty can be found in any public area on the keeps grounds.

Keyed Areas

The following areas are keyed to the map of Grimmantle Keep.

1. OUTER AREA

The aged stone wall around this neglected keep stands about 20

feet high. The place has obviously been attacked many times in

the distant past, judging by the gouges and thick cracks that spread

like spiderwebs through its walls. The crumbling battlements have

left chunks of fallen stone and mortar at the base of the keep, and

weeds grow in the open area where its great gates once stood.

2. ENTRANCE PATH (EL 7 OR 9)

This paved path of cracked stone leads through the open, arched

gateway to a pair of barricaded doorsobviously the keeps main

entrance. Thorny patches of brambles, nettles, and weeds grow on

either side of the path. On the far eastern and western sides of

the inner wall, stone staircases lead up to a 5-foot-wide rampart

walkway.

The  keeps  ironbound,  wooden  entrance  doors  are  barricaded

from the inside.

Barricaded Doors: 1-1/2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 30 each;

break DC 22.

Creatures: Four thugs stand guard on the path just inside the

gate area during the day. They are not particularly alert, and one

or two are usually sleeping.

Guards (4): Male and female human rogue 1/ghter 2; CR

3; Medium humanoid; HD 1d6 plus 2d10; hp 14; Init +3; Spd

30 ft.; AC 17, touch 13, at-footed 14; Base Atk +2; Grp +3; Atk

Reload, Thug, Weapon Focus (short sword).

Languages: Chondathan, Common, Illuskan, Orc.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  A  guard  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against at-footed or anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

A guard can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapnding (Ex): A guard can nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result

exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass

the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, masterwork short sword,

masterwork composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) with 20 arrows,

potion of blur, potion of cure light wounds, horn, 5 gp.

Tactics: The guards immediately challenge anyone approaching

the keep through by way of the entrance path, demanding to

know their business at Grimmantle Keep. Traders and caravans

with goods to sell are welcomed; all others are asked to surrender

their weapons before entering. If asked, the guards name Lord

Gonfrey as master of the keep. A signicant bribe (10 gp for

each guard) allows visitors to keep their weapons and gains them

an escort to Lord Gonfrey.

Should a brawl begin, the four guards work together to take

down  the  biggest  opponent  who  seems  to  be  a  ghter-type.

They use their crossbows rst if they have ample time to re

unhindered before engaging in melee. As soon as one guard falls,

the remaining ones blow their horns to call for assistance. Four

more guards arrive 5 rounds thereafter.

3. MAIN ENTRY

This keeps entrance room has 15-foot-high walls that show war

damage similar to that of the walls outside. The oor is a mess

of mud and broken agstones. The three entryways that lead

out of the room appear to have had doors at one time, but they

have none now.

If the guards escorted the PCs here, one goes to tell Gonfrey that

he has visitors, and the rest remain with the characters.

4. GARBAGE MIDDEN (EL 7)

Heaps of rotting garbage and offal cover the oor of this dank,

dark  chamber,  and  the  air  reeks  with  the  stench.  Four  arrow

slits, each 2 feet high by 6 inches wide, line the rooms southern

wall.  The  squeaks  of  vermin  emanate  from  somewhere  under

the garbage.

The residents of the keep dump their garbage here.

Creatures: A pack of osquips lairs here, feeding on the nightly

deliveries of garbage.

Osquips (7): CR 1; Small magical beast; HD 1d10+4; hp 9;

Init +1; Spd 40 ft., burrow 5 ft.; AC 15, touch 12, at-footed 14;

5. GUARDPOST (EL 7 OR 9)

Four arrow slits in the south wall of this room allow easy defense

of this portion of the keep. A log serves as a communal chair for

guards, and a ladder on the north wall leads to a trapdoor in

the ceiling.

Gonfrey has guards on duty here around the clock.

Creatures: This area is manned by four guards during the day

and four allips by night.

Guards (4): See area 2 for statistics.

Allips (4): hp 26 each; see Monster Manual, page 10.

Tactics: The guards demand that visitors identify themselves

and state their business. Unless they are expected, visitors who

arrive  at  night  are  told  to  leave  the  area  and  return  in  the

morning when the guards can have a better look at them. The

regular guards can be bribed to open the barricaded doors to the

keep, but the allips cannot.

The guards  re their bows on anyone wandering the grounds

or attempting to open the barricaded doors. The allips use their

babble special attack, then sally forth to attack the intruders.

If combat breaks out here, the guards sound the alarm im-

mediately. Three rounds later, four guards arrive from area 7.

Wrinth (see area 6) immediately reports the attack to Gonfrey

in area 10.

A night battle with the allips draws attention from area 7 in

1d4 rounds. Upon arrival, the guards hold back until the allips

are defeated.

Development: At night, the guards sleep in area 9. During

the day, the allips join Gonfrey in area 10.

6. GREAT HALL (EL 10 OR 12)

This chamber served as the throne room and audience chamber

of the keep. Read or paraphrase the following aloud, adjusting as

needed to account for Wrinths presence or absence.

The walls of this great stone hall are 20 feet high. Remnants of

murals on the walls indicate the former elegance of the place. A

10-foot-diameter  hole  in  ceiling  reveals  that  the  corresponding

opening in the slate roof has been poorly thatched over.

The kings original throne is gone, and Gonfrey has commissioned

Wrinth, a man as skilled at woodworking as he is at murder, to

carve a new one.

Creatures: If no alarm has sounded, Wrinth is busily carving

the throne, assisted by two guardsmen, when the characters arrive.

Otherwise, he is preparing to meet the intruders, as noted in the

Tactics section below.

Wrinth: Male human rogue 5/assassin 4; CR 9; Medium hu-

manoid; HD 9d6+18; hp 49; Init +4; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18, touch 14,

Full Atk +9/+4 melee (1d4+2/1720, +1 keen dagger) or +11/+6

Blank Shot, Rapid Reload, Still Spell, Weapon Focus (dagger).

Languages: Chondathan, Common; Dwarven, Illuskan, Orc.

Death Attack (Ex): If Wrinth studies his victim for 3 rounds

and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that success-

fully deals damage, the sneak attack can also either paralyze or kill

the target (Wrinths choice). If the victim fails a DC 17 Fortitude

save against the kill effect, she dies. If the save fails against the

paralysis effect, the victim is helpless and unable to act for 1d6+4

rounds. If the saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal

sneak attack. Once Wrinth has completed the 3 rounds of study,

he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Wrinth  deals  an  extra  5d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Wrinth can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion (Ex): If Wrinth is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Wrinth cannot be  anked

and can only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least

thirteen levels of rogue.

Poison Use: Wrinth is skilled in the use of poison and never risk

accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison to a weapon.

Trap nding (Ex): Wrinth can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result

exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass

the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Wrinth  retains  his  Dexterity  bonus

to Armor Class even when  at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise

immobile).

Assassin Spells Known (4/2 per day; caster level 4th): 1stdis-

guise self, jump, sleep (DC 13), true strike; 2ndinvisibility, spider

climb, undetectable alignment.

Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +1 keen dagger, +1 hand

crossbow with 10 bolts, 3 doses of wyvern poison (injury DC 17,

initial 2d6 Con, secondary 2d6 Con), 50 gp.

Guards (2): See area 2 for statistics.

Tactics: As soon as he hears an alarm, Wrinth casts spider

climb and invisibility on himself, runs to warn Lord Gonfrey

in area 10, then returns to this chamber, where he uses spider

climb to take up a high position on the far wall, out of reach of

The sounds of combat in this chamber can easily be overheard

(Listen DC 10) by anyone in areas 7, 9, 10 and 11. Four guards

arrive to join combat 5 rounds after a  ght begins.

This area is the guards barracks.

Creatures: At any time, four to eight guards are resting here.

Guards (4 to 8): See area 2 for statistics.

7. DINING HALL/KITCHEN (EL 7 OR 10)

A long, rough-hewn wooden table lines the length of the northern

wall. A half dozen skinned rabbits lie on the table next to a pile

of turnips and dried herbs. Barrels of ale and water sit under

the table. The room also contains three small square tables and

numerous benches.

10. CHAMBER OF THE THIEF-KING (EL 12)

The walls of this opulent chamber are adorned with draperies

and tapestries depicting knights in battle. In the center of the room

stands a huge, square bed dressed with  ne sheets and a heavy

blanket.  An  ornately  carved  wooden  desk  with  matching

chair and a sizable wardrobe complete the furnishings.

When  this  room  functioned  as  the  library  of

Grimmantle,  it  contained  tax  ledgers,  birth

records, and other documents of state. Now

the guards use it to prepare and consume

meals. The guards clean and prepare food on

a long table along the northern wall, then

cook it in a large stone  replace that serves

as a makeshift oven. Meat stews or roasts

are the centerpieces of most meals.

Creatures: Four guards are normally in

this chamber preparing meals or feasting

on stew and ale.

Guards (4): See area 2 for statistics.

Tactics: The guards are not expecting

a  ght in this room. While drawing their

weapons,  they  overturn  tables,  kick

benches into the characters paths,

and  cause  as  much  commotion  as

possible so as to alert the keep to

the presence of intruders.

A  loud   ght  in  this  room

(Listen DC 10) brings Wrinth and

his two assistants from area 6 in 5

rounds if they have not already been

dealt with.

Grimmantle Keep

8. ARMORY

Rows of heavy crossbows hang from

every wall in this large chamber. On the  oor are bolts, arrows,

blades, armor, and a couple of wooden shields.

This  secured  area  holds  the  keeps  current  arsenal.  Gonfreys

guards took most of this equipment in raids on merchant wagons

traveling to Mirabar. The death knight hopes to equip an army

with his ever-growing cache.

Wooden Door: 1-1/2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 15; break DC

18; Open Locks DC 20.

Treasure: The chamber contains 20 heavy crossbows with 400

bolts, +1 chainmail, 5 suits of leather armor, 2 suits of studded

leather  armor,  8  daggers,  a  dagger  of  frost,  3  longswords,  50

darts, and 2 wooden shields.

9. BARRACKS (EL 7 OR 9)

Two dozen crudely made wooden beds with straw mattresses line

the east and west walls of this chamber. Fires blaze in the two

 replaces on the south wall.

Gonfrey  has  spared  no  expense  in   tting  out  his

chamber with the royal trappings that he enjoyed

in life. His wardrobe is  lled with  nery pur-

chased in Neverwinter.

Creature: Gonfrey spends most of his time in

this chamber, emerging only to dine with his

troops and to help repel intruders. Although

the  death  knight  does  not  require  rest,  he

maintains  the  faade  of  sleeping  here  each

night.  He  uses  his  ring  of  disguise  self  to

appear  as  a  living  human  whenever  he

expects to encounter his troops.

5. GUARDPOST (EL 7 OR 9)

Four arrow slits in the south wall of this room allow easy defense

of this portion of the keep. A log serves as a communal chair for

guards, and a ladder on the north wall leads to a trapdoor in

the ceiling.

Gonfrey has guards on duty here around the clock.

Creatures: This area is manned by four guards during the day

and four allips by night.

Guards (4): See area 2 for statistics.

Allips (4): hp 26 each; see Monster Manual, page 10.

Tactics: The guards demand that visitors identify themselves

and state their business. Unless they are expected, visitors who

arrive  at  night  are  told  to  leave  the  area  and  return  in  the

morning when the guards can have a better look at them. The

regular guards can be bribed to open the barricaded doors to the

keep, but the allips cannot.

The guards  re their bows on anyone wandering the grounds

or attempting to open the barricaded doors. The allips use their

babble special attack, then sally forth to attack the intruders.

If combat breaks out here, the guards sound the alarm im-

mediately. Three rounds later, four guards arrive from area 7.

Wrinth (see area 6) immediately reports the attack to Gonfrey

in area 10.

A night battle with the allips draws attention from area 7 in

1d4 rounds. Upon arrival, the guards hold back until the allips

are defeated.

Development: At night, the guards sleep in area 9. During

the day, the allips join Gonfrey in area 10.

6. GREAT HALL (EL 10 OR 12)

This chamber served as the throne room and audience chamber

of the keep. Read or paraphrase the following aloud, adjusting as

needed to account for Wrinths presence or absence.

The walls of this great stone hall are 20 feet high. Remnants of

murals on the walls indicate the former elegance of the place. A

10-foot-diameter  hole  in  ceiling  reveals  that  the  corresponding

opening in the slate roof has been poorly thatched over.

The kings original throne is gone, and Gonfrey has commissioned

Wrinth, a man as skilled at woodworking as he is at murder, to

carve a new one.

Creatures: If no alarm has sounded, Wrinth is busily carving

the throne, assisted by two guardsmen, when the characters arrive.

Otherwise, he is preparing to meet the intruders, as noted in the

Tactics section below.

Languages: Chondathan, Common; Dwarven, Illuskan, Orc.

Death Attack (Ex): If Wrinth studies his victim for 3 rounds

and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that success-

fully deals damage, the sneak attack can also either paralyze or kill

the target (Wrinths choice). If the victim fails a DC 17 Fortitude

save against the kill effect, she dies. If the save fails against the

paralysis effect, the victim is helpless and unable to act for 1d6+4

rounds. If the saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal

sneak attack. Once Wrinth has completed the 3 rounds of study,

he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Wrinth  deals  an  extra  5d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Wrinth can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion (Ex): If Wrinth is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Wrinth cannot be  anked

and can only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least

thirteen levels of rogue.

Poison Use: Wrinth is skilled in the use of poison and never risk

accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison to a weapon.

Trap nding (Ex): Wrinth can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result

exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass

the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Wrinth  retains  his  Dexterity  bonus

to Armor Class even when  at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise

immobile).

Assassin Spells Known (4/2 per day; caster level 4th): 1stdis-

guise self, jump, sleep (DC 13), true strike; 2ndinvisibility, spider

climb, undetectable alignment.

Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +1 keen dagger, +1 hand

crossbow with 10 bolts, 3 doses of wyvern poison (injury DC 17,

initial 2d6 Con, secondary 2d6 Con), 50 gp.

Guards (2): See area 2 for statistics.

Tactics: As soon as he hears an alarm, Wrinth casts spider

climb and invisibility on himself, runs to warn Lord Gonfrey

in area 10, then returns to this chamber, where he uses spider

climb to take up a high position on the far wall, out of reach of

any swords. He shoots poisoned crossbow bolts at any spellcasters

while his assistants engage the intruders in melee.

followers (ghouls, ghasts, medium skeletons, wights or zombies)

within a 200-mile radius. He suppresses this ability most of the

poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works

power, ring of disguise self, 900 gp.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Iphso is exposed to any effect that

normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving throw for half

damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw and

half damage if the saving throw fails.

Speak with Bats (Ex):  Iphso  can  speak  with  bats  and  dire

bats. Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the

conversing creatures.

Speak with Master (Ex): Iphso can communicate verbally with

Quaerel. Other creatures do not understand the communication

without magical help.

Skills: *Iphso has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

She loses these bonuses if her blindsense is negated.

Tactics: Quaerel attempts to bully or bargain her way out of a

ght if she is surprised by powerful intruders. She is not willing

to die for Gonfrey, nor is she above selling him out or revealing

his undead status to escape death. If forced to ght, she casts dis-

placement on herself, then resorts to her shadow magic spells.

Treasure: Under the bed are three chests containing clothes,

maps, and books. The sorcerer keeps no treasure here.

Concluding the Adventure

Once  Gonfrey  is  slain,  any  surviving  guards  from  his  band

disperse. If both Quaeral and Wrinth survive, they team up and

begin concocting their own plans to raid ruins in the North,

hoping to set themselves up as bandit lords.

Artifacts

Past

of the

Many  of  Faerns  lost  empires  boasted

magic of world-shaking power. Many of

the more dangerous artifacts from this

period were destroyed or buried long ago. Oc-

casionally, however, one of these ancient relics

resurfaces in the treasure hoard of some fearsome monster or in

the hands of a powerful NPC with links to the ancient past.

Though less powerful than the grand artifacts created by

the mages of old, many of these ancient magic items are potent

tools in their own right. Some were quite common at the height

of  the  empires  that  spawned  them,  but  others  were  rare  or

unique even then. All are quite rare now, and many historians

and sages would pay dearly to examine them.

Magic Item

Descriptions

The following magic items were conceived and created by citizens

of Faerns lost kingdoms.

Weapons

Weapons of various sorts are perhaps the most common devices

found among the ruins of lost empires. The wizards and clerics

of these long-dead kingdoms produced any number of simple

+1 or +2 weapons and suits of armor, many of which are still

in use. A few of the special abilities popular in olden times,

however, are quite rare now.

MAGIC WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITY

DESCRIPTIONS

Two special abilities not often seen in current-day Faern are

described below. A weapon with a special ability must have at

least a +1 enhancement bonus.

Powerleech: The powerleech special ability can be added only

to melee weapons. A weapon with this ability drains psychic

energy from the creature struck and transfers it to the wielder,

thereby producing the following effects.

Any creature that has a psionic power point reserve loses 1

power point when struck with a powerleech weapon, just as

if it had expended that amount to manifest a psionic power.

The  creature  can  regain  the  power  point  normally  when

it rests or by any other normal means of regaining power

points.

A wielder who has a power point reserve gains 1 power point

upon  striking  a  creature  that  has  a  power  point  reserve,

psi-like  abilities,  or  spell-like  abilities  that  are  described

as  psionic  in  origin.  Power  points  gained  by  the  use  of  a

powerleech weapon can restore expended power points but

cannot increase the wielders current power point score above

its normal maximum.

A wielder who does not have a power point reserve gains

nothing  from  the  strike,  although  he  can  still  drain

power  points  from  creatures  that  do  possess  power  point

reserves.

Sending: A weapon with this ability transports any creature

it strikes to a place of the wielders choosing on a roll of natural

20, followed by a successful roll to con rm the critical hit. The

wielder must select the opponents destination as a free action

when the con rmation roll is made. The selected location must

be a place that the wielder has personally visited or seen, and

it must be on the same plane as the wielder is at the time. If

no location is indicated, the opponent is not transported. This

ability otherwise functions like the teleport spell.

effect (Will DC 14 negates) on any creature it strikes, so that

a hal ings shorter legs will not prove disadvantageous when

chasing down a malefactor. At least two hundred armathors

shot from this longbow become silvered weapons in  ight, and

any creature struck by one is subject to the effects of a silver-

city known as Corrant.

A psionic character wielding a nimblestep can take a move

action instead of a full-round action to become psionically

can expend his psionic focus to gain a +10 bonus on a single

Upon its owners death, it passed on to one of Uthgars twelve

sons, eventually becoming the traditional weapon of the leader

of the Red Pony tribe. The spear of Morgur was lost when a

Red Pony chieftain ventured into the Underdark by way of a

passage beneath the One Stone ancestor mound.

The spear of Morgur is a +1 brilliant energy longspear. In

addition, any creature touched by it is bathed in rose-hued faerie

Rings

The magic rings crafted by ancient mages and clerics have proved

fully as durable as their weapons. In fact, many common rings,

such as rings of protection or invisibility, are quite old, dating

back hundreds of years. A few rings, however, have remained

lost to the ages.

RING DESCRIPTIONS

The  following  rings  appear  only  rarely  in  monster  treasure

hoards, lost tombs, or other hidden locations.

Ring  of  Creation:  This  elegant  double  band  of  platinum

looks like two intertwining tongues of  ame. Its wearer can

use minor creation three times per day and major creation once

per day. Each of these functions requires a different command

word.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Forge Ring, minor creation,

major creation; Price 33,000 gp.

Fiendring:  Fiendrings  appear  as  small,  rusty  bands  of

jagged iron. Once per day, the wearer of a fiendring can take

the form of any  endish creature, demon, or devil that can

be summoned by a summon monster I, II, III, or IV spell.

Only one form can be assumed with each use, but the wearer

gains  all  the  assumed  forms  extraordinary,  spell-like,  and

supernatural abilities. The wearers type changes to outsider,

rendering him vulnerable to spells and effects that affect evil

outsiders. Effects that would otherwise banish the wearer to

another plane instead end the effect immediately, leaving the

wearer staggered for 1 round. Otherwise, the transformation

lasts 12 minutes.

Nar demonbindersUna forged dozens of these bizarre rings

so that they could take on the shapes of  endish beings. Some

used their  endrings to  ght alongside their summoned demons;

others used them to assume a more durable form

in  order  to  mate  with   ends  they  had

summoned.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL

Price 30,000 gp.

Ring

of  Whispered

Thoughts:  A  ring  of  whis-

pered  thoughts  enables  its

wearer  to  haunt  opponents

from  afar.  The  wearer  can

use  whispering  wind  three

times per day, suggestion once

per  day,  and  mass  suggestion

once  per  week.  Either  of  the

suggestion effects can be used in

conjunction with the whisper-

ing wind function if desired.

In  such  a  case,  the  mass

suggestion effect targets all

creatures in the area of the

whispering wind, whereas the

suggestion  effect  targets  one

randomly  determined  creature

in the whispering winds area.

Charges: A scepter has 50 charges upon creation. Each spell

effect it contains can be used as many times as desired, up to

the limit of the charges remaining in the scepter. A scepter that

contains two spells, however, may require a different number of

charges to produce each of its effects. A spell of 1st through 4th

level drains 1 charge per use, while a spell of 5th through 7th

level drains 2 charges per use.

SPECIFIC SCEPTERS

Because  a  scepter  can  combine  two

wildly  different  spell  effects,  most

bear  little  resemblance  to  one

another. However, two particular

kinds  of  scepters  were  often

forged  in  ancient  lands:  the

Netherese blast scepter and the

silver ankh of Ra.

(caster  level  10th,  2  charges)  that  deals

15d6 points of electricity damage and a

maximized  shocking  grasp  (caster  level

7th, 1 charge) that deals 30 points of

electricity damage.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft

Scepter  (see  page  8),  lightning  bolt,

shocking grasp; Price 48,000 gp.

Scepters

A scepter is a slender device that looks much

like a rod or a wand. Scepters are generally

more powerful than wands but easier to make than staffs.

A scepter can hold one or two spells of up to 7th level. When

calling forth the desired effect, the wielder uses the caster level

(minimum 6th) and the save DC set by the scepters maker.

Netherese blast scepter

Physical  Description:  Scepters  are  usually  forged  from

bronze, iron, silver, or another metal and adorned with enamel-

ing or inlaid precious gems. A scepter measures about 2 feet

in length and weighs 2 to 3 pounds. It has a decorative head

in the shape of a dragons talon, a mounted crystal, a clenched

 st, or some similarly rounded object. A typical scepter has 10

hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 24.

Activation: Scepters use the spell trigger activation method,

so casting a spell from a scepter is usually a standard action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To activate a scepter,

the wielder must hold it forth or brandish it in one hand.

Silver  Ankh  of  Ra:  Shaped  like  a

loop-headed  cross,  the  silver  ankh  was

common in ancient Mulhorand. To use it,

the wielder must grasp the loop and point the base

of the cross toward the target. A silver ankh contains

the spells searing light and cure serious wounds (both caster

level 10th, 1 charge).

Faint evocation and conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Scepter (see

page 8), searing light, cure serious wounds; Price 33,750 gp.

Staffs

Unlike rings and wondrous items, staffs are somewhat uncom-

mon among the treasures of fallen lands. Because these potent

weapons are often used extensively by owners in distress, most

have few or no charges by the time the owner falls. Thus, staffs

found in the ruins of Faerns lost kingdoms rarely have more

than a handful of charges remaining.

Scepters

A scepter is a slender device that looks much

like a rod or a wand. Scepters are generally

more powerful than wands but easier to make than staffs.

A scepter can hold one or two spells of up to 7th level. When

calling forth the desired effect, the wielder uses the caster level

(minimum 6th) and the save DC set by the scepters maker.

Netherese blast scepter

Physical  Description:  Scepters  are  usually  forged  from

bronze, iron, silver, or another metal and adorned with enamel-

ing or inlaid precious gems. A scepter measures about 2 feet

in length and weighs 2 to 3 pounds. It has a decorative head

in the shape of a dragons talon, a mounted crystal, a clenched

 st, or some similarly rounded object. A typical scepter has 10

hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 24.

Activation: Scepters use the spell trigger activation method,

so casting a spell from a scepter is usually a standard action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To activate a scepter,

the wielder must hold it forth or brandish it in one hand.

Silver  Ankh  of  Ra:  Shaped  like  a

loop-headed  cross,  the  silver  ankh  was

common in ancient Mulhorand. To use it,

the wielder must grasp the loop and point the base

of the cross toward the target. A silver ankh contains

the spells searing light and cure serious wounds (both caster

level 10th, 1 charge).

Faint evocation and conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Scepter (see

page 8), searing light, cure serious wounds; Price 33,750 gp.

Staffs

Unlike rings and wondrous items, staffs are somewhat uncom-

mon among the treasures of fallen lands. Because these potent

weapons are often used extensively by owners in distress, most

have few or no charges by the time the owner falls. Thus, staffs

found in the ruins of Faerns lost kingdoms rarely have more

than a handful of charges remaining.

with a softly glowing moonstone. At least one lesser staff of

Silverymoon lies in the ruins of Hellgate Keep; most of the

Thyrsus of the Druid: The wood elf druid Craenoth Driel

of Eaerlann crafted the rst known  thyrsus more than six

hundred  years  ago.  The  great  druid  was  slaughtered  while

defending  the  High  Forest  against  tanarukk  forces  from

Hellgate Keep. His thyrsus was carried back to that foul rift

as part of the war spoils of the demon lords, but its current

location is unknown.

Several of Craenoths bereaved acolytes created their own

versions of this staff to honor their slain master. Dozens of

variants now exist and can be found in the hands of capable

druids as far north as Lurkwood and as far east as the forests

of Cormanthor.

A typical thyrsus of the druid appears as a gnarled staff carved

pine cone mounted securely upon its top. Its shaft is wrapped

in coils of leafy vines that remain green all year round.

WONDROUS ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

The wondrous items of ancient Faern were crafted for a variety

of purposes. The original purpose of each item is given in its

description below, along with its abilities.

Aoxars Helm: Aoxar, the great dwarf hero of Ammarindar,

crafted this open-faced, metal helmet to identify compatriots

in dire need on the battleeld so that he could come to their

aid. It also enabled him to pass along the dying wishes of the

fallen to their families.

The wearer of Aoxars helm can use deathwatch at will and

speak with dead once per day.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item; death-

watch, speak with dead; Price 15,400 gp; Weight 3 lb.

Battlecloak  of  Vycaena:  This  voluminous,  emerald-green

cloak is trimmed with an intricate design done in gold thread.

Each of its two clasps is a golden disk engraved with the crest

of a long-extinct Calishite noble family and set with a small

emerald.

A  battlecloak  of  Vycaena  grants  its  wearer  a  +4  armor

bonus to Armor Class and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving

throws, but its most spectacular power comes from its clasps. On

command, each clasp can store one item in the same manner

as a glove of storing. By touching the clasps (a free action), the

wearer can call the items to her hands instantly.

Faint transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, mage

armor, resistance, shrink item; Price 38,000 gp.

Chylnoths Coronet: Created in the early days of Cormanthyr

by an aquatic elf wizard as a gift for his moon elf lover, this

narrow  circlet  of  silver  is  studded  with  small  aquamarines.

Mounted at the center is a tiny platinum sea cat with a mane

of pure gold.

Chylnoths coronet functions as a helm of underwater action

and allows the wearer to use freedom of movement for up to 1

hour per day, though this time need not be used consecutively. In

addition, the sea cat gurine animates on command as though

it were a gurine of wondrous power. The sea cat (page 220

of the Monster Manual) can be summoned twice a week and

remains for up to 6 hours per use.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item,

animate object, freedom of movement, water breathing; Price

100,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Giiraegisir:  These  ivory  cameos  were  popular  among  the

wealthy citizens of Myth Drannor at the citys height. Giirae-

gisirs vary considerably in appearance based on the house of

the original owner and the aesthetics of the creator. Each is

basically an oval, ivory cameo with a metal pin on the back to

secure it to the wearers clothing. The ivory surface is engraved

with some sign or glyph (a house insignia, a portrait of a loved

one, or the like), and hidden within the setting (Search DC 20)

is a small compartment that can hold an item of up to 2 cubic

inches in size.

The cameo is afxed to the setting via a small, sliding track.

Pulling the ivory cameo down on its track (a free action) grants

the wearer a +5 deection bonus to AC for 1 minute. This ability

can be used once per day for the typical giiraegisir, but a few

have a superior version of the effect that allows three uses per

day of this function.

Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, shield

of faith; Price 10,800 gp (1/day) or 21,600 gp (3/day).

Golden Orb of Siluvanede: During the heady days of Silu-

vanede, sun elves from the greater noble houses crafted arcane

orbs that offered protection against an enemys initial magical

assault. These items, called golden orbs of Siluvanede, could be

carried by their owners or suspended from delicate chains and

worn like pendants. Some were even enspelled to oat around

their owners in a manner similar to that of ioun stones.

Each  orb  is  a  1-inch-diameter  sphere  of  purest  gold  im-

printed with the house symbol of a noble Siluvanedenn family.

These orbs were so expensive to make that each noble house

possessed only one, which was traditionally carried by its eldest

member.

A golden orb of Siluvanede contains a Siluvanedenn abjura-

tion spell very similar to Elminsters effulgent epurationPG. The

protection offered is continuous, although the orb can absorb

and negate only one spell or spell-like ability that targets its

owner each day. The wearer can choose whether or not to let

the orb absorb a particular effect, although he gains no special

knowledge or insight that allows him to identify an incoming

spell before making this decision.

When Eaerlann and Sharrven conquered Siluvanede, most

of the golden orbs were conscated and placed within secure

vaults. Many of the newly released Siluvanedenn feyri now seek

to reclaim their stolen ancestral treasures.

Strong  abjuration;  CL  17th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

Elminsters effulgent epuration; Price 30,600 gp.

Harness of Armor: Created by wizards from the sweltering

desert  land  of  Calimshan,  these  simple  crossed  baldrics  of

leather and chainmail provide all the benets of wearing armor

with none of the problems that a metal shell can cause in the

scorching  sun.  A  harness  of  armor  functions  like  bracers  of

armor but occupies the same space on the body as a vest, thus

freeing the wearer to use other types of magic bracers.

Moderate  conjuration;  CL  7th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

mage armor, creators caster level must be at least two times

the bonus placed in the harness; Price 1,500 gp (+1), 6,000 gp

(+2), 12,500 gp (+3), 24,000 gp (+4), 37,500 gp (+5), 54,000

(+6), 73,500 gp (+7), 96,000 gp (+8); Weight 1 lb.

Orb of Tempests: An orb of tempests is a scrying device made

from a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. It functions

like a crystal ball (see page 253 of the Dungeon Masters Guide),

allowing  the  use  of  the  spell  scrying (Will  DC  16  negates).

In addition, the viewer can produce a control weather effect

once per day. This effect is centered on the person or locale

the viewer can see in the crystal ball at the time this ability

is invoked.

The  art  of  making  an  orb  of  tempests  was  a  closely  held

secret of the Illuskan wizards, so only a handful of the devices

exist today. An orb of tempests is an especially potent defensive

tool for the defenders of a port city, since the owner can detect

hostile eets long before they approach and sink them in a erce

gale that seems to spring from nowhere.

Strong  transmutation;  CL  13th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

scrying, control weather; Price 85,000 gp.

Telkiira: Telkiiras are powerful lore-gems worn by the leaders

of the mightiest elf clans. Each telkiira holds the knowledge,

skills,  and  sometimes  even  a  fragment  of  personality  from

each of the elves who previously wore it. Only a few of these

devices  survived  the  destruction  of  Myth  Drannor  and  the

other fallen elven realms, and most of those that remain are

jealously guarded by their houses. At least a few have made their

way into the hands of other creatures over the millennia.

When placed on the forehead of an elf, a telkiira confers

the following benets.

The wearer gains a +4 insight bonus on Will saves.

The wearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.

A telkiira contains 10 ranks in each of four different Intel-

ligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skills. Among the most

common skills available from a telkiira are Decipher Script,

Knowledge  (arcana),  Knowledge  (history),  and  Spellcraft.

When making a check involving one of the telkiiras skills,

the wearer can use either the devices ranks in that skill or

his own, whichever is higher. He uses his own ability modier

for any skill check using the telkiiras ranks.

Orb of Tempests: An orb of tempests is a scrying device made

from a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. It functions

like a crystal ball (see page 253 of the Dungeon Masters Guide),

allowing  the  use  of  the  spell  scrying (Will  DC  16  negates).

In addition, the viewer can produce a control weather effect

once per day. This effect is centered on the person or locale

the viewer can see in the crystal ball at the time this ability

is invoked.

The  art  of  making  an  orb  of  tempests  was  a  closely  held

secret of the Illuskan wizards, so only a handful of the devices

exist today. An orb of tempests is an especially potent defensive

tool for the defenders of a port city, since the owner can detect

hostile eets long before they approach and sink them in a erce

gale that seems to spring from nowhere.

scrying, control weather; Price 85,000 gp.

Telkiira: Telkiiras are powerful lore-gems worn by the leaders

of the mightiest elf clans. Each telkiira holds the knowledge,

skills,  and  sometimes  even  a  fragment  of  personality  from

each of the elves who previously wore it. Only a few of these

devices  survived  the  destruction  of  Myth  Drannor  and  the

other fallen elven realms, and most of those that remain are

jealously guarded by their houses. At least a few have made their

way into the hands of other creatures over the millennia.

When placed on the forehead of an elf, a telkiira confers

the following benets.

The wearer gains a +4 insight bonus on Will saves.

The wearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.

A telkiira contains 10 ranks in each of four different Intel-

ligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skills. Among the most

common skills available from a telkiira are Decipher Script,

Knowledge  (arcana),  Knowledge  (history),  and  Spellcraft.

When making a check involving one of the telkiiras skills,

the wearer can use either the devices ranks in that skill or

his own, whichever is higher. He uses his own ability modier

for any skill check using the telkiiras ranks.

ARTIFACTS OF THE PAST

ARTIFACTS OF THE PAST

A telkiira functions as a spellbook that can hold up to 200

pages of spells. A wizard can write a spell into a telkiira

without paying the usual material cost of 25 gp per page,

although he still must take the normal time to do so. A

telkiira is fully erasable, so its owner can remove spells and

replace them with new ones as he sees  t.

A telkiira can hold up to ten distinct memories, each up to

1 hour in length, with perfect clarity. A wearer who accesses

one of these memories experiences it as if she were the person

who recorded it. Writing a memory requires 1 full round,

regardless of its length. Telkiiras often hold important or

treasured memories of their previous owners.

Only an elf or a creature with elf blood (a half-elf, for example)

can wear a telkiira safely. Any other creature that places the

gem on its forehead gains two negative levels and cannot use

any of its abilities. These negative levels remain as long as the

telkiira is worn and disappear as soon as it is removed.

Telkiiras are often locked to prevent unauthorized elves from

enjoying their full bene ts. An elf wearing a locked telkiira

gains none of the bene ts described above except the bonuses

to Intelligence and on Will saves. Any member of the house,

clan, or family that owns a given telkiira can lock or unlock

it as a free action. Any other wearer can attempt a Use Magic

Device check or Charisma check (DC 20 for either) to open a

locked telkiira. Failure means the wearer must wait until he

attains his next level before trying again.

Artifacts

Because  many  of  the  pasts  most  enduring  treasures  surpass

any normal magic, they fall into the categories of minor and

major artifacts. Faerns ancient cultures produced countless

artifacts and relics, most of which are securely locked away by

vigilant owners or buried in places so forgotten or inaccessible

that no one could reach them without undertaking an adventure

of truly epic scope.

Minor Artifacts

Faerns ancient cultures were  lled with magic of great power,

so minor artifacts were much more common than they are in

the current day.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

Some of the most famous artifacts from Faerns ancient lands

are described below.

Mythallar: A mythallar is usually a large, polished crystal

as tall as a man, though it may take other forms as well. Like

a  mythal,  a  mythallar  creates  a  city-sized  envelope  of  pure

magical energy. Unlike a mythal, however, a mythallar always

incorporates a major special ability that permits the creation

and use of quasi-magic items.

Quasi-magic items function exactly like normal magic items

within the bounds of a mythallar but become inert when taken

beyond its borders. The Netherese arcanists who  rst discovered

and used mythallars viewed this restriction as a fair tradeoff,

since the creation cost of any quasi-magic item, no matter how

powerful, included no XP component. (The XP cost of spells

with such components, however, still had to be paid.) This lack

of an XP cost opened up item creation to even low-level spell-

casters and made the creation of vastly powerful, near-artifact

items such as  oating mountaintop enclaves feasible. Without

mythallars, Netheril would never have reached the zenith of

magical power that it achieved.

Overwhelming transmutation; CL 30th; Weight 500 lb.

Nether Scrolls: Two sets of nether scrolls exist, each consist-

ing of  fty individual scrolls. One complete set lies in the depths

of Windsong Tower in the ruins of Myth Drannor, where it

takes the form of a golden beech tree known as the Quess Ar

Teranthvar (Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge). The other

set has been broken up and mostly lost. At least until the Year

of the Moonfall (1344 DR), three scrolls from this latter set

lay in the Hall of Mists beneath the Grandfather Tree of the

High Forest. Two others are in the Crypt of Hssthak, which

now lies beneath the sands of western Anauroch. A few of the

remaining  scrolls  have  been  destroyed,  and  the  location  and

current state of those that remain are unknown.

Each  scroll  is  an  8-inch-by-10-inch  sheet  of  thin,  rolled

gold as  exible as paper. Silvery magical writing crawls across

its surface, appearing almost alive. The scrolls small size belies

the staggering amount of information it holds. As soon as one

page of text has been read, the writing swims and moves about

the sheet, reforming into the next page of text. All in all, it

takes approximately one month of dedicated study to review a

single nether scroll.

The nether scrolls form the foundation of modern magical

theory  on  Faern.  Virtually  every  mage  who  has  mastered

any portion of the Art since the rise of Netheril received her

knowledge,  albeit  indirectly,  from  the  nether  scrolls.  Conse-

quently, much of the information contained in these scrolls is

now considered common knowledge in Faerns magical com-

munity. Nevertheless, the nether scrolls still contain a wealth

of information that is useful to any student of the Art.

Reading even one nether scroll offers considerable insight

into the Art. Any character studying one immediately gains

one level in an arcane spellcasting class of her choice. (That

is, her experience point total is set to the midpoint for her

new level.)

The nether scrolls are divided into  ve chapters, each cover-

ing a different aspect of the Art. A character who manages to

read all ten scrolls that make up a chapter gains an additional

bene t whose nature depends on the topic studied. The chapters

of the nether scrolls and the bene ts they provide are detailed

below.

Arcanus  Fundare  (Foundations  of  Magic):  +30  inherent

bonus  on  Spellcraft  checks;  +1  to  save  DCs  for  all  arcane

spells.

Magicus  Creare  (Spells  of  Creation):  Three  bonus  item

creation feats; XP cost of any magic item created drops to 75%

of normal.

Maior Creare (Major Creations): Craft Construct (see page

303 of the Monster Manual) as a bonus feat; any golem or

other construct created has maximum hit points.

Planus Mechanus (Studies of the Planes): Use plane shift as

the spell once per day; ignore any hostile or debilitating planar

environmental effects.

Ars  Factum  (Of  the  Creation  of  Artifacts):  Unknown.

Reputedly, this chapter of the nether scrolls taught the reader

how to create artifacts. However, an additional key

of some kind is needed to unlock this set of

scrolls, and the spellcasters of Windsong

Tower never discovered it.

Artifacts

The ancient cultures of Faern

produced many major artifacts,

but only a few have reappeared

in the modern day.

ARTIFACT

DESCRIPTIONS

The  following  unique  items  are

major artifacts.

Dragontear  Crown  of  Sharrven:  The

Dragontear Crown of Sharrven is a delicate

diadem  made  of  thin  mithral  chains  adorned  with  tiny  dia-

monds. A large kings tear containing the image of a majestic

silver  dragon  hangs  from  the  center,  where  it  can  grace  the

wearers brow.

The Dragontear Crown of Sharrven has the properties of a

greenstone amulet, and it protects the wearer as a mind blank

spell. The wearer also gains a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws

against necromancy effects or any effect that would transport

her to another locale or dimension. If such an effect normally

does not allow a saving throw (the maze spell, for example),

the wearer can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effect.

Finally, the Dragontear Crown of Sharrven renders the wearer

immune to magical and nonmagical fear and enables her to

speak, understand, and write Draconic.

Elfblades  of  Cormanthyr:  These  three  legendary  swords

were  forged  thousands  of  years  ago  when  the  great  empire

of Cormanthyr was founded. One of them was forged for the

coronal  (ruler)  of  Cormanthyr,  one  for  the  arms-major  (the

chief warrior of the empire), and the third for the spell-major

(the empires chief wizard). All three swords have since been

losttwo  around  the  time  of  Myth

Drannors fall, and the third many

centuries  before.  Restoring  even

one  of  the  elfblades  to  the  elves,

let alone all three, would earn an

adventurer the everlasting friend-

ship  and  thanks  of  the  residents

of the Elven Courtparticularly

now that the drow have invaded

the very heart of Cormanthor.

All  three  elfblades  insist

upon choosing their own wield-

ers. Each has its own criteria for

making the choice and punishes

unworthy candidates in its own

way, but to wield any elfblade,

a  character  must  be  of  good

alignment  and  at  least  15th

level.

A  character  wishing  to

become  the  wielder  of  an  elf-

blade must grasp the hilt with

the  rm intent of bonding with

the weapon and draw it from

its sheath. Whether successful

or not, the attempt costs 2,500

XP.  Each  weapons  description

suggests  some  guidelines  on

which  it  bases  its  acceptance

or  rejection  of  a  candidate,

but  the   nal  decision  belongs

to the DM. A character deemed

unworthy to wield an elfblade

is  subjected  to  that  weapons

unique form of punishment, as

given in its description below.

Upon acceptance by an elfblade, the char-

acter becomes attuned to it and can summon it to his hand

as a free action, as long as it is somewhere on the same plane.

Once an elfblade has bonded with a character, it remains bound

until the characters death, or until he commits some grievous

sin against either his alignment or the elf people. In such a

case, the blade punishes him as though he had failed to bond

with it in the  rst place unless he makes an immediate effort

to atone for his sin.

Each of the elfblades shares several properties in common

with the others and also has its own set of unique abilities usable

only by its chosen wielder. All are +4 holy keen longswords, and

The elfblades of Cormanthyr:

the Crownblade, the Warblade,

and the Artblade

in gold at the seat of the blade, just above the quillions. Arcor

Kerym glows with golden light that crackles along its surface

like an arc of lightning.

The Crownblade was last seen in 666 DR, when the Srinshee

vanished with it after using its potent magic to rebuild the Rule

Tower. Scholars believe that the Crownblade was aware of the

citys impending fall, so it removed itself and the Srinshee from

Faern to ensure that it would not fall into the hands of the

Army of Darkness. If this theory is correct, Arvandor seems

a likely resting place for Arcor Kerym.

In  addition  to  the  standard  powers  of  an  elfblade,  the

Crownblade allows its wielder to access the mystical knowledge

of three elven high mages, as stored in the three gems that

decorate its crossguards and pommel. This in ux of knowledge

grants the wielder a +10 bonus on all Knowledge (arcana) and

Spellcraft checks and a +5 bonus on all other Knowledge checks.

In addition, by speaking a command word, the wielder of Arcor

Kerym can use heal as the spell three times per day, or discern

lies as the spell at will.

Arcor Kerym is the strictest of the elfblades when it comes

to evaluating a prospective wielder. The candidate must be of

lawful good alignment and must have the good of Corman-

thyr and the elf people as his highest priority. In addition, a

character who seeks to wield the Crownblade should have high

ranks in Diplomacy, Sense Motive, and other social interaction

skills.

The penalty for an unworthy character who attempts to bond

with Arcor Kerym is as straightforward as it is  nalhe is

consumed by golden  re, which burns him away to nothingness

in 1 round (Fort DC 23 partial; success means the subject takes

40d6 points of damage instead). A character found unworthy

and  subsequently  brought  back  from  the  dead  still  loses  the

2,500 XP for attempting the attuning ritual.

Aryvelahr Kerym, the Warblade: The blade of this long-

sword shines like polished silver, remaining perfectly re ective

no matter what punishments it endures. Blue and silver  ames

lick incessantly along the blade, quillions, and pommel, and they

harmlessly  surround  the  wielders  hands  whenever  the  blade

is drawn. At the seat of the blade is an Elven rune meaning

weapon, which is commonly used as a sword mark.

When Lord Orym Hawksong fell in battle at the siege of

the Twisted Tower in the Year of Shadows Fleeting (331 DR),

the Warblade sprang up and defended him  ercely for a time.

Eventually, however, the drow managed to paralyze the blade

by magic, and both the great hero and his arcane sword were

lost in the darkness beneath the Twisted Tower. In the centuries

since, hundreds of elves have sought Aryvelahr Kerym, but no

one has found it.

In addition to the standard powers of an elfblade, the War-

blade enables its wielder to conjure a blade barrier, as the spell,

once per day. In addition, the wielder can utilize bulls strength

as the spell three times per day and detect evil and detect good

as the spells at will.

To wield the Warblade, a character must be of chaotic good

alignment. In addition, the blade seeks a wielder with martial

skill (that is, a base attack bonus of at least +12), a high Cha-

risma, and leadership ability. If the Warblade deems an elf who

attempts the attuning ritual unworthy, it turns in his hand,

making a single attack (+29 melee, damage 1d8+11/1720). If

the would-be wielder is not an elf or half-elf, or has an evil

alignment,  the  Warblade  attacks  furiously  for  2d6  rounds

(+29/+24/+19/+14  melee,  damage  1d8+11/1720).  Magical

healing of the wounds in icted on an unworthy candidate is

possible only with a successful DC 25 caster level check.

Aryfaern  Kerym,  the  Artblade:  This  longsword  appears

to have been forged from solid darkness. Its blade is a void of

nonre ective blackness that feels as solid as stone yet as slick as

oil. Along the razor-sharp, beveled edge of the blade glows a thin,

crimson line of energy that encloses the darknessthe source of

the elfblades magical light. When drawn, the Artblade crackles

like lightning breaking across a metal shield, and when swung,

it emits a sharp, buzzing sound similar to that of an angry bee

(though the wielder can mute this latter sound if desired). When

struck  against  objects  or  weapons,  the  blades  clash  is  utterly

silent, no matter how much strength powers the blow. Embossed

in glowing crimson on the base of the dark blade is an Elven

rune often used to signify a work of high magic.

The Artblade was lost at the Battle of Stars Shining in 714

DR, when Spell-Major Josidiah Starym sacri ced himself to

break the army of yugoloths storming the school of magic in

the city of Myth Drannor. With his forces overwhelmed and

nearly defeated, the spell-major cast a spell of terrible power

that consumed most of the yugoloths and much of the school

in a pure white  ame. When the  ames died, no trace of the

spell-major  or  his  sword  remained.  Some  sages  believe  that

both were transported to Dweomerheart or Arvandor, but no

evidence exists to support these theories.

In  addition  to  the  standard  abilities  of  an  elfblade,  the

Artblade  allows  its  user  to  cast  any  spell  using  the  swords

power rather than the traditional spellcasting methods. Any

spell the wielder casts while wielding the Artblade automatically

gains the bene ts of the Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew

Materials feats with no increase to the spell level or casting

time. In addition, the wielders effective caster level increases

by 1 for evocation spells. The Artblades wielder can also use

greater dispel magic as the spell three times per day and detect

magic as the spell at will.

The  Artblade  requires  its  wielder  to  be  neutral  good  in

alignment and able to cast 8th-level arcane spells. In addition,

it desires a wielder with a passion for magic and a sel ess love of

Cormanthyr and the elf people. A candidate deemed unworthy

by the Artblade becomes temporarily divorced from the Weave

The Imaskarcana: The seven diverse artifacts collectively

known as the Imaskarcana were the mightiest of the magic

weapons and devices created by the ancient Imaskari. Two of

these itemsthe  rst and the  fthreportedly lie buried in the

ruins of Inupras, the capital city of the Imaskari Empire.

First Imaskar cana: Crafted by an ancient Lord

Arti cer  of  Inupras  more  than  nine

thousand years ago, the First Imaskar-

cana is a crudely wrought, crenellated

crown forged from a strange,

lavender-tinted metal. Though

it  was  created  for  humans

to  wear,  it  also   ts  snugly

when placed on the heads

of  other  Medium  hu-

manoids.  A  blue-black

star  sapphire  about  3

inches in diameter rests

squarely at the front of

the crown.

The First Imas-

karcana quickly became

a symbol of the supreme

authority  wielded  by

the  Imaskari  emperors.

Lord  Arti cer  Yuvaraj

was  wearing  it  when  he

perished in battle against

the manifested god Horus.

The  artifact  is  believed  to

lie deep under the sands in the

ruins of Inupras, not far from the

imperial palace.

Anyone who wears the First Imas-

karcana gains spell resistance 30 and

is protected by a spell turning effect

that  can  turn  10  levels  of  divine  magic  in

a 24-hour period. Once it has reached its

capacity,  the  First  Imaskarcana  cannot

turn spells again for 24 hours.

The First Imaskarcana also holds

the collected knowledge of the empires lord arti cers and can

answer many questions concerning Imaskari customs, politics,

and magic. It does not engage in conversation, however, and

offers only the briefest answers to direct questions (+20 bonus

on Knowledge [history] checks regarding Imaskar only).

In addition, any wearer of the crown can use the following

spell-like abilities: 3/dayantimagic auraMag, improved blinkUna,

legend lore (Imaskari items only), greater teleport, true seeing;

1/daygate. Caster level 18th.

The crowns spell resistance and spell turning abilities are

always  active,  except  as  noted  above.  Any  other  power  must

be  commanded  to  function  as  a  standard  action.  The  crown

responds only to commands spoken in Roushoum, the ancient

language of Imaskar. If a command is issued in any other lan-

guage, the wearer instantly becomes the target of a feeblemind

effect (Will DC 20 negates).

Fifth Imaskarcana: Forged some eight thousand  ve hundred

years ago, this scepter was traditionally carried into battle by

the High General of Imaskars armies. The  nal bearer of the

Fifth Imaskarcana was Lord Dimarond, the last general of

Imaskar, who fell outside Inupras before an enraged throng

led by glorious servitors.

The  Fifth  Imaskarcana

is a pitted, battered-looking

scepter  about  2  feet  long

and 2 inches in diameter. A

crudely cut amethyst the size

of  a  human   st  crowns  its

bronze haft.

The  Fifth  Imas-

karcana  contains  the

entire  military  history

of Imaskar from 7500

DR  onward.  It

Anyone  who  wields

the  Fifth  Imaskarcana

gains  spell  resistance  26

and  can  use  the  following

spell-like  abilities:  3/day

The First and

Fifth Imaskarcana

hold monster, power word stun. Caster level 18th.

The scepters spell resistance is always active. Any other power

must be commanded to function as a standard action. Like the

First  Imaskarcana,  the  scepter  responds  only  to  commands

spoken  in  Roushoum,  the  ancient  language  of  Imaskar.  If  a

command is issued in any other language, the wielder instantly

ARTIFACTS OF THE PAST

ARTIFACTS OF THE PAST

all retard the aging process so that the wielder ages only 1 year

for every 2 years that pass while he possesses the elfblade.

Arcor  Kerym,  the  Crownblade:  Also  called  the  Rulers

Blade, this sword appears to be made of raw iron and has a

pitted and craggy surface. From afar, it looks like a longsword

carved from stone. An ancient Elven crown rune is stamped

in gold at the seat of the blade, just above the quillions. Arcor

Monsters of the

Ancient Lands

The ruins of Faerns fallen empires are home to

uncounted numbers of monsters. Characters who

dare  to  explore  the  ruins  of  the  past  must  face

ancient undead, predatory vermin, mysterious constructs, terrify-

ing monstrosities, and demons summoned and bound to guard

long-abandoned strongholds.

This chapter presents a number of monsters commonly en-

countered in or around the ruins and desolate regions left behind

when empires crumble into sand.

Arachnids, Giant

Giant  arachnids  are  related  to  the  monstrous  spiders  and

scorpions described in the Monster Manual. Though they are

neither as widespread nor as prone to species and size variations

as their more common cousins, giant arachnids are frequently

encountered  in  and  near  drow  settlements  in  the  Underdark,

where they are occasionally tamed and used as beasts of burden

and war. Though scorpions are not considered spiderkind, giant

whip spiders, giant whip scorpions, and giant sun spiders do fall

into that category. All three are particularly susceptible to many

forms of drow magic.

Combat

All three giant arachnids  ght by grabbing opponents and then

squeezing  and  biting  them  to  death.  They  have  the  following

special abilities in common.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  giant  arachnid

must hit an opponent that is at least one size category smaller

than itself with a claw attack.

Giant arachnids

About the size of an ogre, this spider has a long,  at body and

six spindly legs. Two more legs held close to the creatures mouth

end in spiny pincers. Two long, whiplike appendages emerge from

its body just behind its pincer-legs, and a third stretches up from

the rear of its abdomen.

A giant whip scorpion measures between 8 and 12 feet long and

weighs about 500 pounds. It is sometimes called a monstrous

uropygid, or occasionally a giant vinegaroon because of its acidic

spray.

COMBAT

Like other giant arachnids, giant whip scorpions attack with their

pincers, squeezing and biting any opponents they can grab. They

use their poison spray to escape danger.

Poison Spray (Ex): Three times per day, a giant whip scorpion

can discharge a 20-foot-diameter spread of noxious vapor centered

on itself. This cloud functions as an inhaled poison (Fortitude

DC 14; initial and secondary damage 1d4 Dex). The save DC is

Constitution-based.

MONSTERS OF THE ANCIENT LANDS

The ruins of Faerns fallen empires are home to

uncounted numbers of monsters. Characters who

dare  to  explore  the  ruins  of  the  past  must  face

ancient undead, predatory vermin, mysterious constructs, terrify-

ing monstrosities, and demons summoned and bound to guard

long-abandoned strongholds.

This chapter presents a number of monsters commonly en-

countered in or around the ruins and desolate regions left behind

when empires crumble into sand.

Arachnids, Giant

Giant  arachnids  are  related  to  the  monstrous  spiders  and

scorpions described in the Monster Manual. Though they are

neither as widespread nor as prone to species and size variations

as their more common cousins, giant arachnids are frequently

encountered  in  and  near  drow  settlements  in  the  Underdark,

where they are occasionally tamed and used as beasts of burden

and war. Though scorpions are not considered spiderkind, giant

whip spiders, giant whip scorpions, and giant sun spiders do fall

into that category. All three are particularly susceptible to many

forms of drow magic.

Combat

All three giant arachnids  ght by grabbing opponents and then

squeezing  and  biting  them  to  death.  They  have  the  following

special abilities in common.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  giant  arachnid

must hit an opponent that is at least one size category smaller

than itself with a claw attack.

Squeeze (Ex): A giant arachnid that gets a hold on an op-

ponent of its own size category or smaller automatically deals

damage with both claws and can make a bite attack at its highest

attack bonus.

Vermin Traits: A giant arachnid is immune to all mind-af-

fecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and

morale effects). It also has darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: A giant arachnid receives a +4 racial bonus on Climb,

Hide, and Spot checks.

Though it resembles a spider, this creature is

the size of a rhinoceros and the color of a camel. Its segmented,

hairy body sprouts ten legs. The two front legs are thicker than

the rest and end in small pincers. The head is dominated by two

gigantic mandibles, and two bulging, black eyes gaze malevolently

outward.

Giant sun spiders can most easily be distinguished from Large

monstrous spiders by their coloration, which ranges from brown

to yellow. A giant sun spider is about 10 feet in diameter and

weighs approximately 250 pounds.

Sages call these creatures monstrous solifugids or monstrous

solpugids. Less educated people sometimes call them giant camel

spiders or giant false spiders.

COMBAT

Because they lack the developed pincers of the other giant arach-

nids, giant sun spiders have weaker claw attacks, though they still

use their grasping claws in the same manner. A giant sun spiders

fearsome bite makes up for its underdeveloped pincers.

Baneguard

A skeleton clutches a longsword tightly in one bony hand.

The clerics of Bane  rst developed the method of creating

baneguards and kept it secret for many years, but the technique

has long since spread to other evil faiths. The Thayan branch

of Banes church is especially fond of creating baneguards, and

these creatures serve as temple guardians in Thayan trading

enclaves  throughout  Faern.  Because

they  are  also  quite  popular  among  the

followers of Velsharoon, demigod of liches,

baneguards are found in great numbers in

Skull Gorge and the Battle of Bones, at the

southwestern tip of Anauroch.

Baneguard

Baneguards look exactly like ordinary animated

skeletons.  Only  their  magical  powers  set

them apart from their lesser cousins.

A cleric of at least 14th level can create

a baneguard using the create undead spell.

COMBAT

Baneguards are silent but intelligent ser-

vants of evil masters. These vile undead

are  capable  of  independent,  reasoned,

malevolent  behavior.  They  can   ght

with  any  weapon  or  strike  with

their hands.

Undead Traits: A baneguard is immune to

mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to

extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage

to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised,

and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out

to 60 feet.

Direguard

A Thayan improvement on the original baneguard, the direguard

has both a more sinister appearance and greater magical power

than its lesser cousin. A direguard is surrounded by a shadowy,

translucent  eld of force resembling black armor and red  ames

smoldering in its eye sockets.

A cleric of at least 16th level can create a direguard using the

create undead spell.

A  scrabbling  swarm  of  human-

looking  hands  skitters  on   ngertips

toward its prey.

Adventurers  destroy  these  min-

iature  menaces  by  the  dozen,  all

the  while  praying,  Let  this  never

be me.

Crawling  claws  are  the  amputated

hands of Medium and Small humanoids

given  arti cial  life  by  arcane  magic.

They have two major advantages

over undead and magic servi-

tors of larger size: They are

easy to smuggle and easy to

hide. Furthermore, at least

for  most  necromancers,

the materials to construct

them are near at hand.

These creatures propel

themselves  either  by

walking  on  their   n-

gers  or  via  aberrant

muscle spasms that can

propel  them  through

the air up to 6 feet high.

They magically see and

hear as if they had the

sensory  organs  of  the

humanoids they used to

belong to, but their senses are dull. Crawling claws are generally

too stupid to be assigned unsupervised tasks more complicated

than guard duty.

Smite Fallen (Ex): A swarm of crawling claws deals double

damage against prone combatants.

Construct Traits: A crawling claw has immunity to poison,

sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,  disease,  death  effects,  necro-

mancy  effects,  mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale  effects),  and  any  effect  that

requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on  objects  or  is

harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits,

nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaus-

tion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage but can be repaired.

It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Sightless (Ex): Crawling claws are immune

to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and

other attack forms that rely on sight.

Swarm  Traits:  A  swarm  has

no  clear  front  or  back  and

no  discernible  anatomy,

so  it  is  not  subject

to extra damage from

critical hits or  anking.

A  swarm  of  crawling

claws takes half damage

from piercing or slash-

ing weapons.

Reducing  a  swarm

to 0 or fewer hit points

causes  it  to  break  up,

though  damage  taken

until  that  point  does

not  degrade  its  abil-

ity  to  attack  or  resist

attack.  Swarms  are

never  staggered  or  re-

duced  to  a  dying  state  by

damage.  Also,  they  cannot  be

tripped,  grappled,  or  bull  rushed,  and

Crawling claw

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets

a  speci c  number  of  creatures  (including  single-target

spells such as disintegrate). A swarm takes half again as much

damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such

as many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons.

Combat

Crawling claws attack in a swarm, taking advantage of their small

size to gang up on a single opponent rather than trying to  ght

multiple foes at the same time.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to  the

swarms damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square

is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 12 Fortitude save negates the

effect. Even with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating

on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration

check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills requiring patience and

concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration check. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Creation

A swarm of crawling claws is created from the hands of three

hundred Medium or Small humanoids. No assembly is required,

but the hands must be treated with unguents worth 250 gp. In

addition to the hands, creating a crawling claw swarm requires

casting a spell with the evil descriptor.

CL 7th; Craft Construct, animate dead, cats grace, lesser geas,

caster must be at least 7th level; Price 18,000 gp; Cost 9,250 gp

+ 710 XP.

Curst

Cursts are undead humanoids trapped under a curse that will

not let them die. They are created when an evil spellcaster casts

bestow curse on a dying subject, then uses create undead or create

greater undead to grant the victim undeath.

The skin of a curst pales to an eerie white pallor. The whites

of its eyes turn black and the color of the iris deepens, so that

its eyes become small pools of glinting darkness. Cursts favor

dark-colored clothing and wear cloaks and hoods to disguise their

undead status while walking among the living. They prefer dark-

ness to light and tend not to speak unless absolutely necessary.

A curst is not controlled by its creator, and it seldom chooses

to serve any master who does not offer an escape from its undead

condition. In addition, the transformation into an undead being

causes some cursts to go slightly mad, reducing their effective-

ness as servitors. A remove curse effect destroys a curst,

causing it to crumble into dust.

A curst speaks whatever languages it knew in life.

Sample Curst

This  white-skinned  warrior  has  tortured  eyes

that  re ect  the  pain  of  his  terrible  undead

existence. He wears a heavy black cloak over

his leather armor and carries an ancient

bastard sword in his hands.

This  example  curst  uses  a  5th-level

human  ghter as the base creature.

Its ability scores before its transfor-

MONSTERS OF THE ANCIENT LANDS

Armor Class: The cursts natural armor bonus improves by

3 over that of the base creature.

Attack: A curst retains all the attacks of the base creature

and also gains a slam attack if it didnt already have one. If

the base creature can use weapons, the curst retains this ability.

A curst ghting without weapons uses either its slam attack

or its primary natural weapon (if it has any) when making

an attack action. When it has a weapon, it usually uses that

instead.

Full Attack: A curst ghting without weapons uses either its

slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If

armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary

attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural

secondary attack.

Damage: A curst has a slam attack. If the base creature does

not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from

the table below according to the cursts size. A creature that has

other kinds of natural weapons retains its old damage values or

uses  the  appropriate  value  from  the  table  below,  whichever  is

better.

Special Qualities: A curst retains all the special qualities of

the base creature and gains those described below.

Fast Healing (Ex): A curst heals 1 point of damage each round

so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 or fewer hit

points, it falls to the ground paralyzed, and its fast healing stops.

After 1 hour, the curst makes a DC 20 level check. If the check

succeeds, the curst regains 1 hit point, its fast healing resumes,

and it is no longer paralyzed. If the check fails, the curst must

make another check at the same DC 24 hours later, and every

24 hours thereafter until it succeeds and begins to recover hit

points again. Thus, even a dismembered curst eventually recovers

from its injuries.

Immunity to Cold and Fire (Ex): A curst takes no damage

from cold or re attacks.

Madness  (Ex):  A  curst  whose  Wisdom  score  is  1  or  2  is

aficted with bouts of madness. In combat, it has a 5% chance

each round to behave erratically. On any round when this occurs,

the curst takes no action.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A curst has spell resistance equal to 12

+ its character level.

Turning Immunity (Ex): Cursts cannot be turned, rebuked,

destroyed, or commanded.

Unkillable  (Ex):  Only  two  ways  exist  to  destroy  a  curst

permanently. One is to destroy its body (by total immersion in

acid, or a disintegrate or undeath to death spell, for example).

The  other  is  to  remove  the  curse  that  keeps  it  from  dying.

The caster of the remove curse spell must succeed on a caster

level check (DC 10 + the cursts HD) to successfully remove

the curse.

Abilities: Change from the base creature as follows: Str +2,

Int 4 (minimum 3), Wis 6 (minimum 1), Cha 2 (minimum

1). As an undead creature, a curst has no Constitution score. A

curst whose Wisdom score is reduced to 1 or 2 gains the madness

special quality (see above).

Skills: Same as the base creature. Do not reduce existing skill

ranks  because  of  the  drop  in  Intelligence,  but  apply  the  new

Intelligence  modier  normally  to  any  Intelligence-based  skill

checks and to the number of skill points gained when the curst

gains new levels.

Organization: Solitary.

and it has six large, strong tentacles up to 20 feet long. Three

of these arms are dexterous enough to wield weapons favored

by humanoids (such as axes or maces), and the other three

end  in  toothy  jaws.  Dozens  of  long,  retractable  eyestalks

cover the creatures body. A deepspawn weighs about 28,000

pounds.

Deepspawn  speak  Aquan,  Common,  Draconic,  Giant,  and

Undercommon. They use their tentacle-mouths for speech, and

their voices sound like horrible, high-pitched piping.

Combat

Deepspawn are voracious creatures that crave intelligent prey.

Despite their bulk and bizarre appearance, they are highly intel-

ligent  and  patient  opponents.  They  frequently  dispatch  their

spawned minions to lure new victims to their lairs with promises

of wealth and magic.

A  deepspawn  usually  wields  three  weapons  sized  for

Medium creatures in its manipulative tentacles and bites with

the jaws on its feeding tentacles. The deepspawn described in

the  statistics  block  above  is  armed  with  a  +1 battleaxe  and

two  morningstars,  but  other  deepspawn  may  possess  other

weapons. A deepspawn is procient with all simple and martial

weapons.

An opponent can attack a deepspawns tentacles as if they

were weapons (see Sunder in Chapter 8 of the Players Hand-

book). Each of a deepspawns tentacles has 20 hit points. If the

deepspawn is currently grappling an opponent with the tentacle

under attack, it usually uses another limb to make its attack

of opportunity. Severing a deepspawns tentacle deals 10 points

of damage to the creature. A deepspawn regrows any severed

tentacles in 1d10+10 days.

Deepspawn often ght from the cover of foul pools or mounds

of slippery, shifting coins.

Constrict (Ex): A deepspawn deals automatic bite damage

with  a  successful  grapple  check.  An  arm  that  is  currently

being  used  to  constrict  an  opponent  cannot  also  make  bite

attacks.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the deepspawn must

hit with a bite attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and can constrict.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect thoughts, water breathing

(self only); 3/dayhold monster (DC 15); 1/dayheal (self only).

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spawn (Ex): A deepspawn is usually encountered with one

to  three  of  its  spawnmonsters  of  CR  4  to  6.  Spawn  are

fanatically  loyal  to  the  deepspawn  that  spawned  them  and

willingly ght to the death to defend it. To determine what

kind of spawn accompanies any given deepspawn, roll d% and

consult Table 111.

A  bloated,  spherical  abomination  slithers  along  on  six  thick

tentacles. Its surface is dotted with dozens of staring yellow eyes.

Three of its tentacles grip weapons usually wielded by humanoids,

while the other three end in eyeless jaws that snap and slaver.

The deepspawn is a horror of the Underdarka subterranean

monstrosity  that  routinely  spawns  many  other  varieties  of

monsters. A single deepspawn can make a vast area dangerous

even for alert, well-armed adventurers.

A deepspawn appears to be a rough, rubbery sphere about

15 feet in diameter. Its hide is mottled with purple and brown,

Deepspawn

and it has six large, strong tentacles up to 20 feet long. Three

of these arms are dexterous enough to wield weapons favored

by humanoids (such as axes or maces), and the other three

end  in  toothy  jaws.  Dozens  of  long,  retractable  eyestalks

cover the creatures body. A deepspawn weighs about 28,000

pounds.

Deepspawn  speak  Aquan,  Common,  Draconic,  Giant,  and

Undercommon. They use their tentacle-mouths for speech, and

their voices sound like horrible, high-pitched piping.

Combat

Deepspawn are voracious creatures that crave intelligent prey.

Despite their bulk and bizarre appearance, they are highly intel-

ligent  and  patient  opponents.  They  frequently  dispatch  their

spawned minions to lure new victims to their lairs with promises

of wealth and magic.

A  deepspawn  usually  wields  three  weapons  sized  for

Medium creatures in its manipulative tentacles and bites with

the jaws on its feeding tentacles. The deepspawn described in

the  statistics  block  above  is  armed  with  a  +1 battleaxe  and

two  morningstars,  but  other  deepspawn  may  possess  other

weapons. A deepspawn is procient with all simple and martial

weapons.

An opponent can attack a deepspawns tentacles as if they

were weapons (see Sunder in Chapter 8 of the Players Hand-

book). Each of a deepspawns tentacles has 20 hit points. If the

deepspawn is currently grappling an opponent with the tentacle

under attack, it usually uses another limb to make its attack

of opportunity. Severing a deepspawns tentacle deals 10 points

of damage to the creature. A deepspawn regrows any severed

tentacles in 1d10+10 days.

Deepspawn often ght from the cover of foul pools or mounds

of slippery, shifting coins.

Constrict (Ex): A deepspawn deals automatic bite damage

with  a  successful  grapple  check.  An  arm  that  is  currently

being  used  to  constrict  an  opponent  cannot  also  make  bite

attacks.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the deepspawn must

hit with a bite attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and can constrict.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect thoughts, water breathing

(self only); 3/dayhold monster (DC 15); 1/dayheal (self only).

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spawn (Ex): A deepspawn is usually encountered with one

to  three  of  its  spawnmonsters  of  CR  4  to  6.  Spawn  are

fanatically  loyal  to  the  deepspawn  that  spawned  them  and

willingly ght to the death to defend it. To determine what

kind of spawn accompanies any given deepspawn, roll d% and

consult Table 111.

A deepspawn can spawn only creatures identical to those

it  has  physically  consumed.  Each  spawn  possesses  even

the learned abilities (such as class level, skills, and

Somewhere between an ogre and a minotaur in appearance, this

20-foot-tall creature would tower over either one. Its hide is thick

and hairy, its features bestial, and its body powerfully muscled.

Two enormous horns jut from its skull, and its feet are massive

hooves. A choking aura of evil surrounds it.

The  monstrous  demons  known

as  ghours  serve  the  Abyssal  lord

Baphomet and work their masters

will among the minotaurs, ogres,

and  renegade  giants  that  serve

him.  Ghours  can  be  found  among

any  group  of  chaotic  evil  giants,

ogres, or minotaurs. These creatures

view a ghours presence as a sign of

Baphomets great pleasure.

Ghours  speak  Abyssal  and

Giant.

A

Combat

ghour  charges  into  combat

like  a  rampaging  elephant,

pummeling  opponents  with

its   sts  and  goring  with  its

ghour likes to enter combat

with  a  roar,  a  blast  of  its

breath weapon, or both.

Breath Weapon (Su): Once

per minute, a ghour can breathe

a cloud of noxious gas 10 feet wide,

10 feet high, and 30 feet long. Each

creature caught within this cloud must make a

DC 24 Re ex save or take 1d6 points of Strength

Combat

Dreads attack relentlessly as ordered by their creator. The nec-

aura of supernatural fear.

Frightful Presence (Su): Any creature with 2 or fewer HD

within 30 feet of a dread must succeed on a DC 12 Will save

or become shaken for 2d6 rounds. A creature that is already

shaken  (by  the  frightful  presence  of

a second dread, for example) becomes

frightened  instead.  If  the  creature  is

already  frightened,  the  dreads  frightful

presence produces no further effect. A suc-

cessful save renders the creature immune to that

dreads frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful

presence is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC

is Wisdom-based.

Undead  Traits:  A  dread  is  immune  to  mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it

also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra

damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to

its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised,

and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision

out to 60 feet.

Weapon Use (Ex): A Medium dread can use weapons sized for

Medium creatures with no penalty, since its arms are roughly

the same size as those of a Medium humanoid.

Skills:  A  dread  has  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Listen  and  Spot

checks.

Dread Warrior

Called forth to serve in undeath through foul

necromantic magic, dread warriors are undead

beings created from the corpses of skilled war-

riors. They retain many of the martial skills and talents

they  possessed  in  life  but  are  compelled  to  serve  their

creators with unquestioning obedience. Dread warriors are created

with the spell animate dread warriorUna.

A dread warrior looks more or less like it did in life, although it

still bears the ghastly wounds that killed it, and its eyes glow with

a feral yellow light. Its skin tends to shrivel and darken, falling

in on its sunken  esh to give it a gaunt, withered appearance.

A dread warrior usually carries the arms and armor it favored

before its death and transformation.

A dread warrior speaks whatever languages it knew in life.

Sample Dread Warrior

An armored warrior limps closer, a battleaxe gripped in its hands.

No human could live with the wounds the creature bears, but

its eyes burn yellow with hate, and the shriveled  esh of its face

twists into an evil snarl.

A skeletal pair of arms hovers in the

air,  both  hands  gripping  a  rusty  old

longsword. The arms move together and

strike as if they were the limbs of a

human-sized skeleton.

Dread

A dread is a pair of animated skeletal arms created for use as an

undead guardian. Like a skeleton, it is a mindless automaton that

obeys the commands of its master, but it also carries an aura of

supernatural terror. Each of a dreads arms is 2 to 4 feet long

and weighs 10 to 40 pounds.

Dreads do only what they are ordered to do, but they can accept

reasonably complex commands based on observable characteristics

such as race, equipment, spoken passwords, or speci c actions. For

example, a dread might be ordered to attack all intruders except

elves and creatures displaying a certain token. These dreads are

often incorporated into complex trap designs.

A dread can be created with an animate dead spell, but in

addition to all the normal requirements of the spell, the caster

must provide a zendalure gemstone worth at least 1,000 gp.

COMBAT

Dread warriors are not always reliable servants because compli-

cated orders tend to confuse them. Orders with twelve or fewer

words cause no problems, but a dread warrior has a cumulative

5%  chance  per  word  after  the  twelfth  to

misinterpret the entire set of instruc-

tions.  A  dread  warrior  that  fails  to

understand its orders functions as if

confused (see the confusion spell in the

Players  Handbook).  Roll  randomly

to  determine  what  action  it  takes

in  response  to  the  command  that

triggered its confusion.

Dread warriors  ght with the arms

and armor they used in life.

Undead Traits: A dread warrior is

immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stun-

ning, disease, death effects, and any

effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects or is

harmless. It is not subject to extra

damage  from  critical  hits,  nonle-

thal damage, ability damage to its

physical ability scores, ability drain,

energy  drain,  fatigue,  exhaustion,

or death from massive damage. It

cannot be raised, and resurrection

works only if it is willing. It has

darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: A dread warrior gains a +4

racial  bonus  on  Climb,  Jump,  and

Spot checks.

recalculate the creatures base attack bonus, base saves, or skill

points. Size is unchanged.

Hit Dice: All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.

Armor Class: Same as the base creature with the appropriate

armor type.

Abilities: Change from the base creature as follows: Str +4,

Int 6 (minimum 3), Cha 4 (minimum 3). As an undead

creature,  a  dread  warrior  has  no  Constitution

score.

Skills: Same as the base creature, except

Flameskulls are undead guardians created from the fresh skulls

of  humanoid  spellcasters.  Deathless,  intelligent,  and  vigilant,

these  creatures  are  often  found  guarding  hidden  hoards  and

secret chambers centuries after the clerics or wizards who created

Emerald gleams of malice dance in its eye sockets.

A  ameskull can be created from the corpse

of a humanoid spellcaster by means of a create

undead spell (caster level 14th).

Flameskulls speak Common, Draconic, Infer-

nal, and one or two ancient languages

no longer in common use, such as

Loross or Thorass.

Combat

Flameskulls are resistant to many types

of  magic  but  vulnerable  to  melee  and

missile attacks. They go to great lengths

to stay out of swords reach and tend to

attack intruders with their  re rays and

spells from a safe elevation. If need be,

however, they can be fearless combat-

ants, since they know that they are

likely  to  rejuvenate  in  a  few  days

even if smashed to bits.

Fire Ray (Su): Range 20 feet. A

 ameskull can shoot two  re rays

as a standard action.

15);  1/day reball  (DC  15),  mirror  image.  Caster

level 4th.

Fast Healing (Ex): A  ameskull heals 2 points of damage each

round, so long as it has at least 1 hit point remaining.

Rejuvenation (Su): A destroyed  ameskull rejuvenates at its

full normal hit points in 1 hour, even if smashed to pieces. To

prevent rejuvenation, its remains must be sprinkled with a vial of

holy water or subjected to a dispel magic, dispel evil, or remove

curse spell. The  ameskulls caster level is 14th for the purpose

of a dispel check.

Undead  Traits:  A   ameskull  is  immune  to  mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it

also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra

damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to

its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised,

and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision

out to 60 feet.

This creatures squat posture and bloated body suggest the shape

of an enormous, winged toad, about 20 feet long and 8 feet high

at the shoulder. Its skin is black and covered with wriggling

from its long, narrow, multi-jawed face.

A foulwing is a grotesquely misshapen predator that loves

nothing  more  than  tearing   esh  from  bone  with  its  three

toothy jaws.

A foulwings toadlike body is about 20 feet long and 8 feet

high  at  the  shoulder,  and  the  creature  weighs  about  8,000

pounds. Its black skin is covered with wriggling growths shaped

like small horns. The foulwings legs end in rubbery  ngers

useful for clinging to uneven surfaces but ineffectual in

combat, and its black, leathery wings are tipped

with sharp claws. The creatures long, narrow

head ends in a snout with a single nostril sur-

rounded  by  three  needle-toothed  jaws.  Its  red

eyes are faceted like gemstones and glow with

a pale red light.

Foulwings  communicate  with  each  other

via  harsh  croakings  that  are  only  slightly

more  sophisticated  than  animal  calls.  These

Combat

Foulwings hunt from the air, hurling

their massive bodies onto potential

prey and tearing with their jaws while bat-

tering  at  their  victims  with  the  claws  on  their  wings.  Drow

and other evil humanoids frequently tame and ride foulwings

Blood Drain (Ex): A foulwing can use its three long, tubelike

tongues to drain blood from an opponent that it has pinned with

its crush attack. With a successful grapple check, it deals 1d4

Each creature within the cone must make a successful DC 18

Re ex save or be blinded and stunned for 1 round.

Crush (Ex): Area 15 ft. by 15 ft.; Small or smaller opponents

take 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage, and must succeed on

The gorynych is a ferocious, dragonlike

monster  that  eats  almost  anything

short of a true dragon that crosses its

path.  Despite  its  bestial  appearance,

the gorynych is quite cunning. It has

been known to feign retreat in order to

lure opponents into its lair, or to allow

humanoids to escape its attacks so that

it can follow them back to their homes and villages.

A gorynychs dragonlike body measures almost 40 feet from

snout  to  tail.  Each  of  its  three  heads  is  supported  by  a  long,

draconic neck, and its three tails branch into a multitude of long,

thin whips. Only the six largest of these whips are signi cant in

combat, though a gorynych can have as many as twelve altogether.

The creature weighs between 8 and 10 tons.

A gorynych speaks Common, Draconic, and Orc.

Combat

A  gorynych  lacks  the  breath  weapon  and  powerful  spellcast-

ing abilities of a true dragon, though its uncommon ferocity

and cunning in melee make up for this de ciency. One of its

favorite tactics is to swoop down on a group of travelers, seize

one with a tail whip in a  yby attack, and carry off its hapless

victim. The gorynych is large enough to accept the normal 20

penalty for attempting to grapple an opponent without being

grappled itself.

An opponent can attack a gorynychs tails  as if they were

weapons (see Sunder, page 158 of the Players Handbook). Each

tail whip has 10 hit points. If a gorynych is currently grappling

an opponent with the tail under attack, it usually uses another

limb to make its attack of opportunity. Severing a gorynychs tail

deals 5 points of damage to the creature. A gorynych regrows

severed tails in 1d10+10 days.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this

ability,  a  gorynych  must  hit  an  op-

ponent one or more size categories

smaller than itself with a tail whip

attack.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,

it  establishes  a  hold  and  uses  its  tail

wrap  attack.  Against  human-sized

opponents, a gorynych usually chooses

to grapple only with its tail to avoid

being grappled itself, thereby reducing

its grapple bonus to +13.

Rake  (Ex):  If  a  gorynych  hits

a grappled foe with all three bite

attacks, it can rake with its claws.

Attack bonus +23 melee, damage

2d8+4.

Rend  (Ex):  If  a  gorynych  hits

with  two  bite  attacks,  it  latches

onto the opponents body and tears

the victim apart like a wishbone.

This attack automatically deals an

extra 4d8+13 points of damage.

Tail Wrap (Ex): After a success-

ful  grab,  a  gorynych  can  attempt

to  wrap  its  opponent  with  some  or

all of its remaining tail whips with a

single grapple check. Each tail whip

beyond  the   rst  reduces  the  penalty

for  grappling  without  being  grappled

by  4.  Thus,  a  gorynych  with  three  tail

whips wrapped around a foe has a grapple modi er

of +21 (+33, 20 for choosing not to be grappled, +8 for two

extra tail whips).

Skills: Because of its multiple heads and keen senses, a gorynych

has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Greenbound Creature

In the crumbling Siluvanedenn ruins of Telardon, powerful and

ancient magical energies seep from an unknown number of buried

arcane  treasures.  These  energies  transform  hapless  creatures

nearby into plantlike beings of great strength.

A greenbound creature looks much like it did before trans-

formation, although certain changes are apparent. The creatures

 esh has been replaced by pulpy wood and thickly corded creepers,

and tiny branches stick out from its torso, arms, and legs. Any

feathers,  hair,  or  fur  it  once  had  have  been  replaced  by  some

combination of green vines, moss,  owers, and leaves.

Rend (Ex): If a greenbound troll hits with both claw attacks,

it latches onto the opponents body and tears the  esh. This attack

regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed

member instantly by holding it to the stump.

Creating a Greenbound

Creature

Greenbound  creature  is  an  acquired  template

that can be added to any animal, fey, giant,

humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or

vermin (hereafter referred to as the

base creature).

A greenbound creature uses all the

base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures

type  changes  to  plant  with

the  appropriate  augmented

subtype.  Do  not  recalculate

base attack bonus, base saves,

or  skill  points.  Size  is

unchanged.

Hit Dice: Change all

current Hit Dice to d8s.

Armor  Class:  A  green-

bound  creatures  natural

armor  bonus  improves  by  6

over  that  of  the  base

creature.

Greenbound troll

Attack: A greenbound

creature  retains  all  the

attacks  of  the  base  creature

and also gains a slam attack if

it  didnt  already  have  one.  If  the  base

creature can use weapons, the greenbound

creature retains this ability. A greenbound

creature   ghting  without  weapons  uses  either  its  slam  attack

or its primary natural weapons (if it has any). A greenbound

creature armed with a weapon uses either its slam attack or a

weapon, as it desires.

Full Attack: A greenbound creature  ghting with out weapons

uses either its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if

it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon

as its primary attack along with a slam or other natural weapon

as a natural secondary attack.

Damage:  A  greenbound  creature  has  a  slam  attack.  If  the

base creature does not have this attack form, use the appropriate

damage value from the table below according to the greenbound

creatures size. A creature that has other kinds of natural weapons

retains its old damage values or uses the appropriate values from

the table below, whichever is better.

Helmed Horror

An intimidating  gure dressed in ancient, tarnished plate stands

guard,  a   aming  sword  clutched  in  its  armored  gauntlets.  A

strange, purple radiance gleams from the joints in its armor.

Helmed horrors and battle horrors are deadly, self-willed magical

constructs that appear to be nothing more than empty, animated

suits  of  full  plate  armor.  They  are  absolutely  remorseless  and

tireless in discharging their duties.

Helmed Horror

Helmed horrors are usually encountered carrying out the duties

assigned to them by their creators. Because these constructs are

free-willed and intelligent, they are perfectly capable of reexamin-

ing their programming. A simple command such as Remain here

and destroy all intruders leaves little room for interpretation,

so they do not often abandon such tasks.

Helmed horrors whose last orders are invalidated by some

means  may  wander  abroad,  pursuing  mysterious  goals  that

somehow re ect their last orders. For example, a helmed horror

that fails to prevent thieves from plundering a vault it is assigned

to guard might assign itself the mission of retrieving all treasure

that has been removed from that vault.

A helmed horror looks like a humanoid  gure between 5 and

7 feet tall, wearing a suit of full plate armor. On some helmed

horrors, the armor appears exceedingly old; on others, it is shiny

and well kept. Magical purple light sometimes  ares through the

joints of the armor.

A helmed horror does not speak, but it un-

derstands Common and one of

its creators languages.

COMBAT

Helmed horrors  ght intelligently, opening with missile  re at

soft targets and using air walk to outmaneuver landbound op-

ponents. They do not necessarily  ght to the death because they

often deem it better to survive and continue with their designated

tasks. If  eeing would destroy any chance of ful lling their mis-

sions, however, they are quite willing to sacri ce themselves.

When a helmed horror is destroyed, its armor dissolves into

slag.

Air Walk (Su): Helmed horrors can move through the air as

if affected by an air walk spell (caster level 13th).

Construct Traits: A helmed horror has immunity to poison,

sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy

effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns,  and  morale  effects),  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is

not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.

It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired. It has darkvision

out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Rapid  Repair  (Ex):  A  helmed  horror  that  rests  for  1  full

hour repairs 1 point of damage, so long as it has at least 1 hit

point remaining. Rapid repair does not allow a helmed horror

to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

See Invisible (Su): A helmed horror sees invisible creatures

and objects as if affected by a see invisibility spell.

Spell Immunities (Ex): A helmed horror is immune to magic

missile. In addition, its maker can give it immunity to three other

Weapon Power (Su): The magic that creates a helmed horror

often endows it with the ability to imbue a melee weapon it is

holding with a magical power. The effect comes from the helmed

horror, not from the weapon, and can be called forth as a free

action. Roll 1d10 and consult the following table to determine

the special ability granted. These abilities function as described

CONSTRUCTION

A helmed horror is built from a suit of masterwork full plate

armor. After procuring the armor, the creator must animate it

via an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared

laboratory or workroom that is similar to an alchemists labora-

tory and costs 500 gp to establish. The ritual also gives the armor

a +3 enhancement bonus. A helmed horror with more than 13

Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +5,000

gp to the price.

Battle Horror

This malevolent construct is made by binding an evil elemental

spirit into a helmed horror during its creation. Battle horrors

look much like helmed horrors and are sometimes employed for

similar tasks, but they more often function as roaming assassins

and war machines assigned to slay their masters enemies.

COMBAT

In addition to the special attacks and special qualities of a standard

helmed horror, a battle horror has the following special attack.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willmagic  missile;  3/dayblink;

1/daydimension door. Caster level 7th.

CONSTRUCTION

A battle horror is created in much the same manner as a helmed

horror, except that the armor acquires a +5 enhancement bonus.

A battle horror with more than 20 Hit Dice can be created, but

each additional Hit Die adds +8,000 gp to the price.

inspection  reveals  a  far  more  deadly  creature.  A  wickedly

barbed tail with a stinger like a scorpions lashes around behind

the creature, and a mouth full of sharp, bony plates gapes below

four yellow eyes that gleam intelligently.

Ixzans are weirdly mutated cousins of the ixitxachtil (detailed

in Monster Manual II) that are specically adapted to live in

the waters of the Underdark. Larger than their marine cousins,

ixzans possess innate spell-like abilities that help them survive in

the deadly environment they share with aboleths and kuo-toas.

They can also move overland, and they sometimes levitate to

cavern ceilings and hide in hopes of ambushing prey.

Ixzans speak Undercommon and Aquan.

Combat

Ixzans are quite accomplished at hiding and enjoy using abilities

such as darkness and levitate to avoid notice. The creatures long,

barbed tail drips with deadly poison, and it also possess a number

of useful offensive spell-like abilities.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d4 Con,

secondary damage 2d4 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcontrol water, darkness, levitate;

1/daycharm monster (DC 16), cure moderate wounds (DC 14),

y, haste, inict serious wounds (DC 15), invisibility, mage armor,

magic missile, slow (DC 15). Caster level 6th.

Illusion Resistance: An ixzan gains a +4 racial bonus on saving

throws against illusions.

Skills: An ixzan receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

When the creature is in water, this bonus increases to +8.

Lycanthrope

Lycanthropes  are  humanoids  or  giants  that  can  transform

themselves into animals. Lycanthropy, the condition responsible

for this ability, can be spread like a disease. When a lycanthrope

wounds a normal humanoid or giant in battle but does not kill

it, the victim may contract lycanthropy. Such a creature is called

an  aficted  lycanthrope.  Humanoids  or  giants  that  are  born

with the ability to assume animal form are known as natural

lycanthropes.

In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other member

of its race, though natural lycanthropes and those that have been

aficted with lycanthropy for a long time tend to have features

reminiscent of their animal forms, such as shaggy hair, pointed

teeth,  or  long,  strong  ngers.  In  animal  form,  a  lycanthrope

resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close

inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence,

and they often glow red in the dark.

Evil lycanthropes often hide among normal folk and emerge

in animal form at night (especially under the full moon) to spread

terror  and  bloodshed.  Good  lycanthropes  tend  to  be  reclusive

individuals who are uncomfortable with large numbers of people.

They often live alone in wilderness areas, far from villages and

towns.

Combat

A lycanthrope in its humanoid or giant form uses whatever tactics

and weapons its people favor, though it tends to be slightly more

aggressive than its fellow creatures. It possesses the senses of an

animal, including scent and low-light vision where appropriate. A

lycanthrope has a deep empathy for animals of its animal kind

and can communicate with them, regardless of its form. An af-

icted lycanthrope damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by

rage and change to its animal form involuntarily.

A  lycanthrope  in  animal  form  ghts  like  the  animal  it

resembles,  although  its  bite  attack  carries  the  terrible  disease

of  lycanthropy.  The  creature  is  preternaturally  cunning  and

strong,  and  it  damage  reduction  makes  it  difcult  to  damage

with mundane weapons.

Finally,  a  natural  lycanthrope  (or  an  aficted  lycanthrope

that  has  become  aware  of  its  condition)  can  assume  a  hybrid

form that is a mix of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid

has prehensile hands and can use weapons, but it can also attack

with its teeth and claws. A hybrid can spread lycanthropy with

its bite just as a lycanthrope in animal form can.

Lycanthrope, Drow Werebat

Drow werebats in humanoid form tend to be dark-eyed, shy, and

elusive. They often have pug noses and sharp teeth, and they tend

to avoid bright light and favor rare meat.

COMBAT

A drow werebat uses its ying ability to maximum advantage,

swooping down to attack unsuspecting prey and then ying out

of range.

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid or giant hit by

the bite attack of a drow werebat in animal or hybrid form must

succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.

Poison (Ex): An opponent hit by a drow werebats poisoned

weapon must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall uncon-

scious. After 1 minute, the subject must succeed on another DC

13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours. A typical

drow werebat carries 1d41 doses of drow knockout poison. Drow

typically coat their arrows and crossbow bolts with this poison,

but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. Drow have no special

ability to apply poison safely, and since the effect of this poison

is not magical, drow and other elves are susceptible to it.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/daydancing lights, darkness, faerie

re. Caster level equals drow werebats class levels.

Alternate Form (Su): A drow werebat can assume the form

of a dire bat or a bat-drow hybrid.

Bat Empathy (Ex): A drow werebat can communicate with

bats and dire bats. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based

checks made against such creatures.

Blindsense (Ex): A drow werebat uses echolocation to pinpoint

creatures within 40 feet. Opponents still have total concealment

against the drow werebat unless it can actually see them.

Light  Blindness:  Abrupt  exposure  to  bright  light  (such  as

sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds drow werebats in drow form

for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as

they remain in the affected area.

Resistance: A drow werebat gains a +2 racial bonus on Will

saves against spells and spell-like abilities.

Skills: A drow werebat in hybrid or bat form has a +4 racial

bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its

blindsense is negated.

The drow werebat presented here is a 1st-level drow warrior

and natural lycanthrope with the following base ability scores:

Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Lycanthrope, Werecat

In humanoid or giant form, werecats are lithe, slender, sensuous,

and somewhat hedonistic. In cat form, they resemble ocelots or

other small wildcats.

COMBAT

A werecat generally uses its cat form for stealthy purposes, such

as seeking out cults of Shar and Loviatar. It then hunts down

COMBAT

A werecrocodile prefers to catch potential enemies unaware by

assuming its humanoid or giant form and posing as a harmless

commoner. It then changes to crocodile form and attacks as soon

as its prey comes within range.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a werecrocodile in

animal form must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity. If the werecrocodile wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold on the opponent with its mouth, drags it into

deep water, and attempts to pin it to the bottom.

Alternate Form (Su): A werecrocodile can assume the form

of a crocodile or a crocodile-human hybrid.

Crocodile Empathy (Ex): A werecrocodile can communicate

with crocodiles and giant crocodiles. It gains a +4 racial bonus

on Charisma-based checks against such creatures.

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid or giant hit by

the bite attack of a werecrocodile in animal or hybrid form must

succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.

Hold Breath (Ex): A werecrocodile can hold its breath for a

number of rounds equal to 4  its Constitution score before it

risks drowning.

This strange creature resembles a slug the

size of a draft horse. Its glistening skin is a

mottled purple color, and a round mouth full of

jagged teeth gapes beneath its four stalked eyes. Broken

shards of metal cling to its body, and bits of rusty, metallic

debris skitter along the ground beside it as it moves.

exact location is not revealed, but the metalmaster can take

a move action to note the direction in which the metal lies.

When it comes within 5 feet of metal, the creature knows its

location.

Fast Healing (Ex): A metalmaster heals 1 point of damage

each round, so long as it has at least 1 hit point remaining.

Magnetism (Su): A metalmaster can create magical  elds of

magnetic energy. Once per round as a free action, it can create

one of the following effects (caster level 12th). The save DCs

for these abilities are Charisma-based, and its magnetism has an

effective Strength score of 25.

A  metalmasters  magnetism  affects  only  metallic

creatures,  creatures  wearing  metal  armor,  or  creatures

carrying metal weapons or shields. Creatures

carrying metal objects can simply drop them

to avoid the effect. The metalmasters magnetism

affects the dropped objects just as it would any other

unattended item.

Each  of  these  abilities  functions

continuously  until  the  metalmasters

next turn unless otherwise noted. Any

creature that enters the area of the mag-

netism is subject to its effects.

Attraction  (Su):  All  metallic

creatures and objects within 60 feet

of the metalmaster are entangled

and dragged closer to it. This abil-

ity functions like a bull rush (check

modi er +11), except that it does

not  provoke  attacks  of  opportunity,

and  targets  that  lose  the  opposed

check move toward the metalmaster

instead  of  away  from  it.  The  metal-

master does not move if it loses the opposed

Metal Storm (Su): A metalmaster can turn the

shards of metal clinging to its body into a whirling

storm of razors. This effect reduces its natural armor

bonus by 4, but each other creature within 20 feet takes

4d6 points of slashing damage (Re ex DC 20 half). This

effect lasts for 12 rounds.

Also known as a sword slug, the metalmaster is a strange,

underground  predator  with  dangerous  magnetic  powers

and a penchant for humanoid  esh.

A metalmaster is about 15 feet long and more than 2 feet

thick in the middle of its body. It weighs about 2,000 pounds.

Metalmasters speak Undercommon, although they are not

brilliant conversationalists.

Metalmaster

Combat

The primary weapon of a metalmaster is its magnetism. It prefers

to use its telekinesis ability on troublesome individuals or likely

prey, and it may use its attraction ability to drag several foes

within range of its metal storm.

Detect Metal (Ex): A metalmaster automatically senses the

presence of any metal (minimum 1 pound) within 60 feet. The

Repelling  Aura  (Su):  All  metallic  creatures  and  objects

within 60 feet of the metalmaster are pushed backward. This

ability  functions  like  attraction  (see  above),  except  that  the

affected creatures are not entangled, and they move away from

the metalmaster rather than toward it. While using this ability,

the  metalmaster  gains  a  +8  de ection  bonus  to  AC  against

attacks by weapons that have metal components.

Telekinesis (Su): A metalmaster can affect one creature or

object  within  60  feet  as  if  using  a  telekinesis  spell  (DC  14).

Its effective Strength is 25 (+7 bonus) for the purpose of any

opposed  checks  required  in  conjunction  with  this  ability.  If

the  metalmaster  chooses  the  violent  thrust  function  of  the

telekinesis  spell,  the  effects  are  resolved  immediately  and  do

not last beyond its turn.

A supernatural aura of dread hangs thickly in the air around

this  malignant  black   gure.  It  looks  something  like  a  gargoyle,

with large shadowy wings, curling horns, and a lashing tail, but

its body appears to be sculpted from purest night, and its face is

blank except for the pale, lifeless orbs of its eyes.

Malicious, sinister creatures of unliving darkness, nighthaunts are

the smallest and weakest of the nightshades. Because nighthaunts

delight in the destruction of the good and the innocent, they are

inexorably drawn to places of evil power and de led goodness,

such as desecrated temples or emptied graveyards.

Nighthaunts speak whatever languages they knew in life.

Combat

Nighthaunts are terrifying foes, with numerous dark powers at

their beck and call. By pressing its blank face to its victims, a

nighthaunt can drain the life energy on which it feeds.

Nighthaunts often use deeper darkness and invisibility to divide

and confuse their enemies, then swoop close to grapple spellcaster

with their icy talons and drain their life forces. Nighthaunts prefer

to harass well-organized or strong opponents from a distance,

using their spell-like abilities to wear down their victims before

closing for melee.

Aversion  to  Daylight  (Ex):  Nighthaunts  are  creatures

of  utter  darkness  that  loathe  all  light.  If  exposed

to  natural  daylight

(not merely a daylight

spell),  a  nighthaunt

takes a 4 penalty on all

attack rolls, saving throws, and

skill checks.

Desecrating Aura (Su): A night-

haunt  radiates  an  aura  of  utter

desecration, imbuing its surround-

ings  with  negative  energy  to  a

radius of 20 feet. This ability works

much like a desecrate spell, except

that the nightshades body is treated

as the shrine of an evil power. Every

undead  creature  within  20  feet  of

it (including the nightshade itself)

gains a +2 profane bonus on attack

rolls,  damage  rolls,  and  saving

throws,  as  well  as  +2  hit

points per Hit Die. (The Hit

Dice, attack, and save entries

given  above  already  include

these  bonuses.)  Furthermore,

any Charisma check made to

turn undead within this area

takes a 6 penalty.

The nighthaunts desecrating aura cannot be dispelled

except with a dispel evil spell or similar effect. The nightshade

can recreate its desecrating aura as a free action on its next turn

if it is successfully dispelled. The desecrating aura is suppressed

if a nighthaunt enters a consecrated or hallowed area, but its

presence suppresses that effect as long as the nighthaunt remains

in the area.

Energy  Drain  (Su):  If  a  nighthaunt  wins  a  grapple  check

against  a  living  creature,  the  latter  gains  two  negative  levels.

The DC for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level is 19,

and the save DC is Charisma-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a nighthaunt must

hit a Large or smaller creature with both of its claw attacks. If

it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can use its

energy drain attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdeeper darkness, detect magic,

Hundreds of grasping hands, probing eyes, and gaping, hungry

mouths churn within a great sphere of red mist. Lurid, red light

glows and pulses within it.

Because  these  weird,  misty  creatures  from  another  plane  eat

magic, they can wreak havoc with spellcasters and magic items.

Nishruus were  rst encountered in the Moonshae Isles, but they

can be found anywhere that magic is practiced. They constitute

a persistent nuisance in the magic-forging workshops of Thayan

enclaves. In the Old Empires of Mulhorand, Unther, and Ches-

senta, the nishruu is known as a hakeashar.

Nishruus may have their own alien language, but all attempts

to communicate with them thus far have failed.

Combat

To attack, a nishruu

moves into an oppo-

nents space, thereby

provoking an attack

of opportunity.

Since its form is

mostly gaseous, it

can occupy the same

space as a creature of

any  size.  A  nishruu  can

move  through  squares

occupied by enemies and

vice  versa  without  im-

pediment, although doing

so  provokes  attacks  of  op-

portunity.  The  hundreds  of

toothy  mouths  that  make  up  a

nishruus  body  are  solid  enough  to

deliver bite attacks, which function like

the attacks of a swarm. Characters engulfed

by a nishruu can hit it automatically with

melee attacks.

Nishruu

Absorb Magic

(Su):  Nishruus

feed  on  magic.

They  absorb  any  magical

energy that comes in contact with their

bodies,  including  spells  targeted  on  them,  magic  items  they

envelop, and even spellcasters engulfed within their misty forms.

This unusual diet has the following effects.

If a nishruu is the target of a spell that deals hit point damage,

it absorbs the spell and permanently gains hit points equal to

the damage it would otherwise have dealt. The only exceptions

are cold and  re spells, which deal damage (reduced, in the

case of cold spells) and then dissipate after 1 round.

If a nishruu is the target of a nondamaging spell, it absorbs

the spell and gains 1 hit point per spell level.

If a magic item that has charges is in contact with a nishruu,

the creature drains 1d4 charges upon initial contact and a like

amount every other round thereafter.

If a nishruu is in contact with a magic item that does not

have charges, the effects of the item are negated for as long

as it remains in contact with the nishruu and for 1d4 rounds

afterward.

If a character enveloped within a nishruu attempts to use a

temporary item such as a potion or scroll, the effect does not

initiate until 1d4 rounds after the user leaves the nishruus

body.

for 1 round thereafter.

A spellcaster (arcane or divine) loses one prepared spell or

spell slot, determined randomly, upon initial contact with a

nishruu. Each round thereafter that two remain in contact,

the spellcaster loses one additional randomly selected spell.

Each time she loses a spell in this manner, she must make a

DC 15 Will save or suffer the effects of a feeblemind spell.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to  a

swarm attack that begins its turn with a nishruu in its square

is nauseated for 1 round (DC 17 Fortitude save negates). The

save DC is Constitution-based. Spellcasting or concentrating

on spells while in contact with a nishruu requires a Concen-

tration check (DC 20 + spell level). Likewise, using any skill

that  involves  patience  and  concentration  requires  a  DC  20

Concentration check.

Swarm of Bites (Ex): Like a swarm, a nishruu doesnt make

standard melee attacks. Instead, it deals automatic damage to any

creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move, with no

attack roll needed. This attack is not subject to a miss chance for

concealment or cover. A nishruu does not threaten creatures in its

square, nor can it make attacks of opportunity with its swarm of

bites attack. However, it distracts foes whose squares it occupies,

as described above.

Gaseous Form (Ex): Since its body is composed of mist, a

nishruu can pass through small holes or narrow openings. It also

has damage reduction 10/magic and immunity to poison and is

not subject to extra damage from critical hits. Though a nishruu

is vulnerable to cold- and  re-based attacks, such effects cannot

form inside its gaseous body.

Immune to Mental In uence (Ex): Nishruus are completely

unaffected  by  mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms, and morale effects).

Vulnerability (Su): A rod of absorption or ring of spell turning

brought into contact with a nishruu has a 5% chance of destroy-

ing it immediately. The creature is absorbed with no harm to the

item, though its color changes to a dusky red. If the item does

not absorb the nishruu, it is negated in the same manner as other

magic items.

Salt is poisonous to a nishruu, and a handful of thrown salt

deals 2d10 points of damage to the creature.

Charge Magic (Su): When a nishruu is slain, its body dissipates

and drifts away. Any charged magic item in contact with it when

it dies gains an 1d6 additional charges. The enhancement bonus

of a magic weapon that strikes the killing blow against a nishruu

increases by 1 for 1d6 days.

An immense, conical creature  oats in the air ahead. The ovoid

disk at its top is actually an immense, toothed maw, and its four

arms are clawed. The other end of its body is tipped with a single,

razor-sharp stinger.

Phaerimms are evil magicians who would gladly erase all other

beings from existence. The fact that they have not yet done so is

probably attributable to the fact that they would lack serviceable

slaves to torture for sport if they did.

Millennia ago, the phaerimms plotted to destroy all life in

Faern. They succeeded in toppling the mighty Empire of Magic

and devastating the area now known as the Anauroch Desert, but

they were foiled by the intervention of the elder sharnsMon, which

imprisoned most of them in a magic  eld beneath Anauroch.

Some of the phaerimms that escaped imprisonment now live in

the ruins of Myth Drannor, squandering their power on internal

political squabbles. Others have conquered the beholder city of

Ooltul and are attempting to break through the sharns barrier

to free their fellows.

A  phaerimm  has  a  conical  body  shaped  something  like  a

windsock. Its ovoid head disk contains an immense, toothed maw

and is surrounded by four clawed arms. The rest of the phaerimms

long, sinuous body tapers down to a lethal stinger. At hatching,

a phaerimm is only a foot or two long, but it can grow as large

Hundreds of grasping hands, probing eyes, and gaping, hungry

mouths churn within a great sphere of red mist. Lurid, red light

glows and pulses within it.

Because  these  weird,  misty  creatures  from  another  plane  eat

magic, they can wreak havoc with spellcasters and magic items.

Nishruus were  rst encountered in the Moonshae Isles, but they

can be found anywhere that magic is practiced. They constitute

a persistent nuisance in the magic-forging workshops of Thayan

enclaves. In the Old Empires of Mulhorand, Unther, and Ches-

senta, the nishruu is known as a hakeashar.

Nishruus may have their own alien language, but all attempts

to communicate with them thus far have failed.

Combat

To attack, a nishruu

moves into an oppo-

nents space, thereby

provoking an attack

of opportunity.

Since its form is

mostly gaseous, it

can occupy the same

space as a creature of

any  size.  A  nishruu  can

move  through  squares

occupied by enemies and

vice  versa  without  im-

pediment, although doing

so  provokes  attacks  of  op-

portunity.  The  hundreds  of

toothy  mouths  that  make  up  a

nishruus  body  are  solid  enough  to

deliver bite attacks, which function like

the attacks of a swarm. Characters engulfed

by a nishruu can hit it automatically with

melee attacks.

Nishruu

Absorb Magic

(Su):  Nishruus

feed  on  magic.

They  absorb  any  magical

energy that comes in contact with their

bodies,  including  spells  targeted  on  them,  magic  items  they

envelop, and even spellcasters engulfed within their misty forms.

This unusual diet has the following effects.

If a nishruu is the target of a spell that deals hit point damage,

it absorbs the spell and permanently gains hit points equal to

the damage it would otherwise have dealt. The only exceptions

are cold and  re spells, which deal damage (reduced, in the

case of cold spells) and then dissipate after 1 round.

If a nishruu is the target of a nondamaging spell, it absorbs

the spell and gains 1 hit point per spell level.

If a magic item that has charges is in contact with a nishruu,

the creature drains 1d4 charges upon initial contact and a like

amount every other round thereafter.

If a nishruu is in contact with a magic item that does not

have charges, the effects of the item are negated for as long

as it remains in contact with the nishruu and for 1d4 rounds

afterward.

If a character enveloped within a nishruu attempts to use a

temporary item such as a potion or scroll, the effect does not

initiate until 1d4 rounds after the user leaves the nishruus

body.

for 1 round thereafter.

A spellcaster (arcane or divine) loses one prepared spell or

spell slot, determined randomly, upon initial contact with a

nishruu. Each round thereafter that two remain in contact,

the spellcaster loses one additional randomly selected spell.

Each time she loses a spell in this manner, she must make a

DC 15 Will save or suffer the effects of a feeblemind spell.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to  a

swarm attack that begins its turn with a nishruu in its square

is nauseated for 1 round (DC 17 Fortitude save negates). The

save DC is Constitution-based. Spellcasting or concentrating

on spells while in contact with a nishruu requires a Concen-

tration check (DC 20 + spell level). Likewise, using any skill

that  involves  patience  and  concentration  requires  a  DC  20

Concentration check.

Swarm of Bites (Ex): Like a swarm, a nishruu doesnt make

standard melee attacks. Instead, it deals automatic damage to any

creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move, with no

attack roll needed. This attack is not subject to a miss chance for

concealment or cover. A nishruu does not threaten creatures in its

square, nor can it make attacks of opportunity with its swarm of

bites attack. However, it distracts foes whose squares it occupies,

as described above.

Gaseous Form (Ex): Since its body is composed of mist, a

nishruu can pass through small holes or narrow openings. It also

has damage reduction 10/magic and immunity to poison and is

not subject to extra damage from critical hits. Though a nishruu

is vulnerable to cold- and  re-based attacks, such effects cannot

form inside its gaseous body.

Immune to Mental In uence (Ex): Nishruus are completely

unaffected  by  mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms, and morale effects).

Vulnerability (Su): A rod of absorption or ring of spell turning

brought into contact with a nishruu has a 5% chance of destroy-

ing it immediately. The creature is absorbed with no harm to the

item, though its color changes to a dusky red. If the item does

not absorb the nishruu, it is negated in the same manner as other

magic items.

Salt is poisonous to a nishruu, and a handful of thrown salt

deals 2d10 points of damage to the creature.

Charge Magic (Su): When a nishruu is slain, its body dissipates

and drifts away. Any charged magic item in contact with it when

it dies gains an 1d6 additional charges. The enhancement bonus

of a magic weapon that strikes the killing blow against a nishruu

increases by 1 for 1d6 days.

An immense, conical creature  oats in the air ahead. The ovoid

disk at its top is actually an immense, toothed maw, and its four

arms are clawed. The other end of its body is tipped with a single,

razor-sharp stinger.

Phaerimms are evil magicians who would gladly erase all other

beings from existence. The fact that they have not yet done so is

probably attributable to the fact that they would lack serviceable

slaves to torture for sport if they did.

Millennia ago, the phaerimms plotted to destroy all life in

Faern. They succeeded in toppling the mighty Empire of Magic

and devastating the area now known as the Anauroch Desert, but

they were foiled by the intervention of the elder sharnsMon, which

imprisoned most of them in a magic  eld beneath Anauroch.

Some of the phaerimms that escaped imprisonment now live in

the ruins of Myth Drannor, squandering their power on internal

political squabbles. Others have conquered the beholder city of

Ooltul and are attempting to break through the sharns barrier

to free their fellows.

A  phaerimm  has  a  conical  body  shaped  something  like  a

windsock. Its ovoid head disk contains an immense, toothed maw

and is surrounded by four clawed arms. The rest of the phaerimms

long, sinuous body tapers down to a lethal stinger. At hatching,

a phaerimm is only a foot or two long, but it can grow as large

as 30 feet in old age.

A  phaerimms  innate  magical  ability  develops  with  age.  A

hatchling casts spells as a 1st-level sorcerer, while a centuries-old

revered elder is a 19th-level caster.

Phaerimms communicate with one another by varying the

wind  speed  around  their  bodies  and  with  other  creatures  by

means of telepathy. They understand Common and several other

languages.

in icting pain makes them somewhat predictable. They can be

dangerous combatants, but they view purely physical combat

as a sign of weakness. Because a phaerimm that uses its stinger

or  weapons  to  defend  itself  is  assumed  to  have  insuf cient

magical  abilities,  phaerimms  make  physical  attacks  only  as

a last resorteven at younger ages when they lack powerful

magic. Young phaerimms sometimes stoop to using masterwork

swords, and they suffer no disgrace for doing so as long as they

use Tensers  oating disk to carry the weapons whenever they

are out of combat.

As  spellcasters,  phaerimms  favor  charm,  command,  and

illusion  effects  over  damage-producing  spells,  but  they  are

not  shy  about  using  a  fireball  if  necessary.  Powerful  elder

phaerimms  often  have  charmed  or  dominated

beings  ghting for them. In fact, phaerimms

sometimes pick  ghts simply so that

they can force their enemies to hack

apart their own friends. Phaerimms

also  enjoy  summoning  outsiders,

but  they  are  generally  too  proud  to

use  low-level  summoning  spells  to

call up common animals and other

minor creatures.

Claws: A phaerimm has the number

of  primary  claw  attacks  shown  on

Table 112. Each deals the indicated

damage plus the phaerimms Strength

bonus .

Bite:  A  phaerimm  has  one

secondary  bite  attack  that  deals

the  indicated  damage  plus  1/2  the

phaerimms  Strength  bonus  (round

down). Because the bite is a second-

ary attack, a 5 penalty applies to

the attack roll. (Many phaerimms

choose the Multiattack feat to lessen

this penalty to 2.)

Stinger:  A  phaerimm  has  one

secondary  stinger  attack  that  deals

the  indicated  damage  plus  1/2  the

phaerimms  Strength  bonus  (round

down).  A  young  adult  or  older

phaerimm  delivers  poison  with  its

stinger attack, and an adult or older

phaerimm can use it to implant eggs (see Implant,

below). Because the stinger is a secondary attack, a 5 penalty

applies to the attack roll. (Many phaerimms choose the Multi-

attack feat to lessen this penalty to 2.)

ture. The young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring

the host from inside. A remove disease spell rids a victim of the

eggs, as does a successful DC 20 Heal check made by a character

with ranks that skill. If the check fails, the healer can try again,

but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage

to the patient.

Poison (Su): Stinger, DC 15 Fortitude save; initial damage

paralysis  for  2d4  rounds,  secondary  damage  paralysis  for  1d3

hours. Paralyzed creatures levitate, helpless, a few feet off the

ground.

Spells: A phaerimm casts arcane

spells  as  a  sorcerer  (caster  level

equals phaerimms character level).

Phaerimms use their sorcerer spells

as if they were spell-like abilities, so

they  require  no  verbal,  somatic,  or

material components.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex):  A

phaerimm gains increasing damage

reduction as it grows older, as given

on Table 114.

Detect  Magic  (Sp):  Beginning

as a hatchling, a phaerimm can use

detect magic at will (caster level equals

phaerimms character level).

Flight (Ex): Because a phaerimms

body is naturally buoyant, it can  y

at a speed of 30 feet. This buoyancy

also grants the creature a permanent

feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

Full  Vision  (Ex):  As  it  ages,  a

phaerimms natural ability to detect

magic expands. A juvenile phaerimm

can see invisible or ethereal creatures

to  a  range  of  120  feet,  as  though

constantly under the effect of a see in-

visibility spell. An adult phaerimm

can see magical auras to a range of

120 feet, as though constantly under

the effect of an arcane sight spell. An

elder phaerimm sees as though constantly under

Telepathy (Ex): A juvenile or older phaerimm can commu-

a language.

Phaerimm Characters

A phaerimms favored class is sorcerer. Its sorcerer levels stack

with its base spellcasting ability for the purpose of determin-

ing  spells  known,  spells  per  day,  and  other  effects  dependent

on caster level. A phaerimm character cannot gain a familiar

unless it takes at least one level in a class that grants the abil-

ity to summon one, but thereafter its levels in that class stack

with its effective racial caster levels to determine the familiars

abilities.

rubble, and anyone willing to dig can shovel out enough rubble

to make a passage.

Tomb tappers understand Common, Netherese, and Undercom-

mon, but they do not speak. They can communicate with others

using telepathy, but they rarely say more than Drop your magic

items and run away.

Combat

Tomb tappers make good use of their tremorsense and burrowing

abilities  to  approach  potential  enemies  from  all  angles,  often

emerging from the rock in unexpected places.

Blindsight (Ex): A tomb tapper can ascertain all foes within

120 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, it treats

all foes as having total concealment. Negating a tomb tappers

sense of hearing (for example, by using a silence spell) negates

this ability.

Blindness  Immunities  (Ex):  Because  it  is  sightless,  a  tomb

tapper is immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and

other attack forms that rely on sight.

Construct Traits: A tomb tapper has immunity to poison, sleep

effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy

effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns,  and  morale  effects),  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is

not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.

It cannot heal damage, but can be repaired. It has darkvision out

to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Maul: Each tomb tapper is created with an adamantine +1

maul sized for it. In the hands of a tomb tapper, the weapon

gains the throwing and returning special abilities. A thaalud that

loses its maul searches tirelessly for it. If a maul is destroyed, the

thaalud that created it can make a new one from 100 pounds of

adamantine after one year.

Repair (Su): A stone shape effect repairs damage equal to 1d8

+ caster level if used on a tomb tapper. The creature can use its

own spell-like abilities to repair itself.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect magic; 7/daystone shape;

3/dayspike stones (DC 17). Caster level 8th.

Telepathy (Su): A tomb tapper can communicate with any

creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Tremorsense (Ex): Tomb tappers can automatically sense the

location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the

ground.

Construction

While the secrets of thaalud construction have long been lost to

the world at large, the tomb tappers know the secret of making

more  of  their  kind.  They  usually  choose  to  replace  destroyed

individuals, but they never increase their total number.

Five thaalud cooperating with each other can fashion a new

tomb tapper in 100 days. The exact requirements of the ritual

are  not  known,  but  the  tomb  tappers  must  fashion  the  new

individuals body from stone, iron, and at least 10,000 gp worth

of adamantine.

Tomb tapper

This ebon giant stands more than 15 feet tall. Its face is a blank,

smooth oval, and its body is smooth and featureless except for an

enormous maw that gapes in the center of its torso. It wears no

armor or clothing but carries a huge, two-handed hammer.

Tomb tappers, also called thaalud, are ancient constructs  rst

created many centuries ago by the mighty arcanists of Netheril.

Designed to be tireless weapons in the arcanists battles against

the phaerimms, the tomb tappers became an independent race

of intelligent constructs after Netherils fall. Now they roam the

deep places of the world, seeking magic.

A tomb tapper is a faceless being made of enchanted rock

and iron. It stands about 16 feet tall and weighs about 16,000

pounds. Each one carries an enormous maul.

Thaalud  are  driven  by  their  ancient  imperatives  to  hoard

magic, and they often tunnel into forgotten crypts to pillage their

treasureshence their common name. Nor are these creatures

above robbing adventurers of their magic items. Thaalud revere

magic to the point that they usually conceal their prizes in hidden

vaults instead of making use of them.

A tomb tapper can burrow through solid stone with its iron-

hard talons and rock-shredding maw. A tomb tapper does not

leave a usable tunnel, but its passage creates a cylindrical area of

pulverized stone 10 feet in diameter. Other creatures that cant

burrow through rock can still burrow through the tomb tappers

Combat

Tressyms are shy and skittish, and they tend to avoid combat with

anything larger than themselvesusually by  ying away. They

avoid large  ying opponents by going to ground and trying to

 nd a small crevice or hole to hide in.

Skills: A tressym receives a +8 racial bonus on Balance checks

and  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide  and  Move  Silently

checks. It uses its Dexterity modi er for Climb checks.

In areas of tall grass or trees in leaf, the tressyms Hide

bonus rises to +8.

This massive, wormlike creature marches slowly on twenty stubby,

paired legs. Its skin is bright green with blue stripes and mauve

patches. Two hornlike antennae jut from the top of its head, above

its clacking mandibles.

The giant velvet worm is an enormous version of an invertebrate

similar to a caterpillar. It shoots sticky strands of quick-hardening

glue from its large, mobile antennae to immobilize its prey.

A giant velvet worm is about 30 feet long and weighs roughly

8,000 pounds.

Combat

The giant velvet worm is too slow to catch most prey, so it traps

its victims with strands of glue and then closes in to devour its

victims.

Glue Strand (Ex): A giant velvet worm can shoot a stream

of quick-drying glue up to 100 feet. Any creature struck by a

glue strand is entangled for 2d4 rounds and must make a DC 18

Re ex save or be stuck to the ground, unable to move. Even on

a successful save, it can move at only half speed. A winged  ying

creature is not stuck to the ground, but it must make a DC 15

Re ex save or fall to the ground and be stuck there by the glue

A creature stuck to the ground by the giant velvet worms

glue can break free with a successful DC 18 Strength check, or

by dealing 10 points of damage to the strand with a slashing

weapon. A creature trying to scrape glue off itself, or a creature

assisting  another  creature  to  do  so,  need  not  make  an  attack

roll; hitting the glue is automatic. For each hit, the attacking

creature makes a damage roll. Once free, however, the creature

is still entangled until the glue wears off.

The velvet worm often continues to throw glue strands onto

creatures that are already stuck in order to prevent escape. Each ad-

ditional strand that hits the target increases the DC of the Strength

check to break free by 2 and adds 10 hit points to the gluey mass

and 2 rounds to the duration of the victims entanglement.

Poison  (Ex):  Bite,  Fortitude  DC  18,  initial  and  secondary

damage 1d4 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tremorsense (Ex): A giant velvet worm can locate any creature

within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.

Vermin Traits: A giant velvet worm is immune to all mind-

affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and

morale effects). It also has darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: A giant velvet worm has a +4 racial

bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Lost Empires of Faern Web Enhancement

Adventure

Background

Mulhorandi  and  Imaskari  ruins  dot  the  landscape  in  and  around

the area known as the Raurin Desert, which was once the seat of

the mighty Imaskar Empire. One such ruin, the fort of Maskana,

lies  on  the  southern  edge  of  the  Plains  of  Purple  Dust,  a  little

closer  to  the  Dragonsword  Mountains  than  to  the  Giants  Belt.

This  Mulhorandi  fortress  was  built  just  before  the  fall  of  the

Imaskar  Empire,  to  guard  the  Mulhorandi  against  incursions  by

their  former  masters.  Eventually  the  danger  of  such  attacks

passed,  and  the  fortress  fell  into  disuse  and  then  ruin.  Over  the

centuries,  the  ruined  fortress  has  been  thoroughly  explored  by

adventurers,  scholars,  and  looters,  who  ferreted  out  whatever

secrets it may once have held. Now the site is nothing more than

a curiosity to most.

But one secret of Maskana remains undiscovered. The Mulho-

randi  ruin  was  built  atop  an  older  Imaskari  fortress  that  had

fallen  into  disuse  centuries  earlier.  The  ancient  Mulhorandi

wanted  to  keep  track  of  this  location  because  it  contained  a

number of permanent extradimensional spaces that they hoped to

utilize  someday.  But  in  the  chaos  of  the  uprising,  the  old  ruins

were forgotten.

The ruin is decorated with Mulhorandi pictographs in an almost

aggressive way, as if the people who built it wanted to leave no room

for Imaskari influence. One of these drawings, however, contains an

oddity that has gone undiscovered until recently. An explorer named

Jarval Keth recognized one of the symbols, which had always been

assumed to be Mulhorandi, as the work of the Imaskari. Excitedly,

he returned to Gheldaneth to investigate further. There he ran afoul

of  Tyaral,  a  cleric  of  the  dead  god  Bhaal,  who  sought  a  source  of

power to help revive his deity. Upon hearing of the ancient Imaskari

image,  Tyaral  captured  Jarval  Keth  and  tortured  him  until  he

revealed all he knew. Then Tyaral set off for the ruin to investigate

the explorers story.

Unbeknownst to Tyaral, Jarval Keth has escaped confinement,

stowed away on a ship sailing west, and made his way to the area

where the heroes are resting between adventures. Upon noticing

that  he  was  gone,  Sithena  Tinzon,  Tyarals  chief  inquisitor  and

torturer,  immediately  set  off  in  pursuit  with  three  minions.

Through her powers of persuasion, she learned which ship Keth

had boarded. By hiring a faster one, she reached Keths destina-

tion ahead of him. Now she lies in wait to kill Keth as soon as he

surfaces.

Adventure

Synopsis

Just  as  Jarval  Keth  makes  contact  with  the  PCs,  forces  loyal  to

Tyaral attack the explorer. Whether he dies in the encounter or not,

Keth passes on a clue about his find. If the PCs wish to investigate,

they must travel east to Mulhorand and investigate the strange pic-

tograph that Keth described. At Maskana, they find the secret door

into  the  older  Imaskari  ruin,  fight  several  ancient  creatures,  and

confront  Tyaral  just  as  he  unearths  an  ancient  Imaskari  artifact

that has lain hidden for centuries.

Adventure Hooks

As DM, you know best how to involve your PCs in an adventure.

Though this one comes to the PCs in the person of Jarval Keth, you

can  use  one  of  the  following  suggestions  to  draw  them  into  the

action.

The  PCs  have  heard  rumors  of  ancient  Imaskari  magic  buried

beneath the sands of the Raurin Desert.

Jarval  Keth  is  a  distant  relative  of  a  PC  and  charges  the  group

with uncovering the truth of his find.

An old enemy of Tyaral hires the PCs to investigate his activities.

Beginning the

Adventure

Secrets of Imaskar begins as an event-based scenario and ends with

the exploration of a keyed site. The adventure begins wherever the

PCs are currently based. The events proceed more smoothly if they

are  near  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Stars,  but  you  can  make  the  necessary

adaptations for any area of Faern.

A. Death in a

Faraway Land (EL 7)

Sithena Tinzon finds Jarval Keth as soon as he encounters the PCs.

Ideally, this encounter should take place at night on the docks or in

an alley.

The night is dark, and Selnes face is hidden behind clouds, cast-

ing the narrow streets of the port district into deep shadow. Sud-

denly, a man stumbles forward out of the night. He is still some

distance away when four humanoid figures move toward him in a

menacing manner. The man starts to run, and the terror on his

face becomes clearer as he moves closer. The purple fort in the

east hides the secrets of Imaskars past glories behind the crescent

and the fox, he gasps. Dont let them succeed. . . . Before the

man can utter another word, his attackers are upon him.

The villains attack as soon as Keth utters the word succeed.

Creatures: Sithena Tinzon and her three minions are all Mulho-

randi (Mulan) humans, as is Jarval Keth.

Sithena is proud and cruel. She started life in the streets and does-

nt want to return there. In her youth, she embraced the worship of

Bhaal  to  ensure  that  she  could  treat  others  with  the  same  cruelty

that she herself had been treated. She earnestly desires not to fail

Tyaralnot because she is afraid of him, but because she wants to

advance in power, and he is her means to that goal.

Because of the torture he has endured at Sithenas hands, Jarval

Keth is mentally deranged and unable to communicate coherently.

He goes off on tangents easily, forgets important points, and speaks

in  vague  phrases.  Only  a  heal spell  can  restore  his  sanity  at  this

point.

*New feat from Lost Empires of Faern.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Sithena deals 1d6 extra points of damage on

any  successful  attack  against  flat-footed  or  flanked  targets,  or

against  a  target  that  has  been  denied  its  Dexterity  bonus  for  any

reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up

to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without dis-

cernible  anatomies,  and  creatures  immune  to  extra  damage  from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Sithena may choose to

deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using

a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): Sithena can find, disarm, or bypass traps with

a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to find, and the

Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the

spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the traps

DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without trig-

gering or disarming it.

Cleric Spells Prepared (caster level 4th): 0cure minor wounds

(2), detect magic, light, resistance; 1stcommand (DC 13), cure light

wounds, doom (DC 13), faith healing (Magic of Faern), inflict light

falchion,  light  crossbow  with  10  bolts,  travel  clothes,  2  potions  of

cure light wounds

Tactics: Sithena Tinzon and her minions reach the PCs just after

Keth  blurts  out  his  garbled  message,  and  they  attack  him

immediately. They have no reason to attack the PCs unless they try

to  intervene.  Sithena  uses  death  knell on  Keth  as  soon  as  he  falls

unconscious.

Development:  If  Keth  dies,  Tinzon  tries  to  cut  off  his  head,

intending to take it back to Mulhorand with her. If the PCs manage

to slay the attackers, they can easily discern that all four are Mul-

horandi by searching their personal possessions. If Keth survives this

encounter and his sanity is restored, he can reveal the information

he  knows  (see  Adventure  Background),  and  he  asks  the  PCs  to

accompany him to the ruins and help him explore his new find.

Troubleshooting: If your PCs are not interested in going to Mul-

horand to investigate this lead, Tyaral soon discovers what happened

to  Sithena.  He  decides  to  make  an  example  of  those  who  slew  his

trusted lieutenant, so he sends wave after wave of attackers to kill

the PCs. If you choose this method, you may have to alter the end

of the adventure a bit by giving Tyaral a fortified position and some

minions at the ruins of Maskana.

B. Finding the Path

The PCs trip to Mulhorand proceeds without incident provided that

Sithena  Tinzon  is  dead.  If  she  escaped,  she  attacks  them  again

either on the way or upon their arrival, as you choose.

Jarval Keth did not tell the PCs where to start their search; he

described only their final goal. Since the central section of Mulho-

rand  is  sparsely  populated  with  rural  folk,  the  characters  best

chance of learning any helpful information in his absence is in one

of  the  coastal  cities.  The  most  likely  choices  are  Skuld  and  Ghel-

daneth, but the PCs might also want to visit Neldorid.

In any of these cities, the PCs can learn about the general history

of the region (as described in Lost Empires of Faern) and the loca-

tions of known ruins. Plenty of records exist on both topics, so find-

ing  the  locations  of  the  six  known  ruined  forts  in  the  Plains  of

Purple Dust region (and of at least fifteen other suspected ruin sites)

is  an  easy  task  (Gather  Information  DC  10).  Acquiring  any  other

information requires considerable digging. Anyone the PCs ask about

such  an  issue  directs  them  to  the  Great  University  at  Gheldaneth

(see encounter C).

C. The Great

University at

Gheldaneth

The best source of information about Maskana is Gheldaneth, where

Jarval  Keth  performed  his  research  before  he  was  abducted.  Ghel-

daneth is the site of the Great University, which houses detailed his-

torical records and other materials relating to ancient Mulhorand.

It was here that Jarval Keth performed his follow-up research after

finding the Imaskari image.

PCs who manage to talk to someone at the university about Keth

(Diplomacy DC 20 because they are not members) discover that he

was interested in specific Imaskari images and was poring over old

records of them before he disappeared. If they request the materials

that he was studying and peruse them carefully (Search DC 15), they

can find the ancient Imaskari representations of crescent moons and

foxes, and even compare them to Mulhorandi images of the same

subjects.  The  Imaskari  and  Mulhorandi  representations  are  very

3

Lost Empires of Faern Web Enhancement

similar, but slight differences make them distinct from one another.

Careful  perusal  of  these  records  combined  with  knowledge  of  the

area (Gather Information or Knowledge [Mulhorand local] DC 18)

also reveals which ruin Keth must have visited most recently.

D. The Mean Drunk

(EL 5)

Mulhorand  is  a  class-based  society,  and  tensions  flare  readily

between people of different social standing. Adventurers rank near

the bottom, at about the same level as grave robbers, and the bureau-

crats tend to treat them accordingly. While the PCs are in a tavern

one night, they are accosted by a drunken bureaucrat who wants to

vent some aggression he has built up over family problems.

Upon entering the establishment, the PCs see a group of bureau-

crats drinking liberally, as if in celebration. They dont want com-

panyespecially that of adventurers and foreignersso they rudely

rebuff any PCs who try to join them. As the evening progresses, the

bureaucrats become more and more drunk, and their mood slowly

changes  from  happy  to  angry.  Read  or  paraphrase  the  following

aloud when the confrontation occurs, adapting the text as needed if

the PCs actually hail from Mulhorand.

Grave-robbing foreigners, thats what you are! says one of the

drunken men in a loud voice. You heard me! My slave is better

than  you  are,  you  filthy  outlander!  Three  other  men  gather

behind  the  speaker,  but  whether  they  intend  to  support  him  or

restrain him is not clear.

The speaker, Anheris, is angry and frustrated with life. Because of

his dour mood, he is determined to provoke a fight, even though he

knows  hes  likely  to  spend  the  night  in  jail  for  it.  Once  combat

begins, Anheriss three companions join in on his side.

Creatures:  Anheris  and  his  friends  are  normal  Mulan  humans.

Anheris is a bureaucrat in the temple of Anhur, and the family trou-

bles he is having right now have put him in a bad mood. He doesnt

hate  the  PCs  specifically;  they  are  just  convenient  targets  for  his

wrath.

D Anheris: Male  human  (Mulan)  expert  3;  CR  2;  Medium

Spot +8; Alertness, Skill Focus (Craft [woodworking]).

Possessions: None of importance.

Development:  If  this  encounter  takes  place  in  Gheldaneth,

Anheris has information of value to the PCs. Should they win the

battle  without  killing  the  woodworker,  they  can  interrogate  him.

A good line of questioning coupled with a DC 20 Intimidate check

or a DC 15 Diplomacy check reveals that Anheris saw Jarval Keth

hanging  around  the  temples  trying  to  talk  with  the  priests.  He

doesnt know the subject of these discussions, but hes sure the man

was up to no good. In addition, on the day that Keth disappeared,

Anheris  saw  him  in  the  company  of  a  man  who  had  a  very  pale,

almost  skull-like  face.  Jarval  seemed  uncomfortable  in  the  mans

company, but he didnt call for any help.

Asking  about  Keth  at  the  temples  he  visited  produces  no  new

information.  The  priests  know  only  that  Keth  was  interested  in

Imaskari religious imagery, and they didnt have any samples avail-

able. They all recommended that he try the Great University.

E. Guide Through

the Wilderness

When the PCs are ready to travel into the desert in search of the

ruin that Keth visited, they may want to hire a guide to lead them.

They  dont  really  need  one,  but  if  they  have  not  traveled  in  this

region before, they may want to take the precaution of hiring one,

since  getting  lost  in  this  country  is  quite  dangerous.  Most  guides

wont  venture  into  the  Plains  of  Purple  Dust  at  all,  but  a  DC  15

Diplomacy  or  Gather  Information  check  produces  the  name  of  a

man who is willing to take them there.

Creatures: Museris,  a  guide  who  regularly  braves  the  Plains  of

Purple Dust, is a normal human (Mulan) male. Though he is the son

of a soldier, he chose not to enter the army himself because he dis-

agreed with the pharoahs plans for expansion. Instead, he traveled

north  to  Aglarond,  where  he  learned  about  the  wilderness.  After

returning to Mulhorand, he spent years learning how to survive in

the  dusty  deserts  of  his  homeland,  and  now  he  makes  his  living

exploring ruins and ancient sites where others fear to tread and guid-

ing clients through places of danger. He charges 100 gp per week,

plus expenses.

Museris  is  practical  and  competent,  but  he  always  thinks  he  is

right  and  tends  to  belittle  the  opinions  of  othersuntil  they  are

proven right. He is not afraid of traveling into the desert, but he has

explored the ruin that the PCs are interested in and is sure that noth-

ing of interest remains there.

If  the  PCs  are  attacked  while  in  the  company  of  their  guide,

Museris fights beside them until his life is really threatened. At that

point, he retreats, but he wont leave the PCs to die.

F. The Ruins,

Top Level

The trip to the ruins can be without incident, or you can present the

PCs with random desert and plains encounters along the way.

The ruin known as Maskana was once a Mulhorandi outpost built

into the side of a flat hill at the edge of the Plains of Purple Dust.

An Imaskari fortress once covered the whole hilltop, but the Mul-

horandi destroyed it early in their uprising, tearing it down to the

very ground. The former slaves then built their own fortress against

the side of the hill, facing east toward the Imaskari capital city. The

reason for its placement was twofold: to guard against the Imaskari,

and  to  block  access  to  the  hidden  sublevel  of  the  ruined  Imaskari

fortress. One of the forts towers rose above the hilltop, providing a

good view of the surrounding area. Eventually, this fortress fell into

disuse, and the Plains of Purple Dust wore it away to ruin.

Walls

Crumbling walls no more than 3 feet high mark where Maskanas

outer walls once stood. Hewn purple stones from these walls have

fallen into the central courtyard, where they now lie half-buried in

the  dust.  The  interior  structures,  built  in  haste  from  wood  rather

than stone, have disintegrated completely.

The only wall that now stands more than 3 feet high is the back

one, which is braced against the hillside. All of the interior wall sur-

faces are covered with faded religious and cultural imagery common

to  the  Mulhorandi  of  ancient  times.  These  symbols  are  all  recog-

nized as Mulhorandi today, even though many of them have several

variants. (For example, at least four fox depictions, each a little dif-

ferent from the others, decorate the walls, and all are thought to be

Mulhorandi.). A successful DC 30 Search check (or DC 20 for PCs

who have spent time researching symbols at the Great University)

is required to locate the Imaskari fox-and-crescent image that Jarval

Keth found. A character can take 20 on these checks, but doing so

requires  an  hour  of  searching  rather  than  the  usual  2  minutes

because of the chaotic nature of the ruins. The symbol in question is

on the back wall among various Mulhorandi symbols placed here to

ward  against  threats  from  the  old  Imaskari  ruins  within  the  hill.

The Imaskari symbol stands for the Artificers Guild and marks the

secret door leading into the hill (encounter F1).

Nothing else of interest remains in the ruins of the Mulhorandi

fortress, since they were explored and looted long ago.

F1. The Secret Way

into Old Imaskar

The secret door into the Imaskari sublevel is marked on the map.

The  Search  DC  to  locate  it  is  30  for  a  character  who  has  already

found the Imaskari image or 40 for one who has not.

A character who has found the secret door must make a DC 25

Search check to locate the opening mechanism because fallen stones

have concealed the trigger stone from view. The DC is 40 for a char-

acter who doesnt know the secret door is there. Taking 20 on this

check also requires a full hour.

F2. The Desert Creature

(EL 6)

While the PCs are searching the ruins, some creatures of the ancient

desert enter the area in search of food.

Creatures: The four giant whip scorpions that have come here to

hunt  are  covered  in  purple  dust,  so  they  look  like  bizarre,  purple

scorpions.  These  creatures  live  in  colonies  in  the  Plains  of  Purple

Dust, where they harry travelers and serve as snacks for the drag-

ons dwelling there.

D Giant  Whip  Scorpions  (4): hp  30  each;  see  Lost  Empires  of

Faern, page 160.

Tactics:  The  giant  whip  scorpions  attack  immediately  because

they  are  hungry.  Like  any  other  mindless  creatures,  they  simply

attack anything that appears edible until it is dead, and then they

eat it if no other obvious dangers are threatening them. They may

attempt to drag a dead PC into the desert where they can consume

the corpse in peace, since they have no reason to fight all the PCs

once they have secured a meal.

G. The Ruins,

Lower Level

The secret door opens on a hallway leading into darkness. This sec-

tion of the ruins appears much older than the surface structures and

is in fact about 3,500 years old. The walls are built of purple stones

hewn in the same manner as those in other Imaskari ruins, and they

are in excellent condition because they have been spared the rigors

of weather for all these centuries. The corridor is unlit, and the tem-

perature is a constant 51 degrees Fahrenheit. All spaces within this

underground complex are 10 feet high unless otherwise specified in

a particular area description.

This sublevel once lay beneath an Imaskari fortress atop the hill.

The  belowground  portion  was  an  Imaskari  research  facility  where

artificers  investigated  the  abilities  of  unusual  creatures.  These

researchers made use of several permanent extradimensional spaces

within the normally constructed rooms. Thus, some of the rooms in

the complex are larger than they appear and radiate strong trans-

mutation magic.

G1. Storage

Mounted on stands in this chamber are four suits of banded armor

and five suits of splint mail that belonged to the defenders of the

fortress  that  once  stood  above  these  ruins.  The  armor  is  in  good

condition without a speck of rust, but it is not of any special quality.

A historian might pay double the book value for these pieces because

of their age and origin.

actually  measures  40  feet  by  90  feet,  rather  than  the  dimensions

shown on the map. The door is in the center of the wall.

G2. Barracks

On the map, this room appears to measure 20 feet by 30 feet, but

in fact it is 70 feet by 120 feet. Read or paraphrase the following

when the PCs enter.

More  than  fifty  bunk  beds,  all  in  perfect  condition,  fill  the

chamber, aligned in perfect rows. A trunk stands at the foot of

each bed.

This area once served as the barracks for the fortresss troops. All

the trunks are empty.

G3. The Eternal Guardians

(EL 8)

All areas marked 3 on the map have the same general description,

regardless of their shapes. These rooms served as personal quarters

for various Imaskari artificers, but their former occupants cleaned

them  out  long  ago.  Only  the  comfortable  beds  remain,  and  those

have decayed with age.

The Imaskari had plans to return to the fortress as soon as the

slave  uprising  was  put  down,  so  they  set  some  guardians  in  these

rooms to protect them from unwanted intruders before abandoning

the  place.  Unfortunately,  the  original  occupants  never  got  the

chance to return.

Creatures: Each of these rooms is now home to a helmed horror.

D Helmed Horrors (3): hp 94 each; see Lost Empires of Faern,

page 172.

Tactics:  The  helmed  horrors  have  been  programmed  to  attack

anyone they see who does not bear the emblem of the Imaskari arti-

ficers.  All  such  emblems  that  were  known  to  exist  were  destroyed

after the uprising, and none are left within these ruins.

G4. Crawling Pool (EL 4)

The artificers who worked here and the soldiers who guarded them

used this room as a communal bathing pool. Read or paraphrase the

following when the PCs enter.

A pool of water occupies the center of this chamber. In the

far  corners  lie  a  couple  of  skeletons  that  are  missing  their

hands.

The skeletons are the remains of slaves who revolted and were killed.

The pool is 3 feet deep. Anyone who looks into its clear water sees

immediately that it is full of hands.

Creatures:  The  hands  are  actually  crawling  claws  that  were

dumped here when their masters left.

D Crawling  Claw  Swarms  (2):  hp  30  each;  see  Lost  Empires  of

Faern, page 163.

Tactics:  The  swarms  jump  out  of  the  water  and  attack  anyone

within 3 feet of the waters edge.

G5. Empty Room

This room is completely empty. Evidently, the Imaskari artificers

did  not  want  to  leave  any  clues  as  to  its  true  purpose.  The  room

G6. Sliding Wall Trap (EL 6)

This wide hallway was designed as a trap to slow down invaders and

keep  them  from  reaching  the  main  laboratory  until  the  artificers

could cast their preparation spells.

Trap: Whenever three creatures enter the hallway, extra wall sec-

tions slide down and close off the two exits. Then the two walls far-

thest apart (the east and west walls) begin to slide toward each other

at  a  rate  of  5  feet  per  round.  The  trap  can  be  bypassed  easily  by

allowing only one or two people in the hallway at a time. All the

walls are made of purple stone.

a Compacting Room Trap: CR 6; mechanical; proximity trigger;

automatic reset; walls move together (12d6, crush); multiple targets

(all targets in the room); never miss; Search DC 20; Disable Device

DC 22. Market Price: 23,400 gp.

s Moving Walls: 5 ft. thick, hardness 8, hp 270.

s Blocking Walls: 6 in. thick, hardness 8, hp 90.

G7. Lounge

This room was once a lounge and study area for the artificers, but it

is mostly empty now. The only remaining furnishings are a moldy

couch in the center of the room and a bookcase on the east wall that

holds only dust.

G8. Main Laboratory

This  room  served  as  the  artificers  main  laboratory.  It  appears  to

measure  30  feet  by  40  feet,  but  the  permanent  extradimensional

space within it extends the dimensions to the north and east, making

its actual size 90 feet by 120 feet. The pillar pattern does not repeat,

and the room has no other exits other than those shown on the map.

The larger part of the room is full of tables and lab benches, some

equipped with racks for vials and flasks. Drawers in the benches hold

strange tools and a vast quantity of blank parchment. Feel free to

stock this part of the room with any items you would like to intro-

duce into your campaign.

The stairs in the corner of the room lead down half a flight to

area  G9.  This  area  is  visible  through  the  wall  next  to  the  stairs,

which is a standard portcullis. A Mulan human male (Tyaral) traces

an image on the wall of area G9 (see below).

Development: Tyaral can hear the PCs enter area G8, but he is

too caught up in his activities to take any action the first round. In

the second round after their entry, he begins casting his preparatory

spells (see the Tactics section of area G9).

G9. The Zealot (EL 9)

This small room once housed the library used by the artificers work-

ing in the laboratory above. Only empty shelves are left now, since

the artificers valued these books too much to leave any behind when

they departed. Unbeknownst to them, however, more senior artifi-

cers had hidden an important Imaskari artifact in a secret compart-

ment in the wall. Since the artificers of this fortress did not know it

was there, they served as the perfect guards for it.

Tyaral and the two flameskulls that accompany him have already

found their way into this room, having avoided two of the helmed

horror guards in the other chambers. The priest has been exploring

Lost Empires of Faern Web Enhancement

the  complex  for  a  week  now,  and  he  has  at  last  found  the  secret

compartment that conceals the artifact.

When the PCs first arrive, he is muttering a spell that he hopes

will unlock the secret door. It does so on the following round, allow-

ing him a good view of the artifact that lies inside. At that point, he

notices  the  PCs  and  begins  preparing  to  fight  them.  Tyarals  only

escape route from the complex is the one he used to enter, and he

must get past the PCs to use it. Tyaral has no intention of leaving

without the artifact.

Creatures: Tyaral is a Mulan human consumed with the desire to

bring back his dead god, Bhaal. He was a priest of Bhaal at the time

the  god  was  murdered,  and  that  event  unhinged  his  mind.  Tyaral

knows he needs powerful magic to effect the return of a god, so he

has been collecting all he can find.

D Flameskulls (2): hp 28; see Lost Empires of Faern, page 168.

Tactics: If Tyaral somehow becomes aware of the PCs presence

before they reach area G8, he casts deathwatch to warn him of their

approach before returning to his business. If he notices them in area

G8, he casts divine power and then bulls strength to give himself an

additional +7 bonus on his attack and damage rolls. He uses spells in

melee when they seem appropriate and knows which sorts of char-

acters  are  likely  to  be  more  vulnerable  than  others  to  particular

spells  (that  is,  he  knows  that  fighter-types  are  likely  to  fail  Will

saves, and wizard-types are likely to fail Fortitude saves). He spon-

taneously  casts  inflict  wounds spells  in  combat  whenever  he  feels

that his other spells would not be useful, and he uses death knell on

downed PCs to gain extra hit points.

The  two  flameskulls  attack  until  destroyed,  preferably  from  a

distance.

Development: Once  Tyaral  is  dead,  go  to  Concluding  the

Adventure.

Treasure: In addition to his own equipment, Tyaral now has the

artifact from the secret compartment. Its nature is up to you, but

the Seventh Imaskarcanaa fabled artifact of ancient Imaskar that

resembles a large, golden keyis an appropriate choice. The Seventh

Imaskarcana holds  the  entire  body  of  Imaskari  knowledge  about

creating  permanent  extradimensional  spaces,  and  it  also  has  addi-

tional powers that are left to your discretion. See page 158 of Lost

Empires  of  Faern to  aid  in  your  design  of  this  artifact.  If  you

prefer a less powerful item, simply select an appropriate one from

the  list  of  ancient  magic  items  in  Chapter  10  of  Lost  Empires  of

Faern.

G10. Downward Stairs

These stairs lead downward to an area that was once a lower level of

the complex. In the centuries that this place has lain empty, how-

ever, the stairway has collapsed, and no clear path to this level cur-

rently exists.

Concluding the

Adventure

Once Tyaral is dead, the adventure is over. The church of Bhaal has

lost a major power, and the dead gods return has been immeasurably

delayed. If Jarval Keth is still alive, he undertakes a serious study of

the  underground  Imaskari  complex,  perhaps  hiring  the  PCs  as

guards while he does so.

Further Adventures

The  artifact  that  Tyaral  discovered  in  this  complex  has  probably

been sought by powerful wizards and clerics for centuries. If it falls

into the PCs hands, they immediately become targets for those who

wish to retrieve it. They can either decipher its powers and try to

make use of it themselves, or sell it to someone who is unlikely to

misuse it.

Tyaral can become a recurring villain whether he escaped alive

or  not.  Since  he  serves  Bhaal,  the  dead  god  of  murder,  he  might

well return as a vengeful undead spirit even if the PCs managed to

kill him.

The PCs might also wish to come back to the complex when they

have  gained  more  power  and  try  to  unearth  the  stairway  leading

down  (area  10).  That  area  is  left  for  you  to  develop  as  you  wish,

using material on Imaskar from Lost Empires of Faern.
