Introduction

When elder evils stir, the world groans; when they awaken,

the  world  weeps.  Buried  in  the  deepest  bowels  of  the

Underdark, hidden in the farthest reaches of the multi-

verse, or lost in the gulfs between realities are terrible things

that exist only to destroy or horribly remake creation. So

mighty are these ancient beings that even the gods think

twice about standing against them. Mortals who are aware

of  their  existence  viciously  suppress  that  knowledge

and  destroy  any  who  would  serve  such  things.  Even  if

an  elder  evil  can  be  forced  back  to  whence  it  came,  its

mere presence changes the world forever. In short, it is a

campaign ender.

EVIL TO CHALLENGE

THE GODS

The  Elder  Evils  supplement  presents  a  catalog  of  some  of

the most infamous and terrible creatures ever to plague the

multiverse. From an undead world born at the moment of

creation, to terrifying monstrosities that clawed their way

out of the Abyss, to unthinkable entities from beyond the

planes, these beings exemplify horrors that can destroy not

just a kingdom but entire worlds or even existence itself.

Most elder evils have been imprisoned by great heroes,

deities, or other powerful beings who fear their release. Yet

they are not so easily forgotten: Whispers of their existence

seduce the mad and villainous, promising great power in

exchange for release. Thus, each elder evil presented here

has one or more servants, also described in detail.

Chapter 1. Evil Does Not Sleep: This section provides

suggestions for introducing an elder evil into the campaign

as well as signs that bring the end times to your world. New

feats and male c properties add horror and power to elder

evils and their servants.

Chapter 2. Atropus: This moonlike orb is the stillborn

afterbirth of the worlds creation, an undead entity that

desires nothing less than the end of the entire multiverse.

Chapter 3. Father Llymic: Although his body lies frozen

in a prison of ice, the mind of this utterly alien being is

glacially aware. His corrosive form slowly infects his sur-

roundings, reaching gradually to make the world a part of

himself. His corrupt Brood roams free, spreading evil in

preparation for their masters awakening.

Chapter 4. Hulks of Zoretha: Left behind in the wake

of a world-shaking storm a century past, these enigmatic

monoliths hold a secret known by only a few. The Hulks

are the seeds of a monstrous colonization project, awaiting

a signal from a parallel plane. Once it is received, they will

animate to carve a path of destruction.

Chapter 5. Leviathan: Leviathan is a creature of bestial

intelligence whose enormous coils wrap the world. It sleeps

in the deepest trenches of the seas, spawning tsunamis,

whirlpools, and earthquakes as it restlessly shifts. Now mad

cultists seek to wake the beast and submerge all the lands.

Chapter 6. Pandorym: Pandorym is a doomsday weapon,

an entity from beyond the multiverse. Ancient wizards

summoned it as a deterrent to defend their empire from

vengeful  deities.  However,  the  raging  gods  ended  the

kingdoms reign before it could release the weapon. Pandorym

now lingers, its essence split and imprisoned, waiting for

releaseand vengeance.

Chapter 7. Ragnorra: Arising in a time before creation,

Ragnorra is a force of perverted life that births monstrosities

from her swollen body. The deities cast her into the sky, but

she reappears as a blood-red comet every 500 years. Dreadful

seed and falling stars produce monstrous offspring in worlds

Ragnorra approachesand now she smashes into worlds to

remake them directly.

Chapter 8. Sertrous: Sertrous began as a demon, one of the

obyrithsa remnant demonic race shuddering toward extinc-

tion. With the rise of the tanarri, Sertrous was exiled from

the Abyss and took the form of a monstrous serpent, granting

vile powers to the yuan-ti in exchange for their service. Even

though he was slain, Sertrous lingers in spirit and continues

to corrupt the snake people. His followers, the Vanguard of

Sertrous, employ intrigue and magic to gain in uence and

ultimately bring about the end of the world.

Chapter 9. The Worm that Walks: This elder evil is the

memory of a slain corporeal god. Its essence transferred itself

to the worms and maggots that devoured the deitys corpse,

forming a hideous but vaguely humanoid shape. The horror

was sealed away in an obelisk by heroes of a previous age. It

seeks ever to escape and eat its way to world domination, one

writhing victim at a time.

Chapter 10. Zargon: According to legend, Zargon cannot

be killed unless his horn is severed from his body, and if his

horn is not destroyed, he will inevitably return to claim it.

The immortals could not discover a means of destroying his

horn, and thus they entombed Zargon and a whole city of

his mad worshipers in a place now lost to history.

The following pages present incomprehensible horrors,

threats to the campaign setting so powerful as to bring it to

an end. These beings have nothing less in mind than the

utter destruction of a world or even existence itself. Even if

their genocidal plans are not completely realized, they can

leave the world unrecognizable.

Elder evils are not just monsters with impressive Challenge

Ratings. They are campaign capstones. Their abilities outstrip

those of even the most powerful player characters. In some

cases, the PCs do not confront the elder evil itself, but only

a mighty extension of its foul will. It might be possible to

 ght and even defeat such creatures, but their very existence

unalterably changes the world.

If ending the world isnt on your horizon just yet, the foes

described in the following chapters make exciting challenges

for your campaigns high-level adventurers. They and their

powerful minions are the basis for grand story arcs that pit the

characters against the greatest threats facing their existence.

As an individual challenge, any of the monsters presented

here offers a memorable confrontation. An adventure need

not conclude with encountering the elder evil itself; the PCs

might thwart the plans of villains early enough to prevent

an apocalyptic outcome.

If you are ready to bring your campaign to a close,

though, start with this chapter. It sets out the basics of

incorporating these beings into your worlds history.

As  well,  it  provides  some  advice  on  ending  it  all  in

a  way  that  is  not  only  memorable  and  exciting,  but

satisfying too.

THE END TIMES

The shrieks, the laughter, the wailing! We were going mad.

We knew not why or how, but delusions and hallucinations

ruled our feverish minds.

You  might  be  wondering  why  you  should  ever  end

your campaign: Things are going fine, and youre

having fun.

To cite a clich, all good things must come to an

end. Even if youre not ready to stop now, one day

you will be. At some point, the PCs ascend the heady

heights of epic levels, and fewer and fewer foes

can challenge them. When player characters own

castles and lands, command continent-spanning

organizations, lead entire religious movements, or

are generals of armies no longer content with mortal

wars, your campaign is approaching a natural close.

You could forge on, having the PCs challenge the gods them-

selves, but even then, the tale has to end someday.

Ending a campaign is a signi cant achievement. It is a

natural conclusion to all the stories you and your players

have told together, and it gives everyone a feeling of accom-

plishment after years of play. In addition, bringing your

campaign to a close lets you embark on something different,

exploring  new  worlds  and  possibilitiesin  short,  death

leads to rebirth.

INCORPORATING

ELDER EVILS

Elder evils lurk on the fringes of existence. They have always

been and always will be. Although they can be as powerful as

demigodssometimes more sothey are not deities. They

arent interested in mortals except to wipe them out. Gods

create and attend their creations; elder evils unravel them.

The mere presence of an elder evil threatens reality. Such

power is dif cult to conceal. If the PCs havent heard even

a whisper of the entity to date, why and how has it masked

its presence? Uncovering this mystery can be as thrilling a

challenge as the  nal confrontation itself.

The secrecy of an elder evil depends on your needs as the

Dungeon Master. If youre starting a new campaign and plan

to end it in a confrontation with a world-threatening entity,

plant the seeds early and drop hints over time. If youve

decided recently to bring things to a head, theres nothing

wrong with suddenly revealing the elder evil.

When  introducing  these  terrifying  entities  into  an

established campaign, use what you already have. Recurring

villains or their minions work well when the PCs already

have an inkling of the nemesis. For example, when the

nefarious high priest of Nerull reveals that she is in fact

an accomplice of the Worm that Walks (see Chapter 9), the

revelation is as logical as it is horrifying. On the other hand,

a major campaign villain might turn out to be the elder evil

itself. Faceless, recurring villains hide their identities behind

several masks; as the campaign develops, the PCs expose (or

believe they expose) their true enemy again and again until

youre ready to reveal the ultimate truth.

You can adapt any of the example elder evils in this book

so that they  t better into your settings history. In a planar

campaign, for example, an entity might not just threaten a

single Material Plane world, but also be working to destroy

all reality. Atropus, the World Born Dead (see Chapter 2),

could languish in stasis on the Negative Energy Plane. Once

released, it might seek to transform all the Outer Planes into

a mass graveyard.

READING THE ENTRIES

Each of the following chapters describes an elder evil, its

motivations and servants, and signs of its approach, as well

as providing a sample story arc to help you introduce the

threat into your campaign. A given entry uses the follow-

ing format.

Background

This section opens with a paragraph of common knowledge

and continues with several paragraphs of specialized knowl-

edge. Learning one of these pieces of information about an

elder evil requires a Knowledge check of the appropriate

kind. The specific skill and the check DC appears paren-

thetically at the end of each relevant paragraph in the elder

evils background.

Goals

This section follows the same format as the Background

entry, but the lore entries reveal ever more secret details of

the elder evils ultimate purpose.

The Elder Evil in the Campaign

This section sets out a sample story arc with increasingly

difficult challenges, culminating in the final confronta-

tion with the elder evil. The Encounter Levels of these

challenges correspond with strengthening signs of the

apocalypse, as detailed later in this chapter. Each chapter

includes a sidebar that describes the game effects of that

elder evils sign.

Two subsections suggest ways to adapt the elder evil to the

FORGOTTEN REALMS and EBERRON campaign settings.

Description

Here follow physical details of the elder evil, including its

statistics  block.  Important  servants  and  minions  are  also

presented in this section, along with their statistics.

ELDER EVIL TRAITS

The elder evils presented in this book have many of the traits

of abominations, as presented in Epic Level Handbook. Unlike

abominations, however, elder evils are not the offspring of dei-

ties. They are virtually immortalalthough they can be weak-

ened or returned to eons-long slumber.

Elder evils speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and often an

elemental language associated with their imprisonment. They

have maximum hit points per Hit Die. In addition, they have the

following characteristics.

mind-affecting spells and abilities. Most elder evils have im-

munity to a specific energy type, depending on their nature.

Resistances (Ex): Elder evils have resistance to cold 20 and

fire 20. They have high damage reduction, sometimes overcome

only by epic weapons, and very high spell resistance.

Summon Creature (Sp): Many elder evils are able to summon

associated creatures appropriate to their origins or specific

background. See the specific entries for additional details.

Special Qualities: All elder evils can use true seeing as the

spell at will (as a supernatural ability). They resist detection as

if under the effect of a nondetection spell. They have blindsight

out to 500 feet. They can communicate telepathically with any

creature within 1,000 feet that has a language.

Feats: Elder evils can select epic feats.

Immunities (Ex): Elder evils have immunity to polymorph-

ing, petrification, and any other spell or ability that alters their

form. They are not subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability

damage, or death from massive damage. They are immune to

Encounter Information

Each entry has an overview map of the area in which the

final confrontation occurs. Specific encounter areas are

described in narrative, some with suggested Encounter

Levels, and a few are tied to tactical encounters at the end

of the chapter.

Each tactical encounter includes a map of the room or area

in which it takes place. The information includes creature

statistics and tactics, initial positions of combatants, the loca-

tions of traps or other hazards, and other details important to

the encounter. Because of space constraints, statistics for the

elder evils and their major minions usually dont appear in

these encounters; you should prepare by copying the relevant

information or marking the appropriate page earlier in the

chapter  for quick reference.

IDENTIFYING SIGNS

To ordinary mortals, the appearance of a sign is a mysteri-

ous phenomenonforeboding and sinister, to be sure, but

without obvious signi cance. Only individuals who have the

proper training and experience, who are steeped in ancient

or forbidden knowledge, have any chance to recognize its

grim implications.

To identify a sign for what it is, a character must succeed

on a Knowledge check. The appropriate Knowledge skill is

noted in the Background and Goals sections of the elder evils

entry; choose an appropriate skill for a threat of your own

design. The check DC depends on the signs intensity, as set

out in the following table. As the effect of the sign becomes

more pervasive, its meaning grows ever more clear. A faint

sign might be simply unsettling, but at its height, its in uence

is inescapable.

Faint

Moderate

Strong

Overwhelming

DC

45

By  succeeding  on  this  check,  a  charac-

ter knows the sign is an evil omen. If

the  check  succeeds  by  5  or  more,

the character can identify the

signs strength, and succeed-

ing by 10 or more reveals all

the rami cations of its effect

(including the identity of the

elder evil).

SIGNS OF APOCALYPSE

An elder evil, or its mortal minions, might be active through

the life of the campaign, but only when the horror awakens,

arrives, or sets its plans in motion does the world know of

it. This awakening manifests as a sign: the physical, magi-

cal, or psychological imprint of the elder evil. A

sign re ects an aspect of the beings pur-

pose and nature, and it in uences

the  entire  campaign  setting.

Sometimes it appears not by

the will of the entity itself

(which  would  rather  not

tip its hand), but as a warn-

ing from the gods, who are

often  constrained  from

direct involvement.

INTRODUCING

SIGNS

After  a  sign  appears  and

gains  strength,  its  effect

can be nearly as devastating

as the elder evil itself; even if

the threat is dealt with, this

lingering  in uence  leaves

the  world  a  much  differ-

ent place. Since signs have

such  widespread  effects,

handling them within the

context of the game can be

daunting. The sample story

arcs  in  the  following  chap-

ters suggest ways to heighten

a  given  sign  gradually  over

time. When it  nally becomes

overwhelmingheralding

the  imminent  arrival  of  the

threatthe PCs average level

should be high enough to resist

all but the worst effects.

When adjudicating a signs in uence, describe in  avorful

narrative how it alters the world around the PCs. (Refer to the

quotations that introduce each sign for inspiration to guide

your story.)

SIGNS

REVEALED

The  following  signs  are  ex-

amples  of  those  that  could

accompany  an  elder  evils

approach; you might prefer to

design your own, taking in-

spiration from these entries.

Each  section  describes  the

effect of the sign at the four

intensities listed above.

Some entries suggest ways

of  varying  the  signs  in u-

ence to better suit the needs

of the campaign.

Blood Moon

And the moon shone crimson,

drenching the lands with the

color of blood. In its ill-omened

light,  people  went  mad  with

rage and turned on each other

in hate.

The sign is as horrid as the evil itself

The pale disk of silver hanging in the night sky transforms,

assuming a ghastly hue. At  rst, it darkens to an orange tone

like that of a harvest moon, but as the sign approaches its

peak, it turns the color of blood.

Effect: The sign of the blood moon sets tempers on edge,

making living creatures irritable and aggressive. Ultimately,

they are consumed by involuntary rage.

Details: The Hulks of Zoretha (Chapter 4) are associated

with this sign. See page 50 for more information.

Dead Sun

The sun did not rise. Hours turned into days, days into weeks, and

still the blanket of darkness shrouded all. A cruel, dark winter was

upon us, freezing the warmth of our blood.

When this sign appears, the light dies. The days grow shorter,

and temperatures drop until  nally the sun vanishes from

the sky, plunging the world into perpetual night.

Effect: Natural and magical lighting diminish as the sign

strengthens, until the sun no longer rises.

Details: Father Llymic (Chapter 3) is associated with this

sign. See page 33 for more information.

Variant: Instead of the sun disappearing completely,

planetary rotation slows so that, ultimately, one side of

the world is bathed in perpetual light while the other is

plunged into eternal darkness. The effects of the sign on

the dark side function as described above. On the light side,

the effects are reversed: The range of natural light sources

doubles; sunrise occurs earlier and sunset later; darkness

spells are impeded and light spells enhanced as described

above. Finally, global average temperatures climb rather

than drop. The glaring light and heat are as great a disaster

as endless dark, ultimately rendering the light side a life-

less ruin.

Eerie Weather

Frogs fell from the sky for hours. The next day, flaming stones

showered us, killing all they touched. Then it snowed for three

weeks. Who knows whats next?

This sign alters the weather in drastic and unnatural ways.

Snow in the summer and sweltering heat in the winter are

just the beginning. Hurricanes lash the coastlines, destroy

villages, or  ood entire cities; tornadoes rip apart the country-

side; and bizarre weather effects become commonplace. All

the while, sickening green clouds form, and violet lightning

dances between them.

Effect: When this sign manifests, it creates strange and

random meteorological effects. The intensity of the sign

determines  the  extent,  duration,  and  frequency  of  the

unusual weather.

Details: The Leviathan (Chapter 5) and Zargon (Chapter

10) are associated with this sign. See pages 65 and 145 for

more information.

Infestation

Do you hear that? That terrible sound! The scratching, the endless

scratching in the walland the rats! Theyre everywhere, choking

us, drowning us!

The world shudders beneath a  ood of loathsome creatures

birthed from the depths of the seas or the dankest pits of the

Underdark. Armies of hideous monsters march to the pulse

of the lurid sign. The infestation sweeps across the lands,

devouring everything in its path.

Effect: The type of infestation depends on the nature of

the elder evil. Aberrations, animals, plants, oozes, undead,

and vermin are typical choices, though some magical beasts,

outsiders, and even humanoids could work too. As the sign

grows in strength, so too do the numbers, increasing the

challenge of the encounter. The creatures spread throughout

the  campaign  setting  as  the  sign  grows  stronger,  and

encounters range from single fights to desperate stands

against vast armies.

Details: Sertrous (Chapter 8) and the Worm that Walks

(Chapter 9) are associated with this sign. See pages 114 and

129 for more information.

Variant: Infestations need not be combat encounters.

Swarms serve well in this role: Clouds of locusts devour

crops, numberless rats spread disease, and creeping spiders

drape entire cities in webbing.

Restless Dead

Too long have we reveled in our wickedness, too long have we

sampled the forbiddennow the gods shun us, sealing the gates to

heaven and leaving us lost among the dead.

When this sign appears, the demarcation between life and

death grows ever more blurry. After souls depart, their bodies

stir in a wretched existence neither alive nor dead.

The sign of the restless dead  rst makes itself known by

isolated occurrences of zombies and skeletons in the commu-

nity. As it strengthens, the undead plague increases. Corpses

pull themselves free from graves, slaughtering former friends

and lovers and swelling their ranks until only the shuf ing

dead remain.

Effect: In the early stages of this sign, only a few of the dead

spontaneously animate. Necromancy magic becomes more

ef cacious, while healing magic is suppressed. As the sign

intensi es, more and more corpses rise, growing stronger

all the while.

Details: Atropus (Chapter 2) is associated with this sign.

See page 17 for more information.

Seal of Binding

Unnatural things walk the streets, horrors spewed up from the pits

of hell. How did they get here? Will they ever depart?

A  ery glyph appears in the sky, casting dim light. Aside from

its sudden and unusual appearance, the symbol seems to be

harmless, but those who communicate with planar beings

or use magical methods of travel feel its effect at once. As the

sign intensi es, the glyph grows more complex, spreading

like a weird stain across the heavens.

Effect: The seal of binding interferes with most conjura-

tion spells and many divination spells by closing off the

avenues that enable mortals to interact with the planes.

Clerics connections with the divine are severed, summoned

creatures do not return to their home planes, and dimensional

travel ceases to function.

Details: Pandorym (Chapter 6) is associated with this sign.

See page 81 for more information.

Twisted Life

harmful  effects  on  infernal  forces.  When  we  should  have  taken

action, we instead wasted time on pointless wrangling. Only now

can we see the hideous truth.

This sign first manifests with accelerated healing. Soon,

though, living creatures and inanimate objects become

covered with festering boils, which burst to expel swarms

of pests. As the sign strengthens, wounds close almost

instantly,  but  flesh  grows  pustulent  and  bones  distend

as  life  becomes  corrupted.  At  its  peak,  all  undead  but

the most powerful and hidden are obliterated. The dead

rise as gibbering aberrations, and the living mutate into

twisted progeny.

Effect: This sign manifests as a surge of corrupt positive

energy that resculpts life on an entire world.

Details: Ragnorra (Chapter 7) is associated with this sign.

See page 97 for more information.

ADDITIONAL SIGNS

When creating your own elder evil, use the following signs

as inspiration. Alter the effects to  t the theme of your elder

evil when necessary.

Alien Skies

I peered into the heavens, searching for familiar sights, but found

nothing I knew. All was strange and disquieting, as though we

were adrift in alien seas.

After  the  sun  sets,  the  stars  twinkle  in  the  heavens  as

alwaysbut they are strange. They glow luridly with weird

colors, spreading fear and wonder in all who behold them.

Familiar constellations vanish, re-form, or shift to new

locations. As the sign reaches its peak, distorting the arcane

energies of the world, unsettling auroras and intense meteor

showers illuminate the night skies.

Effect: This sign interferes with arcane magic, making

spells harder to cast successfully. When a spell is cast, the

sign warps its effects, often with disastrous results.

Faint: The DCs of all Concentration checks related to cast-

ing arcane spells increase by 5.

Moderate: Arcane spells are cast at 2 caster level. A char-

acter whose effective caster level drops to 0 or lower cannot

cast arcane spells at all.

Strong: Arcane spells and spell-like abilities are impeded,

meaning that a caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check

(DC 20 + the level of the spell) or lose the spell or spell slot

without effect.

Overwhelming: In addition to impeding arcane magic,

the sign distorts its effects. A caster who succeeds on the

Spellcraft check to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must

then make a second Spellcraft check with the same DC. On a

success, the spell takes effect normally; otherwise, something

unusual occurs, as if casting in an area of wild magic (see

DMG 149 and the associated table).

Variants: If your campaign includes psionics or variant

forms of magic (such as soulmelds or truenaming from the

Tome of Magic supplement), this sign might interfere with

them instead. Use the effects described above or tailor them

to suit the type of magic involved. Alternatively, you might

have this sign disrupt the deities connection to the world,

twisting divine magic instead of arcane.

Appalling Fecundity

The peasants believed they had been blessed: Their crops grew

quickly, women bore healthy children in weeks rather than months,

and the harvest was the best ever. At first, life was good. But the

growth never slowed. Everything birthed and died with such

speed that we could hear Nature suffering. Disease was rampant,

and vermin spread it everywhere; there was no end to the screams

of the af icted.

Growth and healing are accelerated. At  rst crops and animals

grow and reproduce with unnatural swiftness, and injuries

vanish overnight. As the sign intensi es, these early bene ts

run out of control. Fruit bursts and rots on the vine before it

can be harvested. Weeds crack pavement and damage build-

ings. Clouds of vermin boil up from the earth, laying eggs

that hatch and spawn new life in moments, and with them

come equally virulent disease.

Effects: This sign forces living things to grow, ripen, and

die at an alarming rate.

Faint: Ordinary plants are enhanced as if by the plant growth

spell (PH 262; CL 20th). Crops bene t from the enrichment

effect, while other vegetation suffers from overgrowth and

chokes open spaces.

Moderate: All areas of natural growth are affected as if

by the entangle spell (PH 227; CL 20th). Each week, living

creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Fortitude save or acquire

the pseudonatural template (Complete Arcane 160).

Strong: Living creatures that require sleep lose the ability

to do so, as their bodies  dget and their thoughts race. Physi-

cal exhaustion sets in, and eventually minds break. A living

creature can go without sleep for a number of days equal

to its Constitution modifier (minimum one). Thereafter

it is fatigued, remaining in this state for a number of days

equal to its Constitution modi er (again, minimum one); if

it would become fatigued during that time, it is exhausted

instead. Each day after that period, the creature takes 1 point

of Wisdom damage. If the total Wisdom damage exceeds its

Hit Dice, the creature is affected as if by an insanity spell.

Once its Wisdom score drops to 0, the creature becomes

unconscious but cannot recover lost Wisdom naturally.

Only a sleep or deep slumber spell or equivalent effect can

grant rest for a time, after which the effects of the sign

begin anew.

Overwhelming: Flesh grows and heals with terrible speed.

Each hour, all living creatures gain 1d6 temporary hit points.

For each hour that a creatures temporary hit point total

exceeds  its  full  normal  total,  it  must  succeed  on  a  DC  20

Fortitude save or explode in a shower of gore.

Dry Winds

From the north came a hot wind, scouring the clouds from the

skies. It leached the water from our rivers and lakes, and the mighty

oceans receded with each gust.

Unnaturally warm winds blow from an atypical direction,

growing hotter as the sign intensi es and carrying away

all moisture.

Effects: The dry winds destroy water as they whip across

the land. Eventually the winds grow so hot they ignite

whatever they touch, transforming the world into a  aming

ball of death.

Faint: Natural precipitation stops. Average global tempera-

tures increase by 1d3 degrees, and all bodies and streams of

water lose 1d4 feet of depth each week.

Moderate: Average global temperatures increase by 1d6

degrees, and all bodies and streams of water lose 1d10 feet

of depth each week.

Strong: Average global temperatures increase by 2d10

degrees, and all bodies and streams of water lose 1d20 feet

of depth each week. The dry wind begins to strengthen,

increasing by one degree of force; for example, calm air

becomes a light wind, while a strong wind becomes severe.

See DMG 95 for more about wind effects.

Overwhelming:  Average  global  temperatures  increase

by  4d10  degrees,  and  all  bodies  and  streams  of  water  lose

1d100  feet  of  depth  each  week.  The  wind  strengthens  by

two degrees; for example, a light wind becomes strong. The

searing winds now literally burn: A strong wind deals 1d4

points of  re damage per hour, a severe wind deals 1d6 points,

and each degree of wind force higher than severe deals an

additional 2d6 points.

Variant: The inverse of the dry winds sign is dreadful

flooding. Clouds pile up overhead, darkening the sky, and

they unleash torrents that drench the world. As the sign

intensifies, water levels rise by the listed amount rather

than fall. Global temperatures cool somewhat: When the

sign grows strong, they drop 1d3 degrees, and when it is

overwhelming, a further 1d6 degrees. The winds increase as

described above but do not deal  re damage.

Horrid Blight

Before my very eyes, the waters darkened to the color of coagulated

blood. One by one, white shapes bobbed to the surface:  sh slain by the

tainted sea. And the smellthe air reeked of a slaughterhouse.

Strong: The save DC to resist any disease increases by 10.

At the start of each day, all living creatures must succeed

on a DC 20 Fortitude save or become nauseated for the

remainder of the day. On a successful save, the creature

is sickened instead. Creatures that fail a second DC 15

Fortitude save take 1d3 points of Constitution damage that

day; the save DC for creatures with the animal or plant type

is 20.

Overwhelming: The save DC to resist any disease increases

by 20. At the start of each day, all living creatures must

succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of

Constitution damage.

SERVING ELDER EVILS

That the Beast shall awaken is inevitable. Im working to ensure

I am the  rst to die when it does.

William von Dreichart, mad cultist

Elder evils do not attract many mortal servants, for their

nature is opposed to all living things. A few wretches who

despise everything, whether they be nihilists or lunatics, do

bow to an elder evil. Annihilation is the only reward for such

service. But for those driven by insanity, an unquenchable

thirst for vengeance, or myriad other strange and sinister

motivations, the utter finality of death is sweet. Aiding

an elder evil is the surest means of embracing that much-

desired end.

Any intelligent and evil creature can swear service to an

elder evil if the creature knows of its existence. Doing so

grants the creature one bonus feat, plus an extra bonus feat

for every  ve character levels or Hit Dice. These bonus feats

must be selected from among the vile feats given in the

accompanying table. Elder evils do not grant spells.

VILE FEATS

This sign slowly kills the world. Creatures become barren, no

longer producing offspring. Animals sicken and die. Plants

wither  or  rot,  while  disease  runs  rampant,  corrupting  all

with its horrid touch.

Effects: The sign of horrid blight brings unnatural sick-

ness and strengthens existing diseases. As the sign intensi es,

plagues ravage every living thing.

Faint: The save DC to resist any disease increases by 5.

Moderate:  Ordinary  plants  begin  to  wither.  At  the  start

of each day, all living creatures must succeed on a DC 15

Fortitude save or become sickened for the remainder of the

day. Creatures of the animal or plant type that fail a second

Some  vile  feats,  as  well  as  malefic  properties  (see  page

DC 15 Fortitude save take 1d3 points of Constitution damage

14), deal vile damage. Vile damage represents a horrific

that day.

desecration of body or soul. It reduces hit points or ability

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

First introduced in Book of Vile Darkness, vile feats are available

to intelligent creatures of evil alignment.

The Heroes of Horror supplement introduced a subset of vile

feats known as deformity feats. A deformity feat represents

an intentional act that changes a character in some horri c

way. The prerequisite for every other deformity feat is a vile

feat called Willing Deformity.

Vile Damage

LIVING ROT

When the sign of horrid blight manifests, new diseases appear

and  spread  like  wildfire  across  the  land.  The  living  rot  is  an

example of a new plague. See DMG 292 for complete details of

disease transmission.

This disease causes victims skin to erupt with pus-filled blis-

ters that eventually burst, leaving behind bloody craters. Flesh

rots and sloughs from the bones, and internal organs protrude

from the wounds. Those afflicted are surrounded by the intoler-

able reek of their own bodys decay.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Damage: 1d4 Str, 1d4 Con*, 1d4 Wis, and 1d4 Cha*.

When damaged, the infected creature must succeed on

another  saving  throw  or  the  damage  is  permanent  drain

instead.

Base Fortitude DC: 15 (this number increases by a varying

amount, depending on the signs intensity).

Infection: Ingested, inhaled, injury, and contact.

Incubation: 1 day.

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS

Each of the following feats is possessed by at least one of the

elder evils described later in this book.

Abyss-Bound Soul [Vile]

You  have  pledged  your  immortal  soul  to  a  particular

demon lord in return for a gift that aids your evil works

in life.

Prerequisite: Evil Brand, Thrall to Demon.

Bene  t: Your evil brand incorporates the personal symbol

of your demon lord patron, who watches over you from the

Abyss. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made against

spells that have the good descriptor. Additionally, a tiny

portion of your patrons power infuses your body, granting

you an additional bene t. The exact bene t gained depends

on who your patron is, as given below.

Abominable Form [Vile, Deformity]

You revel in the ruination of your  esh, drawing power from

your disturbing deformities.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Bene  t: Living creatures with fewer Hit Dice than you

that can see your undisguised form are af icted by disgust.

Each such creature must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + 2

for each deformity feat you possess) or become shaken for a

number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier

(minimum 1 round).

Special: Your ghastly appearance grants you a +2 circum-

stance bonus on Intimidate checks.

Apostate [Vile]

Your hatred of the gods cloaks you with potent resistance

against their works.

Prerequisite: Wis 15.

Bene  t: You gain a profane bonus equal to one-half your

character level on saving throws against divine spells. You

cannot voluntarily fail a saving throw against a divine spell,

even if the spell is harmless.

Special: If you are a divine spellcaster with a code of

conduct (such as a paladin), selecting this feat violates your

code of conduct regardless of your alignment.

Chosen of Evil [Vile]

Your naked devotion to wickedness causes dark powers to

take an interest in your well-being.

Prerequisites: Con 13, any other vile feat.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can take 1 point

of Constitution damage to gain an insight bonus equal

to the number of vile feats you have, including this one.

Until the end of your next turn, you can apply this bonus

on  one  attack  roll,  saving  throw,  ability  check,  or  skill

check. Make this decision before determining the result

of the roll.

Dark Speech [Vile]

You learn a smattering of the language of truly dark power.

Prerequisites: Will save bonus +5, Int 15, Cha 15.

Bene  t: You can use the Dark Speech to bring loathing

and fear to others, to help cast evil spells and create evil magic

items, and to weaken physical objects.

Dread:  Whenever  you  use  Dark  Speech  in  this  manner,

you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and every other

creature in a 30-foot radius must attempt a Will save (DC 10

+ 1/2 your character level + your Cha modi er). The result of

a failed save by a listener depends on the listeners character

level and alignment, as detailed in the table below.

Level (Alignment)  Result

1st4th (non-evil)  Listener is shaken for 10 rounds and

must flee from you until you are

out of sight.

Listener cowers in fear for 10 rounds.

1st4th (evil)

5th10th (non-evil)  Listener is shaken for 10 rounds.

5th10th (evil)

Listener is charmed by you (as charm

monster) for 10 rounds.

Listener is filled with loathing for you

but is not otherwise influenced.

Listener is impressed, and you gain a

+2 competence bonus on attempts to

change its attitude in the future.

11th+ (non-evil)

11th+ (evil)

increase its effective caster level by 1. By using it during the

creation of an evil magic item, you increase its caster level

by 1 without increasing the cost.

Corruption: As a full-round action, you can whisper vile

words at an inanimate object and reduce its hardness by half.

This use does not drain you, but you cannot use the ability

more than once on a single object.

Dark Unity: You can use the Dark Speech to establish

a  hive  mind  in  any  swarm  of  vermin  or  animals  with

an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. Thereafter, you can

give the swarm one command as per the suggestion spell

(caster level equals your Hit Dice). Whenever you infuse

a swarm in this manner, you take 1d4 points of Constitu-

tion damage.

Normal: Attempting to utter a word of Dark Speech always

ends in immediate death for a speaker who is not trained in

its dark power. It is impossible for an unwilling creature to

use the Dark Speech, because the languages pronunciation

is so exacting.

Special: You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saving

throws made when someone uses the Dark Speech against

you.

Special: If you cannot take ability damage, you cannot

select this feat.

Dark Whispers [Vile]

By whispering foul utterances in the Dark Speech, you can

drive your enemies insane.

Prerequisite: Dark Speech.

Bene  t: In addition to the basic uses of the Dark Speech,

you can whisper words of incredible wickedness to form

grotesque visions in the minds of those who hear you. All

living creatures within a 30-foot radius that can hear your

words  must  make  Will  saves  (DC  10  +  1/2  your  character

level + your Cha modi er). On a failure, creatures with fewer

Hit Dice than you are staggered for 1d10 rounds; those with

as many or more Hit Dice are confused for 1 round. This is a

mind-affecting, supernatural effect.

Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner, you take

1 point of Charisma damage.

Special: You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on saving

throws made when someone uses the Dark Speech against

you. This bonus stacks with the +4 circumstance bonus from

Dark Speech.

Special: If you cannot take ability damage, you cannot

select this feat.

Deformity (Eyes) [Vile, Deformity]

You have either drilled a hole in your forehead trying to add

a third eye, or you have supernaturally scarred one of your

regular eyes.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Bene t: As a supernatural ability, you can use see invis-

ibility for 1 minute per day.

Special: You take a 2 penalty on Spot and Search checks.

Deformity (Face) [Vile, Deformity]

Power:  Whenever  you  use  Dark  Speech  in  this  manner,

you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. By incorporating

the Dark Speech into the verbal component of a spell, you

Because of intentional self-mutilation, you have a hideous

face.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

9/27/07   2:05:58 PM

9/27/07   2:05:58 PM

Bene t: You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate

checks and a +2 deformity bonus on Diplomacy checks deal-

ing with evil creatures of a different type.

Deformity (Gaunt) [Vile, Deformity]

Through intentional starvation and macabre operations,

you are grossly underweight. You have a skeletal appear-

ance, and your weight is now half normal for creatures of

your kind.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Bene t: You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a 2 penalty

to Constitution. Furthermore, you gain a +2 circumstance

bonus on Escape Artist checks and Intimidate checks.

Deformity (Madness) [Vile, Deformity]

You revel in madness, embracing your hallucinations, erratic

behavior, and deviant cravings. Your mind cannot be touched

by outside in uences.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Bene  t: You take a permanent 4 profane penalty to your

Wisdom score to become immune to all mind-affecting spells

and abilities.

As an immediate action, you can derive clarity from your

madness to add a bonus equal to one-half your character level

to a single Will save. Make this decision before determining

the results of the saving throw. You must wait 1 minute before

you can take this action again.

Deformity (Parasite) [Vile, Deformity]

You invite parasites into your body in exchange for a greater

hardiness against diseases and poisons.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can negate any

disease or poison affecting you. On your next turn, you can

take only a move action or a standard action as the agitated

parasites wriggle in your  esh.

Enemy of Good [Vile]

You draw power from your unholy devotion.

Prerequisites: Chosen of Evil, Evil Brand.

Benefit: Whenever you cast a spell or use a spell-like

ability against a creature of the good subtype or a creature

that radiates an aura of good, the save DC, if any, increases

by 2.

Evils Blessing [Vile]

Entities  of  utter  evil  and  villainy  have  a  stake  in  your

survival.

Prerequisite: Cha 13.

Bene  t: As a standard action, you gain a profane bonus on

saving throws equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum +1).

This bonus lasts for 5 rounds. During any round in which

you deal at least 1 point of damage to a creature of the good

subtype or a creature that radiates an aura of good, this bonus

is doubled.

Filthy Outburst [Vile]

You shriek a phrase in the Dark Speech to deafen or torment

those around you.

Prerequisites: Base Will save +7, Dark Speech.

Bene  t: As a swift action, you loose a blistering torrent

of foul curses and wicked insults in the Dark Speech. All

living creatures within 60 feet that can hear you must suc-

ceed on Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your

Cha modi er) or become deafened for a number of rounds

equal to your character level. As long as an affected creature

is deafened, it takes a 4 profane penalty on saving throws

to resist evil spells or spell-like abilities.

Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner, you take

1d6 points of Charisma damage.

Special: If you cannot take ability damage, you cannot

select this feat.

Harvester of Souls [Vile]

When you deliver a killing blow, you destroy both the  esh

and the soul.

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +11.

Bene  t: Whenever you use the coup de grace action to

kill a creature, that creature cannot be restored to life by any

means short of a miracle or wish spell until you are slain.

You gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the slain

creature. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.

Insane Defiance [Vile]

You adopt insanity as a shield to turn effects that target your

mind against those around you.

Prerequisite: Base Will save +5.

Bene  t: As an immediate action, whenever you are the

target of a mind-affecting spell or spell-like ability, you can

take 1 point of Wisdom damage to retarget the effect to

another  creature  of  your  choice  within  the  effects  range.

The new target takes a 4 circumstance penalty on its saving

throw, if any, against that effect.

Special: If you cannot take ability damage, you cannot

select this feat.

Lichloved [Vile]

By repeatedly consorting with the undead, you gain dread

powers.

Prerequisite: Evil Brand.

Bene t: Mindless undead see you as an undead creature.

Becoming more and more like an actual undead creature,

you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against

mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis,

stunning, and disease.

Masters Will [Vile]

The  elder  evil  you  serve  is  fickle  in  its  rewards  and

punishments.

Prerequisites:  Chosen  of  Evil  or  undead  type,  Evil

Brand.

Bene  t: As an immediate action, you can beseech the

elder evil for assistance. Roll 1d20. If the result of the die

roll is an odd number, you gain a +8 bonus on one attack roll,

saving throw, ability check, or skill check for 1 round. If the

result is even, you take 1 point of damage for each Hit Die or

character level you possess.

You must make the decision to use this ability before

making an attack roll, save, or check.

Prerequisites:  Base  attack  bonus  +9,  favored  enemy

(any one).

Benefit: Choose one creature of a type or subtype you

have selected as a favored enemy. As a full-round action,

you  can  make  a  single  melee  attack  against  the  chosen

creature. If you deal at least 1 point of damage, that creature

must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level +

your Cha modifier). On a failure, it is overcome with dread

and can take only a move action or a standard action on

its next turn.

You automatically con rm any critical threats made against

a favored enemy.

Reflexive Psychosis [Vile, Deformity]

In the face of adversity, you withdraw into the haunted cor-

ridors of your mind.

Prerequisite: Deformity (Madness).

reduction 5/ for 1 round. After using this ability, you are

confused until the end of your next turn.

Slave to Evil [Vile]

You  have  pledged  your  soul  to  an  elder  evil.  You  gain

benefits that grow more powerful as your masters sign

intensifies.

Prerequisite: Chosen of Evil.

Bene  t: You gain an aura of evil as if you were an evil

outsider (see detect evil, PH 218). Whenever you are the target

Prerequisite: Natural attack that deals at least 1d8 points

of damage, base attack bonus +5.

Bene t:  Each  time  you  deal  damage  with  your  natural

attack, you deal an extra 1 point of vile damage.

MALEFIC PROPERTIES

Elder evils are capable of incredible destruction. They wield

devastating magic and possess an arsenal of potent attacks

to work their wickedness. But such power alone offers little

defense against the gods and their servants. Male c properties

are their safeguard against divine interference.

A male c property is a supernatural ability, intrinsic to the

very nature of an elder evil. An antimagic  eld can suppress its

effect within a small area, but doing so requires a successful

caster level check (1d20 + caster level) to overcome the elder

evils spell resistance. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic have

no effect against a male c property.

A male c property affects an enormous area and might

in uence an entire world, depending on the power of the

elder evil as measured by its Hit Dice.

nature. The sample elder evils provided in this book can

PROPERTY DESCRIPTIONS

Each of the following male c properties is possessed by at

least one of the elder evils described later in this book.

Anathematic Secrecy

This male c property shrouds an elder evil from discovery

by divination spells of a divine origin.

Bene  t: Any divine spell of the divination school auto-

matically fails when used to ascertain information about an

elder  evil.  Divination  spells  that  are  also  arcane  function

normally if they are cast by a nondivine spellcaster.

This ability is always active.

An affected creature is entitled to a new Will save each

round to break free from the rage. If it succeeds, its alignment

reverts to normal, but the creature might suffer other conse-

quences of the frenzy, such as violating a code of conduct.

Divine Enervation

An  elder  evil  that  has  this  property  can  destroy  the  link

between a deity and its mortal followers.

Bene  t:  All  divine  spellcasters  lose  the  ability  to

regain spells so long as they remain within the area of this

male c property. This interdiction does not interfere with

spellcasting.

This ability is always active.

Divine Scourge

Dark Visiting

An elder evil that has this property  projects

terrifying nightmares into the dreams

of the gods servants.

Bene  t: Each living  divine

spellcaster  who  sleeps

within  the  area  of  this

malefic   property  must

succeed on a Will save

(DC  10  +  1/2   elder

evils HD + elder evils

Cha  modi er)  or  be

plagued  with  mad-

dening dreams. Upon

awakening,  the   caster

takes  1d4+1  points  of

Wisdom  damage  and

is  fatigued  for  the

remainder  of  the  day.

In  addition,  the  caster

does not bene t from

the  rest  required  to

regain spells or spell

slots,  psionic  power

points, and the like.

An  affected  spell-

caster whose Wisdom is

reduced to half normal

or lower by this effect is

affected as if by an insanity

spell (PH 244) while within the

area of this male c property.

This ability is always active.

An  elder  evil  that  has  this

property can punish deities

servants  with  a  powerful

surge of profane energy.

Bene  t: Once per day,as

a swift action, the elder evil

can unleash a  deadly pulse

throughout  the  area  of  this

malefic   property.  All  divine

spellcasters and  extraplanar

creatures  within  the

area   become   sickened

for  1d4  hours.  In

addition,  each   affected

creature  must  succeed

on a  Fortitude save (DC

10 + 1/2  elder evils Hit

Dice  +  elder  evils  Con  or

Cha  modi er,  whichever

is higher) or take 1 point of

vile damage per Hit Die of

the elder evil.

Impervious

to the Divine

An  elder  evil  that  has  this

property  cannot  be  affected

by  divine  magic  of  any  kind,

regardless of the source.

Bene  t: The elder evil is immune

to all divine spells, whether from a spell-

caster or a magic item. It is also immune

to spell-like and supernatural abilities of

extraplanar creatures and deities.

This ability is always active.

Ancient evil infests the world

and daunts the holy

The presence of an elder evil that has this

property incites violence and suffering.

Bene  t: Each round as a standard action, an elder evil

can force a single living creature it can see that is within the

area of this male c property to make a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 elder evils HD + elder evils Cha modi er). On a failure,

the creatures alignment changes to match that of the elder

evil, and the target immediately enters a killing rage. This

frenzy functions as a barbarians rage ability, except that

the affected creature must attack the closest creature each

round it remains enraged. The raging creature takes 1 point

of vile damage each round until it is killed or it manages to

end the effect.

True Death

The presence of an elder evil that has this property weakens

the souls of living creatures so that they are lost on death.

Bene  t: Any creature that dies within the area of this

male c property is forever dead. Its soul has not passed to

the Outer Planes but has died with the body; the creature

cannot be raised by any means. In addition, all spells and

spell-like effects that have the death descriptor are cast at +4

caster level.

This ability is always active.

ehold the death of your world. There, cresting the

horizon. Yes, that faint body is he, and he comes

for me . . . for us all. Rejoice, for the end is near,

and all life, all pain, all suffering shall be silenced

in the perfect eternity of undeath.

Caira Xasten,

mad astronomer and ur-priest

Atropus, the World Born Dead, drifts through the

gulfs of space, searching for worlds to consume and,

when it  nds them, erasing all life with its gruesome

touch. As the afterbirth of creation, it is committed

to unmaking all things. Nothing, not even the gods,

can halt its relentless progress.

BACKGROUND

Every sentient mortal race and culture has some

explanation for its existence, some story or myth

to describe the creation of the world and the birth

of the ancestors. Since it is a rare case when two

myths are identical, scholars of the subject sift

through the rhetoric for commonalities believed

to be present in all legends. Complications arise

due to regional variations, translation errors, and

the simple scarcity of reliable sources, all making

the  process  of  divining  the  roots  of  creation  a

daunting task.

Certain scholars have made breakthroughs by comparing

dwarf creation myths, the oral tradition of the gray elves,

and the collected writings of the lich Acererak, recovered

from a strange tower deep in the Plane of Shadow. The

 ndings have been disturbing, pointing to some primeval

mishapa horrible divine accident leading to the creation

of something called the World Born Dead. (Knowledge

[religion] DC 33)

According to the writings, creation was the result of a

prime mover. This beings identity varies with the particu-

lar story. Most scholars agree this entity must be the force

behind the gods springing forth into existence from the

primeval void. This force, idea, or being is called Atropus.

(DC 38)

Some theologians believe the appearance of these divine

agencies came with a dreadful price. In order for them to

take shape, there must have been a sacri ce: For life to exist,

there must be death. Atropus must have caused its own death

and  in  that  sense  became  the  afterbirth  of  creation,  the

wasted materials left over from the formation of the gods.

Furthermore, since the gods are living beings, and since life

relies upon energy gained from the Positive Energy Plane,

Atropus must be their inversion: death incarnate, drawing

its own power, such as it is, from the Negative Energy Plane.

(DC 43)

Little remains of the prime mover that made the supreme

sacri ce, nothing more than a decaying, disembodied head,

leaving in its wake cast-off necromantic detritus that  oats

through the void. Perhaps atropalsthe stillborn gods (ELH

159)take their shape from these cast-off bits. Atropus is bound

to unmake living things, to absorb their souls in an orgy of

violence. Its touch is terrifying to witness, as countless barren

worlds crawling with restless dead mutely testify. (DC 48)

GOALS

Atropus saps life from worlds it encounters, draining away

energy as it draws ever closer to a planet. Once it comes near

enough to a planets gravity, the celestial body that is the elder

evil enters a descending orbit, sweeping closer and closer and

looming larger and larger in the night skies. The effects are

terrifying. As the moonlet nears a planets surface, the dead

rise from their graves and, as Atropus  lls the night sky, the

twitching undead spread like a stain until nothing living

remains. (Knowledge [religion] DC 33)

Atropus is self-aware, but not as mortals can conceive. Its

memory extends back to the one moment when it brought

forth the gods, and it has lamented this decision for all time.

Stripped of its incredible power, it would undo its sacri ce.

(DC 38)

To this end, Atropus devours life energy to replace what it gave.

Into this sucking vacuum, it draws positive energy from those

planets it encounters, but the negative energy constituting its

existence instantly negates any life energy it takes. (DC 43)

Atropus knows this. It suspects that the instant all life is

swept from the Material Plane, the gods must cease to be

and, with their annihilation, so too will it  nd its own end.

(DC 48)

ATROPUS IN

THE CAMPAIGN

Atropus dwells in the emptiness between worlds. As it drifts,

it casts out with its senses, sampling the emptiness for signs

of life. Once it detects a living thing, it moves toward the

source. Since it is such a distant threat, you can assume the

elder evil has been around for as long as your campaign set-

ting has existed, and has been traveling toward your world

for any number of years. Once Atropus takes an interest in

your world, place it in the heavens. It is indistinguishable

from the other celestial bodies at the start, and as it comes

closer it reveals its sinister character to coincide with the

intensifying sign.

TIMELINE

What follows is a possible campaign timeline coded with

Encounter Levels to help you construct adventures around

the key events that might transpire as Atropus approaches.

EL 5: Caira Xasten, driven mad with grief at the loss of her

husband, vows revenge on the gods. Having heard wild rumors

of the World Born Dead, she sends out her minions to steal a

manuscript held in a vault beneath a cathedral in one of the

largest cities in your setting (good choices include Sharn,

Waterdeep, and the Free City of Greyhawk). Her minions suc-

ceed and snatch the book, leaving scores of priests dead. The

church hires the PCs to  nd out who was behind the robbery

and recover the tome. The PCs manage to attain the book,

but not before Caira has a chance to learn its mysteries.

EL 10 (Faint Sign): The priests contact the PCs once more.

Having deciphered the old tome, the clerics suspect whoever

sought the book intends to summon the World Born Dead.

The manuscript offers few details, and the clerics have been

unable to elicit any concrete answers from their god. They do

uncover the name of another tome: The book of vile darkness.

They ask the characters to locate this book before their enemy

uncovers it. The PCs must research and follow up on leads to

 nd its resting place, all the while facing innumerable cultists

who seek the same end. To make matters worse, the PCs hear

reports from all over about how the dead have begun to rise

from their graves.

EL 15 (Moderate Sign): Sensing an opportunity to make a

decisive strike against his ancient enemy, Orcus dispatches his

legions, led by a bodak named Gorguth, to invade Demogor-

gons layer, the Gaping Maw. This strike plunges the Abyss

into widespread war, with demon lords and princes lining

up against one another to settle old scores. The Dark Eight of

the Nine Hells perceive this in ghting as a weakness and for

the  rst time mount a successful invasion into the In nite

Layers of the Abyss. During the interplanar wars, Gorguth

forswears his allegiance to Orcus and leads his undead armies

into the Material Plane through a gate created by cultists in

the service of Atropus.

Meanwhile, Caira recovers the book of vile darkness and learns

that  the  elder  evil  will  come  if  a  tragedy  of  terrible  and

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SIGN: RESTLESS DEAD

Atropuss presence in the sky causes the dead to rise from their

graves.

Faint: Necromancy spells and spell-like abilities are cast at

+2 caster level. Whenever a living creature dies, a 20% chance

exists that it will spontaneously rise as a zombie (MM 265) in

1d4 rounds.

Moderate: As faint, but the chance of spontaneous animation

increases  to  40%.  In  addition,  the  entire  campaign  setting  is

affected as if by a desecrate spell (PH 218). Casting consecrate re-

moves this effect in the spells area until its duration expires.

Strong: As moderate, but the chance of spontaneous anima-

tion increases to 80%. Even creatures that died before this sign

manifested begin to rise as skeletons or zombies, depending on

the condition of their corpses. In addition, the campaign setting

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

is affected as if by an unhallow spell (PH 297). Casting hallow

removes this effect in the spells area.

All conjuration (healing) spells and similar spell-like abilities

are impeded, meaning that a caster must succeed on a Spell-

craft check (DC 20 + the level of the spell) or lose the spell or

spell slot without effect.

Overwhelming:  As  strong,  but  any  creature  that  dies  au-

tomatically  rises  as  a  zombie  1  round  after  death.  Previously

dead creatures automatically animate as skeletons or zombies.

All undead creatures gain an extra 2 hit points per Hit Die. In

addition, they gain turn resistance equal to one-quarter of their

Hit Die total (17 HD grants +1 turn resistance, 815 HD grants

+2, 1623 HD grants +3, and so on). This bonus stacks with any

turn resistance a creature already possesses.

widespread death were to occur. She researches the apocalypse

from the sky spell (see the sidebar, page 21), during which time

she sends out her minions to collect a sample of angel tears she

intends to use to complete the casting of the spell. The PCs

might be drawn into the  ghting on the planes, join the battle

against Gorguth, or follow up their leads about Caira.

EL 17 (Strong Sign): The undead outnumber the living,

spreading  like  a  cancer.  Gorguths  armies  beat  back  the

defenders,  lling their depleted ranks by turning their fallen

adversaries into undead. Gorguth marches toward the metropo-

lis where he intends to greet the elder evil when it arrives.

Meanwhile, Caira completes her research and begins the day-

long casting from her hidden base beneath the city. From one of

her captured minions or another ally they met along the way,

the PCs learn of her horrible plan and must decide whether they

will  stand  against

the fast-approaching

undead army or seek

out  the  ur-priest  in

the hope of halting

her fell magic.

EL  20

(Over-

whelming  Sign):

If the PCs stop Cai-

ra, it is a short-lived

victory, for Gorguth

approaches,  and  his

hordes  of  demons

and undead spill into

the  city,  spreading

death  and  destruc-

tion

throughout.

Alternatively,  if  the

characters faced Gor-

guth  and  defeated

him, Caira completes

the spell and bathes

everything in a 130-

mile radius with  ery

death, killing tens of

thousands.  This  ca-

lamity  is  enough  to

awaken Atropus, and

the  moonlet  begins

to  descend  toward

the planet. Surviving

spellcasters cast gate

spells  to  transport

people to the Plane of Shadow, trying to save as many as they

can, leaving the PCs as the worlds last chance to stop Atro-

pus. They must travel to the moonlet, brave the void, and  nd

and defeat the aspect of Atropus before the moonlet reaches

the planets surface.

Aspect of Atropus

followed, astronomers have commented on the passage of an

anomalous comet that seems to appear whenever Dolurrh,

Realm of the Dead, is coterminous with the Material Plane.

Some theorize this comet is in fact Atropus of legend, and

one day the World Born Dead will visit Eberron again.

Outside of the dragons peering into the heavens to divine

the future, few comprehend the signi cance of the move-

ments of the celestial bodies. If mortals knew the evil far

above their heads, they would quake in their boots and seek

refuge in the bowels of the earth. Indeed, only the Argonnes-

sen dragons know what doom awaits them all, for they have

identi ed  a  celestial  object  whose  appearance  occurred  at

the same time that Cyre became the Mournland. It is an odd

thing moving through the Ring of Siberys. Some suspect

magical manifestation, maybe a planar anomaly, but a few know

the truth, and they do

their best to push such

thoughts  from  their

minds, lest they draw its

attention  by  dwelling

on what many believe

is the inevitable end of

the world.

ATROPUS

IN FAERN

Those  few  sages  who

even know of Atropus

debate  the  origins  of

this  elder  evil.  They

agree that Atropus was

spawned when Ao cre-

ated the  rst gods, but

where  they  differ  is

in  how  Atropus  was

formed. Some claim the

elder evil gained aware-

ness  from  the  divine

amniotic  fluid  sur-

rounding the  rst god

of death, while others

claim Atropus was the

last god Ao created, but

it was stillborn. Atropus

has never come close to

Faern, but those aware

of him are ever watchful

of the heavens, waiting

for the day when the moonlet circles the tapestry of night.

The moonlet is one of the drifting bodies forming the

ring around the dull gray planet known as Glyth, one of

the Five Wanderers that do not follow the ordinary paths of

the stars. Little do the mortals of Faern realize the cataclysm

affecting this distant world. Drawn by the widespread death

and destruction meted out by mind  ayer overlords, Atropus

drew close, masking its approach behind the belt of debris

forming  the  ring  around  the  planet.  While  the  illithids

waged their interminable wars against the native humanoids,

Atropus descended and wiped out all life, leaving Glyth an

empty husk. Now Atropus turns its attention to Faern and

begins its slide toward a world ripe for the taking.

ATROPUS IN EBERRON

Given the elusive character of the gods in the EBERRON setting,

it is not clear what or who Atropus is. The oldest mentions

of  this  entity  date  back  to  the  Age  of  Demons,  marking

Atropuss appearance during the climactic sacri ce of the

couatls  in  their  attempt  to  rid  their  world  of  the  demons

and force them to their native plane. In the millennia that

ATROPUS

Atropus is as much a place as it is a being. It is a small moonlet

spinning through the void, waiting to be ensnared by the

pull of the planets it nears. To those on the surface of the

chosen world, the elder evil appears as a speck in the sky. At

night it is almost invisible, blending in with the darkness,

but during twilight and dawn, it looks like a moving pinhole

of darkness.

As it draws closer and its sign intensi es, it grows, expand-

ing from a tiny dot to a small disk until it dominates the sky.

Pitted and slick with the black slime of the putrid amniotic

 uid of its birth, it hangs above, always drifting away from

the light of the sun and lurking overhead when the sun has

 ed. It has the appearance of a huge chunk of black stone,

but from certain angles, it looks like a great hairless head,

black eyes glassy and soulless.

Atropus has no understandable personality and no inclina-

tions other than craving the destruction of all living things.

This  rock  is  not  uninhabited:  Undead  conjured  from  the

darkest nightmares infest it. These horrors claim the craters

for themselves,  itting through the shadows, ravenous for

the energy of the living. The master of them all is the focus,

an extension of Atropuss will.

The focus is a headless, human-shaped creature with  esh

fossilized during Atropuss endless roaming through the

cosmos. Closer inspection reveals that its foul body shares

the same hideous coating that wells up from the rents and

 ssures on the moonlets surface.

CAIRA XASTEN

I hate the gods. They took my love, my life, everything I am. I will

punish them by taking from them what they most love: life. All

your little lives that are so precious to them.

Caira Xasten, ur-priest

Caira  Xasten  is  a  cruel  ur-priest,  a  foul  thief  of  divine

energy  who  bends  it  to  her  will.  Driven  by  an  insane

desire for revenge and emptied of compassion and mercy

by the tragedies of her life, she seeks to lift the burden of

her grief.

GOALS

Caira Xasten wants to destroy the world. She doesnt want

powershe wants revenge. Years ago, her lover and col-

league was struck down by a falling meteorite. The chances

of such an accident were so slim that she blamed the gods.

Robbed of a life with the one person she loved more than

anything, she went insane and bent all her considerable

resources  to  visiting  ruin  on  those  entities  she  despised.

She cares nothing for her own life or for the deaths of those

who stand in her way.

USING CAIRA XASTEN

Caira Xasten is a powerful adversary and one with unreason-

able goals. For much of the campaign, she can be a faceless

villain, a distant threat protected by layers of minions. The

encounters the PCs have with her as the campaign unfolds

should be through minions, such as when the minions steal

the forbidden tome beneath the cathedral, attempt to harvest

angel tears, or scour the land for the book of vile darkness. When

she begins to cast apocalypse of the sky (see sidebar, page 21),

the PCs should  nally uncover her identity and confront her

in the depths of her hidden lair.

Caira Xasten

DESCRIPTION

Time has not been kind to Caira. Whip-thin, tall, and  erce,

she  has  a  face  that  reveals  the  madness  and  corruption

that has haunted her since she vowed service to Atropus.

Her once-lustrous long, black hair now hangs loose and

wild  where  its  not  caught  in  tangles.  Deep  crows  feet

stretch out from the sides of her red-rimmed eyes, and

her mouth is frozen in a grimace. Caira wears tight- tting

gray breeches and a pale yellow shirt, both of which are

pierced with small holes and covered with old stains from

her experiments.

Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su) Once per day when a creature

that has a spell-like ability comes within 50 feet of Caira,

she can steal the ability for herself. She can use this

ability as often as the creature can or three times per

day, whichever is fewer. She uses the ability as the crea-

ture does with regard to caster level and save DCs. She

retains this ability for 24 hours. The creature victimized

by this ability does not lose its spell-like ability when it

is stolen.

Siphon Spell Power (Ex) Caira can sacri ce two spell slots

(or more) to prepare one additional higher-level spell she

can cast. Total the lower-level slots and then reduce them

to three-quarters of that number to determine the extra

higher-level spell slot.

Caira has used this ability to prepare quickened

mass in ict light wounds (using a 9th-level slot) by sac-

ri cing one 3rd-level, two 2nd-level, and  ve 1st-level

spell slots.

GORGUTH

The World Born Dead comes for the living. The time has come to

make our strike. The time has come for the dead to rule.

Gorguth

Loosed from the turmoil of the In nite Layers of the Abyss,

Gorguth commands a massive army of undead and demons.

To prepare the way for its master, it leads its hordes to slaugh-

ter the living in a grand orgy of violence. Gorguth despises

its existence and hopes to  nd release in the annihilation

of the world.

GOALS

Sickened by Orcuss incessant plotting, Gorguth  ed the

Abyss for the Material Plane, where it gladly serves Atropus.

Gorgoth follows this new entity not out of affection or

loyalty but because it promises an end to the nightmare of

existence. Gorguth spends its forces in appalling numbers,

caring nothing for the cost; those they slay simply rise up to

 ll the depleted ranks.

USING GORGUTH

Gorguth is destruction incarnate. It should distract the PCs

from attending to the larger threat, maybe even causing them to

attribute the weird sign to it instead of the true source. Gorguth

can be a menacing enemy, a whispered villain, or a looming

threat. Use Gorguth to propel the story forward or to represent

the upheaval and chaos resulting from Atropuss approach.

APOCALYPSE FROM THE SKY

A corrupt spell from Book of Vile Darkness, apocalypse from the

sky requires a 1 day casting time, so Caira wont be using it in

battle. If she does manage to cast the spell (for which she uses

angel tears as a material component), she takes 3d6 points of

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Constitution damage and 4d6 points of Wisdom drain. Then, all

creatures (including Caira) and objects within a 10-mile radius

take 10d6 points of damage. Caira believes this catastrophe will

draw the attention of Atropus.

DESCRIPTION

The Bleak General is terrifying. Beneath its black leather

armor, fashioned from the cured faces of mortals it has

slain, lies the wretched body of a bodakgenderless, black,

and with an empty visage. When its endless legions march,

Gorguth rides on the back of Skyshadow (its  ying mount),

surveying the movements of its forces and swooping down

to embolden them and shore up  agging lines.

Its clear to anyone who survives a brush with its baleful

gaze that something awful and alien drives this undead mon-

ster. Any trace of mercy or compassion was scourged from

it ages ago by the endless torments of the demons and the

countless engagements it has fought against many foes.

Aura of Despair (Su) Opponents within 10 feet take a 2 pen-

alty on saving throws.

Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) Gorguth takes 1 point of dam-

age each round its exposed to sunlight.

Death Gaze (Su) Death, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 24

negates. A humanoid who dies from this attack is trans-

formed into a bodak 24 hours later.

Gorguth  rides  Skyshadow,  an  enormous  construct  mount

created by stripping the magical essence from a nightwing

and  binding  it  into  the  form  of  a  construct.  The  creature

carries Gorguth over immense battle elds, wreaking havoc

upon the forces below.

Shadow Flight (Su) As a move action, Skyshadow can tele-

Shadow Clutch (Su) When Skyshadow  ies above a creature

(any square of its space passes directly over a square of

another creatures space) or hits a creature with a natu-

ral weapon, the creature is under Skyshadows shadow

clutch. At the start of Skyshadows turn, each creature

under shadow clutch must make a DC 27 Will save or

take 2d6 points of damage. A successful save negates the

damage, but does not end the effect.

This effect lasts for 10 rounds.

Bound to Master (Ex) If Skyshadows master (currently

Gorguth) is slain, Skyshadow becomes inert and, if  y-

ing, drifts to the ground at a rate of 10 feet per round. Its

alignment becomes neutral, and its damage reduction

becomes DR 15/adamantine. The creature who delivered

the blow that killed the previous master can become the

creatures new master or can designate a different mas-

ter. When Skyshadow gains a new master, its alignment

changes to match that masters and its damage reduc-

tion changes to DR 15/good and adamantine if the master

is evil or DR 15/evil and adamantine if the master is good.

Unholy Grace (Su) Skyshadow adds its Charisma bonus to

its Armor Class and on saving throws. These bonuses are

included in the statistics block.

THE MOONLET

Atropus is the moonlet, the location where the player char-

acters confront the elder evil and drive it from their world.

The moonlet is spheroid, 700 miles in diameter.

When the moonlet approaches close to the home world

of your campaign setting (assuming Earth as the default), it

takes up an orbit just outside the moons orbit, about 250,000

miles from the surface of the world. (If your campaign setting

features multiple moons, it begins its orbit outside the orbit

of the most distant satellite.)

Once  in  position,  the  moonlet  begins  to  circle  the

planet,  entering  a  de-

teriorating  orbit  and

picking up speed as it

loses altitude. The rate

of fall is up to you, but

it  should  correspond

with  the  progress  of

your campaign, the in-

tensity of the sign, and

the pace that best fits

your  needs.  (Remem-

ber,  this  is  a  floating

head  in  space,  not  an

astrophysics  project;

dont worry too much

about the time it takes

for  the  moonlet  to

descend.)

KEY FEATURES

The  moonlet  is  not  a

pleasant place. It is bar-

ren and rocky, overrun

with  sharp  spires  of

old stone, deep trench-

es,  and  mountainous

ridges piled on top of

each  other.  Bubbling

up  from  the  craters

pocking the surface is

a  noxious  tar.  Debris

picked up from count-

less worlds clutters the

surface.

The moonlet remains on the dark side of the world, keeping

the planet between it and the sun. As a result, the surface of

the moonlet is dark, granting total concealment (50% miss

chance) to all creatures on its surface.

The moonlet is a low-gravity environment. This has a

number of effects, as follows.

(cid:129)  Increase speed for all movement types by 5 feet.

(cid:129)  A creatures carrying capacity doubles, and it gains a +10

circumstance  bonus  on  Strength  checks  made  to  lift  or

move heavy objects.

(cid:129)  Creatures gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Strength-

based skill checks.

(cid:129)  Creatures take a 2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls.

(cid:129)  Falling damage is reduced to 1d4 points of damage per 10

feet fallen.

The moonlets surface functions as rugged mountain terrain

(DMG 89), except that cliffs are 4d610 feet tall and chasms

are 4d410 feet deep and measure 40 feet long.

The moonlet counts as being a minor negative-dominant

environment. Each round a living creature remains within

60 feet of the moonlets surface, it takes 1d6 points of damage

(when not in combat, it is easier to convert it to 35 points

of damage per minute). A creature reduced to 0 hit points

crumbles to ash. A death ward spell prevents this damage.

Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy,

including  inflict  spells,  are  maximized.  Class  abilities

that use negative energy,

such as rebuking or com-

manding  undead,  gain  a

+10  bonus  on  the  roll  to

determine Hit Dice affect-

ed.  Spells  and  spell-like

abilities  that  use  positive

energy,  including  cure

spells, are impeded (DMG

150), and characters take a

10  penalty  on  Fortitude

saves made to remove neg-

ative levels.

DEFENSES

The  moonlet  has  few  de-

fenses. The dangers of the

void  are  enough  to  keep

enemies  at  bay.  Unless

the moonlet is approached

when  it  has  already  en-

tered the atmosphereat

which  point  it  is  almost

too latecharacters must

contend with the hazard-

ous  environment.  After

3  rounds  of  exposure  to

the void, a living creature

must  make  a  successful

DC 20 Constitution check

or suffer excruciating pain,

becoming stunned and re-

maining so until it returns

to the atmosphere. Crea-

Doom befalls your world

tures that fail the check by 5 or more fall unconscious.

Creatures that require air are also subject to suffocation.

Attempting to hold ones breath requires a DC 15 Constitution

check every round. The DC increases by 1 each round. Even

on a successful check, the creature takes 1 point of Constitu-

tion damage from the pressure. On a failed check, or when

the creature stops holding its breath, it falls unconscious on

the following round, and its hit points fall to 0. On the next

round, the creature drops to 1 hit points and the round after,

its hit points fall to 10 and the creature dies.

If the characters set foot on or  y above the moonlet,

the undead infesting its surface spill forth. Each hour the

characters remain within 60 feet of the surface, theres a

20% chance for a random encounter, as shown on the table

below. If an encounter features a creature from a book you

dont have, pick a result from a book you do have.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

Given  the  moonlets  size,  it  could  take  an  entire  book  to

describe every location on its surface. The following are just

a few of the locations appear on the vast face of Atropus.

A. The Ichor Sea (EL 10)

The two areas marked A on the map are part of a large sea of

necromantic sludge formed from the decaying afterbirth of

creation. The  uid about 200 feet deep a short distance away

from the shoreline. The sea emits an aura of negative energy.

All undead within 20 feet of the shore gain +6 turn resistance,

+20 hit points, and a +4 profane bonus to Armor Class and

on saving throws. Living creatures in the area targeted by

negative  energy  effects  such  as  in ict  spells  or  spells  that

bewtow negative levels suffer the maximum possible effect

(this has no effect on the saving throw required after having

a negative level for 24 hours).

The Ichor Sea is treated as a major negative-dominant

environment. Each round, a creature within the sludge

must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level.

(For the save required 24 hours later, use the same DC.) A

creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit

Dice is slain, becoming an angel of decay (page 30) after 1d3

rounds. Each negative level bestowed grants the aspect of

Atropus 5 temporary hit points. These hit points last for up

to 1 hour.

B. The Great Depth (EL 7)

Piercing the side of the moonlet is an enormous pit 70 miles

across with no visible bottom. Creatures coming within 20

feet begin to hear the susurrus of Atropuss hate. Living crea-

tures exposed to these whispers must succeed on DC 30 Will

saves or become overwhelmed by madness. Affected creatures

become confused (PH 212) and take 1 point of Wisdom drain

each round they remain within range. A creature is entitled to

a new save each round to break free from the madness. Every

point of Wisdom drained from a living creature grants the

aspect of Atropus 5 temporary hit points. These hit points

last for up to 1 hour.

Creatures falling into the pit descend 300 feet until they

hit an underground offshoot of the Ichor Sea (area A). Such

characters take 20d6 points of damage from the fall as well.

C. Crater

Craters  created  by  meteors  and  other  debris  pock  the

moonlets surface. The craters vary depending on the size of

the object that struck the moonlet. A typical crater is 10 feet

in diameter, 4 feet deep, and has a 1-foot-tall rim around the

impact area. Loose rock (counting as dif cult terrain) spreads

out 10 feet in all directions.

Much larger craters, such as the ones marked on the map,

are especially dangerous and usually inhabited by undead.

D. Inky Tears (EL 12)

Welling up from one of the Eyes of Death (see area H) is a

bubbling torrent of hideous slime. This  uid has the same

properties as the Ichor Sea, but the save DC is 35.

E. Bubbling Crater (EL Varies)

This crater is similar to all the other craters marring the

moonlets surface, except that from its depth rises a fetid

black oozethe bilious blood of Atropus. A random undead

creature (or creatures) always attends this place.

All undead within 20 feet of the crater gain +10 turn

resistance, damage reduction 10/good, and +50 hit points.

Living creatures touching the foulness at the bottom of

the crater are affected as if they had come into contact with

the Ichor Sea (see area A).

F. The Trench (EL 18)

The ground drops away, forming a deep trench between the

Ichor Sea and the Great Depth. It extends some 30 feet down.

Haunting the depths is a nightcrawler. It oozes forth from the

trench wall and attacks any creatures it encounters.

Nightcrawler: hp 212 each; see Monster Manual 195 for

statistics.

G. Vents (EL 10)

Spewing from 6-inch-diameter pits are streams of poisonous

air. Characters who require air can breathe here, but each

round they do, they must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude

save  or  take  2d6  points  of  Constitution  damage.  One

minute later, they must succeed on a second save or take

an additional 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Character

slain by the poisonous air rise as dread wraiths (MM 258)

after 1d6 rounds.

H. The Eyes of Death

Each  spanning  40  miles  across,  these  glossy  black  stones

re ect no light, seeming to drink in everything shining on

their surfaces. These black expanses are in fact the eyes of

Atropus and, for as long as the PCs linger here, Atropus is

aware of their presence. Touching the surface of a stone has

the same effect as touching the Ichor Sea (area A). There is

also  a  10%  chance  each  minute  for  the  aspect  of  Atropus

to lumber toward the characters from a random direction,

2d610 feet away.

All undead on the Eyes of Death gain +6 turn resistance,

+20 hit points, and a +4 profane bonus to Armor Class and

on  saving  throws.  Living  creatures  in  the  area  that  are

targeted by negative energy effects such as inflict spells

or spells bestowing negative levels suffer the maximum

possible effect.

FACING THE ASPECT OF ATROPUS

The aspect of Atropus can appear at any time you like once

the player characters arrive at the moonlet. Atropus is no fool,

and it generally wont send its minions against the PCs until

it is prepared. However, the Focus might come on its own.

Each time it gains temporary hit points, theres a 10% chance

that the focus appears as described under area H.

ONE FIELD

Encounter Level 20

SETUP

The bone  eld is one of the few ruins on the moonlets

surface. The players can place their miniatures near any

edge of the map. Dont place the dread boneyard (DB)

on the map unless the PCs notice it (Spot DC 49). It hides

in the bones.

When  the  players  have  finished  arranging  their

miniatures, read:

Bones blanket the ground, with heaps of skulls

staring into the emptiness of the void. Breaking

through the debris is a pair of old pillars and the

scattered blocks of a ruined structure. An altar of

basalt, black with pale yellow veins, stands intact.

When a character comes within 15 feet of the dread

boneyard, read:

Suddenly the bones tremble, pulling together until

they assemble into the form of a serpentine horror

capped with the skull of a terrifying beast.

Bone Subsumption (Su) On a successful bite attack by

the dread boneyard, the target must succeed on a DC

39 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength,

Dexterity, and Constitution damage. This ability

works only against creatures that have skeletal

structures of bone (constructs, elementals, oozes,

and plants are immune).

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a dread boneyard

must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try

to use its utter subsumption ability.

Utter Subsumption (Su) If a dread boneyard wins a

grapple check after using its improved grab ability, it

attempts to pin the target on its next action. A dread

boneyard that begins its turn with a victim still

pinned and that succeeds on one more grapple check

kills its victim.

Summon Skeletons (Su) A dread boneyard can summon

undead creatures from its own body once per day. After

1d10 rounds, 36 troll skeletons or 24 young adult red

dragon skeletons appear and serve for 1 hour before

being reabsorbed into the dread boneyards body.

While in the area of the enhanced desecrate effect around

the altar, the dread boneyard has the following changed

statistics:

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Altar: The altar is dedicated to Atropus, erected eons ago

by an undead servitor. A detect evil spell reveals that the altar

radiates strong evil. It is also the center of a supernatural

effect equivalent to a desecrate spell. This effect, because of

the  presence  of  the  altar,  stacks  with  the  normal  desecrate

effect  already  present  throughout  the  area  because  of  the

restless dead sign. For characters  within the affected area,

checks made to turn undead take a 6 profane penalty. Un-

dead in the area gain an additional +1 profane bonus on attack

rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, as well as an additional

+1 hit point per Hit Die. (These modifiers are noted in the

creatures statistic blocks.) Animate dead spells cast within

the area create double the normal of undead (4 HD per caster

level).  Casting  consecrate  in  the  area  suppresses  the  entire

desecrate effect (not just the additional benefits to the undead)

for 1d4 rounds.

Bones: The DC of Balance, Move Silently, and Tumble

checks made in squares containing bones increases by 5. It costs

2 squares of movement to enter a square with bones. A character

falling prone in a bone-filled square takes 1d6 points of pierc-

ing damage.

Crater: It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square

containing a crater. A creature in a crater also has cover, and

so gains a +4 bonus to AC. All adjacent squares count as being

covered in scree, increasing the DC of Balance, Move Silently,

and Tumble checks made in these squares by 2.

Fallen Pillar: The fallen pillars stand 4 feet high and provide

cover. It costs 5 feet of movement to cross a fallen pillar.

Ridge: A ridge is surrounded by a gradual slope, which grants

a  +1  bonus  on  melee  attacks  against  foes  on  lower  ground.

Likewise, creatures standing on top of the ridge gain a +1 bonus

on melee attacks against foes on the slope.

Treasure: A DC 20 Search check uncovers one of the fol-

lowing items for each minute the PCs sift through the bones:

332 pp; 504 pp; 820 pp; a silver comb with strange glowing

gemstones (7,000 gp); a signet ring depicting an alien crest

(3,500 gp); a brocade jacket (150 gp); an adamantine crown

set with emeralds (8,300 gp); a frozen potion of neutralize poison;

a stone golem manual; a staff of illumination; and a divine scroll of

dimensional anchor, magic circle against evil, and remove curse.

TACTICS

The dread boneyard responds to the PCs, using its summon

skeletons  ability  to  bring  forth  1d3+1  young  adult  red

dragon skeletons. The skeletons charge on their  rst action,

each  against  a  different  character.  Every  round  thereaf-

ter, they take full attack actions as long as opponents are

within reach.

Meanwhile, the dread boneyard attacks the closest divine

spellcaster. On its  rst attack, it employs Power Attack (5

attack, +10 damage). On a hit, it uses its bone subsumption

ability and then uses improved grab. Both it and its opponent

make grapple checks. If the dread boneyard wins the check,

it drags the opponent into its space. On its next action, it tries

to pin the target to set up its utter subsumption ability. On

a success, its next action is to attempt yet another grapple

check to kill the target.

CONCLUSION

The enhanced desecrate effect around the altar as well as the

hostile environment make this encounter more challenging.

Characters  who  defeat  the  dread  boneyard  should  receive

125% of the normal experience award.

DEEP CRATER

EEP CRATER

Encounter Level 21

SETUP

The evolved atropal scion (A) hides in the crater, unno-

ticeable unless the PCs approach from overhead. The two

famine spirits (F) lurk in the Ichor Sea. The players place

their miniatures on the edge of the map from the direction

they approached the encounter.

When the PCs have placed their miniatures, read:

A deep crater forms a depression in the surface of

the moonlet. The impact must have been

impressive, since cracks spread out from the impact

site. A 5-foot-tall lip forms a ring around the hole.

Broken rock and scree spreads out in all directions.

A  lthy black lake stretches north.

When a character moves 10 feet or more onto the map,

place the two famine spirits where indicated and read:

Rising from the fetid waters are two corpulent

humanoids, their rolls of fat glistening with slime.

They have pale green skin marked with rot. Large

heads top their rotund bodies, and their massive

maws are  lled with decaying teeth. They move

with incredible swiftness, lumbering toward you,

jaws snapping with eagerness.

If the characters move to engage the famine spirits or

2 rounds after combat begins, read:

You spy a clot of rotten  esh lifting free from the

crater. It has a hairless, misshapen head with dark

glassy eyes. Its too-thin arms end in tiny clawed

hands twitching with unlife, while atrophied legs

hang useless below its rotten form.

TACTICS

The famine spirits work together against a single foe. At the

start of combat, they are within range of the evolved atropal

scions negative energy aura, so they gain +4 turn resistance

(the fast healing from the aura doesnt stack with their

natural fast healing). They attack the closest PC. The  rst

famine spirit uses Improved Sunder to shatter the characters

weapon. Both it and its target make opposed attack rolls. If

the famine spirit beats the PC, it deals 1d8+3 points of damage

to the weapon (PH 158).

The other famine spirit uses Improved Trip to knock

down the PCs. The famine spirit makes a Strength check

(+7 modi er) against the defenders Strength or Dexterity

check. If the famine spirit wins, the character falls prone.

If  the  character  wins,  she  can  make  a  Strength  check

against the famine spirits Strength check to try to trip it

(PH 158).

Thereafter, the famine spirits use full attacks in the hope of

delivering their vorpal bite. They use Power Attack if theyre

hitting.

While the PCs contend with the famine spirits, the evolved

atropal scion rises up from the crater. It casts hold monster on

a character  ghting one of the famine spirits. In the second

round, it uses its death gaze on any PC it can target and fol-

lows up with a quickened cone of cold. If any PCs approach

the  atropal  scion,  it  uses  its  death  gaze  and  then  casts

quickened teleport to put itself between the famine spirits

and the adventurers.

CONCLUSION

The dangerous environment and the dif cult combination

of creatures makes this combat more challenging than its

EL would indicate. Characters defeating the creatures gain

150% of the normal experience award.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Small Crater: It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a

square containing a small crater. A creature in a small crater

also has cover, and so gains a +4 bonus to AC.

Debris: Squares covered in debris increase the DC of Bal-

ance, Move Silently, and Tumble checks by 2.

Deep Crater: The deep crater is roughly 20 feet wide and

50 feet deep. The crater emanates a field of negative energy.

Each round a living creature remains in a square adjacent to

the  deep  crater,  that  creature  gains  one  negative  level.  If  a

creatures negative levels equal or exceed its Hit Dice or class

levels, the creature is slain, rising up as an angel of decay in

1d4 rounds. It retains none of its former abilities.

The  Ichor  Sea:  The  Ichor  Sea  emits  an  aura  of  negative

energy. All undead within 20 feet gain +6 turn resistance, +20

hit  points,  and  a  +4  profane  bonus  to  Armor  Class  and  on

saving throws. Living creatures in the area that are targeted by

any negative energy effects (such as inflict spells or spells that

bestow negative levels), suffer the maximum possible effect.

The Ichor Sea is far more dangerous to those that touch it.

Living creatures must succeed on a DC 35 Fortitude save for

each round of contact or gain a negative level. Creatures that

gain negative levels equal to or greater than their Hit Dice are

slain and rise as angels of decay in 1d3 rounds. The DC to re-

move a negative level after 24 hours is 35. Each negative level

bestowed grants the aspect of Atropus 5 temporary hit points.

These hit points last for up to 1 hour.

ANGELS OF ATROPUS

NGELS OF ATROPUS

Encounter Level 20

6 Angels of DecayLM

CR 15

SETUP

Six angels of decay (A) prowl the area here. The players

can place their miniatures along a map edge based on the

direction of their approach.

When the players have   nished placing their   gures,

read:

You look out over the vast black stones called the

Eyes of Death. Narrow, glowing crevices mar the

surface like a grotesque web of veins.

Six disgusting  gures  y above the blasted stone on

rotting wings. They have the vague shapes of

angels, but chunks of skin slough from their bodies

and  oat away into the void.

TACTICS

At the start of combat, the angels of decay are 60 feet above

the moonlets surface. As poor  yers, they can make 45-

degree turns for every 5 feet of movement, and they can

descend at double speed (100 feet). Each lands in a space

that will put it within reach of a PC. Each angel attacks

a different character; they double up if there are more of

them than there are PCs.

After the angels of decay land, the PCs are subject to

the angels rotting aura as long as the angels remain on

the ground.

In  melee,  the  angels  of  decay  use  Power  Attack

(included in the statistics block) to boost damage. Char-

acters  struck  by  two  or  more  attacks  take  additional

damage, and the angel of decay dealing the damage heals

5 hit points.

Combat attracts the attention of Atropus. In the round

after combat begins, the elder evil dispatches its aspect

(see page 19 for full statistics). It arrives from a random

direction after 1d6 rounds.

When the aspect of Atropus appears, read:

An enormous, headless, human-shaped

monstrosity lumbers into view. Its petri ed  esh

is coated with a slick layer of black ichor. The

creature radiates malice and rage as though it is

an extension of Atropus itself, come to obliterate

these intruders once and for all.

Once here, the aspect of Atropus bolsters the remaining

angels of decay with its negative energy aura, granting all

undead within 30 feet +5 turn resistance and fast healing

5 (this bene t stacks with that from the Eyes of Death). In

Rotting Aura (Su) When the creature is not flying, at the

end of each of an angel of decays turns, any corporeal

creature within 15 feet of it must succeed on a DC 27

Reflex save or take 5d6 points of damage (half on a

successful save). In addition, a living creature must also

succeed on a DC 27 Will saving throw or become

nauseated for 1 round.

Each round a creature takes damage from an angel

of decays rotting aura, the angel heals 5 points of

damage.

Rotting Touch (Su) An angel of decay that hits a single foe

with more than one attack in a round causes that

creatures flesh to rot, dealing an additional 1d6+6

points of damage. Each time this occurs, the angel of

decay heals 5 points of damage.

Unholy Grace (Su) An angel of decay adds its Charisma

bonus to its Armor Class and on saving throws. These

bonuses are included in the stat block.

addition, living creatures within the aura gain  ve negative

levels for as long as they remain in the area. The aspect of

Atropus then sacri ces 50 hit points to call down a meteor

shower. This attack affects the aspect of Atropus and the

angels of decay as well as their enemies.

As long as the PCs do not confront the focus, it hangs

back and uses spell-like abilities, starting with wail of the

banshee and then meteor swarm. If it is the last creature in

the combat, it uses call meteor shower as long as it has at

least 300 or more hit points.

9/27/07   2:47:04 PM

9/27/07   2:47:04 PM

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Crater: It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square

containing a crater. A creature in a crater also has cover, and

so gains a +4 bonus to AC.

Debris: Squares covered in debris increase the DC of Bal-

ance, Move Silently, and Tumble checks by 2.

Eyes of Death: This entire encounter takes place on one of

the Eyes of Death. Creatures touching the surface must succeed

on a DC 30 Fortitude save for each round of contact or gain

1d6 negative levels. Creatures that gain negative levels equal

to or greater than their Hit Dice are slain and rise as angels of

decay in 1d3 rounds. The DC to remove a negative level after

24 hours is 30. Each negative level bestowed grants the aspect

of Atropus 5 temporary hit points. These hit points last for up

to 1 hour.

All undead on the Eyes of Death gain +6 turn resistance,

+20 hit points, and a +4 profane bonus to Armor Class and

on saving throws. Living creatures in the area targeted by any

negative energy effects (such as inflict spells or spells bestowing

negative levels) suffer the maximum possible effect.

Veins of Atropus: A creature that is standing on one of

these  cracks  counters  the  effect  of  the  Eyes  of  Death.  It

does not gain negative levels from the eyes, nor does it suffer

the  maximum  effect  from  negative  energy  effects.  When

the creature attacks undead or affects them with a spell or

special ability, those undead do not gain the bonus to turn

resistance, to AC, or on saves from the Eyes of Death. (The

undead do not have to be on the veins of Atropus, just the

attacker does.)

These cracks are narrow, and there is no danger of falling

into one of them.

Once it exhausts its spells or when the characters engage

it in melee combat, it uses Whirlwind Attack to make attacks

against  each  PC  within  reach.  Its  slam  attacks  deal  Con-

stitution drain and bestow negative levels. It alternates its

attacks with Improved Sunder to destroy weapons capable

of bypassing its damage reduction.

CONCLUSION

When the aspect of Atropus is defeated, read:

The moonlet halts its progress, hanging motionless

in the sky. Great tremors ripple across the surface,

causing the ground to crack and buckle. A deep and

mournful moan  lls the air, issuing forth from the

Great Pit.

The moonlets surface rumbles as if under the effect of

an earthquake spell, requiring all characters to succeed on

DC 15 Reflex saves or fall down. Fissures tear open, and

all creatures on the ground have a 25% chance of falling

into  one  (Reflex  DC  20  to  avoid).  The  tremors  last  for

1d6 rounds, at which point the whole moonlet seems to

contractkilling  anyone  or  anything  still  trapped  in

a fissure.

Then the moonlet rockets away from the world, moving

at a speed of 40,000 feet. Characters still on the surface are

carried with the moonlet. As it moves away from the world,

Atropuss sign ends, and creatures animated by its effects

collapse, lifeless.

adness dwells on the mountaintop, where

feral tribesfolk feast on human flesh and

dance in worship of the darkness. Their song

can be heard even now, calling out to their

father to bring the eternal cold, the endless

darkness of death.

From the bloodstained journal

of an unnamed traveler

A  mote  of  alien  thought  given  form  and  flesh,

Father Llymic is not of this world. He dwells in an

icy prison, awaiting a time when the world will be

right for his coming. As his age of freezing darkness

draws near, his brood begins to appear, stalking the

wastes in preparation for his reign. If he is released

from his prison, the entire world will be covered

in a deadly glacier, removed from light and hope

for all time.

BACKGROUND

The  ancient  elves  spent  much  of  their  time  in

near-endless research and study. When the worlds

mysteries were unraveled, they turned their minds

to what lies beyond. The vast and varied planes of

existence  fascinated  them,  yet  they  still  sought

farther. The most powerful among them wanted

to know what lay beyond the planes. As part of

their  work,  the  elves  constructed  a  great  many  gates

and portals to other worlds and planes of existence. In

attempting to peer beyond the veils of in nity, they  nally

built their greatest creation: the Vast Gate, designed to

pierce the boundaries of the planes. What they found

destroyed them.

Legend holds that the Vast Gate opened a rift in reality,

allowing a glimpse into a place known only as the Far

Realm. This place of alien geometry, maddening thoughts,

and toxic natural law was antithetical to mortal life. Even

as the elves tried to close the gate, strange things slipped

through, forever tying the world to the Far Realm. Although

many of these entities have surfaced over the years only to

be banished or destroyed, some remain to spread their foul

taint. The records are far from clear, but the name of Father

Llymic appears more than once. (Knowledge [the planes]

DC 28)

Creatures of the Far Realm do not obey natural laws; their

alien nature is deadly to those who come in contact with

them. However, the world can affect them in strange ways

as well. Ancient records made by the Vast Gate survivors

note that some of the Far Realm entities could not live

in the world. Some died unnatural deaths, while others

merely ceased to function, going into a sort of dormancy

until conditions would be right for them to thrive. One

such entity seemed to have an aversion to light. Although

it was paralyzed, some aspect of this creature remained able

to send illusory projections, beckoning the unwary to visit

his unmoving form. These projections gave Father Llymic

his name, since the twisted monstrosity was hidden beneath

an illusion of a kindly old man. (DC 33)

Although  dormant,  Father  Llymic  still  proved  deadly.

Those fooled by his illusions were soon tainted by his cor-

ruption and had to be destroyed. Although exposing him

to light caused dormancy, it also caused his form to radiate

waves of deadly cold. Soon, sheets of ice began to engulf

his body. The elves moved him to a mountaintop, where his

chill would not harm anyone and the light of the sun might

keep him dormant forever. The few remaining caretaker

elves eventually died, and Father Llymic was forgotten.

(DC 38)

Legends  about  Father  Llymic  grow  vague  beyond  the

con nes of his mountain prison. Some rumors hold that the

last great age of ice can be attributed to him, when darkness

covered the land and he was nearly freed from his lethargy.

One tale speaks of icy alien creatures that wear the tattered

clothing of mountain barbarians and prowl the high passes,

bringing freezing darkness with them wherever they go.

(DC 43)

GOALS

Father  Llymic  has  never  stirred  on  this  world  and  his

alien thoughts are inscrutable to mortals. His terrifying

projection  and  unnatural  children  seek  to  change  the

world to one more suitable to his existence. At the very

least, the world of Father Llymic is one of endless darkness

and deadly cold. If he wakes, nothing would survive aside

from Father Llymic and his chosen brood. (Knowledge

[the planes] DC 28)

Father Llymics  rst goal is to be released from his prison

of ice. Light of any sort causes the walls to thicken, but dark-

ness causes them to melt. Fortunately, the power of the sun is

such that even over long winter nights, his prison has never

come close to melting. (DC 33)

With each creature perverted by his touch, Father Llymics

power grows. As it does, the sun begins to dim, its light drawn

out to keep the prison secure. If he becomes strong enough,

the sun itself would grow dark. (DC 38)

With the darkening of the sun, Father Llymic might  nally

live. Once he is free to bring his vision of reality to the world,

it would become a mirror of his alien home, a frozen paradise

of madness and death. (DC 42)

FATHER LLYMIC

IN THE CAMPAIGN

Father Llymic sleeps in an icy prison atop one of the worlds

tallest mountains. Locked away inside a glacier, he beckons

any who draw near to his form so that they might be trans-

formed into his servants. With each new servant, he gains

more of the strength needed to fully rouse.

Since he lurks in such an inhospitable place, this elder evil

is easy to add to any campaign. Only when Father Llymic

approaches his full might does the effect become noticeable,

as the sun begins to lose the power to contain him. The terrain

easily hides his brood, and travelers and remote mountain

clans go missing all the time. Only the most thorough

chronicler might notice that one mountain in particular is

full of strange tales regarding missing travelers and reclusive

natives. The obvious sign of Father Llymics comingthe

darkening of the sunmeans that it is almost too late to

stop him from waking.

Timeline

What follows is a possible campaign timeline with Encounter

Levels to help you construct adventures around the key events

that might occur as Father Llymic awakens.

EL 7: An entire caravan disappears while traveling through

a  nearby  mountain  pass.  Headed  by  Tierad  Rynesten,  the

adventuresome daughter of a nobleman, the caravan left

three weeks ago but has not been heard from since. Tierads

father seeks out adventurers to track down the caravan and

rescue his daughter. Unfortunately for Tierad, he ran afoul

of a tribe of barbarians living in the mountaina tribe

that secretly venerates the frozen god that dwells on the

peak. Although many of the drovers have been sacri ced

or eaten, some remain to be taken to Father Llymic for

his blessed touch. If the PCs free Tierad, she tells them

of the strange rituals practiced by the barbarians and the

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SIGN: DEAD SUN

The dead sun diminishes natural and magical lighting until the

sun no longer rises.

Faint: The radius of illumination from natural light sources

(both  bright  light  and  shadowy  illumination)  drops  to  half

normal, to a minimum of 5 feet. Sunrise occurs 1 hour later than

normal, and sunset occurs 1 hour earlier than normal.

Moderate: All spells and spell-like abilities that have the dark-

ness descriptor are enhanced: They are cast as though affected

by the Extend Spell feat, but do not require higher-level spell

slots or longer casting times?. The radius of illumination from

natural light sources drops to 5 feet. Sunrise occurs 2 hours later

than normal, and sunset occurs 2 hours earlier. Finally, average

temperatures drop by 2 degrees all over the world.

Strong: All spells and spell-like abilities that have the dark-

ness descriptor are strongly enhanced: They are cast as though

affected by the Extend Spell and Quicken Spell feats, but do not

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

require higher-level spell slots. In addition, spells and spell-like

abilities that have the light descriptor are impeded, meaning

that a caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the

level of the spell) or lose the spell or spell slot without effect;

even on a successful check, the light produced by the spell has

only half its normal range and no longer counters darkness

spells of any level. Natural light sources do not illuminate any

area at all, appearing only as dim spots. The sun rises for just

1 hour each day, and global temperatures drop by an additional

4 degrees.

Overwhelming: The sun vanishes altogether. Spells and spell-

like abilities that have the light descriptor, as well as alchemical

or magic items that generate light effects, cease to function.

Darkness spells continue to be enhanced as under the strong

sign. The average temperature plunges another 10 degrees and

drops by 1 degree further every day thereafter.

way that sometimes they would change, taking on inhu-

man  icy  features  before  leaving  the  tribe  forever.  This

plot can be set in any city that has a large mountain and

other villages nearby. Ideally, the PCs worked for Tierads

father in the past, making them the logical choice for his

call for aid.

EL 10 (Faint Sign): An icy glacier begins to creep down

the mountain where Tierad was once held prisoner. A small

town nearby is dealing with harsh winter conditions (regard-

less of the actual season). Any friends the PCs might have in

this village call for their help as strange ice creatures begin

murdering the remaining livestock and villagers. Although

the threat can be beaten back, the town must eventually be

abandoned to the grinding ice. The only thing left behind is

the image of an old man who wanders the streets and never

draws close to anyone, but always beckons onlookers toward

the mountain.

EL 13 (Moderate Sign): As the ice from the mountain

spreads  and  the  days  grow  noticeably  shorter,  darkness

begins to settle over the land. Rumors from all around the

area  report  ice  creatures  prowling  the  night  and  constant

disappearances. One small town has gone completely silent.

Drawn to the place, the PCs  nd it the home of horrible ice

monsters, as if all the villagers have been transformed into

mockeries of their former selves. The old man appears again,

this time grinning with a maw of icy fangs, beckoning to the

looming glacial peak in

the distance.

EL 16 (Strong Sign):

The sun is barely visible

in the sky, and snow and

ice  cover  the  land.  En-

tire  villages  are  empty,

and  terrible  ice  crea-

tures  roam  the  land.

In  one   nal  desperate

measure, the local lord

entreats the PCs to solve

this  problem,  giving

them whatever resourc-

es he can muster. There

is only one place to go:

the  mountain.  While

the  characters  climb

its snowbound slopes,

all  manner  of  alien  ice

creatures  try  to  slow

their ascent, leading to

a  terrible  con ict  with

the keepers of the sum-

mit: a tribe of converted

frost  giants  (encounter

31, page 42).

EL 17 (Overwhelm-

ing Sign): As the PCs

reach  the  mountains

peak, the sun no longer

rises and the tempera-

ture  keeps  dropping.

There  is  no  sunlight

anymore, and those who

dont have darkvision are practically blind. At the summit,

the  PCs  encounter  the  most  powerful  representatives  of

Father Llymics brood, including a transformed dragon. After

braving these last challenges, Father Llymics icy form  nally

stirs. His gigantic alien bulk shatters the last sheet of ice and

surveys the perfect darkness he has created (encounters 32

and 33, pages 44 and 46).

Only after Father Llymics defeat might the sun rise again

and the world begin to thaw. What world is left, however, is

for you to decide.

FATHER LLYMIC IN EBERRON

In Eberron, the Far Realm is known by another name: the

Plane  of  Xoriat.  When  the  plane  was  last  coterminous,

Xoriat  bled  all  sorts  of  horrors  into  the  world  until  the

Gatekeeper druids altered its orbit and the taint began to

wane. Father Llymic was one of the entities that managed

to  remain  behind.  The  Gatekeepers  entombed  his  body

atop one of the highest summits of the Howling Peaks in

present-day Zilargo.

Father Llymic is a deadly threat to all Khorvaire. If

he awakens, first Zilargo and Breland feel his icy touch,

and then the entire world might be drawn into madness

as Xoriat once again becomes coterminous. A few of the

more powerful daelkyrs know of Father Llymic and form

cults  near  the  surface  of  the  mountain  in  the  hope  of

freeing their immensely

powerful brother.

FATHER LLYMIC

IN FAERN

The high elves are known

for their skill in powerful

elven High Magic. During

the  time  of  Myth  Dran-

nor, they opened a gate to

the  Far  Realm  and  near-

ly  brought  disaster  upon

themselves. Although that

threat was averted, Father

Llymics  body  became  a

symbol  of  their  mistake.

His  body  has  remained

entombed in the Thunder

Peaks to this day, waiting

for the darkness to grant

his freedom.

Travelers making use of

the Thunder Gap might be

the  rst to notice Father

Llymics  menace,  since

that trail passes close to

his  glacial  tomb.  Once

Father Llymic wakes, Cor-

myr,  Sembia,  and  all  the

Dalelands  would  be  the

 rst to face his alien min-

ions. A splinter group of

Shars worshipers called

the Black Ice has taken up

the idea of freeing Father

Llymic for the glory of the dark goddess. These individu-

als have set up camp near his prison, and although some

have already been transformed, they still search for ways

to free him.

FATHER LLYMIC

In his true and unnatural form, Father Llymic looks like

a  cross  between  a  gigantic  crystalline  praying  mantis

and a horrible demon, with two scythelike claws in place

of arms. His head bears a trio of compound eyes above a

gaping maw of fangs. The rest of his translucent body is

covered in shards of crystal that form a deadly armor plat-

ing. When he moves, these plates grind and shatter against

one another, with new ones endlessly taking their place.

A cloud of freezing cold mist surrounds him, obscuring

his alien bulk.

While  he  is  imprisoned,  Father  Llymic  appears  as  a

strangely colored stain deep beneath the surface of a great

glacial  ow. If he were to be dug out, it would take only a

few days of darkness to revive him. Without such effort, it

might take centuries for him to  nd the strength to break

free, and then only through the conversion of countless

brood. Even dormant, however, Father Llymic has ways

of influencing the world around him. His tendrils worm

through the surface of the ice, so that any who stand directly

above him are affected by his corruption. In addition, he

can project an imagea shard of his dreaming mindinto

the world around him.

Father Llymic projects the illusory image of a wizened

elf man, bent with age. Calm and inoffensive in appear-

ance, the images clothes are ragged and worn. He walks

with a staff and never makes any noise. This projection can

be seen near Father Llymics tomb, beckoning explorers

closer. Although the projection is slow of gait and never

aggressive, it can never be caught. Whenever anyone draws

too close, it steps out of sight, reappearing some distance

away.  If  its  targets  refuse  to  follow  it,  the  image  grows

agitated,  appearing  before  them  and  silently  screaming

from a maw of razor-sharp ice fangs, then leaving to find

other prey.

Dark Healing (Su) This ability functions like fast healing, but

only when Father Llymic is in complete darkness or inside

an area of darkness, deeper darkness, or a similar effect.

True Seeing (Su) As the true seeing spell; continuous; caster

level 20th.

Deadly Chill (Su) The area around Father Llymic is incredibly

cold. Anyone within 30 feet of Father Llymic takes 4d6

points of cold damage each round and gains one level of

soul chill (see below). A DC 29 Fortitude save halves the

damage and negates the soul chill.

Tongues (Su) As the tongues spell; continuous; caster level

20th.

Discord and Woe (Su) Each round as a standard action,

Father Llymic can force a creature within 100 miles to

attempt a DC 30 Will save. An affected creature enters a

barbarian rage (PH 25), attacking the closest creature and

taking 1 point of vile damage per round until it is killed or

the effect ends. The creature can attempt a new Will save

each round to escape of the effect.

Light Torpor (Ex) Father Llymic is extremely susceptible

to light. When in the radiance of any natural or magi-

cal light, he is slowed (as the spell) with no save. Father

Llymic is considered undead when targeted by spells that

deal damage based on light, such as searing light and

sunburst. When exposed to actual sunlight, Father Llymic

must make a successful DC 30 Fortitude save each

round or slip into suspended animation (as the tempo-

ral stasis spell). This condition can be removed only by

keeping Father Llymic in complete darkness for at least

1 round.

Sonic Vulnerability (Ex) Father Llymic takes half again as

much (+50%) damage as normal from sonic attacks,

regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the

save is a success or failure.

Ice Step (Ex) Father Llymic ignores all movement penal-

ties associated with snow or ice on the ground. He

always succeeds on Balance checks against effects

caused by ice or spells or special abilities that have the

cold descriptor.

Augmented Critical (Ex) Father Llymics claws are extraor-

dinarily sharp. They threaten a critical hit on a natural

attack roll of 1820, dealing triple damage on a success-

ful critical hit. Father Llymics claws are not subject to

effects such as keen edge that would further improve his

threat range.

Soul Chill (Su) The touch of Father Llymic chills the souls of

living creatures. Any creature hit by Father Llymics natu-

ral weapons gains one level of soul chill. Levels of soul

chill act like negative levels, but they cannot be restored

naturally and never result in actual level loss. Levels of

soul chill can be restored only by casting restoration while

the target is bathed in natural sunlight. A creature that

gains a number of levels of soul chill equal to or greater

than its Hit Dice immediately transforms into a brood

spawn creature (see template) and cannot be restored by

any mortal means.

Brood Seed (Su) As a standard action, Father Llymic can im-

plant a target with a brood seed by making a melee touch

attack. If successful, the target gains 1d4 levels of soul

chill each round unless he succeeds on a DC 29 Fortitude

save. This save must be made every round until success-

ful. The brood seed can be removed only by casting re-

move disease while when the target is in the area of a light

spell or similar effect, or in natural sunshine.

Summon Brood (Su) Father Llymic can summon brood crea-

tures up to three times per day as a standard action. Al-

though the kind of creature can vary, each use of this abil-

ity can summon no more than three creatures that have a

total of 24 HD or lower. The creatures arrive immediately

and serve Father Llymic until slain.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) Father Llymic is immune to all di-

vine divination spell effects.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

THE BROOD

Do not look to them for compassion or mercy. They are not of this

world and live only to carry out the will of their alien father.

From a scroll of the ancient elves

Stalking the wastelands in preparation for Father Llymics

awakening, the brood mirror their creators twisted form.

Birthed from the bodies of unsuspecting creatures, the brood

are pale mockeries of their former selves, recast in plates of

frozen crystal with vicious claws and sharp-edged teeth.

GOALS

The  brood  remember  nothing  of  their  former  lives  and

seek only to carry out Father Llymics will. They prowl the

area around his frozen form, subduing intruders and native

creatures and taking them to be transformed. If a threat to

Father Llymic surfaces, the brood take any means necessary

to drive off or destroy the enemy.

USING THE BROOD

The brood are the primary adversaries PCs face when deal-

ing with Father Llymic. Although initial encounters might

involve crazed cultists who venerate the alien creature, these

soon succumb to Father Llymics will and become the  rst

brood. At  rst the brood consist of nothing more than vague

rumors and lone sightings, but as Father Llymics strength

grows, they become an overwhelming threat, marching out

from their icy home to spread their plague. As the end draws

near, the brood are everywhere, having transformed every

creature near Father Llymics icy prison.

DESCRIPTION

Retaining only a vague resemblance to the creatures that

spawned  them,  the  brood  are  terrible  to  behold.  Made

entirely of pale blue crystal, brood spawn are covered in

sharp  spikes  and  ridged  plates.  These  protrusions  grind

against one another but never dull. When a brood spawn

is wounded, a pale ichor  ows out of the wounds, quickly

hardening into a seal. Strange organs pulsate and strain

inside them, and no two share the same physiology, even

if they originated from the same type of creature. All have

three perfectly round eyes atop their head, above a cavern-

ous maw. These eyes allow them to see in any conditions

of ilumination.

Mentally, all brood spawn are extensions of Father Llymics

thoughts. They carry out his desires without any need for

communication. The spawn go about their business with

cold precision, completely uncaring of those in their path.

The brood have only two goals: to protect Father Llymic and

to expand the brood.

BROOD FEVER

Although Father Llymics touch can transform creatures into

brood spawn, the far more common method of creating these

horrors is through the contraction of brood fever. Most contract

this ailment after being subjected to a brood spawns breath

weapon, but any who sleep within 300 feet of Father Llymics

frozen form also risk contracting it. Those afflicted with this

disease cannot overcome it naturally.

Brood Fever: Contact, Fortitude DC 18, incubation period 1

day, damage one level of soul chill.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Levels of soul chill act like negative levels, but they cannot

be  restored  naturally  and  never  result  in  actual  level  loss.

Levels of soul chill can be restored only by casting restoration

while the target is bathed in natural sunlight. Creatures that

acquire a number of levels of soul chill equal to or greater

than their Hit Dice immediately transform into brood spawn

creatures  (see  template)  and  cannot  be  restored  by  any

mortal means.

BROOD SPAWN TEMPLATE

Brood spawn is an acquired template that can be added

to any corporeal creature except for an undead (referred to

hereafter as the base creature).

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to outsider

with the native subtype. The creature loses all other subtypes.

The creatures size remains unchanged.

Hit Dice: Change all the base creatures racial Hit Dice to

d8s. The base creatures Hit Dice increase by 3. Do not change

class HD.

Challenge Rating: Depends upon the base creatures

original Hit Dice, as follows:

Alignment: Always chaotic evil.

Armor  Class:  The  base  creatures  natural  armor  bonus

increases by 4.

Speed: A brood spawns land speed increases by 20 feet.

The speeds for other movement modes are unchanged.

Attacks: A brood spawn retains all the natural weapon

attacks of the base creature and also gains two claw attacks

and a bite attack if it didnt already have them. The bite attack

is a secondary natural attack. Brood spawn lose all weapon

pro ciencies (and the bene ts of feats related to weapon use)

and use their natural weapons instead.

Damage: A brood spawn has two claws and a bite attack.

If the base creature does not have these attack forms, use the

appropriate damage values from the table below according

to the creatures size.

Attack Options: A brood spawn loses all the attack options

of the base creature and gains the attack option described

below.

Icy Touch (Ex): All of a brood spawns natural attacks deal

extra cold damage. Use the appropriate value from the table

above according to the creatures size.

Special Actions: A brood spawn loses all the special

actions of the base creature and gains the special action

described below.

Breath Weapon  (Su): Once per day, a brood spawn can

breathe a cone of freezing dark vapor. Those caught in the

cone take cold damage and contract brood fever. A success-

ful Re ex save (DC 10 + 1/2 brood spawns Hit Dice + brood

spawns Con modifier) halves the damage and resists the

disease. This breath weapon also extinguishes any natural

light sources and dispels magical light sources beneath 3rd

level. The size and damage dealt by this cone depends upon

the base creatures original Hit Dice, as follows:

GLACIAL

TOMB

An  imposing  mountain

holds Father Llymics tomb.

Surrounded by jagged hills,

the  mountain  is  studded

with icy crags, treacherous

ice  bridges,  and  perilous

cliffs. Few paths make their

way  to  the  summit;  all  of

them  are  home  to  danger-

ous  mountain  predators

and,  as  the  time  of  Fa-

ther  Llymics  wakening

draws near, swarms of alien

brood spawn.

As the light of the sun begins

to  dim  and  the  cold  increases,

great sheets of ice cover the mountain and the surrounding

hills. Eventually, this glacier begins to move across the sur-

rounding countryside at an accelerated rate. The mountain

becomes home to cascades of deadly ice spears, thunderous

avalanches, and strange vistas of unnatural ice formations.

Some areas begin to exhibit odd geometric patterns in the

ice, many of which defy logic or reason.

spawn  are  sickened  when-

ever they are in the area of

a light spell or similar effect.

When  in  natural  sunlight,

they are slowed (as the spell).

Brood spawn are treated as

undead  when  targeted  by

spells that deal damage based on light, such as searing light

and sunburst.

Sonic Vulnerability (Ex): Brood spawn take half again as

much (+50%) damage as normal from sonic attacks, regard-

less of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a

success or failure.

Brood spawn ogre

Spell Resistance (Ex): Brood spawn gain spell resistance

equal to their adjusted HD +5 (maximum 25).

Resistances (Ex): Brood spawn are resistant to fire and

electricity damage, based on their adjusted Hit Dice (after

the application of the template), as follows:

KEY FEATURES

When planning for activity around the glacial tomb, be sure

to familiarize yourself with the rules for mountain terrain

(DMG 89) and cold dangers (DMG 302). If you have access to

the Frostburn supplement, that book has additional details

on adventuring in cold environments.

Snow and ice cover the mountain. Temperatures hover

just above freezing during the day and plummet to well

below at night (the exact temperature varies depending on

the time of the year and the power of the dead sun sign). The

environment is severe cold, progressing to extreme cold as

Father Llymic begins to stir.

9/27/07   2:50:59 PM

9/27/07   2:50:59 PM

The surface of the mountain consists of three primary

materials.

Stone: Small patches remain where snow and ice have not

found purchase. These areas are rough, but otherwise easy

to traverse.

Snow: Although most of the snow is only a foot or so

deep  (requiring  two  squares  of  movement),  other  areas

contain deep snowdrifts. These areas require 4 squares of

movement to enter and might hold other hazards as well,

such as pockets of empty space beneath the snow that act

as large pits.

Ice: Great smooth ice floes make their way down every

side of the mountain. Traversing these floes requires a

DC 15 Balance check. Failing by 5 or more results in a fall

that, depending on the slope, might carry a character far

away from his companions. Other areas are merely slick

and level, requiring a DC 10 Balance check to charge or

run across.

Aside from these effects, the weather itself makes traveling

the mountain extremely dif cult. Snow, hail, and lightning

constantly assault its slopes. This weather can limit vision

and obscure trails.

DEFENSES

As long as Father Llymic remains imprisoned, defense of the

glacial tomb falls to his minionsthe crazed cultists and the

brood spawnand the harsh environment.

Cultists and insane individuals prowl the lower reaches

of the mountain, incapable of surviving the higher sum-

mits. These groups all succumb to brood fever eventually,

joining the spawn up above, while new groups and indi-

viduals constantly arrive to take their place. The cultist

groups might have an order among themselves, but none

of them work together toward any sort of common defense.

These maniacs attack anyone bearing natural or arti cial

light. Characters who are not carrying such illumination

might be able to bypass these groups with a few Bluff and

Disguise checks.

When the PCs reach the mountainside, the environment

changes  dramatically  and  brood  spawn  become  common.

Encountering a single creature precipitates a much greater

con ict as all nearby brood move in to investigate the distur-

bance. The concentration and power of the brood increases

the higher up one goes.

Those hoping to  y to reach the peak  nd it to be a nearly

impossible task. Fierce, driving snow and hail assault any

who  ascend  to  more  than  20  feet  above  the  mountains

surface. This constantly roiling storm limits visibility to 5

feet, slows movement by half, and deals 4d6 points of cold

damage  per  round  of  exposure.  As  an  added  hazard,  the

storm is home to  ying brood spawn that have no dif culty

navigating it.

Anyone  reaching  the  summit  with  a  functioning  light

source provokes the wrath of all the brood spawn within

1 mile, who quickly make their way to the peak to destroy

the intruders.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

The mountain that holds Father Llymics tomb is huge,

covering many square miles. Although numerous threats

and dangers plague the ascent, only the peak is detailed

here. Feel free to add groups of cultists, wandering packs of

brood spawn, dangerous terrain, and other hazards during

the approach. Unless otherwise noted, all these areas are sites

of intense weather, including snow that limits sight to 30

feet and howling winds that impose a 2 penalty on ranged

attacks. Creatures of Medium or smaller size that attempt to

 y are checked by the winds and cannot ascend more than

20 feet (but can descend normally).

A. Garden of Alien Ice (EL 8)

As travelers ascend the peak, they encounter a large plain

of relatively  at ground. Dotting this landscape are strange

statues made out of ice. Odd shapes and alien forms make

up most of the sculptures, including titanic spheres of ice

balanced atop slender stalagmites, perfect spirals of ice that

seem to tighten to in nity, and grotesque images of beasts

that cannot be. Those wandering through this eerily quiet

garden must make a DC 20 Will save each round or go mad

for 1d3 rounds, as the confusion spell.

B. Keep of the Frost Giants (EL 14)

This  ruined  structure  is  carved  from  large  slabs  of  pure

white rock and covered in a thick layer of frost and ice. It

was the home of a small tribe of frost giants who long ago

succumbed to brood fever. Although most left to spread the

plague of Father Llymic across the land, three of the terrible

behemoths remain. See encounter 31, page 42.

C. Ice Bridge (EL Varies)

The path leading up to the summit is broken at this point.

Only a sheet of ice bridges the 60-foot gap. Brood spawn

creatures have laired in this area in the past, and a pack of

them might be here when the PCs arrive. Typical creatures

include brood spawn trolls, ogres, and even a frost worm. The

ice bridge is 15 feet wide and has the following statistics.

Ice Bridge: Hardness 10; hp 90 per 5-foot section; break

DC 55, minus 10 per 5-foot section destroyed.

Anyone walking on the ice bridge must make a DC 10

Balance  check  to  move  at  half  speed  along  the  surface

for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less indicates the character

cant move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means he

falls prone. He can try to walk at his full speed with a 5

penalty on  the check. If  he  is  attacked  while  trying  to

balance, he is considered  at-footed unless he has at least

5 ranks in Balance. If he takes damage while balancing, he

must make another Balance check against the same DC to

remain standing.

If the character falls prone, he might slide across the icy

surface. The chance for sliding and the direction he slides

depends on the situation that made him fall. Simply falling

while trying to move brings a 25% chance of a 5-foot slide in

the direction he was moving. This assumes he has moved 15

feet or less when he falls; he slides an additional 5 feet if he

has traveled more than 15 feet in the current round. Sliding

can provoke attacks of opportunity if the character slides

through a threatened square.

Falling as a result of being attacked brings a 50% chance

of a slide directly away from the direction of the attack. The

character slides for 5 feet in this case.

Anyone who falls from the bridge plummets 100 feet to

the plain below, taking 10d6 points of damage.

D. Black Ice Spire (EL Varies)

The winding path meets up with a towering spire of ice at

this location. This spear reaches 200 feet above the level

of the path, making its tip all but invisible to those at its

base.  Only  during  lightning   ashes  can  the  pinnacle  be

seen.  Flying  brood  spawn  use  this  location  to  roost  and

wait for the arrival of their master. These creatures do not

bother those on the path unless they see light of any kind,

in which case they swoop down to attack. The brood spawn

white  dragon  that  resides  in  area  E  can  be  found  here,

clinging to the side of the spire. Although numerous rings

and gouges are carved into the spire, the slick ice requires

a DC 25 Climb check.

E. Cave of the Wyrm (EL 15)

This cave is the home of a brood spawn white dragon. See

encounter 32, page 44.

F. Ice Falls (EL 10)

A great cascade of black glacial ice pours down the mountain-

side at this spot. Its numerous crevasses and cracks make it

easier to climb than most ice surfaces, requiring only a DC

20 Climb check. Being this close to Father Llymic, however,

adds another danger to the 60-foot ascent: Those touching the

ice must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or contract

one level of soul chill.

G. Plain of Darkness (EL 11)

This vast sheet of pure black ice is mirror-smooth and dif cult

to traverse. Crossing the ice requires DC 20 Balance checks

each round. Black vapor seeps from the ice, acting as an

inhaled poison. Those who breathe in the vapor must make

a DC 22 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain

as visions of a frozen alien world covered in darkness are

forever burned into their minds. This save must be repeated

1 minute later. Brood spawn can be found here, but they are

motionless, as if in prayer. Each one has Wisdom 0 and is

effectively comatose.

H. Father Llymics Prison (EL 18)

Atop the mountain, near its highest peak, Father Llymic is

entombed in a thick sheet of glacial ice. Seven pillars hum-

ming with eldritch power, each bearing ancient Elven runes,

surround the crack that contains him. By the time the PCs

reach this point, the sun is extinguished and the time of

Father Llymics awakening is at hand. One by one, the seven

pillars of ice shatter as the last bonds of his imprisonment

fail. When the  nal one crumbles, Father Llymics great alien

bulk crawls up from below, surveying his new world. See

encounter 33, page 46.

9/27/07   2:53:29 PM

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Ground: The surface of the unobstructed ter-

rain here is slick, but not especially so. Characters

must make a DC 10 Balance check to run or charge

across the surface. Failure means that the character

can act normally, but cannot run or charge. In

addition, add +2 to the DC of all Tumble checks

across  this  surface.  Brood  spawn  do  not  take

these penalties.

Rubble: The ground in certain places is strewn

with large chunks of rubble. These squares count

as  difficult  terrain,  requiring  2  squares  of

movement to enter. The frost giant brood spawn

can throw pieces of rubble from these piles.

Each square of rubble has two usable rocks.

Treat rubble as an improvised Large weapon

with a range increment of 10 feet that deals

4d6 points of damage.

Structures: The walls of the keep are all

roughly  40  feet  tall  and  covered  in  frost

and ice. Due to the damage, however, scaling

the structures requires only a DC 25 Climb check. The

thick outer walls of the keep have hardness 8 and 450 hit

points. The inner walls also have hardness 8 but only 180

hit points.

Doors: The two gigantic doors of the keep lie in ruin before

it. A frost giant brood spawn can throw one of these doors as a

standard action. The door is an improvised weapon (same bonus

as rubble) with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone hit by a

door takes 2d8+11 points of damage and must make a DC 15

Balance check or fall prone.

When a character comes to within 20 feet of the keep,

read:

Three large forms come rushing into view from

inside the ruins. Fully twice as tall as a man, these

creatures are made of pure crystal shards, covered in

razor-sharp spikes and plates. Three cold eyes stare

out in silent malice from each of their brows as they

rush you.

TACTICS

All three brood spawn frost giants rush out of the keep

on  the  first  round  to  engage  the  PCs  out  in  the  open.

They  target  their  attacks  against  PCs  bearing  a  func-

tioning light source, whether its natural or magical in

nature. If kept at range, they use their spell-like abilities

to hamper and damage the PCs by separating them with

walls of ice, damaging them with ice storm, and weakening

spellcasters  with enervation.  They  also  use  their  breath

weapons whenever they can catch half of the intruders

or more in the blast.

The worgs (W) wait 1 round before revealing their pres-

ence. They  rst cast darkness on their collars and move into a

closer position. In the following round, one or more of them

casts sleet storm to catch the entire party before moving in

to attack. The worgs do not use their breath weapons unless

sorely pressed.

These creatures use their spell-like abilities and breath

weapons without regard to their companions, relying on

their immunities to negate the damage. These brood spawn

 ght to the death.

Prolonged combat here attracts other brood spawn to

assist in holding the path. After 10 rounds, 1d4+1 brood

spawn  ogres  (see  page  36)  come  to  investigate  from  a

nearby encampment.

ICE WYRM

CE WYRM

Encounter Level 15

SETUP

Beyond the black ice spire is a spur in the path that leads

to a dark cave opening in the side of the mountain. The

players can place their miniatures anywhere along the

path  leading  past  this  cave.  The  brood  spawn  white

dragon (W) starts just inside the cave, well out of sight

of the PCs.

When the characters spot the cave, read:

The path you have been following continues up the

mountain, but a side path leads directly to a large

icy cave.

If  the  characters  ignore  the  cave  and  continue  on,

read:

Suddenly a tall wall of pure ice appears in front of

you, blocking your path. A ferocious howl

emanates from the ice cave. Something stirs in the

darkness.

If the characters approach the cave, read:

Just before the cave is a broad plain of perfectly

smooth ice. On the far side, darkness seethes from

the opening as a dragonlike creature crawls out.

Made of the same crystal as all the other beasts of

this mountain, it bounds in your direction with a

thunderous howl.

TACTICS

This brood spawn is a cunning opponent, using its sur-

roundings to its best advantage. It moves out from its cave

only close enough to unleash its breath weapon and does

not  y unless cornered. It instead waits for the PCs to

approach it before using its powerful tail slap against the

thin ice underfoot. If any characters fall in, its next action

is to use its wall of ice ability to seal the hole, trapping them

in the freezing water.

Once reduced to 130 hit points or fewer, the brood

spawn dragon flies up above the group, hiding in the

howling storm. From there, it uses greater dispel magic

on any of the characters who were causing it harm in

melee. After hitting these foes, it returns to the ground,

focusing  on  spellcasters  and  other  support  characters

before returning to that combat. The white dragon  ghts

to the death.

If the characters bypass this brood spawn white dragon,

it  ies up to join the  ght with Father Llymic the moment

he is freed.

9/27/07   2:54:24 PM

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Icy Plateau: The entire area between the path

and the cave is a sheet of smooth ice. Characters

moving across this surface must spend 2 squares

of movement to enter a square covered in ice.

Increase  the  DC  of  all  Tumble  checks  by  5.

Brood  spawn  can  move  about  this  surface

without penalty.

Thick Ice: These portions of the ice are par-

ticularly thick. This ice has hardness 10 and 180

hit points. Ice takes full damage from fire. If any

5-foot section of ice is destroyed, it leaves a hole

leading into the open water below. When a sec-

tion is destroyed, all neighboring sections of ice

immediately take half their original hit points

in damage, which might cause a chain of holes

to open up.

Thin  Ice:  Although  this  ice  is  strong

enough to support the weight of any of the

combatants,  it  is  still  thin.  This  ice  has

hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If any 5-foot

section of ice is destroyed, it leaves a hole leading into the

open water below. When a section is destroyed, all neighbor-

ing sections of ice immediately take half their original hit

points  in  damage,  which  might  cause  a  chain  of  holes  to

open up.

Water:  Beneath  the  ice  is  a  pool  of

freezing cold water. Creatures that fall into this water take

1d6 points of cold damage per round. Swimming in this

water requires DC 15 Swim checks. Those trapped under-

neath the ice risk suffocation.

CONCLUSION

The ice cave of this dragon is full of treasure, including

8,400 gp, 12,900 sp, a +2 thundering warhammer, a wand of

daylight (8 charges), and a scroll of restoration. (There might

be  other  treasure  here  as  well,  if  you  want  to  increase

the hoard.)

Due to the icy conditions and the creatures environ-

mental advantages, characters defeating the brood spawn

white dragon should receive 125% of the normal experi-

ence award.

Encounter Level 18

SETUP

This encounter occurs at the summit of the glacial tomb

and is the site where Father Llymic has spent countless

centuries in wait. Have the players place their miniatures

anywhere along the eastern edge of the map. Father Llymic

(F) is still imprisoned when the PCs reach this site and is

not visible. The great crevasse in the middle of the map

does not form until Father Llymic breaks free.

When the PCs reach the summit, read:

The path you have followed has led to this lonely

summit atop the frozen mountain. It is quiet here,

as if the storms below cannot reach this lofty

height. Before you lies a broad plain of smooth

black ice, in the center of which stand seven stone

pillars, each carved with a series of eldritch runes.

Suddenly, one of the pillars cracks and crumbles.

The PCs have only 2 rounds to prepare as the remaining six

pillars crack and crumble in succession. If the overwhelm-

ing sign has not yet manifested, it does so now.

After 2 rounds, read:

With a thunderous crack, the  nal pillar crumbles

and the entire surface of the ice shudders. A great

rent opens in the ice as a titanic crystalline

insectlike creature crawls up from the depths. Its

proportions are like those of a praying mantis, but

its features are truly alien. Three eyes peer out from

its brow above a maw full of fangs. It peers at you

for a moment before charging.

TACTICS

Father Llymic opens combat by using his discord and woe

male c property. He then calls forth three brood spawn

barbarians (B) from the surrounding caves. These brood

spawn charge and attack the nearest enemy. In the follow-

ing rounds, Father Llymic uses his abilities to their best

effect, targeting any character that has a functioning light

source before all others. If no light source presents itself

(which is likely considering the overwhelming dead sun

sign), Father Llymic instead closes with the nearest enemy

to use his melee attacks while exposing as many PCs as

possible to his deadly chill. He also uses his quickened cone

of cold spell-like ability whenever he can catch multiple

PCs in the blast. If the PCs prove resistant to cold, he uses

greater dispel magic in hopes of weakening their resistance.

If facing only a single foe, Father Llymic tries to implant

his brood seed.

9/27/07   2:55:15 PM

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Dark Ice: The entire top of the mountain is a

sheet of smooth ice. Characters moving across this

surface must spend 2 squares of movement to enter

a  square  covered  in  ice.  Increase  the  DC  of  all

Tumble checks by 5. Brood spawn can move about

this surface without penalty. This ice also gener-

ates  a  field  that  maximizes  all  cold  spells  and

effects.  The  effect  of  this  field  also  applies  to

the breath weapons of all brood spawn and Father

Llymics deadly chill aura.

Crumbled Pillars: Each one of these pillars

counts as difficult terrain. Although ruined, each

one  radiates  overwhelming  abjuration  magic.

More important, the runes on the pillars amplify

light spells and effects. Although the true power

no longer functions, some residual magic remains.

Anyone using a piece of one of these pillars as

a material component for a spell that has the

light descriptor can cast it normally, despite the

current level of the dead sun sign. Each piece

of stone is consumed in the casting of the spell and each pile

of rubble contains only one piece of stone that can be used

for this purpose. A piece of stone can be found with a DC 15

Search check by any character capable of seeing the stones

magical auras.

Crevasse: This opening drops down 100 feet, and anyone

falling into it takes 10d6 points of falling damage. In addition,

Father Llymic has been imprisoned for too long to accept

defeat and  ghts to the death. The moment Father Llymic

is reduced to 180 hit points or fewer, he lets out a telepathic

cry that calls all brood spawn within a 10-mile radius.

Although most do not arrive for some time, any creatures

not slain in previous encounters come to his aid after 2 to 3

rounds. In addition, other  ying brood spawn might arrive

within a few rounds, if the PCs are having an easy time of

the  ght.

the hole radiates a terrible chill. Anyone within 20 feet of

the  hole  takes  8d6  points  of  cold  damage  per  round  and

gains  one  level  of  soul  chill.  Characters  receive  a  DC  25

Fortitude  save  for  half  damage  and  to  negate  the  level  of

soul chill.

CONCLUSION

The moment Father Llymic is destroyed, a faint  icker of

light appears in the sky as the sun returns. Although it takes

a few days for the light to return to full strength, this event

causes  fear  in  the  hearts  of  all  brood  spawn,  who  quickly

 ee the area. Within a week, all the brood spawn die, melt-

ing into pools of ichor that forever stain the landscape. The

arctic conditions slowly subside, but the effect on the world

is devastating. Entire towns are emptied, crops are ruined,

countless animals slain, and the landscape is scarred and

ruined. With time, things might return to some semblance

of normalcy, but nothing is ever again as it was.

The Zoretha Scrolls, chap. 13, verses 2325

The Hulks of Zoretha are  ve stone monoliths that

have  stood  still  and  silent  for  as  long  as  history

records. Deep within their stone hearts pulse  ve

malevolent  intelligences  determined  to  destroy

all life on this plane. If awakened, the Hulks will

destroy  the  world  to  make  a  nest  for  their  own

foul brood.

BACKGROUND

Few scholars have heard of the Hulks of Zoretha.

Not many have ever seen the Hulks, and fewer

still have lived to pass on the tale of five stone

monoliths hidden deep within the mountainous

snow-capped north. Those who know of the Hulks

have only read of them in dusty ancient scrolls,

and the barely comprehensible tidings contained

therein  are  usually  discounted  as  superstitious

nonsense, mad ramblings, or at best archaic and

obsolete information.

Only the most perceptive aficionados of the ancient

and  the  bizarre  notice  the  strange  similarities  in  the

archaic accounts of visits to the Hulks. These accounts

reveal that the Hulks have existed far longer than the

reach of recorded memory, even that of the elves. They

are too old to have been carved by any civilization known

to mortal scholarship, and no mythology hints at their

creation being attributed to any god. (Knowledge [his-

tory] DC 32)

The  scholars  most  knowledgeable  about  the  Hulks

of  Zoretha  recognize  that  the  horror  of  the  Hulks  is

no mere superstitious nonsense. Far from being simple

carvings  from  some  primeval  civilization,  the  Hulks

of  Zoretha  radiate  some  kind  of  nightmare-inducing

power. They are horrifying to all who look upon them,

sometimes to the point of driving even servants of the

gods mad. Those thus af icted are sometimes able to reveal

more information about the Hulks of Zoretha through

their nightmares than history alone could ever disclose.

(DC 37)

A small number of living mortals in the world have seen

the Hulks in person or hold copies of recent accounts of

such visits. These people are either too mad to publish their

experiences or too fearful for the world if the existence of the

Hulks becomes common knowledge. Visitors to the Hulks

of Zoretha attest to the presence of mad cults worshiping

the Hulks as gods. These cults believe that the monoliths

fell from the sky before the dawn of mortals and that they

9/27/07   2:57:36 PM

will one day awaken and purify the world of all sickness and

 lth. (DC 42)

The  cults  that  worship  the  Hulks  compete  over  the

possession  of  the  Zoretha  Scrolls,  originally  penned

millennia ago by a dwarf priest and war-scribe known to

history only as I Weep. Though I Weeps insane ramblings

are difficult to decipher, they indicate that through evalu-

ation of the nightmares of hundreds of different beings,

he was able to discern the Hulks true purpose in this

world: The Hulks are forerunners of alien colonization

from  a  place  called  Zoretha.  If  awakened,  the  Hulks

will begin with the systematic eradication of all life on

the  planet  to  make  room  for  their  own  horrible  alien

offspring, which they will give birth to when the time is

right. (DC 47)

GOALS

The Hulks need some kind of energy infusion to awaken.

For some reason, whatever alien race sent this colonization

unit to the world never saw  t to awaken its representatives.

The Hulks stand conscious but immobile until they can

either make contact with their home realm, wherever that

might be, or inspire mortals to create the circumstances

necessary to bring them to life again. (Knowledge [arcana]

DC 32)

Once awake, the Hulks will seek to purify the world.

Even  among  scholars  and  certainly  among  cultists  of

the  Hulks,  the  meaning  of  this  purification  is  hotly

debated. The purification is necessary to make way for the

Children of Zoretha, the nature of which is also debated.

(DC 37)

In truth, the puri cation intended by the Hulks of Zoretha

is nothing less than the eradication of sapient life in the

world. If awakened, they intend to destroy all beings that

might conceivably one day compete for land or resources

with the Children of Zoretha. (DC 42)

Consisting of four females and one male, the  ve Hulks

of Zoretha will begin to breed and spawn when their puri-

 cation work is done,  lling the world with their own foul

descendants. (DC 47)

THE HULKS OF ZORETHA

IN THE CAMPAIGN

The cults that worship the Hulks of Zoretha have been work-

ing for years to raise their strange stone gods to life. Since

the Five are preparing to  nally awaken, it seems as if they

are about to succeed.

Timeline

A possible campaign arc follows, complete with Encounter

Levels so that you can design adventures for the PCs and

include the various events that must occur to awaken the

Hulks of Zoretha.

EL 5: Soelma Nilaenish hires the PCs to discreetly retrieve

property that was stolen by a rival scholar. The property in

question is a copy of the Zoretha Scrolls (see sidebar), and

Nilaenish is concerned about the manuscript falling into

the wrong hands. Everything seems completely legitimate,

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

THE ZORETHA SCROLLS

Scribed  on  an  unidentifiable  material  that  has  somehow

endured  the  millennia  intact,  the  now-crumbling  Zoretha

Scrolls are not inherently magical, nor do they radiate magic

under the effect of a detect magic spell. The words contained

within  the  scrolls  have  a  magical  effect  that  occurs  when

they are read. The scrolls are written in an archaic dialect of

Dwarven that can be read only by a speaker of Dwarven who

makes a successful DC 35 Knowledge (history) check. Even

then, the insane ramblings cannot be correctly deciphered

without a DC 40 Knowledge (arcana) check. The scrolls dont

need to be understood to take effect; simply reading them

is enough.

Every hour spent reading the Zoretha Scrolls increases the

chance of forming a mystical link between the scrolls and the

nightmare beings that inspired them. The chances per hour are

cumulative.

a reader while awake. This has no effect on spellcasting but

causes Wisdom damage to be cumulative each hour until the

reader stops reading the scrolls.

Only one or two copies (in addition to the original scrolls)

should exist in a given game world, since making a copy requires

a  scribe  to  voluntarily  and  permanently  give  up  her  sanity.

Copies are usually in book form. No written translation has ever

been completed.

Readers who maintain their sanity can learn from the Zoretha

Scrolls. With a successful DC 40 Knowledge (arcana) check, the

first 5 hours of reading reveals all the information contained in

the Background and Goals sections above. Each additional 5

hours (and another check) allows a reader to learn one of the

and Nilaenishs rival is violently insane. The PCs retrieve the

item as requested and return it to the scholars safekeeping.

She promises to lock the book away safely where no one will

ever read it again.

EL 10 (Faint Sign): Tempers are on the rise everywhere

when the PCs old employer, Soelma Nilaenish, contacts

them again. She expects trouble at the building where she

meets with her scholarly society. She fears that someone

wishes  to  break  into  the  societys  artifact  collection,

which  contains  a  copy  of  the  Zoretha  Scrolls.  The  PCs

arrive to find a riot outside the building and must help

authorities to calm or disperse the mob. Nilaenish pays

them handsomely and seems not to fully understand how

or why the riot started. There is no further trouble, but

the society increases magical security on its collection

of artifacts.

Around the same time, the PCs  rst hear rumors of a band

of evil cultists led by a giant called Soulbiter. Soulbiters fol-

lowers have been raiding settlements and causing havoc in

the far north.

EL 15 (Moderate Sign): Distressed by a recent discovery,

Soelma Nilaenish contacts the PCs to act as her bodyguards

on a long journey to the far north. There, she explains, an

evil giant is attempting to awaken an ancient evil that she

associates with the recent violent behavior of the common

people. Near the end of the journey, the PCs encounter

Janwulf the Soulbiter and his followers. Janwulf is familiar

with Nilaenish and acts as if she has betrayed him some-

how. After his defeat at the PCs hands, Nilaenish leads

the party into a death trap, reveals herself to be a powerful

and evil wizard, and leaves with Janwulfs followers in her

service. She also leaves full payment for the PCs services

as a joke.

EL 18 (Strong Sign): After learning where Nilaenish

has gone, the PCs arrive just in time to interrupt her ritual.

Assuming they defeat her, they recover her copy of the

Zoretha Scrolls. Since the Hulks are still quiescent, the PCs

seem to be victorious. A blank page is torn out of the end

of Nilaenishs book, however, and one of Janwulfs more

memorable cultists was not present at Nilaenishs  nal battle

(encounters 41 and 42, pages 58 and 60).

By this point in the campaign, most major nations are at

war with one another. Fighting is constant everywhere the

PCs go.

EL 20 (Overwhelming Sign): Whether or not the PCs

attempt to track down the missing page and cultist, they

arrive back at the Hulks too late to stop the second ritual.

The cultist used the original, crumbling Zoretha Scrolls

and ritual instructions scrawled on a scrap of parchment

from the back of Nilaenishs copy. The Hulks awaken, and

the PCs must  ght all  ve to save the world (encounter 43,

page 62).

THE HULKS OF ZORETHA

IN EBERRON

In Eberron, the Hulks of Zoretha are located somewhere

on the unnamed landmass north of the Bitter Sea. With

the aftermath of the Last War so recent, the violent effect of

the Hulks blood moon might dredge up old con icts more

quickly than might happen in another setting.

In addition, the prevalence of practical magic in Eberron

allows more useful advances than most settings enjoy. The

crudeness and squalor of the Temple of Zoretha is therefore

all the starker to adventurers in Eberron. Not since the

Last War have the PCs seen living conditions so base and

impoverished.

THE HULKS OF ZORETHA

IN FAERN

The Great Glacier is the perfect place for the Hulks of

Zoretha to have lain hidden for thousands of years, and

the dangerous normal inhabitants of the area explain the

natural toughness of the cultists defending it. Carcasses of

slain local creatures, perhaps even that of a young white

dragon, might be an interesting addition to the cultists

food storage area.

Soelma Nilaenish should be considered a moon elf unless

some other race would help her  t into the campaign.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SIGN: BLOOD MOON

The blood moon sets tempers on edge, making people aggres-

sive and angry.

Faint: The starting attitudes of all living, intelligent creatures

and characters are reduced by one step (see Influencing NPC At-

titudes, PH 72). If a creatures attitude drops to hostile, it imme-

diately attacks the closest living creature until it deals damage.

At that point, it reverts to its normal starting attitude.

Moderate: As faint, but starting attitudes drop by two steps.

Strong: As moderate, but living creatures also risk flying

into an uncontrollable fury. Each day when it awakens (or at

the beginning of the day if it does not require sleep), a creature

must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or enter a rage identical

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

to that of the barbarian (PH 25). Unlike a barbarian, a crea-

ture remains in this state until it kills another creature or is

itself killed. At the end of the rage, the creature (if it survives)

is fatigued.

Overwhelming:  As  strong,  but  the  DC  of  the  Will  save  in-

creases to 15. The rage intensifies to an insane frenzy, granting a

+6 bonus to Strength instead of +4 and imposing a 4 penalty to

AC instead of 2; the other effects of a rage remain unchanged.

In  addition,  the  frenzied  creature  can  make  one  extra  attack

when taking a full attack action, and it takes 2 points of nonle-

thal damage each round. At the end of the frenzy, the creature

(if it survives) is exhausted.

DESCRIPTION

When  quiescent,  the  four  female  Hulks  of  Zoretha  look

nearly identical and stand in a circle facing each other. They

resemble stone monoliths over 20 feet in height, blocky but

vaguely humanoid and traced with indecipherable carvings

that occasionally seem to move out of the corner of ones eye.

They do not look female in any mammalian sense and are not

beautiful. One monolith is mottled red and orange; one is

gray stone with pale blue veins; a third is brown with sickly

green blotches; and the fourth female hulk is dark blue with

white veins like crystal.

The male Hulk of Zoretha looks different from the other

four. He still resembles a stone monolith but is slightly

smaller, especially around the base. He is all black, and

his back bulges as if somewhat deformed. Though basi-

cally humanoid, the black Hulk exhibits no mammalian

male traits. He stands just outside the circle of females,

facing out.

When they awaken, the Hulks of Zoretha become slightly

more organic in their overall shape and appearance, but their

tough hides still resemble stone. The carvings that covered

them become tattoos. They remain alien and sexless in overall

appearance.

After the  rst use of any physical attack, a female Hulk

shows signs of her associated energy type. The red and orange

hulk begins to  icker with pale  ames, while the gray and

pale blue hulk is brushed lightly with frost. Foul liquid drips

from the brown and green hulk, and the dark blue and white

hulk crackles slightly with static electricity. Upon awaken-

ing, the male Hulk of Zoretha unfurls large black wings and

reveals a graceful, slightly shadowy form, perfectly molded

to human standards of beauty.

SOELMA NILAENISH

The world disgusts me. People are treacherous, crude, and cruel,

and the natural world is no better. When youre as old as I am, there

really is nothing left to feel but loathing.

Soelma Nilaenish, loremaster

Soelma Nilaenish is an old elf wizard and loremaster. She

is quiet and polite. Her colleagues would describe her as

shy and lonelysome

would  call  her  boring.

Though she is respected

in the scholarly  elds of

history and magic, only

true a cionados of both

subjects  know  of  her.

Several  years  ago,  she

founded  a  society  for

scholars, which became

popular with historians

from all over the world.

She  never  traveled  far

from  home,  and  she

has become increasing-

ly reclusive.

Her  colleagues  say

that Soelma has changed

recently. They are not cer-

tain  what  sparked  the

change, but she has been

more con dent and more

hopeful recently.

GOALS

Soelma  Nilaenish  has

always  been  a  remark-

able  woman,  but  few

outside  the  scholarly

community know her.

She was never beautiful

or  charming  and  never

had  good  friends.  The

maiden aunt who raised

her died when Soelma

was 196 years old, and she has been alone in the world

since then.

Over the years, Soelma became depressive in her outlook

on life and finally arrived at the point where she hates

everything,  herself  most  of  all.  Recently  the  shy,  ever-

unnoticed Soelma decided she would like the world to

pay attention to her before she leaves it. To that end, she

painstakingly researched the perfect way to end it all. She

looks forward to the cessation of all life in the world with

relief and hope, and devotes every moment toward achieving

her dream.

USING SOELMA NILAENISH

Soelma begins the campaign as an occasional employer

of the PCs. She pays them well and on time, always gives

them  accurate  information,  and  offers  useful  advice.

Though  never  friendly,  she  is  also  never  rude.  Soelma

is  wealthy  and  uses  money  instead  of  diplomacy  when

she can.

The  PCs  should  occasionally  receive  hints  about  the

depths of Soelmas depression, and this should become

a more frequent occurrence as the campaign progresses.

When she decides the time is right to voyage to the Hulks

in person, her demeanor

changes  from  passivity

to one of taut excitement

and  hope.  PCs  might  be

led to believe that the pros-

pect  of  saving  the  world

from evil, which she states

as  her  goal  on  the  jour-

ney,  has   lled  her  with

a  newfound  purpose  in

life. Since Soelma by this

point is insane enough to

genuinely  believe  that

her actions will make the

world  a  better  place,  her

behavior  involves  little

deception.

Once Nilaenish has used

the PCs to help her defeat

Janwulf, her chief rival for

control of the Hulks cult-

ists, she betrays them in a

manner that she has been

preparing since she first

met  the  characters,  and

then  she  leaves  them  to

die.  When  the  PCs  meet

her again, all traces of shy-

ness  and  sanity  are  gone.

She behaves like a religious

fanatic,  still  genuinely

believing  that  she  is  de-

stroying  the  world  for  its

own good.

DESCRIPTION

Mousy and plump for an elf, Soelma Nilaenish could best be

described as plain. She is short for her race but not remark-

ably so, and her dishwater hair and small brown eyes hint

of human blood at some point in her ancestry, despite her

otherwise el ike features. Intelligent and bookish, Soelma

never had much interest in anything outside her scholarly

pursuits. She dresses in plain clothing without adornments

and even designs her own magic items to be plain. She keeps

her hair cut short for easy care.

Soelmas shyness makes her very dif cult to read. She puts

great effort into seeming emotionless and polite, but the

hate inside her has been building for so long that nothing

can heal her wounds. She seems sane and logical, but she is

quite mad underneath.

JANWULF THE SOULBITER

The world is impure. Join me, and together we shall lead the

righteous into a new era of purity!

Janwulf the Soulbiter

For the  rst time, all the cults of Zoretha are united as one

and functioning coherently toward a common purpose. This

unity is due to the cunning leadership of a frost giant known

as Janwulf the Soulbiter. Janwulf (who invented his moniker

himself) rules the cultists with an iron  st, leading them

on raids of surrounding settlements and actively recruiting

new members.

GOALS

Janwulf has no desire to destroy the world, nor any real

intention to awaken the Hulks. His worshipful speech and

behavior is a ruse to get him what he really wantsmore

power. Indeed, Janwulf believes that a hopeless religion

constructed around the worship of a false god is perfect for

amassing  a  multitude  of  blindly  loyal  followers  to  do  his

bidding. Ideally, he hopes to start his own empire.

USING JANWULF

Janwulf should appear to be utterly devoted to the Hulks of

Zoretha. However, since all he is really doing is manipulating

cultists to his will, he rarely takes actual steps toward waking

the Hulks. Janwulf is wary of Soelma Nilaenish when she

approaches him about her plans. He will never work to help

her, and she knows it.

Janwulf uses his bard spells, fake magic jewelry, and pipes

of sounding to mimic divine spellcasting and communication

with the Hulks. He prefers to conquer through intimidation

rather than actual combat.

DESCRIPTION

Handsome and charming for a frost giant, Janwulf has

always been a good speaker and an ambitious dreamer.

Something of a bully and braggart as well, Janwulf has

proven himself to be a persuasive leader with a talent for

self-promotion.

Knowing that he would never have the combat ability

necessary to rule other frost giants, the undaunted Janwulf

simply moved on to smaller folk until he came across the

cultists of Zoretha. A combination of charm and intimidation

managed to convince them that he was chosen by the Hulks

to lead the world into the next age.

Janwulf is civilized and well dressed as frost giants go.

He keeps himself clean and groomed, and he has a great

appreciation for civilized luxury of all kinds.

THE TEMPLE

OF ZORETHA

The Hulks of Zoretha have no true temple, but the

 ve of them have stood in one place for thousands

upon thousands of years. In this location, cultists

have carved out a lair that they call the Temple

of Zoretha.

The  rock  and  ice  of  this  temple  have  been

hollowed out by hand to form a vast cavern with a

permanent roof of ice hundreds of feet thick and

a  warren  of  tunnels  and  chambers  leading  off  it.

Cultists make their homes, such as they are, in these

smaller chambers. Fire pits with crude chimneys

cut into the rock allow cultists to keep themselves

warm despite the year-round freezing temperatures.

A nearby coal deposit provides fuel in the treeless

wasteland they inhabit.

All life in the temple centers around the great

cavern where the uncaring monoliths have stood

since far past the reach of mortal memory. Vast,

echoing, and largely empty, the cavern nevertheless

swarms with indistinct whispers and eerie shadows.

During the day, sunlight  lters thinly through the

frozen roof, casting strange ripples and prisms of dim light.

At night, torchlight glimmers against the ice ceiling, and

the weird markings on the Hulks bodies produce a shim-

mering effect.

KEY FEATURES

Mad cultists with little knowledge of architecture designed

the temple of Zoretha. It was intended to be a cathedral and

resting place grand enough for gods. What is most remarkable

is how well the cultists succeeded at their goal, for the main

cavern of the temple is nothing if not awesome.

At its highest point, right above the Hulks, the ceiling of

the cavern is 150 feet in height, and a roughly 90-foot-radius

circle of it is ice. Large  res are never burned in the great

cavern, so it is always very cold there.

The ice ceiling allows for illumination throughout the

chamber during daylight hours, though the light is blue

and the room is lit no better than it would be with candles

and  torches.  The  cultists  leave  the  place  dark  at  night,

except when they perform rituals. During rituals they use

torches and  re pits similar to those in the cultists sleeping

quarters. Any light causes strange shimmers and tricks of

the eye.

Other ceilings in the temple complex are stone, and most

are 20 feet tall or lower. Some are as small as 5 feet tall. The

exception to this is the main entry hall, which at 40 feet in

height is designed to be a comfortable space for the 20-foot-

tall monoliths once they awaken. All light outside the main

cavern comes from  re pits left burning for warmth.

DEFENSES

The Temple of Zoretha is well defended by the cultists who

live there. Even when the majority are out raiding or hunting,

a substantial guard is left behind to defend their gods resting

place.  Surviving  the  harsh  climate  and  the  cults  internal

squabbles  make  cultists  tougher  and  better   ghters  than

average folk. Defenders of less than CR 5 are rare.

After the main gate, the next line of defense is the great

hall itself. Intruders are ambushed upon entry if possible.

Cultists  know  that  their  monoliths  are  invulnerable,  and

those retaining the slightest shred of sanity do not defend

the main cavern to the death.

The twists and turns of the smaller chambers and tunnels

provide useful ambush spots or defensible last stands. If faced

with particularly powerful intruders, the strongest Medium

and Small warriors have instructions to defend the library,

which can be accessed only by Medium or smaller creatures.

Defenders of the library  ght to their last breath.

Once the Hulks blood moon sign reaches the strong or

overwhelming stage, cultists of Zoretha can voluntarily enter

a rage as noted in the sidebar on page 50.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

A. The Entrance Tunnel (EL 12 +)

Set into an icy cliff face, this enormous tunnel is obscured by

huge, fanglike icicles and large piles of packed snow (Spot DC

20 to notice the entrance before entering bowshot range). The

entrance tunnel is guarded by ten to twelve cultists who gain

cover from the ice and snow in the opening. Guards attack

anyone they do not know as soon as they are in range. There

is no password, and they cannot be reasoned with or bribed.

Encounter  41,  page  58,  provides  an  example  of  entrance

guards who are prepared for powerful opponents.

B. The Cavern (EL varies)

Any cultists in the cavern attack intruders on sight. In

combat, keep in mind the huge scale of the room. Most

Medium  cultists  worshiping  among  the  monoliths,  for

example, need at least 2 rounds to reach melee  ghting range

of the entrance. All ranged  ghters should have little trouble

 nding cover among the support pillars along the edge of

the hall or behind the monoliths themselves. If a leader is

present, cultists attempt to surround and trap intruders in

the central area, so that they can be picked off by archers.

Encounter 42, page 60, portrays the  nal  ght with Soelma

Nilaenish and the cultists in this area.

C. Ambush Spot (EL varies)

This alcove just inside the main entrance makes a perfect

ambush  spot  to  surprise  those  coming  up  the  entrance

tunnel. Stone formations and a well-placed support pillar

grant anyone crouching here a +5 bonus on Hide checks

in all but full daylight. If cultists are prepared for the PCs

arrival, four to  ve Medium cultists are hidden here when

the PCs enter. Once the male Hulk awakens, he uses this

ambush spot if given an opportunity to do so.

D. Janwulfs Home (EL 10)

The back half of this smaller room has been turned into a tidy

and comfortable personal quarters for a Large-size creature,

with a magically everburning  replace, piles of cured animal

hide blankets forming a bed, a well-made wooden writing

desk and chair, neatly organized shelves, and a large chest.

Janwulfs wealth and remaining possessions can be found in

this chamber. Janwulf used every magic trap he was able to

pay for to keep intruders from ri ing through his things, and

the spells are still in place. Use high-CR touch or proximity

magic traps for the doorway, shelves, chest, and a secret panel

in the chest.

Treasure in the room includes four silk tapestries on the

walls that depict scenes of violent horror (1,000 gp each), a

large crystal wine glass with an ornate gold base (3,000 gp),

a silver ice bucket for chilling wine (2,000 gp), candlesticks

(100 gp each),  ne fabric on the mantelpiece (300 gp), and furs

on the bed (350 gp total). The large desk and chair are made

of darkwood and worth 500 gp each. The shelves (carved

into the wall) contain only the works of a frost giant poet,

worth 500 gp if the party can  nd a collector of depressing

love poetry written in Giant.

The chest holds 4,000 gp and 500 pp. The chest is embroi-

dered on the inside with nine bloodstones worth 50 gp each

adorning a velvet cloth (worth 300 gp). If the PCs remove the

velvet lining they  nd a secret panel and a tiny compartment

holding  ve gemstones, each worth 1,000 gp: one diamond,

one ruby, one topaz, one sapphire, and one black pearl.

E. Small Sleeping Area (EL varies)

Some Small and Medium cultists sleep here. The area is  lthy

and smells of unwashed bodies. Any cultists hiding here will

probably be terri ed of the characters, but being crazy and

trapped, they still attempt to  ght their way out.

F. Large Sleeping Area

(EL varies)

Much like area J, this room is  lthy

and  smelly,  full  of  poorly  tanned

animal  hides  and  little  else.  A  few

starved  and  sickly  noncombatant

cultists lie in the  lth.

A second tunnel leads to area L, but

it is small and dif cult to notice in

the shadows. Unless someone fully

enters the chamber, it cannot be seen

at all. If the PCs enter the room but

choose not to search it, have them

make a DC 20 Spot check to see the

second tunnel. The Search DC to  nd

the tunnel is 15.

G. Library (EL varies)

Here the cultists keep their stash of

manuscripts  referencing  the  Hulks

of Zoretha as well as any other texts

the  cultists  have  decided  allude  to

the  Hulks.  The  original  Zoretha

Scrolls are not present. Other books

and scrolls here include fairy tales

and  fiction,  a vacuous  grimoire,  and

divine scrolls of lesser animate dead,

unholy aura, unhallow, and wail of the

banshee.  Several  cultists  (minimum

CR 8 each) make a stand here. They

 ght to the death to protect their pre-

cious books.

H1. Fire Hulk

Before awakening, the red and orange

mottled  re Hulk stands here, facing

the acid Hulk.

H2. Ice Hulk

The  quiescent  gray  ice  Hulk  stands

here, facing the lightning hulk. Pale

blue lines that look like veins in the

stone  monolith  glimmer  wetly  in

torchlight.

H3. Acid Hulk

Until the Hulks are raised, the brown acid Hulk stands here,

splotched randomly with sickly green patches that resemble

lichen. The acid Hulk faces the  re hulk.

H4. Lightning Hulk

Before awakening, the dark blue lightning Hulk stands

here, facing the ice Hulk. Torchlight sparkles brightly in

the white crystal lines that run through the apparently

stone Hulk.

H5. Male Hulk

The fifth Hulk stands here, facing the entrance. Though

he is made of a black stonelike substance, his eyes follow

observers.

I. Ritual Room

The cultists keep their pseudo-religious paraphernalia here,

including costumes and props for bizarre rites; many of the

items are blood-soaked, and nearly all are poorly made. A

few minor magic items are scattered in the mix, such as a

+1 wounding dagger that has obviously been used for blood

sacri ces, an eversmoking bottle, and a  ask of sovereign glue.

The cult leaders keep the best acquisitions for themselves.

J. Storage

The three smaller back chambers of the ritual room serve

the cultists as storage areas. They keep food in one area,

torches, fuel, and other supplies in a second, and weapons

and armor in the third. All of it is filthy, mundane, and

poorly organized.

Encounter Level 16

SETUP

The encounter begins either when the characters make

their Spot checks to notice the defenders hiding among

the snow slopes or immediately following the archers sur-

prise round. Place the wat trolls (T), ogre tempests (O), and

whitespawn berserkers (W) as the PCs notice them.

When a character gets a clear line of sight to the

defenders, read:

Facing you in battle is a strange assortment of

cultists: vicious-looking trolls wearing armor and

using weapons, several particularly well-armed

ogres, and some white-scaled humanoids with

reptilian faces. Some appear to have succumbed to

the blood moon rage.

the stump.

When the characters   rst see the entryway, read:

The cave is hidden against the icy cliff face by piles

of snow and huge icicles that hang down from its

roof like teeth. Movement behind the icicles and

snow shows the presence of defenders.

When a character comes within 20 feet of the entrance,

read:

A patch of ice gleams on the ground between you

and the defenders. It appears very slick.

TACTICS

In the  rst round, the guards at the gate sound the alarm to

the rest of the temple, then do their best to pick off the PCs

with ranged attacks while they retain their cover behind

the snow and icicles. They will not be drawn out of their

tunnel. The creatures outside the tunnel keep the PCs from

advancing quickly to allow their allies to  re.

Since  the  guards  sounded  the  alarm  during  the   rst

rounds, the longer this  ght takes, the better prepared the

cultists  are  when  the  PCs   nally  enter  the  main  cavern.

After the  fth round, consider one main cavern cultist per

round to have taken 20 on Hide and Move Silently checks

to ambush the PCs.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Ice Slick: A flat patch of very slick ice lies in front of the

entrance, extending outward 10 feet from the northern snow

pile. All movement costs are doubled while traversing the ice

slick, and crossing requires a DC 25 Balance check to keep

from falling prone, once every 10 feet.

Snow Piles: Steep slopes of packed snow lead up to the

entrance. The slope and the unsure footing of the deep snow

make movement very slow over the snow piles (movement

costs are tripled). In addition, a creature attacking a target

on an ice slope from a higher tier gets a +1 bonus for being

on higher ground.

Icicles: As well as providing cover for the trolls, the icicles

at the tunnel mouth act as a barricade against intruders. A DC

20 Spot check reveals an easy path through the hanging icicles,

along the eastern side of the entrance. Any Medium or Large

creature trying to take any other path must take a full-round

action to do so and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC during

this round.

CONCLUSION

The last guards fall back into the main cavern rather than

die where they stand. These guards run through the cavern,

hoping the PCs will follow and be surrounded on all sides

by the community.

SETUP

The  creatures  present  here  include  skindancers  (S),

greathorn  minotaurs  (M),  and  a  cave  troll  (T).  Many  of

them  hide  in  the  ambush  spot  and  behind  support  pil-

lars. Soelma Nilaenish (SN) stands at the Hulks feet and

doesnt stop her ritual after combat begins.

When the PCs enter the cavern, read:

The cavern stretches before you, illuminated only

by light from a domed roof of thick ice. Five

monoliths stand in the center of the cavern. The

Hulks are motionless, but as your eyes adjust you

see creatures in the shadows and Soelma Nilaenish

leading a ritual at the monoliths feet.

charged by a hulking, troll-like creature with claws

and a rubbery hide. More than half a dozen

stone, dirt, or any other sort of earth except metal as

easily as a fish swims though water. Its burrowing leaves

behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or

other signs of its presence.

Earth Warp (Su) As a swift action, a greathorn minotaur can

cause the earth and rock around it to twist and warp in a

60-foot-radius emanation, doubling movement costs

through that area. Natural stone, finished stone, and dirt

surfaces are subject to this effect. The effect does not

move with the minotaur; when the minotaur leaves the

area, the ground returns to normal. A minotaur ignores

the movement penalties generated by its own or another

greathorns earth warp ability.

Natural Cunning (Ex) Greathorn minotaurs have immunity to

maze spells, never become lost, and can track enemies.

They are never caught flat-footed.

TACTICS

As the characters make their presence known, Soelma Nilae-

nish sends a few particular combatants to keep the party

busy while she  nishes her ritual.

The  cave  troll  and  the  skindancers  charge  to  attack  as

quickly as they can, while the greathorn minotaurs use their

earth glide ability to circle behind the characters and sur-

round them. Once the PCs are surrounded, the creatures try

to herd them farther into the cavern, thus exposing them to

more ranged attacks.

Obedient to Nilaenishs instructions, the creatures try to

keep the PCs together in a group and away from the ritual if

they possibly can. Nilaenish herself, even if attacked at range,

does not join in the  ght until her ritual is interrupted. She

has cast several defensive spells on herself, however.

Once joined in the battle, Soelma attempts to stay out of

melee with the PCs, taking cover behind a monolith and cast-

ing spells to support her allies. When she runs out of spells,

Soelmawho  is  by  now  completely  insanevoluntarily

goes into a blood moon rage and  ghts to the death in melee

with her rapier.

If the PCs do not stop Soelma Nilaenishs ritual after 10

rounds of  ghting, the Hulks awaken. However, if a PC

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Ambush Spot: Just to the left of the PCs as they enter the

cavern is a perfect ambush spot. This alcove is not in line of

sight to those coming up the entrance tunnel until they have

fully entered the cavern by at least 10 feet. Stone formations

and support pillars grant anyone crouching here a +5 bonus

on Hide checks in all but full daylight.

The  Hulks  of  Zoretha  serve  as  little  more  than  terrain

features during this battle. Keep in mind that since they are

not really stone, the earth glide ability of the greathorn mino-

taurs does not work for passing through them.

Support Columns: The columns around the outer edge of

the cavern are wide enough to provide cover for creatures of

Medium size or smaller.

Low Ceiling: Though 150 feet tall at its highest, the ceiling

in the great cavern arches down to 20 feet tall at the walls,

which is slightly shorter than the Hulks themselves. They will

not enter the low-ceiling area indicated on the map unless they

need to fight the PCs. The low ceilings in that area give them

a 1 distraction penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class.

attacks Soelma in melee or otherwise disturbs her ritual

before a minute has passed, she angrily devotes her full

energy to the battle. When Soelma falls, the remaining crea-

tures  ee into other parts of the temple.

CONCLUSION

Even after Soelma is defeated, the battle is won, and the

temple  is  cleared  of  cultists,  the  blood  moon  effect  does

not diminish. There appears to be no further danger at

the temple.

TACTICS

The Hulks of Zoretha are aware of the PCs approach no

matter how stealthy they are. The black Hulk has circled

around to the ambush spot, hoping to use his sneak attack.

The other Hulks spread out to surround the party and to

avoid being caught in area spells. The black Hulk speci -

cally targets spellcasters.

All five Hulks use their summon powers before the

combat is engaged (see pages 6667 and 95101 of the

Monster Manual). The summoned creatures attempt to keep

the PCs together so the female Hulks can make better use

of their breath weapons.

The  ve Hulks are mates and breeding partners. They

become angry if one of the females is killed, and all the

Summon Elemental (Sp) A female Hulk of Zoretha can

summon elementals once per dayone elder, two

greater, or four Huge. The elementals arrive in 1d4

rounds and serve for 1 day or until released. The fire

hulk summons fire elementals; the ice hulk summons

water elementals; the acid hulk summons earth

elementals; and the lightning hulk summons air

elementals. All hulks summon chaotic evil elementals.

Waking Nightmare (Su) The female Hulks of Zoretha are

so horrifying that they induce waking nightmares in

their opponents. Three times per day as a swift action,

a Hulk can induce waking nightmares in all opponents

within a 5-foot radius. Opponents thus affected must

make a DC 22 Will save or be subjected to the following

effects for 1d6 rounds as they are immersed in a

waking dream.

100 miles of the Hulks must succeed on a DC 18 Will

save or take 1d4+1 points of Wisdom damage and be

fatigued for the day. The spellcaster additionally cannot

regain spells, power points, or any similar ability that

requires rest. A spellcaster who is reduced to half normal

Wisdom is affected by insanity while within this area.

Spikes (Ex) The male Hulk of Zoretha can shoot up to four

poisoned spikes per round from his forearms as a ranged

weapon with a range increment of 100 feet. Spikes

regenerate immediately after use.

Hypnotic Gaze (Su) The male Hulk of Zoretha can hypnotize

foes into helplessness. Five times per day as a swift

action, the Hulk can force a target opponent to make a

DC 22 Will save or lose all sensory and time perception

until the end of the Hulks action. On a failed Will save,

the target loses her Dex and shield bonus to AC, is

treated as if blinded, and is held immobile until the Hulk

finishes his action for the round.

Summon Displacer Beast (Su) The male Hulk of Zoretha

can summon a displacer beast pack lord once per day.

The displacer beast pack lord summoned is chaotic evil.

It arrives in 1d4 rounds and serves for 1 day or until

released.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) The male Hulk of Zoretha is

immune to all divine divination spell effects.

Dark Visiting (Su) Any divine spellcaster who sleeps within

100 miles of the male Hulk must succeed on a DC 25 Will

save or take 1d4+1 points of Wisdom damage and be

fatigued for the day. The spellcaster additionally cannot

regain spells, power points, or any similar ability that

requires rest. A spellcaster who is reduced to half normal

Wisdom is affected by insanity while within this area.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

Quiescent Invulnerability (Su) When dormant, a Hulk of

Zoretha cannot be harmed by any means. Once awakened,

Hulks of Zoretha cannot become dormant again.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Ambush Spot: See encounter 32 on the previous pages.

The male Hulk hides here to await the PCs as they enter.

Low Ceiling: Though 150 feet tall at its highest, the ceiling

in the great cavern arches down to 20 feet tall at the walls, which

is slightly shorter than the Hulks themselves. They will not

enter the low-ceiling area indicated on the map unless they need

to fight the PCs. The low ceilings in that area give them a 1

distraction penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class.

Support Columns: Support columns have hardness 8 and

15 hit points per inch of thickness (on average 40 inches in

diameter and 600 hp). A support column provides cover.

females are extremely protective of the male, since he is irre-

placeable. Considering its fast healing, a Hulk should not be

considered out of action until it is reduced to less than 10

hit points.

CONCLUSION

The moment the PCs kill the last Hulk of Zoretha, all  ve

bodies begin to crumble into ash, and the PCs immediately

feel the effect of the blood moon dissipating. The passing of

so great an evil causes the earth to shudder in relief, how-

ever, and the resulting earthquake causes the collapse of

the cavern. PCs should not have much trouble escaping the

Temple of Zoretha unharmed, but if they have not yet looted

the place, it is now too late to do so. Just as they escape, it col-

lapses completely into rubble with half a crumbled mountain

on top of it. The Hulks of Zoretha and their temple are buried

as if they had never been.

read Leviathan, who spawned monster serpents,

Sharp of tooth and merciless of fang,

Their bodies  lled with poison instead of blood.

Fierce beasts of land and sea who wore their glory

like gods, all bedecked in splendor.

Terror overcame whoever beheld Leviathan,

From its dread body sprang vipers and dragons,

And hurricanes, and mighty tempests,

And fearsome shaking of the earth,

And  such  abominations  as  even  the  gods  could  not

comprehend.

So did the world shudder at the stirring of Leviathan.

Gods grant that it lie in peace in the depths for all eternity.

An ancient tablet carved in Draconic,

origin unknown

Spawned by the raw and undiluted chaos of creation,

the world-spanning creature called the Leviathan

slumbers deep beneath the waves, its dreams and

stirrings producing monsters and disaster in the

world above. Few on the surface are aware of the

terrible threat that the Leviathan represents, but in

the depths of the ocean, a creature of unspeakable

evil seeks to use the mighty creature for his own

nefarious purposes.

BACKGROUND

Most  legends  depict  the  creation  of  the  universe  as  an

ordered, methodical process carried out by the gods. Only

a few myths describe the dif culties and obstacles that the

gods encountered. A handful of legends told by the oldest

elementals and dragons spin a different tale, however. These

stories are all but forgotten today.

When the gods created the worlds and the various planes

of existence, they did so by manipulating law and chaos,

adding one to the other, subtracting, combining, subdivid-

ing. Each world is a precise mixture of the two, with order

providing stability and chaos producing change. Inevitably,

one force or the other falls out of balance and must in some

fashion be restricted or controlled. The beast called the

Leviathan is nothing less than the raw chaos resulting from

the creation of the world, given  esh and form. (Knowledge

[religion] DC 34)

Balance must be maintained in the universe, with law

weighed against chaos. When worlds are created, however,

these  forces  become  unbalancedgenerating  leftovers

from the process of creation, nearly always an excess of chaos.

A chaotic imbalance can result in the creation of creatures

that are almost pure chaos, existing only to bring about

change and move their surroundings toward disorder. The

Leviathan is one such entity. (DC 37)

These chaos-entities can be forced into prison demiplanes

or eternal slumber where they stir restlessly and dream,

eventually disappearing as their energies slowly drain away.

9/27/07   3:04:41 PM

9/27/07   3:04:41 PM

When awakened, however, an elder chaos-thing such as the

Leviathan is driven to reduce all it encounters to ruin and

nothingness. (DC 40)

The Leviathan slumbers in the depths of the oceans. It is

huge enough to encircle the entire world. Its chaos energy

seeps out as it sleeps, and its dreams create monsters of the

land and aberrant sea life. Its restless motions manifest

in  the  form  of  hurricanes,  tsunamis,  earthquakes,  and

volcanoes.  Eventually  the  Leviathans  essential  chaotic

energy will all bleed away and it will fade into nothing-

ness, but this might take longer than the life span of the

world. (DC 43)

The Leviathans awakening is foretold in ancient dragon

legendswarning that if the great beast is roused to even

semi awareness, the world will be shattered and remade.

If  brought  fully  awake,  the  Leviathan  will  destroy  the

world, and in doing so destroy itself. Such is the nature

of the Leviathan, among the eldest of the beasts of chaos.

(DC 45)

and producing deadly creatures. When it wakes the oceans

boil and rage, whole continents slide into the abyssal deeps,

and the entire world shudders. Once the Leviathan fully

awakens, nothing short of concerted divine intervention

can  save  the  world  from  utter  destruction.  (Knowledge

[religion] DC 32)

The Leviathan is essentially mindless, and the destruc-

tion that it wreaks is simply the consequence of its fully

wakened state. Legends told by the elder wyrms suggest

that the Leviathan has approached consciousness on several

occasions in the distant past, and this resulted in the various

disasters that remade and changed the world. The fact that

the world remains intact is proof that the creature returned

to its slumbers. (DC 37)

Depraved individuals might be willing to take the risk of

utter destruction to use the sleeping Leviathan as a tool to

achieve their wicked endsthe destruction of an enemy

kingdom, the ruin of a continent for resources, or the reshap-

ing of the entire world. (DC 42)

GOALS

The Leviathans only real goalif it can even be said to

have oneis to act in accordance with its nature. Given

its  creation  and  composition,  the  Leviathans  nature  is

simply chaos in its most destructive form. As it approaches

wakefulness, the Leviathans unconscious movements grow

more frequent and violent, creating devastating catastrophes

THE LEVIATHAN

IN THE CAMPAIGN

Everyone has heard legends about the Leviathan, ranging

from wild sailors tales of giant  sh or whales to scholars

suggestions that the Leviathan is a real creature that has yet

to be discovered. Few tales hint at the Leviathans true power,

and most of these are buried in the obscure dragon legends.

SIGN: EERIE WEATHER

The impending awakening of the Leviathan is heralded by ab-

normal weather that becomes more and more widespread as

the sign becomes stronger.

Faint: Eerie weather occurs once every 2 weeks and affects

an area of 2d20 square miles in a place of your choosing. The

effects last for 1d4+1 hours.

Moderate: Eerie weather occurs once a week and affects an

area of 2d% square miles. The effects last for 1d8+2 hours.

Strong: Eerie weather occurs once a day and affects an entire

continent  or  large  surface  of  the  planet.  The  effects  last  for

1d12+4 hours.

Overwhelming: Eerie weather occurs once an hour and af-

fects the entire world. The effects last for 1d3 hours (because

the  duration  can  be  longer  than  the  frequency,  the  effects

often overlap).

Each time eerie weather occurs, consult the following table

fragments, creating dif cult terrain (PH 148).

Most scholars consider the Leviathan to be little more than

an entertaining myth.

Timeline

Unfortunately for your characters and for the world, enemies

of civilization are conspiring to use the Leviathan for their

own fell purposes. Following is a suggested outline of a

campaign involving the Leviathan and those who seek to

awaken it.

EL 5: A coastal region that includes a major port city is

experiencing earth tremors and wild weather conditions.

Movement into and out of the city is seriously impeded,

and many believe the freak weather conditions to be the

work of evil magic or angry deities. A few madmen or

old sailors insist that the Leviathan is stirring, but they

are ignored.

The characters distinguish themselves by helping the

city survive a great tsunami or similar extreme weather

event. They attract the notice of the citys leaders, who

ask  them  for  help  in  seeking  the  source  of  the  strange

weather conditions.

EL 10 (Faint Sign): As tales of natural disasters in other

parts of the world begin to spread, rumors abound that a

Cult of the Leviathan is behind the disruptions. The PCs

are asked to investigate.

The characters follow a suspected cult member to a ritual

that is taking place on a windswept rocky isle a mile or so off

the coast, where they see High Priest Enshaddon (actually

Axihuatl the ixitxachitl priest in human guise) leading the

worship of the Leviathan by summoning aberrations and sea

monsters to ravage the city. The party must stop the cultists

and  any  creatures  they  have  summoned,  but  Enshaddon

escapes in the confusion, diving back into the sea to keep

his real identity secret.

Knowing that the PCs now represent a threat to his plans,

Axihuatl directs Marcus Hape to stop them. Hape and his

thugs harry the party for the next several adventures.

EL 15 (Moderate Sign): The sage Mytus contacts the

PCs with alarming news. Although most scholars believe

the Leviathan to be nothing more than a myth, Mytus tells

the PCs that he has translated ancient documents and tablets

that prove that the Leviathan is a real creature, and that the

cultists seek to awaken it. He appeals to the characters to

help prove his theories.

Mytus has access to water-breathing spells and an amazing

dwarf-crafted diving machine that allows him to plumb the

sea chasm nearby, where he will try to view at least a portion

of the Leviathan.

The  PCs  accompany  Mytus  on  his  expedition  and

encounter  various  undersea  perils,  including  aspects

of the great beast that now glide through the depths of

the  ocean.  Eventually,  the  party  encounters  a  massive

underwater mountain and discovers that it is a portion

of  the  head  of  the  sleeping  Leviathan.  When  the  beast

stirs, the adventurers ship is destroyed. The sages magic

allows  Mytus  and  the  PCs  to  escape  and  make  for  the

surface,  pursued  by  Axihuatls  minions  and  by  aspects

of the Leviathan.

EL 17 (Strong Sign): Captured cultists tell of a  nal ritual

in which High Priest Enshaddon intends to awaken the

Leviathan. The ritual is to take place in a temple located inside

one of the great hollow spines that rise from the Leviathans

back. The adventurers must make their way into the sea once

more and confront the cultists.

Once at the place of the ritual, the characters attempt to

stop  Enshaddon,  but  their  intervention  causes  the  ritual

to go terribly wrongthe Leviathan stirs, and the temple

begins to  ood. As the cultists drown, the party sees Enshad-

don change to his true form, an enormous ixitxachitl. The

PCs are swept away from the raging Axihuatl when a wall

of the temple collapses and a massive tidal wave created by

the Leviathans awakening separates them (encounter 51,

page 74).

EL 20 (Overwhelming Sign): The climax of the campaign

begins with the PCs back on land, washed up amid the ruin of

civilization. Entire cities have been sunk, islands destroyed,

mountains collapsedand the Leviathan is only now stirring

to full wakefulness.

As the PCs debate what to do, Axihuatl appears in human

form.  The  Leviathan  now  threatens  to  destroy  the  entire

world, and even the evil ixitxachitl doesnt wish to see that

happen. He offers to teach the PCs how to put the Leviathan

back to sleep. Since he is the one who awakened the Levia-

than, he says, another must put it back to sleep, and the party

is the only group that can be trusted. Axihuatl says that once

it is returned to slumber, the Leviathan cannot be awakened

again for a thousand years.

Axihuatl might even be willing to accompany the party,

though given his nature this might not be the best alterna-

tive. The PCs must find the Leviathan, enter the temple,

and make their way to the lowest level, where they can

dispose of the Abyssal Shard (encounters 52 and 53, pages

76 and 78).

If the party succeeds, the Leviathan goes back to sleep.

Though  seriously  damaged  by  the  Leviathans  movement,

the world survives. Your can end the campaign here, restart

in a new, remade world as civilization struggles to rebuild, or

move time forward a century or two and set a new campaign

in the rebuilt world.

THE LEVIATHAN IN EBERRON

The  Leviathan  has  exerted  its  in uence  on  the  world  of

Eberron since the Age of Dragons. Some very old draconic

legends suggest that the progenitor wyrms used the power of

the Leviathan against each other and in so doing shattered the

world, leaving the broken remains to the hags and rakshasas

of the Age of Demons.

Dragon lore further implies that other disasters might be

attributed to Leviathans restless slumber. Myths about the

Leviathan are told throughout the Lhazaar Provinces, but

no one truly believes that it exists. The Shadow Network

has begun to hear rumors about a cult that worships the

true  Leviathan  and  is  eager  to  learn  more  about  this

potential foe.

The Spine Temple rises from the sea after a ferocious

storm, about 20 miles northeast of Regalport. Mariners

report the strange object, but most are reluctant to sail

close  to  it.  The  Lhazaarite  authorities  would  like  to

investigate, but they have their hands full with the severe

weather conditions.

THE LEVIATHAN

IN FAERN

The  Leviathan  has   existed

in  legend  for  millennia  in

Faern, though most  consider

stories  about  it  to  be  myths

or  exaggerated   accounts  of

an  existing  creature,  such  as

the  great  whales  or  the  rare

creature  also  known  as  the

leviathan. In reality, the true

Leviathan slumbers beneath

the  waves.  Its  great  head,

where  Axihuatl intends to carry

out his plans, lies a few leagues

from  the  great   metropolis

of  Waterdeep.  As  weather

conditions  along  the  Sword

Coast  worsen,  the    scholars

of  Candlekeep   investigate

and discover unsettling tales

of  the   Leviathans  existence.

They alert the Harpers, who

take an  immediate interest in

the situation.

Some  very  old  Elven

legends  tell  of  a  great  spire

that  rises  unexpectedly from

the sea, especially after major

disasters.  Some   Candlekeep

scholars believe that it might be

associated with the  Leviathan,

but  references  are  scarce.  In

this case, the spine rises from

the  sea  after  a  huge  storm

about  50  miles  southwest  of

Waterdeep,  between  the  city

and the  Korinn  Archipelago,

threatening the Moonshaes as

well as the Sword Coast.

DESCRIPTION

The Leviathan is an impossibly large sea serpent, somewhat

reptilian and primitive in appearance. Its vast head alone is

the size of a small kingdom.

So enormous is the Leviathan that in many places its body

has become part of the landscape. Seamounts and  ssures,

islands and dormant volcanoescovered in vegetation and

indistinguishable from surrounding terrainall make up

part of the great beast.

A complex interplay of thoughts and emotions fuels the

Leviathans wild dreams, its restless stirring, and its destruc-

tive thrashing and rampaging. Its chaotic mind and soul yearn

only to unmake that which the gods made and, in doing so,

to unmake itself.

Aspect of Leviathan

The Leviathan itself is so huge that normal statistics are

meaningless, and it is impossible for anything short of a gods

avatar to effectively  ght it directly. The most that mortals

can hope to do is send it back to sleep if it awakens.

Creatures  created  by  the  Leviathans  dreams  manifest

on both land and at sea and take the form of aberrations or

aquatic creatures such as megalodons and sea serpents. The

most deadly of the Leviathans manifestations are miniature

versions of itself. These aspects of the Leviathan become more

common as the beast approaches wakefulness.

The swallowed creature takes 3d8+10 points of

bludgeoning damage and 2d8+4 points of acid damage

per round from the aspects gizzard. A swallowed crea-

ture can cut its way out by using a light slashing or pierc-

ing weapon to deal 42 points of damage to the gizzard

(AC 22). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes

the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own

2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or

smaller opponents.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, an aspect of the Levia-

than must hit an opponent of up to Gargantuan size with

a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try

to swallow the opponent in the following round.

Skills An aspect of the Leviathan has a +8 racial bonus

on any Swim check to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use

the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) The Leviathan is immune to all

divine divination spell effects.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

True Death (Su) Any creature that dies within 1,000 miles

of an aspect of Leviathan cannot be raised by any

means. In addition, all spells and spell-like effects that

have the death descriptor are cast at +4 caster level.

This property does not come into effect until the Levia-

than truly wakes (when its overwhelming eerie weather

sign manifests).

AXIHUATL

Long have the air-breathers plagued my people. Long have they

interfered with our destiny. Their dominion over this world shall

soon end, drowned beneath the mighty waters. The Leviathan shall

rise, my people, and we shall be its masters!

Axihuatl, priest of Demogorgon

The vampiric ixitxachitl called Axihuatl is nearly three

centuries old and has grown to enormous size and power.

A faithful priest of Demogorgon, Axihuatl is an exemplary

member of his species, which is to say he is cruel, hateful,

violent, and nothing less than fanatical in his desire to rid

the world of the hated surface-dwellers.

GOALS

The ixitxachitls always knew that the Leviathan existsin

the depths of the seas, its hard to miss such a vast creaturebut

they remained ignorant of the beasts true nature and power.

During his years spent studying ancient and near-forgot-

ten lore, Axihuatl discovered how to harness the Leviathans

chaotic energy for his peoples use.

It is his intention to use rituals to rouse the Leviathanbut

not to wake it completely, since that would end the world as

well as Axihuatl and his people. In a state of semiwakefulness,

however, the Leviathan is susceptible to at least partial con-

trol, and its enormous destructive powers can be channeled

against speci c targets. Axihuatl intends to turn it against

the surface-dwellers and their hated continents, leaving

the world under miles of water where the ixitxachitl can

rule unopposed. Axihuatl  nds it deliciously ironic that, in

the guise of the human cult-leader Enshaddon, he uses the

surface-dwellers to perform those portions of the ritual that

must be carried out on land.

USING AXIHUATL

Axihuatl does not make his presence known immediately.

For much of the time, the PCs see him as Enshaddon and

believe  that  he  is  nothing  more  than  a  demented  human

Axihuatl

priest.  When  the  characters  disrupt

Axihuatls plans, he takes a personal

interest  in  them  and  unleashes  his

various minions against the party.

Until Axihuatl is actually revealed as an ixitxachitl, he

operates in the background, primarily through other crea-

tures in his thrall. After the PCs disrupt his  rst ceremony,

Axihuatl sees them as a threat and directs Marcus Hape to

deal with them.

Once his ritual goes wrong and the Leviathan threatens

the world, Axihuatl reluctantly approaches the PCs, asking

for aid. He instructs the PCs on how to use the Abyssal Shard

to send the Leviathan back to sleep and might even be will-

ing to accompany the party. If he does accompany the PCs,

Axihuatl will not actively help them, but he defends himself if

attacked. For the most part, he hangs back and does as little as

possibleeither because he is planning to destroy the party

once he has completed his task, or due to his well-developed

sense of self-preservation.

DESCRIPTION

Axihuatl is a vampiric ixitxachitl who has been alive for

290 years. In this time he has grown to considerable size

and now resembles a mottled, horri c manta ray with large,

intelligent eyes, a thick tail, and well-developed  ns capable

of dexterously manipulating objects.

In  his  researches  and  travels,  Axihuatl  has  located  and

aided in the creation of magic items tailored speci cally to

his physiology. He wears two bands on his tail that provide

protection and magical enhancements equivalent to rings

or  bracers  of  the  same  type  (see  below),  as  well  as  two

one of

ioun stones, which he

found while searching for

his  most  important  posses-

sionsthe artifact called the Abyssal Shard. The Shard is a

fragment of black rock that orbits Axihuatls head in a fashion

similar to an ioun stone. This object is critical to his plans to

awaken the Leviathan and will also play an important role

in putting it back to sleep once the task of destroying the

surface world is complete.

Recently, Axihuatl has been spending considerable time in

the surface world, using his wand of polymorph to transform

himself into his human alter ego: Enshaddon, high priest of

the Leviathan. In this form, he leads the Cult of the Leviathan

and has been using human worshipers to perform rituals to

summon aberrations and awaken the Leviathan.

ABYSSAL SHARD

A fragment of elemental chaos, the Abyssal Shard is a key ele-

ment in Axihuatls ritual to awaken the Leviathan. As chaos calls

to  chaos,  the  presence  of  this  chunk  of  living  disorder  draws

the  great  beast  from  its  slumber  just  far  enough  for  Axihuatl

to influence its actions. Once the Leviathans task is complete,

Axihuatl intends to have Marcus Hape or another minion cast

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

the shard into the Leviathans heart, where it will be absorbed,

sending the creature back to its slumbers.

The Abyssal Shard can be used like an ioun stone. Placed in

the air, it orbits around the users head, providing a +5 bonus

on saving throws against spells cast by lawful opponents and

+5 to the save DC of spells cast against lawful opponents.

How may I serve the Prince of Demons?

MARCUS HAPE

Marcus Hape

Axihuatls plan to drown the world suits Demogorgon just

 ne, since it aids his ixitxachitl worshipers as well as his

demonic ally Dagon. The ixitxachitls plans require the

assistance  of  surface  dwellers,  and  Demogorgon  has  com-

manded his minion Marcus Hape to assist Axihuatl in any

way possible.

GOALS

Marcus lives only to serve Demogorgon. He has placed

himself in thrall to the Prince of Demons and hopes that

his  master  will  eventually  reward  him  for  his  faithful

service. He views the opportunity to aid Axihuatl with

enthusiasm; Marcus believes that by playing a role in the

destruction  of  civilization,  he  will  show  himself  to  be

Demogorgons most valuable minion. He secretly hopes

that his prince will preserve a small amount of land after

the deluge so that he can continue to serve Demogorgon

as the absolute ruler of the surviving

surface-dwellers.

USING MARCUS

Marcus knows Enshaddons true

identity  and  obeys  him  without

question.  He  leads  a  group  of

assassins  and  rogues  directed

to  destroy  the  PCs  and  tries  to

sabotage  their  plans  whenever

possible.  If  desperate,  Marcus

attacks  the  characters  directly.

If  he  survives  these  encounters,

he  will  be  with  Axihuatls  cultists

during  the  confrontation  inside  the

Spine Temple.

DESCRIPTION

Once a handsome, aspiring actor, Marcus

Hape fell in with a bad crowd of decadents

and sophisticates who claimed to worship

the forces of darkness. His friends were

nothing more than poseurs, but Marcus

eventually  fell  into  the  clutches  of  the

true cult of Demogorgon and took up life

as an assassin.

Today, Marcus does his masters bid-

ding in the hope that he will one day

receive his rightful reward from the

forces of darkness. He retains some of

his actors good looks, with wavy black

hair and a small, neat beard, but the left

side  of  his  face  is  badly  scarred,

leaving his eye a dead, milky

whitethe  self-inf licted

symbol  of  his  devotion  to

Demogorgon.

SPINE TEMPLE

Rituals  to  awaken  the  Leviathan  take  place  at  a  secret

temple  located  in  one  of  the  mountainous  spines  that

bristle along the great beasts back. The spine, positioned

not far behind the Leviathans head, rises from the water

several miles off the coast. It is entirely featureless, leaving

sailors and scholars alike utterly puzzled as to its origin

and purpose.

Originally  used  by  chaos-worshiping  spellcasters  to

recharge their arcane energy, the temple has long been aban-

doned. Axihuatl learned of its existence during his research

on the Leviathan and intends to use the temple to awaken

the creature, then return the Leviathan to sleep once it has

done its work.

KEY FEATURES

The spine is ideal for Axihuatls purposes, since part of it

rises above the water, part of it is below, and the lowest level

contains an opening to the swirling heart of chaos inside the

Leviathans body. A single entrance on the surface provides

access to the upper temple.

The upper level of the temple at the tip of the Leviathans

great spine is above water, but the remainder is submerged

beneath the waves. Long, dark, and perilous tubes provide

access between levels.

DEFENSES

The  temple  is  a  baf ing  and  alarming  place  for  outsiders

(see Encounter Areas, below, for details), and Axihuatl relies

on secrecy to defend it. He does not venture into the lower

levels of the temple very often, remaining content to let the

various chaotic obstacles of the lower levels keep the place

safe from intruders.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

The following locations  correspond to those indicated on

the map.

First Level

The uppermost level of the temple is a roughly conical

chamber where surface-dwelling cultists perform their ritu-

als. A massive shaft of bone, elaborately carved and  uted,

supports the arched ceiling. At the base of the central pillar

is the ritual space where Axihuatl (in human form) leads his

air-breathing followers.

A. Entrance

This tube is dry and leads to an entrance on the surface

(the other three on the level are filled with water after

about 20 feet and lead to the next lower level). The cultists

have fixed a rope ladder to enable easier access (Climb DC

12). The exterior door is located about 10 feet above the

surface of the water and requires a DC 24 Search check

to locate.

B. Ceremonial Circle (EL 16)

The central pillar narrows down here, where a ritual circle

is inscribed in the  oor, surrounded by incomprehensible

runes. If cast correctly, Axihuatls ritual will in theory wake

the Leviathan for a time so it can smash the lands and sink

most of the continents, and then send it back to sleep, leaving

the world (in the ixitxachitls mind, anyway) a far better place.

See encounter 51, page 74, for more details.

C. Ascending Transport Tubes

D. Descending Transport Tubes

These  tubes  are  about  10  feet  in  diameter  and  were  used

for access between levels when the temple was submerged.

Warm water rises through the tubes, heated by the mass of

the Leviathan below, so swimming down is somewhat more

dif cult than swimming up. Descending one level through a

tube requires 10 minutes and requires a DC 15 Swim check.

Failure means that the swimmer takes 1d6 points of nonlethal

damage from fatigue.

Spine Temple

Swimming up to the next higher level is easier, since

the warm water carries the swimmer along. Doing this

requires a DC 10 Swim check and takes 5 minutes. Once

more, failure results in 1d6 points of nonlethal damage

from fatigue.

Third Level

The lowest level of the temple is a great spherical chamber

over 800 feet across. It too is covered in carved runes that

provide  shadowy  illumination  and  bestow  penalties  on

lawful-aligned creatures as described on the previous level.

Second Level

This level is a squat cylinder, its walls, floor, and ceiling

completely  covered  in  intricately  carved  runes  similar

to those that surround the ceremonial circle on the first

level. An eerie glow emanates from the runes, suffusing

the area.

Chaos  energy  from  the  Leviathan  slowly  leaches  from

these runes; lawful-aligned creatures take a 1 penalty on

attack rolls, skill checks, saves, and ability checks while on

this level. Small bioluminescent creatures swarm through

the water, tiny manifestations of the Leviathans dreams.

E. Runic Zone (EL Varies)

These zones exist as cubes of chaotically charged water

about 150 feet square, each centered on one of the trans-

port  tubes  from  above.  Here,  chaos  energy  is  focused,

manifesting several unusual effects. Anyone exiting the

tubes  into  the  level  encounters  the  runic  zone  and  its

effects.  See  encounter  52,  page  76,  for  further  details

on these zones.

F. Chaos Doorways (EL Varies)

The builders of the temple used these portals to transport

themselves to and from the temple, entering and exiting

without the need for physical doors. Now they serve as

conduits to the Leviathan, manifesting creatures from its

dreams and transporting them from the temple to elsewhere

in the world. If the PCs approach within 50 feet of one of

these doorways, roll on the following table to see what type

of creature manifests.

UPPER TEMPLE

PPER TEMPLE

Encounter Level 20

SETUP

This encounter takes place in the ritual area in the center

of the upper temple level. Here, Axihuatl and his minions

perform  the  ritual  that  rouses  the  Leviathan.  Axihuatl

(A) is in the form of Enshaddon, the human priest of the

Leviathan. He and the cultists (C) are placed as noted on

the map. The players can place their miniatures in any one

of the corner areas of the map; once the characters attack,

Axihuatl beckons a waterveiled assassin to hold them at

bay while he completes the ritual.

When the PCs arrive, read:

A single column of ivory bone rises from the center

of the chamber to the domed ceiling. It is carved

with intricate runes that you cannot decipher. A

Liquid Body (Ex) A waterveiled assassin exercises supreme

control over its watery form, allowing it to flow around

attacks, flatten itself against the ground to avoid a

spells blast, and so forth. Any effect or spell that allows

a Reflex save for half damage has a 50% chance to have

no effect on a waterveiled assassin.

Malleable Form (Ex) A waterveiled assassins control over

its form allows it to flow through tiny cracks in objects

and move through the earth, walls, and other obstacles.

The assassin moves at normal speed through

terrain that slows movement. It can move through

permeable objects at half speed, but it cannot move

through completely solid barriers. For example, an

circle surrounded by more of these runes is inscribed

in the  oor, and around it stand numerous

humans, chanting the name Leviathan. In the

center of the circle near the column stands the high

priest Enshaddon. Before him, a small, polished

black stone hovers in the air as he too chants and

moves his hands in intricate patterns around it.

When a character comes within 5 feet of the outer

circle, read:

Enshaddon catches sight of you and spits a curse.

He raises his arms and chants again; nearby, cracks

appear in the  oor and a great rush of water emerges,

coalescing into a mass containing suspended bits of

rock, dirt, bones, and the remnants of clothing,

weapons and armor. Rushing forward with malign

intelligence, the watery form moves toward you.

assassin could flow through a wooden or brick wall by

squeezing into cracks and channels, but it could not

move through a wall of solid iron or rock, such as that

produced by wall of stone.

If the assassin ends its movement completely within

an object, opponents do not have line of sight or line of

effect to it. Its reach drops to 0 feet. Any creatures

engulfed within the assassin (see engulf, below) fall out,

dropping prone at the edge of the object. If only part of

the assassin is in an object, but its remaining space

cannot hold all the creatures within it, the assassin

chooses which ones to release.

Churn (Ex) As a swift action, a waterveiled assassin can

create mighty currents within its body that grind engulfed

creatures, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

An engulfed creature that succeeds on a DC 30

Fortitude save takes half damage.

Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a waterveiled assassin can

flow over Medium or smaller creatures, entrapping them

within its liquid form. The assassin simply moves into the

opponents space; any creature whose space it completely

covers is subject to the engulf attack. The assassin cannot

make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. It

can engulf as many creatures as can fit in its space.

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against

the assassin, but if they do so they are not entitled to a

saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of

opportunity must succeed on DC 30 Reflex saves or be

engulfed. On a success, a creature moves aside or back

(opponents choice) to get out of the assassins path.

Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled

within the assassins body, and they are subject to its

churn attack (see above). Engulfed creatures that

breathe air might drown (DMG 304).

One With Water (Ex) Since a waterveiled assassins body is

liquid, it can simply disappear into water. An assassin in

a volume of water at least 15 feet wide, 15 feet long, and

15 feet deep is invisible. It remains invisible as long as it

remains within water, even if it attacks.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Ritual Circle: The cultists stand around the edge of these

carved runes. A permanent magic circle against law is in effect

inside the circle. Creatures of chaotic alignment (including

Axihuatl and the cultists) receive a +1 circumstance bonus on

attack rolls, skill checks, and saves.

Inner Circle: The magic circle against law effect continues

within the inner circle. In addition, a magic circle against good

is in effect, and creatures of evil alignment receive a further

+1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saves.

This stacks with the previous bonus, giving chaotic evil creatures

(such as Axihuatl and the cultists) a +2 bonus.

TACTICS

Initially, the waterveiled assassin moves to defend Axi-

huatl. Its priority is protecting him, so it moves toward any

characters who attack him. Cultists likewise move to stop

the PCs while Axihuatl completes the ritual, but they are

more likely to be nuisances than any real threat. The focus

initially is simply to slow the party down and buy Axihuatl

some time.

When one or more characters break through and attack

Axihuatl, he turns and  ghts while the Abyssal Shard begins

to orbit the central column and the runes grow brighter and

brighter. He casts all possible protective spells on himself

before combat if he has time, and once in combat uses his

corrupt in ict spells, starting with the most damaging and

working down. He falls back toward the central column as

he  ghts.

If  Marcus  Hape  survived  previous  encounters  (see  the

EL 10 portion of the timeline on page 66), he is here too and

loyally  ghts for Axihuatl.

CONCLUSION

The combat continues until Axihuatl has lost half his hit

points. At this point, he staggers and accidentally strikes

the orbiting Abyssal Shard. The entire chamber is rocked

by  a  massive  tremor  equivalent  to  an  earthquake  spell,

requiring  characters  to  make  DC  15  Re ex  saves  or  be

knocked prone.

After the tremor, all the tubes in the  oor of the cham-

ber shoot geysers of seawater into the air, and the chamber

immediately begins to  ll with water at a rate of about 1

foot per round. The cultists begin to scream and take no

further actions other than trying to save themselves. Once

the water is 10 feet deep, Axihuatl transforms into his

ixitxachitl form.

Before the PCs can react to Enshaddons transformation,

they are submerged in the water and must make DC 20 Swim

checks. Moments later, huge waves ripple through the cham-

ber and smash open one of the walls. The sea comes rushing

in, and the PCs are swept out of the chamber, carried along

by a titanic wave.

SETUP

This encounter occurs after the PCs have agreed to help

Axihuatl put the Leviathan back to sleep. Once they locate

the  Leviathan,  they  have  to  catch  up  with  it  and  enter

through the breach in the side of the Spine Temple on level

one. Once inside, they can freely swim down the transport

tubes to the second level. where they are buffeted by wild

currents and eddies. Place the characters randomly on the

map at various depths. For underwater movement, use the

rules on page 92 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

your surroundings, coming from faintly glowing

spots that you can glimpse in the distance.

Swallow Whole (Ex) An aspect of the Leviathan can try to

swallow a grabbed opponent of up to Huge size by

making a successful grapple check.

The swallowed creature takes 3d8+10 points of

bludgeoning damage and 2d8+4 points of acid damage

per round from the aspects gizzard. A swallowed

creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or

piercing weapon to deal 42 points of damage to the

gizzard (AC 22). Once the creature exits, muscular

action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent

must cut its own way out.

The gizzard of an aspect of the Leviathan can hold 2

Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or

smaller opponents.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, an aspect of the

Leviathan must hit an opponent of up to Gargantuan

size with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the

following round.

Skills An aspect of the Leviathan has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) The Leviathan is immune to all

divine divination spell effects.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

True Death (Su) Any creature that dies within 1,000 miles of

an aspect of Leviathan cannot be raised by any means.

In addition, all spells and spell-like effects that have the

death descriptor are cast at +4 caster level. This property

does not come into effect until the Leviathan truly wakes

(when its overwhelming eerie weather sign manifests).

FEATURES OF THE AREA

The battlefield includes a number of areas affected by the swirl-

ing random energy of the level. These zones are columns of water

that extend from the top of the battlefield to the bottom and

affect any individuals moving through them regardless of their

relative depth. They can also be moved by the DM to present the

party with greater challenges, if a character is leaving the battle-

field too quickly or is otherwise having too easy a time of it. The

aspects of the Leviathan are immune to the zones effects.

Creatures: The water seems alive with many different small

creaturesiridescent  glowing  shrimp,  tiny  jellyfish,  spiral-

shaped worms, and fluttering fan-shaped creatures. They are

harmless but numerous enough to cling to anyone who enters,

slowing movement and obscuring vision. A character must at-

tempt a DC 24 Reflex save. On a failure, the PC is blinded and

moves at half speed for 1 round. On a success, the PC takes a

1 penalty on all rolls and checks for 1 round.

Turbulence: This water swirls about madly; anyone entering

the zone must make a DC 22 Reflex save or be flung 1d610

feet in a random direction.

Thick Zone: The water here is thick and sluggish, so moving

through this area is like swimming through pudding. A character

entering one of these zones must stop and can move no farther

in this round. In the following round he must make a DC 12

Strength check to leave the thick zone and even then can move

at only half speed in that round. On a failure, the character is

stuck and cannot move, but can take any other action.

Chaos Effects: These columns contain concentrated chaos

energy  and  cause  a  single  random  effect  to  anyone  entering

them. These effects are in addition to any rolled on the random

table above.

toward you.

TACTICS

Two aspects of the Leviathan attack the PCs to keep them

apart  and  prevent  them  from  leaving  the  encounter  area.

Only two aspects of the Leviathan appear at  rst. If the party

is having too easy a time, add one or two more aspects.

The  aspects  attempt  to  use  their  chaotic  surge  ability

to incapacitate the PCs, then swallow whole any helpless

victims (freedom of movement will not aid paralyzed or uncon-

scious PCs against grapple checks).

The aspects continue to pursue the PCs if they move out

of the runic zones. If the characters can reach the exits, the

aspects break off pursuit.

As the battle goes on, random chaotic events take place,

making the PCs escape even harder. Every 1d4 rounds, a

new random condition affects everyone on the battle eld

except the aspects of the Leviathan. Roll on the table below

to determine the effect. Individual effects (such as energy

damage, shaken, and so on) must be determined for each

character  separately.  General  effects  (darkness,  antimagic

 eld, and the like) affect the entire encounter area. All effects

last for 1 round unless otherwise indicated.

CONCLUSION

The  ght ends when the party either kills the aspects or escapes

from the level. The unusual conditions and the fact that the PCs

had to start the  ght separated add to the dif culty, and you can

award up to 1,000 bonus XP for surviving the encounter.

THE PIT

HE PIT

Encounter Level 20

SETUP

This encounter area is a water- lled cube. The PCs begin

anywhere on the map, at the very top of the cube, 100 feet

from the bottom.

Two krakens (K) swim at the depths speci ed on the tacti-

cal map. The greater aspect of the Leviathan (A) and one other

kraken are at 0 feet of depth relative to the other two krakens

The number of krakens assumes that the PCs have access

to a freedom of movement effect, which renders the grapple

attacks of both the krakens and the aspect useless. If some,

but not all the PCs have freedom of movement, reduce the

number of krakens by one. If none of the PCs has access to it,

reduce the number of krakens by two or replace them with

megalodons (MM2 147) or similar lower-CR creatures.

You feel a steady current rising upward from a

yawning black pit a hundred feet below. Eight

monolithic columns of black basalt extend up

around the edges of that pit, and the water around

you is warm. Below you, the pit begins to  icker

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a kraken must hit with

an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can constrict.

Constrict (Ex) A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle

damage with a successful grapple check.

Jet (Ex) A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-

round action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a

straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Ink Cloud (Ex) A kraken can emit a cloud of ink in an 80-foot

spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud

provides total concealment.

The party must take the Abyssal Shard to the Pit and dispose of

it there. This must be done by a spellcaster and requires that

the user be within 10 feet of the pit while repeating a long

invocation that takes 6 full rounds. If attacked or otherwise

disturbed, the user must make an appropriate Concentration

check. If Axihuatl is within 20 feet of the user, he can assist

in these checks by relaying the required invocation to the

user. After 6 rounds, the Shard can be thrown into the pit,

after which go on to the Conclusion below.

TACTICS

The advanced aspect of the Leviathan is drawn to the char-

acter who has the Abyssal Shard. It attacks this individual

whenever possible and uses its chaotic surge ability as soon

as it is in range. It then attempts to swallow the shard-carrier

whole. If the shard-carrier perishes in the aspects gizzard,

see possible outcomes under Conclusion, below.

The  krakens  attack  the  other  PCs  and  attempt  to  keep

them from helping the shard-carrier.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Obelisks: These polished black columns rise 100 feet from

the edge of the pit.

The Pit: If a creature that was not spawned by the Leviathan

enters this pit, it must make a DC 24 Reflex save or be dragged

down and destroyed as if by a disintegrate spell.

CONCLUSION

After the Abyssal Shard vanishes into the pit, the Leviathans

motions abruptly cease as it slowly returns to slumber. If the

aspect of the Leviathan is still alive, it vanishes into a swirl of

blue-white motes. Any surviving krakens  ee. The PCs must

swim out of the Spine Temple and ascend to the surface to

escape. The upper levels are inert nownone of the chaos

effects continue.

If  the  shard-carrier  was  swallowed  and  perishes  in  the

aspect of the Leviathans gizzard, the creature  ghts on for

several rounds, giving the party the chance of retrieving the

shard, then vanishes into the Pit. Either this means that the

party has failed and the world is doomed, or (more optimisti-

cally) the Shard reaches the heart of the Leviathan and merges

with its creator, sending the great beast back to sleep.

Axihuatls reaction to the partys success is up to the DM.

If he escapes, he either disappears or goes on to hatch more

schemes against civilization.

Once the PCs have emerged, they  nd the world profoundly

changed, since the Leviathans rampage displaced oceans and

sent  mountain  ranges  tumbling.  Despite  the  disaster,  the

world survived and will recover.

hey brought it. They brought it and trapped it,

though many gave their lives to do so. They brought

it to threaten the gods, which they did. And the gods

responded. But the evil remains, imprisoned. Biding.

Planning. Seething.

Tune Majii, arcane investigator

Lured to the Material Plane by an ancient civilization

hoping to protect itself from the vengeance of deities,

Pandorym personi es the emotionless void of utter

annihilation. It was imprisoned by its summoners

millennia ago as a deterrent but never released. Now,

hidden in a forgotten prison, the godslaying weapon

awaits  the  arrival  of  a  being  powerful  enough  to

reunite its awesome mind with its potent body. Pan-

dorym seeks freedomand with it, mass deicide.

BACKGROUND

Long ago, a cabal of foolish wizards violated the laws of

the multiverse in their search for ever-greater power,

discovering spaces between the planes that should

never have been breached. Their arrogance angered

the deities, who jealously coveted this knowledge. To

defend themselves (and incidentally, their people), the

cabal members sought a weapon with which to threaten

the gods. The wizards bent their wills toward a quasi-

reality best described as perpendicular to that of the

Great Wheel. The dark enticement of the chance to slay deities

called to the Material Plane a sentient singularity of scarcely

fathomable power and unrelenting destructiveness.

Given the name Pandorym by its summoners, it sought

greedily to ful ll the terms of its contract, but was instead

imprisoned. Knowing they couldnt hold Pandoryms full

might with magicmortal or divinethey cleaved its alien

psyche from its body, trapping the former in a crystal prison

beneath their city and the latter in a transdimensional space

that touches the multiverse at only one point. (Knowledge

[history] or [arcana] DC 28)

In their hubris, those who brought Pandorym called on

the deities aligned against them, revealing only a hint of their

weapons unbelievable destructiveness. The wizards believed

such a display would force the gods to relent. Instead, the

deities struck  rst. What would stop a single member of

that insolent cabal from being consumed by madness and

reuniting the halves of Pandorym? Thus, before the cabal

could consolidate its position, the gods blotted every trace

of it from the world. (DC 32)

Ancient deities who remember that fearful time occasion-

ally speak to their modern clerics of their decision, striking

fear into the hearts of their followers. Having wiped out the

wizards and their civilization, the gods could not undo what

the cabal had achieved. Thus, they were forced to hide away

Pandorym in its dual prisons and erase all known records of

the things existence. Nevertheless, tales persist of the weapon

that kills gods, and they hint at its location. (DC 35)

Despite the seals that hold its mind within the crystal-

line prison, Pandorym remains conscious and aware of its

surroundings. Deathless and bored, it eagerly latches onto

the psyche of any sentient creature that wanders too close,

attempting to reunite its mind and body. But these mortal

pawns are too fragile to endure its control. To its eternal

frustration, the crushing power of its mind breaks its servants

long before they can perform any helpful action. Until, that

is, very recently. (DC 37)

GOALS

Pandorym seeks, above all else, the reunion of its potent mind

with its unstoppable form. (Knowledge [arcana] DC 30)

From those whose minds held upat least for a timeto

the impossible might of its psyche, the terrible weapon has

learned of the destruction of its betrayers. It suspects that

descendants might yet exist of those who lured and snared it,

and once it achieves freedom, Pandorym will seek revenge on

those innocents for the crimes of their ancestors. (DC 34)

After it slakes its thirst for vengeance, Pandorym intends

to complete its end of the bargain it struck millennia ago.

Although Pandoryms summoners didnt respect that binding

covenant, the quasi-living weapon possesses an unremitting

sense of honor. It will ful ll its contract by obliterating every

deity it  nds in this reality. It knows that gods cant easily

die, but it plans to rip them from existence. (DC 37)

Once it has  nished these tasks, Pandorym will return to

its home realityif it can. If it is prevented from leaving the

multiverse, whether through a conscious act or because the

rift created to summon it cannot be remade, Pandorym will

end the Material Plane, one world at a time. (DC 42)

PANDORYM

IN THE CAMPAIGN

Either the mind or the body of Pandorym alone is powerful

enough to end a campaign. If the two are brought together,

the alien weapon would be unstoppable. A reunited Pando-

rym should lead to the end of the campaign world.

TIMELINE

Here is a possible campaign timeline coded with Encoun-

ter Levels to help you construct adventures around key

events that might occur as Pandorym attempts to release

its mind.

EL  5:  Tune  Majii  (NG  female  human  bard  2/wizard  2)

is concerned about the recent disappearance of her father,

Lucather. She has been in contact with the PCs before, perhaps

as an employer, and is known to be reliable and helpful. She

approaches them with a tale of sorrow and a promise of a rich

reward. She asks the PCs to discover the current whereabouts

of her father, who was last known to be exploring a certain set

of ruins. The trail has gone cold, and the PCs begin to trace

the old mans movements.

EL 10 (Faint Sign): In an occurrence seemingly unre-

lated to the concerns of Tune Majii, a council of clerics has

convened. Their deities have warned them of an unknown

being that is attempting to release an imprisoned evil of

unimaginable power. One of the PCs (a cleric, paladin, or

other divine spellcaster) receives word from a representative

of her faith. The party is tasked to hunt down and stop this

threat, but little is known of its nature.

At the same time, barely perceptible arcane glyphs appear

in the night sky. Conjurers report dif culty casting spells,

and  an  emergency  meeting  of  sages  is  called.  The  arcane

casters suspect a weakening connection with the rest of the

multiverse, which might be related to these signs.

EL 15 (Moderate Sign): The PCs discover that the being

they seek is a misguided agent of supreme law who does not

view its objective as an evil or foolish act.

Meanwhile, the nocturnal glyphs become more prevalent

and numerous, as the bonds connecting the Material Plane

to other planes continue to weaken. Summoned creatures do

not automatically return home, and divine spellcasters  nd

it more dif cult to channel the power of their patrons.

EL 17 (Strong Sign): The PCs learn the identity of both

the rogue agent and the being it wishes to release. A kolyarut

known as Obligatum VII believes it is bound by law to free

the imprisoned Pandorym. The PCs might have run across the

creature earlier but not realized that it was their adversary.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SIGN: SEAL OF BINDING

This sign manifests as a glyph that spreads across the sky and increas-

ingly interferes with planar communication and transportation.

Faint: Conjuration (calling, summoning, and teleportation)

and divination spells and similar spell-like abilities are impeded,

meaning that a caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20

+ the level of the spell) or lose the spell or spell slot without effect.

In  addition,  spells  that  forcibly  return  creatures  to  their  native

plane, such as banishment and dismissal, automatically fail.

Moderate: As faint, but in addition, summoned creatures no

longer return to their native planes. When a summoning spells

duration expires, the summoned creature is no longer under the

casters control.

Divine  spellcasters  have  difficulty  drawing  on  the  Positive

Energy and Negative Energy planes, and they cannot commu-

nicate easily with their deities. Divine spells are cast at 1 caster

level, and turn or rebuke attempts take a 5 penalty on the check

and damage rolls.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Strong: As moderate, but in addition, a conjuration (telepor-

tation) spell or similar spell-like ability has a 20% chance of a

mishap (see teleport, PH 293), regardless of familiarity with the

destination. The spell fails, and the caster and all others affected

by the casting each take 5d6 points of damage.

The  connection  with  the  transitive  planes  and  the  Outer

Planes grows more tenuous. Divine spells are cast at 2 caster

level,  and  turn  or  rebuke  attempts  take  a  10  penalty  on  the

check and damage rolls.

Overwhelming: All conjuration (calling, summoning, and

teleportation) effects cease to function. Divination effects that

contact extraplanar beings (such as commune and contact other

plane) are likewise foiled. Divine spellcasters attempting to

replenish their spells for the day incur a 20% chance per spell

of not gaining the spell or spell slot. Divine spells are cast at 4

caster level, and turn or rebuke attempts take a 20 penalty on

the check and damage rolls.

The arcane seals are bright enough to be seen at all hours.

Teleportation becomes much riskier, and the dif culty for

divine spellcasters increases.

EL 20 (Overwhelming Sign): Obsessed with her fathers

fate, Tune Majii contacts the PCs again. She has discovered

Lucathers location. Further, she knows he serves a being of

utter evil. She intends to halt whatever foul plans his master

have concocted and insists that the PCs help. The PCs might

have discovered that the being Lucather serves is the same

one that Obligatum VII seeks to release.

Following Tunes lead, the PCs descend through the ruins

above the prison. Within, they discover Obligatum VII chip-

ping away at the crystal holding Pandoryms consciousness.

The damage allows a mind shard of Pandorym to form. Even this

fragment is powerful enough to

present  a  terrible  threat.  The

PCs  must  contend  with  this

horror, the relentless kolyarut,

and an enraged Lucather (what

is left of him).

PANDORYM

IN EBERRON

Pandorym might be entombed

beneath the Mournland, per-

haps  holding  secrets  to  that

mysterious

devastation.

Alternatively,

the  giants  of

Xendrik might

have  lured  and

entrapped  Pando-

rym during the

height of their

power  thou-

sands of years

ago. Now its crys-

talline prison is buried

under one of their many ruins

on that jungle continent.

In the  rst scenario, Pando-

rym could be the reason for the

Day of Mourning. (Since no one

of cially  knows  the  cause  of

that cataclysm, youre free to in-

terpret the event in any way that

works for your campaign.) This

explanation requires you to advance the timeline of Pandoryms

arrival in Khorvaire to only a few years before the beginning of

the campaign. In this scenario, House Cannith, in cooperation

with Cyre, brought the alien weapon to Eberron to challenge

the gods and to end the Last War for good. As a result of Cyres

hubris, the godsor perhaps some other powerdestroyed

the kingdom utterly, creating the Mournland.

PANDORYM IN FAERN

As described in the novel Darkvision, the ancient Imaskaran

Empire brought Pandorym to Faern to prevent the deities

from seeking vengeance for the Imaskaris genocide. Before

they could use their weapon, though, the gods laid low

82

the whole empire. Pandorym remains to this day, its mind

entrapped  within  the  Imperial  Weapon  Cache  under  the

Palace of the Purple Emperor.

PANDORYM

Pandorym exists in two distinct parts: its thought-breaking

mind and its reality-ending body. Were the two to be reunited,

Pandorym would resemble nothing from this reality.

Body: Pandoryms physical component does not truly exist

as a body in the multiverse but is a conduit to the incomprehen-

sible reality of its home. It manifests as a 30-foot-diameter sphere

of annihilation (DMG 279), but no beingnot even a deitycan

control it, even using a talisman of the sphere. Any attempt to con-

trol the Gargantuan orb instead

causes it to slide 90 feet toward

the creature. Touching the entity

with a rod of cancellation destroys

the rod and causes Pandoryms

nonbody to slide into the square

from which the rod touched it.

With the seal of binding sign

in effect, spells that force an ex-

traplanar creature away do not

affect Pandorym. However, a gate

spell cast on it has a 5% chance

of sending it back to its trans-

dimensional  prison  (nothing

happens otherwise).

Like a sphere of annihilation,

Pandoryms non body de-

stroys everything

it touches, aside

from deities.

The ancient

wizards hid Pan-

doryms  body  in  a

secret  location  in

a  distant  part  of

the  kingdom,  far

from  the  crystal-

line prison that holds its mind.

Mind: The mind of Pando-

rym, even imprisoned, presents

a subtle and sinister challenge.

While it is imprisoned, Pando-

ryms  consciousness  is  de ned

entirely by the crystals that trap it.

The intensity of the prisons purple glow wanes and waxes in

a rhythmic pattern. At times, the crystal seems to pull light

into itself rather than radiate it. Occasionally, when it grows

especially dark, a malevolent purple-red glow appears deep

within. At those times, the alien mind seems to be aware

and focusedif only brie y. Fortunately for the world, the

crystalline prison is exceedingly dif cult to damage.

If released without a body to focus its energy, Pandoryms

psyche spreads like a stain across reality, becoming a sphere

40 feet in diameter. Its incorporeal emptiness stretches thin,

and around its edges it resembles a wispy cloud of lightless-

ness.  Vaporous  tendrils  form  and  dissipate  at  random  at

this boundary. This irregular ball has no discernible front,

Even a fragment of Pandoryms consciousness

can fell the mightiest creature

back, or sides, and rotates slowly on a tilted axis. It seems to

drift along, even when moving at top speed. Chill breezes,

strong enough to make candles  icker but not extinguish,

rise within 5 feet. When Pandorym deigns to communicate

telepathically, a dim glow emanates from its center.

THE MIND SHARD OF PANDORYM

If  released,  Pandoryms  consciousness  is  an  imposing

challenge for any beingmortal or immortal. However, if

the crystal is damaged but not destroyed, a tiny fragment of

Pandoryms mind might be released. Resembling a miniature

galaxy of dark menace, even this shard is more than a match

for the most powerful characters. A mind shard of Pandorym

can exist for only 24 hours outside the prison, however. Only

one mind shard can exist at a time.

The  PCs  are  unlikely  to  encounter  a  mind  shard  alone.

Once they enter the prison complex, they must deal with

Obligatum VII as it chips away at the crystal. The mind shard

expends every effort to ensure that the kolyarut is successful.

If Lucather Majii still lives, he also assists the mind shard.

Detect Thoughts (Su) As the detect thoughts spell (PH 220);

continuous. This ability provides basic information as if

from concentrating for 1 round. A mind shard can focus

for additional rounds to gain more information.

True Seeing (Su) As the true seeing spell; continuous; caster

level 20th.

Mental Subjugation (Su) Creatures within 30 feet of a mind

shard must succeed on a DC 48 Will save every round or

be affected as if by a dominate monster spell (CL 25th). A

creature that succeeds on this saving throw takes 1 point

of Wisdom damage instead. This is a mind-affecting ability.

Psionic Draw (Su) When a creature within 90 feet spends

power points to manifest a psionic power, the creature

must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + power

level) or spend double the normal number of power

points. Even if the creature succeeds, the mind shard

regains a number of power points equal to the normal

cost of the power. If a creature fails the check and doesnt

have enough power points to manifest the power, the

power doesnt manifest and no power points are lost.

True Seeing (Su) As the true seeing spell; continuous; caster

level 20th.

Divine Enervation (Su) All divine spellcasters lose the ability

to regain spells so long as they remain within 1,000 miles

of a mind shard of Pandorym. This interdiction does not

interfere with spellcasting.

Divinity Siphon (Su) As a standard action, a mind shard of

Pandorym can form a siphoning bond with a creature

within 90 feet that can cast divine spells or has a divine

caster level of at least 1st. The caster must make a DC 48

Will save to resist this ability. If the bond is established,

the caster gains 1d4 negative levels per round. For each

negative level the caster gains, the mind shard heals 20

hit points. The bond lasts for up to 10 rounds, or until the

mind shard breaks it or the caster dies. A caster who re-

ceives as many negative levels as Hit Dice dies and rises

as a dread wraith in the following round.

A mind shard can have only one siphoning bond ac-

tive at a time. Maintaining a bond requires no effort.

Summon Undead (Su) Three times per day, a mind shard

of Pandorym can summon one of the following undead

groups: 2d4 allips, 1d3 ethereal oozes (Fiend Folio 63),

2d4 quells (Libris Mortis 116), 1d6 wraiths, or 1d3 dread

wraiths. The undead arrive in 1d4 rounds and serve for 24

hours or until released.

Vampiric Ego Whip (Su) As the ego whip power (DC 27), but

requires only a swift action, and the mind shard regains

2 power points per point of damage dealt. A mind shard

can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.

Psionics (Ex) A mind shard of Pandorym can expend the

equivalent of 20,000 XP on powers that have an XP cost.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) A mind shard of Pandorym is im-

mune to all divine divination spell effects.

Corporealize (Su) As a move action, a mind shard of Pan-

dorym can materialize a part of itself into a corporeal

form, usually a pseudopod or tentacle. The mind shard

uses this ability to interact with the material world out-

side of combatpicking up or moving objects, opening

doors, and so on. It corporealizes in combat only to move

an item out of the reach of an enemy, to disarm a foe

wielding a ghost touch weapon, or to otherwise remove

something that can harm it. A mind shard can have up to

twelve corporeal appendages in existence at one time.

An opponent can make sunder attempts against an ap-

pendage as if it were a weapon. An appendage has 40 hit

points and does not gain a de ection bonus to Armor

Class (giving it an AC of 26). Severing the appendage

deals 20 points of damage to the mind shard.

Limited Existence (Ex) A mind shard of Pandorym exists for

only 24 hours before evaporating. A mind shard reduced

to 0 hit points immediately evaporates. A mind shards

evaporation does not affect Pandoryms mind in any way.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

Nonlinear Time Awareness (Su) As a native of an alien reali-

ty, Pandorym senses the  ow of time differently from how

ordinary creatures do. This ability grants a mind shard of

Pandorym an insight bonus to its Armor Class equal to its

Intelligence modi er (usually +12).

Swift Focus (Ex) Three times per day, a mind shard of Pando-

rym can regain its psionic focus as a swift action. Doing

so requires a DC 40 Concentration check.

Telepathic Backlash (Su) Whenever a creature targets a mind

shard of Pandorym with a telepathy power or an enchant-

ment spell, the manifesting or casting creature must

immediately make a DC 48 Will save. A creature that fails

this save is affected as by a feeblemind spell (PH 229).

LUCATHER MAJII

I have seen it, Tune. I have  nally seen what gave the very gods

pause. That which, through its calling, brought about the destruction

of our ancestors. I have seen . . . the end of the world.

Lucather Majii, loremaster pawn

GOALS

Lucather Majiis greatest desire was to know the truth behind

the  destruction  of  his  ancestors.  He  explored  ever  more

ancient  and  mysterious  ruins  in  search  of  clues.  He  used

his powers of persuasion to convince or to trick people into

divulging secrets he desired. The culmination of that search

was  discovering  the  prison  of  Pandoryms  mind,  but  the

experience stripped him of his life and free will. His mind

was overwhelmed by the elder evils crushing power, which

ripped his very soul from his body.

Now an incorporeal pawn, Lucather Majii continues his

obsessive search for knowledge on behalf of his alien master.

He must now rely more than ever on his ability to manipulate

others.  He  relentlessly  hunts  for  anyone  who  has  enough

mental  fortitude  to  withstand  Pandoryms  consciousness

long enough to free the entitys psyche. More than a dozen

unfortunate souls met their end in this way, many of them

lingering as horrible undead. Lucather has now turned his

malign intent toward one he is sure can pass the testhis

own daughter. He hopes to lure her, along with other worthy

creatures, into his newly claimed lair.

Once  Lucather  secures  the  release  of  Pandoryms  mind

from its crystalline prison, he intends to seek out the loca-

tion of its nonbody. He does not realize that the unbound

immensity of the quasi-living weapons mind will destroy

him, completely and irrevocably.

USING LUCATHER MAJII

A master of several puppets, but little more than a marionette

himself, Lucather works best as part of the  nal challenge in

a campaign. Through his loyal if nave daughter, he can draw

the PCs to him once they have proven themselves.

If Obligatum VII reaches the ruins above the crystalline

prison  complex,  Lucather  does  everything  he  can  to  aid

the kolyarut in accomplishing its goals. Attempts by PCs to

stymie the creature within or near the ruins draw Lucathers

ire; he joins Obligatum VII as an ally in battle. See encoun-

ters 62 and 63 for more about Lucathers behavior when

confronted in the prison complex.

DESCRIPTION

His encounter with the mind of Pandorym held unforeseen

consequences for Lucather. In addition to stripping away his

free will and instilling a hatred of divinity, constant contact

with the crystalline prison also ripped his soul from his body.

PANDORYM WITHOUT PSIONICS

The mind shard of Pandorym is an intensely powerful psionic

being. If your campaign does not use psionics, treat the mind

shard as a sorcerer focusing on enchantment spells.

Replace vampiric ego whip with vampiric ray of enfeeblement,

with the same restrictions on its use; the mind shard regains

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

a spell slot of a level equal to one-half the points of Strength

damage dealt. Its psi-like abilities and metapsionic feats become

spell-like abilities and metamagic feats. Instead of swift focus,

the mind shard has the extraordinary ability to apply metamagic

feats it knows to its spells without increasing casting time.

Lucather exists as a quell (Libris Mortis 116), his incorporeal

presence only an echo of his formerly handsome self. What

remains of Lucather resembles wispy gray-white smoke col-

lected in a vaguely humanoid form. His body appears cloaked,

and his eyes glow with a malevolent green  re.

OBLIGATUM VII

Regardless of your emotional connection to your deity, the impris-

onment of the entity known as Pandorym is a breach of contract.

Pandorym deserves release.

Obligatum VII, misguided kolyarut

even as rumors of the crystalline prisons discovery spur

its efforts.

USING OBLIGATUM VII

Obligatum VII treats as a distraction anyone who attempts to

interact with it in a capacity that neither aids nor hinders its

mission. Single-minded in ways no mortal can comprehend,

the kolyarut exists to ful ll its mission. It does not tolerate

distractions for more than a few minutes.

The  PCs  gradually  learn  the  identity  and  purpose  of

Obligatum VII, but the best time for them to confront it is

within the chamber of the crystalline prison (see encounter

63, page 94) as the kolyarut is about to ful ll its

purpose. Obligatum VII ignores all interference,

even damage to itself, unless it is in imminent

danger of destruction.

Obligatum  VII  emerged  from  a

crche-forge  on  Mechanus  to

fulfill a mission opposed by

the most powerful servants

of deities. It is the seventh

in a line of kolyarut inevi-

tables  bearing  the  same

name and mission. Oblig-

atum VII understands

its  opponents  and  has

methods of countering

their tactics. It is deter-

mined to be the last of

its series.

GOALS

Roughly  900  years

ago, the  rst Obliga-

tum kolyarut became

aware  of  the  verbal

agreement struckand

subsequently  broken

thousands of years earlier

with a powerful crea-

ture not of this reality.

Innately dedicated to

the principles of law,

it  paid  no  heed  to  the

danger of the beings release.

The inevitable set forth to en-

force the contract struck by a now-dead

civilization. It had only one goal: to re-

lease the indescribable thing known as Pandorym. It knew

only that this entity was imprisoned within the ruins of the

lost kingdom.

It failed. So did  ve successors also assigned to rectify-

ing the breach. Obligatum VII is the latest to take on this

mission. Four of the inevitables predecessors fell to meddle-

some servants of deitiesgood, evil, and neutral. Fiends,

celestials, and mortals alike stymied their supreme mission.

The other two failed through the actions of adventurers

who knew nothing of Pandorym but came into conflict

with the kolyaruts for other reasons. Aware of these past

failures, Obligatum VII avoids drawing attention to itself,

Because its adamantine sword ignores

the crystalline prisons hardness, Ob-

ligatum  VII  can  create  a  crystal

sliver  (releasing  a  mind  shard

of  Pandorym)  after  only  a  few

blows. Depending on the level

of  your  campaign,  you  can

have the PCs arrive just as the

kolyarut  begins  its  attack

on the crystal or sometime

after  it  has  started.  In  the

latter case, a mind shard has

already appeared.

DESCRIPTION

Obligatum  VII  looks  like

any other kolyarut, a human-

shaped  being  of  gleaming

metal in ornate mail. How-

ever, its weapons, armor, and

other equipment are obvious-

ly  superior  in  craftsmanship

and materials to those of ordi-

nary kolyaruts.

Auravision (Su) Obligatum VII can see magical auras at a

range of up to 60 feet as a free action. This ability oth-

erwise functions as the detect magic spell. Obligatum

VII cannot use this ability to determine anything but the

number of magical auras present.

Mettle (Ex) If Obligatum VII makes a successful Will or For-

titude save against an attack that normally would have a

lesser effect on a successful save, it instead negates the

effect.

Vampiric Touch (Su) As the vampiric touch spell (CL 13th);

6d6 damage.

Enervation Ray (Su) As the enervation spell (CL 13th); range

200 feet.

Vicious Strike (Ex) When Obligatum VII readies an attack ac-

tion to disrupt a spellcaster, it deals double damage if the

attack hits.

Hexblades Curse (Su) Once per day, as a free action, Ob-

ligatum VII curse an opponent within 60 feet that it can

see. The target of the curse takes a 2 penalty on attack

rolls, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon

damage rolls for 1 hour. A successful DC 16 Will save

negates the effect.

Any effect that removes or dispels a curse eliminates

the effect of a hexblades curse.

Mind over Magic (Su) Twice per day as a free action, Ob-

ligatum VII can cause a spell or spell-like ability targeted

against itself to rebound onto the originator. This ability

otherwise functions as the spell turning spell (CL 13th).

Nondetection Cloak (Su) As the nondetection spell, but

affects only Obligatum VII and its possessions; caster

level 5th.

Weapon Bond (Su) Obligatum VII deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage with its +2 adamantine vorpal longsword

against a spellcaster or a creature that has spell-like abili-

ties. If that weapon is lost or destroyed, Obligatum VII

loses the ability to deal the extra damage until it spends 8

days practicing to bond with another weapon of the same

kind of at least masterwork quality.

THE CRYSTALLINE

PRISON COMPLEX

The lost empires wizards and artisans constructed a magic

crystalline prison to ensnare Pandoryms mind. When the

deities obliterated the kingdom, they dared not destroy

the crystal and release their doom. Instead they sealed

the prison away and eliminated all records of its existence.

Still, the deities knew they could not keep the prison secret

forever, so they created defenses around its location. Over

time, the in uence of Pandoryms mind has created undead

guardians, the maddened remnants of those who failed to

release it.

KEY FEATURES

Every  mortal  being  that  dies  in  the  frightful  complex

surrounding the crystalline prison later serves in some

way as a defender of the site. And every mortal being fool-

ish enough to enter the complex so far has breathed its

last within.

Physical Hazards

The prison holding Pandoryms mind lies hidden beneath

crumbling ruins and extensive catacombs. The ravages of

time have created cave-ins and blockages intermittently

throughout the complex. Excavations have attempted to link

areas separated by collapsed sections. Not all those efforts

succeeded, resulting in even more labyrinthine passages.

To further confuse intruders, the deities established decoys

throughout the catacombs: false prisons within completed

but unused circles of binding.

In addition to the natural hazards it presents, the prison

complex  has  active  and  dedicated  guardians.  Original

defenders remain, in the form of constructs. Intruders

fell to the ancient guardians, perished in traps or cave-

ins, or were destroyed by Pandoryms oppressive mind,

and now patrol the complex as undead. They oppose any

living  creatures  they  encounter,  whether  in  search  of

final rest, out of an abiding hatred for life, or simply as a

release from boredom.

Many defenses were overcome by Lucather Majii and his

band of mercenaries. They deliberately bypassed some wards

or  guardians,  ran  from  others,  and  luckily  avoided  a  few.

Ultimately, though, they succumbed to the awesome might

of Pandoryms mind or to its near-impenetrable prison.

Aura of Entropy

An aura of entropy  lls the underground cavern complex

and all the surrounding ruins. The deities established this

aura to deter intruders and to strengthen existing defenders.

It has the following effects.

(cid:129)  Living creatures within the area do not heal naturally:

They do not regain hit points or heal ability damage by

resting. (Magical healing functions normally.)

(cid:129)  Undead that have been turned or rebuked remain so for

only 5 rounds, instead of the normal 10.

(cid:129)  Fortitude saves to prevent permanent level loss take a 4

penalty if made within the area.

(cid:129)  Any living creature that dies within the area rises as an

undead in 1d4 minutes. Nonsentient beings become

zombies or other mindless undead of equivalent Hit

Dice; creatures with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher

return as intelligent undead such as vampires or ghouls.

Theres a 10% chance that an intelligent beings mind

and body separate. Its consciousness rises as an incorpo-

real undead, such as a quell (Libris Mortis 116) or wraith,

and its body animates as a corporeal horror such as a

bodak or a forsaken shell (Libris Mortis 100).

ENCOUNTER AREAS

The ruins above the crystalline prison are  lled with the dire

challenges and opponents typical of a high-level dungeon

setting. Their extent and salient features are left to you to

design as you see  t. The complex can be dropped into the

deepest part of any suitable dungeon.

A. Chamber of Summoning (EL 15)

In this room the ancient wizards  rst contacted and lured

Pandorym to this reality. The chamber barely survived its

arrival: The annihilating body of the ultraplanar being

instantly blew a 30-foot-wide sphere out of existence, along

with several of its summoners. In a last act of freedom as

the survivors strove to divert it into its prison, Pandorym

lashed out at its betrayers. It utterly destroyed the bodies

of a handful of mages and their assistants, leaving their

suddenly insatiable souls intact. Panic ensued. A few sum-

moners managed to escape, sealing the chamber against

dimensional travel. The ghostly remnants of the rest fed

on their former allies and coconspirators, bolstering their

numbers. Now a dozen angry greater shadows (MM 221)

remain trapped within.

B. Outer Circle of Binding (EL Varies)

The lines and symbols of a massive calling diagram (PH

249) cover the  oor of this circular hallway. Passing over

the lines toward the center of the circle shifts a corporeal

creatures body to the perpendicular reality of Pandoryms

home for a brief moment. The sudden disorientation causes

all living creatures to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds

(no save).

Necromancy  spells  cast  within  the  circle  (including

adjacent rooms and passages) are extended (without using

up  higher-level  spell  slots).  Casting  a  conjuration  spell

within the circle requires a Concentration check (DC 30

+ spell level); a failed check results in the spell being lost

with no effect.

Several groups of constructs and undead patrol the hall.

C. Inner Circle of Binding (EL Varies)

A second great circle of binding covers the  oor of this

circular hallway, enclosed entirely within the outer circle.

Passing over its engraved lines shifts a corporeal creatures

body to Pandoryms native reality for a few seconds. The

wrenching shift causes all living creatures to take 1d4 points

of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (no

save). In addition, living creatures must succeed on a DC 30

Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Necromancy  spells  cast  within  the  circle  (including

other rooms and passages) are extended and maximized

(without using up higher-level spell slots). All conjuration

(calling, summoning, and teleportation) spells cease to

function. Undead creatures within the area gain +8 turn

The Crystalline Prison

resistance, which stacks with any other turn resistance

they have.

This inner circle de nes the limit of Pandoryms power

while its mind is trapped within the crystalline prison.

If Pandoryms mind escapes, the  oor holding the calling

diagram cracks, and the entire hallway collapses.

The Crystalline Prison

At the heart of the complex is a 20-foot-diameter circular

room covered with sigils, runes, and incomprehensible

glyphs of arcane design. A dark, oppressive chill leaks from

the frigid void beyond the world, freezing the rooms interior.

The temperature never rises above extreme cold (DMG 302).

Fire spells deal half damage in this room. Nonmagical open

 ames are snuffed out the instant they enter the chamber

and cannot be relit within its walls. Light sources provide

half normal illumination.

At the chambers center  oats a violet crystal 15 feet tall

and 8 feet across. It pulses with an unholy darkness that

seems to suck in whatever light enters the room. It does not

shimmer, nor does it re ect or refract any light other than

hues of purple, casting a sickly violet pall over everything.

The mind of Pandorym is trapped within.

(cid:129)  The crystal is actually a modified, solidified form of

permanent prismatic wall (PH 264), six layers deep (it does

not include the violet layer). The normal magical coun-

ters to the layers effects dont function. Any creature that

touches  the  crystal  (even  if  wearing  a  glove  or  other

protective clothing) is subject to the effect of one color

layer  per  round,  in  consecutive  order,  for  6  rounds  of

contact. A creature still in contact with the crystal for a

seventh round is drawn into the prison and blotted from

existence; on a successful DC 45 Will save, it is instead

disintegrated as the spell (no saving throw).

A creature drawn into the prison cannot be restored

by any means as long as the crystal remains intact, since

it no longer truly exists in this reality. If the crystal is

shattered (which releases Pandoryms mind), a creature

destroyed by entering it can be returned to life with a true

resurrection, wish, or miracle spell.

Held items touching the crystalline prison do not put

their wielders at risk, but an intelligent magic item is af-

fected as a creature would be.

(cid:129)  The crystalline prison has hardness 30, 300 hit points,

and spell resistance 40. It is immune to acid, cold, elec-

tricity, and  re. Sonic attacks deal double damage, ignor-

ing hardness as usual.

(cid:129)  If the crystalline prison takes 100 points of damage, it

cracks and sends forth a mind shard of Pandorym. When

a mind shard is destroyed, the prison repairs 30 points of

damage. As long as the crystal has 100 or more points of

damage that have not yet been healed, another shard is

created 1d4 rounds after the  rst is destroyed.

(cid:129)  If  the  crystalline  prison  is  reduced  to  0  hit  points,  it

crumbles into a pile of slivers and dust. At that moment,

the mind of Pandorym is released.

GUARD ROOM

UARD ROOM

Encounter Level 20

SETUP

Few of the guard rooms in the ruins surrounding the crys-

talline prison remain inhabited, let alone intact, and none

by the original guards. Debris and corpses from earlier expe-

ditions accumulated and were animated by the powerful

aura encompassing the complex. Now a grisgol defends this

room, while a hidden deathshrieker lurks out of sight.

The players place their miniatures at the doorway on the

eastern side of the map. When the PCs open the door, place

the grisgol (G) in the indicated space but do not place the

advanced deathshrieker until a PC becomes paralyzed, as

described in Tactics below.

When the players have   nished arranging their min-

iatures, place the grisgol and read:

Near the center of this circular room lie several

dead bodies in a pile surrounding a vaguely

human-shaped heap of detritus, parchment scraps,

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A grisgol is immune to any spell or

spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,

certain spells and effects function differently against a

grisgol, as noted below.

Erase delivered as a touch attack against a grisgol

deals 2d6 points of damage (no save). Casting secret page

on a grisgol renders it invisible, as the invisibility spell.

Damaging Touch (Ex) A grisgol deals an additional 1d8+5

points of negative energy damage to a creature it

and shattered items. Tall statues have toppled on

both sides of the doorway. To the right, a large

shape made up of ancient, yellowed scrolls and

other well-crafted items lurches to its feet.

The   rst time a PC is paralyzed by the grisgols attack,

place the advanced deathshrieker in one of the spaces

occupied by the destroyed grisgol and read:

A shrieking apparition rises from the  oor amid

the pile of debris. It drifts forward and reaches with

a ghostly, clawed hand for your helpless companion.

TACTICS

The grisgol moves to attack living creatures it sees entering

the room, attempting to paralyze as many as it can. It does

not stop  ghting until it is destroyed or its opponents are.

As soon as a PC becomes paralyzed, the deathshrieker

enters the  ght to take advantage of helpless prey. It works

in concert with the grisgol, attempting to paralyze more

opponents  and  draining  Charisma  from  those  affected.

touches. A successful DC 19 Will save halves the

damage.

Paralyzing Touch (Su) The slam attack of a grisgol causes

permanent paralysis unless the subject succeeds on a

DC 19 Fortitude save. Remove paralysis or any spell that

can remove a curse can free the victim. The effect

cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a grisgol

seems dead, although a successful DC 20 Spot check or

DC 15 Heal check reveals the victim to be alive.

Choking Dust (Ex) Striking a grisgol with anything other

than a piercing weapon causes a disease-carrying,

choking cloud of dust and mold to explode from the

creature. All within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a

DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution

damage. Those who fail the first Fortitude save must

immediately attempt another DC 23 Fortitude save

(adjusted by their new Constitution score); on a failure,

they contract slimy doom (DMG 292) in 24 hours.

Incite Madness (Sp) Anyone examining the strips of

parchment and pages that comprise the wrappings of a

slain grisgol invokes a curse that renders the reader

insane (Will DC 19 negates). The victim of this insanity

becomes convinced that the scraps contain great and

lost arcane secrets that can be rediscovered only by

painstakingly fitting every piece together in the right

order. The affected creature dedicates every waking

hour to this massive undertaking, barely pausing to eat

or rest, and always believes a revelation is close.

The affected creature takes 1 point of Intelligence

drain when the curse is first activated, and 1 extra point

of Intelligence drain every week the curse continues.

The subject dies when it reaches 0 Intelligence.

The Intelligence drain cant be restored while the

curse is active. Only a limited wish spell or similarly

powerful magic can break this curse.

remains within the area of a silence spell, it takes 1d10

points of damage (Will half).

Charisma Drain (Su) An individual struck by a deathshrieker

must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or take 1d4

points of Charisma drain (2d4 points on a critical hit). The

death shrieker heals 5 points of damage (10 on a critical

hit) whenever it drains Charisma, gaining any excess as

temporary hit points.

Death Rattle (Su) When a deathshrieker is reduced to 0 hit

points, it immediately releases a final, devastating shriek.

All living creatures within a 300-foot spread must succeed

on a DC 27 Will save or gain 1d4 negative levels. Creatures

that cannot hear or are under the effect of a silence spell

gain a +4 bonus on this save.

Scream of the Dying (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a

deathshrieker can release a soul-numbing scream that lasts

for up to 3 rounds. After this first round, a deathshrieker

can use a standard action to sustain the scream. This attack

affects all living creatures within a 30-foot spread centered

on the deathshrieker, or within a 60-foot cone extending

from the deathshrieker, at the creatures option. Once a

deathshrieker chooses the shape, it must maintain that

shape for the duration of the effect. It can aim a cone in a

single direction during its turn. Creatures caught in the

area must succeed on a DC 29 Will save or suffer the

effects described below. The effects are cumulative and

concurrent. Creatures that cannot hear or are under the

effect of a silence spell gain a +4 bonus on this save.

Round 1: Deafened 1d4 rounds.

Round 2: Stunned 1d3 rounds.

Round 3: As insanity (PH 244); CL 18th.

This scream is so loud that normal conversation is

impossible. A spellcaster who attempts to cast a spell that

has a verbal component must succeed on a DC 26

Concentration check or lose the spell.

Despair (Su) A creature that sees a deathshrieker must

succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for

1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that

creature cannot be affected again by the same

deathshriekers despair ability for 24 hours.

Vulnerability to Silence (Ex) Deathshriekers cannot abide

silence and are harmed by it. To even enter the radius of a

silence spell, a deathshrieker must succeed on a Will save

(DC 12 + caster level). Each round that a deathshrieker

Once more than half the opponents have been paralyzed at

least once (even if they are no longer so), the deathshrieker

 ies to the top of the chamber and lets loose its scream of

the dying. It maintains the effect for the full 3 rounds.

If the deathshrieker is reduced to 90 hit points or fewer, or

if an opponent casts silence, it  ees into the chambers  oor.

It waits there for several minutes, then attempts to follow

the PCs and catch them in the midst of another  ght. If the

grisgol is destroyed, the deathshrieker uses its scream of the

dying ability.

CONCLUSION

In addition to items recovered after defeating the grisgol, the

PCs can  nd the following treasure among the three corpses:

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Fallen Statues: These depict heavily armored guards from

the ancient kingdom. The squares they fill are considered dif-

Destroyed Grisgol: The pile of detritus in the center of the

room is the remains of a grisgol destroyed by Lucather Majiis

group. The squares it covers are considered difficult terrain (2

squares of movement to enter).

Rubble: A wall section has collapsed, filling the northwest

corner with dense rubble (difficult terrain; increase the DC of

Balance and Tumble checks by 5 and the DC of Move Silently

checks by 2).

THE SHATTERED HALL

HE SHATTERED HALL

Encounter Level 20

7 Advanced Caryatid ColumnsFF

CR 7

SETUP

When  the  deities  sealed  the  complex  enclosing  the

crystalline  prison,  they  animated  the  statues  and  other

decorations within to act as guardians. In this area, bas-

relief  depictions  of  humans  and  humanoid  creatures

stepped  out  of  the  walls  and  became  caryatid  columns

(MM2 30). Fourteen caryatid columns (C), in two groups

of seven, patrol this area. The starting positions of the  rst

group are labeled on the map.

The  players  place  their  miniatures  depending  on  the

direction of their approach. Lucather Majii (L) appears in the

indicated position 2 rounds after combat begins. After 4 more

rounds, seven additional caryatid columns arrive, entering

from the side opposite the one where the PCs began.

When  the  players  have  finished  arranging  their

miniatures, read:

Elaborate and disturbing bas-relief decorations

obviously once covered the walls in this area but

were later defaced. Humanoid shapes have been

ripped from the walls, leaving jagged indentations

in the gruesome scenes.

When the PCs are able to see the caryatid columns,

place the creatures on the map and read:

A patrol of animated statues marches along the

corridor. When they catch sight of you, they clash

their weapons against their stony forms and advance.

Two  rounds  after  combat  begins,  place  Lucather

Majiis   gure on the map and read:

A ghostly form, dressed in  owing robes and

surrounded by dark glyphs,  oats through the

wall. Fixing you with its  ery green eyes, it spits

vile curses and begins to make arcane gestures.

TACTICS

The  rst seven caryatid columns work together tactically

to eliminate one opponent at a time. They focus  rst on

any PC wielding a two-handed weapon, hoping to break

it against their bodies.

The sounds of combat attract the attention of Lucather

Majii, who appears 2 rounds after the PCs engage the

patrol. When he arrives, he  rst uses his intercession abil-

ity to weaken divine spellcasters. He then begins casting

spells, beginning with appropriate high-level ones. When

the second wave of patrollers arrives, the caryatid columns

(along  with  any  surviving  from  the   rst  wave)  defend

Lucather with a defensive line or semicircle.

A caryatid column can stow its weapon by pressing

it against its side; the weapon then merges with the

caryatid columns body and can be retrieved by taking a

move action to draw a weapon.

Break Weapon (Su) Whenever a creature uses a melee weapon

to strike a caryatid column, the weapon must succeed on

a DC 15 Fortitude save or break, dealing no damage.

Nonmagical projectiles automatically shatter upon

hitting a caryatid column, dealing no damage. Magic

ranged weapons receive a DC 15 Fortitude save to

resist the effect.

Column Form (Ex) This ability is not relevant to this

encounter.

CONCLUSION

This  ght is intended to delay and weaken intruders. If

the PCs defeat all seven caryatid columns of the  rst wave

within 2 rounds, Lucather waits for the second wave. The

next seven caryatid columns arrive 6 rounds after combat

begins, regardless of whether the  rst wave survived or

whether the PCs are still in the area.

Lucather  ees to the chamber of the crystalline prison

(encounter 63, on the next page) if both waves of caryatid

columns are destroyed or if he is reduced to 20 hit points

or fewer. Adding Lucather to that rooms other defenders

increases its Encounter Level by 1. In addition, his arrival

noti es Obligatum VII of the PCs approach and nulli es

any chance of their surprising it.

The  effect  of  the  outer  circle  of  binding  makes  this

encounter slightly tougher. Award 110% of experience to

groups that successfully overcome this challenge.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Outer Circle of Binding: This area falls within the outer

circle of binding, granting the following effects.

Necromancy spells cast within the area are automatically

extended without using up higher-level spell slots.

Casting a conjuration spell within the area requires a Con-

centration check (DC 30 + spell level); a failed check results

in the spell being lost.

the area with dense rubble (difficult terrain; increase the DC

of Balance and Tumble checks by 5 and the DC of Move Silently

checks by 2).

CRYSTALLINE PRISON

RYSTALLINE PRISON

Encounter Level 20+

SETUP

Obligatum VII (O) has found its way to the crystal hous-

ing Pandoryms mind and has begun its attack. It has dealt

enough damage to be close to releasing a mind shard. Six

dread wraiths (D) guard the kolyarut as it single-mindedly

pursues its task. If Lucather Majii survived or avoided the

battle in encounter 62, he is also present as indicated on

the map (L).

The players place their miniatures along a map edge,

depending on the direction of their approach. If Obliga-

tum VII succeeds in freeing a mind shard, it appears in

the center of the room, covering the squares occupied by

the crystalline prison.

When  the  players  have    nished  arranging  their

miniatures, read:

Swirling about this circular chamber are dark,

tattered shades whose red eyes glow with

malevolence. From behind the door of a circular

inner room come the sounds of metal clashing

on stone.

When a character opens the door leading to the inner

chamber, read:

A violet crystal dominates the center of this room,

pulsing with an unholy darkness that seems to

suck in light. Its evil glow casts everything in a

sickly violet pall. A human-shaped being of metal

stands near the massive crystal, chipping away at

it with a sword.

TACTICS

Obligatum VII is focused on releasing Pandoryms impris-

oned mind. The kolyaruts +2 adamantine vorpal longsword

ignores hardness, dealing an average of 11 points of damage

per round to the crystal. By the time the PCs arrive, it has

already dealt 50 points of damage to the prison. Once the

damage reaches 100 points, the crystal cracks and a mind

shard of Pandorym forms. (If you want to present a more

dif cult challenge for the party, Obligatum VII can have

released a mind shard already and be well on its way to

shattering the crystal.)

The kolyarut is single-minded in its task, but it takes

steps  to  defend  itself  if  it  is  reduced  to  75  or  fewer  hit

points. Even then, if allies protect the inevitable it con-

tinues its assault on the crystalline prison regardless of

its injuries.

Dread  Wraiths:  The  dread  wraiths  work  with  one

another  and  Lucather  (if  he  still  exists)  to  defend  the

inevitable,  but  they  do  not  necessarily  cooperate  with

Lifesense (Su) A dread wraith notices and locates living

creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the

blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life

force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.

Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals will not willingly approach

nearer than 30 feet to a dread wraith and panic if forced

to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are

within that range.

Daylight Powerlessness (Ex) Dread wraiths are utterly

powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight

spell) and flee from it.

Constitution Drain (Su) Living creatures hit by a dread

wraiths incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a

DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Constitution

drain. On each such successful attack, the dread wraith

gains 5 temporary hit points.

Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a dread wraith

becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the

command of the dread wraith that created them and

remain enslaved until its destruction. They do not

possess any of the abilities they had in life.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Outer Circle of Binding: This area falls within the outer

circle of binding, granting the following effects.

Necromancy spells cast within the area are automatically

extended without using up higher-level spell slots.

Casting a conjuration spell within the area requires a Con-

centration check (DC 30 + spell level); a failed check results

in the spell being lost.

Inner Circle of Binding: This area falls within the inner

circle of binding, granting the following effects. These effects

override those of the outer circle. The outer circles effect resumes

if the inner circle has been disabled or otherwise nullified.

Necromancy spells cast within the area are extended and

maximized without using up higher-level spell slots.

All  conjuration  (calling,  summoning,  and  teleportation)

spells cease to function.

All undead gain +8 turn resistance (which stacks with any

other turn resistance they have).

The Crystalline Prison: Floating over a 10-foot-diameter

dais in the chambers centermost room looms a violet crystal

10 feet tall and 5 feet across. The crystalline prison is nearly

impervious to most attempts to damage it. It is affixed to its

location by a permanent dimensional anchor spell (caster level

30th). See the description on page 87 for its properties.

If the crystal is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles into a

pile  of  1d10  slivers  (see  below)  and  worthless  dust.  At  that

moment, the mind of Pandorym is released.

For every 10 points of damage dealt to the crystalline prison,

a sliver breaks off. Each sliver provides the equivalent of 100

XP toward the creation of any magic item incorporating it and

has a market value of 500 gp.

Obligatum VII or a mind shard. They focus on one or two

physically weak foes (rogues, arcane spellcasters, and the

like), using their Constitution-draining attacks to kill their

opponents and swell their own numbers.

Mind Shard of Pandorym: If a mind shard forms, it

immediately defends Obligatum VII or any other crea-

tures  attacking  the  prison.  It  concentrates  on  heavily

armored foes (such as  ghters or other combat specialists),

leaving physically weaker opponents to the dread wraiths

and Lucather.

CONCLUSION

If  the  PCs  fail  to  stop  Obligatum  VII,  it  releases  the

imprisoned mind of Pandorym. The freed entitys psyche

is nearly impossible to defeat. It directs Obligatum VII to

the dimensional prison housing Pandoryms body, where

the two parts of the alien weapon will be reunited. The

journey  to  this  location  takes  some  time,  and  the  gods

might be convinced to intervene. If they cannot or will

not, Pandorym will ful ll its contract and destroy the cam-

paign setting.

Even if the PCs are victorious, the crche-forges of Mecha-

nus churn out Obligatum VIII in 2d4 months. That kolyarut

exceeds its predecessor in ability and bears an even more

powerful  weapon.  Preventing  further  incarnations  of  the

kolyarut might require a planar journey to destroy their place

of origin.

The in uence of the circles of binding and the presence

of the crystalline prison make this encounter substantially

more challenging than the creatures Encounter Levels

might indicate. A victorious party should receive 125% of

the normal XP for the encounter.

Irthicax Vane, Malshaper

Ragnorra, Mother of Monsters, is a primeval source

of  life  eternally  corrupted.  Bloated,  hideous,  and

 lled with a terrible love for her children, this elder

evil wanders the planes searching for new worlds to

remake in her image.

BACKGROUND

Many creation myths divide the worlds history into

three distinct eras. The present, the time of mortal

races, was preceded by the time of the gods. Before the

gods was the age of primeval forces, both good and

ill. The Mother of Monsters belongs to that era.

Until recently, knowledge of Ragnorra had been

lost to mortals. Now, sketchy reports have begun

circulating in scholarly circles of runes in the silver

sky of the Astral Plane. Some claim these signs warn

of the return of Ragnorra, and their stories are now

given  more  credence  than  ridicule.  (Knowledge

[the planes] or [religion] DC 32)

Ancient tales refer to the Mother of Monsters, a gigantic,

unnatural creature that birthed horrors that plagued the

early worlds. The gods cast this awful thing into the space

between the planes. With the world rid of her creatures, they

were free to create the mortal races. Scholars have partially

deciphered  the  runes  that  summarize  this  history.  Most

claim they herald the return of Ragnorra. (DC 37)

A vocal minority of planar scholars claim the runes tell

not one tale, but many. Each rune has been written atop a

previous one, incorporating the earlier rune in its form. The

runes gigantic size suggests that the story of Ragnorra has

been told many times, rewritten each time she is to appear.

Each of the prior tales ends in the extinguishing of mortal

races on a world and the corruption of all its life. (DC 42)

Moving between the planes, Ragnorra appears about once

every 1,500 years on the Material Plane. Her arrival takes the

form of a  ery red comet. The astral runes are not a warning

so much as a signpost that points out Ragnorras path to

the next world. (DC 47)

GOALS

Ragnorra  is  a  twisted,  irresistible  force  of  creation.  She

exists to spawn life in her own terrible image. Legends tell

of her spores raining down upon worlds to fester. The spores

parasitize  plants  and  animals,  raising  blisters  that  birth

monsters, killing the hosts. Even inanimate objects sprout

hideous creatures. Some unfortunate sentients infected by

620_21556_Ch7.indd   96

9/27/07   3:19:11 PM

9/27/07   3:19:11 PM

spores become aberrant hybrids. (Knowledge [the planes]

or [religion] DC 32)

Ragnorra is a vast intelligence, but not a conscious one.

She operates on intuition, dreaming inexplicably deep plans.

Destruction is not her purpose, but rather undoing the errors

of the gods and reshaping all life according to her own vision.

That this horrid new order is contradictory, destructive, and

painful to her progeny does not matter to her. (DC 37)

Ragnorra is no longer content with merely seeding a world

from above. She now prepares it by crashing herself into the

earth with enough force to raise a vast crater. The collision

hurls dust and debris into the air, altering the climate and

weakening existing life. Pieces of Ragnorras own body rain

down from the sky, spreading her awful fecundity around

the world. (DC 42)

A group of outsiders from several planes have formed a cult-

like society, the Malshapers. Rather than fearing Ragnorra, they

revere her power and guide her plans. They create a sort of trail

through the multiverse, seeding it with life from a chosen world

to lead the Mother of Monsters to her next target. Evidence of

this trail manifests as runes in the Astral Plane. (DC 47)

RAGNORRA

IN THE CAMPAIGN

Ragnorras path is extraplanar, a twisted loop with one end

anchored  in  the  Positive  Energy  Plane  It  curves  through

the Astral Plane and intersects with the Ethereal Plane, the

Material Plane, or the Plane of Shadow before returning to

its starting point. Each loop takes approximately 500 years.

Ragnorra was exiled long before the deities created the mortal

races, so the elder evil has been a potential threat for as long as

the campaign setting has existed. Her current path is taking

her toward the PCs world as the result of the Malshapers

actions to lead  her  there. This process can  take  anywhere

from a few months to many years of game time, depending

on the needs of the campaign.

Once Ragnorra emerges on the Material Plane, astrologers

and astronomers quickly detect a  ery red comet where none

had previously been recorded. The faint effect of her sign

appears. Soon she is visible to the naked eye, dominating the

night sky while the signs effect strengthens. Ultimately, she

crashes into the world, and the sign reaches its peak. At that

point, the PCs have only a short time to deal with the threat.

Sometimes Ragnorras target is another, nearby world. Her

close passage leaves spores and corrupting in uence in its

wake, producing the effect of a moderate or strong sign, but

does not culminate in a collision.

TIMELINE

Here is a campaign timeline to help you construct adventures

around events that might occur as Ragnorra approaches,

culminating in her catastrophic arrival.

EL 5: The Malshapers observe that Ragnorra is about to

emerge from the Positive Energy Plane. They have chosen

the campaign world as her destination and set in motion a

plan to lead her there. Irthicax Vane (see page 101) recruits

minions for a gruesome scavenger hunt to gather living

organisms, including members of sentient races, to entice

Ragnorra along the chosen course. Their activities come

to light through kidnappings, the purloining of rare herbal

specimens, or the disappearance of prized livestock.

SIGN: TWISTED LIFE

This sign manifests as a surge of corrupt positive energy that

resculpts life on an entire world.

Faint: All spells and effects that use positive energy are cast at

+1 caster level, conjuration (healing) spells are cast at +2 caster

level, and turn undead attempts are treated as though they were

made by a cleric of 1 level higher.

Moderate: As faint, but in addition, warts and blemishes appear

on living targets of conjuration (healing) spells. These unsightly

growths impose a 2 penalty on Charisma-based checks. Once

per day, an affected creature can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude or

Will saving throw; success removes the blemishes.

Spores fall to earth, taking root in rock, roofs, and living crea-

tures. Treat this effect as a disease (contact, incubation period 1

day, damage 1d4 Con, DC 15), but three successful saving throws

are required to throw off the infection instead of two (DMG 292).

The spores create pustules that grow as the disease progresses,

bursting when the infected creatures Con is reduced to 0. The

creatures death releases one swarm of mundane pests (such

as bats, rats, spiders, or locusts) per 5 Hit Dice of the infected

creature (minimum one swarm).

Strong: As moderate, but the DC of saving throws to resist the

spores or to remove blemishes increases to 20. Conjuration (heal-

ing) spells and other spells using positive energy are impeded,

meaning that a caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 +

the level of the spell) or lose the spell or spell slot without effect.

The surge of positive energy repairs flesh. Once per day,

an injured living creature regains 2d8+10 hit points, as if by

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

an empowered cure moderate wounds spell (caster level 20th).

Undamaged living creatures gain temporary hit points instead.

The temporary hit points last for up to 24 hours.

This unnatural growth twists living, corporeal creatures. Once

per day, an affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude or

Will save to resist the effect. (Creatures that have spell resistance

can choose not to drop it, but they still have the option to make

a saving throw if the signs effect overcomes their resistance.) If

the save fails, 1 Hit Die of the creature becomes corrupted; this

corruption can be removed only with a remove curse spell or effect

(cleansing all affected Hit Dice). As long as at least 1 Hit Die is cor-

rupted, the creature takes a 2 penalty on Charisma-based checks.

When all the creatures Hit Dice are corrupted, it transforms into a

ghastly aberration. It gains darkvision out to 60 feet, its Constitu-

tion score increases by 2, and its Charisma score is reduced by 4;

all other characteristics of the creature remain unchanged.

Overwhelming: As strong, but the DC of saving throws to resist

the spores, to remove blemishes, or to avoid corruption increases

to 25. Dead creatures rise a number of days after death equal to

their Hit Dice, becoming aberrations as described above.

The  overwhelming  aura  of  positive  energy  is  anathema  to

undead. Once per day, exposed undead are affected as if by a greater

turn undead attempt (as the Sun domain granted power, PH 188)

by a cleric whose level is equal to one-half the elder evils Hit Dice;

use  the  Charisma  modifier  of  the  elder  evil.  Undead  can  avoid

this effect by remaining underground (minimum 15 feet depth) or

within a stone or metallic vault whose walls are at least 15 feet thick,

provided all entrances to the chamber are sealed.

EL 10 (Faint Sign): Stories abound of healing springs and

mysterious adepts who control them. Throngs of people  ock

to the springs to be cured. The PCs are asked to investigate,

perhaps by concerned authorities suspecting chicanery, or by

a church or healing organization afraid of competition.

Upon arrival, the PCs quickly discover that the waters do

seem to have a curative effect, but the springs are plagued by

bizarre aberrations. The adepts at the healing springs are in

fact agents of the Malshapers. They watch the PCs and notify

Irthicax Vane about their activities and effectiveness.

EL 15 (Moderate Sign): Reports of ghosts circulate in

small cities. These mysterious entities seem to be doing no

harm, but weird events occur soon af-

ter their appearance. Strange rain falls

for several days, often from a cloud-

less  sky.  Doors  swell  and  burst  with

rats, roofs spawn spiders, and bats erupt

from the sides of temples. The visitors

are Malshaper observers who report the

PCs  investigations  to  Irthicax  Vane.

He warns his colleagues, who signal

him to take action.

At  the  same  time,  powerful

undead appear in the cities and

destroy the swarms in an odd

frenzy.  If  the  PCs  parley

with intelligent undead,

they  learn  that  the

sudden  swarms

are  a  sign  of  a

corrupt  form  of

positive energy.

Sages  might

ask the PCs to be

on  the  lookout  for

legends  about  the

appearance of a red

cometa  distant,

heretofore unknown

specimen has appeared

in the night sky.

EL 17 (Strong Sign):

The   ery  comet  is  now

easily visible at night and can even be discerned during

daylight. The undead are leaving the cities for unknown

destinations. Civil authorities want the PCs to monitor

this exodus and learn if the creatures are preparing for a

major assault.

Meanwhile, Irthicax Vane makes his  rst move against the

PCs, sending Malshaper agents against them while they are

on this spying mission. The agents (typically 4th-level rogues

and bards) are no match for the PCs, though their numbers

increase with every attack. They are disturbingly dis gured,

with distended jaws, prominent or horned brows, protruding

teeth, or extra tongues. After each attack, more of the strange

rain falls. Greater swarms appear, along with ravaged corpses,

some seemingly fallen from a great height.

After the last attack, the rains begin again. Then, an object

falls from the sky, forming a small crater nearby. Malshaper

corpses twitch with life, becoming aberrations that slither

to the craters edge. A few moments thereafter,

an impossible horror emergesan aboleth

mage (MM 9), which has enslaved the risen

Malshapers to serve as its legs. This vari-

ant aberration is capable of breathing air as

well as water.

EL 20 (Overwhelming Sign): Rag-

norra, blazing with a miles-long tail of

corrupted  essence,  slams  into  the

world. Most of her body is con-

sumed in the impact, which creates

a superheated crater 30 miles in di-

ameter. The explosion can be heard

a thousand miles away, and

the  tremors  are  strong

enough to knock down

buildings  a  hundred

miles distant.

The force and heat

of the collision spews

pulverized earth into

the atmosphere. This

material,  along  with

spores, ash, and frag-

ments of Ragnorras

body,  forms  a  tow-

ering  plume  visible

across the continent.

A twilight pall settles

over the world, and a

deadly,  corrupting  residue

constantly drifts down. Larger fragments of the elder evils body

spontaneously generate aberrations, some quite powerful.

The  surge  of  twisted  life  energy  corrupts  and  kills  the

living,  then  raises  them  as  aberrations  again  and  again.

Creatures that have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher become

Ragnorra has arrived to remake the world in her image

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

MALSHAPERS

Ragnorra has twisted life not just on the Material Plane, but

also on the Ethereal Plane and Plane of Shadow. A handful of

refugees from her prior ravages on these planes formed the

Malshapers, a cultlike group dedicated to helping the Mother

of Monsters perform her grotesque art. These fanatics believe

they  have  a  duty  to  guide  Ragnorra  to  every  suitable  world.

Scholars  note,  though,  that  they  never  target  worlds  on  their

home planes.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

The  Malshapers  watch  the  Astral  Plane  for  signs  of  Rag-

norras ascent. Once they detect movement, they scout out a

suitable location. They strew samples of native life along her

likely path, then redraw the astral runes to lure Ragnorra to the

target world.

Fleshwarpers (Lords of Madness 189) are common among

the Malshapers, as are psions uncarnate (EPH 149) and other

students of shunned arts that warp body and soul.

RAGNORRA IN EBERRON

Even the most ancient records of Ragnorra cannot agree

on whether she was cast from the world during the Age of

Dragons or the Age of Demons. Religious lore and astronomi-

cal evidence suggest that Ragnorra has made two passes over

Eberron already, with a light seeding of spores during the Age

of Giants and a heavier seeding during the Age of Monsters.

A few scholars even speculate that warforged sentience

resulted from Cannith experimentation with dormant spores

recovered from Xendrik.

Ragnorras likely landing site is an isolated region of

Khorvaire that teems with life, such as the Eldeen Reaches.

The collision would create a  restorm engul ng thousands

of square miles of forest.

RAGNORRA IN FAERN

Sages who specialize in extraplanar affairs have heard of

Ragnorra, and records tell of her oscillating path between

the planes. Tales recall a time of nothingness before the

misty realm coalesced and pushed aside something older

than creation and not of the gods: Ragnorra. Most who have

heard  the  legends  believe  she  has  never  touched  Faern

since then.

Ragnorra would likely fall into the Marsh of Chelimber

in the Western Heartlands. The collision would eject much

of the areas moisture into the upper reaches of the sky,

later to precipitate across the world as a mix of noxious rain

and spores.

RAGNORRA

As Ragnorra travels between the planes, she is a bloated mass

of corrupt positive energy made  esh. More than a mile in

diameter, trailing a cloud of proto-living matter over 200 miles

long, the Mother of Monsters  rst appears near her destina-

tion world as a  ery comet. Her collision nearly obliterates

her body, raining down fragments of herself. These seeds

corrupt life around the impact crater to form a membrane, an

extended aberration known as the worldskin (see page 102).

For a short time after her arrival, this monstrosity exists only

within the crater, but it will soon spread to encompass the

entire world and recreate it in Ragnorras form.

After impact, Ragnorra is but a fragment of her former

self. She begins her regrowth as something resembling a

great worm but soon transforms into something more to her

liking. Jellylike appendages droop at odd angles from a central,

amoeboid mass. Her skin ripples, blisters, and bursts, spread-

ing a stinking goo, but always regrows, becoming a bit larger

each time. Her form is always growing, always changing. One

feature remains constant: Translucent  esh in her midsection

reveals organs, blood vessels, and sinew arranged to depict a

gigantic, dreaming face.

By the time the world has been transformed into her idea

of perfection, Ragnorra is restored to her original size. Her

performance complete, she detaches from the surface, con-

tinuing on her path toward a new world to correct.

Corrupt Positive Energy Aura (Su) All undead creatures

within 15 feet of Ragnorra are automatically affected by a

turn undead attempt (CL 14th). Undead with 4 or fewer

HD are automatically destroyed. Three times per day as

an immediate action, she can widen this aura to a radius

of 30 feet for 1 round.

Ragnorras corruption infuses this aura. Any creature

that dies within its range rises as an aberration or prog-

eny of Ragnorra as described on page 100.

Impervious to the Divine (Su) Ragnorra is immune to all di-

vine spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural abilities.

Trample (Ex) Ragnorra simply rolls over anything in her way,

even her own spawn. A creature that does not make an

attack of opportunity against her can attempt a DC 47

Re ex save to take half damage.

Regenerate Worldskin (Sp) As a standard action, Ragnorra

can initiate regeneration in any worldskin feature (see

page 102). This ability has unlimited range. The growth

regains 50 hit points per round. See individual feature

descriptions for limitations on regeneration.

1,000 feet.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) Ragnorra is immune to all divine

divination spell effects.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

Spell to Spore (Su) Whenever Ragnorras spell resistance al-

lows her to resist a spell, she has a chance to capture its

magical energy. The caster of the spell must attempt a DC

26 caster level check. If this check fails, Ragnorra stores

the captured spells energy and can use it to grow a new

feature of the worldskin or regenerate an existing one.

The energy of each captured spell level contributes

5 hit points toward growing a new worldskin feature. For

example, accumulating six levels worth of spells would

allow Ragnorra to grow a vaporous abscess (30 hp) im-

mediately or save up the magical energy to produce larger

growths. Captured spell energy must be expended within

1 hour, or it fades away with no effect.

THE TRUE MOTHER

When Ragnorra has restored herself suf ciently, or when she

comes under attack, she sheds her current form and merges

with the neurotangle (page 102). In her True Mother form,

Ragnorra  is  impossible  to  attack  directly  and  gains  new

abilities. However, she is also weakened in some ways and

is vulnerable to attacks that target her connection with the

world. See encounter 73 (page 110) for details.

Space/Reach (Ex) When merged with the neurotangle, Rag-

norra is as big as the crater itself. She can form a pseudo-

(see page 102).

True Mother Chord (Ex) Ragnorras consciousness has

bonded with the neurotangle, and she cannot be attacked

directly. However, the True Mother chord links her life

energy to the worldskin and is vulnerable to attack. See

encounter 73 (page 110) for more information.

Bolt of Corruption (Su) Once per round as a standard action,

Ragnorra can  re a bolt of corrupt positive energy in a

line 90 feet long. Creatures in the bolts path can attempt

a DC 36 Re ex save to avoid it. Each round thereafter for

18 rounds, the affected creature can attempt a DC 36 For-

titude save to end the effect.

PROGENY OF RAGNORRA

Sentient beings corrupted or raised by Ragnorras overpowering

sign become aberrations known as progeny of Ragnorra.

Progeny of Ragnorra is an acquired template that can be

added to any living, corporeal creature that has an Intelligence

score of 6 or higher.

A progeny of Ragnorra uses all the base creatures statistics

and special abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to aberration. Do

not recalculate the creatures Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or

saves. Size is unchanged.

Special Attacks: Progeny gain Ragnorras skincasting and re-

generate worldskin special abilities (caster level equals Hit Dice).

See Ragnorras statistics for details.

Special Qualities: A progeny of Ragnorra has all the special

qualities of the base creature, plus darkvision out to 60 feet.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

If  the  base  creature  already  has  darkvision,  its  range  does

not change.

A progeny of Ragnorra is unable to act against Ragnorras wishes.

The elder evil establishes a telepathic link with the mind of her

children, much like that of a dominate monster spell. This link is

permanent and can be broken only by defeating Ragnorra.

Ragnorra always takes action to prevent attacks upon herself,

the True Mother chord (see above), or spawning spores (page

103) but otherwise leaves progeny to their own devices. When-

ever a progeny takes an action against her wishes, the elder evil

can override it with a command of her own as an immediate

action. A progeny can attempt to resist this control with a DC 39

Will save; a successful save allows it to act freely for 1 round.

Abilities: Adjust the base creatures abilities as follows: Con

+2, Cha 4.

Challenge Rating: As base creature +2.

The bolt corrupts the life force of living creatures, af-

fecting them as if by an empowered cure moderate wounds

spell (CL 20th). Undamaged creatures gain temporary hit

points instead; these temporary hit points last for up to 24

hours. Each round, the target creature gains 2d8+10 tem-

porary hit points or heals 2d8+10 points of damage until

it successfully saves or the effect ends. Undead creatures

instead take 2d8+10 points of damage per round.

The initial strike corrupts 2 Hit Dice of an affected liv-

ing creature, with 2 more Hit Dice corrupted in each subse-

quent round. The effects of multiple bolts of corruption are

cumulative, but a single successful save ends all effects.

When all a creatures Hit Dice have been corrupted, it

immediately transforms into an aberration as described

under twisted life (page 98). Sentient creatures become

progeny of Ragnorra.

IRTHICAX VANE

Fear engulfs the mind, en ames the body.

Great deeds are accomplished through

it. To tire of fear is to tire of life.

Irthicax Vane

Irthicax Vane lost everything to

Ragnorra. Years of meditation on

the horror and chaos of the Mother

of Monsters drove him to the edge

of madness. Now he serves her

horrible destiny.

GOALS

Irthicax Vane was a zenythri (MM2 171)

whose world succumbed to Ragnorra.

He stayed behind for a time, trying to

aid pockets of resisters or assist

stragglers  to  planar  por-

tals. Through his ascetic

training,  he  frequently

meditated  in  hiding  be-

tween missions, struggling

to understand the pure evil

that Ragnorra represented.

Ragnorras corruption even-

tually broke Vanes mind, which

has interpreted the horror in the form

of a deep revelation. Ragnorra is hid-

eous to behold, but she is awesome and, in her own way, perfect.

And is not perfection a higher goal than mere beauty?

Vane   nally   ed  his  ruined  world  and  joined  the

Malshapers. He took up residence on the Plane of Shadow,

unconsciously seeking a place whose physical nature mir-

rored his murky morality. He now sows the seeds of another

worlds destruction in a painful quest for perfection.

USING IRTHICAX VANE

Irthicax Vane is a tortured soul who has given up his core

zenythri values of perfection, law, and beauty. In their place

he has erected a complex set of rules and rationalizations to

let him live with a universe that would allow such a horrible

creature  as  Ragnorra,  and  live  with  himself  for  failing  to

stop her. This construction is rickety, though, and it could

collapse with the slightest nudge. Thus, he can serve several

functions as a story element in the campaign.

On  the  one  hand,  Vane  is  the  agent  of  evil  leading  the

Malshapers effort to guide Ragnorra to the campaign world.

He works behind the scenes, a rumored menace, secretly pull-

ing strings until the PCs  nally confront and defeat him on

the path to vanquishing Ragnorra.

Vane is also a failed hero, someone who could have deep

sympathy  for  the  plight  of  the  PCs.  Characters  might  see

Vane as a villain to be redeemed. If they try to contact him,

he  hesitates  at   rst:  He  wants  to  believe  they  have  a

chance, but has horri c  rst-hand knowledge

of how slim their chances are. The PCs need

to convince Vane that his instincts have al-

ways been correct; Ragnorra might be an

epitome, but of corruptionnever perfec-

tion. Even as a shaky ally, Irthicax Vane can

provide  detailed  information  about  the

practices and powers of this elder evil.

DESCRIPTION

Dark, curly hair falls perfectly into place, fram-

ing strong, handsome features of deep amethyst. The chiseled

body natural to a zenythri has been further tautened by the

disciplined life of a monk. The clearest difference be-

tween Irthicax Vane and other zenythri is his face.

The serenity typical of his kin has been replaced

with sorrow and anxiety, and his expression be-

trays the measured calmness of his words. In

a mad attempt to re ect Ragnorras twisted

beauty in himself, he severed his lips and

replaced  them  with   ukelike  creatures,

whose  wriggling  does  not  always  match

the words he speaks.

THE HEART

OF THE CRATER

The tactical encounters in this chapter occur after Ragnorra

has plummeted to earth in the campaign world. At the center

of a 30-mile-wide pit of scalded wasteland lie her remains.

The heart of the crater is shattered by cracks and  ssures, and

walls of obsidian have been thrown up by the impact.

Corrupted life is already teeming here, impossibly spring-

ing from the seared rock. This is the sign of things to come:

Ragnorras new world order.

KEY FEATURES

Ragnorra has started the process of regrowth, during which

she will increase from her current Gargantuan fragment to

a monstrosity a mile or more across.

The Neurotangle

The visible evidence of Ragnorras growth is the neurotangle,

a thick canopy of twisted, thorny  bers blanketing the crater.

This network extends Ragnorras senses and grows thicker

as she regains her strength.

The neurotangle canopy forms a dome rising about 80 feet

above the crater. It is at least 30 feet thick, extending to the

 oor in many places, and it spreads out past the crater edges

in a thin mat. At the heart of the crater, it forms a ceiling

resting on the obsidian walls caused by Ragnorras impact.

An eerie twilight  lls the space beneath the canopy, whose

matted  bers block many of the suns rays. Treat this condi-

tion as shadowy illumination (PH 164).

The Worldskin

Ragnorra is corrupting the essence of the worlds life. All

living things eventually become connected to her through a

massive network known as the worldskin. Pulsing veins run

through the earth, branching neural  bers lace the skies, and

gelatinous tendrils arc through the oceans. Cysts, abscesses,

spores and tumors dot this foul growth, extensions of the

elder evils power that create a variety of magical effects.

Because Ragnorra smashed into the world only recently,

the skin has not spread very far yet. The membrane stretches

across the crater  oor, and the elder evil can activate any

feature on its surface if she feels threatened. The PCs must

contend with its many hazards in addition to Ragnorra, who

lurks at its heart. She is unlikely to take notice of them unless

they enter her lair (see encounter 73). However, her guardian

progeny can also activate the skins features and regenerate

them for repeated use.

The features of the worldskin cover its surface thickly; the

encounter maps show speci c growths. Unless otherwise

speci ed, all effects produced by the worldskin are spell-like

abilities and use the effective caster level of the activating

creature. They require a standard action to activate.

Bioenergy Cyst: Hard, mineral-laced mounds jut from

the surface, thrumming with energy. On activation, a cyst

generates a line of lightning between itself and another cyst

within 100 feet, dealing 10d6 points of electricity damage. A

successful Re ex save halves the damage (DC 13 + activating

creatures Cha or Int modi er, whichever is higher).

Alternatively, a single cyst can be activated to create a  re

seeds effect as the spell (four grenades, 5d6  re damage each;

Weight: 

This glittering crystal band is much wider than a typical ring. Its

substance seems unearthly.

Now  Gutterang  attempts  to  keep  Irthicax  Vane  alive  and

uncorrupted by the touch of Ragnorra. It tries to preserve a link

to his lost world by reminding the monk of his honorable past.

The artifact believes that reclaiming their world from Ragnorras

corruption is still possible, with Vane as the catalyst. Though

such a hope seems impossible, the former weirds powers of

healing and guidance offer at least a chance.

Gutterang is an intelligent ring of protection +5 that has the

following special abilities.

Gutterang was once an elemental weird (MM2 90) that resided

on  Irthicax  Vanes  lost  homeworld.  Through  intricate  ritual

and arcane craft, it was bound in a crystalline ring to be Vanes

constant guide, freed from the limitation of its elemental pool.

However,  it  was  greatly  weakened  by  the  process  and  is  no

longer able to survive outside its glittering prison.

CL 20th); a Re ex save halves the damage (DC 16 + activating

creatures Cha or Int modi er, whichever is higher). Using

this ability deactivates the cyst, which must be regenerated

to full hit points before either ability can be used again.

A bioenergy cyst is Medium, about 6 feet tall and  lling

a 5-foot square, and provides cover. It has 50 hit points and

hardness 5. Cold and acid attacks deal normal damage.

Healing  Spore:  This  fleshy  lump  heals  injuries  to

creatures in contact with the worldskin. On activation, it

restores hit points to an adjacent living creature as a heal

spell (PH 239); the maximum amount healed is 225 points

if Ragnorra triggers the spore. Using this ability deactivates

the spore, which must be regenerated before it can be used

again. Unlike the heal spell, this effect can grant hit points in

excess of the creatures normal maximum. A creature whose

temporary hit points equal or exceed its normal maximum

is  corrupted  and  becomes  an  aberration  as  described  in

the twisted life sign (page 97). This healing can be resisted

with a successful Fortitude or Will save (DC 16 + activating

creatures Cha or Int modi er, whichever is higher).

A healing spore has 50 hit points and  lls a 10-foot square.

It provides soft cover (PH 151). Cold and electricity attacks

deal normal damage to it, preventing regeneration.

Spawning Spore: This mass of tissue, when activated,

spontaneously births an aberration to serve Ragnorra or

her minions. The new creature appears in a space adjacent

to the spore. Using this ability deactivates the spore, which

must be regenerated before it can be used again.

The creature spawned depends on the effective caster

level of the creature activating the spore, as set out in the

following table. If a result calls for a creature from a source

you dont have, substitute an equivalent aberration or group

of aberrations from another source.

Regenerating a spawning spore temporarily links it with

the life force of the controller. Dealing at least 75 points of

damage to a spore within 3 rounds of regeneration (even if

it has been since been activated) deals an equal amount of

lethal damage to the creature that regenerated it.

A  spawning  spore  has  75  hit  points  and   lls  a  10-foot

square. It provides soft cover. No form of damage overcomes

its regeneration.

Tentacular Boil: Dark, swollen pustules bubble from the

worldskin, and squirming growths wriggle within. On activa-

tion, a tentacular boil produces an Evards black tentacles effect

as the spell (PH 228). Using this ability deactivates the boil,

which must be regenerated before it can be used again.

A tentacular boil has 50 hit points and  lls a 10-foot square.

It provides soft cover. Fire and acid attacks deal normal

damage to it, preventing regeneration.

Vaporous Abscess: This pus- lled lesion releases an acid

fog effect as the spell when activated (PH 196). It automatically

regenerates 2 rounds after activation.

A vaporous abscess has 30 hit points and  lls a 5-foot square.

It provides no cover but does count as dif cult terrain (PH

148). Fire and electricity attacks deal normal damage to it,

preventing regeneration.

Obsidian Walls

These glassy walls stretch from the ground to the neurotangle.

Their smooth surface is dif cult to scale (Climb DC 25).

Random Encounters

In addition to the aberrations created by Ragnorra, mon-

strous beings are strangely attracted to her corrupt energy.

For every 10 minutes characters spend in the heart of the

crater, they have a 20% chance of encountering wander-

ENCOUNTER AREAS

In addition to the above hazards, Ragnorras crater challenges

explorers with unnatural terrain and bizarre creations.

A. Geyser Cave

The cave is hissing with live steam erupting from a pool cover-

ing the cave  oor. The pools water has been superheated by

the living lava in area B. The steam subjects creatures within

to extreme heat, dealing 1d6 points of damage per minute

with no save, in addition to other effects (DMG 303).

The scorched rock is charged with elemental power, which

acts as a barrier against the corrupt positive energy of the

crater and repels the craters twisted denizens. The chance

of a random encounter drops to 5% while the PCs remain

within the cave. If the PCs defeat the living lava, the cave

cools to habitable temperatures and forms a useful shelter.

The pool is charged with life-giving energy; a living creature

heals 1d6 points of damage per minute of immersion.

B. Living Lava (EL 11)

Ragnorras energy animated a pool of lava to create a Huge

elemental creature, which now resides within this cave. Treat

this being as an elder  re elemental (MM 99), although it has

the weight of an elder earth elemental. Each round it spends

away from its cave cools and slows it, reducing its speed by

5 feet. For every 10 points of cold or water damage dealt to

it, the living lavas speed drops by an additional 5 feet. If its

speed falls to zero, the life force animating it disperses, and

the living lava collapses into a pile of rock.

C. Mage Garden

This preternaturally still area is not a true garden but a confu-

sion of luxuriant plant growth (treat it as light forest terrain).

Odd, bulbous fruit grows from the tangle of strange-looking

trees. A successful DC 22 Search check reveals that many of

the plants are transformed creatures, including mind  ayers

and at least one aboleth.

Consuming a fruit from this garden can restore an arcane

spell slot of 8th level or lower, but at great risk. Anyone eating the

fruit must attempt a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Fail-

ing this check leaves the spell slot expended and also exposes

the eater to the corrupt life energy of the garden, requiring a DC

25 Fortitude or Will save. An eater who fails this saving throw is

immediately transformed into an immobile plant that re ects

that creatures form. Like a spell of the polymorph subschool

(PH2 95), this effect replaces the creatures normal game statistics

with that of the new form. The creatures Strength and Dexterity

scores drop to 0, and its Intelligence becomes 1. Its Hit Dice

and other ability scores remain the same.

A transformed creature can be returned to its normal form

by a successful dispel magic (caster level check DC 25) cast no

more than 3 rounds after the transformation. If the effect is

not dispelled within that time, nothing short of a miracle or

wish can restore the unfortunate being.

D. Breathing Tube

Regenerating Ragnorras body requires an immense metabolic

effort. To fuel this regrowth, she needs to breathe, so a respiratory

system is the  rst part of her new form to appear. An 18-foot-wide

tube has sprouted from the growing mass, connecting to what

will eventually be lunglike structures. This pipe stretches across a

wide crevasse that separates the Vile Home (see encounter 73)

from the rest of the craters heart. The neurotangle extends to

its upper surface, making passage dif cult and hazardous.

The  breathing  tube  protrudes  from  the  worldskin  and

allows relatively safe access to Ragnorras lair. PCs can enter

the pipe, though the inner surface is slippery and sensitive.

A successful DC 15 Balance check allows a character to move

at half speed. Failing this check by 5 or more causes the tube

to re exively twitch, pulling the tube opening inward and

dumping the intruders into the crevasse below (area E). A

successful DC 20 Re ex save allows a creature to brace itself

against the tube walls and remain inside.

E. Eruptive Abscess

The churning, tearing, and regrowth of the Scramble (see

area F) has torn a gash in the worldskin. An acidic suppura-

tion bubbles from it, spilling into a deep  ssure surrounding

Ragnorras  lair.  The  acid- lled  crevasse  forms  an  effective

moat, with only a patch of land to the east and the breathing

tube (see area D) offering access.

Although its out ow is restrained by this natural channel,

acid spurts from the abscess. Creatures 20 feet away from its

edge or nearer take 8d4 points of acid damage (Re ex DC 22

half) for each round they remain within the area. Those more

than 20 feet away but within 40 feet of the edge take 4d4 points

of damage instead, and the save DC drops to 17.

The crevasse has sheer walls that drop 50 feet, with acid

 lling it to a depth of 15 feet; it averages 5 feet across, but some

areas are wider. Scaling the walls requires a DC 25 Climb

check to move at one-quarter speed. A climbing creature is

exposed to spray damage, depending on its distance from the

acids surface, as described above. A creature that falls into

the acid takes 12d4 points of damage per round of immersion

(no save). Treat the churning  ow as stormy water (DMG 92);

a DC 20 Swim check is needed to reach the nearest wall.

As  a  side  effect  of  Ragnorras  corrupt  positive  energy,

spawning bubbles continually form within the acidic brew.

These spontaneously birth bestial aberrations such as carrion

crawlers, chokers, gibbering mouthers, and the like. As soon

as a bubble bursts, the spawn is immersed in the acid; most

such creatures dont survive long.

F. The Scramble

This  is  the  epicenter  of  the  worldskins  explosive  growth.

Here  the  surface  churns,  cracks,  oozes,  is  subsumed,  and

regenerates at a fast pace. Wrinkles the size of hills rise, fall,

and shift. Great wounds open, spouting noxious liquids over

the slopes, and quickly close again. Thus, travel across the

Scramble is a dif cult challenge.

PCs who attempt to cross the Scramble must  rst deal with

its stink, which becomes apparent within 20 feet of its edge.

Doing  so  requires  a  DC  27  Fortitude  save;  those  who  fail

are sickened while within the area and for 1d4 rounds after

leaving it. This condition imposes a 2 penalty on attack rolls

and damage rolls, saving throws, and checks. The penalty

is  doubled  for  creatures  that  have  the  scent  ability.  A  DC

18 Balance check is required in every round spent moving

through the Scramble. If this check fails by 5 or more, the

character stumbles and might be pitched into the acid- lled

crevasse below (see area E). A successful DC 18 Re ex save

allows a sliding character to arrest the descent.

Encounter Level 17

3 Blistered Souls

CR 15

SETUP

This area of the worldskin  lls the  ssures leading to

Ragnorras lair, forming a defensive perimeter. It is dotted

with cysts, abscesses, and spores. Three blistered souls

(B) also defend the area in the locations indicated on the

map: One is visible in the center, and the other two are

initially hidden from view behind ridges of writhing

plant growth.

You can mark the various worldskin features with coins:

Heads indicates a growth ready for use, and tails marks one

that must be regenerated. Remove coins from features that

are destroyed.

The players place their miniatures anywhere on the

southern edge of the map.

When the players have   nished arranging their min-

iatures, place the visible blistered soul and read:

The surface beneath your feet  inches at your step,

sometimes pitching like a ship in heavy seas.

Writhing, tangled plant growth forms thick ridges

extending into this wide  ssure. Open abscesses

hiss and spit foul liquids. Ahead, a lone  gure

shrieks, warning you away from this swath of

crawling skin. Its bones glow through its

translucent  esh.

When a character moves more than 15 feet from the

southern edge, place the second blistered soul in the

southeast corner and read:

A second  gure suddenly charges from behind

some wild growth.

Blistered souls are horrible creations of Ragnorras corrupt

positive energy, at its most intense so close to her resting

place. They resemble skinless humanoids with four arms

and oversized, grasping claws. Their bones are actually

glowing columns of positive energy, which animates their

flesh and gives them life. The extreme energies cause

tumors to erupt continually on their bodies. As a result,

blistered souls are in constant pain.

Regenerate Worldskin (Sp) As a standard action, a

blistered soul can initiate regeneration in any worldskin

feature within 220 feet. The growth regains 25 hit

points per round. See individual feature descriptions

for limitations on regeneration.

Revert to Spore (Sp) As a last-ditch defense, a blistered

soul can rejoin the worldskin by forming a spawning

spore (see page 103). The new spore appears in the

blistered souls former position. It is considered

expended and must be fully regenerated before it can

be activated. Casting dispel magic on the spore within 3

rounds of transformation destroys it and returns the

blistered soul to the surface. The blistered soul retains

any damage and ongoing conditions from before it

attempted to revert.

Skincasting (Sp) As a standard action, a blistered soul can

activate the ability of any worldskin feature within 220

feet.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

(B) Blistered Soul

Bioenergy Cyst, Healing Spore, Vaporous Abscess (World-

skin Features): See descriptions in the worldskin, page 102.

Shuddering Worldskin: The worldskin is highly sensitive

both to Ragnorras dreamlike thoughts and to violent events

(such as combat) on its surface. Each round the party is in this

area, a 1 in 6 chance exists that the skin twitches in response.

Destruction  of  worldskin  features  can  also  cause  such  a

reaction.

When the worldskin twitches, ripples up to 2 feet high race

across its surface, accompanied by a high-pitched keening. All

creatures on the skin must make a Balance check or lose their

footing, as summarized on the following table.

Ragnorras thought/combat in area

Bioenergy cyst destroyed

Healing spore destroyed

Balance Check DC

Writhing Plant Ridge: Corrupt positive energy flows along

these cracks in the worldskin, causing plants to rapidly grow,

die, and regrow. The ridges of plant growth average about 40

feet in height. Crossing or traveling along the ridge requires a

DC 20 Strength check each round; a successful check allows

the character to travel 5 feet in that round.

TACTICS

The blistered souls want to draw the PCs farther into the

area to expose the intruders to more worldskin features.

The charging one attacks the PCs for a round, then retreats

toward the center where the other awaits them. These two

blistered souls engage the PCs. Typically, one of them uses

its melee or ranged attacks while the other activates or

regenerates a nearby worldskin feature. The third remains

hidden, using regenerate worldskin and skincasting to aid

its fellows.

After the PCs enter this area, all the blistered souls (includ-

ing the hidden one) activate the vaporous abscesses near the

southern edge of the map to herd the party inward.

CONCLUSION

The hidden blistered soul assists its companions as much

as possible and does not reveal itself even if the other two

perish. In that event, it reverts to a spawning spore and waits

for the danger to pass.

If the PCs do not locate the hidden blistered soul, the  nal

encounter will be much more dif cult. It sends a mental call

to Ragnorra, who spawns two new blistered souls to replace

her losses. They lurk within Ragnorras lair to assist their

Mother from the shadows (see encounter 73).

The blistered souls collect their victims possessions and

embed them within the worldskin as offerings to Ragnorra.

Digging into the worldskin is possible, though disquiet-

ing, and takes 10 minutes per hole. Such activity is likely

to make the skin shudder (see Features of the Area), but

that  event  does  not  present  a  problem  unless  combat  is

occurring. A successful DC 20 Search check uncovers one

of the following items per hole: 712 pp; 820 pp; a scroll of

heal (CL 15th); a circlet adorned with rubies (3,300 gp); a

potion of protection from arrows 15/magic; a letter that scorns

the idea of Ragnorras minions breaching the defenses of

an aristocrats home, in the pocket of a bejeweled smoking

jacket (2,700 gp).

The hazards of the worldskin make this a more dif cult

combat than the creatures Encounter Levels indicate. If

the PCs defeat all three blistered souls, they gain 125% of the

normal XP for the encounter.

VANE ENGAGEMENT

ANE ENGAGEMENT

Encounter Level 19

SETUP

The worldskin is less sensitive here and has fewer growths,

but it features two new hazards: tentacular boils and

membranous  openings,  the  latter  not  of  Ragnorras

making.

Irthicax  Vane  (V)  is  hiding  behind  a  membranous

opening. At the beginning of the encounter, he uses his

rings ventriloquism ability to project his voice so that it

sounds as though it is coming from an opening closer to

the PCs.

You might wish to mark the various worldskin features

with coins: Heads indicates a growth ready for use, and

tails marks one that must be regenerated. Remove coins

from features that are destroyed.

The players place their miniatures within 10 feet of the

southeastern entrance.

When  the  players  have  finished  arranging  their

miniatures, read:

Moundlike growths dot the surface of this

canyons  oor, as well as what seem to be deep

wounds covered by strands of newly grown skin.

From the nearest of these openings a doleful voice

intones, Hope for your world is lost. There is

nothing more you can do. Leave now; keep hope

alive that you can defeat Ragnorra another time,

another place.

When Irthicax Vane attacks, read:

A quick blur of motion resolves into a black-and-

green-clad monk. His handsome, violet features

are horri cally marred. He explodes in a storm

of blows and then races toward one of the large

openings.

Vane waits for one of the PCs to come within reach of

his hiding place and strikes with his flurry of blows. He

then withdraws through a membranous opening into

a tunnel, tumbling if necessary. He is accomplished at

hit-and-run  tactics,  using  his  superior  speed  and  the

terrain to full advantage. He moves through the tunnels

to  new  attack  positions  on  the  surface,  and  he  never

fights  for  more  than  two  consecutive  rounds  before

retreating to a membranous opening and repositioning

for another attack.

Vane keeps up a running dialogue with the PCs during

this combat to keep them off guard and confused. While

in the tunnels, he projects his voice from other openings

with his ring of Locaris mouth, but in combat, he uses the

abilities of Gutterang and his ring of regeneration.

CONCLUSION

Irthicax  Vane   ghts  until  he  drives  the  PCs  away  or  is

defeated. However, if the PCs can convince him that they

stand a chance against Ragnorra, he can offer limited help.

He makes it clear that he will not directly engage Ragnorra

for any reason.

Vane can tell the PCs about the Mage Garden (see page

104) if they are not aware of it, as well as inform them of its

uses and pitfalls. He has also observed a potential weakness

of the Mother of Monsters: When other creatures destroy

spawning spores, she seems to be damaged.

The  PCs  can  dig  into  the  worldskin  here,  taking  a

move action to open a hole wide enough to enter. At the

DMs discretion, the bulettes digging might have already

unearthed  some  items  (discarded  by  Two-and-a-Half-

Brains as inedible). A successful DC 20 Search check

uncovers one of the following items per hole: 180 pp; an

aberration slaying arrow with the inscription May your

aim be as true as our love; a potion of greater magic fang +3;

a potion of magic vestment +5; and a gilded altar centerpiece

with three large rubies from a temple of St. Cuthbert

(13,400 gp).

Two-and-a-Half-Brains

TACTICS

Though he speaks scornfully, Irthicax Vane harbors deep

admiration for these indviduals who are unwilling to

abandon their world. He would rather avoid violence

and tries to convince the PCs to forgo their hopeless

quest. If they do not, he regretfully takes steps to deal

with them.

Two-and-a-Half Brains is a bulette (MM 30) who until

recently was in predator heaven: a crater full of rapidly

multiplying food. But consuming Ragnorras corrupted

growth transformed her, growing two new brains, so that

she now has an Intelligence score of 10. With sentience

came awareness, and with awareness came the fear that

something terribly wrong is happening.

The bulette is looking for a way out of this frighten-

ing place, and she needs help to do that. She is cowering

beneath the surface in a burrow (marked with B on the

encounter  map)  and  does  not  attack  the  PCs  except  in

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Vanes Hideout: Vane uses abundant step to move through

the solid rock wall sealing off this chamber from the rest of the

encounter area. Since he can use this ability only once per day,

he retreats here only to escape danger and must remain within

until the following day. Vanes simple camp consists of dried plant

growth for firewood, a cooking pot, a sleeping mat, and scrolls

of poetry describing his world before the arrival of Ragnorra.

The  southern  wall  is  porous  volcanic  rock  and  abuts  the

geyser cave (page 104). Water and steam slowly filter through

the stone to create a shallow, warm pool. A living creature im-

mersed in its waters heals 1d6 points of damage per minute.

Bioenergy Cyst, Tentacular Boil (Worldskin Features):

See descriptions in the worldskin, page 102.

Membranous Openings: These are areas of inflamed tissue

growing  over  wounds  left  by  Two-and-a-Half-Brains  as  she

burrowed her tunnels. The skin has almost healed, leaving small

openings for access. Treat a square containing a membranous

opening as difficult terrain. However, with a successful DC 30

Tumble check, a character can move through at full speed.

A membranous opening provides soft cover.

Ragnorra: Ragnorra is now dimly aware of the presence of

the PCs and is beginning to sense a threat, though she has dif-

ficulty telling creatures apart. Beginning in the third round of

the encounter, she acts randomly in self-defense. Roll 1d12

each round and consult the following table to see what action

she takes.

a  +3  bonus  on  these  checks,  due  to  the  beasts  increased

Intelligence and her eagerness to escape.

Once a character enters the area, read:

You face a bulette, but unlike one you have ever

seen before. Two translucent, gelatinous sacs bulge

on either side of her head carapace, each of which

holds a brain. In the bulettes eyes is a strange look

for a voracious eating machineit shows fear and

curiosity.

Tunnels:  The  bulettes  burrows  have  healed  since  they

were dug. They are now wide and high enough to accommodate

one Medium creature, or two if they are squeezing. Any new

tunnels the creature creates are large enough to accomodate a

Huge creature.

If the PCs can establish a friendly relationship with Two-

and-a-Half Brains, she can assist them in at least two ways.

She can burrow tunnels within or under the worldskin,

bypassing surface hazards and possibly giving the PCs an

advantage when they confront Ragnorra.

She  can  eat  worldskin  features  from  below.  Unlike  at-

tacks against features on the surface, such feeding goes

unnoticed by Ragnorra.

SETUP

As the PCs approach the heart of the crater, Ragnorra

becomes increasingly aware of them and accelerates the

process of healing and transformation. She is now on the

verge of assuming her True Mother form, which will take

the reshaping of the world to the next stage.

Ragnorras lair is more brightly lit than the rest of the

heart of the crater. The neurotangle above sparkles and

 ares with corrupt positive energy. Connecting it to the

worldskin is a cable of  esh as thick as a tree trunk: the

True Mother chord.

If the PCs have tamed Two-and-a-Half-Brains (see encoun-

ter 72), they can convince her to burrow into Ragnorras

lair.  The  tunnel  emerges  at  the  point  labeled  1  on  the

encounter map. The players place their miniatures in the

squares  surrounding  the  tunnel  opening.  In  this  case,

no blistered souls have spawned at the locations labeled

3 and 4, since Ragnorra (R) has not yet noticed the PCs

approach. Any blistered souls that the PCs did not destroy

in encounter 71 are in the area labeled 2 on the map and

are not immediately visible.

If  the  PCs  arrive  from  the  south  or  east,  the  players

place their miniatures within 10 feet of the appropriate

entrance. One blistered soul has spawned at the location

labeled 3; an additional blistered soul starts at location 4

if the PCs have arrived here after encounter 72.

You might wish to mark the various worldskin features

with coins: Heads indicates a growth ready for use, and

tails marks one that must be regenerated. Remove coins

from features that are destroyed.

When the players have   nished arranging their min-

iatures, place the appropriate blistered souls on the

map and read:

A massive cable is rooted in the  eshy surface,

glinting with crystal and metallic  bers. Midway

between the  oor and the neurotangle canopy

above, beams of light burst from its twined strands,

hinting at the gargantuan powers  owing through

the whole of the chord.

An enormous, sluglike being glides serenely along

the mottled  oor, brilliant sparkles of light

re ecting from its gooey surface. It turns toward

you with a sound like a thousand bows drawn too

tight. In its midsection, translucent  esh reveals

tumors and organs grotesquely arranged in the

image of a peacefully dreaming face. Through your

mind echo terrible screams of past violence,

impossibly woven into words: Welcome home,

children.

TACTICS

Ragnorra is preparing for the next stage of her regrowth.

She moves toward the True Mother chord to  nish her

preparations, rolling like a wave of sludge over spawn,

worldskin features, and PCs with equal unconcern.

If the PCs deal damage to Ragnorra, she does not retali-

ate directly at  rst; instead, she births aberrations from a

nearby spawning spore and regenerates it. After 2 rounds,

she directly attacks PCs who damaged her, striking and

making use of worldskin features as appropriate.

Blistered Souls: Any blistered souls that were spawned

in  response  to  the  PCs  intrusion  (at  locations  3  and  4)

attempt to defend Ragnorra. They activate worldskin fea-

tures to support other blistered souls in combat.

Blistered souls that escaped here from encounter 71

remain hidden in the corner labeled 2 and use their regen-

erate worldskin ability to heal and support Ragnorra and

the others.

Irthicax Vane: Even if the PCs persuade Vane to their

cause, the monk will not engage Ragnorra. However, he

does attack blistered souls, distracting his target and pre-

venting it from activating worldskin features. If Ragnorra

transforms into her True Mother form, Vane immediately

attempts to  ee through the eastern entrance.

Two-and-a-Half-Brains: The bulette does not want to be

here and would rather not  ght. The PCs can make Diplo-

macy checks to direct her to attack worldskin features,

but otherwise she is content to huddle in her tunnel.

CONCLUSION

After 9 rounds, or after Ragnorra has been reduced to 200

hit points or fewer, whichever comes  rst, she transfers

her life energy into her True Mother form.

Thick, twisting strands descend from the neurotangle,

closing access to the eastern and southern entrances. If

Two-and-a-Half-Brains has burrowed into the area, the

tunnel opening is not affected.

When  Ragnorra  assumes  her  True  Mother  form,

remove her   gure from the map and read:

With the sound of soft leather shredding,

Ragnorras skin unfolds like a blooming  ower.

Fountaining ichor spills to the  oor, but, rather

than spreading, it zips to the roots of the great cable

and is instantly absorbed.

The neurotangle above twists itself into the great face

of Ragnorra, dreaming no more. Cavernous eyes

regard you. The healing spores start to bubble and

spurt, sending red rivulets toward the gleaming

chord. Pain rakes the inside of your skull like eagle

talons as your bones and teeth thrum with a bass

tremor: Now. Forever.

REVISED TACTICS

Ragnorras consciousness now resides wholly in the neuro-

tangle. Her torpor has ended. She is eager to rid herself

of  the  pests  burrowing  in  her  flesh  and  to  recycle  the

material of her former lair into a new generation of cre-

ations. She attacks any creature within the area, even her

own progeny.

Once she has assumed her new form, Ragnorra is weaker.

She does not have access to fast healing or epic damage

reduction. She can no longer move, but she can create pseu-

dopods to strike anywhere within the heart of the crater.

Each round she can project up to two tendrils from the

neurotangle that quickly strike, then fall off and wither.

Alternatively, she launches a bolt of corruption whenever

she can catch two or more PCs in its effect.

Ragnorra cannot regenerate the worldskin until her form

matures, so she uses her skincasting sparingly. The process of

maturation requires some time, so she focuses  rst on any

threat to the True Mother chord.

Blistered Souls: If any remain, they give in to their pain

and attack the nearest creature, including one another.

Healing Spores: Intact healing spores start to flow

toward the True Mother chord at the rate of 5 feet per

round. Any that come into contact with it can use skin-

casting and regenerate worldskin as Ragnorra can, so they

can regenerate and trigger themselves to heal the chord

and the True Mother.

TRUE MOTHER CHORD

To fully mature, Ragnorra must draw corrupt energy from

the worldskin. The True Mother chord can barely contain

this   ow,  leaving  Ragnorra  vulnerable.  Three  weak  spots

are visible on the chord, from which project the brightest

beams of light. One is at ground level (AC 47), one is 30 feet

up (AC 42), and one is 80 feet up, at the junction with the

neurotangle (AC 32). The chord shares the damage reduction

and resistances of the True Mother.

Damaging  any  of  these  spots  tears  the  containment

strands of the chord, causing it to leak corrupt energy.

Each wound so in icted deals an extra 1 point of damage

per round to Ragnorra. Once the chord has sustained 50 or

more points of unhealed damage, or Ragnorra is destroyed,

it snaps. The resulting explosion deals 10d6 points of damage

to any creature climbing on or adjacent to the chord, and 5d6

damage within a 60-foot-radius burst.

If Ragnorra is defeated, she detaches the remnants of

her being from the world. Blistered souls and other spawn

instantly dissolve. The neurotangle begins to decay, and

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Bioenergy Cyst, Healing Spore, Spawning Spore, Ten-

tacular Boil (Worldskin Features): See the descriptions in

the worldskin, page 102.

Neurotangle:  If  the  PCs  attempt  to  escape  through  the

blocked entrances, they must deal with the neurotangle barrier.

See the description on page 102.

Pustule Pool: As bubbles rise and burst from this thick,

tarry pool, they release a stink of bile and infected flesh. But

in the center of each bubble, a clear liquid appears. Corrupt

positive energy infuses the fluid and can confer a temporary

benefit on a creature immersed in the pool. You might hint at

this  property  by  mentioning  that  the  liquid  resembles  the

healing waters of the geyser cave or Vanes hideout, or by calling

for a DC 21 Knowledge (arcana) check.

A living creature that enters the pool can attempt a DC 21

Fortitude or Will save (using the higher save bonus) during

each round of immersion. Each failure heals 2d8+10 points

of damage (or grants 2d8+10 temporary hit points) and cor-

rupts 1 Hit Die, as the effect of the twisted life sign (page 97).

A successful save negates the corruption and confers the effect

of a divine power spell (CL 20th).

True Mother Chord: The woven strands of its surface are

relatively easy to climb (Climb DC 18).

A  successful  DC  26  Knowledge  (arcana)  or  Knowledge

(religion) check reveals that the beams of light emanate from

weak spots.

the strands blocking the entrances fall away. Any PC who

became a progeny of Ragnorra returns to normal, though

befouled with the slime of dying aberrant growth.

oday, few question the fact that a priest need not

worship a god to work divine magiche needs

only faith in an idea. Yet what of the source of this

discovery? Who was the  rst to draw upon divinity

without the guidance of a god? Who knows the truth

of the  rst heretic, and of the serpent who exposed a secret

no god wished revealed?

From the Demonomicon of Iggwilv

Members of the Vanguard of Sertrous hold that their

demonic patron is the true father of the yuan-ti, yet

this ancient and exiledand deceaseddemon lord

is far more than that. If the dead demon rises, he

intends to retake his throne in the Abyss and spread

his heretical words across the planes.

BACKGROUND

The gods would have mortals believe that in the

beginning, they created the world. That they helped

shape the world is not in dispute, but they were far

from the  rst to cast their in uence across the Mate-

rial Plane. The aboleths lived in the primeval depths

before the  rst deity wrought life from primal clay.

The  elemental  races  established  vast  multiplanar

empires long before the  rst priest offered prayers

from a crude stone altar. And in the roiling deep of

the Abyss, demons had already conquered entire

planes before the advent of intelligent life on the Material

Plane. Most powerful among these ancient demons were

the obyrith lords.

Led by the Queen of Chaos, the obyriths waged murder

against the elemental Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Those who

refused to join the Queen were punished and imprisoned.

Obox-ob, then the Prince of Demons, withstood her call. In

a great war, the Queen defeated Obox-ob and crowned her

consort, Miska the Wolf Spider, the new Prince of Demons.

Yet when the Queens legions were defeated on the Fields of

Pesh, it was ironically the obyrith lords she had cast out or

imprisoned who survived. (Knowledge [history] or [the

planes] DC 30)

One such obyrith lord was Sertrous, a minor demon lord

associated at the time with parasites and crawling things.

Ever rebellious, Sertrous slew every demon that came to

his Abyssal lair to recruit him to the Queens cause. He

had little defense against the Queen herself, who quickly

grew  tired  of  his  insubordination,  destroyed  his  body,

and cast his essence into the gulf between planes as one

might cast aside a carcass. Yet this did not spell Sertrouss

doom. As his essence passed through the Material Plane,

Sertrous made a desperate grab at an anchor to prevent

his  passage  into  the  void  beyond.  All  he  found  was  a

lowly serpent, wallowing in the mire of a primeval fen.

(DC 35)

For untold centuries, Sertrous lived as a serpent. At

first, he was confined to that serpents body. As he healed,

his essence transformed the serpent into a new physical-

ity  that  took  on  the  madness  of  his  previous  demonic

form. Yet he retained serpentine featurespartially as a

disguise if agents of the Queen encounter him. Sertrous

watched from his fen as the mortal races grew civilized,

established  their  own  empires,  and  raised  temples  to

honor the gods. Sertrous grew jealous of their prosper-

ity and coveted the devotion mortals heaped upon the

gods. And so he waged war on them, plaguing these first

nations with armies of serpents and monsters from the

fen. (DC 40)

When the beleaguered mortals called upon one of their

deitys most powerful minions, the solar Avamerin, Ser-

trous claimed his  rst and greatest victory. Avamerin led

a great army into the fen to destroy Sertrous. The obyriths

minions were evenly matched with the angels, and in the

end only the obyrith and the angel survived to face one

another. The battle was intense, but in the end the solar

defeated the serpent. As Avamerin raised his sword and

prepared to strike the killing blow, Sertrous asked him a

simple question: Why serve your lord when his playthings

can gain the same strength of power through their own

will? Avamerin struck then, slaying Sertrous. He returned

to civilization with the obyriths head as proof of his triumph

and  spoke  to  the  nations  priests  of  the  demons  foolish

words. (DC 45)

Yet  in  spreading  these  words,  Avamerin  unwittingly

released a great secret. Scholars and priests puzzled over

Sertrouss dying words and made an incredible discovery:

One need not worship a god to gain the power of divine

magic. Rather than worship a god, a cleric could worship

an ideal and gain the same reward. He could worship the

mountains, or the sky, or the act of war, or himself. He

could even worship a slain obyrith lord. Avamerin saw

this plague of godless priests thrive and was powerless to

stop it. The solar realized his error, and when he confessed

to his lord, he was stripped of his rank and reduced to a

planetars status.

Enraged,  Avamerin  cast  aside  his  servitude  and  stole

Sertrouss head, claiming that the dead demon was wiser

than the gods. The gods recoiled and took from Avamerin

his beauty. If he would ascribe such value to a serpents

words, he would be one with them. The gods gave him the

visage of a snake and banished him from heaven. Yet the

damage had been done. The angel became the  rst heretic,

and he devoted the rest of his existence to serving the one

who had opened his eyes. In time, the devotion of Avamerin

and those he recruited to his Vanguard would be enough

to restore Sertrous to life and prove what the fallen angel

had come to believe was the truth beyond the lies of faith.

(DC 50)

new zealot takes up the cause and leads a new army on the

march. (Knowledge [history] DC 30)

Although the armies through the years rose from different

regions,  they  all  shared  similar  tactics  and  compositions.

Without variation, the Vanguard is led by yuan-ti but  lled

with  enslaved  or  dominated  minions.  When  its  numbers

reach  the  right  point,  its  leaders  unleash  hordes  of  trans-

formed and corrupted slaves and minions in a wave of murder

and mayhem. (DC 35)

Although the leaders of the Vanguard claim to follow the

teachings  of  an  obscure  demon  lord  named  Sertrous,  the

Prince of Heretics has remained dead since he was defeated

long  ago.  The  rank-and- le  soldier  in  the  Vanguard  does

not know this. The teachings of Sertrous come to the lead-

ers through the decapitated head of their demonic patron,

preserved in a secret reliquary. (DC 40)

The first Vanguard army was led by Sertrous himself,

who  marched  upon  his  neighbors  in  a  rage  fueled  by

jealousy. He coveted their cities, their accomplishments,

and most of all the adoration the citizens heaped upon the

gods. Sertrous wanted to be worshiped and held in awe,

and the only way he could accomplish this was through

conquest. He was slain by the angel Avamerin, who, it is

rumored, later fell victim to the Vanguard and was himself

slain. (DC 45)

Sertrouss true reasons for waging war on the Material

Plane are more than mere jealousy. He wishes to return

to the Abyss and reclaim his realm now that the time of

the Queen of Chaos is past. Although he is dead, his spirit

persists both in his severed head and in the rebellious will

of Avamerin, who serves as the leader of the Vanguard in

Sertrouss absence. With each war, the souls of those who

die in the Vanguards service are drawn into the Abyss to

await their masters return, while at the same time the armies

and resources of his Material Plane enemies are depleted.

When his army of slithering petitioners in the Abyss is great

enough, he shall return to life and reclaim his throne as a

demon lord. (DC 50)

SERTROUS

IN THE CAMPAIGN

Avamerin remains hidden, a shadow leader of the Vanguard.

When one army is defeated, he waits for a few centuries

to start again, choosing a new champion to woo followers

away from the yuan-ti gods and to lead an army against

the world. As a result, the latest Vanguard can come from

anywhere in the campaign world where the yuan-ti are

active. The Serpent Reliquary itself, where Avamerin dwells

and Sertrouss head is kept, exists in its own dimension

accessed by a portal placed in a remote location in the

campaign world.

GOALS

The  Vanguard  of  Sertrous  is  an  ancient  organization  of

murderers and raiders that has risen and fallen over the mil-

lennia. Thousands of years ago, these nihilistic yuan-ti, whose

priests taught that worship of the gods was unnecessary to

gain divine power, surged from a trackless fen to lay siege

to the surrounding nations. The Vanguard was defeated, but

its teachings proved immortal. Every few hundred years, a

TIMELINE

are hired to investigate, and they discover that the merchant

has fallen under the sway of the yuan-ti that inhabit the ex-

tensive catacombs below the building. The PCs rescue the

merchant (who becomes a supportive patron for them) but

discover that these

yuan-ti cultists re-

port  to  someone

called  Seghulerak

and  openly  mock

the traditional yuan-

ti deities.

EL  9  (Faint

Sign): Seghulerak

seizes  control  of

the ancient yuan-

ti  temple-city  of

Veshlivenk  in  a

southern  jungle

and  establishes  a

network of serpent-

gates,  freestanding

portals  that  allow

the  Vanguard  of

Sertrous to move be-

tween seven linked

temples  scattered

throughout  the

world.  One  such

temple  is  located

in the large swamp

beyond  the  prio-

ry.  Serpents  and

snakes  grow  more

common,  and  the

PCs  are  hired  to

 nd out whats caus-

ing so many snakes

to  slither  out  of  the

swamp.  They  prevent  the  Vanguard  from  setting  up  this

temple as a staging point for a major simultaneous yuan-ti

invasion, but discover that there are six other temples.

EL 13 (Moderate Sign): The infestation continues. The

PCs might take out several yuan-ti temples and their ser-

pentgates, but not enough to prevent the invasion. The PCs

must race against time to defend a city from the Vanguard,

which  approaches  from  three  directions  in  a  murderous

swath. At the end of this encounter, the PCs face their  rst

golothoma demon, and its defeat proves to be a key point

in the battle.

EL  16  (Strong

Sign):  Encounters

with golothomas, half-

 end sixteen-headed

hydras,  and  other

serpentine  horrors

become  common-

place despite victory

against the Vanguard.

The  PCs  discover

that  the  yuan-ti  are

based  in  the  temple-

city  of  Veshlivenk

and must travel there

and destroy the pri-

mal  serpentgate  if

they  wish  to  stop

the  serpent  infesta-

tion  and  prevent  an

even larger invasion.

At  the  end  of  this

battle, they face and

defeat  Seghulerak,

whom  they  believe

to  be  the  leader  of

the  Vanguard.  Her

slain body vanishes

to  parts  unknown,

leaving  behind  a

mound of dead, head-

less snakes.

EL  19  (Over-

whelming  Sign):

Despite the destruction

of Veshlivenk, serpents continue to overwhelm the world.

Intelligence gathered at Veshlivenk reveals the existence

of  the  Serpent  Reliquary,  and  that  Seghuleraks  body  has

reappeared  there.  The  PCs  must  discover  the  Reliquary,

defeat  Seghulerak  again,  and  discover  the  true  nature

of the Vanguard of Sertrous (encounters 81 through 83,

pages 122127).

SIGN: INFESTATION

The  earth  vomits  torrents  of  snakes  and  serpentine  crea-

tures.  At  first  these  infestations  consist  of  normal  snakes,

but  as  the  infestation  grows,  monstrous  creatures  such  as

chaotic evil nagas, hydras, and even mariliths become more

common.  As  the  sign  grows  more  potent,  the  infesting

serpents become increasingly more deformed. Some might

have multiple heads, others are inside out, and some might

have no head or tailtheyre simply a mass of coils with no

end or beginning.

The  following  guidelines  apply  to  encounters  involving  the

PCs.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Faint: The check frequency is once a week. The Encounter

Level of the infestation should be 2 lower than the average

party level.

Moderate: As faint, but the check frequency increases to once

a day.

Strong:  The  check  frequency  increases  to  once  every  1d4

hours. The EL should be equal to the average party level.

Overwhelming:  The  check  frequency  increases  to  once  an

hour,  and  the  chance  of  encountering  wandering  monsters

increases to 20%. The EL should be equal to the average party

level + 2.

SERTROUS IN EBERRON

The teachings of Sertrous have a subtle effect in Eberron,

since the deities of this world are much less invested in the

workings of their followers. Clerics who gain their powers

from personal faith rather than service to a deity are common,

and as a result the heretics of the Vanguard can ef ciently

conceal the nature of their beliefs.

The Serpent Reliquarys entrance is located on a remote

island in the northeastern Lhazaar Principalities. Far enough

out of the way that it serves no real naval role, this nameless

rock is little more than 300 yards in diameter and hosts  ocks

of deformed wyverns in its crags. Many pirates have buried

their treasures here, but to date none have discovered the

shallow cavern that hides the secret door that opens into the

Reliquarys entrance.

SERTROUS IN FAERN

Faern has a large number of deities, and even those who

choose  not  to  worship  a  deity  have  speci c  fates  to  look

forward  to  in  the  afterlife.  As  part  of  the  world-changing

menace, those who worship Sertrous and do not venerate

the  gods  do  not  travel  to  the  Fugue  Plane  when  they  die.

Although  technically  these  souls  are  counted  among  the

False, they escape punishment in the City of Judgment and

pass directly into Sertrouss realm in the Abyss to await his

return.  Worshipers  of  Kelemvor  who  know  of  this  hold  a

special hatred for the Vanguard as a result.

The  entrance  to  the  Serpent  Reliquary  is  hidden  far

from traditional yuan-ti dwellings to minimize accidental

discovery. This entrance is an out-of-place standing stone

carved of deep purple porphyry protruding from a low

mound of earth on the far side of the Lake of Tears from

Castle Perilous. The standing stone has been the obses-

sion of several bickering orc tribes for many centuries,

although  none  of  them  know  of  the  secret  ritual  that

causes  the  stone  to  split  apart,  forming  a  shimmering

archway that transports those who pass through into the

Reliquarys entrance.

SERTROUS

When  resurrected,  Sertrous  appears  as  an  immense

nightmare of slimy coils and shining scales. His aspect is

serpentine only because that is the closest analogy the fragile

mortal mind can assign to his writhing bulk, a sight that can

instill a paralyzing fear of all things snakelike.

Sertrouss body is a sickly green with a pale yellow belly.

Winding  red  stripes  run  down  his  length  like  rivers  of

blood.  Two  serpentine  arms  split  off  his  central  body  at

approximately his midsection, each ending in a three-taloned

claw. His head is that of a deformed snake with dead black

eyes, its jaws split so that when it opens its many-fanged,

 ve-jawed maw it looks like the bloom of an unholy and

monstrous  ower.

Sertrous  once  dwelt  on  the  bleak  and  poisonous  380th

layer of the Abyss, a realm of fens and black bottomless lakes

called Hungry Tarns. As his power grows, this realm becomes

increasingly infested with serpentine menaces.

True Seeing (Su) As the true seeing spell; continuous; caster

Form of Madness (Su) Any creature within 60 feet that ob-

serves Sertrous must attempt a DC 30 Will save. Failure

indicates the victim develops an overwhelming fear of

snakes and serpentine creatures (including hydras, golo-

thomas, yuan-ti, and Sertrous himself).

As long as a serpentine creature is in sight, the victim

is distracted and takes a 4 penalty on Will saving throws.

It also takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls against these

types of creatures. In the  rst round of combat against a

serpentine creature, the victim must make a DC 28 Will

save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d6 rounds.

Heal or greater restoration can cure the effect if the

caster succeeds on a DC 30 caster level check. Miracle

or wish automatically cures the condition. A creature that

succeeds on this save is immune to Sertrouss form of

madness for 24 hours. Blindness is no protection against

Sertrouss form of madnesshis presence is an affront

to all  ve senses. This is a mind-affecting fear ability that

does not affect chaotic evil outsiders or yuan-ti.

Poisoners Breath (Su) Sertrouss breath  lls a 240-foot-ra-

dius spread around him. Any creature that breathes this

foul air must succeed on a DC 33 Fortitude save or be

sickened for 1 round. This breath suppresses any immu-

nity to poison a victim possesses for as long as it remains

within the area plus an additional 2d6 rounds after it

leaves the area.

Tongues (Su) As the tongues spell; continuous; caster level

20th.

Impervious to the Divine (Su) Sertrous is immune to all divine

spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural abilities.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, Sertrous must hit

a Huge or smaller opponent with his bite or tail attack.

He can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of opportunity. If he wins the

grapple check with a tail attack, he establishes a hold and

can constrict. If he wins the grapple check with a bite at-

tack, he establishes a hold and can souldrink the victim in

the following round.

Souldrink (Su) If Sertrous starts a round grappling a foe with

his bite and maintains his hold by making a successful

grapple check, he drinks away a portion of the victims

soul, dealing 3d6 points of Charisma drain. A creature

cannot be drained below a Charisma score of 1 by this

ability, but once the creature reaches that point, its align-

ment becomes chaotic evil and it immediately becomes

dominated (as if by dominate monster at caster level 23rd)

by Sertrous.

Poisoned Whisper (Su) Once per round as a standard action,

Sertrous can attempt to whisper to any creature within

240 feet. Sertrous must be aware of the target creature

and have line of effect.

The targeted creature can negate the poisoned

whisper by mak-

ing a DC 28

Will save.

the whisper functions as a suggestion spell on the target

(caster level 23rd). One minute later, the poisoned whis-

per tears through the victims mind, forcing a second DC

28 Will save. Failure on this save indicates that the vic-

tim is subject to a modify memory effect that erases the

victims memory of whatever suggested action he might

have just done. If the victim was unable to complete the

suggestion before this effect occurs, he must still carry

out the suggestionhe just believes the suggestion was

his own idea.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) Sertrous is immune to all divine

divination spell effects.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

SEGHULERAK

Your gods are dead, and their works are lies perpetuated by

priests too timid to reveal what they know to be true. Accept the

truth of Sertrous, and you may yet  nd absolution beyond your

imminent death.

Seghulerak, high priest of Sertrous

Although most of the elder evils are anathema to all things

divine, Sertrous encourages priests to draw upon faith

provided  they  do  not  keep  faith  in  the  gods  they  know.

Better to draw faith from the lust for murder or the desire

for domination, or best of all, to draw upon the demon lord

himself. Clerics of Sertrous can choose their domains freely

as if they were clerics devoted to an ideal, although

most choose Destruction and Trickery.

The  yuan-ti  abomination  Seghulerak  is  the

latest  gurehead of the Vanguard. She was forced

to  ee for her life from the temple-city of Veshlivenk due to

her heretical belief that the serpent deity Merrshaulk had

died and his priests were covering up his death to retain

their positions of power. The  rst hereticAvamerinfound

Seghulerak broken and dying in a swamp. After saving

her and gaining her allegiance, he aided the yuan-ti in her

triumphant return to Veshlivenk, where she slaughtered the

priests and established the city as the capital of the Vanguard

of Sertrous.

GOALS

Seghulerak wants to sow discord and serve Sertrous, and

she has quickly come to enjoy her power as the general of

the latest incarnation of the Vanguard. She is one of the few

members of the group who knows that Sertrous is dead and

that Avamerin is its true leader, and she takes great delight

in that hidden knowledge. She wants little more than to see

Sertrous resurrected from the dead and secretly hopes that

for her service she might ascend to a position of power as his

consort in the Abyss.

USING SEGHULERAK

The  PCs  shouldnt  encounter  Seghulerak  until  late  in  the

campaign, but they should know her name long before then.

The members of the Vanguard hold her in great reverence.

Many of her commanders carry small icons of her as tokens,

and some fantasize that if they succeed in their missions,

theyll be selected as a consort. Vanguard members who can

create golems invariably use her image as the model for their

creations. By the time the PCs  nally reach Veshlivenk and

 ght Seghulerak, she should be established as a source of

yuan-ti obsession and adoration.

DESCRIPTION

Seghulerak is much more lithe and streamlined than the

standard bulky yuan-ti abomination, an appearance that

masks her actual strength and power. Her serpentine body

is bright crimson with black coils along its length, and her

underbelly glows a  ery orange. Her head is that of a sleek

mamba with large emerald eyes, and her arms are slender

and decidedly feminine. She wields a spiked chain crafted

to look like a barbed metallic skeletal snake with a fanged

skull at both ends. Her full plate and shield likewise display

snake motifs, and her crownlike helmet features  ve snakes

coiling upward in fanged array.

Improved Grab (Ex) Seghulerak can make a grapple check

without provoking attacks of opportunity if she hits a

Large or smaller creature with her bite. If she establishes

a hold, she can constrict.

Aversion (Sp) Seghulerak can create a compulsion effect

targeting any creature within 30 feet. The target must

succeed on a DC 23 Will save or gain an aversion to

snakes for 10 minutes. Affected creatures must stay at

least 20 feet from any snake or yuan-ti, alive or dead; if

already within 20 feet, they move away. A subject unable

to move away, or one attacked by snakes or yuan-ti, is

overcome by revulsion that reduces the creatures Dex-

terity score by 4 points until the effect wears off or the

subject is no longer within 20 feet of a snake or yuan-ti.

This ability is otherwise similar to an antipathy spell

(CL 16th).

Contingent Conjuration (Ex) If Seghulerak takes any damage

or ability damage, a summon monster VIII spell immedi-

ately summons 1d3 babaus to aid her.

Produce Acid (Sp) Seghulerak can exude acid from her body,

dealing 3d6 points of acid damage to the next creature

she touches, including a creature hit by her bite. If she is

grappling, constricting, or pinning a foe when she uses

this power, her grasp deals 5d6 points of acid damage.

The acid becomes inert when it leaves her body, and she

is immune to its effect.

Alternate Form (Sp) Seghulerak can assume the form of a

viper (size Tiny to Large) as with a polymorph effect, yet

she does not gain any hit points for changing forms.

Chameleon Power (Sp) Seghulerak can change her coloration

to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

Extended Summoning (Ex) The durations of Seghuleraks

summoning spells are doubled.

Improved Ally (Ex) Seghulerak can make a Diplomacy check

when casting any planar ally spell. If she adjusts the crea-

tures attitude to helpful, the creature works for 50% of

the standard fee as long as the task is not one that goes

against its nature.

Planar Cohort Seghulerak has used greater planar ally to call

a marilith demon named Zuvexus to serve as her cohort.

The mariliths statistics appear on page 125.

GOLOTHOMA

Its ravenous hunger is not blunted by the lack of a mouth, and

this fact makes the spectacle of a golothoma feeding frenzy all the

more horri c.

From the Demonomicon of Iggwilv

Although the obyrith demons are nowhere near as numer-

ous as they were in the Age before Ages, enough survive to

this day to give a horri c hint to the variety of shapes these

prehistoric demons held. Golothomas are most common in

the lightless tunnels of the Writhing Realm of Ugudenk, the

177th layer of the Abyss. Their association with Sertrous is

partially accidental, owing to a coincidental likeness of

form. As the Vanguard nears its goal and the abandoned

Abyssal layer of Hungry Tarns grows full with petitioners,

golothoma  demons  become  increasingly  common  in  that

realms poisoned bogs and bottomless lakes.

GOALS

Although golothomas understand a few words in Abyssal,

they are only barely intelligent enough to belch them out

in  a  mockery  of  conversation.  They  are  hardly  more  than

horri c predators driven only by a ceaseless hunger to feed,

not from any biological requirement but from a deeper need

simply to consume the bodies of other creatures.

USING GOLOTHOMAS

As a campaign against the Vanguard of Sertrous progresses,

you can use golothomas as guardian monsters or simply as

part of the infestation of serpents that heralds the resurrec-

tion of the Prince of Heretics. They serve well as additional

monsters in battles with more intelligent foes, and are an

excellent choice for monsters resulting from Vanguard agents

casting gate or similar spells.

DESCRIPTION

A  golothoma  has  a  vaguely  serpentine  body,  although  its

 anks bulge in odd places and horns protrude from random

locations along its knotted length. Its tail rises up into the

air like a scorpions, and even without a stinger it drips with

black, steaming acid. The creatures face is little more than a

single yellow snakes eye. Arrayed around this eye in a radial

pattern are its  ve insectoid arms, each with three joints and

covered with horns and ridges. Each arm ends in a nest of

talons and claws. The creatures shadow is misshapen and

doesnt match its body.

must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast spells.

Its re exive desire to accept shadow causes it to take a

4 penalty on saving throws against spells of the shadow

subschool and against a golothomas acid and ravenous

shadow abilities. Shadows and other creatures from the

Plane of Shadow gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against

such a creature.

This madness can be cured by heal, greater restora-

tion, miracle, or wish. A creature that succeeds on the

save is immune to that particular golothomas form of

madness for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability that

does not affect chaotic evil outsiders.

Acid (Ex) A golothomas tail runs with thick, sticky coils

of black shadow. A golothoma deals 8d6 points of acid

damage to any creature it strikes with its tail, attacking

with a melee touch attack. A creature struck by this at-

tack must succeed on a DC 28 Re ex save, or some of

this shadow

clings to it

and deals

another 4d6

points of acid

damage at the

start of its next

turn.

Dimensional Reach

(Su) A golotho-

ma can reach be-

tween dimensions

to strike at distant

targets with its

claws. This abil-

ity allows a

golothoma to

make ranged

attacks with

its claws. These

attacks have a

range increment

of 120 feet, up to

a maximum of fve

range increments.

They are otherwise

treated as thrown

weapons. A go-

lothoma can mix

its attacks between

melee and ranged as it

wishes, and it does not

provoke attacks of opportu-

nity when using its dimensional

reach.

Golothoma

Ravenous Shadow (Su) A golothoma has no mouth. It feeds

by absorbing  esh through its writhing shadow. Any

creature within the golothomas reach might fall into the

creatures shadow. A DC 27 Re ex save allows a creature

to avoid the shadow for that round. A creature that moves

through a golothomas space gets no saving throw to

avoid the shadow. Failure indicates the creature takes

1d12 points of Constitution drain.

A golothomas shadow exists despite the surrounding

lighting. In fact, in complete darkness, its more dif cult

to see the shadows boundaries, and Re ex saves made

to avoid it take a 4 penalty. A golothomas ravenous

shadow has no effect on a creature that doesnt have a

Constitution score.

SERPENT RELIQUARY

The Serpent Reliquary is the heart of the Vanguards pres-

ence in the multiverse. Built around an extradimensional

cube trapped between the planes, the Reliquary was con-

structed by the fallen planetar Avamerin to serve as a place

for him to rest between incursions and as a place to safely

keep Sertrouss head secure from those who would attempt

to destroy it.

KEY FEATURES

The layout of the rooms within the Serpent Reliquary dis-

rupts most mapping attempts. This complex is constructed

around a tesseract, a structure whose sides connect in ways

that are unfathomable in a three-dimensional world.

The chambers within the complex are aligned to the dif-

ferent sides of the tesseract, producing seemingly impossible

(at  least,  from  a  three-dimensional  point  of  view)  room

connections within the complex. Arrows on the

map show what other rooms can be reached

from each area.

Each  of  the  complexs  sections

is  located  on  its  own  demiplane,

separate  from  but  contained

wholly by the complex itself.

The ranges of all divinations

cast within the complex are

limited to the area where the

spell is cast.

DEFENSES

Although the walls in-

side  of  each  complex

are made of magically

enhanced stone, they

are  still  subject  to

effects  and  damage

as  normal.  Where

faces  of  the  tes-

seract

touch,

door-shaped portals

allow movement be-

tween them. Passage

through these portals

feels  no  different  from

moving through a doorway,

but  a  creature  under  the  effect  of  di-

mensional anchor cannot pass through.

Physical objects can pass with ease, and a creature in one area

can observe events in an adjacent area by looking through

an open portal.

Air within the complex constantly refreshes, and rooms

are humid and warm.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

The following locations  correspond to those indicated on

the Reliquary map.

A. Entrance

No matter how one travels to the Serpent Reliquary, the

traveler  nds himself stepping through a portal and emerg-

ing into this grandly appointed hall. The polished floor

bears the symbol of Sertrous (a coiled but headless snake

wrapped  around  and  through  a  snakes  skull),  as  do  the

immense tapestries and banners that hang from the halls

100-foot-high ceiling.

The approach to the double doors that lead to area B is

warded by a forbiddance spell (CL 15th, Will DC 28) keyed

to chaotic evil. As soon as a creature of any alignment other

than chaotic evil enters this area, the snake statues scat-

tered throughout areas B through G begin hissing loudly

in alarm, alerting the entire Reliquary to the presence

of intruders.

B. Grand Temple of Sertrous (EL 20)

The leaders of the Vanguard meet in this grand chamber

to hear the teachings of their leader, to offer prayers and

offerings to Sertrous, and to present captured treasures and

religious texts. As the central chamber, it also serves as the

primary point of defense. When the PCs reach this chamber,

they are confronted with a band of Vanguard assassins and

Seghulerak herself (see encounter 81, page 122).

This room provides the only entrance to the Inmost Vault

(area  H),  an  entrance  that  normally  doesnt  even  exist.

Carved into the ceiling of the chamber is the visage of an

immense serpent. It can be commanded to open through

the  use  of  Dark  Speech,  by  a  miracle  or wish,  or  with  a

password that can be found in area E. When opened, the

jaws reveal a stone shaft leading up through the ceiling.

No stairs or other means of ascent is apparentflight (or

Seghuleraks air walk) is the standard method of travel up

to area H above.

In this chamber and in areas C through G stand statues

of  coiled  serpents.  These  statues  function  as  an  alarm

system and as guardians. A statue can make one attack of

opportunity per round against a creature of any alignment

other than chaotic evil that is within 5 feet, striking with a

single bite attack.

C. Assassins Hold

The assassins who guard the Reliquary from intrusion sleep

and eat in this chamber. If the PCs invade the Reliquary

without Seghulerak having a chance to prepare for them, the

six Vanguard assassins begin here instead of in area B.

The secret door that leads to area G can be discovered with

a DC 30 Search check and is protected by a symbol of insanity

(Will DC 30).

pqs

D. Pits of the Forsaken (EL 19)

The most important prisoners are kept in these pits, hateful

holes that remain perpetually half  ooded and infested with

snakes. The warden of this prison is Seghuleraks cohort, a

powerful marilith demon named Zuvexus (see encounter 82,

page 124). Zuvexus wears a ring of airwalking (see sidebar) that

allows her to move around the room with ease.

E. Heretics Walk

This towering chamber is lined with bookshelves, upon

which rest the collected lore stolen during dozens of crusades

against the mortal realm. Many books are badly damaged, but

they all share one themethey are religious works stolen

from countless razed temples. Characters who spend enough

time in research can uncover the solution to any remaining

mysteries that still vex them about the Vanguard, Sertrous,

and his history. The password for operating the portal in

area B to the Inmost Vault can be found here with a DC

30 Knowledge (the planes) check made after 1d6 hours of

research. As in area C, the secret door that leads to area G can

be discovered with a DC 30 Search check and is protected

by a symbol of insanity (Will DC 30).

F. Apostles Chambers

Seghuleraks chamber is decadent, with a haphazard decor

of stolen artwork and furnishings from two dozen nations.

Seghulerak spends increasingly little time here, kept busy

with the work of leading the Vanguard to triumph. As in

area C, the secret door that leads to area G can be discovered

with a DC 30 Search check and is protected by a symbol of

insanity (Will DC 30).

G. The Treasury

This room should represent the greatest single treasure

that the PCs find during their entire adventuring career.

The wealth here has accumulated over dozens of crusades

and consists of coins, gems, and all manner of artwork

and magic items. Its not unlikely that an artifact or two

languishes here as well. You should tailor this treasure to

the campaign, but it should represent at least 1,500,000

gp in value.

H. Inmost Vault (EL 23)

Upon passing through the portal in the ceiling of area B,

a character must make a DC 25 Fortitude save to enter the

Inmost Vault. A character who fails takes 2d6 points of

Strength drain and is teleported to a prison in area D, while

all his gear is teleported into the treasury (area G).

With a successful save, the character emerges from a well

up into a strange realm. Unlike the other seven chambers, the

Inmost Vault lies in an area bordered below by the tesseract

the Reliquary is built upon. One could  y forever into the

boundless gray skies above, but after a days journey along

the steaming festering fens of the ground here (regardless

of the speed of the journey), a traveler  nds himself in the

Hungry Tarns of the Abyss.

Of more import, however, is the stone altar about 50 feet

from the well, for upon it rests the skull of Sertrousand

next to it, the  nal guardian and First Heretic Avamerin (see

encounter 83, page 126).

GRAND TEMPLE OF SERTROUS

RAND TEMPLE OF SERTROUS

Encounter Level 20

SETUP

This  encounter  begins  as  soon  as  the  PCs  enter  area  B.

Seghulerak  (S)  waits  to  confront  the  PCs  at  the  left  of

the  headless  snake  statue  of  Sertrous.  If  the  Reliquary

is  on  alert,  the  Vanguard  assassins  hide  behind  the  six

smaller snake statues; otherwise, they come from area C

at Seghuleraks command. The babaus and anacondas do

not appear until Seghulerak summons them.

When the PCs enter the room, read:

The air in this large chamber carries an

unpleasant stink, like a large reptiles den. A wide

set of steps leads up to a platform at the far end of

the room, in the middle of which looms an

immense statue of a headless snake coiled as if to

strike. Thick bubbling streams of glowing green

 uid drain from the headless stump into a pool

before it. Smaller statues of snakes with their heads

intact stand along the walls. The churning green

liquid in the pool at the base of the headless snake

runs slowly over the lip,  owing down the steps in

languid ribbons and draining into a larger pool.

The ceiling arches to a height of 80 feet overhead,

where an immense carving of a snakes leering

visage peers down on the room below.

TACTICS

If forewarned, Seghulerak casts antilife shell, extended death

ward,  and  air  walk  on  herself.  She  wastes  no  time  with

threats once she sees the  rst PC, but immediately casts

blade barrier down the center of the room between her and

them. Over the next few rounds, she summons  endish

anacondas with her summon monster spells. If the PCs still

havent reached her in melee, she continues to  ght using

her ranged spells. As soon as she takes any damage, her

contingent conjuration activates, calling a babau demon

to her side. She is fond of moving into a pool of poison

while constricting foes.

Four assassins move up to engage the PCs, using charge

attacks from hiding (trying to use sneak attacks) and then

moving to  ank foes in the following rounds. The remain-

ing two assassins hang back to observe PC spellcasters,

launching death attacks 3 rounds later. If a poison pool

or river is in reach, they take a move action to dip their

falchions into the poison.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Lighting: This area is bathed in shadowy illumination from

the glowing poison.

Poison: Any character in a square that contains the green

fluid must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid touching the

poison (contact, Fort DC 22, one negative level/1d4 negative

levels). Chaotic evil creatures are unaffected.

Pools of Poison: Both pools of poison are 5 feet deep; each

has the same effect as the poison river above. A creature im-

mersed in the poison has a 4 penalty on saves to resist the

poison.

Serpent Statue: 10 feet thick; AC 3; hardness 9; 2,000

hp; break DC 50; Climb DC 15. The statue of Sertrous is

made of stone and can provide cover, but it is not dangerous.

Statue of Sertrous: The six smaller statues of Sertrous are

all traps.

Serpent  Guardian  Trap:  CR  14;  magic  device;  proximity

trigger (detect chaos, detect good; automatic reset; Atk +24 melee

(bite, 2d6+10 plus poison); poison (Fort DC 25, 3d6 Con/3d6

Con); Search DC 40; Disable Device DC 40; AC 3; hardness

10; hp 120.

Steps: A creature standing on steps is on higher ground

(and gains a +1 bonus on attacks against creatures on the floor).

A creature on the dais at the northern end of the room is on

higher ground than a creature on the steps.

Protective Slime (Su) A slimy red jelly coats a babaus skin.

Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid

damage; this damage bypasses hardness. A magic

weapon can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid the

damage. A creature that strikes a babau with an unarmed

attack, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage

as well unless he succeeds on the Reflex save.

Sneak Attack (Ex) A babau can make a sneak attack like a

rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a

foe is denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when the

babau is flanking.

PITS OF THE FORSAKEN

ITS OF THE FORSAKEN

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Lighting: This area is dark.

Balconies/Bridges: The balconies have no railings; a fall

off one of them causes 3d6 points of damage and immediately

exposes the victim to the carpet of snakes.

Illusory Statue: The statue of Sertrous in the middle of

the room is a permanent image (CL 20th). The statue is large

enough for a Large or smaller creature to hide within.

Prison Pits: An adamantine grate seals the top of each

pit. The grate cannot be opened; prisoners are placed in the

pits using teleport spells. The shaft of each pit drops 20 feet

and is warded with a forbiddance spell (CL 15th, Will DC

28). At the base, each shaft opens into a cubical cell; most

cells are 7 feet square, but three are larger (15 feet square)

for larger prisoners. Feel free to stock these prison cells with

prominent NPCs that have been captured by the Vanguard

in the campaign.

Encounter Level 19

SETUP

This encounter occurs as soon as the PCs enter area D.

You can also use this encounter if any PCs are captured

near the end of a Sertrous-themed campaign. Engineer-

ing an escape from the prison pits should be dif cult, but

might make for an interesting late-campaign twist as the

PCs move through the Reliquary in search of their gear

(which is stored in area G).

Zuvexus begins inside the illusory statue in the center

of the room.

When the characters enter the room, read:

The ceiling of this room rises to a dome of

scintillating scales 30 feet above, as if the entire

dome had been decorated with the hide of an

impossibly huge emerald snake. The  oor drops

away to a depth of 30 feet. Nearly two dozen 5-foot-

wide pits pock the  oor, each sealed with a grate of

black metal. Thousands of snakes writhe and

slither along the  oor, and although they crawl

across the pit gratings, they never slide down

inside. Five balconies overlook the  oor, one in

each corner and a  fth against the center of one

wall. Graceful bridges extend from the balconies to

a  oating circular platform in the center of the

room, on which looms a large stone statue of a

headless snake.

TACTICS

The viper swarms should be little more than a nuisance

to high-level PCs, but the real menace is a considerable

threat.  Zuvexus  is  Seghuleraks  cohort,  and  when  her

mistress  is  in  the  Reliquary,  it  is  the  mariliths  duty  to

serve as warden.

She waits patiently, hidden inside the illusory statue of

Sertrous in the middle of the room. She can see through

the illusion with her true seeing ability. When the PCs

enter, she attempts to summon 1d4 hezrous. She then

drinks a potion of barkskin +4. In the third round, she

uses project image to place an image of herself on one of

the corner balconies, then uses her spell-like abilities to

harry the PCs, creating blade barriers and using telekinesis to

force PCs through the barrier and off the balcony. When

forced into melee, she uses her wand of haste and activates

a dervish dance. Then, with the aid of air walk, she takes

advantage of her high speed and ability to make full attacks

while moving. She  ghts to the death.

SETUP

Avamerin spends all his time here in morbid contempla-

tion while the Vanguard is unleashed on the world; he

ventures out only when he needs to select a new agent.

The corrupted planetar stands near the skull of Sertrous.

Sertrous himself does not appear until the PCs defeat

Avamerin, either by slaying him or otherwise incapaci-

tating him to the point where he can no longer guard the

Inmost Vault. At this point, Sertrous is forced to resurrect

as his aspect, rather than in his true form. In this form, the

PCs might have a chance to defeat him. Four golothoma

demons writhe up out of the bog around the island to join

the fray at this time as well.

Corrupted Aura (Su) Avamerins protective aura has

become corrupted. It now provides a 4 penalty to AC

and a 4 penalty on saving throws to anyone but the

planetar within 20 feet. This aura suppresses any

protection from evil effects within its reach. This aura

can be dispelled, but the angel can create it again as a

free action on its next turn.

Regeneration (Ex) A planetar takes normal damage from

evil-aligned weapons and from spells and effects that

have the evil descriptor.

When Avamerin is defeated, read:

The deformed angel has but a moment to register

surprise before his expression twists into a knot of

pain. His scream has barely begun before his head

further deforms into that of a snake with  ve jaws

and extends from his body on a blood-streaked

serpentine neck. Then, as the immense snake within

coils and  exes, the angels ruined body  ies apart in

a kaleidoscopic burst of  esh and bone. Where once

stood a humanoid foe now coils something far more

monstrous, a shape the mind refuses to accept.

TACTICS

When  Avamerin  becomes  aware  of  the  PCs  arrival,  he

greets them with a friendly but tired welcome, congratu-

lating them on achieving the Inmost Vault of the Serpent

Reliquary. He then apologizes to the PCs, informing them

that there is no Sertrousthere never was. The Vanguard

was a sham, and the infestation of serpents is a trial placed

upon the world by the gods as a test to mortal life. Avamerin

proudly proclaims the PCs the saviors of their world and

congratulates them on proving to the gods that mortal life

can  indeed  stand  against  such  horror  and  peril.  He  then

offers to send the PCs back to their homes; if the PCs accept,

he casts gate to open a portal for them.

Of course, these are all lies. Avamerin is merely attempting

to convince the PCs to leave the Inmost Vault so that he can

 ee to somewhere else with the skull of Sertrous and rebuild

his lair. Whether the gate actually leads back to the PCs home

or to a horri c layer of the Abyss cunningly disguised to look

like their home is up to you.

If the PCs attack (as Avamerin expects), the fallen planetar

does his best to slay them all. As he attacks, his true nature

slithers into being; he is not the handsome angel the PCs

initially  spoke  to,  but  a  hunchbacked  creature  with  scaly

skin and a partially serpentine face, complete with forked

tongue. Although he has a large number of spell-like abili-

ties, he prefers to  ght in melee, resorting to spells only to

defend himself or strike at foes beyond his immediate reach.

He makes liberal use of his quickened spells in the  rst few

rounds of combat.

When Avamerin is slain, Sertrous is forced to manifest to

defend himself. The demon lord uses the body of his  rst

and greatest minion to fuel the manifestation of his avatar,

and he calls upon four golothomas to aid him in the battle

as well. Sertrous uses Awesome Blow to hurl PCs into the

diseased trees to cause explosions of poisonous spores.

CONCLUSION

With the defeat of the aspect of Sertrous, the PCs slay the

obyrith lord for the second time. Since they have prevented

his return to the Abyss where he can rebuild his true form,

what becomes of Sertrouss spirit is up to you. When the PCs

return to their world, they  nd the infestation brought about

by Sertrouss presence already fading.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Diseased Tree: These soaking and shuddersome trees can

provide cover, but any attempt to climb them results in great

swaths of diseased wood and bark coming away by the handful.

This action or any solid blow struck against a tree unleashes a

cloud of green spores in a 10-foot-radius spread. All creatures

in this area must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or take

1d6 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated for

1d6 rounds. A successful save indicates the victim is merely

sickened for 1d6 rounds. Creatures that are immune to disease

or poison are immune to this effect.

Deep Bog: These spaces cost Medium or larger creatures 4

squares of movement to enter. Small and smaller creatures must

swim to enter these spaces.

The water provides cover for Medium or larger creatures,

while Small and smaller creatures receive improved cover (+8

bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves). Medium or larger

creatures can crouch to gain improved cover. Creatures that

have improved cover take a 10 penalty on attacks against

creatures not underwater.

Tumble checks are impossible in deep bog, and the DC of

Move Silently checks increases by 2.

Shallow Bog: These squares cost 2 squares of movement

to enter. The DC of Tumble checks in these squares increases

by 2.

he Worm that Walks is known by many names,

though  of  them  all,  Kyuss  is  the  one  true

namethe  most  common,  the  most  reviled,  and

the most feared.

Edwin Tolstoff

The Worm that Walks is a shifting mass of mag-

gots and worms filled with the psychic imprint

of a demigod named Kyuss. Slain in another age,

the Worm that Walks yearns to return and seize

the world in its wriggling grasp, ushering in the

worlds last age.

BACKGROUND

There are a great many uncertainties and contradic-

tions when it comes to the elder evil known as the

Worm that Walks. One thing all agree upon is its

identity: It can be none other than Kyuss, the sire

of many despicable creatures plaguing the world.

This name holds dreadful import not because of

any remembered atrocity attributed to his name, but

because of the things serving him still. His minions

are numerous, ranging from grotesque undead to

hideous  aberrations.  It  is  these  servants  mortals

have come to revile, and they extend their loathing

to the Worm that Walks for his part in bringing

them into being.

Scholars of forbidden lore claim that Kyuss walked the

earth in an ancient era, long before the oldest kingdoms

of the modern day. This time was one of great evil, when

humanity dabbled with the blasphemous arts and served

the dark gods. Kyuss was either a mortal necromancer of

considerable talent or an evil gods ranking priest. (Knowl-

edge [religion] DC 25)

The most common theory claims that Kyuss was so wicked

even his decadent society exiled him, casting him out because

he dabbled in forbidden arts and spoke ominous prophecies

of an impending  nal age. Rather than languishing as an

outcast, he became a prophet and drew to him followers who

clamored to hear his grim words. They saw him as the gods

servant, if not a god in his own right, and believed it they

curried his favor, he would shelter them from the horri c

age he promised would come. (DC 30)

Kyuss  discovered  the  ruins  of  a  dead  civilization.  The

structures that remained bore many strange writings, depic-

tions of human sacri ce, and six-armed tyrants ruling over

all. Kyuss claimed this site for his own and commanded his

people to rebuild the city from the wreckage. (DC 35)

Although he ruled as god and king, the disturbing visions

and his own discontentment urged him to seek greater

power, to  nd some way to transcend the mortal  esh and

become more than a man, to become a true god. His path

was clear when his followers discovered ancient metal

plates, which held terrible secrets but also con rmed every

prophetic word he had spoken. (DC 40)

620_21556_Ch9.indd   128

620_21556_Ch9.indd   128

9/27/07   3:33:09 PM

9/27/07   3:33:09 PM

Through these inscriptions, he discovered the incanta-

tion to let him transcend mortality at a terrible pricethe

lives of his congregation. For this prophet, no price was too

high, and on one bloody night he instructed his priests to

round up the followers and slaughter them all. When they

 nished, Kyuss murdered the murderers. With the blood of

thousands staining his hands, he turned to the great obelisk

his  servants  had  pulled  from  the  earth  and  intoned  the

words to begin his transformation. When he was  nished,

he stepped into the stone, fusing his essence with the foul

rock, gaining and losing his divinity in one moment. He

was neither mortal nor godhe was something far worse.

(DC 45)

GOALS

Kyuss hungers for conquest. Trapped within his prison, his

fractured mind conceives and discards innumerable plots

to escape. No idea is suf cient to break his bonds, no trick

shrewd enough to let him slip free. Instead, he beats against

the walls and howls with a thousand voices. (Knowledge

[religion] DC 25)

Aside from the con nement he endures, his frustration

stems from the knowledge that, if he could break free, he

would set in motion the events to lead up to the last age of

mankindthe mysterious Age of Worms. Throughout his

long life, he has caught glimpses of this time when he is the

master, the lord and ruler of all things. He covets this end,

for he knows by achieving it he will rise in power and attain

the godhood he seeks. (DC 30)

THE WORM THAT WALKS

IN THE CAMPAIGN

The Worm that Walks is easy to incorporate into a campaign

because of its association with several lesser creatures such as

the spawn of Kyuss, the avolakia, and the ulgurstasta. Using

these adversaries helps plant the seed of Kyuss in your players

minds so when you reveal the elder evils true nature, its a

logical resolution for the campaign.

TIMELINE

Use the following timeline as a guide for constructing a cam-

paign where the Worm that Walks  gures in as a principal

villain. This campaign incorporates information found in

Exemplars of Evil. If you do not have this supplement, you can

substitute other characters and adventure hooks.

EL 3 (Faint Sign): Sealed away in his prison beneath his

family estate, Edwin Tolstoff urges his grandchildren to kill

their mother and become his servants. He uses his heirs to

release him from his vault (see Exemplars of Evil).

As  this  terrible  act  occurs,  spawn  of  Kyuss  (MM2  186)

appear. From old dungeons, ruins, and forgotten castles, these

undead spread through the land, and numerous rewards can

be claimed for defeating this new infestation.

EL  6:  The  characters  find  themselves  drawn  into  a

murder  mystery  while  spending  some  time  in  a  large

city. They identify the killer as a wicked wererat whisper

gnome named Draen. This knowledge leads the characters

to the lycanthropes mistress, Katarin Tolstoff, who flees

to  escape  the  adventurers.  If  the  PCs  follow  her,  they

come upon her familys castle, where they face terrifying

obstacles and see a glimpse of what horror shall awaken

later in the campaign.

EL 9 (Moderate Sign): Weeks later, the characters are back

in the large city when they hear reports of citizens vanish-

ing from the streets, their homes, and even their beds. The

mood is sullen, and the locals are demanding that the mayor

do something about the kidnappings. Since the characters

were so helpful the last time they were there, the mayor

approaches them about his predicament. If the PCs become

involved, they track the missing citizens to a temple buried

below the city. There, a mad avolakia (MM2 28) infects the

captives with bright green worms to transform them into

spawn of Kyuss. Even if the PCs defeat this villain and thwart

its plans, rumors tell of similar disappearances occurring all

over the nation.

EL 12: Months later, the player characters come to another

city for training, rest, and to resupply. When one of the spell-

casters goes to the wizards guild to purchase magic items or

stock his spellbook, he  nds the place is empty. Investigation

reveals that the place has been ransacked and the wizards

and staff have been transformed into undead horrors. While

 ghting  the  undead,  the  PCs  rescue  a  few  survivors,  who

provide a description of the thief: Edwin. They reveal that

although an assortment of smaller items were taken, the most

devastating loss was a well of many worlds.

EL 15 (Strong Sign): By now, the spawn of Kyuss have

infested  the  countryside,  wreaking  havoc  with  smaller

communities  and  besieging  cities.  Panic  rules  the  land

and people take desperate measures to protect themselves

and their families. The Herald of Kyuss, at Edwins behest,

seeks out the PCs, posing as an NPC ally the characters met

earlier. He claims that the true culprit behind the unusual

phenomena  is  a  powerful  wild  mage  named  Emirikol

the Chaotic. The Herald believes the wizard intends to

the characters to accompany him to Emirikols tower and

confront the wizard. In truth, this is all a ruse, for while the

PCs  ght Emirikol, Edwin slips in and steals the talisman

of the sphere.

EL 18 (Overwhelming Sign): Edwin requires one more

item to free his master: the sphere of annihilation. After

torturing a few sages, he learns the artifact lies within the

fabled crypt of Acererak: the Tomb of Horrors. Knowing

this dungeons reputation, he anonymously hires the PCs to

clear the way. As the adventurers contend with the various

tricks and traps, Edwin follows behind. Just as they come to

the sphere of annihilation, Edwin seizes control of the artifact,

revealing that he has the talisman of the sphere. Once he gains

control, he escapes and  ees to Wormcrawl Island, where he

intends to free his master. The PCs have only one chance to

stop Edwin before he reaches the island.

WORM THAT WALKS IN EBERRON

For centuries, the Lords of Dust conspired to release the

Worm that Walks from its prison. According to their his-

tories, an overlord named Katashka fused its essence with a

human wizard named Kyuss, and the result of their joining

was apotheosis. Before Kyuss-Katashka could spread woe and

death, it was imprisoned, sealed away in the depths of Khyber.

This sinister group has worked ever since to unleash the being

from its prison and beget the worlds  nal age.

Wormcrawl Island is one of the many islands making up

Shargons Teeth off the northern coast of Xendrik. Local

sailors refuse to sail near it, believing it cursed. In fact, many

fringe groups among the drow claim that the avatar of the

scorpion god dwells here, and to set foot there invites the

wrath of his terrifying servants.

WORM THAT WALKS IN FAERN

An obscure cadre of ex-clerics banded together to  nd some

way to restore their fallen gods to power. Consisting of Bane,

Bhaal, and Myrkuls priests, they have an uneasy alliance,

setting aside their differences to work toward their common

goal, though treachery is never far from their minds. Having

acquired a few rare manuscripts, they have come to believe the

Worm that Walks contains a divine spark that, if harnessed,

could restore life to their fallen gods.

Among the bold sailors who brave the great crossing to

and from Maztica, there are legends of Wormcrawl Island, a

terrifying place far from any charted waters. Those searching

for its location  nd little to aid them, for even the elves of

Evermeet do not speak of it except to warn that it harbors a

great and terrible evil.

THE AGE OF WORMS CAMPAIGN

DUNGEON Magazines Age of Worms adventure path describes

Kyusss  emergence  as  heralding  the  start  of  a  new  age  of

despair. The material in this chapter was not written to contra-

dict whats presented in this campaign, but certain elements

are different. If youre running Age of Worms, you can make

use of many of the plot elements provided in this chapter

as well as the characters and locations to create even more

adventure possibilities.

WORM THAT WALKS

The Worm that Walks is hideous. Standing over 30 feet tall

and composed of writhing maggots and worms held together

by pure hatred, it has the shape of a tall giant. Each worm

making up its form contains a fragment of Kyusss personality,

so when combined it functions as Kyuss did in life.

Although the Worm that Walks has little need for modesty,

it hides its gruesomeness beneath a blackened cloak made

from the  ayed hides of those Kyuss sacri ced before his

transformation. The light from two blazing red eyes pierces

forth from under the hood.

True Seeing (Su) As the true seeing spell; con-

tinuous; caster level 20th.

Frightful Presence (Su) The Worm that Walks

inspires terror whenever it uses its worm-

smite. Affected creatures must succeed

on a DC 30 Will save or become shaken,

remaining so as long as they stay within 60

feet of the Worm that Walks. A creature that

saves cannot be affected by the Worms

frightful presence for 24 hours.

Tongues (Su) As the tongues spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

Worm-Smite (Ex) Once every 5 rounds, the

Worm that Walks can make a standard

melee attack to deliver a worm-smite. A

creature struck by this attack must succeed

on a DC 33 Re ex save or become covered

in ravenous worms. On the Worms next

turn and every turn thereafter, the target

takes 10d8 points of slashing damage as

the worms consume the victims  esh and

burrow into its organs. The worms remain

until destroyed or removedor until the

target is slain, indicating the worms have

devoured their victim.

A target can use a full-round action to

attempt to remove the worms. Escaping

requires a DC 33 Re ex save. Rolling on the groundand

thus crushing the wormsprovides a +2 circumstance bo-

nus on the save. Dealing at least 20 points of  re damage

destroys the worms, but deals the same amount of dam-

age to the victim as well. Conjuration (teleportation) spells

or spell-like effects can also extricate the target from the

worm-smite. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Constructs, elementals, oozes, and creatures of the

incorporeal subtype are immune to this ability.

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid or monstrous humanoid of

Medium or smaller size killed by the Worm that Walks

rises after 1d4 rounds as a spawn of Kyuss (MM2 186)

under the Worms control. It does not possess any of the

abilities it had in life.

Discorporate (Ex) As an immediate action, the Worm that

Walks can discorporate, collapsing into a pile of slither-

ing vermin. Theres one Fine worm (AC 20, 1 hp each) for

each hit point the Worm that Walks possessed prior to dis-

corporating. In the round it uses this ability, the worms fall

to the ground,  lling the Worms space. Unless each worm

is destroyed within 1 round, the writhing worms burrow

into the earth or slither away using the Worms various

forms of movement. As long as any component vermin

survives, the Worm that Walks can, within 24 hours, breed

and create a new body to house its malicious essence.

Summon Scion (Sp) The Worm that Walks can summon a

scion of Kyuss (see page 140) up to three times per day.

pqs

SPAWN OF KYUSS

Spawn of Kyuss are described in Monster Manual II. If you do

EDWIN TOLSTOFF

Think I like this accursed form? No. I detest it. Through my service,

I hope for only one outcome: freedom.

Edwin Tolstoff

When Edwin Tolstoff earned Kyusss favor, he also gained his

new masters form. Edwin is a mirror of Kyuss. He harbors

great magical power within his body of wriggling vermin.

GOALS

Edwin Tolstoff was never satis ed with standard magical stud-

ies and turned toward darker pursuits, joining a secret cult of

Nerull, god of death, and murdering colleagues to snatch their

stores of mystical knowledge. His treachery and lust for learning

earned the Worms attention and his new accursed form.

Like many who bear the burden of service to an elder evil,

Edwin  wants  escape,  but  his  destiny  was  ever  bound  the

moment he learned of Kyusss true nature. He believes the

means to restore his form lies in the release of the Worm that

Walks, though deep down he suspects even then he will  nd

no release and will be absorbed into the greater being. Truly,

he has nothing to lose, for either path leads to death.

Edwin Tolstoff

USING EDWIN

Edwin begins the campaign tucked away in a vault of his own,

buried alive by his terri ed daughter. Until Edwin is released,

he is no threat, though he can be a source of information

about Kyuss and the threat to the world.

As the campaign progresses, Edwin should escapeby

his grandchildrens assistance or the Heralds. He sets out to

 nd what he needs to free Kyuss, scouring the repositories

for clues. His unsettling nature and ability to discorporate

make Edwin a great recurring villain.

DESCRIPTION

Nothing remains of the body to which Edwin was born;

meat and bone were stripped away long ago by a ravenous

swarm of worms sent by his master. In no way did Edwin

expect this unfortunate turn, and he strove to conceal him-

self for as long as he could. But the trail of cast-off worms

made his af iction too obvious to ignore. This affectation to

hide his body continues still, and he goes to great lengths to

resume the life he once led, donning heavy hooded robes,

a mask, and an arsenal of magic items to protect himself

from discovery.

HERALD OF KYUSS

Behold, the great Worm stirs! Go out and spread the word, for he

shall come and make worthy the unworthy, redeem the wicked,

and purge the unclean.

The Herald of Kyuss

The Herald of Kyuss is the Worms high priest, prophet, and

disciple. The Herald conceals his awful form behind many

different masks. The Herald can be anyone and anywhere,

watching and waiting for the moment to strike.

GOALS

As  a  devoted  servant,  the  Herald  seeks  little  else  than  to

serve the pleasure of his master. It is enough for him to mur-

der and devourto spread unrest and violence in the

Worms name. The Herald must often guess at

USING THE HERALD

The Herald is a faceless enemy, a hid-

den threat to cause trouble for the player

characters. Using his change shape abil-

ity, the Herald can masquerade as anyone,

and can play the part of a trusted ally

or a longtime companion. When

the  PCs  seek  out  Wormcrawl

Island, the Herald should accom-

pany them, then betray them at

their most desperate moment.

DESCRIPTION

Kyusss  Herald  prefers  the

form of a young, lithe wom-

an, getting what he wants

through seduction and de-

ceit.  His  normal  form  is  a

disgusting blending of worm,

octopus, and insect. The Herald

is monstrous, but also quite clev-

er. He speaks eloquently and

has impeccable manners.

WORMCRAWL ISLAND

The Worm that Walks is imprisoned within an obelisk at

the heart of Wormcrawl Island, a remote place not found

on any nautical chart, forgotten by all but the wisest sages

and most despicable cultists. This island is wild and deadly,

filled  with  monsters  of  incalculable  horror  and  might,

infested with the worst sorts of creatures imaginable. The

people who entombed Kyuss here chose wisely, for none

but the most courageous (or foolish) would dare explore

the haunted jungles, brave the swarms of biting vermin,

or  contend  with  the  monstrous  threats  contaminating

the place.

Through the ages, many have settled here, including

savage humans, forest giants, and others. No settlement

has survived the perils of the island, instead succumbing

to beasts of the jungle, madness inspired by the obelisk,

or violence committed against one another. Ruins filled

with bones and rot testify to the carnage of the inhabit-

ants deaths.

KEY FEATURES

To an outsider, the island is like any other tropical para-

dise,  with  high,  mist-shrouded  peaks  and  lush  jungles

buzzing with life. The forest canopy is home to several

varieties  of  monkeys,  birds  whose  plumage  runs  the

spectrum,  all  sorts  of  crawling  insects,  and,  of  course,

worms. Beneath its breathtaking exterior lies rot, decay,

and pulsing evil.

Wormcrawl Island is about four miles in diameter. Two

mountains dominate the terrain. The eastern mountain is

older and covered by dense jungle, and the western peak is

jagged, bare, and topped with a smoking crater.

Runoff from the mountains drains down to the interior and

gathers in a large freshwater lake (see area C). The lake feeds

a river that cuts a path to the ocean. Gathering on the shores

of the river is dense foliage consisting of thorny bushes, tall

grasses, and odd  owers.

The most notable feature of the island is at its center,

where  the  Worm  that  Walks  languishes  in  the  prison

of its obelisk. All around the 100-foot-tall spire is blood

rock, stone infused with the blood of countless sacri ces.

Spewing up from this stone are pools of slime infused with

Kyusss pestilence.

The islet rises in the center of a sea of hot tar. Great bubbles

rise from its depths to burst and release poisonous fumes that

waft across the shores and  ll the air with toxins.

DEFENSES

The island is home to numerous creaturesundead and

aberrations  mostlybut  there  are  all  sorts  of  vermin,

magical beasts, and other predators as well. Although these

threats are many and varied, characters of a level likely to

be exploring this place should be more than a match for

such creatures.

The PCs arrival does not, however, go unnoticed, and

a  powerful  guardian  responds  to  their  presence.  Every  10

minutes the PCs explore the island, theres a 10% chance the

characters attract a century worm set here to ensure that no

interlopers awaken the Worm that Walks.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a century worm must

hit an opponent of smaller size with a bite attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it automatically deals bite damage, establishes a

hold, and can try to swallow the opponent in the follow-

ing round.

Swallow Whole (Ex) A century worm can try to swallow a

grabbed opponent of smaller size by making a successful

grapple check.

The swallowed creature takes 2d6+9 points of blud-

geoning damage and 2d6 points of acid damage per

round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using

a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 40 points of

damage to the gizzard (AC 22). Once the creature exits,

muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed op-

ponent must cut its own way out.

A century worms gizzard can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large,

32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Keening (Ex) Once per round, as a free action, a century

worm can force all living creatures within 50 feet to

succeed on DC 36 Fortitude saves or be deafened for

1 round.

Wriggling Progeny (Ex) Characters trapped within a century

worms gizzard must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save

every round or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage.

A creature reduced to Constitution 0 dies and a larva at-

taches itself to the victims spine. A remove disease spell

destroys the larva. After 100 years, the larva grows into a

new century worm.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

The encounter map depicts one possible approach, placing

the obelisk in the center of the island. If the PCs travel from

a  different  direction,  change  the  compass  to  a  direction

serving your needs or sketch out the rest of the island. The

following encounter areas are but a sample of those that

could take place here.

A. Gruesome Greeting

Skulls mounted on stained poles along the islands shores

serve as warnings to drive off unwanted visitors. The skulls

are all humanoid, and a DC 10 Heal check reveals small holes

riddling each.

B. The River

The river is not deep enough for a seafaring vessel to navigate;

characters  equipped  with  rowboats  can  move  upstream

without a problem. The river is 100 feet wide on average. It

is home to giant crocodiles, schools of  esh-eating  sh, and

a variety of water snakes. Swarms of biting insects carry  lth

fever, and each hour of travel PCs must succeed on DC 15

Fortitude saves or contract the disease.

C. The Lake (EL 20)

Waterfalls spilling down from the mountain create a beauti-

ful spectacle for those coming upon this place, masking the

danger lurking beneath its waters. Five hideous leechwalkers

rise up and attack any who come too close.

Wounding (Ex) When a hideous leechwalker strikes a living

creature with its tentacle rake attack, that creature takes

1 point of Constitution damage in addition to any normal

damage. If a hideous leechwalker strikes an opponent

but does not deal damage, the opponent does not take

this Constitution damage. Creatures immune to critical

hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by

this ability.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a hideous leechwalker

must hit a Large or smaller opponent with a tentacle rake

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free ac-

tion without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins

the grapple check, it establishes a hold, and it can use its

blood drain ability in the same round.

Blood Drain (Ex) A hideous leechwalker deals 2d6 points of

Constitution damage each round it maintains a hold. This

ability does not affect elementals, plants, or creatures

that lack a Constitution score.

D. Caves

A few caves and fissures pierce the slope of the volcano.

Venting out from these gaps are plumes of poisonous gas.

Characters  ying over the island or climbing the volcano

must make a DC 20 Fortitude save against the poisonous air

(initial damage 1d6 Wis, secondary damage 2d6 Con) each

minute they remain in the area.

Each cave descends 1d4100 feet into the volcano. In their

depths, at least a dozen blessed spawn of Kyuss work to breach

the walls and  ood the tunnels and the island with lava to

destroy the obelisk and free their master.

Blessed Spawn of Kyuss (varies): hp 93 each; see page

138 for statistics.

E. Volcano

A volcano towers over the island, rising above the lower slopes

at a sharp climb up to 2,000 feet above sea level at the lip of the

caldera. At the top, the ground gives way to a 500-foot-deep

pit a thousand feet across. At the bottom is a churning soup

of lava, spewing clouds of poisonous gas and the occasional

spray of  aming rock into the air. Characters lingering here

are subject to the same Fortitude saves as described under area

D, but the save DC increases to 25. In addition, theres a 20%

chance each minute that something belches forth from the

 aming pit, striking a random character. The creature struck

must succeed on a DC 20 Re ex save or take 5d6 points of

bludgeoning damage and 5d6 points of  re damage.

F. The Unquiet Jungle

The jungle that covers much of the land west of the volcano

is crawling with  erce insects and contaminated by parasites

and diseases delivered by clouds of thirsty mosquitoes. Each

hour the characters travel through the jungles exposes them

to slimy doom (DMG 292).

G. Shattered Idol

Rising up like a crones  nger from the western mountain

are the remains of a shattered idol. Little is left to testify to its

original form, though its clear the  gure wore robes. Rubble

litters the ground around the idol, and 50 feet down the slope

lies the head, which is carved to look like a mass of worms.

H. Sacred Pool

This pool served as a sacred meeting place. It is now black and

corrupt, with a skin of green slime coating its surface. The

water feeding the pool spills into the murk without disturb-

ing the surface. The grass and underbrush all around is brown

and slippery with rot. A successful DC 15 Search check of

the area turns up a few scraps of cloth, a shattered symbol of

Obad-Hai, and a scattering of maggot-infested  esh.

I. Polluted Lake

The marsh is a mess of mud, pools of brown water, and dead

reeds. In its center is a still, black pool of stinking water. Just

beneath the surface are the rotting remains of the villagers

who lived here. The salts of the water preserve their bodies,

keeping them ready for animation. As long as no one drinks

the water, the pool and its contents are harmless. Consuming

or touching the water exposes the characters to the tiny green

worms crawling through the muck. The worms function as

those bestowed by the blessed spawn of Kyusss bestow worm

ability (see page 138).

J. Tar Pit

The islet that surrounds the obelisk is encircled by a sea of

tar. The effects of the tar are described in encounter 92.

RUINSUINS

Encounter Level 18

SETUP

You  can  run  this  tactical  encounter  in  any  area  that

indicates ruins. The gravecrawler (G) hides beneath the

calci ed bones inside the ruined structure. The blessed

spawn (B) are all hiding where indicated on the tactical

map. (Those in heavy undergrowth gain a +5 bonus on

the Hide check.)

The players place their miniatures along an edge of the

map matching their general direction of travel.

Once the players have placed their miniatures, read:

You see two crumbling walls of a ruined stone

building. Chalky white bones and statues

depicting dying humans are scattered about.

Theres a rancid smell in the air, a stink of rotting

 esh beneath the decay of the swamp.

Whenever a character notices a hidden spawn or is

attacked by one, read:

A massive undead horror rises from the muck. Its

ochre  esh clings to its bones, giving it a skeletal

appearance. Its mouth yawns open to reveal a mass

of bright green worms.

Later in the combat, when a PC encounters the grave-

crawler, read:

A bloated maggot with an eyeless, humanlike head

slithers toward you, spewing mad threats and

curses as it travels.

TACTICS

The blessed spawn cast haste on themselves, increasing

their speed to 70 feet and giving them a +1 bonus on attack

rolls, on Re ex saves, and to AC. They close to engage the

closest PC, making touch attacks to bestow worms.

While the combat rages, the gravecrawler moves to place

the PCs within range of its calcifying aura. It uses Spring

Attack to strike at any characters within 2 squares of its

location. It engages the PCs if they destroy or turn four or

more blessed spawn.

CONCLUSION

Searching through the rubble turns up an assortment of

baubles. There is a total of 1,034 pp. Characters succeeding

on DC 20 Search checks also  nd 1d2 black pearls (500

gp) until a total of  ve have been found. A DC 20 Search

check in the western corner uncovers a +2 heavy wooden

shield of spell resistance (13).

Use statistics for a minotaur zombie (MM 267).

Bestow Worm (Su) Once per round as a free action, a

blessed spawn of Kyuss can bestow a worm onto its

opponent. It can do this when it hits with a slam attack

or by making a touch or ranged touch attack up to 10

feet away (+16 and +4 attack modifiers, respectively).

A worm is a Fine vermin with AC 10 and 1 hit point.

It can be killed with normal damage or by the touch of

silver. At the start of the spawns next turn, the worm

burrows into its hosts flesh (a creature with a +5 or

greater natural armor bonus is immune to this effect).

The worm makes its way to its victims brain, dealing 1

point of damage each round for 1d4+1 rounds. At the

end of that period, it reaches the brain, where it deals

1d2 points of Intelligence damage each round until its

killed or it slays its host, which occurs when the victims

Intelligence is reduced to 0.

A remove curse or remove disease spell destroys the

worm while its within the host. Dispel evil or neutralize

poison delays the worms progress for 10d6 minutes. A

successful DC 20 Heal check extracts the worm and

kills it in the process.

A Small, Medium, or Large creature slain by the

worm rises as a new spawn of Kyuss (MM2 186) 1d6+4

rounds later. Smaller creatures rot away, and larger

creatures gain the zombie template.

Kyusss Gift (Su) Any creature hit by a blessed spawn of

Kyusss slam attack must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude

save or contract this supernatural disease. The

incubation period is 1 day, and the disease deals 1d6

points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of

Wisdom damage.

Stone Statues: 5 feet thick; AC 4; hardness 8; 900 hp;

break DC 45; Climb DC 15. It costs 2 squares of movement

to enter a square containing a statue, and a creature cant end

its movement in a statues square without climbing onto the

statue. A Medium statue provides cover. If broken, a statue fills

its square with dense rubble.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Calcified Bones: These squares count as difficult terrain.

Each space costs 1 additional square of movement to enter.

Creatures cannot run or charge through these areas.

Crumbling Walls: The walls, where present, are masonry,

but are in bad shape (1 foot thick; hardness 4; 45 hp; break DC

25; Climb DC 15).

Deep Bog: These spaces cost Medium or larger creatures 4

squares of movement to enter. Small and smaller creatures must

swim to enter these spaces.

The water provides cover for Medium or larger creatures,

while Small and smaller creatures receive improved cover (+8

bonus  to  AC,  +4  bonus  on  Reflex  saves).  Medium  or  larger

creatures can crouch to gain improved cover. Creatures that

have  improved  cover  take  a  10  penalty  on  attacks  against

creatures not underwater.

Tumble checks are impossible in deep bog, and the DC of

Move Silently checks increases by 2.

Heavy Undergrowth: Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares

of movement to move into, and it provides concealment (30%

miss chance). The DCs of Move Silently and Tumble checks

increase by 5. These spaces also provide a +5 bonus on Hide

checks.  Running  or  charging  though  these  squares  is

impossible.

Light Undergrowth: These spaces count as difficult terrain

(as calcified bones, above). They provide concealment. The DC

of Move Silently and Tumble checks increase by 2.

TAR PIT

AR PIT

Encounter Level 20

SETUP

This  tactical  encounter  can  occur  anywhere  along  the

shores of the tar pit. Change the compass on the map to

match  the  direction  your  PCs  travel.  Have  the  players

place their miniatures anywhere near the bottom edge of

the map. The scion of Kyuss lies hidden beneath the tar

as indicated on the tactical map.

When  one  or  more  of  the  PCs  approach  the  shore,

read:

A great green-brown bubble rises from the tar,

bursting and releasing a repellent gas. A moment

later, the entire surface breaks as a tremendous

wormlike creature tears free, ropes of the sticky tar

hanging from its undulating body.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, the scion of Kyuss

TACTICS

The scion of Kyuss lurches forward, swimming through

the  tar,  and  must  succeed  on  a  DC  25  Swim  check  to

move 5 feet. It slides forward each round, closing on the

PCs until it escapes the tar. Once it takes damage from a

ranged attack, it activates its tendrils, damaging any char-

acter within 40 feet.

When it gets within reach of a PC, it bites the character

using a 5-point Power Attack (for 5 on attack rolls and

+10 on damage rolls). If it hits, it makes a grapple check as

a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If

it wins, it makes a grapple check on its next turn and, if it

succeeds, it swallows the character.

If the PCs manage to reduce the scions hit points to 100

or fewer, it uses its breath weapon on its next turn and then

uses the skeletons it vomited up to cover its retreat.

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the

opponent in the following round.

Swallow Whole (Ex) The scion of Kyuss can try to swallow

a grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple

check.

A scions gizzard can hold 2 Gargantuan, 8 Huge,

32 Large, 128 Medium, or 512 Small or smaller

opponents.

Necromantic Acid (Su) A creature swallowed by the scion of

Kyuss takes 1d8 points of Constitution drain each

round. Upon death, the victim gains the skeleton

template and remains dormant until the scion vomits it

up. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a

light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 50 points of

damage to the gizzard (AC 17). Once the creature exits,

muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed

opponent must cut its own way out.

Breath Weapon (Su) 60-ft. cone, 1/day, damage 3d6 Con

drain, Reflex DC 35 for 1d6 Con drain. Creatures killed

by the scions breath weapon gain the skeleton template

and rise to fight on the following round. In addition, any

dormant skeletons are vomited up as well. Place them

anywhere within the breath weapons cone. After the

scion uses this ability, swallowed creatures do not take

Constitution drain from necromantic acid.

Spawn Skeletons (Su) As a full-round action, a scion can

regurgitate dormant skeletons. It holds in its gizzard 6

forest giant skeletons, former island natives. The

skeletons are under the scions command. For 1d6

rounds after being vomited up, the skeletons are

covered in necromantic acid, and their attacks deal 1

point of Constitution drain.

Tendrils (Ex) As a free action, the scion can extend its

tendrils, rendering it immune to projectile weapons and

dealing 1d12 points of damage each round to all

creatures within 40 feet of it. Anyone in the area also

takes a 2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls.

When a character fails the check, he begins to drown. He

falls unconscious in the first round (0 hp), drops to 1 hit

points and is dying in the following round, and dies in the

third round.

If a rescuer reaches the sinking character, the rescuer must

succeed on a DC 25 Strength check to pull the trapped character

free, and the victim must succeed on a DC 20 Strength check

to hold on. If the victim fails the check, he must succeed on a

DC 25 Swim check or sink below the surface. If both checks

succeed, the victim moves 5 feet closer to shore.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Deep Bog: These spaces cost Medium or larger creatures 4

squares of movement to enter. Small and smaller creatures must

swim to enter these spaces.

The water provides cover for Medium or larger creatures,

while Small and smaller creatures receive improved cover (+8

bonus  to  AC,  +4  bonus  on  Reflex  saves).  Medium  or  larger

creatures can crouch to gain improved cover. Creatures that

have  improved  cover  take  a  10  penalty  on  attacks  against

creatures not underwater.

Tumble checks are impossible in deep bog, and the DC of

Move Silently checks increases by 2.

Heavy Undergrowth: Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares

of  movement  to  move  into,  and  it  provides  concealment

(30% miss chance). The DCs of Move Silently and Tumble

checks increase by 5. These spaces also provide a +5 bonus

on Hide checks. Running or charging though these squares

is impossible.

Light Undergrowth: These squares cost 2 squares of move-

ment to enter. They provide concealment. The DCs of Move

Silently and Tumble checks increase by 2.

Shallow Bog: These squares cost 2 squares of movement

to enter. The DC of Tumble checks in these squares increases

by 2.

Tar: The stench here negates scent and other olfactory abili-

ties within 100 feet. Characters lingering here for more than

10 rounds must succeed on DC 15 Fortitude saves or become

sickened for 10 minutes.

The tar functions as quicksand. Entering a tar space requires

a DC 20 Swim check to tread tar or a DC 25 check to move

5 feet in any direction. A trapped character failing by 5 or more

slips below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no

longer hold his breath. Characters below the surface can swim

back to the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 25, +1

per consecutive round of being under the surface).

A character can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal

to twice his Constitution score. After this time, the character

must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue

holding his breath. The save DC increases by 1 each round.

THE OBELISK

HE OBELISK

Encounter Level 20 or 21

After 5 rounds, read:

SETUP

The Worm that Walks is sealed within a great black obe-

lisk. It looms above the shattered and polluted ground,

pulsing  with  fell  energy.  Have  the  players  place  their

miniatures along a map edge appropriate for the direction

they are traveling.

If the PCs arrive at the obelisk at any time before the

Worms sign is overwhelming, Edwin is here preparing to

direct the sphere of annihilation into the well of many worlds.

Once Edwin completes this task, it takes 5 rounds for the

Worm that Walks to emerge.

When the PCs have placed their miniatures, read:

At the center of the island rises a great black

obelisk standing over 100 feet tall. Carved onto its

surface are bright green whorls and wriggling

lines shining with sick light. The ground all

around it is broken and wisps of ochre mist spew

forth from the depths.

If Edwin is here and has not yet placed the sphere of

annihilation inside the well of many worlds, read:

A robed  gure stands before the obelisk, though

from its movements its clear something is not quite

right. The being turns, revealing a porcelain mask

in the shape of an elderly mans face. You spot a

mass of writhing worms as they squirm through

the eyeholes. Behind the creature, hovering in the

air, is a ball of utter blackness.

If Edwin has already completed the ritual to release

Kyuss, read:

A robed  gure stands laughing before the black

pillar. The markings  are with life and then fade.

The ground trembles, and spiderweb fractures

spread across the obelisks surface.

A great sucking noise rattles the earth as the air

around you rushes toward a gaping black hole at

the obelisks base.

With a great shudder, chunks of stone fall away

from the obelisk and into the sucking hole. Buried

inside the rock is a squirming mass of maggots and

worms, all crawling with  lthy roaches and bits of

old meat and bone. The thing pours out of the rock

into a growing pile and takes the vague shape of a

giant. Red eyes  are with malice as the maggots

diverge to form a mouth. From the depths you hear

rustling laughter.

TACTICS

Edwin must direct the sphere of annihilation into the well of

many worlds. He must succeed on a DC 30 control check.

His check modi er, with the talisman of the sphere, is +36.

Edwin  then   ghts  the  PCs  until  his  master  emerges.

He uses spells to cause trouble and prevent the PCs from

drawing too close to the shuddering well, using waves of

fatigue followed by insect plague.

He then casts a mix of offensive spells such as disinte-

grate, enervation, wrack, and clutch of Orcus, targeting PCs

who seem to take an interest in the well of many worlds.

After 5 rounds, Kyuss bursts free, erupting from the obe-

lisk as a  ood of worms and maggots that quickly assumes

the form of a giant humanoid. Edwin casts word of recall to

a place of your choosing and Kyuss attacks the PCs. The

Worm that Walks hammers at the characters with its slam

attack, using its worm-smite ability on the first round.

Kyuss then casts dominate monster on a melee combatant,

instructing the PC to turn against his comrades. Kyuss

 lls out the next few rounds with maximized lightning

bolts, waves of exhaustion, widened chain lightning, and a

mixture of other offensive spells until he can use worm-

smite again.

If at any time Kyuss is reduced to 100 hit points or

fewer,  he  discorporates  and  slithers  off  to  re-form  1d6

hours later.

Although  the  procedure  Edwin  uses  to  release  the

Worm that Walks should succeed, it has other unfore-

seen consequences. The sphere becomes a black hole,

annihilating  everything  in  existence.  If  abandoned,

it  picks  up  speed  and  power,  drawing  the  island,  the

waters, the air and everything else on the Material Plane

into  its  dimensional  fissure,  erasing  all  existence  in

1d12+6 minutes.

Obelisks Shadow: A character in the shadow of the obelisk

takes a 2 circumstance penalty on Will saves.

Sphere of Annihilation: Until Edwin places the sphere into

contact with the well of many worlds, it functions normally (DMG

279). Once the procedure is complete, the resulting tear pulls

air, fine creatures, and debris toward it. After the first minute,

the effect intensifies, and all characters must succeed on DC

15 Balance checks. A failed check means the character falls

prone. A check failed by 5 or more indicates the character falls

prone and slides 1d25 feet toward the sphere. Each minute

thereafter, the Balance DC increases by 5. After 3 minutes,

flying anywhere within 100 feet is impossible, and such char-

acters  are  automatically  sucked  into  the  sphere  unless  they

succeed on a Reflex save against the Balance check DC.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Blood Rock: Any roll of a natural 19 or 20 hits and threatens

a critical hit while the attacker stands in a blood rock square.

Feats or spells that enhance a weapons threat range dont

modify blood rocks effect. Only melee attacks are affected by

this terrain.

Worms: These spaces contain the worms of Kyuss. A char-

acter moving through one of these spaces becomes infested with

a worm. The worm is a Fine vermin with AC 10 and 1 hit point.

It can be killed with normal damage or by the touch of silver.

At the end of the characters next turn, the worm burrows into

its hosts flesh (a creature with a +5 or greater natural armor

bonus is immune to this effect). The worm makes its way to its

victims brain, dealing 1 point of damage each round for 1d4+1

rounds. At the end of that period, it reaches the brain, where it

deals 1d2 points of Intelligence damage each round until its

killed or it slays its host, which occurs when the victims Intel-

ligence is reduced to 0.

A  remove  curse  or remove  disease  effect  destroys  the  worm

while its within the host. Dispel evil or neutralize poison delays

the worms progress for 10d6 minutes. A successful DC 20

Heal check extracts the worm and kills it in the process.

A Small, Medium, or Large creature slain by the worm

rises as a spawn of Kyuss (MM2 186) 1d6+4 rounds later.

Smaller creatures rot away, while larger creatures gain the

zombie template.

Fissure:  There  are  two  types  of  fissures  found  on  the

battlefield.  Small  fissures  cost  2  squares  of  movement  to

enter and increase the DC of Tumble checks by 2. Wide fissures

are 30 feet deep. It takes a DC 10 Climb check to climb the

fissures walls.

Characters ending their movement in a space containing a

small fissure or adjacent to a space containing a wide fissure

must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or contract Kyusss

gift. The incubation period is instantaneous, and the disease

deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of

Wisdom damage.

Obelisk: Before Kyuss escapes the obelisk, the stone emits

an aura of madness in a 20-foot radius. Each round on its turn

a living creature remains in the area, it must succeed on a DC

25 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This is a

supernatural effect. Once Kyuss escapes, the aura ceases.

The  bizarre  circumstances  of  this  ritual  modify  the

usual effects that occur when someone attempts to destroy

a sphere of annihilation. Casting a gate spell on the sphere

catapults everything within a 180-foot radius into an alter-

nate Material Plane. Touching the sphere with a rod of

cancellation causes the sphere to explode and deals 20d610

points of damage to everything in a 600-foot radius. At

your  option,  once  the  Worm  that  Walks  has  been  dealt

with or has left the island, a divine power can intervene

to stop the catastrophe.

A gate spell or a rod of cancellation has the same effect if

used on the sphere before it reaches the well of many worlds.

If the sphere is sent to an alternate Material Plane, the obe-

lisk goes along with it (and probably the PCs as well). Edwin

will continue with his ritual, moving the sphere of annihila-

tion toward the obelisk. If the sphere is destroyed by a rod

of cancellation, Kyuss is set free after 10 rounds, but he takes

20d610 points of damage as though he had been in range

of the explosion.

ho can stand against the might of Zargon the

Returner? Surely, no man is strong enough

of courage and skill to face my master in

combat. No god would dare confront him,

for he has brought low others before. Nay,

when Zargon awakens, all shall tremble as the world is

born anew in his foul image.

Dorn, Ascendant of Zargon

Despised by the baatezu, feared by the gods, and

all but forgotten by mortals, Zargon the Returner

struggles to escape his prison to once more con-

quer the earth and drown the world with rivers

of his slime.

BACKGROUND

Many centuries ago, a mighty kingdom named

Cynidicea stood in the heart of a massive and track-

less wasteland. It reclaimed the land from the desert,

transforming  it  into  fertile  farmland.  The  people

prospered, and the nation achieved great advances

in magic, science, and technology.

As with all cultures, it didnt last. The kingdoms

success bred complacency and decadence, and the

population plunged itself into excess. This laxity

enabled a bloodthirsty cult to come to power and

perform unspeakable sacri ces to their dark god,

Zargon. For years, the kingdom declined, languishing

under the yoke of oppression, until a great barbarian horde

smashed the nation, slaughtered the people, and scattered

them across the lands. (Knowledge [history] or [religion]

DC 25)

Though barbarians need little provocation to attack soft

cities, the army attacking the kingdom had long suffered

depredations at the hands of the cultists. The cult of Zargon

needed human sacri ces to feed to its god, and when its

members exhausted themselves of nonbelievers and crimi-

nals from their own people, they enslaved others for this

purpose. A charismatic barbarian leader named Zankar

gathered the tribes and sacked the city, having lost too many

of his kinsmen to the madmen of Cynidicea. (DC 30)

The tribal leader made a terrifying discovery when his

horde tore through the nations capital city: The god they

worshiped was no otherworldly being; it was a terrifying

monster that lorded over them all, demanding appalling

sacri ces to appease its dreadful hunger. The streets were

slick with blood and a disgusting slime. (DC 35)

Zankar realized the only way he could preserve his own

people would be to destroy the beast-god, and so he fought

the monster for seven days and nights. Although considered

one of the greatest warriors in the land, he could not kill the

beastas soon as he struck a blow, Zargons wounds would

heal. Zankar grew weary, giving the monster the opportunity

it needed. Within moments, the climactic duel came to a

sudden and bloody end. (DC 40)

The gods blessed Zankar, but their champion failed. The

gods themselves came to the earth to punish the kingdom

and put Zargon to rest. When they appeared, the elder evil

mocked them. Zargon slew some of them and drove off the

rest. Survivors of the barbarian invasion witnessed Zargons

might and feared the world would end, so they  ed into the

caves beneath their city. (DC 45)

Zargon seemed unstoppable, but he had one foe remain-

ing. Eons earlier, Zargon had ruled the Nine Hells of Baator

as  father  of  the  ancient  baatorians,  a  long-extinct  race

that preceded the baatezu. His kingdom was a terrifying

place, filled with running slime and rampant evil. When

Asmodeus and his allies seized the Nine Hells, they purged

the plane of the baatorians, enslaving them and destroying

their lords. Asmodeus butchered most himself, but Zargon

was resilient to the worst attacks. Asmodeus discovered he

could kill the  esh of the beast, but not the horn, so he tore

it from Zargons head and  ung the ha

eful spur out of

the hells and to the Material Plane, where it pierced deep

into the earth. (DC 35)

Driven  from  the  Nine  Hells,  Zargons   esh  re-formed

around his horn, and he turned his attention to the Material

Plane. It took centuries, but he crawled up from the depths

of the earth and set upon the soft mortals dwelling in the

kingdom above. To spare themselves extinction, the people

of the kingdom raised up Zargon as their god and fed him

endless sacri ces to appease his need to kill. (DC 50)

Although the death of the gods did not distress Asmodeus

in the least, the freedom of this elder evil did. Asmodeus

stepped in to stop Zargon for the last time. Since the lord of

Nessus was not a god, he was not vulnerable to the worst of

Zargons powers. Still, he knew he could not slay the beast.

Instead, he imprisoned the elder evil in solid stone, so only

the horn was visible. He then turned to Zargons Cynidicean

worshipers, burying them alive in the tunnels. (DC 55)

GOALS

After  Zargons  horn  fell  from  the  Nine  Hells  of  Baator,

Zargons  esh grew again, re-forming his body around the

horn. Once restored, Zargon was enraged. He craved another

chance to  ght Asmodeus and the other usurpers, but Zargon

knew without his armies he stood little chance of reclaiming

his realm. (Knowledge [history] or [the planes] DC 40)

Zargon climbed the shaft created by his horns descent,

pulling himself through the earth until he emerged centuries

later to  nd himself beneath a massive human city. Zargon

saw these creatures as soft, weak, and useless. He devoured

them in awful numbers, but soon they worshiped him as a

god, something he felt Asmodeus would never attain. Since

his congregation was so willing to feed his hunger, he played

along, killing and eating anything it gave him. (DC 45)

As a side effect of the cultists worship and the deaths of

countless innocents, Zargons in uence contaminated the

land, and strange storms swept across the earth, poisoning it

with brown slime. The slime bred new creatures that Zargon

sought to corral and use as foot soldiers to reclaim his place in

the Nine Hells. But as his power grew, Zargon realized this

world could be his. He had no reason to return to his native

plane when he could claim this one. (DC 50)

ZARGON

IN THE CAMPAIGN

The particulars of the Cynidicean Kingdom, such as place-

ment and cultural speci cs, are loose to make it easier for you

to insert Zargon into the campaign. The ziggurat holding

Zargon should lie in the middle of a large desert, but any

wasteland can serve. Legends about the lost civilization are

hard to come by, suppressed by religious groups hiding the

fact that divine intercession failed and Asmodeus saved the

day. If necessary, you can substitute any powerful evil force

SIGN: EERIE WEATHER

The worship of Zargon causes unrest among the gods, which is

made manifest with strange weather.

Faint: Eerie weather occurs once every 2 weeks and affects

an area of 2d20 square miles in a place of your choosing. The

effects last for 1d4+1 hours.

Moderate: Eerie weather occurs once a week and affects an

area of 2d% square miles. The effects last for 1d8+2 hours.

Strong: Eerie weather occurs once a day and affects an entire

continent  or  large  surface  of  the  planet.  The  effects  last  for

1d12+4 hours.

Overwhelming:  Eerie  weather  occurs  once  an  hour  and  af-

fects the entire world. The effects last for 1d3 hours (because

the duration can be longer than the frequency, the effects often

overlap).

Each time eerie weather occurs, consult the following table

and roll d% twice to determine the exact effect. See Weather,

TIMELINE

The  following  time-

line is intended to help

you construct a campaign

around Zargon.

EL  2:  Dorn,  son  of  high   cultist

Darius and his lover Neheshru,  ees

Cynidicea,  hoping  to

escape his home-

land and make a

life for himself

in the civilized

world.  Along

the way, gnoll

slavers  cap-

ture  him

to sell in

the  slave

markets of

a distant city. The

PCs  come  across

the humanoids and

free  Dorn  and

the  rest  of  the

slaves.

EL  5  (Faint

Sign):  The  high  cult-

ist  Darius  commands  his

people  to  dig  out  Zargon

from  his  prison.

This causes horrif-

ic storms to break

out  as  the  elder  evil

awakens.

Freed from the sla-

vers, Dorn finds his

way to a distant city,

where he soon falls in with a cult

of Juiblex, the demon lord of oozes

(FC1  66).  The  cult  learns  of  his

him  until

origins,  and  the  cultists  torture

they learn all they can. Dorn goes mad and swears his soul

to the Faceless Lord.

An archeologist named Vanessa hires the PCs to accompa-

ny her across the desert to  nd a lost city. During the trek, she

CYNIDICEANS

After the lost city of Cynidicea was sealed underground, centu-

ries of dwelling in darkness changed its people. In addition to

human racial features, Cynidiceans have the following traits.

Low-Light Vision: A Cynidicean can see twice as far as an

ordinary human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar

conditions of poor lighting.

Light  Sensitivity  (Ex):  Cynidiceans  are  dazzled  in  bright

sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

the

from

PCs by one

of Zargons

storms.

Vanessa

flees, alone,

finds

and

the  city,  where

she  is  captured

and  taught  the

deeper  secrets  of

Zargon.

EL  8  (Moderate

Sign):  The  eerie  weather

worsens,  and  the  storms

build  in  intensity.  Re-

ports of corrupting slime

spread across the region,

and more and more inno-

cents are transformed into

mindless killers.

Zargon the Returner

Juiblex  stirs  in  the

Abyss and takes an inter-

est  in  what  happens  on

the  Material  Plane.  The

Faceless  Lord  learns  that

Zargon is behind the up-

heaval and decides to forge

an alliance with the elder

evil  to  work  toward  the

same  goalwidespread

destruction.  Juiblex  com-

mands  Dorn  to  return  to

his homeland and arrange

an alliance with the beast.

Meanwhile, cultists of Zuggtmoy (FC1 79) learn of their

rivals plans and believe that if they succeed, Juiblex would

gain incredible power. Rather than confront the cult, they

kill many people and fabricate evidence to implicate the cult

of Juiblex. The PCs are called to investigate. They learn of

the plot, but also the identities of the true culprits.

EL 11 (Strong Sign): Dorn and his fellow cultists arrive

at the ziggurat, where he meets Vanessa. She seduces him

and convinces him to join her in a coup to take control

of the cult of Zargon. Dorn slays his own father, spilling

his blood onto Zargons horn. This act of treachery speeds

Zargons rebirth, and the world shudders with even more

violent weather.

PCs  concerned  about  the  meteorological  conditions

might be prompted to identify the cause. As they search

for  the  source,  representatives  of  sinister  and  not-so-

sinister powers come forward, each seeking to control the

characters. Each faction tries to manipulate the PCs into

leading it to Zargons resting place. The PCs must play the

groups against one another to learn about the force behind

the storms, the threat Zargon poses, and the location of the

fabled lost city.

EL 12: The PCs once more look for the Lost City, brav-

ing dreadful storms and terrible creatures. They descend

into the earth, confront the various masked factions and

denizens, and learn that Zargon is entombed in the ziggurat

on the surface.

EL 1217 (Overwhelming Sign): The cultists free Zargon

from his prison and the elder evil destroys them all, spewing

his slime and transforming them into his whelps. The PCs

must enter the ziggurat, contend with the horrors inside, and

face the elder evil before it breaks free to wreak havoc.

ZARGON IN EBERRON

Zargon is an abominable creation of the daelkyrs. During

their invasion, he was one of the greatest terrors to stalk the

land, legendary for his resilience to mortal weapons and his

ability to regenerate his wounds. When the daelkyrs were

entrapped deep within Khyber, Zargon  ed into the Demon

Wastes, where he conquered a petty kingdom. He was defeated

and sealed into a prison of his own and now bides his time

to break free and release his former masters.

The Ziggurat and the surrounding Valley of Death lie within

the Demon Wastes, somewhere south of the Lake of Fire in a

sandy stretch of land. The remnants of Cynidicea are remote,

forgotten, and all but ignored; few have reason to travel to

the Demon Wastes, let alone to some obscure city.

ZARGON IN FAERN

When Asmodeus  ung Zargon from the Nine Hells, the elder

evil fell to the lands that became the heart of the Imaskar

Empire. As the nation grew, one small city blossomed over

the very site of Zargons fall. That citys name was Cynidicea.

When the cult of Zargon came to power, the cultists attending

to the beast were slain. If Zargon should return, he would

raise up the madmen who live in the Lost City and form an

army to create a new Imaskar Empire, in his image.

The Valley of Death lies in the Giants Belt on the edge

of  Raurin,  the  Dust  Desert.  A  brown  dragon  makes  its

home in the cliff overlooking the sand-choked valley, bound

here by a great power to ensure that nothing disturbs the

sleeping being.

ZARGON

Zargon stands 30 feet tall from the nest of his squirming

tentacles to the tip of his great black horn. Ones eyes cannot

help but fall upon Zargons monstrous head. A wide maw

 lled with curving teeth stretches across his reptilian face,

and oozing brown slime hangs from his chin and forms

smoking clots on the hardened  esh of his torso. A 7-foot-long

black horn speckled with silver  ecks thrusts out from the

center of his forehead, and pale yellow  uid weeps from its

base. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about Zargon is the

bulging bloody eye just below his horn.

The rest of Zargons form is no less repellent. A muscular

torso bears the signs of countless injuries, crisscrossed with

seeping wounds and pestilential tumors. In place of arms,

Zargon has a knot of  esh at each shoulder, from which six

long tentacles whip out, each with a thorny barb perfect for

embedding into  esh and bone and holding victims fast.

Six thick, muscled tentacles grow from the base of his trunk,

and when he moves, one or more of these appendages darts

out to  nd purchase and drag his awfulness forward, leaving

a stinking trail of bloody slime,  ngers, slippery organs, and

other undigested  esh wherever he travels.

Regeneration (Ex) Cold and  re deal normal damage to

Zargon. If Zargon loses a limb or body part it grows back

in 1 minute. The creature can reattach the severed mem-

ber instantly by holding it to the stump.

Constrict (Ex) Zargon deals 2d6+20 points of damage with a

successful grapple check, in addition to damage from its

tentacle attack.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, Zargon must hit an

opponent of up to Huge size with a tentacle attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. It receives a +2 bonus

on the grapple check for each tentacle that hits. If it wins

the grapple check and maintains the hold in the next

round, it automatically bites the foe at that time.

Slime (Ex) Creatures damaged by Zargons bite attack must

succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or become polluted

with slime. Each day, the victim must succeed on another

save or take 1d6 points of Constitution, Intelligence, and

Charisma damage. Victims reduced to Constitution 0 col-

lapse into a puddle of foul slime, dead. Those reduced to

Intelligence 0 or Charisma 0 become whelps of Zargon

(see page 154). They retain none of their previous abili-

ties. A remove disease or heal spell removes the effect.

Divine Enervation (Su) All divine spellcasters lose the abil-

ity to regain spells so long as they remain within 100

miles of Zargon. This interdiction does not interfere

with spellcasting.

Spew Slime (Ex) Once every 5 rounds, Zargon spews a

60-foot cone of brown slime as a swift action. All living

creatures within the area take 10d6 points of acid damage

(Re ex DC 30 half). Creatures damaged must succeed on

DC 30 Fortitude saves or become polluted (see above).

Summon Ooze (Sp) Automatically summon 1d4+1 corrup-

tures (see page 158); 3/day; caster level 18th.

This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.

Horn (Ex) Zargons horn grants him regeneration 50 and

a +6 resistance bonus on saving throws. Removing the

horn requires a touch attack followed by a DC 39 Strength

check, and doing so makes Zargon lose its bene ts.

The horn regrows Zargon after 1d4 days. The horn

is destroyed if it is dropped into the Eye of Zargon, far be-

low in the lost city, within one day of Zargons death.

Anathematic Secrecy (Su) Zargon is immune to all divine

divination spell effects.

Nondetection (Su) As the nondetection spell; continuous;

caster level 20th.

Skills Zargon has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard. He can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if dis-

tracted or endangered. He can use the run action while

swimming, provided he swims in a straight line.

DORN

I tried to  ee my heritage, yet no matter where I went the only

choices I could make were to serve him. I have set aside my childish

fears and have resigned myself to whatever end awaits me.

Dorn, High Priest of Zargon

Born in the subterranean city of Cynidicea, Dorn did

everything in his power to escape his homeland, but his past

dogged his steps. He swore his life to Juiblex, only to  nd that

his demonic master sold him to Zargon. Now, with loyalties

divided and madness  lling his head, he has returned to the

place of his birth, where he grimly awaits his destiny.

GOALS

Dorn doesnt want to serve Zargon, but his master has com-

manded it. He must do as he was bidden, so he returned to the

Lost City and the madness of his people. Soon after arriving,

he met Vanessa, who convinced him to slay his father and

take command of the cult. With the  lthy deed done, Dorn

is even more insane and secretly murders his people to quell

the rage growing within him. Given the chance, Dorn would

slay Zargon himself, but he knows such thoughts are mad.

USING DORN

Dorn should be a sympathetic character, an individual who

has become a plaything for greater powers. This is not to say

he isnt capable of wickednessindeed, by the end of the

campaign, his hands should be very bloodybut the PCs

should get the sense he could have been otherwise.

Have the PCs meet Dorn early in the campaign, and

perhaps even rescue him. Portray him in a way that suggests

his innocence and earnestness. He might even be willing

to accompany the characters on their adventures, but his

lack of experience would make him a liability, so hes sent

on his way. When next they meet him, Dorn has endured

many cruelties at the hands of the Faceless Lords cult, and

any humanity in him has been ripped away by the profane

rituals he endured.

DESCRIPTION

Dorn is a Cynidicean and has spent much of his life without

ever seeing the sun. He is pale, with almost translucent skin.

His hair is blond, bordering on white, and he has no pigment

in his eyes, giving them a red cast. He  inches in bright light

and burns and blisters when exposed to the sun.

He carries the weight of Juiblexs corruption. His  esh

gives off a heavy stench. A thin membrane of slime covers

his skin, and even if he washes it off, it returns. To others,

his touch is painful, creating a faint burning sensation.

Of course, hes also crazy. He breaks into barking laughter

at dreadful scenes of suffering and spews curses that cause

all but the most hardened to shrink away in disgust. He can

settle his evil impulses with the sight of blood, so he cuts

himself to let the dribbling  uid coax him to sleep.

VANESSA MACKELROY

When they took me, I wept for seven days. I tried to escape, tried

to  ee, but each time they pulled me back. I realized perhaps I was

supposed to be here, supposed to learn from these peopleand

learn I did.

Vanessa Mackelroy, High Priestess of Zargon

An expert on dead  gods, Vanessa had traveled the world

recovering samples from lost religions to understand the

cultures behind them. Her career came to an abrupt end when

she sought the Lost City. What she learned from the masked

inhabitants of the madhouse destroyed her respect for the

gods, setting a new course for her as a priestess of Zargon.

GOALS

Vanessas time with the cult altered her personality. Instead

of the detached archeologist she once was, she is a wanton

hedonist, obsessed with pleasure and dulling her senses by

sampling the bizarre drugs used by the Cynidiceans. She craves

the oblivion that intoxication brings and fears she has reached

the limits of what these strange people can offer her.

USING THIS MINION

Like  Dorn,  Vanessa  transforms  over  the  course

of  the  campaign.  When  the  PCs  first  meet

her,  she  should

be  detached  and

businesslike. Shes

friendly enough, but

has  trouble  connect-

ing with others. After she

falls  in  with  the  Cynidiceans,

she  abandons  her  pursuit  of  knowl-

edge, looking into herself for the answers

she seeks. What she  nds is emptiness

perfect, endless emptiness.

At  rst, Vanessa relies on her archivist

abilities, but later she focuses on entro-

pomancer powers.

DESCRIPTION

Vanessa spent her entire life hiding

her tie ing heritage, wearing heavy

clothing  to  conceal  the  dark  mark-

ings speckling the skin of her arms

and  chest.  With  her  descent  into

profligacy,  she  now  exults  in  the

strangeness  her  fiendish  blood

grants her. She has long black hair

and  dark  circles  under  her  eyes.

The black spots on her skin move,

as though a creature were writh-

ing beneath her flesh. Her ears

are  slightly  pointed,  upswept,

and pierced a dozen times each.

She cuts herself and packs the

wounds with powders, oozes, and

gels. She claims the pain is exqui-

site. The wreckage of her  esh testi es to how often she

uses these strange drugs.

Entropic Field (Su) As a standard action, Vanessa can sur-

dius and lasts for 7 rounds. Magical healing automatically

fails in the area. Dismissing the  eld is a standard action.

Once per round as a free action, Vanessa can force any

creature in the area to reroll an attack roll, save, or check.

She decides after she knows whether the roll succeeded

or failed, but before the consequences have been calcu-

lated and applied.

Any creature (including Vanessa) taking damage while

within the area takes 1 point of damage each round (at

the end of Vanessas turn) as long as it remains within the

Heal check stops the bleeding.

Dark Knowledge (Ex) Five

times per day, as a

move action, Vanessa

can make a DC 15 Knowl-

edge check to grant an ally

within 60 feet a bene t against

one creature (arcana for a magical beast,

dungeoneering for an aberration, or

religion for an undead). A successful check grants a +1

bonus on attack rolls for 1 minute, and an additional +1

bonus for every 10 points by which she beats the DC.

Vanessa

Alternatively, she can make the check to grant all allies

within 60 feet a +1 bonus on saving throws against the

creatures abilities, and an additional +1 bonus for every

10 points by which she beats the DC. She can use this

ability only once against a particular creature.

150

remains for 7 rounds. She can move the shard up

to 30 feet as a move action or against another

creature within 30 feet as a standard action.

Against objects, the shard deals 5d6 points

of damage and ignores hardness. Against

creatures, she must make a ranged touch

attack (+10 attack modi er), and if success-

ful she deals 5d6 points of damage (For-

titude DC 14 half). Any creature passing

through a square containing the shard

takes damage (Fort DC 14 half), as does

any creature in the same space as the

shard at the start of Vanessas turn.

THE ZIGGURAT

Hidden in the Valley of Death are the ru-

ins of Cynidicea. Little remains of the

city, and if not for the imposing ziggurat

in the center of the ruins, one might

overlook the few exposed stone blocks

and crumbling walls. In spite of the

sites condition, the ziggurat is more

or less intact. Its walls have crumbled

somewhat and a few breaches reach

to the dark secrets within, but the

massive structure stands de ant

of time and the harsh terrain.

The ziggurat is a stepped pyr-

amid, with each level rising 20

feet high. Sand conceals most

of the bottom tier. Mounted

on  the  top  of  the  ziggu-

rat are three statues. One

depicts a strong, bearded

man holding a balance and a

javelin. Another depicts a winged

child with two snakes wrapped around its body,

and the third is of a beautiful woman. Over the

centuries, the wind has erased all the statues  ne detail.

KEY FEATURES

Each tier of the ziggurat (there are  ve in all) serves as a

discrete level and connects to lower and higher levels by

carved staircases cut into the stone. Ceiling heights reach 18

feet except in the hallways, where the ceiling drops to 10 feet

high. The upper levels can be developed in extensive detail if

Adventurers make preparations for an assault on the ziggurat

desired, but by the time the PCs reach the ziggurat, Zargon

should soon be freed, and theres neither time nor need to

detail every inch of this place.

Before Zargon was sealed in the  oor, lower levels provided

access to the Lost City far below. Whether these levels remain

or the Lost City can still be accessed is up to you.

Entrances

Unless you wish to expand this adventure site to include the

upper levels, the PCs have to enter through the front doors

leading  to  area  A.  However,  20  feet  of  sand  prevents  this.

Characters  might  use  teleportation  and  divination  spells

(subject to the limits imposed by Zargon) to circumvent this

barrier. If not, it takes 20 hours to clear out a passage by hand

(or  ve hours each for four characters).

Lighting

Lamps that burn human fat for fuel illuminate the main level.

The fuel is poor and gives off more smoke than light. Each lamp

sheds shadowy illumination in a 10-foot radius. The lamps hang

from hooks every 20 feet in the corridors and might or might

not be lit in individual rooms, depending on the occupants.

Doors

Doors throughout are closed and locked. All locks use the

same keys, and each cultist carries a key on his person. The

cultists shut and lock any door they pass throughto leave

one open warns that intruders are inside.

Locked Lead Door: 2 inches thick; hardness 10; hp 60;

Open Lock DC 30; break DC 28.

Walls

The walls between rooms are reinforced masonry, and thicker

walls  count  as  magically  treated  hewn  stone.  Lead  sheets

have been buried within all walls, ruining certain divination

spells such as locate object.

Thin Walls (Reinforced Masonry): 1 foot thick; break

DC 45; hardness 8; hp 180; Climb DC 15.

Thick Walls (Magically Treated Hewn Stone): 3 feet

thick or thicker; break DC 70; hardness 16; hp 1,080; Climb

DC 22.

Floors

The floors are flagstone. In breached areas, light rubble

increases the DCs of Balance and Tumble checks by 2.

DEFENSES

The cult is ready for an attack, so three sets of guards monitor

the corridors. Each group consists of  ve guards.

If combat breaks out, the closest guards are entitled to Listen

checks. Those who succeed go to investigate. Guards in room 12

respond to sounds of  ghting in encounter 103 (page 158).

Dorn  and  Vanessa  will  investigate  if  they  hear  combat

break out within 50 feet of them. Otherwise, they move to

encounter 103 to make their stand alongside Zargon.

Cult Guards (5 per group): 59 hp; see page 156.

ENCOUNTER AREAS

The following locations  correspond to those indicated on

the ziggurat map.

A. Main Entry Chamber

Two rows of statues depicting animal-headed people sup-

port  the  high  ceiling  of  this  massive  chamber.  Mosaics

recounting the rise and fall of Cynidicea adorn the walls

behind the statues. Bright light fills the corridor to the

south, revealing more mosaics. The wide corridor ends at

a T intersection.

A  character  who  examines  the  northwest  corner  of  the

room and succeeds on a DC 25 Search check discover a hidden

trapdoor. Lifting the lid reveals a ladder descending into the

darkness. This passage leads the subterranean city.

The southern passage ends at an illusory wall.

B. Empty Room

The  oor of this chamber drops 6 feet. At the bottom is a

shattered stone box. An acrid stench  lls the air.

C. Storage Room

Wine racks cover the north and east walls and casks cover

the west, as do the remains of several shattered casks. The

 oor here is black and sticky.

D. Crushing Wall Trap (EL 10)

This passage is trapped. Stepping anywhere in the indicated

area causes the entire stretch of corridor to slam shut, pulping

anyone caught between the walls.

E. Killing Floor

This room holds piles of corpses, butchered by Dorn (see

encounter 101, page 154). Aside from a collection of animal

masks, the bodies have nothing of value.

F. Gambling Hall

This room was once a gaming hall, as evidenced by the toppled

tables, cards, dice, and scattered coins. Blood soaks the carpet

in the center of the room. The dead are everywhere.

succeeds on a DC 25 Search check  nds a hidden pressure

plate that causes it to open.

G. Cultists Chamber (EL 0 or 14)

This room was once the private quarters for the high cultist

DariusDorns father. The room holds a bed, dresser, writing

desk, and other ordinary furniture. Painted on the east wall

is a grotesque illustration depicting Zargon.

Characters searching the high priests belongings  nd little

of value, but a DC 25 Search check turns up a pearl of power

(4th) lying under the bed.

If Vanessa has not yet been encountered, she is here.

H. Abandoned Cultists Quarters

A moist odor  lls the air of this damp room. Aside from a

sagging bed, shelves, and a small chest, this room is empty.

I. Consultation Room (EL 14 or 15)

A massive table dominates the center of this wood-paneled

room. Six chairs are pushed up to the table on either side.

In each corner stands a gaudy painted urn, and  anking the

door are two gargoyle sneaks.

If Vanessa has not yet been encountered, she is here.

SETUP

The circumstances of this encounter depend on whether

or  not  the  player  characters  sprang  the  trap  in  area  D.

Dorn (D) is here, along with the whelps (W), if he has not

been encountered elsewhere. The black pudding and the

ochre jelly do not appear until Dorn summons them, but

if the PCs sprang the crushing wall trap, he has already

summoned a black pudding.

Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage

to a black pudding. If an attack with such a weapon

hits, the creature splits into two identical puddings,

each with half of the originals current hit points (round

down). A pudding with 10 hit points or fewer cannot be

further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.

Acid (Ex) A black puddings natural attack deals an extra

2d6 points of acid damage. Creatures struck by the

puddings slam attack must succeed on a DC 21 Reflex

save or their armor and clothing dissolve, becoming

immediately useless. A metal or wooden weapon that

strikes a black pudding is destroyed unless it succeeds

on a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution

based.

The puddings acidic touch deals 21 points of

damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the

ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1

round to deal this damage.

Constrict (Ex) A black pudding deals 2d6+4 points of

damage plus 2d6 points of acid damage with a

successful grapple check, in addition to damage from

its slam attack.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a black pudding

must hit an opponent with a slam attack. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple,

it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Horrific Resemblance (Su) A whelp of Zargons body

displays horrific hints of the person it was before its

hideous transformation. Living creatures within 5 feet

of a whelp of Zargon must succeed on a DC 20 Will

save or become stunned for 1 round. A creature that

succeeds on this save is immune to this particular

whelps horrific resemblance ability for 24 hours.

Acid Sheath (Ex) A whelp of Zargons body produces

corrosive slime. Any creature that strikes or touches

a whelp of Zargon with its body, or that grapples a

whelp, automatically takes 2d6 points of acid damage.

A creature takes damage from this ability only once

per turn.

Acid Slam (Ex) A whelp of Zargons slam attacks deal an

extra 2d6 points of acid damage.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a whelp of Zargon

must hit an opponent of up to Medium size with a slam

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity. A whelp

of Zargon has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

Slime (Ex) Whelps of Zargon drip with a noxious slime.

Creatures damaged by a whelps slam attack must

succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or become polluted

with slime. Each day, the victim must succeed on

another DC 24 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of

Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma damage. A

victim reduced to Constitution 0 collapses into a

puddle of foul slime, dead. Those reduced to

Intelligence 0 or Charisma 0 become whelps of Zargon.

They retain none of their previous abilities. A remove

disease or heal spell removes the effect.

Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons and electricity deal

creature splits into two identical jellies, each with half of

the originals current hit points (round down). A jelly with

10 hit points or fewer cannot be further split and dies if

reduced to 0 hit points.

an opponent with a slam attack. It can then attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a hold

and can constrict.

When the PCs open the door, read:

A gruesome scene greets you. Lying on the  oor in a

pool of blood is the headless corpse of a human, its

 esh smoking from acidic handprints. Gathered

around the body and tearing at its  esh are three

mounds of dripping brown jelly, reminiscent of

humanoids in their postures and movements.

Crouching in a corner is a human witness to this

atrocity. He yells, Kill them. All of them!

TACTICS

The whelps of Zargon ooze forward to attack the  rst char-

acter they sense. The make slam attacks each round against

the closest creature. If they hit, they start grapples as free

actions. A whelp and its opponent make opposed grapple

FEATURES OF THE AREA

checks.  If  the  whelp  wins,  it  grapples  its  opponent  and

moves  into  its  opponents  space,  dealing  1d6+12  points  of

damage plus 2d6 points of acid damage. On its next turn, it

attempts to pin the opponent by making another opposed

grapple check. Remember, each time a whelp deals damage,

its opponent must make a Fortitude save to avoid being pol-

luted by slime.

If Dorn is here and the trap was not sprung, he uses his  rst

action to summon a black pudding. He then retreats to the

far corner. On his next turn, he uses summon ooze to summon

an ochre jelly and then draws his rapier. Once his minions

are engaging the PCs, Dorn follows up with corrosive spew,

then moves toward an injured player character, drawing his

kukri as he does.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Lighting: All rooms except the secret chambers are lit with

shadowy  illumination,  granting  concealment  (20%  miss

chance).

Tapestries: Tapestries depicting grotesque scenes of human

sacrifice hang in one of the secret rooms and in southern room.

A  character  standing  behind  a  tapestry  gains  concealment

(20% miss chance). Climbing a tapestry requires a DC 10

Climb check.

Secret Doors: Two secret doors lead to concealed chambers.

A  DC  25  Search  check  in  the  area  reveals  them  and  their

opening mechanisms.

Desk: The desk is a simple wooden writing desk. The desk

stands 4 feet off the ground. Standing on it grants a character

a +1 bonus on attack rolls against creatures below him.

Bed: The bed is a stained feather mattress. There is nothing

of interest on the bed, but searching it exposes the characters to

slimy doom (contact; Fort DC 14; incubation 1 day; 1d4 Con

plus second Fort save or 1 point becomes drain; DMG 292).

Stove: This is a simple stove. A fire burns inside. Standing

on the stove grants a +1 bonus on attack rolls made against

lower  creatures,  but  the  character  takes  1d2  points  of  fire

damage each round.

Ladder: In the eastern secret room, theres an iron ladder

bolted against the north wall (Climb DC 0). If your adventure

includes the upper levels, this ladder leads there. If not, the

exit is bricked up. Characters descending from the upper levels

enter this level from here.

Treasure  Hoard:  The  western  secret  room  contains  the

cults accumulated wealth, including 7,500 pp, 3,000 gp, 24

gemstones (average value 100 gp), ring of minor acid resistance,

lesser Silent metamagic rod, wand of cure serious wounds (32 charges),

candle of lawful invocation, and a cognizance crystal (7 points) (re-

place with a +3 kukri if no psionic characters).

Mettle (Ex) If a cultist of Zargon makes a successful

Fortitude or Will save against an attack that normally

would have a partial effect on a successful save, he

instead negates the effect.

Light Sensitivity (Ex) A cultist of Zargon is dazzled in bright

sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Greater Hexblades Curse (Su) Three times per day as a free

action, a cultist can bestow a curse on a single target

within 60 feet. The target takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls,

saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage

rolls for 1 hour. A DC 18 Will save negates the effect.

TACTICS

The cult guards shout the alarm and charge the PCs on their

action. They use Power Attack later if they hit on the  rst

round. Two rounds later, the thralls of Juiblex join the  ght,

rage, and charge the PCs.

Two rounds later, Vanessa (if present) and the cultist of

Zargon  arrive.  The  cultist  targets  melee  combatants  with

greater hexblades curse, then peppers the PCs with cross-

bow bolts. If this proves ineffective, he casts bulls strength

and entropic shield, then leaps into battle.

Vanessa supports the melee combatants with spells, cast-

ing  ame strike on the largest concentration of characters,

followed by sound burst and prayer. If she faces spellcasters,

she begins the  ght by casting spell resistance on herself, then

obscuring mist to level the playing  eld.

SETUP

Use this encounter when the PCs are ready to face Zargon.

If they arrive before the elder evils sign is overwhelming,

this room contains twelve cultist guards (see encounter

102 for statistics) working to extract their master. Dorn

or Vanessa can be placed here as well.

Otherwise,  when  the  PCs  arrive,  Zargon  has  trans-

formed his servants into corruptures and whelps. Place

creatures where indicated on the map. Have the players

place  their  miniatures  anywhere  on  the  north  side  of

the  room  up  to   ve  feet  below  the  illusory  walls  if  they

approached from the north or near the door they entered

if they approached from the south.

When the players have placed their miniatures, read:

Dominating the end of an old ruined chapel is a

30-foot-tall monstrosity, humanoid except for the

masses of tentacles emerging from the lower half of

Zargon

Regeneration (Ex) Cold and fire deal normal damage to

whelps of Zargon.

Horrific Resemblance (Su) A whelp of Zargons body

displays horrific hints of the person it was before its

hideous transformation. Living creatures within 5 feet

of a whelp of Zargon must succeed on a DC 20 Will

save or become stunned for 1 round. A creature that

succeeds on this save is immune to this particular

whelps horrific resemblance ability for 24 hours.

Acid Sheath (Ex) A whelp of Zargons body produces

corrosive slime. Any creature that strikes or touches a

whelp of Zargon with its body, or that grapples a whelp,

automatically takes 2d6 points of acid damage. A

creature takes damage from this ability only once per

turn.

Acid Slam (Ex) A whelp of Zargons slam attacks deal an

extra 2d6 points of acid damage.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a whelp of Zargon

must hit an opponent of up to Medium size with a slam

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity. A

whelp of Zargon has a +4 racial bonus on grapple

checks.

Slime (Ex) Whelps of Zargon drip with a noxious slime.

Creatures damaged by a whelps slam attack must

succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or become polluted

with slime. Each day, the victim must succeed on

another DC 24 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of

Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma damage. A

victim reduced to Constitution 0 collapses into a

puddle of foul slime, dead. Those reduced to

Intelligence 0 or Charisma 0 become whelps of Zargon.

They retain none of their previous abilities. A remove

disease or heal spell removes the effect.

Failure indicates the character can still act but cannot run or

charge in this round.

Slime: Characters moving through the slime become pol-

luted unless they succeed on DC 30 Fortitude saves. Those who

fail must succeed on an additional Fortitude save each day or

take 1d6 points of Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma

damage. Victims reduced to Constitution 0 collapse into a

puddle of slime, dead. Those reduced to Intelligence 0 or

Charisma 0 are transformed into whelps of Zargon and retain

none of their previous abilities. A remove disease or heal spell

removes the effect.

FEATURES OF THE AREA

Lighting: This room is dark.

Pew: Large or smaller characters entering spaces containing

pews must spend 2 squares of movement. They receive a +1

circumstance  bonus  on  attack  rolls  made  to  hit  opponents

standing on the ground. In addition, characters standing on

pews are not subject to the effect of the slime on the ground.

Jumping from one pew to another requires a DC 20 Jump check

for a standing jump or a DC 10 Jump check for a running jump.

Failure by 5 or more indicates the character stumbles and falls

to the ground, exposing him to the slime.

A pew has hardness 5, 50 hit points, and break DC 30.

Illusory Wall: Illusory walls stretch across the north edge

of the room (DC 18, caster level 16th).

Broken Statue: Three massive statues once stood at the end

of the chapel, but the cultists of Zargon have defaced and shat-

tered them; the rubble covers the floor around them. Each statue

stands 10 feet high and ends in a jagged break. A DC 15 Climb

check allows a character to climb a statue.

Dense Rubble: Entering a square containing dense rubble

costs 2 squares of movement. Dense rubbles increases the DCs

of Balance and Tumble checks by 5 and imposes a 2 penalty

on Move Silently checks. Running or charging through dense

rubble is impossible.

Steps: A short set of steps leads up to the dais at the end of

the room. Fighting while standing on a higher step grants a

character a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls.

Pit: Zargon emerges from a deep pit dug by his cultists, who

were rewarded for their labor by being transformed into slime.

The pit is 37 feet deep, and the bottom is covered with slime.

A character falling in the pit takes 2d6 points of falling damage

and must contend with the slime at the bottom. The pits walls

can be climbed with a DC 10 Climb check.

Cracked Floor: Spaces containing cracked floor count as

uneven  flagstone.  When  running  or  charging  through  these

its body and whipping out from its shoulders. It

glares at you with the one massive, bloody eye set

beneath its 7-foot-long black horn.

Three masses of slime rise from the  oor, and

human-shaped bags of slime slide across the surface.

TACTICS

Whelps  engage  the  closest  living  creature.  Those  hitting

their opponents initiate a grapple. Both the whelp and its

opponent make opposed grapple checks. If the whelp wins,

it grapples with its opponent and moves into its opponents

space, dealing 1d6+12 points of damage plus 2d6 points of

acid damage. On its next turn, it attempts to pin the oppo-

nent by making another opposed grapple check. Remember,

each time a whelp deals damage, its opponent must make a

Fortitude save to avoid being polluted by the slime.

The corruptures make slam attacks, but each round one

creature uses acid burst, so after three rounds each corrup-

ture has used this ability once.

Zargon starts by using his spew slime ability, blanketing

the area with the awful stuff. While the oozes attend to the

PCs, Zargon uses spell-like abilities, preferring lightning bolt,

slime wave, and mind fog. It reserves acid fog for when the PCs

come with reach.

When  ghting in melee combat, Zargon is reckless, using

a  9-point  Power  Attack  each  round.  Zargon   ghts  until

destroyed, knowing he will rise once more in a few days.

Sounds  of  combat  in  this  room  attract  the  attention  of

guards throughout the complex. If they are still alive, the

cult guards from area L start moving in the second round of

combat, while any remaining guards in the halls head toward

this room starting in round 3. If Vanessa and Dorn have not

been encountered elsewhere, they begin moving starting in

round 5.

CONCLUSION

Even if the characters kill Zargon, the elder evil regrows in

a matter of days unless they destroy the horn as well. The way

to destroy this elder evil is to drop the horn in the smoking

crater called the Eye of Zargon. This volcanic crater lies far

below the earth in the cave housing the lost city of Cynidicea,

on the far shores of Lake Moldvay. Such a quest is the subject

of another adventure. . . .
