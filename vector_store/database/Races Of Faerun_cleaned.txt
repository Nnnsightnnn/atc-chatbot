Faern is home to hundreds of intelligent peoples, divided

into  thousands  of  tribes,  clans,  nations,  and  ethnicities.

Some of these races are monstrous predators armed with

terrible powers and some are bloodthirsty marauders who ter-

rorize more civilized folk, but most are good-hearted folk who

wish to live in peace in whatever manner they find most pros-

perous  and  fulfilling.  This  great  diversity  in  physical  nature,

magical talent, beliefs, and values creates an incredible patch-

work of cultures that spans the entire continent, a tapestry so

complex  and  wondrous  that  no  one  mortal  can  hope  to  ever

comprehend it in its entirety.

Races of Faern examines almost 50 of the most important,

noteworthy,  or  widespread  peoples  to  be  found  in  the  lands  of

Faern, focusing on races that are most likely to give rise to ad-

venturing  characters.  While  giants  and  dragons  are  certainly

intelligent and can wield enormous influence over the portions

of the world they claim as their own, they are not usually found

among adventuring bands. At the other end of the spectrum, a

creature such as a troglodyte or quaggoth might be inclined to

take up the wandering life of an adventurer, but their numbers

are so few and their societies so reclusive and isolated that they

simply  havent  made  much  of  a  mark  on  the  face  of  Faern.

Therefore, this book concentrates on eight major races (humans,

dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs and orcs, halflings,

and  planetouched)  and  a  number  of  minor  races  ranging  from

aarakocras to yuan-ti.

What You Need to Play

This  sourcebook  requires  the  DUNGEONS &  DRAGONS Players

Handbook, DUNGEON MASTERs Guide, Monster Manual, and the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. You will also find it help-

ful to have a copy of Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faern,

although you do not need that book to make use of this one.

The  following  races  mentioned  in  this  book  are  described

in  Monsters of Faern: aarakocra, arctic dwarf, urdunnir, wild

dwarf,  feyri,  tanarukk,  Dekanter  goblin,  wemic,  and  yuan-ti

(tainted one). In this book, you will find sufficient information

in the racial descriptions of these races to play them as player

characters,  but  you  should  refer  to  Monsters of Faern if  you

need their monster entries for your game.

Races of Faern also complies with the revised Players Hand-

book,  DUNGEON MASTERS Guide,  and  Monster  Manual.  Some

rules  revisions  have  been  included  in  this  product,  such  as  the

changes in the lycanthrope template, how monsters acquire feats

and skills, name changes of feats, spells and skills, and details of race

and class abilities. If you have difficulty in identifying a feat, skill,

or spell, its most likely a change of nomenclature for the revision.

Race, Subrace, and

Ethnc Group

Throughout this book the terms race, subrace, and ethnic group

(or  ethnicity)  are  used  to  describe  various  peoples  of  Faern.

These  terms  have  a  specific  meaning  in  the  context  of  the

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.

A race is a distinct species of intelligent creatures who share

many  of  the  same  qualities.  In  Faern,  creatures  of  different

races can often produce children who can in turn have children

of their own, so the term race does not quite measure up to the

strict  scientific  definition  of  what  constitutes  a  species.  Race  is

important in game terms because it describes a set of rules shared

by all characters of that race. While appearance, class, skills, and

talents  may  vary  wildly  from  individual  to  individual,  all

humans  share  the  same  racial  adjustments  and  advantagesa

bonus feat at 1st level and extra skill points as compared to other

races, reflecting the human drive to excel and achieve.

While  all  humans  have  the  same  game  advantages,  not  all

dwarves or elves are the same. These races have a more marked

adaptation  to  their  respective  lifestyles,  and  over  a  relatively

short  time,  distinctive  racial  characteristics  appear  in  isolated

populations. A subrace consists of those individuals within a race

who share a distinctive and unique set of racial advantages and

drawbacks. For example, sun elf culture focuses on learning and

3

INTRODUCTION

lore over the games of agility and balance other elves favor, and

so sun elves have a bonus to their Intelligence scores instead of

their Dexterity scores. In game terms, a subrace is, for all intents

and purposes, a race of its own, but all the subraces of a particu-

lar race share many of the same qualities and are related. When

parents  of  different  subraces  have  a  child,  the  child  almost

always takes after one parent or the other.

An  ethnic  group  is  a  group  of  people  of  the  same  race  who

share some minor physical characteristics and common cultural

heritage. Unlike a subrace, two ethnic groups of the same race are

identical to each other in game terms. Humans of Chondathan

stock  are  not  any  stronger,  tougher,  smarter,  or  more  skilled

than humans of Rashemi stockbut any native of Faern can

tell  a  Rashemi  from  a  Chondathan  at  a  glance.  While  distinct

ethnicities are only described for the human nations in this book,

its  safe  to  assume  that  any  race  not  differentiated  by  distinct

subraces has a wide variety of physical characteristics. For exam-

ple, a centaurs human half might have pale skin, or copper skin,

or skin of a rich mahogany hue.

How to Read a

Racial Entry

Each major race chapter is broken into a number of entries based

on ethnic group or subrace. The information presented in these

entries generally follows the order described here.

If a race does not have an entry for a category (such as racial

feats), the header is omitted.

HISTORY

A summary of the history of each race, subrace, or ethnic group

appears here. In several cases, the history of a particular group is

covered in the description of a nation or race in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign  Setting,  so  you  may  be  referred  back  to

that book.

OUTLOOK

An overview of how people of the race in question carry them-

selves, conduct their business, and view the world around them.

This will naturally be a gross generalization for most races. Some

Calishites are murderous cutthroats, some are shy scholars, and

others are crusading heroes. But, taken as a whole, the typical Cal-

ishite can be expected to be cosmopolitan, urbane, and prone to

some amount of indolence. The outlook of a race centers on what

people of that race find important and worth striving for.

Characters:  Character  classes  particularly  appealing  to  mem-

bers of the race are described here, along with some of the expla-

nation for why this is so.

Favored  Class: The  races  favored  class  is  noted  here,  along

with a brief discussion of the reasons why the race tends to follow

the class. Humans and half-elves have a favored class of Any,

and  do  not  count  their  highest-level  class  when  determining

whether a multiclassed character suffers an experience penalty.

Prestige Classes: Prestige classes popular among characters of

this race or subrace are noted here, along with the reasons why.

MAJOR RACE INFORMATION

The eight major races described in this book each begin with a

general overview of the races culture, outlook, and history. Each

subrace  or  ethnic  group  description  contains  more  specific  and

detailed information on these topics for the specific race.

SOCIETY

This section is a brief description of how folk of the race organ-

ize their lives, families, and governments, and what social struc-

tures surround the individual.

RACIAL DATA

Each ethnic group, subrace, or minor race begins with a short set of

entries offering a quick synopsis of the races game characteristics.

Regions: Regions in which the subrace or ethnic group is found.

A character of this race or ethnicity may choose a region listed

here as his or her home region, as described in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting. In the case of a human ethnic group,

any region in which the group is present as the primary or sec-

ondary population may be selected. New regions are italicized and

appear at the end of the racial entry.

Automatic and bonus languages are determined by your choice

of home region.

Racial Feats: Any new feats introduced in this book that are

specific to the race at hand are listed here.

Racial Prestige Classes: If there are any prestige classes specif-

ically associated with the race, these are noted here.

Level Adjustment: If the race or subrace comes with a level

adjustment, it is given here. If that race or subrace has racial Hit

Dice (that is, a typical member of that race starts play with more

than the single HD of most player character races), its effective

character  level  is  given  as  well,  combining  its  level  adjustment

and racial Hit Dice. See page 6 for details on how level adjust-

ments and ECL affect character level and advancement.

LANGUAGE AND LITERACY

This section discusses the primary language used by a race, includ-

ing  its  origins  and  evolution.  Secondary  languages  particularly

common among the people of that race are mentioned also.

Characters of all player character classes except barbarian are

literate, but this is not universally true of characters with NPC

classes. In general, experts and nobles will almost always be liter-

ate, and adepts usually so. Literacy among commoners and war-

riors  tends  to  vary  greatly  by  culture.  Characters  who  are  not

literate by their choice of class or race may become literate by

spending 2 skill points to do so.

ABILITIES AND RACIAL FEATURES

Any  racial  adjustments  to  ability  scores,  racial  proficiencies  in

particular weapons, racial bonuses to specific skills, and the like

are  listed  in  this  section  in  bullet-point  format.  Any  extraordi-

nary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su) ability is described

here,  as  well  as  level  adjustments  and  effective  character  level

(ECL) of more powerful races.

When  this  information  has  already  been  provided  in  the

Players  Handbook or  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Setting,

this section is omitted.

INTRODUCTION

MAGIC AND LORE

Most races have their own traditions of spellcasting and favored

spells and items. As with the racial outlook, this is a generaliza-

tion; while Calishites are renowned for their skill with elemental

spells, any particular Calishite wizard might choose to specialize

in any of the schools of arcane magic.

Spells  and  Spellcasting:  Any  new  racial  spells  or  any  feats

related to spellcasting from the Appendix are noted here under

Spellcasting Tradition and Unique Spells.

Magic Items: Many races have a particular affinity for magic

items of a particular sort. Common items are devices whose man-

ufacture is almost institutionalized among those people. Due to

the prevalence of common items in places where the race lives,

they may be purchased at a 10% discount in any place where folk

of that race gather.

Iconic items are specific magic items that are the specialty of

item-crafters of that race. They include a 10% discount in the

listed price, reflecting the fact that the spellcasters of that race

or  group  have  handed  down  unusual  training  and  tradition  in

the  manufacture  of  those  items,  and  so  it  is  simply  easier  for

such an item to be crafted by a caster who meets the racial pre-

requisite. Since it is easier for a character of the proper race to

make the iconic item, he tends to charge less for it. Other folk

beside  shield  dwarves  make  +1  keen  battleaxes,  but  the  shield

dwarves Foesplitter axes are simply the most prevalent +1 keen

battleaxes around.

RACIAL DEITIES

A  brief  discussion  of  deities  particularly  important  to  the  race

appears here. While most races may venerate many more gods

than those that are listed here, these are the ones most important

to the race.

RELATIONS WITH OTHER RACES

This  section  describes  how  the  race  or  subrace  gets  along  with

other groups around it. Once again, this is something of a stereo-

type,  since  individuals  may  sometimes  form  strong  bonds  with

folk of races their own race does not normally get along with

or harbor hatred for folk normally allied to their own race.

EQUIPMENT

While  most  equipment  in  the  Players  Handbook  equipment

chapter  is  available  in  any  sufficiently  large  city,  many  races

have a particular affinity for equipment of a certain type.

Equipment listed as a common item in this section is generally

available for a 10% discount in cities or settlements of that race.

This does not apply to magical versions of those items unless the

item happens to be an iconic magic item for the race.

Any unique items or new items mentioned in this section are

described in detail in the Equipment section of the Appendix.

Arms  and  Armor:  Traditions  of  weapon  manufacture  and

armorsmithing are some of the most distinctive characteristics

of a races technology and society. In some cases, these preferred

weapons and arms were derived long ago for very good reasons.

Elves, due to their keen hand-eye coordination and frail builds, have

always favored ranged combat over melee, and therefore are among

Faerns best archers. In other cases, the preference is based on

nothing more than taste. Calishites admire curved swords, and thus

favor scimitars and falchions over longswords and greatswords.

Animals  and  Pets:  While  animals  are  not  really  equipment,

working animals and pets common to a race are described here.

Some  of  these  creatures  are  described  in  Monsters  section  of

the Appendix.

REGION

Finally, races or ethnic groups without a character region from

the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting are provided a char-

acter region here. A character must choose one of the preferred

classes for the region to qualify for the regional feats and bonus

equipment listed as a 1st-level character. A higher-level charac-

ter may choose feats specific to a region even if that region is not

her home region or her class is not preferred there, but she must

gain  at  least  2  ranks  in  Knowledge  (local),  specializing  in  that

region, in order to do so.

Level Adjustments and ECL

Some races are significantly more powerful than the standard

character  races.  To  provide  the  Dungeon  Master  with  a  tool

for balancing characters of these races with characters of the

Acquiring a Template

On occasion, a character may in the course of play acquire a

monster template. In many cases, such as the transformation

into  a  vampire,  the  character  becomes  a  monster  under  the

DMs  control,  but  some  templates  (such  as  lycanthrope)  do

not mandate the loss of the character. If the template carries

a  level  adjustment,  the  characters  effective  character  level

instantly increases to the new total of her character level and

level adjustment. Until the character earns enough experience

points to catch up to her increased ECL, she cant add any

more class levels. In effect, becoming a werewolf and gaining

2 racial Hit Dice and a level adjustment of +1 means that a

character  will  be  stuck  at  her  current  class  level  until  she

acquires  enough  experience  points  to  qualify  for  the  next

character level, based on her new ECL. A character in this sit-

uation gains a short-term edge in the benefits of her new tem-

plate, but pays for it with a long wait until she can add her

next class level.

Example: Tauroc is a 6th-level dwarven fighter with 17,700

XP. He needs 21,000 XP to reach 7th level. However, Tauroc is

bitten by a werewolf and contracts lycanthropy. Since the effec-

tive character level modifier for werewolf is +3, Tauroc now has

an ECL of 9. He cant add another class level until he reaches

45,000 XP, which is what a 9th-level character needs to achieve

10th level.

standard  races,  the  powerful  races  have  a  special  characteristic

referred to as level adjustment. Add the level adjustment to the

number of class levels your character has to determine his or her

effective character level, or ECL. Some creatures have racial Hit

Dice,  so  their  starting  ECL  equals  their  level  adjustment  plus

their racial Hit Dice.

If a race has racial Hit Dice, you can play a character of that

race with no class levels as a character of a level equal to the level

adjustment  plus  racial  Hit  Dice.  For  example,  a  centaur  starts

with an ECL of 7 (level adjustment of +3 plus 4 Hit Dice). You

can play a centaur with no class levels as a 7th-level character, or

a 4th-level centaur fighter as a 11th-level character.

Most  humanoid  races  do  not  have  any  racial  Hit  Dice.  For

them,  you  simply  add  the  level  adjustment  to  your  characters

class level to determine their ECL. For example, a 1st-level drow

in any class is equivalent to a 3rd-level character (one class level,

plus a level adjustment of +2). You could play a 4th-level drow

wizard as a 6th-level character, or a 10th-level drow wizard as a

12th-level character.

For  your  convenience,  weve  extended  the  experience  point

table for characters of races with a high ECL. Refer to Table 1,

on this page.

Characters with a ECL modifier of +1 or higher for racial Hit

Dice or level adjustment begin play with the number of experience

points necessary to be a character of their ECL. For example, a

1st-level svirfneblin fighter has a level adjustment of +3 due to his

race, so he is effectively a 4th-level character. He begins play with

6,000 XP and must reach 10,000 XP before he can add another

class level and become a 2nd-level svirfneblin fighter. Characters

with ECL modifiers of +1 or better should begin play equipped as

characters of their effective character level, not their class level

(refer to Table 224 in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). In the

previous  example,  the  1st-level  svirfneblin  fighter  should  be

equipped as a 4th-level character, not a 1st-level character.

Races that begin with 1 Hit Die based on their class are treated

as 1st-level characters in all respects except the number of expe-

rience  points  they  begin  with  and  the  amount  of  money  with

which they may equip themselves. They begin play with their 1st-

level feat, multiply their skill points by 4, and gain maximum hit

points for their first class Hit Die. Races that begin with racial

Hit Dice beyond their 1st-level class Hit Die are treated a little

differently.

Racial Hit Dice

A number of the minor races, particularly nonhumanoids, begin

play  with  some  number  of  Hit  Dice  derived  from  their  mon-

strous race in addition to any Hit Dice for their class levels. For

6

INTRODUCTION

example, a centaur has 4 Hit Dice as his racial base before he adds

any class levels. These racial Hit Dice have the following effects:

Racial Hit Dice. A character of this race begins with the Hit

Dice  indicated.  He  receives  maximum  hit  points  for  the  first

racial Hit Die and rolls all other Hit Dice normally. He does not

gain maximum hit points for his first class Hit Die if he adds a

character class.

Racial Attack Bonus. The character begins with the base attack

bonus listed. He adds the attack bonus for his class levels to this

number  to  determine  his  overall  base  attack  bonus.  When  the

total  of  his  racial  attack  bonus  and  class-derived  attack  bonus

reaches +6, he gains a second attack of +1, and so on.

Racial Saving Throw Bonuses. The character begins with the

base Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saving throw bonuses listed. He

adds  the  saving  throw  bonuses  for  his  class  levels  to  his  racial

saves to determine his total saving throw bonuses, which are then

modified by the appropriate ability scores, magic items, and other

conditions that modify saving throws.

Racial Skills. Depending on the creature type of the characters

race, he begins with a number of racial skill points. These skill

points  may  be  spent  on  any  non-exclusive  skills  the  character

likes. The character gains quadruple skill points for the first Hit

Die of his raceor, in other words, the number of skill points a

character gains for his racial Hit Dice equals (racial skill point

allowance  per  Hit  Die  +  Intelligence  modifier,  minimum  1)  

(racial Hit Dice +3).

Skills normally possessed by a monster of that race are treated

as class skills (1 skill point purchases 1 skill rank), while all other

skills are cross-class skills (2 skill points purchases 1 skill rank.) The

maximum number of skill ranks allowed equals 3 + the characters

racial Hit Dice + the characters class levels, or half of that number

for cross-class skills. When the character adds his first class level,

he does not gain the 4 multiple for skill points at 1st level.

Racial Feats. Depending on the creature type of the charac-

ters race, he begins with a number of feats. These feats may be

used however the character likes, provided he meets the prereq-

uisites before adding any class levels. Feats requiring other feats

as prerequisites are permissible, as long as the required feats are

selected  at  the  same  time.  Because  the  character  gains  these

racial feats, he does not gain a feat when he adds his first level of

a character class.

FEAT AND ABILITY SCORE INCREASES

For purposes of determining when a character with class levels

and racial Hit Dice gains new feats and ability score increases and

the maximum skill rank allowed, treat each racial Hit Die as 1

character  level  and  consult  Table  2.  Do  not  add  ability  score

increases derived from the characters racial Hit Dice alone. In

effect, you should skip a number of Hit Dice equal to the racial

Hit Dice before assigning a character ability score increases.

Simply  add  the  characters  racial  Hit  Dice  and  class  levels

together  to  determine  his  Total  Hit  Dice  on  Table  2.  Do  not

include any additional level adjustment.

Example: James is creating a centaur ranger to join a party of

13th-level characters. The centaurs ECL is +7, so James can play

a 6th-level centaur ranger and fit in well with the party. The cen-

taur begins with 4 racial Hit Dice; adding 6 levels of ranger gives

Jamess  character  10  total  Hit  Dice.  James  skips  the  ability

increases awarded through 4 total Hit Dice. Between 4 HD (the

centaurs  racial  HD)  and  10  HD  (the  6th-level  centaurs  HD),

Jamess character gains one ability increase at 8 Hit Dice. As a

7

character of 10 Hit Dice, his centaur is entitled to a total of four

featstwo from his centaur Hit Dice, plus additional feats at 6

and 9 Hit Dice.

How to Read a Region

Some  of  races  detailed  in  this  book  have  their  own  regions

(described  in  Chapter  1  of  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting). The choice of a region affects a character in a number

of ways.

Preferred Classes: If a character chooses a region preferred for

her class, she gains the equipment listed for the region in addi-

tion to the starting package or starting money.

Automatic  Languages:  All  characters  from  this  region  auto-

matically know these languages, regardless of Intelligence score.

Bonus Languages: Characters with Intelligence scores of 12 or

higher begin play with one or more bonus languages, which are

chosen from this list.

Regional Feats: If you choose this region, you may select from

regional feats whenever you earn a feat.

Bonus Equipment: Characters with a preferred class can make

a choice from this list. Items marked with an asterisk are mas-

terwork items.

The first great kingdom of the dwarves of Faern was cen-

tered  in  the  great  cavern  of  Bhaerynden  deep  beneath  the

Shaar.  The  first  great  schism  of  the  dwarves  of  Bhaerynden

began more than twelve thousand years ago when Taark Shanat

the Crusader led a great westward migration. These emigrants

eventually became known as shield dwarves and established the

great empire of Shanatar beneath the lands of Amn, Tethyr,

Calimshan,  and  the  Lake  of  Steam.  From  their  number,

Dumathoin created the urdunnir, who moved into the depths

and became creatures of legend. Meanwhile, Bhaerynden fell to

the drow after the elven Crown Wars and the descent of the

dark  elves,  and  the  dwarves  of  southern  Faern  were  driven

into exile.

In  the  millennia  that  followed,  new  divisions  appeared

among  the  Stout  Folk.  The  mind  flayers  of  Oryndoll,  deep

beneath the Shining Plains, enslaved the shield dwarves of Clan

Duergar.  Their  descendants  became  known  as  gray  dwarves

after  throwing  off  the  shackles  of  their  illithid  masters  and

spreading throughout the Underdark. Some dwarves who fled

Bhaeryndens collapse reached the Jungles of Chult, where they

abandoned their subterranean homes. Members of this isolated

branch  eventually  became  known  as  wild  dwarves.  After  the

first drow kingdom of Telantiwar tore itself apart in civil war,

the great cavern of Bhaerynden collapsed to form the Great

Rift.  Those  dwarves  who  resettled  the  caverns  of  the  Deep

Realm surrounding the Great Rift eventually became known as

gold  dwarves.  As  Shanatar  declined,  the  shield  dwarves

migrated north to settle the great kingdoms of the North and

eventually migrated eastward along the shores of the Moonsea

and into the mountains of northcentral Faern.

Today, dwarves are found all across Faern, although the

greatest concentrations are found in the North, the Cold Lands,

the Great Rift, and the Underdark. Although the Stout Folk

are easily segregated into distinct subraces with distinct racial

traits, such distinctions by no means reflect the entirety of

dwarven  diversity.  Numerous  cultural,  historical,  political,

and social divisions remain even within the ranks of a specific

dwarven subrace.

This chapter details six dwarven subraces dwelling above and

below the surface of Faern, whose cultural, linguistic, physical,

and religious traits predominate in large regions of the land.

As  enduring  as  the  earth  from  which  they  were

shaped,  the  Stout  Folk  once  ruled  vast  empires

that  sprawled  on  and  beneath  the  surface  of

Faern. After centuries of decline, most dwarven kingdoms are

gone, but the fruits of their labors survive, unbowed by the pas-

sage of time. In recent years, the Thunder Blessing has sparked a

dwarven renaissance that might one day restore the Stout Folk

to their former glory.

Racial History

Most nondwarven scholars believe that the Stout Folk are an

interloper race, not native to Abeir-Toril, who arrived so long

ago  that  they  have  become  one  with  the  earth  and  stone  of

Faern. However, the collective dwarven racial memory holds

that their ancestors sprang fully formed from the heart of the

world  itself,  fashioned  of  iron  and  mithral  in  the  Soulforge,

shaped by the All-Fathers hammer, and then given life by the

breath  of  Moradin.  The  oldest  myths  claim  that  the  first

dwarves fought their way up from the worlds core to the moun-

tains above, overcoming many dangers along the way through

strength, skill, and force of arms.

The first dwarven settlements appeared in the great moun-

tain range known as the Yehimal, which lies at the juncture of

the three great continents of Faern, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara.

From there, the earliest dwarves migrated into all three lands.

Those who came to Faern settled beneath modern-day Sem-

phar before spreading westward, founding innumerable settle-

ments  along  the  way.  One  isolated  branch  of  this  great

migration settled amid the isolated peaks of the Novularond,

and eventually became known as the arctic dwarves.

Arctic  dwarves,  who  call  themselves  the  Inugaakalikurit,  are

the  isolated  inhabitants  of  Faerns  northernmost  reaches.

Native to the mountains at the heart of the Great Glacier and

other northerly regions, arctic dwarves are little known to the

outside world. Many arctic dwarves are rangers, barbarians, or

fighters, for they hold little interest in the spellcasting arts or

godly worship.

Arctic  dwarves  are  unique  among  the  Stout  Folk  in  that

they do not trace their ancestry back to Bhaerynden, the great

cavern  that  later  fell  to  the  drow  of

Telantiwar  and  now  lies  open  as  the

Great  Rift.  As  such,  they  have  little  in

common with other Stout Folk, lacking any

common political, religious, craft, or magical

traditions.  In  recent  years,  a  handful  of  arctic

dwarves  have  migrated  across  the  icy  northern

wastes  to  establish  new  settlements  along  the

shores of the Great Ice Sea and in the Silver

Marches,  but  for  the  most  part  the  Inu-

gaakalikurit  have  dwelt  in  splendid  isola-

tion  for  uncounted  generations,  wholly

content with their lot in life.

Arctic  dwarves  are  squat  and  hardy,

with  blocky  bodies,  pinched  faces,  and

stubby legs. They rarely exceed 3 feet in

height and are nearly as broad as they

are  tall.  Their  eyes  are  bright  blue,

their  cheeks  as  ruddy  as  apples.

Their skin is white, almost bluish,

but  because  of  their  fondness  for

basking under the bright sun, many of

them are sunburned red from head to toe, a

condition that causes them no discomfort or other ill

effects. Their fingers and toes are thick and blunt and

their  feet  flat  and  wide.  Curly  white  hair

covers  their  heads  and  tumbles  down  their

backs nearly to their waists. Males sport short

beards and twisting mustaches. Both sexes favor simple tunics of

polar bear fur and generally go barefoot.

Arctic dwarves are open and friendly and can be quite socia-

ble with neighboring races, with the exception of frost giants,

whom they despise. Unlike other dwarves, Inugaakalikurit have

little interest in mining or crafts, instead devoting themselves

to hunting, raising children, and leisure. Traditional dwarven

strictures, such as those imposed by family and clan, hold little

weight  in  arctic  dwarf  society,  and  history  and  the  past

achievements of ones ancestors are seen as little more than a

source  of  enjoyable  tales.  Arctic  dwarves  are  quite  curious

about the outside world, although they have little inclination

to go and see it.

Arctic  dwarves  have  the  life  expectancy  and  age  categories

defined  for  dwarves  in  Tables  64  and  65  of  the  Players

Handbook,  but  use  the  following  random  height  and  weight

characteristics instead of those described on Table 66:

History

Since  the  arctic  dwarves  have  no  historical  record  other  than

their own stories, little is known about the true history of this

enigmatic  subrace.  Scholars  believe  that  the  arctic  dwarves

migrated  into  northern  Faern  around  the  same  time  as  the

Stout Folk who originally founded Bhaerynden, but, if that is

true, they have left no trace of their passing. Some claim that

the Inugaakalikurit once ruled a northern empire that rivaled

great Bhaerynden, but the Great Glacier long ago crushed any

ruins it might have left.

Arctic  dwarves  did  not  always  claim  the  towering  peaks  of

Novularond  as  their  home.  Prior  to  the

coming of the Ulutiuns, they dwelt in small

villages  across  the  Great  Glacier.  Since

adapting  to  their  alpine  homes,  the  arctic

dwarves  have  dwelt  in  quiet  isolation,

untouched by the passage of time.

Outlook

Arctic dwarves are friendly and outgo-

ing, little concerned with class or clan

distinctions.  They  enjoy  life  to  the

fullest  and  see  little  reason  to  accu-

mulate  wealth  or  material  posses-

sions.  They  believe  in  hunting  and

gathering  sufficient  food  to  feed

themselves  but  otherwise  have  little

interest  in  labor  of  any  sort.  They

strive to spend as much time as pos-

sible in leisurely pursuits, storytelling,

sports such as wrestling, and games with

their children.

Arctic  dwarves  are  rarely  drawn  to

adventuring, but those who do usually evince

a  curiosity  about  other  cultures  so  strong  that

they willingly forgo the life of leisure they might

otherwise pursue. Instead of waiting to chance

upon  evidence  of  other  cultures  in  their

remote glacial homes, they head out to explore

the world, seeking out the exotic and the new. As such, they

stumble into adventures by happenstance, happily exploring any

new environment they come across.

ARCTIC DWARF CHARACTERS

Arctic  dwarves  typically  make  good  rangers  and  barbarians,

since  they  are  well  equipped  to  survive  in  extreme  environ-

ments. Likewise, generations of battling frost giants and other

monsters have given rise to a strong martial tradition. The self-

sufficiency of these classes enables arctic dwarves to feel com-

fortable about their continued survival and hence engenders the

relaxed attitude many feel toward life. Inugaakalikurit have no

arcane spellcasting tradition, and their lack of religious faith

precludes  the  role  of  cleric  or  paladin.  Arctic  dwarves  often

multiclass as ranger/fighters or ranger/barbarians.

DWARVES

Favored Class: An arctic dwarfs favored class is ranger. The

harsh polar environment of the Great Glacier rewards those who

possess  excellent  survival  skills,  and  the  intermittent  feuding

between  the  Inugaakalikurit  and  their  frost  giant  enemies

demands the specialized skills of a giant-killing ranger.

Arctic Dwarf Society

Arctic dwarf culture is remarkably homogeneous, the result of

centuries of isolation from the other races of Faern. Compared

to  other  dwarven  cultures,  Inugaakalikurit  place  almost  no

emphasis on bloodline or clan. While individual accomplishment

does garner respect, rarely are such feats remembered for more

than a generation. The pursuit of leisure is placed above hard

work or skilled artisanship, and few arctic dwarves are driven to

accomplish more than continued survival.

Arctic dwarves receive a great deal of individual attention in

childhood, with all adult members of the community serving as

parental  figures  to  varying  degrees.  Little  is  expected  of  Inu-

gaakalikurit youth, so they spend their days engaged in playful

pursuits. As adults, each arctic dwarf is expected to contribute to

the communitys well-being, but there is little societal reward for

doing more than the minimum required. Elderly arctic dwarves

are considered to have earned the right to live out the rest of

their days engaging in leisurely pursuits and are simply encased

beneath the ice and snow when death finally claims them.

Arctic dwarves have emigrated in such small numbers from

their mountain homes that they have very little experience as

minorities within other cultures. Those who do leave usually

look  for  individuals  of  similar  temperament,  regardless  of

race, and attempt to recreate the easygoing lifestyle of their

native villages.

Language and Literacy

Like all dwarves, arctic dwarves speak a dialect of Dwarven and

employ the Dethek rune alphabet. They also speak the dialect of

Common spoken in Sossal. The Inugaakalikurit dialect of Dwar-

ven is known as Kurit and has strong ties to Uluik, the Ulutiun

tongue spoken by the humans of the Great Glacier and the Ice

Hunters  of  the  North.  Common  secondary  languages  include

Uluik,  Giant,  Damaran,  and  Draconic,  which  enable  arctic

dwarves to communicate with their neighbors.

All arctic dwarf characters are literate except for barbarians,

adepts, aristocrats, experts, warriors, and commoners.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Arctic dwarves have all the dwarven racial traits listed in the

Players Handbook, except as follows:

+4  Strength,  2  Dexterity,  +2  Constitution,  2  Charisma.

Arctic  dwarves  are  incredibly  strong,  but  shorter  and  more

stout than other dwarven subraces.

Small: As Small creatures, arctic dwarves gain a +1 size bonus

to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size

bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smaller weapons than

humans  use,  and  their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are  three-

quarters of those of Medium-size characters.

Immune to cold.

Automatic  Languages:  Dwarven,  Common,  home  region.

Bonus Languages: By region.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Level  Adjustment:  +2.  Arctic  dwarves  are  significantly

stronger on average than most Stout Folk, and they possess an

immunity to cold. They are slightly more powerful and gain

levels  more  slowly  than  the  common  races  of  Faern.  See

Table 1 in the Introduction.

Arctic Dwarf

Magic and Lore

Arctic dwarves take a pragmatic view toward magic: Its useful

if it helps them hunt, but otherwise spells and spellcastersespe-

cially arcane onesare a matter for tales told to youngsters.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Arctic  dwarves  do  not  have  an  arcane  spellcasting  tradition.

Since they do they not worship the dwarven deities, they lack a

strong divine spellcasting tradition as well.

Most arctic dwarf spellcasters are druids, adepts, and rangers.

The druids in particular have an affinity to fire magic, because

many of their most common foes (such as frost giants and frost

worms) fear and hate flames.

ARCTIC DWARF MAGIC ITEMS

Arctic dwarves rarely employ magic items, as they do not have

a cultural tradition of clerics or arcane spellcasters to craft such

items.  Those  few  items  that  do  exist  are  usually  fashioned  by

druids  or  the  rare  arctic  dwarf  arcane  spellcaster  and  include

such items as amulets of natural armor and snowshoes of speed

(identical to boots of speed).

In caves carved into the Great Glacier, arctic dwarves nurture

coin-sized ice crystals of exceeding sharpness. Called kerrenderit

in the Kurit tongue, these crystals can be magically enhanced to

form  deadly  arrowheads  (see  the  Magic  Items  section  of  the

Appendix). The kerrenderit crystals take a long time to form in

their icy caves, so only the greatest hunters among the arctic

dwarves carry kerrenderit arrows in their quivers.

Arctic Dwarf Deities

Among the various dwarven subraces, the Inugaakalikurit are

unique  in  that  they  do  not  venerate  the  Morndinsamman  or,

indeed, worship any gods. A few exceptions exist, including a few

arctic dwarves who have turned to the worship of the human

god Ulutiu. Instead, the arctic dwarves follow a druidic tradition,

venerating Talos and Ulutiu.

Relations with Other Races

Isolated as they are by their environment, arctic dwarves have

little experience with members of other races aside from Ulutiun

humans and frost giants. They get along well with the former

and hate the latter. Since most arctic dwarves are amiable and

peace-loving,  they  treat  representatives  of  most  other  races

favorably unless shown reason not to. The Inugaakalikurit find

10

DWARVES

other dwarves and gnomes somewhat amusing, a combination of

their  familiar  appearance  and  odd  (to  an  arctic  dwarf)  ways.

Likewise, humans other than Ulutiuns are seen as odd since their

cultures differ greatly from that known to arctic dwarves. The

Inugaakalikurit  regard  elves  and  half-elves  with  a  measure  of

awe, having only ever seen winged elves soaring high above their

mountain  homes.  Halflings,  half-orcs,  and  planetouched  are

exotic creatures to a typical arctic dwarf.

Arctic Dwarf Equipment

Arctic dwarves commonly employ only a handful of weapons,

including  battleaxes,  halfspears,  shortbows,  and  shortspears.

Most arctic dwarves wear hide armor, with pelts of polar bears

being most highly prized. The harsh arctic environment of the

Great Glacier requires the use of dogsleds (as sleds in the Players

Handbook), snow goggles, and snowshoes.

Arctic dwarves favor riding dogs with heavy winter coats as

pets and pack animals. When they hunt behind dogsleds, they

often chase down and exhaust their prey, then finish the hunt

with arctic harpoons (see the Equipment section of the Appen-

dix). While the arctic harpoon can be difficult for arctic dwarves

to wield, they favor it anyway, motivated by a mythic tradition

of  arctic  dwarf  harpooners  who  felled  impossibly  large  polar

bears and other prey.

Arctic Dwarf Region

Most  arctic  dwarves  live  on  the  Great  Glacier.  This  region  is

appropriate for an Inugaakalikurit raised in the races homeland

in the icebound mountains of the glacier.

Preferred Classes: Barbarian, fighter, ranger, druid. A charac-

ter of one of these classes may choose a regional feat and gain

his choice of the bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character.

An arctic dwarf character of any other class may not select one

of the regional feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment

at 1st level.

Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven, Uluik.

Bonus  Languages:  Aquan,  Auran,  Common,  Damaran,  Dra-

conic, Giant.

Regional Feats: Oral History, Survivor, Swarmfighting.

Bonus Equipment: (A) light pick* or halfspear*; or (B) riding

dog and hide armor*.

Dwarf, Gold

Regions:  Dragon  Coast,  Dwarf  (gold),  Unther,  Western  Heart-

lands. Gold dwarves native to the Great Rift should select the

gold dwarf region.

Racial Feats: Hammer Fist, Metallurgy, Skyrider, Stoneshaper.

Racial Prestige Class: Battlerager.

Found  largely  in  the  South  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the

Great Rift, gold dwarves are the dominant southern branch of

the  Stout  Folk.  Renowned  not  only  for  their  smithwork  and

craftsmanship but also for their military prowess and legendary

wealth, gold dwarves have maintained their empire for millen-

nia, unbowed by the passage of time.

For generations, the Deep Kingdom of the gold dwarves has

stood unconquered, dominating the surface lands and subterranean

11

caverns that surround the Great Rift. As their numbers never

declined  in  the  face  of  endless  warfare  like  their  northern

cousins, the Thunder Blessing has actually filled the great cav-

erns of the Deep Kingdom beyond their capacity. As a result, for

the first time in many years, large numbers of gold dwarves are

setting out to establish new strongholds across the South and the

rest of Faern, including the Smoking Mountains of Unther and

the Giants Run Mountains of the Shining Plains.

Averaging  4  feet  tall  and  weighing  as  much  as  an  adult

human,  gold  dwarves  are  stocky  and  muscular.  The  skin  of  a

gold dwarf is light brown or deeply tanned, and her eyes are usu-

ally  brown  or  hazel.  Both  genders  wear  their  hair  long,  and

males (and some females) have long, carefully groomed beards

and mustaches. Hair color ranges from black to gray or brown,

with all shades fading to light gray as time progresses.

Like their northern kin, gold dwarves harbor a great deal of

pride,  both  in  their  own  accomplishments  and  those  of  their

ancestors. They also share the philosophy that anything worth

doing is worth doing well, and that the natural world is but raw

material to be worked into objects of great beauty. Unlike the

long-beleaguered shield dwarves, gold dwarves have not faced a

serious challenge to their way of life for thousands of years. Con-

fident and secure in their isolated realm, gold dwarves do not

share  the  pessimism  or  fatalism  of  their  shield  dwarven

brethren. To the contrary, having seen the rise and fall of count-

less elven, human, and shield dwarven empires, their endurance

has fostered a deep-seated belief that their traditions and culture

are superior to those of all other races.

Gold dwarves have the life expectancy, age categories, height,

and weight defined for dwarves in Tables 64, 65, and 66 in

the Players Handbook.

History

Founded  more  than  sixteen  thousand  years  ago,  the  original

dwarven homeland of Bhaerynden occupied a vast cavern deep

beneath  the  southern  plains  ruled  by  the  elves  of  Ilythiir.

Bhaerynden  claimed  great  swaths  of  the  Underdark,  but

remained largely unknown in the Realms Above. Little is known

about the history of Bhaerynden except that a great exodus of

dwarves led by Taark Shanat the Crusader left to found a new

kingdom in the west about 11,000 DR. The end of the elven

Crown  Wars  and  the  Descent  of  the  Drow  in  the  years  after

10,000 DR directly precipitated the fall of Bhaerynden. The

first drow civilizations arose in the southern Underdark around

9600 DR, but the drow quickly directed their anger against the

Stout Folk. Within the space of six centuries, the Stout Folk had

been scattered and the drow empire of Telantiwar ruled supreme

in the dwarf-carved halls of fallen Bhaerynden.

The collapse of the cavern of Bhaerynden destroyed Telanti-

war  and  created  the  Great  Rift,  scattering  the  drow  around

7600 DR. Gold dwarves believe Moradin destroyed Telantiwar

with a blow of his axe, but scholars of other races have suggested

that the drow weakened the cavern roof through excessive tun-

neling and reliance on magic to support the ceilings weight. In

the aftermath of Telantiwars fall, there was a great scramble to

claim new territory in the Underdark. The Stout Folk quickly

returned  to  their  ancestral  home  and  established  the  Deep

Realm, occupying lesser caverns and miles of tunnels spreading

out under the Eastern Shaar. Drow refugees claimed lesser cav-

erns to the north, south, and west of the Great Rift, establish-

ing cities in nearby lands.

DWARVES

In the millennia that followed, the Stout Folk of the Deep

Realm became known as gold dwarves. Once the borders of their

realm were firmly established and defended, they set about build-

ing great subterranean cities and harvesting the bounty of the

earth. While external threats from the drow and other Under-

dark races such as aboleths, cloakers, illithids, ixzans, and kuo-toa

never entirely abated, no other race could match the unity of

purpose  evinced  by  the  gold  dwarves,  and  the  sanctity  of  the

Deep Realm was never challenged. The dwarves profited in trade

with  each  successive  human  empire  that  reached  their  Great

Rift, including ancient Jhaamdath, the folk of Mulhorand and

Unther in their heyday, the Shoon Imperium at its height, and

in more recent centuries the mercantile Chondathan nations of

the Inner Sea.

In 1306 DR, the Thunder Blessing shook the gold dwarves out

of their millennia-long quiescence. In the decades that followed,

a burgeoning population forced the gold dwarves to seek out new

caverns to claim and settle across the South, upsetting the long-

held status quo of the southern Underdark. The largest exodus

to  date  from  the  Deep  Realm  began  in  1369  DR,  when  the

Army of Gold set out on a great crusade to reclaim the caverns

of Taark Shanat and restore the glory of Shanatar, the ancient

kingdom  of  the  shield  dwarves.  That  expedition  has  become

bogged down in warfare with the Army of Steel, dispatched by

the gray dwarves of Underspires. Fierce battles rage in the tun-

nels beneath the Lake of Steam and the Cloven Mountains.

Outlook

Gold dwarves measure others by how much honor and wealth

each individual garners as well as the status of his or her blood-

line and clan. To gold dwarves, life is best lived through adher-

ence  to  the  ancient  traditions  of  the  Deep  Realm.  The  very

persistence of their own way of life indicates that other short-

lived cultures are inherently flawed. As such, those who lack a

meaningful cultural tradition or reject their elders dictates are

untrustworthy and possibly dangerous.

From birth, gold dwarves are taught to conform to the tra-

ditional  strictures  of  their  society.  Every  important  decision,

from choice of profession to their mate, is dictated by the cir-

cumstances of their birth. Those who do not act honorably in

their dealings are shunned from an early age, breeding a tremen-

dous societal pressure to fit in.

Gold dwarves lack the longstanding tradition of adventuring

found in their shield dwarf cousins in the north. However, pop-

ulation pressures induced by the Thunder Blessing have given

birth to a new generation of gold dwarf adventurers. Most gold

dwarves who wander beyond the familiar confines of the Deep

Realm do so in order to found new strongholds of their own, but

many find the lure of adventuring hard to ignore once it has

entered into their blood.

GOLD DWARF CHARACTERS

Gold  dwarves  are  painfully  aware  that  many  once-proud

empires have been brought low, and they are therefore vigilant

about maintaining their own. The keen awareness gold dwarves

hold  of  the  dangers  to  their  eternal  rule  ensure  that  all  gold

dwarves are trained to fight from a young age. Most are trained

as fighters, although clerics, paladins, rangers, rogues, and even

the  occasional  arcane  spellcaster  play  important  roles  in

defending the Deep Realm. Gold dwarf sorcerers usually trace

their ancestry back to a powerful dragon or some creature of ele-

mental earth or fire. Common multiclass combinations include

fighter/cleric, fighter/paladin, and fighter/expert.

Favored Class: A gold dwarfs favored class is fighter. Only a

strong and fierce military tradition has kept the Deep Realm

secure from its enemies above and below, a result of generations

of gold dwarves training as fighters.

Prestige Classes: Battleragers are legendary dwarven warriors

who can enter a battle frenzy through ritual singing. Given to

drinking,  rowdy  and  boisterous  singing,  and  drunken  dancing,

battleragers love to plunge into close-quarters battle, heedless of

any danger. Most battleragers are shield dwarves, but a small

number of gold dwarves rebelling against the discipline and tra-

dition of their society have joined the ranks of the berserkers.

More  disciplined  gold  dwarves  lean  toward  the  dwarven

defender or divine champion classes.

Gold Dwarf Society

Gold dwarf culture does not exhibit a great deal of variability,

the result of generations of gold dwarves insulated from outside

influences.  Class  and  clan  divisions  are  strong  among  gold

dwarves, and great importance is attributed to bloodlines when

ascribing social status. However, the Deep Realm is so swamped

with petty, decadent royals and nobles that little real power is

invested  in  anyone  but  the  governing  council  of  clan  elders.

Commerce and craftsmanship both play an important role in

gold dwarf society, as does the never-satiated grasping for more

riches. Pride and honor play an important role in all aspects of

daily life, for disgrace applies not only to oneself, but also to kin,

clan, and long-dead ancestors.

Gold  dwarves  are  raised  in  tight  family  units,  but  the  clan

elders  play  an  important  oversight  role  in  the  upbringing  of

every child. Book learning is common, as is an apprenticeship to

learn a trade. All adults are expected to support themselves and

their family as well as bring honor and riches to the clan. Osten-

tatious displays of wealth are important for maintaining ones

prestige, so poorer gold dwarves often scrimp and save to keep

up appearances. As gold dwarves age, they are accorded increas-

ing respect for their wisdom. Clan elders form a ruling geron-

tocracy that strongly enforces traditional practices. Families and

clans are expected to honor their elders in death with elaborate

funereal rites and tombs befitting the deceaseds reputation.

Outside the Deep Realm, gold dwarves hold themselves apart,

forming small, insular enclaves that attempt to replicate tradi-

tional clan life. Few gold dwarves have any interest in adopting

local  practices  except  where  it  furthers  their  ability  to  hawk

their wares.

Language and Literacy

Like all dwarves, gold dwarves speak a dialect of Dwarven and

employ the Dethek rune alphabet. They also speak Common, the

trade language of the Realms Above. The primary gold dwarven

dialect (sometimes referred to as Riftspeak) has changed little

since the glory days of Bhaerynden. Gold dwarves dwelling in the

colonies  in  Unther  and  the  Giants  Run  often  learn  the  lan-

guages of the nearby lands.

Common  secondary  languages  reflect  the  extensive  trading

contacts maintained by gold dwarves with their neighbors in the

12

DWARVES

South  and  include  Shaaran,  Untheric,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,

Durpari,  Dambrathan,  Mulhorandi,  Halfling,  and  Halruaan.

Gold  dwarves  who  have  extensive  contact  with  other  subter-

ranean races often learn Terran, Gnome, or Undercommon.

All gold dwarf characters are literate except barbarians (who

are very unusual among the folk of this ancient civilization).

Gold Dwarf Magic and Lore

Gold dwarves have a strong divine spellcasting tradition, with

many of the Stout Folk called to serve the Morndinsamman as

clerics, paladins, runecasters, or runesmiths. Arcane spellcasters

are much rarer, but they do exist.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Gold dwarves favor spells that aid their abilities in combat

or  assist  in  craftwork  or  mining.  Most  are  divine  spell-

casters, but the gold dwarves millennia-old civilization has

ensured  both  ancient  libraries  of  wizardry  and  strange,

sorcerous bloodlines.

Spellcasting  Tradition:  Many  gold  dwarves  take  the  Gold

Dwarf Dweomersmith feat (see the appendix), which grants them

advantages when creating or enhancing weapons with magic.

Unique  Spells:  Gold  dwarves  have  created  many  spells  over

the years, many of which are now employed by the Stout Folk

across Faern. One such example is detect metals and minerals

(see the appendix).

GOLD DWARF MAGIC ITEMS

Gold dwarves favor magic items that aid in combat, facilitate

craftwork,  provide  personal  protection  or  comfort,  guard

against theft, or are adorned with fine metals and gems. Blades

and axes are commonly crafted with keen, holy, lawful, mighty

cleaving,  sundering,  and  stunning  special  abilities.  Hammers

and  maces  are  commonly  crafted  with  holy,  impact,  lawful,

returning, stunning, sundering, and throwing special abilities.

Armor is typically crafted with fortification, invulnerability,

reflection,  and  spell  resistance  special  abilities,  reflecting  a

long tradition of battles against the drow and other creatures

of the Underdark.

Common Magic Items: Magic items particularly prevalent in

the Great Rift and the trade cities at its edge include anvil of the

blacksmith, belt of dwarvenkind, forge of smithing, hammer of

the weaponsmith, and tongs of the armorer. These items can be

purchased at a 10% discount in the Great Rift.

Iconic  Magic  Items:  Gold  dwarves  have  fabricated  many

unique magic items, but they are best known for the stonereaver

greataxes (see the appendix).

Gold Dwarf Deities

Gold  dwarves  have  venerated  the  dwarven  deities  of  the

Morndinsamman  since  the  founding  of  Bhaerynden,  but  cen-

turies of relative isolation and security have made their culture

far less religious in nature than their shield dwarven kin. Among

gold  dwarves  the  churches  of  Moradin  and  Berronar  are  so

A gold dwarf confronts a duergar and his steeder

13

DWARVES

predominant and have been for so long that many lesser dwar-

ven deities enjoy little more than token obeisance. High-ranking

clerics of both faiths command a great amount of institutional

authority in gold dwarf society. The clerics of Berronars faith

are  responsible  for  preserving  records  of  the  extraordinarily

ancient  genealogy  of  the  noble  families  and  serve  as  the

guardians of tradition in the home and community.

All gold dwarves revere the Soul Forger as the founder of the

dwarven race, and his church is the predominant faith of the

Deep  Realm,  centered  in  the  monastic  city  of  Thuulurn.

Moradins clerics sponsor many craftsfolk, particularly armor-

ers and weaponsmiths, and serve as the principal judges and mag-

istrates  of  gold  dwarf  society.  The  Soul  Forgers  faithful  are

drawn primarily from those who labor as smiths, craftsfolk, or

engineers, but he is also seen as the protector of the entire dwar-

ven  race  and  is  thus  worshiped  by  many  lawful  good  dwarves

regardless of profession.

Relations with Other Races

Confident and secure in their remote home, gold dwarves have

a  well-deserved  reputation  for  haughtiness  and  pride.  They

look down on all other dwarves, even shield dwarves and gray

dwarves whose achievements and kingdoms have matched the

glory of their own. Gold dwarves regard elves and half-elves

with  suspicion  after  generations  spent  battling  their  deep-

dwelling cousins. Gnomes, particularly deep gnomes, are well

regarded and welcomed as trading partners. Their impression

of  halflings  is  shaped  by  the  strongheart  inhabitants  of

Luiren, whom gold dwarves find to be suitably industrious and

forthright.

Gold dwarves know little of half-orcs, but usually lump them

in  with  the  rest  of  orc  and  goblinoid  scum.  Gold  dwarves  are

very cautious in their dealings with humans, having found great

variability in their dealings with Chondathans, the folk of Dam-

brath, Durpari, Mulan, Shaarans, and Halruaans. Planetouched

are almost unknown but are usually viewed in the same light as

the Mulan, since most planetouched the gold dwarves encounter

are either Mulan aasimar or earth genasi followers of Geb.

Gold Dwarf Equipment

The gold dwarf craft guilds have had centuries to master their

artisanship, so almost any finished good has some filigree, runic

mark,  or  other  decoration  that  marks  it  as  unmistakably  the

work of the gold dwarves. Even a simple bucket will have care-

fully marked gradations along the inside, graven runes identi-

fying  its  owner,  and  a  curved  handle  shaped  to  fit  a  thick

dwarven hand.

Common Items: Sunrods, thunderstones.

Unique  Items:  Gold  dwarves  commonly  employ  well-

engineered equipment such as mobile braces and rope climbers.

The  hippogriff-mounted  skyriders  of  the  Great  Rift  are

known to employ drogue wings (see the appendix) and exotic

military saddles.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Gold dwarves favor a wide range of weapons, including battle-

axes, crossbows, gauntlets, handaxes, heavy picks, light ham-

mers,  light  picks,  mauls,  throwing  axes,  and  warhammers.

More unusual weapons include dwarven urgroshes and dwar-

ven  waraxes.  Typical  forms  of  armor  include  breastplates,

half-plate, full plate, scale mail, large steel shields, and small

steel shields.

Common Items: Battleaxe, light crossbow, heavy pick, dwar-

ven urgrosh, scale mail, full plate armor. The gold dwarves man-

ufacture adamantine heavy picks and battleaxes for those who

can afford such things; adamantine weapons are available at a

10% discount in the Great Rift.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Gold dwarves favor small lizards such as the spitting crawler and

shocker  lizard  for  pets  and  familiars.  Deep  roth  are  the  pre-

ferred type of livestock. They employ pack lizards and mules as

beasts of burden, usually breeding the latter from Lhesperan or

Meth horses crossed with donkeys. Gold dwarves commonly use

riding lizards as steeds in subterranean locales, and war ponies

for travel in the surface lands. The gold dwarf skyriders of the

Great Rift employ hippogriffs as aerial mounts.

Dwarf, Gray

Regions:  Dwarf  (gray),  The  North,  Turmish,  Vaasa,  Vilhon

Reach. Most duergar characters have little contact with other

cultures and choose the gray dwarf region.

Racial Feats: Arachnid Rider, Hammer Fist, Iron Mind, Stone-

shaper.

Level Adjustment: +2. Refer to the FORGOTTEN REALMS Cam-

paign Setting entry for gray dwarf racial abilities.

Dwelling in great subterranean cities of the Underdark, the gray

dwarves are deep-dwelling cousins of shield dwarves, known for

their cruelty and bitterness. Like their surface-dwelling kin, gray

dwarves are famed for their smithwork and craftsmanship, but

unlike their brethren in the Realms Above, the duergar are grim

and  cheerless,  living  lives  of  endless  toil.  Like  their  gold  and

shield dwarf kin, the duergar have forged great empires, found-

ing  such  realms  as  the  Deepkingdom  of  Gracklstugh  and  the

Steel  Kingdom  of  Dunspeirrin  in  the  endless  darkness  of  the

Realms Below.

Averaging 4 feet tall, gray dwarves weigh nearly as much as

an adult human. While other dwarves tend to be round-bodied

and stoutly muscled, duergar are wide of shoulder but wiry and

lean, their limbs corded with tough muscle. The skin of a gray

dwarf is light or dark gray, and his eyes are dull black. Both

genders are usually bald, with males having long gray beards

and mustaches.

Gray dwarves are consumed with bitterness, feeling their race

has forever been denied what was rightfully theirs. The duergar

expect  and  live  lives  of  never-ending  drudgery.  While  their

work rivals that of shield and gold dwarves, they are relentless

perfectionists  who  take  no  pleasure  in  their  craftsmanship.

Only cruel jokes and petty torments bring a moments smile to

most  gray  dwarves,  and  they  delight  in  tormenting  the  weak

and the helpless.

Gray  dwarves  have  the  life  expectancy  and  age  categories

defined  for  dwarves  in  Tables  64  and  65  of  the  Players

Handbook,  but  use  the  following  random  height  and  weight

characteristics instead of those described on Table 66:

History

Gray dwarves trace their history back to the establishment of

Barakuir, one of the eight kingdoms of Shanatar. The Iron King-

dom was dominated by the shield dwarves of Clan Duergar, who

venerated Laduguer as their kingdoms patron. Although they

swore allegiance to the Wyrmskull Throne, the rulers of Clan

Duergar  thought  their  king  should  have  been  selected  to  rule

Shanatar at the conclusion of the Second Spider War. Consumed

with  bitterness,  the  dwarves  of  Barakuir  largely  turned  away

from the rest of the empire. The foolishness of this action was

quickly proved when war broke out with the illithids of Oryn-

doll,  a  city  that  lies  deep  beneath  the  Shining  Plains,  around

8100 DR. Although Shanatar battled the illithids to a stale-

mate, the enemys armies managed to cut off Barakuir from out-

side  reinforcement.  By  the  time  the  Mindstalker  Wars  had

ended, Barakuir had fallen to the illithids, and most of its inhab-

itants had been enslaved as thralls.

After millennia of enslavement and countless illithid breed-

ing experiments, the descendants of Clan Duergar were trans-

formed into a new dwarven subrace: the gray dwarves. Roughly

four thousand years before the start of Dalereckoning, the duer-

gar rebelled against their illithid masters and eventually freed

themselves of the mind flayers dominion. These newly liberated

gray  dwarves  carved  out  their  own  holdings  in  the  northern

Underdark beneath the Orsraun Mountains and in isolated cav-

erns deep beneath the Great Glacier.

In  the  North,  gray  dwarves  founded  Gracklstugh,  City  of

Blades,  in  3717  DR.  As  the  first  city  of  their  kind  in  the

North, its holdings grew without rival throughout the upper and

middle Underdark. The Deepkingdom reached its peak around

2600  DR,  but  in  1803  DR,  the  kingdom  fell  into  a  slow

decline  after  smashing  the  quaggoth  nation  of  Ursadunthar

which lay deep beneath the Spine of the World. For centuries

thereafter, the overextended duergar battled barbaric quaggoths

(who were incited by the drow), as the Deepbear Battles raged

until 1350 DR.

In the heart of Faern, gray dwarves founded Dunspeirrin,

City of Sunken Spires, beneath the Orsraun Mountains. In time,

the holdings of Underspires, as the city was also known, grew to

encompass  the  Underdark  of  Turmish  and  the  Dragon  Coast,

and the gray dwarves grew strong. In 1850 DR, under the lead-

ership  of  their  greatest  queen,  Duerra,  the  gray  dwarves

launched a series of attacks against the drow of Undraeth, the

illithids of Oryndoll (from whom Duerra is said to have wrested

the  secrets  of  the  Invisible  Art),  and  other  Underdark  races.

Duerras armies turned their simmering hatred against the rem-

nants of Deep Shanatar sometime around 1800 DR. The gray

dwarves overran Ultoksamrin and Holorarar and conquered the

caverns of Alatorin for themselves. Laduguer rewarded Duerra

with  divine  ascension.  Afterward,  Dunspeirrin  fell  into  a  cen-

turies-long  decline,  from  which  it  has  only  recently  begun  to

emerge. The return of Deep Duerra during the Time of Trou-

bles  has  sparked  a  new  age  of  empire-building,  but  the  citys

Army of Steel now finds itself locked in a three-year-old conflict

with the gold dwarf Army of Gold over control of the caverns

of ancient Shanatar.

Outlook

Gray dwarves view the world with bitterness, convinced family,

clan, other dwarves, and the rest of the world have cheated them

of their birthright and their due. They see life as nothing more

than endless backbreaking labor, a torment from birth through

death. The duergar evince little mercy for the helpless or the

weak and enjoy tormenting those they can prey upon. From a

young age, gray dwarves are quickly schooled in the harshness of

the  world,  taught  that  their  lot  in  life  is  nothing  more  than

never-ending labor accompanied by betrayal and then death.

Gray dwarves rarely adventure out of choice. Those who are

exiled or flee imminent banishment often gravitate to the life

of an adventure simply in hopes of surviving. Adventuresome

duergar  are  usually  focused  on  the  acquisition  of  material

wealth, caring little for the plight of others.

GRAY DWARF CHARACTERS

The  ever-present  dangers  of  the  all-enveloping  darkness  are

taught to gray dwarves from a young age. Most receive some

training  as  fighters  or  rogues  to  better  defend  their  homes

against those who would steal their hard-earned wealth. Cler-

ics are common as well, for those who serve the duergar gods

claim positions of relative influence within their clan. Experts

who  combine  traditional  smithcraft  with  skill  in  the  arcane

arts are also much respected. Wizards are much more common

than  sorcerers  among  the  gray  dwarves.  Common  multiclass

combinations  include  fighter/cleric,  fighter/expert,  and

fighter/rogue.

Favored  Class:  A  gray  dwarfs  favored  class  is  fighter.  (If

your DM uses the Psionics Handbook in your game, this could

be changed to psychic warrior at the DMs option.) The Under-

dark is a harsh and unforgiving environment, where only the

strongest  can  survive.  Gray  dwarf  fighters  have  formed  the

bedrock of duergar armies for generations, enabling them to

hold off such varied threats as aboleth, drow, illithids, kuo-toa,

and svirfneblin.

Prestige  Classes:  Gray  dwarves  gravitate  toward  prestige

classes such as assassin and blackguard. A few become dwarven

defenders.  As  with  their  cousins,  the  shield  dwarves,  the  gray

dwarves have a tradition of rune magic, and so a number of

clerics become runecasters.

Language and Literacy

Like all dwarves, gray dwarves speak Dwarven and employ the

Dethek rune alphabet. Gray dwarves also speak Undercommon,

the trade tongue of the Realms Below. The primary gray dwar-

ven  dialect,  Duergan,  is  an  offshoot  of  the  shield  dwarven

dialect, heavily influenced by drow and illithid words and lan-

guage constructs found in Undercommon.

Common secondary languages reflect those spoken by tradi-

tional foes, including Draconic, Elven (the drow dialect), Giant,

Goblin, and Orc. Those who have extensive dealings with crea-

tures  of  elemental  earth  often  learn  Terran,  while  those  who

trade  with  inhabitants  of  the  Realms  Above  often  learn  the

trade tongue Common.

All gray dwarf characters are literate except for barbarians.

DWARVES

Gray Dwarf

Magc and Lore

Gray dwarves have a strong divine spellcasting tradition, with

many  of  the  Stout  Folk  called  to  serve  Laduguer  or  Deep

Duerra as clerics, runecasters, or runesmiths. Arcane spellcast-

ers are much rarer, but wizards skilled in the crafting of magic

items are much respected.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Gray dwarves favor spells that aid their abilities in combat, assist

in craftwork or mining, or facilitate stealthy movement.

Spellcasting Tradition: Some gray dwarves take the Duergar

Mindshaper feat (see the appendix), part of the lore they stole

from the mind flayers.

GRAY DWARF MAGIC ITEMS

Gray dwarves favor magic items that aid in combat, facilitate

craftwork, shield the mind, or enable stealthy movement. Blades

and axes are commonly crafted with bane, keen, lawful, mighty

cleaving, sundering, stunning, unholy, and wounding special abil-

ities.  Hammers  and  maces  are  commonly  crafted  with  bane,

impact,  lawful,  returning,  stunning,  sundering,  throwing,  and

unholy special abilities. Armor is typically crafted with ethere-

alness,  shadow,  slick,  silent  moves,  and  spell  resistance  special

abilities that facilitate stealthy movement.

Common  Magic  Items: Cloaks  of  arachnida,  dust  of  trace-

lessness,  rings  of  mind  shielding, and  whetstones  of  keen  edge.

Duergar are notoriously suspicious of outsiders, but duergar mer-

chants trade throughout the Underdark. These items are com-

monly available at a 10% discount in any duergar settlement of

at least large town size.

Iconic  Magic  Items:  Gray  dwarves  have  fabricated  many

unique magic items, such as absorbing shields, bolts of battering,

and stonereaver axes (see the appendix).

Duergar Deities

Laduguer,  the  Gray  Protector,  is  the  harsh  taskmaster  of  the

duergar and the patron of their subrace. Although the duergar

nominally  venerate  all  the  dwarven  deities  of  the  Morndin-

samman, in truth they venerate only Laduguer and his daugh-

ter, Deep Duerra. Before the rise of Shanatar, each of the shield

dwarven subkingdoms had its own patron deity. The kingdom of

Barakuir, dominated by the dwarves of Clan Duergar, honored

Laduguer and never accepted the ascension of Dumathoin as the

patron  deity  of  shield  dwarves.  The  ancestors  of  the  gray

dwarves  continued  to  honor  Laduguer  during  their  long

enslavement  by  the  illithids  of  Oryndoll.  Unlike  their  shield

dwarven  brethren,  the  duergar  did  not  evolve  their  religious

practice toward the veneration of the pantheon as a whole.

Deep Duerra, the Daughter of Laduguer, is said to have been

a great warrior queen who stole many secrets of the Invisible

Art (psionics) from Ilsensine, god of mind flayers. Deep Duerra

is venerated primarily by duergar who study the Invisible Art

and  by  those  militant  gray  dwarves  who  would  rather  crush

their subterranean neighbors than trade with them. Her faith is

particularly strong beneath the Osraun Mountains of Turmish,

where her followers rule Dunspeirrin, the City of Sunken Spires.

Relations with Other Races

Dour and suspicious of outsiders, gray dwarves have uniformly

bad relations with all other races, including other dwarven sub-

races. The duergar regard their shield dwarf cousins with par-

ticular bitterness, dating back to the shield dwarves failure to

succor  Clan  Duergar  during  the  Mindstalker  Wars.  The  Kin

Clashes forever cemented the mutual animosity between the two

dwarven subraces, a hatred that continues today. Gray dwarves

regard their gold dwarf cousins as arrogant rivals and potential

threats, but trade is possible between the two groups.

Gray dwarves view the surface-dwelling raceselves and half-

elves, gnomes, halflings, half-orcs, and planetouchedwith sus-

picion but willingly trade with those who are foolhardy enough

to venture into the depths. The duergar harbor a longstanding

hatred of their subterranean rivals, the drow and the svirfneblin.

Nevertheless,  they  regularly  trade  with  both  groups,  pitting

them against one another whenever possible.

Gray Dwarf Equipment

Duergar carve and emboss scenes of bloodshed into many items

they  craft.  Though  they  have  a  fierce  appreciation  for  fine

craftsmanship, they are pragmatic enough to shun ostentatious

decoration (such as glittering gems) when it prevents them from

creeping unseen through the Underdark. Duergar traders may be

richly appointed or seem poorly equipped, depending on the sort

of bargaining advantage they seek.

Common Items: Exotic military saddles, thunderstones, and

any poison.

Unique Items: Gray dwarves have perfected armor lubricant

to  assist  armored  warriors  in  stealthy  maneuvering  (see  the

appendix).

ARMS AND ARMOR

Even  more  so  than  other  dwarves,  duergar  favor  weapons

clearly derived from the craftsmans tools. They favor hammers

and picks of all sorts.

Common Items: Heavy pick, light crossbow, light pick, maul,

warhammer, breastplate, chainmail.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Gray  dwarves  favor  common  bats,  hairy  spiders,  osquips,  and

spitting crawlers as pets and familiars. Deep roth are the pre-

ferred type of livestock. They employ pack lizards as beasts of

burden. Although gray dwarves are known for their use of steed-

ers  (see  the  appendix)  as  mounts,  some  clans  employ  riding

lizards as well.

DWARVES

Dwarf, Shield

Regions: Damara, Dwarf (shield), Impiltur, the North, Silvery-

moon, Vaasa, the Vast, and Western Heartlands.

Racial  Feats:  Azerblood,  Batrider,  Hammer  Fist,  Oral  History,

Stoneshaper.

Racial Prestige Class: Battlerager.

Found largely in the northern reaches of western and central

Faern, shield dwarves are the dominant northern branch of the

Stout Folk. Renowned for their smithwork and craftsmanship,

shield dwarves have endured a centuries-long decline in the face

of never-ending wars with orcs, goblins, giants, and trolls.

Shield dwarves are descended from the founders of Shanatar,

a legendary dwarven empire that once ruled the caverns beneath

modern-day Amn, Tethyr, and Calimshan. After Shanatar fell,

the shield dwarves migrated north, founding kingdoms such as

Ammarindar, Delzoun, Gharraghaur, Haunghdannar, Oghrann,

and Sarbreen. Although those kingdoms have also largely fallen,

the Stout Folk of the North endure. The Thunder Blessing has

served  as  a  welcome  reprieve  for  the  beleaguered  shield

dwarves, giving hope that the descendants of ancient Shanatar

may one day reclaim the glory of their forebears.

Taller  by  half  a  foot  than  their  gold  dwarf  cousins,  shield

dwarves average 4 1/2 feet tall and weigh as much as an adult

human. The skin of a shield dwarf is fair or lightly tanned, and

her eyes are usually green or silvered blue. Both genders wear

their hair long, and males (and a very few females) have long,

carefully groomed beards and mustaches. Hair color ranges from

light brown to red, with all shades fading to silver or white as

time progresses.

Shield  dwarves  keep  to  their  word,  whatever  the  cost,  and

are  incredibly  stubborn,  unwilling  to  concede  an  inch  unless

there is absolutely no alternative. Such intransigence has enabled

dwindling shield dwarf populations to hold on to ancient strong-

holds with just a fraction of their original defenders. However,

it has also led to clan feuds and long-standing misunderstand-

ings with other races that have sapped the strength of the Stout

Folk. Shield dwarves love worked beauty, seeing the world as

raw material to be forged and shaped into something more than

the original.

Shield  dwarves  have  the  life  expectancy  and  age  categories

defined  for  dwarves  in  Tables  64  and  65  of  the  Players

Handbook,  but  use  the  following  random  height  and  weight

characteristics instead of those described on Table 66:

History

Shield dwarves trace their history back to Taark Shanat, third

son  of  the  great  ruling  clan  of  Bhaerynden.  In  the  legendary

times more than twelve thousand years ago, the Great Crusader

and  his  eight  sons  led  a  great  westward  migration  of  dwarves

from  Bhaerynden  in  hopes  of  founding  a  new  homeland.  The

Cloaker Wars pitted the dwarves who followed Shanat against

the  mysterious  inhabitants  of  Rringlor  Noroth,  who  rose

from the depths of a great chasm in a battle for control of the

caverns of Alatorin. The Stout Folk eventually prevailed, after

Taark slew four blue dragons who claimed the Rift of Dhalnadar

as their demesne. By the hand of one of the dwarven gods, prob-

ably  Dumathoin,  the  skulls  of  the  four  wyrms  came  together

with a throne that emerged from the cavern floor to form the

Wyrmskull Throne. Taark renamed the wyrms lair Brightaxe

Hall and founded of the kingdom of Alatorin. Shield dwarves

mark  the  founding  of  Alatorin  as  the  beginning  of  the  First

Great Age of Shanatar.

Once Alatorin was established, the eight sons of Taark Shanat

set off to found their own kingdoms in the caverns to the north

(beneath modern-day Tethyr and Amn). Each son claimed one

of the children of Moradin as his patron deity and so each of the

subkingdoms  they  established  became  tightly  linked  with  the

church  of  that  particular  god  or  goddess.  Around  9000  DR,

skirmishing broke out between the eight northern kingdoms, as

each fought to extend its borders at the expense of its neighbors.

Over  time,  the  skirmishes  evolved  into  open  warfare,  pitting

thousands of dwarves against one another.

While these wars raged, the drow of Guallidurth took advan-

tage  of  the  dwarves  distraction  to  attack  the  caverns  of  Ala-

torin,  which  were  far  removed  from  the  frontlines  of  the

fighting. The First Spider War was fought from 8170 DR to

8150 DR and ended with the capture of Brightaxe Hall and the

collapse  of  Alatorin.  Aghast  at  their  folly,  the  eight  reigning

kings of that era forged an armistice, and turned their armies

against the drow. The Second Spider War raged from 8145 DR

to 8137 DR, and ended with the drow retreating from the cav-

erns of Alatorin.

In triumph, the eight kings marched their armies back into

Brightaxe  Hall,  pledging  never  again  to  fight  one  another.

Seeking to reclaim the vision of Taark Shanat, the eight kings

pleaded with their gods to pick one of them to sit on the Wyrm-

skull Throne. In response, the gods revealed the visage of the

reigning  king  of  Ultoksamrin,  high  priest  of  Dumathoin.

Shield dwarves mark this event as the beginning of the Second

Age of Shanatar and the elevation of Dumathoin as patron of

their race.

Despite their newfound unity, dissension still lurked within

the  breasts  of  many  of  Shanatars  citizens.  The  kings  of  both

Barakuir and Drakkalor both thought that they were entitled to

sit on the Wyrmskull Throne, backed by the whisperings of their

gods who had sought to have Moradin name them the patron of

the  shield  dwarves.  Before  such  dissent  could  erupt  into  open

strife, the illithids of Oryndoll attacked the eastern subkingdoms

in 8100 DR, beginning a conflict that came to be known as the

Mindstalker  Wars  to  the  dwarves  and  the  War  of  Cloven

Thoughts to the mind flayers. The illithids were driven back by

8080 DR, but in their wake the surviving Stout Folk discov-

ered that the caverns of Barakuir, which had been cut off in the

early  days  of  the  fighting,  lay  empty.  Clan  Duergar  had  been

carried back to thralldom in the mind flayers realm.

The  Second  Age  of  Shanatar  lasted  for  nearly  1,800  years.

Around  6150  DR,  the  drow  of  Guallidurth  once  again

attacked the caverns of Alatorin. The Third Spider War lasted

nearly thirty years but ended with the Stout Folk abandoning

Brightaxe Hall to the drow. The dwarven refugees brought the

Wyrmskull Throne with them, marking the end of the Second

Age of Shanatar.

As  the  Third  Age  of  Shanatar  dawned,  the  emperor  of

Shanatar  made  plans  to  establish  a  new  subkingdom  in  the

Realms  Above.  Dwarven  scouts  were  sent  up  to  the  surface

17

DWARVES

around  6100  DR,  where  they  allied  with  the  humans  of  the

region to oust the remaining djinni despots. The alliance between

the  dwarves  and  the  humans  quickly  foundered  because  the

rulers  of  Coramshan  turned  to  evil  gods.  In  response,  the

dwarves claimed the surface lands north of the Marching Moun-

tains as their own, establishing the kingdom of High Shanatar

around 5960 DR.

High  Shanatar  flourished  for  centuries  under  the  rule  of

House Axemarch, but the seeds of its destruction were planted

within a century of its establishment. A conflict over a looted

tomb led to skirmishing and eventually open warfare. The First

Kingdom of Mir was established after Iltaker fell to Murabir

Mir of Coramshan in 5330 DR, marking the beginning of the

centuries-long expansion of Calimshan at the expense of High

Shanatar.  By  2600  DR,  the  last  known  dwarves  of  High

Shanatar had fallen on the northern banks of the Sulduskoon

River, and High Shanatar was no more.

As  High  Shanatar  struggled  to  hold  on  to  its  territories  in

southwestern Faern, Deep Shanatar struggled with challenges

of  its  own.  Successive  waves  of  emigration  led  many  young

dwarves north to found new realms but also depleted the ranks

of those who remained. Over time, the northern kingdoms of

Drakkolor,  Korolnor,  Sondarr,  Torglor,  and  Xothaerin  slowly

dwindled away as their inhabitants migrated north. The kingdom

of Oghrann was established beneath the Plains of Tun in 5125

DR. The coastal realm of Haunghdannar was established in the

northern Sword Mountains and along the northern Sword Coast

in 4974 DR. Ammarindar was founded beneath the Graypeak

Mountains around 4160 DR, and Delzoun, the Northkingdom,

rose beneath what is now the Silver Marches around 3900 DR.

Unfortunately for the shield dwarves, their conquests in the

North  proved  illusory,  and  the  glory  of  Shanatar  was  never

reborn.  Oghrann  fell  in  3770  DR,  and  Haunghdannar  in

3389 DR. Delzoun and Ammarindar lasted many more cen-

turies,  but  the  Northkingdom  eventually  succumbed  in  100

DR, and Ammarindar was overrun in 882 DR by lingering hor-

rors unleashed by the Netherese of Ascalhorn.

In  the  South,  after  centuries  of  decline,  the  final  fall  of

Deep Shanatar was precipitated by the Stout Folk themselves.

Impelled  by  centuries  of  bitter  resentment,  Clan  Duergar

invaded  Ultoksamrin  and  Holorarar  around  1800  DR  in  a

series of conflicts known as the Kin Clashes. Only Iltkazar sur-

vived the gray dwarf invasion, leaving Shanatar fallen in all

but name.

Outlook

Despite their centuries-long decline and deserved reputation for

dourness and cynicism, shield dwarves have never succumbed to

fatalism. Shield dwarves have traditionally been divided into two

campsthe  Hidden  and  the  Wanderersalthough  such  divi-

sions  have  begun  to  fade  since  the  Thunder  Blessing.  While

members of the former group have literally hidden themselves

away from the outside world, content to pursue their traditional

way of life, members of the latter group have gone out into the

world, unbowed by their races relentless decline.

Shield  dwarves  are  traditionally  slow  to  trust  and  slow  to

forget slights, but a dawning realization of their races plight has

left many willing to seek out new ways of doing things uncon-

strained  by  traditional  prejudices  or  practices.  Shield  dwarves

have a long and proud tradition of adventuring, and many shield

dwarves follow this route simply in hopes of equaling or exceed-

ing  the  deeds  of  those  who  have  come  before.  Others  seek  to

recover long-lost strongholds and treasures that have fallen to

orcs or other beasts. Since the Thunder Blessing, the question for

many  young  shield  dwarves  is  not  why  they  should  become

adventurers, but why they should not.

SHIELD DWARF CHARACTERS

Constant  warfare  with  orcs,  goblins,  trolls,  and  giants  have

imbued a strong martial tradition in shield dwarf culture. Most

dwarves learn to defend their homes and clan, with fighters, pal-

adins,  and  martial  clerics  being  commonplace.  Other  shield

dwarves focus on time-honored skills, following the path of the

expert or the rogue. Arcane spellcasters are quite rare, with few

of  sorcerous  inclination.  Common  multiclass  combinations

include fighter/cleric, fighter/paladin, and fighter/expert.

Favored Class: A shield dwarfs favored class is fighter. For

centuries shield dwarves have fought a war of genocidal destruc-

tion  against  the  orcs,  goblins,  trolls,  and  giants  of  the  North.

Fighters have always served at the core of shield dwarf armies,

ever defiant in the face of overwhelming odds.

Prestige  Classes:  Battleragers  are  legendary  dwarven  war-

riors who can enter a divine battle frenzy through ritualistic

singing. Given to drinking, rowdy and boisterous singing, and

drunken dancing, battleragers love to plunge into close-quarters

battle, heedless of any danger. See the battlerager prestige class

in the appendix.

Shield dwarves of some accomplishment frequently adopt the

dwarven  defender  prestige  class,  and  many  of  their  clerics

become runecasters.

Shield Dwarf Society

Although clan and class divisions were once strong among shield

dwarves, generations of decline have largely broken their once-

dominant  influence.  While  shield  dwarves  are  still  incredibly

proud of their bloodlines, individual accomplishment now counts

for  more  than  longstanding  tradition  or  the  dictates  of  clan

elders. Shield dwarven life among the Hidden is still dominated

by craft and forge, but increasing numbers of shield dwarves are

making their own way in the world as adventurers or as crafts-

folk dwelling in human-dominated communities.

Shield  dwarves  are  raised  in  tight  family  units,  with  clan

elders playing a diminishing role in overseeing their upbringing.

Book learning is common, and most children are apprenticed to

learn  a  trade  as  they  near  maturity.  Adult  shield  dwarves  are

expected to support themselves and their family as well as bring

honor and riches to the clan. While shield dwarves do not shy

away from displays of wealth, they avoid ostentatious or deca-

dent behavior. As shield dwarves age, they are honored for their

wisdom  and  accorded  respect  for  their  past  accomplishments.

Families and clans are expected to honor their elders in death

with  solemn  funereal  rites  and  tombs  befitting  the  deceaseds

reputation and accomplishments.

Generations  of  Wanderers  have  created  large  and  thriving

dwarven  enclaves  within  most  human  settlements,  with  all

shield  dwarves  welcome  as  part  of  the  loosely  knit  dwarven

clan. Shield dwarves occupy the roles of smith or craftsmen in

many human communities and are well respected for their skill

as artisans. Few shield dwarves turn away from veneration of

18

DWARVES

the Morndinsamman, but most are quick to learn the local trade

tongue and make friends with other races.

Language and Literacy

Like all dwarves, shield dwarves speak Dwarven and employ

the Dethek rune alphabet. They also speak Common. The pri-

mary  shield  dwarven  dialect,  Shanatan,  dates  back  to  the

founding of Shanatar and is still spoken by dwarves along the

Sword Coast from the Shining Sea to the Spine of the World.

To the east, in northcentral Faern, most shield dwarves speak

the  Galenan  dialect,  strongly  influenced  by  the  Damaran

human tongue.

Common  secondary  languages  reflect  the  extensive  trading

contacts maintained by shield dwarves with their neighbors in

the  North  and  include  Chondathan,  Illuskan,  and,  to  a  lesser

extent,  Elven  and  Gnome.  The  shield  dwarves  of  north-

central  Faern  are  more  apt  to  learn  Damaran

than  Illuskan  as  a  secondary  language.  Many

shield  dwarves  also  learn  the  languages  of

their  traditional  foes,  including  Draconic,

Giant, Goblin, and Orc.

All  shield  dwarf  characters  are  literate

except for barbarians.

Shield Dwarf

Magic and Lore

Shield dwarves have been engaged

in a perpetual war against gobli-

noids and giants for centuries,

so their magic reflects a mar-

tial  bent.  Anything  that

helps  slay  more  giants  is  a

welcome  addition  to  the

shield dwarf arsenal.

Among  the  Hidden,

magic  from  the  Illusion  and  Abjura-

tion  schools  are  immensely  important,

because  they  guard  a  dwarf  clan  from  discovery

and  attack.  The  Hidden  create  layer  after  layer  of  protective

spells  to  guard  every  entrance  to  their  strongholds.  Many  an

invading orc horde has been tricked into leaving or frustrated

into exhaustion without ever seeing the shield dwarves theyre

fighting.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Shield dwarves have a strong divine spellcasting tradition, with

many of the Stout Folk called to serve the Morndinsamman as

clerics, paladins, runecasters, or runesmiths. Arcane spellcasters

are much more rare, but increasing in number.

Spellcasting Tradition: Shield dwarves often take the Shield

Dwarf  Warder  feat  (see  the  appendix),  which  reflects  their

knack for creating armor and shields with magic.

Unique Spells: Shield dwarves have created many divine spells

over the years, including mindless rage and shape metal (see

the appendix).

RACIAL MAGIC ITEMS

Shield dwarves favor magic items that aid in combat, whether

offensively or defensively. Whether magic is best employed to

protect or attack is a centuries-old argument among the shield

dwarves, with Wanderers favoring magic weapons and Hidden

favoring magic armor. In any case, all shield dwarves revere any

magic item that facilitates craftwork, because the urge to create

flows strongly in dwarven blood.

Axes and other blades are commonly crafted with keen, holy,

lawful, flaming, flaming burst, mighty cleaving, sundering, and

stunning special abilities. Hammers and maces are commonly

crafted  with  holy,  impact,  lawful,  returning,  shock,  shocking

burst,  stunning,  sundering,  and  throwing  special  abilities.

Armor  is  typically  crafted  with  fire  resistance,  fortification,

and  invulnerability  special  abilities,

reflecting  a  long  tradition  of  battles

against  orcs,  goblinoids,  trolls,  and

giants, and a deep understanding of

metalworking.

Common  Magic  Items: Com-

mon examples of items favored

by shield dwarves include anvils

of  the  blacksmith,  belts  of

dwarvenkind (often given as

gifts  to  nondwarves  who

help  a  dwarf  clan),  boots  of

the  winterlands,  forges  of

smithing,  hammers  of  the

weaponsmith,  tongs  of  the

armorer, and  whetstones  of

keen edge.

Iconic  Magic  Items:  Shield

dwarves  have  fabricated  many

unique magic items as well, such as

doorbreakers, hammers of staggering

blows,  and  stonereavers.  They  are

justly  famous  for  foesplitter  axes,

which are +1 keen battleaxes.

Shield Dwarf Deities

Shield  dwarves  have  venerated  the  dwarven  deities  of  the

Morndinsamman  since  the  dawn  of  Shanatar,  although  their

mythology has evolved significantly over the millennia. Taark

Shanat  and  his  followers  in  Alatorin  venerated  Moradin  and

Berronar,  but  worship  of  those  two  deities  receded  as  Taarks

eight sons set out to found their own kingdoms, each choosing

a  patron  deity  of  his  own  from  among  their  eight  children:

Dumathoin, Laduguer, Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Ver-

gadain, Sharindlar, and the twins Diinkarazan and Diirinka.

When  the  eight  kings  came  together  to  choose  who  would

first sit on the Wyrmskull Throne, Moradin selected the king of

Ultoksamrin, who was also the high priest of Dumathoin. This

act cemented the Silent Keepers position as patron deity of the

shield  dwarves  but  strongly  disappointed  Dumathoins  chief

rivals,  eventually  leading  to  Laduguers  bitter  exile  and

Abbathors  enduring  corruption.  By  the  fall  of  Shanatar,  the

shield  dwarves  had  abandoned  the  worship  of  Laduguer,

Diinkarazan,  and  Diirinka,  while  younger  gods  such  as  Thard

Dumathoin is considered the patron of shield dwarves, and his

church  has  by  far  the  most  adherents  among  shield  dwarves.

Miners and smiths venerate the Silent Keeper, but he also has

a small following among those good- and neutral-aligned shield

dwarves seeking secrets of arcane lore. The Mountain Shield is

also considered the guardian of the dead and is propitiated by

most  shield  dwarves  during  burials.  Dumathoins  clerics  take

charge of all burials, inter the dead in secret vaults, and guard

the funereal wealth of great shield dwarves.

Marthammor  Duin,  the  Finder-of-Trails,  is  venerated  by

those  shield  dwarves  who  consider  themselves  Wanderers.  He

watches  over  good-aligned  adventurers,  craftsfolk,  explorers,

expatriates,  travelers,  and  wanderers.  Marthammor  has  a  sec-

ondary aspect as the dwarven god of lightning, which curiously

has attracted a small but growing number of wizards and sor-

cerers who specialize in evocation magic.

Relations with Other Races

Shield  dwarves  get  along  well  with  most  other  dwarven  sub-

races,  although  they  regard  gold  dwarven  arrogance  as  naive

and have little understanding for their barbaric wild and arctic

dwarven  kin.  Shield  dwarves  have  a  longstanding  enmity  for

the descendants of Clan Duergar, dating back to the Kin Clashes

that marked Shanatars final chapter, and they attack duergar

on sight.

Despite  centuries  of  squabbling  with  elves  and  half-elves,

shield dwarves have always managed to put aside their differ-

ences with the Tel-quessir in the face of outside threats. Shield

dwarves have always gotten along well with gnomes, particularly

rock gnomes and deep gnomes. Colored by their experience with

lightfoots, shield dwarves find halflings to be somewhat unreli-

able but easy to get along with. Shield dwarves get along well

with  most  humans,  particularly  Illuskans,  Tethyrians,  Chon-

dathans, and Damarans.

Shield dwarves see half-orcs as little better than their hated

brethren, although exceptions do exist. The Stout Folk of the

North associate most planetouched with the horrors of Hellgate

Keep and view them with suspicion. Earth genasi are a notable

exception and are commonly welcomed in dwarven delves across

the North.

Shield Dwarf Equipment

Shield  dwarves  commonly  employ  equipment  such  as  armor

lubricant,  mobile  braces,  rope  climbers,  thunderstones,

and sunrods.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Shield dwarves favor a wide range of weapons, including battle-

axes, crossbows, gauntlets, handaxes, heavy picks, light hammers,

light picks, longswords, halfspears, short swords, mauls, throw-

ing axes, and warhammers. More unusual weapons include dwar-

ven urgroshes, dwarven waraxes, horned helmets, spiked chains,

spiked  gauntlets,  spiked  helmets,  and  spike  shooters.  Typical

forms of armor include breastplates, chainmail, half-plate, full

plate, large steel shields, and small steel shields. Less common

forms  of  armor  include  dwarven  plate,  grasping  shields,  and

large mithral shields.

Whenever possible, shield dwarves fashion their armor from

mithral; their love of the metal matches the gold dwarves admi-

ration for adamantine.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Shield  dwarves  favor  bats  (especially  the  common  bat),

canaries, and small lizards such as the spitting crawler as pets

and  familiars.  They  use  pack  lizards  and  mules  as  beasts  of

burden. Shield dwarves commonly employ ponies or war ponies

as steeds, except in Iltkazar, where riding lizards are still the

norm.  Favored  breeds  include  the  Island  pony,  the  Nether

pony, and the Whiteshield (war pony). The shield dwarves of

the Far Hills employ dire bats as steeds (fitted with exotic mil-

itary  saddles)  to  navigate  the  subterranean  wells  they  call

home. Shield dwarf barbarians and battleragers often employ

dire boars as steeds.

Dwarf, Urdunnir

Regions:  Dwarf  (shield),  Lake  of  Steam,  the  North,  Tethyr,

Urdunnir Dwarf. Small numbers of urdunnir dwarves live

among  the  shield  dwarf  citadels  of  the  North,  but  most

urdunnirs  hail  from  their  own  secretive  kingdom  in  the

deep Underdark.

Racial Feats: Stoneblood, Stoneshaper, Stonewalker Fist.

Level Adjustment: +4.

Urdunnirs, sometimes known as orecutter dwarves, are a long-

forgotten offshoot of shield dwarves who have become one with

the  earth  and  stone.  Thanks  to  the  blessings  of  Dumathoin,

urdunnirs can walk through earth and stone as if it were air and

shape metal and stone with their hands. Many orecutter dwarves

are clerics of Dumathoin, expert smiths, or expert gemcutters.

The Children of Dumathoin, as they call themselves, believe

that the Silent Keeper transformed their ancestors in order to

create a race of dwarves who could appreciate the true beauty of

the subterranean landscape without needing to destroy it in the

process.  They  have  dwelt  ever  since  in  splendid  isolation  in

Oldonnar,  the  legendary  Lost  Kingdom  of  Shanatar,  deep  be-

neath the Alimir Mountains.

Averaging 4 1/2 feet tall but weighing much more than an

adult human, orecutter dwarves are stocky and muscular. The

skin  of  an  urdunnir  is  light  gray,  and  their  eyes  are  always

silver. Both genders wear their hair long, and males (and some

females) have long, carefully groomed beards and mustaches.

Hair color is uniformly gray, with varying degrees of silver and

black highlights.

Urdunnirs see the world as a work of living beauty, walking

through  stone  and  earth  much  as  a  diver  might  explore  the

wonders  of  the  ocean  depths.  The  Children  of  Dumathoin

regard  themselves  as  particularly  blessed,  for  they  are  not

forced  to  cling  to  the  exterior  of  Dumathoins  creation  like

other  races  but  can  wander  through  the  heart  of  the  world

itself in an endless search to uncover the Silent Keepers hidden

secrets (gems).

Urdunnir dwarves have the life expectancy and age categories

defined  for  dwarves  in  Tables  64  and  65  of  the  Players

Handbook,  but  use  the  following  random  height  and  weight

characteristics instead of those described on Table 66 (the extra

History

Shortly  after  Taark  Shanat  and

his  followers  first  claimed  the

caverns of Alatorin, Dumathoin

transformed  a  small  group  of

devout  shield  dwarves  into

urdunnirs,  in  hopes  that  they

would be better able to appreciate

the beauty of his creation. These

early  orecutter  dwarves  broke

off from their fellows and set out

to  establish  their  own  realm,

deep  in  the  heart  of  the  world.

Miles beneath the Alimir Penin-

sula,  they  discovered  the  Corun-

dumdelve,  a  vast  dodecahedron

composed  entirely  of  tightly

packed  amethysts,  rubies,  and

sapphires,  each  larger  than  a

dwarven  helm.  Seeing  this  as  a

sign from the Silent Keeper, the

urdunirrin  established  the  king-

dom  of  Oldonnar  around  the

Hidden  Gem  of  the  Depths  and

have  dwelt  there  in  splendid,

unchanging isolation ever since.

DWARVES

URDUNNIR CHARACTERS

Their  cultural  focus  on  craft  skills  has  made  most  urdunnirs

experts  in  their  trade.  Others  choose  to  serve  Dumathoin

directly as clerics. Fighters, rangers, and paladins are relatively

rare, for few orecutter dwarves have ever been forced to defend

their holdings from other races. Those who practice the arcane

arts are even scarcer, with those evincing the powers of sorcery

usually  tracing  their  powers  back  to  creatures  of  elemental

earth.  Common  multiclass  combinations  include  expert/cleric

and expert/fighter.

Favored  Class:  An  urdunnirs

favored  class  is  expert.  Far

removed from the endless battles

that  have  plagued  their  kin,  the

deep-dwelling  urdunnirs  have  the

luxury  of  concentrating  on  their

craft  skills,  forever  seeking  the

buried  treasures  and  secrets  of

Dumathoin.

Prestige  Classes:  Urdunnir

characters  rarely  multiclass  into

prestige classes, but those who do

favor  divine  disciple,  hierophant,

loremaster, and runecaster.

Urdunnir

Society

The isolation of urdunnirs has pre-

served traditional family and clan

strictures  in  a  form  largely  un-

changed  since  the  founding  of

Shanatar. In that respect, orecut-

ter dwarves have more in common

with their gold dwarf cousins than

they do with the shield dwarves of

the  North.  Class  divisions  are

almost  nonexistent,  for  there  is

little concept of wealth among the

Children  of  Dumathoin,  but  clan

divisions  are  quite  strong  and

Urdunnir dwarf

Outlook

Secure in their otherworldly fast-

nesses and isolated from external

threats,  orecutter  dwarves  have

never experienced great wars with other races. As such, urdun-

nirs lack the martial traditions of their gold, gray, and shield

dwarven cousins. Strangely enough, urdunnirs share with druids

and  elves  a  deep  understanding  of  the  natural  world.  From  a

young age, orecutter dwarves are taught to live in harmony with

their  environment.  They  see  Dumathoins  vast  creation  as  a

great sea of earth and stone, ever-changing and always beautiful.

They view their role in the world as that of both observer and

artisan,  working  in  harmony  with  Dumathoins  creation  to

unlock the secrets the Silent Keeper has hidden within.

Thanks  to  their  relative  isolation,  orecutter  dwarves  are

rarely drawn to the adventuring way of life. However, those who

encounter other races or stumble across doings in the Realms

Above  often  find  their  curiosity  piqued,  becoming  driven  to

understand those who have not been blessed by Dumathoin.

govern most societal behavior.

Orecutter dwarves are raised in tight family units, with clan

elders playing a strong oversight role in the upbringing of each

child. Book learning is common, albeit in forms not well under-

stood in the Realms Above, and most children are apprenticed

to learn a trade as they near maturity. The greatest artisans use

their skills to unveil Dumathoins secrets and shape his creations

into new and pleasing forms, all without disturbing them from

their original resting place. As orecutter dwarves age, they are

honored  for  their  wisdom  and  accorded  respect  for  their  past

accomplishments. Families and clans are expected to honor their

elders in death by weaving their bodies into gemstone veins that

wind through the earth in a fashion befitting the deceaseds rep-

utation and accomplishments.

Orecutter  dwarves  are  almost  unknown  outside  their  own

communities,  but  those  who  do  leave  usually  seek  out  other

dwarven communities in which to dwell. They typically organ-

ize themselves according to ancient clan strictures that suggest

21

DWARVES

little  understanding  of  the  cultures  in  which  they  dwell  or

changes in the world since the birth of their race.

Language and Literacy

Urdunnirs speak Dwarven and employ the Dethek rune alpha-

bet. They also speak Undercommon, the trade language of the

Realms  Below.  The  only  known  urdunnir  dialect,  an  archaic

form of Shanatan, dates back to the founding of Shanatar.

Common secondary languages include the dialect of Gnome

spoken by the svirfneblin and Terran, the language of elemen-

tal earth. Some urdunnir learn the language of their foes, includ-

ing  the  drow  dialect  of  Elven,  Kuo-Toan,  Beholder,  and

Aboleth.  Few  venture  close  to  the  surface,  but  those  that  do

occasionally learn Common, Alzhedo, or Illuskan.

All  urdunnir  characters  are  literate  except  for  barbarians,

who are very rare among this people.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Urdunnir dwarves have all the dwarven racial traits listed in the

Players Handbook, except as follows:

+4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison: Urdunnirs are

even more resistant to toxins than other dwarves.

Stone Walk (Su): Urdunnirs can pass through stone and earth

as  if  it  were  air.  They  can  carry  up  to  twice  their  own  body

weight with them in this manner. Urdunnirs (and anyone car-

ried  with  them)  cannot  breathe  while  within  stone  or  earth

and must hold their breath while traveling in this manner.

Stone Shape (Sp): At will as an 8th-level sorcerer.

Shape  Metal (Sp):  At  will  as  an  8th-level  sorcerer  once  per

round. This power works just like the shape metal spell (see the

appendix), except that urdunnirs can only affect 5 cubic feet

of metal. Using this ability is a full-round action.

Automatic Languages: Dwarven, Undercommon. Bonus Lan-

guages: By region.

Favored Class: Expert.

Level  Adjustment:  +4:  Urdunnirs  have  the  ability  to  walk

through  stone  and  earth  and  two  unusual  spell-like  abilities.

They are more powerful and gain levels more slowly than the

common races of Faern. See Table 1 in the Introduction for

more information.

Urdunnir Magic and Lore

To the urdunnir dwarves, magic has no inherent interest, but it

is  a  useful  tool  to  help  them  delve  through  the  heart  of  the

world. They favor divination magic to commune with Dumath-

oin, and illusions to keep the rest of the Underdark away.

Spellcasting Tradition: Urdunnirs favor spells that assist

in  craftwork  or  mining  or  enable  close  communion  with

Dumathoin,  such  as  make  whole,  meld  into  stone,  and  stone

shape.  Orecutter  dwarves  have  created  many  divine  spells

over the years; one such example is commune with earth (see

the appendix).

Many urdunnirs take the Runesmith feat (see the appendix)

because they have difficulty finding many material components

so far beneath the surface.

URDUNNIR MAGIC ITEMS

Urdunnirs favor magic items that facilitate their craft skills or

further  their  communion  with  Dumathoin.  When  they  make

weapons of war, they favor blades and axes with holy, lawful,

mighty  cleaving,  sundering,  and  thundering  special  abilities.

They also wield hammers and maces with holy, impact, lawful,

returning, sundering, and throwing special abilities.

Common  Magic  Items: As  befits  their  name,  orecutter

dwarves  favor  magic  items  that  improve  artisanship,  such  as

anvils  of  the  blacksmith,  belts  of  dwarvenkind,  forges  of

smithing,  hammers  of  the  weaponsmith,  necklaces  of  prayer

beads, tongs of the armorer, and whetstones of keen edge.

Iconic Magic Items: Urdunnirs are unquestioned masters of

magically enhancing dendritic armor, which they call earthskin.

The  lucky  purchaser  who  can  find  the  urdunnirs  in  the  first

place can obtain a 10% discount on such armor.

Urdunnir Deities

The Children of Dumathoin have always venerated the Silent

Keeper and see him as the patron of their race. The Keeper of

Secrets under the Mountain is revered by all urdunnirs, whose

mythology holds (correctly) that he created their ancestors by

transforming a small number of shield dwarves from ancient

Shanatar. To the urdunnirs, Dumathoins secrets are liter-

ally gems buried within the strata. Their patrons greatest gift

was the ability to move through the earth, seeing the beauty

of  his  creation  that  others  can  only  experience  through

destructive mining.

Relations with Other Races

The  deep-dwelling  urdunnirs  have  little  exposure  to  other  races

aside from those that dwell in the Underdark. They are deeply sus-

picious of elves and half-elves thanks to centuries of dealing with

their dark cousins. They get along well with shield dwarves and

gold dwarves, but dislike the gray dwarves. Halflings, humans, half-

orcs, and most planetouched are almost unknown to the urdunnirs.

However, they have good relations with earth genasi, whom they

sometimes encounter exploring the depths of the earth.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Orecutter dwarves have a strong divine spellcasting tradition,

with  many  of  the  Stout  Folk  called  to  serve  Dumathoin  as

clerics,  runecasters,  or  runesmiths.  Arcane  spellcasters  are

almost unknown.

Urdunnir Equipment

Urdunnirs encrust almost everything they make with gems and

other treasures of the earth. They have almost no access to wood

or other similar materials and find something as simple as a

bow fascinating.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Urdunnirs favor a wide range of weapons, including battleaxes,

gauntlets,  halfspears,  handaxes,  heavy  picks,  light  hammers,

light picks, longswords, mauls, short swords, throwing axes, and

warhammers. More unusual weapons include dwarven urgroshes

and dwarven waraxes. Unlike races that live closer to the sur-

face,  orecutter  dwarves  use  metal  even  for  the  hafts  of  their

bladed  weapons.  This  increases  their  durability  in  combat

(increase the weapons hit points by 50%) but doubles the weight

of the hafted weapon.

Typical forms of armor include breastplates, chainmail, half-

plate, full plate, large steel shields, and small steel shields. More

unusual forms of armor include dwarven plate,  earthskin (see

the appendix), and large mithral shields. Urdunnirs commonly

employ equipment such as armor lubricant and thunderstones.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Urdunnirs generally eschew pets and familiars, since their sub-

terranean homes are inaccessible to most creatures not of the

Elemental Plane of Earth. Those very few urdunnirs who turn

to arcane magic sometimes employ earth or magma mephits

as familiars.

Urdunnir Region

Most urdunnir characters take the urdunnir region as opposed

to the regions of the surrounding human lands.

Preferred Classes: Expert, cleric, fighter, paladin. A charac-

ter of one of these classes may choose a regional feat and gain

his choice of the bonus equipment below as a 1st-level charac-

ter. An urdunnir character of any other class may not select

one  of  the  regional  feats  here  and  does  not  gain  the  bonus

equipment at 1st level.

Automatic Languages: Dwarven, Undercommon.

Bonus  Languages:  Alzhedo,  Beholder,  Common,  Draconic,

Elven, Giant, Gnome, Terran.

Regional Feats: Stoneblood, Stoneshaper, Stonewalker Fist.

Bonus  Equipment:  (A)  heavy  pick*  or  heavy  mace*;  (B)

chainmail*; or (C) dwarven urgrosh, large steel shield*, and 3

thunderstones.

Dwarf, Wild

Regions: Chult, Tashalar, Wild Dwarf.

Racial  Feats:  Disentangler,  Hammer  Fist,  Jungle  Stamina,

Swarmfighting.

Wild dwarves, who call themselves dur Authalar (the People),

are the primitive inhabitants of the Jungles of Chult and the

Mhair and Black Jungles. They have largely rejected the clan-

based craft- and smith-oriented culture of their gold, gray, and

shield dwarf cousins, choosing instead to live in hunting bands

with  ever-shifting  memberships.  Eschewing  all  trappings  of

civilization, wild dwarves live like beasts, engaged in an endless

hunt for survival. Only those who dare the shadowy depths of

Faerns  southern  jungles  are  even  aware  of  the  existence  of

this barbaric dwarven subrace, for these elusive hunters keep to

the depths of their woodland homes.

Wild dwarves are dark-skinned, short, and stout, with dark

brown  eyes.  Their  heavily  tattooed  bodies  are  covered  with

grease to ward off insects and make them hard to hold. Wild

dwarves wear little except their long, woven hair, which serves

as  adequate  clothing.  They  plaster  their  hair  and  skin  with

mud to form a crude armor when going to war.

Dur Authalar have more in common with the beasts of the

jungle than they do with their dwarven kin, viewing life as an

endless hunt and each day a struggle to kill or be killed. Wild

dwarves distrust all intruders into their jungle domain and, if

confronted, are apt to attack first without question. Much like

the  beasts  they  strive  to  emulate,  wild  dwarves  care  little

about goings-on in the world at large, the doings of those who

are not wild dwarves, or material possessions.

Wild  dwarves  have  the  life  expectancy  and  age  categories

defined  for  dwarves  in  Tables  64  and  65  of  the  Players

Handbook,  but  use  the  following  random  height  and  weight

characteristics instead of those described on Table 66:

Wild dwarf, male

Wild dwarf, female

2'8"

2'6"

+2d4

+2d4

50 lb.  (1d4) lb.

40 lb.  (1d4) lb.

History

The  drow  conquest  of  Bhaerynden  sometime  around  the  year

9000 DR forced the Stout Folk of that realm to scatter to iso-

lated  holdings  across  the  South.  One  of  the  largest  groups  of

dwarves to flee the destruction made their way overland to the

Chultan  peninsula  before  splintering  into  small  tribal  groups.

There they emerged as a distinct subrace known as wild dwarves.

Dur Authalar have never reversed their rapid descent into bar-

barism  and  have  largely  forgone  the  strictures  of  clan  life.

Although  several  great  empires  have  claimed  their  territory

from time to time, including the Chultan realm based in Mezro,

the  yuan-ti  empire  of  Serpentes  that  arose  after  the  fall  of

Netheril, and the Cities of the Seabreeze that came together to

form the kingdom of Tashtan, the wild dwarves have never been

conquered.  Instead,  they  have  chosen  to  simply  melt  into  the

depths  of  the  jungle  until  such  time  as  they  could  peaceably

reclaim their old hunting grounds.

Outlook

Wild dwarves see the world in terms of hunter and prey. In the

minds  of  the  dur  Authalar,  civilization  is  but  a  veneer  that

obscures the endless cycle of prey and predation. Wild dwarves

care only about securing their next meal and surviving the ever-

present dangers of the natural world. From a young age, wild

dwarves join in the hunt, and the lack of strong family or clan

ties ensures that each wild dwarf understands just how alone he

or she is in the world.

Those few wild dwarves who have chosen a life of adventure

usually found it thrust upon them. Many were once captives of

Calishite slavers who escaped and must now make their own way

in  the  world.  Lacking  the  support  of  the  pack  in  which  they

were  raised,  many  see  the  close  camaraderie  of  adventuring

bands  as  a  close  approximation  of  their  traditional  hunting-

bands and thus seek out such groups.

23

DWARVES

WILD DWARF CHARACTERS

The primitive way of life led by wild dwarves ensures that the

skills of the barbarian are highly prized. Rangers and fighters

who are capable of defeating potential predators and hunting for

food survive longer than those who must rely on the beneficence

of the pack. Clerics and druids of Thard Harr spread the teach-

ing  needed  to  survive  in  the  harsh  jungle  environment,  while

rogues skilled in making and setting traps bring much needed

bounty to the nightly feast. Common multiclass combinations

include barbarian/fighter, barbarian/ranger, barbarian/druid, and

ranger/druid.

Favored Class: A wild dwarfs favored class is barbarian. Un-

like their more civilized kin, the dur Authalar have retreated

into barbarism beneath the thick jungle canopy of Chult. In the

face of the many dangers that stalk their homeland, survival de-

mands the heightened senses, fast movement, and battle rages of

a barbarian.

Wild Dwarf Society

Wild  dwarves  organize  themselves  into  loose,  ever-changing

hunting bands and pay little heed to distinctions of family or

clan. They live nomadic lives that revolve around the hunt and

escaping  from  more  powerful  predators.  Material  wealth  and

goods mean very little, with weapons being the only objects to

which they evince any real attachment.

Wild  dwarven  children  are  raised  communally,  with  only

faint familial bonds ever acknowledged. Book learning is non-

existent, and the young are taught to hunt as soon as they can

keep up with the pack. All adults are expected to contribute to

the communal life, whether it be watching over the young or

leading the hunt.

While the wild dwarves respect the wisdom of elders, those

who grow too weak to keep up through persistent sickness or age

are eventually left behind by their kin. A few choose their own

deaths, suicidally attacking a great beast single-handedly. They

are remembered for their bravery in nightly tales that gradually

grow into myths.

Few wild dwarves ever leave their traditional way of life in

the  southern  jungles.  Wild  dwarves  encountered  beyond  the

jungle  are  usually  loners  who  have  either  been  captured  and

enslaved or voluntarily chosen exile. Most such wild dwarves

eventually  find  their  niche  alongside  rangers,  hunters,  or

druids,  although  a  few  join  packs  of  lycanthropes  and  other

sentient beasts in an attempt to recreate their traditional way

of life.

Language and Literacy

Wild dwarves speak a dialect of Dwarven, as well as Common.

Those rare individuals who are literate employ the Dethek rune

alphabet. The wild dwarf dialect, Authalan, is distantly related

to the dialect of the gold dwarves, and betrays a subtle Chultan

and Tashalan influence.

Common  secondary  languages  reflect  the  dominant  lan-

guages of the Chultan peninsula and include Chultan, Draconic,

Goblin, Shaaran, Tashalan, and Yuan-Ti.

No  wild  dwarves  are  literate,  except  for  those  who  select  a

Players Handbook character class other than barbarian.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Wild  dwarves  have  all  the  dwarven  racial  traits  listed  in  the

Players Handbook except as follows:

Small: As Small creatures, wild dwarves gain a +1 size bonus to

Armor  Class,  a  +1  size  bonus  on  attack  rolls,  and  a  +4  size

bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smaller weapons than

humans  use,  and  their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are  three-

quarters of those of Medium-size characters.

Wild dwarf land speed is 20 feet.

Proficient with the handaxe and blowgun (described on Table

62 in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). The blowgun is such an

integral part of wild dwarf life that all wild dwarves learn to use

the weapon. This replaces the normal weapon familiarity.

Poison  Use.  Wild  dwarves  work  with  poisons  from  an  early

age,  and  they  never  risk  accidentally  poisoning  themselves

when applying poison to a weapon.

Fire  resistance  5.  Wild  dwarves  are  inured  to  the  oppressive

heat of Chult.

+3 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. This replaces

the standard dwarven bonus against poison. Wild dwarves are

immune to wild dwarf knockout poison.

+4 racial bonus on saving throws against disease. Wild dwarves

have developed a strong resistance to disease of all types.

Wild dwarves are not nearly as capable or familiar with stone

and metal as their more civilized kin. They do not receive the

dwarven  stonecunning  trait  or  the  bonus  on  Appraise  and

Craft checks related to stone or metal.

Automatic Languages: Dwarven, Common, home region. Bonus

Languages: Chultan, Draconic, Goblin, Tashalan, Yuan-Ti.

Favored Class: Barbarian.

Wild Dwarf Magic and Lore

Wild dwarves take what magic they know for granted. The bless-

ings of Thard Harr, transmitted through the tribes cleric, are

no more unusual than the chieftains prowess in warfare or the

healers ability to find beneficial herbs in the jungle. Conversely,

wild dwarves are often anxious around magic theyve never seen

before, which includes most arcane magic and any magic items

based on manufactured goods.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Wild dwarves have a strong divine spellcasting tradition, with

many of the Stout Folk called to serve Thard Harr as clerics,

druids, or rangers. Arcane spellcasters are almost unknown.

Spellcasting  Tradition:  Wild  dwarves  favor  spells  that  that

interact  with  the  natural  world  and  aid  in  the  hunt,  such  as

barkskin, calm animals, commune with nature, dominate animal,

entangle,  hold  animal,  repel  vermin,  and  wall  of  thorns.  Wild

dwarves do not appear to create many spells, or, if they do, they

are not widely known and disseminated.

24

DWARVES

Wild dwarves often augment their magic with extra grunts,

gesticulations,  and  herbs  gathered  from  their  jungle  home.

Many take the Primitive Caster feat (see the appendix).

as cruel exploiters and view most Tashalans as servants of the

yuan-ti. Wild dwarves reserve their greatest hatred for the gob-

lins of Chult.

WILD DWARF MAGIC ITEMS

Wild dwarves favor magic items that aid in combat, facilitate

fast movement, or provide personal protection. Common exam-

ples of such include amulets of natural armor, anklets of spring-

ing  and  striding  (identical  to  the  boots  of  the  same  name),

anklets  of  speed  (identical  to  the

boots  of  the  same  name),  and  all

manner of magical oils.

Wild Dwarf Equipment

Wild dwarves generally eschew any form of clothing, choosing

instead to wear their hair long and cover their bodies with tat-

toos and grease. In times of war, they plaster their bodies with

mud, forming effective but crude mud armor. When defending

their home caves, they like to use

all  manner  of  pits,  snares,  dead-

falls, and other traps.

Iconic Magic Items: Wild dwarves

have  fabricated  many  unique  magic

items as well, such as anklets of free-

dom  of  movement  (as  the  ring,  but

worn on the feet), ointment of bark-

skin, and  tanglepatches  (see  the

appendix).

Although  the  wild  dwarves  occa-

sionally make offerings to the other

dwarven deities, they truly worship

only  Thard  Harr,  Lord  of  the

Jungle Deeps. In the folklore of the

dur Authalar, the Morndinsamman

are  reduced  to  little  more  than

powerful  spirits,  often  associated

with  specific  landmarks  or  natural

phenomena. The Lord of the Jungle

Deeps  is  the  protector  of  wild

dwarves,  aiding  them  against

marauding beasts and intruders

into the jungle fastness. Nearly

all  wild  dwarves  venerate

Thard Harr, viewing him not only as

patron  of  their  kind  but  also  as  a

source  of  great  wisdom  and  experience.  He  teaches  the  wild

dwarves to both respect and emulate the ways of beasts, par-

ticularly great jungle cats, and live in harmony with nature.

Relations with Other Races

Hidden away in their vast jungle, wild dwarves have little expo-

sure  to  races  that  do  not  dwell  in  significant  numbers  on  the

Chultan peninsula. Wild dwarves have good relations with other

dwarven  subraces  after  centuries  of  peaceful  contact  with  a

small number of shield dwarves who have emigrated to Chult.

Wild  dwarves  have  almost  no  knowledge  of  elves,  half-elves,

gnomes, halflings, half-orcs, or planetouched, although they get

along  well  with  the  ghostwise  halflings  on  the  rare  occasions

they meet.

Wild dwarves have mixed feelings about humans. While they

get along well with Chultans, they see Calishites and Lantanna

25

Unique Item: Wild dwarf knock-

out poison (see the appendix).

ARMS AND ARMOR

Wild  dwarves  commonly  employ

weapons  such  as  halfspears,  han-

daxes, and the ubiquitous blowguns

with  barbed  darts  coated  with

knockout poison.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Wild dwarves favor bats, ocelots

(lynxes),  snakes,  and  toads  as

familiars;  they  prefer  hunting

cats, such as leopards and tigers,

as  pets  or  animal  companions.

The  wild  dwarves  reverence  for

the  great  felines  of  the  jungle  is

so great that most refuse to hunt

them.

Wild dwarves eschew the use of

pack or riding animals, although

from  time  to  time  those  who

dwell  in  the  Jungles  of  Chult

attempt  to  harness  triceratops  for

the latter role.

Originally  hailing  from  another  realm  far

removed  from  Faern  in  the  distant  past,

the elves have proved to be one of the most

successful and diverse races to appear on Abeir-Toril. They have

taken to the lands, the seas, and even the skies of Faern, colo-

nizing and expanding through the ages. Today, the great elven

realms may have retreated from the encroachment of humans

and humanoids, but the elven influence in the world is unmis-

takable and pervasive.

Elves adapt and change dramatically to meld with their sur-

roundings,  so  through  the  generations  the  various  tribes  of

elves have become quite divergent in appearance and outlook.

Despite  this,  all  elves  retain  certain  characteristics  that  set

them apart from the other races of the world. Collectively, the

elves  know  themselves  as  the  Tel-quessir  (translated  into  the

common tongue, this means, The People). They refer to all

other  beings  as  the  N-Tel-Quess,  a  less-than-diplomatic  elven

expression meaning not-people.

Elves  are  graceful,  lithe,  and  beautiful.  Regardless  of  their

particular heritage, they are viewed by other races as a highly

magical and wondrous people. This awe and respect has an unex-

pected  corollarymany  people  view  elves  as  haughty  and

shamelessly  introverted  as  a  race.  The  reasons  for  this  are

numerous, including jealousy, envy, and religious hatred. It is the

nature  of  the  elf  to  elicit  such  reactions  from  others,  for  it

seems impossible upon first encountering the elves to react with

anything resembling disinterest or apathy.

Overview

Many of Faerns inhabitants believe there to be only six dif-

ferent  subraces  of  elves,  but  there  are  at  least  seven.  Most

common  on  Faern  are  the  moon,  sun,  and  wood  elves.  The

drow  are  easily  the  most  notorious.  Less  well  known  are  wild

elves and aquatic elves, who dwell in distant, remote, and inhos-

pitable regions that see few human visitors. Beyond these six sub-

races  stands  a  sevenththe  avariels,  or  winged  elves.  Driven

nearly to extinction in ancient times, the last tribe of avariels

is only now rekindling ties with the outside world.

Despite the incredible diversity of the various elven subraces,

all  elves  share  a  number  of  characteristics.  Perhaps  the

strongest thing they share is their affinity for magic. The use of

magic pervades elven society at every level. The most impressive

examples  of  elven  magic  are  the  mythals,  powerful  fields  of

magical energy created by the ancient elves to cloak entire cities

with  protective  and  useful  magical  auras.  The  elves  natural

resistance to enchantment spells is likely due in part to the fact

that every moment of their lives is spent immersed in such

magical environments.

Elven  cities,  even  without  the  common  magical  enhance-

ments that many carry, are beautiful sights indeed. To an elf, a

building is little different than a mountain or a tree. They strive

to fashion their homes and structures in such a way that they

blend completely with their natural surroundings, adding to the

natural beauty and purity of the landscape rather than detract-

ing from it. The squat, functional buildings constructed by most

humans strike most elves as ridiculous and intrusive.

Elven doors are of particular interest. Traditional elven archi-

tecture tries to blend into nature, and as a result external door-

ways into elven structures are often disguised cleverly in the side

of a large tree, as a large stone on the side of a hill, and so on.

Elven children quickly become quite well practiced at finding

and noticing doors, and this skill follows them into adulthood.

Secret  doors  built  by  other  races  often  amuse  the  elves  with

their crude attempts at disguise.

Unlike other humanoid races, elves dont truly sleep. An elf

needs only to rest and relax in a trance known as a reverie for

four  hours  every  day.  Most  elven  bedrooms  more  closely

resemble lounges or studies furnished with comfortable couches

or divans. The elven reverie has another interesting effect: An

26

elven town never really seems to change in activity level. The

length of the reverie allows most elves to enjoy periods of activ-

ity approaching 20 hours in a single day. In combination with

their incredibly long lifespans, the reverie means that elves can

afford to take their time with their projects. If the elves had the

humans bustling need to complete projects as soon as possible,

there would truly be no limit to what they could accomplish.

Although elves are thought of as a peace-loving people, their

racial history is filled with bloodshed and terrible wars to rival

any other race. Even today, all elves spend their formative years

training with the traditional weaponry of their kind. A proper

elf  should  be  ready  to  defend  her  home  with  magic  and  with

steel should the need arise. Despite this, elves do not succumb to

feral  savagery  in  their  training.  They  view  combat  and  other

martial activities as yet another face of the natural world, and

no  less  deserving  of  their  careful  attention  and  respect.  As  a

result, the elves treat combat almost as a masterfully choreo-

graphed dance.

Racial History

The  elves,  despite  their  long  history,  are  not  true  natives  to

Faern. They came to Faern from the realm of Faerie twenty-

five millennia ago, passing through fey crossroads and backroads

that have long since been lost. The first elves to arrive were the

Sy-tel-quessir (green elves), the Ly-tel-quessir (lythari), and the

Aril-tel-quessir (avariel). Of these original three races, only the

green elves, now known as the wild elves, survive in any number.

The avariel are nearly extinct now, having fought many terri-

ble wars with the dragons of the ancient world. The lythari have

changed so far from their elven roots that they are regarded by

most Faernian scholars as a separate race from the Tel-quessir.

The  second  wave  of  elves  to  travel  to  Faern  included  the

Ssri-tel-quessir  (destined  to  become  the  drow).  They  were  the

most successful, emerging from the southern jungles of Faern

and quickly establishing grand empires in their new home. At

the  same  time,  the  Ar-tel-quessir  (sun  elves)  and  the  Teu-tel-

quessir  (moon  elves)  arrived  to  the  north.  The  Alu-tel-quessir

(aquatic  elves)  appeared  in  the  Great  Sea  not  long  after.  The

martial  strength  and  magical  prowess  of  the  peoples  in  this

second wave of elven immigrants brought the Time of Dragons

to a close.

As  the  Time  of  Dragons  ended,  the  First  Flowering  of  the

Fair Folk began, and the elves settled into five major civiliza-

tions along the west and south of Faern. Along the Sword Coast

rose Aryvandaar of the sun elves, Illefarn of the green elves,

Miyeritar,  Shantel  Othreier,  and  Keltormir.  To  the  south,  in

what is now the Vilhon Reach, rose the three green elf nations

of  Thearnytaar,  Eiellr,  and  Sypiir,  while  two  more  realms

arose in the forests that once covered the Shaar: Orishaar of the

moon elves, and Ilythiir of the dark elves.

These elven nations each grew and expanded and developed in

their own ways. Unfortunately, these idyllic times were not to

last.  Some  provocationthe  emerging  cruelty  of  Ilythiir,  the

continued and often violent expansions of Aryvandaar (which

had  fallen  under  the  control  of  the  Vyshaantar  family),  or

another long-forgotten transgressionsparked the first Crown

War.  Over  the  next  several  hundred  years,  the  elven  nations

slowly tore themselves apart. Just as one Crown War ended, it

seemed that some new affront sparked a new one.

The nations of Ilythiir and Miyeritar saw the worst of the

fighting in the early Crown Wars, but as the Fourth Crown War

dawned, the dark elves of Ilythiir raised the conflict to a new

level. Ages ago, a faction of the Seldarine, led by Corellons lover

Araushnee, turned on their kin in an attempt to displace the Sel-

darine. Corellon and his loyal kin defeated Araushnee and the

other traitors, and banished them to the Demonweb Pits. Frus-

trated with their inability to eradicate their enemies, the Ilythiir

elves committed an unheard-of crime: They called upon the trai-

tor goddess Araushnee (now known as Lolth) and used the ter-

rible might she granted to completely destroy Miyeritar. The

decimated green elves never recovered, fleeing into the deepest

forests. Some, hiding even from their own kin, became the wild

elves; others merged with like-minded sun or moon elf refugees

to become a new subrace, the wood elves.

Shocked and dismayed at the actions of the Ilythiir, the Sel-

darine intervened. By Corellons decree, the Ilythiir elves were

cursed, transformed into drow, and banished from the surface

world  into  the  Underdark.  After  this,  Corellon  insisted  that

the elven elders come together in a great forest to the east to

debate the cause of the divisiveness and strife at a place of deci-

sion and judgement. This place became the Elven Court in Cor-

manthor.  After  much  debate,  the  Seldarine  found  that  the

Vyshaantar, sun elf lords of Aryvandaar, were culpable. The

Vyshaantar were destroyed in the fifth and final Crown War

that followed this verdict.

In the ten millennia since the last Crown War, many other

elven nations have risen and fallen on the island of Evermeet,

in the Vale of Evereska, deep in the High Forest, in the great

forest of Cormanthor, and in the distant Yuirwood. Although

these newer nations all achieved great things in their own time,

none  of  them  ever  equaled  the  might  and  power  achieved  by

those first nations established during the First Flowering. As the

humans  began  to  raise  their  own  empires,  the  elves  found  it

beyond their abilities to check the rash expansion and arrogant

power of lands such as Jhaamdath, Coramshan, and Netheril.

Confronted  by  vigorous  human  expansion  into  the  ancient

forestlands of Faern, the second-born realms of the elves once

again faced the prospect of endless cycles of warfare. The elves

began to talk of retreating from the world of humanity to some-

where they could truly call their own. In 714 DR, the fall of

Myth Drannor galvanized the surviving elven realms to action,

and  elves  began  to  travel  westward  to  Evermeet,  abandoning

their ancient lands. As more and more elves grew restless and

disillusioned with life on the mainland, they heard a mystic call

from over the waves to the west to the island of Evermeet. By

the Year of Moonfall (1344 DR), the Elven Retreat reached its

peak.  Persecuted  by  numerous  savage  races  such  as  goblinoids

and orcs, and equally put off by the invasive and often short-

sighted expansion of humans, many elves decided simply to pick

up and move. As a result, the elven presence on the mainland

fell  to  the  lowest  levels  since  the  arrival  of  the  Tel-quessir

twenty-five thousand years ago.

Recent events on Evermeetnot least of which was a destruc-

tive  attack  by  the  drowhave  convinced  the  elves  that  they

cannot just turn their backs on the world and expect to survive.

The Retreat is now over, and elves are slowly beginning to estab-

lish a stronger presence in Faern as a result. But it is clear that

the day of elven empires sprawling over thousands of miles of

forests is gone forever.

ELVES

Elf, Aquatic

Regions:  Aglarond,  Dragon  Coast,  Impiltur,  Sembia,  Vilhon

Reach, Aquatic elf.

Racial Feats: Breathing Link, Landwalker, Rapid Swimming.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Rarely encountered by the landbound races, the aquatic elves are

a  civilized  and  good-hearted  people  who  inhabit  the  seas  sur-

rounding Faern. Most aquatic elves hail from underwater cities

in the Sea of Fallen Stars or in the Great Sea south of Faern,

but small settlements of this race can be found in the seas along

Faerns western coasts as well.

The aquatic elves are tall, standing 6 feet or more in height.

They have long limbs with strong swimming muscles, and their

fingers and toes are long with thick webbing. Their most strik-

ing features are sets of gills along the collarbone and ribcage.

Aquatic  elves  are  nowhere  near  as  thin  as  their  landbound

cousins, and their hair is usually stringy and thick, cut short for

warriors but otherwise worn long. Great Sea aquatic elves have

radiant skin of deep green with irregular thin brown stripes and

patches. Aquatic elves from the Sea of Fallen Stars have skin in

many shades of blue with white patches and stripes. Eye colors

for both types of aquatic elf come in every shade seen among

gold,  moon,  or  wild  elves.  Their  clothing  is  made  of  various

undersea plants in shades of green, black, and brown, although

aquatic elves usually go about lightly clad, if dressed at all, while

underwater.

Aquatic  elves  have  the  life  expectancy  and  age  categories

defined for elves in Tables 64 and 65 of the Players Hand-

book, but use the following random height and weight charac-

teristics instead of those described on Table 66:

History

Aquatic elves first appeared in the Great Sea untold ages ago, the

last of the major elven races to migrate from the elven home-

land  into  Faern.  For  many  years,  these  elves  lived  nomadic

lives and spent much of their time exploring the waters of their

new world. The aquatic elves did not begin to settle down and

form permanent communities in the depths until the time of

the First Crown War. They knew of the Crown Wars, and often

watched the battles from the safety of the water, but kept their

interactions with their landbound kin to a minimum. Unfortu-

nately, their attempt to avoid becoming entangled in the wars

proved futile, and by the time of the Fourth Crown War, many

aquatic elves fled to the Sea of Fallen Stars to establish a new

nation sheltered from the madness of their kin.

The aquatic elves of the Sea of Fallen Stars have raised sev-

eral  distinct  realms  of  varying  size.  Major  colonies  include

Naramyr  and  SeluMaraar,  in  the  Dragonmere  and  Dragon

Reach areas respectively. There are also several outposts east of

the mouth of the Vilhon Reach and west of the Alamber, known

as the Sharksbane Wall. Another colony called Faenasuor lies on

the continental slopes east of Starmantle, and a number of small

villages can be found among the reefs off the Fang of western

Aglarond. In the Trackless Sea, a major sea elf city near Ever-

meet is called Iumathiashae (Mother of Oceans). Many addi-

tional colonies also lie off the coast of Tethyr.

Aquatic elves have fought many wars against the evil races of

the sea, especially the sahuagin, but surface-dwellers know very

little of these tales.

Outlook

Aquatic elves are viewed by many land-dwelling folk as skittish,

distrustful creatures who are afraid to leave the water. While

this is not necessarily true, an aquatic elf trusts only his close

neighbors and family, even though he shares many strong bonds

of history and culture with any land-dwelling elf acquaintance.

The aquatic elves believe that alliance and community mean

survival, while factionalism and arrogance mean death. They are

standoffish even to other aquatic races, except when it serves the

elves to have allies or trade partners. Despite this attitude, the

aquatic elves of the Sea of Fallen Stars have recently started to

overcome their natural tendencies, and have begun to open trade

with their neighbors, both aquatic and landbound.

AQUATIC ELF CHARACTERS

Aquatic elves share the seas with a number of vicious and dan-

gerous races, such as kapoacinths, sahuagin, scrags, and krakens,

and often become very capable fighters and rangers. They have

little taste for the wizards studies or the clerics devotions, but

many aquatic elves take up the path of the bard, learning eerily

beautiful songs of great power. Sorcerers are more common than

wizards  among  the  aquatic  elves.  Typical  multiclass  combina-

tions include bard/fighter, bard/sorcerer, and fighter/ranger.

Favored Class: An aquatic elfs favored class is fighter. While

aquatic  elves  have  few  organized  armies,  individual  fighting

skills are highly prized. Landbound elves may prefer stealth and

archery, but the underwater environment dictates speed and skill

in melee instead.

Aquatic Elf Society

Aquatic elves form loose feudal societies. The nobility rules in a

reasonably  enlightened  manner,  and  all  social  conventions

follow a patriarchal structure for inheritance and the transfers

of  power.  While  women  wield  considerable  influence  among

aquatic elves, particularly as bards and sorcerers, the bulk of the

political power devolves on the eldest male child.

Aquatic  elves  form  closely  knit  communities.  While  each

family or single resident often has a home to call his or her own,

private property is rare. Tools, weapons, and other miscellaneous

objects trade hands often. An aquatic elf in need of a particular

item  simply  takes  one  he  finds,  without  fear  of  repercussion.

Theft is relatively unknown in aquatic elf society as a result; one

cannot  steal  something  if  everyone  considers  the  object  com-

munity property. This attitude does not extend to nonaquatic elf

visitors, however, and such visitors are often watched to make

sure that they keep their hands to themselves.

ELVES

Language and Literacy

All aquatic elves speak Elven, written with a distinctive style

of  Espruar  characters  that  shows  Aquan  influences.  Aquatic

elves native to the Sea of Fallen Stars also speak Serusan, the

trade language of the marine peoples of the Inner Sea, while

aquatic  elves  from  the  Great  Sea  or  the  Trackless  Sea  speak

Aquan. Both of these languages use the Aquan alphabet. Those

aquatic elves who have the inclination also learn various lan-

guages  of  the  surface  world,  notably  Common,  Chondathan,

and Sylvan.

All  aquatic  elf  characters  are  liter-

ate, except for barbarians, warriors, and

commoners.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Aquatic  elves  have  all  the  elven

racial  traits  listed  in  the  Players

Handbook, except as follows:

+2  Dexterity,  2  Intelligence.

This replaces the standard bonuses

and  penalties  most  elves  receive.

Aquatic  elves  are  as  fleet  of  foot

and coordinated as their land-based

kin,  and  while  they  are  more  stur-

dily  built  than  most  of  the  other

elven  subraces,  they  have  little  use

for study.

Proficient  with  trident,  longspear,

and  net.  This  replaces  the  standard

elven  proficiency  with  longsword,

rapier, and bow.

Swim  speed  40  feet.  An  aquatic  elf

gains a +8 racial bonus on all Swim

checks  and  can  always  choose  to

take  10  with  Swim  checks,  even  if

rushed  or  threatened.  Aquatic  elves

can  use  the  run  action  while  swimming,  as

long as they swim in a straight line.

Improved Low-Light Vision (Ex): An aqua-

An aquatic elf and aquatic half-elf meet

tic elf can see four times as far as a human in starlight, moon-

light, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.

They  retain  the  ability  to  distinguish  color  and  detail  under

these conditions.

Gills (Ex): Aquatic elves breathe salt water with ease. They can

also  breathe  fresh  water,  but  most  find  the  experience  to  be

very uncomfortable and are treated as fatigued while doing so

and for 10 minutes afterward. Aquatic elves can survive out of

the  water  for  1  hour  per  point  of  Constitution  (after  that,

refer  to  the  suffocation  rule  in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide).

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Elven,  home  region.  Bonus

Languages: Aquan, Draconic, Giant.

Favored Class: Fighter.

Level Adjustment: +1. Aquatic elves are more powerful and

gain  levels  more  slowly  than  most  of  the  other  common

races  of  Faern.  See  Table  1  in  the  Introduction  for  more

information.

Aquatic Elf Magic and Lore

Of the seven elven subraces, the aquatic elves are the ones who

have embraced the art of magic the least. This is not to say that

there  are  no  spellcasters  among  their  kind,  just  that  the  pro-

portion of spellcasters to nonspellcasters in aquatic elf society

is more like that found among dwarves than humans or elves.

Nevertheless, the long life span of the aquatic elf allows him to

spend much more time perfecting his magical training than a

similar human.

SPELLS AND

SPELLCASTING

Aquatic elf wizards write scrolls

on  specially  cured  sharkskin  or

on  papyruslike  sheets  of  thick,

fibrous  seaweed.  In  either  case,

both  are  alchemically  treated

(Craft (alchemy) DC 10, cost 5

gp per scroll) to resist rotting or

damage from exposure to water.

The  inks  are  much  thicker  and

more  viscous  than  surface  inks

and  do  not  diffuse  upon  contact

with water.

AQUATIC ELF

MAGIC ITEMS

Aquatic elves have the same range

of magic items used by their sur-

face  kin,  although  they  are  by

necessity  often  altered  in  form

due to the elves underwater exis-

tence.  For  example,  the  aquatic

elves  have  developed  potions

that are closer to unguents, pastes, or

even  magic  sea  fruits  or  seaweed.  Scrolls

are  prepared  on  specially  treated  shark-

skins or sea-reed papyrus. Magic items nor-

mally crafted out of metal are made from materials that do not

corrode in salt water.

Aquatic  elves  do  not  wear  much  clothing,  so  magical  gar-

ments  are  rare,  including  armor.  Wearing  armor  tends  to

hamper an aquatic elfs ability to swim. Aquatic elves rely upon

Dexterity  and  magical  means  of  protection  in  battle,  such  as

rings of protection and amulets of natural armor.

Iconic  Item:  Aquatic  elves  patrolling  the  barrier  reefs

around  their  settlements  frequently  carry  tridents  of  serenity

(see  the  appendix).  As  long  as  such  a  trident  is  nearby,  their

hated foes, the sahuagin, will be unable to enter blood frenzy.

Aquatic Elf Deities

Although  the  aquatic  elves  acknowledge  the  Seldarine,  their

true deity is Deep Sashelas. Almost all aquatic elves venerate

the Lord of the Undersea to some extent. Temples dedicated

to Deep Sashelas can be found in all aquatic elf cities. These

29

ELVES

buildings are usually built of stone and carved to resemble gar-

gantuan shells; they serve as the spiritual, physical, and social

centers  of  many  aquatic  elven  communities.  Some  religious

aquatic elves wander the seas, floating with the currents, exult-

ing in the natural beauty of the undersea world, and spreading

the word of their lord to all they encounter.

Relations with Other Races

Aquatic elves are a cautious folk. Although there are many races

friendly to the aquatic elves, such as the merfolk and the tritons,

there are just as many menaces in the deeps. As a result, aquatic

elves remain in their cities and interact with others only when

forced to. This caution extends to surface communities, but is

often tempered with curiosity. Aquatic elves who live close to

shore  often  spend  long  hours  spying  on  their  air-breathing

neighbors. They make little distinction between the various land-

dwelling subraces of elves.

One race in particular should be mentioned in the context of

the aquatic elves: The sahuagin. Aquatic elves possess a fierce,

blinding hatred for the sea devils and often wage senseless wars

against them. The one sure way to overcome an aquatic elfs nat-

ural shyness and wariness is to offer him the chance to attack

and possibly kill some of his races hated enemies.

Aquatic Elf Equipment

Aquatic elves rarely use metal tools due to the inevitable damage

most metals suffer to saltwater corrosion. One notable exception

is gold. Many aquatic elves have mastered the art of beating gold

into beautiful jewelry, because forging metals is all but impos-

sible underwater. For the most part, their tools, weapons, and

armor are made from materials they have on hand underwater,

such as stone, coral, and shells of various sorts. Shipwrecks are

a major source of materials for aquatic elves, although they are

careful  to  honor  any  who  may  have  died  before  looting  the

sunken cargo holds.

Because of the difficulty in drinking potions underwater from

normal vials, aquatic elves use potion bladders (see the appendix)

to hold their potions.

ARMS AND ARMOR

In an underwater world, bludgeoning and slashing weapons are

nowhere  near  as  efficient  as  piercing  weapons.  Tridents  and

spears are therefore the favored weapons of the aquatic elves,

and these weapons can be found in amazing varieties and styles

throughout  the  various  undersea  communities.  Bone,  narwhal

horns, and even coral are used to build these weapons. Although

they are more fragile than regular steel weaponry, they are easy

to  construct.  Weighted  nets  are  also  a  popular  weapon  for

aquatic  elves,  who  have  perfected  methods  of  throwing  such

weapons so that they drift and unfold in the water almost like

large  octopi  or  manta  rays.  As  described  in  the  DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide, weapons made of inferior materials have a 2

attack and damage penalty (with a minimum damage of 1).

Armor is generally eschewed by aquatic elves for two rea-

sons. First, it slows their swimming speed and agility. Second,

most  metal  deteriorates  over  time  underwater.  As  a  result,

most aquatic elves simply rely on their natural quickness to

protect  them  in  combat.  Shields  crafted  from  shells  are

common, and those elves with the resources often resort to

magical means of protection such as rings of protection and

amulets of natural armor.

Unique Items: Aquatic elves living in areas that are harassed

by sahuagin or other enemies have come up with two ingenious

forms of armor that work equally well on land or underwater.

These  two  new  forms  of  armor  include  sharkskin  armor  and

chitin armor (see the appendix).

Aquatic elf weaponsmiths have also mastered the art of craft-

ing bows that can fire underwater. While they lack the range of

a surface elfs longbow, the aquatic longbow (also in the appen-

dix)  provides  aquatic  elves  with  a  potent  ranged  weapon  for

underwater combat.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Aquatic elves have a strong affinity for dolphins and porpoises,

and they usually live in the same areas as these aquatic mam-

mals. Most aquatic elf communities have several of these crea-

tures as guardians, messengers, and playful companions.

Aquatic elves also have a great and abiding respect for the

larger whales, and although the migratory habits of the great

sea  mammals  precludes  the  possibility  of  recruiting  them  as

guardians or companions, many aquatic elves build communi-

ties  along  established  migration  routes  so  that  twice  yearly

they receive visits from the stately creatures. A young aquatic

elf often leaves home for a year just to accompany a pod of

migrating whales.

Some aquatic elf communities have been known to train and

keep sea lions as guardians as well, especially in dangerous areas.

Sharks  are  universally  hated  by  aquatic  elves.  Many  think  of

these creatures as unnatural monsters tainted with perversion by

their enemies, the sahuagin.

Aquatic Elf Region

Aquatic  elves  are  isolationists,  and  as  a  result  most  of  them

simply take the Aquatic Elf region, which is detailed below. An

aquatic elf occasionally has enough contact with a region bor-

dering his homeland to select a surface realm as his home region.

Preferred Classes: Bard, fighter, ranger, sorcerer. A character

of one of these classes may choose a regional feat and gain his

choice of the bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character.

An aquatic elf character of any other class may not select one

of the regional feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment

at 1st level.

Automatic  Languages: Common,  Elven,  and  Aquan  (Great

Sea) or Serusan (Inner Sea).

Bonus  Languages: Aquan,  Chondathan,  Draconic,  Giant,

Serusan, Sylvan.

Regional Feats: Blooded, Landwalker, Survivor.

Bonus  Equipment:  (A)  trident*  or  longspear*,  or  (B)  chitin

armor and small wooden shield*, or (C) 3 100 gp pearls.

ELVES

Avariel

(Winged Elf)

Regions: Most avariel choose the Avariel region, but other valid

regions include Damara, the High Forest, Narfell, the North,

Silverymoon, the Vast, and the Western Heartlands.

Racial  Feats:  Flyby  Attack  (see  Monster  Manual),  Hover  (see

Monster Manual), Improved Flight, Rapid Flight.

Racial Prestige Class: Bladesinger.

Level Adjustment: +3.

The avariels, or winged elves, are without a doubt the most reclu-

sive and least numerous of the elven subraces on Faern. Many

scholars have long dismissed them as creatures of myth. In truth,

small  numbers  of  avariels  still  dwell  in  Faern,  concealed  in

hidden enclaves and remote regions.

The most striking feature of the avariels is their soft, feath-

ered wings. These wings have spans of anywhere from twelve to

sixteen feet and are usually white, but may also be gray, brown,

black,  or  speckled.  Avariels  take  great  pride  in  their  wings  and

spend long hours grooming them. Their skin is pale, often porce-

lain white, with tinges of blue or faint silver. They have silver-

white or black hair, with other shades being rare but not unheard

of. The avariels eyes are rather large and more expressive than

those of other elves, and they tend to be brilliant shades of blue

or green. A few avariel have scintillating violet eyes as pure as

amethysts. Avariels stand 5'9" tall on average, with thin, grace-

ful limbs and angular facial features. They are the most beauti-

ful and striking of the elven races, although too often this beauty

is  marred  by  haughtiness  and  condescension  toward  their  land-

bound kin, whom they often pity.

Avariels are even more delicate than other elves, and their

movements are quick, calculated, and graceful. They prefer to

wear loose fitting, diaphanous clothing that catches the wind

in  flight  and  ripples  and  weaves  in  the  air.  Armor  is  almost

never  worn,  because  it  tends  to  weigh  the  avariels  down  and

hinder their graceful motion. Avariels cannot fly while wear-

ing heavy armor.

Avariels age more quickly than most elves, having the starting

age  and  life  expectancy  defined  for  gnomes  in  Tables  64  and

65  of  the  Players  Handbook.  Avariels  use  the  following

random  height  and  weight  characteristics  instead  of  those

described on Table 66:

History

Along with the green elves and lythari, the avariels are one of

the  three  oldest  elven  races.  Today,  though,  they  are  all  but

extinct, forced into the far corners of the world ages ago by the

ancient dragons and hunted mercilessly by evil folk.

The  avariels,  upon  first  migrating  to  Faern  millennia  ago,

found  the  world  to  be  a  vast,  beautiful  place.  Unfortunately,

vicious dragons ruled the skies above ancient Faern. The newly

arrived avariels were nearly wiped out by the dragons before the

First Flowering. The last of their race flew eastward long before

31

the first Crown War, wandering the skies only when they had to,

hiding on the ground like vermin and living terrible, dirty lives

as nomads and scavengers.

The last redoubt of the avariels today is known as the Aerie of

the Snow Eagles, a crystal citadel hidden atop one of the most

remote  peaks  in  the  Icerim  Mountains  of  distant  Sossal.  The

exact  location  of  the  Aerie  of  the  Snow  Eagles  is  one  of  the

avariels most closely guarded secrets.

The aerie itself resembles a tremendous castle or tower of

glass, built on a sheared-off mountaintop. A flight of avariel

nomads discovered it abandoned ages ago. The avariels believe

that the original mountaintop was taken by a Netherese arch-

mage who wished to use it to build a floating city. The pres-

ent-day aerie is a wonder to behold. The walls of the glass aerie

are  magically  hardened  to  the  strength  of  steel.  Inside,  the

Aerie  of  the  Snow  Eagles  supports  a  tropical  climate,  com-

plete with jungles of plants and trees long extinct elsewhere

in Faern.

For two centuries, this last lair of the avariels has been led by

Winged Father Aquilan Greatspan (CG male avariel Ftr4/Clr12/

Dis5/Hie1). The avariels fly there still, fishing in the freezing

waters of the Great Ice Sea and hunting the icy reaches of the

Great Glacier.

Outlook

Avariels  came  dangerously  close  to  extinction  long  ago,  and  it

has taken them thousands of years to recover to the point where

they  dont  have  to  worry  about  the  fate  of  their  race.  Only

recently have they begun to expand back into the world, sending

explorers,  diplomats,  and  merchants  south  into  Faern  proper.

Small, scattered bands of avariels still exist in the heartlands of

Faern, but these groups rarely number more than a dozen and

usually avoid civilized areas.

Avariels are free spirits who would like nothing better than to

simply soar on the currents high above the ground, taking in the

views Faern has to offer. They possess an irrepressible zest for

life.  Even  in  the  darkest,  most  desperate  situation,  an  avariel

remains  cheerful.  Unfortunately,  while  friendly  to  those  they

consider their equals, avariels also tend to be condescending and

even downright rude to landbound races. The avariels are usually

unaware of this; its just their natural reaction to treat landbound

races  as  lesser  creatures.  Given  time  and  enough  exposure  to

other cultures, avariels can overcome their natural bias.

AVARIEL CHARACTERS

Winged elves combine a tradition of vigilance and skill at arms

with  a  joyous  reverence  for  the  sheer  peaks  and  open  skies  of

their  homelands.  Many  become  fighters,  rangers,  or  clerics.

Avariel  civilization  is  old  and  established,  so  avariel  barbarians

are unheard of. Winged elves lean toward the divine rather than

the arcane, but a small number take up the study of wizardry and

generally  excel  at  it.  Common  multiclass  combinations  include

fighter/cleric, cleric/ranger, and cleric/wizard.

Favored Class: The favored class of the avariels is cleric. While

many  avariels  are  drawn  to  the  study  of  combat  and  skill  at

arms, the hearts of the winged elves favor a more contemplative

and  philosophical  existence.  Even  those  who  spend  their  lives

studying the martial path often set aside these pursuits in order

to return to a holier calling.

ELVES

Prestige  Classes:  Some  avariels  practice  the  art  of  the  blade-

song and use it to protect their communities. Like other kinds of

elves, winged elves greatly respect the skill needed to become a

bladesinger. Avariel wizards often aspire to become arcane devo-

tees or loremasters, while avariels of all other classes are drawn

to the divine champion and divine disciple prestige classes.

Avariel Society

The avariels have a unique model for their societies, separating

into two groups when they congregate in large numbers: a war-

like  society  of  fighters  and  soldiers,  and  a  peaceful  society  of

thinkers and religious scholars. These two subcultures, as diamet-

rically  opposed  as  their  separate  philosophies  may  be,  work

together to forge a powerful symbiotic relationship.

Warlike avariels have a complex code of honor that they use

to  guide  and  temper  their  militaristic  activities  and  training.

These avariels spend their lives defending their kin. Their lives

are geared toward war and power, and they answer to their war

chiefs,  who  share  responsibility  for  ruling  the  society  with  the

religious leaders of the peaceful avariels. The martial avariels are

proud and hearty, and they form eternal friendships with those

who earn their respect and trust.

In combat, warlike avariels have little pity or remorse about

cutting  down  their  enemies.  The  concept  of  surrendering  is

highly  dishonorable  to  these  avariels,  both  for  themselves  and

for their enemies. Once lethal combat begins, few avariels break

off until they or their enemies are dead. Drawing blood from an

enemy is nothing less than a promise to honor the enemy with

ones skills in combat and not humiliate him by leaving him alive

to dwell on an embarrassing defeat. The act of slaying an enemy

is viewed simply as delivering on that promise.

Warlike  avariels  prefer  to  use  ranged  weapons,  and  they

arent above using wings to gain an advantage over landbound

enemies. This is supported by their code, which allows them to

cut  down  an  enemy  from  an  unassailable  distance  in  the  skies

above.  Those  who  cannot  defend  themselves  against  an  attack

from the skies should know better than to make an enemy of a

clearly superior foe.

The peaceful avariels, unlike their warlike kin, focus mainly

on  arts  and  the  intellectual  aspects  of  life.  When  faced  with

conflict, a peaceful avariel relies on her brains and diplomatic

abilitiesand  often  on  her  magic  power.  Peaceful  avariels  are

artists, philosophers, and researchers who spend their lives study-

ing the world and its history and creating works of art simply

for  the  sheer  joy  of  creation.  The  peaceful  avariels  are  also

responsible for providing their society with food, entertainment,

and  education.  Many  peaceful  avariels  are  also  very  religious

and spend much of their time contemplating the ways of their

deity, Aerdrie Faenya.

Despite  their  divergent  personalities,  these  two  subcultures

interact surprisingly well. Young avariels typically spend time

immersed in each subculture, learning from both warriors and

priests. These exchanges, which often last for a decade or longer,

allow avariels raised in one subculture to learn how the other

subculture lives.

Language and Literacy

All avariels can speak Elven and Common, and each learns an

additional  language  based  on  his  or  her  native  region.  Most

winged elves are intelligent enough to pick up at least one addi-

tional  language.  This  additional  language  is  usually  Auran,  so

the avariels can speak with allied creatures of the air such as the

giant eagles they adore. Additional languages often learned by

avariels  include  Goblin,  Orc,  Sylvan,  and  the  predominant

human  language(s)  of  their  home  region.  Avariels  also  often

learn the Draconic and Giant languages so that they can con-

verse with their hated enemies if the need arises.

All  avariels  are  literate,  except  for  avariel  barbarians

(assuming they exist).

Abilities and

Racial Features

Avariels  have  all  the  elven  racial  traits  listed  in  the  Players

Handbook, except as follows:

+4  Dexterity,  2  Constitution,  +2  Intelligence,  +2  Wisdom.

Avariels have hollow bones and, as a result, are more fragile

than humans. At the same time, they are gifted with a keen

intuition and intellect, and an almost otherworldly grace.

Keen Sight (Ex): Avariels gain a +4 racial bonus on all Spot

checks;  this  replaces  the  standard  +2  racial  bonus  that  most

elves gain.

Avariels  gain  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Jump  checks.  They  are

strong for their weight.

Proficient  with  either  rapier  or  longsword;  proficient  with

lasso and bolas. This replaces the standard elven weapon profi-

ciency with longswords or rapiers and proficiency with short-

bow, longbow, composite longbow, and composite shortbows.

Flight (Ex): Avariels have a flying speed of 50 feet with aver-

age maneuverability, as long as they do not carry more than a

Medium  load,  are  not  wearing  Heavy  armor,  and  are  not

fatigued or exhausted. Avariel wings have a span of 12 feet on

average; they cannot fly in an area that does not allow them

to fully extend their wings.

An avariel may make a dive attack. A dive attack works just

like a charge, but the avariel must descend a minimum of 30

feet and attack with a piercing weapon; if she hits, she deals

double damage. An avariel can use the run action while flying,

provided she flies in a straight line. For more information on

flight, see the Tactical Aerial Movement section in Chapter 3

of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Avariel Magic and Lore

Although  the  warlike  subculture  of  avariel  society  appreciates

magic and respects its power, members of the peaceful subculture

are  the  true  masters  of  divine  and  arcane  magic.  The  avariels,

like  most  other  elven  races,  have  wholly  and  completely

embraced the art of both divine and arcane magic. Unlike most

other  races,  though,  the  avariels  have  only  recently  (in  elven

terms) become re-established on Faern. For most of their his-

tory, the avariels simply havent had the luxury of experiment-

ing  and  toying  with  magic;  they  were  too  focused  on  simply

surviving. But with their discovery and colonization of the Aerie

32

ELVES

of the Snow Eagles they have, for the past 500 years, felt safe

enough to begin researching magic once again.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Avariels  favor  conjuration  and  transmutation  magic  for  their

versatility, and the miniature jungle world within the Aerie of

the Snow Eagles is the culmination of their most potent conjur-

ings  and  transmutations.  Avariels

have  also  been  focusing  more  on

divination  spells  of  late,  as  they

seek  out  their  lostand  well-

hiddenbrethren.

AVARIEL MAGIC ITEMS

The  avariels  are  commonly  thought

to  be  the  originators  of  wings  of

flying. Ancient rumors hold that pow-

erful and compassionate avariel spellcast-

ers invented the first wings of flying as gifts

for  landbound  friends  so  that  they  too

could know  the bliss and rapture of

soaring  the  skies  above

Faern. It stands to reason

that  winged  boots  may  have

also  been  introduced  into  the

world by generous avariels as well.

Avariel Deities

Like  the  aquatic  elves,  the  avariels  acknowledge

the Seldarine as a whole and pay lip service to most

of these elven deities, but they hold a special rever-

ence for a single member of that pantheonin their

case  Aerdrie  Faenya,  the  elven  goddess  of  the  skies,

weather, and avians of all sorts. Although they do not

elevate their religious beliefs to the level of fanaticism,

the  avariels  as  a  whole  are  deeply  religious,  and  the

thought of not venerating a deity is alien and unwhole-

some to most of them.

Avariels  believe  that  it  is  due  to  Aerdrie  Faenyas

intervention  that  they  are  able  to  survive  at  all.  Ages

ago, Aerdrie Faenya gifted the avariels with their wings

because she knew that they would face great trials and danger in

the future and would need the advantage of flight if they were

to have any hope of survival. Avariels also believe that she takes

more of a direct hand in their lives than do the gods of the other

elves. Avariels often attribute to Aerdrie Faenyas intervention

events  that  most  other  races  would  view  as  simply  fortuitous

coincidences.

Relations with Other Races

The avariels are on good terms with other sentient, good-aligned

avian  races.  They  admire  and  respect  giant  eagles,  a  bond  that

survived the dark centuries of draconic persecution. The avariels

are also fond of the aarakocras, but since the winged elves were

driven from the Star Mounts, their interaction with these bird-

men has dropped off significantly. They get along well with air

Aerie of the Snow Eagles

33

ELVES

genasi  as  well,  although  they  are  often  frustrated  with  the

genasis ambivalence and disinterest in good and evil.

Avariel relations with landbound races are not nearly as pro-

ductive. The avariels have traditionally viewed those who cant

fly  as  objects  of  pity  (at  best)  or  derision  (more  commonly).

Recently,  the  avariels  have  begun  to  realize  the  error  of  their

waysthe  landlocked  races,  despite  their  lack  of  wings,  can  be

powerful and helpful allies. Avariels from the Aerie of the Snow

Eagles  have  recently  sent  diplomats  to  neighboring  kingdoms

(Narfell, Rashemen, Damara, and the Great Dale in particular)

and have been doing their best to treat the ground races as equals.

The avariels are still hunted to this day by evil dragons, who

view the winged elves and their magical aptitude as the greatest

threat to their dominion over the skies of Faern. Dragons have

nowhere near the presence in the skies as they did in the ancient

past, but their memories are long. In particular, the white drag-

ons of Hoarfaern are particularly dedicated to the final destruc-

tion of the avariels and the Aerie of the Snow Eagles.

Avariel Equipment

The avariels have taken the craft of glassblowing and elevated it

to an art form. When most races turn to metal, wood, or stone

to craft gear, the avariels have turned to the fragile and delicate

medium of glass. In a way, their affinity for glass as a medium

reflects their very nature, for the avariels themselves are fragile

and beautiful people.

While much avariel glass is delicate and decorative, the winged

elves have also mastered glassteel (see the appendix), a form of

glass  as  strong  as  metal.  Many  avariel  outposts  are  made  of

glassteel, as are some armor, weapons, and tools.

ARMS AND ARMOR

The  avariels  prefer  to  fight  with  ranged  weapons  and  usually

carry bows of some sort when they are away from the Aerie. The

avariels sometimes prefer ranged weapons that incapacitate their

victims. As a result, the winged elves train with lassos and bolas

extensively. When forced into melee combat, avariels use swords

almost exclusively, with a marked preference for longswords (for

stronger  avariels)  or  rapiers  (for  more  dexterous  avariels).

Avariels prefer lighter armors that do not restrict their ability

to fly, so mithral armor is especially valued.

ANIMALS AND PETS

The avariels have long had a close bond with the giant eagles of

Faern, and they settle in the same areas. Giant eagles are intel-

ligent creatures and are considered allies, not pets. Avariels are

naturally fond of any nonevil avian creature, particularly birds;

most avariels keep a few birds as companions or pets. Pet birds

are  never  caged,  though,  and  can  come  and  go  as  they  please.

Cages dont sit well with the avariels.

Avariels  sometimes  employ  arrowhawks,  griffons,  and  hip-

pogriffs as guards for their aeries. They adore rocs and think of

them as magnificent beasts touched by Aerdrie Faenya. Rocs are

admired  from  afar,  however,  as  such  massive  creatures  dont

easily fit in avariel cities.

Avariel Region

Small  numbers  of  avariels  live  with  their  elven  kin  in  various

refuges across the northern portions of Faern, but this region

describes  a  character  native  to  the  Aerie  of  the  Snow  Eagles,

north of Rashemen.

Of the various elven subraces, none are more notorious than the

drow.  Descended  from  the  original  dark-skinned  elven  subrace

called the Ssri-tel-quessir, the drow were cursed into their present

appearance  by  the  good  elven  deities  for  following  the  goddess

Lolth down the path to evil and corruption.

Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles

polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They com-

monly have blood-red eyes, although pale eyes (so pale as to be

often mistaken for white) in shades of pale lilac, silver, pink, and

blue are not unknown. They also tend to be smaller and thinner

than  most  Faernian  elves.  Most  drow  on  the  surface  are  evil

and worship Vhaeraun, but some outcasts and renegades have a

more neutral attitude, and there are even groups of good drow

who  worship  Eilistraee  or  other  deities  not  of  the  traditional

drow pantheon.

Though  divided  by  endless  feuds  and  schisms,  the  drow  are

united in one terrible desire: they seethe with a hatred for the

surface elves. By their way of reckoning, they proved themselves

the superior race in the Fourth Crown War, and the fact that

the  Seldarine  (and  Corellon  in  particular)  punished  them  for

their success is a poison that churns in their hearts and minds

eternally. They burn with hatred for the Seldarine and their cod-

dled children, and want nothing more than to return to the sur-

face  and  bring  to  the  elves  there  suffering  a  thousand  times

greater  than  that  which  the  drow  have  been  forced  to  endure

over the past ten thousand years.

Drow have the life expectancy, age categories, and height and

weight characteristics defined for elves in Tables 64, 65, and

66 of the Players Handbook.

ELVES

History

In  the  beginning,  the  Ssri-tel-quessir  were  the  most  successful

of the elven colonists to the new world of Faern. The nation

of  Ilythiir  quickly  became  one  of  the  most  powerful  of  the

early  elven  nations.  But  the  Ssri-tel-quessir  were  not  only  the

most  successful  of  the  elves  of  their  time,  they  were  also  the

most  cruel  and  jealous.  Despite  their  own  accomplishments,

they  envied  those  of  their  neighbors  all  the  same.  While  the

First Crown War raged to the north, the dark elves waged their

own war against their neighbors, seeking to dominate the elven

realms of southern Faern.

Unsuccessful  in  three  attempts  to  subjugate  the  neighboring

realms,  the  dark  elves  of  Ilythiir  turned  to  a  new  and  secret

patron at the opening of the Fourth Crown War. The dark elves

pledged their loyalties to the outcast Seldarine of the Demonweb

Pits, and to Lolth in particular. The Spider Queen and her fellow

exiles (with the notable exception of Eilistraee) granted the dark

elves of Ilythiir great magical powers, fiendish allies, and support

in  return  for  their  allegiance,  and  the  Ilythiiri  wreaked  great

havoc among the other elven realms.

But their success and victory were short-lived, for Corellon was

shocked  and  deeply  enraged  by  the  traitorous  acts  of  the  dark

elves. By his decree, the Ilythiiri elves were cursed, transformed

into drow and banished from the surface world into the Under-

dark. They became known as the dhaeraow (the elven word for

traitor), and over the centuries this word has since given them

the name by which they are known: drow.

After their exile below ground, the drow lived as nomads, scav-

engers,  and  feral  beasts.  Eventually,  through  the  guidance  of

Lolth,  they  drew  themselves  together  as  a  race  and  began  to

make the best of their situation, colonizing large portions of the

Underdark. The first underground drow civilizations were estab-

lished in southern Faern around 9600 DR. In 9000 DR, the

drow  seized  the  great  cavern  of  Bhaerynden  from  the  gold

dwarves  and  established  the  first  great  drow  kingdom,  Telanti-

war. Unfortunately, the drow of Telantiwar quickly fell into ter-

rible civil wars, the eventual result of which were several massive

magical explosions that collapsed the caverns of their nation and

formed the Great Rift in southern Faern.

The few drow survivors of this cataclysm scattered through-

out  the  Underdark,  slowly  settling  regions  farther  and  farther

away from their original homelands in the South. In time, the

drow  built  dozens  of  magnificent,  terrifying  cities  deep  under-

ground, quite an achievement for a people so predisposed toward

treachery, infighting, and civil war. Sshamath, the City of Dark

Weavings,  was  founded  beneath  the  Far  Hills  in  4973  DR.

Menzoberra the Kinless, a high priestess of Lolth, established the

city  of  Menzoberranzan  in  3917  DR.  House  Nasadra,  exiled

from  Menzoberranzan,  founded  Ched  Nasad  in  3843  DR.

Many other cities lie beneath other parts of Faern, sometimes

exerting their baleful influence on the lands above, such as the

conquest  of  the  human  realm  of  Dambrath  by  the  drow  of

Tlindhet in 804 DR, or the centuries-long rule of Maerimydra

over Shadowdale hundreds of years ago.

Recently, the drow have begun to extend their influence to

the surface in greater numbers than ever before, moving into

abandoned  elven  cities  and  homes.  They  have  begun  training

and conditioning to allow them to function in the brilliant sur-

face world. Much to their surprise and delight, they have found

that due to the Elven Retreat the presence of surface elves is

much smaller and more poorly organized than they anticipated.

Small bands of drow opposed to this return to the surface have

made efforts to alert the surface world of this new threat, but

so far no organized resistance to the drow invasion of the sur-

face world has appeared.

Outlook

Drow  are,  on  the  whole,  sadistic,  destructive,  and  treacherous.

They  view  themselves  as  the  rightful  heirs  to  Faern  and  still

remember the perceived injustice of their exile to the Underdark.

They hate other races and either wish to make war upon them or

view those others with contempt and tolerate them only as nec-

essary  for  trade  or  temporary  military  alliances.  Even  among

their own kind, drow are cruel and suspicious. There is little room

for love and friendship in drow society. They may value alliances

with other family members or acquaintances, but no drow truly

trusts  another.  Drow  forge  alliances  only  when  they  are  more

powerful than an ally, possess blackmail-worthy knowledge, or

have a common enemy that overrides their mutual hatred. Even

then, they keep their eyes and ears primed for the slightest hint

of  treachery.  The  motto  for  the  drow  may  well  be,  Do  unto

others first so they cannot do unto you.

Of  course,  there  are  always  exceptions  to  the  rule.  A  fair

number of drow have come to value their position in the Under-

dark and now think of themselves as true natives of their dark

realm. They have little desire to return to the surface and would

rather rule in the depths than struggle to regain a realm they no

longer hold any interest in ruling. Even more rare are those few

drow who have atoned for their evil ways and think of their fel-

lows as monsters that need to be stopped. These drow are either

surface dwellers who are struggling to become accepted into new

societies,  or  fugitives  dwelling  in  out-of-the-way  caverns  deep

underground.  With  the  new  expansion  into  the  surface,  more

drow than ever before are being exposed to the truth on the sur-

face,  and  many  are  realizing  that  life  on  the  surface  is  much

nicer than they were led to believe by the agents of Lolth and

her  kin.  It  is  possible,  with  proper  acceptance  and  encourage-

ment, that the numbers of neutral or even good drow on the sur-

face  of  Faern  could  skyrocket  in  the  coming  years.  The

priesthood  of  Eilistraee  is  in  the  forefront  of  this  movement,

desperately trying to divert the drow war on the surface into a

mass conversion from the dark elves dreadful ways.

DROW CHARACTERS

The  dark  elves  are  renowned  for  their  skill  as  clerics,  fighters,

rogues,  and  wizards.  While  many  drow  are  naturally  gifted

enough  to  excel  in  almost  any  career  to  which  they  turn  their

attention,  their  society  has  long  rewarded  skill  at  arms,  divine

power (primarily in the hands of female clerics of Lolth), and

arcane might (primarily in the hands of male wizards). Likewise,

all drow have a deep-seated admiration for stealth, guile, and the

unexpected blade in the dark. Dark elves are well-suited to make

good bards, but few follow this path; the bards exuberance does

not fit well in drow society, although all drow can admire a work

of skill. Drow rangers are valuable, too, serving as scouts who can

roam the tunnels of the Underdark, seeking out threats to the

great cities of the dark elves. Drow do not often multiclass, as

their society tends to reward specialization in the expected roles

and skills.

35

ELVES

Favored Class: Centuries of tradition and social pressure have

resulted in a schism between male and female drow in regards to

their favored class. Female drow are favored by society as clerics,

because the Spider Queen favors clerics of her own gender. As a

result, a female drows favored class is cleric. There is no similar

favoritism for male drow, who have the standard elven favored

class of wizard.

Prestige Classes: The most common prestige class among the

drow is without a doubt the assassin. Many drow cities have pres-

tigious and infamous academies that train prospective youths in

various philosophies of death, and these assassins guilds have pro-

duced  some  of  the  deadliest  and  most  successful  killers  in  the

Underdark. Blackguards are also common among the drow, as are

other divine prestige classes such as the divine champion, divine

disciple, and divine seeker. Any drow who wishes to thrive within

drow culture does well to tie himself or herself to Lolths faith.

Drow Society

Drow  live  in  militaristic  societies  with  strong  religious  founda-

tions. They are a matriarchal society, ruled by the most powerful

drow  priestesses.  Drow  do  not  form  nations,  but  congregate  in

vastly  powerful  city-states  located  in  massive  caverns  deep

underground.  Drow  cities  trade  with  each  other  but  frequently

fall into open warfare.

A typical drow city is ruled by a large group of powerful drow

families, the strongest of which rule the city itself. Each family

is  in  turn  ruled  by  a  Matron  Mother,  typically  (though  not

always) a powerful cleric of Lolth. Infighting is common, even

expected,  among  the  ruling  families  of  a  drow  city.  The  power

ranking of the families shifts almost daily, although the top five

or ten families are relatively stable.

Drow  cities  tend  toward  a  haphazard  organization,  as  the

strong families seize the best territory for themselves and leave

the common drow to build their warrens and feed themselves in

whatever  fashion  they  can  manage.  The  various  family  estates

are often grouped close together in the most defensible part of

the  cavern,  but  this  is  not  always  the  case.  Typically,  a  large

public  temple  dedicated  to  Lolth  is  located  in  the  same  area,

often as part of the ruling familys estate. The city itself is usu-

ally a tangled, chaotic mess of hundreds of architectural styles.

Magic  items  emitting  faerie  fire adorn  the  more  prosperous

buildings, as well as most of the family estates. For the most part,

poverty, oppression, and desperation are the rule in the heart of

a drow city.

Beyond the city proper are vast farms where slaves raise deep

roth, edible fungus, and other necessities for the survival of the

city. Garrisons of the citys standing army (segregated by gender)

are located nearby, along with academies that cater to wizards,

bards, rogues, assassins, and experts of various fields (even psions

and psychic warriors, if you use psionics in your game). Often, a

drow  city  enters  an  alliance  with  a  powerful  denizen  of  the

Underdark such as a beholder or a deep dragon, encouraging the

creature  to  keep  a  lair  on  the  outskirts  of  the  city.  Menzober-

ranzan,  home  city  of  the  famed  exile  Drizzt  DoUrden,  is  the

most famous drow city-state and serves as an excellent example

of how such locations are structured.

Surface drow have yet to form anything resembling a soci-

ety of their own. For the most part, surface drow live as out-

casts and hermits, interacting with established societies only

when necessary.

Language and Literacy

Most drow speak Elven, Undercommon, and a language appro-

priate  to  their  native  region.  Those  with  the  time  or  inclina-

tion,  particularly  warriors,  learn  Drow  Sign  Language  (see

below)  or  languages  commonly  spoken  by  beings  that  settle

nearby,  including  Abyssal,  Common,  Draconic,  and  Goblin.

Drow also learn common languages spoken on the surface near

the entrances to their particular corner of the Underdark, such

as the Illuskan language.

Drow have developed a unique sign language, Drow Sign Lan-

guage, which allows silent communication with hand gestures up

to 120 feet away as long as both parties can see each other. Drow

Sign Language has no alphabet or written form.

All drow characters are literate except for barbarians.

Drow Magic and Lore

The drow have developed an astounding number of unique (and

often  disturbing)  spells;  many  of  these  have  since  filtered  up

through the Underdark and have become well known even on the

surface world. Drow have a particular affinity for levitate spells

and effects, and often build structures and defenses that require

levitate (or some other form of flight) to get from one level to

another. Many important or influential drow own a drow house

insignia (detailed  in  the  Magic  Items  section  of  the  Appendix)

that allows the use of levitate.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Drow have an affinity for magical glyphs and runes, and have

long warded their homes with potent magics woven into various

sigils  and  runes  placed  where  they  can  ward  against  intrusion.

These glyphs are similar to those created by the glyph of ward-

ing or greater glyph of warding spells, except that they remain in

place even after discharging power. Drow glyphs fall into one of

three  categories,  way-marker  runes (used  in  areas  patrolled  or

traveled by drow but not inhabited by them), sacred glyphs (spe-

cial glyphs placed by clerics of Lolth to protect areas sacred to

the Spider Queen), and house defense glyphs (specialized glyphs

developed  by  members  of  noble  houses  to  protect  their  homes

and families). These runes are placed by drow clerics who have

become  runecasters  and  often  contain  unique  spells  that  have

been researched specifically for a particular rune or location.

DROW MAGIC ITEMS

Drow are particularly fond of magic weapons and armor, and all

drow in service to a powerful drow city or family can expect their

arms and armor to have at least some minor magical enhance-

ments. Drow are likely to carry drow house insignias, piwafwis

(cloaks of elvenkind), and greater piwafwis. Because they are self-

ish and paranoid, drow sometimes craft their magic items so they

can only be used by drow, which keeps the items out of the hands

of their enemiesat least those that arent also drow.

Drow Deities

The drow worship a pantheon of deities known as the Dark Sel-

darine. These deities were cast out of the Seldarine ages ago and

36

ELVES

exiled to the Demonweb Pits. They are led by Lolth, the Spider

Queen, and it is she whom the vast majority of drow worship. The

second most popular drow deity is Vhaeraun, worshiped by most

of  the  surface-dwelling  drow.  The  other  drow  deities  remain

minor in the grand scheme of things, either too absorbed in their

own interests to increase their worshipers (such as Ghaunadaur),

or too afraid or comfortable as Lolths servants to make a move

for more power (such as Kiaransalee and Selvetarm). A notable

exception is Eilistraee, the solitary good-aligned deity in the drow

pantheon.  As  more  and  more  drow  turn  to  the  surface  in  an

attempt to expand their domains, an increasing number are being

converted away from their evil ways by the church of Eilistraee,

which of late has significantly stepped up its efforts to save the

drow from their destructive ways.

purple worms, and especially spiders, are other common sources

for poison.

Unique Item: Drow knockout poison (described in the appendix).

ARMS AND ARMOR

Drow prefer to fight with weapons that take advantage of their

Dexterity, so rapiers are a favorite implement of the dark elves.

Most drow are also well versed with the hand crossbow and use

this weapon to deliver potent knockout poison with stealth and

precision. They wear mithral chainmail or mithral chain shirts

when they can afford it, but the drow eschew most other armors

that hamper their agility or speed.

Relations with

Other Races

The drow do not interact well with the

various other sentient races of Faern.

At best, the drow think of other races

as merely laughable or contemptible.

They hold low opinions even of their

erstwhile  allies,  such  as  the  kuo-toa.

Against  most  other  races,  the  only  way

the  drow  know  to  react  is  with  hatred

and  outright  war.  They  have  built  up

powerful  city-states  based  on  the

notion that the path to power lies in

the  subjugation  of  lesser  races  and

the eradication of those who pose a

threat to their homes.

Prisoners  captured  in  drow

raids  and  battles  are  usually

brought  back  to  the  cities  to

serve  out  the  remainder  of

their  lives  as  slaves.  Orcs,

hobgoblins, ogres, and other

savage humanoids are com-

mon slaves. Most drow house-

holds have two to three such slaves

for every drow in the house. The breeding

and  selling  of  slaves  is  a  thriving  business  in  drow

cities, because these hapless thralls perform all menial

and unskilled labor in a drow city.

Drow versus moon elf

ANIMALS AND PETS

Drow  do  not  keep  animals  as  pets;  they

prefer pets that can fully comprehend the

scope  of  their  reliance  and  dependence

on their masters. Accordingly, many

drow keep a favored slave as a per-

sonal servant or thrall. These min-

ions are, in truth, little more than

pets  for  the  drow,  and  they  are

generally treated as such.

The  pets  that  most  visitors

to a drow city remember are the

spiders.  These  vermin  are  the

favored of Lolth, and because

her  church  rules  most  drow

cities, it is only natural that

spiders  would  be  common

in  drow  lands.  Smaller

monstrous  spiders  are

often  kept  as  pets  or

simply  let  loose  to  wan-

der the streets, serving as

pest  control.  Larger  spi-

ders are often kept as guardians or

even mounts in some cases. Training

unintelligent vermin to do anything

is exceedingly difficult, so many drow

cities have bred specialized types of spi-

ders to serve them. The sword spider is said to be one

of the most successful of these.

The true focus of drow hatred, though, is reserved for the sur-

face elves. They act quickly and cruelly to seize any chance to

bring pain, suffering, and death to other elves they encounter.

Even the few evil surface elves are seen as enemies. Drow some-

times enter into truces with other races or individuals if doing

so helps them to realize their sinister goals, but these truces are

by  their  nature  temporary  affairs.  Its  only  a  matter  of  time

until the drow turn on their allies.

Drow Equipment

Drow  often  make  use  of  poisoned  weapons.  Their  favorite  is  a

powerful knockout toxin used to capture live prisoners. Drow poi-

sonmakers extract this toxin from a slippery, black fungus that

grows like great slicks of oil in certain Underdark caverns. Vari-

ous  natural  predators  of  the  underground,  such  as  scorpions,

The drow also use of various breeds of subterranean lizards.

They have bred species with sticky pads on their feet for use as

pack animals and mounts. Drow sometimes use bats of all sizes

and breeds as scouts or alarms. Various molds, fungi (especially

shriekers), and oozes see common use in drow traps or sanitation

areas. More rarely, drow train cavvekans (see the appendix) as

pets or guards.

Finally, the drow often bring in dangerous outsiders from the

Demonweb  Pits  to  serve  as  guardians  or  minions.  Myrlochar

(described in Monsters of Faern), bebiliths, and retrievers are

the most common due to their spiderlike appearances.

Surface Drow Region

Many  drow  have  begun  to  train  and  acclimate  themselves  for

life on the surface. The surface drow region reflects a drow from

The most common of the elven subraces on Faern are the moon

elves. They have fair skin, sometimes tinged with blue, and hair

of  silver-white,  black,  or  blue;  humanlike  colors  are  somewhat

rare. Their eyes are blue or green, with gold flecks. As far as the

elves of Faern go, moon elves are most like the elves presented

in the Players Handbook.

Moon elves prefer to dress in rustic clothes of simple cuts and

fashions that are nevertheless of fine and exquisite make. They

adorn their dress with embroidered patterns, beads, and similar

trappings, preferring earthen colors for everyday wear, hues that

make it easy to conceal themselves in foliage. In places of safety

or in times of revelry, moon elves enjoy dressing in bold colors

the more brightly colored, the better. Hair is worn in braids or

ponytails,  twined  with  wires  or  beads.  Moon  elves  sometimes

wear body paint or tattoos in mystic patterns, although not to

extent the wild elves do.

Moon  elves  have  the  life  expectancy  and  age  categories

defined for elves in Tables 64 and 65 of the Players Hand-

book, but use the following random height and weight character-

istics instead of those described on Table 66:

History

Although the moon elves were not the first elves to migrate to

Faern,  they  comprised  the  largest  migration.  Even  in  the

ancient past their joy for travel seems to have been present, for

they came to Faern in great numbers indeed. The moon elves

wanted to explore this new world rather than settle down, and so

did not establish nations of their own for some time, preferring

to settle in other elven nations, such as Othreier and Keltormir.

The only one of the ancient elven nations that the moon elves

could  truly  call  their  own  was  Orishaar,  which  was  defeated  in

11,200 DR by the Ilythiiri.

Following the Crown Wars, moon elves helped to raise many

of  the  nations  of  the  second  generation  of  elven  realms.  Sur-

vivors of Orishaar, in conjunction with clans from other realms

that  had  been  destroyed  during  the  Crown  Wars,  founded  the

secret refuge of Evereska in 8600 DR, and many moon elves

populated the glorious realm of Cormanthyr, founded in 3983

DR in the woods of the Elven Court. One by one the old elven

realms faded away, until the fall of Myth Drannor in 714 DR

left Evereska as the last moon elf city in Faern. Many nomadic

moon  elf  bands  still  roamed  the  great  forests  of  northern

Faern,  but  no  new  elven  kingdoms  rose  after  the  fall  of  the

second-generation realms.

Despite  the  fact  that  only  a  single  realm  of  moon  elves  has

survived  the  ages  since  the  Crown  Wars,  the  moon  elves  have

fared  well  compared  to  many  of  their  elven  kin.  Content  to

gather in small, secretive, and relatively short-lived settlements

or  to  simply  wander  across  the  wild  lands  of  Faern  as  their

hearts  call  them,  the  moon  elves  have  built  few  places  worth

destroying. When the Elven Retreat began, the moon elves were

slow to heed its call, and even then answered the call in much

smaller numbers than did the sun elves and other elven races.

Outlook

Moon elves are more impulsive than the other elves, and dislike

remaining in one place for any significant amount of time. Most

moon  elves  are  happiest  when  traveling,  especially  across  the

expanses  of  untrodden  wilderness  that  still  survive  in  Faern.

This is probably the single greatest reason why they are so much

more  friendly  and  accommodating  to  other  races  than  many

other  elves:  They  do  not  isolate  themselves  from  the  human

lands  behind  impervious  defenses.  Moon  elves  have  watched

humankind for much longer than their sun or wood elf kin, and

they  know  that  nonelves  arent  as  foolish  and  unimportant  as

most  other  elves  think.  They  feel  that  engaging  promising

human  realms  such  as  Silverymoon  and  instilling  elven  values

and culture in these young lands is a better way for the elven race

to survive and thrive than hiding away and avoiding all contact

with ambitious, grasping humans.

Moon elves are drawn to adventure through sheer wanderlust.

They desire to see and do everything possible during their long

lives.  Like  their  allies  the  Harpers,  moon  elves  believe  that  a

single person of good heart who stands up to injustice or evil can

make a big difference. The typical moon elf adventurer tends to

be  a  wandering  protector  of  the  common  folk,  not  a  dungeon-

plundering slayer of monsters.

MOON ELF CHARACTERS

More so than other elves, moon elves are drawn to a variety of

paths. They have a great love of music and make excellent bards.

Moon  elves  do  not  possess  the  depth  of  reverence  for  the  Sel-

darine the sun elves do, nor the bond with nature of the wood

elves, but clerics and druids are not uncommon among the sub-

race.  Many  moon  elves  are  skilled  warriors  and  have  at  least

some levels in the fighter class, as they have long made up the

bulk  of  the  elven  armies.  But  moon  elves  prefer  stealth  over

strength, and often choose to become rangers or rogues instead.

38

ELVES

Finally, like all elves, moon elves are enamored of magic, and a

great number take up the wizards arts.

Favored Class: Moon elves share a natural affinity for arcane

magic with the sun elves, although they tend to be more impul-

sive  with  their  spells.  Unlike  their  more  disciplined  kin,  moon

elves frequently pursue two or more paths at the same time, com-

bining the study of magic with the arts of the swordmaster or the

rogue. Their favored class is wizard.

Prestige Classes: The moon elves were the first to develop the

bladesinger prestige class, and they have the most bladesingers of

any the elven subraces. Moon elves often become arcane archers,

as one might expect. Any moon elf adventurer of good heart who

has a little experience under her belt is likely to become a Harper

and often chooses to advance as a Harper scout. Moon elves also

make very good spellsingers.

Moon Elf Society

Moon elves are nomadic spirits who rarely settle down for long

in one place. They are comfortable living among sun elves and

wood  elves,  but  just  as  often  they  live  in  areas  dominated  by

humans,  halflings,  or  even  gnomes.  Their  homes  tend  to  be

simple, unassuming, and comfortable.

Moon elves are much less solemn and serious in their ways and

actions  than  sun  elves.  Their  songs  and  poems  are  lighter  and

often quite humorous; tragedies have their place but the moon

elves prefer to balance such things with light-hearted and often

bawdy  tales  and  songs.  They  also  enjoy  a  wide  variety  of  art

styles, including paintings and sculpture. Moon elves are fond of

games of chance and gambling. Drinking, feasting, and reveling

are all a strong part of their society.

A  more  serious  side  to  the  moon  elves  emerges  in  times  of

trouble. Moon elves are just as skilled with weapons and magic as

their fellow elven subraces, and do not hesitate to act if a situa-

tion calls for violence as a solution. Even in warfare, they try to

find hope and humor, for it is during these dark times that levity

and joy are most valuable.

Moon elves gather in loose bands, composed of a dozen or so

extended families. Leadership is democratic; all elves of the band

have a say in important decisions, although the voices of one or

two of the wiser and more experienced family heads tend to carry

the  day.  In  times  of  danger,  the  band  chooses  an  elder  or  war-

leader to see them through the peril. Moon elves travel light and

travel  often,  rarely  staying  in  the  same  place  for  more  than  a

season or two before moving on.

Language and Literacy

All moon elves speak Elven, Common, and the human language

of their home region. Their nomadic nature encourages them to

pick  up  additional  languages  as  they  travel  as  well,  and  most

moon  elves  can  speak  at  least  one  or  two  additional  languages

beyond  these.  Common  choices  include  Auran,  Chondathan,

Gnoll, Gnome, Halfling, Illuskan, and Sylvan.

All moon elf characters are literate, except for barbarians.

Moon Elf Magic and Lore

Moon  elves  crave  magic  like  no  other  race  (except  perhaps

their sun elf cousins). Arcane and divine spellcasters alike are

encouraged  to  push  the  boundaries  of  known  magic  and  dis-

cover  something  new,  adding  to  the  moon  elves  collective

magical knowledge.

Magic is not just a vocation for a moon elfits an avocation.

The  joy  in  casting  a  complex  spell  or  creating  a  potent  magic

item is as profound and all-encompassing as any great work of

art or music. While the sun elves have a stunning accumulation

of spell-lore, the moon elves engage in ceaseless experimentation.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Moon elves, along with sun elves and a few wood elves, are the

only elven subrace to still practice High Magic, although sun

elves  still  make  up  the  bulk  of  those  practitioners  of  this

potent  form  of  magic.  Moon  elf  wizards  usually  prefer  to

focus  their  learning  on  discovering  new  forms  of  magic  and

methods of spellcasting.

MOON ELF MAGIC ITEMS

Creating magic items takes a long time and a willingness to stay

in one place during that period. As a result, moon elf spellcasters

focus on creating less powerful magic items so they dont have to

waste valuable travel time sitting around building things. Sun

elves  in  particular  find  this  trait  somewhat  embarrassing,  but

moon  elves  are  comfortable  with  their  own  less-than-obsessive

interest in crafting magic items.

Common Items: Boots and cloaks of elvenkind are among the

most popular items made by moon elves.

Moon Elf Deities

Moon elves worship the Seldarine. A moon elf identifies with all

the elven deities, but usually chooses one as a patron deity above

the others. Unlike their sun elf cousins, many moon elves wor-

ship the elven deity Angharradh, who they believe to be a meld-

ing of the three goddesses Sehanine, Aerdrie Faenya, and Hanali

Celanil. The moon elves view her as equal in power to Corellon

Larethian,  who  is  often  regulated  to  the  status  of  a  consort.

Moon  elf  religious  ceremonies  are  exuberant,  joyful,  and  loud.

Even  deeply  religious  moon  elves  recognize  that  some  cere-

monies and festivals are simply excuses for revelry.

Relations with Other Races

Of the elven subraces, moon elves are the most tolerant of non-

elves.  They  travel  extensively,  and  a  moon  elf  can  expect  to

interact with hundreds of different races throughout her life.

Moon elves find the diversity of Faerns races to be intoxicat-

ing  and  forever  surprising,  and  they  especially  value  the

insights of other races because they often think of things no elf

would  ever  consider.  This  openness  and  willingness  to  accept

new ideas is regarded as foolish and dangerous by other elves, so

ironically  their  own  kin  often  give  moon  elves  the  coolest

receptions.

Despite their open minds, moon elves have little patience or

interest in the various evil beings, and they hold orcs and gnolls

in particular contempt. They avoid regions where such cultures

hold sway, although moon elf adventurers often infiltrate these

39

ELVES

areas to spy on them. The moon elves share with the other elven

subraces a hatred and loathing for the drow.

Moon Elf Equipment

Moon elf musical instruments are true wonders to behold. Their

instruments are never less than masterwork in quality and often

bear magical enhancements of some sort. These instruments are

refined and delicate in appearance, often adorned with gemstones

and made with precious materials.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Moon elves prefer to fight with longswords, rapiers, longbows,

and shortbows. Moon elf armor, like moon elf garments, tends

to  look  ancient  or  primitive  at  first  glance.  A  closer  look

reveals  impeccable  artistry  that  both  mimics  and  amplifies

natures beauty.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Moon  elves  value  the  companionship  of  animals,  beasts,  and

magical  beasts  on  their  travels,  and  they  often  keep  at  two  or

three pets at a time. Favored pets include hunting dogs, falcons

and other raptors, and cats. Moon elves rarely keep mounts, as

they feel they see more when they do their traveling with their

own two feet. More powerful moon elves often take the Leader-

ship  feat  to  gain  a  magical  beast  as  a  cohort;  common  choices

include blink dogs, pegasi, unicorns, and even dragonnes.

Elf, Sun (Gold Elf)

Regions: Elf (sun), Evermeet, The North, Silverymoon, Western

Heartlands.

Racial Feats: Gift of Tongues.

Racial Prestige Classes: Bladesinger, Elven High Mage.

The  majority  of  Faerns  sun  elves  live  on  Evermeet,  having

abandoned what remained of their ancient realms during the cen-

turies following the falls of Illefarn and Cormanthyr. They are

only now returning to the mainland to reestablish their presence

there. The sun elves are famed for their command of both arcane

and  divine  magic,  which  exceeds  that  of  any  other  living  race.

Works of elven high magic thousands of years old still survive in

the hidden refuges of the sun elves.

Sun elves are responsible for the majority of the great elven

cities  of  legend,  although  other  elven  subraces  aided  the  con-

struction of many of these cities. Myth Drannor is perhaps their

most famous creation, although probably not their most mag-

nificent.  Sun  elf  realms  are  the  stuff  legends  are  made  of,  an

integral  part  of  the  history  of  Faern  for  thousands  of  years.

The sun elves certainly know this, for they distance themselves

from nonelf races and often wont let such lesser beings into

their lands.

Sun  elves  have  bronze  skin,  hair  of  golden  blond,  copper,  or

black, and eyes of green or gold. They favor contemplation, lore,

and study over the quick games and light-hearted songs of other

elves, but seem to embody the unearthly beauty, grace, and pres-

ence of the elven folk.

Sun elves dress in clothing that is at the same time magnifi-

cent and understated, favoring cool colors such as blue and green.

They decorate their clothes with intricate gold- or mithral-thread

embroidery in exacting patterns whose subtle designs are easy to

miss at first. Jewelry is simple but painstakingly crafted.

Of all the elven subraces, sun elves are the most arrogant and

haughtyeven more so than the avariels, whose haughtiness is

rooted  in  pity  for  the  landbound  races.  Sun  elves  believe  that

they are the true elven race, the builders and the leaders of the

elven realms, and that the other elven subraces fail to live up to

the solemnity and dignity of their ancient stock.

Sun elves are unusually long-lived, even for elves, and use the

following aging effect characteristics instead of the ones in Table

65 in the Players Handbook:

History

The sun elves migrated to Faern at the same time as the moon

elves and the dark elves. Although they were the least numerous

of the three peoples, they nonetheless quickly established several

great  nations,  including  Aryvandaar  and  Othreier.  Under  the

leadership of House Vyshaan, a dynasty of sun elves, the nation

of  Aryvandaar  in  particular  soon  became  the  most  powerful

elven realm of its time.

The Vyshaanti were aggressive expansionists, and their obses-

sion with increasing the size of their empire at the expense of the

other races is thought to be the major cause of the terrible Crown

Wars of ten thousand years past. After the Fifth Crown War, the

Vyshaanti were finally overthrown, and the sun elves returned to

a less aggressive lifestyle that has changed little over the inter-

vening millennia.

The next great nation founded by the sun elves was Corman-

thyr in the year 3983 DR. This time they chose to build a realm

founded  on  compassion,  lore,  and  subtle  magic  instead  of  mili-

tary  might  and  great  battle-mages.  As  a  result,  the  nation  was

much kinder and more powerful in the long run, and the elves of

Cormanthyr accomplished many amazing magical wonders. For

thousands  of  years,  Cormanthyr  stood  as  the  most  powerful

realm in northern Faern, eclipsed only briefly by Netheril at its

height.  From  their  city  of  Myth  Drannor  in  the  heart  of  the

forest,  the  Coronals  of  Cormanthyr  checked  for  centuries  the

burgeoning strength of young human lands such as Cormyr or

Sembia that rose in the years after Netherils fall.

The raising of the Standing Stone and the Dales compact of 0

DR, peaceful though they were, signaled the beginning of the end

of elven might in Faern. Although Myth Drannor achieved its

greatest  flowering  in  the  years  of  peaceful  human  and  elven

coexistence, its days were numbered. Cormanthyr finally fell in

714  DR,  when  an  overabundance  of  portals  in  the  vicinity  of

Myth Drannor weakened the boundaries between worlds, allow-

ing a disastrous invasion of fiends.

ELVES

Today,  the  bulk  of  Faerns  sun  elves  live  in  a  third  great

nation, the distant island of Evermeet. First settled in 9800 DR

by  sun  elves  from  Aryvandaar,  the  young  realms  remoteness

protected it from the ravages of the Crown Wars and the ensu-

ing rise of human power on Faern. For more than ten thousand

years, Evermeet has been the safest haven for elvenkind and the

hidden  refuge  of  elven  civilization.  From  Evermeet  came  the

call  for  the  Elven  Retreat  in  1344  DR,  and  the  sun  elves  of

Faern felt that call most deeply of all the elven peoples.

Now  that  the  Retreat  has  ended,  the  haughty  sun  elves  are

among the last to return to Faern. Most sun elves still prefer

to remain sequestered on their island nation, even though recent

events have proved that Evermeet is not safe from harm. Today,

the only large community of sun elves remaining in Faern is

the hidden city of Evereska, on the borders of Anauroch.

Outlook

The  sun  elves  believe  that  they  were  selected  by  Corellon

Larethian  to  be  the  defenders  of  elven  tradition  and  history.

They  are  also  the  most  patient  of  the  elven  races,  and  they

devote  their  time  to  perfecting  a  task  rather  than  just  merely

completing  the  task.  To  a  sun  elf,  rushing  a  job  or  finishing  a

project  in  anything  less  than  perfection  is  betraying  the  elven

ideal. As a result, they tend to have a much narrower range of

skills than other elves, but they are the unrivaled masters of the

skill,  art,  or  craft  to  which  they  turn  their  efforts.  The  only

exception  to  this  rule  is  combat.  Sun  elves  have  no  love  for

combat, but they are nevertheless well trained in its ways. They

view combat as a necessary evil, and one that should be resolved

quickly so the task can be done and one can return to more pleas-

ant and constructive pursuits.

Sun elves are the least likely of the elven subraces to take up

the adventurers path. They see little point in roaming around

the world and meeting other peoples, especially when any sun

elf  can  enjoy  as  much  comfort,  study,  and  contemplation  as

she  likes  by  remaining  in  one  of  the  hidden  sun  elf  realms.

Most  sun  elf  adventurers  are  more  properly  thought  of  as

spies, dutiful scouts who make it their lifelong task to observe

the other peoples of Faern and keep a vigilant watch for the

rise of any threats to the elven homelands. A few sun elves are

also drawn to the mystery of ancient power and seek to add to

the lore of their people by exploring ruins of ancient empires

all across Faern.

SUN ELF CHARACTERS

Sun elves favor the traditional paths of the elven folk: fighter

and  wizard.  No  sun  elf  could  truly  be  described  as  a  barbarian,

although a sun elf raised among wilder kin might, on very rare

occasions, choose to take levels in the barbarian class. They make

good bards, and even if they are not noted for their light-hearted

revels, the ancient songs and lore of a learned bard are worthy of

a sun elfs respect. Sun elves are also the foremost clerics and pal-

adins among the elven races. The arts of stealth and archery are

not widely practiced among sun elves, so rangers and rogues are

relatively scarce among them.

Favored  Class:  Sun  elf  society  and  culture  is  steeped  in  a

fascination  with  magic  and  learning.  They  often  become

incredibly talented wizards, and their natural intellect makes

them powerful ones as well. Few sun elf adventurers do not take

up the study of magic at some point in their careers.

Prestige Classes: Sun elves often choose prestige classes that

allow them to continue their specialized studies. They are par-

ticularly  drawn  to  the  arcane  devotee,  archmage,  and  lore-

master prestige classes, although some of the more warlike of

the race practice the uniquely elven arts of the arcane archer

and bladesinger.

Sun Elf Society

Sun  elves  are  deliberate,  patient,  and  solemn,  and  their  society

reflects  this.  Their  buildings,  while  aesthetically  beautiful  and

architecturally  brilliant,  tend  to  be  ostentatious.  Nevertheless,

the  sun  elves  take  great  pride  in  their  buildings,  believing  that

nothing less than perfection will do for the chosen defenders of

elven  tradition  and  history.  Their  art,  poetry,  and  songs  also

reflect their deliberate and regal attitudes. They prefer tales of

ancient  battles,  songs  of  the  gods,  and  stories  of  great  heroes

beset with terrible tragedies.

Sun elves revere wisdom and learning. Even the humblest sun

elf abode features a room or two filled with old scrolls, maps, and

books. Sun elves have a strong tradition of rule by nobility, and

most sun elf communities are ruled by a monarch who can trace

his  or  her  line  back  to  the  First  Crown  War.  Where  a  human

noble measures his power by the expanse of the lands under his

rule and the numbers of soldiers at his command, a sun elf noble

is known by the honor of her family name, the magical power

and lore her family has accumulated, and the wealth and beauty

of her palatial home.

Language and Literacy

All sun elves speak Elven, Common, and the human language of

their home region. Although they often learn other languages

(in  particular  Auran,  Celestial,  Chondathan,  Gnome,  Halfling,

Illuskan, and Sylvan), they prefer to use magic to communicate

with neighbors or simply insist that visitors learn Elven. Many

sun  elves  choose  to  study  dead  languages  such  as  Aragrakh,

Loross, or Seldruin in order to increase their access to ancient

works and lore.

All sun elves are literate, except for barbarians, if any exist.

Sun Elf Magic and Lore

The pinnacle of sun elf knowledge is elven high magic, spells that

can ward an entire city against evil, conceal an invading army, or

cause a forest to grow up overnight. Such magic is not without

its risks, a fact that the sun elves are keenly aware of since the

fall of Myth Drannor. While the sun elves still remember the

secrets of high magic, they refuse to share such knowledge and

are hesitant to use such power themselves beyond the borders

of Evermeet.

Sun  elves  have  another  key  advantagean  unparalleled  col-

lection  of  spellbooks,  laboratory  notes,  and  other  accumulated

lore. For ten thousand years, the sun elves have been practicing

magic,  and  the  libraries  of  Evermeet  and  Evereska  are  full  of

magic secrets too numerous to properly catalog.

41

ELVES

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

The art of high magic is still practiced in Evermeet by the sun

elves,  who  in  this  day  and  age  comprise  almost  all  elven  high

mages. They guard the secrets of high magic jealously, and are

reluctant  to  teach  its  ways  to  other  elves  (see  the  Elven  High

Mage prestige class in the Appendix).

SUN ELF MAGIC ITEMS

Whereas the moon elves prefer to focus on smaller, easier to

craft magic items, the sun elves view such things as wastes of

time good only for young wizards to practice on. To a sun elf,

a  magic  item  must  be  powerful  and  perfect  in  all  ways.  Sun

elves know that their magic items often find their way into the

hands of lesser races, and as a result they view these items as

the true legacy of their race. To craft anything less than per-

fect is to do a disservice to the lesser racesand the reputation

of the sun elves.

Common Items: Among the more affordable of sun elf magic

items are celestial armor and elven chainmail, which is made of

mithral and often magically enhanced.

Sun Elf Deities

Religion infuses every aspect of sun elf society. Sun elves believe

themselves to be the chosen representatives of the Seldarine in

the mortal realm, and are quick to offer prayers of thanks to

their deities. These prayers and ceremonies are invariably long,

drawn-out  affairs  during  which  loud  voices,  merry  songs,  or

joyful  worship  are  deemed  disrespectful.  Religion  is  a  serious,

solemn subject to the sun elves. They worship all the Seldarine

equally, and most choose Corellon Larethian as their patron.

The sun elf devotion to magic, skill at arms, and the superi-

ority  of  elven  civilization  means  that  they  have  a  great  and

abiding veneration for the leader of the elven pantheon. Like

their own nobles, Corellon is a wise, generous, and firm leader

who brings forth beauty in the world, then defends his work res-

olutely. Clerics of the church of Corellon advise the rulers of

sun elf communities, and Corellons clerics form the heart of a

sun elf army when the sun elves must take the field to defend

their lands.

Sun  elves  also  venerate  Labelas  Enorath,  the  elven  deity  of

longevity, time, and wisdom. While Corellon is seen as the divine

leader  and  protector  of  the  sun  elves,  Labelas  is  revered  as  a

counselor  and  advisor,  a  source  of  wisdom  in  times  of  trouble.

Clerics of Labelas are charged with the keeping of knowledge and

records among the sun elves.

Relations with Other Races

The sun elves feel affection for the moon elves, although this

affection is often unintentionally patronizing. They fear that

their moon elf cousins are too flighty and irreverent, and they

strive to help them return to the proper elven path with stern

lectures  and  fatherly  advice.  They  admire  the  wood  elves  and

feel that they embody the elven spirit of nature. Relations are

good between sun elf and wood elf, although the reclusive nature

of the wood elves makes direct contact rare. Sun elves are a bit

puzzled  by  the  wild  elves,  and  hope  one  day  to  civilize  them.

Aquatic elves are thought of as near-equals, and the sun elves

believe that their water-breathing kin were placed in the world

to bring to the seas what the sun elves bring to the lands above.

The sun elves deeply regret the sufferings of the avariels, and

occasionally  send  out  explorers  to  seek  out  avariel  aeries  and

offer them a place on Evermeet.

Sun elf prejudice toward other races (humans in particular)

can be quite severe. Many sun elves wont even deign to speak

to a human and would rather leave a dying man to meet his fate

than  to  save  him.  This  attitude  is  somewhat  understandable,

given  the  way  humans  have  historically  treated  the  sun  elves

and their lands, but it wins the sun elves few friends among their

human neighbors.

If there is one race that the sun elves hold in absolute con-

tempt, it is the drow. They view the dark elves as abominations

and insults to the Seldarine, and often attack these hated ene-

mies  on  sight.  As  word  of  the  drow  invasion  of  Cormanthor

begins to spread through Evermeet, it is likely that more and

more sun elves will return to the mainland, if only to bring war

to the drow and force them from the ruins of what sun elves

still consider their lands.

Sun Elf Equipment

Two things are almost certain about any item of sun elf manu-

facture: its of the finest quality and its exceedingly old. Given

their long lifespans and obsession with perfection, sun elves make

their goods very slowly, throwing them out if even slight imper-

fections  are  discovered.  Their  reverence  for  history  encourages

them  to  keep  and  treasure  antiques.  Even  a  beginning  sun  elf

adventurer might wield a sword thats several centuries old, and

she can probably describe its history and the lineages of its pre-

vious owners in great detail.

Sun elves favor gold for decorative elements and mithral for

anything that must be strong, such as weapons and armor. Sun

elves also know how to make items from glassteel (see the appen-

dix), although they have only used the transparent material on

Evermeet and in the enclave of Evereska.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Sun elf weapons and armor are only rarely of less than master-

work quality. They are viewed as works of art in and of them-

selves and are carried or worn proudly into battle. Sun elves are

known to make some of the most exquisite suits of chainmail

armor in Faern. Some suits of elven chainmail actually contain

entire  texts  of  ancient  elven  works,  the  words  of  the  work

carved with painstaking detail into the very links of the armor.

Sun elves also fashion other suits of armor, including suits of

streamlined,  beautiful  full  plate.  While  the  quality  of  this

armor can rival the best work of the dwarves, the sun elves are

so obsessed with perfecting every possible aspect of their cre-

ations that in the time it takes a sun elf armorer to build one

suit of armor, a dwarven smith can crank out a dozen suits of

equal quality.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Unlike the other elven subraces, sun elves do not usually keep

animals in their homes or cities as pets. Their communities are

at  peace  with  nature,  though,  and  the  sun  elves  welcome  the

company of any animals who pass through the area or choose to

make their lairs nearby or within a city. Sun elves are far more

likely to call upon powerful elementals or outsiders than good-

hearted  beasts  and  woodland  creatures  to  aid  in  the  defense  of

their homes.

More than the other elven subraces, sun elves are keen riders,

though they favor winged mounts such as pegasi and giant eagles

over more conventional steeds.

Elf, Wild

(Green Elf)

Regions: Chondalwood, Chessenta, Chult, Elf (wild), or

the Shaar.

Racial Feat: Tattoo Magic.

The wild elves of Faern are insular and savage,

and  as  a  result  are  rarely  seen  outside  their

forest  homes.  In  ages  past  the  wild

elves  (or  green  elves,  as  they  were

more commonly known) raised great

kingdoms  in  the  forests  and  fielded

armies  to  defend  their  homes,  but  with

the  march  of  time  they  have  aban-

doned  the  trappings  of  civilization,

becoming a furtive, reclusive race. The

wild elves were always close to nature,

even more so than other elves, but they

have forgotten many of the high arts and

lore of their people, choosing stealth and

survival over building and book learning.

Wild  elves  are  stocky  and  strongly

built  for  elves.  Their  skin  tends  to  be

dark brown, and their hair ranges from

black to light brown, lightening to silvery

white  with  age.  They  are  quiet  around

anyone except their own kind, and quickly

become hostile in these uncomfortable situ-

ations.  Clothing  is  kept  to  a  minimum  among

the wild elves, although they make up for this

with body decoration of all sortstattoos, war paint, feathers,

and beaded jewelry that shows a surprising streak of complex

and beautiful artistry.

Wild elves share the height of their moon and sun elf kin but

are  more  heavily  built.  They  have  the  aging  characteristics

described on Tables 64 and 65 of the Players Handbook, but

use  the  following  random  height  and  weight  characteristics

instead of those described on Table 66:

History

The  wild  elves  were  not  always  the  feral  creatures  they  have

become  today.  Ages  ago  the  green  elves,  as  they  were  then

known, were the first elven explorers (along with the lythari and

the avariels) to discover Abeir-Toril, and they quickly became

entranced with the wondrous young world. Of this first migra-

tion of elves, the green elves were easily the most successful, and

they  established  several  territories  destined  to  become  great

nations: Thearnytaar, Eiellr, Sypiir, Miyeritar, and Keltormir.

Unfortunately, with the coming of the Crown Wars, these

nations were among the first to fall. Eiellr fell to the Ilythi-

iri (the dark elves) in 11,400 DR, and Thearnytaar in 11,200

DR. The realm of Miyeritar, located where the High Moor now

lies, was utterly consumed by the Dark Disaster in 10,500 DR,

and the other green elf realms fared little better. The peaceful

green elves proved to be relatively easy prey for the cruel dark

elves,  and  by  the  time  the  Crown  Wars  ended  in

9000 DR, the idyllic world of the green elves had

been  shattered.  Their  great  nations  razed  in

centuries  of  relentless  warfare,  the  green

elves began a time they refer to as the

Wandering. They never recovered fully

from the setbacks of twelve thousand

years ago, and raised no more great cities

in Faern.

The  Wandering  of  the  green

elves  lasted  for  many  long  elven

generations. Forced to live for cen-

turies as fugitives, slaves, or rootless

vagabonds,  the  surviving  green

elves  receded  further  and  further

from elven society, withdrawing to

the deepest forests and mountains of

Faern. While the other subraces races

raised  the  second  generation  of  elven

realms  in  places  like  Evermeet  and

Cormanthyr,  the  green  elves  placed

their  trust  in  secrecy  and  stealth

instead of walls and might, remaining

hidden  within  their  forest  homes.  By

the  time  of  Jhaamdaths  rise  around

5800 DR, the green elves had settled

into several of the places that are still

their ancient homelands: the Chondal-

wood,  the  Forest  of  Amtar,  and  other  great  old

woodlands of southern Faern.

Over the course of many years, the green elves

forgot  more  and  more  of  their  ancient  lore  and

skill,  focusing  on  the  only  skills  that  mattered:

stealth, survival, hunting, and hiding. They became first a clan-

nish folk, then a tribal culture, and finally a primitive people.

They remained elves, of course, creatures of nobility and magic,

but  they  lost  the  arts  of  crafting  mighty  spells  and  forging

magic weapons. Their fleeting contacts with the rising human

empires of the day reinforced the green elf reclusiveness, driv-

ing them deeper into the wilds and further from their old ways.

Today, the green elves are more widely known as the wild elves,

a race lost in time in the sweltering forests of southern Faern.

Outlook

The tragic history of the wild elves has left them untrusting of

outsiders.  Their  tactics  for  dealing  with  intruders  vary  from

tribe to tribe. Some simply hide and allow the trespassers to go

by unknowing, while others attack to capture such interlopers.

They rarely kill those they capture, preferring to use magic to

alter their memories and carry them far away before releasing

43

Wild elves deal with a visitor

ELVES

them. They make friends slowly, and most nonelves simply dont

have the lifespans required to gain the trust of a tribe of green

elves.  They  excel  in  combat  and  often  revel  in  its  chaos  and

primal fury. Little can match the fury of an enraged tribe of

green elves.

WILD ELF CHARACTERS

More so than any other elves, wild elves value the martial skills.

Barbarians and rangers are very common among the wild elves.

The wild elves do not feel close to the Seldarine and do not often

become  clerics,  instead  venerating  nature  itself  as  druids  of

Mielikki,  Silvanus,  or  Rillifane  Rallathil.  Wild  elves  have  no

written tradition and little patience for hours of study in any

event  and  so  rarely  become  wizards.  Unlike  other  elves,  they

prefer the sorcerers arts.

Favored Class: Despite their lack of learning and skill, wild

elves are just as naturally talented at arcane magic as most other

elves.  Their  favored  class  is  sorcerer,  a  path  of  power  that

rewards spontaneity and creative energy instead of hours of dry

study in ancient, moldering tomes.

Prestige Classes: A small number of wild elf fighter/sorcerers

follow  the  path  of  the  arcane  archer,  but  the  most  common

prestige  class  among  the  green  elves  is  the  hierophant.  Wild

elves can become very powerful druids, and their leaders often

turn to druids for guidance and support.

Wild Elf Society

Among  their  friends  and  kinfolk,  wild  elves  are  pleasant  and

outgoing, somewhat like the moon elves. Their feasts and cele-

brations are events of great joy, with singing, dancing, and all

manner of merry-making. One of the most beloved ways to cel-

ebrate is to engage in a hunt. Hunts are tribal affairs in which

all elves, young and old, have a part. The actual hunt itself is

sometimes  only  a  small  part  of  the  overall  event,  which  also

includes a religious ceremony and a tribewide festival.

The scattered, tribal nature of the green elves also means that

no two tribes are exactly alike. Some have settled in permanent

villages with crude huts, while others are nomadic, dwelling in

tents and wandering over vast wilderness territories. Gender seg-

regation  is  common;  some  tribes  are  exclusively  matriarchal,

while others are patriarchal.

Although  they  have  a  great  interest  in  music  and  art,  wild

elves create few permanent works of art. To the wild elf, the joy

of art lies in the creative process, the spontaneous creation of

song  or  dance  or  effects.  They  view  with  distaste  attempts  to

capture  this  process  by  making  permanent  works  of  art,

recording songs or stories in writing, and so on, maintaining that

to do so imprisons the ever-changing beauty of the world.

Language and Literacy

All wild elves speak Elven, Common, and the language of their

home region. They are isolationists and do not trust outsiders, so

they  rarely  learn  the  languages  of  their  neighbors,  especially

their  enemies.  Common  additional  languages  include  Gnoll,

Illuskan, Mulan, Orc, Shaaran, Sylvan, and Tashalan.

Wild elf characters who choose a player character class (other

than barbarian) are literate, but all other wild elf characters

are illiterate.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Wild  elves  have  all  the  racial  traits  listed  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting, except as follows:

Proficient with halfspear, short bow, and long bow. Unlike the

other  elf  subraces,  wild  elves  favor  weapons  they  can  make

without a source of metal and a smithy.

Wild Elf Magic and Lore

Although in ancient times the green elves were one of the key

developers  of  elven  high  magic,  their  days  as  practitioners  of

this  potent  art  are  long  gone.  Today,  their  spellcasters  are

almost all druids or sorcerers.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Wild  elf  magic  is  often  tied  closely  to  nature.  Although  the

theory behind their spells may be identical to that practiced by

other  races,  wild  elf  spellcasters  often  add  additional  verbal,

somatic, and material components to a spell simply to make it

seem  more  naturalistic  (see  the  Primitive  Caster  feat  in  the

appendix).  These  additional  components  do  not  significantly

increase the actual casting time of the spell.

WILD ELF MAGIC ITEMS

Wild elves eschew even the most powerful magic items if they

appear to be too far removed from the natural world. They have

a  particular  aversion  to  forged  metal  and  to  most  clothing.

Their  own  magic  items  appear  to  be  crude  and  primitive,  but

they are just as effective as their more civilized counterparts.

They  are  particularly  fond  of  magic  tattoos,  and  many  wild

elves take the Tattoo Magic feat (see the appendix).

Wild Elf Deities

The wild elves worship the Seldarine, in particular Rillifane

Rallathil, but this worship does not approach the regimented,

organized  structure  of  the  other  elven  subraces.  Rather,  the

green elves worship individually when the urge takes them. They

commune constantly with a pantheon of nature spirits, each

representing an archetypal member of an animal or natural

phenomenon.

Relations with Other Races

The green elves do not seek out relations with others, and they

do their best to remain unseen and unknown. Nevertheless, wild

elves have been known to interact with adventurers, explorers,

and lost travelers. Usually, these people are captured, their mem-

ories magically erased, and then let go somewhere far from the

tribal  lands.  Rarely,  the  elves  allow  a  wanderer  to  visit  their

camp, usually in times of dire peril when they are forced to call

upon  outside  aid.  Those  who  manage  to  impress  and  even

befriend a tribe of wild elves find that their friendship is strong

and loyal, and such individuals are often gifted with wild elf

tattoos or spirit animals.

ELVES

Wild Elf Equipment

Wild elves prefer weapons and tools they can make and fix in

the middle of a battle or hunt. Despite their disdain for civi-

lized goods, wild elves are adept at crafting things in harmony

with nature. Their treetop villages, for example, are inextricably

part  of  the  healthy  trees  that  support  theman  engineering

feat that would baffle the best gnome architect.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Wild elves prefer using simple weapons that can be crafted from

materials found in the wilderness: bows, crude bone daggers and

knives, and clubs. They have a particular fondness for bows and

halfspears. Wild elves prefer to wear hide armor, if anything at

all. For the most part, wild elves find armor too restrictive, rely-

ing on concealment and agility for defense.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Wild elves are quite fond of animals, and most tribes use them

as  guardians  and  hunters  companions.  Wolves  are  commonly

found in wild elf tribes, as are birds of prey of all kinds, great

cats,  and  even  wolverines.  Dire  versions  of  these  animals  are

only slightly more rare.

Wild elves also believe that each of their kind is born with a

spirit animal, a guide of sorts that serves as a combination of

guardian angel and advisor to the natural world. All young wild

elves  undergo  an  involved  ritual  that  demands  several  hours

(often in excess of a day) in an enclosed area filled with steam

and the smoke of burning herbs. At some time during this period

the elf receives a vision of his spirit animal, and for the rest of

his life he feels guarded and protected by this animal.

Elf, Wood

(Copper Elf)

Regions: The Dalelands, Elf (wood), Great Dale, High Forest, the

North, Tethyr, Western Heartlands.

Racial Feats: None.

The wood elves are among the most numerous of Faerns elven

people, a young and confident folk who hold the old elven forest

homelands in strength. Heirs to the second generation of elven

nations, the wood elves see their realms as the natural successors

to  lands  such  as  Eaerlann  and  Cormanthyr.  Where  the  old

empires  expanded  with  strength  and  pride,  the  realms  of  the

wood  elves  hope  to  grow  with  compassion  and  humility.  The

wood elves do not view their homelands as a land apart from

Faern;  they  understand  better  than  their  kindred  that  for

better or worse, their fates are bound up with the fates of the

humans, dwarves, and halflings around them.

Also known as copper elves or sylvan elves, these people have

coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green, or hazel eyes.

Hair is usually brown or black, occasionally blond or coppery-

red. Wood elves prefer to dress in simple clothing, similar to the

moon elves but not quite so colorful. They favor a simple cut to

tunic or dress, set off by common embroidery in natural designs.

They  are  particularly  fond  of  leather  armor,  and  they  often

wear lovingly tooled and well-crafted suits even when they do

not feel endangered. Their clothing, leather armor or not, is usu-

ally in dark shades of green and earth tones to better blend with

their  natural  surroundings.  They  are  a  humble  race  and  only

rarely do they enhance their appearance with jewelry or similar

accessories.

Wood elves are as tall as most other Faernian elves but more

heavily built. They have the aging characteristics described on

Tables 64 and 65 of the Players Handbook, and use the fol-

lowing  random  height  and  weight  characteristics  instead  of

History

The  wood  elves  are  the  most  recent  addition  to  the  various

elven subraces of Faern, although the history of their civi-

lization still exceeds that of many other races of Toril. They

also have the unusual distinction (often thought of as an honor

by copper elves) of being the only subrace of elves to be actual

natives  to  Faern.  The  first  copper  elves  did  not  appear  at

once; their race coalesced slowly over the course of several cen-

turies after the last Crown War, blending several of the older

elven kindreds.

The Crown Wars brought down most of the great nations of

the  First  Flowering.  In  the  wake  of  these  terrible  wars,  thou-

sands of elves were left bereaved and homeless. Families were

torn apart, and for many centuries (a time known to the elves

as  the  Wandering  Years)  these  elves  simply  led  the  lives  of

nomads.  Some  of  Faerns  elves  retreated  to  their  ancestral

homes and started to build anew, but on a smaller scale, raising

the second generation of elven nations. But a significant portion

of elves never felt the need to do so. These elves (mostly moon,

sun, and green elves), vowed never again to let internal strife

tear their kind apart, retreating to the deepest woodlands to seek

shelter from the madness of the world.

Unlike the green elves, these self-imposed exiles did not slip

into barbarism. Rather, they formed tightly knit societies that

stayed  in  touch  with  other  like-minded  elven  communities

hidden  away  in  other  forests.  Over  time,  these  secluded  elves

grew  closer  to  the  natural  world  and  further  apart  from  the

high magic and ancient lore the elves had brought from their

first home, and became a new subrace of elves apart from their

kin: the wood elves.

While the sun elves and moon elves founded realms such as

Evermeet and Evereska after the Crown Wars, the great realm

of the wood elves was ancient Eaerlann, a realm founded in the

eastern High Forest around 4700 DR. The elves of Eaerlann

engaged other young empires of the North in peaceful trade and

diplomacy,  befriending  the  dwarven  realm  of  Delzoun  soon

after  its  establishment  in  3900  DR,  and  tutoring  the  early

Netherese in magic around 3830 DR.

The human empire of Netheril soon eclipsed its elven neigh-

bors, growing in martial and magical might at an alarming pace.

In 3533 DR the Netherese uncovered the Nether Scrolls in the

ruins of Aryvandaar, eagerly exploiting magic so powerful and

terrible that even the sun elves of the First Flowering had not

dared  to  employ  it.  For  centuries  the  wood  elves  of  Eaerlann

sought to quietly check Netherils pride and expansionism, but

45

ELVES

in  339  DR,  the  Netherese  destroyed  themselves  as  Karsus

sought  godhood  and  instead  brought  cataclysmic  destruction

down  on  his  people.  The  elves  of  Eaerlann  took  in  many

Netherese survivors, allowing them to settle in the city of Ascal-

horn.

The elves and humans of the North lived in peace for a time,

but  Ascalhorn  too  was  doomed  to  fall  through  the  folly  of

mages. Careless summoning of powerful fiends led to a sudden,

terrible assault by an army of devils who overthrew the proud

city in 882 DR. This time, Eaerlann did not survive the destruc-

tion of the neighboring human realm. Already gravely weakened

by a year of battling against ferocious orc hordes, Eaerlann fell

soon after Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep.

In the years since the fall of Eaerlann, the wood elves have

not raised any more great realms, choosing to put their

trust  in  stealth  and  vigilance  instead  of  castles  and

cities.  Although  they  felt  the  call  of  the  Elven

Retreat,  the  wood  elves  did  not  respond.

With  the  end  of  the  Retreat,  the  wood

elves  have  emerged  from  their  secret

homes in the depths of Faerns woodlands as

a strong and confident people whose wariness is tem-

pered  by  compassion.  The  wood  elves  of  the  High

Forest  dream  of  reestablishing  old

Eaerlann,  but  this  time  their

realm will be a realm of reclusive

villages and watchful foresters, not

walled cities and proud warriors.

Outlook

Wood  elves  are  calm,  serene,  and  difficult  to

surprise. Their patience is legendary. They are

at  one  with  the  world  of  nature,  and  are  not

comfortable  in  areas  of  heavy  civilization.

They have lost the urge to build and replace

nature with walls and palaces; even the cities

built by their elven kin seem to be foolish

to the wood elves. They have come to

believe  that  buildings  of  stone  are

transitory in nature, and that in time,

the  forest  returns  to  overgrow  the

greatest  of  cities.  Other  races  interpret

this attitude as fatalistic or condescending, and as

a result wood elves find it hard to understand anyone

who isnt a wood elf.

WOOD ELF CHARACTERS

Of all the elven subraces, the copper elves have the least fasci-

nation  with  arcane  magic.  They  understand  its  power  and  a

number of their folk study its ways, but ultimately the artifice

of arcane lore is simply one more way of expressing dominion

over the natural order of things, and the wood elves view it in

that  light.  Wood  elves  make  excellent  fighters,  rangers,  and

rogues, relying on their natural strength and quickness to meet

challenges. Wood elves from particularly remote forests some-

times become barbarians. Clerics are somewhat rare among this

people, but druids are very common and are the most prominent

spellcasters of the race.

46

Favored Class: Wood elves are master hunters, and most train

enough to possess at least one level of ranger. Favored enemies

usually include orcs, gnolls, outsiders (planetouched), and other

savage races that dwell near the traditional homelands of the

wood elves.

Prestige Classes: When wood elves choose to take up a prestige

class, they are usually drawn to the arcane archer or hierophant

classes. Like the moon elves, wood elves are friendly toward the

Harpers and all they represent, so they are commonly Harper

scouts. Few wood elves become spellsingers or bladesingers.

Wood Elf Society

Wood elves live at ease with nature, using

what  naturally  occurs  in  the  world  to

shelter  or  defend  themselves.  They

are  not  nomadic,  and  claim  large

territories  in  the  deepest  wood-

lands  of  Faern.  Some  wood

elves  choose  to  do  without

houses,  furnishings,  and  any

possessions  they  cant  carry,

using the high branches of great

trees  or  natural  caves  in  their

roots for shelter and storage. Most

wood elves instead prefer to dwell in

small villages of permanent homes of

natural fieldstone and lovingly carved

wood,  so  carefully  concealed  among

the  surrounding  wilderness  that  a

human hunter might walk through the

center  of  a  wood  elf  village  and  not

even notice that he had done so.

Wood elves adhere to a tradition of

leadership  by  their  oldest  and  most

experienced druids, although most vil-

lages form a council of elders selected

from  the  wisest  and  most  experi-

enced  elves  of  each  family  to

handle day-to-day affairs. The

druidical  hierarchy  serves  to

unite wood elves of different

villages and weld all the wood

elves of a particular forest into a

common  realm.  The  druids  do  not  pre-

sume to tell the elders how to run a village, but

the elders generally give great weight to anything a

druid chooses to say.

Wood elves excel in the hunt. They spend much of their time

stalking their chosen territory on the search for food or intrud-

ers into their realm. The rest of their time is spent frolicking

among  the  branches;  in  this  regard,  they  are  quite  similar  to

moon and wild elves. With the end of the Retreat, wood elves

are quickly coming back into contact with the civilized world.

Although  they  are  reluctant  to  allow  others  into  their  lands,

wood elves understand that times are changing. If they are to

survive  as  a  people,  it  may  be  time  to  change  for  the  copper

elves to change as well.

ELVES

Language and Literacy

All wood elves speak Elven, Common, and the language of their

home region, if any. The average wood elf has neither the inter-

est  nor  the  dedication  required  to  learn  other  languages,  but

those who do often learn Chondathan, Draconic, Gnome, Goblin,

Gnoll, and Sylvan.

All wood elf characters are literate except for barbarians.

Wood Elf Magic and Lore

Among the wood elves, magic finds its truest expression in the

power the druid is able to coax from the natural world. Wizardly

magic is suspectall that time among tomes divorces the spell-

caster from the surrounding worldand clerics need to call on

distant gods for help. By contrast, druids use the power of the

forest itself. More importantly, druids use that power to protect

and nurture the forest, and wood elves are pragmatic enough to

judge magic by its end result.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

While the wood elves are as magical as the other elven subraces,

they have for the most part abandoned their interest in arcane

magic.  Most  wood  elf  spellcasters  are  druids  and  rangers,  and

although  wood  elf  bards,  sorcerers,  and  wizards  are  far  from

unknown, they have developed no specific magical traditions of

their own.

WOOD ELF MAGIC ITEMS

Wood  elf  magic  items  are  invariably  crafted  from  materials

found  in  nature,  much  like  those  created  by  the  wild  elves.

Unlike the work of the wild elves, these objects are not primi-

tive in appearance; wood elf magic items are often quite beau-

tiful  and  graceful.  Druidic  magic  is  most  commonly  used  in

their society to fashion magic items.

Wood Elf Deities

Wood elves worship the Seldarine, but they hold a special respect

and reverence for the ancient forest powers of Faern, Silvanus

and Mielikki. Among the Seldarine, the wood elves hold a par-

ticular reverence for Solonor Thelandira, the Great Archer, and

Rillifane Rallathil, the Leaflord. Solonor, as the deity of archery

and the hunt, is viewed as the special patron of the wood elves,

and before battle a wood elf will often invoke his name.

Relations with Other Races

In the five hundred years since the fall of Eaerlann, the wood

elves  have  been  forgotten  by  most  of  the  other  peoples  of

Faern.  Only  those  humans  and  dwarves  native  to  the  North

and  familiar  with  the  borders  of  the  High  Forest  have  seen

copper  elves,  and  even  then,  they  most  likely  met  a  solitary

hunter or ranger. While the wood elves shelter deep inside for-

bidding forests and are therefore inaccessible to their neighbors,

they are ironically among the more compassionate and under-

standing of the elven subraces. Like the moon elves, they accept

the power of humankind and seek to live alongside their human

neighbors and guide their expansion instead of seeking ways to

deter or intimidate the human lands.

Wood elves have a long history of cooperation with the shield

dwarves, whose realm of Ammarindar stood alongside their own

realm of Eaerlann for many centuries in the vale of the Delim-

biyr  River.  By  extension,  they  look  favorably  on  most  other

dwarves, too. Gnomes and halflings are both greeted as friends

and potential allies. On the other hand, the wood elves have a

cold place in their hearts for creatures such as orcs and gnolls,

who bring axes, fire, and slaughter to the forests the wood elves

have sworn to preserve.

Wood Elf Equipment

Wood elves do not often work with metal, but this is not because

they lack the skill or knowledge to do so. Rather, they simply

have no interest in working with metal. They prefer to fashion

their weapons of wood and stone.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Wood elves are masters at building armor and weapons. In par-

ticular, they seem to have a knack for building bows of all kinds

(but  not  crossbows).  The  wood  elves  have  developed  a  large

number of specialized arrows as well, including arrows that fly

farther than normal or serve as signal devices (see the Equip-

ment section of the appendix).

These arrows are not generally sold to visitors because wood

elves have little use for outside money in their society, but they

often give these arrows to allies as gifts. Of course, the major-

ity of wood elf arrows make their way into the world after they

are shot at intruders. Any fletcher not trained by the wood elves

suffers a 4 penalty on any Craft check made to construct these

specialized arrows.

Wood  elves  are  adept  at  dying  their  leather  armor  in  the

exact  shades  of  green  and  brown  of  the  surrounding  foliage.

When in their home forest, wood elves wearing armor treated

with  the  camouflage  dye  receive  a  +4  circumstance  bonus  on

Hide checks (see the appendix).

ANIMALS AND PETS

Wood elves are completely at home with the other creatures of

the woods and often ally themselves with any who live in the

region. They do not necessarily keep them as pets, but instead

just happen to share the same territory. Their favored animal

companions are the various great cats, especially mountain lions,

pumas, and leopards (treat all as leopards). Wood elves also share

a kinship with giant owls, one of the only sentient creatures with

whom they feel completely at ease. The two groups often live in

harmony, with the owls serving as advance scouts for the elves

and the elves serving as protectors in times of peril to the owls.

47

about which the gnomes care little, such as rights of commerce

and settlement, or the drive to achieve and wield power in the

world at large.

As the human realms continue their ages-old expansion and

reach the remote areas in which gnomish settlements are hidden,

some gnomes have started to question their traditional doctrine

of noninterference. It seems that while they may not care to go

off to the violent world of the larger races, that world is already

knocking on their collective door.

Racial History

In  the  gnome  myths,  the  gods  of  the  gnome  pantheon  were

born as gems or rich veins of ore in the very heart of the world,

then exposed by the natural erosion of underground waters. In

this sense, the gnome gods are as old as the world itself, having

always  been  a  part  of  it.  Gnome  folklore  holds  that  the  first

gnomes  were  born  in  turn  from  gems  discovered  by  Garl

Glittergold,  the  leader  of  the  gnome  pantheon.  The

Watchful Protector discovered a sealed cavern stud-

ded with countless gems embedded in veins of valu-

able  ore.  When  Garl  polished  the  gems  and

breathed on them, the jewels opened like blossoms

to release the first gnomes. Before leading them

into the world, Garl told his newfound people

a joke, bringing them laughter and a spirit of

mischief.  Those  gnomes  born  of  diamonds

chose to dwell beneath the land and became

the  rock  gnomes.  Those  born  of  emeralds

chose  to  dwell  amid  the  great  trees  and

became  the  forest  gnomes.  Those  born  of

rubies  wandered  deep  into  the  heart  of  the

earth and became the deep gnomes.

Unfortunately, little is known of the ancient

history of the gnomes other than their own myths.

Peoples such as dwarves, elves, and humans have raised

sprawling  empires  and  fought  great  wars  with  legions  of

steel-clad soldiers and terrible, land-devastating magic, but the

gnomes have never done anything of the sort. Nor have

the  gnomes  ever  collected  in  one  homeland  or  fought

each other, as the halflings did in Luiren. The racial history of

the  gnomes  is  not  a  grand,  sweeping  tapestry,  but  instead  a

Industrious,  intelligent,  and  good-natured,  gnomes  have

few  enemies.  They  are  not  a  numerous  race,  and  for

many  centuries,  gnomes  have  survived  and  thrived  by

keeping a low profile. Avoiding the notice of larger folk obsessed

with empires and mighty magic, the gnomes have quietly spread

across Faern in tiny settlements and hidden villages that often

go completely unnoticed by their neighbors.

There are three distinct sorts of gnomes living on Toril:

deep gnomes, forest gnomes, and rock gnomes. They all

share a slight stature (gnomes are little more than half

the size of a grown human), innate magical gifts, and

a  great  love  for  gems.  The  furtive  deep  gnomes,

also  known  as  svirfneblin,  make  their  homes  in

the depths of the Underdark. The diminutiveeven

for gnomesforest gnomes are even more shy and

retiring than the svirfneblin. Rock gnomes are the

most outgoing and numerous of the three kindreds.

Their inquisitive nature draws them out of their

well-hidden villages and clanholds to explore the

wider world.

Throughout Faern, the gnomes play the role of

intermediary  between  other  races  or  peoples.  Few

count  the  gnomes  as  their  friends,  but  even  fewer

consider the gnomes their enemies. Although gnomes

have not escaped the great cataclysms and upheavals

of the past, few gnomes have ever become embroiled in

war,  remaining  neutral  in  such  things.  Some  say  this  is

because gnomes are cowards, afraid to become involved

with  the  violent  affairs  of  the  larger  people.  In  fact,

gnomes can show bravery and physical resolve that would put

larger folk to shame, but they are careful to pick their fights.

They remain neutral because wars are usually fought over goals

Prized gems

48

hundred subtle threads woven here and there in the tapestry of

all Faern, no two of them touching another. It is the history

of a hundred hidden villages, clans, and holds, few of them ever

caught up in the great and tragic events of the lands in which

they lie concealed.

The gnomes are sometimes referred to as the Forgotten Folk,

an apt description. Few gnomes have ever graced (or troubled)

the counsels and concerns of the mighty, and even the gnomes

themselves have little sense of what might have befallen their

folk in the past centuries. As far as they know, they have always

been in Faern, and have always lived in secret places and hidden

holdsand they expect to remain much the same in the future.

Gnome, Deep

(Svirfneblin)

Regions: Gnome (deep), The North, Silverymoon.

Racial Prestige Class: Breachgnome.

Level Adjustment: +3. Refer to the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting entry for deep gnome racial abilities.

The  deep  gnomes  are  closest  thing  the  gnome  family  has  to

black  sheep.  Many  surface  dwellers  count  the  deep  gnomes

along with their evil neighbors, the drow and the duergar, believ-

ing them to be little more than dark reflections of the friendly

rock  gnomes  with  whom  they  are  more  familiar.  In  fact,  the

svirfneblin are just as good-hearted as their sunnier kin. How-

ever, after centuries of dealing with the everyday perils of living

in the Underdark, they have become understandably distrustful

of all outsiders.

Compared to their better-known kin, the rock gnomes, the

deep  gnomes  are  as  gray  and  lifeless  as  the  subterranean

caverns in which they choose to make their homes. They keep

to  themselves  out  of  fear  of  outsidersa  fear  born  from

numerous poor experiences with such people. To a deep gnome,

the  only  people  you  can  trust  are  other  deep  gnomes  from

your village, and preferably from your family. All others are

best avoided.

With strangers, most deep gnomes are sullen, reserved, and

suspicious, almost to a fault. However, when they are alone with

their own kind, they are friendly and respectful to each other.

Few  people  from  outside  a  svirfneblin  community  have  ever

seen this more pleasant side of the deep gnomes. For their part,

the deep gnomes would be horrified to find themselves observed

by outsiders, and they find such a person staring at themor

even looking directly at themquite rude.

Deep gnomes are gnarled and callused folk, with little fat at

all  on  their  wiry  bodies.  Their  skin  is  the  color  of  the  rocks

among which they live, almost as if they sprang directly from

the stones themselves. They have dark gray eyes, tending toward

black. Their hair is of a similar color, although its only seen on

the woman, as the men are entirely bald and beardless.

Deep gnomes are short-lived for gnomes and reach adulthood

at an age of 20 years. Use the following aging effect character-

istics instead of the ones in Table 65 in the Players Handbook:

Like  their  lives,  svirfneblin  are  also  short  and  hard.  They

stand between 3 and 3 1/2 feet tall on average. They are thin-

ner than their surface cousins, but they weigh just as much

about  40  to  45  poundsdue  to  the  density  of  their  muscles.

They are little more than wiry sinews and rocklike bones.

History

While  most  gnomes  have  little  use  for  history,  tending  to

prefer living in the moment, deep gnomes are the worst of the

lot. They do not have a formal calendar or any way to tell the

turning of the days. Living far from the light of the sun, the

very  idea  of  night  or  day  is  foreign  to  them.  Dozens  of

svirfneblin  cities  lie  scattered  throughout  the  Underdark  of

Faern, and dozens of more have surely risen and been aban-

doned over the years, but of all these settlements and refuges

the  story  of  only  one  is  widely  known  to  non-deep  gnomes:

Blingdenstone.

Blingdenstone was founded in 690 DR by several clans of

deep gnomes fleeing west from the Underdark beneath Netheril,

which  had  fallen  into  the  power  of  the  dreadful  phaerimms.

Despite the proximity of a powerful drow city (Menzoberran-

zan) and an equally strong duergar city (Gracklstugh), the deep

gnomes established their city at its site because of the rich veins

of arandur and other exotic metals and minerals. For almost two

thousand  years,  the  deep  gnomes  carried  on  their  mining  and

smithing, avoiding their evil neighbors and strengthening Bling-

denstones  defenses  against  the  day  their  enemies  would  come

against them.

That day came in 1338 DR, although King Schnicktick and

Queen Fricknarti could not have anticipated how it would come

about.  Drizzt  DoUrden,  a  renegade  drow  noble,  arrived  at

Blingdenstones doorstep after years of exile in the Underdark,

and  received  sanctuary  among  the  deep  gnomes.  Although

Drizzt remained among the deep gnomes for only a short time,

the events of his exile eventually led to a full-scale drow attack

against the dwarven citadel of Mithral Hall in 1358 DR. The

invasion  route  passed  close  to  Blingdenstone,  and  the  deep

gnomes chose to abandon their city. After the drow army passed,

Belwar  Dissengulp  and  other  deep  gnome  wardens  convinced

King Schnicktick to join their forces to those of the defenders

of  Mithral  Hall.  The  deep  gnomes  and  their  allies  inflicted  a

great defeat on Menzoberranzan in the Keepers Dale, and the

Menzoberranyr  never  forgot  that  the  svirfneblin  had  con-

tributed to their humiliation.

In  Marpenoth  of  1370  DR,  the  Matron  Mothers  of  Men-

zoberranzan exacted their vengeance. Calling up dozens of pow-

erful  demons  and  bebiliths,  they  unleashed  a  plague  of

murderous  fiends  that  overran  Blingdenstone.  Thousands  of

gnomes  died  in  the  fall  of  the  city,  and  thousands  more  were

captured by drow slavers waiting outside the city gates. A small

number of the deep gnomes managed to escape to Mithral Hall

and  Silverymoon  as  refugees.  Driven  from  their  old  homes,

these  svirfneblin  have  found  a  warm  welcome  among  their

former allies, but the prospect for returning to their old home

looks bleak at best.

Outlook

Dour and cynical, deep gnomes are resigned to their lot in life.

They spend their days scratching out a living in the subterranean

49

GNOMES

passages near their home. The males mostly mine for precious

gems, while the femaleswho are rarely seen outside their vil-

lagesgather food, care for the children, and keep house. Few

aspire  to  do  anything  other  than  live  out  their  lives  quietly

focusing on doing their jobs the best that they can.

The svirfneblin literally have little or no light in their lives.

To  avoid  detection  by  others  in  the  Underdark,  they  often

refuse  to  use  fire  for  cooking  or  warmth  whenever  possible.

Instead, they rely on their darkvision whenever possible, seeing

the world only in black and white. The deep gnomes live and

work in the eternal darkness out of their overwhelming love

for gems. Most males spend almost their entirely lives trying

to  chip  precious  stones  out  of  the  earth.  They  favor  rubies

most of all.

Outsiders often think of deep gnomes as irredeemably sullen

and suspicious. While there is some basis for this, these are the

outward results of survival techniques that these gnomes have

had  to  adopt  to  endure  their  harsh  and  unforgiving  environ-

ment. Sounds of any kindespecially voicestravel in strange

ways in the Underdark, and they have a tendency to attract vis-

itors.  In  the  experience  of  most  deep  gnomes,  such  outsiders

have only the worst of intentions, so when a svirfneblin encoun-

ters a stranger who is actually friendly, she normally is too sus-

picious to even consider responding in a like manner. She may

eventually warm to a svirfneblin from another town, but even

this can take time.

While deep gnome adventurers are rare, some deep gnomes

succumb to gnomish curiosity about the world outside the cav-

erns and mine shafts of their daily lives. This is especially true

for those deep gnome illusionists who crave to learn more about

the  nature  of  their  chosen  school  of  magic,  but  who  lack  for

instruction in the insular villages in which they live. Svirfneblin

prospectors are also occasionally encountered in the Underdark

far from their homes, questing for promising new veins to mine

for their beloved rubies.

DEEP GNOME CHARACTERS

Svirfneblin  are  rarely  found  outside  their  own  society.  When

this does happen, its usually a lone prospector, a solitary illu-

sionist, or a group of warriors who have struck out from their

town  for  one  reason  or  another.  Typically  deep  gnomes  only

leave their home out of a deep and abiding curiosity about the

outside world, a burning desire to find more rubies, or the need

to  find  help  for  dealing  with  some  creature  or  event  the

svirfneblin dont feel they can handle on their own. Svirfneblin

adventurers  are  most  commonly  fighters,  rangers,  rogues,  or

wizards (particularly illusionists). Naturally stealthy, they find

that the skills honed in surviving the dangers of the Underdark

also serve an adventuring ranger or rogue well.

Favored Class: Like all gnomes, svirfneblin are talented wiz-

ards, especially illusionists. With an illusionists powers, the deep

gnome can keep out of sight of others until she decides to reveal

herself. She can remain concealed, hide her home and friends,

and deceive or misdirect enemies. Svirfneblin have learned that

an enemy who cant locate them cant hurt them.

Prestige  Classes:  Some  of  the  burlier  deep  gnomes  excel  in

fighting in the tight spaces found in and around a svirfneblin

town and aspire to become breachgnomes, fighters charged with

the defense of their cavern homes. In a properly sized tunnel, a

breachgnome can hold off an invading force almost indefinitely.

See the breachgnome prestige class in the appendix.

Deep Gnome Society

Deep  gnome  communities  are  subterranean  settlements  deep

beneath the surface of Toril. The central part of the city is usu-

ally set in a single large cavern with all sorts of other caverns,

rooms,  and  even  buildings  attached  to  the  main  section  by  a

complex  system  of  narrow  corridors  and  spiraling  staircases.

When a town is first settled, the top-ranking members of the

svirfneblin  clan  usually  grab  the  largest  stalagmites  in  the

cavern  and  carve  homes  out  of  them.  Most  people,  however,

must carve their homes out of the cavern floors or walls.

For gnome communities, deep gnome towns are large, usually

comprising around one thousand people. However, these places

are normally far more isolated than even the most remote sur-

face gnome town. Most svirfneblin go their entire lives without

ever traveling to another deep gnome town, much less actually

seeing daylight. Because of the relatively crowded conditions in

a deep gnome town, svirfneblin families typically crowd into a

single,  small  room.  Children  often  stay  with  the  family  until

they  are  married,  at  which  point  they  need  to  either  find  or

make a new home for themselves.

Deep  gnome  children  are  treasured  greatly.  Its  rare  for  a

family to have more than six children in it, and most have less

than four. Deep gnome mothers dote on their children during

their childhood. Once the children reach adolescence, they are

immediately put to work in apprenticeships for whatever kinds

of jobs they expect to have in adulthood. Deep gnomes dont cel-

ebrate the transition to adulthood the way their sunlit kin do.

Instead, they know theyve reached adulthood when they start

working at the job of a real adult in earnest.

The great majority of male svirfneblin work in their towns

mining  operations,  extracting  precious  gems  and  metals  from

the earth. Most of the rest spend their time processing and fin-

ishing the raw materials the others pull from the earth. By con-

trast,  female  svirfneblin  spend  their  time  gathering  and

preparing food, raising children, and keeping house. There is a

strict division of labor along gender lines, and its rare to see it

crossed: The female gnomes rule in the home and the males out-

side it. Most deep gnomes work until they literally drop dead at

their jobs. There is no concept of retirement in deep gnome soci-

ety. Those who are able must pull their own weight as best they

can, since no deep gnome wishes to be a burden on her family

and community.

In keeping with the svirfneblin concept of equal division of

labor, every svirfneblin town is governed by both a king and a

queen, each of whom holds the position for life. The king over-

sees the communitys mining operations and is responsible for

managing the places defense. The queen ensures that the town

has an adequate stock of both food and water, and she handles

the towns daily affairs. Each is supreme in his or her sphere,

though each usually advises the other. The two are rarely mar-

ried (at least, not to each other). When either monarch dies, the

other chooses a successor for the deceased monarch by deciding

on a contest that can be entered by any eligible member of the

community. Usually eligibility is based on gender and status. The

winner of the contest becomes the next monarch.

The staples of the deep gnome diet are a number of different

kinds of fungi found or even farmed in the Underdark. To this,

they sometimes add blind fish or occasionally a deep roth, goat,

or sheep. Svirfneblin do not often cook their food, preferring

instead  to  preserve  it  by  means  of  salting.  These  foods  are  so

salty that most outsiders cannot stomach them.

50

GNOMES

Besides  water,  svirfneblin  drink  a  salty,  intoxicating  brew

made  of  fermented  fish  parts,  which  is  best  described  as  an

acquired  taste.  On  special  occasions,  they  drink  a  wine  called

Gogondy, said to contain powdered ruby (among other mysteri-

ous ingredients).

Svirfneblin have only two holidays universally celebrated by

all  deep  gnome  communities,  both  in  honor  of  Callarduran

Smoothhands, their favored god. The Festival of the Ruby cel-

ebrates the mythical time when Callarduran hid rubies and other

gems in the earth for the deep gnomes to find; it is considered

a lucky day for seeking and finding. The Festival of the Star cel-

ebrates the continued protection the Deep Brother provides to

the svirfneblin. Deep gnomes mark the holy day by assembling

on  the  shore  of  a  subterranean  lake  or  pool  to  watch  small

patches of a specially bred species of phosphorescent fungi in the

cavern roof light up like stars, creating an illusion of the night

sky reflected in the waters below. This ceremony reaffirms the

deep gnomes ancestral ties with the surface world, and reassures

them that they have not been abandoned in the deep places of

the world.

Language and Literacy

Svirfneblin speak Gnome, Undercommon, and whatever tongue

is used by those on the surface of their region. Those who deal

with outsiders often pick up a bit of Common as well. Given the

nature  of  their  closest  neighbors  in  the  Underdark,  its  not

uncommon for deep gnome linguists to also learn languages like

Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Illuskan, and Terran.

All deep gnome characters are literate except for barbarians.

Magic and Lore

Illusion  is  the  favorite  magic  of  every  gnome,  but  for  the

svirfneblin,  its  essential  to  survival.  The  deep  gnomes  know

more than simple invisibility spells. Delving into the cracks of

the earth has uncovered many strange creatures, and lost lore

from ancient empires. The deep gnomes treasure the powerful

magic items, spellbooks, and other relics of bygone ageseven

if they dont completely understand how to use them.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Deep gnomes become illusionists more than any other class. They

also favor divination spells to help them discover the location of

materials they are hunting for under the surface of the planet,

and conjurations to bring earth elementals to lend them aid.

Spellcasting  Tradition:  Obviously,  most  deep  gnomes  are

illusionists.  Even  those  who  dont  specialize  in  the  Illusion

school sometimes take the Svirfneblin Figment Master feat

(see  the  appendix),  as  do  clerics  and  other  spellcasters  who

dont specialize.

DEEP GNOME MAGIC ITEMS

Deep gnomes favor items that improve their ability to cast illu-

sions and find valuable mineral deposits. They are the source of

many magic items in jewelry form, such as necklaces of fireballs

Deep gnomes summon an earth elemental

51

GNOMES

and amulets of natural armor, their inveterate mining having pro-

vided the raw materials needed to create these prized trade goods.

Common Magic Items: Deep gnomes are particularly adept at

making  gems  into  magic  items.  Any  magic  item  that  consists

entirely of precious stone, such as gems of seeing and ioun stones,

can  be  acquired  among  the  svirfneblin  at  10%  less  than  the

normal cost.

Iconic Magic Item: On special occasions, deep gnomes break

out  the  Gogondy, a  prized,  crimson-colored  wine  said  to  grant

visions  to  those  who  drink  it.  Few  can  have  more  than  a  few

draughts  of  this  heady  (and  expensive)  stuff  without  keeling

over (see the appendix).

Deep Gnome Deities

While the deep gnomes of Toril may not be particularly devout

as a group, they do have a full pantheon of deities they share

with the other gnomes. Svirfneblin clerics often move among

both miners and mothers, keeping up community spirits. When

they  think  the  time  is  ripe,  they  declare  a  holiday  festival  in

honor of whichever god they feel is appropriate.

Callarduran Smoothhands, the Master of Stone, is the most

popular  god  among  deep  gnomes,  many  of  whom  spend  their

entire  adult  lives  working  in  their  towns  mines.  Callarduran

taught the svirfneblin to summon and befriend earth elemen-

tals.  Many  deep  gnome  craftsmen  work  Callardurans  star

insignia into their jewelry and other handiwork. They are care-

ful not to use this theme with a golden ring, however, reserving

that privilege for the god himself.

Although  he  is  the  patriarch  of  the  gnome  pantheon,  few

deep gnomes are drawn to the faith of Garl Glittergold. Garls

bright and sunny nature simply does not seem relevant to most

svirfneblin. Some svirfneblin even feel that Garl has abandoned

them in favor of their more cheery kin. Deep gnomes feel closer

to Segojan Earthcaller, beloved by those deep gnomes who keep

pets or work with their few domesticated animals (these are usu-

ally svirfneblin females, of course). The rare deep gnome ranger

usually finds this gods way with nature to his taste as well.

No gnomes really care for Urdlen, but he particularly fright-

ens  the  svirfneblin.  Tales  of  Urdlens  habit  of  attacking  espe-

cially  greedy  deep  gnomes  just  as  they  are  about  to  grasp  the

most valuable gem ever seen are commonly told to young deep

gnomes to keep them in line. Such parables also illustrate the

number  of  quick  and  senseless  deaths  that  await  deep  gnomes

throughout the Underdark. Only constant vigilance against such

threats does any good and, for encouraging them to always be

alert, Urdlen has earned the deep gnomes respect.

Relations with Other Races

Insular and suspicious, deep gnomes do not get along well with

any other races. If forced to pick with whom they would rather

keep company (outside other deep gnomes or no one at all), most

deep gnomes would choose to associate with forest gnomes, and

then  rock  gnomes.  Beyond  that,  they  might  not  mind  gold

dwarves or shield dwarves, or the occasional elf.

Svirfneblin do not have much feeling about any of the other

standard character races, other than a general aversion to all of

them. However, they have a deep and abiding hatred for drow

and duergar. These two races, with whom the deep gnomes share

the Underdark, have long been a thorn in the side of a people

who  would  much  rather  just  be  left  alone.  Also,  the  evil  ten-

dencies of these races have led many surface dwellers to think

that all who live in the Underdark are unrepentantly evil, a prej-

udice that frequently causes the deep gnomes grief when they

first encounter an ignorant intruder from the surface.

DEEP GNOME EQUIPMENT

Svirfneblin decorate their possessions with gems theyve mined

themselves, and their smiths and jewelers are among the best in

the Underdark.

The deep gnomes have also turned mushroom farming into a

science.  Through  arcane  experimentation  and  careful  cross-

breeding,  theyve  grown  species  of  mushrooms  that  provide

leathery fabric, woody stems, and any number of other useful

materials.

ARMS AND ARMOR

In  battle,  most  svirfneblin  favor  light  picks  of  the  sort  they

carry with them constantly and use in their daily work in the

mines. Female deep gnomes use hoes or other domestic imple-

ments for defense in an emergency. For ranged weapons, they

prefer regular darts as well as the special kinds described below.

Some also carry light crossbows for such work.

Unique Items: Svirfneblin manufacture and use a number of

specialized weapons particular to their race, including acid darts,

crystal caltrops, stun darts, and flash grenades (see the appen-

dix).  The  latter  are  particularly  effective  against  the  deep

gnomes drow enemies.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Deep gnomes often keep a herd of deep roth, goats, or sheep

somewhere  on  the  edge  of  their  towns.  They  tend  them  cau-

tiously, always taking care to make sure the animals remain as

silent as possible. The svirfneblin do not want their animals to

attract unwanted visitors.

As  for  pets,  most  deep  gnomes  dont  keep  them.  There  are

some who have a few, small, blind fish in a glass bowl. Others

might actually have moles, shrews, bats, dire rats, or cavvekans

(see the appendix) as animal friends, although these live nearby

the gnomes home, not actually in it.

Level Adjustment: +1.

If  deep  gnomes  are  thought  by  some  the  black  sheep  of  the

gnome family (a title more fittingly reserved for the spriggans),

then  forest  gnomes  are  the  shy  cousins.  They  are  so  reclusive

that many times bigger people have discovered them, only to

find  that  the  forest  gnomes  have  been  living  nearby  for  cen-

turies. Forest gnomes are so quiet and painfully shy that they go

to great lengths to avoid contact with others unless there is a

great need to break their silence.

52

GNOMES

Whereas the rock gnomes are friendly and loquacious and the

deep gnomes are sullen and reserved, the forest gnomes are prac-

tically  invisible,  the  wallflowers  of  the  gnomes.  They  have  a

great  love  for  nature,  particularly  deep  and  quiet  forests  far

from civilization or even anyone elses homes. For this reason,

many  peopleincluding  other  kinds  of  gnomeshave  never

seen a forest gnome.

Most  forest  gnomes  are  extremely  private,  preferring  to

simply be left alone by other peoples. When among their own

kind, they are a bit less reserved. They see themselves as care-

takers of the forests in which they live, and about the only way

to be sure to trigger a forest gnome attack is to directly harm

their beloved forest.

Forest gnomes are the smallest of the gnomes, averaging only

2 to 2 1/2 feet tall. Even the tallest forest gnome is less than 3

feet. They usually weigh around 25 to 30 pounds. Unlike other

gnomes, they wear their hair and beards long, often almost to

their feet when unbound. The males often trim their beards to

a fine point or curl them into hornlike spikes extending to either

side of their faces. Their skin is the color of bark, and their eyes

are usually brown or blue. Their hair is brown or black, becom-

ing gray or white with age.

Forest  gnomes  can  live  nearly  400  years  on  average,

although some make it quite a bit further. They use the follow-

History

The forest gnomes have had even less impact upon the history

of  Faern  than  the  deep  gnomes  or  rock  gnomes.  They  have

likely  saved  several  forests  from  aggressive  logging  for  cen-

turies, but their efforts are infrequently acknowledged since they

are rarely, if ever, seen. Among themselves, they often mark the

years by significant events (both good and ill) that befell their

village  or  the  forest  in  which  they  live,  but  these  details  are

often trivial and mean little to outsiders.

Outlook

The vast majority of forest gnomes would simply like to be left

alone to enjoy the beauty of their wooded homes. They are not

particularly distrustful of people outside their villages, nor do

they hate those who treat the woods with respect. However, they

just dont see how such people could have much interest in them

and their simple way of life.

Most forest gnomes encountered outside their homes are illu-

sionists, although clerics and druids sometimes show themselves

as well at great need. The illusionists help to conceal the gnomes,

their homes, and their efforts from the outside world. The cler-

ics and druids take great pains to help maintain the health of the

gnomes forest home.

Most forest gnomes see no reason to ever leave their homes,

but  sometimes  doing  so  becomes  unavoidable.  Adventuring

forest gnomes may be hunting for a solution to some problem

back home or hoping to learn more about the surrounding area

so that they can defend their community against threats they

would otherwise know nothing about.

FOREST GNOME CHARACTERS

Few forest gnomes take up adventuring professions, instead con-

centrating on craftsmanship or forestry and becoming experts

with the appropriate skills. They enjoy songs of all sorts and a

few make good (if shy) bards. Forest gnomes have a reverent

nature and do well as clerics or druids, but no forest gnome con-

siders himself a warrior, and gnomes who take classes such as

fighter or ranger are almost nonexistent. Due to their small size

and stealthy natures, forest gnomes make good rogues, serving

as scouts and spies for their isolated communities. Forest gnomes

study  the  arcane  arts  as  their  most  effective  defense  against

bigger  folk  who  would  otherwise  overrun  them,  and  many

become wizards specialized in the school of Illusion.

Favored Class: Most forest gnome adventurers are illusionists,

making  that  their  favored  class.  However,  clerics  are  a  close

second. Cleric/illusionists, cleric/fighters, and illusionist/rogues

are common multiclass combinations.

Forest Gnome Society

Life as a forest gnome is idyllic. They eat only that which they

can gathermostly fruits, nuts, and berries, with the rare bit

of meat. Forest gnome communities often number fewer than

100 members and can be as small as a single family. The homes

in these hamlets are often carved out of the trunk of a hand-

some hardwood tree, so skillfully fashioned that most people do

not even recognize the living tree as someones home (Survival

DC 20 to detect the forest gnome abode); forest gnome druids

long  ago  learned  how  to  create  such  homes  without  harming

the tree. These homes are often hundreds of feet apart, giving

the families plenty of privacy from even each other. The inte-

riors of these places consist of several tiny rooms stacked up

atop each other and connected by trapdoors and ladders. Each

room is only about 4 feet tall, making visiting uncomfortable

for the larger peoples without magical aid. Most of these cylin-

drical rooms have windows to let in the sun, but these are so

cleverly  disguised  as  to  make  them  nearly  impossible  to  find

from the outside.

The community normally gathers in underground chambers,

usually excavated in the local soil and shored up with stones and

beams. Each home in these hamlets is connected to the chamber

by  a  narrow  tunnel  just  wide  enough  for  a  full-grown  forest

gnome to slip through.

Most forest gnomes spend their day tending to the forest and

gathering food. A few search for gems undergroundthey prize

emeralds above all elsewhile others craft jewelry of extraor-

dinary  quality.  The  designs  in  forest  gnome  jewelry  are  filled

with themes related to their woodland home: flowers, trees, local

animals, and the like.

Forest gnome children are allowed to do as they like. Often

they spend their days playing within arms reach of their par-

ents,  watching  how  their  elders  treat  the  environment  in

which they live. These children learn how to behave by way of

53

GNOMES

example, and this results in a quiet and near religious reverence

for the teeming life of the forests that surround them. Forest

gnomes respect their elders, and the eldest member of the com-

munity  is  usually  the  person  in  charge  of  it,  regardless  of

gender. They have little in the way of politicsthe patriarch

or matriarch simply acts as a wise advisor most of the time.

Otherwise, the forest gnomes only act as a group when they

have  a  clear  consensus  on  what  course  of  action  they  might

wish to take.

Outside  their  homes,  forest  gnomes  are  solitary.  If  two  or

more are together, they form an insular group, often whisper-

ing among themselves at the slightest event. In such cases, the

eldest forest gnome present is the nominal leader.

Language and

Literacy

Forest  gnomes  speak  Common,  Gnome,

and  Sylvan.  If  they  pick  up  an  additional

language, its often Elven, but it could just

as well be Halfling, Treant, or the human

language of the surrounding region. Those

forest  gnomes  who  fight  to  defend  their

homes  sometimes  pick  up  a  bit  of  Dra-

conic, Goblin, or Orc too, just so they can

converse  with  their  attackers  andif

possiblespy on them.

Forest gnomes have a special ability to

speak  with  animals  at  will.  They  make

good use of this talent, persuading forest

animals  to  observe  intruders  and  report

any trouble in the woodlands.

All forest gnome characters are literate,

except  for  barbarians.  The  next  forest

gnome barbarian one meets is likely to

be the first and may well be the last.

Introduction.

Forest Gnome

Magic and Lore

Like all gnome wizards, forest gnomes prefer illusions to any

other school of magic. These reclusive people prefer to use these

spells to conceal the existence of themselves and their homes. If

someone  does  come  near,  forest  gnome  illusionists  often  use

other illusions to distract the intruder and draw her away from

the forest gnome community. When a forest gnome does have

to  speak  with  outsiders,  he  typically  uses  illusions  to  disguise

himself as a member of the intruders own race, the

better to hide his fellow gnomes proximity.

Clerics  are  more  important

to forest gnomes than any other

gnome subrace. These spellcast-

ers use their power to help tend

to the forest in which they live.

They often offer healing to ani-

mals, especially those who have

been  injured  by  a  hunters

arrows or traps.

Forest gnomes also make nat-

ural  druids.  Their  reclusive

manner  and  their  respect  for

nature  fits  in  well  with  the

druidic traditions. However, few

are  extroverted  enough  to  join

up with a druidic society. Those

that  do  manage  often  find  it

well  worth  the  effort,  as  they

then  become  more  effective  at

preserving  their  forest  home

than ever before.

Forest  gnomes  have  all  the  gnome  traits

listed  in  the  Players  Handbook,  except  as

follows:

+4 racial bonus on Hide checks. This increases to +8 in forest

settings.  (This  is  in  addition  to  the  Hide  bonus  for  their

Small size.)

Almost all forest gnome spellcasters are illu-

sionists,  clerics,  or  druids.  Forest  gnome

magic tends to have the same character as the forest gnomes

themselves:  unobtrusive  but  effective  in  the  background.

Accordingly, they favor utility spells with long durations, leav-

ing the flashier illusions for their rock gnome cousins.

A forest gnome avoids Big Folk

+1 racial bonus on attacks against kobolds, orcs, goblinoids, and

reptilian humanoids.

Automatic Languages: Common, Gnome, Sylvan. Bonus Lan-

guages: Draconic, Elven, Goblin, Halfling, Treant, and Orc.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willpass  without  trace and  speak

with animals. Treat these abilities as spells cast by a druid of

the forest gnomes character level. These abilities are in addi-

tion  to  the  standard  gnome  ability  to  cast  certain  cantrips.

The gnome can only use these abilities on himself, not some-

one else.

Favored Class: Illusionist.

Level  Adjustment:  +1.  Forest  gnomes  are  significantly  more

stealthy than other characters and possess useful spell-like abil-

ities.  They  are  slightly  more  powerful  and  gain  levels  more

Spellcasting  Tradition:  Forest  gnomes  find  phantasm  spells

particularly useful, so they often take the Forest Gnome Phan-

tasist feat (see the appendix).

Forest Gnome Deities

Forest gnomes are the most devout of all the gnomes, their rev-

erence for their natural surroundings transferring quite easily to

the gods who created it all. Forest gnome priests always lead off

every gathering of forest gnomes with a solemn blessing. Often,

such a priest is the glue that keeps the distant members of his

community connected.

54

GNOMES

Baervan  Wildwanderer  is  the  patron  deity  of  most  forest

gnomes. As his last name suggests, this god is most comfortable

in the remote places the forest gnomes call home. He has per-

sonally  charged  them  with  the  care  of  their  pristine  homes,

and  for  this  they  owe  him  their  undying  gratitude.  It  is  a

burden they have gladly shouldered. Clerics of Baervan often

advise their fellows on the careful husbandry and stewardship

over the forest.

The faith of Segojan Earthcaller is also popular among the

forest gnomes. Segojan taught them their undying respect for

their closest friends, the animals with whom they share their

forests.  Many  forest  gnomes  warriors  wear  armor  covered

with grass and roots to demonstrate their veneration for the

Earthcaller.

To  forest  gnomes,  Urdlen  represents  the  great  unknown,

everything above, around, or even below their forest homesin

other  words,  the  things  of  which  the  forest  gnomes  are  most

frightened. Still, on a sunny day in the forest, Urdlen and the

fears he represents seem far off. The god apparently appreciates

the work the forest gnomes do to preserve their homes, because

he rarely enters them.

Relations with Other Races

Its not that forest gnomes wouldnt get along with other races.

They simply avoid them so much that they rarely have much of

a chance to interact with them at all. When they do meet pleas-

ant and respectful outsiders, forest gnomes can usually rise to

the occasion, however shyly. If given a chance, they can be the

most steadfast of friends.

Those forest gnomes who have encountered outsiders prefer

rock gnomes, elvesparticularly wood elves and wild elvesand

halflings  (especially  ghostwise  halflings)  to  all  others.  This  is

because  these  races  share  the  respect  that  the  forest  gnomes

have for their natural surroundings.

As for the other standard character races, the forest gnomes

dont  know  or  care  much  about  them.  However,  they  have  a

long-standing  hatred  for  orcs,  kobolds,  and  lizardfolk,  based

upon the way these races abuse the forest and nature in general.

They are also somewhat suspicious of humans, as human loggers,

trappers,  and  hunters  have  damaged  more  than  one  forest

despite the forest gnomes best efforts.

Forest Gnome Equipment

Forest gnomes have no unusual racial equipment, although in

their armaments they favor bludgeoning weapons. Having seen

axes  used  on  far  too  many  trees,  forest  gnomes  despise  these

weaponsand sometimes those who use them.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Forest gnomes do not keep cattle or pets of any kind. The ani-

mals of the forest are their friends, not creatures to be preyed

upon  or  domesticated.  They  have  been  known  to  strike  up

friendships  with  all  natural  creatures  of  the  forest,  although

they favor those closer to their own size, like foxes, squirrels,

and the like.

Forest Gnome Region

Forest  gnomes  are  reclusive,  and  as  a  result,  most  of  them

simply take the Forest Gnome region detailed below.

Preferred Classes: Bard, cleric, druid, wizard. A character of

one  of  these  classes  may  choose  a  regional  feat  and  gain  his

forest gnome character of any other class may not select one of

the regional feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment

at 1st level.

Rock gnomes are the gnomes that most people are familiar with,

so  much  so  that  when  someone  says  a  gnome,  he  or  she  is

almost always speaking of a rock gnome. Unlike their reclusive

cousins,  the  deep  gnomes  and  the  forest  gnomes,  the  rock

gnomes  are  an  inquisitive  and  loquacious  people.  They  are

renowned  throughout  Faern  as  technicians,  alchemists,  and

inventors, as well as illusionists of the highest order. They do not

care much for living in larger cities, where their talents are in

high demand, and prefer the rolling hills of the countryside. But

anywhere they find themselves, they display an amazing zest for

life and all the pleasures it holds.

Rock gnomes are far friendlier and more outgoing than the

other  gnome  kindreds.  They  are  well  known  for  their  love  of

jokes  and  pranks,  as  well  as  their  fondness  for  finely  made

things.  As  with  all  gnomes,  they  adore  gems  of  all  kinds,  but

rock gnomes have a particular passion for the purity and per-

fection of the diamond.

Rock gnomes average between 3 and 3 1/2 feet tall, and weigh

between 40 and 45 pounds. Their skin comes in many different

shades of brown, but is unaffected by exposure to the sun. The

hair of young gnomes can vary greatly in color, but in adulthood

they all tend toward gray or white. The males wear their beards

neatly trimmed.

From  a  rock  gnomes  point  of  view,  life  is  meant  to  be

enjoyed in all its facets: work, play, and otherwise. Again, its the

process thats important, not the goal, even if those goalslike,

say,  finely  cut  gemsdo  end  up  being  valuable  on  their  own.

This shows in just about everything a rock gnome does, from

making a meal to working a mine to playing a practical joke.

The care they put into their actions always shines through.

Young  rock  gnomes  have  carefree  childhoods.  During  their

adolescence, rock gnomes are expected to learn the basics of a

useful trade and to master the basics of self-defense. They are

encouraged  to  dabble  in  all  sorts  of  pastimes  until  they  find

something that perfectly fits their temperaments. They come of

age at 40, an occasion for the largest party of their lives. From

55

GNOMES

there, the average life expectancy is about 350 years, although

some have been known to reach 500 years in age.

History

The  rock  gnomes  are  counted  as  one  of  the  major  races  of

Faern. Although they may not be as populous or influential as

some of the other races, there are gnomes scattered throughout

the continent. Gnomes have played a large part in the develop-

ment of firearms in Faern, and they are acknowledged as the

masters of these tricky items.

There has never been such a thing as a gnome empire or even

a country. If gnomes can be said to have a homeland, it would

have to be the islands of Lantan, far to the southwest

of  the  main  continent.  Of  course,  few

gnomes  have  ever  been  to  Lantan  or

know  more  about  it  than  what

theyve  heard  in  the  legends

passed  down  to  them  by  their

ancestors.

Outlook

Rock gnomes are generally opti-

mistic. They view the world as a

puzzle  that  the  godsin  their

infinite  wisdomhave  laid  out

before them as the ultimate chal-

lenge, one that cannot ever be fully met.

It  is  their  greatest  joy  to  be  involved  in

the unraveling of the mysteries of creation, an

act they feel brings them closer to the gods with

each passing day.

In their adolescence, rock gnomes are encouraged

to dabble in as many different things as possible.

Eventually,  they  find  something  that  truly

intrigues  them,  fires  their  imaginations,  and

sets them on the path of a career that may last

them the rest of their lives. Almost every rock

gnome enjoys what she does for a living, which is

one of the reasons that they have such positive dispositions.

Of course, rock gnomes enjoy their leisure time at least as

much  as  their  work.  They  are  known  for  hosting  wild  cele-

brations on the thinnest of pretenses. When they really have

a  reason  for  cheer,  the  parties  have  been  known  to  last  for

tendays.

While  most  gnomes  are  homebodies  at  heart,  a  number

simply cant resist the urge to go out into the world to explore.

Inquisitive  by  nature,  gnomes  often  find  themselves  almost

compelled  to  do  everything  they  can  to  learn  about  anything

they want. Others, the greedier ones, set off in search of fame

and fortune. Sadly, these are fleeting dreams, as even the most

famous of gnomes is usually just another member of her com-

munity when she returns home.

ROCK GNOME CHARACTERS

Rock gnome characters with close ties to their communities are

often clerics, wizards, or rangers (although their low Strength

score  means  that  theyll  likely  favor  ranged  combat).  Rock

gnomes  infected  with  wanderlust  almost  always  become  bards

(often  supplementing  their  performances  with  their  extra

gnome spells) and rogues.

Favored Class: The rock gnomes favored class is the illusion-

ist, for which there are two reasons. First, an illusionist can do

a great deal to help hide the homes of his people, granting them

the privacy they crave and the safety they require. Gnomes are

not the match of most other races on an open battlefield, and

they know this. Theyre smart enough to take every edge they

can get.

Second, illusionists have the most entertaining of magics at

their  disposal.  The  finest  ones  can  actually  tell  visual  stories

with  their  illusions,  creating  a  new  kind  of  art  form

that  is  exclusive  to  illusionists  and  favored  by

gnome practitioners of that arcane art.

Prestige Classes: Some of the braver and

stronger rock gnomes excel in fighting in

the  tight  spaces  in  the  tunnels  in  their

underground  homes.  In  such  spaces,  a

breachgnome  can  hold  off  an  invad-

ing  force  almost  indefinitely.  See

the breachgnome prestige class in

the appendix.

Rock Gnome

Society

Rock  gnome  life  is  filled  with  long

days of work that stretch on for ten-

days at a time, punctuated by jubi-

lant celebrations in which these

hard-driven workers finally get

to blow off some steam. This is

the kind of life that most gnomes

prize, and they feel blessed by the gods

that they are mostly able to manage it.

Once  a  gnome  reaches  adulthood,  she  is

expected to take up a career and work at it

tirelessly to become the best at it that she

can be. Some gnomes switch vocations later in lifesome do it

several times, in factbut this is relatively rare. The vast major-

ity of gnomes find something they like to do and then stick with

it for as long as they can.

Even on the job, though, gnomes are usually friendly and fun-

loving people. They are constantly telling jokes throughout their

days, many of which leave their coworkers in stitches. Practical

jokes are fine too, as long as they dont disrupt the work envi-

ronment too much. Every gnome loves a good prank, but they

all insist on getting their jobs done too.

Many  gnomes  work  as  miners.  While  they  may  not  be  as

aggressive at it as dwarves, theyre actually much better at get-

ting the most possible out of a vein of ore. Others practice stone-

cutting  or  gemwork.  Their  metalworkers  prefer  to  work  with

softer metalsgold, silver, and so onalthough they do a fine

job with harder materials like steel too. They also make excellent

woodworkers and carpenters. Faernian rock gnomes are among

the finest artisans working in the fields of toymaking, clockwork

engineering, and gunsmithing. Its common for rock gnomes to

be armed with smokepowder pistols.

56

A display of rock gnome gemcutting

GNOMES

Garl  Glittergold  is  the  patriarch  of  the  gnome  gods,  and

patron of the rock gnomes in particular. To look at them, one

might  think  that  most  rock  gnomes  model  their  lives  on

Garls behavior, including the constant tricks he plays on the

other  gods.  Many  gnomes  do  the  same  to  their  friends

whether they are gnomes or not. Clerics of Garl Glittergold

keep  themselves  endlessly  busy  with  the  planning  of  revels,

feasts, and celebrations to bring good cheer, sustenance, and

wisdom to their fellows.

Rock gnomes also venerate Baervan Wildwanderer. The pro-

tector  of  the  forests  and  glades  that  rock  gnomes  call  home,

Baervan is also the patron of gnomish rogues. If theres anyone

who  could  possibly  outdo  Garl  in  the  prank  department,  its

Baervan. The two have been trying to top each other since the

dawn of the gods, and the friendly rivalry is still going on.

Relations with Other Races

Rock gnomes get along famously with almost all the standard

character  races.  They  are  particularly  fond  of  dwarves  of  all

kinds, with whom they share a love of finely wrought jewelry

and mechanical devices. They also have a great love for halflings

who can take a joke. Their common style of housing and their

similar  sizes  would  be  bonds  enough,  but  their  shared  joy  for

living is what really brings them together.

Rock gnomes are a bit more cautious around the larger peo-

ples, but these reservations usually quickly give way to enthusi-

asm when someone shows any sort of interest in or knowledge

about the gnomes work or other passions.

Orcs, kobolds, and goblinoids find an especially cold place in

a rock gnomes heart. Although most rock gnomes find it hard

to hate anyone, long experience with these races has told them

that its better to never cut them any breaks. Besides, none of

them can take a joke.

Rock Gnome Equipment

Rock  gnomes  have  no  unusual  racial  equipment,  but  they  are

outstanding gunsmiths.

Common  Items:  Smokepowder  and  firearms  are  available

among the rock gnomes for 10% less than the standard price.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Rock gnomes befriend many sorts of burrowing animals, such as

moles,  weasels,  badgers,  and  wolverines.  These  small  creatures

serve as watchdogs (and, in the case of badgers or wolverines,

guardians) for gnome households.

Gnome cooking is not much of a draw to outsiders. It tends to

be bland and overcooked or overcooked and over-salted; reliable

gnome-friends claim to have tasted some that was bland and over-

salted, though no one knows quite how the gnome cooks managed

this. Their (salty) bread is unleavened. All gnomes are very fond

of rock candy, and some eat rock salt with equal relish.

Gnomes  do,  however,  make  excellent  brewers  and  vintners.

Many of them are talented musicians as well. These two facts

contribute  greatly  to  the  reputation  of  gnomes  as  wonderful

party guests and even better hosts.

Most  rock  gnome  settlements  are  small.  Its  rare  to  find

one with more than five hundred adults in a widely scattered

area. However, these communities are usually found clustered

close together, usually within a few days or tendays travel of

each other.

Rock gnome burrows are usually small but tidy. Any married

couples have rooms to themselves, but the children usually share

a  single  room.  Adolescents  are  segregated  by  gender,  each  sex

having its own room. Each burrow usually connects to those of

the same clan by tunnel, meaning that many gnomes rarely if

ever have to go outside during a day. This is one reason why

their communities can go unnoticed by the larger peoples for

so long.

When traveling or adventuring, gnomes appear both singly

and  in  small  groups.  These  groups  are  usually  composed  of  a

number of close friends or family members or both.

Language and Literacy

Rock gnomes normally speak Gnome and Common, as well as

whatever language is predominant in their home region. They

often  pick  up  Dwarven  and  Sylvan  because  they  live  in  areas

favored by these races. Additionally, they regularly come into

contact  with  those  who  speak  Chondathan,  Draconic,  Goblin,

Illuskan, and Terran, although this isnt always under the best

of circumstances.

All rock gnomes are literate, except for barbarians.

Rock Gnome

Magic and Lore

Like  all  gnome  wizards,  rock  gnomes  prefer  illusions  to  any

other school of magic. They like to use their illusions in clever

ways to fool or misdirect foes or to entertain friends.

Rock gnomes all have the spell-like ability to speak with ani-

mals, and many rock gnome characters eventually acquire the

Animal Friends feat (see the appendix) to improve this ability.

Spellcasting Tradition: A panoply of illusions available to rock

gnomes makes them incorrigible tricksters. They often take the

Rock Gnome Trickster feat (see the appendix).

Rock Gnome Deities

Rock gnomes are not particularly devout in practice, although

they are forever talking about their gods in conversation. They

attend services about once a tenday, but not with any kind of

fervor. They believe that the gods are with them everywhere,

so its not always so necessary to make the trip to a temple to

see them.

half-elf and a human will be human, unless the half-elf parent

was the child of a full-blooded elf. Unless a half-elven line mar-

ries into other elven or half-elven families, their elf character-

istics fade in a generation or two. On occasion elven traits can

reappear in otherwise human children born several generations

later, but half-elves of such remote descent are very rare.

Racial History

Half-elves have little racial history. Scarce in number and widely

dispersed across the face of Faern, half-elves have left little to

mark their presence. True half-elven cultures have arisen in only

a handful of times and places.

Humans and elves have shared Faern for many thousands of

years,  and  rare  individuals  of  both  elven  and  human  descent

have been around since the time of the Elven Crown Wars or

before. However, it is only within the last dozen centuries that

the  decline  of  the  great  old  elven  kingdoms  and  the  rise  of

human civilization have allowed the two races to blend in any

numbers. The ancient elven kingdoms of Illefarn and Corman-

thyr sheltered large numbers of half-elves in their final days, as

both incorporated rising human lands beneath elven crowns in

the centuries following the raising of the Standing Stone. The

fall of Myth Drannor in 714 DR brought an end to the first of

these blended realms, but by that time Silverymoon was already

rising as a second Myth Drannor in the North.

In Aglarond, the settlement of the Yuirwood by humans in

the 8th and 9th centuries led to the rise of a half-elven folk who

still  thrive  today.  Although  the  mercantile  humans  of  Agla-

ronds coastal cities and the forest-wise rangers of the kingdoms

hidden depths do not always get along, Aglarond stands as the

best example of a half-elven realm in Faern today. Dambrath,

on the other hand, presents an entirely different example. Seven

hundred years ago, the barbaric human kingdom of Dambrath

was  conquered  by  drow  from  a  powerful  city.  Those  who  can

trace  their  descent  to  the  great  drow  families  who  ruled  as

suzerains over their human subjects govern their homeland as

proud overlords. Where half-elven blood is a sign of racial har-

mony (or commerce, at least) in other lands, in Dambrath it is

the legacy of conquest and oppression.

The most prominent of the races of mixed heritage,

half-elves can be found throughout Faern, but have

few lands to call their own. They feel at home both

in  the  sprawling  human  empires  and  the  secretive  elven

retreats,  standing  between  elf  and  human  culture  but  truly

belonging to neither. They are a handsome and even-tempered

race  who  handle  the  challenges  of  their  mixed  heritage  with

grace and reserve.

There are three major subraces of half-elves in Faern: com-

mon half-elves, half-drow, and half-aquatic elves. The common

half-elves are those whose elven parents hail from the moon elf,

sun elf, wild elf, and wood elf peoples. When someone refers to

a half-elf, they are almost certainly referring to a half-elf of this

descent. The half-drow have drow blood in their veins, and are

extremely  rare  except  in  the  most  southerly  lands  of  Faern.

Finally, the half-aquatic elves can be found in small numbers

along any of Faerns coastlines, caught between their human

and their sea-elf heritages.

No true half-elven realms exist in Faern, but half-elves are

far more prevalent in some lands than in others. In the Unap-

proachable East, in the Yuirwood of distant Aglarond, a culture

of common half-elves descended from wild elves, moon elves,

and  Damaran  human  settlers  thrives  beneath  the  Yuirwoods

green boughs. In isolated Dambrath in the south, half-drow rule

over  their  human  neighbors.  Half-elves  are  also  common  in

places where humans and elves have lived alongside each other

peacefully, such as the domain of Silverymoon in the North or

some of the southerly Dales.

Half-elves have at least one elven parent or grandparent, or

two  half-elven  parents.  To  put  it  another  way,  the  child  of  a

Half-Elves

Common half-elves are descended from humans and moon elves,

sun elves, wild elves, or wood elves. While these people can be

found all over Faern, this section describes the half-elf culture

of  Aglarond,  the  land  where  the  largest  number  of  common

half-elves live.

Common half-elves blend human and

elven  features,  influenced  by  the  sub-

race of their elven parent and the eth-

nicity  of  their  human  parent.  Moon

half-elves  have  pale  skin  tinged  bluish

around the ears and chin, framing

their lower faces. Sun half-elves

have bronzed skin, and hair of

gold.  Wild  half-elves  have

brown  skin.  Wood  half-elves

have  coppery  skin  tinged  with

green highlights.

Most common half-elves are a bit dis-

tant, used to being cast in the role of out-

siders. In the Yuirwood, this isnt so: The

half-elves  make  up  the  majority  and

have  a  long  and  proud  history.  Many

half-elves come to the Yuirwood once they

are old enough to leave home. Here, at

last, is a place in which they can hope

to be accepted.

Half-elves  are  more  slender  than

humans, and more heavily built than

elves. Since the elves of Faern are

taller and more sturdily built than

the elves of other worlds, Faern-

ian  half-elves  are  very  close  to

human  size  and  weight.  Use  the

History

The Yuirwood, home to many thousands of half-elves, is located

in  Aglarond  in  the  Unapproachable  East.  The  Yuirwood  was

once  populated  by  a  large  number  of  wood  elves.  In  756  DR,

however, humans arrived in the area and began establishing set-

tlements. At first the two cultures clashed, but they eventually

banded together against the mutual threat of the monsters that

then lived in the woods. The two races living in the Yuirwood

intermingled for centuries, eventually blending to form a true

half-elven culture.

In 1065 DR, the half-elves of the Yuirwood made peace with

the humans living long the coast between their lands and the Sea

59

of  Fallen  Stars,  and  the  nation  of  Aglarond  was  born.  Those

humans who refused to make peace left for the western tip of

the  Aglarondan  peninsula,  and  formed  their  own  country,

Altumbel. Aglarond was ruled by half-elven monarchs for gen-

erations. About fifty years ago, the royal line died out, and the

last queen passed the throne on to her apprentice, the Simbul.

Under her rule, the people of Aglarond prospered in the face of

Thayan aggression, and through their stalwart defense of their

land have forced their powerful neighbors to abandon (at least

temporarily) the dream of expanding to the Sea of Fallen Stars.

The Yuirwood is unique among forests, in that it is impene-

trable  by  detection  and  scrying  magics.  This  has  been  a  great

advantage  to  the  Simbul  and  her

people,  as  it  makes  it  impossible  for

hostile forces to monitor the move-

ment  of  people  and  troops  within

the  forest  that  covers  most  of

Aglarond.  Relkaths  Foot  is  the

largest settlement of half-elves in

the Yuirwood (and all Faern, for

that  matter).  It  is  home  to

some  5,080  people,  most  of

whom are half-elves.

Outlook

While  elves  and  half-elves  are

respected and admired in many

parts  of  Faern,  humans  in

lands  where  elves  are  not  com-

monly encountered can be resent-

ful  of  elven  blood.  Elves  are

graceful,  attractive,  long-lived,

mysterious,  and  skilled  with

mighty magic, and humans who

do  not  know  them  well  can

easily come to regard elvesand,

by extension, half-elveswith envy

and fear. In places such as Silverymoon

or the Dalelands, a half-elfs race is nothing

remarkable, and she faces little or no bigotry. In

lands  where  there  is  a  long  history  of  elven-

human  conflict,  such  as  Tethyr  or  Sembia,  her  elven  blood

marks her as different and dangerous, with all the fears and sus-

picions one might expect.

Many half-elves respond to the suspicions and slights of their

human neighbors by staying well away from human civilization,

preferring a solitary life in the wildernesses of Faern. Others

instead take up a life of travel, never staying in one spot long

enough  for  racial  prejudices  to  distance  them  from  the  folk

around them.

As  the  homeland  of  a  mixed  society  of  elves,  humans,  and

half-elves,  Aglarond  is  unique  among  the  lands  of  Faern.  In

Aglarond,  a  half-elfs  race  is  unremarkable,  and  a  half-elf  is

judged  by  her  own  actions  and  accomplishments,  not  her  kin-

dred. Aglarondan half-elves are a quiet, thoughtful, and courte-

ous folk, slow to befriend outsiders, but unfailingly loyal to the

friends theyve made. Many half-elves from other lands journey

to Aglarond at least once in their lives, and more than a few

remain there, enriching the Simbuls realm.

HALF-ELVES

HALF-ELF CHARACTERS

The  half-elves  of  the  Yuirwood  are  a  diverse  community  who

welcome immigrants. Among them can be found people of every

character  class  and  nearly  every  multiclass  combination,  for

flexibility is a key trait among half-elves.

Favored Class: The highest class a half-elf has is considered to

be his favored class.

Prestige  Classes:  Common  half-elves  can  use  any  prestige

classes  open  to  humans.  They  also  have  access  to  the  arcane

archer,  spellsinger,  and  bladesinger  prestige  classes  (see

the appendix).

Half-Elf Society

Aglarondan  society  is  generally  free  and  open.  Despite  being

caught  between  the  reclusive  people  of  Altumbel  and  the

aggressive zulkirs of Thay, Aglarond has known peace in recent

years. However, the Aglarondans know that the price of their

freedom is eternal vigilance. Only their resolve, courage, and

skill hold Thayan conquest at bay. Any folk of good heart who

are willing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the defense of their

homes  and  their  liberty  are  welcomed  in  Aglarond,  and  over

forty  years  of  the  Simbuls  rule,  Aglarond  has  been  greatly

strengthened  by  the  immigration  of  half-elven  craftsfolk,

foresters, and adventurers.

In  Aglarondan,  humans,  half-elves,  and  elves  live  side  by

side,  each  accepting  of  their  neighbors  ways.  The  half-elves

here reach adulthood at about age 20 and then take on what-

ever role they feel best suited for in their society. Many work

in the woods, hunting wild animals, collecting pelts, harvesting

rare  woods  and  herbs,  and  gathering  nuts  and  berries.  Agla-

rondan foresters take care not to despoil the Yuirwood, and go

to great pains to avoid taking too much game or felling too

many living trees.

Elders are respected in Aglarond for the wisdom they have

presumably gained over the years. Once a half-elf is too old

to work, he is cared for by his family or his village until he

passes on.

When  outside  a  place  like  Aglarond,  half-elves  are  loners

and often keep to themselves. Some treasure the camaraderie

and the sense of family they get when traveling with a group

of adventurers.

Language and Literacy

The  half-elves  of  the  Yuirwood  speak  Common,  Elven,  and

Aglarondan.  Aglarondan  is  a  relatively  young  language  that

developed  from  the  blending  of  Elven  with  the  Damaran

tongue  of  the  human  settlers  who  colonized  the  Yuirwoods

coasts five hundred years ago. For bonus languages, half-elves

often  choose  Chessentan,  Damaran,  Draconic,  Elven,  Mulho-

randi, Orc, or Sylvan.

All common half-elves are literate, except for barbarians.

Half-Elf Magic and Lore

Common half-elves can use the racial spells of both humans

and  elves.  They  have  no  spellcasting  traditions  of  their  own,

however.  Aglarondan  arcane  spellcasters  often  follow  the

Simbul  in  the  choice  of  magical  schools  in  which  she  concen-

trates: Evocation and Transmutation.

Half-Elf Deities

Common half-elves can choose any human or elven deity as

a  patron.  Many  favor  Sune  for  the  love  that  brought  their

parents together. Aglarondan common half-elves favor Chaun-

tea, Selne, Valkur, and the elven pantheon (the Seldarine).

Those  good-aligned  half-drow  who  live  in  Aglarond  have

brought  the  worship  of  the  Lady  of  the  Dance  with  them.

The worship of Eilistraee has spread beyond those with drow

blood in their veins, and many common half-elves who enjoy

midnight  revelriesmostly  bards,  it  has  to  be  saidchoose

Eilistraee as a patron.

Relations with Other Races

The common half-elves of Aglarond get along well with most

of the major races of Faern. They favor their own kind first

and foremost, but they happily work with both humans and

elves too, as well as dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. The half-

elves of Aglarond show a marked tolerance of half-orcs. On

the other hand, Aglarondans are deeply suspicious of Thayans,

Mulhorandi, and Untherites. These old, corrupt empires have

sought to control the Aglarondan peninsula for centuries, and

even though Mulhorand and Unther no longer have territo-

rial  aspirations  in  the  area,  the  free  folk  of  Aglarond  have

long memories.

Half-Elf Equipment

Common half-elves have no unusual racial equipment of their

own. However, they can make use of any equipment or weapons

specific to humans or elves.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Common half-elves often raise animals and keep pets of the sort

that both humans and elves do. Since many Aglarondan half-

elves  are  rangers  or  druids,  they  often  have  unusually  smart,

strong, and loyal animal companions. Wolves, hawks, and eagles

are common in Aglarond.

Half-Aquatic Elves

Regions:  Aglarond,  Dragon  Coast,  Impiltur,  Sembia,  Vilhon

Reach.

Racial Feats: Water Adaptation.

Half-aquatic  elves  have  no  real  society  of  their  own.  Born  of

human and sea elf blood, they are extremely rare, since sea elves

rarely venture into human lands. Normally they live alone or in

small groups along the shore, or they simply take up life in a

human coastal community.

60

HALF-ELVES

Half-aquatic elves have pale green skin. Their hair can be

any human color, but it usually has a faint green or blue cast

to it. As they age, their hair becomes blue-silver. They have

slight webbing between their fingers and toes, making them

excellent swimmers.

Although  they  cannot  breathe  water  like  their  aquatic  elf

ancestors, half-aquatic elves feel drawn to the sea. If they seem

distant  or  aloof,  its  not  because  theyre  ignoring  someone  on

purpose. Theyre always listening to the roar of the nearby surf,

or imagining its sound if they travel far from the sea.

Half-aquatic elves reach the age of majority at 20 years old

and can live over to be over 180 years in age. Since aquatic elves

are larger and heavier than most elves, half-aquatic elves have

the  same  height  and  weight  characteristics  as  a  full-blooded

human.

History

Half-aquatic elves do not have a history as a subrace. They are

simply too rare to ever form a community larger than a thorp

on their own, and even these are almost unheard of. Half-aquatic

elves (or the rare family of half-elves) only meet a handful of

other half-aquatic elves in the course of their lives.

Outlook

Forced  by  nature  to  remain  with  her  air-breathing  parent,  a

half-aquatic  elf  is  cut  offexcept  for  short  visitsfrom  any

aquatic elves with whom she could identify, costing her half of

her heritage. Where some people with such an unusual heritage

would become bitter outcasts, half-aquatic elves instead tend to

be dreamers, content to keep their own company but not resent-

ful of their circumstances. Their human neighbors know much

less  about  aquatic  elves  than  humans  in  other  places  know  of

landbound  elves,  and  therefore  have  little  reason  to  fear  the

half-aquatic elfs elven blood.

HALF-AQUATIC ELF CHARACTERS

Half-aquatic  elves  display  the  half-elven  flexibility  out  of

necessity, for their heritage is forever divided against itself.

Often loners, half-aquatic elves tend to be rogues, sorcerers,

or fighters.

Favored Class: The highest class a half-aquatic elf has is con-

sidered her favored class.

Prestige Classes: Half-aquatic elves can use any prestige classes

open  to  humans.  They  also  have  access  to  the  arcane  archer,

spellslinger, and bladesinger prestige classes.

Half-Aquatic Elf Society

Most half-aquatic elves hail from a beach culture. As children,

they often get their sea legs on the family fishing boat. Some

such elves are fortunate to have aquatic elf parents who care

about  them  and  visit  them  regularly.  When  they  are  on  the

sea, these children have a guardian angel watching them from

the depths.

When  half-aquatic  elves  reach  the  age  of  majorityand

often before thatthey are drawn to the sea. They often work

on fishing boats or as pearl divers. They can swim much faster

than a human, although not even half as fast as a true sea elf,

so  they  find  that  employment  in  and  around  the  water  suits

them well. As they get older, half-aquatic elves find themselves

drawn more and more to the serenity of the sea. More than one

half-aquatic elf has been found alone in her boat, having passed

away from old age while fishing once again.

Language and Literacy

Half-aquatic  elves  speak  Common,  Elven,  and  the  human

tongue of their home region. All half-aquatic elves are literate

except for barbarians, commoners, and warriors.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Half-aquatic elves have all the half-elven racial traits listed in

the Players Handbook, except as follows:

Swim speed 15 feet. An aquatic half-elf gains a +8 racial bonus

on  all  Swim  checks  and  can  always  choose  to  take  10  with

Swim checks, even if rushed or threatened. Aquatic half-elves

can use the run action while swimming, as long as they swim

in a straight line.

Sea Longing: A half-aquatic elf who remains out of sight of

the sea for more than a tenday longs for the sea, suffering

a  1  penalty  on  Wisdom-based  checks  until  she  returns  to

the shore.

Favored Class: Any.

Automatic Languages: Elven, Common, Home Region. Bonus

Languages: Any (except secret languages, such as Druidic).

Half-Aquatic Elf

Magic and Lore

Half-aquatic elves can use the racial spells of both humans and

elves. They have no spellcasting traditions of their own. How-

ever, half-aquatic elf clerics often choose Water or Ocean as one

of their domains. Similarly, half-aquatic elf wizards usually con-

centrate  on  water-oriented  spells.  Water  breathing is  a  true

favorite, as it allows the half-aquatic elf to visit the world of her

watery heritage, even if only for a little while.

Half-Aquatic Elf Deities

Half-aquatic elves can choose any human or elven deity as a

patron. Many who have contact with their aquatic kin worship

Deep  Sashelas,  the  elven  god  of  the  deeps.  Deep  Sashelas  is

even  said  to  bless  unions  between  sea  elves  and  humans

because  they  often  lead  to  a  greater  understanding  between

these two peoples.

A small number of evil half-aquatic elves venerate Umberlee

as their patron. However, all half-aquatic elves respect and fear

this  capricious  goddess,  like  any  who  earn  their  living  from

the sea. She seems to have a fondness for playing with the lives

of half-aquatic elves, these individuals caught between the airy

world and the one below.

61

HALF-ELVES

Relations with Other Races

Half-aquatic  elves  get  along  with  most  of  the  common  races.

They usually prefer the company of humans, but they find elves

of  all  sorts  fascinating.  They  enjoy  the  company  of  dwarves,

gnomes, and halflings as well, and they dont even mind half-

orcs.  Like  their  aquatic  elf  parents,  they  loathe  sahuagin  and

other evil creatures of the sea.

Half-Aquatic Elf

Equipment

Half-aquatic elves have no unusual

racial  equipment  of  their  own.

However, they can make use of any

equipment  or  weapons  special  to

humans or elves. They have a spe-

cial  affinity  for  the  weapons  of

aquatic elves, including spears, nets,

and tridents.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Half-aquatic  elves  keep  animals

or pets as often as any seafaring

humans. Aboard ship, they prefer

cats.  They  like  to  play  with  fish

and  sea  mammals  in  the  surf,

but  they  rarely  domesticate

such creatures.

Half-Drow

Regions: Dambrath, Elf (drow),

Half-drow, the North.

Racial Feats: Drow Eyes.

In  most  lands,  half-drow  are  rare.  Since  so

many  drow  are  irredeemably  evil,  they  only

mate with humans by way of rape or slavery.

The only exception are the half-drow of the land of Dambrath

in the Shining South, who arise from the centuries-old drow sub-

jugation of the human folk of that land.

Half-drow have dusky skin, silver or white hair, and a broad

range of eye colors. They are often just as dark-hearted as their

elven  parents,  but  with  a  bitter  resentment  that  comes  from

knowing that they are considered second-class members of drow

society.  In  human  society,  half-drow  are  distrusted  nearly  as

much as their full-blooded cousins. Despite this, good half-drow

are much less rare than good drow. Whether this has to do with

the influence of their human blood, or the desire to rebel against

the drow who treat them so poorly, is difficult to tell.

Half-drow  use  the  same  age  categories  as  other  half-elves.

They use the standard half-elven height and weight entries from

Table 66 in the Players Handbook.

History

Around 500 years ago, the barbaric human kingdom of Dam-

brath  warred  with  the  powerful  drow  city-state  of  Tlindhet

beneath the nearby Gnollwatch Mountains. When the drow won,

they enslaved the humans of the region. Over the course of sev-

eral human generations, the conquering dark elves took human

lovers  from  their  slaves,  resulting  in  a  large  number  of  half-

drow. Today, such people make up about 15% of the countrys

population.

In time, the ruling drow nobles came to spend less and less

time on the surface, returning to

their subterranean city and leav-

ing  their  surface  conquests  in

the  hands  of  their  half-breed

children.  The  great  Houses  of

Tlindhet  carved  up  the  broad

lands  of  Dambrath  into  their

personal  fiefs,  and  their  half-

drow scions served as good stew-

ards for their vast estates. These

great  old  families  of  half-drow

rule Dambrath to this day, each

nominally  loyal  to  an  ancient

House of Tlindhet. Drow blood is

a  sign  of  power  and  wealth  in

Dambrath,  but  when  the  half-

drow of the surface visit their ancient

families  below  the  Gnollwatch  Moun-

tains, they find that their full-blooded drow

relations treat them as inferiors.

Outlook

Dambrathan  half-drow  combine  cold,  conde-

scending  arrogance  with  secret  shame.

Although  they  consider  themselves  the

better of the humans over which they

rule,  they  know  that  their  drow

cousins  feel  similarly  about  them.

They  spend  a  great  deal  of  time  trying  to

prove  themselves  to  everyone  around  them,

including each other.

Many  half-drow  become  adventurers  to  escape  the  bigotry

they face in just about every community they find outside Dam-

brath. Dambrathans, on the other hand, often range far outside

their homeland to garner the wealth and fame that can prove

their superiority back home.

HALF-DROW CHARACTERS

The half-drow of Dambrath are often fighters and wizardstwo

quick  paths  to  power  on  the  surface  world.  Unlike  the  caste-

driven society their drow forebears came from, half-drow show

all  the  adaptability  of  other  half-elves.  Accordingly,  many  of

them opt to multiclass.

Favored Class: The highest class a half-drow has is considered

his favored class.

HALF-ELVES

Loviatars faith has a peculiar place among the folk of Dam-

brath.  This  goddess  of  pain  and  suffering  had  a  following  in

Dambrath before the drow conquered the land. In fact, without

the aid of Loviatars cult, the drow might never have taken the

country at all. In respect for her, the worship of Loviatar is still

the  official  faith  of  Dambrath,  and  most  half-drow  who  live

there follow this line.

Relations with Other Races

Most half-drow dont get along well with anyone outside other

half-drow. Dambrath is really the place for such people. Good

half-drow are often friendly when approached with acceptance

or understanding, but standoffish otherwise. They know all too

well how most people feel about their drow kin and, by exten-

sion, them.

Half-Drow Equipment

Half-drow have no unusual racial equipment of their own. How-

ever, they can make use of any equipment or weapons special

to humans or drow. They have a particular fondness for the

hand crossbow.

Half-Drow Region

While many half-drow native to Dambrath choose that region,

a half-drow character living in more northerly lands is an expa-

triate  and  loner.  This  region  represents  a  solitary  half-drow

native to the woodlands of Cormanthor or the North.

Preferred Classes: Cleric, fighter, ranger, rogue. A character

of one of these classes may choose a regional feat and gain her

choice of the bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character.

A  half-drow  of  any  other  class  may  not  select  one  of  the

regional feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment at

1st level.

Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon.

Bonus  Languages: Chondathan,  Dwarven,  Giant,  Goblin,

Illuskan, Sylvan.

Regional  Feats: Daylight  Adaptation,  Drow  Eyes,  Strong

Soul, Survivor.

Bonus Equipment: (A) rapier* or longsword*; or (B) chain

shirt*;  or  (C)  hand  crossbow  and  3  doses  of  drow  knockout

poison (see appendix).

Prestige Classes: Half-drow can use any prestige classes open

to  humans.  They  also  have  access  to  the  arcane  archer,  spell-

slinger, and bladesinger prestige classes.

Half-Drow Society

In Dambrathan society, half-drow are aristocrats by birth. They

grow up pampered, but a great deal is expected of them. When

they become adults, they must do their best to prove that they

are worthy of their blood. If they fail, they disgrace their entire

family, and may be disowned and expelled from the country

in shame.

Elderly  half-drow  who  have  proved  themselves  can  settle

down  and  teach  the  younger  ones  what  they  know.  Otherwise

they must keep at their chosen profession until they finally are

deemed worthy. In any event, elderly half-drow rarely live long

after age begins to weaken them, since there are always younger

relations hungry for the opportunity to claim the wealth and

station of an aged half-drow.

Outside Dambrath, many half-drow are solitary souls, pre-

ferring to keep their own counsel than sully themselves with

the opinions of others. Other times, they band together into

a  self-important  group,  often  bullying  those  they  feel  they

can intimidate.

Language and Literacy

Half-drow  speak  Elven  and  the  human  tongue  of  their  home

region. If they were raised in the Underdark or Dambrath, they

speak Undercommon. Otherwise, they speak Common.

All half-drow are literate, except for barbarians.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Half-drow  have  all  the  half-elven  racial  traits  listed  in  the

Player's Handbook, except as follows:

Darkvision up to 60 feet.

Drow Blood. For all special abilities and effects, a half-drow

is considered a drow.

Half-Drow Magic and Lore

Half-drow can use the racial spells of both humans and drow.

They have no spellcasting traditions of their own, however.

Common Magic Items: Due to Loviatars influence in Dam-

brath, magic whips can be purchased at a 10% discount from the

half-drow.

Half-Drow Deities

Half-drow  can  choose  any  human  or  drow  deity  as  a  patron.

Dambrathan  half-drow  almost  always  choose  either  a  patron

among the drow pantheon or, better yet, Loviatar. Good half-

drow almost always take Eilistraee as their patron. For many

half-drow  of  good  heart,  choosing  Eilistraee  is  a  compromise

between both sides of their heritage, one that they can happily

live with.

orc community. Orc males typically take a handful of wives, who

are usually treated as little more than trophies and slaves. Orc sons

are expected to train in combat as soon as they can hold weapons,

and infighting among siblings is encouraged. An orc father has no

interest  in  rearing  a  child  who  cannot  hold  his  own  against  his

brothers, and a sickly or undersized orc never lives long.

Female orcs have little to look forward to. Rarely, a particu-

larly tough orc woman can muscle her way into the orc armies

and serve alongside her brothers as an equal, but for the most

part,  female  orcs  are  regulated  to  the  roles  of  servant  and

mother. Female orcs are as physically strong and capable as male

orcs, but orc society is narrow-minded and brutal. The one real

area in which a female orc can hope to excel is magic, particu-

larly  divine  magic.  Female  orc  adepts,  clerics,  and  druids  use

their magical skills to strike fear and trepidation into the males

of their community and are, for the most part, left alone to do

what they want.

Slavery is common in orc communities. Usually, slaves in an

orc lair consist of subjugated kobolds or goblins, although it isnt

uncommon  to  see  orcs  of  opposing  tribes  or  subraces  kept  as

slaves. Humans, gnomes, dwarves, and halflings are often kept

as  slaves  too,  although  they  are  treated  poorly  and  generally

dont live long under such harsh conditions. Elf slaves are rare,

since  most  orcs  would  prefer  simply  to  kill  and  eat  any  elves

they come across.

Racial History

Orcslike elves, dwarves, and many other races now quite well

known  on  Faernare  not  true  natives  of  Toril.  The  first

migration of orcs into Faern occurred many thousands of years

ago, through portals built by one of the creator races. For thou-

sands of years after they first migrated to Toril, the orcs were

little  more  than  feral  savages  too  busy  fighting  and  warring

among themselves to warrant the attention of the great elven

nations. This age of true savagery among the orcs of Faern is

believed to have lasted for well over fifteen thousand years. It

wasnt until 3800 DR that the orcs of the North finally coa-

lesced  into  actual  tribes.  Less  than  200  years  later,  the  tribes

unified under a powerful set of orc leaders, forming the first orc

horde.  This  legion  of  orcs  first  turned  its  attentions  south  in

3605 DR, when they launched a major invasion of the fledgling

Four subraces of orcs are known to roam Faern. The first

of these subraces are the gray orcs of the East, nomadic

orcs who are fanatic in their worship of their deities. The

second are the warlike mountain orcs of the North, quite similar

in  physical  abilities  to  those  orcs  presented  in  the  Monster

Manual but  with  quite  different  societies  and  outlooks  on  life.

The  third  are  the  half-orcs,  one  of  the  homeless  races  of

Faern, a mixed people without a history to call their own. The

fourth  subrace  comprises  the  orogs  of  the  deep  Underdark,

mighty weaponsmiths and warleaders long forgotten by the sur-

face peoples.

Overview

Warfare infuses every aspect of orc society. When they are not

out raiding and attacking their enemies (often other orc tribes),

orcs  train  in  fighting,  build  and  repair  weapons  and  siege

engines, and generally chomp at the bit for the next battle.

Orc  tribes  often  make  their  lairs  in  natural  caverns,  since

caves are easily defended and require little construction to for-

tify. It is just as common to find a tribe of orcs dwelling in a

ruined fortress or underground complex captured by invading

orcs. Orc tribes who have not found a suitable network of cav-

erns  or  captured  a  dungeon  or  castle  to  live  in  build  small

nomadic villages instead. Orc villages consist of tents and other

temporary structures arrayed in a circular pattern, guarded by

a moat or palisade. These villages are built atop hills or against

cliffsides, lakes, or rivers, utilizing natural obstacles to increase

the defensibility of the village.

Orcs  have  a  savage,  patriarchal  society.  It  is  virtually  un-

known to find a female orc in a position of secular power in an

64

nation of Netheril and wreaked much havoc before Netherese

and  elven  armies  turned  them  back.  Despite  their  defeat,  the

orcs found that they had a taste for warfare, and since that time

periodic orc invasions have continued to menace the southern

realms every few generations, when orc populations grew large

enough for a new horde to form.

The North wasnt the only region of Faern destined to feel

the savage claws of the orcs. In 1081 DR, a band of rebellious

Mulhorandi wizards opened a portal to the orcs homeworld, and

unleashed a massive horde of the creatures on the world several

years later. The resulting Orcgate Wars stand as the single great-

est time of havoc and warfare inflicted on Faern by the orc

race. The orcs were finally defeated in 1069 DR and scattered

throughout the region.

Since those long-ago times, orcs have continued as a plague on

the surface of the world. In the North, orc hordes have destroyed

(or helped to destroy) many great kingdoms of dwarves, humans,

and elves, including Ammarindar, Phalorm, Delzoun, Eaerlann,

and Illefarn. Orc hordes have at various times ravaged Chessenta,

the Vast, and the Sword Coast as far south as Calimshan. It is

only a matter of time before the orcs gather again.

Gray Orc

Regions: Damara,  Moonsea,  Orc,  Rashemen,  Thesk,  Vaasa,  or

The Vast.

Racial Feats: Daylight Adaptation, Headlong Rush.

Racial Prestige Class: Orc warlord.

Level Adjustment: +1.

The orcs of the eastern lands are concentrated in the Moonsea

and Endless Wastes today, with a much smaller number scattered

through the various lands that lie between. A gray orc looks less

bestial than their more savage northern kin, but is still obviously

nonhuman. They are somewhat hairy, with long manes of bristly

hair  on  their  heads,  shoulders,  and  backs.  Their  faces  are  less

porcine than the mountain orcs, with the exception of their tusks.

They have yellow, orange, or red eyes, lupine ears, and black or

gray hair. Gray orcs are more apt to wear civilized clothing than

mountain orcs, and prefer varying shades of brown, black, blue,

and other dark colors. Skin tones are usually gray with mottled

patches of lighter or darker gray on the chest and flanks.

Gray orc characters have the starting age, life expectancy, and

height and weight characteristics of half-orcs. See Chapter 6 of

the Players Handbook.

History

The lands of the East were relatively free of the orc scourge for

much  of  Faerns  history.  Unfortunately,  this  all  changed  in

1081  DR,  when  the  Theurgist  Adept  Thayd,  last  surviving

apprentice  of  the  ancient  Imaskari  wizards,  opened  a  fateful

portal  to  a  savage  world  dominated  by  empires  of  fanatically

religious orcs. Thayd was executed not long after for inciting the

wizards of Mulhorand and Unther into rebellion, leaving no one

on  Faern  who  knew  of  the  existence  of  the  portal.  For  five

years, the portal remained dormant until it was discovered by

the orcs, who poured through and laid siege to the nations of

Mulhorand  and  Unther.  This  attack  lasted  for  six  years  and

became known to historians as the Orcgate Wars.

The Orcgate Wars began in 1076 DR and quickly escalated

into a war of devastating proportions. Orc warriors slew thou-

sands upon thousands, but the most terrible aspect of this army

was  its  magical  might.  These  orcs  were  much  more  fanatical

than those of the North, and their clerics had developed amaz-

ingly  powerful  and  deadly  spells.  The  most  potent  of  these

magics  was  the  ability  for  the  orc  clerics  to  call  upon  direct

avatars of their deities, an ability they used often to overwhelm

their enemies. The gods of Mulhorand and Unther also possessed

avatars that dwelt on Faern, but they had expended much of

their power in freeing their faithful from years of oppression

under  the  Imaskari  Empire,  and  were  ill-prepared  to  defend

their  flock  from  the  orc  hordes.  Nevertheless,  the  deities  of

these  two  nations  opposed  the  orcs,  who  responded  by  calling

upon  avatars  of  their  own  gods.  The  resulting  battle  was  the

Battle of the Gods, a titanic clash of power that scarred the land.

The Mulhorandi deity Re was slain by the leader of the orc pan-

theon, Gruumsh. Many more followed, as several powers of the

Untheric  pantheon  were  slain  by  the  avatars  of  the  orc  gods.

The orc armies and their deities were terribly weakened, despite

their victory over their enemies, and two years later the shat-

tered remnants of the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons ral-

lied to defeat the orcs and their deities in 1069 DR.

So complete was the destruction of the orc horde that the gray

orcs in the region have never been able to fully recover. Over the

next several hundred years, the gray orcs fragmented time and

time again into countless small tribes scattered throughout Thay,

the Moonsea, and neighboring regions. Bitter infighting among

their  own  kind  has  kept  the  gray  orcs  from  returning  to  the

power they once wielded during the Orcgate Wars.

Outlook

Gray orcs are just as mean, savage, and barbaric as their north-

ern cousins, but they lack the mountain orcs drive to conquer

and  enslave.  A  gray  orc  is  quite  likely  to  react  suddenly  and

irrationally to events, trusting to his heart and instincts more

readily  than  logic.  When  presented  with  an  opportunity  to

attack a hated rival, a gray orc doesnt hesitate to attack even

if he has been brutally defeated dozens of times before by the

same enemy.

GRAY ORC CHARACTERS

A gray orcs strength leads to the fighter and barbarian classes, and

their perception and cunning also make them effective rangers.

Favored Class: Cleric. Although gray orcs are comfortable

with  the  savage  life  of  the  barbarian,  they  tend  to  be  more

calm and collected than northern orcs, focusing their rage and

hatred inward. This allows them to excel as clerics of the war-

like orc deities.

Prestige Classes: Gray orcs dont have an immediate interest

in most prestige classes, and prefer to remain with the one class

they chose from the start. Many orc clerics become divine cham-

pions or divine disciples if they can meet the requirements, but

few live long enough to do so.

Gray Orc Society

Gray orcs are nomads. They dwell in remote, desolate corners of

northeast Faern and eke out a meager existence as they can,

65

HALF-ORCS AND ORCS

traveling along traditional migratory routes between established

campsites  and  favorite  caves  as  the  seasons  change.  When

resources in an area run low, a tribe moves on to greener fields.

A typical gray orc tribe consists of 30 to 50 members, led by

the strongest orc in the tribe. This orc is known as a chieftain,

and  he  is  responsible  for  deciding  when  the  tribe  attacks  its

neighbors. The position tends to be a temporary one at best, for

orc  chieftains  are  constantly  being  killed  (either  in  battle  or

through  treachery)  and  replaced  by  new  chieftains.  The  true

power  behind  a  tribe  of  gray  orcs,  though,  is  the  tribes  high

priest, who is typically an adept or cleric (often female) who has

held the position for many years. The gray orcs are zealots, and

the word of their tribal clerics is law. Clerics from other tribes

are usually viewed as heretics, despite the fact that both tribes

likely worship the same deity in the same manner.

Language and Literacy

The  gray  orcs  speak  a  complex  variant  of  the  Orc  tongue.

Anyone who can speak Orc can understand this language, but

many words, inflections, and pronunciations vary wildly between

tribes and usually a period of a few days is required to sort out

and get used to the idiosyncrasies of a new tribe. Gray orcs are

not fond of learning new languages, but a tribes clerics typically

know Common (to interrogate captives) and Giant and Goblin

(to interact with possible allies).

Gray orcs are not literate unless they have a level in a player

character class other than barbarian.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Gray orcs all possess the following racial traits:

+2 Strength, 2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, 2 Charisma: Gray

orcs are not as strong as mountain orcs, but they tend to be

much more independent and strong-willed.

Medium-size.

Gray orc land speed is 40 feet. Their gait is long and loping and

they can cover great distances quickly.

Proficient with the greataxe and longbow; gray orcs train with

weapons from childhood.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Gray orcs suffer a 1 penalty on attack

rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Scent (Ex): Gray orcs have the scent ability, as detailed in the

DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

Orc Blood: For all special abilities and effects, a gray orc is con-

sidered an orc. Gray orcs, for example, can use or create orc

weapons and magic items with racially specific orc powers as if

they were orcs.

Favored Class: Cleric.

Level  Adjustment  +1.  Gray  orcs  are  slightly  more  powerful

and gain levels more slowly than most of the other common

races of Faern. See Table 1 for more information.

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Orc.  Bonus  Languages: Dra-

conic, Giant, Goblin.

Gray Orc Magic and Lore

Arcane  spellcasters,  while  not  unknown  among  gray  orcs,  are

quite  rare.  In  a  society  dominated  by  brutality  and  strength,

there isnt much room for more academic study. Those orcs who

do become arcane spellcasters are invariably loners or outcasts.

Divine spellcasters are much more common among the gray

orcs. When they first invaded Faern during the Orcgate Wars,

they possessed many unique and powerful spells, the most pow-

erful  of  which  was  one  that  could  conjure  an  avatar  of  the

casters  deity.  Since  their  defeat,  knowledge  of  much  of  this

magic  has  been  lost,  and  now  orc  adepts  and  clerics  focus  on

more common magics. Gray orcs do not often become druids.

GRAY ORC MAGIC ITEMS

Adepts and clerics often craft scrolls and potions to aid them-

selves or to bolster the strength of their tribe, but for the most

part the majority of magical items found in a tribe of gray orcs

consist of items stolen from the bodies of their enemies.

Gray Orc Deities

Gray  orcs  worship  all  the  various  orc  deities  equally.  They

acknowledge Gruumsh as the leader of the orc gods, but a typi-

cal gray orc doesnt feel bound to worship him above any other

deity, and usually selects a deity that most closely aligns with

that  orcs  particular  interests  and  temperament.  Most  of  the

orcs of a particular tribe worship the same deity.

Relations with Other Races

The gray orcs dont get along well with anyone apart from their

immediate tribe. Other orc tribes are viewed with suspicion and

jealousy. Since its assumed that another tribe has it better off

than the one you belong to, orc tribes often attack each other

to  steal  resources.  They  have  no  particular  hatred  for  other

races;  gray  orcs  pretty  much  hate  everyone  equally.  Notable

exceptions are goblins and kobolds (whom the orcs often accept

into their tribes as minions or slaves) and ogres (whom the orcs

admire for their savage strength).

Gray Orc Equipment

Gray orcs are marginally cleaner than mountain orcs, and their

equipment is kept in better shape as a result. Axes in particular

are viewed as holy, and an orc takes fastidious care of his axe,

sharpening it and repairing dents and tiny fractures constantly.

They often keep track of their greatest kills by notching an axes

handle or inscribing names on the head of the axe. Tokens such

as  feathers,  beads,  gems,  and  body  parts  harvested  from

defeated enemies (fingers and ears are a favorite) often adorn an

orcs axe. Gray orcs favor light armor that allows them to use

their speed to best advantage.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Gray orc tribes often keep a small family of animals or beasts as

guardians, but care of such creatures are held to be the responsi-

bility of the tribe as a whole. These guardians are not typically

very dangerous, since many tribes have learned the hard way that

keeping something as powerful as a bulette is a good way to get

the tribe eaten. Common tribe guardians include dire weasels, dire

wolverines, dire boars, owlbears, and various kinds of vermin.

HALF-ORCS AND ORCS

Half-Orc

Regions: Amn,  Chessenta,  Damara,  the  Moonsea,  the  North,

Vassa, and Waterdeep.

Racial Feats: Headlong Rush.

Racial Prestige Class: Orc warlord.

Half-orcs are fairly common throughout Faern. They have no

true homeland to call their own and as a result most spend their

lives wandering the world in search of a purpose. Half-orcs are

invariably the product of a human and an orc, but stories are

told  of  half-orcs  carrying  the  blood  of  dwarves,  goblins,  hob-

goblins, and even halflings, gnomes, and elves. Orcs are a fecund

race, and such stories likely have some genesis in truth.

A  half-orc  is  usually  about  as  tall  as  a  human  and  a  little

heavier. Their skin tends to be gray with green or even purple

undertones, and their faces feature sloping brows, jutting jaws

with prominent teeth, and flat, squashed noses. This and their

coarse body hair make their lineage plain for all to see.

History

Half-orcs have been a part of Faern for a very long time, but

nonetheless they have never organized into a true civilization of

their  own.  Unique  half-orcs  often  gain  great  power  in  their

chosen field and become well known in history texts, but their

exploits  are  always  in  the  name  of  another  people,  or  (more

often) isolated incidents not tied to any particular civilization.

Outlook

Most half-orcs are surly individuals who endured horrible child-

hoods.  They  are  too  coarse  and  savage  to  fit  in  well  with

humans, and too fragile and thoughtful to fit in with orcs. As a

result, the majority of half-orcs grow up alone and without any

influence from orc or human society. Thus, half-orcs speak their

mind and act upon their feelings without any fear of repercus-

sions. They are nomads, loners, and hermits at best, and mur-

derers and savages at worst.

Without a place to call a home, and often without a family

or close friends to count on for companionship, half-orcs learn

from an early age to look out for themselves. This is often inter-

preted as greed or selfishness by other races, but too many half-

orcs have learned the hard way that they are not welcome in any

land, and must provide for themselves.

HALF-ORC CHARACTERS

Half-orcs natural strength and toughness push them strongly

toward fighters and barbarians and away from the spellcasting

classes. Half-orc rogues are common as well.

Favored Class: Barbarian; half-orcs shun society as a rule and

as a result must be strong and able to survive in the wilderness.

Prestige  Classes: Half-orcs,  in  their  nomadic  travels,  are

often exposed to a wide range of prestige classes. As a result,

it isnt unusual for a higher level half-orc to possess one or

two  levels  in  just  about  any  prestige  class  she  can  meet  the

requirements for.

HALF-ORCS AND ORCS

Half-Orc Society

Although the half-orcs of Faern have no true nation to call

their own, there are some small regions in the world that are

ruled  by  their  kind.  Strangely,  it  seems  that  when  half-orcs

gather in large groups like this, they tend to be much more civ-

ilized than their feral orc kin. The city of Palischuk in Vaasa, for

example, is a ruined city rebuilt by a large tribe of nearly ten

thousand half-orcs who now trade peacefully with their neigh-

bors. Another example is Phsant in Thesk, a city with a strong

gray orc presence and a growing half-orc community.

Language and Literacy

All half-orcs speak both Common and Orc. They are accepted on

the fringes of both orc and human societies, and being able to

communicate  clearly  with  both  dramatically  increases  a  half-

orcs  chance  to  find  allies.  Although  they  dont  particularly

make  gifted  linguists,  half-orcs  learn  a  number  of  other  lan-

guages simply as a result of their nomadic, wandering lifestyles.

Other languages commonly learned by half-orcs include Dama-

ran, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, Illuskan, and Undercommon.

All half-orcs are literate except for barbarians, adepts, com-

moners, and warriors.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Half-orcs  have  all  the  half-orc  racial  features  listed  in  the

Players Handbook.

Half-Orc Magic and Lore

Half-orcs do not have a centralized society that they can call

their own, and as a result have not developed any unique racial

spells or spellcasting traditions.

HALF-ORC MAGIC ITEMS

In keeping with their proclivity toward warfare, half-orcs prefer

magic weapons and armor as a rule. Their dangerous lives often

depend on their offensive and defensive capabilities. Items like

hats of disguise are popular with half-orcs who dwell in regions

where their kind is hated or mistrusted.

Half-Orc Deities

Half-orcs who remain among their orc kindred worship the gods

of the orc pantheon, often with greater belief and fervor than

regular orcs since many half-orcs feel the need to prove to their

deities that they are just as powerful and strong as their full-

blooded orc kindred. Those half-orcs who do not dwell among

orcs are free to choose their deities as they will. Common patron

deities for such half-orcs include Bane, Garagos, Hoar, Loviatar,

Malar, Talona, Tempus, and Tyr.

Relations with Other Races

Half-orcs  have  uphill  battles  to  fight  when  interacting  with

most  other  races,  since  many  are  quick  to  assume  that  their

orcish  blood  carries  with  it  an  inherent  savagery  and  cruelty.

Most half-orcs return this suspicion and trepidation when inter-

acting with others. They make friends only with difficulty. Once

trust is established, it is often a fleeting thing that can be frac-

tured with one misinterpreted comment. Often, a half-orc joins

an adventuring company and never feels fully at ease with her

traveling  companions  no  matter  how  many  times  they  have

proven their loyalty.

Half-Orc Equipment

Half-orcs,  as  a  race,  have  not  developed  any  unique  types  of

exotic weapons, although many individuals favor orc weapons

such as the double axe. Most of them are reticent about owning

more  equipment  and  gear  than  they  can  easily  carry,  both

because of their nomadic spirits and because they must always be

ready to tear up their roots and move on if their neighbors sud-

denly decide to turn on them.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Half-orcs are particularly fond of keeping animals as pets, since

pets have few preconceived notions about a persons background

or  race.  Hunting  dogs,  horses,  and  falcons  are  all  popular

choices, and those with particular skill at Handle Animals some-

times  train  more  dangerous  monsters  like  owlbears,  spider

eaters, and dire animals as pets or minions.

Mountain Orc

Regions: The North, Orc, Silver Marches.

Racial Feats: Daylight Adaptation, Headlong Rush.

Racial Prestige Class: Orc warlord.

The orcs of the North and the Spine of the World comprise the

oldest and most numerous of the various orc subraces active on

Faern. In fact, many people assume that all orcs are like the

savage warmongers found in these regions, and do not identify

gray orcs or even half-orcs as separate races.

A mountain orc is quite obviously a monstrous creature to

most  of  the  civilized  folk  of  Faern.  Mountain  orcs  look

vaguely like primitive humans but are a fair bit taller at seven

or more feet in height; a rare few exceed eight feet in height.

They have stocky, powerful necks, and their bestial heads seem

to  sit  directly  on  their  massive  shoulders.  Their  eyes  are

always a deep shade of red, and their faces are dominated by

porcine  snouts  and  large  tusks.  Mountain  orcs  often  weave

braids  and  tiny  bones  into  their  thick  matted  hair,  which  is

usually  black.  Their  clothing  is  crude  and  primitive,  often

composed of unpleasant colors like blood red, mustard yellow,

yellow-green, and deep purple. They are far from the cleanest

race  on  Faern  and  delight  in  decorating  their  bodies  with

scars and warpaint.

History

The mountain orcs have been a part of Faern for thousands of

years, but for most of that time they were little more than feral

animals who sporadically ventured south into the lands of the

elven  nations.  The  elves  had  little  trouble  turning  back  these

sloppy invasions, and often sent parties north toward the Spine

of the World to hunt orcs as sport. To this day the mountain

orcs have a deep and seething hatred of elves, as well as for humans,

since the elves took it upon themselves to protect humans from

the orc-raids.

During the Crown Wars and the Wandering Years that fol-

lowed, the elven nations weakened, and the orcs gained their

chance  to  grow  strong.  The  civilization  of  the  orcs  of  the

North took many generations, and in that time the orcs devel-

oped  important  skills  such  as  metalworking,  armorsmithing,

and weaponcraft. Finally, in 3605 DR, the orcs poured forth

from the Spine of the World in the first great orc horde and

brought untold slaughter and despair to the fledgling nation of

Netheril. This horde was turned back by the combined might

of the elves and humans, but the orcs were merely driven back,

not destroyed.

Since  that  initial  invasion,  orc  hordes  have  periodically

streamed south in attempts to take the lands of the humans and

elves. One great incursion of orcs occurred not long after the

fall of Netheril, in 100 DR; the only kingdom to stand against

their might was the elven realm of Eaerlann. Another major

incursion occurred in 1235 DR; this orc horde swept down from

the northernmost peaks all the way to Calimshan. This invasion

lasted for six years, and was only turned away in 1241 DR by

determined armies banding together.

Each time a new horde appears, it has been eventually beaten

back to the north. Nevertheless, the people of these regions live

in constant fear that the next one might prove to be the horde

that breaks the back of the civilized world once and for all.

Outlook

The  mountain  orcs  are  above  all  else  warlike  and  destructive.

They firmly believe that one day they shall finally crush the civ-

ilized  world  and  inherit  the  lands  that  are  rightfully  theirs.

Their previous defeats are not thought of as losses, but as pre-

liminary assaults designed more to test the resources and resolve

of their enemies.

HALF-ORCS AND ORCS

Despite this shared vision of a savage Faern ruled by orcs,

the greatest hurdle they face is their inability to band together

for any other reason than warfare. When the orc populations

grow  large  enough  and  an  orc  leader  emerges  with  enough

charisma and clout to rally them, the orc tribes of the North

can shake the world. But most of the time the mountain orcs are

consumed with bitter infighting among themselves.

MOUNTAIN ORC CHARACTERS

Barbarians  and  fighters  dominate  among  the  mountain  orcs,

with rogues and adepts a distant third and fourth, respectively

Favored Class: Barbarian; the mountain orcs have built their

society around the concept that might makes right.

Prestige Classes: The most infamous prestige class among the

tribes of the North is the dreaded orc warlord (see the appendix),

those charismatic individuals responsible for gathering and lead-

ing  the  destructive  orc  hordes  south  against  civilized  lands.

Mountain orcs sometimes become blackguards or assassins, but

these are exceptional characters.

Mountain Orc Society

The mountain orcs gather in immense tribes. Unlike their gray

orc kin, mountain orcs are not nomadic. They select a cavern or

old ruin as a lair and settle in. As their populations grow, crude

new  buildings  and  keeps  are  built,  and  in  many  places  in  the

North, orc lairs have begun to resemble actual cities. When an

orc city grows too large, the usual result is a bitter civil war that

ends with the losing faction breaking off and fleeing to form its

own tribe elsewhere. This tradition of infighting keeps most orc

cities  and  fortresses  from  becoming  too  large.  The  size  of  a

mountain orc tribe varies greatly, depending on the success of

the tribe and its age. Smaller tribes are rarely less than 50 mem-

bers,  and  the  larger  tribes,  such  as  the  Tornskull  Orcs,  can

number in excess of 5,000 fighting orcs.

The number of orc tribes in the North is past guessing, and

tribes rise or vanish on a monthly basis. Nevertheless, several

tribes  are  large  and  old  enough  to  have  become  infamous

throughout  the  region.  The  three  major  tribes  of  the  Rauvin

Mountains  are  a  perfect  example:  the  Red  Fangs,  the  Heart

Takers, and the Tornskulls have long terrorized this region. The

orc tribes in the foothills and heights of the Spine of the World

are by far the most numerous in total number, and it is also here

that  one  of  the  most  notorious  and  successful  orc  tribes  now

dwellsthe Many Arrows tribe, led by King Obould.

Language and Literacy

All  mountain  orc  characters  can  speak  Orc  and  Common.

Unlike the gray orcs, the various northern tribes speak very sim-

ilar  dialects  of  Orc,  most  likely  due  to  the  fact  that  there  is

much more interaction among the various mountain tribes than

there is among the independent tribes of the east. Mountain orcs

often learn Giant and Goblin as well, so they can communicate

with their like-minded neighbors, and Common so that they can

interrogate prisoners.

All mountain orcs are illiterate, except for those who have a

player character class other than barbarian.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Mountain orcs all possess the following racial traits:

+4 Strength, 2 Intelligence, 2 Wisdom, 2 Charisma: Moun-

tain orcs are fantastically strong, but they react to situations

with violence and poor planning.

Medium-size.

Mountain orc land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision up to 60 feet.

Proficient with the greataxe and javelin. Mountain orcs train

with weapons from childhood.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Mountain orcs suffer a 1 penalty on

attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of a day-

light spell.

Orc  Blood:  For  all  special  abilities  and  effects,  a  mountain

orc is considered an orc. Mountain orcs, for example, can use

or create orc weapons and magic items with racially specific

orc powers.

Automatic Languages: Common and Orc. Bonus Languages:

Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin.

Favored Class: Barbarian.

Mountain Orc

Magic and Lore

The mountain orcs are more interested in physical combat than

magic. Nonetheless, they understand and appreciate the tactical

value  of  having  magical  support  in  a  war.  Their  spellcasters

focus  on  magic  that  can  be  directly  applied  to  combats,  espe-

cially spells like haste, keen edge, bless, prayer, and others that

support  the  fighting  troops.  Despite  this,  many  tribes  of  orcs

think of magic as the cowards route, something used by their

hated  enemies  (especially  the  elves).  To  embrace  the  use  of

magic is to concede that ones enemies are to be respecteda

concept that doesnt sit well with many orcs.

MOUNTAIN ORC MAGIC ITEMS

Mountain orc magic items are nearly always weapons or armor.

They prefer to use items that anyone can access, such as potions,

rings, weapons, armor, or most wondrous items and rods. Scrolls,

staffs,  and  wands  are  items  of  mockery,  mostly  because  the

majority  of  the  mountain  orcs  simply  cant  make  them  work

and thus deride them to inflate their own importance.

Iconic  Magic  Item: Some  mountain  orc  spellcasters  manu-

facture spears of impaling (see the appendix), designed to slay

the elves and dwarves they hate.

Mountain Orc Deities

The mountain orcs acknowledge the various orc deities, but they

do not let matters of faith and religion get in the way of their

goals. They assume that the orc deities placed them in this world

to do what they do best and do not feel the need of constant sup-

port from clerics and the like. Almost all mountain orc clerics

are worshipers of Gruumsh, since the other members of the orc

pantheon are thought of as little more than the servants of Gru-

umsh. There are also a large number of orc druids in the North;

these are usually loners who dwell apart from orc tribes. An orc

druid is either Chaotic Neutral or Neutral Evil. They serve as

oracles and advisors for orc chieftains, and are often called upon

to use their power over nature to aid orc armies.

Relations with Other Races

The  mountain  orcs  are  consumed  with  hatred  toward  most

nonorc races (in particular elves, humans, and dwarves). Despite

this, they remain on good terms with other races like the vari-

ous goblinoid races, giants, and

other  evil  denizens  of  the

North. Often ogres, trolls, and

hill giants can be found living

in  orc  communities.  Its  often

said an orc will willingly breed

with  anything  even  vaguely

humanoid;  see  the  Half-orc

entry  for  more  on  their  most

common mixed race progeny.

Equipment

Mountain  orcs  have  the  tech-

nology  and  skill  to  build  their

own  weapons  and  armor,  and

have  specialized  in  the  con-

struction of specialty axes such

as the orc double-axe. For equip-

ment,  armor,  and  non-axe

weaponry,  though,  the  moun-

tain orcs prefer to outfit their

armies  with  gear  and  weapons

looted from their defeated ene-

mies. A mountain orc treats his

axe  with  respect,  but  most  of

the rest of his equipment is neg-

lected  and  ignored;  when  it

finally breaks or falls apart it is

simply discarded and replaced at the earliest opportunity from

loot taken from another enemy. They prefer to wear the best

armor they can find or afford, usually scale mail.

traps in this fashion.

Orog (Deep Orc)

Regions: Anauroch, The North, Silver Marches, Orc, or Orog.

Racial Feats: Daylight Adaptation, Headlong Rush.

Racial Prestige Class: Orc warlord.

Level Adjustment: +2.

Although  everyone  in  Faern

knows about the orc hordes of

the North (the mountain orcs)

and  the  nomadic  orcs  of  the

East (the gray orcs), only a rel-

ative few know of a third sub-

race that hails from the deeps

below ground. The Underdark

is  the  chosen  haunt  of  these

terrible  creatures,  the  orogs.

After  thousands  of  years  of

survival in the harsh and dan-

gerous  Underdark,  the  orogs

have  changed  to  match  their

home,  becoming  more  fero-

cious  and  better  able  to  cope

with the dangers found there.

Physically,  an  orog  looks

similar  to  a  large  mountain

orc,  except  that  the  ears  are

somewhat  larger,  and  their

eyes  are  huge  and  pale.  They

average six and a half feet tall.

Over  the  centuries,  orogs

have mastered the art of forg-

ing  armor  and  weapons  from

the  strange  ores  found  in  the

Underdark.  They  favor  half-

plate  and  full  plate  armor,

which  are  typically  adorned

with  armor  spikes.  Orog  weap-

ons are festooned with a multi-

tude  of  hooks,  spines,  and  redundant  cutting  edges.  An  orog

rarely goes anywhere without being fully armed and armored.

Orogs  use  the  following  aging  effect  characteristics,  as

ANIMALS AND PETS

Mountain orcs often use animals, beasts, and other monsters as

guardians for their lairs, but usually such guardians are just as

dangerous to the orcs as to potential intruders. They reason that

taming a wild animal dulls the creatures instincts and senses, so

a completely feral creature is much more effective a guardian.

Generally, an orc tribe sets aside a section of their territory as

a lair for these creatures. Chimeras, displacer beasts, manticores,

phase spiders, and winter wolves are often found living with orc

communities in this manner. If the guardian creatures are unin-

telligent, the orcs instead incorporate them into traps, stocking

underground pits and caves with the monsters and then rigging

chutes and trap doors in the floor to drop intruders into these

History

The orogs are descended from the Skullbiters, a large tribe that

lived in the Spine of the World thousands of years ago. These

71

HALF-ORCS AND ORCS

orcs  were  among  the  most  brutal  and  savage  warriors  of  the

first orc horde to attack the southern lands in 3605 DR. When

the horde was finally repelled, the Skullbiter orcs were cut off

from their retreat to the north. Cornered between the Netherese

and elven armies, the Skullbiters fled into a narrow cave at the

end of a canyon. The narrow cave quickly gave way to a seem-

ingly endless maze of caverns; the Skullbiters had discovered

the Underdark.

The orcs soon realized they were hopelessly lost, but they knew

that their enemies would never follow them into these lightless

vaults below. Whenever they came to a choice in their journey

through the Underdark, they chose the route that led deeper into

the  ground.  Eventually,  the  Skullbiters  came  to  a  vast  under-

ground  cavern  filled  with  a  veritable  jungle  of  phosphorescent

fungi. The orcs figured they had fled long enough, and in the wan

light of the fungus jungle, they decided to settle down.

Over the next several thousand years, the Skullbiters spread

like  a  plague  through  the  deeps,  often  choosing  caverns  filled

with deadly fungi or other dangerous creatures. More often than

not, the orcs subjugated these creatures. In their expansions out-

ward,  the  orcs  also  discovered  numerous  veins  of  pure  metal

ranging from iron to mithral. By 1000 DR, the Skullbiters had

split into nearly a dozen new tribes and had grown strong indeed.

Before long, the one-time orcs came to be known as orogs.

With the fall of Ascalhorn, Ammarindar, and Eaerlann in

the 9th century DR, the orogs found their way clear to return

to the surface world. Lone orogs had long blundered up into

the surface world, but they had always been isolated arrivals.

Now, the orogs began to seethe up from below in greater num-

bers than ever. The sight of the upper world awakened a mys-

terious urge in their hearts. The orogs have found to their great

delight that their lesser kin, the mountain orcs, are easily bul-

lied into subservience.

The vast majority of orogs still dwell in the caves below, but

when the next orc horde rises it will be one the likes of which

the North has never seen. The orogs have been slowly but surely

supplying their less-talented kin with deep-forged weapons and

armor, and more than a few mountain orc tribes are now led by

orog warlords and champions.

Outlook

The orogs spent thousands of years battling terrible creatures

for living space in the Underdark. Now that they have finally

begun to return to the surface world, they are finding it to be

something  of  a  paradise.  Stronger  and  better  equipped  than

most of their enemies, the orogs are quickly settling into posi-

tions of leadership in the eastern tribes of mountain orcs near

Anauroch. Whereas mountain orcs revel in the act of war, the

orogs  revel  in  its  spoils.  They  are  quick  to  rise  to  battle,  but

afterward they fall back to enjoy the fruits of their victories.

The  concept  of  leading  a  horde  of  raging  orcs  on  a  pointless

crusade  that  only  ends  when  the  last  aggressor  falls,  still

advancing, is alien to the mindset of the orog. Why go to war

if you cant enjoy the results?

OROG CHARACTERS

Most  orog  characters  are  fighters  or  barbarians,  but  recently

more orogs are becoming rangers and rogues as they explore the

surface world.

Favored Class: Fighter. Orogs have been battling ceaselessly in

the  Underdark  for  centuries.  Because  orogs  have  higher

Charisma scores than other orc races, a significant minority of

them are bards and sorcerers.

Prestige  Classes: Many  orogs  near  the  surface  take  the  orc

warlord prestige class with the hope that they can harness the

random, almost mindless, fury of the orc horde for their own

conquests and raids.

Orog Society

Deep underground, the orogs use slave labor to expand caverns

into well-defended cities. These cities are completely enclosed in

the rock and consist of huge, seemingly endless rooms connected

by numerous large processionals and public squares. Orog cities

often  consist  of  layers,  with  rooms  atop  rooms  atop  rooms.

Nobility  usually  resides  in  the  highest  chambers,  which  are

accessed by trapped stairwells and vertical shafts with crude rope

lifts. Orog cities such as these can house upwards of eight thou-

sand orogs and up to three times that many slaves.

Most orog cities are much smaller and are comprised of only

a few hundred orogs and slaves. All the near-surface cities are

like this, although they mimic the larger cities tendency to con-

sist of dozens (if not hundreds) of interconnected small rooms.

On the surface, orogs have so far not built cities of their own.

Rather,  they  have  simply  moved  in  and  taken  over  tribes  of

mountain orcs, seizing the best buildings for themselves and dis-

placing the orcs to the smaller ones.

The  one  thing  that  binds  together  all  orog  societies  is  the

placement of the forges. Orogs have a long tradition of armor-

smithing and weapon forging, and the first thing a tribe of orogs

look for when they pick a site for a new town is a natural place

to  set  up  a  forge.  Volcanic  vents  and  pools  of  magma  are

favorites, but more traditional forges built on epic scales serve

as well. Orog forges are community-held, and any orog is wel-

come to build armor and weaponry at the forge just as long as

what  is  produced  is  either  put  to  immediate  personal  use  or

placed in the community armory.

Language and Literacy

Orogs  speak  Orc  and  Undercommon.  Those  few  who  have  a

knack  for  languages  learn  another  tongue  common  in  the

Underdark, such as Dwarven or the drow dialect of Elven. Now

that  the  orogs  are  exploring  Anauroch,  its  likely  some  orog

characters will learn the tongues of the surface world as well.

All  orogs  are  literate,  except  for  barbarians,  commoners,

and warriors.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Orogs all possess the following racial traits:

+6  Strength,  2  Dexterity,  2  Wisdom,  +2  Charisma:  Orogs

are  incredibly  strong,  and  they  make  natural  leaders  despite

their ferocious appearance.

Medium-size.

Orog land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision up to 120 feet.

HALF-ORCS AND ORCS

Relations with Other Races

Orogs  get  along  the  best  with  orcs,  whom  they  find  easy  to

bully and subjugate. They are intrigued by the concept of the

half-orc, since these hybrids can operate in the blinding light

of the sun with ease and make excellent warriors for surface

world campaigns.

Those orogs who remain deep underground often engage in

more or less friendly trade with the gray dwarves and the drow,

who  value  the  productivity  of  orog  mines  enough  to  let  orog

cities alone. The orogs often make war on the svirfneblin, but

they try to avoid the more alien races such as the illithids and

aboleth, whose mental powers can cut down even the mightiest

orog with ease.

Orog Equipment

Orogs are loath to use armor or weaponry of less than master-

work quality; any weapons they construct that fall below this

expected level of quality are usually set aside for young orogs to

practice  with.  They  have  little  interest  in  some  of  the  more

exotic types of weaponry found in the Underdark, preferring to

use  relatively  simple  weapons  instead.  The  greatsword  is  the

orogs favorite melee weapon, and they find that throwing axes

make good use of their high Strength in the close quarters of

many Underdark battles.

ANIMALS AND PETS

A typical orog lair not only includes two to three times the orog

population in various humanoid slaves, but also a large number

of war-trained animals as well. Near the surface, orogs favor dire

animals  (particularly  dire  boars  and  dire  bears),  while  deep

underground  they  often  train  giant  lizards  and  dire  bats  as

steeds or guardians. In some of the larger orog cities, they keep

creatures like thoqqua and even salamanders or fire elementals

as guardians for their forges.

Orog Region

This region represents an expatriate orog living among the orcs

of the surface world.

Preferred  Classes: Barbarian,  cleric,  fighter,  sorcerer.  A

character of one of these classes may choose a regional feat

and  gain  his  choice  of  the  bonus  equipment  below  as  a  1st-

level character.

Automatic Languages: Orc, Undercommon.

Bonus Languages: Common, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome.

Regional  Feats:  Blooded,  Bullheaded,  Daylight  Adaptation,

Thug.

Bonus  Equipment: (A)  greatsword*  or  throwing  axe*;  (B)

banded mail* with armor spikes; (C) Potion of enlarge (at 5th

level) and masterwork armorsmith or weaponsmith tools.

Proficient with greatsword and throwing axe. All orogs train

with some sort of martial weapon from a very young age.

+2 racial bonus on Craft (armorsmithing) and Craft (weapon-

smithing) checks. Orogs train from an early age at their tribal

forges.

+2 natural armor.

Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as

sunlight  or  a  daylight spell)  blinds  an  orog  for  1  round.  In

addition, orogs suffer a 1 circumstance penalty on all attack

rolls, saves, and checks while operating in bright light.

Resistances: Orogs have fire resistance 5 and cold resistance 5.

They are inured to extremes of temperature.

Orc Blood: For all special abilities and effects, an orog is con-

sidered an orc. Orogs, for example, can use or create orc weap-

ons and magic items with racially specific orc powers as if they

were ordinary orcs.

Automatic Languages: Orc, Undercommon. Bonus Languages:

Common, Dwarven, Elven, Goblin, Giant.

Favored Class: Fighter.

Level  Adjustment:  +2.  Orogs  are  more  powerful  and  gain

levels more slowly than most of the other common races of

Faern. See Table 1 in the Introduction for more information.

Orog Magic and Lore

Although orogs do not have an inherent distrust of magic, they

have little patience for it. Clerics are respected in orog society,

not only for their curative magic but because they represent the

orog  race  and  serve  as  spiritual  guides.  They  are  often  called

upon  to  aid  in  creating  magical  weapons.  The  most  common

spellcaster in orog society, though, is the bard. Orog bards are

often important members of a tactical strike, using drums and

chanting to whip the soldiers into a frenzy, then curing them of

their wounds after a battle. Orog sorcerers are rare, but the nat-

ural leadership and force of personality possessed by orogs make

them ideal sorcerers. Those few who develop sorcerous powers

become mighty indeed.

OROG MAGIC ITEMS

Orogs are not known for their creativity; orog magical items

tend to be short and to the point. An orog crafting a magical

weapon  doesnt  bother  with  fancy  weapon  qualities,  opting

instead to simply increase the enhancement bonus of a weapon.

They  have  little  interest  in  items  like  wands,  staves,  and

scrolls, but potions are well liked due to their portability and

endless uses in combat. An orog army outfitted with potions

of  bulls  strength,  endurance,  enlarge,  and  haste is  a  potent

force indeed.

Orog Deities

Orogs  brought  the  worship  of  Gruumsh  with  them  into  the

Underdark and have more or less forgotten the other various

orc deities. Certain fringe cults of orogs in the deep Underdark

have started worshiping Ghaunadaur, but these orogs avoid their

more traditional kin. Religion is an established facet of orog soci-

ety, but not an overwhelming one. In many cities, orog clerics

are  thought  of  as  little  more  than  healers,  the  average  orog

having little interest in spiritual matters.

73

Halflings  fit  into  dwarven,  gnome,  elven,  and

human  societies  wherever  they  can,  often

leaving little or no impression on their neigh-

bors.  The  halflings  prefer  it  this  way,  so  they  can  live  their

lives  as  they  want  without  interference.  Most  nonhalflings

forget about far-away Luiren and its population of militant and

territorial halflings.

Racial History

Halflings are one of the newcomer races, appearing on Toril

shortly after the advent of the creator races and at about the

same time as dwarves, elves, and giants. History does not record

exactly where the first halflings appeared, but it is thought to

be somewhere south of the Shaar. Few halflings were seen in the

Western Heartlands until the years immediately following the

Hin  Ghostwars,  and  most  of  these  were  wandering  lightfoot

halflings. Since then, halflings have become a familiar sight in

numerous human communities, and certainly on the roads that

crisscross  the  distances  between  the  great  cities.  Most  of  the

halflings that Faernians encounter are of the lightfoot subrace,

but  both  the  strongheart  and  the  ghostwise  are  not  unknown

outside their native lands.

Ghostwise

Halflings

Regions: Chondalwood, Ghostwise Halfling.

Racial Feats: Blooded, Survival.

Racial Prestige Class: Warsling sniper.

The ghostwise are easily the most uncommon of the three sub-

races of halfling living in Faern. They are elusive and do not

welcome strangers to their lands. Instead, they prefer to pursue

a nomadic way of life within their adopted homeland, the Chon-

dalwood, associating mainly with those of their own clan. Those

who seek out the ghostwise most often fail to achieve their goal;

the fortunate among them live to regret their intrusion into

hin territory.

The Nightgliders

Certain of the ghostwise clans enjoy a close association with the

giant  owls  that  make  their  home  in  the  Chondalwood.  It  is

common  among  these  clans  for  some  of  their  warriors  to

become  nightgliders,  a  type  of  mounted  defender  who  rides

these majestic nocturnal birds. These clans have their own dis-

tinct  practices  for  determining  who  among  them  becomes  a

nightglider. The exact process and relationship is often deter-

mined by the ratio of halflings in the clan to the number of

giant  owls  available  for  training  and  riding.  In  some  clans,

particularly those in which the number of halflings greatly ex-

ceeds  the  number  of  available  mounts,  the  nightgliders  are  a

hereditary class, and nearly the equivalent of warrior-nobles. In

other tribes, especially those that enjoy a much narrower ratio

of halfling to owl, nearly every adult halfling is a nightglider.

All the clans have a distinctive ceremony (the exact details of

which are often influenced by the clans choice of patron deity)

in which the new nightgliders are required to participate before

taking to the skies.

74

History

The history of the ghostwise halflings is detailed in the FORGOT-

TEN REALMS Campaign Setting (see page 196).

Outlook

The defining characteristic of the ghostwise halflings is their rev-

erence  for  and  devotion  to  their  clans.  Family  is  important  to

most halflings and halfling communities, but the ghostwise hin

regard the familial bond with a degree of respect some might call

obsession.  Following  their  self-imposed  exile  from  Luiren  and

resettlement in the Chondalwood, the ghostwise congregated into

groups demarcated along family lines. Those hin without surviv-

ing family joined one of these groups. As the hin pursued their

quest  for  atonement,  their  clan  system  evolved

into  the  all-encompassing  social  struc-

ture it is today.

Many clans designate a natural featurea distinctive rock, a

lightning-struck  tree,  a  stretch  of  a  particular  streamas  the

center of their territory and base their wanderings on their rel-

ative distance from this place. Some clans carry a tiny portion

of  this  central  feature  with  them  as  they  travel,  to  reinforce

their spiritual connection with their territory and their home-

land. Such tokens might take the form of clay vials filled with

stream water, small leather pouches filled with dirt from a spe-

cific spot, small bits of rock broken from a boulder and worn as

a necklace, or even a bit of tree bark carried in the hollowed end

of a deers antler.

Among these clans, such tokens are considered a sacred charge:

To lose or misplace one is a mistake requiring that the transgres-

sor atone in a manner designated by the clan leader. If the half-

ling  who  makes  the  error  is  a  cleric  or  druid,  the  penance  is

assigned by a representative of his faith. The act of atonement

often  a  quest  or  other  dangerous  mission  or  errandmust  be

completed  successfully  before  the  halfling  may  obtain  another

portion of the clans central feature. Willfully destroying a clan

token is a grievous crime, punishable by exile (a fate far worse

than death in the culture of the ghostwise halflings).

The only permissible use of the tokens

is when a member of the clan

GHOSTWISE HALFLING

CHARACTERS

Many ghostwise halflings are barbarians, but

rogues,  druids,  rangers,  and  clerics  are  also

common.

Favored  Class:  Barbarian.  As  clannish  nomads,  ghost-

wise halflings have little need for societys trappings, but

the  barbarians  skills  and  class  features  are  essential  to

survival in their forest homes.

Ghostwise Halfling Society

Because clan is the focus of the ghostwise culture, it is not sur-

prising to find it the central factor in their society as well. The

wanderlust that is one of the most readily discernable traits of

both the lightfoot and strongheart subraces still survives in the

ghostwise, but on a more limited scale. The nomadic wanderings

of  the  ghostwise  clans  are  confined  almost  exclusively  to  the

Chondalwood  and  its  environs,  where  the  few  remaining  sur-

vivors  of  the  Ghost  Wars  settled  after  departing  their  native

homeland of Luiren.

Each clan of ghostwise halflings has adopted a segment of the

Chondalwood as its territory. Clan territories vary in size from less

than  fifty  to  several  hundred  square  miles.  The  clan  travels

together as its leader directs. A number of factors influence exactly

where the clan travels within its territory, including the presence

or absence of hostile creatures and the relative abundance of game.

There is ample room in the vast forest for all the ghostwise half-

ling clans, and so their territories are only loosely defined.

75

falls  in  battle.  In  that  event,  all  nearby  hin  who

share  the  same  tribe  as  the  fallen  scatter  their

tokens, be they wood, water, or stone, around the

corpse. The hin believe that doing so calls the attention of

He Who Must Be and ensures that no fell spirits will disturb

the  body  of  their  fallen  clan  member  until  it  can  be

attended to properly. The ghostwise hin clans cremate their

Ghostwise

nightglider

dead rather than inter them.

While clans keep to themselves, they do not shun one another

when they meet in their travels. Instead, they exchange news and

information about the forests conditions and creatures. Indeed,

the matriarchs and patriarchs who lead the clans often meet for-

mally to discuss matters of mutual interest and importance. Mul-

tiple  clans  cooperate  for  the  purpose  of  mutual  defense  when

they are threatened by a common enemy, whether it be a band

of destructive humanoids or a marauding band of trolls.

Language and Literacy

Because of their peculiar racial talent (telepathy), the ghostwise

hin do not learn tongues other than their own with as much fre-

quency as other races. The matriarchs and patriarchs of the var-

ious clans are apt to learn, in addition to their native language,

Chondathan  and  Sylvan,  while  clerics  and  druids  most  com-

monly express an interest in Sylvan and sometimes Gnoll. The

typical ghostwise clan member, however, speaks only those lan-

guages that the race receives automatically (Common, Halfling,

and regional).

HALFLINGS

No  ghostwise  are  literate,  except  for  individuals  with  player

character classes other than barbarian.

Ghostwise Halfling

Magic and Lore

Most  ghostwise  halfling  spellcasters  are  clerics  or  druidssor-

cerers  and  bards  are  rare,  and  wizards  more  so  because  so  few

ghostwise regularly use a written language.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Like  the  wild  elves,  ghostwise  halflings  sometimes  add  extra

components to their spells to further emphasize their connection

to the land. Thus they take the Primitive Spellcaster feat (see the

appendix). Ghostwise halflings favor divination spells that help

them safely learn about threats beyond their land, and illusion

spells that keep them well-hidden.

Ghostwise Halfling Deities

The ghostwise acknowledge and give due respect to all the deities

in the halfling pantheon. Each clan, however, tends to adopt one

specific  halfling  deity  as  its  patron  and  venerates  that  power

above all others. Because of their nomadic lifestyle, the ghost-

wise hin do not build permanent temples to the gods. Rather,

they maintain small shrines throughout the Chondalwood and

carry symbols of their clans patron with them as they wander

the reaches of the forest. Two deities are of special significance

to the ghostwise: Sheela Peryroyl and Urogalan.

The Green Children, as the clerics of the Watchful Mother

are called, encourage the ghostwise clans to maintain a harmo-

nious relationship with their woodland home. They do their best

to  ensure  that  the  hin  treat  the  forest  with  the  respect  it

deserves.  The  druids  among  Sheelas  clergy  are  frequently  at

odds with the more aggressively militant druids dwelling in the

Chondalwood and warn the clans that associating with such indi-

viduals could lead the ghostwise to commit the same grave error

for which they are still trying to atone.

Worshipers who select He Who Must Be as their patron deity

are more common among the ghostwise than among the other

halfling subraces. During their long period of atonement, the

hin of the Chondalwood looked to Urogalan for guidance, and

they  strove  to  be  worthy  of  his  final  judgment.  To  this  day,

adventurers  and  travelers  venturing  through  the  great  forest

speak of the disturbing sounds they sometimes hear in the forest

depths:  quiet,  somber  chanting  and  drumming  that  rises  and

falls throughout the length of an evening in eerie counterpoint

to the natural sounds of the wood. Even those who recognize

this noise as the ghostwise hin ceremony in honor of Urogalan

find it disturbing.

Relations with Other Races

Most  ghostwise  hin  would  prefer  not  to  have  relations  with

other humanoid races unless its absolutely necessary and clearly

to the benefit of the clan. Encounters that cannot be avoided

must be tolerated with as much patience as the clan can muster,

and they do not bother to mask their distrust of outsiders. No

ghostwise halfling will, under any circumstances, abuse or attack

a guest who has the sanction of the clan matriarch or patriarch:

To  do  so  would  be  an  unforgivable  offense  against  the  clans

honor. All the clans give a wide berth to the nation of wild elves

that lies within the Chondalwood. The hin dont know a great

deal about the elves, and they dont want to. For their part, the

wild elves respect the ghostwise desire for privacy and leave the

clans to their own devices.

The hin do sometimes seek out adventuring parties that enter

the Chondalwood, however, particularly those that seem intent

on exploring one of the many old Chondathan ruins that have

been swallowed up by the ever-expanding forest. The hin have

learned  through  bitter  experience  that  such  expeditions  fre-

quently unleash havoc on the wood and any nearby clans in the

form of whatever horrors were waiting quiescent beneath those

ruins before being stirred up by adventurers. Certain clans, par-

ticularly those that have suffered because of the blunderings of

adventuring companies, sometimes attempt to prevent any fur-

ther  difficulty  by  intercepting  and  harassing  expeditionary

groups. Clans that boast a company of nightgliders among their

number often assign some of the mounted warriors the task of

discouraging  intruders  from  entering  any  ruins  or  dungeons

located within the clans chosen territory.

This is not to say that all ghostwise halfling clans share iden-

tical racial likes and dislikes. Some clans get on well with many

groups of creatures living in or near their territory. But on the

whole ghostwise halflings are wary first and accepting only after

experience has taught them that a particular group of outsiders

can be trusted.

Ghostwise

Halfling Equipment

Ghostwise clan camps have all the variety of gear that one would

expect from a nomadic culture: tents, hunting weapons, religious

icons,  and  so  on.  Almost  everything  a  ghostwise  halfling  owns

can be carried on his back.

Iconic  Item:  Ghostwise  halflings  construct  and  set  footsaw

traps (see the appendix) to both protect the Chondalwood from

intruders and ensnare food for the clan.

ANIMALS AND PETS

In addition to the giant owls ridden by the nightgliders, ghost-

wise halflings also associate with several other types of creatures

found in the Chondalwood.

Dire  Bats:  A  few  adventuring  parties  who  have  returned

recently from expeditions to the deeper parts of the Chondal-

wood have claimed that they were attacked by groups of ghost-

wise  halflings  mounted  not  on  giant  owls  but  dire  bats.

According to these rumors, the bat-mounted hin were of a par-

ticularly aggressive and hostile demeanor, giving rise to specu-

lation that perhaps not every trace of feral bloodlust has been

extinguished among the ghostwise clans.

Tressym: The ghostwise hin consider these strange creatures

to be emblematic of cunning and stealth, much as the lightfoot

halflings admire the fox. Ghostwise halfling sorcerers and wiz-

ards  sometimes  select  these  winged  felines  as  familiars.  Occa-

sionally,  a  tressym  allows  itself  to  become  the  animal

companion  of  a  good-aligned  ghostwise  druid  or  the  partially

domesticated associate of a clan matriarch or patriarch.

HALFLINGS

Lightfoot Halflings

Regions: Any human region, Luiren, Lightfoot Halfling.

Racial Feats: Improved Low Blow, Low Blow, Nobodys Fool.

Racial Prestige Class: Warsling sniper.

The  folk  of  Faern  are  more  familiar  with  the  lightfoot  hin

than with either of the other two subraces, primarily because the

lightfoots are the most numerous and widely traveled of all the

halflings.  Nearly  every  human  community  of  any  size  larger

than a village has at least a few halfling residents. When most

Faernians think of halflings, the lightfoots are the people that

most often leap to mind.

History

Most  lightfoot  halflings

trace  their  family  ancestry

back to the days when a great

tribe  of  their  subrace  popu-

lated  the  territory  known

today  as  Luiren.  Follow-

ing  the  events  of  the

Hin  Ghostwars,  the

majority  of  the  light-

foot  halflings  departed

their  homeland  and

spread out across north-

ern  Faern  in  a  great

diaspora (see the FORGOT-

TEN REALMS Campaign

Setting,  page  196).  Though

some lightfoot halflings remained in

Luiren,  the  subrace  has  become  ubiquitous

throughout the settled lands of Faern.

Outlook

Lightfoot halflings may be the most common of all the sub-

races, but their behavior is also the most varied. Its impossible

to describe the typical lightfoot halfling because, much like

humans,  the  race  embodies  individuals  that  are  the  absolute

antithesis of one another. This diversity of behavior is mirrored

in  a  diversity  of  outlooks:  Some  halflings  adopt  views  and

beliefs about the world that are very close or even identical to

whatever  human  community  they  happen  to  dwell  in,  while

others retain distinctive points of view that separate them from

other  races  and  groups  (including  other  halflings).  Its  not

uncommon  to  meet  halflings  who,  because  they  spend  the

greater part of their lives roaming from place to place, have

outlooks  that  are  amalgams  of  those  from  multiple  cultures

and environments.

The aspect of the lightfoot outlook that most nonhalflings

notice, however, is that they are the hin subrace that is most

likely to wander out of an innate desire. It is not unknown

for individual lightfoot halflings or even entire families to

decide that, after living in the same place for decades, they

want to move on to someplace else. Some learned folk spec-

ulate that the lightfoot hin experience a habitual need to see

many different places and enjoy a variety of experiences. Other

sages and loremasters wonder if the lightfoot penchant for the

semi-nomadic lifestyle is socialized behavior, learned from cen-

turies of practice. These scholars theorize that the lightfoot

hin who left Luiren because of the Ghostwar massacres were

unable  to  find  a  new  homeland  that  suited  them  as  well,  so

they wandered. After so many hundreds of years of wander-

ings, the behavior is now natural to the lightfoot hin, or so

this  school  of  thought  holds.  Whatever  the  case,  theres  no

denying that many lightfoot halflings seem determined to see

a great deal of Faern and have many interesting experiences

during their lifetimes.

LIGHTFOOT HALFLING

CHARACTERS

As befits their name, lightfoot half-

lings often take classes that work

well  for  wanderers,  such  as

rogue and bard.

Favored  Class:  Rogue.

Lightfoot  halflings  often

pick  up  an  impressive

array of skills during their

travels,  and  with  their

small  size  and  low

strength, they need the

advantages  of  stealth

and cleverness.

Prestige  Classes:

Some  halflings  be-

come masters of the

ambush, popping up

from behind a bush

to deliver an onslaught

of  stones.  These  guardians,  the  warsling  snipers,

are  often  the  first  line  of  defense  for  a  halfling

community  and  accordingly  are  much  cherished  by  their

fellow citizens.

Lightfoot Halfling Society

Lightfoot halfling society is hard to quantify, because lightfoots

can be divided into three groups: those who live among humans,

those who live among other lightfoots, and those who wander

from place to place. Some lightfoot halfling families live their

entire  lives  in  one  place,  sometimes  as  part  of  a  human  com-

munity,  and  sometimes  in  a  settlement  populated  almost

entirely by halflings. Others live their entire lives on the roads

and byways of Faern, never remaining in one place very long.

Language and Literacy

Lightfoots speak Halfling, Common, and the language of their

home  regionwhich,  given  lightfoot  wanderlust,  could  be

almost  anywhere.  Wandering  lightfoot  halflings  pick  up  the

languages of the places they live, and often learn other widely

spread tongues.

All lightfoot nonbarbarians (the vast majority of the race, in

other words) are literate.

HALFLINGS

Lightfoot Halfling

Magic and Lore

Lightfoot  halflings  tend  to  be  generalists  when  it  comes  to

magic,  using  a  broad  array  of  spells  and  magic  items  to  make

their travelsor their hearthsmore pleasant. They are skillful

clerics and sorcerers, but sometimes lack the discipline to become

accomplished as wizards.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Because theyre almost always fighting foes who are larger than

they  are,  lightfoot  halflings  favor  spells  that  help  them  move

around the battlefield and negate the physical strength of their

foes. Expeditious retreat, fly, haste, various polymorph spells, and

especially Evards black tentacles are common spells in a halfling

spellcasters arsenal.

Some lightfoot halflings become so enamored of travel spells

that they take the Hin Wandermage feat (see the appendix).

LIGHTFOOT HALFLING MAGIC ITEMS

Lightfoot halflings are fascinated with magic that makes travel

easier  in  some  way.  Its  useful  to  travel  faster,  of  course,  but

speed  isnt  always  a  priority  to  a  lightfoot  whos  wandering

anyway. Items that make travel more comfortable or safer are

especially cherished.

Common Items: Bags of holding, Hewards handy haversack,

carpets of flying, and any magic boots can be purchased in light-

foot halfling communities for 10% less than the normal cost.

Iconic  Item:  One  of  the  most  consistent  disadvantages  half-

lings face is that their size makes it difficult for them to make

use of certain types of weapons. In response to this difficulty, a

halfling  wizard  created  the  first  hornbladesdeceptive  magic

weapons that inflict more damage than their size would suggest

(see the appendix). These weapons seem to be in the possession of

lightfoot hin more frequently than the ghostwise or strongheart,

giving  rise  to  speculation  that  perhaps  the  original  hornblade

inventor was of the lightfoot subrace.

Lightfoot Halfling Deities

The diversity evident in the lightfoot halflings outlook and soci-

ety is also reflected in their religious beliefs. Of all the hin sub-

races, the lightfoot are the most likely to worship deities other

than those belonging to Yondallas Children. In addition to the

deity they most favor, many lightfoot householdsparticularly

those that prefer life on the road to a more settled existence

often venerate a household patron, often inspired by some matri-

arch or patriarch in the familys history.

Brandobaris,  the  Master  of  Stealth,  is  much  beloved  by  the

lightfoot  hin  for  his  realistic  and  good-humored  view  of  life.

Brandobaris  is  a  common  patron  deity  of  those  halflings  who

trust  to  their  luck  to  see  them  through  as  they  wander  from

place to place.

The worship of Cyrrollalee, the Hearthkeeper, is wildly popu-

lar  among  lightfoot  halflings  born  within  the  last  two  genera-

tions.  Her  message  of  the  ascendance  of  the  halfling  race  to  a

station of respect and power in Faern has fallen on receptive

ears. The ranks of her clergy have swelled with the number of

lightfoot hin seeking to spread her message and contribute to the

search for a new lightfoot homeland.

Yondallas  faith  is  popular  with  the  lightfoot  halflings,  both

those  who  wander  and  those  who  prefer  to  settle  in  more  per-

manent  communities.  Recently  there  has  been  some  tension

between her clergy and those serving Cyrrollalee: Yondalla is not

at all certain that this younger deitys call for a halfling home-

land is wise.

Lightfoot

Halfling Equipment

These halflings favor the lightfoot warsling, a deadly and pow-

erful  version  of  the  common  sling  (see  the  appendix).  The

warsling fires skiprocks, which halflings delight in throwing with

great accuracy as well.

LIGHTFOOT ANIMALS AND PETS

Lightfoot halflings make up for their small stature by domesti-

cating some of the largest and most powerful hounds in Faern.

A  towering  human  brigand  has  a  hard  time  pushing  around  a

halfling traveler with a pair of loyal hounds at his side. See Mas-

tiff Hound, in the appendix.

Strongheart

Halflings

Regions: Luiren, Strongheart Halfling.

Racial Feats: Improved Low Blow, Low Blow, Luck of Heroes.

Racial Prestige Class: Warsling sniper.

The  strongheart  halflings  are,  like  the  ghostwise  and  lightfoot

hin, native to Luiren. They trace their ancestry back to the same

long-lost days as the other subraces, but unlike their cousins, the

stronghearts elected to remain in their homeland following the

events  of  the  Hin  Ghostwar.  The  legacy  of  Chand,  the  strong-

heart war chieftain who galvanized his tribe against the threat

of the feral ghostwise, lives on today in a nation that both rein-

forces  and  defies  many  of  the  expectations  nonhalflings  have

of this race.

History

The history of the strongheart hin is outlined in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting (page 196).

Outlook

Prior  to  the  Hin  Ghostwar,  the  stronghearts  were,  like  their

brethren, mostly a nomadic hunter-gatherer people. During the

centuries  that  followed  that  terrible  conflict,  however,  the

stronghearts  gravitated  toward  a  more  agrarian-based  lifestyle

centered  around  permanent  communities.  But  if  the  communi-

ties  were  stationery,  the  stronghearts  were  not,  moving  from

established community to established community.

This strange duality of nature, consisting of a desire to move

about  freely  with  a  liking  for  permanent  structures  and  settle-

ments,  has  produced  some  unusual  outlooks  among  the  strong-

hearts of Luiren. Their viewpoint stresses cooperation above all

other traits, and the ability to work as a team is the most valued

behavior in their land. Cooperation transcends many boundaries

in Luiren, and even strangers of whom the locals are suspicious

can earn themselves considerable credit and tolerance by demon-

strating a willingness to cooperate.

STRONGHEART HALFLING CHARACTERS

Stronghearts  have  relatively  more  clerics  and

martial characters (fighters, rangers, and paladins)

than their lightfoot cousins, but the skilled rogue

is  still  the  most  common  character  class

among strongheart adventurers.

Favored Class: Rogue. Strongheart

halflings can be tricky, clever warriors

or glib negotiatorsor both.

Strongheart

Halfling Society

The  stronghearts  have  evolved  a

unique, semi-nomadic lifestyle, in which

businesses, families, and even entire clans

move  freely  and  independently  from

place  to  place  within  Luiren.  This

fusion of wanderlust and stability is a

source of wonderment and confusion for visitors,

who  find  it  difficult  to  comprehend  how  a

society  can  enjoy  such  seemingly  whimsical

mobility while retaining any viable structure.

For  their  part,  most  of  the  strongheart  hin

cannot understand why anyone would want to tie themselves

permanently  to  any  one  community  or  structure  for  their

entire lives.

Language and Literacy

Strongheart halflings speak Halfling and Common, and many

pick  up  Shaaran  as  well.  All  but  the  very  rare  barbarians

are literate.

Strongheart Halfling

Magic and Lore

Strongheart halflings invest more magic in their communities

than  lightfoot  or  ghostwise  halflings.  Stationary  magic  items

are  far  more  common;  strongheart  communities  have  every-

thing from continual flames lighting the town square at night

to city walls that magically repel enemy arrows. Not every vil-

lage has such wonders, for the stronghearts arent profligate in

their  spellcasting.  But  most  strongheart  spellcasters  devote

their efforts to improving the lot of their communitieseven

if the spellcasters themselves will be moving on once their work

is done.

Strongheart

Halfling Deities

The scrupulous stronghearts of Luiren take care to honor all the

deities in the halfling pantheon, but their way of life reflects the

influence of certain powers more than others. They do not favor

any deities from other pantheons, and they actively discourage

halflings from venerating the gods and goddesses of other races.

Among all the Faernian halfling subraces, Arvoreen enjoys

the strongest worship from the stronghearts of Luiren. While

the Luiren hin venerate all the deities of the halfling pantheon

in  their  turn,  they  hold  the  Vigilant  Guardian  in  very

high regard. His simple dogma has almost become the

de  facto  motto  of  the  nation:  Vigilance  against

attack  will  protect  the  community.  Prepare  an

active  defense,  drill  continuously,  and

leave nothing to chance. Put down danger

before  allowing  it  a  chance  to  rear  its

head. Clerics of the Wary Sword are

among  the  nations  foremost  reli-

gious, political, and military leaders;

most of them multiclass as fighters.

Strongheart  druids  and  rangers

frequently venerate Sheela Peryroyl,

the Green Sister, and they encourage

their  fellow  hin  to  be  mindful  of  the

need to balance their communities expan-

sions with the need to preserve nature.

Most  strongheart  communities  in

Luiren maintain shrines to the Watch-

ful Mother, usually on the edge of the set-

tled area where it borders the wilderness.

Yondalla, the Blessed One, is the most popular

halfling deity after Avoreen among the strong-

hearts. Many of the subrace who dwell in Luiren

find  the  dichotomy  of  her  faithdo  not  wel-

come violence, but defend the home and community fiercely

to  be  reflective  of  the  strongheart  outlook.  Yondalla  reigns

supreme in Luiren whenever matters of family and tradition are

invoked, and her clergy enjoys considerable respect and influence

in the most important national councils.

Strongheart Halfling

Equipment

The  strongheart  hin  understand  that  they  must  be  ready  to

defend their homes and nation literally at a moments notice.

They cannot know when a hostile creature or enemy force may

launch an attack from the Luirwood or the Toadsquat Moun-

tains. They have learned from bitter experience that its best to

be prepared, even when engaged in such mundane activities as

husbandry  and  traveling.  Therefore  they  have  developed  such

devices  as  the  wagon  shields  (see  the  appendix),  which  can  be

used to bolster defenses even in the most unlikely situations.

With lifespans that flash by in the blink of

an  elven  eye,  humans  must  make  the

most of their lives in the limited num-

ber of years given to them. Their energy and passion allows them

to  accomplish  great  things,  yet  their  relative  lack  of  historical

perspective ensures that many of their greatest accomplishments

will fall to dust, worn down by the sands of time.

This chapter details the seven major human ethnic groups of

northern and central Faern, whose cultural, linguistic, physical,

and religious traits predominate in that region of Toril. Five of

the  major  groups  are  descended  from  ancient  tribes,  including

the Calishites, Chondathans, Illuskans, Mulan, and Rashemi. Two

more  groups,  the  Damarans  and  Tethyrians,  have  arisen  in

recent centuries from melting pot cultures. A number of other

human  ethnic  groups  are  touched  on  briefly  as  well,  giving  a

flavor of humanitys incredible diversity. Some have vanished or

all but vanished from the face of Abeir-Toril and are mentioned

only  to  give  a  historical  context  for  modern  societies,  while

others are numerous but rarely seen in the heartlands of Faern.

Overview

Humanity is numbered as one of the five Creator Races, albeit

the last and most primitive. However, like many other sentient

races, not all humans originated on Abeir-Toril; many humans

alive in Faern today are descended, at least in part, from immi-

grants  from  other  worlds.  Although  they  are  the  most  recent

race to achieve dominance here, humanity is found all across the

surface lands of Faern, from the arctic wastes of the Great Glac-

ier to the steaming jungles of Chult.

Unlike the other humanoid races, humans are not segregated

into easily identifiable subraces with distinct racial traits. How-

ever, humans do vary greatly in appearance and are divided into

innumerable  competing  nations,  states,  sects,  religions,  bandit

kingdoms, and tribes.

The root of humanitys many divisions lies in the races frag-

mented history. Whereas elves and dwarves are interloper races

who  arrived  in  a  few  major  migrations  with  unifying  cultural

traits, humans coalesced into tribes and developed local cultures

across Abeir-Toril wholly independent of one another. The earli-

est human cultures arose in the shadow of other, more powerful

races,  including  the  other  Creator  Races,  the  elves,  and  the

dwarves.  The  dominance  of  these  other  races  kept  the  various

human cultures largely ignorant of one another and barred com-

munications until relatively recently in Faerns history.

As  humanity  can  be  segregated  along  historical,  cultural,

linguistic, and religious lines, there are many ways to subdivide

the humans of Faern. Any distinctions are inevitably muddled,

as centuries of settlement and conquest have ensured that no

Although  published  FORGOTTEN REALMS game  material  has

long included references to various human ethnic groups, the

division is absolute. In fact, in some regions of Faern, melting

pot cultures founded by two or more distinct ethnic groups, none

of them dominant, are establishing distinct cultural and linguis-

tic identities that mark the emergence of newly distinct ethnic

identities different from their forebears.

Human, Calishite

Regions: Amn, Calimshan, Dragon Coast, Lake of Steam, Nelan-

ther  Isles,  the  Shaar,  Tethyr,  Vilhon  Reach,  Western  Heart-

lands, Calishite.

Racial Feats: Calishite Elementalist, Genie Lore, Harem Trained.

Since the fall of the great genie empires that once ruled south of

the Marching Mountains, humans descended from the slaves of

the genie lords have ruled the successive empires of Calimshan.

From  the  shores  of  the  Shining  Sea,  Calishites  have  migrated

northwards in large numbers as far as the Fields of the Dead and

the  Nelanther  Isles,  and  eastward  into  the  Lake  of  Steam,  the

Border Kingdoms, Lapaliiya, and the Shaar. Some fled disasters

in  their  homeland  or  sought  new  economic  opportunities,  but

most came as conquerors under the banner of the Shoon Empire.

Outside their homeland, Calishites form the primary racial stock

of  the  Border  Kingdoms,  the  Lake  of  Steam  cities,  and  the

Nelanther Isles. Calishites also comprise a large fraction of the

population of Amn and Tethyr. Calishite ancestry, language, and

culture have influenced all the lands nearby.

Calishites regard themselves as the rightful rulers of all lands

south  and  west  of  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Stars,  a  birthright  passed

down to them by the genies who once ruled the lands between the

Marching Mountains and the Shining Sea. Calishites point with

pride to the unbroken line of Calishite empires dating back thou-

sands of years. With the notable exception of the Mulan, whom

they consider their equals, Calishites consider themselves cultur-

ally superior to the hordes of unwashed barbarians that dwell

beyond their lands.

Although  often  perceived  by  other  cultures  as  avaricious,

lazy, and corrupt, in truth most Calishites seek nothing more

than a lifestyle of comfort and the respect of their peers. Cal-

ishites hold the circumstances of an individuals birth as equal in

importance  to  his  or  her  achievements.  The  class  system  is

strongly ingrained in most Calishites, as is the ideal of a life of

pampered  luxury.  Money  is  simply  the  means  by  which  one

achieves idleness. Calishites place great stock in pridein ones

own achievements, family, city, and culture. Family and the role

as host are likewise held in great esteem. Magic use is ubiquitous,

rivaled  only  by  the  natives  of  Halruaa,  and  genies  are  both

highly respected and feared.

Although  all  natives  of  Calimshan  are  known  as  Calishites,

only those whose ancestry dates back to the slaves brought from

other worlds thousands of years ago are considered members of

this ethnic group. Calishites are a bit shorter and of slighter build

than other humans. Their skin is dusky brown, and their hair and

eyes are most commonly of that shade as well.

Calishites make skilled rogues, fighters, and  wizards, and the

legacy of ancient genie bloodlines ensures that many are power-

ful sorcerers as well. Religious fervor and monastic devotion are

largely absent among most Calishites, except among the clerics

of  Ilmatar  who  minister  to  the  poor,  and  the  Tyrrans  who

uphold justice.

The history of the Calishite people is largely the history of Cal-

imshan, detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Outlook

Calishites believe their culture is the only bastion of civilization

on the Sword Coast and Shining Sea, if not the entire surface of

Faern. To the descendants of a 7,000-year-old empire, the short-

lived  barbarian  cultures  of  the  northern  lands  are  barely

worthy of notice. Calishite arrogance is nurtured and codified in

the class and gender divisions within their society, with a persons

station  at  birth  playing  an  important  role  in  how  he  or  she  is

measured. Although few speak of the class system in Calimshan

or the lesser status of women, most Calishites live out their lives

according to their station, risking death or enslavement if they

do not. Calishites dwelling in the old Imperial lands view them-

selves as superior to non-Calishites and often act as if the Shoon

Imperium had never fallen. Likewise, Calishites dwelling within

the  borders  of  Calimshan  view  themselves  as  superior  to  their

provincial cousins.

Calishites  are  typically  drawn  to  adventuring  in  hopes  of

quickly amassing a great fortune that will allow them to retire

to a life of idle luxury. Those of lower birth often see the life of

an adventurer as a way to escape the strictures of their station in

distant lands where the status of their birth is unknown. A few

Calishite adventurers see themselves as guardians of an ancient

culture  and  commit  themselves  to  recovering  ancient  Calishite

treasures that have been lost amid the unwashed hordes of the

northern realms.

CALISHITE CHARACTERS

Magic has long played a role in Calishite culture, making both

wizards  and  sorcerers  commonplace.  The  latter  group  consists

largely  of  Calishites  who  can  trace  their  ancestry  back  to  the

genies who once ruled the Calim Empire and Memnonnar. The

influence of various faiths has waxed and waned in Calishite cul-

ture, but clerics and monks have rarely played an important role.

Whereas monks located elsewhere on Toril have strong martial

and mystic traditions and are responsible for the preservation of

the lore of fallen realms, the monks of Calimshan devote their

energies to relieving the suffering of the lower classes.

Perhaps the most common classes among Calishites are rogue,

fighter, and fighter/rogue, for the history of Calimshan and the

states  it  once  dominated  is  strewn  with  bloodshed,  corruption,

and  thievery.  Calishite  barbarians  are  almost  unknown,  except

among the nomads of the Lands of the Lion. Likewise, bards are

rarely seen outside Calishite harems, and there is no druidic tra-

dition  within  Calishite  culture.  Calishite  paladins  are  almost

unknown outside the church of Tyr and the city-state of Saelmur.

Prestige Classes: Calishites have a long tradition of assassina-

tion as a tool of political influence and personal vendettas, so

the assassin is a common prestige class in Calimshan. Secretive

guilds  of  lower-class  rogues  sometimes  study  the  mysterious

arts of the shadowdancer, or more commonly take up the guild

thief prestige class. Powerful Calishite wizards often choose to

become archmages.

81

HUMANS

Calishite Society

Traditional  Calishite  culture  varies  little  across  Faern,  even

among Calishites who dwell outside the borders of Calimshan.

Although exceptions exist, Calishites strictly adhere to the tra-

ditional  roles  of  their  social  class.  In  ascending  order,  those

classes are the slaves, the labor class, the skilled labor class, the

merchant class, the military, the advisor class, and the ruling

class. From birth, Calishites are raised to recognize such class dis-

tinctions and treat others accordingly, even though many class

distinctions are lost upon outsiders. Hard work and thriftiness

are not held up as ideals, although many successful Calishites got

that  way  through  such  vices.  Instead,  luxury  and  pampered

idleness are seen as the ideal, and many Calishites will do what-

ever it takes to acquire such a lifestyle. Calishite culture has long

harbored a fascination with food and magic, particularly magic

that reduces the need for labor, so meals and frivolous magic

items play a large role in Calishite daily life.

Calishites revere their immediate family and show more loy-

alty to their kin than they do to their deities or employers. Men

are  expected  to  enter  into  business  and  support  their  familys

standard of living. Women are expected to maintain the home,

raise the children, and manage the funds. Children are always

educated  in  the  home  unless  they  have  a  strong  aptitude  for

magical schooling. Those parents who can afford them employ

tutors  and  wizards.  Upon  reaching  the  age  of  majority  (15

years), children are expected to marry and establish themselves

within  five  years.  Only  women  may  marry  above  their  social

class. Those who fail to marry are disgraced and must either live

with their parents in shameful charity or be ejected from the

household  (many  Calishite  adventurers  active  in  other  lands

once fell into the latter category). Children are also expected to

care  for  their  elderly  relatives  and  to  give  them  an  opulent

funeral upon death.

Social moves are particularly scrutinized within Calishite cul-

ture,  engendering  an  emphasis  on  maintaining  ones  personal

and familial pride. Saving face demands that a Calishite treat

others  as  they  present  themselves,  regardless  of  whether  such

faades  bear  any  resemblance  to  the  truth.  Once  a  person  or

family loses face, they also lose status and may be relegated to

a lower class. Privacy is a most precious commodity, for it allows

an individual to act as he or she wishes without needing to save

face. Calishites also place great stock in hospitality, with strictly

defined responsibilities for both guest and host. Guests cannot

inflict harm on their host while receiving his or her hospitality.

Likewise,  hosts  must  display  as  much  generosity  as  they  can

afford and protect their guests from harm, for to do otherwise

is to lose face.

Language and Literacy

The native tongue of Calishites is Alzhedo, a language derived

millennia  ago  from  Midani  (the  language  of  Zakhara)  and

Auran. Alzhedo is one of the two major root tongues of both

Thorass (Old Common) and Common. Alzhedo employs the

Thorass alphabet, a set of characters used to represent the trade

tongue  that  came  into  use  thousands  of  years  ago  along  the

shores of the Lake of Steam. Most Calishites also speak Com-

mon, particularly the singsong Calant dialect. Those who trade

with  or  live  in  the  Realms  Below  prefer  Undercommon,  the

trade language of the Underdark.

Given their extensive contacts with geniekind, Calishites often

learn Auran or Ignan. Other common second languages include

Chultan, Halfling, Lantanese, Shaaran, or Tashalan, languages

spoken by many who dwell along the shores of the Shining Sea.

Few Calishites learn other nonhuman tongues.

All  Calishite  characters  are  literate  except  for  barbarians

and commoners (that is, characters with the commoner NPC

class described in the DMG), who must spend skill points to

acquire literacy.

Calishite Magic and Lore

Calishites have a strong arcane spellcasting tradition, in part a

legacy of the genies who once ruled the lands now claimed by

Calimshan.  Many  Calishite  wizards  and  sorcerers  favor  the

school of Evocation, mastering a great number of fire and wind

spells. Although rare, necromancers are not unknown as well, a

spellcasting tradition dating back to the court of the Necroqysar,

Shoon IV. Shadow weave magic, although still largely unknown,

is attracting an increasingly large set of adherents. The divine

spellcasting tradition among Calishites is essentially restricted to

clerics, who also favor spells of air and fire.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Calishites favor spells that ensure personal comfort or defense,

summon  creatures  from  the  elemental  planes,  or  otherwise

unleash  the  elements.  Despite  the  widespread  use  of  magic

throughout Calimshan, Calishite spellcasters are not well known

for creating new spells, except for a brief surge of experimen-

tation during the Age of Shoon. Some scholars attribute this cul-

tural  characteristic  to  the  traditional  Calishite  penchant  for

indolence, while others claim it derives from a reverence for tra-

dition at the expense of innovation.

Spellcasting Tradition: The study of arcane spells harnessing

the power of the elements is the highest form of the Art in Cal-

imshan.  Many  Calishite  sorcerers  and  wizards  consider  them-

selves air or fire elementalists. The Calishite Elementalist feat,

described in the appendix, reflects this tradition of magic.

Unique Spells: None.

CALISHITE MAGIC ITEMS

Magic is an important aspect of Calishite culture, and many

mundane objects are crafted to pamper the whims of Calim-

shans idle rich. Doors and gates that recognize those allowed

inside  and  open  automatically  for  them,  clothing  that  sheds

stains and dirt, torches that extinguish and relight automati-

cally as needed, or levitating feather fans to keep air circula-

tion constant and cool are all examples of Calishite arts of this

sort. Weapons are generally crafted with flaming, keen, shock,

and spell-storing special abilities, reflecting Calishite cultures

longstanding fascination with magic and the elemental natures

of geniekind.

Common  Magic  Items:  Commonly  manufactured  Calishite

items include carpets of flying, efreeti bottles, horseshoes of the

zephyr, pearls of power, pearls of the sirines, rings of djinni call-

ing, rings of mind shielding, and slippers of spider climbing. Due

to the prevalence of these items in Calishite society, they may

be purchased at a 10% discount in any large city in Calimshan.

HUMANS

Iconic Magic Items: The scimitar of the sirocco is made in Cal-

imshan.  This  weapon  is  highly  prized  by  Calishite  nobles  and

adventurers. Many warriors of Calimshan wear Calishite mail

(see the appendix).

Calishite Deities

Various Calishite faiths and religious practices have waxed and

waned in popularity since the Time of Genies. At various times

in history, the Calishite religious tradition has included the wor-

ship of dark, forgotten deities, the veneration of genies as divine

beings, and the belief in a single sun god. In modern times, Cal-

ishites worship the deities of the Faernian pantheon, and the

folk  of  Calimshan  pride  themselves  upon  accepting  all  creeds

and  religions.  Although  Calimshan  contains  major  temples  to

the  lions  share  of  the  deities  worshiped  in  Faern,  ten  faiths

have long been prominent in Calishite society, suggesting that

some or all those deities may have once formed the kernel of an

ancient  Calishite  pantheon.  Those  deities  include  Tyr,  Azuth,

Talos,  Shar,  Ilmater,  Savras,  Sharess,  Siamorphe,  Umberlee,

and Waukeen.

northern  barbarian).  Only  the  Mulan  receive  any  measure  of

respect from Calishites, as their culture is nearly as long-lived as

that of Calimshan.

Despite  their  disdain  or  dismissal  of  other  human  cultures,

Calishites  have  decent  relations  with  members  of  other  races.

Dwarves and gnomes are valued for their skill in metalworking,

although many shield dwarves have not forgotten the role Cal-

ishites played in the fall of Shanatar. Elves and half-elves are

both distrusted and envied. The former status derives from Cal-

imshans  long  history  of  animosity  with  neighboring  elven

nations, such as long-vanished Keltormir. The latter stems from

the inherently magical nature of the Fair Folk, which magic-

crazed  Calishites  cannot  duplicate.  Halflings  have  long  been

enslaved by Calishites, and, as a result, most Calishites classify

all halflings as members of the lower class. In turn, halflings (at

least those who dwell along the Sword Coast and whose ancestors

fled  Calimshan)  regard  Calishites  with  suspicion,  viewing  all

humans of this ethnic group as potential slavers. Curiously, half-

orcs often receive better treatment from Calishites than they do

from other human societies. Although they are invariably seen

as members of the lower class, in that respect they are seen as

no better or worse than Calishites of low birth-status.

Relations with Other Races

Calishites  have  poor  relations  with  members  of  all  other

human ethnic groups, particularly Tethyrians (who are gener-

ally viewed as members of the lower class, regardless of birth)

and  Illuskans  (who  are  seen  as  the  epitome  of  the  unwashed

Calishite Equipment

Calishites favor loose-fitting, airy clothing appropriate for hot

climes.  Almost  all  adopt  the  traditional  keffiyeh  (headcloth)

that covers the head and hangs down the neck.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Due to the scorching heat of their homeland, Calishite warriors

do  not  often  wear  medium  or  heavy  armor.  They  favor  chain

shirts, and shields are common. If necessary, well-off Calishites

wear full chainmail, but even then the ever-present heat means

that this is reserved for situations in which battle is imminent.

Calishites favor curved blades and view the scimitar as the per-

fect weapon, a deadly and beautiful blade well suited for mounted

combat  against  lightly  armored  foes.  Daggers  are  even  more

common,  especially  the  jambiya  (hooked  dagger)  and  the  katar

(punching dagger). Calishites employ shortbows as missile weap-

ons, a martial tradition adopted from the elves of long-vanished

Keltormir.

Common  Items:  Chain  shirt,  scimitar,  falchion,  composite

shortbow.

Unique Item: The jambiya, a hooked dagger worn by almost

all Calishite men. See the Equipment section of the appendix

for details.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Calishites favor small creatures of a magical nature as pets and

familiarsthe  more  exotic  the  better,  such  as  shocker  lizards

and  tressyms.  Mephits,  particularly  air,  dust,  fire,  and  steam

mephits,  and  small  elementals,  particularly  those  drawn  from

the Elemental Planes of Air and Fire, are commonly summoned

by Calishite conjurers.

Among animals, trained falcons and dogs are most common.

For steeds, Calishites employ camels in the vicinity of the Calim

Desert and horses elsewhere. They favor light warhorses, as few

Calishite warriors wear heavy armor or rely on clumsy weapons

such  as  the  heavy  lance  in  battle.  Flying  steeds,  including  hip-

pogriffs,  griffons,  and  pegasi,  are  highly  favored  by  those  who

can acquire them.

Calishite Region

Most characters of Calishite descent choose the Calimshan char-

acter  region,  which  reflects  a  character  from  the  sophisticated

cities  of  the  country.  The  Calishite  region  described  here

embraces  Calishites  from  the  wild  hinterland  of  the  country,

such as the lands west of the Alamir Mountains or the Lands of

the Lion, east of Tethyrs forests.

Preferred  Classes:  The  Calishite  region  is  preferred  by  bards,

fighters,  sorcerers,  and  wizards.  A  character  of  one  of  these

classes  may  choose  a  regional  feat  and  gain  his  choice  of  the

bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character. A Calishite char-

Chondathans are hardy folk, not afraid to take risks, travel, or

settle new lands, and are always looking to better themselves

and their families monetarily. As Chondathan culture has taken

root in so many distant lands, Chondathans are comfortable in

most  human  societies.  Many  Chondathans  are  merchants  of

one sort or another, selling their skills and the fruits of their

labors for coin. Although Chondathans make skilled mercenar-

ies and cunning rogues, Chondathan culture has not encouraged

study of the Art or great religious fervor. Notable exceptions

exist, particularly in the study of the Art among the Netherese-

influenced Chondathan cultures that lie north and west of the

Inner Sea.

From the cradle of the Vilhon Reach, Chondathan emigrants

have settled most of the western and central Inner Sea region

as well as much of the Western Heartlands. Outside their home-

land, Chondathans form the primary racial stock of Altumbel,

Cormyr, the southern Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, the Great

Dale, Hlondeth and the north shore of the Vilhon Reach, the

Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, Sembia, and Sespech. Thanks to far-

wandering  Chondathan  traders,  the  Chondathan  tongue  is

spoken even in regions where the number of pureblooded Chon-

dathans  is  small  or  nearly  nonexistent.  Chondathan  ancestry,

language, and culture form a significant portion of Damaran,

Vaasan, and Tethyrian heritage.

Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair

ranging from almost blond to almost black. Most Chondathans

are tall and have green or brown eyes, but all builds and hair and

eye hues may be seen. Those Chondathans who dwell north and

west  of  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Stars  (except  in  Sembia)  are  more

likely to have blue eyes and have fairer complexions and darker

hair  than  those  born  in  the  South,  evidence  of  a  significant

Netherese heritage. In Chondath itself, particularly in the lands

bordering  Sespech,  a  significant  Shaaran  influx  in  recent  cen-

turies has given many natives of Chondath more of an olive-

skinned hue.

Chondathans regard themselves as having come to dominate

central Faern almost by accident; they have conquered more

land  through  trade  and  settlement  than  with  armies.  They

show little arrogance and only a small amount of pride regard-

ing the predominance of their language and culture. Likewise,

Chondathans  are  more  apt  to  identify  themselves  by  their

national  origins  (such  as  Cormyrean,  Dalesfolk,  or  Sembian)

than by their ethnic group. If Chondathans do have a common

vice, it is perhaps their cultural focus on wealth and its acqui-

sition. Among Chondathans, prestige and influence are often

directly tied to wealth, and it is no accident that the merchant

nobility  plays  a  strong  role  in  most  societies  influenced  by

Chondathan culture.

HUMANS

History

Chondathans trace their ancestry back to the Twelve Cities of

Swords in ancient Jhaamdath, founded around 5800 DR by the

great  warrior-king  Jhaam.  Jhaamdath  lay  north  of  the  Chon-

dalwood along the south shore of the Vilhon Reach, with out-

posts stretching from the Dragon Coast to the Akanal. Only the

great Chondalwood defied Jhaamdaths dominion, the human

armies and axes held at bay for many years by the wood elves

of Nikerymath.

In  5032  DR,  Jhaamdath  clashed  with  the  Kingdoms  of

Mir and Coramshan over control of the Lake of

Steam, precipitating the unification of Calim-

shan. After several decades of fighting, Cal-

imshan and Jhaamdath agreed to a truce in

5005 DR. In the millennia that followed,

Jhaamdath sank into stagnation, its inhab-

itants becoming increasingly xenophobic

and  withdrawn.  Jhaamdath  even  fell

under  the  sway  of  Unther  from

roughly  1500  DR  to  1069  DR.

Not  until 276 DR did Jhaamdaths

inhabitants  turn  outward  once  again,

after  Jhaamdaths  last  warlord  seized

power and called for the building of a

strong  navy  to  sail  out  upon  the

Inner  Sea  and  conquer  new  lands.

Such  ship-building  required  the

felling  of  many  trees,  a  move  that

reignited  war  between  Jhaamdath  and

elven-ruled Nikerymath and led to the

elven realms destruction.

Seeking  vengeance,  four  High

Mages  of  Nikerymath  unleashed  a

gargantuan tidal wave that roared up

Jhaamdaths bay, smashing the Twelve

Cities  of  Swords  and  reshaping  the

topography into what is known today as

the Vilhon Reach. The actions of the High Mages were not with-

out consequence, however, for their Art precipitated the fall of

the  sea  elven  empire  of  Aryselmalyr  and  unleashed  an  inex-

orable tide of humanity that eventually displaced most of the

elven realms of northcentral Faern.

Chondathan

Many of those who survived the Year of the Furious Waves

(255  DR)  set  out  to  colonize  lands  that  would  later  become

known as Impiltur, Thesk, and the Vast, in a vast tide of prag-

matic  prospectors,  elf-hating  soldiers,  merchants,  and  a  sprin-

kling of peaceful scholars and farmers. After occupying much of

the northcentral Inner Sea region, the descendants of Jhaam-

dath began migrating westward from Impiltur in the year 1 DR,

settling the Dalelands and the northern shore of the Dragon-

mere. The latter group founded the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr

in 26 DR under the rule of House Obarskyr.

Back  in  the  Vilhon  Reach,  those  who  remained  established

new  cities  around  the  year  50  DR,  including  Iljak,  Mussam,

Samra,  and  Arrabar.  After  suffering  yet  another  plague  and

again incurring the wrath of the elves of Chondalwood, the cities

united to form Chondath in 139 DR. Chondath has existed ever

since, although it was reduced to little more than a collection of

city-states during the Elfblade Stand of 877 DR and the Rotting

War of 900902 DR.

A third wave of Chondathan migration occurred in the 380s

DR,  when  settlers  from  Chondath  established  the  colonies  of

Chancelgaunt (later Selgaunt) and Chondathan (later Saerloon)

along the coast of what would later become the Merchant King-

dom of Sembia. Hostilities with the elves of Cormanthyr led to

defeat at the Battle of Singing Arrows (884 DR) and led Chon-

dath to renounce the governance of its far-flung colonies in the

aftermath of the Rotting War. This in turn led to the founding

of Sembia, the Land of the Silver Raven, in 913 DR.

Traders from Sembia and, to a lesser extent, Cormyr and the

Dalelands continued west and northwest in smaller numbers in

the centuries that followed, spreading Chondathan culture and

language from Tethyr to the Savage Frontier. The rise of Sil-

verymoon as a center of magical study in 659 DR

precipitated  the  migration  of  a  small,

but  influential,  number  of  Chon-

dathans  to  Silverymoon  and  estab-

lished  Chondathan  culture  and

language  in  a  land  that  had  only

been reached by a handful of Chon-

dathan merchants until that time.

Today,  Chondathan  culture  and

language  dominates  much  of  cen-

tral  and  western  Faern.  Thorass,

the alphabet that arose from interac-

tions  between  Jhaamdath  and

the Old Kingdoms of Calimshan,

is  commonly  employed  as  the

alphabet of most human tongues.

Moreover,  Common,  the  trade

language  of  Faern,  is  simply  a

modern  version  of  Thorass  (  Old

Common),  which  in  turn  was

largely  based  on  Jhaamdathan

(Old Chondathan) and Alzhedo,

the  language  of  Calimshan.

While the Calishites, the Imaskari,

the Mulan, and the Netherese may

have  each  forged  the  greatest  human

empires of Faern in their day, it is the Chondathans whose cul-

ture now predominates, an empire spread by commerce and coin,

not by sword or staff.

Outlook

Chondathans measure others by how much wealth and influence

a person or family has acquired. To a Chondathan, all things are

for sale, assuming one can agree upon a price. Intrigue and covert

manipulation are simply means to an end, but unnecessary blood-

shed  is  destructive  and  wasteful.  Chondathans  have  found  that

power  inevitably  swings  to  whoever  controls  the  purse  strings,

not whoever carries the biggest sword, and set their aspirations

accordingly. Fierce competition in all walks of life is the guiding

rule of Chondathan society, and those raised within its confines

are used to seeing fortunes won or lost, with commensurate gains

or losses in stature. Chondathans expect each individual to look

out  for  himself  or  herself,  and  they  are  often  surprised  when

others act selflessly.

Chondathans are drawn to adventuring for one of two reasons:

Some  take  up  arms  and  spells  to  defend  that  which  they  hold

most dear, a tradition harkening back to the early Chondathan

settlers.  Others  are  drawn  to  a  life  on  the  road  by  the  same

85

HUMANS

impulses that send Chondathan merchants into unfamiliar lands

in search of trading opportunities, a hunger to search for wealth

in the unknown. Most Chondathans who adopt adventuring as a

career  are  drawn  to  the  potential  of  acquiring  great  wealth  by

looting some long-forgotten tomb or recovering some fabulous

treasure from an ancient ruin.

CHONDATHAN CHARACTERS

Chondathans typically make good fighters, drawing on their cul-

tures long-standing mercenary tradition. Likewise, many Chon-

dathans find their calling as rogues, a product of their cultures

emphasis  on  the  acquisition  of  wealth  and  the  wide  range  of

skills. The most common multiclass combination among Chon-

dathans is fighter/rogue. Chondathans are rarely barbarians, sor-

cerers, or wizards, as no sizable group of Chondathans has ever

reverted  into  barbarism;  ancient  Jhaamdath  had  relatively  few

relations with dragons, social or otherwise; and wizardry has long

been  associated  with  the  unleashing  of  plagues  in  Chondathan

folklore.  Those  Chondathan  sorcerers  who  do  exist  usually  hail

from  lands  north  and  west  of  the  Inner  Sea  and  have  one  or

more High Netherese ancestors in their heritage.

Prestige Classes: Chondathans often take up the study of the

divinely inspired prestige classes, such as arcane devotee, divine

champion,  divine  disciple,  divine  seeker,  and  hierophant.  Chon-

dathans  worship  evil  deities  as  well  as  good,  so  blackguards  are

not  unusual  among  evil-aligned  members  of  this  ethnic  group.

Many Harpers are of Chondathan heritage, so the Harper scout

prestige class is also common. Similarly, the folk of Cormyr are

largely of Chondathan descent, so many Purple Dragon knights

are Chondathans.

Chondathan Society

Chondathan  culture  varies  widely  across  Faern.  Compared  to

other  cultures,  particularly  Calishite  and  Mulan,  Chondathan

societies have relatively weak class divisions. Hard work and good

fortune have been enough to catapult more than one member of

the lower classes into the merchant nobility. Commerce plays an

important role in all Chondathan-dominated cultures, giving rise

to  the  maxim  that  everything  is  for  sale  at  some  price.  Chon-

dathans honor their word, although not for moral reasons. Ones

reputation is like a purse with a fixed number of coins that, once

squandered, is costly to repurchase.

As  Chondathans  place  a  high  value  on  book  learning,  many

receive some amount of schooling while growing up. Chondathan

youths  are  apprenticed  to  a  master  by  the  age  of  12  and  are

expected  to  learn  a  trade  during  their  apprenticeship.  Chon-

dathans  have  little  patience  for  able-bodied  indigents,  and  all

adults are expected to earn their own keep in whatever field they

were  trained.  Wealthy  persons  are  afforded  great  respect  in

Chondathan  societies,  and  those  who  squander  money  foolishly

are looked down upon. Chondathans are expected to work until

no  longer  physically  capable  or  until  death.  Even  those  too

infirm to earn a living often pass their days at their former place

of work, offering advice to those who have replaced them.

Outside  Chondathan-dominated  lands,  Chondathans  strive  to

integrate  into  the  local  culture,  even  if  that  means  learning  a

new  tongue  or  converting  to  the  worship  of  the  local  gods.  Of

course, such integration strategies do not interfere with sharing

Chondathan  necessities  and  customs  with  the  local  populace,  a

practice that over time slowly subsumes the local culture. Chon-

dathan  minorities  usually  organize  themselves  into  merchant

houses or trading costers for protection and to maximize their

opportunities for profit.

Language and Literacy

Chondathans  speak  Common  and  Chondathan,  two  closely

related  tongues.  Chondathan,  one  of  the  root  tongues  of

Common,  is  the  modern  form  of  Jhaamdathan  (Old  Chonda-

than),  which  was  one  of  two  root  tongues  of  Thorass  (Old

Common). Chondathan employs the Thorass alphabet, a set of

characters used to represent the trade tongue that came into use

thousands of years ago along the shores of the Lake of Steam.

As many Chondathans dwell amid other human cultures (or at

least  have  extensive  trade  contacts  with  such  societies),  many

individuals learn the local tongue or the language of their near-

est neighbor. Commonly learned second languages include Illus-

kan if the individual in question lives in the Western Heartlands

or  the  North,  Damaran  if  she  lives  in  northcentral  Faern,

Shaaran  if  she  lives  south  of  the  Vilhon  Reach,  Turami  if  she

lives on the northern shore of the Vilhon Reach, or Alzhedo if

she lives along the shores of the Lake of Steam. Spellcasters, par-

ticularly  those  who  dwell  in  Cormyr  or  the  Dalelands,  usually

learn Netherese and Elven in order to acquire magic from old

sources.  Few  Chondathans  outside  those  areas  learn  Elven,  a

legacy  of  generations  of  conflict  and  a  likely  contributor  to

future conflicts.

All Chondathan characters are literate except for barbarians.

Chondathan

Magic and Lore

Chondathans do not have a strong arcane spellcasting tradition,

nor do Chondathan bloodlines include the ancestry that gives rise

to a great number of sorcerers. However, many Chondathans are

drawn to the divine and become clerics or druids. In their great

diaspora of a thousand years past, the Chondathans carried the

worship of many of their gods to all corners of Faern; its some-

times  said  that  Chondathans  conquered  a  continent  with  their

gold and their gods.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Chondathans  who  study  wizardry  remain  generalists,  become

transmuters for the wide spell selection, or learn the abjurers art

for the protection such spells afford.

Spellcasting Tradition: Chondathans have strong divine spell-

casting  traditions,  especially  among  those  devoted  to  deities

attuned to nature, including druids and rangers. Any spell that

helps travel across the far-flung Chondathan lands is appreciated,

whether its a lowly rope trick for a safe evenings rest or a pow-

erful wind walk spell. Also favored are divine spells that assist

in commerce, such as zone of truth, sending, tongues, and mark of

justice (to enforce contracts). Among Chondathan clerics charged

with  spreading  the  faith,  the  Chondathan  Missionary  feat  (see

the appendix) is common.

Unique Spells: The widespread nature of Chondathan culture,

combined with the lack of an arcane spellcasting tradition among

Chondathans  (except  where  introduced  by  Netherese  refugees),

86

HUMANS

has ensured that few spells are uniquely associated with Chonda-

than culture. The plague magics of ancient Jhaamdath, such as

mass contagion and plague carrier (see the appendix), are much

feared for their fell effects but are fortunately recorded only in

long-hidden tomes.

CHONDATHAN MAGIC ITEMS

Chondathans favor magic items that provide personal protec-

tion or comfort, facilitate travel, guard against theft, and enable

the surreptitious gathering of information. Swords and daggers

are commonly crafted with defending, keen, and speed special

abilities. Armor is typically crafted with arrow deflection, for-

tification, and spell resistance special abilities, reflecting Chon-

dathan cultures long-standing fear of elves and rogues.

Common  Magic  Items:  Hand  of  the  mage,  hat  of  disguise,

Hewards handy haversack, gloves of arrow snaring, Murlynds

spoon, and periapt of proof against poison. Due to the prevalence

of these items in Chondathan lands, they may be purchased at

a  10%  discount  from  the  normal  price  in  any  large  city  in

Cormyr, Sembia, the Dragon Coast, or the Vilhon Reach.

Iconic Magic Item: Again, thanks to the influence of Chon-

dathan merchants, there are few magic items unique to Chon-

dathan  culture  that  have  not  been  widely  disseminated  across

Faern. One exception to this rule is the catseye brooch (see the

appendix), a good luck charm worn by many well-to-do Chon-

dathans, who view cats as good luck and defenders against the

threat of disease.

Chondathan Deities

Chondathans honor the deities of the Faernian pantheon. Such

is the magnitude of the Chondathan diaspora that no deity is

particularly  favored  by  the  majority  of  Chondathans  across

Faern.  In  fact,  Chondathans  have  traditionally  adopted  the

deities of other cultures, incorporating them into their sprawl-

ing pantheon. Gods and goddesses venerated in regions inhabited

primarily  by  Chondathans  include  Azuth,  Chauntea,  Deneir,

Eldath, Helm, Kelemvor, Lathander, Lliira, Loviatar, Malar,

Mask, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Nobanion, Oghma, Selne, Sil-

vanus,  Sune,  Talos,  Tempus,  Torm,  Tymora,  Tyr,  Umberlee,

and Waukeen.

Ancient Jhaamdath was one of the first human cultures to

develop the written word, and, as such, literate Chondathans

have long honored Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs and Images.

The church of Deneir has spread to other cultures as Chon-

dathan  traders  spread  the  trade  tongues  of  Common  or  its

antecedent, Thorass, bringing with them the Thorass alphabet.

At  present,  the  church  of  Deneir  has  its  greatest  influence

among  those  literate  Chondathans  who  dwell  in  Cormyr

and Sembia.

Similarly, ancient Jhaamdaths wars were fought with horri-

ble magical plagues, so Talona has been a part of Chondathan

culture since the rise of that culture. The church of Talona is

widely  feared  and  reviled  among  modern-day  Chondathans,

despite  the  activities  of  other  faiths  that  have  wreaked  far

greater devastation across Faern in recent years. Nevertheless,

a  small  number  of  Chondathans  turn  to  the  Mother  of  All

Plagues precisely because of the fear and misery she has engen-

dered  and  in  hopes  of  acquiring  the  ancient  plague-spawning

magic her cult is said to control.

Relations with Other Races

Chondathan  history  is  replete  with  clashes  with  various  elven

realms, and, as a result, few Chondathans (with the exception of

some Cormyreans and most Dalesmen) have good relations with

the  Fair  Folk  or  their  half-elven  brethren.  Likewise,  Chon-

dathans  have  traditionally  regarded  the  planetouched  with  a

great deal of suspicion, as Chondathan culture has never had a

great deal of interaction with outsiders and most planetouched

they  have  encountered  were  representatives  of  rival  cultures

(such as the air and fire genasi of Calimshan, or the aasimar and

tieflings  of  Mulhorand  and  Unther).  Half-orcs  are  considered

little  better  than  their  full-blooded  brethren  by  most  Chon-

dathans. They are seen as little more than raiding scum intent

only on disrupting the flow of trade and pillaging the farms of

hardworking settlers.

Chondathans have good relations with dwarves, gnomes, and

halflings,  for  all  have  proven  to  be  good  trading  partners  and

have traditionally dwelled in small enclaves within Chondathan

societies.  Among  human  cultures,  Chondathans  get  along  best

with  Calishites,  Damarans,  Shaarans,  Tethyrians,  and  Turami.

Relations with the Mulan have never been warm, Illuskans are

regarded  as  little  better  than  orcs,  and  other  cultures  are

largely unknown.

Chondathan Equipment

Through  centuries  of  commerce,  Chondathan  merchants  have

spread  their  cultures  trade  goods  across  Faern,  making  their

favored  weapons,  forms  of  armor,  and  other  equipment  the

norm throughout the region, not the exception. Similarly, Chon-

dathans have adopted the most useful items of other cultures as

their  own,  making  them  commonplace  across  Faern.  As  such,

the equipment lists found in the Players Handbook can be seen

as reflecting the Chondathan norm.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Chondathans  do  have  some  distinct  equipment  preferences.

Favored  weapons  include  crossbows  (except  in  the  Dalelands

where longbows are the norm) and all manner of blades, includ-

ing the longsword, the short sword, and the dagger. Commonly

employed  forms  of  armor  include  leather  armor,  studded

leather  armor,  chain  shirts,  chainmail,  breastplates,  half-plate,

and shields of all kinds. Heavier forms of armor are more com-

monly employed in the cooler climes to the north of the Sea of

Fallen Stars.

Common  Items:  Chainmail,  chain  shirts,  longswords,  and

crossbows  can  all  be  purchased  among  the  Chondathans  for

10% less.

Unique Item: Somewhat broader in the blade than usual for a

longsword,  Chondathan  steelswords  (see  the  appendix)  are

favored by mercenaries and merchant guards.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Chondathans  favor  small  felines  as  pets  and  hunting  compan-

ions,  particularly  in  the  Forest  Kingdom  of  Cormyr.  Tressyms

are highly favored by those who can afford them, as are lynxes.

Dogs are owned to a lesser extent and consist primarily of guard,

87

HUMANS

herding,  and  hunting  breeds.  Horses  play  an  important  role  in

Chondathan society, but those who can afford them also employ

hippogriffs,  particularly  along  the  shores  of  the  Vilhon  Reach

and in the service of the War Wizards of Cormyr.

Associated Creature: In Hlondeth, serpents are the norm, with

flying snakes imported from the Mhair Jungles achieving wide-

spread popularity in recent years. Flying snakes are described in

the Monsters section of the appendix.

Chondathan Region

Chondathans hail from a variety of different lands and typically

choose  the  region  matching  their  homeland.  The  Chondathan

region  described  here  reflects  the  mobile  population  of  mer-

chants,  mercenaries,  and  sailors  from  the  lands  around  the

Inner Sea.

Preferred Classes: The Chondathan region is preferred by cler-

ics,  druids,  fighters,  rangers,  and  rogues.  A  character  of  one  of

these classes may choose a regional feat and gain her choice of the

bonus  equipment  below  as  a  1st-level  character.  A  Chondathan

character of any other class may not select one of the regional

feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment at 1st level.

Automatic Languages: Chondathan, Common.

Bonus  Languages:  Alzhedo,  Chessentan,  Damaran,  Goblin,

Orc, Shaaran, Turmic.

Regional  Feats:  Caravanner,  Mercantile  Background,  Plague

Resistant.

Bonus  Equipment:  (A)  Heavy  mace*  or  longsword*;  or  (B)

breastplate*; or (C) large steel shield*, aspergillum, and 4 flasks

of holy water.

Human, Damaran

Regions:  Aglarond,  Damara,  Great  Dale,  Impiltur,  Moonsea,

Narfell, Thesk, Vaasa, the Vast, Damaran.

Racial  Feats:  Arctic  Adaptation,  Grim  Visage,  Jotunbrud,

Lightbringer.

In  the  aftermath  of  Narfells  fall,  scattered  groups  of  Nars,

Rashemi, and Sossrims struggled to survive as a wave of Chon-

dathan emigrants settled in the lands of the Easting Reach. In

time, these four populations gradually coalesced into a relatively

new ethnic group known as Damarans, so named for the first

human realm to be founded by this integrated population. After

centuries  spent  battling  the  horrors  unleashed  by  the  ancient

magics  of  Narfell  and  Raumathar,  Damarans  are  proud  and

stubborn folk who refuse to buckle in the face of unspeakable

evils and whose worldview leans toward moral absolutes.

Although Damaran folklore derives from the ancient tradi-

tions of Nar, Rashemi, and Sossrim tribal groups, Damaran cul-

ture  evolved  under  the  civilizing  influences  of  Chondathan

immigrants  and  dwarven  traders,  and  primarily  reflects  the

mores of both these influences. After centuries of ever-expand-

ing settlement, Damarans now make up the primary racial stock

of  Damara,  Impiltur,  Thesk,  and  the  Vast.  Damaran  settlers

have tamed one land after another and form a significant frac-

tion of the human population in Aglarond, Altumbel, the Great

Dale, the Moonsea region, and Narfell. Most Damarans make

their living as farmers, loggers, or miners in a harsh and unfor-

giving land. They make indomitable foes when angered.

Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues

ranging from tawny to fair. Hair is usually straight brown or

black, although sandy blond is not unknown. Eye color varies

widely, with brown being most common. Damarans who dwell

south of the Earthfast mountains more closely resemble their

Chondathan cousins, while those who inhabit Vaasa have a sig-

nificant Sossrim heritage. Along the eastern shores of the East-

ing Reach, Rashemi heritage predominates, except in Aglarond

proper, where builds are slighter thanks to a significant amount

of wood-elven heritage.

Damarans  see  life  as  a  series  of  unending  challenges  to  be

overcome, many of them legacies of the hubris of long-fallen

empires. For a typical Damaran, there can be no compromise

with the forces of evil, even to serve a greater good. Trust must

be earned, and only those deserving of trust are to be respected.

Even those who inherit titles of nobility must prove themselves

worthy of their inheritance. History is not something to be cher-

ished or exalted, but rather it is an object lesson as to the folly

of unchecked power.

History

The vast forested territory between the Easting Reach and Lake

Ashane  are  the  traditional  tribal  lands  of  the  Nars.  First

encountered by Mulhorandi scouts during that empires north-

ward  expansion  nearly  1,500  years  before  the  beginning  of

Dalereckoning, the Nars did not rise to prominence until after

the Orcgate Wars of 1075 DR to 1069 DR. Like other tribal

peoples to the east, the Nars were hired to fight in Mulhorands

northern  armies  during  the  Orcgate  Wars,  and  they  returned

home intent on building an empire of their own. Over the course

of the next two centuries, the Nars established a series of petty

kingdoms, the most prominent of which were Ashanath (along

the western shore of Lake Ashane) and Tharos (at the head of

the Easting Reach).

In 970 DR, the reigning Nentyarch (king) of Tharos con-

structed the great tree-lined fortress of Dun-Tharos in the heart

of the Rawlinswood. Some claim he forged a pact with a power-

ful demon lord, possibly Orcus, in exchange for a fell artifact

that came to be known as the Crown of Narfell, while others

attribute his rise to a combination of fortuitous events and per-

sonal charisma. In any event, after donning the Crown of Nar-

fell, the Nentyarch proceeded to conquer one petty kingdom of

the Nars after another, the last of which was the kingdom of

Ashanath. The Nentyarchs army literally wiped out Ashanaths

capital city of Shandaular, reducing it to little more than myth

and scattered piles of rubble along the western shore of Lake

Ashane.  By  900  DR,  the  empire  of  Narfell  stretched  from

the  uplands  of  Impiltur  to  Ashanath,  and  from  the  eastern

slopes  of  the  Giantspire  Mountains  to  the  northern  bank  of

the River Umber.

In the centuries that followed, Narfells rulers set their sights

on the Priador Plateau (now the Plateau of Thay), home only

to nomadic tribes of centaurs and gnolls following the retreat

of Mulhorand. The centuries-long struggle for control of the

Priador Plateau between Narfell and Raumathar is recounted in

greater detail in the history of the Rashemi (see page 99). In

brief, early successes by Narfell were reversed after 623 DR

because of an ill-conceived invasion of Mulhorand and a sur-

prise  attack  by  Raumathars  army.  In  order  to  reverse  their

empires decline, the rulers of Narfell turned to demonic aid to

learn the art of sorcery, prompted by fell whisperings of the

Crown of Narfell. In 150 DR, centuries of warfare culminated

in a great conflagration that consumed both empires and left

all manner of summoned beings to stalk the lands the empires

once  ruled.  In  the  aftermath  of  Narfells  collapse,  the  Nars

retreated into tiny enclaves, sorely beset by the demons they

had unleashed.

The reestablishment of civilization along the shores of the

Easting Reach had its roots in the destruction of Jhaamdath in

255 DR (further detailed in the history of the Chondathans).

A  vast  tide  of  Chondathan  settlers  sailed  across  the  Sea  of

Fallen  Stars  to  settle  the  lands  that  lay  between  the  Dragon

Reach and the Easting Reach. These early settlers founded such

cities  as  Proeskampalar  (later  Procampur)  in  153  DR,

Lyrabar  in  118  DR,  and  Chessagol

(later  Tsurlagol)  in  72  DR.  From

Lyrabar,  settlers  advanced  up  the

western coast of the Easting Reach

into the uplands of Impiltur. Within

fifty  years  of  the  settlement  of

Lyrabar, the first king of Impiltur had

been  crowned.  Impiltur,  led  by  the  aggres-

sive  and  newly  enthroned  Mirandor

Dynasty, moved quickly to claim the vacant

territory of fallen Narfell.

As  Impilturs  population  continued  to

expand,  scattered  tribes  of  Nars  and  migrant

Sossrims from the southern tip of the Great Glac-

ier were either assimilated into the settler popula-

tion or driven north into the lands they hold today.

With the backing of Impilturs royal family, lesser

nobles not in line to inherit land of their own were

encouraged  to  settle  new  lands.  Successive  waves  of

Impilturan  emigration  led  directly  or  indirectly  to

the  settlement  of  the  Forest  Kingdom  of  Cormyr  in  1  DR,

Altumbel in 163 DR, the city of Milvarune in 535 DR, and

the  Vast  (after  the  fall  of  Rodilar,  the  dwarven  Realm  of

Glimmering Swords) in 649 DR.

Impilturs eastward expansion was not without cost, for the

settlers who blazed a trail through the Great Dale inadvertently

awakened a host of slumbering evils. Long-buried demons, half-

fiends, and tieflings began to stalk the borderlands of Impiltur,

and  in  726  DR  unleashed  their  waiting  armies  in  a  campaign

that  brought  proud  Impiltur  to  its  knees.  Many  citizens  of

Impiltur fled the region, taking with them stories of horror and

terror that moved many to action.

Over the next few years, noble knights from as far away as

Amn and Calimshan heeded the call of the Triad Crusade pro-

claimed by the churches of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater. The Crusade

lasted two years before the last demon army, led by the balor

Ndulu, was overwhelmed in a great battle at a site known as the

Citadel of Conjurers. The battle turned in favor of the Triads

followers after the paladin Sarshel entered the Citadel and shat-

tered the Crown of Narfell within. Once Orcus power over the

artifact was broken, the demon-led army was forced to retreat

and the number of demons in the region finally began to decline.

The heroic Sarshel was crowned king of Impiltur.

In the centuries that followed, Impiltur grew wealthy, ruled

by a series of benevolent kings and protected from the buried

horrors of the Demonlands by orders of fearless paladins. Set-

tlement of the surrounding regions continued, and Impilturan

settlers played a role in the founding of Aglarond in 756 DR

and Telflamm in 926 DR (followed by the other cities of the

Perilous lore

Golden  Way).  Impilturs  golden  age  came  to  an  end  after  a

plague  decimated  the  royal  house  in  924  DR.  The  ensuing

struggle between the various noble houses of Impiltur plunged

the  kingdom  into  civil  war  and  eventually  reduced  the  once-

great land to a handful of squabbling city-states.

The  Year  of  Spreading  Spring  (1038  DR)  brought  great

changes  to  the  Easting  Reach.  The  Great  Glacier  began  to

retreat, uncovering the lands of what is today Vaasa, Damara,

and  northern  Narfell.  The  glaciers  retreat  prompted  a  vast

northward migration from Impiltur, the Great Dale, Thesk, and

Aglarond into the promised land of Damara (Earth Under Ice

in the local dialect). It is from the time of this migration that

scholars began to view the humans of the Easting Reach as a dis-

tinct  ethnic  group.  Damara  became  a  king-

dom in 1075 DR, with the founding

of  Heliogabulus  by  a  Sembian

noble named Feldrin Bloodfeath-

ers.  House  Bloodfeathers  ruled

Damara  until  the  death  of  King

Virdin Bloodfeathers in 1347 DR in

battle with the armies of the Zhengyi, the

Witch-King  of  Vaasa.  The  lichs  grip  on

Vaasa and Damara lasted twelve long years

before  he  was  overthrown  by  a  band  of

adventurers  led  by  the  paladin  Gareth  Drag-

onsbane in 1359 DR. Gareth then assumed the

throne of Damara and set about reuniting and

restoring the kingdom.

The glaciers retreat opened the way for a huge

horde  of  hobgoblins  to  attack  Impiltur  in  1095

DR. Ironically, it was the threat of the hobgoblin

invasion  that  enabled  Imphras,  War  Captain  of

Lyrabar, to unite his forces with the human armies

of  Hlammach,  Dilfur,  and  Sarshel,  wood  elves  of  the  Gray

Forest, and dwarves from the Earthfast Mountains. Once the

horde was dispatched, Imphras was crowned King of Impiltur in

1097 DR, establishing the royal house that still rules today. Ril-

imbrar, the fourth son of Imphras II, died in 1338 DR, and the

throne passed to Queen Sambryl, the widowed wife of Imphras

IV (who never ruled).

Although the first wave of Impilturan settlers reached Agla-

rond in 756 DR, it was not until 870 to 880 DR that a wave of

adventurers cleared the Yuirwood of its most dangerous mon-

sters. In the decades that followed, the Yuir elves intermarried

with  humans  who  came  to  their  aid  in  battles  with  drow  and

trolls. Their descendants began skirmishing with the humans of

the  coastal  kingdom  of  Velprin,  culminating  in  the  Battle  of

Ingdals  Arm  in  1065  DR.  The  victorious  half-elves  crowned

their  war-leader  Brindor  Aglaronds  first  king.  Those  humans

who  refused  to  make  peace  with  the  folk  of  the  Yuirwood

migrated to Altumbel.

Philaspur, grandson of Brindor, died fighting the Thayans in

the Battle of Brokenheads, in 1197 DR. He was succeeded by his

twin daughters Thara and Ulae, more commonly known as the

Gray  Sisters.  The  Gray  Sisters  died  within  a  few  days  of  each

other in 1257 DR and were succeeded by Ulaes son Halacar, the

first  full-blooded  Damaran  to  hold  the  throne  of  Aglarond.

Halacar  mounted  an  invasion  of  Thay  and  paid  for  his  folly

with his life in 1260 DR at the Battle of Lapendrar. Halacars

sister Ilione succeeded him, and ruled until her death in 1320.

As Ilione had no heir, she left the throne of Aglarond to her

apprentice, known only as the Simbul.

HUMANS

Outlook

Damarans respect those who demonstrate heroism and self-sac-

rifice and stand unflinchingly in the face of evil. Damaran soci-

ety  is  intolerant  of  weakness  or  selfishness,  viewing  deeds  in

stark  black  or  white.  The  moralistic  nature  of  their  society

strongly shapes Damaran youth. Most youngsters follow in the

path of their parents, subscribing to their strong moral fervor.

Others rebel against the strictures of Damaran society and flee

its constraints. The latter path accounts for the neverending tide

of settlers emigrating to the borders of human settlement, the

large numbers of Damarans who have made their way west into

Chondathan-held territories, and the small number of Damarans

who turn to the worship of demons.

Damarans have a long adventuring tradition, reflecting the

generations-long  battle  to  reclaim  the  lands  of  the  Easting

Reach from the demonic legacy of Narfell. Many youths, par-

ticularly  those  of  noble  blood,  take  up  adventuring  for  a  few

years in order to prove themselves worthy of their titles. Those

not in line to inherit great estates also do so in hopes of winning

new lands and wealth for themselves, or in response to the cru-

sading zeal of Damaran society. The good-aligned churches of

the Easting Reach have a long tradition of funding expeditions

into the mountains or the depths of the great forests to smite

some ancient evil or another.

DAMARAN CHARACTERS

Damarans  typically  make  strong  paladins  and  monks,  for  the

discipline and self-sacrifice required of both professions resonate

strongly with Damaran morals. Many Damarans find their call-

ing  as  clerics  or,  to  a  lesser  extent,  druids  or  rangers,  for  the

appeal of serving a divine entity is strong. Fighters and rogues

are less common in Damaran culture than elsewhere, for there is

neither  a  strong  mercenary  tradition  nor  a  strong  mercantile

presence  along  the  Easting  Reach.  Notable  exceptions  do  exist,

including  the  city  of  Teflamm,  where  a  strong  thieves  guild

holds sway, and the Galena Mountains, where a secretive broth-

erhood of assassins is said to have a hidden stronghold. Arcane

spellcasters of all sorts are rare in Damaran society, reflecting a

long-held suspicion of magic powers that are not bestowed by a

deity. While wizards are generally accepted, sorcerers are looked

on  with  suspicion,  for  the  sorcerous  arts  are  thought  to  be  a

legacy of demonic heritage.

Prestige Classes: Like the Chondathans, Damarans are drawn

to  prestige  classes  with  divine  associations,  such  as  the  divine

champion, divine disciple, divine seeker, or hierophant. The Shad-

owmasters  of  Telflamm  naturally  include  a  number  of  rogues

who take up the assassin and shadowdancer prestige classes.

Damaran Society

Damaran  society  is  lawful,  except  in  Aglarond,  where  a  strong

elven influence plays a role, and the Vast, which is much more

in line with Chondathan mores. Religion plays a central role in

Damaran life, yet there is by no means a universality of belief.

Although  religious  fervor  is  admired,  individuals  are  judged  by

how they conduct themselves and the strength of their personal

moral code. Class divisions are less noticeable than elsewhere in

Faern,  but  those  who  have  been  judged  morally  unfit  are

strongly shunned by their peers.

Damaran  city-dwellers  are  usually  educated  in  church-run

schools, while itinerant priests minister to those who dwell in

wilderness regions. Many Damarans learn their trade during an

apprenticeship  at  a  church-run  school  before  setting  out  into

life, while others join a religious order, directly pledging them-

selves to the service of the church. As they grow old, Damarans

often return to the church of their youth, tithing much of their

wealth to its coffers and living out their last years in service to

their patron deity.

Damarans  retain  strong  cultural  ties  to  their  Chondathan

forebears and easily integrate themselves into Chondathan-held

lands.  There  has  been  little  Damaran  migration  elsewhere  in

Faern, but those Damarans who do stray far from their home-

land associate themselves with a local church of their faith.

Language and Literacy

Most  Damarans  speak  Common  and  Damaran,  two  closely

related tongues. Damaran employs an alphabet of Dethek runes,

a legacy of early cooperation between the inhabitants of Impil-

tur and the dwarves of the Earthfast Mountains. The exceptions

are  the  inhabitants  of  Aglarond  and  Altumbel,  who  speak

Common and Aglarondan, a tongue closely related to Damaran

that incorporates many Elven words and uses the elven script

of Espruar.

Common  second  languages  in  Impiltur  include  Chondathan,

Dwarven,  Aglarondan,  or  Chessentan.  In  Damara  and  Vaasa,

second languages frequently known include Chondathan, Dwar-

ven, Orcish, or Uluik. Many Nars can speak Rashemi or Uluik,

and Tuigan is becoming increasingly popular. The inhabitants of

the Great Dale are most likely to learn Rashemi, although some

learn  the  Thayan  dialect  of  Mulhorandi.  In  southern  Thesk,

Aglarondan is the most popular second language, while Chonda-

than  and  Turmic  are  the  preferred  second  tongues  along  the

coast  around  Telflamm.  In  Aglarond,  most  inhabitants  also

speak Elven. Other common second languages include Damaran,

Chessentan, Sylvan, or Mulhorandi.

All  Damaran  characters  are  literate  except  for  barbarians,

commoners, and warriors.

Damaran Magic and Lore

Damarans favor magic that discerns between friend and foe, and

spells that protect the good from the evil. In the north, magic

that affects the weather takes increased prominence, as do fire

effects that are especially damaging to the cold-adapted monsters

that haunt the wilderness.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Damarans  have  a  strong  divine  spellcasting  tradition,  particu-

larly in the clerical vein. Because of their suspicion of the arcane

arts, Damarans have few arcane spellcasters, the rare exceptions

stemming from the buried legacies of fallen Narfell. Damaran

bloodlines that give rise to powerful sorcerers tend to be demonic

in nature and are often accompanied by a trace of tiefling ances-

try. Damaran wizards are usually abjurers or diviners, with the

study of necromancy or conjuration strongly reviled.

Spellcasting Tradition: Damarans favor spells that ward off

the forces of evil or drive them from this plane, although spells

that  assist  survival  in  a  harsh  climate  are  common  as  well.

90

HUMANS

Commonly favored spells include banishment, dismissal, magic

circle  against  evil,  protection  from  elements,  protection  from

evil, and resist elements. Spells that call extraplanar creatures,

such as planar ally and planar binding, are met with suspicion

even when theyre used to call obviously good creatures. Good-

aligned Damaran clerics often take the Lightbringer feat (see

the appendix)

Unique Spells: The widespread suspicion of arcane spellcasting

in Damaran culture has ensured that few arcane spells of Dama-

ran  origin  have  become  commonly  known.  In  contrast,  the

common cause mentality of religious institutions in Damaran

culture  has  ensured  that  divine  spells  of  Damaran  origin  have

quickly become widely known. A few paladin spells are uniquely

Damaran, including lawful sword (see the appendix).

DAMARAN MAGIC ITEMS

Damarans favor magic items that provide protection against the

harsh natural environment or the unholy horrors of the Demon-

lands.  Swords  and  daggers  are  commonly  crafted  with  outsider

bane, defending, holy, or lawful special abilities. Maces are com-

monly  crafted  with  disruption,  holy,  or  lawful  special  abilities.

Armor  is  typically  crafted  with  cold  resistance,  ghost  touch,

invulnerability, and warming special abilities.

Common  Magic  Items:  Boots  of  the  winterlands,  candle  of

invocation, horn of goodness, phylactery of faithfulness, quiver

of Mielikki (Ehlonna), and ring of warmth. Due to the preva-

lence of these items in Damaran lands, they may be purchased

at a 10% discount from the normal price in any large city in

Impiltur or Damara.

Iconic  Magic  Item:  Fiendhunter  two-bladed  swords (see  the

appendix),  though  rare,  are  identified  strongly  with  Damaran

heroes who ride from place to place, battling demons and devils

wherever they may be found.

Damaran Deities

Damarans honor the deities of the Faernian pantheon. They

favor lawful and good deities, except for cultists who turn to the

worship of chaotic evil demon princes. Along the Dragon Reach,

commonly venerated deities include Chauntea, Eldath, Mystra,

Tempus, Torm, Tymora, Umberlee, and Waukeen. To the east in

Impiltur,  favored  deities  include  Ilmater,  Selne,  Tymora,

Valkur, and Waukeen. In addition to the church of Chauntea,

Thesks reliance on trade along the Golden Way has brought the

churches of Shaundakul and Waukeen to prominence. Likewise,

the church of Mask has grown strong in Teflamm preying on

that same caravan traffic.

In Aglarond, Chauntea is venerated by farmers, while fisher-

folk  venerate  Valkur  and  Selne.  Although  Umberlee  is

acknowledged, she is widely held in great disdain. Aglarondans

also pay homage to the Seldarine, particularly in their guise as

the gods of the Yuirwood elves. The Great Dale has long been

home to followers of Silvanus the Oakfather, locked in bitter

conflict  with  the  disciples  of  Talona.  The  church  of  Ilmater

dominates Damara, while Vaasa has long been home to the cult

of Orcus. Tempus is venerated by barbarians dwelling along the

edge of the Great Glacier and among the tribes of Narfell.

Of all the deities, Ilmater represents the enduring spirit of all

Damarans  and  occupies  a  central  place  in  Damaran  culture.

Ilmaters church is effectively the state church of both Impiltur

and Damara, with paladins of Ilmater proving to be regular occu-

pants of both thrones. Most Damarans along the Easting Reach

pay at least token obeisance to the Crying God or one of his many

saints on a daily basis. Most churches of Ilmater are dedicated to

at least one of his saints, with the followers of Saint Sollars the

Twice-Martyred being most prominent in Damara.

Relations with Other Races

Damarans have long and abiding ties with shield dwarves and

are favorably inclined toward the Stout Folk (with the notable

exception of the duergar). Halflings are rare in Damaran lands

outside Impiltur, but are viewed quite favorably by most Dama-

ran  communities.  Gnomes  are  regarded  similarly  to  dwarves,

although they are less well known in Damaran lands. Elves and

half-elves are almost unknown outside Aglarond and the Gray

Forest, and are regarded with some amount of suspicion. Dark

elves  are  not  unknown  in  the  Galena  Mountains,  and  have

earned the enmity of those native to the region. Half-orcs are

regarded with a great deal of suspicion, although their numbers

make them a tolerated minority in Vaasa.

Damarans  have  long  struggled  with  the  evils  unleashed  by

Narfells sorcerers, leaving them quite hostile to the progeny of

demons such as tieflings. Fire genasi have long been associated

with  the  Red  Wizards  of  Thay  and  are  thus  equally  disliked.

Other  planetouched  are  rare  in  Damaran  lands,  and  hence

viewed as objects of wonder.

Among human cultures, Damarans get along best with Chon-

dathans and Turami thanks to extensive trading contacts. Nars

and  northern  Rashemi  are  tolerated,  if  looked  down  upon  to

some extent, while Mulan and Thayan Rashemi are viewed with

a great deal of suspicion. Lingering memories of the Horde pre-

vent  the  establishment  of  good  relations  with  the  Tuigans.

Finally, due to the notorious Bloodstone Wars of a few decades

back, most Vaasans are regarded as demon-worshiping reavers,

even  those  who  happen  to  be  of  Damaran  racial  stock  rather

than Vaasans.

Damaran Equipment

Thanks to extensive trade across the Sea of Fallen Stars, Dama-

rans share much in common with Chondathans, including com-

monly  employed  forms  of  weapons  and  armor.  As  such,  the

equipment  lists  found  in  the  Players  Handbook can  be  seen  as

reflecting the Damaran norm.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Damarans favor medium armors that combine good protec-

tion with a reasonably low weight, and weapons that can fend

off feral beasts or bloodthirsty demons armed with tooth and

claw. Favored weapons include spears, longspears, glaives, hal-

berds, and greatswords. Commonly employed forms of armor

include  studded  leather  armor,  chainmail,  breastplates,  and

splinted mail.

Common Items: Chainmail, splinted mail, longspear, halberd,

greatsword.

Unique Items: Perhaps the most unique weapon in Faern

is the heavy aspergillum, found only among the Ilmaterans

of Impiltur. See the Equipment section of the appendix for

its description.

91

HUMANS

ANIMALS AND PETS

Damarans favor large canines as pets, particularly in mountain-

ous  and  arctic  regions.  Most  breeds  are  working  dogs,  bred  to

serve as pack animals or sled dogs. Since the retreat of the Great

Glacier, Damaran working dogs have been bred to serve a variety

of other uses, including herding and hunting. Most retain a dis-

tinctive thick coat. Horses also play an important role in Dama-

ran  society.  More  exotic  mounts  include  griffons,  employed  in

Damara and Vaasa.

Damaran Region

While  the  folk  of  Impiltur  are  comfortably  mercantile  and

sophisticated, from Vaasa to Thesk the typical Damaran lives in

a frontier town guarded by a lords keep or fortified abbey, sur-

rounded by vast tracts of dangerous wilderness.

Preferred Classes: The Damaran region is preferred by clerics,

druids, monks, paladins, and wizards. A character of one of these

classes  may  choose  a  regional  feat  and  gain  his  choice  of  the

bonus  equipment  below  as  a  1st-level  character.  A  Damaran

character of any other class may not select one of the regional

feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment at 1st level.

Automatic Languages: Damaran, Common.

Bonus  Languages:  Abyssal,  Chondathan,  Dwarven,  Giant,

Goblin, Orc, Rashemi.

Regional  Feats:  Forester,  Lightbringer,  Luck  of  Heroes,

Strong Soul.

Bonus  Equipment:  (A)  Heavy  mace*  or  longsword*;  or  (B)

breastplate*;  or  (C)  large  steel  shield*,  aspergillum,  and  four

flasks of holy water.

Oral History.

Illuskans, also known as Northlanders, are the seagoing, warlike

people  of  the  Sword  Coast  North,  the  Trackless  Sea,  and  the

Dessarin river valley. Although their ancestors founded Illusk,

one of the earliest human civilizations in Faern, as well as the

great city of Waterdeep, Illuskans have long been seen as a bar-

baric people, having barely risen above the status of orcs in the

eyes of many southerners. Illuskans are more than just barbar-

ians, however, as their culture has given rise to powerful rune-

casters,  fearless  sailors,  and  legendary  skalds.  They  also  farm,

fish,  and  mine  their  rugged  lands,  trading  their  goods  with

southern merchants. However, long-fallen elven empires, barri-

ers of geography, and a cultural emphasis on raiding over trade

have  conspired  to  ensure  that  Illuskan  culture  and  bloodlines

have not taken root in other lands.

Illuskans  are  tall,  fair-skinned  folk  with  eyes  of  blue  or

steely gray. Those who dwell among the islands of the Track-

less Sea and in Icewind Dale are largely fair-haired, with blond

hair predominating over red and light brown. Those who dwell

on  the  mainland  south  of  the  Spine  of  the  World  are  more

prone  to  raven-black  hair,  an  indication  of  significant

Netherese heritage.

Illuskans regard themselves as a strong, proud people forged

by  the  harsh  environment  in  which  they  dwell.  They  feel  they

have earned, through strength in battle, the right to claim the

lands  they  have  settled.  Illuskans  regard  most  southerners  as

weak and decadent, two much-despised traits. However, they are

fair-minded and always willing to make exceptions for those who

have  proven  otherwise.  Illuskans  themselves  are  bold  and

impetuous, given to proud boasts, the consumption of prodigious

amounts of mead and ale, and quick tempers.

History

Although it is unclear when humans first settled the islands of

the Trackless Sea, the first Northlander migration to the north-

ern Sword Coast occurred before 3000 DR and led to the ini-

tial founding of the realm of Illusk by hunting clans and fishing

villages along the coast. The capital of Old Illusk is believed to

have been a city of the same name located at the mouth of the

River Mirar, where Luskan, City of Sails, stands today. At the

peak of its influence, Old Illusk held the Sword Coast from the

Sword Mountains to the Spine of the World, cut off from the

rest of Faern by the elf-held woodlands of Illefarn. The early

Illuskans learned rune magic from the giants of Ostoria during

this era. The first incarnation of Illusk fell in 2103 DR, when

a horde of orcs, led by giants and their ogre generals, crushed the

realm.  The  few  survivors  of  Old  Illusk  reverted  to  barbarism

and migrated north and west to what is now Icewind Dale, where

their descendants are known as the Reghedmen.

In the century leading up to the beginning of Dalereckoning,

the  ancient  Illuskan  kingdom  of  Ruathym  was  wracked  by

intertribal strife stemming from a population that had grown

too large for the islands limited resources. Illuskan dragonships

set  sail  for  the  other  islands  of  the  Trackless  Sea,  including

Mintarn,  the  northern  Moonshae  Isles,  and  the  Whalebones,

where various Illuskan tribes established new colonies. The Illus-

kan emigrants settled the mainland of Faern as well. Another

tribe vanished through a portal that led to the Council Hills

of the Eastern Shaar and populated the land of Dambrath in

the South.

In  95  DR,  a  Ruathym  thane  by  the  name  of  Uthgar  Gar-

dolfsson sailed east in hopes of finding the ruins of Old Illusk

hinted at in the skalds songs. Instead, Uthgar discovered that

Netherese survivors had built a new city on the site. Uthgars

armies sacked Netherese Illusk and overthrew the ruling magoc-

racy, but the inhabitants of the city fought back by burning the

Illuskan dragonships and driving Uthgars army inland. Uthgar

and his men survived, joining with the barbaric Netherese tribes

of the interior. Uthgar died in 123 DR in battle with Gurt, Lord

of the Pale Giants, on the site now known as Morgurs Mound.

By defeating the giant king, Uthgar broke the power of the frost

giants and before his death claimed the lands between the Spine

of the World and the Evermoors for his followers. By his deeds,

Uthgar won the favor of the god Tempus, who elevated him to

the rank of demigod. The descendants of the Son of Tempus

are known as the Uthgardt barbarians.

The Illuskans of the Sword Coast prospered and began expand-

ing their holdings. Some migrated up the Delimbiyr Vale, set-

tling  the  Barony  of  Steeping  Falls  (where  the  town  of

Daggerford  now  lies)  in  133  DR  and  Athalantar  (which  lay

between the High Forest and the River Delimbiyr) in 183 DR.

Others migrated up the coast to settle the plateau above Deep-

water Harbor (which later grew into the city of Waterdeep) in

92

HUMANS

52 DR, the city of Eiggerstor (now Neverwinter) in 87 DR, and

Uthtower and Yarlith in what is now the Mere of Dead Men in

146 DR.

Athalantar fell to an orc horde from the High Moor in 342

DR,  and  its  inhabitants  eventually  joined  with  the  Blue  Bear

Uthgardt tribe. (The Blue Bear tribe is now extinct, although its

bloodline continues in the Tree Ghost tribe that broke off from

the corrupt Blue Bears in 1313 DR.) The vale of the Delimbiyr

was  abandoned  in  302  DR,  when  its  chief  city  sank  into  the

Lizard Marsh. Although Delimbiyran would be reborn as part

of Phalorm, the Realm of Three Crowns, in 523 DR, Tethyrian

and  halfling  migrants  from  the  south  quickly  subsumed  what

remained of the Illuskan populace.

ern  Sword  Coast  collapsed  quite  suddenly.

Netherese Illusk fell once again in 611 DR, as

did  Yarlith,  to  the  illithid-led  Everhorde  of

orcs. In 615 DR, battles between the Horde

of the Wastes and the armies of Phalorm

led to the inundation of Uthtower by the

sea,  forming  the  Mere  of  Dead  Men.

Phalorm collapsed later that year, in the

wake of its armys defeat. The founding of

Mirabar  by  Prince  Ereskas  of  Amn  and

his largely Tethyrian followers in 626 DR

marked  the  nadir  of  Illuskan  influence.

Moreover, it served to further segregate the

Uthgardt  tribes  from  their  Northlander

cousins along the coast.

An  Illuskan  renaissance  began  in  806

Lords Alliance reflects the common purpose of Illuskans and

Tethyrians alike to oppose the endless wave of orc hordes that

threaten civilization in the North.

Outlook

Illuskans  take  their  measure  of  another  person  by  assessing

strength, martial prowess, valor, and honor. From an early age,

Illuskans are tested by their elders, their peers, and their jun-

iors, and their response to such challenges are reflected in their

status within the society. To an Illuskan, there is a natural peck-

ing  order  in  life,  and  those  who  are  weak  in  any

fashion do not deserve to hold a position they

have not earned. Deceptions, lies of omis-

sion,  and  trickery  are  despised,  while

straight  speech  and  forthrightness

are to be admired.

Illuskans are typically drawn to

adventuring  for  one  of  two  rea-

sons. Some Northlanders hope to

prove  their  strength,  valor,  and

martial  prowess,  earning  them

respect in their eyes of their kin

and inspiring bards tales for gen-

erations to come. Others seek con-

quest and plunder, hoping to make

up  for  the  meager  fare  and  wealth

their homeland provides.

DR,  with  the  establishment  of  the

coastal  realm  of  Stornanter  by

Laeral  Silverhand,  Witch-Queen  of

the North, with Port Llast as its cap-

ital.  Laeral  realized  the  importance

of  refounding  Illusk  and  initiated  a

campaign  to  do  so  that  led  to  the

reestablishment  of  the  city  in  812  DR.

Although the Realm of the Witch-Queen collapsed

in  841  DR  with  Laerals  abrupt  disappearance,  the

city of Illusk and Stornanters former territories con-

tinued  to  prosper.  Once  again  Illuskan  dragonships  ruled  the

waves, and Illuskan tribes seized control of the Dessarin river

valley from the less warlike Tethyrian settlers of the region. In

882 DR, an Illuskan named Nimoar the Reaver vanquished the

Bloodhand  tribes  dwelling  on  the  plateau  above  Deepwater

Harbor and established Nimoars Hold.

In the centuries that followed, Nimoars Hold grew in power

and influence, with the name Waterdeep coming into common

usage around 940 DR. Eiggerstor became known as Neverwin-

ter, the Chondathan translation of its Illuskan name. Although

Illusk fell to another orc horde in 1244 DR, it was rebuilt as the

city of Luskan in 1302 DR and is now greatly feared for the

presence of the Arcane Brotherhood.

Today, Illuskans dominate the northern islands of the Track-

less Sea and the coast north of the Mere of Dead Men, as well

as  the  Dessarin  river  valley  and  its  tributaries.  The  Arcane

Brotherhood  represents  the  continued  influence  of  the

Netherese  arcane  tradition  over  Illuskan  culture.  An  increas-

ingly large fraction of Mirabars population is of Illuskan her-

itage.  Waterdeep  and  Neverwinter  reflect  the  best  of  both

Illuskan  and  Tethyrian  culture,  and  the  establishment  of  the

Dragonhead boat

ILLUSKAN CHARACTERS

The  Uthgardt  and  the  Illuskans  of  the  sea

isles are renowned barbarians, and many find

their  calling  as  fighters  or  rangers  as  well.

Bards,  known  as  skalds,  play  important  roles

as lorekeepers and poets, giving inspiration to

Illuskan  warbands.  Clerics  and  adepts  play  an

important  role  in  tribal  life.  Although  Illuskans  have

little  tolerance  for  thievery,  many  Illuskan  sailors  and

pirates are actually rogues with a maritime orientation to

their skills. Druids, paladins, and monks are almost unknown in

Illuskan  culture.  Wizards  and  sorcerers  are  rare  but  not

unknown, particularly within the ranks of the Arcane Brother-

hood that rules the City of Sails.

Prestige  Classes: Illuskan  clerics  often  study  rune  magic  and

become  powerful  runecasters.  Evil  Illuskan  reavers  are  some-

times drawn to the way of the blackguard, but good Illuskans of

the  settled  North  have  a  strong  tradition  of  supporting  the

Harpers and often take up the Harper scout prestige class.

Illuskan Society

Illuskans have little concept of class divisions, considering such

artifices as an example of the weakness inherent in southern cul-

tures. Honor and prestige in Illuskan society are earned through

displays of strength and martial fortitude. Both magic and com-

merce are regarded with suspicion, for both are seen as upsetting

the natural order of things.

Illuskans are expected to be self-sufficient from a young age.

Those who must rely on others are treated well but not respected,

although the elderly are accorded the respect they earned before

93

HUMANS

the debilitating effects of age set in. Those who hire strangers to

do  a  task  rather  than  do  it  themselves  are  considered  suspect.

Book learning is admired but not expected. Those who die an hon-

orable  death  are  burned  in  funeral  pyres,  preferably  aboard  a

small ship pushed out to sea. Such ceremonies are believed to free

the soul from its mortal tether.

Illuskans often have difficulty adapting to other cultures, par-

ticularly  societies  where  battles  are  fought  indirectly  through

words and gestures rather than openly with axes and war cries.

Most  expatriate  Illuskans  eschew  the  worship  of  weak  local

gods, and few can be bothered to learn local languages. Instead

they  find  odd  jobs,  usually  as  mercenaries  of  some  sort  or  the

other, and then join their fellow expatriates in nightly drinking

bouts in which prodigious amounts of alcohol are consumed.

Language and Literacy

Most Illuskans speak Illuskan, a language derived largely from

Old  Illuskan  (spoken  by  the  folk  of  Old  Illusk)  mixed  with  a

smattering  of  Netherese.  They  usually  speak  Common  as  well,

but few are literate. Along the northern coast of the mainland,

particularly  in  the  city  of  Waterdeep,  many  Illuskans  speak

Chondathan,  the  language  of  their  Tethyrian  neighbors.

Although  Old  Illuskan  had  an  alphabet  of  its  own,  today  it  is

only  found  in  the  ancient  tomes  of  the  Green  Library  in

Ruathym  and  in  ancient  fragments  of  lore  stored  within  the

Host  Tower  of  the  Arcane  in  Luskan.  Although  rarely  put  in

written  form,  the  modern  Illuskan  tongue  uses  the  Thorass

alphabet introduced by Tethyrian migrants.

All Illuskan characters are literate except for barbarians, aris-

tocrats, commoners, experts, and warriors.

Illuskan Magic and Lore

Wizards are rare in Illuskan society. They are widely feared and

assumed to be in some way affiliated with the Arcane Brother-

hood. Of those who do study wizardry, perhaps the most common

specialization is the school of Evocation. Sorcerers and bards are

more common among Illuskans, as many Illuskans have a trace

of draconic ancestry in their heritage. Unlike other arcane spell-

casters, bards (generally known as skalds) are widely respected

for their role as lorekeepers and poets. Among divine spellcast-

ers, clerics and adepts are most common, with many adopting the

runecaster prestige class (described in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign  Setting).  Druids  and  rangers  are  rare,  and  paladins

almost unknown.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Illuskans  favor  spells  that  enhance  their  martial  prowess,  give

rise to great emotions, or summon the fury of nature, including

bulls strength, call lightning, control winds, emotion, endurance,

and storm of vengeance.

Spellcasting Tradition: Much of the Illuskan divine spellcast-

ing  tradition  was  adopted  in  the  form  of  rune  magic  from

dwarves and giants. Many of the powerful spellcasters among the

Illuskans are runecasters. Some take the Eldritch Linguist feat

(see the appendix), which focuses on the power of the written and

spoken word.

Unique Spells: Illuskans are not known for the creation of new

spells.  Much  of  the  Illuskan  arcane  spellcasting  tradition  was

introduced  by  Netherese  survivors  who  lived  long  ago.  As  a

result,  most  Illuskan  spellcasters  employ  spells  widely  known

throughout the region and do not create their own.

ILLUSKAN MAGIC ITEMS

Illuskans  favor  magic  items  that  provide  morale  bonuses  in

combat and that aid sailors and their ships. Weapons are com-

monly  crafted  with  chaotic,  frost,  icy  burst,  keen,  speed,  and

thundering  special  abilities.  Armor  is  commonly  crafted  with

arrow  deflection,  bashing,  fortification,  and  warming  special

abilities.

Common Magic Items: Illuskan runecasters produce a large

number of such items as boots of the winterlands, gauntlets of

ogre power, horns of fog, horns of Valhalla, potions of heroism,

and wind fans. These items may be purchased at a 10% discount

from the normal price in Luskan, Neverwinter, or on the isle of

Ruathym.

Iconic Magic Items: The lack of a strong arcane spellcasting

tradition  (aside  from  that  passed  down  from  Netherese  fore-

bears in the vicinity of Luskan) has ensured that most magic

items wielded by Illuskans were seized from other cultures and

not crafted from scratch. Nevertheless, there are a few items

unique to Illuskan culture, including the axe of the sea reavers

(see the appendix).

Illuskan Deities

Although the inhabitants of Old Illusk venerated a pantheon of

beast totems and passed this tradition down to the Uthgardt, at

present most Illuskans worship the deities of the Faernian pan-

theon. Illuskans largely adopted the gods of the Netherese pan-

theon in the mixing of cultures that occurred following Uthgars

sack of Illusk, and then adopted the rest of the Faernian pan-

theon as it grew beyond the ranks of the Netherese deities. The

eight  most  prominent  faiths  in  Illuskan  society  include  the

churches  of  Auril,  Mielikki,  Mystra,  Oghma,  Talos,  Tempus,

Umberlee, and Uthgar. Other churches with significant follow-

ings,  particularly  in  areas  where  Illuskans  and  Tethyrians  live

alongside  one  another,  include  Eldath,  Lurue,  Malar,  Milil,

Selne, Shar, Shaundakul, and Valkur.

Auril, the Frostmaiden, has long demanded and received ven-

eration in the cold climes in which most Illuskans dwell. She is

seen as the bringer of winter on the world, to be appeased with

offerings of food and strong drink placed upon rafts set adrift

at  sea  during  autumn  and  winter.  The  church  of  Auril  is

strongest among those Illuskans who dwell in the Frozenfar (the

region of the Sword Coast north of the River Mirar), but a large

temple to the Frostmaiden known as the Winter Palace stands

in Luskan.

Patron of the Uthgardt tribes, Uthgar is worshiped through

the veneration of a beast totem unique to each of the various

tribes.  Even  non-Uthgardt  Illuskans  find  the  worship  of  the

Tempus-son attractive, as the heroic virtues of Uthgars battle-

won kingdom are still celebrated in the long sagas of the Illus-

kan people.

Relations with Other Races

Illuskans judge members of other races and ethnic groups by the

same standards by which they judge themselves. In other words,

94

HUMANS

they respect strength, martial prowess, and the strength of ones

word. Illuskans get along well with dwarves, although the two

groups  have  been  known  to  war  over  disputed  territory.

Gnomes  and  halflings  are  seen  as  weak  and  given  to  trickery,

inspiring scorn in most Illuskans. Similarly, elves and half-elves

are seen as weak and overly reliant on magic, although danger-

ous nonetheless.

Illuskans of the mainland harbor a deep and abiding hatred

for orcs, and few are willing to view half-orcs as any better than

their porcine kin. Illuskans have nothing but scorn for humans

from the South, particularly Calishites. Tethyrians, particularly

those born in the North, are regarded with cautious respect, for

the  two  groups  have  lived  alongside  one  another  and  fought

with each other for generations. Chondathans are viewed simi-

larly to Tethyrians in the Silver Marches region, although their

southern ties are considered more suspect. Planetouched are

regarded with suspicion for, like elves, they seem to be creatures

of magic. In particular, tieflings are seen as little better than

fiends,  though  earth  genasi  are  respected  for  their  strength.

Other  humans  are  regarded  with  suspicion,  for  few  Illuskans

have ventured beyond the cold climes of northwestern Faern

except to raid and plunder, and fewer still have any knowledge

of other cultures.

Illuskan Equipment

Illuskans  favor  heavy  hides  and  warm  wool  cloaks  appropriate

for cold climes. Metal armor is rare, as few Illuskans can afford

to make or purchase it, and because heavy armor is ill-suited for

battles at sea.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Hide  armor  is  common,  as  are  spiked  shields  (large  or  small,

wooden  or  steel).  Most  chieftains  and  well-off  warriors  prefer

chain shirts for personal protection during a raid. The Illuskans

favor axes of all sorts, a legacy of their long-standing association

with the dwarves of the North, who often armed Illuskan heroes.

Common Items: Hide armor, chain shirt, large wooden shield,

battleaxe, greataxe, handaxe, and throwing axe.

Unique Item: The horned helmet is a symbol of the Illuskan

sea-reaver. See the appendix for details.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Illuskans are not inclined to keep animals as pets, companions, or

familiars,  as  relatively  few  species  are  native  to  Ruathym  or

nearby islands. Goats, sheep, and geese do better in the cold Illus-

kan lands than do cattle, swine, or chickens. Illuskan lords of the

northern Moonshaes have adopted Moray moorhounds (see large

hound, in the appendix), originally bred by the Ffolk, in increas-

ing  numbers  of  late.  The  Illuskans  are  not  riders  and  rarely

employ horses, although ponies are sometimes seen on the islands

of the Trackless Sea.

Illuskan Region

Settled  Illuskans  from  the  Sword  Coast  are  reflected  by  The

North  character  region.  This  region  reflects  the  sea-reavers

native to the isles of the Trackless Sea.

Preferred Classes: The Illuskan region is preferred by barbar-

ians,  bards,  clerics,  and  fighters.  A  character  of  one  of  these

classes  may  choose  a  regional  feat  and  gain  her  choice  of  the

bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character. An Illuskan char-

acter of any other class may not select one of the regional feats

here and does not gain the bonus equipment at 1st level.

Automatic Languages: Common, Illuskan.

Bonus Languages: Alzhedo, Aquan, Chondathan, Dwarf, Giant.

Regional Feats: Blooded, Survivor, Thug.

Bonus Equipment: (A) Battleaxe or greataxe*; or (B) chain

shirt*;  or  (C)  large  steel  shield*  and  large  hound  (see  the

appendix).

Uthgardt Region

The  Uthgardt  are  more  nomadic  and  insular  than  the  North-

landers of the coast or the sea isles.

Preferred Classes: The Uthgardt region is preferred by barbar-

ians, druids, fighters, rangers, and rogues. A character of one of

these classes may choose a regional feat and gain her choice of

the bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character. An Uthgardt

character of any other class may not select one of the regional

feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment at 1st level.

large wooden shield*; or (C) 50 arrows*.

Human, Mulan

Regions: Chessenta, Chondalwood, Mulhorand, Thay, Unther.

Racial Feats: Sacred Tattoo, Theocrat.

Since the fall of ancient Imaskar, the Mulan have dominated the

eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Led by two pantheons

of deities, the ancient Mulan empires of Mulhorand and Unther

conquered  at  various  times  Ashanath,  Chessenta,  the  Eastern

Shaar,  Murghm,  Rashemen,  Semphar,  Thay,  Thesk,  and  the

Wizards  Reach  cities  that  lie  south  of  the  Yuirwood.  In  their

wake,  these  empires  have  left  ruling  elites  composed  almost

exclusively  of  Mulan.  After  millennia  of  rulership,  the  Mulan

have  become  arrogant,  highly  resistant  to  change,  and  wholly

convinced of their cultural superiority.

The Mulan are firmly wedded to the use of magic, with the

only  major  point  of  disagreement  being  whether  to  pursue  the

arcane or divine tradition. For many generations the god-kings,

powerful  avatars  of  the  Mulhorandi  and  Untheric  deities  long

resident on Toril, ruled both empires as incarnate gods. The som-

nolent  rule  of  the  god-kings  permitted  the  development  of  a

powerful priest class in Mulan cultures that has long struggled

with practitioners of arcane spellcasting for power. Their heavy-

handed clerical rule prompted repeated rebellions by wizards and

sorcerers, leading to the dominance of Thay by Red Wizards of

Mulan descent.

Mulan are generally tall, slim, and sallow-skinned with eyes

of hazel or brown. They lack much body hair, and many, includ-

ing all nobles, shave any hair that they do have. Hair color on

an unshaved Mulan ranges from black to dark brown. The lower

95

HUMANS

classes of Thay, Mulhorand, and Unther often have significant

Rashemi or Turami blood, leading to darker complexions. The

folk  of  Chessenta  have  long  mixed  with  the  nearby  Chon-

dathans, and pure Mulan features are rare there.

The Mulan have a long and proud history, viewing both their

society  and  their  culture  as  eternal.  Rapid  change  is  regarded

with  suspicion,  and  the  arcane  arts  either  warmly  embraced

(Thay) or viewed with deep distrust (Mulhorand and Unther).

Mulan believe themselves to be more civilized, more prosperous,

more creative, more powerful (should they choose to be), and in

all other ways superior to all other ethnic groups. Even in the

face of evidence to the contrary, Mulan are dismissive of other

cultures accomplishments and openly arrogant with respect to

their own.

The history of the Mulan is largely the history of Mulhorand,

Unther,  Chessenta,  and  Thay,  as  detailed  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Outlook

The  Mulan  believe  in  order  and  discipline  and  are  strongly

resistant to change, the legacy of millennia of undying rule by

the god-kings of Unther and Mulhorand. They haughtily believe

that  they  are  either  the  chosen  of  the  gods  (in  Mulhorand,

Unther, and Chessenta) or above the gods (in Thay) and hold

their  culture  above  all  others.  Unlike  most  other  human  cul-

tures, the Mulan believe they dwell in an earthly paradise, where

stability and security shall reign for all eternity. The afterlife is

merely a mirror of the mortal realm. In Thay, such beliefs have

been twisted to regard undeath as the mirror of life, while in

Unther the centuries-long tyranny of Gilgeam made a horror of

both this world and the next. Mulan are indoctrinated from a

young age to revere their cultural traditions, to respect the law,

and to honor the servants of the gods (or the Red Wizards, in

the case of Thay).

Although not drawn to adventuring, Mulan seen outside their

traditional  homelands  are  usually  adventurers  of  one  sort  or

another. Some have fled enslavement or been driven into exile

due  to  differences  with  the  local  authorities,  whether  they  be

mercenary  lords  in  Chessenta,  cultists  of  Tiamat  in  the  rem-

nants  of  Unther,  bureaucratic  priests  in  Mulhorand,  or  auto-

cratic Red Wizards in Thay. Others are sent abroad as agents of

one of the Mulan realms, serving as representatives of a Thayan

enclave,  tracking  down  relics  plundered  from  a  Mulhorandi

tomb, fighting in a Chessentan mercenary company, or spying

on those who have designs on Unthers carcass.

MULAN CHARACTERS

Mulan  typically  make  good  fighters,  whether  trained  in  the

mercenary armies of Chessenta, the church armies of Unther

and Mulhorand, or the wizard-led armies of Thay. The road to

power  in  Mulhorand  and,  until  recently,  Unther  lies  in  the

various priesthoods. As a result, many Mulan in those realms

are  clerics  of  one  of  the  Mulhorandi  gods,  Hoar,  or  Tiamat.

Chessenta  has  its  fair  share  of  clerics  as  well,  many  of  whom

serve various Faernian deities, but only the churches of Kos-

suth  and  several  evil  Faernian  deities  are  strong  in  wizard-

dominated Thay.

In Mulhorand, good-aligned deities with strong martial tra-

ditions  employ  many  paladins  in  their  service.  Wizards  and

clerics are well established in Chessenta, Mulhorand, Thay, and

Unther, although their efforts are much restricted in Mulho-

rand by the bureaucracy of priests. Bardcraft, brought back by

Chessentan  mercenaries  from  western  Faern,  is  held  in  high

esteem in Chessenta but is otherwise almost unknown in lands

dominated  by  the  Mulan.  Monks  are  found  in  large  numbers

only in Mulhorand, where most orders are integrated into the

church of Thoth. Rogues are common in the teeming cities of

Mulhorand  and  Unther,  where  priests  are  more  corrupt  than

pious. Mulan are almost never barbarians or druids, as they have

always lived in cultures established by the god-kings and their

clerics. Likewise, Mulan rarely find their calling as rangers, for

the Mulan dwell in long-settled lands with few forests or other

areas of wilderness.

Prestige  Classes: Many  Mulan  take  up  the  divine  prestige

classes of arcane devotee, divine champion, divine disciple, and

divine seeker. Assassins and blackguards devoted to evil deities

are not unknown in Mulan societies and are especially preva-

lent in Thay and Unther. In Thay, almost all Mulan wizards

of  sufficient  skill  eventually  choose  to  join  the  ranks  of  the

Red Wizards.

Mulan Society

Despite the fragmentation of the Old Empires of Mulhorand

and Unther, the Mulan have changed little despite the passage

of centuries. Strict class divisions segregate Mulan society into

the  nobility  (including  all  clerics  and  arcane  spellcasters),  the

commoners  (farmers,  merchants,  and  skilled  craftsmen),  and

slaves (everyone else). Although upward and downward mobility

is possible in Mulan society, primarily by joining the clergy or

studying  the  Art,  the  Mulan  discriminate  against  most  other

human  ethnic  groups  and  races  and  preserve  strictly  defined

class roles.

Despite  the  centuries-long  presence  of  the  god-kings,  the

Mulan are not particularly reverent, nor are they overly inter-

ested  in  commerce.  The  Mulan  aspire  to  power,  preferably

backed by magic, and engage in endless intrigues to accumulate

personal power no matter what the cost to the ideals to which

they nominally ascribe.

Mulan place great stock in education, and all members of the

nobility and middle class receive some amount of instruction as

a  child.  Many  youths  are  apprenticed  to  a  powerful  wizard

(Thay) or join the church of one of the god-kings (Mulhorand

and Unther) at a young age and are raised apart from their fam-

ilies.  As  adults,  the  Mulan  are  expected  to  serve  their  role  in

society  and  not  make  waves.  Death  is  a  lifelong  obsession  for

most Mulan, who spend their entire lives preparing themselves

for the afterlife. The Mulhorandi epitomize this obsession, plan-

ning every detail of their journey into the afterlife.

Outside Mulan-dominated lands, Mulan keep to themselves,

forming isolated enclaves apart from the local society. Thayan

enclaves are simply the latest such example of the Mulan hold-

ing  themselves  apart  from  and  above  other  races  and  human

ethnic groups when dwelling in foreign lands. Of necessity, some

cross-pollination  of  cultures  does  occur  through  trade  contact

with neighbors, but expatriate Mulan prefer to limit such con-

tacts whenever possible. Mulan from the Old Empires almost

never  venerate  deities  other  than  their  homelands  pantheon,

and most Thayans can hardly be bothered with any gods. Few

Mulan  see  the  point  of  any  languages  other  than  the  local

dialect of the Common tongue.

96

HUMANS

Ankh of ascension

Language and Literacy

Depending on their homeland, Mulan speak one of the various

tongues of the Rauric language familyall derived, at least in

part, from the slave argot of ancient Imaskar. The language of

Unther  is  Untheric,  while  the  language  of  Mulhorand,

Murghm,  Semphar,  and  Thay  is  Mulhorandi.  Untheric

employs Dethek runes for its alphabet, suggesting a strong tie

between the gold dwarves of the Great Rift and the early inhab-

itants of Unther. Mulhorandi is rendered in the Celestial alpha-

bet, first introduced by a manifestation of Thoth.

In Chessenta and the Wizards Reach, Chessentan, a tongue

closely related to Untheric with strong Chondathan

and Shaaran influences, has largely supplanted

Untheric.  The  folk  of  Chessenta  have  long

used  the  Thorass  alphabet  in  addition  to

Dethek  runes,  and  Chessentan  is  almost

exclusively  written  using  Thorass  charac-

ters.  Both  Thay  and  the  cult  of  Set  render

Mulhorandi  in  the  Infernal  alphabet,  consciously

repudiating the rule of the current god-kings.

Common  is  less  frequently  spoken  in  Mulan-

dominated lands than elsewhere in Faern, but it

still widely known nonetheless. Mulan who learn

second  tongues  often  choose  one  of  the  other

Rauric  languages  mentioned  above,  Aglarondan  (among  the

cities of the Wizards Reach),  Chondathan  (Chessenta),  Dur-

pari (southern Mulhorand), Rashemi (Thay and the Wizards

Reach),  Shaaran  (southern  Unther),  Shou  (Semphar),  and

Turmic (Chessenta and Mulhorand).

Mulan Magic and Lore

To the Mulan, magic is a tool for intrigue. Divination and illu-

sion magic are particularly valued, for they facilitate the subtle

plots that Mulan spellcasters employ.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

The  Mulan  have  strong  traditions  in  both  arcane  and  divine

spellcasting,  the  former  a  legacy  of  ancient  Imaskar  and  the

latter the result of the millennia-long residence of the god-kings

among them. These two spellcasting traditions have long been at

odds with one another, manifested most clearly in the separation

of Thay from Mulhorand.

In Thay, nearly all arcane spellcasters aspire to join the ranks

of the Red Wizards, where specialization in a school of magic is

taken to an extreme not seen elsewhere in Faern. Of those spell-

casters who are of lower rank, wizards outnumber sorcerers, and

bards are almost unknown. In Mulhorand and Unther, where the

practice of arcane magic is much restricted, most spellcasters are

clerics  of  one  of  the  many  Mulhorandi  god-kings.  Paladins  are

found in greater numbers than in other cultures, but rangers and

druids are all but unknown. In Chessenta, bards outnumber other

practitioners of the Art, and clerics of both the Faernian and

Mulhorandi pantheons are common as well.

Spellcasting  Traditions:  Mulan  favor  spells  that  ensure  per-

sonal defense and enable one to learn a deitys will. Combat spells,

particularly those of an elemental nature, are also common. In

97

Thay, arcane spells of elemental fire are much preferred. In Mul-

horand, Murghm, and Unther, spells that safeguard tombs of

the dead or inflict curses upon the living are much favored. Com-

monly known examples include augury, bestow curse, commune,

fireball, glyph of warding, and symbol.

With  their  history  of  god-kings  and  powerful  magic,  Mulan

spellcasters cast spells somewhat differently than their counter-

parts  elsewhere  on  Faern.  Those  with  the  Southern  Magician

feat (see the appendix) are able to occasionally cast arcane spells

as divine spells, or vice versa.

Unique  Spells: Although  Mulan  spellcasters  have  created

large numbers of spells, both arcane and divine, various cultural

influences have combined to ensure that few are widely known.

The priesthood of Thoth has long striven to keep arcane Mul-

horandi secrets hidden from the outside world. Infighting

between individuals as well as the various schools of

magic  in  Thay  has  kept  most  Red  Wizard  spells

from becoming widely known, even among their

fellows. In Unther, the now-dead god Gilgeam kept

very tight wraps on all new spells, seeing them as a

threat to his continued rule.

MULAN MAGIC ITEMS

The  Mulan  have  traditionally  discouraged

the creation of arcane magic items, in large part

for the same reason that the study of the Art has been discour-

agedto preserve the power of the priests. While such cultural

discouragement of magic item creation continues to hold true in

Mulhorand and, to a lesser extent, Unther and Chessenta, it has

been wholeheartedly rejected by Thayan Mulan. As indicated by

the  burgeoning  number  of  Thayan  enclaves  scattered  across

Faern, the Red Wizards are responsible for a large fraction of

the widely known types of magic items in use in Faern today.

The Red Wizards have created many unique magic items as well,

but they jealously hold such secrets for themselves.

Various  magical  staffs  are  quite  common  as  well,  as  the

quarterstaff is the original symbol of authority in the lands of

the god-kings. Khopeshes, scimitars, and swords are commonly

crafted  with  brilliant  energy,  ghost  touch,  holy,  throwing,

thundering, wounding, and unholy special abilities. Whips are

often given the wounding special ability. Quarterstaffs typically

receive disruption and holy special abilities. Armor is typically

crafted with cooling, fire resistance, or lightning resistance spe-

cial abilities.

Common  Magic  Items:  Incense  of  meditation,  necklaces  of

prayer  beads,  oil  of  timelessness,  phylacteries  of  faithfulness,

scarabs  of  protection,  rods  of  rulership,  staffs  of  healing, and

vestments of faith. The numerous priests in Mulan lands pro-

duce  enough  of  these  items  that  they  may  be  purchased  at  a

10% discount in any large city in Mulhorand or Unther (due

to the Thayan rejection of religion, this discount does not apply

in Thay).

Iconic Magic Items: Among the more powerful magic items in

many a Mulan spellcasters arsenal is the ankh of ascension (see

the appendix), which makes all her spells function better.

Mulan Deities

The Mulan are the last major human ethnic group to venerate

a pantheon of deities other than the dominant Faernian pan-

HUMANS

theon. Until the Time of Troubles, the Mulan of Mulhorand,

Murghm, and Semphar venerated the Mulhorandi pantheon,

while Unther, Threskel, and parts of Chessenta venerated the

Untheric  pantheon.  Following  the  deaths  of  Gilgeam  and

Ramman during the Avatar Crisis, the Untheric pantheon effec-

tively vanished, its last members (Tiamat and Assuran) absorbed

into the Faernian pantheon. The Mulhorandi pantheon finally

awoke to its own dire position. Today, the Mulan of Mulhorand,

Murghm, Semphar, and Unther venerate the Mulhorandi pan-

theon, while those who dwell in Chessenta, the Wizards Reach,

and Thay largely venerate the Faernian pantheon.

Assuran, the Lord of Three Thunders, is known as Hoar in

other lands. He is a deity of justice and vengeance, venerated by

Mulan of Unther and Chessenta, although his cult is strongest

in  the  cities  of  Akanax  and  Mourktar.  Hoars  church  has

declined  in  influence  in  Unther  as  Anhurs  has  grown,  but  it

remains strong in Chessenta where Hoar, in his guise as Assuran,

is venerated as a god of storms and regarded as one of the celes-

tial patrons of the country.

Horus-Re,  the  Lord  of  the  Sun,  is  worshiped  primarily  by

Mulhorandi who govern and administer. Although his faith is

strongest in Mulhorand, his church has attracted an increasing

number of adherents from the ranks of the fallen Untheric god

Gilgeam who have renounced their formerly wicked ways. Cler-

ics of Horus-Re rule vast estates in the name of their deity, and

control an immense amount of wealth and power in Mulhorand.

Women in Mulhorand and Unther have long worshiped Isis, the

Bountiful  Lady,  known  as  Ishtar  in  Unther.  She  has  a  very

strong following among good-aligned arcane spellcasters.

Before  his  death  the  Untheric  god  Gilgeam  blamed  Tiamat

for all Unthers ills, driving many Untherites who opposed his

harsh  rule  into  her  embrace.  The  Dragon  Queen  earned  her

moniker  as  Nemesis  of  the  Gods  when  she  slew  the  Supreme

Ruler of Unther during the Time of Troubles, an act of libera-

tion  that  has  earned  her  church  large  numbers  of  adherents,

even among nonevil Mulan. In neighboring Chessenta, Tiamat

has many followers as well, for there she is known as Tchazzar,

the red dragon Father of Chessenta. In time, her church is likely

to contract when Tiamats true nature is finally revealed.

Relations with Other Races

The Mulan view members of other human ethnic groups with

disdain. The Turami minorities of Mulhorand, Unther, Threskel,

and Chessenta are generally tolerated, (except in Unther, where

they are almost universally despised), but they are always con-

sidered  members  of  the  lower  class.  North  of  the  Wizards

Reach, the Rashemi form the bulk of the lower class of Thay.

The Red Wizards nominally restrict their ranks to Mulan wiz-

ards and sorcerers, but many look the other way if they find a

Rashemi spellcaster skilled in the Art and willing to pretend to

be  a  Mulan,  although  powerful  Rashemi  wizards  can  dispense

with the charade.

The Mulan get along with the gold dwarves of the Great Rift,

thanks  to  centuries  of  trade,  and  are  inclined  to  view  all  the

Stout  Folk  in  similar  light,  although  arctic  dwarves  and  wild

dwarves  might  prove  an  exception.  Rock  gnomes  are  largely

unknown, so the Mulan view them as little dwarves. Halflings

are similarly rare, as the largest nearby concentration of the hin

lies  in  far-off  Luiren,  and  are  generally  treated  much  like

dwarves as well. Elves and half-elves are almost unknown to the

Mulan and the subject of great superstition, stemming in large

part from the frustrations Unthers armies experienced long ago

while attempting to subjugate the Yuirwood. In Mulhorand and

Unther, the Fair Folk are seen as wizards by the bureaucracy of

priests, and thus are regarded with the same combination of fear

and loathing as Red Wizards of Thay.

The Mulan despise half-orcs, a legacy of the Orcgate Wars

handed  down  for  centuries.  Western  Chessenta  is  a  notable

exception, particularly in the city of Airspur, where half-orcs

are tolerated. Of the nonhuman civilized races, planetouched,

particularly  aasimar,  are  the  only  race  looked  up  to  by  the

Mulan. After millennia of intimate involvement with the god-

kings, aasimar of Mulan descent are seen as descendants of the

gods and thus worthy of great respect. Tieflings engender fear

rather than reverence, for they are seen as the spawn of Set

and Sebek. Genasai are scarce, although fire genasi of Mulan

descent  are  treated  as  full-blooded  Mulan  in  Thay  and  wel-

comed into the School of Evocation.

Mulan Equipment

Mulan favor simple, unadorned clothing, such as white tunics,

black headdresses, belts, and sandals. In colder climes, more col-

orful garments may be worn, but the fashion is for clothing to

remain plain, a tradition originally begun so as not to challenge

the  majesty  of  the  god-kings.  Tattoos  are  the  most  common

form of adornment, often depicting stylized representations of

various beasts and monsters, cryptic runes, and abstract designs.

ARMS AND ARMOR

In  ages  past,  Mulan  employed  bronze  weapons,  typically

khopeshes or scimitars, and many relics fashioned of bronze are

still in use today as ceremonial attire or because they bear pow-

erful  magic.  Modern-day  Mulan  favor  steel  swords,  introduced

after the gold dwarves passed on the secret of forging steel, and

composite bows, which were used to great effect during the Orc-

gate  Wars.  Most  other  weapons  employed  in  western  Faern,

with  the  exception  of  longspears  and  other  polearms,  are

employed to varying degrees by the Mulan as well. Quarterstaffs

are favored in Mulhorand, particularly by clerics, and whips are

the weapon of choice of many Red Wizards. The armor of choice

of most Mulan is scale mail, although they have adopted chain-

mail and breastplates in recent centuries. Heavy armor is almost

unknown, possessed only by the greatest warriors.

Common  Items:  Scale  mail,  banded  mail,  scimitar,  khopesh,

light mace, heavy mace, shortspear, composite longbow.

ANIMALS AND PETS

In  lands  ruled  by  the  god-kings,  the  Mulan  revere  felines  as

divine  agents,  reflecting  the  lingering  influence  of  the  Cult  of

Bast centuries after that minor Mulhorandi goddess evolved into

Sharess. Horses are highly prized in greater Mulhorand, particu-

larly in Murghm and Semphar. Perhaps because of its large pop-

ulation of centaurs, Thay is not particularly known for its horses.

Instead,  black  unicorns  form  the  heart  of  Thayan  cavalry

squadrons. In Thay, arcane spellcasters of Mulan descent employ

imps,  quasits,  shocker  lizards,  stirges,  tiny  snakes,  and  toads  as

familiars.  Members  of  the  Order  of  the  Magi  in  Mulhorand

prefer  animals  associated  with  their  patron  deity,  particularly

hawks and ibises.

HUMANS

Human, Rashemi

Regions:  Aglarond,  Hordelands,  Rashemen,  Thay,  Thesk,

Rashemi.

Racial Feats: Aftersight.

Concentrated in the harsh and dangerous northeastern reaches of

Faern,  the  Rashemi  are  tough  and  sturdy,  undaunted  by

extremes of weather or human cruelty. Despite their relative iso-

lation  from  the  rest  of  Faern,  most  Rashemi  are  surprisingly

well  versed  in  the  affairs  of  other  nations,  for  many  travel

extensively  as  youths  as  part  of  a  coming-of-age  ritual

known  as  a  dajemma.  Although  Rashemi  barbarians

and rangers are widely known across Faern, mem-

bers of this ethnic group also make skilled wizards,

sorcerers, and clerics.

Descended  from  the  nomadic  tribes  that

fought  and  won  the  Orcgate  Wars  and  later

built the empire of Raumathar, the Rashemi

are the most numerous human ethnic group

on the Priador plateau and in the lands that

border Ashanath, the Lake of Tears. Outside

Thay  and  Rashemen,  Rashemi  minorities

are  also  found  in  Aglarond,  Damara,  the

Great  Dale,  Impiltur,  Mulhorand,  Narfell,

the  Wizards  Reach,  Mulhorand,  Semphar,

Thesk, and Unther. Although not widespread,

Rashemi  culture  has  had  a  significant  influ-

ence on both Damaran and Tuigan culture, and

in  its  day  the  Rashemi  empire  of  Raumathar

rivaled the power of Mulhorand and Unther.

Witch shield

Most Rashemi average about five and a half feet in

height, with stout and muscular builds. Most are dusky of

skin  and  dark  of  eye,  with  thick  black  hair.  Rashemi

males are unusually hirsute and often sport bushy black

beards. Although handsome, many seem almost ursine in

nature.  Baldness  is  almost  unknown  among  Rashemi  males,

although inhabitants of Thay are known to shave all body hair

in  imitation  of  the  ruling  Mulan.  Female  Rashemi  wear  their

black hair long, often in elaborate braids.

The Rashemi display little of the cultural arrogance common

to other major human ethnic groups whose ancestors once ruled

empires.  Instead,  they  see  themselves  as  inhabitants  of  a  harsh

but beautiful world ruled by place spirits, and cherish their strong

and abiding ties to the land. Most Rashemi identify themselves

by  national  origins  (for  example,  Rashemaar,  Thayan,  or

Theskan) rather than ethnicity, although centuries of harsh rule

by the Mulan in Thay have done much to strength sympathies

between the Rashemi of Thay and the inhabitants of Rashemen.

Little emphasis is placed on the acquisition of wealth or ancestry,

as each child is expected to earn his or her own place in the world.

History

The Rashemi arose from various tribal peoples who lived in the

land of Rashemen long before the fall of Imaskar in 2488 DR.

They  were  warlike  and  insular,  fighting  against  the  efforts  of

more numerous tribes to claim parts of Rashemen for their own.

They  fiercely  resisted  Mulhorandi  efforts  to  tame  the  lands

north of Lake Mulsantir. Since the Rashemi could not be pushed

99

aside,  the  Mulhorandi  who  governed  the  northern  frontiers  of

their empire employed them as mercenaries against other tribal

peoples in the area.

The opening of a large portal on the Priador Plateau in 1076

DR and the subsequent arrival of a vast horde of orcs marked the

end of the First Empire of Mulhorand. During the Orcgate Wars

of 1075 DR to 1069 DR, the Nars, the Rashemi, the Raumvi-

rans, the Sossrims, and other tribes all served as mercenaries in

the  vanguard  of  Mulhorands  armies.  Although  the  orcs  were

eventually defeated, Mulhorands hold on its far-flung northern

provinces was broken.

Although most of the northern tribes returned to their ances-

tral lands and traditional way of life, both the Raumvirans and

the Nars saw the collapse of Mulhorands northern provinces as

an  opportunity  to  establish  empires  of  their  own.  Over  the

course of the next two centuries, the Raumvirans gradually

conquered much of the Endless Wastes while the Nars

extended their rule south and west along the shores

of the Easting Reach. By 900 DR, the Raumvi-

rans established the empire of Raumathar with

its  capital  at  Winterkeep,  stretching  from  the

northern  tip  of  Lake  Ashane  to  the  western

shore of the Great Ice Sea and from Sossal to

the  Lake  of  Mists.  The  Nars  established  the

empire of Narfell from the uplands of Impil-

tur to Ashanath.

Both  empires  turned  their  attention  to  the

Priador Plateau, populated by nomadic tribes of

centaurs  and  gnolls.  Raumathar  saw  the

Rashemi tribal lands between Lake Ashane and

the  Sunset  Mountains  as  a  corridor  through

which  it  could  settle  the  Priador  Plateau,  while

Narfell  saw  the  land  of  Rashemen  as  a  natural

chokepoint to contain its rivals ambitions. The two

empires fought many battles on the eastern shore of

Lake Ashane, leading to its appellation as the Lake of

Tears. The Rashemi clans divided into three camps: allies

of Narfell, allies of Raumathar, and those who struggled

to remain independent.

In the centuries that followed, battles between the conjurers of

Raumathar  and  the  sorcerers  of  Narfell  became  increasingly

common, turning the Priador Plateau into a sprawling battlefield

fought  over  by  Rashemi  mercenaries  in  the  employ  of  both

armies. Matters came to a head in 150 DR, with the summon-

ing of numerous powerful monsters and minor deities that con-

sumed both empires in a great conflagration. The city of Kensten

(modern Bezantur) was consumed by an avatar of Kossuth, while

an army of fiends led by demon lord Eltab invaded Rashemen.

In the wake of their mutual defeat, the surviving inhabitants

of Narfell and Raumathar retreated into tiny enclaves, leaving

the surviving summoned beings as the only real power north of

the  Alamber  Sea.  Both  Unther  and  Mulhorand  quickly  sent

armies  north  before  the  Summoned  could  establish  their  own

realms. In 148 DR, the southern armies defeated an alliance of

the Summoned, and Mulhorand reoccupied the Priador Plateau.

In  Rashemen,  however,  the  demon  lord  Eltab  and  his  minions

still ruled the land.

Eltabs rule came to an end in 75 DR, following the emer-

gence of the Witches of Rashemen. The earliest witches were of

Raumviran descent, a secret sisterhood formed in the dying days

of  Raumathar  to  preserve  that  empires  magical  lore.  The

alliance of the Rashemi and the Raumviran witches finally lib-

HUMANS

erated Rashemen from demonic rule. The hero of this conflict

was a warrior named Yvengi, who wielded a great magical blade

named  Hadryllis  against  Eltab,  severely  wounding  the  demon

lord and forcing him to flee.

Yvengi declared Rashemen a free and sovereign land, defy-

ing  machinations  by  the  Mulhorandi  to  extend  their  rule

north  of  the  Priador.  Undeterred,  Mulhorand  launched  an

invasion of Rashemen in 45 DR. Rashemen would have most

likely fallen to the invaders if not for the continued alliance

of the witches and the berserker lodges against this common

foe.  Rashemens  defenders  sent  Mulhorands  imperial  army

fleeing back across the frontier, forever cementing the lands

independence. The battle won, the witches once again retreated

into the shadows, leaving Rashemen to the allied clans of the

Rashemi. All the leaders of the sisterhood asked in exchange

for  their  assistance  was  the  right  to  select  Rashemens  Iron

Lord, or huhrong.

In  the  years  following  Rashemens  defense  of  its  independ-

ence, the Rashemi were effectively split into two populations.

Those who dwelt on the Priador served the ruling Mulan and

adopted the laws and mores of the Mulhorandi, while those who

dwelt in Rashemen slowly claimed much of fallen Raumathar.

At various times, Rashemen has held territory spanning from

the Icerim Mountains to the northern shore of Lake Mulsan-

tir and from the eastern shore of Lake Ashane to the eastern

slopes of the Sunrise Mountains.

In 922 DR, the Red Wizards sacked the Mulhorandi provin-

cial capital of Delhumide, sparking an insurrection against the

Mulhorandi  god-kings  that  led  to  the  establishment  of  the

magocracy of Thay and the subjugation of the Rashemi inhabi-

tants of the plateau to a new set of masters. After centuries of

complacency, the Rashemi inhabitants of Rashemen found their

land under attack by Thays new rulers in 934 DR. Once again

the Rashemi battled a Mulan-led army marching north through

the Gorge of Gauros, and once again the Witches of Rashemen

proved instrumental in repelling the invasion.

In the centuries since, the armies of Thay have attempted to

invade Rashemen no less than twenty times, each time without

success. Each time the Rashemi berserkers and witches have met

the  armies  of  gnolls,  centaurs,  and  Thayan  Rashemi  beneath

their  Mulan  masters,  the  Fangs  of  Rashemen  have  prevailed.

The  most  recent  threat  to  Rashemen  unfolded  in  1359  DR,

when  the  Tuigan  horde  swept  westward  from  the  Endless

Wastes.  After  overrunning  Citadel  Rashemaar  and  marching

across  the  northern  reaches  of  the  Sunset  Mountains,  the

Tuigan  horde  swept  into  Rashemens  interior,  supported  by  a

Thayan army poised to strike from the Gorge of Gauros. Aided

by a fierce winter storm that pinned down the Thayan army, the

Rashemaar  eventually  drove  the  Tuigans  across  Lake  Ashane

into  Thesk  where  they  were  defeated  by  an  alliance  led  by

Cormyrs King Azoun IV.

Outlook

The Rashemi view life as an unending series of challenges to be

faced and overcome. They place a strong emphasis on strength,

whether it is physical strength among the folk of Rashemen or

magical prowess among the Thayan Rashemi. Respect and status

must be earned, and a great deal of emphasis is placed on indi-

vidual accomplishment. Childhood among the Rashemi reflects

this  cultural  outlook,  as  youths  are  subjected  to  greater  and

greater tests as they mature. Admittance into the ranks of their

elders must be earned.

The most common reason for adventuring among the Rashemi

is the coming-of-age ritual known as the dajemma. Rashemi youth

are encouraged (required, in the case of males in Rashemen itself)

to go on a yearlong journey to see the world, after which they are

accorded the status of adults. Naturally, some fall into a life of

adventuring during such a trip, although most eventually return

home and settle down. The Witches of Rashemen have their own

reasons for setting out into the world, including the recovery of

ancient magics hidden across Faern and the effort to oppose the

machinations of the Red Wizards of Thay.

RASHEMI CHARACTERS

The Rashemi have a long-standing warrior tradition dating back

to the Orcgate Wars, and barbarians, rangers, and fighters play a

prominent role in Rashemi society. Likewise, the Rashemi hold

arcane  spellcasters  in  great  respect,  including  the  mysterious

wychlaran  and  the  greatly  feared  Red  Wizards.  Clerics,  druids,

paladins, and monks are relatively rare, for the Rashemi do not

have a strong tradition of organized religion outside the Witches

of Rashemen. Rogues are almost unknown, for the Rashemi have

never placed a strong emphasis on the accumulation of wealth.

Prestige Classes: The most common prestige class for Rashemi

is, of course, the hathran, although a small number of Rashemi

wizards living in Thay become Red Wizards.

Rashemi Society

Rashemi culture varies widely from Rashemen to Thay to Thesk,

although  each  society  exhibits  some  common  traits.  In  Rashe-

men,  contests  of  physical  and  martial  prowess  are  common,

including snow-racing, skiing, wrestling, drinking, and the like. In

Thesk, most contests revolve around the accumulation of wealth

through skill at trade. In Thay, the influence of the Red Wizards

has raised magical prowess above all other forms of contests. The

Rashemi of all three lands share a common suspicion of excessive

civilization, which is often seen as soft or weak, and place little

emphasis on inherited titles or wealth.

The Rashemi have never placed a strong emphasis on school-

ing for a variety of reasons. In Rashemen, the land is continu-

ally beset by outside threats that require warriors, not scholars.

Those who do study as children are usually tutored by one of the

mysterious witches. In Thay, the ruling Mulan have long been

suspicious of academic inclinations among the lower classes and

discourage the lower class (specifically, the Rashemi) from exces-

sive study. Rashemi youths are given to carousing and compet-

ing with their friends. As adults, the Rashemi are expected to

settle down and contribute to society, although industriousness

is not as highly respected as it is in other lands. Elderly Rashemi

are respected for their wisdom and their mental strength, even

if  their  physical  faculties  have  faded.  Their  past  accomplish-

ments are not forgotten, even if they no longer can perform

such feats. Death is seen as a time of celebration, for it is then

that a Rashemis deeds enter into legend.

Outside their native lands, the Rashemi congregate in groups

of fellow exiles. Their nights are spent wandering from tavern

to  tavern,  challenging  the  locals  to  contests.  Few  find  steady

work  except  as  mercenaries,  and  those  who  do  quickly  spend

their meager coin on their fellow expatriates.

HUMANS

Language and Literacy

Rashemi speak Common and their national language, whatever

that may be. The Rashemi language, derived from Raumvira and

the dead language Halardrim, uses the Thorass alphabet intro-

duced by Chondathan traders traveling along the Golden Way.

The  Rashemi  tongue  is  commonly  employed  only  within  the

borders of Rashemen. In fact, more Rashemi speak the Thayan

dialect  of  Mulhorandi  as  their  mother  tongue  than  speak

Rashemi. Other languages with a significant number of Rashemi

speakers include Aglarondan, Chondathan, and Damaran.

The most common secondary languages among the Rashemi

are Mulhorandi (particularly the Thayan dialect) or Rashemi,

depending on whether they live in Rashemen or Thay, respec-

tively. Those Rashemi who dwell farther west often learn Chon-

dathan, Damaran, Aglarondan, Chessentan, or Untheric.

All  Rashemi  characters  are  literate  except  for  barbarians,

adepts, experts, warriors, and commoners.

Rashemi Magic and Lore

The  Rashemi  have  a  strong  spellcasting  tradition,  stemming

from the twin influences of Raumviran and Mulan culture and

the  plundered  lore  of  Narfell,  Raumathar,  and  Mulhorand.

Rashemi bloodlines often give rise to powerful sorcerers of an

elemental nature, derived from a small amount of Raumviran

ancestry. In Rashemen, female Rashemi spellcasters are usually

wychlaran,  adopting  the  hathran  prestige  class  as  they  rise  in

level. Male arcane spellcasters of that land often focus prima-

rily on the crafting of magic items. In Thay, those few Rashemi

who  aspire  to  wizardry  usually  specialize  in  one  of  the  eight

schools of magic and then adopt the Red Wizard prestige class

if allowed to.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

The Rashemi favor spells of conjuration or those that enhance

their personal fighting prowess, although spells that aid survival

in a harsh climate are common as well. Favored spells include

bulls  strength,  cats  grace,  endurance,  endure  elements,  magic

weapon, Tensers transformation, and the various summon mon-

ster spells. The Witches of Rashemen are more inclined toward

spells  of  concealment  and  charm,  drawn  primarily  from  the

schools of Enchantment and Illusion, while Rashemi Red Wiz-

ards favor spells from their school of specialization.

Spellcasting Traditions: The dominant spellcasting traditions

among the Rashemi are those of the Hathran and the Red Wiz-

ards of Thay.

RASHEMI MAGIC ITEMS

Among the Rashemi, the art of crafting magic items is the pre-

serve  of  the  vremyonni  (the  Old  Ones,  or  male  wizards)  of

Rashemen. Many of the items the Old Ones create are designed

for use by the female witches or by the lands fabled berserkers.

The Witches of Rashemen favor magic whips and various magic

masks. Items commonly crafted for Rashemi warriors include

armor with the warming property, and greataxes, swords, and

scimitars with the berserker property.

Common Magic Items: Amulets of natural armor, bracers of

armor, boots of the winterlands, gauntlets of ogre power, and rings

of wizardry. The folk of Rashemen jealously guard items made

by their vremyonni, but in other Rashemi lands these items are

commonly available at a 10% discount on the purchase price in

any small city.

Iconic Magic Item: Rashemi berserkers and champions some-

times wear the mask of the implacable (see the appendix), which

grants its wearer bonuses against foes who gravely wound her.

Rashemi Deities

Traditionally,  the  Rashemi  venerate  the  Three  Chauntea,

Mielikki,  and  the  Hidden  One  (Mystra),  a  trio  of  goddesses

introduced  centuries  ago  to  Rashemen  by  the  folk  of  Thesk.

They also venerate a host of local place-spirits and spirit-heroes

little known elsewhere in Faern. The spirits of Rashemen do

not  have  names,  but  express  their  actions  through  miracles,

omens, and by dispatching servitors. Outside Rashemen, many

Rashemi nominally venerate the deities of Mulhorand as well.

However, centuries of persecution by the Red Wizards of Thay

have ensured that such worship is confined largely to the home.

Small cults of the four elemental deities, particularly Kossuth,

exist as well, legacies of Raumviran influence over the culture

of the Rashemi.

Relations with Other Races

Northeastern  Faern  is  largely  devoid  of  nonhuman  civiliza-

tions, leaving the Rashemi generally ignorant of nonhuman cul-

tures other than the centaurs and gnolls of the Thayan Plateau.

Dwarves are perhaps the best-known race, as the dwarven king-

dom  of  Siremun  in  the  Firepeaks  to  the  east  has  long  traded

with Rashemi traders in the markets of Almorel. Elves, half-

elves, and halflings are viewed as objects of wonder, long asso-

ciated with the fey creatures of the North Country. Gnomes are

also  regarded  as  creatures  of  magic.  Half-orcs,  tieflings,  and

genasi are regarded with long-standing suspicion, the legacy of

centuries  of  folklore  that  have  grown  up  around  the  Orcgate

Wars  and  the  conflagration  unleashed  by  Narfell  and  Rau-

mathar. Aasimars are closely associated with the various Mul-

horandi  priesthoods  and  treated  accordingly.  Among  human

cultures, the Rashemi get along best with the Nars and the Soss-

rims. Despite the close proximity in which many Rashemi and

Mulan  dwell,  relations  between  the  two  cultures  are  tense  at

best, with hostility (usually cloaked) the norm.

Rashemi Equipment

Centuries of interaction with the cultures of the east have led to

the  infiltration  of  many  Tuigan  and  Shou  influences  in

Rashemi  tools,  weapons,  and  gear.  Rashemi  often  wear  warm

clothing of leather, buckskin, hide, and fur, making the best use

of the materials at hand.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Favored  armor  in  the  colder  reaches  north  of  Thay  includes

thick hide armor, often made from the pelts of bears or snow

tigers,  and  large  steel  shields.  Northern  Rashemi  warriors

101

HUMANS

employ all manner of weapons, including greataxes and shorts-

pears. They favor curved swords such as the scimitar and sabre.

Rashemi  native  to  more  temperate  climes  are  more  heavily

influenced  by  the  East  and  favor  nunchaku,  sianghams,  and

spiked chains.

Common  Items:  Hide  armor,  studded  leather  armor,  nun-

chaku, siangham, spiked chain, sabre.

Unique Items: Rashemi from colder climes sometimes use ice

axes as weapons (treat as light picks, but they deal both slashing

and piercing damage).

ANIMALS AND PETS

Rashemi  favor  large  canines  and  small  felines  as  pets.  The

Rashemaar  favor  big  working  dogs  with  heavy  coats,  bred  to

serve as pack animals or sled dogs. The Witches of Rashemen

favor  ravens  as  familiars,  although  owls  and  cats  are  not

unknown. Rashemi dwelling in warmer climes, such as Thay, evi-

dence the same reverence for cats as do the Mulan. Equines also

play  an  important  role  in  Rashemi  society.  Less  commonly

employed steeds include the black unicorns of Thay.

Rashemi Region

Rashemi native to the land of Rashemen should choose Rashe-

men (detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting) as

their characters region. By contrast, the Rashemi region reflects

a character from Thesk, Thay, or Mulhorand, where Rashemi

tend to be an underclass ostracized by their neighbors.

Preferred Classes: The Rashemi region is preferred by bar-

barians, clerics, fighters, monks, and sorcerers. A character of

one of these classes may choose a regional feat and gain her

choice of the bonus equipment below as a 1st-level character.

A Rashemi character of any other class may not select one of

the regional feats here and does not gain the bonus equipment

at 1st level.

The  Sword  Coast  has  long  been  home  to  native  human  tribes

who intermingled with wave upon wave of immigrants, whether

they arrived as conquerors or refugees. In recent centuries, these

disparate groups have gradually coalesced into a relatively new

ethnic group known as Tethyrians, occupying a vast territory

stretching from Calimshan to Silverymoon and from the Sea of

Swords to the Sea of Fallen Stars. After centuries of enslave-

ment and oppression by one group or another, Tethyrians are

fiercely independent, protective of their freedoms and suspicious

of threats posed by powerful kingdoms and empires. Given their

disparate  ancestry,  Tethyrians  have  never  developed  a  unique

language  of  their  own,  instead  adopting  the  language  of  the

latest wave of conquerors or refugees. Today most Tethyrians

speak Chondathan.

As Tethyrian culture is a melting pot of Calishite, Chonda-

than, Illuskan, and Low Netherese, Tethyrians are tolerant of

and comfortable with members of other ethnic groups, with the

notable  exceptions  of  upper  class  Calishites  and,  to  a  lesser

extent,  Mulan  of  Thayan  descent.  In  Calimshan,  Tethyrians

compose the bulk of the lower classes and have long been dis-

criminated against by the largely Calishite upper classes. Outside

Calimshan,  many  Tethyrians  are  craftsmen  or  caravanners,

while others find employment as mercenaries in the employ of

other  realms.  Tethyrians  make  skilled  fighters  and  rogues,

reflecting the struggle to survive successive waves of conquest

and generations of warfare. Tethyrian culture has a long tradi-

tion of bardcraft, reflecting the absence of a Tethyrian empire

at any point in history and the corresponding reliance on itin-

erant bards to preserve and spread Tethyrian oral history.

Tethyrians are of medium build and height, although taller

and broader in build than most Calishites. Their skin tends to

have  a  dusky  hue,  although  on  average  they  are  increasingly

fairer  in  complexion  the  farther  north  one  travels  along  the

Sword Coast, reflecting a decreasing fraction of Calishite her-

itage and an increasing fraction of Illuskan and Low Netherese

ancestry. Tethyrian hair and eye color varies widely, with brown

hair and blue eyes being most common.

Most Tethyrians are proud of their multi-ethnic heritage,

seeing their society as having defeated all would-be conquerors

through assimilation rather than empire. Tethyrians are sus-

picious  of  remote  rulers  and  large  realms,  a  cultural  bias

reflected  in  the  predominance  of  city-states  over  kingdoms

and  empires  in  Tethyrian-dominated  regions.  If  Tethyrians

have  a  common  weakness,  it  is  their  reluctance  to  come

together in common cause with those who are not their imme-

diate neighbors.

History

The history of humanity along the western coast of Faern is

largely one of assimilation, conquest, and slavery, but it begins

with primitive tribes dwelling in relative isolation, their pres-

ence tolerated by the great empires of other races. Fragments

of elven lore dating back to the height of Shantel Othreier and

Keltormir speak of small tribes of humans dwelling beneath

the boughs of the great forests that once stretched from the

Spine of the World to the Shining Sea. Likewise, fragments of

dwarven lore dating back to the height of High Shanatar also

indicate that scattered human tribes dwelling in what is now

Tethyr  and  Amn  swore  fealty  to  the  rulers  of  House  Axe-

march as well.

The first great migration into the western tribal lands began

with the establishment of the Calim Empire in 7800 DR. The

djinn  brought  with  them  human  slaves,  the  progenitors  of

todays Calishites. In 6100 DR, these Calishite forebears estab-

lished  the  human-ruled  nation  of  Coramshan,  absorbing  the

native human tribes that dwelt south of the Marching Moun-

tains into the lower class of Coramshan.

The establishment of the First Kingdom of Mir in 5330 DR

marked the beginning of High Shanatars decline and the north-

ward-spreading  influence  of  humanity.  By  the  fall  of  High

102

HUMANS

Shanatar in 2600 DR, Calimshan had become one of the great

centers of human civilization in Faern, and the human tribes

that once dwelt peacefully under dwarven rule in what is now

western Tethyr had been enslaved by their new Calishite rulers.

By the end of the Third Age of Calimshan in 900 DR, Calishite

hegemony extended into the Calishar Emirates, lands that would

become eastern Tethyr and Amn.

The first stirrings of rebellion among the human tribes that

would  in  time  become  known  as  Tethyrians  began  during  the

Night Wars, a series of incursions by the drow that weakened

Calishite control over the local dwarven and human populations.

By 650 DR, these regions were largely free of Calishite control,

although  surrounded  by  Calishite  territories.  Inspired  by  this

rebellion, revolts among enslaved humans became common in

other Calishite territories between 670 DR and 370 DR. The

clans  were  forced  to  defend  their  independence  on  numerous

occasions, culminating in the crowning of Tethyrs first king in

212 DR.

The Age of Shoon began in 27 DR, when Qysar Amahl Shoon

III  inherited  the  crowns  of  Tethyr  and  Calimshan,  thanks  in

large part to the scheming of his great-great-grandfather. In the

centuries that followed, the Imperiums reach extended around

the Shining Sea, deep into the Shaar, and north into Amn. The

armies  of  Qysar  Shoon  VII  pushed  north  beyond  the  Cloud

Peaks in 361 DR, where they were in turn met by the armies of

Cormyr, which marched west and then south into the heart of

Tethyr. Although neither the Shoon Imperium nor the Forest

Kingdom of Cormyr formally claimed the region north of the

Cloud Peaks and west of the Sunset Mountains, their activities

led large waves of settlers into the region.

Since  the  fall  of  the  Shoon  Imperium,  Tethyrians  have

slowly spread throughout the Western Heartlands and north

along  the  Sea  of  Swords,  settling  new  lands  and  establishing

powerful city-states. One major group of Tethyrians migrated

west to the Moonshae Isles in 467 DR, where they intermarried

with  the  native  human  tribes,  known  as  the  Ffolk.  Another

major wave of Tethyrian migration helped found the kingdom

of Phalorm in 523 DR after the fall of the older Illuskan-ruled

realms  of  the  Sword  Coast  North  to  the  ever-worsening  orc

hordes. The Realm of Three Crowns collapsed in 615 DR in the

face of unrelenting attacks by orcs and the withdrawal of elves

and  dwarves  from  the  alliance.  In  the  aftermath  the  largely

Tethyrian population established Delimbiyran, the Kingdom of

Man, in 616 DR. Delimbiyran collapsed in 697 DR after the

royal house died out, but lesser successor states continued to

occupy the lower Delimibiyr river valley for centuries there-

after.  Meanwhile,  Tethyrian  settlers  pushed  north  along  the

Dessarin river valley, eventually reaching the cities that now

make up the Silver Marches.

Perhaps the most notable aspect of Tethyrian history since

the collapse of the Shoon Imperium is the utter absence of any

large empires in its annals. Even Waterdeep, perhaps the most

powerful Tethyrian-dominated city-state, has never attempted

to forge a Tethyrian empire.

Outlook

Tethyrians view life as a struggle to be survived through ties to

family, clan, and tribe. To a Tethyrian, freedom is the most pre-

cious gift, and the enslavement of another is the greatest sin.

Although an individual may guard his or her freedom through

skill at arms or the accumulation of wealth and status, these are

merely different means to a far more precious end. Loyalty to

ones kin and neighbor and generosity to those in need are con-

sidered far more lasting than the fleeting favor of Lady Luck.

Although it has been many generations since the majority of

Tethyrians dwelt in tribes, the cultural tradition of loyalty to

those  held  dear  is  as  strong  today  as  it  ever  was.  Where  a

Tethyrian lacks kin or clan, his loyalty is transferred to settle-

ment,  guild,  company,  band,  or  other  organization  from  a

young age.

Tethyrians  usually  take  up  a  life  of  adventure  in  hopes  of

redressing a wrong to family, clan, or tribe, or in search of the

freedom  to  chart  their  own  course  in  life.  Many  would-be

adventurers  are  inspired  by  tale  of  the  legendary  Tethyrian

heroes of yore, whose exploits have been recounted for genera-

tions by traveling bards. A Tethyrian adventurer would rather

wield  a  blade  carried  by  his  ancestors  than  have  a  new  one

forged,  and  would  rather  spend  his  last  coin  on  a  bards  tale

than a pint of ale.

TETHYRIAN CHARACTERS

Bards  occupy  an  honored  role  in  Tethyrian  culture,  and  many

aspire  to  the  rank  of  master  bard.  Fighters  and  rogues  are

common  in  civilized  regions,  while  rangers  flourish  among

outlaw  communities.  Clerics  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  druids  are

quite common as well, as the intermingling of cultures has pro-

duced a great deal of theological strife in centuries past. Wizards

and sorcerers are also commonplace, although they rarely work

in concert together. Monks and paladins are rare among Tethyr-

ians, as adherence to a code of conduct rarely stands the test of

family, clan, and tribal loyalties.

Prestige Classes: From their dim origins many centuries ago,

the  Tethyrians  have  a  dark  legacy  of  shadow  magic,  so  more

than a few Tethyrian rogues become shadowdancers. Tethyrian

rogues  also  dominate  lands  such  as  Amn  and  the  Western

Heartlands, so the guild thief is common as well. The paths of

the loremaster and archmage are both attractive to Tethyrian

wizards.  Good-aligned  Tethyrian  heroes  often  become  Harper

scouts, while those native to Cormyr frequently serve as Purple

Dragon knights.

Tethyrian Society

Although  the  cultures  of  most  major  human  ethnic  groups

exhibit  regional  variations,  Tethyrian  culture  exhibits  much

greater regional variation than most. Tethyrians dwelling in Cal-

imshan,  Tethyr,  and  Amn  share  much  in  common  with  their

Calishite neighbors. Similarly, Tethyrians dwelling in the North

hold much in common with Illuskan culture, and Tethyrians of

the Western Heartlands exhibit many cultural traits shared with

the Chondathans who dwell to the east.

Nevertheless,  Tethyrian  culture  does  exhibit  certain  unique

characteristics. Tethyrians place a high value on personal free-

dom, and regard kingdoms and empires with a great deal of sus-

picion.  Noble-minded  rebels  are  much  admired  in  Tethyrian

folklore,  ensuring  that  many  common  bandits  of  Tethyrian

ancestry refer to themselves as freedom fighters. Tethyrians

despise class divisions based on heritage, as they have long been

subject  to  prejudice  by  their  Calishite  neighbors  to  the  south.

However, class divisions based on wealth and personal accom-

plishment play a strong role in many Tethyrian societies.

103

HUMANS

Aside from bards, Tethyrians have not traditionally had access

to book learning, although those who do are much esteemed by

their peers. Childhood is short, with even the youngest children

expected to contribute to their familys way of life. Adults earn

their keep practicing the same trade as their parents, and many

have  the  same  surname  as  their  profession.  Familial,  clan,  and

tribal bonds require that adults look out for one another, so the

elderly  and  those  who  cannot  earn  their  keep  turn  to  relatives

and friends for support. In death, the body is buried quickly and

simply. The person is celebrated through stories and songs, their

memory preserved and maintained through bardcraft.

Outside  Tethyrian-dominated  lands,  Tethyrians  usually  form

an  insular  underclass,  welcoming  of  others  yet  holding  them-

selves  apart.  Tethyrians  have  little  resistance  to  adopting  local

deities, languages, and dialects, but their traditional ties to other

Tethyrians  serve  to  isolate  them  from  their  non-Tethyrian

neighbors. Tethyrians usually organize themselves into extended

clans and guilds, dominating one or two trades in the surround-

ing culture.

Language and Literacy

Most Tethyrians speak Common as their primary language, usu-

ally  a  singsong  dialect  known  as  Calant  that  is  heavily  influ-

enced  by  Alzhedo  and  popular  along  the  Sword  Coast.  They

employ the Thorass alphabet. As Talfir and other languages of

the original western tribes vanished long ago, there is no ances-

tral  Tethyrian  tongue.  Instead,  Tethyrians  have  always

adopted the languages of the latest wave of immigration. Today,

most Tethyrians speak Chondathan, a legacy of the mercantile

invasion from the east in recent centuries, although a few speak

Illuskan or Alzhedo instead.

All  Tethyrian  characters  are  literate  except  for  barbarians,

commoners, and warriors.

Tethyrian Magic and Lore

Tethyrians have strong arcane and divine spellcasting traditions.

Bardcraft  is  revered,  and  many  master  bards  are  of  Tethyrian

stock.  The  varied  nature  of  Tethyrian  heritage  has  produced

many  sorcerers  as  well.  Likewise,  the  strong  influence  of  Cal-

ishite  and  Netherese  cultural  traditions  has  echoes  in  the  large

numbers of Tethyrian wizards, although most learn their craft

through  a  traditional  master-apprentice  relationship,  not  by

attending a formal school.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

While their numbers are small in total, both incantatrixes and

shadow  adepts  form  a  proportionately  larger  fraction  of  the

Tethyrian spellcaster population than in any other human ethnic

group. The clash of competing cultures and faiths has given rise

to  a  large  number  of  clerics  among  the  Tethyrian  population,

and the absence of large kingdoms has permitted both druids and

rangers to flourish.

Spellcasting  Tradition:  Tethyrians  favor  spells  that  shield

them against mind-affecting spells, enable one to escape impris-

onment, and facilitate travel, including find the path, freedom

of movement, Leomunds tiny hut, nondetection, and whispering

wind.  The  burgeoning  reliance  on  the  Shadow  Weave  across

Faern is reminiscent of a Tethyrian tradition called Talfirian

magic,  dating  back  to  the  reign  of  Verraketh  Talember  the

Shadowking. Talfirian songs (see the appendix) are still known

to Tethyrian bards.

Unique Spells: Many commonly employed arcane and divine

spells were created by Tethyrians, although such achievements

are often attributed to other cultures. One spell still little known

outside the Tethyrian population is Verrakeths shadow crown

(see the appendix).

TETHYRIAN MAGIC ITEMS

Tethyrians favor magic items that facilitate survival when trav-

eling,  allow  discreet  movement,  shield  against  divinations  and

enchantments,  and  enable  one  to  escape  from  captors.  Edged

weapons are commonly crafted with flaming, keen, and throwing

special abilities, while bludgeoning weapons are often given dis-

ruption,  ghost  touch,  and  holy  special  abilities,  reflecting  the

ever-present dangers of trolls and the undead hordes that issue

forth from countless battlefields in Tethyrian-held lands. Armor

is typically crafted with ghost touch, shadow, and silent moves

special  abilities,  again  reflecting  the  omnipresent  threat  of

undead as well as the long history of Tethyrians employing guer-

rilla tactics against invading armies.

Common  Magic  Items:  Hats  of  disguise,  horseshoes  of  speed,

Murlynds  spoons,  rings  of  mind  shielding, and  vests  of  escape.

These  items  are  prevalent  in  Tethyrian  lands  and  can  be  pur-

chased at a 10% discount in any large city in Tethyr, Amn, or

the Western Heartlands.

Iconic Magic Items: As Tethyrians have tended to co-opt the

magical devices of other cultures rather than invent their own,

there are few magic items unique to Tethyrian culture that are

not  of  Calishite,  Chondathan,  Illuskan,  or  Netherese  origin.

Those that do exist tend to be variations in form of well-known

items  such  as  those  listed  above.  Perhaps  the  most  uniquely

Tethyrian  magic  item  is  the  figurine  of  wondrous  power  (blue

quartz  eagle), much  favored  by  Tethyrian  caravanners  and

Tethyrian bandits alike (see the appendix).

Tethyrian Deities

The melting pot nature of Tethyrian culture has ensured that

most deities of the Faernian pantheon are venerated in Tethyr-

ian-occupied lands. Tempus is believed to have been a Talfirian

deity  who  defeated  the  Netherese  god  Targus  (Garagos).

Netherese refugees brought with them the faith of Amaunator

(reborn  as  Lathander),  Chauntea,  Talos,  Mystryl  (reborn  as

Mystra), Selne, and Shar. Illuskan invaders introduced worship

of Auril, Mielikki, and Oghma. Calishite armies introduced the

faiths of Ilmater and Tyr. Chondathan merchants carried with

them  the  teachings  of  Deneir,  Helm,  and  Waukeen.  Newer

deities  have  arisen  and  been  adopted  as  well,  including  Cyric,

Kelemvor, and Siamorphe. Other deities that enjoy large Tethyr-

ian followings include Eldath, Milil, Shaundakul, and Torm. Six

of  the  most  prominent  churches  in  Tethyrian-occupied  lands

include the faiths of Cyric, Helm, Ilmater, Kelemvor, Oghma,

and Siamorphe.

Siamorphe is originally a Tethyrian goddess, worshiped prima-

rily  in  Waterdeep,  Baldurs  Gate,  and  Tethyr.  Her  church  has

waxed and waned in centuries past as waves of idealism and cyn-

icism have swept the nobility, but Siamorphe is currently ascen-

dant. The church of the Divine Right is most popular among the

104

HUMANS

nobility, although Siamorphe is also seen as a guarantor of

just rule by many commoners.

Relations with

Other Races

Tethyrians  hold  the  Proud  Peoples

(elves  and  dwarves)  in  high  esteem,

bordering on reverence, for Tethyrian

folklore  contains  stories  harkening

back  to  the  age  when  their  ancestors

dwelt in the shadow of the great dwarven

and  elven  empires.  In  Tethyr,  however,

where  elves  and  Tethyrians  still  come

into  regular  contact,  the  Fair  Folk  are

regarded  with  a  fair  degree  of  suspicion

and hostility. Tethyrians get along well

with  halflings,  reflecting  the  large

number of Small Folk who dwell in

Tethyrian-occupied lands and their

shared  history  of  migrating

northwards  along  the  Sword

Coast  to  escape  the  grasping

reach of Calimshan.

Tethyrians  are  indifferent

with  respect  to  gnomes,  paying

the  Forgotten  Folk  little  heed,

even though they dwell in Tethyr-

ian-held  lands  in  relatively  large

numbers.  Tethyrian  reactions  to

tieflings  and  half-orcs  are  sharply

split.  Those  Tethyrians  who  dwell

north of the Cloud Peaks and have had

to battle innumerable hordes and the

devilspawn  of  Dragonspear  Castle

despise  those  with  monstrous  blood

running  in  their  veins,  while  southern

Tethyrians view them in sympathy with

the  Calishite  perspective  as  simply

members of the lower class. Genasai are

regarded  with  suspicion,  seen  as  little

better  than  the  genie-worshiping  Cal-

ishites, but aasimar are often mistaken for

elves or half-elves.

Among  human  cultures,  Tethyrians  view

Illuskans as overly warlike and Chondathans as

overly greedy, but they usually get along well

with members of both ethnic groups if they

live  in  close  proximity.  The  Mulan  are

despised as slavers, although that sobriquet is

more  properly  reserved  for  Thayans.  True

hatred  is  reserved  for  Calishites,  an  enmity  bred

from familiarity and the product of centuries

of discrimination against and enslavement

of the various Tethyrian tribes.

Other  cultures  are  largely

unknown  in  Tethyrian-held

lands,  but  human  immigrants,

no matter how exotic, are usually

welcomed  and  then  assimilated

within a generation or two.

Tethyrian Equipment

Through centuries of assimilation, Tethyrians have

adopted the best arms, armor, and

other equipment of other cultures.

As such, the equipment lists found

in  the  Players  Handbook can  be

seen  as  reflecting  the  Tethyrian

norm. Regional variations do exist,

with  Tethyrians  of  the  South

favoring  Calishite  arms,  armor,

and equipment, Tethyrians of the

North being partial to Illuskan equip-

ment,  and  Tethyrians  dwelling  along

the  western  shores  of  the  Sea  of

Fallen  Stars  following  the  lead  of

Chondathan culture.

ARMS AND ARMOR

Despite  adapting  to  local  con-

ditions,  Tethyrians  do  share

some  preferences.  Favored

weapons include blades of any

sort  (the  bigger,  the  better

thats  why  they  call  it  the

Sword  Coast),  lances,  maces,

and shortbows (adopted from the

Calishites, who adopted them from

the  elves).  Tethyrians  wear  the

heaviest  armor  practical  for  a  task,

which  can  range  from  chain  shirts

and  bucklers  to  spiked  full  plate

and  a  large  steel  shield.  Moreso

than most human cultures, Tethyri-

ans have a strong knightly tradition,

and the typical Tethyrian soldier is a

mounted one.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Tethyrians  are  partial  to  canines,  par-

ticularly those bred for herding, hunt-

ing, or working. Falcons (treat as hawks)

and swamp ferrets (treat as weasels)

are  commonly  employed  in  hunting

and often serve as familiars. Ravens

are also favored as pets or familiars,

particularly  in  the  vicinity  of  the

High Moor.

Horses are especially prized by Tethyr-

ians  as  steeds  and  draft  animals;

when  they  go  to  war,  the

mounts are as heavily armored

as  the  soldiers.  Flying  steeds,

particularly  griffons,  hip-

pogriffs,  and  pegasi,  are

highly  prized  as  well,  and

are  often  available  for  sale

in Irieabor.

HUMANS

Other Human

Ethnic Groups

Faern is home to dozens of distinct nationalities and ethnici-

ties  beyond  the  so-called  major  human  ethnic  groups.  Many

more peoples have vanished into the mists of time, remembered

only by a few scattered ruins, musty scrolls filled with indeci-

pherable writings, or perhaps the legacy of an arcane spell or

some forgotten god.

Human, Bedine

The  Bedine  are  nomads  of  Anauroch  who  migrated  from

Zakhara via a portal shortly after the fall of Netheril in 339

DR  and  intermingled  with  a  handful  of  Netherese  survivors.

The  Bedine  retained  the  spoken  language  of  their  ancestors,

Midani, but lost all knowledge of the written word. Centuries

later, traders from the surrounding lands sought them out and

introduced the alphabet of Thorass. The Bedine adopted the gods

of the Netherese and continue to venerate Atar (Amaunator, a

dead  Netherese  deity  reborn  as  Lathander),  Elah  (Selne),

Kozah  (Talos),  Nasr  (some  say  Cyric,  some  say  Kelemvor),

Shaundakul (actually Beshaba), and many little gods as well. The

Bedine  are  found  primarily  in  the  southern,  sandy  reaches  of

Anauroch known as the Sword.

Human, Chultan

The Jungles of Chult are home to tall, ebony-skinned humans

who  migrated  north  to  the  Chultan  peninsula  millennia  ago

from a great island in the southern seas of Abeir-Toril southeast

of Maztica and southwest of Zakhara. Two millennia ago, there

were  many  tribes  in  Chult,  although  the  Chultans  and  the

Eshowe were the most powerful and influential. A bloody war

raged between the Chultans and the Eshowe from 1800 years

ago to 1500 years ago, ending only after the latter group was

wiped out. The Eshowe were destroyed after unleashing a great

evil known as the Shadow Giant on their enemies, only to see it

turn on them after being repulsed by the Chultan defenders. In

the centuries that followed, unchecked by any rivals, the Chul-

tans assimilated most of the remaining tribes of the peninsula

into a single Chultan culture, sharing a common language and

somewhat uniform social structure.

Chultans, who speak Chultan, adopted the Draconic alphabet

before the founding of Mezro and spread it to the other Chul-

tan tribes. The primary god of the Chultans is Ubtao, who is said

to have brought their ancestors to the peninsula they now call

home thousands of years ago and to have founded the great city

of Mezro in 2637 DR. The remnants of the Eshowe venerate

Eshowdow, a dark shadow of Ubtao subverted by Shar.

Human, Durpari

The Durpari are the relatively short, dark-skinned inhabitants of

Durpar, Estagund, Veldorn, and Var the Golden. The Durpari

have dwelt along the shores of the Golden Water since before

the rise of the Imaskari empire. The fall of Imaskar precipitated

the  fall  of  the  Durpari  kingdoms  and  two  millennia  of  bar-

barism.  During  this  period,  the  Mulan  of  Mulhorand  often

slaughtered or enslaved the Durpari tribes. In 623 DR, the first

Durpari  kingdoms  after  the  fall  of  Imaskar  arose  along  the

shores of the Golden Water, as Mulan influence over the region

ebbed  in  the  face  of  the  burgeoning  threat  from  Narfell  and

Raumathar. With the exception of Estagund, which was briefly

conquered by the armies of Dambrath during the reign of Rein-

har I in 551 DR, the Durpari have remained independent ever

since, trading among themselves and with their neighbors.

The  Durpari  speak  a  language  of  the  same  namederived

from  a  mixture  of  Draconic,  Mulhorandi,  and  Rauricand

employ the Thorass alphabet brought back from the west. The

Durpari venerate a small pantheon of deities known collectively

as  the  Adama,  and  thought  to  include  Selne,  Oghma,  Gond,

Torm, and Waukeen.

Human, Ffolk

The native inhabitants of the Moonshae Isles call themselves the

Ffolk, although only faint vestiges of the original human tribes

who bore that name still remain. Today, the Ffolk are essentially

an isolated group of Tethyrians, descended from a large wave of

immigration from the Western Heartlands in 467 DR. The orig-

inal Ffolk had already conceded the northern Moonshae isles to

the Illuskans centuries before the arrival of the Tethyrians, yet

the Illuskans are still considered the invaders by the Ffolk.

Unlike  their  mainland  cousins,  the  Tethyrian  Ffolk  speak

Illuskan, but they still employ the Thorass script. They are gov-

erned by a strong druidical tradition.

Human, Gur

The Gurs, also known as Selnes Children or the people of

the highway, are the nomads of the Western Heartlands. Most

Gurs  are  members  of  extended  family  groups  that  travel

together from settlement to settlement in motley caravans sell-

ing cheap cast-offs and working odd jobs. Others have settled in

the poorest quarters of cities such as Baldurs Gate, Elturel, and

Irieabor, where they struggle to survive in the face of ancient

prejudices. Among those few scholars who have studied their cul-

ture, the Gurs are thought to be primarily of Rashemi descent.

Although  they  have  certainly  intermingled  with  members  of

other  ethnic  groups,  they  strongly  resemble  the  natives  of

Rashemen. As fragments of lore dating back to the erection of

the Standing Stone refer to the nomadic Gurs, it is thought that

they fled their ancient homeland during or immediately after

the cataclysmic battle between Raumathar and Narfell.

Speakers of an ancient dialect of Rashemi among themselves,

the honor-obsessed Gurs employ the Thorass alphabet and speak

Chondathan  with  non-Gurs.  Many  of  Selnes  Children  are

unusually gifted oracles and find employment as soothsayers and

diviners. In addition to the goddess of the moon, many prophet-

ically inclined Gurs venerate Savras. Their secretive faith may

in  large  part  account  for  the  continued  survival  of  his  faith

during his many years of imprisonment.

Human, Halruaan

During the fall of the ancient empire of Netheril, most of the

lands inhabitants fled west from the spells of the phaerimm,

106

HUMANS

settling the North. But some of Netherils folk, led by the arch-

wizard Raumark, fled far to the south by means of great flying

ships.  Raumarks  followers  settled  the  sheltered  basin  of  Hal-

ruaa, intermingling with the small population of native Tasha-

lans in the region. There they founded the wizard-ruled realm of

Halruaa, determined not to repeat the mistakes of their ances-

tors. Traces of Netherese culture are strong in Halruaa, includ-

ing  the  Draconic  alphabet  once  employed  by  speakers  of

Netherese and Loross. The Halruaan tongue is simply a modern

dialect of ancient Netherese. However, worship of the Netherese

pantheon has gradually evolved into the veneration of deities

such as Mystra and Azuth, to a much lesser extent Savras, and,

recently, Velsharoon.

Early  in  Halruaas  history,  a  small  band  of  dissidents  who

venerated Leira, goddess of illusions, migrated westward to the

distant island of Nimbral. Although the two realms share a love

of magic and the Halruaan tongue, interactions between the two

peoples are few and far between. The church of Leira was the

state religion of Nimbral before the Time of Troubles, but the

current  state  of  religious  worship  in  the  Land  of  the  Flying

Hunt is unknown.

Human, Imaskari

The  Imaskari  are  the  legendary  inhabitants  of  the  lands  now

swallowed  by  the  Raurin  Desert  and  the  Plains  of  the  Purple

Dust.  Vilified  by  the  Mulan,  the  artificers  of  Imaskar  were

mighty wizards who built great portals to other worlds in order

to carry off thousands of slaves from distant planes. Little is

known  of  the  Imaskari,  except  what  the  Mulan  chose  to  pre-

serve  of  their  ancient  masters.  At  one  point  the  Imaskari

Empire held sway from the Endless Wastes to the Golden Water

and from the Alamber Sea to the very frontiers of Kara-Tur.

Ruins of tremendous antiquity in the Plains of Purple Dust may

be the remains of Imaskari cities.

The Imaskari spoke Roushoum, a precursor of such varied

tongues as Durpari, the Rauric family (Chessentan, Mulhorani,

and Untheric), Raumvira, and the various Tuigan dialects. The

Imaskari  alphabet  has  wholly  fallen  out  of  use,  and  is  only

found  inscribed  on  a  few  ancient  artifacts  and  the  walls  of

Imaskari ruins.

Human, Lantanna

The Lantanna inhabit the isles of Lantan, Suj, and Orlil off the

northwest coast of the Chultan peninsula. Known for their large

green eyes, copper hair, and parchment-colored skin, the Lan-

tanna  are  rarely  encountered  outside  their  native  isles  except

aboard  merchant  ships.  They  trade  along  the  shores  of  the

Trackless Sea as far north as Neverwinter, the Shining Sea as far

east as Lapaliiya, and the Great Sea as far east as Halruaa. The

homeland of most Lantanna is the nation of Lantan, named for

the largest island it claims.

Speakers of Lantanese, the Lantanna employ the Draconic

alphabet used by most cultures descended from Netheril. As the

Lantanna  are  not  believed  to  be  in  any  way  descended  from

ancient Netheril, some scholars suspect that early Halruaan or

Nimbrali traders introduced this alphabet to the Lantanna. The

state religion of Lantan is the faith of Gond, and many believe

that  the  Lantanna  introduced  the  Wondermaker  into  the

Faernian pantheon.

Human, Maztican

Maztica is a far-off land that lies west of Faern, beyond even

fabled  Evermeet.  Tethyrian  explorers  from  Amn  discovered

Maztica just over a decade ago, and Maztican immigrants are

now found in very small numbers in Amn, Baldurs Gate, and

Waterdeep. Faernians lump all inhabitants of Maztica into one

group, but in truth there are seven known human ethnicities in

that  land:  the  Azuposi,  the  Dog  People,  the  Green  Folk,  the

Metahel, the Nahopaca, the Nexalans, and the Payits.

The Nexalans are the only group to have journeyed east to

Faern, so all Faern-dwelling Mazticans are speakers of Nex-

alan, the language of the nations of Pezelac, Huacli, Kultaka,

and Nexal. The Nexalan tongue is written using the Draconic

alphabet. Nexalans are relatively tall, with long, lean physiques

and  beardless,  angular  faces.  Nexalans  are  generally  reddish-

bronze of hue.

Human, Nar

Descended  from  the  survivors  of  Narfells  cataclysmic

destruction,  the  Nars  consist  of  twenty  or  more  nomadic

tribes  that  inhabit  the  dry  grasslands  east  of  the  Giantspire

Mountains and north of the Rawlinswood. Further details of

their history may be found in the descriptions of the Damarans

and the Rashemi.

Nars are short and stocky, with darkly tanned skin tones and

straight, raven black hair, usually worn to the shoulders. They are

some of the finest horsemen in Faern, and famed breeders of

the legendary Nar heavy horse. Although they once spoke Nar-

felli, a forgotten tongue strongly influenced by Abyssal, the Nars

now speak the Damaran tongue common to lands near the East-

ing Reach as well as a smattering of Common. As most Nars can

be considered barbarians, few can read or write, but those that do

employ the Dethek runes adopted by speakers of Damaran.

Human, Netherese

Perhaps the best-known and most influential of the humans who

built  Faerns  ancient  civilizations  were  the  Netherese  of

ancient Netheril. Netheril was founded in 3859 DR by dark-

haired, fair-skinned humans who dwelt along the shores of the

Narrow  Sea,  a  body  of  water  now  lost  beneath  the  sands  of

Anauroch. At its height, Netheril encompassed all the lands now

buried beneath Anauroch, with colonies stretching westward to

the Trackless Sea, and floating cities high above distant lands.

The cities of the Narrow Sea came to be known as Low Netheril,

while  the  civilization  of  the  clouds  was  known  as  High

Netheril, famous for magic of surpassing power.

Although all Netherese used the Draconic alphabet, the lan-

guage of Low Netheril, and the commoners of High Netheril

was Netherese, while the nobles of High Netheril spoke Loross.

Both groups venerated the same pantheon, which included gods

such  as  Amaunator  (Lathander),  Jannath  (Chauntea),  Jergal,

Kozah (Talos), Moander, Mystryl (Mystra), Selne, Shar, and

Targus (Garagos). The clergy were far more influential in Low

Netheril than in the arcanists soaring cities.

High  Netheril  collapsed  after  Karsus  destroyed  Mystra  in

339 DR, and all but four of High Netherils ancient floating

cities  were  destroyed.  Three  of  thoseAnauria,  Asram,  and

107

HUMANS

Hlondathwere  saved  by  the  influence  of  Mystra  and  landed

safely just west of what are now known as the Desertsedge Moun-

tains,  where  they  founded  surface  realms  of  the  same  names.

Asram fell victim to a plague spread by the goddess Talona in

33 DR. Anauria fell to an orc horde in 111 DR, and Hlondath

was consumed by the sands of Anauroch and abandoned in 329

DR.  Inhabitants  of  these  eastern  Netherese  survivor  states

eventually migrated south into Cormyr and east into the Moon-

sea region. Their descendants were largely absorbed into the bur-

geoning Chondathan culture of the eastern Heartlands and are

now accounted as northern Chondathans or Vaasans.

The fall of Low Netheril had less to do with Karsuss Folly

and more to do with the ever-encroaching lifedrain spells of the

phaerimm.  As  the  pace  of  desertification  increased,  starting

around 461 DR, most of the inhabitants of Low Netheril grad-

ually  migrated  westward.  Most  scholars  divide  the  westward-

bound Netherese migrants into two groups. The southwestern

group founded realms in the river valleys of the Winding Water

and the River Chionthar, while the northwestern branch formed

isolated city-states scattered across the Savage Frontier. Little

evidence of Netherese culture remains among the descendants of

either  branch,  for  both  groups  were  later  subsumed  by  immi-

grants from across the sea to the west (the Illuskans) or by the

native tribes of the region (the Tethyrians).

Four small groups of pureblooded Netherese are believed to

survive in the present day. The Marsh Drovers of the Farsea

Marshes  are  thought  to  be  descendants  of  Anauria  who  were

never absorbed by the Chondathan inhabitants of Cormyr. The

Tunlar barbarians of the Plains of Tun are believed to be descen-

dants  of  the  Rengarth  barbarians  (cousins  of  the  Low

Netherese) of southern Netheril. The nomadic barbarians of the

Ride north of the Moonsea are believed to be descendants of the

Angardt  barbarians  of  northern  Netheril  (also  cousins  of  the

Low  Netherese).  Finally,  the  fourth  floating  city  of  High

Netheril, known as Shade, survived the fall of Netheril by van-

ishing into the Plane of Shadow. Shade reappeared in 1372 DR,

after generations of warfare with the malaugrym in the shadow-

plane. Shade now rests on the northern shore of the Shadow Sea,

which was once the Shoal of Thirst.

Human, Raumviran

Descended  from  the  inhabitants  of  the  great  empire  of  Rau-

mathar,  the  Raumvirans  retain  little  of  their  former  glory.

Their  history  is  described  under  the  Damaran  and  Rashemi

ethnic groups.

In the present day, Raumvirans are concentrated along the

shores of the Lake of Mists and the city of Almorel. Physically,

Raumvirans bear a close resemblance to the Rashemi, indicative

of centuries of close ties between the two groups. Although taller

on  average  than  their  western  neighbors,  the  Raumvirans  are

also generally stout and muscular, with dark eyes and thick black

hair. Raumvirans are generally of lighter hue than the Rashemi,

evidence  of  significant  Sossrim  heritage  dating  back  to  the

height of their long-fallen empire.

Members  of  this  ethnic  group  speak  Raumvira,  a  tongue

closely related to Rashemi, Dwarven, and a northern dialect of

Imaskari.  Raumvirans  employ  an  alphabet  of  Dethek  runes

taught to them before the founding of Raumathar by the Sire-

mun dwarves of the Firepeaks, a range of mountains to the east

of the Lake of Mists.

Human, Shaaran

The grasslands of the Shaar are home to nomadic tribes of long-

faced, yellow-skinned humans. Conquered by the armies of Cal-

imshan at the height of the Shoon Empire, the Shaarans of the

eastern  grasslands  reverted  to  their  nomadic  ways  once  the

Shoon Empire collapsed, while those who dwelt along the shores

of the Shining Sea and the Lake of Steam settled in cities and

founded such realms as Lapaliiya and the ever-changing Border

Kingdoms. Today, Shaarans are found as far west as Calimshan

and  as  far  north  as  the  Vilhon  Reach.  The  inhabitants  of

Sespech  are  largely  of  Shaaran  descent,  having  been  brought

north to serve in Jhaamdaths armies centuries ago.

Speakers  of  Shaaran  employ  an  alphabet  of  Dethek  runes,

adopted from the gold dwarf traders of the Great Rift before the

rise of the Shoon Empire. If there ever was a Shaaran pantheon,

it was long ago subsumed by the more powerful Jhamdaathan and

Calishite cultures. Little record exists of Shaaran culture before it

was assimilated by its more powerful neighbors, for the Shaarans

have long maintained a nomadic way of life and an oral history.

Human, Shou

The Shou are but one of many human ethnic groups in far-off

Kara-Tur,  albeit  the  most  numerous  and  powerful.  Similar  in

appearance to the Tuigan, they are yellowish-bronze in hue, with

black  hair  and  broad,  flat  features.  At  its  height,  the  Shou

empire extended as far west as the eastern shore of Brightstar

Lake.  Today,  Shou  traders  are  rarely  seen  west  of  Semphar,

although their emperor has recently established an embassy in

Elversult and made use of a ship-size portal that opens some-

where on the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Shou worship a pantheon

of  deities  known  as  the  Celestial  Bureaucracy  and  employ  the

Draconic alphabet to represent the Shou language.

Human, Sossrim

The Sossrims are the inhabitants of distant Sossal, a frozen land

that lies between the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. With

skin as pallid as snow and hair with the fine, silver tint of an

icicle, the Sossrims have completely adapted to their arctic envi-

ronment.  Sossrims  speak  Damaran  and  use  the  Dethek  runes.

They are believed to venerate the gods of the Faernian pan-

theon,  although  the  worship  of  a  relatively  benign  aspect  of

Auril seems to be predominant.

During the Orcgate Wars, the Sossrims fought in the armies

of Mulhorand alongside the Raumvirans and the Rashemi. After

the followers of Gruumsh were defeated, the Sossrims retreated

to  their  northern  lands,  where  they  established  the  isolated

kingdom of Sossal. The Sossrims briefly fell under the sway of

Raumathar at the height of that empire, but they have other-

wise retained their independence. Before the retreat of the Great

Glacier,  Sossrim  traders  were  seen  as  far  south  as  northern

Impiltur,  but  now  they  rarely  venture  beyond  Vaasa  or  the

northern reaches of Damara, Narfell, and Rashemen.

Human, Talfir

Elven writings dating back to the Crown Wars mention a dark-

haired, fair-skinned human tribe in the heart of the great forest

108

HUMANS

of Shantel Othreier. The Talfir were the original human inhab-

itants of the Chionthar river valley in the Western Heartlands.

Speakers of Talfiric, a long-lost human tongue based on the Dra-

conic alphabet, the Talfir gradually disappeared over a thousand

years  ago,  their  culture  overwhelmed  by  refugees  from  Low

Netheril, Calishite settlers from the south, and Chondathan set-

tlers from the Dragon Coast. Several deities of the Faernian

pantheon are believed to have first been worshiped by the Talfir,

including Tempus, who vanquished the Netherese god of war.

The Talfir left little in the way of ruins or artifacts, although

Irieabor lies atop the ancient crypt of the Talfir monarch known

as Verraketh the Shadowking, who mastered shadow magic. Talis,

a ruined city of the Talfir, lies in ruins along the banks of the

River Reaching in the depths of the Reaching Woods.

Human, Tashalan

Uncounted  thousands  of  years  ago,  the  human  tribes  of  the

Chultan peninsula, now known as the Tashalans, were enslaved

by the saurian Creator Race. As with all things, the saurian civ-

ilization eventually collapsed and their human slaves won their

freedom. However, many members of this black-haired, olive-

skinned  race  took  to  venerating  the  snakes  they  once  served,

leading to the rise of the yuan-ti. Others, however, turned away

from their dark masters, seeking to forge their own realms on

the peninsula between the Shining Sea and the Great Sea.

Today Tashalan culture is largely confined to the middle of

the Chultan peninsula and the isle of Tharsult. Over the cen-

turies the Chultan tribes drove the Tashalans out of the Jungles

of Chult, the Halruaans and Dambrathan drow assimilated the

native Tashalan cultures of those lands, and the yuan-ti enslaved

those Tashalans who contested their control of the Mhair and

Black  Jungles.  Most  Tashalans  are  natives  of  Tashalar  or  the

realms of Samarach, Thindol, or Tharsult. Tashalan traders may

be found in Calimshan, cities on the shore of the Lake of Steam,

and Lapaliiya, as well as Halruaa, Dambrath, and Luiren.

Tashalans speak Tashalan and employ the Dethek alphabet. They

venerate both the Faernian pantheon and the gods of the yuan-ti,

with the followers of Talona and Savras being most prominent.

Human, Tuigan

The nomadic tribes of the Endless Wastes and the Quoya Desert

are  known  as  the  Tuigan,  although  that  name  is  actually  the

name of but one of fifteen major tribes who wander the waste-

land between Faern and Kara-Tur. Closely related to the inhab-

itants of Kara-Tur, tribal members are yellowish-bronze in hue,

with black hair and broad, flat features. Each tribe has its own

dialect, derived in varying degrees from the old empires of Shou,

Raumvira, and Imaskari, each of which conquered or extended

its influence over the Endless Wastes at its height. The tribes of

the  Endless  Wastes  adopted  the  alphabet  of  Thorass  from

traders  passing  eastwards  along  the  Golden  Way  to  Kara-Tur

long ago. The tribes are believed to worship Akadi, the elemen-

tal deity of air, and Grumbar, the elemental deity of earth, as

well as several beast totems (Horse and Tiger).

Since the defeat of the great Tuigan horde in 1360 DR, mem-

bers of the Tuigan tribe have been found in small numbers in

western lands such as Semphar, Thay, Thesk, Narfell, and Rashe-

men. It is this group of immigrants who are best known to the

inhabitants of Faern.

Human, Turami

After their gods precipitated the fall of the Imaskari Empire in

2488 DR, the slave-race known as the Mulan migrated west-

ward to the shores of the Alamber Sea. This migration in turn

displaced the native Turami, who were driven westward along

the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars until they reached

the coastal basin now known as Turmish. Generally tall and mus-

cular, with dark mahogany skin, flat faces, and curly hair, the

Turami are the primary inhabitants of Turmish, although they

form minority populations in Chessenta, Unther, and Mulho-

rand as well.

Speakers of Turmic, the Turami adopted the Thorass alpha-

bet from Calishite and Chondathan traders. No historical evi-

dence  exists  suggesting  the  existence  of  a  Turami  pantheon

distinct  from  the  Faernian  pantheon  commonly  venerated

today, although that does not mean that one did not exist. Tur-

mish, the homeland of most Turami, dates back to the founding

of Alaghn in 37 DR.

Human, Ulutiun

Although the Ulutiuns have long inhabited the polar reaches of

Faern, these short, dark-haired, broad-faced humans with light-

brown skin are actually migrants from the northern reaches of

Kara-Tur who moved westward across the polar icecap millen-

nia ago. Speakers of Uluik, a tongue that only in recent centuries

acquired a written form based on the Thorass alphabet, the Ulu-

tiuns are divided into two major groups.

The Sea of Moving Ice, the Ice Peak, and the Cold Run (as

the icy reaches of the northernmost Sword Coast are sometimes

known) are home to the Ice Hunters, the westernmost group of

Ulutiuns. Believed to predate the arrival of both the Netherese

and the Illuskans, the Ice Hunters venerate nature spirits and

are  led  by  shamans,  not  unlike  the  more  warlike  Uthgardt

tribes and the barbarians of Icewind Dale. In the east, the Great

Glacier is home to the majority of Ulutiuns, including the Iulu-

tiuns, the Angulutiuns, and the Nakulutiuns. They favor hide

armor and weapons such as battleaxes, garnoks, hand axes, har-

poons, iuaks, light picks, nets, ritiiks, shortbows, throwing axes,

and tridents.

Human, Vaasan

Vaasans are the descendants of two waves of humanity who set-

tled the Moonsea region. Refugees from the Netherese survivor

states  of  Asram,  Anauria,  and  Hlondath  fled  east  toward  the

Moonsea to found realms such as Teshar (which was founded in

87 DR and fell in 479 DR) Ylash, and Northkeep (which fell

in  400  DR).  In  later  centuries  Chondathan  immigrants  from

Sembia, the Dalelands, and the Vast joined the descendants of

these early settlements and established the Moonsea city-states

of  Zhentil  Keep,  Hulburg,  Melvaunt,  Mulmaster,  Phlan,  and

Thentia.  Vaasa  proper  was  settled  from  the  Moonsea  region

after the Great Glacier began its retreat, a couple of hundred

years ago. While this ethnic group is sometimes referred to as

Tesharans, Tharrans, or Yls, the name of the last land they set-

tled has become the name by which they are most commonly

known in other lands.

and Auril receive the bulk of their prayers.

Human, Zakharan

Far to the south and east of Faern, beyond the fabled lands of the

Utter East, is Zakhara, the Land of Fate. Zakhara is considered

a  continent  in  its  own  right,  not  unlike  Faern  or  Kara-Tur,

although  all  three  continents  are  physically  connected.  The

Land of Fate is home to the Zakharans, relatively short, brown-

skinned, dark-haired humans who speak Midani. Zakharans born

in  the  Land  of  Fate  are  rarely  seen  outside  their  homeland,

although  Zakharan  traders  are  not  unknown  in  the  southern-

most reaches of Faern. However, at least two groups of Zakha-

ran humans have migrated to Faern by means of portals and

are found in large numbers in the western lands in the form of

the Bedine and Calishites.

Region and

Ethnicity

Table 71 shows the distribution of the various human ethnic

groups  in  the  lands  and  regions  of  Faern.  Small  numbers  of

widely traveled peoples such as Chondathans or Tethyrians can

show  up  almost  anywhere,  of  course,  but  these  are  the  best

approximations of ethnic distribution across Faern.

Primary ethnicities are peoples who comprise 50% or more of

the population of a given land or region.

Secondary ethnicities are peoples who comprise between 5%

and  49%  of  the  population  of  a  land.  Its  possible  for  several

groups to be secondary populations (in fact, in some lands there

might be nothing but secondary populations if no single group

forms a majority of the population).

Tertiary ethnic groups are peoples who comprise less than 5%

of the lands population.

Primary  Language is  the  language  spoken  by  the  primary

human ethnicity in that land or region.

Alphabet is the alphabet of the primary language.

Part mortal, part something else, the planetouched are

loners  and  individuals,  rarely  so  lucky  as  to  meet

another of their kind. The origins of the various kinds

of planetouched races are as different as the forms of the plane-

touched  themselves.  In  Calimshan,  djinn  and  efreet  sometimes

mated with their human slaves, producing offspring whose chil-

dren are air or fire genasi. In Mulhorand and Unther, the undy-

ing incarnations of the deities had children with favored humans,

creating strains of aasimar and tieflings. In the High Forest, evil

sun  elves  bred  with  succubi  to  produce  the  feyri.  The  plane-

touched races have no common history, although planetouched

of  the  same  type  from  the  same  region  often  have  a  common

ancestor or relation.

The child of an outsider and another creature is a half-fiend,

half-celestial,  or  half-elemental.  If  one  of  these  half-blooded

creatures has offspring with a humanoid, the result is usually

a planetouched creature. The offspring of two planetouched is

always a planetouched. Mixed-heritage planetouched of this sort

take  after  one  or  the  other  parent  (seemingly  equal  chances)

but carry the traits of the other parent, which may show up in

their  own  children.  The  offspring  of  a  planetouched  and  a

normal creature of its type (such as the child of a feyri and an

elf) has an equal chance of being planetouched or normal, but

carries the potential for planetouched children in either case.

Sometimes the outsider bloodline becomes dormant for one or

more generations, only to manifest many years later.

This section discusses the eight major types of planetouched

in Faern and what features they share, introducing a few new

kinds that are even more rare than the common types.

Aasimar

Regions: Mulhorand, Unther, Chessenta.

Racial  Feats: Celestial  Bloodline,  Eyes  of  Light,  Improved

Energy  Resistance,  Light  to  Daylight,  Planetouched  Animal

Affinity, Outsider Wings.

Level Adjustment: +1.

The aasimar bear the legacy of a celestial being or even a deity

in their ancestry, and have incredible potential to do good in the

world. At the same time, their heritage marks them as different

and often leads to persecution, ridicule, or exile from supersti-

tious or backward communities. It is not unknown for an aasi-

mar to give in to bitterness in the face of adversity and turn

to evil.

Aasimar are the descendants of humans and some good out-

sider, such as a true celestial, a celestial creature, couatl, lillend,

or even a servant or avatar of a good deity. (Some of these crea-

tures must use magic to assume a form that is compatible with

a  human  mate,  of  course.)  While  elves,  dwarves,  gnomes,  and

halflings with good outsider ancestry are reputed to exist, those

crossbreeds are not true aasimar.

Aasimar  look  human  except  for  one  distinguishing  feature

related to their unusual ancestor. Some examples of these fea-

tures (and the ancestors that cause them) are:

golden eyes

silver hair

emerald skin (planetar)

feathers at the shoulder (astral deva, avoral celestial, planetar,

solar, trumpet archon)

feathers in hair (avoral celestial)

pearly opalescent eyes (ghaele celestial)

powerful ringing voice (lillend, trumpet archon)

brilliant topaz eyes (solar)

silvery or golden skin (solar)

iridescent scales in small patches (couatl or lillend)

Aasimar understand that they are special, even if they do not

understand  their  true  heritage.  Many  aasimar  from  a  latent

bloodline dont even know what creature engendered the line in

the first place. Two aasimar from the same bloodline often have

the same distinguishing feature.

Aasimar have the same life expectancy and age categories as

a human.

History

Most aasimar in Faern are derived from the deities of Mul-

horand. When the mortal incarnations of the Mulhorandi pan-

theon  defeated  the  Imaskari  (see  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting, page 185), they settled and took mortals as

lovers and spouses. The half-celestial offspring of

these unions became nobles of that country,

and  dilution  of  the  divine  essence  through

marriages  to  pureblooded  humans  created

aasimar.  Many  of  these  aasimar  left  the

country in search of a destiny not tied to

their  grandparents,  and  so  the  lands

around  Mulhorand  have  more  aasimar

than any other area.

Outlook

Most  aasimar  are  wary  of  their

human neighbors. Even those raised

by  parents  who  understand  their

heritage cannot escape the stares of

other  children  and  adults,  for

humans  fear  that  which  is  differ-

ent.  Aasimar  usually  experience  a

great  deal  of  prejudice,  which  is  all

the  more  painful  to  the  good-

inclined aasimar who truly wants to

help  others  survive  in  a  hostile

world.  Aasimar  are  often  seen  as

aloof, when in many cases this is a

protective measure born of years

of misunderstandings. Aasimar often

look upon true celestials and other

good outsiders with a mixed envy

and  respect.  The  lucky  ones  receive

occasional  guidance  and  advice  from

their  celestial  ancestor,  and  these  aasimar  are  more  likely  to

exemplify the stereotypical celestial virtues.

AASIMAR CHARACTERS

Because they feel the pull of deific power so keenly, aasimar are

often clerics or paladins. Some aasimar bring their otherworldly

sensibilities to the art of music, becoming accomplished bards.

Rarer  still  are  aasimar  who  fall  in  love  with  Faerns  deep

wilderness, becoming druids and rangers.

Favored Class: Paladin. Aasimars very blood compels them to

seek out and oppose evil wherever it may lurk.

Prestige Classes: Divine champions, divine disciples, and hiero-

phants are the most common prestige classes for aasimar.

Aasimar Society

Aasimar  rarely  have  siblings  who  are

other aasimar, for the heredity of the

supernatural is a chancy thing. Because

of  this,  few  aasimar  get  to  know

another  of  their  kind.  On  the  rare

times  they  encounter  another  aasi-

mar,  there  is  a  sort  of  unspoken

understanding between them, and an

aasimar is likely to take another aasi-

mars  side  in  an  argument,  regard-

less of other affiliations, just for a

taste of kinship.

Aasimar, being more rare than

even  half-elves,  have  no  true  soci-

ety  of  their  own.  Few  have  the

opportunity to meet other aasimar or

celestial  beings,  so  they  attempt  to

blend  into  the  culture  of  their  par-

ents.  If  they  had  such  a  thing,  aasi-

mar  would  have  a  lawful  good  or

neutral  good  society,  focusing  on

charitable  works,  helping  the

needy,  and  campaigning  to

eradicate  evil.  In  a  few  rare

places,  aasimar  can  find  true

acceptance and search for news

of  other  aasimar  born  in  other  lands,

hoping  to  make  arrangements  to  have

the child brought to the sanctuary and raised in an environment

where he or she is cherished, not considered strange.

Types of Aasimar

Because  an  aasimars  favored  class  is  paladin,  a  majority  of

them follow that path, at least for a time. The philosophy of the

paladin  class  resonates  in  the  aasimars  hearts,  and  they  are

innately  suited  for  a  career  championing  law  and  good.  Some

aasimar, particularly those descended from a nonlawful outsider,

instead become clerics, since they are naturally wiser and more

charismatic  than  most  humans.  Even  aasimar  who  dont

become  divine  spellcasters  gravitate  toward  divine-related

classes such as the divine champion, for the call of the light is

very strong.

Not all aasimar live up to their potential. An aasimar black-

guard  or  sorcerer  of  evil  is  a  terrible  opponent,  and  deities

such as Shar and Set love to corrupt an aasimar, turning her

into a bitter, angry creature nursing old grudges from unjust

persecution.

Language and Literacy

Aasimar have no cultural language, although those that realize

their heritage usually learn Celestial. An aasimar usually learns

the language of her parents and may pick up other languages

appropriate to her region.

All aasimar are literate, except for barbarians.

Aasimar Magic and Lore

Aasimar  have  no  spells  unique  to  their  race,  but  favor  divine

spells that enhance their innate powers or allow them to blast

evil. Some are lucky enough to learn secret magic from a true

113

PLANETOUCHED

celestial, and guard that knowledge carefully to show that the

celestials faith in them is not unfounded.

AASIMAR MAGIC ITEMS

Aasimar  have  no  particular  racial  magic  items,  but  some  find

ways to acquire weapons common to true celestials, such as magic

greatswords  (used  by  ghaeles,  archons,  planetars,  and  solars)  or

maces of disruption (used by astral devas).

Aasimar Deities

Aasimar have no common racial deity but often worship what-

ever  deity  their  supernatural  ancestor  serves  (or  that  being

itself, if the ancestor is a deity). Because most aasimar in Faern

are descended from Mulhorandi powers, a large number of them

serve those gods. An aasimar born outside the Old Empires, or

whose travels have taken her far from those lands, might take

a like-minded patron appropriate to her new country.

Because several Mulhorandi deities are portrayed with animal

heads or have strong ties to certain animals, aasimar descended

from  these  deities  or  their  supernatural  agents  often  have  an

affinity  for  that  sort  of  animal,  and  sometimes  have  a  faint

resemblance to a creature of that type.

Relations with Other Races

Although aasimar are mostly human, they rarely feel like they

fit in among human society. Instead, they get along best with

other  halfbreedsnamely,  half-elves  and  half-orcsbecause

they  and  aasimar  usually  share  the  same  sort  of  semi-outcast

background.

Dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings are neither embraced

nor shunned by aasimar, for while these races have no history

of persecuting the planetouched, they dont have a reputation

for sheltering them either. Genasi of all types are too alien com-

pared to an aasimar to elicit sympathy or a sense of kinship.

Tieflings  are  the  one  race  that  garners  the  most  suspicion

from an aasimar, for those touched by the holy understand its

calling and therefore can guess what sort of temptation those

with unholy blood must hear.

Aasimar Equipment

Aasimar  have  no  unusual  racial  equipment,  although  in  their

armaments  they  favor  weapons  with  the  holy  or  evil  outsider

bane special abilities.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Because of their lack of a true society, aasimar as a whole dont

raise  any  particular  creature  as  a  pet  more  often  than  any

other kind. Because of their celestial bloodlines, however, they

are more likely to gain the trust and acceptance of a celestial

animal than a true human might. Also, aasimar of Mulhorandi

descent have an affinity with the animal associated with their

divine ancestor.

Air Genasi

Regions: Calimshan.

Racial Feats: Elemental Bloodline, Improved Levitation.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Air genasi are fast and free-willed. Because the traits that iden-

tify an air genasi are subtle, many go unrecognized for what they

are  for  many  years  and  are  sometimes  mistaken  for  sorcerers.

Those  who  are  overtly  different  quickly  learn  to  disguise  their

nature from common folk, at least until they are able to protect

themselves and strike out on their own.

Air  genasi  are  descended  from  outsiders  native  to  the  Ele-

mental  Plane  of  Air  and  humans.  Most  air  genasi  in  Faern

come from bloodlines established over nine thousand years ago

by the djinn who founded what is now Calimshan. A few rare air

genasi derive from djinn summoned in other parts of the world,

and some are said to be born of a line founded by a powerful air

mephit sorcerer who lived on the Great Glacier hundreds of years

ago. The numbers descended from the servants of air deities such

as  Akadi,  Auril,  and  Shaundakul  are  unknown,  but  likely  to  be

very  small.  Legends  tell  of  elves  similar  to  air  genasi,  possibly

descended from followers of the elven goddess Aerdrie Faenya,

but it is likely that these legends are just confused reports of

the avariels.

Air  genasi  look  human  except  for  one  or  two  distinguishing

features  related  to  their  elemental  ancestor.  Some  examples  of

these features are:

light blue skin

pale white skin

white hair

light blue hair

a constant slight breeze in their presence

flesh that is cool to the touch

voice that can be heard over any nonmagical wind

any sudden movement is accompanied by whistling wind

Air genasi revel in their unusual nature, although few ever try to

locate the being who founded their bloodline, since most are long

dead or banished back the Elemental Plane of Air. Because the

Calimshan  djinn  bloodlines  are  so  old  and  have  suffered  many

crossbreedings, it is almost impossible to tell by normal means if

two air genasi are from the same bloodline. As a result, all air

genasi treat each other as cousins, although in an arrogant and

competitive way.

Air genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as

a human.

History

With  only  a  few  exceptions,  air  genasi  native  to  Faern  are

descended from the djinn who once ruled Calimshan. The djinn

and  djinn  nobles  often  had  human  concubines,  and  from  these

unions  were  born  half-elementals.  The  half-elementals  gained

status  by  serving  in  the  djinns  armies,  and  their  own  children

inherited some of their elemental nature. When the djinn mas-

ters were overthrown, many djinn, half-djinn, and air genasi were

slain, driven to another plane, or bound in magic items such as

iron flasks. The surviving air genasi went into hiding or fled to

nearby lands. Now air genasi are most common in the Lands of

114

PLANETOUCHED

Intrigue, Sword Coast, and the Western Heartlands. They have

intermixed enough with the local populations that at least half

of them do not resemble the people of Calimshan.

Outlook

Air  genasi,  like  all  the  elemental  planetouched,  are  proud  of

their heritage, regardless of others opinion of them. They know

they are descended from powerful beings, even nobles of their

kind.  Outside  Calimshan  most  people  look  upon  such  things

with  awe  instead  of  fear,  so  the  air  genasi  are  used  to  being

flamboyant with their abilities and expect

a certain amount of deference from

normal folk. Because they consider

themselves  children  of  the  sky,  air

genasi  move  about  a  lot  over  the

course of their lives. Air genasi want

to  see  and  taste  the  air  in  radically

different places and consider settling

in one place for any length of time to

be confining.

In a few rare cases, particularly charismatic air genasi have

gathered a few dozen of their own kind to form a mercenary

company, cabal of mages, or mercantile group. These individu-

als sometimes take air genasi children away from human parents

so  they  may  be  raised  by  their  own  kind.  However,  air  genasi

rarely stay together for longer than a year, so these fosterlings

usually end up being raised by one or two air genasi who stick

together after the group dissolves. Still, these young genasi gain

some sense of community and often go on to start their own

temporary groups.

Language and Literacy

Air  genasi  have  no  common  language,  although  most

learn Auran if only to feel elitist and to share secrets

with each other when within earshot of non-genasi.

An air genasi usually learns the language of his

parents and may pick up other languages

appropriate to his region.

All  air  genasi  are  literate  except

for barbarians.

Air  genasi  view  air  elementals  as

dumb  brutes  but  see  djinn  and  other

intelligent  air-outsiders  as  potential

rivals for attention and power.

AIR GENASI CHARACTERS

Because they may be of any alignment,

air genasi have entered all walks of life,

from paladin to necromancer to cleric.

Many develop skills as rogues or wiz-

ards,  balancing  their  weaknesses

with  spells  or  special  skills.  By

their nature, air genasi make poor

bards, divine spellcasters, or sorcer-

ers.  Those  who  do  practice  magic

favor  spells  involving  air  and

electricity.

Favored  Class:  Fighter.  Because

of  their  excellent  Dexterity  and

Intelligence  scores,  many  air  genasi

go the route of the agile, rapier-wield-

ing fighter rather than the full plate-and-battle-

axe variety.

Air Genasi

Magc and Lore

The air genasi have no unique spells

of  their  own,  but  favor  spells  of

air and lightning.

SPELLS AND

SPELLCASTING

Spell Focus (Evocation) and Spell

(Conjuration)  are  two

Focus

common feats for air genasi spellcast-

ers. Air genasi wizards often specialize in one of

those two schools as well.

Prestige Classes: Air genasi display no particular affinity for

any particular prestige class, but are scattered among them in

more or less equal degree.

Air Genasi Society

Although rarely is more than one air genasi born to any par-

ticular couple, these planetouched see each other as members in

an extended family, and their tendency to wander means that

they are more likely than not to find another of their kind at

some  point  in  their  travels.  Air  genasi  use  these  times  to

exchange news of other air genasi, usually in the form of brag-

ging about their own deeds compared to others. Unlike the bonds

that aasimar share, air genasi feel no need to defend other air

genasi, and in fact see another air genasis weakness as an affir-

mation of their own strength.

Types of Air Genasi

Air Genasi Deities

Air genasi have no common racial deity. Because air

genasi clerics must choose deities who grant the Air

domain, all air genasi clerics worship Aerdrie Faenya, Akadi, Auril,

Set, Shaundakul, Sheela Peryroyl, or Valkur. Those who are not

devout enough to be clerics still worship those deities or a sky-

themed deity appropriate to their region. For example, air genasi

in Calimshan often worship Bhaelros (their name for Talos, the

god of storms) and those in Amn may worship Selne (the god-

dess of moon, stars, and wanderers). Surprisingly, Akadi is not the

most common choice of deity for an air genasi, possibly because

she  associates  with  true  elementals  rather  than  the  anthropo-

morphic elemental outsiders such as djinn. However, among the

clergy of Akadi, air genasi are considered particularly blessed.

Aerdrie Faenya, the elven goddess of the skies, is normally

only  worshiped  by  air  genasi  with  strong  ties  to  elven  com-

munities, particularly communities of avariels. The air genasi

of  Aerdries  faith  act  as  protectors  of  avian  creatures  and

encourage elves to explore other parts of the world, including

human societies.

115

PLANETOUCHED

Auril, the Frost Maiden, is worshiped by air genasi who live

in colder regions or enjoy cold magic. They tend to be zealots,

inflicting pain upon others through the use of cold and wind to

show supremacy of the air element and their own power. A dis-

proportionate  amount  of  Aurils  genasi  worshipers  have  pale

blue skin. Shaundakul is also popular among air genasi. With his

worship on the upswing, this deity has attracted many air genasi

followers both for his focus on wind and because he espouses fre-

quent travel. It is said that centuries ago he took a human lover

in  Myth  Drannor,  and  from  that  line  a  handful  of  white-

bearded male air genasi have sprung.

Air genasi who enjoy destruction, violence, or simple chaos are

often drawn to Talos. Evil druids and rangers sometimes wor-

ship him, as do mages with a talent for large-scale battle magic.

These  beings  do  much  to  sully  the  name  of  air  genasi  across

Faern, for they loudly proclaim their elemental heritage and

their faith, causing many ignorant folk to assume that all this

race are of similar temperament.

Relations with Other Races

Although they are arrogant about their own abilities, air genasi

are  smart  enough  to  recognize  the  talents  of  the  elven  race

(including  half-elves),  and  they  share  a  similar  enjoyment  of

open  natural  spaces.  They  consider  dwarves  homebound  and

closed-minded,  enjoying  far  too  much  the  stony  comfort  of  a

cavern roof overhead. Gnomes are regarded much as dwarves,

but the air genasi know that some gnomes love the open sky as

much as the elves do, and these are tolerated.

Halflings wander as much as air genasi do, and so the hin are

welcome traveling companions to the planetouched. Half-orcs

are considered clumsy and brutish, but valuable allies in a fight,

and so even the haughty air genasi choose their words carefully

around these large halfbreeds. Humans are accepted, although

air genasi consider a typical humans readiness to settle on an

unclaimed plot of land annoying and pointless.

Aasimar, tieflings, and other kinds of genasi are in the same

boat as far as air genasi are concerned. All are touched by some-

thing out of this world, but since no other taint is truly as awe-

some and inspiring as the element of air, air genasi tend to treat

these beings as limited but interesting distant relations.

Air Genasi Equipment

Air  genasi  have  no  weapon  or  piece  of  equipment  that  is

common to their race, because they usually lack a common back-

ground or training. However, because every air genasi has the

innate  ability  to  levitate,  they  are  less  likely  to  carry  rope  or

similar climbing equipment, and most would pass over a ring of

feather falling for a different piece of treasure.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Air  genasi  prefer  birds  and  other  flying  creatures  as  animal

companions  or  pets.  Some  of  the  stranger  air  genasi  acquire

unusual animals such as flying squirrels, winged snakes (see the

appendix), or oversized insects for this purpose. Rumor speaks

of  air  genasi  mages  with  arrowhawks  as  familiars,  but  this

remains unproven.

Earth Genasi

Regions: Mulhorand, the North.

Racial Feats: Elemental Bloodline, Stone Colossus, Stone Slide.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Earth genasi are patient, stubborn, and contemplative in their

decision-making. Marked at birth with obvious traits reflecting

their  heritage,  earth  genasi  are  often  shunned  by  others,  but

their physical gifts make them able to defend themselves against

most attackers. Their strength and girth means that they some-

times  become  bullies,  attracting  sycophants  out  of  fear  and

respect for their power.

At  least  three-quarters  of  the  earth  genasi  in  Faern  are

the descendants of outsiders native to the Elemental Plane of

Earth and humans. The rest are descended from earth deities

or  servants  thereof  instead  of  elemental  outsiders.  Most  of

the elemental bloodlines originate in the North, particularly

near  the  Spine  of  the  World,  as  natural  portals  to  the  Ele-

mental Plane of Earth form there, allowing meetings between

natives  of  both  planes.  The  bloodlines  spring  up  wherever

worship  of  earth  deities  is  common.  It  is  thought  that  the

Ludwakazar clan of shield dwarves deep in the Earthspurs in

Impiltur and the Tobarin family of rock gnomes in the Great

Dale have elemental blood, but both are mute on the question

and  neither  would  be  a  true  earth  genasi,  but  something

quite different.

Earth  genasi  are  obviously  not  human,  but  have  mostly

human  features  except  for  one  or  two  distinguishing  traits

related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these fea-

tures are:

earthlike skin

eyes like black pits

eyes like gems

gravelly voice

very large hands and feet

iron gray hair

sweats mud instead of water

metallic sheen to skin or hair

Earth  genasi,  like  all  elemental  planetouched,  are  proud  of

their nature and abilities, but their pride is a quiet, confident sort

rather  than  a  boastful  one.  Earth  genasi  are  pragmatic  about

their parentage, usually not going out of their way to learn their

ancestry but not avoiding the topic either. Earth genasi have no

special relationship with others of their kind, although they seem

to prefer others who share their physical differences.

Earth genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories

as a human.

History

Earth genasi have no common history. Most of their bloodlines

derive  from  chance  meetings  between  humans  and  earth  out-

siders, and even those descended from agents of earth deities are

spread across the world with no common purpose. Because the

outsider  features  often  skip  a  generation  or  two,  bloodlines

seem to disappear for decades only to pop up again unexpect-

edly in a family that had forgotten its ancestry. Because earth

genasi  are  slightly  less  fertile  than  humans,  some  bloodlines

disappear altogether. Because of their varied origins, both planar

and geographical, earth genasi may be found among any human

racial group.

Outlook

Proud  of  their  heritage  despite  the  opinions  of  others,  earth

genasi know they are born of beings touched by the might of

the earth itself. Although they know the circumstances of their

outsider heritage are rare and mark them as unlike anyone they

might meet, each still feels a strong kinship to the earth itself.

Earth genasi feel most comfortable when their feet are on the

ground  and  prefer  to  go  barefoot  if  appropriate  for  the

weather  and  environment  (earth  genasi  develop

thick calluses easily and can even walk on gravel

without  discomfort).  They  are  used  to  being

treated differently, but have the strength to

defend themselves if harassed. Earth genasi

respect  their  earth  elemental  cousins  for

their strength but are usually indifferent to

other earth elemental creatures.

Earth genasi like to stake out a piece

of  land  as  their  own  and  defend  it,

which  makes  them  particularly

valuable homesteaders in frontier

regions  like  the  Silver  Marches.

A  few  unusual  ones  come  down

with  a  strange  form  of  wanderlust,  wish-

ing to plant their feet on every nations soil

before  they  die.  Such  a  journey  might  take

thirty years, but with methodical determina-

tion certain genasi have become famous for

their long-distance travels.

EARTH GENASI

CHARACTERS

that  each  should  rely  on  his  or  her  own  strength  to  persevere.

The only time this emotional barrier is easily breached is when

two or more genasi with the same physical traits meet. The super-

ficial resemblance awakens an echo of sympathy and kinship in

the earth genasi, and these similarities often lead to deep friend-

ships and even marriages.

It is among these groups that small clans of earth genasi form,

usually  military-based  groups  such  as  a  mercenary  company,  a

squadron  of  rangers,  or  a  gang  of  barbarian  thugs.  The  bonds

between  these  individuals  can  grow  very  strong,  and  the  bards

tell  of  entire  bands  of  earth  genasi  meeting  to  punish  a  cruel

lover  or  person  responsible  for  the  death  of  one  of  the  band.

Because  the  genasi  are  patient,  sometimes  this  revenge  comes

about months or even years after the event, usually in a surpris-

ing and painful encounter.

Because of their strength, earth genasi often fall into

relationships where they are the dominant

person. This means that earth genasi are

known to collect like-minded warriors

about them, genasi or not, and carve

out small baronies for themselves in

isolated lands. Several leaders in the

history  of  the  Border  Kingdoms

have been earth genasi.

Language

and Lteracy

There  is  no  common  language

among  earth  genasi,  and  they  feel

no  urge  to  learn  Terran  unless  they

happen to be a spellcaster who needs to

communicate with summoned elemen-

tals. An earth genasi usually learns the

language  of  her  parents  and  pos-

sibly  other  languages  spoken  in

her native region.

All earth genasi are literate, ex-

cept barbarians.

Types of Earth Genasi

Most  adventuring  earth  genasi  are

combat-oriented,  whether  fighter,  warrior,

ranger,  or  barbarian.  They  usually  learn  styles  of  combat  that

rely on their gifts, so an earth genasi armsman is either capable

of  incredible  bloodshed  or  capable  of  enduring  devastating

attacks  and  remaining  unshaken.  Earth  genasi  wizards  are

uncommon, but those who do embrace arcane magic often learn

spells to enhance their fighting skills or become masters of earth

magic.

Favored  Class:  Fighter.  Some  earth  genasi  may  opt  for  a

more specialized martial path, but the majority of earth genasi

characters  prefer  the  many  bonus  feats  that  only  the  fighter

class offers.

Prestige Classes: Earth genasi favor any prestige class that

helps  them  fight  better,  particularly  the  divine  champion.

Earth  genasi  clerics  have  an  affinity  for  runes,  and  often

become runecasters.

Earth Genasi Society

Earth genasi are among the most isolated of the elemental plane-

touched. They are indifferent to others of their kind, believing

117

Earth Genasi Deities

Earth  genasi  have  no  racial  deity  or  pantheon.  Because  earth

genasi clerics must choose deities who grant the Earth domain,

all air genasi clerics worship Callarduran Smoothhands, Chaun-

tea, Dumathoin, Geb, Gond, Grumbar, Luthic, Moradin, Segojan

Earthcaller,  Urdlen,  or  Urogalan.  Those  who  are  not  devout

enough  to  be  clerics  still  worship  those  deities  or  an  earth-  or

nature-themed deity appropriate to their region.

Revered by earth genasi as the fusion of the powers of earth

and  life  itself,  Chauntea  is  a  popular  choice  among  this  race.

Many  of  the  earth  genasi  who  worship  this  deity  ignore  her

agricultural aspect and instead focus on her role as the benign

Earthmother, a foundation of life and strength that suffuses

the  ground  they  walk  on.  The  more  gentle  worshipers  of

Chauntea are all too happy to hire an earth genasi of the faith

as a guard.

Mulhorand and the lands adjacent to it have a small earth

genasi population, most of whom revere Geb, for the children

of  his  divine  line  become  earth  genasi  instead  of  aasimar.

PLANETOUCHED

Earth genasi from Gebs bloodline often have an affinity for

bears and sometimes have a faint resemblance to a creature

of  that  type.  They  may  select  the  Planetouched  Animal

Affinity feat.

Many earth genasi worship Grumbar, the lord of earth ele-

mentals.  Although  he  shows  them  no  more  favor  than  any

other worshiper, the genasi respect this and see it as proof that

each should rely on his or her own abilities to succeed.

Relations with Other Races

Earth genasi get along well with gnomes and dwarves but find

elves  and  half-elves  too  weak  and  puny  to  be  taken  seriously.

Halflings would almost be in the same category as elves except

that they show a remarkable talent for survival, which the genasi

respect.  Oddly  enough,  most  elves  and  half-elves  appreciate  an

earth  genasis  ties  to  the  land,  even  though  the  feeling  is  not

reciprocated.

As  earth  genasi  usually  have  human  parents,  they  get  along

fine with humans. They have no bias for or against other kinds

of planetouched, even the air genasi, whom they consider flighty

but skilled. Half-orcs are intriguing to earth genasi, for they have

the  hot  blood  of  a  much  stronger  race  tempered  with  human

nature  much  as  earth  genasi  do,  so  the  planetouched  consider

them lesser but similar kin.

Earth Genasi Equipment

Earth  genasi  have  no  traditional  racial  weapons  or  equipment,

although  an  unusually  high  number  of  them  prefer  to  carry

weapons  that  they  themselves  forged.  Common  weapons  are

implements  that  are  useful  in  practical  situations  as  well  as

combat, such as hammers, axes, and picks.

ANIMALS AND PETS

When earth genasi take pets or animal companions, they usually

favor strong and squat creatures, such as mastiffs, badgers, and

bears. A few have a fondness for snakes, preferring constrictors

to venomous ones.

Feyri

Regions: Sun elf (although the feyri hate sun elves, thats where

their heritage lies).

Racial Feats: Deepening Darkness, Enervative Healing, Fiendish

Bloodline,  Improved  Energy  Resistance,  Spell-Like  Ability

Focus.

Level Adjustment: +2 or +3 (see below).

The result of four noble houses of sun elves breeding with demons

in an attempt to strengthen their bloodline, feyri are a type of

planetouched that breeds true among their own kind. Marked by

their fiendish blood, feyri are unique among most planetouched

in that they have a self-sustaining community, so they are raised

among their own kind. Because of this, young feyri do not suffer

the  feelings  of  ostracism  that  other  planetouched  do  despite

growing  up  among  creatures  with  strong  fiendish  blood.  Most

feyri are evil, but a few are able to shrug off the fiendish taints

influence on their behavior and emulate some small part of the

innate good nature of the elves.

Feyri  are  the  descendants  of  sun  elves  and  demons  (usually

succubi in male or female form). Having bred with these demons

and among their own kind, feyri are a distinct race and share the

same common fiendish traits. In general form they resemble sun

elves, although all have large batlike wings. They all have one or

more unusual features reflecting their fiendish heritage, such as:

fiery red eyes

fine scales all over the skin

long pointed tails

batlike ears

deep red skin

Feyri  are  obviously  different  from  normal  elves  and  would

quickly be killed by most other elves if discovered. Luckily for

them,  their  demonic  bloodline  gives  them  several  abilities,

including the ability to change their shape. Thus they can pass

freely among other creatures without causing an alarm.

There  may  be  other  feyri  in  Faern  other  than  those  allied

with House Dlardrageth, but since the likelihood of an elf breed-

ing  with  a  demon  is  very  small,  such  an  individual  would  be

essentially unique outside these four elven houses. The rest of this

section assumes Dlardrageth feyri are the subject matter.

Feyri have the same life expectancy and age categories as a sun elf.

History

Thousands of years ago, the sun elves of House Dlardrageth (in

what is now the forest of Cormanthor) secretly bred with succubi

to strengthen their bloodline. Although they were eventually dis-

covered and imprisoned in a series of caverns, before their con-

finement they allied with three minor noble houses of the elven

nation of Siluvanede in the High Forest. These nobles acquired

caches of Dlardrageth magic items and bred with demons as well,

using these items and their fiendish powers to strike out at their

enemies. These nobles were defeated and magically imprisoned in

the Dlardrageth cache sites.

Three Dlardrageth half-fiends were accidentally released when

Hellgate  Keep  was  destroyed  in  1369  DR.  When  they  broke

through the magical seals on their armories they were surprised

to  find  the  descendants  of  their  allies  from  Siluvanede  within.

Now freed, the planetouched elves joined with their old allies and

began to enact their long-awaited plans.

The feyri associated with House Dlardrageth originally num-

bered less than 60. Since their release, some of these feyri have

broken from their families, trying to find a place in the world

after centuries of magical imprisonment.

Outlook

Most feyri live for revenge. They feel wronged by other elves,

particularly moon elves, and superior to all other races (as befits

their lineage, which ties them to the ancient elven kingdoms that

predate  human  civilization).  While  their  plans  for  revenge

118

unfold, they wish to restore the glory of the elven empires with

themselves at their head, not realizing that their fiendish taint

has corrupted the sun elf qualities that they prize the most. Indi-

vidual  feyri  comply  with  these  goals,  knowing  that  their  half-

fiend rulers are too powerful to challenge and feeling that they

themselves have been punished unfairly by the moon elves with

their too-long magical imprisonment. The feyri also suffer from

unfamiliarity with the changes to the world and are still learn-

ing about its current state. A feyri is patient, calculating, and sus-

picious,  but  her  fiendish  blood  makes  her  prone  to  undeserved

acts of cruelty and rage.

leave the banner of House Dlardrageth. The

members  of  the  house  considered  these

renegade  feyri  a  great  risk  to  their

plans, for the Dlardrageth nobles

know  their  numbers  are  too

small  to  survive  a  concerted

effort to eradicate themthey

must act in secrecy, or risk dis-

covery and death. This makes

any  renegade  feyri  a  crea-

ture  marked  for  death  by

the  entire  house.  Since

Countess  Sarya  Dlardrageth

(CE female half-fiend sun elf

Sor18)  is  a  powerful  spell-

caster,  these  renegades  must

be  even  more  cautious  than

their isolated kin, or they could

be discovered and destroyed.

Feyri  are  usually  chaotic

evil. Some hear an echo of their

elven  heritage  and  are  chaotic

neutral, and a few may be entirely

neutral. None have yet been found

who are lawful or good.

PLANETOUCHED

loathing for each other, both because their elven nature rejects

the taint of their kin and because their demonic ancestors are so

chaotic and rebellious that they find it difficult to work together.

As a result, feyri society is based on power and fearpower to

make  your  commands  obeyed,  fear  that  your  superiors  could

destroy you if you fail to comply. House Dlardrageth is a house

that  cannot  stand  the  test  of  time,  and  the  only  reason  it  has

lasted as long as it has is the magic that imprisoned its members

for centuries. In the next hundred years, it is likely that the feyri

will scatter across Faern, creating their own pockets of evil, pos-

sibly accompanied by near-adult offspring. Until that time, this

group  of  evil-tainted  but  magically  powerful

elves has the potential to incite a great

slaughter of their enemies.

Language

and Literacy

Feyri  speak  Common,  El-

ven,  and  Abyssal.  Individu-

learn  Gnoll,

als  often

Goblin,  and  Sylvan  because

of  the  creatures  that  did

and still do live in the High

Forest.  Feyri  spellcasters

usually  learn  Draconic  to

acquire  magic  from  old

sources.

All  feyri  are  literate

(none  of  the  demonfey  are

barbarians).

Abilities

and Racial

Features

Feyri have the following racial traits:

FEYRI CHARACTERS

Types of Feyri

Feyri blood practically overflows with sorcerous power, so many

feyri  characters  become  sorcerers.  Those  who  dont  become

rogues or fighters, although a fair number are sorcerer/rogues or

sorcerer/fighters.

Favored  Class:  A  feyris  favored  class  is  sorcerer.  Their

demonic  bloodline  and  the  type  of  magical  training  they  get

pushes feyri to develop as sorcerers instead of wizards (the typi-

cal sort of magic a true sun elf practices).

Prestige Classes: Feyri sorcerers often aspire to become arch-

mages,  while  those  of  a  more  martial  bent  consider  becoming

ranger/blackguards or rogue/assassins. Because feyri have elven

blood, the arcane archer prestige class is open to them as well.

Feyri Society

Feyri society is very close-knit. They are all close relations, and

so each feyri has a very good idea how each of his or her family

members  would  react  to  a  situation.  Yet  they  have  a  subtle

+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, 2 Constitution. Feyri are quick

and smart, but their inbreeding makes them weak.

Medium-size.

Feyri land speed is 30 feet. When in their winged form, they

may fly at a speed of 40 feet with a maneuverability rating

of Poor.

Darkvision up to 60 feet.

Low-light  vision:  Feyri  can  see  twice  as  far  as  a  human  in

starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor

illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and

detail under these conditions.

Immunity to magic sleep spells and effects.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Will  saves  against  enchantment  spells

and effects.

Alter self (Sp): Feyri can use alter self at will to assume any

humanoid form, and can remain in that form indefinitely.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Bluff,  Hide,  Listen,  Search,  and

Spot checks.

119

PLANETOUCHED

Elven Blood: For all special abilities and effects, a feyri is con-

sidered  an  elf.  Feyri,  for  example,  can  use  or  create  elven

weapons and magic items with racially specific elven powers as

if they were elves.

Outsider: Feyri are native outsiders.

Demonic Abilities: Every feyri has four special abilities drawn

from  the  following  list:  charm  person (Sp)  1/day,  clairaudi-

ence/clairvoyance (Sp) 1/day, damage reduction 10/+1*, dark-

ness (Sp) 1/day, detect thoughts (Sp) 1/day, dimension door* (Sp)

1/day, enervation* (Sp) 1/day, fire resistance 10, suggestion (Sp)

1/day, +2 racial bonus on saves against electricity, or +2 racial

bonus on saves against poison. Feyri spell-like abilities use the

feyris  character  level  for  their  effect.  The  DC  is  Charisma-

based. A feyri can only have one ability from the list that is

marked with an asterisk (*), and any feyri with one of these

three abilities has a higher level adjustment than a feyri with-

out one.

Level Adjustment: +2. Feyri are slightly more powerful and

gain  levels  more  slowly  than  the  common  races  of  Faern.

This  is  because  the  elders  of  House  Dlardrageth  bred  for

immediate  power  at  the  expense  of  long-term  ability.  Feyri

with  damage  reduction  or  the  dimension  door or  enervation

spell-like abilities have an level adjustment of +3 instead of +2.

See Table 1 in the Introduction for more information.

Feyri Magic and Lore

Feyri draw upon the ancient lore of the sun elves. They favor

three  primary  schools  of  magic:  Conjuration,  Evocation,  and

Transmutation.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Feyri like to use conjuration spells to summon fiendish creatures

to  fight  their  enemies,  relying  upon  their  knowledge  of  the

Abyssal  tongue  to  give  their  servant  creatures  complex  com-

mands. Mage armor is a common spell known by feyri sorcerers.

Evocation spells appeal to the destructive, chaotic nature that

hums within every feyris blood. However, they still are reluc-

tant to harm their forest home, even if it would allow them to

eliminate a large number of their hated moon elf enemies, so

area-affecting  spells  are  used  cautiously  if  trees  might  be

harmed. Feyri are fond of fire and electricity spells, since many

of their own kind are resistant to those energies and they need

not be very cautious when targeting foes engaged in melee with

their allies.

Transmutation spells are used to enhance their combat abili-

ties. Feyri are fond of bulls strength, cats grace, and endurance

to enhance their strengths or compensate for their weaknesses,

and spells such as haste and slow are always useful.

FEYRI MAGIC ITEMS

As  they  are  descended  from  ancient  elven  families,  the  feyri

have  access  to  typical  elven  magic  items  and  the  knowledge

needed  to  make  them.  Boots  of  elvenkind,  cloaks  of  elvenkind,

keen weapons, oathbows, and magical elven chainmail are items

commonly used by feyri.

Feyri Deities

Because of their taint and their alignment change, most feyri

no longer worship the good elven deities of the Seldarine. How-

ever,  unlike  tieflings,  they  rarely  worship  demons,  preferring

true deities rather than powerful agents of their own fiendish

bloodlines.

The foul creature known as Ghaunadaur manifested to one of

the elders of House Floshin nearly a century ago, and since that

time the worship of Ghaunadaur has grown to encompass most

of the feyri associated with House Dlardrageth. The fact that

most of these sun elves now worship a drow deity is evidence of

how corrupt they have become.

Fenmarel Mestarine lives on the outskirts of the elven pan-

theon  and,  as  the  god  of  elven  outcasts  and  those  who  live

away from others, he appeals to the rare neutral feyri. A few

have  started  to  worship  him  in  secret,  hoping  to  learn  the

secrets of survival in modern Faern but not wishing to draw

the  ire  of  their  family  members  who  worship  Ghaunadaur.

Shevarash, an elven deity consumed by bitterness and a thirst

for revenge against the drow, also has some small appeal to the

feyri. While some feyri whisper his name in secret, he con-

siders them as vile as the drow and does not reward them for

their worship.

Relations with Other Races

Feyri of Dlardrageth wish to recruit more sun elves into their

breeding program, but hold no love for any other kind of elf,

including  drow.  They  have  a  sun  elfs  disdain  for  all  other

humanoid  races,  regardless  of  philosophy  or  politics,  and  par-

ticularly  see  humans  as  pretentious  upstarts  that  have  only

acquired civilization on the ruins of elven kingdoms. Feyri are

indifferent toward genasi. Their demonic blood recoils from the

celestially  tainted  presence  of  aasimar,  making  them  natural

enemies.  They  see  tieflings  as  interesting  potential  allies,  less

worthy than a feyri or a sun elf, but certainly more valuable

than a normal human.

Renegade feyri form their own opinions of other races, but

their views are colored by their families prejudice and they have

difficulty  dealing  with  elves  other  than  sun  elves.  Of  all

Feyri Level Adjustment Explained

Because all feyri can fly and have advantageous ability score

modifiers, resistances, spell-like abilities, darkvision, and low-

light vision, they have a level adjustment of +2, comparable

to  a  drow  elf.  Those  feyri  with  damage  reduction  or  the

dimension door or enervation spell-like abilities are even more

powerful, comparable to a deep gnome. Players wishing to play

a  feyri  character  must  decide  if  the  trade-off  of  immediate

power  at  low  levels  is  worth  the  delay  in  level  advancement

over the course of the campaign.

120

PLANETOUCHED

nonelves, they feel the closest to tieflings, for they too know

the  touch  of  evil  and  the  desire  to  live  a  life  not  defined  by

their heritage.

Fire  genasi  are  obviously  not  fully  human,  having  mostly

human features except for one or two exceptional traits related

to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are:

Feyri Equipment

Feyri prefer traditional elven equipment and often refuse to use

items  of  nonelven  make.  They  especially  favor  mithral  chain

shirts and elven chainmail, since these armors are light enough

to be worn while flying.

charcoal gray skin

deep red skin

red or orange hair that waves like flames

eyes that glow when the genasi is angry

unusually warm skin

large red teeth

always smells like smoke

ANIMALS AND PETS

House  Dlardrageths  original  heraldic

device  had  a  feathered  phoenix,  Aelo-

rothis a swan, Ealoeths a pair of pegasi,

and Floshins a two-headed griffon. The

feyri  sometimes  tame  or  enspell

fiendish  creatures  of  these  types  to

serve  as  steeds  or  animal  companions,

although  they  have  no  special  affinity

for them.

Fire Genasi

Regions: Calimshan,  Chult,  Lake  of  Steam,

Unther.

Racial  Feats: Elemental  Bloodline,

Healing Flames.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Fire  genasi  are  usually  thought  of  as

hot-blooded  and  quick  to  anger,  and

they  have  earned  that  reputation.

Mercurial,  proud,  and  often  fear-

less,  they  are  not  content  to  sit

and  watch  the  world  pass  them

by.  Fire  genasi  have  obvious

physical traits that mark them as

different  from  humans,  and  they

are  often  the  target  of  mistrust  and

persecution. Some fire genasi are able to

use their quick wits to turn the tables on

their  tormentors,  while  others  find  that

their  barbed  words  only  make  their  foes

more angry. Many fire genasi are destroyed

as infants by their own parents, who fear that

they are demonspawn.

Most  fire  genasi  in  Faern  are  descended  from  the  efreet

that once ruled Calimshan. Planetouched of this derivation live

all  over  the  Lands  of  Intrigue,  and  some  have  traveled  away

from their ancestral homeland to escape the fear and prejudice

that Calishites bear for genies. Chult, the Lake of Steam, and

Unther also have a small number of fire genasi, for those lands

bear volcanoes that sometimes act as natural portals to the Ele-

mental Plane of Fire, allowing efreet and other fiery outsiders

to  make  contact  with  humans.  A  large  family  of  fire  genasi-

like halflings was known to live in Unther, but the war with

Mulhorand has displaced them and their current whereabouts

are unknown.

121

Fire  genasi  are  proud  of  their  ancestry  and  consider  them-

selves superior to normal humans, although the smarter ones

dont make an issue of it. Because the efreet-descended genasi

of Calimshan have almost no chance of finding their orig-

inal elemental ancestor (who have long since been

slain,  banished,  or  imprisoned

when  their  empire  was  over-

thrown), they make no effort to

do  so  and  enjoy  the  gifts  that

ancestors  blood  has  granted

them.  Fire  genasi  enjoy  the

company of their own kind and

have  been  known  to  form  elite

groups of mages or fighters that

hire  themselves  out  on  the  basis

of their skill and heritage. They

have been known to adopt the

fire  genasi  children  of  human

parents as well.

Fire  genasi  have  the  same  life

expectancy and age categories as

a human.

History

Most  fire  genasi  in  Faern  are

the  result  of  human-efreeti

unions  that  occurred  thousands

of years ago in Calimshan. These

efreet rulers took human lovers,

and  their  half-elemental  off-

spring  served  their  outsider

parent  as  guards,  advisors,  or

diplomats, eventually having chil-

dren  of  their  own,  which  as  often

as  not  were  fire  genasi.  The  over-

throw  of  the  genies  resulted  in  a  great

slaughter  and  scattering  of  all  the  plane-

touched in that land, and since that time those

people  carrying  the  bloodline  of  efreet  have  mixed  with

humans  in  other  lands.  Now  fire  genasi  of  these  bloodlines

might be of any human race, and many do not resemble the

people of Calimshan at all.

Fire genasi who originate in other lands have no common his-

tory, as their bloodlines are rare and unassociated occurrences.

Outlook

The fire genasi are a proud people, knowing that they are born

of great genies. They prefer to dress elegantly and flamboyantly,

PLANETOUCHED

reveling in their differences and advertising their superior taste

and abilities. Fire genasi respect their pure elemental kin, and

most treat efreet and other large fire outsiders with a great deal

of  courtesy  and  respect,  both  out  of  a  sense  of  the  creatures

power and as a subtle gratitude for their own bloodline-granted

talents. Because of their high opinions of themselves, fire genasi

often elect themselves the leader and spokesperson of a group,

even if they have no particular talents in those areas.

Fire genasi are impatient and dont take well to pursuits that

require  a  lot  of  time  and  study.  They  like  to  travel,  if  only  to

escape  the  presence  of  their  enemies  or  people  who  frustrate

them. Fire-genasi enjoy collecting treasure, preferring jewelry to

bags of coins.

FIRE GENASI CHARACTERS

Fire genasi make smart fighters, but many follow the barbarians

path instead, because it is easier and espouses the heat of blood-

lust.  More  fire  genasi  become  sorcerers  than  wizards,  even

though their natural talents would indicate otherwise. Fire genasi

would much rather talk about themselves than other people, and

that  and  their  own  short  tempers  make  them  poor  bards.  The

rare fire genasi who feels the call of the paladin is often the hot-

headed, take-no-prisoners sort who risks losing control.

Favored  Class:  Fighter.  The  mayhem  of  combat  is  easy  for

someone born of fire to understand.

Prestige  Classes:  Fire  genasi  have  no  particular  favorites

among  the  warfare-oriented  prestige  classes.  Many  become

arcane devotees of fire deities, especially Kossuth.

Fire Genasi Society

Fire genasi are competitive among their kind, but their rivalry is

rarely  lethal.  Even  two  fire  genasi  of  radically  different  align-

ments or philosophies are capable of putting down their swords

for  a  talk  on  elemental  nature  and  comparative  histories,  and

should they come to blows they are more likely to ask for and

grant mercy than slay each other outright. Although they have

hot  tempers,  arguments  between  fire  genasi  quickly  burn  out,

although  their  allies  or  minions  might  suffer  the  smoldering

aftereffects.

Other than this friendly banter, fire genasi often go for years

without seeing one of their own kind. Descended from beings who

have strong and close (if argumentative) society, fire genasi still

have a tendency to collect in groups when circumstances allow.

Children  raised  by  two  fire  genasi  parents  see  a  wide  range  of

emotions  in  their  parents,  from  phenomenal  passion  and  epic

poetry  to  screaming  matches  and  thrown  furniture.  This  is

accepted as normal, and they are taught that a life not lived vig-

orously is not worth living.

Language and Literacy

Fire genasi share no racial language, although some learn Ignan

for  the  sake  of  cultivating  an  exotic  air.  A  fire  genasi  usually

learns the language of her parents and other languages spoken in

her native region.

All fire genasi are literate, except for barbarians.

Fire Genasi Magic and Lore

Magic with the Fire descriptor is the obvious place to start, and

that  in  turn  means  spells  from  the  schools  of  Conjuration

and Evocation.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Because  they  have  such  good  saving  throws  against  fire  spells

and effects, a fire genasi spellcaster can risk stunts that no other

spellcaster dares try, such as centering a fireball on herself. The

disparity between Intelligence and Charisma means that most

fire genasi arcanists will be wizards, not bards or sorcerers. Their

(fireproof) spellbooks are often page after page of fire spells.

Fire Genasi Deities

Fire genasi have no common racial deity. Since fire genasi cler-

ics  must  choose  deities  that  grant  the  Fire  domain,  all  fire

genasi  clerics  worship  Gond,  Kossuth,  or  Talos.  Because  they

are  impatient,  quite  often  a  fire  genasi  will  advance  a  short

while as a cleric and progress in another class thereafter. Those

who are not devout enough to be clerics worship fire deities or

martial deities.

Traditionally, few fire genasi worshiped Gond, for he repre-

sents the skill of crafting, which requires too much patience

for  their  liking.  However,  a  number  of  fire  genasi  have  dis-

covered the wonders of smokepowder weapons and now wor-

ship the Wonderbringer for the creation of this device. These

zealous  fusiliers  are  often  hired  to  guard  shipments  of  the

magical explosive.

Kossuth is a favorite among fire genasi, for he represents the

apex of the element that grants them their special gifts. They

revere his fiery aspect rather than his purification aspect. Kos-

suth shows no unusual favor toward his fire genasi worshipers.

Talos,  the  Stormlord,  welcomes  any  worship  involving

destruction, and some fire genasi enjoy the destructive aspect of

their  nature  so  much  that  Talos  is  the  only  clear  choice  for

them. His faith is very popular among fire genasi sorcerers.

Relations with Other Races

Fire genasi consider themselves above all other races but accept

humans because of their own human blood. Dwarves, gnomes,

and halflings are too short to be taken seriously, elves are too

focused  on  the  long-term  consequences,  and  half-orcs  are  too

stupid. Earth genasi are too slow to act, water genasi too dis-

passionate, air genasi too flighty, and aasimar and tieflings too

morose.  Fire  genasi  quickly  become  impatient  with  the  fail-

ings of other races and rarely make friends with anyone but

humans or other fire genasi.

Fire Genasi Equipment

Fire genasi prefer weapons such as rapiers, scimitars, falchions,

and  bladed  polearms.  They  have  no  traditional  equipment

or armor.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Fire genasi prefer pets that are fast and heat-tolerant, such

as desert lizards. Some sorcerers who live in the wastelands

near Calimshan have found how to acquire a tiny monstrous

centipede  or  tiny  monstrous  scorpion  as  a  familiar.  Such

familiars  are  treated  in  the  same  way  as  the  hairy  spider

familiars, described on page 27 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting.

Bred  from  orc  slaves  and

demons, tanarukks are a power-

ful  and  evil  strain  of  plane-

touched who are spreading across

the  North.  Because  of  their  orc

blood  they  breed  rapidly,  and

there are more tanarukks than

any other kind of planetouched.

Entire  tribes  of  the  creatures

have taken root in the Nether

Mountains  and  continue  to

breed  true,  so  in  another  twenty

years they will be a serious threat to

the  tenuous  peace  in  the  North.  With  evil  parentage  on  both

sides of the family, tanarukks are almost always evil, without a

drop of human blood in them to influence their disposition.

Tanarukks are the descendants of orcs and tanarri (vrocks, in

particular). Similar to tieflings, tanarukks are a mortal Faern-

ian creature with the bloodline of an evil outsider. They breed

true with their own kind or with pureblooded orcs, and even orcs

with  one  tanarukk  grandparent  have  all  the  abilities  of  a

tanarukk. Theoretically tanarukks could breed with goblinoids or

even ogres and produce strange crossbreeds, although these are

likely to be sterile.

Unlike most planetouched, tanarukks have a fairly uniform

appearance, resembling short, stocky orcs with stooped postures.

Their hair is coarse, whether on their heads or the odd patches

that grow on other parts of their bodies. They have sharp teeth

and prominent lower tusks, with their lower jaw protruding far-

ther than their small snouts. Their eyes are red and glow when

angry. Their foreheads are low and ridged with horn or scales;

their skin varies from gray-green to dun brown.

Tanarukks have the same life expectancy and age categories

as an orc. They use the dwarf height and weight ranges on Tables

65 and 66 in the Players Handbook.

PLANETOUCHED

History

The citadel now known as Hellgate Keep fell under the sway of

demons  nearly  five  hundred  years  ago.  The  Harpers  placed

wards around the site to prevent the demons from conjuring

any more of their kind, so Grintharke the balor, the most pow-

erful demon present, ordered his evil minions to breed with the

orc  slaves  of  the  keep  in  order  to  produce  fast-breeding  but

powerful creatures who would serve the demons as shock troops

and guards. After a few hundred years, the fiendish bloodlines

stabilized, and the race of tanarukks was born.

In  recent  years,  Grin-

tharke  was  slain.  His  succes-

sors  fell  to  infighting  but

managed to hold power until

the keep itself was destroyed

in 1369 DR by an extrapla-

nar  artifact  known  as  the

Gatekeepers  Crystal.  A

number  of  the  surviving

tanarukks  fled  to  the

Nether  Mountains,  while

others  remain  under  the

command  of  one  of  the

keeps  cambions,  throng-

ing  secret  halls  buried  in

the  Underdark.  The

tanarukks  of  the  Nether

Mountains  are  mingling

with  local  orc  tribes  and

may soon branch out into

the  Spine  of  the  World,

where they will come into

conflict  with  the  tribe  of

King Obould Many-Arrows.

Tanarukks

Outlook

Tanarukks have the worst traits of orcs or half-orcs mixed with

the temper and power of demons. Generally sullen and prone to

rages,  tanarukks  would  rather  fight  than  ponder  and  would

rather kill than argue. Their orc heritage impressed them with

a respect for power, which was only reinforced by their tanarri

mentors. They live recklessly and without moderation, feasting,

drinking, and fighting if the opportunity presents itself. They

are contemptuous of those weaker than themselves, and con-

sider themselves a superior breed of orc. They are impressed

by  strength,  and  only  a  very  powerful  leader  can  convince

them  to  settle  down  long  enough  to  follow  orders  against  a

common enemy.

Among the typical rough-minded tanarukks are a few who are

smarter  or  more  moderate  in  their  temperament,  possibly

because one of their demonic ancestors was a marilith or some

other sort of demon prone to thinking before acting. It is these

tanarukks who become leaders or, dissatisfied with the life avail-

able to them among their own kind, seek out other challenges in

new places. These tanarukks can be the most dangerous but also

have the greatest chance of being befriended by something other

than an orc or tanarukk.

123

PLANETOUCHED

TANARUKK CHARACTERS

Most of the wiser tanarukks are barbarians or fighters, although

a fair number are sorcerers. Leaders multiclass as barbarian/sor-

cerers,  using  their  limited  sorcerer  ability  to  augment  their

physical prowess. Less rage-prone tanarukks tend to be fighters

or rangers.

Favored Class: Barbarian. A tanarukks potent physical ability

becomes  downright  frightening  when  he  gains  the  benefits  of

barbarian rage.

Prestige Classes: Tanarukk blackguards and assassins are fear-

some foes indeed. Tanarukks can also become orc warlords (see

the appendix).

Tanarukk Society

Of all the planetouched, tanarukks are the only ones with a large

and thriving society, for not even the feyri have numbers com-

parable to the tribes of fiend-touched orcs. Of course, tanarukk

society is a mixture of orc and demon society, which means that

they act like orcs infused with supernatural evil power. However,

unlike typical orc society, the strong influence of the mariliths

involved in the breeding program has moderated the patriarchal

tendencies, resulting in a culture where females are treated much

better  than  slaves.  Tanarukk  females  who  give  birth  to  many

strong young can earn a measure of respect for themselves and

carry some influence over their mates.

Like  orcs,  tanarukks  perform  ritual  scarring  on  themselves

and  each  other,  particularly  as  part  of  adulthood  rites.  Because

they are resistant to fire, many scarring rituals use acid or jagged

weapons. Others have iron jewelry or weapons (such as tanarukk

battle gauntlets) hammered into place around their limbs while

still hot, fusing the item in place when it cools, which prevents

theft without killing the tanarukk first.

Language and Literacy

Tanarukks  speak  Orc  and  Abyssal,  using  the  former  for  most

conversations  but  inserting  words  from  the  latter  when  more

sophisticated  concepts  need  to  be  communicated.  Smart

tanarukks usually learn Common so they can more easily inter-

rogate prisoners.

Tanarukks are illiterate, except for those who acquire levels in

a player character class other than barbarian.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Tanarukks have the following racial traits:

+4  Strength,  +2  Dexterity,  2  Wisdom,  4  Charisma.

Tanarukks are strong and agile, but have short attention spans

and aggressive natures.

Medium-size. Tanarukks are squat, but broad, like a dwarf.

Tanarukk land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision up to 60 feet.

Fire resistance 10.

Spell resistance of 14 + class level.

+4 natural armor.

Proficient with all martial weapons.

Outsider Hit Dice: A tanarukk has 5d8 racial Hit Dice from

his demonic heritage. A tanarukk character receives maximum

hit points for his first outsider Hit Die, and rolls his other out-

sider Hit Dice normally. He rolls all Hit Dice from class levels

and  does  not  automatically  get  maximum  hit  points  on  his

first class level Hit Die. A tanarukks racial Hit Dice also pro-

vide a +5 base attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +4, Ref

+4,  and  Will  +4.  Tanarukks  with  class  levels  add  their  class

attack  bonus  and  save  bonuses  to  their  racial  attack  bonus

and saves.

Outsider Skills: A tanarukks outsider Hit Dice grant him skill

points equal to (8 + Int modifier) 8. Class skills for these skill

points  are  Hide,  Intimidate,  Listen,  Search,  and  Spot.  A

tanarukk  does  not  get  the  4  multiplier  for  skill  points

acquired from his first class level.

Outsider Feats: A tanarukks demonic Hit Dice grant him two

feats. A typical tanarukk chooses Alertness and Weapon Focus

(battleaxe). A tanarukk with class levels gains feats based on

his total Hit Dice, as shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.

Natural  Attack:  A  tanarukk  may  use  his  bite  as  a  natural

weapon, dealing 1d6 points of damage. A tanarukk can attack

with  a  weapon  at  his  normal  attack  bonus,  and  make  a  bite

attack as a secondary attack (5 penalty on the attack roll and

half Strength bonus on the damage roll).

Control  Flame  (Sp):  Tanarukks  can  cause  a  nonmagical  fire

within  10  feet  of  them  to  diminish  to  the  level  of  coals  or

flare  to  the  brightness  of  daylight  and  double  the  normal

radius  of  illumination.  This  ability  does  not  change  the  heat

output or fuel consumption of the fire source, lasts 5 minutes,

and  may  be  done  once  per  day.  They  use  this  ability  as  5th-

level sorcerers.

Orc  Blood:  Despite  all  their  special  abilities  and  effects,

tanarukks  are  still  basically  orcs.  Thus  tanarukks  can  use  or

create orc weapons and magic items with racially specific orc

powers as if they were orcs.

Outsider: Tanarukks are native outsiders.

Automatic Languages: Abyssal, Orc, home region. Bonus Lan-

guages: By region.

Favored Class: Barbarian.

Level Adjustment: +3. Due to his racial Hit Dice, plus his spell

resistance,  fire  resistance,  natural  armor,  and  advantageous

ability score modifiers, a tanarukk has an effective character

level of 8 plus his class levels. Thus, a 2nd-level tanarukk bar-

barian  would  have  an  ECL  of  10.  See  Table  1  in  the  Intro-

duction for more information.

Tanarukk Magic and Lore

Tanarukks have few wizards, preferring the ease of sorcery. Since

few have the talent for sorcery either, most tanarukk spellcasters

are clerics.

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Tanarukk  spellcasters  prefer  magic  that  summons  outsiders,

blasts  enemies  with  fire,  or  makes  the  spellcaster  physically

more  powerful  (such  as  bulls  strength,  divine  power,  and

righteous might).

124

PLANETOUCHED

TANARUKK MAGIC ITEMS

Tanarukks rarely have the skill to make their own unique kinds

of magic items, but many wear burning battle gauntlets made for

them  by  their  demonic  masters.  They  otherwise  use  orc  magic

items  or  those  provided  by  the  fiends.  A  few  lucky  tanarukks

carry  ancient  magic  items  looted  from  Hellgate  Keep,  such  as

roaring armor of Ammarindar (see the appendix).

Tanarukk Deities

Like their pureblooded orc ancestors, tanarukks worship the orc

pantheon.  Despite  the  influence  of  their  fiendish  mentors,

tanarukk tribes do not worship demons. Tanarukks who are con-

tent to use their physical prowess in the service of an orc leader

(without  thinking  too  much)  lean  to  the  worship  of  Bahgtru.

More  than  any  other  tanarukks,  the  worshipers  of  Bahgtru

rarely wear armor, considering it a weakness. They tend to be the

strongest and most aggressive members of the tribe.

Gruumsh, He Who Never Sleeps, is revered by all tanarukks

and is especially close to the hearts of the tribal and clan chief-

tains. They see their demonic blood as a reward from Gruumsh

for their long service, and mercilessly kill the weakest young of

the tribe or those who manifest no true tanarukk abilities. Allow-

ing one who has spurned the gifts of the One-Eyed God to live is

an affront to his worship.

Tanarukks  consider  Ilneval,  the  god  of  orc  crossbreeds  and

martial skill, to be their special patron, and Ilneval is worshiped

almost  as  an  equal  to  Gruumsh.  If  this  new  race  continues  to

expand,  he  is  likely  to  supplant  Gruumsh  in  the  eyes  of  the

tanarukks. Ilneval is a favorite of the wiser tanarukks as well as

officers in orc armies. His worshipers are more likely to become

fighters or rangers than barbarians.

Relations with Other Races

Even more so than common orcs, tanarukks consider other races

weaker  than  themselves.  Only  demons  (and,  to  a  lesser  extent,

powerful  fiend-touched  creatures  such  as  half-fiends)  gain  any

respect from the tanarukks, and only because they usually have

power to back up their commands.

Tanarukks  are  prone  to  torture  and  then  eat  any  intelligent

humanoid  that  crosses  their  path.  After  centuries  of  service  to

the tanarri, they are quite conversant with painful methods of

torture and not above eating parts of their victim while it is still

alive. Tanarukks are particularly hateful toward elves, given that

the  weakest  tanarukk  is  more  than  a  match  for  a  half  dozen

common elves.

Tanarukks see orcs and half-orcs as valuable allies but of lesser

status than the tanarukks themselves. Any such allies usually end

up coerced into mixing with the tanarukk tribe to create an even

more numerous next generation of demonic progeny.

Tanarukk Equipment

Common tanarukks rarely wear armor, content with their own

thick  skins.  Lieutenants  and  chieftains  wear  armor,  but  when

forced  to  fight  a  challenger  for  supremacy  they  remove  it  in

order to prove they are powerful without the metal skin.

Many tanarukks wear what they call battle gauntlets

thick bands of metal that cover the forearms and parts of the

hands. Some of the more sadistic ones hold their hands in fire

for  several  minutes  before  battle,  heating  the  gauntlets  so

they deal 1 point of fire damage in addition to the unarmed

strike damage (the tanarukk resistance to fire means this heat

does not affect them at all). Battle gauntlets are not considered

armor by tanarukks, and so there is no stigma of weakness in

wearing them.

ANIMALS AND PETS

During their confinement within Hellgate Keep, tanarukks have

fallen out of practice in training animals and have only recently

begun training boars and dire boars as mounts. Ideally, fiendish

varieties would suit their needs and temperament, but they lack

the means to acquire many of these creatures.

Tiefling

Regions: Mulhorand, Unther, Thay.

Racial Feats: Deepening Darkness, Fiendish Bloodline, Improved

Energy  Resistance,  Outsider  Wings,  Planetouched  Animal

Affinity.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Carrying the taint of evil in their very souls, tieflings are per-

secuted  and  feared  in  most  parts  of  Faern.  Those  with  gross

physical  alterations  are  often  killed  at  birth,  and  even  those

with less noticeable physical traits are sometimes killed by their

own horrified parents. Occasionally a tiefling is born to someone

indifferent to its appearance, determined to redeem it, willing to

exploit it, or evil enough not to care about its nature, and these

tieflings are most likely to survive to adulthood. Most tieflings

are evil, but a few have managed to overcome their bloodlines

influence to make their own choices about good and evil.

Tieflings are the distant descendants of a human and some

evil outsider, such as a demon (usually a marilith or succubus),

devil (usually an erinyes, gelugon, or pit fiend), night hag, rak-

shasa, or even a servant of an evil deity (some of these creatures

must  use  magic  to  assume  a  form  that  is  compatible  with  a

human  mate,  of  course).  Fiend-touched  and  similarly  tainted

mixes of elves (notably the feyri), orcs (such as the tanarukk),

and other races are known, but those are distinct lines and are

not true tieflings.

Tieflings  look  human  except  for  one  or  two  distinguishing

features  related  to  their  unusual  ancestor.  Some  examples  of

these features (and the ancestors that cause them) are:

small horns on head (demon, devil, night hag)

fangs or pointed teeth

forked tongue (demon, devil)

glowing red eyes (demon, devil, night hag)

cat eyes (rakshasa)

more or less than 5 fingers (demon, devil)

goatlike legs (devil)

hooves (devil)

non-prehensile tail (demon, devil)

furry, leathery, or scaly skin (demon, devil, rakshasa)

red skin (demon, devil)

bruised blue skin (night hag)

Tieflings  are  aware  at  an  early  age  that  they  are  different

from  the  people  around  them,  and  often  have  strange  urges,

desires, or needs because of their evil heritage. Because tieflings

are born of many different creatures, it is difficult to tell if any

two of them are related, and because many of them come from

demonic bloodlines, even two tieflings descended from similar

demons or the very same demon might look very different.

Tieflings have the same life expectancy and age categories as

a human.

History

Most Faernian tieflings come from bloodlines originating in

Mulhorand and Thay. The Mulhorandi tieflings are descended

from  servants  or  manifestations  of  Set  or  Sebek,  while  those

from Thay are usually the result of dalliances with fiends of all

kinds.  As  with  the  aasimar  from  Mulhorand,  many  tieflings

from that ancient land leave the region to seek their own des-

tiny without outside interference. Thayan tieflings are usually

the grandchildren of powerful wizards, birthed as part of some

power scheme, and usually spend their lives as slaves or pawns

to both sides of the family (although Nevron, the zulkir of Con-

juration,  is  rumored  to  be  a  tiefling).  In  either  case,  tieflings

from these two regions usually resemble the human race of their

parents, with their inhuman traits making them stand out from

other Thayans or Mulhorandi.

Unther is reputed to have a tiefling population comparable to

Mulhorand, but in truth this is a misconception, for the evil and

mad  god-king  Gilgeam  sired  no  children  for  fear  of  creating

something that might usurp his throne. However, Nergal (the

Untheric god of the underworld) is thought to have fathered at

least one child before he was slain during the Orcgate Wars over

two thousand years ago, and it is possible that some Untheric

men and women still carry that evil deitys bloodline. The mages

of  Unther  may  also  be  responsible  for  some  devil-spawned

tieflings as well.

Outlook

Tieflings live as outcasts. Feared for their evil heritage and often

acting appropriately to their ancestry, they learn to keep people

at a distance and hide that which makes them different. Like all

the  planetouched,  they  are  different  from  their  own  parents;

rarely  has  a  tiefling  been  raised  in  a  home  filled  with  love.

Tieflings  are  bitter  folk  who  expect  eventual  rejection  from

even their best friends and easily fall into lives of crime, deprav-

ity, and cruelty. Tieflings look upon true fiends and other evil

outsiders with envy and fear.

Some tieflings reject their tainted blood and seek the light.

Not  many  succeed  for  long,  and  far  more  slide  to  a  com-

fortable place midway between evil and good. But of the crea-

tures who work to be good, good-aligned tieflings probably work

the hardest.

TIEFLING CHARACTERS

Many  tieflings  multiclass  between  rogue  and  another  class;

even the most skilled tiefling wizard might have a knack for

tumbling, opening locks, or sneaking about. A tiefling is ver-

satile enough to be just about anything, although they make

poor sorcerers.

Favored Class: Rogue. No other class rewards high Dexterity

and Intelligence like the rogue does, and its flexible nature suits

the tieflings status as an outcast.

Prestige Classes: Because of their innate association with evil,

many  evil  tieflings  become  blackguards.  Still  others  become

assassins, shadowdancers, or shadow adepts.

Tiefling Society

Because  of  the  varied  circumstances  of  their  births,  most

tieflings become adults without knowing another of their kind.

Given  their  scattered  heritage  and  tendency  toward  evil,

tieflings mistrust each other, while at the same time wanting

another  of  their  kind  near  to  experience  a  limited  kinship.

Therefore it is not unusual to find a small group of like-minded

tieflings  at  the  head  of  a  thieves  guild.  Sometimes  a  good

tiefling will search out others of her kind in the hopes of res-

cuing them from evil or persecution, but most tieflings are so

used  to  looking  out  only  for  themselves  that  such  a  thought

never occurs to them.

Thay is unusual because of its numbers of tiefling slaves. An

unknown number of fiendish bloodlines exist in Thay, some of

them lost for generations. When a true tiefling arises from a

latent bloodline, there is often a scramble as the Red Wizards

struggle to collect the planetouched offspring. Some Red Wiz-

ards train these young tieflings with others of their kind, either

to  work  as  spies  in  other  households,  personal  assassins,  or  as

some  sort  of  sacrifice  to  an  evil  being.  These  tieflings  can

develop a sense of community among their fellows. If they are

lucky, they may manage to escape their evil masters, scattering

to  the  four  winds  to  elude  pursuit.  Some  of  these  slaves  start

revolts to cover their tracks, others return to kill their former

owners, and still others leave and never look back. In this way,

certain tieflings have extended families, although how to find

their adopted siblings usually poses a problem.

Language and Literacy

Tieflings  share  no  common  language.  Some  learn  Infernal  or

Abyssal, although since most have no idea where their bloodline

comes from as often as not they choose the wrong racial lan-

guage. A tiefling usually learns the language of her parents and

may pick up other languages appropriate to her region.

All  tieflings  are  literate,  except  for  barbarians  and

commoners.

Tiefling Magic and Lore

Many  tieflings  seek  out  magic  that  brings  the  power  of  the

Lower  Planes  to  them,  especially  divination  magic  that  lets

tieflings ask questions of powerful fiends and conjuration spells

that call forth creatures of darkness.

126

PLANETOUCHED

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Many  tieflings  acquire  the  Infernal  Bargainer  feat  (see  the

appendix), which lets them call more powerful creatures with

their spells and gives them other evil allies.

Tiefling Deities

Tieflings have no common racial deity, but sometimes worship

powerful demons, devils, or whatever divine being their ances-

tor serves (or that being itself, if the ances-

tor is a deity). A tiefling born outside the

Old Empires or Thay, or one whose trav-

els have taken her far from those lands,

usually takes a like-minded patron ap-

propriate to her new country. The fol-

lowing  deities  are  the  most  common

patrons  of  evil  tieflings  but  are  cer-

tainly not the only ones.

Beshaba,  the  Maid  of  Misfortune,

appeals to a number of tieflings. This

wicked  and  beautiful  goddess  has  cre-

ated a few tiefling bloodlines over the

ages,  many  of  which  have  white  hair

and manifest antlers instead of other

kinds of horns. Tieflings who wor-

ship  Beshaba  do  so  because  they

believe they are unlucky to have

been  born  as  what  they  are  and

seek to pass this misfortune on to

others.  While  Cyric  has  not

fathered  any  tiefling  bloodlines

since his apotheosis, tiefling assas-

sins, illusionists, and those drawn to

conflict  and  aggression  because  of

their heritage often worship Cyric.

Gargauth,  the  god  of  corruption,

betrayal, and cruelty, has been known to

disguise himself as a helpful stranger, be-

friend  a  good  woman  in  difficult  circum-

stances, and leave her just before she gives birth to

their  halfbreed  child.  These  children  of  evil  emulate  their

fathers practices, and so the bloodline of Gargauth has many

scions  in  Faern.  He  is  worshiped  by  tieflings  looking  to

destroy  a  hated  rival  (possibly  a  good-aligned  temple  that

harassed  them  as  a  youth)  or  those  looking  to  gain  power

very quickly.

As many tieflings naturally gravitate toward the arts of the

rogue, a number of them have taken Mask for their patron.

Only one Maskarran tiefling bloodline is known, a line from

Thesk noted for never casting reflections, but Masks secretive

nature  means  that  others  could  be  almost  anywhere.  Mask is

worshiped by tiefling thieves or those who must do their work

concealed by shadows. Shar is not known to have any plane-

touched offspring, but she draws the worship of those who wish

to forget their old pains and hurts. She particularly enjoys

pitting her tiefling worshipers against the aasimar servants

of Selne.

Relations with Other Races

Tieflings treat most other races equallyat arms length. They

are very slow to trust others and always wary of a friend sud-

denly becoming an enemy. Aasimar often trigger an instinctive

fear  or  revulsion  in  tieflings,  making  it  difficult  for  them  to

work together at all.

Half-orcs are the only race tieflings easily tolerate, since they

are the only common mixed-breed race that is derided as much

as tieflings. Still, a tiefling isnt more likely to trust a half-orc;

shes just more likely to understand his perspective.

Tiefling Equipment

Tieflings share no common equip-

ment,  although  they  do  have  a

fondness for weapons that inflict a

lot of pain and cause a lot of bleed-

ing.  A  tiefling  usually  feels  very

comfortable  with  an  unholy weapon

in his hand.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Given  their  diverse  backgrounds,

tieflings  dont  have  any  particular

animal that can be recognized as a

racial  favorite.  However,  they  do

favor vicious dogs, rats, snakes, and

ravens as pets, and those with talent

for magic can sometimes establish

a  bond  with  a  fiendish  animal  of

some sort.

Water Genasi

Regions: Aglarond,  Chessenta,  Dragon  Coast,

Sembia, Vilhon Reach.

Racial  Feats: Breathing  Link,  Elemental  Bloodline,

Types of Tieflings

Rapid Swimming.

Level Adjustment: +1.

Water  genasi  are  patient  and  independent,  used  to  solving

problems  on  their  own  and  not  afraid  to  take  a  lot  of  time

doing so. At times they are fierce and destructive like terrible

storms,  but  more  often  than  not  they  present  a  tranquil

appearance,  despite  whatever  emotions  run  underneath  that

quiet surface. Because their elemental forebear usually has no

interest  in  them,  water  genasi  are  often  abandoned  by  their

human parents and raised instead by aquatic creatures such as

aquatic  elves,  dolphins,  locathah,  merfolk,  sahuagin,  or  even

aboleths.  Water  genasi  usually  leave  their  parents  (real  or

adoptive)  upon  reaching  maturity,  taking  to  the  open  sea  in

order to explore, learn, and develop their own personality and

place in the world.

Most  water  genasi  are  descended  from  a  water  elemental

outsider such as a marid (water genie) or triton. A rare few are

born of outsider servants of the evil water goddess Umberlee

(although  it  is  not  known  why  these  matings  eventually

127

PLANETOUCHED

produce water genasi instead of tieflings). Aquatic elves tell of

a lost line of sea-elf planetouched descended from minions of

Deep  Sashelas,  but  these  are  not  true  water  genasi,  lacking  a

genasis human heritage.

Water genasi look human except for one distinguishing fea-

ture related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these

features are:

lightly scaled skin

clammy flesh

blue-green skin or hair

large blue-black eyes

webbed hands and feat

Water  genasi  feel  that  they  are  unique  and  superior  to  the

humans who bore them. They have little or no interest in others

of their kindsince they can wander both the land and the seas,

they feel there is room enough in the world that water genasi

need  not  crowd  each  other  or  even  meet.  Only  in  large  com-

munities of aquatic elves are two or more water genasi likely to

spend much time together.

Water genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories

as a human.

History

Nearly every water genasi can be traced back to a unique cross-

breed between a water outsider and a human. Water genasi have

no common history, although most of them are born in or near

the Sea of Fallen Stars. No known record exists of water genasi

trying to build a community of their own kind, although from

time to time an aquatic hero shows up in the history books, usu-

ally  associated  with  rescuing  drowning  sailors  or  thwarting

sahuagin attacks. Water genasi villains also appear in these tales,

from  pirates  who  love  to  drown  their  enemies  to  blue-haired

leaders of merrow raiding parties.

Because of their varied origins, water genasi may be of any

human stock.

Outlook

Water genasi take pride in their special abilities and can be boast-

ful  if  in  the  right  mood.  Tougher  than  humans  and  able  to

breathe water, these genasi sometimes view human sailors and

naval merchants as vulnerable fools who are as likely to drown

at sea as they are to get seasick. The people of the Sea of Fallen

Stars are familiar enough with the stories of water genasi to rec-

ognize them and ignore their rude behavior.

Water genasi have the best of both worlds. They can walk on

land  for  an  indefinite  time  (unlike  aquatic  elves,  whom  they

secretly pity) and can always retreat to the tranquil depths of

the ocean. Often loners, they sometimes establish a home in a

remote underwater cave, going for years without encountering

another intelligent being. They feel a kinship to other aquatic

creatures,  particularly  tritons  and  water  elementals,  who  can

easily outswim the genasi.

Water genasi tend to be neutral and therefore avoid extremes

in  politics,  opinion,  or  career.  Some  find  a  quiet  spot  to  call

home, others enjoy riding the currents for months, allowing the

water to take them places hundreds of miles away.

WATER GENASI CHARACTERS

Water genasi often multiclass between fighter and another class,

keeping their levels relatively even.

Favored Class: Fighter. Water genasi prefer combat styles and

weapons that unbalance, bind, or disarm their opponents.

Prestige Classes: Water genasi have no particular prestige class

preferences.

Water Genasi Society

Water genasi have no society of their own, but often subcon-

sciously adopt traits of the people who raised them, so a water

genasi  raised  by  aquatic  elves  is  likely  to  believe  in  personal

freedoms and good behavior, while one raised by sahuagin will

be bloodthirsty and militaristic. Water genasi from different

cultures  can  be  as  radically  different  as  a  quiet  spring  and  a

raging waterfall.

Water  genasi  do  not  prefer  the  company  of  other  water

genasi. If anything, it makes them feel less special and unique in

the context of the other beings they live near. Accordingly, they

rarely live in the same communities and none have been known

to marry. This keeps the population of repeat-generation water

genasi  low,  with  new  genasi  coming  from  new  bloodlines  or

from lines that skipped a generation.

Their self-contained nature makes water genasi unlikely lead-

ers. A water genasi is more likely to guard or support a person

he respects and admires than to be a person who attracts or wel-

comes subordinates.

Language and Literacy

As  most  of  them  are  born  on  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Stars,  water

genasi  learn  Common  because  of  all  the  mercantile  traffic.

Many learn Aquan or Serusan in order to converse with other

aquatic creatures, and the ones who live with or near aquatic

elves  usually  learn  Elven  as  well.  Those  raised  by  sahuagin

learn Sahuagin.

All water genasi are literate, except for barbarians, common-

ers, and warriors.

Water Genasi Magic

and Lore

Water  genasi  prefer  spells  that  produce  cold,  ice,  snow,  and

water. Water genasi spellcasters are usually clerics or druids, for

they rarely have the talent for sorcery and water ruins scrolls

and  spellbooks  (although  at  least  one  water  genasi  wizard  has

developed a method for scribing scrolls on carved shells).

SPELLS AND SPELLCASTING

Conjuration  spells  are  most  important  to  most  water  genasi,

because they allow the summoning of water elementals and con-

trol of the weather.

128

PLANETOUCHED

WATER GENASI MAGIC ITEMS

Water  genasi  favor  magical  nets  and  items  that  can  be  used

underwater, such as tridents of warning or horns of the tritons.

The  first  coral  dolphin  figurine  of  wondrous  power (see  the

appendix) was created by a water genasi mage.

Water Genasi Deities

Water genasi have no common racial deity. Those who live with

a community of other aquatic creatures usually adopt

the  patron  deity  of  their  allies.  Because

water genasi clerics must choose deities

who  grant  the  Water  domain,  all

water  genasi  clerics  worship  Auril,

Deep  Sashelas,  Eldath,  Isis,  Istishia,

Sebek, Silvanus, or Umberlee. Those

who  are  not  devout  enough  to  be

clerics still worship those deities or

another  water-themed  deity  such

as Valkur.

While  few  water  genasi  enjoy

very  cold  weather,  those  who  do

usually worship the Frostmaiden.

These eccentric genasi often swim

in arctic waters with seals and sim-

ilar  creatures,  and  are  known  for

their  habit  of  pairing  up  with  a

large  cold-based  monster.  They

often  make  friends  with  frost

giants.

Deep  Sashelas,  the  elven  god  of

waves  and  waters,  is  a  natural

choice  for  genasi  who  associate

with  aquatic  elves.  They  often

act  as  emissaries  and  messengers

between  colonies  of  aquatic  elves

and their landbound cousins. As the

patron  of  water  magic,  he  also  has

many arcane spellcasters worshiping him.

The  most  placid  and  introspective  water

genasi worship Eldath. Her clerics and druids

are benign and helpful beings, which makes them a favorite prey

of followers of Malar. Mages who worship Eldath prefer abju-

ration  spells  over  all  other  kinds.  Istishias  idea  of  embracing

ones personal excellence is appealing to water genasi, as is his

message of flexibility and overcoming obstacles over time. His

worshipers are mediators, often interceding between rival groups

using the same body of water, whether two different fishing vil-

lages or a colony of aquatic elves annoyed by merchant traffic

above their kelp beds.

Rough  waters  and  remote  naval  exploration  are  meat  and

bread  to  water  genasi.  Water  genasi  revering  Valkur  are  wel-

comed by sea captains and respected by common sailors. Some

lack a taste for adventure but love working with boats, and these

make  a  living  in  coastal  communities  repairing  ship  damage

below the water line.

Many evil water genasi in the vicinity of Mulhorand, Unther,

and  Chessenta  worship  the  crocodile  god  Sebek,  sometimes

becoming  lycanthropes.  They  harass  shipping  routes  and  folk

living on or near rivers. Like their deity, they constantly feel

the need to prove their strength and justify their existence by

bullying  creatures  weaker  than  themselves.  Worshipers  of

Umberlee,  the  Bitch  Queen,  can  be  the  most  cruel  and  tem-

peramental of all the water genasi. They enjoy extorting money

for  their  church,  and  a  shipboard  cleric  has  nothing  to  fear

should the crew decide to push him overboard when the weather

turns  nasty.  Evil  spellcasters  who  practice  water  magic  often

worship her as well.

Relations with

Other Races

Water  genasi  feel  closest  to  their

adopted race and indifferent to all

others.  Aquatic  creatures  and

others  who  can  naturally  breathe

water are treated less coolly (unless

such a creature is a natural enemy

of the genasis adopted race, such

as  a  sahuagin-raised  genasi  con-

fronted  by  a  triton).  They  hold  no

special animosity toward fiery crea-

tures or fire genasi, and see a simi-

larity  between  themselves  and

flying creatures, although they are

quick  to  point  out  that  natural

fliers have to come to rest on land

eventually while they and other sea

creatures can live in the water indef-

initely.  They  laugh  at  and  ridicule

aquaphobic  creatures,  and  dwarves

are  frequently  the  target  of  their

jokes  and  pranks  (almost  always

involving a dunking).

Types of Water Genasi

Water Genasi

Equipment

Water genasi who live in the water use items favored by other

aquatic racesnets instead of pouches, stabbing weapons instead

of slashing or bludgeoning, and so on. They have no need to

drink while in the water, so they have little need to transport

liquids except for potions, for which they use potion bladders

(see the Equipment section of the appendix).

ANIMALS AND PETS

Water  genasi  who  live  in  the  water  prefer  dolphins,  octopi,

sharks, and other aquatic animals as pets and animal compan-

ions. Those who live on the land and water prefer animals that

can  live  in  both  environments,  such  as  crocodiles,  otters,  and

some snakes and birds.

129

well.  The  males  are  brightly  colored,  usually  red,  orange,  or

yellow, while the females are either brown or gray.

Aarakocra hatchlings arent permitted to leave the nest for

the first three months of life. After that, they are considered

children for only about five years. At this point, they are kicked

out  of  the  familys  portion  of  the  tribes  communal  nest  and

given a place of their own. Aarakocra can live to be over 100

years old.

Aarakocra have the same life expectancy and age categories

as humans.

History

The  aarakocras  originally  came  from  the  distant  land  of

Maztica, far to the west of Faern. Over the course of several

generations, flights of aarakocra migrated from island to island

across the Trackless Sea, following far-ranging scouts in search

of new nesting grounds beyond the sunrise. The first aarakocra

colonists arrived in northern Faern in 418 DR, the Year of the

Eagles Flight.

The  aarakocras  eventually  created  four  major  colonies  in

Faern: the Star Mounts in the High Forest, the Storm Horns

in Cormyr, the Cloven Mountains on the Vilhon Reach, and the

Mistcliffs  in  Chult.  However,  the  Star  Mounts  colony  was

destroyed only a few years ago by Elaacrimalicros, an ancient

green dragon. All Faernian aarakocras have sworn to avenge

their deaths of their kin.

Outlook

Aarakocra look down on other races, both literally and figu-

ratively.  They  pity  the  poor  landbound  fools  for  their  lack

of  mobility,  and  they  often  criticize  them  for  a  lack  of

perspective.

Aarakocras have a need to travel, to see the world unroll

beneath their feet. This, combined with a lust for vengeance

against the creature who murdered their fellows in the Star

Mounts  colony,  has  thrust  many  of  them  out  into  the

wider world.

While the minor races arent as well repre-

sented  across  Faern  as  the  standard

character races, they are still forces to be

reckoned  with.  These  are  not  isolated  monsters;  each  of  these

races has a vital culture uniquely its own, most with a long and

storied history, meaningful traditions, and a great deal of pride.

Aarakocra

Regions: Chult, Cormyr, High Forest, Vilhon Reach.

Racial  Feats: Flyby  Attack  (see  Monster  Manual),  Hover

(dragon feat; see Monster Manual), Improved Flight, Wing-

over (dragon feat; see Monster Manual).

Level Adjustment: +2.

The aarakocras are a race of intelligent birdlike people who live

in mountainous areas around Toril. Aarakocras love to soar high

in  the  sky  for  hours  on  end,  riding  the  thermal  currents  and

updrafts with their wings spread wide. From a distance, its easy

to mistake them for eagles or some other large bird of prey.

Aarakocras stand about 5 feet tall and have a wingspan of 20

feet.  On  average,  they  only  weigh  about  90  pounds.  Midway

along each wing they have a three-fingered hand, which is only

useful when the wings are folded in. Their wing muscles attach

to a bony chestplate, and their powerful legs end in sharp talons

that can be drawn back, allowing aarakocras to use their feet as

hands.  Their  heads  combine  the  features  of  an  eagle  and  a

parrot. Their beaks are gray-black, and their eyes are black as

AARAKOCRA CHARACTERS

The  aarakocras  are  a  proud  people  with  strong  ties  to  one

another.  They  are  hunters  of  surpassing  skill.  Aarakocra

hunters soar over their chosen hunting ground until they spot

game, then dive down at top speed to snatch up their meal and

kill it before it even knows what happened to it. For this reason,

most aarakocras become fighters, and this is their favored class.

Aarakocra Society

Life as an aarakocra is mostly spent hunting or making tools

and  weapons.  While  not  every  male  aarakocra  is  expected  to

snatch  up  the  tribes  meals  on  a  daily  basis,  those  who  dont

better have good reasons why not. Children and the extremely

old are excused from this duty.

As a young aarakocra nears maturity, his elders teach him to

hunt for himself. If he shows a great reverence for the sky and

his prey, he may be steered into a career as a cleric.

Tribal life is everything to most aarakocra. The tribe shares

a large, roofless communal nest made

of thick vines woven together into

a gigantic bowl. The eldest member

of  the  tribe,  whether  male  or

female,  leads  the  tribe  with  the

help of the tribal shaman (cleric).

Away from the tribe, aarakocras

are  aloof,  whether  singly  or  in  a

group.  They  are  extremely  claus-

trophobic  and  refuse  to  enter  any

enclosed area unless there is no other

choice.  To  them,  being  trapped  in  a

room with no way to reach the sky is

akin to death.

Language

and Literacy

Aarakocras speak Auran, the language

of  air  elementals.  Their  race  has  had

such a long relationship with these crea-

tures that aarakocras have adopted the

tongue  as  their  own.  They  also  nor-

mally  speak  Common,  having  long

since realized that they need to be able

to communicate with those people on

the ground.

All  aarakocras  are  illiterate,  except

for  those  with  a  player  character  class

other than barbarian.

Aarakocra land speed is 20 feet. Their fly speed is 90 feet, with

average maneuverability.

+1 natural armor.

Natural Attacks: A flying aarakocra can attack with 2 talons,

dealing 1d4 points of damage each, or he can use a weapon in

his talons. An aarakocra on the ground can wield weapons in

his  wing-claws  at  his  base  attack  bonus  and  attack  with  his

bite as a secondary attack (5 penalty on the attack roll, and

half Strength bonus on the damage roll), dealing 1d3 points

of damage.

Proficient with javelin.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Craft  (any  one),  Knowledge  (nature),

Listen, and Spot checks. Aarakocras spend a great deal of their

time hunting, building nests, or making tools.

Claustrophobic: Aarakocras suffer a 4 circumstance penalty

on all attack rolls and skill checks when in an enclosed area.

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Auran,  and  home  region.

Bonus  Languages:  Draconic,  Elven,  Orc,  Sylvan.  When

aarakocras  speak,  they  punctuate  their  words  with  birdlike

sounds, much in the way of a parrot imitating human speech.

Level  Adjustment:  +2.  The  aarakocras  ability  to  fly  is  the

greatest reason for this. A player may play an aarakocra as a

character with total levels equal to his class levels +2. See Table

1 in the Introduction for more information.

Aarakocra

Magic and Lore

Aarakocra  have  a  single

spell  particular  to  their

people, the aerial summoning

dance (see the appendix).

Aarakocra

Deities

Aarakocras  in  Faern  almost  all

worship  a  single  deity:  Aerdrie

Faenya.  This  elven  weather

god is favored by the aarakocras

simply  because  she  is  the  only

good  deity  who  speaks  to  the

aarakocran way of life. She has been

known  to  sometimes  appear  to  the

aarakocras in the form of a brilliant

white,  giant  bird.  The  feathers  that

fall from this bird-gods plumage are

among  the  most  treasured  items  in

an aarakocran nest.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Aarakocras have the following racial traits:

2  Strength,  +4  Dexterity.  Lightweight  but  fast,  the

aarakocras are built for speed over bulk.

Medium-size:  As  Medium-size  creatures,  aarakocras  have  no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Aarakocra

Relations with Other Races

Aarakocras like to keep their distance from other races. Of all

the other races, aarakocras feel closest to elves because of their

common worship of Aerdrie Faenya and the respectful way in

which most elves treat nature.

Aarakocras dont feel much of anything about the other stan-

dard character races. They have an abiding hatred of orcs, gob-

linoids, and lizardfolk, though, for these creatures will cage and

torment aarakocras, given the chance.

131

MINOR RACES

Aarakocra Equipment

In  battle,  aarakocras  prefer  javelins  over  all  other  weapons.

They often carry six of them at a time, strapped to their chests

in individual sheaths, like a large bandolier. Many of them also

carry flight lances (see the appendix).

ANIMALS AND PETS

Aarakocras do not raise domestic animals for food or as beasts

of burden. They sometimes allow smaller birds to nest around

them,  but  these  are  more  friends  than  pets.  Like  the

avariels, aarakocras often befriend giant eagles.

Centaur

Regions: Chondalwood, Dalelands, Great

Dale, High Forest, Tethyr.

Racial  Feats: None,  but  centaurs  can

acquire  the  Spirited  Charge  and

Trample  feats  (ignoring  the  pre-

requisites) and apply the benefits

to their own melee attacks.

Racial Hit Dice: 4d8

Level Adjustment: +3

Centaurs  are  magnificent

creatures. From the waist up,

they appear like well-muscled

humanoids.  Their  pointed

ears  suggest  they  were  once

related  to  elves.  From  the

waist  down,  however,  they

have the bodies of horses. The

centaurs  humanoid  skin  is

usually  bronzed  from  many

hours  in  the  sun.  Their  equine

coats  vary  greatly  in  color  and

pattern,  just  as  much  as  any  tradi-

tional horse. Many different species of

creatures  appear  to  be  conglomerations

of  two  or  more  other  species,  but  few  of

these  are  as  handsome,  noble,  and  articulate  as  the

centaurs.

Centaurs  are  usually  honorable  and  affable  people.  They

prefer  to  stick  to  their  own  kind,  but  they  are  not  afraid  to

socialize with those from other races.

The main aim of most centaurs is to live in harmony with

their forest homes. They are uneducated, but few are wiser than

they in the ways of the woods. They care far more for the wilds

in which they live than for what someone might have once writ-

ten in some moldering old book.

Centaurs  mature  early  and  live  short  but  happy  lives.  Like

horses, they can walk from birth, albeit on shaky hooves at first.

They  are  considered  children  for  only  two  years,  after  which

they  are  adolescents  for  another  three.  Once  they  reach  five

years of age, centaurs are considered full adults. On average,

centaurs live around 40 years, although some have been known

to reach the ripe old age of 60.

From their chests to the back of their rumps, full-grown cen-

taurs measure six to eight feet long. From their front hooves to

their crowns, they are seven to eight feet tall. Centaurs weigh

anywhere from 950 to 1,200 pounds.

Centaurs have the same life expectancy and age categories as

half-orcs.

History

Human  legend  has  it  that  the  centaurs  are  the

result  of  some  mad  cross  between  a  wild  elf

and a wild mustang, but both the wild elves

and  the  centaurs  take  umbrage  at  this

suggestion. (The mustangs have no par-

ticular opinions on the matter.) As far

as  the  centaurs  are  concerned,  they

have always been on Toril, caretakers

of  the  forest  in  which  they  make

their homes.

The  centaurs  territory  has  been

slowly dwindling over the years, and

presumably  their  numbers  as  well.

According  to  centaur  myth,  the

forests of Faern once ran thick with

great  tribes  of  centaurs.  It  is  only

since the encroachment of the civi-

lized  races  that  the  centaurs  have

been forced to retreat into smaller and

smaller ranges.

Outlook

Centaurs  see  themselves  as  the  noble

guardians  of  the  forest.  They  are  the

royalty  of  the  woods.  Because  of  this,

they  feel  protective  of  their  homes

and responsible for the defense of the

creatures  with  which  they  share

their space.

Centaur

Male  centaurs  spend  almost  all

their waking hours either hunting or out

patrolling  their  lands,  keeping  their  sharp

eyes peeled for any outsiders who might be encroaching on

their territory and doing the forest harm. If the centaurs believe

that their guests are acting out of simple ignorance or care-

lessness, they confront the strangers and deliver them a warn-

ing to change their ways. But if the centaurs see these people

acting maliciously against their people or the forest, the noble

creatures attack without warning and without mercy.

Most centaurs who take up adventuring are young mares or

stallions looking for a bit of adventure in their lives before they

settle down. Perhaps theyre hoping to find a mate from a tribe

other  than  their  own.  Sometimes,  centaurs  who  lose  their

spouses or families take up wandering about the world to distract

them from their grief.

132

MINOR RACES

CENTAUR CHARACTERS

A centaurs favored class is ranger. Their closeness to the lands

in  which  they  live  makes  taking  up  this  class  an  easy  choice.

However,  there  are  nearly  as  many  bards  and  druids  in  their

tribes. Centaurs enjoy their music almost as much as their woods.

Prestige Classes: Centaurs can become arcane archers, mem-

bers  of  a  prestige  class  normally  reserved  for  elves  and  half-

elves. They do not have any special prestige classes of their own.

Centaur Society

Centaur stallions may be hunters, but the mares actually run the

tribe and supplement the local food supply with cultivated pro-

duce. They also bring some less common goods into their com-

munities through trade. They pay with treasure stripped from

the monsters or people who have been foolish enough to chal-

lenge them. They dont care to trade with humans, as centaurs

consider  them  basically  untrustworthy.  They  deal  freely  with

elves, however, mostly for elven foods and wines.

Centaurs are massive creatures, and they eat and drink a lot.

Unfortunately, they are notoriously wild drunks, given to high-

spirited rampages when overindulging. Noncentaurs should note

that  although  centaurs  have  generally  wonderful  senses  of

humor,  they  are  sensitive  about  their  physiology.  They  take

direct  offense  at  any  horse  jokes.  (The  horses  dont  tell  us

human jokes, you know. Nor do they ask if they can climb on

our backs!) While centaurs can give most humanoids a ride in

times  of  needand  are  often  willing  to  offer  such  assistance

when  its  neededthey  are  offended  when  asked  to  perform

this service. They are noble and intelligent creatures, not beasts

of burden, and they are touchy about anyone even insinuating

otherwise.

Centaurs mate for life. Once they promise themselves to each

other, centaurs are always faithful, even should one of the pair

die. Divorce is unknown among these people.

Young  centaurs  are  encouraged  to  play  freely,  and  they

mostly do so by running wild through the forests that make up

their homes. As centaurs grow up, they are gradually asked to

share  more  and  more  of  the  tribes  duties.  When  a  centaur

reaches the age of five, she officially becomes an adult, and the

tribe hosts a large party to celebrate. Centaurs gallop in from

miles around to eat, drink, and race.

As centaurs get older, they start to slow down. Eventually,

when  its  their  turn  to  die,  they  drift  off  into  the  woods  and

expire peacefully and privately, offering their bodies up for the

creatures of the forest to consume, just as they have consumed

so many such creatures during their own lives.

Outside  the  tribe,  most  centaurs  work  alone,  confident  in

their ability to handle most situations. They are often happy to

join up with a band of adventurers, especially if there are any

elves in it. They know that they are unschooled in the ways of

civilization  and  are  always  happy  to  be  given  a  hand  dealing

with such situations.

Language and Literacy

Centaurs  speak  Sylvan  among  themselves,  and  most  have

learned enough Common to be able to converse with any who

might  impinge  on  the  borders  of  their  territory.  After  that,

those centaurs inclined to pick up another tongue usually learn

Elven so that they can easily trade with their favorite non-cen-

taur people. They might also learn Orc or Draconian so they can

properly threaten their most hated foes.

Centaurs are illiterate, except for those with player character

classes other than barbarian.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Centaurs have the following racial traits:

+8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, 2 Intelligence, +2

Wisdom. Centaurs are literally as strong, fast, and healthy as

the proverbial horse. While they may not have a great deal of

formal knowledge, their practical experience in the wild serves

them well.

Large: As large creatures, centaurs suffer a 1 size penalty on

attack  rolls  and  Armor  Class.  They  also  suffer  a  4  size

penalty on Hide checks. However, they can use larger weapons

than  humans  can,  and  their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are

twice those of Medium-size characters.

Centaur face is 10 feet, with a reach of 5 feet.

Centaur land speed is 50 feet.

Darkvision up to 60 feet.

Proficient with all simple weapons, the longsword, the heavy

lance, and the composite longbow.

+2 natural armor.

Monstrous Humanoid Hit Dice: A centaur has 4d8 racial Hit

Dice. A centaur character receives the maximum hit points for

her  first  monstrous  humanoid  Hit  Die,  and  rolls  her  other

monstrous humanoid Hit Dice normally. She rolls all Hit Dice

from class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit

points on her first class level Hit Die. A centaurs monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  also  provide  a  +4  base  attack  bonus  and

saving throws of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4. Centaurs with

class  levels  add  their  class  attack  bonus  and  save  bonuses  to

their racial attack bonus and saves.

Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A centaurs monstrous humanoid

Hit Dice grant her skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, mini-

mum 1) 7. Class skills for these skill points are Hide, Listen,

Move Silently, Spot, and Survival. A centaur does not get the 4

multiplier for skill points acquired from her first class level.

Monstrous Humanoid Feats: A centaurs monstrous humanoid

Hit Dice grant her 2 feats. A typical centaur chooses Weapon

Focus  (hoof)  and  Improved  Natural  Armor.  A  centaur  with

class levels gains feats based on his total Hit Dice, as shown on

Table 2 in the Introduction.

Natural  Attacks:  A  centaur  may  make  2  hoof  attacks,  each

dealing  1d6  points  of  damage  plus  the  centaurs  Strength

bonus. A centaur can attack with a weapon in her hands at her

normal  attack  bonus,  and  make  2  hoof  attacks  as  secondary

attacks (5 penalty on the attack roll, and half Strength bonus

on the damage roll).

Automatic Languages: Common, Sylvan, home region. Bonus

Languages: By region.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Level Adjustment: +3. Due to her racial HD, plus her size and

phenomenal physical ability, a centaur has an effective char-

acter level of 7 plus her class levels. Thus, a 3rd-level centaur

ranger  would  have  an  ECL  of  10.  See  Table  1  in  the  Intro-

duction for more information.

133

MINOR RACES

Centaur Magic and Lore

Centaurs have no special spells exclusive to their race. Centaur

arcane  spellcasters  prefer  evocation  and  transmutation  spells,

since these allow them to affect both intruders and the weather,

two constant worries in any centaurs life.

CENTAUR MAGIC ITEMS

Centaurs  can  often  make  use  of  magic  items  intended  for

horses. For instance, they can directly benefit from horseshoes

of speed and horseshoes of the zephyr. They may also use magi-

cal boots or shoes on their front or rear pair of hooves (while

the  items  do  alter  to  fit  the  centaurs  hooves,  they  look

strange). Centaurs may wear gloves and similar items on their

arms like any other humanoid. A centaur is still limited to one

pair of boots, one pair of gloves, and so on, despite having an

extra pair of limbs.

Centaurs cannot wear humanoid armor, but may wear magi-

cal  barding.  Barding  costs  four  times  as  much  as  humanoid

armor of the same type, but can be made magical or masterwork

at  the  normal  cost.  For  example,  +1  studded  leather  barding

costs 1,000 gp for the magic portion of the item, 150 gp for the

masterwork price, and 100 gp for four times the normal cost of

studded leather armor, for a total of 1,250 gp.

Centaur Deities

Centaurs are not terribly devout. Most of their religious leaders

are druids, who also serve as the tribal leaders. When centaurs

choose  a  patron  deity,  it  is  almost  invariably  Silvanus.  They

share  the  Oak  Fathers  love  for  the  deep  forests  and  mighty

trees  of  Faern  and,  like  Silvanus,  are  not  afraid  to  confront

those who would injure the forests. Less often, centaurs choose

members of the elven pantheon as patrons, such as Angharradh,

Rillifane Rallathil, or Solonor Thelandira.

Relations with Other Races

Centaurs dont mind sharing territory with elves. In fact, the

two races can even be said to be friendly with each other. How-

ever, centaurs do not hold other races in such high regard. They

tolerate  halflings  and  gnomes,  who  are  rarely  a  threat  to  the

centaurs and are well known for their deep and abiding respect

for nature. Centaurs dont care for humans or dwarves at all;

when such people intrude upon a centaurs home, they are asked

to leave, politely but forcefully.

Orcs, kobolds, and goblinoids, have earned an especially cold

place in a centaurs heart. Most centaurs would not even con-

sider parleying with these races, and attack them on sight.

Centaur Equipment

Centaurs prefer to use greatclubs, heavy lances, and mighty com-

posite longbows. They also wear specialized centaur barding that

is a combination of a standard suit of humanoid armor and stan-

dard barding. This costs four times what a Medium-size suit of

normal armor costs, and it weighs twice as much.

Medium or heavy barding reduces a centaurs speed to 35 ft.

When wearing heavy barding, a centaur can only move triple its

normal rate instead of quadruple when using the Run action.

Removing or donning centaur barding takes five times as long

as  removing  or  donning  normal  humanoid  armor.  See  Table

76: Donning Armor on page 105 of the Players Handbook

for details.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Centaurs do not raise domestic animals for food or as beasts of

burden. They are friendly with all sorts of woodland animals,

but they generally do not keep pets.

Goblinoid

Regions: Anaurach, Chult, Cormyr, Moonsea, the North, Vaasa,

the Vast, Western Heartlands.

Level Adjustment: Varies; see below.

Goblinoids are a group of humanoid races that includes four dif-

ferent subraces in Faern: goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, and the

relatively  new  Dekanter  goblins.  These  creatures  are  close

enough in outlook and society to discuss as a group. They are

closely related by ties of language and culture.

Goblins are the smallest of the group. They stand only about

four feet tall and weigh roughly 60 pounds. Like all goblinoids,

they have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths, and

sharp fangs. Their arms hang down almost to their knees. Goblin

hides  range  in  color  from  yellow  through  orange  to  red,  and

members of the same tribe usually share similar coloring. Gob-

lins wear dark leather clothing, which is usually heavily soiled

due to their lack of concern with hygiene.

Hobgoblins are much larger, usually reaching 6 1/2 feet in

height and weighing up to 275 pounds. Their hairy hides come

in dark shades ranging from reddish-brown to gray. Their eyes

are  yellowish  or  dark  brown,  and  their  teeth  are  yellow  and

strong. They like to wear bright clothing, usually red with black

leather. They keep their weapons clean, even if they dont take

so much care with themselves.

The largest of the goblinoids, bugbears stand about 7 feet tall

and  often  top  300  pounds.  Their  hides  are  usually  yellowish,

ranging  from  brownish  to  mustard  yellow.  Their  coarse  hair

runs from brown to brick red. Their eyes are green-white with

crimson pupils, and their ears are more wedge-shaped than those

of their smaller kin.

Dekanter  goblins  were  created  from  regular  goblins  by  the

alhoon (illithid lich) known as the Beast Lord in the mines of

Dekanter.  They  are  larger  than  the  race  from  which  they

sprang, ranging in height from 4 to 5 feet. Their tough hides are

orange-red, and they have manes of wiry black hair that tumble

down past their shoulders. Their heads squat atop thick, power-

ful necks, and they have a sharp, rhinolike horn at the tip of

their elongated snouts.

Whatever the subrace, goblinoids are universally bullies. They

pick on smaller creatures whenever they can, and when faced

with  a  superior  force  they  turn  tail  and  run.  Because  of  their

smaller size, goblins prefer to strike from ambush, using every

fighting trick they know to gain an edge. While tactically canny,

the larger hobgoblins and bugbears usually prefer a more direct

approach, often driving weaker troops before them into any per-

ceived danger.

MINOR RACES

Dekanter  goblins,  in  contrast,  are  aggressive  and  fearless.

They  never  met  a  foe  they  didnt  want  to  impale  on  their

horns.  They  are  cunning  enough  to  not  charge  directly  into

battle against a clearly superior foe, but they rarely run away

from a fight.

Goblinoids are all short-lived. Most meet a violent end long

before they reach old age. They are pressed into service as adults

at  just  10  years  of  age.  They  rarely  live  to  be  older  than  40,

although some few lucky or wily individuals have been known to

make it to 60 years of age.

Goblinoids have the same life expectancy and age categories

as half-orcs.

Outlook

Life  in  a  goblinoid  community  is  cheap.  There  are  always  a

dozen people behind you, trying to trip you up, ready to take

over your place as soon as you fall. Goblinoid leaders rule through

aggressive ruthlessness, bullying any who get in their way and

killing those who are foolhardy enough to challenge them. Gob-

linoids are constantly trying to get ahead of each other, mostly

by backstabbing those in front of them.

Of  course,  goblins  lack  the  strength  and  ferocity  to  lord  it

over hobgoblins. Similarly, hobgoblins are usually at the mercy

of bugbears. The differences in size between the races are too

great to overcome. A group of smaller goblinoids can sometimes

band together to overpower a larger cousin, but they often end

up betraying each other to the bigger creature. Even should they

succeed in their efforts, the smaller creatures regularly fall to

squabbling among each other as to who is now in charge, and

another of the larger goblinoids often arrives on the scene to

put an end to the argument by killing off any who might lay

claim to such leadership.

Dekanter goblins, on the other hand, live only to serve their

creator,  the  Beast  Lord.  They  are  the  terror  of  the  Dekanter

mines, mostly because of the alhoons cunning in his command

of  them.  Originally,  these  creatures  only  guarded  the  Beast

Lords  domain.  Today,  however,  they  have  begun  ranging  far

and wide, perhaps signaling that the alhoon has larger schemes

to execute.

Most  goblinoids  take  up  lives  as  adventurers  simply  to  get

away from their clans. Some do this solely for reasons of sur-

vival,  sure  that  they  would  be  killed  if  they  were  to  remain.

Others  believe  that  if  they  can  find  real  power  in  the  wider

world, they can then return to their homeland and take over.

GOBLINOID CHARACTERS

Living by their wits rather than their muscles, goblins favor the

rogue  class.  The  more  combat-oriented  individuals  sometimes

multiclass as fighter/rogues. Goblin tribes also feature the occa-

sional cleric, who stands aside from the standard pecking order.

Hobgoblins  depend  on  their  physical  impressiveness  to  cow

both friend and foe, so they favor the fighter class. The more

cunning ones multiclass as fighter/rogues.

Bugbears favor the rogue class, because treachery figures at

least  as  much  into  their  success  as  does  their  power  in  battle.

Many bugbears multiclass as fighter/rogues, and a rare few serve

their clan as clerics.

Dekanter goblins are basically killing machines, so they favor

the barbarian class. They value strength and ferocity in battle

too much to take up less militant pursuits.

MINOR RACES

Goblinoid Society

Goblinoid society is a difficult one in which to grow up. Simply

surviving  to  adulthood  takes  a  combination  of  luck,  careful

planning, and ruthless aggression. The golden rule among gob-

lins is to do unto others before they do unto you.

Goblinoid children establish a pecking order much like that of

their  parents.  The  older  and  larger  ones  pick  on  the  smaller

ones, honing the bullying skills which will serve them well later

as adults. In goblinoid communities, there are as many children

around as there are adults. The reasons for this are many, but

they boil down to two unavoidable facts. First, most goblinoids

dont  survive  their  harsh  childhoods.  Second,  many  adults  die

violent deaths before they advance too far in goblinoid society.

Males have almost all the power in goblinoid society. They

support their clan by constantly raiding other communities and

stealing their treasure, food, and drink. When supplies are short,

goblinoids have been known to slaughter and eat members of

other races, even including smaller goblinoids.

Females are expected to stay home and raise as many young

goblins  as  possible.  They  are  not  permitted  to  join  the  clans

warriors in their hunts or in battle. For this reason, many gob-

linoid adventurers are females who left their clans looking for

better opportunities from life.

There  is  no  sense  of  privacy  in  most  goblinoid  clans.  Most

clans live in a large, communal area, often a cave. Only the lead-

ers of the clan have the privilege of keeping their own quarters.

These leaders like to limit such privacy, as they fear that those

they cannot see might use the opportunity to plot betrayal. This

goes on all the time anyhow, but its more difficult to accom-

plish in the common chambers, since many goblinoids are only

too  happy  to  sell  out  any  mutineers  in  exchange  for  winning

their leaders favor.

Its rare for a goblinoid to reach a ripe old age. At the first

sign of weakness, older goblinoids are constantly challenged by

their younger kin, one right after another. Eventually youth and

persistence wins out over age and treachery.

Outside their home territories, most goblinoids try to repli-

cate the conditions under which they were raised. They look for

weaker people and bully them into joining up with a nascent

clan.  Even  goblinoids  who  have  renounced  their  native  clans

and become adventurers often fall back into old habits, given

the chance.

Language and Literacy

Most  goblins  speak  only  Goblin.  Smarter  ones  often  speak

Common  as  well,  as  do  those  who  become  adventurers.  Hob-

goblins  and  bugbears  speak  both  Goblin  and  Commonthey

have more need to, as they are often in charge of bossing around

other creatures and need to be able to speak to the creatures they

enslave.  Dekanter  goblins  speak  Goblin  and  Undercommon,

since they spend most of their lives in the depths of the Dekan-

ter mines.

Goblinoids of all sorts are illiterate, except for those who have

player character classes other than barbarian.

bear character receives the maximum hit points for his first

humanoid Hit Die and rolls his other humanoid Hit Dice nor-

mally.  He  rolls  all  Hit  Dice  from  class  levels  and  does  not

automatically get maximum hit points on his first class-level

Hit  Die.  A  bugbears  racial  Hit  Dice  also  provide  a  +2  base

two feats. A typical bugbear chooses Alertness and Weapon

Focus (morningstar). A bugbear with class levels gains feats

based  on  his  total  Hit  Dice,  as  shown  on  Table  2  in  the

Introduction.

Automatic Languages: Common, Goblin, home region. Bonus

Languages: By home region.

Favored Class: Rogue.

Level Adjustment: +1. Due to his racial Hit Dice and physical

ability bonuses, a bugbear has an effective character level of 4

plus  his  class  levels.  Thus,  a  3rd-level  bugbear  rogue  would

have an ECL of 7. See Table 1 in the Introduction.

Dekanter goblins have the following racial traits:

+6 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2

Wisdom,  2  Charisma.  Physically  powerful  and  cunning,

racial Hit Dice. He receives the maximum hit points for his

first  monstrous  humanoid  Hit  Die  and  rolls  his  other  mon-

strous humanoid Hit Die normally. He rolls all Hit Dice from

class  levels  and  does  not  automatically  get  maximum  hit

points  on  his  first  class  level  Hit  Die.  A  Dekanter  goblins

racial Hit Dice also provide a +2 base attack bonus and saving

throws of  Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +3. Dekanter goblins with

class  levels  add  their  class  attack  and  save  bonuses  to  their

racial attack bonus and saves.

Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A Dekanter goblins monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  him  skill  points  equal  to  (2  +  Int

modifier, minimum 1) 5. Class skills for these skill points are

Climb,  Intimidate,  Jump,  Listen,  Sense  Motive,  and  Spot.  A

Dekanter goblin does not get the 4 multiplier for skill points

acquired from his first class level.

Monstrous Humanoid Feats: A Dekanter goblins monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  him  one  feat.  A  typical  Dekanter

goblin  chooses  Power  Attack.  A  Dekanter  goblin  with  class

levels  gains  feats  based  on  his  total  Hit  Dice,  as  shown  on

Table 2 in the Introduction.

Natural Attacks: A Dekanter goblin can attack with his horn

and  2  claws.  The  horn  deals  1d6  points  of  damage  plus  the

characters Strength bonus, with 3 damage on a critical hit.

The  claws  are  secondary  attacks  (5  penalty  on  attack  rolls,

and half Strength bonus on damage rolls), and deal 1d4 points

of  damage.  The  character  can  attack  with  a  weapon  at  his

normal attack bonus, and make a horn or single claw attack as

a secondary attack.

Automatic  Languages:  Goblin,  Undercommon,  Common.

Bonus Languages: By region.

Favored Class: Barbarian.

Level Adjustment: +4. Due to his racial Hit Dice plus his ability

bonuses,  fast  healing  ability,  natural  weapons,  and  cold  resist-

ance,  a  Dekanter  goblin  has  an  effective  character  level  of  6

plus his class levels. Thus, a 5th-level Dekanter goblin barbarian

would have an ECL of 11. See Table 1 in the Introduction.

Goblinoid Deities

Goblinoids worship a number of evil deities. These gods  often

exhort their followers to overbreed as much as possible and then

attempt to overrun their foes with superior numbers. This is one

reason why life is considered so cheap in goblinoid clans. Goblins,

hobgoblins, and even Dekanter goblins worship Maglubiyet, god

of  goblinkind.  They  are  inspired  by  the  legendary  tales  of  his

strength  and  treachery  winning  out  over  all.  The  god  of  bug-

bears, Hruggek, coaches his followers in the art of the ambush

and furious fighting.

Relations with Other Races

Goblinoids do not get along well with each other, much less any

other races. They dont even particularly like members of other

goblinoid subraces. Of the standard character races, goblinoids

favor half-orcs best, mostly because goblinoids are used to work-

ing  with  orcs  upon  occasion,  usually  under  the  command  of

some bugbear warlord.

Goblinoids all harbor a special hatred of elves and dwarves,

and  many  attack  them  on  sight.  The  rare  good-  or  neutral-

aligned  goblinoid  character  struggles  to  control  this  urge  and

usually wins out over it.

Goblinoid Equipment

Bugbears  and  hobgoblins  often  use  a  special  weapon  called  a

goblin stick (see the appendix).

ANIMALS AND PETS

Goblinoids  dont  keep  pets.  To  them,  such  creatures  are  for

slaughtering and eating. They often steal livestock from their

neighbors  and  may  keep  goats,  sheep,  or  cattle  for  a  short

time, but they are in the habit of eating their loot at the first

opportunity.

Goblins have a special relationship with worgs, and often ride

worgs  into  battle.  The  evil  wolves  are  the  goblins  allies,  not

their servants.

Kir-Lanan

Regions: The North, Western Heartlands.

Racial  Feats: Flyby  Attack  (see  Monster  Manual),  Hover

(dragon feat; see Monster Manual), Improved Flight, Wing-

over (dragon feat; see Monster Manual).

Racial Hit Dice: 4d8

Level Adjustment: +4

Falsely labeled gargoyles by some, kir-lanans are actually crea-

tures who arrived on Faern during the Time of Troubles (1358

DR).  They  have  made  it  their  mission  to  destroy  the  gods  of

Toril by first executing all who believe in them. In a world in

which religion plays a central part in the lives of so many people,

137

MINOR RACES

this is a no small task. It essentially calls for the murder of just

about every person on the face of the planet.

Kir-lanans are only vaguely similar to true gargoyles. They

have  a  humanoid  form  and  large,  batlike  wings.  They  stand

about  6  feet  tall  and  weigh  around  220  pounds.  Their  finely

scaled hides are all dark in color, normally ranging from mid-

night blue through deep purple to black. Some rare individuals

come in deep crimson, emerald, dun, or gray colors instead. They

all  have  mouths  full  of  sharp,  pointed  teeth,  and  they  have

small, blunt horns just above their temples. They eschew tradi-

tional clothing, instead binding their torsos with cloth wrappings

interwoven with strips of metal, ivory, or stone.

Kir-lanan have no established life expectancy or age cat-

egories, as the oldest members of the race are

only  about  15  years  of  age.  They  are

fully grown within one year of birth, and

as yet show no signs of deterioration from

aging. How long their lifespans are likely

to be, none can say.

History

Even the most learned souls of Faern

have few clues as to the true nature of

kir-lanans.  All  they  know  for  sure  is

that  the  creatures  are  bent  upon

killing off priests and other divine ser-

vantsor  godslaves,  as  the  kir-

lanans  call  themas  quickly  as

possible. The kir-lanans are the source

of a great deal of rumor in Faern these

days. Anywhere there squats a stone gar-

goyle,  people  whisper  that  its  actually

one of these evil beasts watching silently

over  a  town,  waiting  for  its  brethren  to

arrive so they can strike. These creatures are

reputed to have all sorts of powers, including

a  complete  immunity  to  magic  (not  true)  and

the  ability  to  drain  the  strength  from  their  foes

(true at least in part).

the gods of Toril. In the years since their arrival in Faern, the

kir-lanans have made good on their plans to wreak terror in the

hearts of those who have promised their souls to the gods. They

originally  started  with  raids  on  clerics  and  adepts  and  their

houses of worship, but in recent years they have extended their

horrific  campaign  to  include  all  worshipers  in  those  temples,

churches, or chapels. The threat the kir-lanans pose to the people

of Faern grows every day.

Outlook

Kir-lanans dont care much for lifetheir own or that of

anyone else. They exist solely to cause misery for

the gods and those who call upon these feckless

and fickle deities.

Kir-lanans  are  born  in  secluded  rook-

eries  and  raised  by  all  the  adult  kir-

lanans who call the place home. They

come  into  the  world  only  three

months  after  conception,  and  they

are  fully  grown  within  a  matter  of

only one year. During this painfully

short  childhood,  these  new  kir-

lanans  are  indoctrinated  in  the

hatred that their elders hold for the

gods. By the time these new adults

are  ready  to  stretch  their  wings,

they  bear  as  much  hatred  toward

the deities who have damned them

as any other kir-lanan.

Some  rare  kir-lanans  do  not

spend  their  days  slaughtering  the

followers  of  the  gods.  Instead,  they

observe  the  actions  of  the  people  of

Faern  from  a  distance,  hoping  to

learn  their  strengths  and  weaknesses.

They  then  bring  this  newfound  knowl-

edge  back  to  their  people  so  that  the  kir-

lanans can figure out a better way to murder

people more efficiently.

Kir-lanan

There are several credible theories as to where the kir-

lanans come from. The most popular is that the creatures hail

from  another  world  or  plane  composed  entirely  of  negative

energy, but in truth the kir-lanans sprang whole from the inef-

fable energies unleashed by the death of three gods: Bane, Bhaal,

and Myrkul. This trio of ill-fated deities were slain during the

Time  of  Troubles,  and  their  passing  manifested  itself  in  a

number of various destructive acts. Some of that energy didnt

simply dissipate as the dead deities passed from Toril. Instead, it

coalesced in some deep, secret chamber into a seething ball of

furious chaos. The first of the kir-lanans erupted from this dan-

gerous sphere, fully formed and aware of its terrible origins. Sev-

eral hundred kir-lanans came into being in this way. However,

due to the manner of their creation, they were forsaken by the

gods, and they knew it. They were doomed to never be able to

gain the favor of the divine and pass into the afterlife. Instead,

their deaths would literally be the end of them.

Angered by this painful fact, the soulless kir-lanans decided

that  if  the  gods  were  to  condemn  them  outright,  then  they

would  do  the  same  to  the  gods.  Unable  to  directly  match  the

power of the gods, the creatures decided to instead attack the

deities in the only way they could: through those who worshiped

KIR-LANAN CHARACTERS

Kir-lanans  favor  the  fighter  class,  as  thisalong  with  their

innate abilitiesgives them the chance to do the most damage

to  the  largest  number  of  hapless  believers  at  any  given  time.

Spells run out, but claws keep killing forever. They most often

multiclass  as  fighter/sorcerers  or  fighter/necromancers.  They

can manipulate arcane energies just fine, and their nature lends

itself to handling negative energies.

Kir-Lanan Society

Life as a kir-lanan is relentlessly harsh. They exist only to kill,

to breed, and to learn how to become better at killing. Both male

and  females  are  treated  equally  in  kir-lanan  society.  This  is  a

meritocracy. The strongest rule, no matter who they are.

Most kir-lanans wander about the world in wings of two to

five creatures. These wings rarely have a stable roster, with kir-

lanans joining and leaving as the mood suits them. The leaders

of these wings are chosen by combat, and those who are not the

138

MINOR RACES

leaders constantly jockey to be in the right position to challenge

the leader the moment she leaves herself vulnerable. Wings of

kir-lanans  mount  their  operations  out  of  breeding  grounds

known  as  rookeries.  At  certain  times  of  the  yearbased  on  a

schedule  of  which  only  the  kir-lanans  are  awareindividual

members of a wing leave their fellows and travel back to their

rookeries to breed.

Other than the members of these wings, there are two others

positions in kir-lanan culture: the valrak and the kivar. Both of

these  vocations  stand  outside  the  traditional  structure  of  the

wing, allowing the valraks and kivars to avoid the normal rivalry

for leadership that causes so many of the wings to waste time and

energy  on  internal  struggles.  The  attention  of  the  kir-lanans

would be better spent on taking the battle to the believers, and

its the duty of the valraks and kivars to help direct this.

The  word  valrak  means  eye  in  the  guttural  kir-lanan

tongue.  These  creatures  travel  around  Faern  individually,

watching the native peoples and learning everything they can

about them and their rich and complex history. By doing this,

the valraks free up the others to cause as much destruction as

they can, while the valraks scout out new victims and locations.

Kivar, on the other hand, means voice. The kivars are a com-

bination of morale officers and strategic planners for the kir-

lanans.  Although  they  spend  most  of  their  time  in  the  field,

exhorting the wings to attempt greater and more terrible acts

of destruction, when back at the rookery the kivars gather to

absorb  and  discuss  the  information  gathered  by  the  valraks.

They use this to guide the kir-lanan campaign against the gods.

Kivars also are the ones who negotiate temporary alliances with

other groups of people who are less devout in their worship of

the gods. Of course, once these allies have served their purposes,

they are to be murdered as well, but the kivars are willing to let

them serve their purpose for a time.

New kir-lanans are born in these rookeries and raised by the

kivars. Once they are one year or so in age, they are released into

the wild and sent to join up with a new wing or to reinforce an

old one. No one knows what happens to kir-lanans as they get

older. The eldest ones are only 15 years old, and many of those

who  were  part  of  the  races  creation  have  been  killed  off  by

either their intended victims or in leadership challenges.

Language and Literacy

Kir-lanans  speak  their  own  harsh  language  (Kir-lanan)  and

Common.  When  speaking  with  each  other,  they  stick  to  Kir-

lanan, but they use thickly accented Common to converse with

everyone else. Some valraks actually pick up several other lan-

guages (its hard to learn a great deal about a people whose lan-

guage you dont understand).

Kir-lanans  dont  normally  talk  a  great  deal.  They  prefer

action to words.

All kir-lanans are literate, except for barbarians.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Kir-lanans have the following racial traits:

+4  Strength,  +2  Dexterity,  2  Wisdom.  Strong  and  fast,  kir-

lanans  dont  bother  much  with  keeping  in  touch  with  the

world around them. They usually prefer the direct approach to

most problems.

Medium-size:  As  Medium-size  creatures,  kir-lanans  have  no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Kir-lanan land speed is 30 feet. Their fly speed is 90 feet, with

good maneuverability.

Darkvision 60 feet.

+3 natural armor.

+4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Proficient with all simple weapons and light armor.

Monstrous Humanoid Hit Dice: A kir-lanan has 4d8 racial Hit

Dice. A kir-lanan character receives the maximum hit points

for her first monstrous humanoid Hit Die and rolls her other

monstrous humanoid Hit Dice normally. She rolls all Hit Dice

from class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit

points on her first class-level Hit Die. A kir-lanans racial Hit

Dice also provide a +4 base attack bonus and saving throws of

Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4. Kir-lanans with class levels add

their class attack bonus and saves to their racial attack bonus

and saving throws.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Skills:  A  kir-lanans  monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  her  skill  points  equal  to  (2  +  Int

modifier, minimum 1) 7. Class skills for these skill points are

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Listen,  Move  Silently,  Spot,  and  Use

Magic Device. A kir-lanan does not get the 4 multiplier for

skill points acquired from her first class level.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Feats:  A  kir-lanans  monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  her  2  feats.  A  typical  kir-lanan

chooses Flyby Attack and Weapon Focus (claw). A kir-lanan

with  class  levels  gains  feats  based  on  her  total  Hit  Dice,  as

shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.

Natural Attacks: A kir-lanan can attack with 2 claws, dealing

1d4 points of damage each. A kir-lanan can attack with a one-

handed weapon at her normal attack bonus and make a claw

attack as a secondary attack (5 penalty on the attack roll, and

half Strength bonus on the damage roll).

Negative Energy Touch (Su): Three times per day, a kir-lanan

can use a touch attack similar to the chill touch spell. If she hits

with a melee touch attack, she deals 2d6 points of damage and

1 point of temporary Strength damage. A Fortitude save (DC

12 + Cha modifier) negates the Strength damage. The kir-lanan

heals the same number of points of damage as she deals with

this attack, although she cannot exceed her normal maximum

hit points. The kir-lanan can use this power in conjunction with

a claw attack, but she must hit with a melee attack to do so. She

does not regain hit points for the claw damage she deals.

Ray  of  Enfeeblement (Sp):  Three  times  per  day,  a  kir-lanan

can use ray of enfeeblement as if the spell had been cast by a

4th-level sorcerer.

Rebuke  Undead  (Su):  A  kir-lanan  can  rebuke  or  command

undead three times per day as an evil cleric with as many levels

as the kir-lanan has Hit Dice.

Harmed by Positive Energy: A kir-lanan suffers damage from

cure wounds spells, holy water, and blessed weapons just as if

she were undead. Conversely, she is healed by inflict wounds

spells and other applications of negative energy. Kir-lanans

are  not  undead,  but  their  bodies  are  infused  with  negative

energy. They cannot be turned, but they are uncomfortable

around  such  displays  and  usually  seek  to  avoid  a  turning

cleric anyhow.

Soulless: Kir-lanans cannot become clerics, druids, or paladins,

and they cannot use positive energy of any kind. They cannot

ever  use  divine  magic.  They  may  become  rangers,  but  they

never gain that classs spellcasting abilities. A kir-lanan bard,

139

MINOR RACES

however,  can  learn  inflict  wounds spells  instead  of  cure

wounds spells. Since kir-lanan dont have souls, they can only

be brought back from the dead with a wish or miracle spell,

just like an outsider.

Automatic  Languages:  Kir-Lanan,  Common.  Bonus  Lan-

Regions: Chessenta, Chondalwood, Chult, Lake of Steam, Nelanther

guages: By region.

Favored Class: Fighter.

Level Adjustment: +4. Due to her 4 racial Hit Dice and her

supernatural  and  spell-like  abilities,  a  kir-lanan  has  an  effec-

tive character level of 8 plus her class levels. Thus, a 7th-level

kir-lanan fighter would have an ECL of 15. See Table 1 in

the Introduction.

Kir-Lanan

Magic and Lore

Kir-lanans have no special racial

spells  of  their  own.  As  spell-

casters,  kir-lanans  can  only

manipulate  arcanenever

divinemagic.  They  prefer

spells that destroy and corrupt

the soul, particularly necroman-

tic  spells.  As  creatures  of  nega-

tive  energy,  they  have  an

affinity for death magic.

Kir-Lanan

Deities

Kir-lanans  have  no  deities,  although

some kivars advocate striking a tem-

porary  alliance  with  worshipers  of

Shar.  They  appreciate  this  gods

desire to wage war on the other gods,

so  they  feel  that  they  could

work  together  for  as  long  as

their interests coincide. Once the

other gods are gone, though, Shar is sure to be the

next target on the kir-lanans list.

Kir-lanans hate all the gods and the people who worship them.

They have some tolerance for those who simply pay lip service

to the gods, but in the end the kir-lanans want to murder these

people too. People who renounce the gods entirely might be able

to  work  with  the  kir-lanans  without  fear  of  betrayal,  but  by

doing so they put their souls in mortal peril.

Relations with Other Races

Kir-lanans want to kill everyone. They dont particularly target

one race over another. However, the more pious a person is, the

more likely it is that he may feel the kir-lanans wrath. Piety is

measured by a characters observations of religious rites and zeal

in his deitys service, not his alignment. The valraks take this

into  account  when  they  report  their  observations  and  suggest

possible victims for kir-lanan wing raids. In cases in which the

valraks report a particularly important target, the kivars can

sometimes coordinate a multi-wing attack, bringing dozens of

kir-lanans to bear on the problem at once.

Living  mostly  in  the  marshy  areas  of  Faern,  lizardfolk  are

large, scaly humanoids who are savage maraud-

ers and scavengers. They have no traditions for

cultivating  food,  so  they  arrange  their  meals

by either hunting prey or raiding the larders

of others.

Lizardfolk  grow  to  between  6  and  7

feet tall, and weigh between 200 and 250

pounds. Their scales range in color from

dark  green  to  gray  to  brown.  Their

thickly  muscled  tails  run  from  3  to  4

feet  long.  Most  nonlizardfolk  have  a

very hard time telling the difference

between males and females, but the

lizardfolk  have  no  such  troubles,

of course.

Lizardfolk  young  are  hatched

from eggs, which are carefully pro-

tected in the tribes lair. This is usu-

ally hidden deep in a swamp, but

about a third of the time its

an air-filled underwater cave.

Hatchlings grow to maturity

within about five years. Lizard-

folk have been known to live as

long  as  80  years,  although  its

common  for  the  males  to  die  in

combat  long  before  they  reach

such an august age.

In  Faern,  lizardfolk  are

found  anywhere  there  are  temperate  or

warm marshes and swamps. This includes the Deep-

wash, the Flooded Forest, the Marsh of Chelimber, the Marsh

of Tun, and Rethild, the Great Swamp. A large population of

lizardfolk is also found in the Lizard Marsh, despite the rela-

tively cold climate of the Sword Coast.

Lizardfolk have the same life expectancy and age categories

as humans.

History

Lizardfolk dont have anything in the way of a written history.

They  claim  that  they  were  among  the  first  of  the  humanoid

races and that all the weaker, more civilized races evolved from

lizardfolk  who  left  the  swamps  millennia  ago.  The  lizardfolk

look  down  on  the  other  races  for  this  reason,  seeing  them  as

weaklings who could not endure the rigors of life in the swamp.

In fact, there seems no reason to doubt that lizardfolk are an

offshoot of one of the Creator Races, the long-vanished saurians,

and  that  theirs  is  a  very  ancient  culture.  They  have  lived  in

much the same fashion they do now for time out of mind, since

long before any on the interloper races arrived on Toril.

MINOR RACES

Outlook

Lizardfolk mostly assess everything in terms of whether or not

it is good to eat. They have no use for money or jewels. They

fashion their own crude weapons from rocks, trees, and plants

found  in  their  wetland  homes.  If  something  might  be  worth

eating,  it  immediately  captures  the  interest  of  the  lizardfolk.

Otherwise, it is not worth bothering with.

Growing up in a lizardfolk tribe is hard. The young are often

hungry, as they are only giving the leavings of the meals the

males capture once the adults are done with them. They often

subsist on edible plants found nearby the tribes lair. Lizardfolk

are  omnivorous,  although  they  have  a  strong  preference  for

meat, and they find human flesh to be the tastiest of all.

Most  lizardfolk  dont  care  much  about  strategy  or  tactics.

They are cunning hunters, but in battle they simply rush their

foe and try to overwhelm him with their superior strength or

by  force  of  sheer  numbers.  When  the  lizardfolk  are  attacked,

however, they use their skill as hunters to lay snares, pitfalls,

and other traps for those who pursue  them. Simple but deadly

traps such as these protect many lizardfolk lairs.

Lizardfolk sometimes leave their homes to hunt for larger,

more  formidable  prey.  Others  wish  to  learn  more  about  the

world beyond the swamps, so that they can report back to the

leaders  of  their  tribes.  While  lizardfolk  arent  evil  by  nature,

they are savage, and they have a difficult time assimilating into

Faernian society. Most dont even try. They are there to learn

about the softskins and perhaps to teach them a thing or two

about how real peoplelizardfolk, that islive.

LIZARDFOLK CHARACTERS

Lizardfolk live close to the land, taking all the blessings that

nature has to offer them. For this reason, a lizardfolks favored

class is druid. They also have many barbarians and fighters in

their tribes, and the occasional cleric or two.

Lizardfolk Society

The lizardfolk have a patriarchal society. The strongest member

of the tribe rules over the others by virtue of his power alone.

Most are wise enough to recognize this power, so challenges only

happen  infrequently.  When  they  do,  they  entirely  disrupt  the

life of the tribe until either a new leader has been established or

the old one has reaffirmed his position.

Lizardfolk females concentrate on hatching eggs and rais-

ing the hatchlings. It is also their job to maintain the tribes

camp. Sometimes this is little more than bits of wet plants

the lizardfolk use for beds, but some tribes fashion crude huts

and make and use shields and weapons. Some have even learned

to  use  the  weapons  they  have  stripped  from  the  bodies  of

earlier prey.

Mothers  watch  over  their  hatchlings  closely.  In  this,  they

have the help of all female members of the tribe. The hatch-

lings are often hard to handle, prone to wandering out of the

camp and into the wider swamp. At any time, there are half as

many hatchlings as there are adults. In a typical camp of 150

lizardfolk, about 50 are adult males, 50 are adult females, and

50 are hatchlings.

As lizardfolk age, they slow down. Over the age of 60 or so,

they do not care to do much more than lie on a warm rock and

bask in the sun. When these creatures die, they are consumed by

the rest of the tribe at a ceremonial wake, their flesh becoming

part of the tribe both literally and figuratively.

When wandering outside their marshy territories, most lizard-

folk work in small groups of two to three. On rare occasions, one

can be found traveling alone. Normally, though, lizardfolk feel

the  need  to  have  at  least  one  other  lizardfolk  with  them  to

remind them at all times of who they are. Otherwise, they fear

that they might be seduced by the civilized ways of the outside

world and never return home.

Language and Literacy

Lizardfolk speak Draconic. The more intelligent ones sometimes

pick up Common, the better to frighten potential prey. More

rarely, they learn languages like Dwarven, Elven, Goblin, Orc,

or  the  language  of  neighboring  home  regions,  depending  on

where they live.

All  lizardfolk  are  illiterate,  except  for  those  who  have  a

player character class other than barbarian.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Lizardfolk have the following racial traits:

+2  Strength,  +2  Constitution,  2  Intelligence.  Strong  and

hardy warriors, lizardfolk place little value on the accumula-

tion of knowledge.

Medium-size:  As  Medium-size  creatures,  lizardfolk  have  no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Lizardfolk land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision 60 feet.

+5 natural armor.

Proficient with all simple weapons, shields, and barbed darts.

Lizardfolk  usually  stick  to  weapons  they  can  fashion  out  of

available materials.

+4 racial bonus on Balance, Jump, and Swim checks.

Humanoid Hit Dice: A lizardfolk has 2d8 racial Hit Dice. A

lizardfolk character receives the maximum hit points for his

first humanoid Hit Die and rolls his other humanoid Hit Dice

normally. He rolls all Hit Dice from class levels and does not

automatically get maximum hit points on his first class-level

Hit Die. A lizardfolks racial Hit Dice also provide a +1 base

attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will

+0. Lizardfolk with class levels add their class attack bonus and

save bonuses to their racial attack and save bonuses.

Humanoid Skills: A lizardfolks humanoid Hit Dice grant him

skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) 5. Class

skills  for  these  skill  points  are  Balance,  Jump,  and  Swim.  A

lizardfolk  does  not  get  the  4  multiplier  for  skill  points

acquired from his first class level.

Humanoid Feats: A lizardfolks humanoid Hit Dice grant him

one feat. A typical lizardfolk chooses Multiattack. A lizardfolk

character  with  class  levels  gains  feats  based  on  his  total  Hit

Dice, as shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.

Natural  Attacks:  A  lizardfolk  can  attack  with  2  claws  and  a

bite. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage, and the bite is a sec-

ondary attack (5 penalty on the attack roll, and half Strength

bonus on the damage roll) that deals 1d4 points of damage. A

lizardfolk can attack with a weapon at his normal attack bonus,

and make either a bite or a claw attack as a secondary attack.

MINOR RACES

Hold Breath: A lizardfolk can hold his breath for a number

of rounds equal to 4  Constitution score before he is at risk

of drowning.

Automatic  Languages:  Draconic,  home  region.  Bonus  Lan-

guages: Common, by region.

Favored Class: Druid.

Level Adjustment: +1. Due to his racial Hit Dice, his natural

attacks, and his racial skill bonuses, a lizardfolk has an effec-

tive character level of 3 plus his class levels. Thus, a 3rd-level

lizardfolk druid would have an ECL of 6. See Table 1 in the

Introduction.

Lizardfolk Deities

Lizardfolk worship Semuanya. Their clerics dont have true shrines

or sacred places, or hold regular services. Instead, they function as

shamans, bringing the blessings of Semuanya to the gods people

whenever they are called upon. The god of the lizardfolk is a source

of great pride for these creatures. This deity works hand in hand

with nature, which helps to explain the great number of lizardfolk

druids about. Those who grow up worshiping Semuanya find it easy

to make the leap to worshiping nature itself.

Relations with Other Races

The only relation most lizardfolk have with other races is that of

hunter to prey. The more civilized lizardfolk realize that the other

races may have something to teach them, and they are willing to

parley with themat least as long as their bellies are full. Lizard-

folk on empty stomachs are notoriously difficult to reason with.

Lizardfolk Equipment

Lizardfolk use a limited number of weapons, preferring to stick

to tools of war they can fashion by hand from readily available

materials. They do have one weapon unique to their race, how-

ever: the barbed dart (see the appendix).

ANIMALS AND PETS

Lizardfolk dont raise animals or keep pets. To them, such crea-

tures  are  for  stealing,  slaughtering,  and  eating.  On  rare  occa-

sions, lizardfolk druids use magic to enchant dinosaurs and ride

the mighty beasts into battle.

Lycanthropes

Regions: By base humanoid race or region.

Racial Feat: Improved Control Shape (see Monster Manual).

Level Adjustment: Varies; see below.

Lycanthropes arent a race, so much as a group of people whom

all suffer from a common curse. Lycanthropes have the ability

to change into animal or hybrid forms, and they sometimes do

so  involuntarily.  Any  kind  of  giant  or  humanoid  can  suffer

from  lycanthropy.  In  Faern,  the  following  kinds  of  lycan-

thropes  are  common:  Werebat,  werebear,  wereboar,  werecats,

werecrocodile, wererat, wereshark, weretiger, werewolf, and the

elven lythari, a special kind of werewolf. Each of these lycan-

thropes can transform from its normal humanoid form to that

of a particular animal or a hybrid form that is a cross between

the humanoid and the animal forms.

In  their  humanoid  forms,  lycanthropes  are  essentially  the

same  as  they  ever  were.  While  their  chances  to  die  a  violent

death have likely increased greatly, their natural life expectancy

is  the  same  as  it  was  before  they  became  lycanthropes.  Their

height,  weight,  and  other  physical  features  are  unchanged  as

well. In their animal forms, lycanthropes appear to be of an age

proportional to their human forms. In other words, an elderly

human  werewolf  in  her  wolf  form  looks  like  an  elderly  wolf,

despite the fact that a real wolf her age would have long been

dead.

There are, in fact, two kinds of lycanthropes: those who have

contracted the condition as a curse (afflicted lycanthropes), and

those who were born with it (natural lycanthropes). The child of

a natural lycanthrope is always a natural lycanthrope, but the

child of an afflicted lycanthrope is a normal example of his or

her race until puberty, at which point there is a 50% chance that

the child manifests lycanthropy as a natural lycanthrope.

Lycanthropes  have  the  same  life  expectancy  and  age  cate-

gories as characters of their base race.

History

Lycanthropy appears to have been a plague on Faern since its

earliest  days.  Some  say  that  Malar,  the  Beastlord,  created  the

first  lycanthropes  from  barbaric  human  tribes  thousands  of

years ago in order to infuse the race with the feral cunning and

strength of the predatory animals they admired. Others believe

that lycanthropy was a gift of the goddess Selne to human chil-

dren orphaned in the dangerous wilds, a blessing to help them

survive. From these ancient humans, old lycanthropic bloodlines

have descended through the ages, few in number but scattered

through all the wilderness of Faern.

Lycanthropes have no real racial history, since their story is

the story of an individual here, a family there, or more rarely

a pack of bloodthirsty marauders in another place. While evil

lycanthropes have slaughtered whole villages on occasion, and

good  lycanthropes  have  valiantly  defended  the  homes  of  the

innocent against evil raiders, lycanthropes have never assembled

in numbers greater than a few dozen, founded cities, or raised

kingdoms.

While most of Faerns lycanthrope bloodlines run in other-

wise human folk, lycanthropes of other races are not impossible.

Orc wereboars and goblin werewolves sometimes become fear-

some  champions  of  their  tribes.  Elven  werewolves  known  as

lythari are a race of natural lycanthropes whose origins go back

to the first elven explorations of Faern, and the good lythari

have lived among the moon elves and wood elves for thousands

of years.

Rumor  has  it  that  a  number  of  new  kinds  of  lycanthropes

have been found in Faern since the Time of Troubles. There

have  been  scattered  reports  of  werebison,  weredogs,  weredol-

phins, wereleopards, wereowls, and werepanthers.

Outlook

A  lycanthropes  outlook  is  usually  based  upon  its  life  in  its

humanoid  form.  However,  there  are  some  generalizations  that

can be made.

Natural lycanthropes rarely have a problem with their lycan-

thropy. They view their curse as a gift. These folk realize that

their lycanthropy makes them special, and many of them take up

careers as adventurers. If lycanthropy is feared or reviled in their

humanoid  culture,  they  may  feel  some  shame  for  being  so  dif-

ferent from those around them, but they rarely if ever wish to

be cured of their condition. Natural lycanthropes of evil align-

ment revel in their feral nature, and view themselves as stronger

MINOR RACES

The Lycanthrope Template

Lycanthrope  is  a  template  that  can  be  added  to  any

humanoid  or  giant  (referred  to  hereafter  as  the  character).

Becoming a lycanthrope is very much like multiclassing as an

animal and gaining the appropriate Hit Dice.

Size  and  Type: The  characters  type  does  not  change,  but  the

character gains the shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on

the characteristics of some creature of the Animal type (referred to

hereafter as the animal). This can be any predator, scavenger, or

omnivore whose size is within one step of the base creatures size

(Small to Large for a Medium-size base character). Lycanthropes

can also adopt a hybrid shape that combines features of the char-

acter and the animal. A lycanthropes hybrid form is the same size

as the animal form or base form, whichever is larger.

Hit Dice and Hit Points: Same as the character plus those of

the  animal.  To  calculate  total  hit  points,  apply  Constitution

modifiers  according  to  the  score  the  lycanthrope  has  in  each

form.  For  example,  a  human  commoner  with  a  Constitution

score of 11 as a human and a Constitution score of 15 as a wolf

has 1d4 plus 2d8+4 hit points.

Speed: Same as the character or animal, depending on which

form the lycanthrope is using.

AC: The  characters  natural  armor  increases  by  +2  in  all

forms. In hybrid form, the lycanthropes natural armor bonus

is equal to the natural armor bonus of her animal form or her

base form, whichever is better.

Base Attack: Add the base attack for the animal to the base

attack for the character.

Attacks:  Same  as  the  character  or  animal,  depending  on

which form the lycanthrope is using. A lycanthrope in hybrid

form gains 2 claws and a bite for natural attacks. These deal

damage based on the hybrid forms size:

Hybrid Size

Small

Medium

Large

Huge

Claw

1d3

1d4

1d6

2d4

Bite

1d4

1d6

1d8

2d6

A hybrid may attack with a weapon and a bite, or may attack

with her natural attacks. The bite attack of a hybrid is a sec-

ondary  attack,  but  does  not  penalize  the  characters  attacks

with any weapons she wields or her claws.

Damage:  Same  as  the  character  or  animal,  depending  on

which form the lycanthrope is using.

Special  Attacks:  A  lycanthrope  retains  all  of  the  special

attacks of the character or animal, depending on which form

she is using. The humanoid and hybrid forms do not gain any

special attacks of the animal form. A lycanthrope spellcaster

cannot cast spells with V, S, or M components in animal form,

or spells with V components in hybrid form.

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid or giant hit by a

natural lycanthropes bite attack in animal or hybrid form must

succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or contract lycanthropy. If

the  victim  is  not  within  one  size  category  of  the  lycanthrope

(for example, a hill giant bitten by a wererat), the victim cannot

contract  lycanthropy  from  that  lycanthrope.  Afflicted  lycan-

thropes cannot pass on the Curse of Lycanthropy.

Special Qualities: A lycanthrope retains all the special quali-

ties of the character and the animal in all forms, and also gains

those listed below.

Alternate  Form  (Su):  A  lycanthrope  can  shift  into  animal

form as though using the polymorph spell on itself, though her

gear is not affected, she does not regain hit points for changing

form,  and  only  the  specific  animal  form  listed  for  the  lycan-

thrope can be assumed. She does not assume the ability scores of

the animal, but instead adds the animals physical ability score

modifiers  to  her  own  ability  scores.  A  lycanthrope  also  can

assume  a  bipedal  hybrid  form  with  prehensile  hands  and  ani-

malistic features. Changing to or from animal or hybrid form is

a standard action. A slain lycanthrope reverts to her humanoid

form,  although  she  remains  dead.  Separated  body  parts  retain

their animal form. Afflicted lycanthropes find this ability diffi-

cult to control (see Lycanthropy as an Affliction, below), but

natural lycanthropes have full control over this power.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A lycanthrope in animal or hybrid

form gains damage reduction 10/silver.

Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex): In any form, lycanthropes can

communicate  and  empathize  with  normal  or  dire  animals  of

their animal form. This gives them a +4 racial bonus to checks

when influencing the animals attitude and allows the commu-

nication of simple concepts and (if the animal is friendly) com-

mands, such as friend, foe, flee, and attack.

Low-light  Vision (Ex):  The  lycanthrope  gains  low-light

vision in any form.

Scent (Ex): The lycanthrope gains scent in any form.

Base  Saves:  Add  the  base  saves  for  the  animal  to  the  base

saves for the character.

Abilities: All lycanthropes gain +2 to Wisdom. In addition,

when in animal or hybrid form, a lycanthropes physical ability

scores improve, as set out in Table 91. These adjustments are

equal  to  the  animals  normal  ability  score  10  or  11.  For

example, a were-crocodile (Str 19, Dex 12, Con 17) would add

Str +8, Dex +2, and Con +6 to her normal ability scores when

she takes crocodile or hybrid form.

In addition, the lycanthrope may also gain an additional abil-

ity score increase by virtue of her extra hit dice.

Skills: The  lycanthrope  gains  skill  points  equal  to  (2  +  Int

modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die of her animal form, as if

she had multiclassed into the animal type. (Animal is never her

first  Hit  Die,  though,  and  she  does  not  gain  quadruple  skill

points for any animal Hit Dice.) Any skill listed in the animal

description is a class skill for the lycanthropes animal levels. In

any  form,  the  lycanthrope  retains  any  racial  skill  bonuses  of

the base character and of the animal, although conditional skill

bonuses, such as a weretigers camouflage bonus to Hide checks,

only apply in the associated form.

Feats: Add  the  animals  feats  to  the  characters.  If  this

results  in  the  lycanthrope  having  the  same  feat  twice,  the

lycanthrope gains no benefit unless the feat normally can be

taken more once, in which case the duplicated feat works as

noted  in  the  feat  description.  This  may  grant  the  lycan-

thrope  more  feats  than  a  character  of  her  total  Hit  Dice

would otherwise be entitled to. Any extra feats are gained

as bonus feats.

and  more  fit  than  their  normal  fellows.  Their  strength  gives

them the right to murder, plunder, and terrorize any who are too

weak to defend themselves.

Afflicted  lycanthropes  are  often  horrified  to  find  that  they

have  contracted  the  condition.  Waking  up  covered  with  blood

and a convenient case of amnesia is bad enough. To learn that

this is a situation that is going to repeat itself three nights every

month for the rest of your life can be nearly intolerable. Most

such people try to find a cure as quickly as possible. Of course, not

everyone has access to belladonnawhich must be taken within

an hour of the attack anyhowor to a high-level spellcaster who

can remove the condition.

The worst part for a cursed lycanthrope is that any voluntary

change into an animal or hybrid form immediately changes the

humanoids alignment to that of the lycanthropic form. If this

differs from the characters current alignment, it can be a jarring

shift, and the larger the shift the worse it is on the character. Its

hard for a paladin-werewolf to remain a paladin for long in the

face of the seductive lure of giving in to his feral side.

Once  a  characters  alignment  is  in  accord  with  that  of  her

animal shape, though, the afflicted lycanthrope comes to terms

with her curse. The battle between the two sides of her personal-

ityher humanoid and her animal selvesis over.

Most  lycanthrope  adventurers  are  loners.  They  may  join  a

band of like-minded adventurers and even work with them for

several tendays at a time. Once that full moon rises, though, they

disappear in search of a place to be by themselves. They know all

too well that many people are not fond of lycanthropes, so they

take great pains to conceal their true nature.

LYCANTHROPE CHARACTERS

A  lycanthropes  humanoid  form  determines  her  class.  Many

cursed lycanthropes were adventurers to begin with, since these

are the sorts of people most likely to have the kinds of encoun-

ters  that  lead  to  such  troubles.  If  the  lycanthrope  wasnt  an

adventurer before, she is likely to become one now. Entire chap-

ters  of  an  adventurers  saga  can  be  written  about  her  quest  to

find some way to have the curse removed, even if the storys pro-

tagonist was once a simple commoner who just happened to be in

the wrong place at the wrong time.

Lycanthrope Society

Natural lycanthropes often come from a family of lycanthropes

who have passed the curse down through the generations. They

are usually careful to conceal their true nature from people they

dont  know  very  well,  since  there  are  many  non-lycanthropes

who believe that the only good lycanthrope is a dead one. Chil-

dren  of  natural  lycanthropes  can  start  to  change  form  on  the

first full moon after their birth.

Afflicted  lycanthropes  rarely  have  any  kind  of  society  or

family  to  support  them.  Unless  they  are  found  by  the  lycan-

thrope who bestowed the curse on them in the first place, many

afflicted  lycanthropes  never  meet  another  of  their  own  kind.

Evil  lycanthropes  have  been  known  to  carelessly  spread  their

curse in order to create a pack of followers. Of course, if the new

lycanthropes  are  less  than  thrilled  about  their  affliction,  this

strategy can easily backfire.

Lycanthropes age, become adults, and die just like anyone else

of their humanoid race. Their animal forms ages proportionally

with the humanoid forms. A young lycanthrope becomes a young

animal. An elderly lycanthrope who can barely walk finds herself

in the same situation as an animal.

Again, lythari  are the exception. Lythari are almost always

friends with each other to begin with. They often run in a pack

together, and are usually revered by other elves as creatures of

powerful magic.

Language and Literacy

A  lycanthrope  speaks  whatever  languages  are  common  to  her

humanoid  form.  She  also  can  communicate  empathically  with

normal  or  dire  animals  of  the  same  form  as  her  lycanthropic

animal shape.

A lycanthropes literacy is determined by her humanoid form.

Abilities and

Racial Features

Refer to the Lycanthrope Template sidebar for details on creat-

ing lycanthropes. Lycanthrope characters possess the following

racial traits.

continued from page 144

Its possible that the lycanthrope cannot meet the prerequi-

sites for all her feats when in humanoid form. When this occurs,

the lycanthrope still has the feats, but cannot use them when in

humanoid form (see Prerequisites in Chapter 5 of the Players

Handbook). Lycanthropes receive Iron Will as a bonus feat.

Climate/Terrain: Any.

Organization: Solitary or pair, sometimes family (24), pack

Animal form of 1 to 2 HD: +2

Animal form of 3 HD to 5 HD: +3

Animal form of 6 HD to 10 HD: +4

Animal form of 11 to 20 HD: +5

Animal form of 21+ HD: +6

Level Adjustment: Same as the character, +1 (afflicted) or

+2  (natural).  In  addition,  the  characters  effective  character

level is increased by the racial Hit Dice of the animal form.

Treasure: Standard

Alignment: Any  (see  the  Curse  of  Lycanthropy,  below).

Noble creatures such as bears, eagles, or lions tend to produce

good-aligned  lycanthropes.  Sinister  creatures  such  as  rats,

snakes,  or  wolves  tend  to  produce  evil-aligned  lycanthropes.

This is a reflection of how these animals are perceived, not any

innate quality of the animal itself.

forms. See Table 91.

Racial  Hit  Dice:  A  lycanthrope  adds  the  Hit  Dice  of  her

animal  form  to  her  base  Hit  Dice  for  race,  level,  and  class.

This  modifies  the  lycanthropes  base  attack  and  base  saving

throws accordingly. See Table 91.

Racial  Skills:  A  lycanthrope  adds  skill  points  for  her  animal

Hit Dice much as if she had multiclassed into the animal type.

See  Table  92,  Lycanthrope  Feats  and  Skills.  She  gains  skill

points equal to (2 + Intelligence modifier, minimum 1) per Hit

Die of the animal form. Any skills that appear in the animal

description  are  treated  as  class  skills  for  the  lycanthropes

animal  levels.  The  lycanthropes  maximum  skill  ranks  are

equal  to  her  animal  form  Hit  Dice  +  her  racial  Hit  Dice  (if

any) + her class levels +3. Any racial skill adjustments of the

lycanthropes base race and her animal form (but not condi-

tional adjustments) are added to her skill checks in any form.

Racial Feats: Add the animals Hit Dice to the base characters

own Hit Dice to determine how many feats the character has.

All lycanthropes gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.

Natural  Armor:  A  lycanthrope  gains  +2  natural  armor  in

any form.

lycanthrope  has  an  effective  character  level  (ECL)  of  2  +

animal form HD + racial HD (if any) + class levels, so a 4th-

level human werebear fighter would have an ECL of 12.

Favored Class: As base creature.

Lycanthropy

as an Afflicton

When a character contracts lycanthropy through a lycanthropes

bite (see above), no symptoms appear until the first night of the

next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involun-

tarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity,

temporarily  becoming  an  NPC  under  the  DMs  control.  The

character  remains  in  animal  form,  assuming  the  appropriate

alignment, until the next dawn.

The characters actions during this first episode are dictated by

the alignment of its animal form. Good-aligned creatures seek to

avoid  settlements  or  travelers  and  non-natural  environments,

seeking out wilderness environs. They may hunt the natural prey

of their kind, but avoid attacking non-evil intelligent creatures.

Evil  creatures  seek  to  murder  as  many  intelligent  creatures  as

possible,  often  killing  their  own  family  members  and  friends.

They generally seek out places where such victims may be found.

Neutral creatures seek remote areas and avoid contact with civi-

lization, but might attack travelers or other folk abroad in the

wilderness out of natural ferocity and hunger, not malice. In any

case, the character remembers nothing about the entire episode

(or  subsequent  episodes)  unless  he  succeeds  at  a  Wisdom  check

(DC 15) on awaking, in which case he becomes aware of his lycan-

thropic condition.

Thereafter,  the  character  is  subject  to  involuntary  transfor-

mation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat.

He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must suc-

ceed at a Control Shape check to resist changing into animal form

(see Control Shape, in the Monster Manual). Any character not

yet  aware  of  his  or  her  lycanthropic  condition  temporarily  be-

comes  an  NPC  under  the  DMs  control  during  an  involuntary

change, and acts as described above.

A character with awareness of his condition retains his iden-

tity and does not lose control of his actions if he changes. How-

ever, each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a

Will  save  (DC  15  +  number  of  times  he  has  been  in  animal

form)  or  permanently  assume  the  alignment  of  his  animal

form  in  all  shapes.  An  evil  lycanthrope  who  is  aware  of  his

actions  in  animal  form  is  not  compelled  to  murder  and  kill

indiscriminately, but he delights in bloodshed and will certainly

seek  out  opportunities  to  slaughter  intelligent  beings,  prefer-

ably those of his own race.

Once the character becomes aware of the affliction, he can

now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form,

using the appropriate Control Shape DC. An attempt is a stan-

dard action and can be made each round. Any voluntary change

to  animal  or  hybrid  form  immediately  and  permanently

changes  the  characters  alignment  to  that  of  the  appropriate

lycanthrope.

CHANGING FORM

Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary,

the character performs the change on his next turn following the

triggering event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the

characters armor and clothing (including any items worn) if the

new  form  is  larger  than  the  characters  natural  form;  carried

items  are  simply  dropped.  Characters  can  hastily  doff  clothing

while changing, but not armor. Magic armor survives the change

if it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 15). An afflicted character

who is not aware of his condition remains in animal form until

the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware of his or her

condition (see above) can try to resume humanoid form follow-

ing  a  change  (voluntary  or  involuntary)  with  a  Control  Shape

check, but if he fails his check, he remains in animal (or hybrid)

form until the following dawn.

Types of Lycanthrope

Most  types  of  lycanthropes  have  special  abilities  of  their  own,

since each gains the special abilities and racial skill bonuses of its

animal form.

LYTHARI AND WEREWOLVES

Lythari and werewolves have the following special abilities:

Trip  (Ex):  In  animal  form,  if  the  werewolf  hits  with  a  bite

attack, she can attempt to trip the target as a free action with-

out  making  a  touch  attack  or  provoking  an  attack  of  opportu-

nity. If the attempt fails, the foe cannot try to trip the werewolf.

Skills: Lythari and werewolves gain a +4 racial bonus to Sur-

vival checks when tracking by scent.

MINOR RACES

WEREBAT

WERETIGER

Werebats have the following special abilities:

Weretigers have the following special abilities:

Blindsense  (Ex):  In  animal  form,  the  werebat  notices  and

locates  creatures  and  objects  within  40  feet.  Creatures  detected

through blindsense have 100% concealment against the werebat

unless it can also see them normally. A silence spell or deafness

effect negates this ability.

Skills:  Werebats  receive  a  +4  racial  bonus  to  Spot  and

Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if the werebats blindsight

is negated.

WEREBEAR

Werebears have the following special abilities:

Improved Grab (Ex): In animal form, if the werebear hits with

a claw attack, she can attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Skills: Werebears receive a +4 racial bonus to Swim checks.

WEREBOAR

Wereboars have the following special ability:

Ferocity  (Ex):  In  any  form,  the  wereboar  continues  to  fight

without penalty even when disabled or dying.

WERECROCODILE

Werecrocodiles have the following special abilities:

Hold Breath (Ex): In any form, a werecrocodile can hold her

breath for a number of rounds equal to four times her Constitu-

tion  score  before  she  risks  drowning.  (See  the  DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide.)

Improved Grab (Ex): In animal form, if the werecrocodile hits

an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than her-

self with her bite attack, she can attempt to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Skills: In animal form, a werecrocodile gains a +4 racial bonus

on Hide checks when in water.

WERERAT

Wererats have the following special abilities:

Disease  (Ex):  In  animal  form,  a  wererats  bite  carries  filth

fever (Fort save DC 12, incubation period 1d3 days).

Skills: A wererat in rat or hybrid form uses her Dexterity mod-

ifier for Climb checks. Wererats gain a +8 racial bonus to Swim

checks in any form.

WERESHARK

Weresharks have the following special abilities:

Keen  Scent  (Ex):  In  any  form,  a  wereshark  in  water  detects

creatures within 180 feet. Exact location is not revealed unless

the wereshark is within 5 feet of the creature.

Blindsense (Ex): In any form, a wereshark in water notices and

locates  creatures  within  30  feet.    Creatures  detected  through

blindsense have 100% concealment against the wereshark unless

she can also see them normally.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  In  animal  form,  if  the  weretiger  hits

with a claw or bite attack, she can attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If she

gets a hold, she can rake.

Pounce (Ex): In animal form, if the weretiger leaps upon her

foe during the first round of combat, she can make a full attack,

even if she has already taken a move action.

Rake (Ex): A weretiger in animal form who gets a hold can

make two rake attacks with her hind legs, each dealing damage

equal to 1d8 + Strength modifier. She can attempt to rake each

round that she grapples her opponent.

Skills:  In  any  form,  the  weretiger  gains  a  +4  racial  bonus  to

Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. In areas of tall grass or

heavy undergrowth, her Hide bonus rises to +8 in animal form.

Lycanthrope Deities

A  lycanthropes  racial  deities  are  determined  by  her  base  race.

Born  lycanthropes  usually  worship  a  nature  god  in  their  races

pantheon if there is such a deity. Selne and Malar are also the

patron deities of good and evil lycanthropes, respectively.

Relations with Other Races

A lycanthropes relations with other races are mostly determined

by her base race. However, since the alignments of most lycan-

thropes  are  fairly  well  known,  most  people  assume  that  the

lycanthrope has the same alignment in all of its forms. If they

know of the lycanthropes affliction, they often base their opin-

ions on the lycanthrope by how close they are to each other in

their alignments.

Shade

Region: Anauroch.

Level Adjustment: +4.

Over two thousand years ago, the ruler of a Netherese flying

city  transported  his  entire  city  onto  the  Plane  of  Shadow  in

order to explore that dim and perilous plane. For thousands of

years, the City of Shade was lost to human knowledge, but in

1372 DR it abruptly returned to Faern above the Dire Wood.

Today it soars above the deserts of Anauroch, land that was once

a fertile part of the Empire of Netheril. Why the Netherese

now known as the Shadovarsreturned, and what they are plan-

ning, are two mysteries that trouble the rulers of every nation

in Faern. Most fear that solving these vital riddles will provide

them with answers they will not care to hear. Until then, the

Shadovars scheme in secret, their true goals a mystery to all but

their ruler, the High Prince Telamont, and his twelve sons, the

Princes of Shade.

Not all Shadovars are shades. The Princes of Shade decide who

is  to  be  given  such  a  blessing,  and  they  are  stingy  with  their

favors, careful to only empower those who are sure to be loyal

to them and their causes. Prospective candidates are stringently

tested for ability, loyalty, and resourcefulness.

147

MINOR RACES

Shades look just like normal humanoids, although their skin is

gray to inky black, as are their eyes. They are thinner than most

humans, and they prefer to dress in dark-hued clothes or armor.

Human Shadovars are never made into shades until after they

have  reached  the  age  of  majority.  There  are  no  such  things  as

young shades, and shades who marry produce normal offspring.

Shades  have  extraordinarily  long  lifespans.  By  trading  some

portion of their souls for the stuff of shadow, they extend their

lifespans tenfold. Shades created from humans use the following

aging effect characteristics instead of the ones in Table 65 in

the Players Handbook:

Shade (human)

300

450

Shade Society

Life in the City of Shade fits into a strictly controlled hierar-

chy. The High Prince sits at the top of the hierarchys pyramid,

with his sonsthe Twelve Princes of Shaderight below him.

Beneath  them,  the  arcanists  (Shadovar  sorcerers  and  wizards)

stand, with the military next down in importance. At the base

of the pyramid, there are four levels of commoners. In descend-

ing order, these are the crafters (skilled laborers), the merchants

(those  who  distribute  necessary  goods  throughout  the  City  of

Shade  and  import  and  export  needed  materials),  the  servants

(those who work as personal servants to people above them), and

the slaves (who do the worst of the societys grunt work).

History

While  the  City  of  Shade  was

trapped  in  the  Plane  of  Shadow

for  the  past  two  millennia,  the

High  Prince,  most  powerful  wizard  in

the city, struck upon a means of transform-

ing  himself  and  his  most  loyal  followers  into

creatures of shadow. This granted them near-

immortality  and  an  incredible  array  of

powersas  long  as  they  were

shrouded in some kind of darkness.

Since  the  return  of  the  City  of  Shade  to

Faern,  the  High  Prince  has  pursued  a  mysterious

agenda that few outside the Princes of Shade under-

stand.  Some  things  are  clear,  however,  like  the

fact that the High Prince intends to exter-

minate  the  phaerimm  who  still

remain  in  Anauroch  after  all  these

years. This crusade even caused the

High  Prince  to  lend  his  citys

power  to  aid  the  people  of

Evereska  in  defeating  a  recent

phaerimm  invasion,  granting  the

elvish community a strange bedfellow

indeed.  With  the  routing  of  the  phaerimm,  of

course,  the  alliance  ended,  and  the  Shadovars  have

returned to their standoffish ways.

A shade assassin

At the age of ascension (13 years old),

every  citizen  is  tutored  in  basic  spell-

craft and subjected to a battery of tests

to  determine  how  his  skills  can  best

serve the City of Shade. Then, at the age

of  majority  (18  years  old)  each  person

embarks upon the job for which he was

trained.  Unless  the  person  suddenly

displays a new aptitude, he works at his

designated career until the day he dies.

Those citizens who prove to be espe-

cially  important  and  loyal  are  trans-

formed  into  shades.  This  is  one  of  the

greatest honors a Shadovar can receive.

Only  a  small  percentage  of  Shadovars

are  transformed,  and  commoners  and

low-ranking military officers are never

chosen for transformation.

Outside  the  City  of  Shade,  most

shades  keep  to  themselves.  They  may

travel  singly  or  in  small  groups,  but

any  alliances  they  make  with  non-

Shadovarswhich  are  rareare  sure

to  be  alliances  of  convenience.  Only  a

Prince of Shade or a Shadovar officer

of  captains  rank  or  higher  can  leave

the  City  of  Shade  without  an  escort,

and  such  a  person  had  better  have  a

defensible reason for doing so.

Outlook

Shades live to serve the High Prince and their fellow Shadovars.

Most have grown up in the City of Shade as loyal champions of

the High Princes regime. While individual shades may have per-

sonal agendas, few conflict with the purposes of Shades rulers,

since  disobedient  or  disloyal  Shadovars  are  not  likely  to  have

been transformed into shades in the first place.

Shades  consider  themselves  superior  to  all  nonshades  around

them. After all, thats what theyve been raised to believe from birth.

Only the most worthy Shadovars are chosen to become shades.

Most  shades  go  adventuring  only  at  the  behest  of  their

superiors. They are normally given specific orders about what

they are to do on such missions. Shades rarely share their true

reasons  for  adventuring  with  any  non-Shadovar  allies  they

may temporarily make. They do not trust those outside Shade,

and any relationships they strike up with strangers are sure to

be temporary.

Language and Literacy

Netherese is the language of the City of Shade, and all Shadovar

speak  it.  Those  who  deal  with  other  Faernians  or  frequently

travel outside the city often speak Common and whatever other

languages they might find convenient.

All  shades  are  literate,  except  for  barbarians  (not  that  any

Shadovars could be considered barbarians).

Abilities and

Racial Features

As creatures of the Plane of Shadow, shades are considered to be

of the outsider type. Shades must be of a nongood alignment.

All shades have the following powers when within shadows or

darkness.  In  well-lit  surroundings  (daylight  or  the  radius  of  a

daylight spell) none of these powers function.

148

MINOR RACES

Ability  Scores:  A  shades  Constitution  and  Charisma  scores

increase by +2.

Speed:  Increases  by  20  ft.  (or  15  ft.,  if  the  character  wears

medium or heavy armor).

Armor Class: The shade gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC.

Attacks and Damage: The shade gains a +2 competence bonus

on attacks and damage.

Saves: The shade gains a +4 luck bonus on all saving throws.

Skills:  The  character  gains  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Listen  and

Spot checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently

checks. He does not suffer skill check penalties due to darkness.

Control Light (Sp): The shade can decrease the levels of light

within  a  100-foot  radius  by  a  factor  of  10%  per  level.  For

characters  and  creatures  dependent  on  light  to  see,  this

decreases the effective range of vision for them by the same

percentage. For each 25% decrease in light, anyone within the

area gains a +1 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

Fast Healing 2.

Invisibility (Sp): The shade can use this ability once per round

as a sorcerer of his level.

Shadesight (Sp): The shade has 60-foot darkvision. He can see

normally through any darkness effects but not through fog,

invisibility, obscurement, and so on.

Shadow Image (Sp): Three times per day, the shade can use this

spell-like  ability  (similar  to  the  mirror  image spell)  as  a  sor-

cerer of his level. This creates 1d4 figments of the shade, +1

per three levels.

Shadow Stride (Sp): As often as once every 2 rounds, a shade

of  8th  level  or  higher  can  vanish  from  his  current  location

and  reappear  in  any  shadowy  area  within  300  feet.  This  is  a

move-equivalent action.

Shadow Travel (Sp): If the shade is 12th level or higher, then

he can use teleport without error to reach a shadowy locale on

the same world or plane shift to access the Plane of Shadows.

A shade can shadow travel once per day.

Spell Resistance: 11 + character level.

Level  Adjustment:  +4.  Shades  are  more  powerful  and  gain

levels more slowly than the common races of Faern. Their

many bonuses and powers are hindered only by the fact that

they  do  not  work  in  bright  light.  Shadovars  do  not  create

shades from characters who are less than 5th level. See Table

1 in the Introduction for more information.

Shade Magic and Lore

Most Shadovar spellcasters are arcanists (sorcerers or wizards).

They  normally  specialize  in  the  schools  of  Evocation  and

Necromancy, although they are free to choose any school or

none at all.

One favorite tactic of shade spellcasters is to cast a darkness

spellor  any  other  spell  that  causes  darkness  or  shadows

on  themselves.  They  then  have  access  to  their  full  range  of

shade powers.

Spellcasting  Tradition:  Shadovar  arcanists  have  at  least  two

racial  spells  particular  to  their  people:  handfang and  shadow

canopy (see the appendix).

Shade Deities

All  Shadovars  worship  Shar  as  their  patron.  No  other  deities

have  churches  within  the  City  of  Shade.  The  people  of  Shade

worshiped this ancient goddess even before they ventured into

the Plane of Shadow. Since then, they have learned to rely upon

her like no other. All other churches or chapels in the City of

Shade  have  long  since  been  converted  over  to  the  worship  of

Shar. Still, shade clerics are more loyal to the High Prince than

to Shar herself. Their worship of her is a means to an end.

Relations with Other Races

Shadovars  of  all  stripes  do  not  have  much  contact  with  non-

Shadovars, and so have little if any specific prejudices about them,

whether good or bad. They think of other peoples as inferior, to some-

day  be  subjugated  by  the  triumphant  High  Prince.  However,  all

Shadovars have an especially cold and dark place in their hearts for

their ancient foes: the phaerimm. Shadovars are willing to go to great

lengths to cause the phaerimm trouble andpreferablydeath.

Shade Equipment

A shades favored weapons are determined by his base race. To most

Faernians,  the  weapons  and  equipment  of  most  Shadovars  look

oddly dated. After all, until recently they were cut off from the rest

of the world for over two thousand years. Shades often wear ornate

breastplates  and  carry  similarly  designed  ranseurs.  They  also  like

aerial cavalry and have domesticated dire bats as mounts.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Shadovars dont raise animals in the City of Shade; theres simply no

room. They gather their food by either paying for it or taking it.

There are few if any pets in their societycaring for such creatures

is not considered an efficient use of the citys limited resources.

Wemic

Regions: Anauroch, Shaar, Vilhon Reach, Western Heartlands.

Racial Feats: None, but wemics can acquire the Spirited Charge

and Trample feats (ignoring the prerequisites) and apply the

benefits to their own melee attacks.

Racial Hit Dice: 5d8.

Level Adjustment: +3

Wemics  are  centaurlike  creatures  with  the  upper  torso  of  a

humanoid  atop  a  lions  broad  shoulders.  They  are  a  proud  and

noble people who may be the most skillful hunters in all Faern.

From head to rump, wemics are 10 to 12 feet long, and they

stand 6 to 7 feet tall from their front paws to the tops of their

heads. They weigh around 600 pounds. Dusky golden fur covers

them from head to tail. Their tails feature a brush of black hair,

and the males have a long black mane. Wemics faces are a mix-

ture of humanoid and leonine, and their golden eyes have the slit-

ted pupils of a cat. Their ears are set high on their heads. All six

of their limbs end in claws, but the ones on their hands and their

front paws are retractable.

Wemics remain children for only five years, and live about 40

years on average. Most wemics die in dangerous hunts on the

savanna long before age can take them.

Wemics have the same life expectancy and age categories as

half-orcs.

149

MINOR RACES

History

The wemics are a tribal people with no writing skills or interest

in  recording  history.  Nature  gave  the  wemics  their  hunting

grounds, so they fight tooth and claw against the civilizations

encroaching upon them from all sides. The wemics arent evil

and dont want to hurt anyone in particular, but they do want

strangers  to  stay  well  clear  of  their  hunting  grounds  and  the

wemics plentiful prey.

Small  tribes  of  wemics  live  in  the  arid  plains  of  southern

Anauroch  and  the  Shining  Plains  west  of  Turmish.  However,

most  wemics  belong  to  large,  nomadic  tribes  that  roam  vast

regions of the Shaar. Several times over the last few centuries,

Shaaran  wemics  have  formed  great  hordes  to  drive  off

encroaching human settlement, especially along the southern

frontiers of Unther and Mulhorand.

out on their first hunt to make their first kill. Once they have

proven themselves, they are considered adults.

In these prides, the males spend the nights patrolling the area,

protecting the pride from any threats. They mostly sleep during

the day while the females hunt for food. The leader of the pride

is  the  strongest  male.  When  he  is  eventually  challenged  and

removed from power, he usually wanders off to live alone or join

with other males who have left their prides for various reasons.

Sometimes prides join together to form a tribe that can defend

itself against a threat larger than a single pride could handle.

Older wemics eventually slow down too much and are picked

off from the pride by predators, much in the same way that a

wemic might cull a herd of antelope. This is considered the nat-

ural order of things. Some older wemics, realizing that

they  are  slowing  down  the  pride,  instead  wander

into  the  nearest  humanoid  community,

retiring  from  the  pride  but  taking

up a whole new life elsewhere.

Outlook

Wemics  live  in  harmony  with

nature, uncivilized and proud of

it.  They  eschew  the  ways  of

civilization,  since  they  cant

see  why  anyone  would  ever

want  to  live  under  a  shingled

roof when she could have the sky

itself  as  her  roof.  Wemics  are  a

proud  people,  usually  slow  to  anger,

but they have no patience for civilized

folk  who  take  their  lack  of

familiarity with human soci-

ety for ignorance.

Language

and Literacy

Wemics  normally  speak  Sylvan.

Wemics  who  interact  with  out-

siders  pick  up  Common  to  hire

themselves  as  guides  or  scouts

in  their  homelands,  or  (more

often) to warn away settlers or

hunting  parties  trespassing  on

wemic territory.

All  wemics  are  illiterate,

except  for  those  with  a

player  character  class  other

than barbarian.

Wemics  learn  to  hunt  and

Female wemics do most of the hunting.

The males sometimes lead the hunt, but more often they roam the

plains, protecting the pride from outside threats.

Wemic

Adventuring wemics sometimes leave their remote homes to

see more of the world. They are fascinated by the colorful human

merchants who travel through their territory. With civilization

creeping  closer  to  their  hunting  lands  every  year,  some  of  the

more adventurous wemics realize that its in the interest of the

pride for them to learn everything they can about their neigh-

bors before it is too late.

WEMIC CHARACTERS

Close as they are to nature, there are many druids among the

wemics. They have no other spellcasters in their tribes, although

wemics that have spent some time in the civilized world have

sometimes picked up levels as various kinds of spellcasters. In

any case, the wemics favored class is, of course, barbarian.

Wemic Society

Life  as  a  wemic  is  simple.  Most  of  the  day  is  spent  playing

around, basking in the sun, or hunting for food.

In a single pride of wemics, there are usually 1 to 4 males, 2

to 12 females, and 1 to 6 cubs. The cubs are allowed to play freely

until they reach 5 years of age, at which point they are brought

150

Abilities and

Racial Features

Wemics have the following racial traits:

+8  Strength,  +2  Dexterity,  +2  Constitution,  2  Charisma.

Strong, fast, and hardy, wemics do not care much for impress-

ing others outside their pride.

Large: As Large creatures, wemics suffer a 1 size penalty on

attack rolls and AC. They also suffer a 4 size penalty on Hide

checks.  However,  they  can  use  larger  weapons  than  humans

can,  and  their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are  twice  those  of

Medium-size characters.

Wemic facing is 10 feet They have a reach of 5 feet.

Wemic land speed is 40 feet .

+4 natural armor.

Darkvision 60 feet.

Proficient with all simple weapons and shields.

+8 racial bonus on Jump checks.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Hit  Dice:  A  wemic  has  5d8  racial  Hit

Dice. A wemic character receives the maximum hit points for

his first monstrous humanoid Hit Die and rolls his other mon-

strous humanoid Hit Dice normally. He rolls all Hit Dice from

class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit points

on his first class-level Hit Die. A wemics racial Hit Dice also

provide a +5 base attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +1, Ref

MINOR RACES

+4, and Will +4. Wemics with class levels add their class attack

bonus and save bonuses to their racial attack bonus and saves.

Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A wemics monstrous humanoid Hit

Dice grant him skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum

1) 8. Class skills for these skill points are Hide, Jump, Listen,

Move Silently, Spot, and Survival. A wemic does not get the 4

multiplier for skill points acquired from his first class level.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Feats:  A  wemics  monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  him  2  feats.  A  typical  wemic

chooses  Alertness  and  Great  Fortitude.  A  wemic  with  class

levels  gains  feats  based  on  his  total  Hit  Dice,  as  shown  on

Table 2 in the Introduction.

Natural  Attacks:  Wemics  can  make  2  claw  attacks,  dealing

1d6 points of damage each. A wemic can attack with a one-

handed weapon at his normal attack bonus, and make a claw

attack as a secondary attack (5 penalty on the attack roll,

and half Strength bonus on the damage roll).

Automatic  Languages:  Sylvan,  Common.  Bonus  Languages:

By region.

Favored Class: Barbarian.

Level Adjustment: +3. Due to his 5 racial Hit Dice, his natu-

ral attacks, and his racial skill bonus, a wemic has an effective

character  level  of  8  plus  his  class  levels.  Thus,  a  5th-level

wemic barbarian would have an ECL of 13. See Table 1 in the

Introduction for more information.

Wemic Deities

Wemics  worship  Nobanion,  the  demigod  of  noble  animals  and

woodland  creatures.  Nobanion  is  a  nature  deity  and  may  grant

spells to wemic druids and rangers. Some wemics are lured by the

feral bloodlust of Malar, and worship the Beastlord instead.

Relations with Other Races

Isolated as they are, wemics dont have much of an opinion about

the other races. They prefer to deal with people who recognize

the  sanctity  of  nature,  but  they  are  willing  to  guide  just  about

anyone through or around their homelands for the right deal.

Wemic Equipment

Wemics  prefer  to  use  clubs,  spears,  and  large  wooden  shields.

They only use weapons they can make themselves.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Wemics  hold  a  deep  reverence  for  all  animals,  especially  the

game animals they hunt most often. They are careful not to take

too  many  kills  from  the  same  herd,  and  never  kill  more  than

they can eat. Wemics are enraged by humanoid hunters who slay

an animal for a small portion of its body, such as a rhinos horn,

and then abandon the carcass.

Yuan-Ti

Regions: Chult, Hlondeth, Tashalar, Western Heartlands.

Level Adjustment: Varies.

The yuan-ti are a race of snake people descended from an unholy

crossbreeding  between  humans  and  an  ancient  reptilian  race.

They come in three distinctly different forms (purebloods, half-

bloods, and abominations), and they have created two subraces of

servitors as well (tainted ones and broodguards). Together, they

form  a  horrific  threat  to  the  rest  of  Faern.  This  section  dis-

cusses the purebloods and tainted ones, the yuan-ti most likely to

be found as adventurers or spies in humanoid lands.

Purebloods have some serpentine characteristics, but can gener-

ally pass for human. They are the weakest of the true yuan-ti, serv-

ing  as  overseers  and  taskmasters  over  the  yuan-ti  servitors  and

slaves, as well as spies and assassins. Purebloods have subtle reptilian

features, such as snake eyes, forked tongues, pointed teeth, patches

of scaly skin, and the like. They are human-sized. Purebloods answer

to the halfbloods and the abominations, even more powerful crea-

tures whose serpentine features are too pronounced to allow them

to infiltrate humanoid society without powerful magic.

Tainted ones are humanoids who have been corrupted by drink-

ing a special yuan-ti elixir. The result is a person who looks almost

exactly like his normal self, but whose mind has been twisted to

the  yuan-ti  way.  They  serve  as  yuan-ti  agents  and  spies  in

humanoid lands. Tainted ones sometimes develop distinctive man-

nerisms  such  as  licking  their  lips  constantly,  drawing  out  their

sibilants when speaking, or keeping large serpents as pets.

All of the true yuan-ti subraces can interbreed, although most

stick to their own kind. Yuan-ti lay eggs, like reptiles. The hatch-

lings from these eggs reach adulthood at about 12 years of age.

On average, yuan-ti live to be about 80 years old, although some

have been known to live over 120 years.

Yuan-ti have the same life expectancy and age categories

as humans.

History

The  true  yuan-ti  are  the  proud  descendants  of  interbreeding

between humans and the long-lost saurian creator race. They can

be found all across Faern, although they mostly prefer to keep

their existence secret and the locations of their lairs even more

so. They have a long, mostly frustrated history of trying to take

over  various  kingdoms  in  Faern,  but  they  have  firmly  estab-

lished themselves in several placesthe city of Hlondeth in the

Vilhon Reach, the land of Tashalar on the Shining Sea, and in

the depths of the Black Jungles and Mhair Jungles.

These  days,  the  yuan-ti  have  decided  that  if  the  direct  ap-

proach does not work, there are still other ways to bring a coun-

try  to  its  knees.  To  that  end,  they  are  infiltrating  hundreds  of

agentsmostly tainted onesinto important posts throughout

the  various  nations  of  Faern.  These  spies  are  to  gather  infor-

mation about potential targets and look for opportunities for the

yuan-ti to strike.

Outlook

All  yuan-tieven  the  servitorsare  arrogant,  convinced  that

their race is superior to all others. They believe it is only a matter

of time before their machinations allow them to take over the

nations  of  Faern  from  within.  While  they  are  not  averse  to

open  battle  and  actually  excel  at  it,  they  realize  that  they  are

greatly outnumbered by their chosen foes, and prefer to use more

subtle means to weaken their enemies from within.

151

MINOR RACES

From the moment they are hatched, young yuan-ti are led to

believe  that  the  world  once  belonged  to  their  ancestors,  the

saurians.  As  such,  it  rightly  belongs  to  them,  and  it  is  only  a

matter of time before they recover it. This justifies any kind of

evil they may do to the peoples of Faern. After all, they are

not proposing to take over someone elses country. They simply

want back what is rightfully theirs, and they are prepared to go

to any lengths to get it.

The yuan-ti spend a great deal of time hiding in the wild, hunt-

ing for their food while they wait for their tainted ones to bring

them the information they need to be able to plan an attack. For

this  reason,  they  often  end  up  as  rangers.  However,  they  are

devout  worshipers  of  Sseth,  the  yuan-ti  god,  so  there  are  a

number of clerics within their ranks too.

Most  yuan-ti  become  adventurers  because  they  want  to  in-

crease  their  own  standing  within  their  communities.  Tainted

ones, in particular, are often found far from any yuan-ti home,

since it is their task to infiltrate humanoid society in preparation

for the next attack.

YUAN-TI CHARACTERS

The favored class of pureblood yuan-ti is ranger.

The favored class of servitor yuan-ti is deter-

mined by his or her base race.

Yuan-Ti Society

The  temples  of  Sseth  (a  yuan-ti

aspect of Set) are the center of

yuan-ti life. Each yuan-ti com-

munity  has  one,  and  bloody

services involving human sac-

rifice are held regularly.

The  yuan-ti  tend  to  build

their communities in or beneath

ancient ruins. The leaders of the

communitythe priests of the

templelike to reinforce

the  connection  to  their

ancient  heritage  in  this

way.  Other  times,  the

yuan-ti  occupy  caverns,

sewers, or catacombs beneath human cities. This positions

them  closer  to  the  societies  that  they  wish  to  conquer,  and  it

improves communication with their tainted ones. It also exposes

them to greater risk should their presence be discovered, but this is

a risk many yuan-ti leaders are willing to shoulder.

Abominations, the most powerful and least humanoid of the

race, rule over the yuan-ti. The ruler of the community is always

an  abomination,  often  one  with  a  human  head.  Halfbloods  are

considered  the  next  most  important  because  they  exhibit  more

snakelike qualities than the purebloods. Halfbloods are captains

and  elite  guards.  The  tainted  ones  come  below  the  purebloods,

and  the  broodguards  come  last  of  all.  Tainted  ones  sometimes

serve in yuan-ti communities, but they are more often sent into

nearby  towns  and  cities  as  agents.  Broodguards  get  their  name

from their function in the yuan-ti society. They guard the yuan-

ti  brood  chambers,  in  which  the  yuan-ti  females  lay  and  then

hatch their eggs. Broodguards also look after the young, making

sure they dont wander off unexpectedly.

Yuan-ti young are trained from a very early age in the use of

their special abilities. The most important of these is the ability to

change  shape  into  a  viper.  When  young  yuan-ti  are  threatened,

they  invariably  turn  into  Tiny  vipers  and  slither  away  through

cracks  or  holes  in  walls,  escaping  by  going  places  where  their

attackers  cannot  follow.  Elderly  yuan-ti  are  respected  for  their

wisdom, the result of long years of experience. Unlike many other

evil societies, yuan-ti very rarely turn on an aging leader, instead

allowing the elder to pass his final days in somnolence and quiet.

When  yuan-ti  leave  their  homes,  they  usually  arrange  them-

selves into war, hunting, or spy parties, depending on their need.

Purebloods and tainted ones often work alone or in small groups.

They sometimes form yuan-ti cells in humanoid cities, meeting in

secret  to  discuss  their  findings  and  argue  about  how  to  best

advance their racial agenda.

Language and

Literacy

True yuan-ti speak Common, Yuan-Ti, and

the  human  language  of  their  home

region.  This  affords  them  a  broad  range

of peoples with whom they can converse.

They  often  learn  Abyssal  and  Draconic

as well.

Servitor  yuan-ti  speak

the  languages  they  knew

before becoming a servitor.

They usually pick up Yuan-Ti

as well within a few months of

joining the yuan-tis service.

All  pureblood  yuan-ti  are  lit-

erate, except for barbarians.

All tainted ones are literate, ex-

cept for barbarians and commoners.

Abilities

and Racial

Features

Yuan-ti

Purebloods  and  tainted  ones  have

different racial features, as described below. Abominations,

halfbloods, and broodguards are not suitable as player character

races and so are not described here.

Pureblood yuan-ti have the following racial traits:

+2 Dexterity, +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +4 Charisma. Pure-

bloods are fast as a striking cobra, sharp as a serpents tooth,

and have the magnetism of a snake charmer.

Pureblood yuan-ti land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision up to 60 feet.

+1 natural armor.

Proficient with all simple weapons, scimitar, and longbow. Pro-

ficient with light armor and shields.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Hit  Dice:  A  yuan-ti  pureblood  has

6d8 racial Hit Dice. A pureblood character receives the max-

imum hit points for her first monstrous humanoid Hit Die

and rolls her other monstrous humanoid Hit Dice normally.

She  rolls  all  Hit  Dice  from  class  levels  and  does  not  auto-

matically  get  maximum  hit  points  on  her  first  class-level

152

MINOR RACES

Hit Die. A purebloods racial Hit Dice also provide a +6 base

attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +2, Ref +5, and Will

+5. Purebloods with class levels add their class attack bonus

and save bonuses to their racial attack bonus and saves.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Skills:  A  purebloods  monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  her  skill  points  equal  to  (2  +  Int

modifier) 9. Class skills for these skill points are Concentra-

tion,  Craft,  Knowledge,  Disguise,  Hide,  Listen,  and  Spot.  A

pureblood  does  not  get  the  4  multiplier  for  skill  points

acquired from her first class level.

Monstrous Humanoid Feats: Yuan-ti gain Alertness and Blind-

Fight  as  bonus  feats.  In  addition,  a  purebloods  monstrous

humanoid  Hit  Dice  grant  her  3  feats.  A  typical  pureblood

chooses  Dodge,  Expertise,  and  Improved  Initiative.  A  pure-

blood with class levels gains feats based on her total Hit Dice,

as shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.

Spell resistance 16 + class level.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayanimal trance, cause fear, deeper

darkness,  entangle,  neutralize  poison,  suggestion,  and  baleful

polymorph. Treat these as if cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save

DC 10 + Cha modifier + spell level).

Psionics (Sp): The yuan-ti can produce the following effects at will:

Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.

Alternate Form: The yuan-ti can assume the form of a Tiny

to Large viper. This is like a polymorph spell cast by an 8th-

level  sorcerer,  but  the  yuan-ti  does  not  regain  hit  points  for

changing forms, and she can only assume viper forms.

Chameleon Power: The yuan-ti can change her coloration to

match that of her surroundings. This grants her a +8 circum-

stance bonus on Hide checks.

Produce Acid:  The  yuan-ti  can  exude  acid.  This  deals  1d6

points  of  damage  to  anything  she  touches.  The  acid  is  inert

once it leaves the yuan-tis body.

Aversion: The yuan-ti can target one person within 30 feet

and create a compulsion effect in him. The subject must suc-

ceed at a Will save (DC 17) or gain an aversion to snakes for

10 minutes. A victim must stay at least 20 feet away from any

snake or yuan-tiliving or deador move until he is at least

20  feet  away.  The  victim  can  overcome  the  aversion  with

another Will save (DC 17), but even if he succeeds, he still suf-

fers  a  deep  anxiety  that  causes  a  4  reduction  to  Dexterity

while he is within 20 feet of a snake or yuan-ti. This lasts until

the effect wears off (up to 10 minutes). Otherwise, this is sim-

ilar to an antipathy spell cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.

Automatic Languages: Common, Yuan-Ti, home region. Bonus

Languages: By region, plus Abyssal and Draconic.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Level Adjustment: +5. Due to her 6 racial Hit Dice plus her

many powers and bonuses, a pureblood yuan-ti has an effective

character  level  of  11  plus  her  class  levels.  Thus,  a  9th-level

pureblood sorcerer would have an ECL of 20. See Table 1 in

the Introduction for more information.

Tainted ones have the following racial traits in addition to the

traits of the base creature:

+2  Constitution.  Surviving  the  transformation  makes  the

tainted one stronger.

Poison Bite: A tainted one gains a venomous bite, although he

does not gain a natural attack with which to deliver it. In order

to  use  his  poison,  he  must  make  a  successful  grapple  check

against a foe, and then make a successful melee attack. Fort

save (DC 10 + the tainted ones Con modifier) negates, initial

and secondary damage 1d4 temporary Constitution. The poison

can also be injected against an unresisting foe with a kiss.

Poison  Immunity:  Immune  to  all  forms  of  snake  venom,

including his own.

Spell resistance 12 +1 per two levels.

Psionics  (Sp):  The  tainted  one  can  produce  the  following

effects labeled in italics. Treat these as if cast by a sorcerer of

the tainted ones level.

Poison 1/day: Fort save (DC 13 + the tainted ones Con modifier).

Polymorph 3/day: Into viper forms only.

Feats: The tainted one gains Alertness as a bonus feat.

Automatic Languages: As base race. Bonus Languages: Abyssal,

Common, Draconic, Yuan-Ti.

Favored Class: By base creature.

Level  Adjustment:  +2.  Tainted  ones  are  more  powerful  and

gain  levels  more  slowly  than  the  common  races  of  Faern.

Their  many  powers  and  bonuses  comprise  this  level  adjust-

ment. A player may play a tainted one yuan-ti with class levels

as a character with total levels equal to his class levels +2. See

Table 1 in the Introduction for more information.

Yuan-Ti Magic and Lore

The yuan-ti have no new spells special to their race. Yuan-ti wiz-

ards and sorcerers choose spells from the Illusion and Transmu-

tation schools of magic, as these sorts of magics aid them in their

deceptions.

Yuan-Ti Deities

Yuan-ti  worship  Sseth,  a  serpentine  deity  conquered  and  con-

sumed by Set, who now grants spells in Sseths name. To them,

there are no other gods worth consideration. According to yuan-

ti  myth,  Sseth  helped  create  their  race  and  has  been  directing

them  ever  since.  Given  the  devoutness  of  the  yuan-ti,  its  clear

that Sseth has a strong effect on every aspect of their lives.

Relations with Other Races

Yuan-ti dont care for any of the other races. However, they have

a special relationship with humans, since they are one of the races

from  which  yuan-ti  are  descended.  Yuan-ti  wish  to  conquer,

enslave, or assimilate (via their servitor draught) as many humans

as possible. In return, humans loathe and fear the yuan-ti.

Yuan-Ti Equipment

The yuan-ti have no weapons or equipment special to their race.

However, they insist on using only tools of masterwork quality.

They favor scimitars and bows, and employ poisons of all sorts.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Yuan-ti have a strong affinity for snakes of all types, especially

venomous  snakes.  Many  snakes  kept  by  yuan-ti  acquire  the

fiendish template and grow to frightening proportions, becoming

creatures of supernatural evil and cunning. They protect yuan-ti

lairs, serve as sacred animals for receiving sacrifices to Sseth, and

provide companionship.

153

The  following  sections  detail  new  equipment,  feats,

magic items, monsters, prestige classes, and spells used

by the races and subraces detailed in this book.

Equipment

The following equipment is available in addition to that listed the

PLAYERS HANDBOOK, FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting,

and other sources.

Weapon Descriptions

The  weapons  in  Table  A-1  are  described  here  in  alphabetical

order.

Arrow, Flight: The light shaft and special design of this mas-

terwork arrow increases a bows range increment by 20 feet.

Arrow, Sea: These arrows, fletched by aquatic elves, are treated

as masterwork, but they dont grant a +1 enhancement bonus

on  attack  rolls.  Instead,  when  fired  from  an  aquatic  longbow,

they negate the 2 penalty per 5 feet for making a ranged attack

underwater.

Arrow, Signal: This masterwork arrow is specially designed to

emulate  a  birds  call  when  fired.  Wood  elf  fletchers  craft  the

arrows to make calls that will be recognized as signals by their

fellow elves. For example, a hawks cry might be used to signal

an  attack,  while  an  owls  cry  might  signal  a  stealthy  advance.

Anyone  overhearing  the  signal  may,  on  a  successful  Survival

check (DC 20), determine whether the call comes from a living

bird or another source. The intricate carving of the arrows makes

them clumsy in flight, resulting in a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

Aspergillum, Heavy: The common aspergillum (detailed in

the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Setting,  page  95)  is  a

lightweight  metal  device  resembling  a  small  club  or  light

mace  with  a  perforated  head  for  dispensing  holy  water.

Although  not  a  weapon  per  se,  it  can  be  used  in  combat  to

deliver ranged touch attacks.

The  heavy  aspergillum  combines  the  properties  of  a

common aspergillum with those of a heavy mace and is greatly

favored by members of the Impilturan church of Ilmater. A

heavy  aspergillum  can  hold  up  to  3  flasks  of  holy  water.  In

addition  to  serving  as  a  common  aspergillum,  it  can  also  be

used in melee combat. When a button on the shaft is pressed,

tiny holes open in the mace head, allowing holy water to touch

a  creature  struck  by  the  weapon.  Each  use  of  the  weapon  in

this manner uses one flask of holy water per attack whether or

not the attack is successful. If the wielder has multiple attacks

per round with the weapon, the holy water can be released mul-

tiple times in one round (but no more than once per attack)

until it is depleted. A heavy aspergillum may also be used to

make ranged touch attacks with holy water in the manner of

a normal aspergillum.

Pouring  a  flask  of  holy  water  into  an  aspergillum  or  heavy

aspergillum  is  a  standard  action  that  provokes  an  attack  of

opportunity.

Battle Gauntlet: This thick band of metal covers the forearm

and  part  of  the  hand.  Like  gauntlets  that  come  with  armor,

battle gauntlets allow the wearer to make unarmed strikes as if

he were armed. They can be fitted with spikes or blades (making

them  function  as  spiked  gauntlets  or  claw  bracers).  Because  a

battle  gauntlet  covers  the  hand  and  the  entire  forearm,  the

wearer cannot wear any other magical gauntlet or bracer on that

arm (or items that use those spaces on the body) while wearing

battle  gauntlets.  The  price  and  weight  on  Table  A1  is  for  a

single battle gauntlet.

Bolas, Two-Ball: A set of bolas consists of two heavy spheres

made of wood, stone, or metal connected by lengths of cord. It is

a ranged weapon used to trip an opponent. When you throw a set

of bolas, you make a ranged touch attack against your opponent.

If  you  hit,  your  opponent  must  succeed  on  a  Dexterity  or

Strength  check  opposed  by  your  Strength  check  or  be  tripped.

Bolas  can  only  trip  Medium-size  of  smaller  opponents.  Your

opponent cannot trip you when you make a trip attack with a set

of two-ball bolas.

 Double weapon.

Dart, Acid: When these hollow darts hit a target, they break,

splashing  the  victim  with  acid.  This  does  an  additional  1d6

points of acid damage in addition to the normal 1d4 piercing

damage from the dart itself. Once used, the dart is useless.

Dart,  Barbed: This  crude  and  heavy  throwing  dart  is  both

fletched  and  barbed.  It  measures  from  two  to  three  feet  long.

Lizardfolk usually hurl these at a target before charging into melee.

Dart, Stun: When one of these hollow darts hits a target, it

releases a small puff of poison gas. The victim must make a For-

titude  save  (DC  12)  or  be  stunned  for  one  round.  After  one

round, the target must make another Fortitude save (DC 12) or

be stunned for an additional 1d4 rounds.

APPENDIX

Goblin Stick: This is a forked and hooked pole arm, first used

by bugbears trying to catch hiding goblins. The wooden stick is 6

to 9 feet long, usually gripped in the middle. Each end is tipped

with  three  wicked  blades.  The  central  blade  is  hooked  to  help

extract targets from tight places. The other blades, which are set

off at slight angles and different directions from the center, are

used to poke around corners. A goblin stick is a double weapon

and can also be used to make trip attacks.

Harpoon, Arctic: Favored by arctic dwarves, the harpoon is a

broad-bladed spear forged with cruel barbs. The shaft of the har-

poon  has  a  trailing  rope  attached  to  control  harpooned  oppo-

nents.  Though  sometimes  used  for  hunting  whales  and  other

large sea creatures, the harpoon is equally at home on dry land.

If you deal damage to your opponent, the harpoon may lodge

in the victim if it fails a Reflex saving throw against a DC equal

to 10 + the damage you dealt. The harpooned creature moves at

only  half  speed  and  cannot  charge  or  run.  If  you  control  the

trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while

holding  it,  the  harpooned  creature  can  only  move  within  the

limits that the rope allows (the trailing rope is 30 feet long). If

the harpooned creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed

on a Concentration check (DC 15) or fail, losing the spell.

The harpooned creature can pull the harpoon from its wound

if it has two free hands and takes a full-round action to do so, but

in so doing it deals damage to itself equal to the initial damage

the  harpoon  caused  (in  other  words,  the  damage  coming  out

equals the damage going in). For example, if you hit with a har-

poon  and  deal  8  points  of  damage,  the  target  takes  another  8

points of damage when it removes the harpoon. A harpoon can

be removed safely with a successful Heal check (DC 10 + damage

dealt), but this requires 1 minute.

Helmet, Horned: A horned helmet resembles a normal helmet

with  bulls  horns  attached  to  each  side.  A  horned  helmet  deals

double normal damage when used during a charge action, but the

helmet has a reach of 0 ft.

Helmet, Spiked: A spiked helmet resembles a normal helmet

with a single spike standing straight out from the top. A spiked

helmet deals double normal damage when used during a charge

action, but the helmet has a reach of 0 ft.

Ice Axe: In addition to being an effective weapon, the ice axe

grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to a wielder pro-

ficient in its use.

Jambiya:  This  hooked  dagger,  common  among  the  Calishites

and Zakharans, leaves long, thin wounds in its target.

Lance, Flight: This is a 10-foot wooden shaft topped by blade.

The  back  end  is  fletched  to  keep  the  lances  flight  true.  This

weapon is normally used with a charge while flying, hurled at the

bottom of a swoop maneuver to impale the target. It may be used

as a melee weapon as if it were a shortspear.

Lasso: A lasso is little more than a thin rope knotted with a

slipknot that creates a large loop. The loop is thrown at a target

and the other end is pulled when the loop strikes, causing it to

tighten around the target. You can throw the lasso at a Medium-

size or smaller target, which requires a ranged touch attack. If

the  touch  attack  succeeds,  you  immediately  start  a  grapple

against  the  target  with  a  4  penalty  on  your  roll  (all  normal

grapple  modifiers  apply).  If  the  opponent  is  grappled  by  the

lasso, you may use an attack to attempt to trip the target. If you

are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso

to avoid being tripped. You cannot damage or pin the opponent

with the lasso, and you are not considered to be grappling when

using  the  lasso  to  grapple.  If  you  drop  the  lasso,  the  grappled

creature  only  needs  to  succeed  at  a  DC  10  grapple  or  Escape

Artist check to get out of the lasso.

If you secure one end of the lasso to the saddle of your mount,

you  can  use  the  mounts  size  and  strength  modifiers  for  your

grapple checks.

The maximum range for a lasso cannot exceed the length of

the rope, minus 5 feet.

Longbow,  Aquatic:  This  weapon,  favored  by  aquatic  elves,

employs a special kelp string that dampens vibration and turbu-

lence. The aquatic longbow functions as a normal longbow except

when sea arrows are fired from it underwater. In this case, the

weapon fires with the listed range

increment  and  no  penalty  for

being  underwater  (ranged  attacks

underwater  ordinarily  suffer  a

2  penalty  on  attack  rolls  for

every  5 feet  of  water  they  pass

through).  Mighty  composite  ver-

sions  of  the  aquatic  longbow  are

available (see Players Handbook

pages  113114),  costing  600  gp

for +1, 700 gp for +2, 800 gp for

+3, and 900 gp for +4.

Skiprock: These  polished,  per-

fectly  weighted  stones  are  prized

by  halflings,  for  if  thrown  prop-

erly by a proficient user they ric-

ochet  off  one  target  to  strike  a

second.  If  the  skiprock  hits  its

target, it ricochets toward another

target  of  the  throwers  choice

adjacent  to  the  original  target

(within  5  feet).  The  thrower

immediately  makes  a  second

attack roll, with an attack bonus

equal  to  the  first  rolls  attack

bonus 2. Skiprocks can be used as

sling bullets, but cannot make ric-

ochet  shots  when  used  as  ammu-

nition  unless  thrown  from  a

halfling warsling by a user profi-

cient  in  both  weapons.  A  skiprock

may be drawn as a free action.

Aquatic armors

modify  any  weapon  that  has  a  spike  at  the  end  of  a  long  pole

(such as battleaxes, morningstars, and most polearms). The spike

shooter allows the spike to be launched at a target as a normal

ranged  attack.  The  spike  shooter  is  an  inaccurate  weapon,  and

those who use it suffer a 2 penalty on the attack roll. Resetting

the spike is a full-round action.

Steelsword, Chondathan: Available in the Dalelands, Cormyr,

and  Sembia,  this  broad-bladed  one-handed  sword  is  treated  as  a

masterwork longsword that grants a +2 bonus when attempting

to break a foes weapon.

Warsling,  Halfling: Perfect  balance  and  sturdier  construction

distinguish  this  sling  from  its  simpler

counterparts.  The  listed  damage

assumes  skiprock  ammunition;  ordi-

nary sling bullets deal 1d4 points of

damage. If a user proficient in both

skiprock  and  the  warsling  throws

skiprocks with a warsling, they can be

ricocheted just as if they were thrown.

Armor

Descriptions

The types of armor found in Table

A2 are described below.

Chitin Armor: One of the most

bizarre-looking  of  all  the  armor

types,  chitin  armor  is  constructed

from the shells of giant vermin or

similar creatures. For aquatic elves,

giant  crabs  are  the  most  popular

sources  for  chitin  armor.  Chitin  is

flexible  and  can  be  rather  comfort-

able  to  wear,  especially  when  the

inner surfaces are polished and fitted

with  padding.  Chitin  armor  is  not

solely  the  invention  of  the  aquatic

elves;  some  savage  cultures  have

developed  the  same  type  of  armor

using  the  bony  plates  of  creatures

such as giant scorpions, ankheg, and

even remorhaz.

Spike  Shooter: This  is  a  modification  of  a  class  of  weapons,

rather than a specific weapon itself, and thus does not require any

additional  weapon  proficiency.  This  spring-driven  device  can

Dendritic Crystal: Dwarf armorsmiths grow dendritic armor

from  seed  crystals  deep  underground;  dendritic  armor  never

reaches the smiths fire. Each suit of dendritic armor is tailored

APPENDIX

for a specific wearer. This superb armor is socketed rather than

riveted together, leaving almost no gaps or chinks. It protects

better than full plate armor, but is also heavier and more cum-

bersome.

Dendritic armor constantly regrows itself to its original shape.

To remove dendritic armor, the wearer must break his way out,

succeeding at a Strength check (DC 22). As long as the wearer

leaves  at  least  5  pounds  of  dendritic  armor  somewhere  on  his

body, the armor grows back in 8 hours.

Grasping Shield: These spiked small metal shields have a pow-

erful  spring  inside  them.  By  releasing  the  spring,  the  wielder

causes  the  spikes  to  collapse  inward  toward  the  center  of  the

shield. When this is done in melee combat, it allows the user to

attempt to grasp and wrest away a weapon wielded by an oppo-

nent.  Like  all  shields,  a  grasping  shield  is  considered  a  light

weapon when attacking. The grasping attack, when used, allows

one  disarm  attempt.  This  disarm  attempt  does  not  provoke  an

attack of opportunity, nor does it allow the defender a chance to

disarm the attacker. All normal penalties for attacking with an

off hand or with two weapons apply to the disarm attempt.

Once sprung, the grasping shield functions as a normal small

metal shield until reset. Resetting the shield is a full-round action

that provokes an attack of opportunity.

Mud Armor: Creatures with access to the right sort of clays

and soils (generally found in warm forests, jungles, and swamps)

sometimes plaster their skin and hair with mud, creating a crude

but effective form of armor. Applying mud armor requires a suc-

cessful Survival check (DC 10). Mud armor crumbles into use-

lessness  after  1d2  days.  Adorning  yourself  or  another  creature

with mud armor takes 10 minutes, as does washing it off. Wild

dwarves are the only people who normally employ mud armor.

Sharkskin Armor: Sharkskin armor is similar to leather armor

in appearance but is in fact slightly tougher. Developed by reclu-

sive sects of rare evil aquatic elves, it is treated so that the sharp

scales covering the skin remain attached to the outer surface of

the  armor.  Additionally,  shark  teeth  are  embedded  along  the

forearms,  shoulders,  and  legs,  which  count  as  armor  spikes.

Sharkskin  armor  provides  a  +6  circumstance  bonus  on  Escape

Artist checks made when the armored individual is bound with

rope or similar easily cut materials.

Most  aquatic  elves  are  not  fond  of  sharks  (because  sahuagin

keep sharks as pets), and the thought of wearing sharkskin armor

is repugnant to the typical aquatic elf.

Special Materials

In addition to iron, steel, wood, and the usual materials for weap-

ons  and  armor,  otherworldly  substances  can  be  fashioned  into

adventuring  gear.  Adamantine,  mithral,  and  darkwood  are

described  in  Chapter  8  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide,  and

more special materials are detailed below.

Camouflage Dye: Wood elves use natural compounds derived

from  the  plants  of  their  forest  home  to  make  dyes  that  per-

fectly  match  the  surrounding  foliage.  Camouflage  dye  can  be

applied to padded, leather, hide, or studded leather armor, grant-

ing the wearer a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide checks in that

specific forest. Applying camouflage dye takes three days and

costs 300 gp.

Glassteel: Made by the avariels and sun elves in an alchemical

process  requiring  extensive  knowledge  of  both  metallurgy  and

glassblowing,  glassteel  combines  strength  beyond  iron  with  the

transparency of glass. Mostly used as a building material in fan-

tastic  castles,  glassteel  can  also  be  fashioned  into  weapons  and

armor. Glassteel is stronger and lighter than ironbut its fan-

tastically expensive.

Just  as  does  adamantine,  glassteel  grants  a  nonmagical  en-

hancement bonus to weapons and armor made with it. And like

mithral,  glassteel  armor  counts  as  one  category  lighter

(although  light  armor  is  still  light),  spell  failure  chance  is

decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2,

and armor check penalties are decreased by 3. Nonweapon and

nonarmor items made of glassteel weigh half what they other-

wise would.

Glassteel weapons and armor are hard to spot at a distance (4

penalty  on  Spot  checks),  but  just  because  armor  is  transparent

doesnt mean that the person underneath the armor is likewise

concealed. In combat, glassteels transparency is mostly a decora-

tive curiosity rather than a tactical advantage.

Glassteel has a hardness of 20 and 40 hit points per inch of

thickness.  Weapons  and  armor  fashioned  from  glassteel  are

treated as masterwork items with regard to creation times, but

the masterwork quality does not affect the enhancement bonus

of weapons nor the armor check penalty of armor.

Armor  Lubricant: This  nonmagical  oil  reduces  the  friction

that  impedes  movement  in  metallic  armor.  One  application  of

armor lubricant reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a min-

imum of 0). Each application takes 1 minute to apply and lasts

1d4 hours. It is not possible to apply armor lubricant to armor

158

APPENDIX

currently  being  worn.  Armor  lubricant  provides  no  benefit  to

shields or to armor not made primarily of metal.

Creating one application of armor lubricant requires a success-

ful Alchemy check (DC 15) and follows the rules outlined in the

discussion of Craft skills in the Players Handbook.

Crystal  Caltrops: These  special  caltrops  are  made  out  of  a

tough  crystal.  These  are  deployed  just  like  traditional  caltrops.

When they score a hit, they do normal damage and release a poi-

sonous gas. The victim must make a Fortitude save (DC 12) or

instantly  fall  asleep  for  1  minute.  After  1  minute,  the  target

must make another Fortitude save (DC 12) or sleep for an addi-

tional 1d4 minutes. The gas affects creatures immune to magical

sleep, but not creatures immune to poison.

Drogue Wing: This pleated cloak unfurls into a gliding batlike

wing  15  feet  across  if  the  wearer  falls  more  than  20  feet.  A

drogue wing needs another 20 feet of falling distance in order to

arrest the wearers fall and unrestricted (at least 50 feet in diam-

eter) gliding room. If all three conditions are met, a drogue wing

negates  falling  damage.  Once  deployed,  a  drogue  wing  must  be

carefully refolded (a tedious task that requires 1 full hour) before

it  can  be  reused.  There  is  a  25%  chance  that  a  drogue  wing  is

ruined after each use. Drogue wings are popular among the hip-

pogriff-mounted skyriders of the Great Rift.

Footsaw Trap: This item is similar to others of its kind that

are  typically  designed  to  trap  large  animals  such  as  bears  or

cougars.  Its  jaws  are  fitted  with  thin  saw  blades  mounted  on

springs, and the mechanism is designed to cut the feet of any cap-

tive  who  struggles  against  its  grip.  The  ghostwise  hin  did  not

invent this trap, but they have made excellent use of it: When

enemies threaten, they salt the ground near their campsites with

these dangerous devices, hiding them under thin layers of leaves

or soil. A creature can discover a concealed footsaw trap with a

successful Search check (DC 15). Once found, the trap can be dis-

abled with a successful Disable Device check (DC 15).

Anyone  who  walks  over  a  footsaw  trap  triggers  it;  the  trap

makes a melee touch attack with a +8 bonus. If its attack is suc-

cessful,  the  trap  deals  1d6  points  of  damage  to  the  victim.  A

victim  caught  in  a  footsaw  trap  can  move  at  half  speed  if  the

device is not attached to another object (such as to a tree or boul-

der by a length of chain). If it is attached in such a fashion, the

victim  must  break  the  attachment,  otherwise  he  cannot  move.

The trap inflicts an additional 1d4 points of damage from the

saw  blades  every  round  that  a  trapped  victim  takes  any  action

that  involves  movement.  A  trapped  creature  can  pry  open  the

jaws of the trap and escape (Strength check DC 25) or loose him-

self with an Escape Artist check (DC 30). Failure means that the

trap deals another 1d4 points of damage to the victim and that

the victim remains trapped.

A footsaw trap is a CR 2 trap. They can be constructed with

the Craft (trapmaking) skill (DC 20).

Mobile  Brace: This  small  staff  can  extend  and  lock  at  any

length from 5 to 11 feet. It is commonly used to make a sturdy

brace across a passage, granting a sure purchase for one or more

ropes.  A  properly  set  brace  can  support  up  to  400  pounds  of

weight (less if the walls are soft, slippery, crumbling, or otherwise

offer  unsure  purchase).  Setting  a  brace  allows  characters  to

securely set a rope or grappling hook where doing so would nor-

mally  be  impossible.  Adventuring  groups  can  send  a  skilled

climber or jumper to negotiate tricky ascents or dangerous falls,

set  a  brace  on  the  far  side  of  the  obstacle,  and  then  give  less

nimble characters something to hang on to while they cross the

dangerous area.

APPENDIX

Potion Bladder: This is a flexible, narrow-necked pouch, usu-

ally made of oiled leather or the preserved stomach of a small

animal.  Used  extensively  by  water-dwelling  creatures  such  as

aquatic  elves,  these  pouches  hold  1  ounce  of  liquid  (the  same

volume  as  a  potion)  and  can  be  squeezed  carefully  to  allow

drinking of fluids (such as potions) underwater without spilling.

Rope Climber: This hand-held device consists of a powerful

winch and locking wheel assembly that fits most standard ropes.

When  threaded  with  a  rope,  the  winch  offers  one-way  travel

with the benefit of tremendous leverage. Using the climber to

ascend a rope grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks,

but it halves the rate of ascent. Threading a rope through the

climber is a full-round action, as is removing it from a rope.

The locking wheels turn only in one direction, preventing the

user from slipping back down the rope. However, this means

that  for  two  people  to  use  the  same  rope  climber,  one  must

ascend the rope, remove the device, and lower it back down to

the next user.

Snowshoes: Fashioned of wood and strips of rawhide or sinew,

snowshoes are invaluable for movement across deep snow. Snow-

shoes eliminate the hampered movement penalty for movement

across  deep  snow  but  impose  a  1/2  movement  penalty  across

other types of terrain (see Hampered Movement in Chapter 9

of the Players Handbook, pages 142143).

Wagon Shields: These are large wooden shields (generally of

solid  oak)  reinforced  with  iron.  They  can  be  quickly  fitted

together  to  protect  wagons  and  similar  open-topped  vehicles.

One  person  can  mount  a  wagon  shield  as  a  full-round  action.

Two people working together can mount a shield as a standard

action. Once mounted, each shield provides a Small character in

the wagon with three-quarters cover; a Medium-size character

gains one-half cover behind a wagon shield. Each wagon shield

has hardness 5 and 30 hit points. Some are fitted with arrow slits

to allow those inside the wagon to fire on attackers without addi-

tional exposure.

Most  wagons  in  Luiren  are  constructed  with  special  racks

beneath the wagon bed that hold six shields. The shields are nor-

mally sold in quantities of six, as that is the number required to

fully protect the average Luiren wagon.

Special Item Descriptions

In addition to the more common items found on other equip-

ment  lists,  more  unusual  items  are  available  to  those  with

Drow  Poison:  Drow  are  renowned  for  their  use  of  uncon-

sciousness-inducing  poison  in  subterranean  ambushes.  The  dark

elves carefully guard the secret of their venom, and it is exceed-

ingly difficult to find it outside drow realms and outposts.

Type:  Injury  DC  13;  Initial  Damage:  Unconsciousness  for  1

minute;  Secondary  Damage:  Unconsciousness  for  2d4  hours;

Price: 75 gp.

Flash Grenade: A creation of the deep gnomes (svirfneblin),

this small sphere about the size of a chicken egg requires a ranged

touch  attack  to  hit  (range  increment  10  ft.)  and  scatters  as  a

grenadelike weapon. It is effective only when thrown into a fire

source, where it explodes in a brilliant flash of light. Any crea-

ture within 10 feet must make a successful Fortitude save (DC

10) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Creatures with light blindness

(such as drow) are affected as if a daylight spell had been cast.

There  is  no  effect  if  the  grenade  misses  the  fire,  although  the

grenade is ruined.

Instant Campfire: An instant campfire consists of a leather

bag filled with tinder, logs, and fuel. The drawstring that holds

the sack shut is studded with tiny flakes of flint and steel; the

sack itself is alchemically treated so that it catches fire easily.

When the drawstring is pulled, the entire bag immolates, cre-

ating  a  Tiny  campfire  (suitable  for  cooking)  in  1  round.  The

campfire  lasts  for  30  minutes  after  ignition,  but  can  be  fed

with dry wood just like any other fire. These items ignite even

in moderate rain, but burn out quickly in wet conditions unless

shelter is provided.

Wild Dwarf Knockout Poison: Wild dwarves coat their blow-

gun darts with poison made from a plant that grows only in the

Jungles of Chult. Wild dwarves are immune to the effects of the

poison.

Type: Injury DC 14; Initial Damage: slow effect for 5 rounds;

Secondary Damage: Unconsciousness for 1 minute; Price: 150 gp.

Feats

This  section  contains  all  the  new  feats  mentioned  in  this

book.  Some  of  these  feats  are  limited  to  drow,  elves,  or  orcs:

half-drow may select drow feats, half-elves may select any elf

feat of the appropriate type, and half-orcs and tanarukks may

select orc feats.

If  a  feat  lists  a  human  ethnic  group  as  a  prerequisite,  you

must  be  a  human  of  that  ethnicity.  You  need  not  select  the

region of that ethnic group, or a region where people of that

ethnic group live. For example, if a feat lists Illuskan human as

a prerequisite, you need only be a human of Illuskan heritage

you do not need to take the Illuskan region, or a region such

as  The  North  or  the  Moonshaes  where  Illuskans  are  most

commonly found.

Aftersight [General]

You have a trace of the Sight in your blood, an unreliable gift

Regions: Rashemen, Thay.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can attempt to invoke a

viding a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (history) and bardic knowl-

edge checks for the next minute. This feat does not grant bardic

knowledge if it is not already possessed.

had cast animal friendship with a caster level of 1st. The animals

animal friends are lost, you may replace them after one month.

Special: You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you

take it, you gain another 2 HD of animal friends. These HD do

not stack with any previous times you took this feat; therefore

you cannot have an animal companion with more than 2 HD.

You can allow a person adjacent to you to breathe water.

Prerequisites: Base Will save +2, aquatic elf or water genasi.

Benefit: As a free action on your turn, you may select one crea-

ture  within  5  feet  of  you  and  give  that  creature  the  ability  to

breathe water as easily as you do. This supernatural ability renews

automatically  for  that  creature  until  you  direct  the  ability  to

another creature or withdraw your power from it (a free action).

The creatures ability to breathe water ends immediately if you

are separated by more than 5 feet or if you die, at which point

the creature begins to drown if it is still underwater. This ability

does not hamper the creatures ability to breathe air, nor does it

change the creatures ability (or inability) to swim.

Special: You may select this feat more than once. Each time

you  take  this  feat,  you  may  affect  an  additional  creature  with

this ability. All such creatures need to remain within 5 feet of

you  (not  each  other).  If  one  creature  exceeds  the  range  of  this

ability, it has no effect on the other creatures you are helping.

and have mastered its mysterious lore. You may choose to spe-

cialize in air magic or fire magic.

Benefit: You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell from the

Air tradition or Fire tradition, depending on which tradition you

select when you choose this feat. This bonus caster level allows

you to exceed the normal maximum damage allowed by a spell,

so an 11th-level caster of the Air tradition creates an 11d6 light-

ning bolt instead of a 10d6 lightning bolt. If you are a wizard, you

may add a spell in your tradition to your spellbook for free when

you become able to cast it. This does not count against the two

free spells you add to your spellbook at each class level.

The Tradition of Air magic consists of the following spells at

the appropriate levels: 0mage hand; 1stshocking grasp; 2nd

levitate;  3rdlightning  bolt;  4thshout;  5thtelekinesis;  6th

Close-Quarter Fighting

[Fighter, General]

You are skilled at resisting grapple attacks from creatures that

usually grapple opponents.

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: When  you  are  attacked  by  a  creature  with  the

improved grab ability, you may still make an attack of opportu-

nity. Any damage you inflict with this attack of opportunity pro-

voked by the grapple attempt is added to your ensuing grapple

check to avoid being grappled.

For example, a dire bear strikes you with a claw attack. If you

dont have this feat, the dire bears improved grab ability allows

it to immediately attempt a grapple check, provoking no attack

of opportunity from you. However, with Close-Quarter Fighting,

you are entitled to an attack of opportunity. If you hit and score

8  points  of  damage,  you  may  add  +8  (plus  your  attack  bonus,

Strength bonus, and size modifier) to your grapple check to resist

the dire bears grapple attempt.

Normal: A creature without this feat does not get an attack of

opportunity  against  a  creature  with  the  improved  grab  ability

that tries to grapple it.

countered by spells such as daylight. All other effects (duration,

area of darkness, and so on) are as the darkness spell. You can use

your darkness ability two additional times per day, so if you nor-

mally could use darkness as a spell-like ability 1/day, you can now

use it 3/day.

You have learned the secrets of gold dwarf magic that creates or

enhances weapons.

Prerequisites: Gold dwarf.

Benefit: You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell that cre-

ates a weapon or enhances an existing one. An 11th-level caster

you  are  holding  anything  in  either  hand.  You  must  use  both

hands to make the unarmed attack.

Harem Trained [General]

Benefit:  Instead  of  a  normal

charge  attack,  you  can  perform  a

charge  that  provokes  attacks  of

opportunity  from  every  foe  who

can  reach  its  path,  including  the

opponent  you  attack.  A  headlong

rush  otherwise  functions  like  a

charge  attack  (+2  attack,  2  AC,

straight-line  movement  only),

except  that  a  successful  attack  deals

double damage.

instead  may  touch  the  flame  and  heal  yourself  a  number  of  hit

points of damage depending upon the size of the fire. This counts

as  a  use  of  your  control  flame ability  for  the  day.  Touching  the

flame  causes  you  no  harm  when  you  use  this  ability,  but  if  you

enter the flame, touch more than just its edge, or remain in con-

tact with it for more than 1 round, you take damage from the fire.

Improved Energy

Resistance [General]

Choose  one  form  of  energy  to  which  you  have  a  natural  (not

spell- or item-granted) resistance. Your inherent resistance to this

kind of energy is more effective than normal.

Prerequisite: Naturally  resistant  to  a  form  of  energy  (acid,

cold, electricity, fire, sonic).

Benefit: Your resistance to that type of energy increases by 5.

For  example,  if  you  are  an  aasimar,  you  normally  have  acid,

cold, and electricity resistance 5. You could use this feat to increase

one of those resistances to 10; the other two are unaffected.

Master gains a +2 bonus on Hide and Listen checks

Deathfangs can only be acquired as familiars if the master is evil and has the Spell Focus (Necromancy) feat.

This creature is described in the Monsters section of this appendix (see pages 174178).

Special: You  can  gain  this  feat  multiple  times.  Its  effects  do

not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to another type

of energy to which you have a natural resistance.

Improved Familiar

[General]

See the discussion of the Improved Familiar feat in Chapter 1 of

the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Setting.  Table  A5  shows

additional improved familiars from this book that are available

with this feat.

Improved Flight [General]

You  gain  greater  maneuverability  when  flying  than  you  would

normally have.

Prerequisite: Ability  to  fly  (naturally,  magically,  or  through

shapechanging).

Benefit: Your maneuverability class while flying improves by

one grade. For example, if your normal maneuverability class is

poor, it becomes average.

Improved Levitation

[General]

You have learned to use part of your levitate spell-like ability at

a time, allowing multiple uses with a shorter duration.

Prerequisite: Naturally able to levitate as a spell-like ability.

Benefit: You  may  use  your  levitate spell-like  ability  in  10-

minute increments instead of all at once. The number of times

per day you may now use the ability at this shorter duration is

equal to your caster level.

For example, if you are an air genasi, you normally have the

ability to levitate once per day as a spell-like ability as if cast by

a 5th-level sorcerer, allowing you to levitate once per day for up

to 50 minutes. With this feat, you can now levitate five times

per day, each time for up to 10 minutes.

If you could levitate more than once per day, multiply your

caster  level  by  the  number  of  times  per  day  to  get  the  total

number of shorter uses of levitate that you have. For example,

a creature that could use levitate two times per day as a spell-like

ability as if cast by a 5th-level sorcerer would be able to levitate

10 (25) times per day, each time for up to 10 minutes.

Improved Low Blow

[Fighter, General]

You are especially good at using the Low Blow feat.

Prerequisites: Dodge, Mobility, Low Blow, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: Using the Low Blow feat does not provoke an attack

of opportunity when you move into an opponents square to per-

form the attack.

Normal: A  character  with  the  Low  Blow  feat  may  enter  an

adjacent opponents square to make a single attack, then return to

his own square. The opponent is considered flat-footed against the

attack, but the character is subject to an attack of opportunity.

Improved Natural Armor

[General]

Your skin is even tougher than that of most of your kind.

Prerequisite: Racially granted natural armor.

Benefit: Your racially granted natural armor bonus increases by +1.

Special: A  character  can  gain  this  feat  multiple  times.  Each

time the character gains this feat, his natural armor improves by

an additional +1.

Infernal Bargainer [General]

You are comfortable making deals with powerful entities from

the Lower Planes.

Prerequisite: Outsider.

Benefit: Whenever  you  cast  commune,  contact  other  plane,

legend  lore,  or  vision,  you  gain  +2  caster  level  because  you  are

known to the entities answering your entreaties.

Whenever  you  cast  any  planar  binding  or  planar  ally  spell,

you can call an evil creature 2 HD higher than normally allowed.

Any evil creature caught in a planar binding trap you create

has a 2 penalty on all attempts to escape.

Iron Mind [General]

You are descended from duergar who escaped enslavement by the

illithids. The blood of these psionic-resistant former thralls runs

thick in your veins.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, gray dwarf.

Region: Gray dwarf.

Benefit: You  receive  a  +4  bonus  on  saving  throws  against

psionic effects, such as those employed by a mind flayer or yuan-

ti, and a +1 bonus on Will saves.

165

APPENDIX

Jotunbrud [General]

You  are  descended  from  the  giants  who  ruled  the  mountain-

spanning  empire  of  Ostoria  in  ages  past,  and  possess  a  truly

impressive stature.

Prerequisites: Damaran or Illuskan human.

Regions: Damara, The North.

Benefit: Whenever you receive a modifier based on your size

on  an  opposed  roll  (such  as  during  grapple  and  bull  rush

attempts),  you  are  treated  as  Large  if  thats  advantageous  to

you.  You  are  also  considered  to  be  Large  when  determining

whether  a  monsters  special  attacks  based  on  size  (such  as

improved grab or swallow whole) affect you.

If you wish to determine your characters height and weight

randomly, your base height is 6(cid:1)4(cid:2) (male) or 6(cid:1)0(cid:2) (female), and

your base weight is 210 lb. (male) or 170 lb. (female). Refer to

Table 66 in the Players Handbook.

Special: You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.

Jungle Stamina [General]

You are acclimated to the disease-ridden jungles of southwestern

Faern.

Regions: Chult,  Tashalar  (Mhair  and  Black  Jungles  only),

wild dwarf.

Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on all Survival checks and a

+2 bonus on Fortitude saves versus disease.

Landwalker [General]

You can survive out of water for a longer period of time than

most of your kind.

Prerequisite: Aquatic elf.

Benefit: You can survive out of water for 3 hours per point

of  Constitution.  After  this  point  you  must  make  a  Fortitude

saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or

you begin to suffocate.

Normal: Aquatic elves can survive out of water for one hour

per point of Constitution; after this point they begin to suffo-

cate (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide).

Light to Daylight [General]

Your  inherent  ability  to  create  light  is  more  powerful  than

normal.

Prerequisite: Able to use light as a spell-like ability.

Benefit: When using your spell-like ability to create light, you

may  instead  create  daylight.  All  other  features  of  this  ability

(caster level, countering darkness spells and effects) are as if you

were creating light. You can use your light ability two additional

times per day, so if you normally could use light as a spell-like

ability 1/day, you can now use it 3/day.

For example, if you were an aasimar, you could create either

light or daylight three times per day as a spell-like ability, as if

cast by a sorcerer of your character level.

Lightbringer [General]

You  can  channel  positive  energy  into  your  spells  so  that  they

glow with holy power.

Prerequisite: Damaran human, able to cast divine spells, able

to turn undead.

Benefit: Whenever you cast a spell, you can expend three of

your daily turn attempts to infuse the spell with positive energy.

Each round you do this immediately prior to casting the spell,

you gain +2 spell power (+2 on save DCs and +2 bonus on checks

to  overcome  spell  resistance).  Infusing  a  spell  with  positive

energy is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of

opportunity. The turn attempts are wasted if you dont cast a

spell immediately after spending one or more rounds infusing it.

Lolths Blessing [General]

The Spider Queen has blessed you with additional magical abilities.

Prerequisites: Drow, Wis 15, patron deity Lolth, able to cast

3rd-level divine spells.

Benefit: You  may  use  clairaudience/clairvoyance,  detect  lie,

dispel  magic,  and  suggestion once  per  day  as  spell-like  abilities

with a caster level equal to your character level.

Low Blow [Fighter, General]

You can get underfoot and attack creatures larger than you.

Prerequisites: Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can enter an area occupied

by an opponent who is at least one size category larger than you.

You can then make a single melee attack at your highest attack

bonus against this creature, who is considered flat-footed against

the attack. After your attack, you return to the 5-foot square

from which you entered the opponents square. Using this feat

provokes attacks of opportunity.

Metallurgy [General]

You are skilled in the art of metallurgy, creating metal alloys

both for their appearance and their properties.

Region: Gold dwarf.

Benefit: You receive a +3 bonus on all Craft (armorsmithing,

blacksmithing, or weaponsmithing) checks.

Might Makes Right [General]

Your great strength draws more followers.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Leadership.

Benefit: Add your Strength bonus to your leadership score for

the purposes of determining how many followers you may have

with the Leadership feat.

Nobodys Fool [General]

You have an uncommon streak of skepticism and common sense,

and have a knack for discerning falsehood from truth.

Prerequisite: Wis 13.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all Sense Motive checks and

Gather Information checks.

166

APPENDIX

Oral History [General]

You are well versed in the art of storytelling and the oral history

of your culture.

Regions: The Moonshaes, The North, arctic dwarf, gold dwarf,

shield dwarf.

Benefit: You  get  a  +2  bonus  on  all  Knowledge  (history)  and

Perform checks.

Outsider Wings [General]

You have sprouted wings appropriate to your heritage, revealing

the power of your supernatural bloodline.

Prerequisites: Aasimar or tiefling, base Fortitude, Reflex, and

Will saves +2, Celestial Bloodline or Fiendish Bloodline.

Benefit: You gain wings (feathered if an aasimar, batlike if a

tiefling), allowing you to fly at your land speed (average maneu-

verability). A medium or heavy load that would reduce your land

speed reduces your fly speed a proportionate amount.

Plague Resistant [General]

You are descended from the handful of combatants who fought

on the Fields of Nun and survived Chondaths Rotting War in

the 902 DR.

Prerequisites: Chondathan human.

Region: The Vilhon Reach.

Benefit: You get a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against

disease  and  spells  or  effects  that  produce  disease.  This  bonus

applies on saving throws to fight off ability damage from disease,

as well as saving throws against the initial exposure to the disease.

Planetouched Animal

Affinity [General]

You have a special affinity for a kind of animal associated with

your deity ancestor.

Prerequisites: Aasimar, tiefling, earth genasi.

Benefit: Choose a divine ancestor from the list below. You gain a

+4  bonus  on  Animal  Empathy  and  Handle  Animal  checks  when

dealing with animals associated with your divine ancestor. You may

make untrained Animal Empathy checks to affect such animals, as

well  as  celestial  (if  you  are  an  aasimar)  or  fiendish  (if  you  are  a

tiefling) animals as if they were animals.

See the table for a summary of Mulhorandi deities and their

favored animals.

Primitive Caster [General]

You use screeches, wild gesticulations, and extra material com-

ponents to give your spells additional power.

Benefit: This feat only functions when you cast a spell that

does not already have a verbal, somatic, or material component.

For each component you voluntarily add, you increase the effec-

tive  level  of  the  spell  by  +1.  You  can  only  add  a  component

thats not already present in the spell. For example, you cant

add  a  somatic  component  to  a  gaseous  form spell,  because  it

already has one. You could add a verbal component, however.

The  verbal  component  you  add  consists  of  animalistic

shouts, screams, and growls. The DC of Listen checks to hear

you  cast  a  spell  is  5  (before  modifying  for  distance).  The

somatic  component  is  also  more  complex,  so  you  must  have

two hands free to add a somatic component with this feat. The

extra  material  component  you  add  with  this  feat  must  be  a

rare  plant  found  in  the  forest  with  a  successful  Profession

(herbalist) check (DC 15).

Rapid Swimming [General]

You are one with the water.

Prerequisites: Base Fortitude save +2, natural swim speed.

Benefit: Your swim speed increases by 20 feet.

Normal: A water genasi normally has a swim speed of 30 feet.

An aquatic elf normally has a swim speed of 40 feet.

Reckless Offensive

[Fighter, General]

You lower your guard in order to make a telling attack.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +2, Power Attack.

Benefit: On  your  action,  before  making  attack  rolls  for  a

round, you may choose to take a 4 penalty to your AC during

the round to gain a +2 competence bonus on all melee attacks in

the same round. The penalty to AC and bonus on melee attacks

apply until your next action. You cannot use Reckless Offensive

with ranged attacks.

Rock Gnome Trickster

[General]

Your glamers are particularly likely to fool the senses of your target.

Prerequisite: Rock gnome.

Benefit:  Your  Illusion  (glamer)  spells  and  spell-like  abilities

gain +1 spell power (+1 on save DCs and +1 bonus on checks to

overcome spell resistance).

Runesmith [General]

You can fashion runes that take the place of material compo-

nents for your spells.

Prerequisites: 4 ranks in Craft (rune).

Benefit: You can make runes that take the place of traditional

material components for spells you cast. The runes, often carved

into stone talismans or stamped onto small plates of metal, cost

1 gp each and have a Craft (rune) DC of 15. Unlike a material

167

APPENDIX

component,  a  rune  does  not  disappear  when  you  cast  a  spell;

having  this  feat  effectively  turns  a  material  component

required for a spell into a focus.

Your use of runes makes your spells more difficult to counter-

spell. Other spellcasters who observe you casting a spell take a 4

penalty on checks to determine which spell youre casting, unless

they also have the Runesmith feat.

Spells with costly material components are unaffected by this feat.

Sacred Tattoo [General]

You have been spiritually touched by one of the god-kings of the

Old Empires and bear his or her symbol in the form of a tattoo

in the shape of a holy symbol.

Prerequisite: Patron  deity  from  the  Mulhorandi  or  Untheric

pantheon.

Benefit: Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells

you  cast  in  an  area  consecrated/desecrated  or  hallowed/unhal-

lowed to your deity. You get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to

beat a creatures spell resistance when casting spells in such areas.

Special: It is not possible to take both this feat and the Tattoo

Magic feat.

Shadow Shield [General]

Your  ancestors  long  battled  the  insidious  influence  of  shadow

magic,  and  some  of  their  descendants  (including  you)  have  a

greater resistance to its effects.

Prerequisites: Talfir or Tethyrian human of any region.

Region: The Western Heartlands.

Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells

and spell-like abilities with the shadow descriptor. You also get a

+2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abili-

ties that draw on the magic of the Shadow Weave. These benefits

stack with each other.

Shadow Song [General]

A  dark  legacy  of  the  Shadowkings  ambitions  is  the  shadow  of

sorrow that cloaks many Tethyrian songs and ballads. Some bards

have learned to infuse their performances with the sense of loss

and suffering that suffuses the Shadow Weave.

Prerequisites: Shadow Weave Magic, bardic music.

Region: The Western Heartlands.

Benefit: You get a +1 bonus to the DC for all saving throws of

spells you cast from the school of Enchantment and spells with

the sonic descriptor. You get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to

overcome  spell  resistance  for  these  schools  and  spells.  These

bonuses stack with bonuses from the Shadow Weave Magic feat.

Shield Dwarf Warder

You are a student of the protective magics of the shield dwarves,

learned at great cost during centuries of warfare and wandering.

Prerequisites: Shield dwarf.

Benefit: You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell that cre-

ates or enhances a suit of armor or a shield.

The  tradition  of  shield  dwarf  warders  includes  the  following

spells at the appropriate levels: 1stentropic shield, mage armor,

shield,  shield  of  faith;  2ndshield  other;  3rdmagic  vestment;

4thfire shield; 6thstone body; 8thiron body, shield of law.

Other spells gain this benefit if they target a suit of armor or

shield.

Additionally, any magic armor or shield you create costs 5%

less gold pieces to make. The experience point cost is unaffected.

Skyrider [General]

You  have  trained  and  served  with  the  hippogriff  cavalry  that

guards the Great Rift.

Prerequisites: Ride (hippogriff) skill, Mounted Combat.

Region: Gold dwarf.

Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride

(hippogriff) checks.

Southern Magician [General]

Your magical studies in Mulan lands have taught you spellcast-

ing techniques unknown in the north that blur the line between

arcane and divine magic.

Prerequisite: Mulan human, ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

Benefit:  Once  per  day  per  two  spellcaster  levels,  you  can

cast  a  divine  spell  as  an  arcane  spell,  or  vice  versa.  This

enables  you  to  bypass  arcane  spell  failure  due  to  armor,  or

gain  additional  benefit  from  spell  that  functions  differently

for  a  divine  caster  instead  of  an  arcane  caster,  such  as  true

seeing or magic weapon.

Spells changed with this feat are often confusing to whose who

havent  studied  Mulan  magic.  Spellcasters  who  dont  have  this

feat suffer a 4 penalty on attempts to counterspell or dispel this

spell, and they must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + spell

level) to detect the spell with detect magic.

The actual source of the spells power doesnt change, nor does

its means of preparation. You are merely weaving the strands of

magic together in an unconventional way that makes the spell

behave somewhat differently.

Spell-Like Ability Focus

[General]

Choose one of your spell-like abilities. This attack becomes more

potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Spell-like ability.

Benefit: Add  +2  to  the  DC  for  all  saving  throws  against  the

spell-like ability on which you focus.

Special: You  can  gain  this  feat  multiple  times.  Its  effects  do

not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell-

like ability.

Spire Walking [General]

Iriaebor is justly known as the City of a Thousand Spires, for fan-

tastically bizarre, many-storied towers rise from all quarters of

the city and are tightly packed together. As a result, it is possible

to navigate Iriaebor via a network of arches, bridges, stairs, and

leapable gulfs far above the city streets. You are well versed in

the skill of navigating the skyroads of Iriaebor.

Region: The Western Heartlands.

Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Balance and Jump checks.

168

APPENDIX

Staggering Strike

[Fighter, General]

You  are  particularly  adept  at  making  cruel  and  demoralizing

sneak attacks.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6, sneak attack ability.

Benefit: If  you  hit  with  a  sneak  attack,  you  may  choose  to

forgo a variable number (chosen by you at the time of the strike)

of dice of sneak attack damage to deliver a particularly horrify-

ing  and  disgusting  wound.  The  victim  of  a  staggering  strike

becomes staggered for a number of rounds equal to one-third the

number of dice of damage you choose to forgo. For exam-

ple, if you could sneak attack for +6d6 damage, you

could forgo all that extra damage to stagger the

target for 2 rounds.

Stonewalker Fist

[Fighter, General]

You are trained in an unarmed fighting style that draws on your

ability to pass through minerals as if they were air.

Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, urdunnir.

Region: Urdunnir.

Benefit: By  altering  the  elemental  structure  of  your  fists  in

order to strike through a creatures armor, you may ignore up to

a +4 armor bonus due to metal or stone armor or shields. (This

in  no  way  affects  or  damages  the  armor.)  You  cannot  use  this

ability on creatures with the earth subtype. Using this abil-

ity is a free action.

Special: A  character  may  gain  this  feat  twice  at

most, but the effects stack.

Stoneblood

[General]

Your  blood  is  thick  like  cooling  lava,

making  it  difficult  for  you  to  die  after

falling from injuries.

Prerequisites: Con 13, urdunnir.

Region: Urdunnir.

Benefit: When dying, you have a 50% chance per

round to stabilize and stop bleeding to death.

Normal: A character normally has a 10% chance

to stabilize when dying.

Hammersphere

Stone Colossus

[Fighter, General]

You can focus a part of your power to increase the toughness of

your skin.

Prerequisites: Base Fortitude save +3, earth genasi.

Benefit: When you use the attack action or full attack action

in melee, you can take a penalty of as much as 5 on your attack

and add the same number (up to +5) to your Armor Class as a

natural  armor  bonus.  This  number  may  not  exceed  your  base

attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Armor Class last

until your next action.

Stoneshaper [General]

You have a deep and abiding tie to earth and stone.

Prerequisites: Craft (stonemasonry) skill, stonecunning.

Region: Gold dwarf, gray dwarf, shield dwarf, urdunnir.

Benefit: You  receive  a  +2  bonus  on  Craft  (stonemasonry)

checks and a +2 bonus on Stonecunning checks.

Stone Slide [General]

You have attuned yourself to stone to such an extent that you

can merge with it for a short time.

Prerequisites: Base Fortitude save +4, earth genasi.

Benefit: Instead of using your spell-like ability to pass without

trace, you may instead meld into stone as a 5th-level druid. This

uses your ability to pass without trace for the day.

169

Summon Earth

Elemental [General]

Like many experienced deep gnomes, you have

developed the ability to summon earth ele-

mentals to help you with tasks.

Prerequisites: Deep  gnome,  charac-

ter level 6th.

Benefit: Once  per  day,  you  may

summon an earth elemental. If acting alone, you

may only summon a Small earth elemental. For

each additional deep gnome employing this feat in conjunction

with you, you may summon an earth elemental one size larger

(see  the  table  on  Monster  Manual page  83).  For  example,  a

group of four deep gnomes with this feat can summon a Huge

earth elemental, and a group of six deep gnomes can summon an

elder earth elemental. Working together in this fashion uses this

ability for all involved gnomes for the day.

This  is  a  spell-like  ability  and  is  treated  as  if  the  characters

involved are casting a summon monster spell of the appropriate

level, with the exception that they can only summon earth ele-

mentals. Unlike the spell, you cannot use this ability to summon

multiple elementals at a time.

Svirfneblin Figment

Master [General]

Your  time  underground  has  made  you  acutely  aware  of  even

slight differences in sound and vision in caves that have never

seen  the  sun.  Accordingly,  your  illusions  are  finely  tuned  and

ultra-realistic.

Prerequisite: Deep gnome.

Benefit:  Your  Illusion  (figment)  spells  and  spell-like  abilities

gain +1 spell power (+1 on save DCs and +1 bonus on checks to

overcome spell resistance).

Swarmfighting

[Fighter, General]

You  and  allies  with  this  feat  can  coordinate  melee  attacks

against a single target and are adept at fighting side by side in

close quarters.

APPENDIX

Prerequisites: Size Small, Dex 13, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: You can occupy the same 5-foot square in combat with

any other allied Small or smaller creature that also possesses the

Swarmfighting  feat.  Up  to  four  creatures  of  Small  size  may

occupy a 5-foot square (creatures one size category smaller count

as half a creature).

When  you  attack  a  Medium-size  or  larger  creature  with  a

melee attack, and at least one other ally with the Swarmfighting

feat  threatens  the  target,  you  gain  a  +1  morale  bonus  on  the

attack  roll.  This  bonus  increases  by  +1  for  each  additional  ally

beyond the first with the Swarmfighting feat who threatens the

same target. The total morale bonus imparted to your attack roll

cannot exceed your Dexterity bonus.

Talfirian Song [General]

You can use the power of your bardic music to enhance your Illu-

sion spells.

Prerequisite:  Bardic  music  class  feature,  Heighten  Spell,

Tethyrian human.

Benefit:  By  expending  uses  of  your  bardic  music,  you  can

heighten  your  illusion  spells  without  using  higher-level  spell

slots. For every daily use of your bardic music you expend during

the casting of a spell, you can increase the effective level of that

spell  by  +1.  For  example,  you  could  cast  rainbow  pattern and

expend four uses of your bardic music to make that rainbow pat-

tern effectively an 8th-level spell (increasing the save DC by +4).

You cant raise a spell above 9th level with this feat.

Tattoo Magic [Item Creation]

You can create tattoos that store spells.

Prerequisite: Craft (calligraphy) or Craft (painting) skill, spell-

caster level 3rd.

Benefit: You can create single-use magic tattoos.

You can create a tattoo of any spell of 3rd level or lower that

you know and that targets a creature or creatures. Creating a

tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a

corporeal  body.  When  you  create  a  tattoo,  you  set  the  caster

level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in ques-

tion  and  no  higher  than  your  own  level.  The  base  price  of  a

tattoo  is  its  spell  level   its  caster  level   50  gp.  To  create  a

tattoo, you must spend 1/25th of this base price in XP and use

up raw materials costing half this base price.

When  you  create  a  tattoo,  you  make  any  choices  that  you

would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the

tattoo  is  the  only  one  who  can  activate  it  and  is  always  the

target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to

touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be

empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not

draw an attack of opportunity.

Any tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material compo-

nent or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition

to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the

material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo.

Normally, a magic tattoo uses a magic item space on the crea-

tures body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of its

hands  could  not  gain  the  benefit  from  a  magic  glove  on  that

hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back does

not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle. In

effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item worn on that

part  of  the  body,  negating  the  effects  of  all  other  items.  A

tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but

the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value.

A magic tattoo can be erased with an erase spell as if it were

magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it.

When a tattoo is activated, the ink pattern or design vanishes

from the bearers skin.

Theocrat [General]

You have the delicate touch needed to maintain the favor of your

patron  deity  and  the  political  skills  needed  to  survive  in  the

trenches of bureaucratic warfare common in the lands ruled by

agents of the Mulhorandi pantheon.

Prerequisite: Patron deity from the Mulhorandi pantheon.

Regions: Mulhorand, Unther.

Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy and Knowledge

(religion) checks.

Water Adaptation [General]

You  favor  your  aquatic  elven  parent  and  have  developed  the

ability to breathe and move about in water easily.

Prerequisite: Half-aquatic elf.

Benefit: You can breathe water as well as air. You gain a swim

speed of 20 feet, which means you can move through water at

that  speed  without  making  Swim  checks.  You  gain  a  +8  racial

bonus  on  any  Swim  check.  You  can  always  take  10  on  Swim

checks even if rushed or threatened when swimming. You may

use  the  run  action  while  swimming,  provided  you  swim  in  a

straight line.

Magic Items

The peoples of Faern have developed many special magic items

to suit racial or ecological needs, and some of them have spread

to other cultures or might be found in lost treasure hoards.

Armor Special Abilities

These armor special abilities are available in addition to those in

the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

Cooling: This metal armor seems cool to the touch, no matter

what  the  environment.  The  wearer  of  such  armor  gains  fire

resistance 5. At the cost of increasing the armors cost by another

+1  property,  this  ability  can  be  upgraded  to  the  fire  resistance

ability described in the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

Caster  Level: 3rd;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, endure elements; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Warming: This  metal  armor  seems  warm  to  the  touch,  no

matter  what  the  environment.  The  wearer  of  such  armor

gains  cold  resistance  5.  At  the  cost  of  increasing  the  armors

cost  by  another  +1  property,  this  ability  can  be  upgraded  to

the cold resistance ability described in the DUNGEON MASTERS

Guide.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

endure elements; Market Price: +1 bonus.

APPENDIX

Specific Magic Armors

In  some  parts  of  Faern,  certain  kinds  of  magic  armor  are

crafted more often than others.

Calishite Mail: This +1 cooling chainmail is much sought after

along the shores of the Shining Sea, particularly in the vicinity

of the Calim Desert, where the extreme temperature effectively

prevents the wearing of most types of armor.

Caster  Level: 6th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, endure elements; Market Price: 3,840 gp; Cost to Create:

2,070 gp + 166 XP.

Hornblade: This special ability was developed by gnomes and

halflings to allow them to use larger weapons. In the hands of

a  halfling or gnome, a hornblade weapon is treated as one size

category  smaller  than  its  actual  size  for  the  purpose  of  deter-

mining  if  the  weapon  is  light,  one-handed,  two-handed,  or  too

large to use (see Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook). For exam-

ple, a Medium longsword is normally a two-handed weapon for a

Small creature, but if it were a hornblade longsword it would be

treated  as  a  Small  weapon  when  held  by  a  gnome  or  halfling,

allowing  them  to  wield  it  one-handed.  The  weapon  is

considered a normal weapon of its type for the pur-

pose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The weapon

functions  normally  for  anyone  other  than  a

Earthskin: This +1 dendritic armor is fashioned by

urdunnir  dwarves,  who  can  simply  stone  walk into

and out of the living crystal armor whenever they

dont  need  to  wear  it.  Others  must  succeed  on  a

Strength check (DC 22) to break out of the armor.

If  even  part  of  the  earthskin  survives  damage,

however, it regrows in 8 hours.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic

Arms and Armor; Market Price: 3,150 gp; Cost

to Create: 2,650 gp + 40 XP.

Roaring Armor of Ammarindar: These twelve

sets  of  +2  breastplate are  decorated  with  silver

elven runes on the front and are carved with a bear or

dragon head on the back. Any nonmagical arrow, bolt,

sling bullet, or similar missile that strikes the wearer of

the  armor  for  10  or  fewer  points  of  damage  is  auto-

matically turned back by the armor to strike at the crea-

ture  that  fired  it  (the  damage  is  re-rolled  against  the

attacker  and  the  wearer  suffers  no  damage  from  the  attack).

Because the bear or dragon head on the armor roars whenever

danger approaches from the rear, the wearer gains the uncanny

dodge ability of a 6th-level rogue (he retains his Dex bonus to AC

even  when  flat-footed  or  struck  by  an  invisible  attack,  and

cannot be flanked except by a rogue of at least 10th level). All

twelve of these breast-

plates  are  believed  to

be  in  the  hands  of  the

tanarukks  of  Hellgate  Keep,

who  plundered  them  from

Ammarindar.

Caster Level: 13th; Prerequisites:

Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,  protection

from  arrows,  true  seeing; Market  Price: 49,350  gp;

Cost to Create: 24,850 gp + 1,960 XP.

Hornblade

Weapon Special Abilities

These weapon special abilities are available in addition to those in

the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

Berserker: A  berserker  weapon  is  particularly  valuable  to

barbarians and other creatures who can enter a rage. When the

wielder  is  raging,  the  weapons  enhancement  bonus  increases

by +2.

Caster  Level: 7th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, divine power or emotion; Market Price: +1 bonus.

171

gnome or halfling.

Most  hornblades  are  short  swords  or

longswords  with  curving  blades,  although

in rare cases spears are given this special

ability.  The  first  hornblades  were

crafted  from  actual  animal  horns

or  antlers,  and  many  are  decorated

with  bits  of  horn  or  designs  that

resemble horns.

Caster  Level: 10th;  Prerequisites:

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shrink item;

Market Price: +1 bonus.

Sure  Striking:  A  sure  striking  weapon  harms

creatures with damage reduction as if it had a +5

enhancement  bonus.  Bows,  crossbows,  and  slings

cannot have the sure striking ability.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, greater magic weapon; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Specific Magic Weapons

The following special weapons are normally crafted with exactly

the qualities described here.

Axe of the Sea Reavers: This +2 greataxe of Illuskan man-

ufacture  gives  its  wielder  the  ability  to  float

atop  the  water,  no  matter  what  his

weight.  Furthermore,  the

wielder can, with the war

cry  engraved  into  the

haft,  give  all  allies  within  15  feet  a  +2

morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability

checks,  skill  checks,  and  weapon  damage  rolls  for  one

round. By saying the command word engraved on the blade itself,

the wielder can force all foes within 15 feet to make a Will save

(DC  16)  or  flee,  as  the  emotion  (fear)  spell  from  a  7th-level

caster. The war cry and the command word can each be used once

per day.

Market  Price:  13,920  gp;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms

and Armor, emotion; Cost to Create: 7,120 gp + 544 XP.

Burning  Battle  Gauntlets: Created  by  the  fiends  of  Hellgate

Keep  for  their  tanarukk  minions,  these  +1  flaming  battle

gauntlets are not actually on fire but are constantly hot to the

touch  and  deal  fire  damage  whenever  the  wearer  punches  an

opponent.  The  weapons  also  deal  their  fire  damage  when  the

APPENDIX

wearer  is  grappling  in  addition  to  any  grappling  damage.  They

are  hot  enough  to  ignite  flammable  objects  just  as  easily  as  an

open flame would. The constant heat of the gauntlets means that

anyone  wearing  them  also  suffers  1d6  fire  damage  per  round,

making them unsuitable weapons for anyone not resistant to fire

damage. Burning battle gauntlets are crafted singly; a tanarukk

with two of them is considered very wealthy and powerful.

Caster  Level: 10th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  flame  blade,  flame  strike,  or  fireball; Market  Price:

8,310 gp; Cost to Create: 4,320 gp + 320 XP.

Fiendhunter Two-Bladed Sword: This two-bladed sword has one

tip  that  crackles  with  green  sparks  and  another  limned  with  a

dull red glow. Evil outsiders worry about the green side of the

sword,  but  in  the  hands  of  a  competent  wielder  they

should fear the red end even more.

must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 19) or be impaled by the spear

(treat as an extra attack from the spear that hits automatically

but cannot score a critical hit).

Caster  Level:  12th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  divine  power;  Market  Price:  32,301  gp;  Cost  to  Create:

16,301 gp + 640 XP.

Stonereaver: This +2 greataxe has a slightly curved cleaving

blade on one side of its head and a long chisel-point pick on the

opposite side. The weapon is specifically designed for dwarves,

taking into account their size, strength, physique, and magical

ties to the stone. In the hands of a dwarf, a stonereaver gains

the  construct  bane (against  any  construct  primarily  made  of

earth, stone, or metal only) and earth elemental bane special

abilities.

The  green  side  of  the  weapon  is  a  +1  sure

striking weapon that forces any evil extraplanar

creature hit by it to succeed at a Will save (DC

16) or suffer a dismissal effect, as the spell from

an 8th-level caster. This effect functions three times

per day.

The red side of the weapon is also a +1 sure

striking weapon, but evil extraplanar creatures

hit by it are unable to engage in extradimen-

sional  travel  (as  the  dimensional  anchor  spell)

for 8 minutes. This traps fiends near the wielder of

the fiendhunter, denying them the escape route they

may need. The dimensional anchor effect also works

three times a day.

Catseye brooch

Caster  Level: 8th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic

Arms  and  Armor,  summon  monster  I,  creator

must be a dwarf; Market Price: 50,320 gp; Cost

to Create: 25,320 gp + 2,000 XP.

Trident of Serenity: A +1 trident, this item has

the additional quality of suppressing any effects or

class features within 15 feet that rely on anger

or fear, including a barbarians ability to rage,

a sahuagin blood frenzy, and a black dragons

frightful presence.

Caster  Level: 5th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic

Arms and Armor, emotion; Market Price: 5,315 gp;

Cost to Create: 2,815 gp + 200 XP.

Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

dimensional  anchor,  dismissal;  Market  Price:  32,380  gp;  Cost  to

Create: 16,540 gp + 1,267 XP.

Foesplitter Axe: Crafted by the shield dwarves of the North, a

Foesplitter axe is a +1 keen battleaxe with a steel haft (hardness

10, 25 hp).

Caster  Level:  6th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, keen edge, shield dwarf; Market Price: 7,480 gp; Cost to

Create: 3,895 gp + 287 XP.

Kerrenderit Arrow: Fashioned by the arctic dwarves, these +1

arrows are made from ice crystals from the Great Glacier. Ker-

renderit arrows have the wounding special ability (see DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide). In addition, they have a range increment 25

feet  farther  than  normal  arrows.  If  kerrenderit  arrows  are

exposed to temperatures above 50 degrees for more than 1 hour,

their icy arrowheads melt into uselessness.

Caster  Level: 12th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, chill metal, creator must have access to arctic dwarf ice

caves; Market Price: 350 gp; Cost to Create: 172 gp + 14 XP.

Scimitar of the Sirocco: Graced by a pommel shaped like the

head of a desert hawk, this elegant and graceful weapon is a +1

keen  scimitar.  It  also  doubles  the  speed  of  any  horse  or  equine

creature the bearer rides, much like horseshoes of speed.

Caster  Level:  8th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, haste, keen edge, creator must be Calishite; Market Price:

9,530 gp; Cost to Create: 4,922 gp + 367 XP.

Spear of Impaling: These +1 wounding shortspears are deadly

to elves and dwarves. If the spear hits an elf or dwarf, the target

Potions

In  addition  to  the  potion  versions  of  spells,  there  are  some

unusual variants created by some of Faerns races.

Ointment  of  Barkskin: The  wild  dwarves  of  Chult  use  this

greasy ointment. When slathered over the users skin, it protects

her with a barkskin spell.

Caster  Level: 5th;  Prerequisites: Brew  Potion,  barkskin;

Market Price: 300 gp; Weight: .

Wondrous Items

These  wondrous  items  can  be  found  in  Faern  in  addition  to

those listed in the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

Ankh of Ascension: The bearer of this magic item can cast her

divine spells at +4 caster level (with respect to range, duration,

and other numeric effects). The ankh does not grant a +4 bonus

on  checks  to  overcome  spell  resistance,  however,  nor  otherwise

increase the casters effective level.

Caster Level: 17th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, gate;

Market Price: 60,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Catseye  Brooch: Fashioned  from  silver  set  with  a  green

chrysoberyl, a catseye brooch is a good luck charm that provides

a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and a +4 resistance bonus on

saving throws versus disease.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, resist-

ance, remove disease; Market Price: 9,000 gp; Weight: .

APPENDIX

Drow House Insignia: These metal tokens are normally worn

on  a  chain  or  in  a  pouch  tied  around  the  neck.  Each  bears  a

symbol of a noble house from a particular drow city and requires

a  secret  command  word  to  activate.  An  insignia  has  a  single

minor magical ability that can be used once per day, usually a 1st,

2nd, or 3rd-level spell. Those of powerful drow often have mul-

tiple abilities of various power levels. Typical spells for a house

insignia  are  blur,  cats  grace,  cloak  of  dark  power,  comprehend

languages, feather fall, jump, levitate, read magic, scatterspray,

shield, spider climb, unseen servant, and water breathing.

Each  insignia  is  slightly  different,  even  those  of  the  same

noble house, so it is possible that a person aware of the unique

shape of a persons insignia can magically locate that person.

Caster  Level: 5th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Wondrous  Item,

appropriate spell; Market Price: 360 gp (1st-level ability), 2,160

(2nd-level ability), or 5,400 (3rd-level ability); Weight: 1 lb.

Figurine of Wondrous Power: These figurines were

crafted by some of the more creative spellcasters of

Faerns races.

Coral  Dolphin: Made  by  a  water  genasi  mage,

this  finely  carved  dolphin  of  white  coral  can

transform  into  a  living  dolphin,  except  that  it

possesses  an  Intelligence  of  8  and  the  ability  to

speak  and  understand  Common  and  Aquan.  The

dolphin  is  treated  as  a  magical  beast  when  in  its

living form. It may be used twice per tenday for up

to 4 hours each use.

breathing; Market Price: 10,000 gp; Weight: .

Blue  Quartz  Eagle: A  blue  quartz  eagle  becomes  an

eagle on command, but with vision akin to that granted by

eyes of the eagle (+5 circumstance bonus on Spot checks).

Another  command  sends  it  aloft.  It  will  not  attack,  even  to

defend  itself,  but  it  will  obey  the  telepathic  commands  of  its

owner as long as it remains within one mile of her. If forced to

move beyond that distance, a blue quartz eagle will immediately

revert to statuette form (usually shattering if it falls a great dis-

tance  to  the  ground).  While  the  figurine  is  transformed,  its

owner can mentally view everything the eagle can see, although

the owner must use a standard action to observe what the eagle

sees in that round. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only

24 hours per tenday, but the duration need not be continuous.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, ani-

mate objects, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Market Price: 5,400 gp;

Weight: .

Gogondy: This ruby wine, fermented by the deep gnomes, gives

visions to those who drink it. Anyone who consumes a glass of

Gogondy should roll on the following table:

A full bottle of Gogondy holds enough wine for six glasses.

Caster Level: 14th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, div-

ination,  contact  other  plane,  creator  must  be  a  deep  gnome;

Market Price: 3,000 gp; Weight: 5 lb.

Greater Piwafwi: These dark-colored cloaks have all the abili-

ties of a cloak of elvenkind and also provide the benefit of endure

elements  (fire),  negating  5  points  of  fire  damage  per  round.

(Lesser piwafi are simply cloaks of elvenkind.)

Monsters

The following creatures all have a connec-

tion to one or more of the races described

in this book.

Animal

The following animals can be found

in various parts of Faern.

HOUND, MASTIFF

Improved Familiar feat (see Chapter 1 of

the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Set-

ting), beginning at 3rd level. A lynx famil-

iar grants its master a +3 bonus on Move

Silently checks.

Pounce  (Ex): If  a  lynx  leaps

upon  a  foe  during  the  first

round of combat, it can make a

full attack even if it has already

taken a move action.

Cavvekans, also known as bat-faced dogs or cavedogs, are natives

of  the  Underdark,  coexisting  with  the  drow  and  other  deep-

dwelling  creatures.  If  captured  as  pups,  they  can  be  raised  as

guard animals.

Superficially  resembling  canines  of  the  surface  world,

cavvekans have tough, velvet-smooth black hides instead of fur;

large,  upright,  pointed  ears;  and  leaf-like  projections  on  their

snouts like those of bats. A cavvekans only hair is its long and

sensitive  set  of  whiskers,  which  it  uses  for  close  explorations.

Cavvekans have small, dark eyes and a slender, graceful build.

Cavvekans communicate with others of their kind with howls,

barks, and clicks, some of which are inaudible to humanoid ears.

Their sounds echo eerily down the corridors of the Underdark,

making it difficult to locate an individual by the noises it makes,

or even to be sure how many creatures are making the noises.

COMBAT

In  the  wild,  cavvekans  are  cautious  scavengers,  eating  bats,  in-

sects, lizards, rats, fish, carrion, the leavings of other predators, and

edible  fungi.  They  will  sometimes  attack  weakened  or  wounded

creatures, and occasionally a pack will gang up on a Medium-size

humanoid creature. They have intimate knowledge of each crevice,

cranny, and bolthole in their home range, so they are very diffi-

cult  to  catch.  If  trained  and  raised,  cavvekans  attack  on  com-

mand, much like a normal dog.

Blindsight  (Ex): Cavvekans  can  see  by  emitting  high-fre-

quency  sounds,  inaudible  to  most  other  creatures,  that  allow

them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence

spell  or  effect  that  causes  deafness  negates  this  and  forces  a

cavvekan to rely on its weak vision.

Cavvekan

Nearsighted  (Ex): Cavvekans  are  very  nearsighted,  and  their

vision,  low-light  vision,  and  darkvision  only  extend  to  10  feet.

This limits their Search and Spot checks to a maximum range of

10 feet if their blindsight ability is negated.

Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as

sunlight  or  a  daylight spell)  blinds  cavvekans  for  1  round.  In

addition,  they  take  a  1  penalty  on  all  attack  rolls,  saves,  and

checks while operating in bright light.

Scent: Detect opponents within 30 feet. Exact location is not

revealed, unless within 5 feet. Track by scent.

Skills: Cavedogs  receive  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Move  Silently

checks. Cavvekans receive a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks, but

this bonus is lost if their blindsight is negated. Cavvekans receive

a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

Flying snakes can be transformed into undead horrors known as

deathfangs by means of a create undead spell if the caster is of

11th level or higher. Deathfangs are often found as guardians,

utterly loyal to their creator.

A deathfang can be acquired as a familiar with the Improved

Familiar feat (see Chapter 1 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Cam-

paign Setting), beginning at 7th level if the character is of evil

alignment and has the Spell Focus (Necromancy) feat.

Deathfangs bite with their needle-sharp fangs but lack the acid

spittle of their living brethren.

Chilling  Bite  (Su): Living  creatures  bit  by  a  deathfang  bite

attack gain one negative level. The Fortitude save to remove the

negative level has a DC of 11.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the deathfang must

hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can constrict.

Constrict  (Ex): A  deathfang  deals  1d32  points  of  damage

with a successful grapple check against Tiny or smaller creatures.

Skills: Deathfangs receive a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

and Spot checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Balance checks. They

can  use  either  their  Strength  or  Dexterity  modifier  for  Climb

checks, whichever is better.

Osquips  are  hairless  multilegged  rodents  with  oversized  jaws

and teeth.

Osquips are about the size of a dog, about two feet high at the

shoulders.  They  are  hairless,  with  large  teeth  mounted  in  an

unusually  large  head.  Most  have  six  legs,  but  some  have  eight,

and a few have ten. Some have normal ratlike tails, others have

short tail stumps, and some have no tails at all. The creatures

leathery hides are pale yellow in color.

Osquips build small, carefully hidden tunnels, and their teeth

are sharp enough to dig through stone. Unlike rats, osquips are

not afraid of fire but are poor swimmers. Osquips do not collect

things for their value but sometimes keep shiny objects in their

lair.  They  can  be  acquired  as  a  familiar  by  means  of  the

Improved  Familiar  feat  (detailed  in  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting, page 35), beginning at 5th level.

COMBAT

If someone enters an area in which there are osquip tunnels, the

creatures  can  emerge  quickly  to  surprise  and  attack  the  tres-

passer. The osquips are territorial and attack fearlessly and fero-

ciously.

Flying snakes are aggressive winged serpents that are unafraid

of  most  creatures.  They  usually  attack  in  numbers  and  are

often responsible for many deaths in remote villages near their

territory.

Flying snakes, also known as flying fangs, were once numer-

ous in the warmer areas of Faern, but they are so dangerous

that all intelligent races hunt them mercilessly. Although some

are solitary, most hunt in small bands, attacking fearlessly in a

swooping, darting cloud around victims. These winged horrors

are found in ruins, subterranean areas, and rock crags through-

out Faern. They can tolerate a wide range of climates but seem

to be more numerous in Calimshan and the Shining South than

elsewhere.  Tales  abound  in  the  Black  and  Mhair  Jungles  of

lizardfolk and yuan-ti who train flying snakes to hunt for them

or learn to work the snakes as partners.

These reptiles have a pair of flaring batlike leathery wings

behind their heads. They can fly with acrobatic agility, hover-

ing, flying upside down, and using their tails and body coils

to  hamper  victims  in  midair.  Flying  snakes  may  be  of  any

color or appearance. Most have flat, pointed, viperlike heads,

red or yellow eyes, needle-sharp fangs, and emerald green or

bronze scales.

Flying snakes can be acquired as familiars with the Improved

Familiar feat (described in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting, page 35). A flying snake familiar grants its master a +2

bonus on saving throws against acid.

Osquip

COMBAT

Flying snakes bite with their needle-sharp fangs or spit globs

of acid at foes. They will attack any living thing they can slay

and eat.

Acid Spit (Ex): Once per round, a flying fang can spit acid as

a  ranged  touch  attack.  The  acid  spit  deals  1  hit  point  of  acid

damage but is insufficient to count as a grenadelike weapon. A

flying fang that bites an opponent automatically deals an addi-

tional 1 point of damage from acid.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the flying snake must

hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can constrict.

Constrict (Ex): A flying snake deals 1d32 points of damage

with a successful grapple check against Tiny or smaller creatures.

Skills: Flying snakes receive a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

and Spot checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Balance checks. They

can use either their Strength or Dexterity modifier for Climb

checks, whichever is better.

Created  through  centuries  of  eldritch  cross-breeding,  steeders

strongly resemble monstrous spiders, but they are hardly mind-

less vermin.

The gray dwarves originally created steeders from the mon-

strous hunting spiders of the Underdark to serve as steedsa

function they perform admirably. They climb well enough to

bypass many underground obstacles, and their keen senses help

the  steeders  warn  their  riders  of  approaching  foes.  They  are,

however, strictly riding beasts; they refuse to pull wagons or oth-

erwise act as dray creatures.

Physically, steeders still resemble the monstrous spiders they

evolved from. Their eight legs are covered with a thick layer of

dark  gray  chitin,  and  thick  black  hairs  jut  from  every  joint.

Their carapace has small loops in various places, which a duer-

gar rider uses to anchor a saddle and bridle. Their eight eyes glow

a dull red when steeders exert themselves.

COMBAT

In a fight, steeders like to surprise their opponents and charge,

injecting poison into big foes and bull-rushing smaller enemies

against  walls  or  off  cliffs.  They  are  equally  at  home  on  a

caverns floor, walls, or ceiling, so they can confound their oppo-

nents by climbing to a good tactical position.

Steeders often fight with gray dwarves on their backs. Both

the gray dwarf rider and the steeder can turn themselves invis-

ible, so they often attack from surprise.

Invisibility  (Su):  Once  per  day,  the  steeder  can  make  itself

invisible, as the invisibility spell from a 12th-level caster.

Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 16); initial and second-

ary damage 1d6 temporary Strength.

Scent: Detect opponents within 30 feet. Exact location is not

revealed, unless within 5 feet.

Skills: Steeders receive a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move

Silently checks and a +8 racial bonus on Spot checks.

TRAINING A STEEDER

Training  a  steeder  to  serve  as  a  mount  requires  a  successful

Handle Animal check (DC 24 for a young creature, or DC 29

for an adult). A steeder matures in six months.

Steeder eggs are worth 500 gp apiece among the gray dwarves,

who have only recently begun selling them to other races. Pro-

fessional  duergar  trainers  charge  1,000  gp  to  rear  or  train  a

steeder.  Riding  a  trained  steeder  requires  an  exotic  saddle.  A

steeder can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also

attack unless he or she succeeds at a Ride check (see the descrip-

tion of the Ride skill in the Players Handbook).

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a steeder is 300 pounds; a

medium  load,  301600  pounds;  and  a  heavy  load,  601900

pounds.

Prestige Classes

These prestige classes are available to any character in Faern

who meets all the requirements.

Battlerager

Dwarven battleragers, or kuldjargh (axe idiots), are legendary

berserker warriors who can enter a battle frenzy through ritu-

alistic singing. They are believed to have been touched by the

dwarven  gods  of  battle,  who  taught  them  that  if  they  die  in

battle, they will return to Faern stronger than before as a just

reward. Therefore, they have no fear of death. They are given

to drinking, rowdy and boisterous singing, and drunken dancing.

Battleragers command grudging, if fearful, respect within dwar-

ven society, where they are known to have coined such philo-

sophically complex dwarven maxims like head first and if it

moves, kill it. Most live short, glorious lives.

While  enraged,  a  battleragers  face  becomes  distorted  and

twisted. His teeth grind together as spittle flies from his mouth

and dribbles down his beard. His eyes enlarge, bulge, and become

bloodshot. Charging into battle, he bellows forth his clan or holy

war  song,  throwing  his  hammers  and  axes  all  the  way,  before

cleaving his foes with his mighty dwarven waraxe. In short, he

becomes  almost  unstoppable.  Battleragers  are  often  covered

from head to toe in body art, from tattoos to brands to ritual

scars. They prefer to wear spiked armor, and some of them ride

specially trained boars into battle.

Battleragers are usually single classed barbarians before taking

the prestige class, though multiclass barbarian/fighters are also

common.  Barbarians/rangers  and  barbarian/clerics  (known  as

vindicators) are not uncommon as well. Other multiclass com-

binations are almost unheard of.

The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarf society and

culture. He is a fearless and impulsive warrior, able to enter into

an  insane  rampage.  Battleragers  are  ruthlessly  used  by  dwarf

generals  for  their  shock  power  against  attacking  armies.  NPC

battleragers often come from a familial clan made up predom-

inantly of battleragers. These clans often form guilds or halls

within  dwarven  society,  though  these  guilds  are  often  more

akin to a family or fraternal order. Regardless, battlerager guilds

are often located on the fringes of dwarven society, kept out of

view  and  away  from  easily  influenced  dwarven  children,  who

often hear of the kuldjarghs fearlessness but rarely their folly.

While  heroic  battle  is  honored  in  dwarven  society  and  battle-

ragers often excel in this, more often than not they also epito-

mize lives wasted in stupid rage, something most dwarves realize

they cannot afford in a world filled with orcs and goblins.

CLASS SKILLS

The  battleragers  class  skills  (and  the  key

ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft

(Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Intimidate

(Cha),  Jump  (Str),  Knowledge  (religion)

(Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Perform  (Cha),  Ride

(Dex), Tumble (Dex), and Survival (Wis).

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level: 2  +  Int

modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  fea-

tures  of  the  battlerager  prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:

Battleragers  gain  no  proficiency  with

any weapons, armor, or shields.

Rage  (Ex): At  1st,  3rd,  and  5th  level,

the  battlerager  gains  another  use  of  bar-

barian  rage  per  day.  If  the  battlerager  has

the  ability  to  enter  a  greater  rage,  the  extra  rages

granted by this ability are greater rages as well.

Gruff  (Ex): Battleragers  are  known

to  be  rude,  uncouth,  and  violent.  They

suffer a 4 penalty on all Charisma ability

checks and Charisma-based skill checks, except

for Intimidate checks. Battleragers receive a +2

bonus on all Intimidate checks.

Rock Gut (Ex): A battleragers natural resist-

Improved  Unarmed  Strike  (Ex): At  3rd  level,  a  battlerager

gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.

Great Cleave: At 4th level, a battlerager gains the Great Cleave

feat.

Reckless Offensive: At 4th level, a battlerager gains the Reck-

less Offensive feat.

Natural  Armor  (Ex): By  5th  level,  a  battleragers  flesh  has

become so scarred and corded with muscle that he gains +2 natu-

ral armor.

Bladesinger

Bladesingers  are  elves  who  have  blended

art, swordplay, and arcane magic into a

harmonious  whole.  In  battle,  a  blade-

singers  lithe  movements  and  subtle

tactics  seem  beautiful,  belying  their

deadly  martial  efficiency.  Bladesingers

have a treasured place in elf society, balanc-

ing the joys of art and magic with the skill

of  masterful  fighting,  and  so  blade-

singers  are  well-respected  by  other

elves. They usually serve as itinerant

guardians  and  champions  of  the  elf

community  at  large  rather  than  tying

themselves  to  one  particular  settle-

ment.

Multiclass fighter/wizards can

become bladesingers most easily,

though  any  elf  who  can  wield  a

martial  weapon  and  cast  arcane

spells  can  become  a  bladesinger.

Bladesinging  ranger/wizards,  rogue/

wizards,  and  bladesinger  bards  are

not unknown.

Most bladesingers work alone, suf-

ficient  unto  themselves,  but  in  larger

communities they sometimes have the

opportunity  to  fight  together  in  the

same  combat.  Bladesingers  are  nor-

mally trained singly by another bladesinger,

and the concept of anything as formalized as a

bladesinger school is an absurd notion to them.

Hit Die: d8

a +4 racial bonus.

Close-Quarter Fighting (Ex): At 2nd level, a battlerager gains

the Close-Quarter Fighting feat.

Fearless (Ex): At 2nd level, a battlerager becomes immune to

fear and similar effects. He also gains a +2 insight bonus on saves

against all mind-affecting spells and effects.

Feats: Combat Casting, Dodge, Expertise, Still Spell, Weapon

CLASS SKILLS

The bladesingers class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Balance (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Jump (Str),

Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Perform  (Cha),  Spellcraft  (Int),  and

Tumble (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  blade-

singer.

Weapon  and  Armor  Profi-

ciency: The  bladesinger  gains

no weapon proficiency but does

gain  proficiency  with  light

armor. If the bladesinger wears

medium  or  heavy  armor,  she

loses  all  benefits  of  any

of her song abilities (lesser

bladesong,  lesser  spellsong,

song of celerity, greater spell-

song, and song of fury).

A bladesinger suffers the normal arcane spell failure

chance when casting spells while armored (except as noted

below).

Bladesong (Ex): When wielding a longsword or rapier in

one hand (and nothing in the other), the bladesinger gains

a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Intelligence bonus.

Bonus  Feats: At  2nd,  5th,  and  8th  level,  the  blade-

singer gets a bonus feat. These feats must be drawn from

the following list: any metamagic feat, Combat Reflexes,

Improved Critical (longsword), Improved Disarm, Mobil-

ity, Quick Draw, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack.

Lesser  Spellsong  (Ex): Starting  at  3rd  level,

when wielding a longsword or rapier in one hand

(and nothing in the other), the bladesinger can take

10  when  making  a  Concentration  check  to  cast

defensively.

Bladesinger

Song of Celerity (Su): Starting at 6th level, when wielding a

longsword or rapier in one hand (and nothing in the other) and

using the full attack action, the bladesinger can cast one blade-

singer spell (or arcane spell with a casting time of 1 action or

less) each round as a free action.

Greater Spellsong (Ex): Starting at 7th level, the bladesinger

ignores arcane spell failure when wearing light armor.

Song of Fury (Ex): At 10th level, when wielding a longsword

or rapier in one hand (and nothing in the other) and using the

full  attack  action,  the  bladesinger  can  make  one  extra

attack in a round at her highest base attack, but this

attack and each other attack made that round take a

2  penalty.  This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it

affects  attacks  of  opportunity  the  bladesinger  might

make before her next action.

Spells per Day: Every level a bladesinger gains,

the  character  gains  new  spells  per  day  as

shown.  When  she  casts  bladesinger  spells,

the bladesingers caster level is equal to her

bladesinger  level.  A  bladesingers  bonus

spells are based on Intelligence. The Diffi-

culty  Class  for  saving  throws  against

bladesinger spells is 10 + the spells level +

the bladesingers Intelligence modifier.

A  bladesinger  keeps  a  spellbook  and

must  prepare  spells  each  day  as  a  wizard

does.  She  can  have  any  number  of  blade-

singer spells in her spellbook (see Writing a

New Spell into a Spellbook, Chapter 10 in the

Players Handbook). At levels 1st through 9th,

a bladesinger gains two spells she can add to her

spellbook for free. These spells must be blade-

singer spells the character can cast.

BLADESINGER SPELL LIST

Bladesingers  choose  their  spells  from  the

Breachgnome

A  breachgnome  is  a  mighty  gnome  who  is  skilled  in  fighting  in

cramped conditions. A high-level breachgnome in the right position

can hold off a superior force for as long as his strength holds out.

Such gnomes are trained to fight alone, and they excel at doing so.

Most breachgnomes are fighters, rangers, paladins, or barbar-

ianscombatants who are well-suited to the demands of the posi-

tion  and  can  benefit  most  from  the  capabilities  of  the  class.

Rogues  and  bards  sometimes  take  this  class,  but  both  they  and

sorcerers,  wizards,  and  druids  are  normally  better  off  avoiding

hand-to-hand combat, so it is rare.

NPC  breachgnomes  sometimes  work  in  small  units,

prepared to block off a number of different passages

so  that  their  fellows  can  either  get  into  a  better

position  or  even  escape.  They  are  almost  exclu-

sively found in gnome villages or towns. A PC

breachgnome  can  sometimes  be  found  wan-

dering along, searching for fellow gnomes in

need of his unique skills.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  breachgnome,  a

character must fulfill all the following cri-

teria.

Race: Gnome.

Alignment: Any nonchaotic.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Listen 5 ranks, Spot 5 ranks.

Feats: Combat  Reflexes,  Dodge,

Improved Initiative.

CLASS SKILLS

The  breachgnomes  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Bluff  (Cha),  Climb  (Str),  Concentration  (Con),  Craft

(Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Hide  (Dex),  Jump  (Str),  Listen

(Wis), Spot (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Seal  the  Breach  (Ex): Starting  at  1st  level,  when  a  breach-

gnome  can  fight  in  a  position  where  he  is  adjacent  to  a  solid

object of at least Medium size (such as a tree, wall, or pillar), he

gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC. If two such objects are on oppo-

site sides of the breachgnome (similar to two creatures in flank-

ing positions), this bonus increases to a total of +4.

Beginning  at  3rd  level,  the  breachgnome  becomes  especially

good at thwarting attempts to enter his area, pass his threatened

area,  or  move  him  from  his  position.  He  gains  a  +4  bonus  on

attacks of opportunity made in response to a creature entering

his square (including a bull rush), a +4 bonus to resist a bull rush

(as if the breachgnome were exceptionally stable), and a +4 bonus

to avoid a trip attack made as part of an overrun action

or  to  trip  someone  in  response  to  a  trip  attempt

made as part of an overrun.

Upon reaching 5th level, the breachgnome

gains a +4 bonus on attacks of opportunity

made  against  creatures  moving  within

or  through  his  threatened  area,  and

Tumble checks made to pass through

his square or a threatened area add

+10 to their DC.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Starting

at  2nd  level,  the  breachgnome

gains  the  ability  to  react  to

danger  before  his  senses  would

normally  allow  him  to  even  be

aware of it. He retains his Dex-

terity  bonus  to  AC  (if  any)

regardless of being caught flat-

footed or struck by an invisible

attacker (he still loses his Dex-

terity bonus to AC if immobi-

lized).

Upon  reaching  5th  level,

the  breachgnome  can  no

longer  be  flanked;  he  can

react  to  opponents  on  op-

posite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker.

This  defense  denies  rogues  the  ability  to  use  flank  attacks  to

sneak attack him. The exception to this defense is that a rogue

of at least four levels higher than the character can flank him

(and thus sneak attack him).

If the breachgnome has another class that grants the uncanny

dodge ability, add together all the class levels of the classes that

grant  the  ability  and  determine  the  characters  uncanny  dodge

ability on that basis.

Bonus  Feats:  At  2nd  and  4th  level,  the  breachgnome  gets  a

bonus feat. These bonus feats must be drawn from the following

list:  Ambidexterity,  Blind-Fight,  Expertise,  Improved  Critical*,

Improved  Disarm,  Improved  Trip,  Improved  Two  Weapon

Special

Seal the breach (AC bonus)

Fighting,  Two  Weapon  Fighting,  Weapon  Finesse*,  Weapon

Focus*, and Whirlwind Attack.

Some of the bonus feats available to a breachgnome cannot be

acquired until the breachgnome has gained one or more prereq-

uisite  feats.  A  breachgnome  can  select  feats  marked  with  an

asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different weapon

each time. A breachgnome must still meet all prerequisites for a

feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.

Elven High Mage

Elves study magic with a matchless passion. But even among the

elves,  the  high  mages  are  regarded  as

obsessed  with  the  accumulation  of

arcane power.

Elven high mages are the masters

of  creating  their  own  epic  spells

mythals  that  can  grow  to  engulf

entire  cities.  Learning  the  secrets

of epic magic is the culmination of

any arcanists career, and the elves

are  very  selective  about  who  can

learn  such  potent  lore.  Existing

high  mages  often  observe  high

mage  candidates  for  a  decade  or

more, probing for the faintest hint

of  unworthiness.  So  far,  their

extreme secrecy has worked. Less

than  a  dozen  elves  even  know

where the lore of elven high magic is

even  kept,  much  less  how  to  actually

cast an epic spell.

All elven high mages are sun elves,

moon  elves,  or  wood  elves,  and  all

are  powerful  wizards  or  sorcerers.

No  one  else  can  learn  the  elves

greatest magical secrets.

NPC  high  mages  spend  their

time  developing  new  epic  spells,

organizing searches for lost elven

lore, or taking steps to ensure that

elven  secrets  stay  secret.  PC  high

mages  will  find  that  being  a  high

mage  is  a  full-time  job,  making

adventuring  a  challenge.  But  due  to

their considerable personal power, elven high mages often wind up

on the front lines of the defense of the elven people.

The  elven  high  mage  prestige  class  makes  use  of  material

found in Epic Level Handbook, since any elven high mage is by

definition an epic-level character.

Hit Die: d4.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: Start-

ing at 1st level and every other elven

high  mage  level  thereafter  (1st,  3rd,

5th,  7th,  and  9th),  the  character  gains

new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained

a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding

the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the charac-

ter gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that

epic class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit that a

character of that class would have gained (improved chance of

turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats,

and so on). If the character had more than one spellcasting class

before becoming an elven high mage, the player must decide to

which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining

spells per day.

Seed  Affinity  (Ex):  The  elven  high  mages  studies  have  pro-

vided insight into the finer points of epic spell creation. When-

ever this class feature is attained (at 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th levels),

the elven high mage chooses an epic spell seed from the list in

Chapter 2 of the Epic Level Handbook. The base Spellcraft DC

for  epic  spells  created  with  this  seed  is  two  lower,  so  the  elven

high mage can achieve powerful epic spells at lower levels. For

182

example, an elven mage who chooses the banish seed (normally

DC  27)  will  gain  quicker  access  to  all  epic  spells  that  use  the

banish seed, because the base Spellcraft DC will be 25, not 27, and

the elven mage will be able to achieve a given effect two levels

earlier than other epic spellcasters.

Mythal  Invention  (Ex):  Whenever  the  elven  high  mage

attains this  class feature (at 2nd, 4th, 7th, and  9th  levels), she

may develop a single epic spell for 75% of the normal develop-

ment  cost  in  gold,  time,  and  experience  points.  The  elven  high

mage doesnt have to develop an epic spell right away, but if she

attains this class feature again before she develops an epic spell,

the previous benefit is lost. For example, an elven high mage who

attains a mythal invention at 2nd level must use it before 4th

level, when the next mythal invention is available.

Bonus Feat (Ex): The elven high mage gains a

bonus  feat  at  5th  level  and  an  additional  bonus

feat  every  five  levels  thereafter.  These  bonus

feats  must  be  selected  from  the  following  list:

Augmented Alchemy, Automatic Quicken Spell,

Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell,

Combat Casting, Craft Epic Magic Arms and

Armor,  Craft  Epic  Rod,  Craft  Epic  Staff,

Craft  Epic  Wondrous  Item,  Efficient

Great Rift Skyguard

The  hippogriff-mounted  skyguards  of  the

Great Rift patrol the skies, ever watchful for

the  enemies  of  the  gold  dwarves.  Unlike  other

mounted  soldiers,  skyguards  often  leave  their  saddles,  shouting

Axes from the sky! as they drop onto their foes.

Hit Die: d10.

Appendix

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Great Rift skyguard, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Race: Gold dwarf.

Skills: Handle Animal 4 ranks, Jump 4 ranks, Ride 8 ranks.

Feats: Mounted Combat, Toughness.

CLASS SKILLS

The Great Rift skyguards class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Climb  (Str),  Craft  (Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal

(Wis),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Jump  (Str),  Profession  (Wis),  Ride

(Dex), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the

Great Rift skyguard prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Profi-

ciency: The Great Rift skyguard is

proficient  with  martial  weapons,

medium and light armor, and shields.

Axes from the Sky: The Great Rift

skyguard is particularly adept at using

a  drogue  wing  (see  the  Equipment

section of this appendix) to attack his

foes from above. As a standard action,

the skyguard can leap from his saddle,

fall  straight  downward,  and  deploy  his

drogue  wing  just  before  attacking.

This  counts  as  a  charge  attack  that

deals  double  damage  and  grants  an

additional  +1  bonus  on  the  attack

roll  because  the  skyguard  is

attacking  from  higher  ground.

The  skyguard  takes  no  damage  from

the fall, and after the attack is scattered ran-

domly into a square adjacent to the creature he

attacked.

Great Rift skyguard

Hippogriff Steed I (Su): At 2nd level, the bond

between the Great Rift skyguard and his mount improves. The

hippogriff now has 5 Hit Dice, its natural armor bonus improves

to +6, its Strength score improves to 19, and its Intelligence score

improves to 6.

APPENDIX

The  skyguard  also  develops  a  telepathic  link  with  the  hip-

pogriff out to a distance of one mile. The skyguard cannot see

through the mounts eyes, but they can communicate telepath-

ically. Because of the telepathic link, the skyguard has the same

connection to an item or place that the hippogriff does, just as

a master and his familiar.

The skyguard can have only one hippogriff steed at a time. If

the hippogriff dies, the skyguard must train a new hippogriff for

a month before he can confer the bonuses to it.

Skyhook: At 2nd level, the Great Rift skyguard and his steed

have mastered a resaddling maneuver. If the skyguard is on the

ground, he can raise his shield above his head as a free action.

The hippogriff then swoops down and grabs the shield (and con-

sequently the skyguard) in the middle of its move, as if it had

the Flyby Attack feat. Then it corkscrews as it climbs, so the

skyguard winds up back in the saddle. The skyguard doesnt pro-

voke  attacks  of  opportunity  for  this  maneuver,  but  the  hip-

pogriff might.

Bonus Mounted Combat Feat: At 3rd and 7th level, the Great

Rift  skyguard  gains  a  feat  of  his  choice  with  the  Mounted

Combat feat as a prerequisite.

Fly-By Attack: At 4th level or higher, a Great Rift skyguard

who  swoops  down  onto  his  foes  with  a  drogue  wing  can  leap

from  the  saddle,  make  a  single  attack,  then  fly  up  to  50  feet

away (at an altitude of 5 feet above the ground) before landing.

This does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the sky-

guards target.

Hippogriff  Steed  II  (Su):  At  5th  level,  the  Great  Rift  sky-

guards hippogriff now has 7 Hit Dice, its natural armor bonus

improves to +8, its Strength score improves to 20, and its Intel-

ligence score improves to 7. It is considered a magical beast, and

it remains Large despite its 7 HD. Its fly speed improves to 110

feet (good).

Drogue  Charge:  At  6th  level  and  higher,  a  Great  Rift  sky-

guard on the ground with an undeployed drogue wing can run at

his foes, then deploy the wing to send him into the air briefly,

up and over his target. This functions as a normal charge attack,

except that the skyguard gains the +1 attack bonus for higher

ground,  and  he  lands  on  the  far  side  of  his  foe.  The  drogue

charge  doesnt  provoke  an  attack  of  opportunity  from  the

target, even if the creature has reach.

Hippogriff Steed III (Su): At 8th level, the Great Rift sky-

guards hippogriff now has 9 Hit Dice, its natural armor bonus

improves to +10, its Strength score improves to 21, and its Intel-

ligence score improves to 8. It is still a Large magical beast, and

it gains spell resistance 20 and damage reduction 5/+2.

Glide for Distance: At 9th level and higher, the Great Rift

skyguard is attuned to even the slightest breeze, and he knows

how to get maximum performance from his drogue wing. Once

he  has  deployed  the  drogue  wing,  a  Great  Rift  skyguard  can

travel up to 15 feet horizontally for every 5 feet he falls. He is

considered to have good maneuverability while flying, although

he cant climb. He can dive as steeply as he wishes, however.

Skyguard Catapult: A dangerous stunt attempted only by the

best  skyguards  (10th  level),  the  skyguard  catapult  turns  the

Great Rift skyguard into a living catapult stone. As a full-round

action, hippogriff and skyguard swoop toward their target. At

the end of the hippogriffs movement, the skyguard leaps from

the saddle, falling any vertical distance and traveling up to 50

feet in a straight line horizontally.

Unlike axes from the sky, the drogue wing is not deployed.

Instead, the skyguard deals damage to the target as if he were a

falling object (see Table 318: Damage from Falling Objects in

the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide)  and  takes  half-damage  from

the fall himself. The skyguard must succeed on a melee touch

attack roll to strike his target; if he misses, he inflicts no damage

on the target and falls prone in an adjacent square.

Orc Warlord

The  orc  warlord  is  a  savage  general  of  an  unruly  army,  the

leader of one of the deadly and all too common orc hordes that

rampage down from the Spine of the World to savage and bru-

talize the civilized lands of Faern. An orc warlord is an impos-

ing figure, often slathered with scars both ritualistic and all too

real in origin.

Barbarians  and  fighter/barbarians  are  the  best  suited  to

become orc warlords, as they already excel in battle and often

attract large armies on their own. Barbarian/clerics sometimes

become orc warlords to better lead their followers into religious

wars. Orc barbarian/rangers and barbarian/rogues usually oper-

ate alone, although it is not unknown for one of these to become

a  warlord  in  desperate  times.  Perhaps  the  most  potent  of  orc

warlords, though, is the barbarian/bard; his natural abilities to

handle large groups and inspire greatness stack quite well with

the abilities granted by this prestige class.

An NPC orc warlord is usually encountered on the field of

battle, commanding his horde of orcs. Between attacks, an orc

warlord can be found back in his lair training his troops for the

next attack, be it in a month or a decade or even farther into

the future.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an orc warlord, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Race: Orc or half-orc.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills: Intimidate 8 ranks, Ride 5 ranks, Survival 5 ranks.

CLASS SKILLS

The orc warlords class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen

(Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Survival

(5 ranks).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Final Rage (Ex): At 5th level, the warlord gains the ability to

incite  a  rage  in  all  his  nearby  allies  for  one  last  phenomenal

attack. Any allies within ten feet of the warlord (including the

warlord himself) immediately enter a rage, even if they could not

normally do so or have used all their own rage ability for the day.

If the warlord or an ally is already in a rage at the time or is

capable of a greater rage, the affected creatures enter a greater

rage instead (if an affected creature is already in a greater rage,

this  ability  has  no  additional  effect).  This  rage  (or  increase  to

greater rage) lasts until the warlords next turn, and all penalties

for leaving a rage apply (for example, the creatures are fatigued,

and  if  already  fatigued  they  become  exhausted).  Invoking  the

final rage is a free action.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the orc war-

lord prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Profi-

ciency: Orc  warlords  gain  no

proficiency  with  any  weapons,

armor, or shields.

Gather  Horde  (Ex): An  orc

warlord  can  maintain  a  larger

force  of  orc  followers  than  a

comparable  leader  could  of

other  creatures.  When  deter-

mining  the  number  of  follow-

ers  allowed  for  a  warlord,

multiply  the  amount  listed  in

Table  225:  Leadership  in  the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide by

the  listed  value.  These  addi-

tional forces must be orcs. For

example,  a  character  with  a

leadership  score  of  15  could

normally  have  up  to  twenty

1st-level,  two  2nd-level,  and

one  3rd-level  followers.  A  1st-

level  orc  warlord  could  have

thirty 1st-level, three 2nd-level,

and  one  3rd-level  follower,  as

long  as  at  least  ten  of  the  1st-

level  and  one  of  the  2nd-level

followers  were  orcs.  A  3rd-level

orc warlord could have forty 1st-level, four 2nd-level, and two

3rd-level followers, so long as half of them were orcs.

Inspire Courage (Su): At 2nd level, the orc warlord gains the

ability to inspire courage, which has the same effect as the bardic

ability of the same name. The warlord makes an inspirational

speech,  bolstering  his  allies  against  fear  and  improving  their

combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must hear the warlord

speak for a full round. The effect lasts as long as the warlord

speaks and for 5 rounds after the warlord stops speaking (or 5

rounds  after  the  ally  can  no  longer  hear  the  warlord).  While

speaking, the warlord can fight but cannot cast spells, activate

magic  items  by  spell  completion  (such  as  scrolls),  or  activate

magic  items  by  command  word.  Affected  allies  receive  a  +2

morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects

and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. A

warlord in the midst of a rage can use this ability, but in those

cases the warlords speech is more of a rant of howls and curses

than a true speech.

Spellsinger

Spellsingers  (not  to  be  confused

with  spelldancers,  detailed  in

Magic of Faern), are rare practi-

tioners of an ancient elven bardic

tradition.  Like  bards,  spellsingers

work magic with song and poetics,

but,  whereas  bards  draw  on  the

Weave  through  singing  and

poetry, spellsingers are truly part

of  the  Weave.  As  such,  spell-

singers  can  work  magic  through

music  with  greater  effect  and

flexibility than other bards.

Orc warlord

Most spellsingers are bards or

wizard/bards,  particularly  en-

chanter/bards,  although  sor-

cerer/bards  and  cleric/bards  (the

latter known as circle dancers) are

not  unknown.  Characters  of  other

classes  almost  never  become  spell-

singers. Likewise, most spellsingers

are  elves,  or,  more  rarely,  half-

elves. At least one human with a

trace  of  elven  heritage,  Danilo

Thann,  is  known  to  have  mas-

tered the art as well.

NPC  spellsingers  are  usually

found  in  traditional  elven  home-

lands where they play a role not unlike bards in other cultures.

They garner a great deal of respect among elves and half-elves

raised among the Fair Folk, but their unique talents and abilities

are little understood outside the ranks of the Tel-quessir.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  spellsinger,  a  character  must  fulfill  all

the following criteria.

Race: Spellsingers  must  have  at  least  some  small  amount  of

elven heritage, defined as at least one-eighth elven blood.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, Perform (any hand instru-

ment, singing, and others) 8 ranks.

Feats: Improved Counterspell, Skill Focus (Perform).

Spellcasting: Ability  to  cast  1st-level  arcane  spells  without

preparation.

CLASS SKILLS

The spellsingers class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff  (Cha),  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Decipher  Script

(Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Disguise  (Cha),  Gather  Information

(Cha), Knowledge (any) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis),

Speak Language (None), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device

(Cha).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the spell-

singer prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Spellsingers

gain no proficiency in any weapons or armor.

Bardic Music: Spellsingers continue

to increase their skill in creating mag-

ical effects thorough song and poetics.

A characters spellsinger levels and bard

levels (or levels in another class with the

same  ability)  stack  for  the  purpose  of

using bardic music.

Compelling Song (Su): Spellsingers have

an  intrinsic  understanding  of  the  links

between  magic  and  music.  They  add  their

class level to all Perform checks when using

their  bardic  music  ability.  Likewise,  they  add  their

class level to the DCs of their bardic music fascinate

and suggestion abilities.

Spellsong: Spellsingers  can  lose  a  prepared

arcane spell in order to cast any arcane enchant-

ment spell of one or more levels lower that is on their

spell list. This works just as a clerics spontaneous cast-

ing class feature. Arcane spells that do not need to be

prepared can also be lost in this fashion, although

spellsong simply grants the ability to replace a spell

slot  with  a  lower-level  arcane  enchantment  spell

from the characters spell list.

All  spellsongs  require  verbal  (singing)  and

somatic  (playing  an  instrument)  components,

regardless of whether the spell was prepared or not.

These components replace the spells normal verbal,

somatic,  material,  and  focus  components,  but  not

any  experience  point  costs  or  expensive  material

components.

Spellsinger

The  saving  throw  DC  for  spellsongs  is  equal  to  the  casters

Cha  modifier  +  the  enchantments  level  +2,  regardless  of

whether the spell was originally prepared or not.

Improved  Countersong  (Su): At  3rd  level  and  above,  spell-

singer are particularly adept at using their countersong ability

to disrupt spells, gaining a +10 bonus on Perform checks when

attempting to countersong.

Amplified Music (Su): At 5th level, spellsingers become par-

ticularly  adept  at  producing  magical  effects  on  those  around

them.  They  increase  the  range  of  most  bardic  music  effects

(countersong, fascinate, inspire courage, and inspire greatness)

by a number of feet equal to five times their class level. This

increase is tripled for the bardic music fascinate ability.

Spells  per  Day: When  a

new spellsinger level is gained,

the  character  gains  new  spells

per day as if he had also gained a

level in whatever arcane spellcast-

ing  class  he  belonged  to  before  he

added the prestige class. He does not,

however, gain any other benefit a char-

acter  of  that  class  would  have  gained.

This  essentially  means  that  he

adds the level of spellsinger to the

level of whatever other arcane spell-

casting  class  the  character  has,  then

determines  spells  per  day  and  caster

level accordingly.

If  a  character  had  more  than  one

arcane spellcasting class before he became

a  spellsinger,  he  must  decide  to  which  class  he

adds each level of spellsinger for the purpose of

determining spells per day.

Warrior Skald

Among  the  Northlanders  dwell  bardic

musicians who live for two things: poetry

and  warfare.  Accompanying  heroes  of

great renown, these warrior skalds fight at

their sides while composing the epics that

will be told for centuries to come.

Most  warrior  skalds  were  once  bards,

though  they  eventually  ignore  their  spell-

casting to improve their fighting prowess.

They focus on oratory rather than music,

and  their  greatest  creative  achievement  is

to  compose  an  epic  poem  about  a  military

campaign or other adventure. Warrior skalds will often recite

parts of an epic in the middle of combat to spur on their allies

and  frighten  their  foes.  Many  soldiers  find  it  unnerving  to

battle  a  warrior  skald  who  recites  poetry  in  stentorian  tones,

working the events of the ongoing battle into each stanza.

CLASS SKILLS

The warrior skalds class skills (and the key

ability  for  each  skill)  are  Bluff  (Cha),  Climb  (Str),

Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),

Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Hide  (Dex),  Jump  (Str),  Listen

(Wis),  Move  Silently  (Dex),  Perform  (Cha),  Profes-

sion  (Wis),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  Speak  Lan-

guage (Int), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int mod-

ifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class fea-

tures  of  the  warrior  skald  prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The

warrior skald is proficient with martial weap-

ons, armor, and shields.

Bardic Music: At 1st level, the

warrior  skald  gains  the  bardic

music ability if she did not already

have  it  from  a  previous  class.  All  the

bardic music effects (countersong, fasci-

nate,  inspire  competence,  inspire  courage,

inspire  greatness,  and  suggestion)  become

available to her immediately, subject to their usual Perform skill

requirements (see Bard in the Players Handbook). Additionally,

all the bardic music effects, including countersong, can be pro-

duced with poetry rather than music. Each bardic music effect

except suggestion requires one daily use of the bardic music abil-

ity. Suggestion does not require any uses, but the subject must

first  be  fascinated. The  warrior  skald  combines  her  bard  and

warrior skald levels to determine how many times per day she

can use her bardic music ability.

Words  of  Rejuvenation  (Su):  A  2nd-level  warrior  skald  can

inspire  her  allies  so  they  shake  off  the  effects  of  fatigue.

Fatigued  characters  who  hear  the  warrior  skald  speak  for  a

minute are no longer fatigued, and exhausted characters are only

fatigued.  The  warrior  skald  can  use  this  ability  only  once  per

hour. It is a language-dependent ability that counts as one daily

use of bardic music.

Demoralize: At 3rd level, the warrior skalds poetry hurts

enemy morale. Once theyve heard the warrior skalds epic

oratory  for  a  full  round,  opponents  within  20  feet  must

succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + warrior skald levels + Cha

bonus)  or  be  shaken  (2  morale  penalty  on  attacks,

damage, and saves) as long as the warrior skald contin-

ues to recite and for 5 rounds thereafter. This is a mind-

affecting, language-dependent ability that counts as

one daily use of bardic music.

Marchers Chant: At 5th level, the warrior skald

gains  the  ability  to  encourage  those

engaged  in  dull,  repetitive  action,

such  as  marching  or  rowing.

When  traveling  overland  or  en-

gaged in a similar long-term physi-

cal  effort,  those  who  hear  the  warrior  skalds

exhortations  find  they  can  exert  themselves  for

longer. Those within earshot of the warrior skald

can  march  or  exert  themselves  50%  longer

before making Constitution checks (see

Forced  March  in  Chapter  9  of  the

Players  Handbook). The  warrior  skald

need  not  chant  nonstop  throughout  the

entire  march  but  must  be  chanting  at  least

half the time.

Inspire Heroism: As an additional use

of bardic music, a 6th-level warrior skald

with  15  or  more  ranks  in  Perform

can use poetics to inspire tremen-

dous heroism in a single willing ally within

30 feet, allowing that creature to fight bravely

even against overwhelming odds. For every three levels the war-

rior skald attains beyond 5th, he can inspire heroism in one addi-

tional creature. To inspire heroism, the warrior skald must recite

poetry and the creature must hear the poetry for a full round.

APPENDIX

A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls,

weapon damage rolls, and saving throws, and a +4 dodge bonus

to Armor Class. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the

warrior skald continue to recite poetry and for up to 5 rounds

thereafter.  This  is  a  mind-affecting  ability  that  counts  as  one

daily use of bardic music.

Words  of  Fear  (Su):  A  7th-level  warrior  skalds  oratory

becomes  frightful  to  foes  who  hear  and  understand  it.  Once

theyve  heard  the  warrior  skald  for  a  full  round,  opponents

within 20 feet must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + warrior

skald levels + Cha bonus) or be frightened (flee if possible, or

suffer  a  2  morale  penalty  on  attacks,  damage,  and  saves)  as

long as the warrior skald continues to recite and for 5 rounds

thereafter. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent ability

that counts as three daily uses of bardic music.

Words of Panic (Su): A 9th-level warrior skalds oratory is so

frightening that few can withstand it. Once theyve heard the

warrior  skald  for  a  full  round,  opponents

within  20  feet  must  succeed  on  a  Will

save (DC 10 + warrior skald levels + Cha

bonus)  or  be  panicked  (2  morale

penalty on saves, and creature flees or

cowers, dropping items) as long as the

warrior skald continues to recite and

for 5 rounds thereafter. This is a mind-

affecting,  language-dependent  ability

that counts as three daily uses of bardic

music.

Words  of  Fury  (Su):  A  10th-level  warrior

skald with at least 19 ranks in Perform can enrage her

allies. This ability functions exactly like barbarian rage

on all willing allies within 20 feet, and it lasts as long as

the  warrior  skald  continues  her  performance.  Words  of

fury  requires  three  daily  uses  of  performance  per  round

maintained. It is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.

Warsling Sniper

The warsling sniper is an expert in the use of the weapon

commonly  associated  with  the  halfling  race.  Among  the

hin, these individuals are known by their proper name, and

are  often  accorded  great  respect  in  the  hin  community.  To

nearly everyone else, however, these sharpshooters are known as

those  damned  sling  assassins!  or  by  even  more  colorful  epi-

thets. While some warsling snipers do actually sell their talents

to those wishing to dispose of their enemies, most are not pro-

fessional assassins but rather highly skilled specialists who use

their skills to help protect their communities or improve their

chances  of  adventuring  successfully.  A  number  of  warsling

snipers remain with their family for most of their lives, impart-

ing their superlative skills to the young.

Fighters,  monks,  and  rogues  are  the  most  common  practi-

tioners of warsling snipery. Some barbarians and rangers, par-

ticularly those fighting for a partisan cause or engaged in the

protracted defense of a homeland, find the warsling snipers tal-

ents highly useful in their work. The occasional druid or cleric

may adopt this path of study if it seems to support or compli-

ment her religious beliefs and practices. Wizards seldom sacrifice

the benefits of additional spells to take up the halfling warsling

with such single-minded devotion, and sorcerers do so with only

slightly more frequency.

The art of warsling expertise is often passed from generation

to  generation,  particularly  among  the  lightfoot  hin.  This

strong  familial  association  is  perhaps  the  reason  that

warsling snipers are found more frequently among light-

foot halflings than ghostwise or stronghearts. Warsling

snipers are not unknown among the ghostwise and strong-

heart hin, but generally these subraces prefer dif-

ferent  sorts  of  ranged  weapons.  A  small

gathering of warsling snipers sometimes cooper-

ate to undertake a joint mission (such as ambush-

ing  individuals  who  are  making  life  difficult  for

the local hin), and at least few wandering lightfoot

communities  boast  small  military  units  of  warsling

snipers.

Hit Die: d6

APPENDIX

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Warsling snipers gain no pro-

ficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Warsling Sneak Attack (Ex): Any time the warsling snipers

target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (regardless of

whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus), her ranged sneak

attack with the warsling deals extra damage. This extra damage

is  +1d6  at  1st  level,  and  increases  by  an  additional  1d6  every

other level after that (+2d6 at 3rd level and +3d6 at 5th level).

Ranged attacks only count as sneak attacks if the target is within

30 feet. In every other way, this ability is identical to the rogues

sneak attack. If the character has the sneak attack ability from

another class, the bonuses stack.

Snipers Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, warsling snipers gain a +2

bonus on sling attacks against targets with some degree of cover;

this bonus effectively reduces the benefit of cover because the

warsling sniper is adept at aiming for the exposed part of the

foe. Furthermore, if a skiprock sniper misses the target due to

concealment, she can reroll the miss chance percentile roll to see

if she actually hit.

Improved  Critical  (Ex): At  4th  level,  the  warsling  gains

Improved Critical (halfling warsling) as a bonus feat.

Improved Ricochet (Ex): At 6th level, the snipers expertise

with the warsling becomes so advanced that when she bounces a

skiprock off one target to hit another, the second attack roll is

made without the normal 2 penalty. This ability may be used

once per round.

Spells

The spells herein are presented in alphabetical order.

Aerial Summoning Dance

Conjuration (Summoning)

Level: Clr 4

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One summoned Large air elemental

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

As summon monster VI, except as noted above and that casting

the spell requires a flying dance by the caster and at least four

aarakocra, all of whom are treated as participating in the spell-

casting for the purpose of provoking attacks of opportunity and

maintaining concentration.

Burrow

Transmutation

Level: Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Your hands sprout claws as hard as stone. You can use these claws

to  burrow  through  earth,  sand,  clay,  and  gravel  (but  not  solid

rock), excavating with enough speed to move through the earth

at a speed of 10 feet, much like a badger.

You  can  use  the  claws  as  weapons  that  deal  1d6  points  of

damage.  If  your  normal  unarmed  damage  is  greater  than  1d6,

the damage does not change. You are considered armed while this

spell is in effect.

Arcane Material Component: A tuft of fur from a burrowing

animal, and a tiny replica of a shovel.

Commune with Earth

Divination

Level: Clr 5, Drd 5 (dwarf)

As commune with nature, except you instantly gain knowledge of

the  ground,  minerals,  bodies  of  water,  people,  general  animal

population,  burrowing  or  subterranean  creatures,  fungi,  and  so

on. The spell is only effective in hills, mountains, or underground

(including mines). The spell operates in a radius of one-half mile

per  level  of  the  caster  and  to  a  depth  of  one-quarter  mile  per

level.

Detect Metal and Minerals

Divination

Level: Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Area: Quarter-circle emanating from you to the extreme of the

range

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You can detect large accumulations of metals and other miner-

als,  whether  worked  or  unworked.  The  spell  will  detect  every-

thing from a vein of iron ore to a pile of gold coins, even through

solid stone or other barriers.

When  you  cast  this  spell,  you  must  concentrate  on  at  least

10 pounds of the metal or mineral youre searching for. If an

accumulation of that metal 10 pounds or larger is within the

spell area, you will unerringly sense it (most coins are 50 to

the pound).

The  amount  of  information  revealed  depends  on  how  long

you study a particular area:

1st  Round:  Presence  or  absence  of  the  particular  metal  or

mineral.

2nd Round: Approximate weight of the metal or mineral.

3rd  Round:  Distance  and  direction  (measured  in  a  straight

line) to the metal or mineral.

As long as the spell is active, you can change the metal or min-

eral youre trying to detect by simply concentrating on a differ-

ent  sample  (it  takes  a  standard  action  to  refocus  on  the  new

sample). Thus you could search for gold, then switch to adaman-

tine, then seek out sources of iron. If you stop concentrating on

a sample, the spell ends.

189

APPENDIX

If  your  sample  is  unworked,  you  will  detect  only  unworked

accumulations  of  the  metal,  such  as  ore  deposits  and  mineral

veins. You will only detect worked metal, such as gold coins or

mithral armor, if your sample is likewise refined.

Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.

The spell can penetrate any nonmagical solid barrier.

Material Component: A 10-pound sample of the metal or min-

eral to be detected.

Level: Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

You  create  a  fanged,  biting  mouth  in  the  palm  of  your  hand.

When you lay your hand upon a creature, the mouth deals 1d6

points of damage. If the target makes a successful Reflex save,

she suffers only half damage.

If the target fails her Reflex save, you may start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you

establish a hold, the fanged mouth sinks its teeth into the targets

flesh  and  continues  to  bite  for  an  additional  1d6  points  of

damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends.

Additionally, the fanged mouth delivers venom to a grappled

foe  when  you  achieve  a  hold,  dealing  1d6  points  of  temporary

Constitution  damage  (initial  and  secondary).  A  Fortitude  save

negates each instance of the poison damage.

Lawful Sword

Evocation

Level: Pal 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Saving Throw: None

This  spell  allows  you  to  channel  the  power  of  law  into  your

sword, or any weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 magic

weapon  and  deals  double  damage  against  chaotic  opponents.  It

emits  a  magic  circle  against  chaos  (as  the  spell).  If  the  magic

circle is broken before the spells duration ends, the sword creates

a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automati-

cally canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You

cannot have more than one lawful sword at a time.

If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell

supersede  any  that  the  weapon  normally  has,  rendering  the

normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inopera-

tive  for  the  duration  of  the  spell.  This  spell  is  not  cumulative

with  bless  weapon or  any  other  spell  that  might  modify  the

weapon in any way.

This spell does not work on artifacts.

until his incubation period has ended.

Shadow Canopy

Evocation [Darkness]

Level: Sor/Wiz 6

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Cylinder 25 ft. high with diameter 100 ft. + 50 ft./level

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates or none (object)

Spell Resistance: Yes or no (object)

You create a field of shadow. The outer surface of the field is

impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, granting 100%

concealment to creatures and objects within the spells area. A

creature under the effect of blacklight cannot see through the

field. The interior of the field casts a deep shadow on everything

within, reducing normal vision to 5 feet; creatures with darkvi-

sion can see normally within the field. Light, including sunlight,

cannot  penetrate  the  field.  Creatures  that  would  normally  be

adversely affected by sunlight, such as shades and vampires, are

able to function normally within the field.

You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is

stationary unless you cast it on a mobile object. You can cast the

spell on a creature, and the effect radiates from the creature and

moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do

not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance to resist

this spell.

Shadow canopy counters or dispels any light spell of equal

or  lower  level.  Light  spells  of  equal  level  have  no  effect  on

shadow canopy, but light spells of higher level counter or dispel

shadow canopy.

Material  Component: A  handful  of  coal  dust  and  the  dried

eyeball of any diurnal creature.

As stone shape, except as noted above and that

you affect metal instead of stone.

You may employ this spell in combat with

a successful melee touch attack. Shape metal

successfully  used  in  this  way  against  a

targets  armor  reduces  the  armors  pro-

tection  by  1d6  points  of  Armor  Class

(armor  such  as  studded  leather  that

mostly  made  of  nonmetal  materials

take  half  damage  from  this  spell).  If

used  against  a  shield,  weapon,  or

metallic  creature,  the  spell  deals

1d6  points  of  damage  per  2  caster

levels,  bypassing  the  targets  hard-

ness (or damage reduction in the case

of a creature).

Touching an unwilling creature or

an item held by an unwilling creature

requires a melee touch attack and pro-

vokes  an  attack  of  opportunity  from

the defender. You may ready an action

to touch a creature, its armor, its shield,

or  its  weapon  when  it  attempts  to  strike

you; this does not provoke an attack of oppor-

tunity (you are using the creatures movement to

come into contact with it).

Arcane  Material  Component: A  piece  of  wire,

bent approximately into the desired shape and touched

to the metal while the verbal component is uttered.

Handfang

bull rush, grapple, or who otherwise shares your area must make

a Fortitude saving throw or suffer 1d6 points of temporary Con-

stitution damage; another Fortitude saving throw is required 1

minute later to avoid taking 2d6 points of temporary Constitu-

tion damage.

As long as the spore cloak is active, you are immune to fungal

infestations such as the spores of brown or yellow mold and the

rotting touch of violet fungi.

If you fail a saving throw against a fire spell or effect, the

spores are instantly burnt away and the spell ends. If you are in

direct sunlight, the spell continues but the spores become inert

until you reach shelter. Inert spores continue to provide one-

half concealment but cannot infest others and do not pro-

vide protection from fungal attacks.

You become shrouded in a dense cloud of yellow mold spores.

You can see through the cloud with ease and are not affected by

it in any way, but it provides you one-half concealment (20%

miss chance). The cloak of swirling yellow spores travels with

you and does not leave a trail as you move. Anyone who passes

through your square, or anyone whom you successfully overrun,

Created by the legendary Shadowking of the Talfir, Verrakeths

of  this  spell.  The  effects  of  this  spell  do  not  stack  with  the

Shadow Weave Magic feat.

TWO SAMPLE LAIRS FOR USE WITH RACES OF FAERN

Tower of Life

and

Tomb of Death

Your  PCs  may  find  themselves  in  one  or  both  of

these sample lairs for two of the races detailed in

Races  of  Faern.  The  first  details  the  ancient

fortress tower of Tiru Tel-Quessir, an elven creation that was origi-

nally meant to serve as a place where ambassadors of the various elf

subraces could meet in a friendly environment and discuss the state

of their empires. The tower was abandoned at one time, though it

now serves as a bastion of defense in a hostile land. The second lair

details a Netherese tomb that has been discovered recently and par-

tially settled by a tribe of unruly orcs.

Each lair provides a history and a description of the major areas

of interest within, along with abbreviated statistics for the denizens

of  the  lair.  You  can  develop  these  barebones  nonplayer  characters

(NPCs) as you see fit, molding and changing them to fit your cam-

paign, no matter what world it takes place in. You can also adapt the

areas  for  any  levels,  swapping  out  creatures  as  needed  to  suit  the

level of your player characters (PCs).

Preparation

You, the Dungeon Master (DM), need a copy of the Players Hand-

book, the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide, and the Monster Manual to

use this material. Some of the elements in these two lairs draw upon

the Epic Level Handbook or Faiths and Pantheons, but these links

are  fairly  minor  and  simple  to  adjust  if  you  dont  have  access  to

these books.

Tiru Tel-Quessir

Tiru  Tel-Quessir,  translated  into  the  Common  tongue,  means

Tower  of  the  People.  This  impressive  structure  was  built  during

the height of Cormanthyr, the Empire of the Elves, as a neutral site

where representatives of the seven elf subraces could meet and dis-

cuss political and social matters of the time. Although representa-

tives of the avariel were present at these meetings only once, and

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

2

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

though  the  drow  never  saw  fit  to  visit  Tiru  Tel-Quessir,  all  seven

subraces were welcome in the tower.

The building was created with powerful elven High Magic from

eight ancient shadowtop trees deep in the woodlands of Cormanthor,

far from any other elven communities and hidden by a small but

quite powerful mythal. The tower consists of one central structure

surrounded by seven smaller ones. The seven smaller structures are

circular platforms placed 70 feet off the ground around the trunk

of an ancient shadowtop tree. Each of these small houses served as

a private retreat for one of the elven diplomats, and each was con-

nected to a circular platform atop the central structure. This saucer-

shaped  central  structure  was  formed  out  of  the  largest  shadowtop

tree in the region, and it straddled the trunk of the giant at a point

70 feet off the ground. A narrow staircase wound down the trunk to

provide ground access to the tower.

Since the fall of Myth Drannor, Tiru Tel-Quessir has stood aban-

doned  for  hundreds  of  years,  until  recently  when  a  small  band  of

elves discovered it and chose to make it a base of operations while

they gather intelligence on the drow that are rapidly infiltrating the

area.  These  elves  are  slowly  learning  how  to  use  the  magic  of  the

fading mythal to aid their efforts, and they spend much of their time

studying the ancient texts they discovered within the tower libraries.

Tiru  Tel-Quessir  would  make  an  excellent  base  of  operations  for

adventurers operating in the Cormanthor region, provided they can

prove their good intentions to the five elves who have moved in.

It generates a permanent screen on the area, making it appear to

observers  from  outside  the  ring  that  it  is  nothing  more  than  a

ring of large but otherwise unremarkable shadowtop trees.

All vegetation (including the shadowtop trees) within the mythal

is impervious to aging, diseases, and fire. The structures of Tell-

Quessir, including walls floors, ceilings, and roofs, are impervious

to fire. These walls are wood, but they have hardness 50 and spell

resistance 35, and the enhanced hardness and hit points extend to

floors, ceilings, and roof, too.

Anyone  who  passes  into  the  mythal must  make  a  Will  saving

throw  (DC  24)  or  his  mind  becomes  clouded  and  he  continues

moving  until  he  exits  the  mythal on  the  opposite  side.  Once  he

exits,  his  mind  clears  and  he  has  no  memories  that  anything

unusual just happened to him. Once a person makes this Will save,

he can see Tiru Tel-Quessir as it truly is and can enter and exit the

mythal with ease.

All  creatures  within  the  area  of  the  mythal are  constantly

affected by a feather fall spell.

Each time an elf willingly harms another elf while the attacker is

in the mythal, he must make a Will saving throw (DC 24) or be

affected with a feeblemind spell.

Using the Tower

As mentioned above, several elves are currently at Tiru Tel-Quessir,

and you may want to send your PCs there so that they can assist in

some manner. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Many  magic  tools  and  items  in  Tiru  Tel-Quessir  have  been

enhanced to grant a +2 sacred bonus to anyone of non-evil align-

ment who uses them. If these items are removed from the room

in which they were found, they lose their magical properties until

they are returned to their proper chamber.

The PCs are sent to Tiru Tel-Quessir at the behest of Shyansylars

leader to see how the elves progress and to give them an item to

aid the elves in their work. Once there, do the PCs assist Shyansy-

lar in her quest to find a traitor?

A band of drow that the PCs have been following end up near the

tower and set up camp there. Perhaps one of the scouts of the PCs

overhears  a  conversation  that  details  the  fact  that  someone  is

going to betray the elves inside the tower to the drow. What do

the PCs do?

Shyansylar sends out a request for aid that is brief and not very

clear. The PCs are sent to find out what happened and if they can

help out in any way. When they get to the tower, they find that

the drow have taken it over.

Tower Layout

All of the doors in Tiru Tel-Quessir are cleverly hidden and should

be treated as secret doors. A Spot check (DC 20) is required to locate

them. Windows are made of glassteel (glass that is as hard and strong

as steel) and magically bonded to their frames. An elf on the inside

can cause any of these windows to become ethereal by touching the

window and willing it to vanish for 1 hour if fresh air is desired.

sGlassteel Window: 1/8 in. thick; hardness 10; hp 10; AC 5; break

DC 20.

The mythal that cloaks Tiru Tel-Quessir was once quite powerful,

but now many of its powers have faded to a shadow of their former

glory. It affects everything within the radius of the seven shadow-

top trees that surround the tower and has the following effects, all

of which were created by epic-level casters and function at the 30th

level of ability. A successful dispel magic can negate one effect of

the mythal for a number of minutes equal to the level of the caster.

1. UPPER PLATFORM

The large, upper platform is open to the elements, but it has a thin

roof  of  tightly  interwoven  branches  and  leaves  to  provide  shelter

against rain. The elven diplomats used to gather here to watch the

woods, sunrises, sunsets, and similar displays of nature. Seven sloping

ramps arch down over the slanting roof of the main structure below

to connect to balconies (area 23).

2. STAIRS DOWN

The stairs are exposed to the open air and sky, and they lead down

to area 3 of the main level.

3. ENTRANCE

In the time of Myth Drannor, a trumpet archon who served as a

receptionist,  a  guide,  and  a  caretaker  for  Tiru  Tel-Quessir  guarded

the  entrance.  The  archon  has  long  since  left,  and  this  room  now

stands silent and empty.

4. CONFERENCE CHAMBER

The doors to the conference chamber are very cleverly hidden

and require a Spot check (DC 40) to discover; none of the elves

who have moved into the Tiru Tel-Quessir have discovered this

chamber  yet  and  they  believe  it  is  the  trunk  of  the  tree  the

building is built around. Those who discover the doors can open

them by touching them and willing the doors to become ethe-

real  (but  only  if  the  person  has  elven  blood,  which  includes

half-elves), or by making a Use Magic Device check (DC 25 to

emulate race).

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

4

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

Inside, the heart of the trees trunk has a permanent tree stride

effect upon it; the potent magic of the mythal allows beings to enter

the tree in a manner similar to the tree stride effect, but those enter-

ing the area cannot go into other trees.

Today,  all  that  remains  in  this  chamber  are  seven  comfortable

chairs arranged in a semicircle around a low platform in the center

of  the  room.  This  is  where  the  elven  diplomats  retreated  to  talk

about  matters  that  affected  all  of  their  races.  Each  of  the  seven

chairs is tailored to provide the most comfort to one of the seven

subraces. A Search check (DC 25) reveals that all of the chairs but

two have signs of wear (fraying of the upholstery). Of the other two

chairs,  one  shows  only  a  little  bit  of  wear,  while  the  other  looks

unused in comparison.

Anyone who sits in one of these chairs gains a +4 sacred bonus to

her  Wisdom  score  for  24  hours  as  they  become  infused  with  the

ancient spirits of the elves who debated long and hard within this

room. The chairs lose their magic permanently if they are removed

from  the  room,  and  they  temporarily  deactivate  (for  24  hours)

whenever they grant their sacred bonus.

5. LIBRARY

The elves who live often work in the large room that serves as the

main  library  of  Tiru  Tel-Quessir.  They  spend  their  time  poring

through the ancient texts and studying the ways of their ancestors;

Nerissus and Shyansylar are most commonly found here. No magic

texts exist here, but anyone who wishes to research something about

elven history or any location within Cormanthor gains a +4 circum-

stance  bonus  to  a  Knowledge  check  to  find  the  appropriate  infor-

mation.

An arcane spellcaster who prepares spells in this room may pre-

pare one additional spell of any spell level the caster normally has

access to if he or she possesses elven blood. Additionally, the auras in

this room grant a +2 sacred bonus to any Craft checks used to gen-

erate written works of art, and scrolls created in here cost 10% less

than their normal XP cost.

Nothing remains in this tiny closet.

6. CLOSET

7. BANQUET HALL

The banquet hall contains a large table around which sit seven com-

fortable chairs. When someone sits in one of the chairs, a set of clean

utensils and plates is created magically, along with a scented candle

and a bouquet of fresh flowers. These objects are only partially real,

and they vanish (along with any food residue left on them) if taken

from the room. The five elves often take their meals in this room,

though they dont always do so. Very rarely do they do so together.

8. CONSERVATORY

The conservatory contains several ancient elven instruments, each

of which magically keeps its tune and grants a +4 sacred bonus to

any Perform check made with them. Liriealan often relaxes by play-

ing music in this room.

9. INSTRUMENT CRAFTING ROOM

The instrument crafting room contains a large number of tools used

to build musical instruments; if used, they grant a +2 sacred bonus

to  all  Craft  checks  made  to  build  or  repair  instruments.  Magic

instruments  crafted  in  this  room  have  their  XP  cost  required  to

create the item reduced by 10%.

10. SEALED CHAMBER

The sealed chamber originally served as a recreational alchemist lab

until a tragic mistake made by a careless wizard resulted in a magically

enhanced strain of mindfire that requires a Fortitude save (DC 25) to

resist. The incubation of this virulent strain of the inhaled disease is

only 1 minute, and those infected must continue to make a Fortitude

saving throw each minute to avoid suffering 1d4 points of temporary

Intelligence damage. The elf who created this disease quickly used his

magic to seal the room apart and informed his brethren of the doom

he had brought upon himself before he grew too unintelligent to use

his magic to escape. The elf took his own life before he grew mindless,

and the room remained sealed as a memorial.

If  the  walls  of  the  room  are  breached,  anyone  who  enters  the

room  must  resist  the  effects  of  the  enhanced  mindfire.  The  elves

who have moved into this tower discovered the danger inside with

divination  magic  and  have  avoided  opening  the  room.  If  the

enhanced mindfire is released, the disease becomes harmless once it

leaves the confines of the mythal but quickly contaminates every-

thing within. A dispel magic or break enchantment cast against the

disease (it has a caster level of 18) defeats it.

The body of the dead elf still lies in the middle of the room (pre-

served by the mythal), along with his +3 dagger of spell storing, a robe

of the archmagi (good), a staff of fire (25 charges left), and a ring of

wizardry III.

11. ALCHEMY LAB

This  alchemy  lab  was  set  up  to  replace  the  lost  lab  in  area  10.

Anyone using the equipment in this room gains a +2 sacred bonus on

any Alchemy checks, and potions made in this room cost 10% less

than the regular XP cost to brew.

12. KITCHEN

In ages past, a large group of talented cooks staffed this large and

well-stocked kitchen. It now lies dormant and quiet. Anyone using

the equipment in here gains a +2 sacred bonus on any Craft (cook-

ing) checks.

13. WINE STORAGE

The  wine  storage  rooms  temperature  is  magically  moderated  to

make it a perfect place to store wine. Unfortunately, all of the wine

was taken or consumed long ago.

14. FOOD STORAGE

The walls of the food storage room contain several magic bins that

can create food once a day. Each bin is labeled in Elven as to what

kind of food it can create, and it can create only one type of food.

Even then, it creates only 1 cubic foot of the food per day. Never-

theless, the sheer number of creation bins mean that a cook could

feed a group of several dozen people with ease on a daily basis.

15. WATER ROOM

The small water room contains several large empty tubs and basins.

A pair of decanters of endless water sit on a shelf on the opposite

wall from the door.

16. CHAPEL TO THE SELDARINE

The  tiny  chapel  contains  a  single  padded  cushion  surrounded  by

small statues of the Seldarine. Each statue is crafted from rare wood

5

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

and stone and is mounted on a low pedestal. A single statue weighs

500 pounds, but if removed from this room, the statue immediately

teleports back to its proper pedestal. One pedestal is empty, and the

plaque  at  its  base  indicates  it  is  reserved  for  Eilistraee  should  she

ever deign to return to the Seldarine.

A divine spellcaster who prepares spells in this room may prepare

one additional spell of any spell level the caster normally has access

to if, provided he is a worshiper of one of the Seldarine or of Eilis-

traee.  Alauniira  often  worships  in  here  or  works  on  her  statue  of

Eilistraee.

17. ARCHONS CHAMBER

The  trumpet  archon  used  this  small  chamber  to  relax;  it  is  now

devoid of anything of interest but a lingering aura of good can be

detected within still.

18. LAVATORY

This small room contains magic facilities that automatically dispose

of waste products by disintegrating such matter upon deposit. Only

waste can be disintegrated in this manner.

19. DEACTIVATED PORTAL

The deactivated portal room once contained a portal that led to the

heart of Myth Drannor, but it was deactivated at the time of Myth

Drannors fall.

20. MAGIC FORGE

Several magic tools used to craft arms and armor, including a magic

forge, are in the room. The air in this room is magically ventilated

to  prevent  smoke  from  building  up.  Craft  checks  used  to  create

armor  or  weapons  gain  a  +2  sacred  bonus  in  this  room,  and  any

magic arms or armor built in here cost 10% less the standard expe-

rience point cost.

21. MAGIC WORKSHOP

The magic workshop contains a large number of tools and devices

used to create miscellaneous magic items such as rings, wands, staffs,

rods, and wondrous items. Any such item created in this room costs

10% less than the normal XP cost for crafting the item.

22. IDENTIFICATION CHAMBER

The chamber contains a wide variety of lenses, scales, calipers, and

reference books, and all of these items are organized upon a sturdy

worktable or upon shelves lining the walls. Anyone using the tools

or books in here can cast one of the following spells each day upon

items within the room as if an 18th-level caster: identify, analyze

dweomer, or legend lore.

23. BALCONY

The seven balconies overlook the grounds of the Tiru Tel-Quessir. A

graceful  hanging  bridge  connects  each  balcony  to  a  separate  plat-

form on one of the surrounding shadowtop trees.

2430. Chambers

of the Ambassadors

The seven buildings have identical layouts; the ambassadors of the

6

seven  elf  subraces  lived  in  these  buildings  while  they  served  their

duties in the Tiru Tel-Quessir. Each building was outfitted to make

its particular elf inhabitant as comfortable as possible.

Area A is an open balcony used to relax and watch the world go by.

Area B is a lounge where an ambassador could meet with guests.

A single shield guardian watched over each of these chambers and

served  the  ambassador  for  the  duration  of  the  elfs  stay.  These

guardians are all long since destroyed, save for the one in the drow

building (area 28B).

Area C is a private balcony that provided a view of the woodlands

uninterrupted by the Tiru Tel-Quessir. Long ago, a lantern archon

stood  on  each  of  these  balconies  to  provide  illumination  and  to

guard  against  approaching  troublemakers;  the  lantern  archons  are

all long since gone.

Area D contains a particularly well-hidden secret door (Spot DC

35) that opens to reveal a functional portal that could be attuned to

the current ambassador, allowing her to travel between the Tiru Tel-

Quessir and her hometown, wherever that may be. You can have any

number of these portals remain active if you wish to provide access

to certain elven home towns; the only portal that is always deacti-

vated is the drow portal, since it was never used.

Area  E  is  where  the  ambassador  could  retire  to  relax  in  peace

after a busy day.

Five of these buildings are currently inhabited by the five elves

who have recently discovered Tiru Tel-Quessir and are now using it

as a base of operations to observe the drow in the region.

24. MOON ELF CHAMBERS

The  moon  elf  chambers  are  currently  inhabited  by  Nerissus  Kri-

ankaria  (NG  female  moon  elf  Wiz12/Brd2),  the  friendliest  of  the

five  elves  and  the  most  welcoming  to  outsiders.  She  has  an  owl

familiar named Kirilan.

25. SUN ELF CHAMBERS

Shyansylar Aalantrilu (CG female sun elf Wiz13/Acm2), the leader

of the group of elves located here, currently inhabits the former sun

elf chambers. She spends most of her free time studying the history

books in the library or keeping an eye on her fellow elves. Shyansy-

lar  is  somewhat  brisk  and  difficult  to  get  along  with  unless  her

orders are followed to the letter. She suspects that one of her com-

panions is a traitor working for the drow, and her current suspect is

Alauniira. Shyansylar believes Alauniira to be a priestess of Vhaer-

aun who is greatly skilled at hiding her true nature. Shyansylar is

right about the fact that one of her companions is a traitor, but she

is completely mistaken about Alauniira being the one.

26. WOOD ELF CHAMBERS

Liriealan Talidinorku (CG male wood elf Brd14) stays in the wood

elf chambers; he thinks of this assignment as a grand adventure and

his light-hearted attitude is starting to grate on his companions.

27. AVARIEL CHAMBERS

The avariel building is unique in that its walls are enchanted so that

they are completely transparent from the inside, giving the place an

open feeling. It has been used only once or twice; a search of area E

easily  procures  several  large  remarkably  well-preserved  black

feathers  from  an  unknown  bird  (they  are,  in  fact,  from  the  one

avariel who stayed here ages ago).

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

28. DROW CHAMBERS

Although this chamber was never used during the Tiru Tel-Quessirs

heyday, it is now the home of Alauniira Mlezziir (NG female drow

Clr7/Brd1/Sword  Dancer6),  a  kind-hearted  drow  who  nevertheless

barely convinced Shyansylar to let her come along; she is doing her best

to see that any drow the group encounters are treated fairly and kindly.

The sword dancer prestige class is detailed in Faiths and Pantheons.

29. GREEN ELF CHAMBERS

The  green  elf  chambers  are  currently  inhabited  by  Yiruikar  Zis-

tialakus (NE male wild elf Rgr7/Drd7), who has long been an ally

of the drow who are invading Cormanthor. He uses magic items to

hide his true nature and is simply waiting for a chance to strike to

cripple his allies so he can lead the drow to this amazing location.

30. AQUATIC ELF CHAMBERS

The aquatic elf chambers are the most unique of the seven, for areas

B, D, and E are filled completely with cool saltwater. The water is

magically contained in these rooms, and one can pass easily through

the vertical walls that delineate its boundaries.

The Lost Tomb

of Amarak

Many  powerful  spellcasters  lived  and  died  in  ancient  Netheril.  A

somewhat morbid game that gained popularity in the final days of

the nation was an informal contest among the wizards of the realm

as to who could build the most dangerous and most theft-proof tomb

for their eventual internment. Many wizards used slaves or captured

prisoners to test out their tombs, and they often placed bets on how

long their latest victim would survive. One of the cannier of these

wizards was a master of the element of air: Amarak the Vaporous.

Amarak  built  his  tomb  underground  in  the  Nether  Mountains

nearly fifteen miles directly north of what would eventually become

the location for Hellgate Keep. Unfortunately, he made his dungeon

a little too clever, and while he was inspecting the final product, he

accidentally imprisoned himself alive. His minions, glad to be free

of  his  sadistic  dominion,  quickly  finished  sealing  the  tomb  and

burned all maps of its location and moved on to more pleasant lives.

Centuries later, a group of orcs known as the Skullcleavers stum-

bled  upon  the  entrance  to  Amaraks  Lost  Tomb.  A  large  nest  of

ankhegs had burrowed out a tangled network of tunnels and caves

near  the  tomb,  and  they  had  actually  broken  through  its  walls  in

some places. The Skullcleavers thought the location of the ankheg

burrows were in a perfect spot to recuperate after their latest tangle

with the Tornface orcs, and they decided to hole up in the burrows

once their leader, a tanarukk barbarian/sorcerer named Gristlegape,

charmed the ankhegs. Since then, the Skullcleavers have befriended

the  burrowing  beasts  and  have  been  mounting  increasingly  bold

forays  into  the  halls  of  Amaraks  tomb  in  search  of  treasure.

Gristlegape believes (correctly) that a large stash of powerful magic

items lies hidden somewhere in the ancient tomb, but he is unsure

where to look.

The  Lost  Tomb  of  Amarak  and  the  lair  of  the  Skullcleavers

serves as a classic example of how a tribe of orcs often moves into

an ancient ruin and uses the traps and guardians found therein to

their advantage.

Using the Tomb

If you need some ideas to get the PCs to the tomb, here are some to

get you going:

A seeker of lore sends the PCs out to find the tomb of Amarak.

She believes that if they find the tomb, theyll find a journal that

Amarak had kept.

A local ranger (or leader) is wondering why the Skullcleavers are

being so quiet, and he worries that the Tornface orcs may have

destroyed them or are gaining too much time to rebuild their own

forces while the Skullcleavers leave them alone. To find out what

is going on, the ranger requests that the PCs look into where the

Skullcleavers have gone while he seeks out the Tornface orcs and

gets an idea of how their forces are doing.

Tomb Layout

The tomb consists of two main sections: the orc/ankheg warrens and

the tomb itself. So far, the orcs have explored up to area 22 of the

tomb and have discovered many potent and useful magic items (all

of which have been claimed by Gristlegape). They havent found the

secret stone slab in area 15A yet, and they have not dealt with the

guardian of room 22. Suggested guardians of the tomb are indicated

in the text, but you should place treasures appropriate to your cam-

paign and partys level.

The  warrens  are  dusty,  dirty,  and  reinforced  with  thick  resins

exuded  by  the  ankhegs.  The  Skullcleaver  Tribe  consists  of  several

orcs, a few ogres, a troll, and Gristlegape himself.

The tomb itself is much cleaner, drier, and quite stale. Several sec-

tions of the tomb contain large slabs of rock in lieu of doors. Each

of these slabs weighs about 1,500 pounds; a couple of orcs have no

problem moving these slabs aside but they may prove a problem to

player  characters  without  a  high  enough  Strength  to  move  such

massive blocks. Some of these slabs (the light orange ones) are clev-

erly hidden and pass for dead ends unless found by a Search check

(DC 21).

1. ENTRANCE

The main entrance to the Tomb of Amarak is a 50-foot-deep shaft

plugged by a 5,000 pound boulder. This shaft leads down into this

room, the walls of which bear intricate bas-relief carvings depicting

the works of Amarak in ancient Netheril.

2. HALLWAY

The stairs leading up and down in this hallway were introduced to

make it difficult to move the three stone blocks at area 12 very far,

which prevents easy entrance into the tomb proper.

3. WARRENS

The  winding  warren  tunnels  are  often  infested  with  orcs  moving

from one cave to another. At several points, steep (but not vertical)

shafts lead up and out of the warren; climbing up or down one of

these shafts requires a Climb check (DC 10). Four ankhegs wander

in these warrens. Gristlegape has charmed them all, so they do little

to bother the orcs.

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

4. WESTERN GARDEN

The western garden is a cave filled with glistening mounds of fungi,

in which several shriekers and three violet fungi have sprouted. The

orcs  found  out  about  the  dangerous  fungi  the  hard  way,  and  they

now avoid this chamber.

5. EASTERN GARDEN

Like the cave to the west, the eastern garden chamber is filled with

nasty fungi. The fungi in here are mostly harmless, and the orcs are

actually starting to develop a taste for the stuff.

6. NORTHERN GARDEN

Yet  another  fungus-choked  cavern,  this  cave  has  several  large

patches  of  red  spotted  pale  yellow  mushrooms  known  as  poxcaps

growing on the walls. Pjulak the orc alchemist has discovered a way

to  distill  the  dangerous  sap  exuded  from  the  caps  of  these  mush-

rooms into a fairly potent poison.

Poxcap Sweat: Type Injury DC 15; Initial Damage 1d4 Str; Sec-

ondary Damage 2d4 Str plus nausea for 6d6 minutes; Price 200 gp.

7. SLIME PIT

The slime pit is a large, sunken cavern that contains a small lake of

green slime. The orcs have been using this room to torture prisoners

and get rid of particularly foul-smelling garbage; when the slime grows

too big Pjulak simply trims it back with a few remove disease spells.

8. WATER SUPPLY

A large pool of brackish water fills the water supply cave.

9. FOOD STORAGE

The orcs store what food they catch in the mountains above in the

food storage cave and typically allow it to ripen a bit before eating it.

10. ARMORY

The Skullcleavers have stashed a large pile of weapons and armor

looted  from  their  recent  victims  in  this  cave.  These  items  are  in

fairly poor condition; all of the really good weapons and armor are

being used. (Dungeon Masters should come up with a list that suits

their needs.)

11. ANKHEG LAIR

This large cave is the main lair of the four ankheg that dwell in the

warrens.

12. STONE BLOCKS

The  stone  blocks  were  transported  into  place  magically  to  seal

Amarak in his tomb. Each block weighs well over 10,000 pounds.

13. JUNCTION

The  Skullcleaver  orcs  penetrated  the  tomb  via  the  tunnel  that

breached  area  14.  They  have  taken  advantage  of  these  four  stone

blocks and rigged them so that if they are pushed incorrectly, the

block overbalances and topples onto the pusher, causing 4d6 points

of damage. A falling block also serves to alert the Skullcleavers of

an intrusion if the trespassers have made it this far unnoticed.

aFalling  Block  Trap: CR  3;  mechanical;  touch  trigger;  repair

reset; Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; push correctly to bypass (Search

[DC 25]); Atk +15 melee (4d6, stone block); Search DC 20; Disable

Device DC 20. Market Price: .

14. WESTERN BURIAL CHAMBER

The  western  burial  chamber  possesses  the  interred  bodies  of

Amaraks favorite warriors and guards. Gristlegape has had Pjulak

animate  the  ten  skeletons  here  as  undead  guardians;  they  do  not

interfere with any orcs passing through the room.

15. EASTERN BURIAL CHAMBER

Amarak interred his favorite servants and lesser minions in the east-

ern burial chamber. Now, it serves as the primary barracks for the bulk

of the Skullcleaver Tribe. The bodies have been pulled from their biers

and stacked in the northern end of the room, and the tougher orcs use

the niches in the walls as beds after they pad them with piles of dirt

brought in from the warrens. No less than 27 orcs are in this room: 4

orc  ragers  (CE  male  northern  orc  Bar1),  8  orc  mashers  (CE  male

northern orc War2), 15 orc thugs (CE male northern orc War1).

16. GOLEM PIT

The junction to the south was originally guarded by a stone golem.

Unable to harm it with their weapons, Gristlegape earned the admi-

ration of his fellows by bull rushing the golem into the open pit in

this location. This pit is 40 feet deep and the golem wasnt damaged

by the fall, but it certainly cant get out of the pit. Anyone unlucky

enough to fall in is in dire trouble.

17. TROLL BARRACKS

Amaraks favorite pets were interred in this crypt. It now serves as

the  lair  of  Lerakshalakus  (CE  female  troll  Bbn1),  the  single  troll

allied with the Skullcleavers.

18. OGRE BARRACKS

This crypt houses the remains of Amaraks favorite mount, a large

wyvern.  It  has  been  all  but  pulverized  by  the  two  ogres  that  live

here now.

19. SWARM TRAP

The floor of this room is a tangled mess of flagstones that possess a

variety of shapes. The east and west walls of this room depict the

scowling visage of a terrible monster. A successful Knowledge (reli-

gion) check or Knowledge (the Planes) check (DC 25) identifies it as

a depiction of the demon prince Pazuzu, patron of ancient Amarak.

Crossing  between  these  two  leering  faces  triggers  an  ancient  trap

that  unleashes  an  insect  plague spell  that  fills  the  room  and  the

southern  hallway  to  area  13;  the  insect  plague manifests  at  caster

level 20 with the exception of the much smaller area of effect. The

Skullcleavers lost two orcs to this trap and have since learned how

to bypass it by stepping on only the diamond-shaped stones in the

floor (which follow a path around the proximity of the trap). This

trap makes an incredible din, and if it is triggered, the denizens of

the nearby rooms quickly converge on the hall to prevent those in

the hall from escaping to shelter in the side passages.

Tower of Life and Tomb of Death

20. CRYPT OF THE DAUGHTERS

Amarak interred his two daughters in this crypt. Now, the place is

the lair of the Skullcleaver tribes only spellcaster, Pjulak the Ripe

(NE male northern orc Adept9).

21. CRYPT OF THE SONS

Amarak interred his three sons within this crypt. More importantly

now, Gristlegape (CE male tanarukk Bbn4/Sor8), the leader of the

Skullcleavers, has chosen this location as his lair. He often stays here

along with his two wives (CE female northern orc War 2) and his

loyal  group  of  six  barbarian  bodyguards  (CE  male  northern  orc

Bbn4).  All  of  his  bodyguards  have  weapons  poisoned  with  poxcap

sweat, as do Gristlegapes weapons.

22. THE INNER GUARDIAN

This large room is as far as the Skullcleaver orcs have penetrated. A

large stone statue of Pazuzu dominates it, though this statue is in

fact a half-fiend stone golem. The terrible monster attacks anyone

who dares to enter the room with a great fury, but it does not pursue

the attack beyond the limits of the room.

23. TRAPPED SLAB

This appears to be another large slab blocking a tunnel, but in truth

it is merely a cruel trap that teleports anyone who touches it a mile

straight up. Those who cannot fly probably fall to their death.

{{arrow}}Teleport Above Trap: CR 10; spell; spell trigger; auto-

matic reset; spell effect (teleportation circle, 20th-level cleric, DC 24

Will save negates); Search DC 34; Disable Device DC 34. Cost: 680

gp to hire NPC spellcaster.

24. FALSE CRYPT

This appears to be an opulent crypt of a powerful wizard. Mounds

of jewels, gems, and magic items are strewn about haphazardly on

pedestals,  and  a  golden  sarcophagaus  sits  on  a  dais  to  the  north

before  a  leering  bas-relief  of  Pazuzu.  In  fact,  this  is  a  false  crypt

built by Amarak to destroy unwary raiders. The jewelry and gems in

this room are all fake, and the apparently numerous magic items are

actually just regular items with permanent Nystuls magic auras. In

addition, the room is guarded by a deadly trap. A minute after the

entrance to the room is breached, a wall of force cast at the 20th

level of the caster manifests to the south, blocking off the only exit.

Then, the bas-relief of Pazuzu on the north wall begins to exhale air

at an alarming rate into the room. Every minute, the air pressure

increases  enough  to  cause  pressure  damage  as  if  those  inside  were

100 feet deeper underwater until an effective pressure of 1,000 feet

underwater  is  reached.  After  an  hour,  the  air  pressure  returns  to

normal and the wall of force vanishes.

The  increasing  pressure  can  be  halted  by  dispelling  the  20th-level

magic on the Pazuzu bas-relief (though the area directly in front of

the bas-relief is also trapped by the falling block trap, which does not

hamper the air exhalation if triggered), or by a rogue making a Dis-

able  Device  check  (DC  32).  Destroying  the  bas-relief  also  works.

Unfortunately, if the bas-relief is targeted with magic or touched in

any way, it summons a pair of Huge half-fiend air elementals that

immediately attack any intruders.

25. SECRET PASSAGEWAY

The secret entrance to this long winding passageway has not been

discovered  by  the  orcs  yet.  The  air  in  the  hall  is  tainted  by  the

unholy fumes issuing from the portal in area 28; anyone breathing

these fumes must make a Fortitude saving throw every 10 minutes

or suffer 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage.

26. DEAD END

Amarak originally intended to build a complex maze in this area of

his tomb, but he ran out of time and interest. The passageway ends

here in an unworked stone wall.

27. SECOND FALSE CRYPT

This small room appears to be the humble crypt of a wizard, but it

is actually just another false crypt. Amarak hoped to trick would be

robbers that discovered the first crypt into thinking that this second

humble crypt was the true crypt of the tomb. To further enhance

the illusion, the stone sarcophagus contains an ancient body (one of

Amaraks  favored  apprentices)  along  with  a  moderate  amount  of

magic, wizardly treasure (a treasure of Encounter Level 10 in value;

magic items only). There are no traps here.

28. PORTAL CHAMBER

The western wall of the portal chamber is a swirling vortex of reek-

ing black smoke. This is a one-way portal that leads to Pazuzus lair

on the Abyss; Amarak enjoyed getting rid of his enemies by tossing

them  through  this  portal.  Two  vrock  barbarians  (CE  vrock  male

Bbn3) are bound to this room; they attack anyone who enters.

29. TRUE CRYPT

The  true  crypt  of  Amarak  is  a  large  and  well-decorated  chamber.

This crypt has three main defenses. The first is the 150 foot deep pit

in  the  western  portion  of  the  room.  Hurricane-force  winds  blow

from the ceiling down into the pit, shunted here via portals to the

Elemental Plane of Air that allow only air to pass through.

The second defense is the steps in the middle of the room; they

are coated with magically preserved sovereign glue that holds any-

thing that touches them in place.

The third defense is Amyrisu (CE half-fiend/half-invisible stalker

male  Rog8/Asn3),  who  Amarak  eternally  bound  to  this  chamber;

this creature uses the wind pit and the glue stairs to its full advan-

tage when it attacks intruders.
