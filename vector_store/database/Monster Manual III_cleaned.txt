Introduction

Welcome to Monster Manual III. This book contains new

creatures for use in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventures. The

monster entries are generally alphabetical by name, with

closely related monsters grouped together. In addition to

the alphabetical listing at the front of this book, monsters

are also listed by type and subtype (page 7), by Challenge

Rating (page 224), and by ECL (page 224).

This introduction explains how to read each creatures

write-up. It often refers to the Glossary (starting on page

208) for more details on attack forms and the special quali-

ties associated with monsters.

READING THE ENTRIES

Each monster description is organized in the same gen-

eral format, as outlined below. For complete information

about the characteristics of monsters, consult the Glos-

sary  of  this  book,  the  Players  Handbook,  or  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide.

STATISTICS BLOCK

This portion of a monster description contains basic game

information on the creature.

Name

This is the name by which the creature is generally known.

The descriptive text may provide other names.

Size and Type

This line describes the creatures size (Huge, for example).

Size categories are de ned in the Glossary. A size modi-

 er applies to the creatures Armor Class (AC) and attack

bonus, as well as to certain skills. A creatures size also

determines how far it can reach to make a melee attack

and  how  much  space  it  occupies  in  a  fight  (see  Space/

Reach, below).

The size and type line continues with the creatures type

(giant, for example). Type determines how magic affects a

creature;  for  example,  the  hold  animal  spell  affects  only

creatures of the animal type. Type determines certain fea-

tures, such as Hit Dice size, base attack bonus, base saving

throw  bonuses,  and  skill  points.  For  quick  reference,  the

glossary gives a full description of the features and traits of

each type and subtype.

Hit Dice

This line gives the creatures number and type of Hit Dice,

and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives

the average hit points for a creature of the indicated number

of Hit Dice.

A creatures Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for

determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural

healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.

4

Initiative

This line gives the creatures modi er on initiative checks.

Speed

This  line  gives  the  creatures  tactical  speed  on  land  (the

amount of distance it can cover in one move action). If the

creature wears armor that reduces its speed, the creatures

base land speed follows.

If the creature has other modes of movement, these are

given after (or in place of) the land speed. Unless otherwise

noted, modes of movement are natural (not magical). See the

Glossary for information on movement modes.

Armor Class

The Armor Class line gives the creatures AC for normal

combat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modi-

 ers contributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural

armor). The creatures touch and  at-footed ACs follow the

combat-ready AC.

A creatures armor pro ciencies (if it has any) depend on

its type, but in general a creature is automatically pro cient

with  any  kind  of  armor  it  is  described  as  wearing  (light,

medium, or heavy), and with all lighter kinds of armor.

Base Attack/Grapple

The number before the slash on this line is the creatures

base attack bonus (before any modi ers are applied). The

DM usually wont need this number, but it can be handy

sometimes, especially if the creature has the Power Attack

or Combat Expertise feats.

The number after the slash is the creatures grapple bonus,

which is used when the creature makes a grapple attack or

when someone tries to grapple the creature. The grapple

bonus  includes  all  modi ers  that  apply  to  the  creatures

grapple checks (base attack bonus, Strength modi er, spe-

cial size modi er, and any other applicable modi er, such as

a racial bonus on grapple checks).

Attack

This line shows the single attack the creature makes with

an attack action. In most cases, this is also the attack the

creature  uses  when  making  an  attack  of  opportunity  as

well.  The  attack  line  provides  the  weapon  used  (natural

or manufactured), attack bonus, and form of attack (melee

or ranged). The attack bonus given includes modi cations

for  size  and  Strength  (for  melee  attacks)  or  Dexterity  (for

ranged  attacks).  A  creature  with  the  Weapon  Finesse  feat

can use its Dexterity modi er on melee attacks.

If the creature uses natural attacks, the natural weapon

given  here  is  the  creatures  primary  natural  weapon  (see

the Glossary).

If  the  creature  has  several  different  weapons  at  its  dis-

posal, the alternatives are shown, with each different attack

routine separated by the word or.

A creature can use one of its secondary natural weapons

(see the Glossary) when making an attack action, but if it

does it takes an attack penalty, as noted in the Full Attack

section below.

The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically.

Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a

subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.

Whos next?

Full Attack

This line shows all the physical attacks the creature makes

when  it  uses  a  full-round  action  to  make  a  full  attack.  It

gives the number of attacks along with the weapon, attack

bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The  rst entry

is for the creatures primary weapon, with an attack bonus

including  modi cations  for  size  and  Strength  (for  melee

attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with

the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modi er on

melee attacks.

The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with

them are made with a 5 penalty to the attack roll, no matter

how many there are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat (see

page 207) take only a 2 penalty on secondary attacks.

The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically.

Damage  from  an  attack  is  always  at  least  1  point,  even  if  a

subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.

A  creatures  primary  attack  damage  includes  its  full

Strength  modi er  (1-1/2  times  its  Strength  bonus  if  the

attack  is  with  the  creatures  sole  natural  weapon)  and  is

given   rst.  Secondary  attacks  add  only  1/2  the  creatures

Strength bonus and are given second in the parentheses.

If  any  attacks  also  have  some  special  effect  other  than

damage  (poison,  disease,  energy  drain,  and  so  forth),  that

information is given here.

Unless otherwise noted, creatures using natural weapons

deal double damage on critical hits.

Manufactured Weapons: Creatures that use swords,

bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters

do. The bonus for attacks with two-handed weapons is 1-1/2

times the creatures Strength modi er (if it is a bonus), and

is given  rst. Off-hand weapons add only 1/2 the Strength

bonus and are given second in the parentheses.

Space/Reach

This line describes how much space the creature takes up

on the battle grid and thereby needs to  ght effectively, as

well as how close it has to be to threaten an opponent. The

number before the slash is the creatures space, or how many

feet one side of the creature occupies (see the Size entry in

the Glossary for speci cs). For example, a creature with a

space  of  15  feet  occupies  a  3-square-by-3-square  space  on

the battle grid. The number after the slash is the creatures

natural reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to

a weapon, tentacle, or the like, the extended reach and its

source are noted in parentheses at the end of the line.

Special Attacks and Special Qualities

Many creatures have unusual abilities, which can include spe-

cial attack forms, resistance or vulnerability to certain types

of damage, and enhanced senses, among others. A monster

entry  breaks  these  abilities  into  special  attacks  and  special

qualities. The latter category includes defenses, vulnerabili-

ties, and other special abilities that are not modes of attack. A

special ability is usually categorized either as extraordinary

(Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su). See the Glossary for

de nitions of special abilities. Additional information (when

needed) is provided in the creatures descriptive text.

When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind

of  save  and  the  save  DC  is  noted  in  the  descriptive  text.

Most saving throws against special abilities have DCs cal-

culated as follows: 10 + 1/2 the attackers racial Hit Dice +

620_17921_MonsterManual3c.indd   5

the relevant ability modi er. The save DC is given in the

creatures description along with the ability on which the

DC is based.

that defy its natural tendencies. In extreme circumstances

(a porpoise attempting a Climb check, for instance) you can

rule that the creature fails the check automatically.

Saves

Feats

This line gives the creatures Fortitude, Re ex, and Will save

modi ers, which take into account its type, ability score mod-

i ers, and any special qualities that affect its saving throws.

Abilities

This line lists all six of the creatures ability scores, in the

customary order: Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where

otherwise noted, each creature is assumed to have the basic

array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 11, 11, 11, 10,

10, 10. To determine any creatures racial ability adjustments,

subtract 10 from any even-numbered ability score and sub-

tract 11 from any odd-numbered score. (Exceptions are noted

in the Combat section of a creatures descriptive text.)

Most  abilities  work  as  described  in  Chapter  1  of  the

Players Handbook, with exceptions given below.

Strength: As noted on page 162 of the Players Handbook,

quadrupeds  can  carry  heavier  loads  than  bipeds  can.  Any

creature with four or more motive limbs can carry a load as a

quadruped, even if it does not necessarily use all the limbs at

once. For example, ambush drakes carry loads as quadrupeds.

Intelligence:  A  creature  can  speak  all  the  languages

mentioned in its description, plus one additional language

per  point  of  Intelligence  bonus.  Any  creature  with  an

Intelligence  score  of  3  or  higher  understands  at  least  one

language (Common, unless otherwise noted).

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores.

These creatures do not have an ability score of 0they lack

the  ability  altogether.  The  modi er  for  a  nonability  is  +0.

Other effects of nonabilities are detailed in the Glossary.

Skills

This line gives the creatures skills, along with each skills

modi er  (including  adjustments  for  ability  scores,  armor

check penalties, and any bonuses from feats or racial traits).

All listed skills are class skills, unless the creature has a char-

acter class (noted in the entry). A creatures type and Intelli-

gence score determine the number of skill points it has.

The  Skills  section  of  the  creatures  description  recaps

racial bonuses and other adjustments to skill modi ers for

the  sake  of  clarity;  these  bonuses  should  not  be  added  to

the listed skill modi ers. An asterisk (*) beside the relevant

score and in the Skills section of the descriptive text indi-

cates a conditional adjustment, one that applies only in cer-

tain situations (for instance, an avalancher gets an additional

+4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in areas of rocky or

mountainous terrrain).

Natural Tendencies: Some creatures simply arent made

for certain types of physical activity. Elephants, despite their

great Strength scores, are terrible at jumping. Giant crocodiles,

despite their high Strength scores, dont climb well. Horses

cant walk tightropes. If it seems clear to you that a particular

creature simply is not made for a particular physical activity,

you can say that the creature takes a 8 penalty on skill checks

The line gives the creatures feats. The creatures descriptive

text may contain additional information if a feat works dif-

ferently from the description on pages 206207 or Chapter

5 of the Players Handbook.

Sometimes a creature has one or more bonus feats, marked

with a superscript B (B). Creatures often do not have the pre-

requisites for a bonus feat. If this is so, the creature can still

use the feat. If you wish to customize the creature with new

feats, you can reassign its other feats, but not its bonus feats.

A creature cannot have a feat that is not a bonus feat unless

it has the feats prerequisites.

Environment

This line gives a type of climate and terrain where the creature

is typically found. This describes a tendency, but is not exclu-

sionary. A bloodstriker dinousaur, for instance, has an Envi-

ronment entry of warm forests, but could also be encountered

in warm plains, temperate forests, or in any environment as

an animal companion. See Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide for more on terrain types and climate.

Organization

This line describes the kinds of groups the creature might

form.  A  range  of  numbers  in  parentheses  indicates  how

many combat-ready adults are in each type of group. Many

groups also have a number of noncombatants, expressed as

a percentage of the  ghting population. Noncombatants can

include young, the in rm, slaves, or other individuals who

are not inclined to  ght. A creatures Society section may

include more details on noncombatants.

If the organization line includes the term domesticated,

the creature is generally found only in the company of other

creatures, whom it serves in some capacity.

Challenge Rating

This line gives the average level of a party of adventurers for

which one creature of this kind would make an encounter of

moderate dif culty. Assume a party of four fresh characters

(full  hit  points,  full  spells,  and  equipment  appropriate  to

their levels). Given reasonable luck, the party should be able

to win the encounter with some damage but no casualties.

For more information about Challenge Ratings, see pages 36

and 48 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Treasure

This  line  describes  how  much  wealth  the  creature  owns

and refers to Table 35: Treasure on page 52 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide. In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in

its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels.

Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such

as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky

items at home. See the Glossary for more details on using the

Treasure line of each monster entry.

Note: The random dungeon generation tables in Chapter

3 of the Dungeon Masters Guide provide their own treasure

information.  Use  that  information  instead  of  a  monsters

Treasure line whenever you use those tables.

Alignment

This line gives the alignment that the creature is most likely

to have. Every entry includes a quali er that indicates how

broadly that alignment applies to the species as a whole. See

the Glossary for details.

Level Adjustment

This line is included in the entries of creatures suitable for

use as player characters or as cohorts (usually creatures with

Intelligence  scores  of  at  least  3  and  possessing  opposable

thumbs). Add this number to the creatures total Hit Dice,

including class levels, to get the creatures effective character

level (ECL). A characters ECL affects the experience the char-

acter earns, the amount of experience the character must have

before gaining a new level, and the characters starting equip-

ment.  See  pages  172,  199,  and  209  of  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide for more information.

Advancement

This book usually describes only the most commonly encoun-

tered version of a creature (though some entries for advanced

monsters are provided). A creatures Advancement line shows

how tough the creature can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice.

(The upper limit given in the entry is not an absolute ceiling,

but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often, intelligent crea-

tures advance by gaining a level in a character class instead

of just gaining a new Hit Die.

Descriptive Text

The body of each entry opens with a sentence or two that

describes  what  the  player  characters  might  see  on   rst

encountering  a  monster,  followed  by  a  short  description

of the creature: what it does, what it looks like, and what

is most noteworthy about it. Special sections describe how

the creature  ghts and give details on special attacks, special

qualities, skills, and feats.

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Refer to the glossary (start-

ing  on  page  208)  for  the  de nitions  of  common  features

and abilities of individual monsters. In most cases, a mon-

ster entry describes a typical individual of its kind, which

is the most common version encountered by characters on

adventures. Some of the monster entries, however, include

tougher  representatives (champions) of  their kind. Not

all monster entries include champions, although the rules

AMBUSH DRAKE

About  the  size  of  an  adult  human,  this  dragonlike  creature

bears distinctly lupine features in place of the more common

feline attributes of traditional dragons. Its jaw is elongated and

its build muscular, although its wings seem stunted for its size.

Most creatures perceive ambush drakes as deadly draconic

hunters  of  limited  intelligence.  However,  they  are  social

creatures among their own kind. Ambush drakes share the

classic  dragon  mentality  of  hoarding  treasure,  but  a  pack

doesnt believe in individual ownership. While one ambush

drake  might  use  an  item  at  any  given  moment,  the  pack

owns  the  treasure,  and  tomorrow  another  ambush  drake

might use it.

An ambush drake prefers to move about on all fours, only

using its undersized wings when necessary.

An ambush drake typically weighs 200 pounds and has

a 5-foot-long body. Its scales display dark shades of gray

or black.

Ambush  drakes  can  speak  Common  and  Draconic,

but  rarely  choose  to  do  so.  Instead,  they  communicate

telepathically with their kind.

COMBAT

Ambush  drakes  generally  stalk  their  prey  as  a  coordi-

nated  pack.  They  start  by  using  their  breath  weapons

and focus attacks on affected creatures, ignoring quicker

fleeing prey.

Breath Weapon (Su): 30-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds,

slow (duration 7 rounds), Will DC 17 negates. Ambush drakes

are immune to the breath weapons of other ambush drakes.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and second-

ary damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Telepathic  Link  (Ex):  Ambush  drakes  share  a  com-

munal  consciousness,  enabling  them  to  communicate

telepathically  with  other  ambush  drakes.  A  group  of

ambush drakes within 30 feet of each other are in con-

stant contact. If one is aware of a particular danger, they

all are. If one in the group is not flat-footed, none of them

are. No ambush drake in the group is considered flanked

unless all are.

Skills:  Ambush  drakes  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide

checks.

The  creature  resembles  a  fluid  mass  of  green  protoplasm.

Within  its  immense  bulk,  glowing  veins  throb  and  pulse  with

Created in ancient times, arcane oozes have long since

outlived their original purpose and their long-forgotten

creators.  The  bizarre  creatures  have  a  strange  affinity

for arcane magic. Immune to most arcane magic, arcane

oozes drain arcane energy from nearby spellcasters. Some

speculate that these oozes were created to combat a rival

group  of  arcane  spellcasters,  but  scant  evidence  backs

any  such  conclusion.  Others  suggest  arcane  oozes  arose

as a natural response to some cataclysmic event caused by

arcane magic. Adherents of these later theories claim that

one day arcane oozes will drown out all arcane magic in

the world.

An arcane ooze measures 15 feet across and 3 feet thick.

It weighs as much as 20,000 pounds.

COMBAT

An  arcane  ooze  attacks  by  grabbing  and  squeezing  its

prey. It moves instinctively toward the nearest creature

capable of casting arcane spells. It can only detect such

creatures  (or  any  creature)  if  they  are  within  60  feet.

If  attacked  by  creatures  that  it  cannot  detect  (because

they  are  too  far  away),  the  ooze  instinctively  retreats.

An  arcane  ooze  can  travel  easily  on  vertical  surfaces,

and it lurks on such surfaces, attempting to catch prey

by surprise.

Acid (Ex): An arcane ooze secretes a digestive acid that

dissolves only  esh. Any successful hit in melee combat or

a constrict attack by the creature deals an extra 2d6 points

of acid damage.

Constrict (Ex): An arcane ooze deals auto-

matic  slam  damage  and  acid  damage  with  a

successful grapple check.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To

use  this  ability,  an  arcane

ooze must hit with its slam

attack.  It  can  then  at-

tempt  to  start  a  grapple

as  a  free  action  without

provoking  attacks  of  oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple

check,  it  establishes  a  hold

and can constrict.

Spell  Siphon  (Su):  An

arcane  ooze  exerts  a  strange  pull

on  arcane  spell  energy.  Any  time

an  arcane  spellcaster  begins  his  turn

within 60 feet of an arcane ooze, he must make

a  DC  25  Fortitude  save  or  lose  a  random  spell  of  the

highest spell level that he has available. For every spell lost

by a victim in this manner, the arcane ooze gains tempo-

rary hit points equal to 5  the level of the lost spell. These

temporary hit points are lost after 1 hour.

Line of effect between the spellcaster and the arcane ooze

is necessary in order for this ability to work. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Immunity  to  Magic  (Ex):  An  arcane  ooze  is  immune

to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently

against the creature, as noted below.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage increases

an arcane oozes speed as if it had been affected by the haste

spell for 3 rounds.

A magical attack that deals acid damage heals an arcane

ooze of an amount of damage equal to half the acid damage

that the spell would normally have caused.

Skills:  An  arcane  ooze  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check,

even if rushed or threatened.

ARCANE OOZES IN EBERRON

Arcane oozes are found in places where arcane spellcasters

dwell, or in abandoned demesnes where wizards once held

sway. They are encountered with alarming regularity in the

depths of Sharn, the City of Towers.

ARMAND

This short, solidly built humanoid with thick, plated skin seems

as patient as a stone. Its stance lends it stability.

Armands are nomadic humanoids who wander the desert

in search of new experiences. They operate as a democratic

unit with all adult armands able to voice and vote in coun-

cil.  They  dont  believe  in  individual  ownership  and

share all possessions and resources among other

armands.  Their  philosophy  scorns  wealth

because of its transitory nature. Of in nitely

greater  value  are  experiences,  and  those

armands who have traveled, adventured,

and returned to the tribe are deemed

wise ones whose advice carries the

most weight. Thus, many young adult

armands leave their families and seek

to see more of the world.

A typical armand stands 3-1/2 to

4 feet tall and weighs roughly 150

pounds.

Armands speak Common and

their own language, Armandish.

COMBAT

An armand prefers to avoid combat.

It  enjoys  living  and  treasures

new  experiences.  An  armand

rarely starts a con ict because

combat  too  often  causes  an

untimely  end  and  deprives

the  armand  or  its  foe  of

the pleasures of life. How-

ever, it will certainly  ght

if attacked.

Defensive  Stance  (Ex):

When it needs to, an armand can become a stalwart

bastion of defense. As a move action, an armand can take a

defensive stance, gaining phenomenal precision and dura-

bility, but it cannot move while in this stance. The creature

gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, a +2 resistance bonus on all

saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC until it moves.

The following changes are in effect as long as the defen-

sive stance lasts: AC 22, touch 18,  at-footed 15; Base Atk +5;

Grp +1; Atk claw +11 melee (1d4); Full Atk 2 claws +11 melee

(1d4); SV Fort +6, Ref +9, Will +6.

Stability (Ex): Armands are exceptionally stable on their

feet. They gain a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist

being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground

or burrowing (but not when climbing,  ying, riding, or

otherwise not standing  rmly on the ground).

Skills:  Armands  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Survival

checks.

The  armand  warden  presented  here  had  the  following

ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice abil-

ity score increases: Str 14, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 15,

Cha 8.

Combat

An  armand  warden   ghts   ercely  to  defend  itself  or  any

other armand.

Defensive Stance: The statistics for an armand

warden  in  a  defensive  stance  are  adjusted  to

account for its elite ability score array and its

monk levels.

The  following  changes  are  in  effect

until  the  warden  moves:  AC  28,  touch

22,  flat-footed  20;  Base  Atk/Grp  +8/+10;

Atk  unarmed  +15  melee  (1d6+2);  Full  Atk

unarmed +15/+10 melee (1d6+2) or  urry

of  blows  +13/+13/+8  melee  (1d6+2);

SV Fort +11, Ref +14, Will +13 (+15

against enchantment).

Evasion (Ex): If the armand

warden is exposed to any effect

that normally allows it to attempt

a  Re ex  saving  throw  for  half

damage,  it  takes  no  damage  with  a

successful saving throw.

Slow  Fall  (Ex):  An  armand

warden  within  arms  reach  of

a  wall  can  use  it  to  slow  its

descent  while  falling.  The

armand  warden  takes  dam-

age as if the fall were 20 feet

shorter than it actually is.

Still  Mind  (Ex):  +2  bonus

on  saves  against  spells  and  effects  of  the

enchantment school.

Possessions: Bracers of armor +2, potion of cure moderate

Armand

wounds (2), potion of spider climb.

ARMAND SOCIETY

An armand tribe usually consists of several small, closely

knit family groups that come together to share resources.

When faced with a deadly common foe, many tribes will

converge on a defensible location to make their stand.

Tribes  look  to  the  wardens  for  leadership,  and  a  single

tribe may have several wardens leading it. The armands

rarely  build  permanent  dwellings.  They  live  in  large

communal tents or take advantage of ready shelter, such

as caves.

Armands  worship  Fharlanghn,  Obad-Hai,  or  Pelor  (or

other deities whose portfolios include travel, nature, and

the sun).

ARMANDS AS CHARACTERS

Armand characters possess the following racial traits.

 +6 Dexterity, +6 Constitution.

Small  size.  +1  bonus  to  Armor  Class,  +1  bonus  on

attack  rolls,  +4  bonus  on  Hide  checks,  4  penalty  on

ARMAND WARDEN

Armand leaders arise from those who have traveled widely

and experienced much. It is the duty of an armand warden

to return to the tribe and lend its wisdom to the group.

ARMANDS IN EBERRON

Armands inhabit the desert of Menechtarun, on the conti-

nent of Xendrik. They enjoy civil relations with the sand

giants of the Golden Sargasso and trade with them often.

They also do business with various goatfolk and orc tribes

in  the  Fangs  of  Argarak,  a  mountain  chain  east  of  the

desert. A tribe of armands will typically build a caravan-

serai  around  or  near  a  desert  oasis  and  open  its  gates  to

traders, adventurers, and other peaceful visitors.

ARMANDS IN FAERN

Millennia  ago,  armands  wandered  freely  across  the

deserts  of  Anauroch,  maintaining  a  large  monastery

and trading post on the slopes of Azrrhat. However, the

Empire  of  Shadows  destroyed  the  armand  monastery,

and  the  few  armand  tribes  that  survived  were  driven

south  of  the  Scimitar  Spires,  into  the  Saiyaddar.  There,

a ravenous blue dragon named Jyrrathazur enslaved the

armands,  devouring  entire  clans  that  refused  to  pledge

fealty. One day the dragon disappeared from Anauroch,

and armand nomads have wandered the Saiyaddar as free

folk ever since.

Level Adjustment: +6

The creature looks like

a muscular humanoid

with  thick  black-green

skin. Its demonic visage

is  reminiscent  of  a

skeletal  human  with

a  prominent  jaw.  Its

hands  end  in  large,

wickedly sharp claws.

Astral  stalkers  roam

the  multiverse  look-

ing  for  the  ultimate

quarry. They live for the

thrill of the hunt, and they measure their

personal worth and status in their community by

the number and power of the creatures that they

have successfully hunted.

These able hunters prefer to stalk intelligent foes, and the

pleasure they gain from hunting these creatures for sport

makes  them  evil  by  the  standards  of  any  race.  However,

astral stalkers adhere to a short list of tenets that they refer

to as the Rules of the Hunt: Once its quarry has knowingly

eluded an astral stalker, it will never again hunt that crea-

ture; if hired to hunt a creature, the stalker will not hunt its

Astral stalker

12

employer for at least one year; and no astral stalker will ever

hunt another astral stalker.

Astral stalkers  nd that their prey provides better sport if

it knows it is being hunted, so they often warn their quarry

in some roundabout fashion before beginning the hunt.

An astral stalker typically stands 6 feet tall and weighs

275 pounds.

Astral stalkers speak Common and Infernal.

COMBAT

Astral stalkers regard all other creatures as potential prey.

Although they seek to test themselves against stronger and

stronger prey, astral stalkers are neither stupid nor foolhardy,

and rarely engage in combat without  rst preparing the hunt-

ing ground and sizing up their foes. They favor ambushes

designed to weaken the prey before bringing it down.

Poison (Ex): Injury; Fortitude DC 22; initial damage

paralysis 1d4 rounds; secondary damage none. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Sneak Attack (Ex): An astral stalker can make a sneak

attack like a rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage

whenever a foe is denied its Dexterity bonus or when the

astral stalker is  anking.

Throat Dart (Ex): An astral stalkers throat dart has a

range of 150 feet with no range increment.

Camou  age (Ex): An astral stalker can use

the  Hide  skill  in  any  sort  of  natural  terrain,

even if the terrain does not grant cover

or concealment.

Elusive  Prey  (Ex):  An  as-

tral  stalker  is  difficult  to

track. Anyone trying to track

one  takes  a  10  penalty  on

Survival checks.

Evasion (Ex): An as-

tral  stalker  can  avoid

even  magical  and  un-

usual attacks with great

agility.  If  it  makes  a

successful Re ex sav-

ing  throw  against  an

attack  that  normally

deals half damage on a suc-

cessful  save,  it  instead  takes

no damage.

Swift Tracker (Ex): An astral

stalker  can  move  at  its  normal

speed  while  following  tracks

without  taking  the  normal  5

penalty. It takes only a 10 penalty

(instead of the normal 20 penalty) when moving

at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

Unearthly  Grace  (Su):  An  astral  stalker  adds  its  Cha-

risma modi er as a bonus on all its saving throws and as a

de ection bonus to its Armor Class.

Skills: An astral stalker has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

Level Adjustment: 

A large boulder on the rocky slope above

you  extends  a  long  tendril  with  a  single  eye.  The

boulder  suddenly  moves,  sending  a  torrent  of  rock

and debris toward you.

Avalanchers  are  bizarre  and  dangerous  creatures  that  live

along  the  rocky  slopes  of  tall  mountains.  They  are  scav-

engers  that  use  their  ability  to  cause  avalanches  to  bury

potential prey, allowing them to feast at their leisure. While

dangerous  to  hunt,  avalanchers  are  prized  by  mountain-

dwelling races as a prime source of meat, although killing

an avalancher is a mighty chore. Some races even herd

avalanchers by keeping them penned on plains where their

fearsome abilities pose little threat.

To the casual viewer, an avalancher resembles a large boul-

der of the same coloration and texture as the surrounding

terrain. Occasionally, it will stretch out its single eye that

sits on the end of a tough tendril to scout the landscape. An

avalancher spends most of its time immobile but can move

with startling speed on spindly, crablike legs.

An  avalancher  is  6  feet  tall  and  weighs  400  pounds.

Avalanchers speak rudimentary Terran.

COMBAT

While not particularly bright, avalanchers possess a deep

cunning and use their intimate knowledge of mountain-

ous terrain to their advantage. An avalanchers preferred

tactic is to hide on a rocky slope above a game trail or oth-

er path, using its cause avalanche ability to send a torrent

of rocks down on its prey. It also bull rushes opponents,

knocking  them  off  cliffs  to  their  deaths  on  the  rocky

crags  below.  It  will  use  its  transmute  rock  to  mud

ability  against  opponents  that  would  not

other wise  be  affected  by  a  sliding

avalanche.  If  losing  a  combat,  an

avalancher will trigger its cause

avalanche ability and ride the

rocks  down  to  safetybeing

immune to bludgeoning dam-

age,  it  is  not  harmed  using

this tactic.

Cause Avalanche (Su):

Three times per day, an ava-

lancher  can  let  loose  a  low,

rumbling  noise  that  causes

avalanches.  This  avalanche

originates  within  30  feet  of

the  avalancher  and  must

take place on terrain that has

both loose rock and a signi -

cant slope (DMs discretion).

The avalanche moves down a

45-degree slope at a speed of 30

feet per round (slower on a gen-

tler slope, faster on a steeper one).

It  spreads  outward  in  a  cone,  deal-

ing  2d6  points  of  damage  to  anyone

caught  in  its  path  (DC  15  Re ex  half).

Creatures that fail this save must make

a DC 20 Re ex save or become buried beneath

the  rocks.  Buried  characters  take  1d6  points  of

nonlethal damage per minute. If a buried character

falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15

Constitution  check  or  take  1d6  points  of  lethal  damage

every minute thereafter until freed or dead.

Transmute Rock to Mud (Sp): Once per day, an ava-

lancher can use transmute rock to mud as the spell. Caster

level 9th.

All-Around Vision (Ex): An avalancher is exceptionally

alert and circumspect, giving it a +4 racial bonus on Spot

checks and Search checks. An avalancher cant be  anked.

Skills:  An  avalancher  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even  if  rushed  or  threatened.  *An  avalancher  gains  a  +4

racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks  when  in  areas  of  rocky  or

mountainous terrain.

Avalancher

AVALANCHERS IN EBERRON

Avalanchers are most commonly encountered in the moun-

tains  northwest  of  the  Eldeen  Reaches,  although  larger

specimens are known to dwell in the Mror Holds.

This  six-legged  lionlike  creature  has  a  body  made  of  writh-

ing vines and thorns. Each of its gorillalike pairs of limbs is

slightly shorter than the pair in front of itits forelimbs are

the longest, the middle pair of limbs slightly shorter, and its

rear pair of legs the shortest of all. Long thorns protrude from

every part of the creatures body, making it seem impossible

to  approach  or  move  around  the  creature  without  risking

serious injury.

Plants magically engineered to serve as massive living siege

engines, battlebriars on a  eld of battle can easily destroy

massed  formations  of  lesser  troops.  Although  created  for

war, battlebriars have long since escaped the control of their

creators, and they now roam through forest and  eld alike. A

single battlebriar is capable of destroying a small town, and

for this reason it is an event of major importance when one

is seen near a settlement of any size.

Battlebriars  possess  a  rudimentary  intelligence  but  no

capacity for speech. On the few times that druids and spell-

casters of similar skill have been able to communicate with

them,  battlebriars  have  proven  intractable  and  uncaring.

A  few  powerful  evil  druids  have  been  able  to   nd  magi-

cal means of controlling battlebriars, and these controlled

beasts make fearsome guardians.

A battlebriar walks about on all six of its limbs, but when

 ghting,  it  stands  on  only  one  set  of  legs,  swinging  both

pairs of its huge forelimbs wildly. A battlebriar is almost as

broad as it is tall, and compared to a humanoid of similar

size, is quite squat and stocky.

Battlebriars  have  a  tough,  rubbery  hide  the  color  of

drying  mud,  although  some  of  the  vinelike  strands  that

run through its body are greenish in color. A massive plant,

one can grow up to 15 feet in length and weigh as much as

18,000 pounds.

Battlebriars  do  not  speak,  but  they  understand  simple

words and phrases in Sylvan.

COMBAT

A battlebriar is neither smart enough nor inventive enough

to give much thought to tactics. It moves toward its foes

with  ponderous  steps,  launching  volleys  of  thorns  if  its

foes  are  too  mobile  to  catch.  Although  slow-thinking

by  human  standards,  a  battlebriar  is  at  least  perceptive

enough to use its various attack forms to its best advantage,

trampling large groups of smaller foes, using its volleys of

thorns  against   eeing  enemies,  and  moving  close  to  foes

who  engage  in  melee  combat  so  as  to  expose  them  to  its

deadly thorns. More by accident than strategy, battlebriars

have  developed  one   ghting  technique  that  is  extremely

effective against Medium and smaller foes. A battlebriar

moves up to its foe and uses its Awesome Blow feat, earning

a free attack of opportunity against its foe if the feat is suc-

cessful  because  the  affected  creature  is  pushed  through  a

battlebriars threatened area.

Impale (Ex): Whenever a battle briar successfully starts

a  grapple  with  a  Medium  or  smaller  creature,  there  is  a

chance  that  the  creature  will  become  impaled  on  one  of

the thorns. After the grapple has begun, a battlebriar can

attempt another grapple check as a free action to impale the

creature on its thorns.

An  impaled  creature  is  helpless  until  it  beats  the  bat-

tlebriar in an opposed grapple check. As long as the only

creatures that it is grappling with are impaled, a battlebriar

is not considered grappled (the battlebriar does not lose its

Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its

remaining attacks against other opponents). When making

grapple checks against impaled creatures, a battlebriar takes

a 20 penalty on grapple checks.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a battlebriar must

hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Thorn  Volley  (Ex):  Battlebriars  grow  and  shed  their

thorns at an incredible rate, and by rearing up on their hind

legs and snapping their bodies forward, they can launch a

deadly volley. As a standard action, a battlebriar can launch

a volley of thorns, centering the volley anywhere within 60

feet. The thorns deal 8d6 points of piercing damage to all

creatures within a 10-foot radius (Re ex DC 33 half). The

save DC is Strength-based.

Trample  (Ex):  Re ex  half  DC  33.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Thorn  Field  (Ex):  The  thorns  on  a  battlebriars  body

protrude  into  the  area  surrounding  the  creature,  causing

several effects on creatures moving through a battlebriars

threatened area. A battlebriar can make up to four attacks

of  opportunity  each  round.  (Unlike  the  Combat  Re exes

feat, this ability does not allow a battlebriar to make attacks

area or through the squares that it occupies increases by

a battlebriar cannot freely move through the area that a

battle briar occupies.

BATTLEBRIARS IN EBERRON

During the Last War, the druidic defenders of the Eldeen

Reaches  used  battle briars  to  discourage  humanoid  incur-

sions into their territory. Their plan back red, however, as

militant druids from neighboring Aundair and Droaam used

magic to seize control of several dozen Eldeen battle  briars,

pulling them into their nations respective armies. Though

few in number, battle briars continue to serve as living siege

engines throughout the western part of Khorvaire.

A  large  bear  with  the  strong,

sharp teeth of a wolf looks at you.

It  has  a  thick  neck  and  a  long,

heavy tail.

COMBAT

A bearhound typically attacks in response to a threat. It will

focus on attacking one opponent at a time. When that oppo-

nent is dead, it will move on to another foe.

Enchanted Natural Weapons (Su): A bearhound gains

a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls with all

its natural weapons.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bearhound

must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start

a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks  of

opportunity.

Trip (Ex): A bearhound that hits with a bite attack can

attempt to trip its opponent (+12 check modi er) as a free

action without having to make a touch attack or provok-

ing  attacks  of  opportunity.  If  the  attempt

fails,  the  opponent  cannot  react  to  trip

the bearhound.

Trackless  Step  (Ex):  A  bear-

hound leaves no trail in natural sur-

roundings and cannot be tracked.

It  can  choose  to  leave  a  trail  if

so desired.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A bear-

hound  can  improve  the  attitude

of  an  animal.  This  ability  func-

tions  like  a  Diplomacy  check  to

improve the attitude of a person.

The  bearhound  rolls  1d20  and

adds +11 to determine the wild

empathy  check  result.  The

typical domestic animal has a

starting  attitude  of  indiffer-

ent,  while  wild  animals  are

usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the

bearhound  and  the  animal

must  be  able  to  study  each

other,  which  means  that

they must be within 30 feet

of one another under nor-

mal  visibility  conditions.

Generally,  in uencing  an

animal  in  this  way  takes  1

minute, but as with in uenc-

Bearhound

Bearhounds  are  intelligent,  masterful  hunters.  Usually

loners that value their privacy and keep to the woodlands,

they  will  sometimes  associate  with  good  creatures  for  a

righteous cause.

Many laugh at the mention of the elusive bearhound.

Some  call  it  a  myth,  an  animal  invented  by  inebriated

hunters. Few sightings of a bearhound come from repu-

table sources.

A typical bearhound stands 6-1/2 feet tall at the shoulder

when on all fours. It weighs as much as 2,000 pounds.

Bearhounds speak Common and Sylvan.

ing people, it might take more or less time.

A bearhound can also use this ability to in uence a magi-

cal beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but it takes a

4 penalty on the check.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a bearhound is up

to 1,038 pounds; a medium load, 1,0392,079 pounds; and a

heavy load, 2,0803,120 pounds.

BEARHOUNDS IN EBERRON

Bearhounds  are  most  commonly  found  in  the  temperate

forests  of  the  Eldeen  Reaches,  although  agents  of  House

Vadalis have also taken to enlisting the services of the beasts

as guardians and mounts, for wealthy nobles and merchants

throughout central Khorvaire.

Worse, the slender, knife-sharp claws

contract and extend in length from

moment  to  moment,  sometimes

instantly reaching a length of 10 or

more feet, before slowly contracting.

Boneclaws  are  bloodthirsty

undead  that  enjoy  using  their

extendable claws to bring death

to the living. The lore of the dead

does not reveal from what dark necromancers laboratory or

fell nether plane boneclaws entered the world. Perhaps they

merely evolved from lesser forms.

The boneclaw is an intelligent skeletal undead that pos-

sesses  exceptional  control  over  the  length  of  its  claws.  At

will, a boneclaw can extend one or two of its  nger-claws

out to a distance of 20 feet, neatly skewering  eshy creatures

Boneclaws speak Common and Abyssal.

COMBAT

A boneclaw likes to get the drop on its enemies, espe-

cially when its foes are still at range, surprising them

with  an  attack  of  opportunity  by  extending  its  claws

as  its  enemies  close  to  melee  range.  With  its  Combat

Ref lexes, this can occur often within the same

fight.

A  boneclaw  normally  attacks  using  its

Power  Attack  feat,  taking  a  2  pen-

alty on its attack rolls and

gaining a +2 bonus on

damage rolls.

Reaching  Claws  (Ex):  A

bone claw  can  make  melee

attacks  with  its  bone

claws, instantly extend-

ing  them  as  part  of  an

attack  to  a  distance  of  up  to  20

feet (thereby allowing the bone-

claw to threaten more squares

than  even  its  Large  size

would otherwise indicate).

Unholy  Toughness

(Ex):  A  boneclaw  gains  a

bonus  to  its  hit  points

equal  to  its  Charisma

modi er  its Hit Dice.

BONECLAWS

IN EBERRON

Droaamite necromancers work-

ing  for  the  Daughters  of  Sora

Kell have learned how to trans-

form  ogre  magi  skeletons  into

boneclaws.  During  the  Last

War, spies from Karrnath failed

to steal the secrets of boneclaw

construction  from  a  cabal  of

necromancers  operating  with-

in  the  Great  Crag  (Droaams

capital).  Through  careful  nego-

tiation,  however,  Emerald  Claw

agents  have  succeeded  where  the

Karrns failed and have begun cre-

ating their own boneclaw killers.

BONECLAWS IN FAERN

Rumors persist that Szass Tam, the zulkir of necromancy in

Thay, created the  rst boneclaws to protect Thayan enclaves.

However, boneclaws have been encountered in the service

of  various  liches  and  necromancers  across  Faern.  Some

necromancers speak of a night hag who visits them in their

dark  dreams,  trading  the  secrets  of  boneclaw  creation  for

some gift to be named later.

This  gaunt  creature  is  humanoid

in  shape,  except  for  two  long,  writh-

ing,  pale  tentacles  that  sprout  from

beneath  its  arms.  Although  its

features  are  somewhat  goblinoid

in appearance, wicked talons cap

its  long,  spindly  f ingers,  and  its

wide  maw  opens  to  reveal  many

sharp  teeth,  including  six  6-inch-

long  fangs.  Its  hairless,  gray-

skinned  body  is  covered  in

oozing  sores  that  weep  a  pale

white fluid.

A  truly  repulsive  crea-

ture,  the  bonedrinker

hunts to feed on the bones

of its victims. Terrible undead created in a

horrid ritual reminiscent of mummy creation,

bonedrinkers wander the dark places of the world,

seeking  new  creatures  to  feed  upon.  Hobgoblin

wizards  originally  developed  the  ritual  to  create  these

monstrosities,  using  the  fallen  corpses  of  goblin  and

bugbear  warriors  to  create  the   rst  lesser  bonedrinkers

and  bonedrinkers.  The  tradition  of  using  bugbears  and

Bonedrinker

goblins became habit, and nearly all bonedrinkers previ-

ously lived as one of these two goblinoid races. In theory,

other humanoid creatures could be converted into bone-

drinkers,  but  this  would  require  twisting  and  adapting

the original ritual.

Bonedrinkers  resemble  ghasts  in  many  ways,  leading

those who catch only  eeting glimpses of the creatures to

erroneously pass on exactly that description. If it werent for

the two tentacles that grow beneath their arms and the six

horribly long fangs in their mouths, the description might

even  t.

A bonedrinkers body is covered in weeping sores, the

result  of  its  constant  need  to  feed.  The  longer  one  goes

without  liquefying  and  draining  a  creatures  bones,  the

more sores appear. This has no effect on the creatures abili-

ties, but a bonedrinker certainly grows more reckless and

desperate the hungrier it becomes.

Bonedrinkers  prey  on  any  creature

with  a  skeletal  structure.  They  care  noth-

ing  for  vermin,  elementals,  constructs,  or

any  other  creature  lacking  their  favorite

food.  Many  other  carnivores  similarly

eat  bones,  but  not  in  the  same  way  that

a bonedrinker does. Bonedrinkers secrete

a  strange  chemical  in  their  saliva  that

breaks down bones into a viscous liquid.

As the bones liquefy, the bonedrinker

slurps  them  up  through  wounds  it

in icts with its bite. In essence, a

bonedrinker  is  to  bones  what  a

vampire is to blood.

A bonedrinker stands about

7  feet  tall  and  weighs  roughly

225  pounds.  Created  from  a

bugbear,  it  super cially  re-

sembles  the  goblinoid  from

which it was created.

Bonedrinkers speak the

languages they knew in life,

typically Goblin, and that of

their creators, typically Gob-

lin and Common.

COMBAT

Clever  hunters,  bonedrinkers

prefer  to  attack  lone  victims

unless  hunting  in  packs.

They  typically  strike  from

hiding,  pouncing  on  their  cho-

sen  prey  and  attempting  to  establish  a

grapple  as  quickly  as  possible.  If  especially

famished,  a  bonedrinker  might  attack  more

recklessly, grappling a single victim even if part of a

group and attempting to drain it dry while ignoring

the victims companions.

Bonedrink  (Su):  Once  a  bonedrinker  has  successfully

grappled an opponent, it can begin to drink its bones. To

do  this,  the  bonedrinker  must  make  a  successful  grapple

check.  If  it  pins  its  foe,  it  fastens  onto  the  creature  with

its horrendous fangs. It then secretes a painful toxin into

the  victim  that  deals  1d6  points  of  Constitution  damage.

Each  round  the  pin  is  maintained,  the  bonedrinker  deals

an additional 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Creatures

reduced to 0 Constitution die, as the majority of their bones

become too brittle to support their bodies and they collapse

into a sack of loose  esh.

Creatures  without  bones  or  Constitution  scores  are

immune to the Constitution-damaging effects of the bone-

drink ability.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bonedrinker

must  hit  with  a  tentacle  attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and deals automatic claw or tentacle damage to the

grappled  victim.  It  can  deal  automatic  claw  or  tentacle

damage in each subsequent round that it maintains the

grapple, and a bonedrinker that has successfully pinned

an  opponent  can  begin  to  drink  its  bones  (see  Bone-

drink,  above).  Bonedrinkers  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

grapple checks.

Pounce (Ex): If a bonedrinker charges, it can make a full

attack in the same round.

Lesser bonedrinkers vaguely resemble the goblins from

which  they  spawned,  just  as  bonedrinkers  vaguely

resemble bugbears. However, just as with bonedrinkers,

no one confuses a lesser bonedrinker for a new species of

goblin. More so than any goblinoid, lesser bonedrinkers

resemble  their  larger  cousins,  with  the  same  gray  skin,

sharp  fangs,  tentacles,  and  oozing  sores  that  the  larger

breed possesses.

Lesser bonedrinkers result from applying the necroman-

tic bonedrinker ritual to goblins. These smaller specimens

stand about 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 35 pounds.

Combat

Lesser  bonedrinkers  lack  some  of  the  potent  physical

capabilities of the larger versions, and not just as a result

of their smaller size. They are less resilient to energy and

lack damage reduction. Not as pro cient at grappling as

their larger cousins and lacking the more potent defense

of  their  kin,  lesser  bonedrinkers  tend  to  rely  more  on

group tactics when possible. Although driven by ravenous

hunger, lesser bonedrinkers are canny enough to swarm

a  single  target  in  battle,  aiding  one  another  in  bringing

down a single foe.

Bonedrink  (Su):  This  ability  functions  exactly  as

described  above,  except  a  lesser  bonedrinkers  bonedrink

deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Unholy Toughness (Ex): A lesser bonedrinker gains a

bonus to its hit points equal to its Charisma modi er  its

Hit Dice.

Skills: Like their brethren (and the goblins from which

they  were  spawned),  lesser  bonedrinkers  have  a  +4  racial

bonus on Move Silently checks.

CREATING A BONEDRINKER

The ritual that turns a bugbear corpse into a bonedrinker

requires the create undead spell cast by a caster of 15th

level or higher with 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (reli-

gion).  Transforming  a  goblin  corpse  into  a  lesser  bone-

drinker is a similar but less exacting process, requiring

create undead cast by a caster of 12th level or higher with 7

or more ranks in Knowledge (religion). These rituals are

typically known only to hobgoblin wizards and clerics,

though the secret has undoubtedly spread to other races

over the years.

Unholy Toughness (Ex): A bonedrinker gains a bonus to

its hit points equal to its Charisma modi er  its Hit Dice.

Skills:  Bonedrinkers  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Move

Silently checks.

BONEDRINKERS IN EBERRON

The  legacy  of  Khorvaires  ancient  goblinoid  kingdoms

survives  as  a  series  of  ruins  spread  across  the  continental

heartland.  Beneath  these  ruins  lurk  undead  creatures

such as bonedrinkers. Many hobgoblin warlords and their

bodyguards became bonedrinkers as a result of unorthodox

burial rituals.

This  creature  looks  like  an  enormous  beetle  with  a  carapace

made of hundreds of leaf-shaped, chitinous plates. The creatures

black body gleams with iridescence like the shells of some insects,

but it has eyes like a cats. It is armed with long claws on each of

its legs, and large mandibles extend from its mouth.

Brood  keepers  are  terrifying  insectlike  creatures  with  the

glimmer of intelligence in their eyes. Like spider eaters, they

are solitary hunters and reproduce in a grisly manner.

Brood keepers are so named because they keep their young

in their backs, releasing them to feed or in times of stress.

Brood keeper larvae look very different from their parent, but

grow to resemble it over the course of many months.

Brood  keepers  are  asexual  and  releasing  their  larva

swarms  into  danger  is  a  part  of  their  reproductive  cycle.

Brood keeper larvae do not grow while they live with their

parent, and the adult is willing to but its offspring at risk.

A larva swarm taking damage and potentially dispersing

is  the  brood  keepers  means  of  ensuring  that  the  next

generation is strong.

Brood keepers are carnivores, viewing all other living crea-

tures as food. Hardy and powerful creatures, they fearlessly

assault prey of any size, including dragons and giants.

Few  nd peaceable relations with a brood keeper worth-

while  due  to  their  aggressive  and  foul-tempered  nature,

but some have found them useful as potent guardians for

small items by placing the objects inside the brood keepers

carapace pockets. A brood keeper averages 30 feet in length

and weighs some 12 tons.

Although intelligent enough to know a language, brood

keepers  do  not  speak  and  do  not  understand  a  language

unless one is taught to them.

COMBAT

A brood keeper charges and pounces on one foe, then claws

at another. It attacks each enemy it can reach with a charge

in  turn  and  releases  its  larva  swarm  to  attack  prey  that  is

farther away.

Fear (Su): A creature that witnesses a brood keeper rend

a  foe  or  release  its  larva  swarm  must  make  a  DC  20  Will

save  or  be  frightened  for  1d10  rounds  and  shaken  for  1

hour. Creatures that succeed on the save are shaken for 1d4

rounds and immune to that brood keepers fear effect for 24

hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a brood keeper

must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.

Larva Swarm (Ex): As a full-round action, a brood keeper

can  lift  the  plates  of  chitin  on  its  back,  releasing  a  brood

keeper larva swarm. The brood keeper larva swarm can act

immediately. Until its next action, the brood keeper takes a

5 penalty to Armor Class. Brood keepers are immune to a

brood keeper larva swarms distraction and swarm attacks.

A brood keeper can call its larva swarm back as a free action,

but it is a full-round action to accept them back into its cara-

pace, during which time the brood keeper takes a 5 penalty

to Armor Class. Releasing or accepting its larva swarm pro-

vokes attacks of opportunity.

A brood keeper can keep only one brood of larvae in its

back. Should the larva swarm be damaged so much that it dis-

perses, a brood keeper gives birth to another batch of larvae

in 1 month. If the brood keeper has not done so already, it

automatically releases its brood of larvae when it dies.

Pounce (Ex): When a brood keeper charges, it can make

a full attack, including four rake attacks.

Rake  (Ex):  Attack  bonus  +25  melee,  damage  1d8+3.  A

brood keeper rakes with all four back legs, granting it four

extra  claw  attacks  when  it  begins  a  round  in  a  grapple  or

when it pounces.

Rend (Ex): If a brood keeper hits with at a bite or claw

attack and at least one rake attack, it rips its foe apart. This

attack automatically deals 2d8+10 points of damage.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  the  brood  keeper  makes  a  successful

Re ex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half

damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage.

Level Adjustment: 

As you watch, the plates of chitin on the creatures back slowly

open, revealing mucus-filled cavities and the writhing forms of

giant maggots with wasp wings. Suddenly, dozens of the foot-

and-a-half-long winged larvae wriggle out of their pockets on the

beetle-creatures back and take to the air. Once they are freed from

the confines of the shell, you see that their pulpy white bodies are

ringed in brown chitin.

Brood keeper larvae do not grow while they live with their

brood  keeper  parent  but  they  enjoy  the  protection  the

swarm and their parent offer.

When  a  brood  keeper  larva  swarm  is  dispersed,  the

remaining  larvae   ee  in  every  direction.  An  individual

larva poses little threat, and only one or two survive the

dangers of the wild to become full-grown brood keepers.

Each winged maggot is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs

about 2 pounds.

Brood keeper larva swarms do not use language.

Combat

A brood keeper larva swarm seeks to please its parent when

released so that the brood keeper will allow it to return to

the chitin pockets in its shell. The swarm often focuses on

attacking  ying foes its parent cannot reach and other crea-

tures attacking from a distance.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to  a

brood  keeper  larva  swarms  damage  that  begins  its  turn

with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC

23 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even after a success-

ful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the

area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 +

spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentra-

tion requires a DC 20 Concentration check. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Evasion (Ex): If the brood keeper larva swarm makes a

successful Re ex saving throw against an attack that nor-

mally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes

no damage.

Level Adjustment: 

This massive, hunched creature built

of  stone  and  metal  looms  over

you. Its long, heavily plated arms

nearly  drag  on  the  ground

from  shoulders  flanking  a

f lat-featured, oblong head,

but  its  back  draws  your

eye.  Spikes  of  various

sizesall  barbed  and

covered  in  gore  dried

and  freshsprout  from

the  plates  of  metal  on  its

back. A few bodies remain

impaled  on  the  spikes,

their mouths open in silent

screams.

Cadaver  collectors  were  origi-

nally built to serve exactly

the  purpose  their  name

implies. Those with an in-

terest  in  collecting  the

dead  would  deploy  the

constructs to bring bodies

back  from  a  battlefield.

Corpses  gathered  in  this

fashion  are  often  used  by  gen-

erals  to  provide  information

on an enemys forces, as well as to

fuel  magical  or  medical  research.

Most  often,  though,  cadaver  collectors  were  dispatched

to gather bodies for the creation of undead. This activity

after a battle typically resulted in retaliation from either

or both sides, as few armies want to see their dead return

to walk the land in undeath.

In  times  of  peace,  cadaver  collectors  usually  sit  idle,

finding out-of-the-way locations near the site of their last

great  battle  to  wait  for  a  new  master  to  give  them  new

orders. Others find employment performing their grisly

task  for  masters  who  are  not  so  discriminating  about

where  corpses  are  collected.  Still  others  have  found,

through a certain perverse twist of logic, that if no battle

can  be  found,  they  can  find  ways  to  start  a  conflict  so

that  bodies  become  available  and  they  can  realize  their

purpose  once  more.  Some  have  just  ceased  to  function

correctly. With a lack of purpose, they are unable to dis-

tinguish between bodies living or dead, and collect each

indiscriminately.

A cadaver collector, even hunched over, stands about 12

feet tall and weighs about 4,000 pounds. They do not speak

but understand one language, usually Common, known to

their creator.

COMBAT

A  cadaver  collector  typically  begins  a  battle  with  its

breath weapon, then grabs any paralyzed opponents and

impales them on its spikes to die before turning to deal

with other foes. If enemies prove re-

silient to its breath, it doesnt hesitate

to snatch up and impale any enemy it

can reach.

Breath  Weapon  (Su):

30-foot  cone,  once  every

1d4 rounds, paralyzing gas, Re-

 ex DC 18 negates. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Impale  (Ex):  If  a  cadaver

collector  has  successfully  grap-

pled  a  Medium  or  smaller

creature, it can attempt to im-

pale  the  creature  on  its  back

spikes by making a successful

grapple  check.  Doing  so  is

a  standard  action  that  does

not provoke attacks of oppor-

tunity.  If  the  collector  suc-

cessfully impales a creature,

the  creature  takes  4d8+15

points of damage and is con-

sidered  pinned.  Each  round,

the creature takes another 2d8

points of damage as the move-

ment of the cadaver collector

causes additional pain to the

impaled creature.

Cadaver collector

The creature cannot break

free  unless  it  makes  a  DC  28

Strength check. Success indicates the creature

is free of the spike but takes an additional 2d8 points of

damage in the process. Failure means the creature takes

4d8  points  of  damage  and  remains  pinned  in  place.  An

ally  can  try  to  free  an  impaled  creature  with  a  DC  20

Strength check.

Once  a  cadaver  collector  has  a  creature  or  creatures

impaled on its back spikes, it is no longer considered to be in

a grapple and can attack other opponents without penalty.

It cannot use its slam attacks against impaled opponents.

Creatures that get free of a cadaver collector become its

immediate and most urgent targets. It typically pursues

such creatures exclusively if it has any chance of catching

and impaling them again.

A cadaver collectors back spikes can hold up to 4 Medium

creatures, 16 Small creatures, or 64 Tiny creatures. Creatures

smaller than Tiny are too miniscule to be impaled on the

collectors back spikes, although the collector can still deal

4d8+15  points  of  damage  to  such  opponents  by  grinding

them into its back spikes with a successful grapple check

once it has them grappled.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cadaver col-

lector  must  hit  with  a  slam  attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to

start  a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can attempt to impale the following round.

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  DC  28  half.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): Like golems, cadaver collec-

tors are especially resilient to magic. However, this resilience

takes a slightly different form in the cadaver collector.

A cadaver collector is immune to any spell or spell-like

ability  that  allows  spell  resistance.  In  addition,  spells  of

3rd level or lower that target a cadaver collector automati-

cally  rebound  back  at  their  caster  as  if  the  collector  were

under the effects of an unbeatable spell turning effect. This

effect  cannot  be  dispelled  or  suppressed,  except  against

spells that deal electricity damage (see below). Spells that

deal rust damage or alter stone penetrate the immunity to

magic. Other spells and effects function differently against

the creature, as noted below.

A magical attack that deals sonic damage slows a cadaver

collector  (as  the  slow  spell)  for  3  rounds,  with  no  saving

throw. Sonic spells of 3rd level or lower are absorbed by the

collector and not re ected.

A  magical  attack  that  deals  electricity  damage  is

absorbed rather than re ected. Such an attack breaks any

slow effect on the collector and heals 1d6 points of damage

for  every  6  points  of  damage  the  attack  would  otherwise

deal.  If  the  amount  of  healing  would  cause  the  collector

to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as

temporary hit points.

A cadaver collector is affected normally by rust attacks. In

addition, magical attacks that alter the nature of stone, such

as transmute rock to mud, deal 1d6 points of damage per spell

level to the cadaver collector.

CHANGELING

This peculiar humanoid has pale gray skin, thin hair, and blank

white eyes. You see hints of a nose and mouth, but its face is

bereft of expression. Its limbs are gangly and slightly mispropor-

tioned, although it moves gracefully.

Changelings are subtle shapeshifters capable of disguising

their appearance. They evolved through the union of dop-

pelgangers  and  humans,  eventually  becoming  a  separate

race  distinct  from  either  ancestral  tree.  Changelings  do

not possess the full shapechanging ability of doppelgang-

ers,  but  they  can  create  effective  disguises  at  will.  This

ability makes them consummate spies and criminals, and

many changelings live up to that potential.

In  general,  changelings  are  prudent  and  cautious,

preferring to take risks only when they feel that their

chances  are  good  or  the  payoff  is  worth  it.  They

appreciate the finer things in life and take great

pleasure in the comforts of a wealthy lifestyle

when they can obtain it. They avoid direct

confrontation, preferring stealthy strikes

and hasty retreats whenever possible. In

conversation,  they  are  soft-spoken  but

have  a  gift  for  drawing  out  more  infor-

mation than the other party usually plans

to reveal.

Changelings  strongly  resemble  their  dop-

pelganger  lineage,  with  only  a  passing  nod  to

their humanoid heritage. All changelings fall

within the boundaries of Medium size, usu-

ally standing between 5 and 6 feet tall. Un-

like  true  doppelgangers,  changelings

do  have  gender  in  their  natural

form, although they can adopt

any shape they like. They

speak  Common,  but

many changelings en-

joy  collecting  other

languages  to  expand

their  repertoire  of  disguises

and identities.

Humans and elves regard

changelings  with  suspicion.

Many,  however,  have  reason

to  do  business  with  them.  Dwarves  have  little

patience  for  their  deceptive  and  subtle  manner.

Gnomes and hal ings, on the other hand, enjoy matching

wits  with  changelings,  though  they  are  often  rivals  in

certain shady activities.

Changeling

CHANGELING SPY

Changeling spies have a penchant for shady dealings. Most

of them are rogues of low to middle level who work as deep-

cover spies for local guilds or secret benefactors. Changeling

spies rely on disguises, stealth, and honeyed words to con-

ceal their activities and true motives.

Combat

Changeling  spies  deal  in  information  and  avoid  combat

unless they have allies to support them. Some changeling

spies  use  their  natural  charisma  to  lead  small  gangs  of

cloaked changeling warriors, relying on their

minions  to  create   anking  opportunities

for sneak attacks.

Sneak Attack (Ex): An changeling

can  make  a  sneak  attack  like  a  rogue,

dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage

whenever a foe is denied its Dexter-

ity  bonus  or  when  the  changeling

is flanking.

CHANGELING SOCIETY

Changelings  do  not  build  cities  of  their

own, but live among humans, goblinoids,

or other races, blending in among them

and  living  in  their  shadow.  They  are

most  commonly  found  in  large  cities,

where they form the backbone of the crim-

inal underworld, though many find more re-

spectable work as entertainers, government

agents,  and  sometimes  adventurers.  Even

in  large  cities,  they  do  not  cluster  into

extremely  large  groups.  A  changeling

clan  is  actually  a  voluntary  associa-

tion of changelings grouped together for

mutual protection rather than a group

of blood relatives. Clan heads govern by

the  consent  of  the  clan,  and  this  posi-

tion  tends  to  change  hands  frequently.

Bosses maintain order and help organize

the clan for common purposes.

A changeling clan includes

30% noncombatants, primarily

children and the elderly, who

are  usually  the  primary  reason  for  the  clans

existence.  Changelings  without  dependents

generally  find  little  reason  to  associate  with  a  clan

and  operate  alone  or  in  smaller  gangs  organized  by  a

charismatic leader.

Many changelings revere the deity known as the Trav-

eler.  Many  others  follow  a  personal  philosophy  of  the

perfect form, in which physical transformation is a spiri-

tual  practice  symbolizing  puri cation.  This  philosophy

is  curiously  amoral,  and  its  practitioners  include  both

assassins and saintly ascetics.

COMBAT

Changelings are reluctant  ghters, preferring to intimidate

or bluff their opponents. When forced to  ght, they  ght

defensively  while  assessing  their  chances  of  winning  the

 ght. Changelings are not above running when they  nd

CHANGELINGS AS CHARACTERS

Changeling characters possess the following racial traits.

Medium size.

Changeling base land speed is 30 feet.

  +2  racial  bonus  on  saving  throws  against sleep and

charm effects.

 +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense Motive

checks.

Natural Linguist: Changelings add Speak Language to

their list of class skills for any class they adopt.

Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages:

Auran,  Dwarven,  Elven,  Giant,  Gnome,  Halfling,  and

Terran.

Favored Class: Rogue.

Minor  Change  Shape  (Su):  Changelings  have  the

supernatural  ability  to  alter  their  appearance  as  though

using a disguise self spell that affects their bodies but not

their possessions. This is not an illusory effect but a minor

physical alteration of a changelings facial features, skin

color  and  texture,  and  size,  within  the  limits  described

for  the  spell.  A  changeling  can  use  this  ability  at  will,

and the alteration lasts until she changes shape again. A

changeling reverts to her natural form when killed. A true

seeing spell reveals her natural form. Using this ability is a

full-round action.

Skills: *When using its minor change shape ability, a

changeling  gets  a  +10  circumstance  bonus  on  Disguise

checks.

The  hound-shaped  creature  stands  at  least  20  feet  at  the

shoulder. Closer scrutiny reveals that while the creature has the

outward shape of a hound, its form is composed of the bodies of

hundreds of rotting humanoid corpses.

Charnel  hounds  are  a  stunning  achieve-

ment  of  some  crazed  necromancer  or  god

of  death.  Their  very  presence  is  a  procla-

mation  of  necromantic  power.  The  way

in  which  the  bodies  making  up  a  char-

nel  hounds  form  sometimes  scream,

mutter,  and  jerk  serves  to  horrify  and

frighten onlookers.

Charnel  hounds,  once  created,  are

self-sufficient  engines  of  undead  de-

struction found at night roaming plains

where battles have been fought, or loose

in  underground  areas  large  enough  to

accommodate  their  bulk.  Dur-

ing the day, they dig themselves

great burrows to escape the sun.

When  clerics  or  necromancers

are  powerful  enough  to  command

a charnel hound, it is often

used as a guardian.

A charnel hound is about

20 feet tall and weighs

about 35,000 pounds.

COMBAT

A charnel hound savages any living creatures it encounters.

When it overcomes its foes (especially humanoids) it imme-

diately integrates the foe into its own body, even if the foe

is not quite dead yet.

A charnel hound uses its Power Attack feat to normally

attack  with  a  5  penalty  on  its  attack  rolls,  gaining  a  +5

bonus on damage rolls.

Body  Integration  (Su):  Whenever  a  charnel  hound

reduces  a  living  humanoid  foe  of  Large  size  or  smaller  to

negative hit points, the foe must immediately make a DC 24

Fortitude saving throw. On a failed save, the victims body

is instantly absorbed into the form of the charnel hound,

healing the charnel hound of points of damage equal to 3

 Hit Dice of the victim. This effect kills the victim, and

makes  it  dif cult  for  his  companions  to  recover  his  body

or equipment unless the charnel hound is defeated and the

proper body pulled from the pile of resultant corpses. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Rend  (Ex):  A  charnel  hound  that  hits  with  both  claw

attacks latches onto the opponents body and tears its  esh.

This automatically deals an extra 4d6+21 points of damage.

Aversion to Daylight (Ex): Charnel hounds loathe day-

light. If exposed to natural daylight (not merely a daylight

spell), a charnel hound takes a 4 penalty on all attack rolls,

saving throws, and skill checks.

Frightful Presence (Su): A charnel hound can inspire

terror  by  charging  or  attacking.  Affected  creatures  must

succeed on a DC 24 Will save or become shaken, remaining

in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the

charnel hound. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Unholy Toughness (Ex): A charnel

hound gains a bonus to its hit points

equal to its Charisma modifier   its

Hit Dice.

another  part  of  town.  Infestations  are  often  mistaken  for

the work of a vampire, but holy water and garlic is of no use

against the cheliceras.

A chelicera is mostly long legs and arms, standing 4 feet

tall and about 5 feet in diameter even though its body is

only about the size of a full backpack. It weighs no more

than 50 pounds.

COMBAT

Cheliceras always attempt to ambush their foe, leaping from

the shadows when they lure a creature to their nest. As they

cannot truly gauge the odds of success, they always spring to

the attack even if a large group enters, subsequently  eeing

if the battle turns against them.

Blood Drain (Ex): A chelicera can suck

the  blood  from  a  living  creature

by  making  a  successful  grapple

check. If it pins the foe, it drains

blood,  dealing  1d4  Constitution

drain each round that it makes a

successful grapple check.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):

To use this ability, a chelic-

era must hit with a claw at-

tack.  It  can  then  attempt

to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking

attacks  of  opportunity.  If

it  wins  the  grapple  check,

A  chelicera  has  a  +4  racial  bo-

its Dexterity modi er instead of its

Strength modi er when grappling.

Mimicry  (Ex):  A  chelicera  can

repeat  any  noise  it  hears  as  a  free  ac-

tion. This ability works much like ghost

sound (Will DC 17 disbelief), except that

the sound is always centered on the che-

licera itself. The creatures favorite tactic is

to reproduce garbled or faint speech, causing

the potential prey to move closer for a better listen.

Chelicera

The chelicera is a spidery creature that can

reproduce  any  sound  it  hears.  Cheliceras  are  a

common problem in towns and cities built in warm

climates, where the vermin tend to live in neighborhoods

with poor sanitation.

A  chelicera  can  remember  and  duplicate  sounds.  It

has no understanding of speech, but can duplicate many

of the component sounds. The creature tests each sound

it  knows,  looking  for  those  that  most  reliably  draw

prey. Often, the most useful sounds are the screams of a

previous victim.

From their hidden lairs, they lure victims to their doom

by reproducing the sounds they hear. Warriors of noble

intent rush into a cheliceras lair to rescue an innocent, only

to discover that it is they who need rescuing. Once someone

Skills: Cheliceras have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks

and Listen checks. A chelicera also has a +8 racial bonus on

Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb

CHELICERAS IN EBERRON

Cheliceras  prowl  the  Howling  Peaks,  north  of  Zilargo,

where they feed on mountain lions, humanoids, and other

weaker predators. Their natural enemies include wyverns,

chimeras, and manticores.

An  8-foot-tall,  powerful  being

seemingly  constructed  of  magi-

cal  ice  confronts  you.  Jagged

spurs  and  spines  form  icy

ridges  along  its  blue-black,

humanoid-shaped  body,  and

cold  blue  light  leaks  from

eyes,  mouth,  and  joints  of

its  glistening  black  icy  form.

Its  long,  muscled  arms  end  in

sharp  talons,  and  its  mouth

opens to reveal rows of wickedly

sharp teeth.

When  a  particularly  evil

and  hateful  being  perishes

on either the Elemental Plane

of Air or the Elemental Plane of

Water, its life force is sometimes

captured by the planar powers and

coalesced into a chraal. The chraal

retains no knowledge of its past life and exists

as a radiant cloud of cold energy trapped inside a monstrous

shell of hard, bluish-black ice.

Some  spellcasters  who  specialize  in  summoning  and

controlling extraplanar servants bind chraals to them once

they learn of the elementals existence. The chraals enjoy

such  excursions  from  their  home  plane,  relishing  any

chance to in ict harm on the living. A chraal summoned

Chraal

and  bound  to  a  spellcasters  service  that  is  not  given  the

opportunity to hunt and kill invariably tries to turn against

its summoner.

Chraals are solitary creatures and do not intermingle or

procreate.  They  do  not  generally  attack  one  another  and

will sometimes combine their strength to defeat a common

enemy before going their separate ways.

A chraal stands 8 feet tall. Its head rests atop two broad

shoulders, and its thick arms end in wicked claws strong

enough  to  crush  stone.  A  chraal  weighs  between  1,000

and 2,000 pounds.

Chraals cannot speak or communicate in any way, but

they have rudimentary intelligence and can be command-

ed to follow orders under the proper circumstances.

COMBAT

A  chraal  is  a  ruthless  killer,  relishing  the  shed  blood  of

its enemies. It rarely retreats from a  ght, attacking until

it or its opponent is slain. A chraal nearly always begins a

battle with its breath weapon. It focuses its attacks on any

creature that exhibits signs that it might have  re (magic or

otherwise) at its disposal. A chraal is too impatient to rely on

its breath weapons for long, however. It would

rather wade into melee, tearing its enemies

to pieces with its sharp claws.

Breath Weapon (Su): 60-foot cone,

3/day,  6d6  cold,  Re ex  DC  19  half.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Death  Throes  (Ex):  When

killed,  a  chraal  explodes  in  an

immense  blast  of  cold  energy

that  deals  10  points  of  cold

damage  and  10  points  of  pierc-

ing  damage  to  anything  within

30 feet (Re ex DC 19 half). The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Freeze  (Ex):  A  chraal

generates so much cold that

its mere touch, including all

its attacks, deals an additional

+1d6 points of cold damage. Any

metallic  weapon  a  chraal  might

wield  in  combat  also  conducts

this cold.

De  ecting  Cold  (Su):

The  magical  cold  radiance

that  shines  from  the  cracks

in a chraals black ice gives it a

measure of defense, providing it

with a +4 de ection bonus to Armor Class.

CHRAALS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, chraals are native to the

icy plane of Risia, which is coterminous with the Material

Plane for one month every  ve years.

Flickering flames move along the ground and through the air

as one unified mass. It sparks and crackles, setting fire to all

it touches.

While most elementals tend toward neutrality, cinders are

most de nitely evil. They glory in in icting pain and caus-

ing destruction. Individually, they are no more signi cant

than a  eck of hot ash that snaps out of a camp re. Collec-

tively, they possess great destructive power.

Each elemental composing a cinder swarm speaks Ignan,

but  communicating  with  a  single  Fine  elemental  in  the

swarm is virtually impossible. The crackle and roar of the

mass of cinders is overwhelms individual voices.

COMBAT

A  cinder  swarm  begins  by  attacking  the  nearest  creature.

However,  in  subsequent  rounds,  it  will  attack  creatures

that demonstrate the ability to harm it, especially those

that  have  cold-based  attacks.  Unlike  many  fire-based

elementals, cinders have a  y speed and frequently go after

aerial opponents.

Burn  (Ex):  A  cinder  swarms  attack  deals  damage  as  a

swarm plus  re damage from the Fine elementals  aming

bodies. Those swarmed by cinders also must succeed on a

DC 20 Re ex save or catch on  re. The  ame burns for 1d4

rounds. A burning creature can take a move action to put out

the  ame. The save DC is Constitution-based.

swarm,  and  also  catch  on  fire  unless  they  succeed  on  a

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a

cinder swarms damage that begins its turn with a swarm

in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 20 Fortitude

save negates the effect. Even after a successful save, spell-

casting  or  concentrating  on  spells  within  the  area  of  a

swarm  requires  a  Concentration  check  (DC  20  +  spell

level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration

requires  a  DC  20  Concentration  check.  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

CINDER SWARMS IN EBERRON

Cinder swarms are native to the  ery plane of Fernia and

often  nd their way to Eberron at times when Fernia and

the Material Plane are coterminous.

CINDER SWARMS IN FAERN

Cinder  swarms  are  born  in  great  pits  of  lava  that  touch

on  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Fire.  Carried  to  the  surface  by

erupting volcanoes, they can ravage thousands of acres of

surrounding countryside. However, they are far more prev-

alent in the Underdark, particularly in the Serpent Deeps

(under  Tashalar  and  Lapaliiya),  the  Burning  Rift  (under

the Jungles of Chult), and the Spawning Deep (under the

Smoking Mountains).

CONFLAGRATION OOZE

This  odd  creature  looks  like  a  massive  pudding  of  flame.  Its

glistening  membrane  barely  seems  able  to  contain  the  roaring

inferno within it. Flames and fiery fluid swirl and flow through

the ooze, and bursts and gouts of flame erupt from occasional

breaks in the creatures skin.

Most  oozes  are  mindless  hunters,  stalking  the

shadowy  places  in  a  constant  search  for

food.  But  magical  or  environmental

accidents sometimes result in a new

breed of monster. Such was the case

with the con agration ooze. Wheth-

er  the  result  of  some  wild  magical

experiment, an environmental di-

saster, or something else entirely,

con agration oozes have demon-

strated  to  the  unwary  that  they

should  not  be  underestimated  or

tri ed with.

A  conflagration  ooze  looks

like a mass of liquid  ame, bare-

ly held together by a transparent

membrane.  The   re  that  roars

within  it  breaks  through  the

protective outer skin on occa-

sion, and the creature radiates

an  intense  heat.  The  average

con agration ooze measures 8

feet  across  and  weighs  around

1,500 pounds.

Con agration oozes, unlike the

majority of their ooze counterparts, are

not  mindless  eaters.  They  possess  a  reasonable

degree  of  intellect,  allowing  them  to  formulate  tactics  and

basic strategy. One typically claims a series of caverns near

a volcano or hot springs as a lair. It spends most of its time

hunting, like other oozes, as it requires a great deal of energy

to fuel the massive inferno raging within.

Con agration oozes also hoard treasure, and some have

even been known to conduct magical research. Con agration

oozes love  re, and they sometimes wander out of their lairs

to revel in the destruction and panic their coming brings as

entire regions of land are consumed in their passing.

Con agration oozes speak Ignan.

COMBAT

A conflagration ooze begins a battle

with its spell-like abilities, hoping

to  immobilize  some  of  its  oppo-

nents  before  engaging  in  melee.

Once  it  closes  in,  it  attempts  to

grapple its foes and infuse them

with  the  fiery  toxin  that  surges

through its body.

Fire in the Blood (Su): A potent

 ery toxin  ows through the body of

a  con agration  ooze.  Any  creature

grappled or pinned by the ooze must

make  a  successful  DC  19  Fortitude

save as the  ery toxin seeps through

the victims skin (or whatever surface

passes for its skin) and into its blood

(or life-supporting  uid, such as sap in

a plant creature).

Success  indicates  the  creature

takes 1d6 points of  re damage in

addition  to  any  damage  already

dealt by the slam or grapple, as the

 re burns and sears the creature.

Failure indicates that the toxin

has taken hold of the creatures body

and has begun converting portions of

its blood into liquid  ame. The creature

takes  1d4  points  of  Constitution  damage

and 2d6 points of  re damage, in addition to any

damage already dealt by the slam or grapple. Each round the

creature remains grappled by the ooze, and for 1 round after-

VARIANT CONFLAGRATION OOZE

Occasionally, those who have encountered conflagration oozes

and survived meet others of a similar experience. In the course

of  comparing  their  respective  war  stories,  these  individuals

sometimes discover that the creature they faced had one ability

the other groups did not and assume the creatures to have been

different monsters entirely. These individuals would be wrong.

Highly magical creatures, some rare conflagration oozes have

evolved beyond the abilities normally associated with standard

creatures  of  their  species,  gaining  a  new,  deadly  ability  in  the

process. These conflagration oozes have a death throes special

ability that allows them to expose their foes to their deadly fiery

toxin  even  after  death.  The  CR  of  these  variant  conflagration

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

oozes is increased by 1, since its entirely likely that the lethal

creatures manage to mortally wound an opponent in the course

of their own death.

Death Throes (Ex): When killed, a conflagration ooze explodes

in a fiery flash of goo that deals 3d6 points of fire damage and

3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anything within 20 feet.

Creatures that make a DC 17 Reflex save take half damage.

In addition, creatures caught within the blast are exposed to

the oozes fiery toxin. These creatures must make a DC 17 For-

titude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and an

additional 2d6 points of fire damage. Only creatures that take

damage  from  the  initial  blast  must  make  this  second  save.

The save DCs are Constitution-based.

running down the victims body and giving it an unearthly,

Creatures  that  lack  a  Constitution  score,  such  as  con-

structs and undead, or any sort of life-dependent body  uid,

such as elementals, are immune to the Constitution damage

from this ability but are still subject to the  re damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the con agra-

tion ooze must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can attempt to deal slam damage with a successful

grapple check. The ooze can also attempt to use  re in the

blood against the grappled target.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  1/dayconfusion  (DC  15),  deep

Despite  its  size,  the  infernal  con agration  ooze  is  quite

stealthy. It prefers to attack from ambush, surprising its

prey with its confusion, deep slumber, and hold monster spell-

like abilities, then following up with melee attacks (opening

with its smite good attack). Infernal con agration oozes use

Power Attack frequently unless their foes prove particularly

dif cult to hit.

An  infernal  con agration  oozes  natural  weapons  are

treated  as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

Fire in the Blood (Su): The  aming toxin secreted by

an infernal con agration ooze deals 1d6 points of Constitu-

tion damage and 3d6 points of  re damage to a grappled foe.

The save DC to resist the toxin is 25.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day the infernal con agra-

tion  ooze  can  make  a  normal  melee  attack  that  deals  +15

Spell-Like  Abilities:  The  save  DCs  for  the  infernal

DEATHSHRIEKER

This horrible apparition floats above the ground, its skeletal face

twisted in horrible pain while it screams in a terrifying cacophony

that sounds like the last shrieks of the dying.

The deathshrieker is an undead spirit that embodies the

horrible cries and shrieks of the dying as they utter their

last gasps of life. It roams lonely and forgotten battle elds,

charnel houses, or sites of terrible plagues,  lling the air

with its mournful and soul-sapping screams. It relives the

 nal moments of those who have died from slow, agonizing

deaths due to violence, disease, or some other tragedy. Typi-

cally, the larger the death and despair of an area, the larger

the  deathshrieker,  although  relatively

small areas that hosted truly despicable

acts of violence can bring one into

being as well.

Most  deathshriekers  haunt  a

single  location,  although  some

wander  aimlessly  on  lonely

and  desolate  roads  or  other

forbidding  terrain.  They  are

angry,  vengeful  spirits  that

endlessly  babble  the  final

words  of  those  who  have

died.  They  seek  to  kill  liv-

ing  beings  just  to  hear  their

final  scream.  The  haunt  of  a

deathshrieker  is  noted  for

odd,  disturbing  noises

and the occasional whis-

per  of  the  dead  crying

out in pain. These noises

can  persist  for  years  even  if  the

death shrieker is destroyed.

A  deathshrieker  is  5  to  6  feet  tall

and weightless.

Deathshriekers  speak  Common  and

one other language, often the racial lan-

guage  of  those  who  died  in  the  most

numbers within the area. They rarely

speak with intent but instead replay

the last words of a hundred souls that

have perished, which blur together in a

terrifying din.

critical hit). The deathshrieker heals 5 points of damage

(10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains Charisma, gain-

ing  any  excess  as  temporary  hit  points.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Death Rattle (Su): When a deathshrieker is reduced to

0 hit points, it releases a  nal, devastating shriek. All living

creatures within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC

24  Will  save  or  gain  1d4  negative  levels.  Creatures  that

cannot hear or are under the effect of a silence spell gain

a +4 bonus on the save to resist this effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Despair (Su): At the mere sight of a death-

shrieker,  the  viewer  must  succeed  on  a  DC

24 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4

rounds. Whether or not the save is success-

ful,  that  creature  cannot  be  affected

again  by  the  same  deathshriekers  de-

spair  ability  for  24  hours.  The  save  DC

is Charisma-based.

Scream  of  the  Dying  (Su):

Once per day, as a full-round ac-

tion, a deathshrieker can release

a  soul-numbing  scream  that

lasts  for  up  to  3  rounds.  After

this  first  round,  a  deathshrieker

can use a standard action to sustain

the scream. This attack affects all

living creatures within a 30-foot

spread  centered  on  the  death-

shrieker, or within a 60-foot cone

extending from the deathshrieker,

at  the  creatures  option.  Once  the

deathshrieker  chooses  the  shape  of

this  effect,  it  must  maintain  that  ef-

fect for all three rounds. In the case

of  a  cone,  it  can  aim  in  a  single  di-

rection  during  its  turn.  Creatures

caught  in  this  area  must  make  a

DC 26 Will save or suffer the ef-

fects  described  below.  The  save

DC is Charisma-based. Creatures

that cannot hear or are under the

effect of a silence spell gain a +4 bo-

nus on their Will saves. The effects

COMBAT

A deathshrieker charges headlong into combat, using its

despair  ability  to  root  creatures  in  place  before  striking

with  their  incorporeal  touch.  A  deathshrieker  will  wait

until it can catch as many creatures as possible in the area

of  its  scream  of  the  dying  ability.  If  it  is  close  to  being

destroyed, a deathshrieker will stay in the thick of combat,

using  its  death  rattle  ability  to  cause  a  retributive  strike

against the living.

Charisma  Drain  (Su):  An  individual  struck  by  a

death shrieker must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or per-

manently  lose  1d4  points  of  Charisma  (2d4  points  on  a

are cumulative and concurrent:

Round 1: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds.

Round 2: The creature is stunned for 1d3 rounds.

Round 3: The creature suffers the effects of insanity, as the

spell cast by an 18th-level sorcerer.

This effect is so loud that normal conversation is impos-

sible. Spellcasters who attempt to cast spells with a verbal

component must make a DC 26 Concentration check or the

spell is negated.

Deaths Grace (Ex): A deathshrieker gains a +1 profane

bonus to AC for every 3 Hit Dice it possesses.

Silence  Vulnerability  (Ex):  Deathshriekers  cannot

abide silence and are harmed by it. To even enter into the

radius of a silence spell, a deathshrieker must make a Will

remains within the area of a silence spell, it takes 1d10 points

ADVANCED DEATHSHRIEKER

Truly cataclysmic battles sometimes spawn deathshriekers

of  incredible  power.  These  horrible  beings  are  like  their

weaker kin, but much more aggressive and horrifying.

The  advanced  deathshrieker  presented  here  adjusts  the

base  creatures  statistics  by  advancing  its  Hit  Dice  and

adding ability score increases based on Hit Dice.

Combat

The  save  DCs  for  this  advanced  deathshriekers  Charisma

drain (DC 27), death rattle (DC 27), despair (DC 27), and

scream  of  the  dying  ability  (DC  29)  are  adjusted  for  its

improved Hit Dice. It otherwise follows the same combat

tactics as regular deathshriekers.

DEATHSHRIEKERS IN EBERRON

Deathshriekers  haunt  the  battle-scorched  plains  of  the

Mournland.  They  also  prevail  along  the  jagged  coastlines

of the Demon Wastes, along which many ships and crews

have met their doom. One of the Lords of Dust, a powerful

rakshasa, inhabits a palace haunted by deathshriekers and

reportedly  nds their hellish screams soothing.

DEATHSHRIEKERS IN FAERN

Deathshriekers  have  plagued  Faern  since  the  Time  of

Troubles, a period of great turmoil and suffering that ended

with the destruction of many gods. They also haunt the land

surrounding the black pit that was once the city of Tilverton

and other ruins of dread and despair.

Lean  and  wiry,  this  four-armed  creature  holds  two  powerful

longbows  in  its  left  arms  and  draws  the  strings  back  in  par-

allel  with  its  right  arms.  The  massive  arrows  notched  in  the

bows  draw  the  eye,  and  the  emaciated  limbs  with  which  it

holds its twin bows obviously conceal an abyssal strength. The

creatures gray skin is oily and moist, and it is entirely hairless.

The creatures long legs end in four-jointed toes, and it grips

the ground as it walks.

Arrow demons were created to serve in massive battalions

on the endless abyssal battle elds. Although they still play

a devastating role in such battles, arrow demons have now

begun  to  appear  elsewhere.  Powerful  demons  and  mortal

summoners alike have learned that even one arrow demon

is capable of dominating a battle eld.

Although arrow demons are dangerous by themselves,

they  are  at  their  most  deadly  when  they  can  stand  still

and shoot every round. On battlefields, this means that

companies  of  arrow  demons  are  shielded  by  ranks  of

lesser troopspitiful, abyssal creatures too weak to stop

a serious assault yet numerous enough to slow an onrush-

ing  enemy  long  enough  for  the  ranks  of  arrow  demons

to  deliver  massive  arrow   re  on  the  enemy.  In  the  skir-

mishes and battles of mortal summoners, this means that

the arrow demon is most effective when acting in concert

with  other  summoned  creatures  or  perhaps  the  mortals

lesser minions.

The  very  effectiveness  of  these  obvious  tactics  have

given  arrow  demons  an  importance  in  the  ranks  of  the

demons  higher  than  their  sheer  physical  power  would

otherwise earn them. Although an arrow demon must still

give way to any greater demon, large groups of the abyssal

archers know they are too valuable to their demonic lords

battle plans to be gainsaid by any but the most powerful

individual demons.

Like  other  demons,  arrow  demons  are  cruel  beyond

mortal  measure,  knowing  nothing  of  compassion  or

altruism. They scorn virtue and despise hope, yet they

understand more clearly than perhaps any other demon

that their continued existence depends on their value to

their masters.

An arrow demon is an emaciated, four-limbed demon,

standing some 6 feet 6 inches in height. It is completely

hairless, and its moist, gray skin is sickening and leathery to

the touch. The creatures limbs conceal a wiry strength, but

it weighs only 150 pounds.

Arrow demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.

Arrow Demon Ammunition

The arrow demons statistics assume that the creature uses

nonmagical arrows only. You can add other types of arrows

to the demons quiver, or you can roll on the following table

to randomly determine what type(s) of special ammunition

the demon carries (if any). Any ammunition the demon car-

ries should be treated as part of its treasure.

COMBAT

Arrow demons prefer to  ght in ordered ranks surrounded

by  hundreds  of  their  kind.  Grouped  into  massive  battal-

ions, arrow demons are capable of destroying entire armies

of  foes.  Now  that  these  demons  are  being  sent  to  other

planes  and  given  missions  other  than  outright  warfare,

most  who  encounter  them  do  so  outside  of  the  abyssal

battle elds of the Nine Hells or the in nite layers of the

Abyss. As archers  rst and foremost, arrow demons prefer

to  have  allied  creatures  between  them  and  an  enemy,

allowing  them  to  reliably   re  a  steady  stream  of  arrows

from their twin bows.

Small  groups  of  arrow  demons  have  perfected  an

unorthodox  method  of  holding  a  running  battle.  When

pressed and working as a group, the arrow demon with the

most hit points makes a full attack while all of his allies use

dimension door to go as far away as they can and maintain

line of sight to their foes. Once the lead demon is wounded,

it uses dimension door to relocate behind the group and all

but one member of the group use dimension door to appear

next to him, beginning the process once again. Using this

tactic, the demons get to make the maximum number of

full-attack  actions  possible  in  the  terrain  and  their  foes

attacks are always directed against the demon most able to

withstand them.

An arrow demons natural weapons, as well as any weap-

ons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Close  Combat  Shot  (Ex):  An  arrow  demon  does  not

incur attacks of opportunity for  ring a bow while threat-

ened. In addition, the arrow demon can shoot its bows to

make attacks of opportunity as if it threatened the squares

adjacent to it with its bows.

Oversized Weapons (Ex): Arrow demons can use bows

of any kind that are up to one size larger than their size

would allow without penalty.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdimension door (self plus

50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 10th.

Summon  Tanarri  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  an  arrow

demon  can  either  automatically  summon  1d6  dretches

or attempt to summon another arrow demon with a 35%

chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-

level spell.

Symmetrical  Archery  (Ex):  The  arrow  demon  has  an

amazing ability to wield two bows at once in unison. Any

time  the  arrow  demon  could  make  a  single  attack  with  a

bow, it can attack with both of its bows, at 2 to all its attack

rolls  that  round.  For  example,  when  making  an  attack

action, an arrow demon can  re one arrow from each bow

at  its  normal  attack  bonus  minus  2,  and  when  making  a

full-attack action, it can  re one arrow from each bow for

each of its normal iterative attacks (two arrows from each

bow, each shaft at a 2 penalty). The statistics block above

already includes these bonuses. The arrow demon takes no

additional penalties for using multiple weapons as long as it

is using only bows.

Telepathy  (Su):  Arrow  demons  can  communicate

telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has

a language.

SUMMONING AN ARROW DEMON

An evil spellcaster who knows the summon monster VII spell

can choose to permanently remove the babau from the list

of creatures that he can summon (either with summon mon-

ster VII or with higher level summoning spells). If he does

so, he can replace the babau with the arrow demon, adding

it to the list of creatures that he can summon with the spell.

Once the spellcaster learns higher-level summoning spells,

he can use them to summon multiple arrow demons if he

has chosen this option.

ARROW DEMONS IN EBERRON

Arrow demons are native to the plane of Shavarath, where

they wage war against the devils indigenous to that plane.

Desperate Cyran and Karnnathi commanders used sum-

moned arrow demons to bolster their armies in the dying

days of the Last War.

ARROW DEMONS IN FAERN

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, arrow demons are native

to the In nite Layers of the Abyss. However, they also popu-

late the Blood Rift, a plane where demons and devil wage the

eternal Blood War. In addition, the Blood Rift  oats among

the Lower Planes, becoming coterminous at different times

to many of them. Consequently, arrow demons may also be

encountered  in  the  Barrens  of  Doom  and  Despair,  Deep

Caverns, the Demonweb Pits, Furys Heart, Hammergrim,

Nishrek, and the Supreme Throne.

This emaciated figure stands nearly 15 feet tall. Batlike wings

protrude  from  its  back.  Its  face  is  a  skeletal  mockery  of  utter

mourning, and two short, twisted horns sprout from the front of

its high brow. A wide maw and hooked claws clutching a massive

polearm only add to this picture of lethality.

Creatures of loss, sorrowsworn demons appear only after

a war or battle has finished. They prey on the feelings of

great sorrow that permeate a region after the loss of its

youth and promise.

Favored  haunts  of  sorrowsworn  demons  include  mass

graves, orphanages, hospitals, and the homes of those who

have  lost  loved  ones  to  battle.  Wherever  one  can   nd  the

greatest concentration of souls suffering from loss, one can

also often  nd a lurking sorrowsworn demon, encouraging

those feelings and sating itself on them.

A sorrowsworn demon stands between 12 and 15 feet

high  and  weighs  about  500  pounds.  Its  skin  is  always  a

dusky black, and its face always appears as a mocking visage

of great sadness.

Sorrowsworn demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common,

Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Infernal.

COMBAT

A  sorrowsworn  demon  preys  on  the  weakness  of  others,

and its tactics re ect this preference. It nearly always strikes

from hiding, attempting to bring its aura of loss to bear on

as many foes as possible. It then uses its mind reading abili-

ties to determine what its foes most fear losing, then uses

its whispers of loss to further weaken its opponents before

ripping into them.

A sorrowsworn demons natural weapons, as well as any

weapons  it  wields,  are  treated  as  chaotic-aligned  and  evil-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A sorrowsworn normally attacks using its Power Attack

feat, taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5

bonus on damage rolls (+10 damage if using a glaive).

Aura  of  Loss  (Su):  A  sorrowsworn  demon  radiates

feelings of intense personal loss. Any creature within 30

feet  of  a  sorrowsworn  demon  must  make  a  DC  26  Will

save or be overwhelmed with feelings of despair as they

continually visualize the most terrible losses theyve ever

endured or can imagine happening. These feelings mani-

fest as a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability

checks,  and  skill  checks.  An  opponent  that  fails  this

save and has also had its mind read by the sorrowsworn

demon is more likely to fall victim to its whispers of loss

(see below).

In addition, due to the distracting nature of the aura, any

affected creatures that attempt to cast spells must succeed

on  a  Concentration  check  (DC  20  +  spell  level)  to  avoid

losing the spell.

This  ability  lasts  for  as  long  as  affected  creatures

remain  within  the  area  of  the  aura  and  for  2d6  rounds

after they leave. Creatures that leave the aura and reen-

ter must make another save upon reentry or be affected

once more, regardless of whether they made their initial

saving throw.

The sorrowsworn demon can suppress or activate this

ability  at  will  as  a  free  action.  This  is  a  mind-affecting

ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect magic, invisibil-

ity,  nondetection,  greater  teleport  (self  plus  50  pounds  of

objects  only);  3/daygreater  dispel  magic,  touch  of  idiocy

(+26  melee  touch),  unholy  blight  (DC  19);  1/dayfeeble-

mind (DC 20), mind fog (DC 20), plane shift, weird (DC 24).

Caster level 20th.

Whispers of Loss (Su): A sorrowsworn demon preys on

an enemys feelings of loss, both real and projected. While

engaged  in  combat,  it  whispers  and  hisses  constantly,

both aloud and in the minds of those creatures that can

understand it.

A  sorrowsworn  demon  can  intensify  these  whispers,

focusing  them  as  a  free  action  each  round  on  one  target

within 60 feet that can understand it. Each round, it can

change targets at will (this is also a free action, although

the previous victim might suffer lasting effects from the

whispers  of  loss,  as  described  below).  These  intensi ed

whispers of loss have different effects, depending on the

sorrowsworn demons whims and tactics.

Any creature that has succumbed to both a sorrowsworn

demons aura of loss and mind reading abilities takes an addi-

tional  2  penalty  on  any  saves  to  resist  the  sorrowsworn

demons whispers.

Future  Sorrow:  A  sorrowsworn  demon  whispers  of  the

losses  to  come,  and  the  futility of struggling against the

inevitability  of  loss.  The  target  creature  is  stunned  for  2

rounds (Will DC 24 negates). This is a fear effect.

Great  Emptiness:  A  sorrowsworn  demon  whis-

pers  of  the  great  losses  of  history:  genocides  and

other  mass  murders,  great  tragedies,  and  sac-

ri ces  that  resulted  in  no  greater  good.  The

target  creature  be-

comes  confused  for

5  rounds  (Will  DC

24 negates).

Past Losses: A sorrowsworn demon

describes  the  target  creatures  past

losses,  both  real  and  imagined.  The

creature  is  dazed  for  3  rounds  as  it  con-

templates all the losses of its life (Will DC

24 negates).

Whispers of loss is a mind-affecting ability

and only functions against creatures with an

Intelligence  score  of  3  or  higher.  A  creature

that succeeds on the saving throw against

a  whispers  of  loss  effect  is  immune  to

that effect (but not the other effects) for 24

hours. Caster level 20th. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

Mind  Reading  (Sp):  Once  per  round

as a free action, a sorrowsworn demon can

read the mind of one opponent (Will DC 24

negates). This ability functions exactly as the

detect thoughts spell (caster level 20th), except that

the  effect  is  immediate.  An  opponent  that  fails

this save and has also succumbed to the sorrow-

sworn demons aura of loss is more likely to fall victim to its

whispers of loss (see above).

A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune

to  that  sorrowsworn  demons  mind  reading  ability  for  the

next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Skills: A sorrowsworn demon has a +8 racial bonus on

Hide, Move Silently, and Survival checks.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

A sorrowsworn demon begins an encounter hidden (using

invisibility and nondetection), spying out its would-be oppo-

nents and using its mind reading and detect magic abilities to

gauge their intentions and powers. Once it believes its aura

of loss and other mind-affecting abilities can take a toll, it

teleports into the midst of its enemies.

Round 1: Greater dispel magic on target with most magical

auras (detected with its detect magic spell-like ability).

Round 2: Mind fog against foes to weaken Will saves.

Round 3: Feeblemind on spellcaster.

Round  4:  Greater  teleport  to  immediate  vicinity  of  ene-

mies, exposing them to aura of loss. Use whispers of loss

against foe most likely to threaten it.

Round 5: Unleash unholy blight or make full

attack. Continue with whispers of loss.

SORROWSWORN

DEMONS IN FAERN

Faern  has  seen  its  share  of

wars,  and  sorrowsworn  demons

are  drawn  to  places  where  the

lingering  pain  of  war  is  felt

most  strongly.  They  often  lurk  in

shattered  temples  dedicated  to  dead

gods  such  as  Myrkul  and  Bhaal,  feeding  on

the  despair  of  forsaken  clerics.  They  also  hide

among  the  masses,  feeding  on  the  anguish  of

Thayans,  Rashemaar,  Cormyrians,  Sembians,  and  other

people  who  lost  loved  ones  to  the  Tuigan  Horde  and

similar invaders.

Sorrowsworn demon

Strong  Willed  (Ex):  Masters  of  manipulating  minds,

sorrow sworn demons are in turn especially resistant to

similar abilities. They have a +4 racial bonus on saves against

telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a

language.

This  giant  bipedal  reptilian  beast  has

powerful jaws, massive teeth, and thick bony plates

along its back and spiked tail. Steel half-plate barding

covers the creature, adding even more protection; a

saddle can be seen on the creatures back.

Battletitan

Battletitan dinosaurs are massive predatory beasts

meticulously bred as hybrids of other dinosaurs.

They  do  not  occur  naturally;  only  elaborate

nonmagical  breeding  techniques  give

rise to the mighty battletitans. King-

doms that  eld the dinosaurs in their armies

jealously guard the means of their creation, treating

such information as a state secret. With the ferocity of the

most dangerous carnivores and the defenses of the toughest

armored herbivores, a battletitan is a terror to behold.

Battletitans are trained from birth to  ght carrying a rider

and wearing barding. None but the most skilled and trusted

knights are allowed to guide a battletitan into combat, and

trainers  teach  each  dinosaur  to  accept  only  riders  who

know the proper signals. Armies can replace riders that are

killed in battle simply by teaching the signals to a new rider

(which is crucial, since the battletitans almost always outlive

those who sit atop them).

An adult battletitan is 32 feet from nose to tail and stands

18 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs more than 12 tons.

COMBAT

A battletitan is under the control of its handler in combat;

the rider gives the creature commands as it would any other

mount trained for war. Warriors mounted on battletitans prefer

to overrun ranks of regular infantry on their way to seeking out

enemy siege engines or other powerful battle eld monsters.

A rider must make a Ride check to attack while riding a battle-

titan, and usually requires a reach weapon to attack foes.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  battletitan

must hit an opponent of up to one size smaller with its bite

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity.  If  it  wins  the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow

the foe the following round.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A battletitan can try to swallow a

grabbed opponent of up to two sizes smaller than itself by

making a successful grapple check. The swallowed creature

takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage and 12 points

of acid damage per round from the dinosaurs gizzard. Swal-

lowed creatures must also make a DC 37 Fortitude saving

throw each round or be overcome with nausea until their

next action (the save DC is Constitution-based). While in

the gizzard, the opponent is still considered grappled due

to a battletitans powerful digestive muscles.

A  swallowed  creature  can  cut  its

way  out  by  using  a  light  slashing  or

piercing  weapon  to  deal  30  points  of

damage to the gizzard (AC 18). Once the

creature exits, muscular action closes the

hole; another swallowed opponent must

cut  its  own  way  out.  A  Huge  battle-

titans gizzard can hold 1 Medium,

2 Small, 8 Tiny, 32 Diminutive, or

128 Fine opponents.

TRAINING A

BATTLETITAN

The  techniques  for  training  one  of

these powerful dinosaurs are as closely

guarded as the means of breeding them.

Training a young battletitan requires six

months of work and a DC 28 Handle

Animal check; battletitans cannot be

domesticated if they reach adulthood

without having been trained.

Battletitans are naturally sterile, and each specimen is the

product of direct crossbreeding of other dinosaurs. As a re-

sult, a young battletitan that makes it to the open market

commands whatever price the market can bear, which is of-

ten more than 100,000 gp. Any such sales are likely to at-

tract the attention of the kingdom from which the creature

was pilfered, of course.

Battletitan dinosaurs cannot be selected as animal com-

panions, nor can they be summoned with summon natures

ally spells.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a battletitan is up to

11,093 pounds; a medium load, 11,09422,186 pounds; and

a heavy load, 22,18733,280 pounds.

This quadruped is covered with a thick, spiked hide. Two large

horns jut backward from its massive head.

Bloodstriker dinosaurs feed on vegetation and larger insects,

often burrowing to hide from both predators and prey.

A  bloodstriker  is  about  14  feet  long  and  weighs  about

3,000 pounds.

Fleshraker

COMBAT

A  bloodstriker  epitomizes  tough

natural defenses. Thick, spiked

plates  cover  its  body,

providing  both

excellent natural

armor  and  protective  spikes  apt  to  damage  any  creature

adventurous  enough  to  attack  it.  Those  that  successfully

attack are sprayed by the dinosaurs caustic blood, providing

further dissuasion. In addition, the creature has an unusual

attack  whereby  it  squirts  its  acidic  blood  from  its  eyes.  It

usually uses the blood squirt as a defensive measure when

confronted by persistent foes.

Blood Squirt (Ex): Every 1d4 rounds, a bloodstriker can

project a 30-foot line of its acidic blood as a standard action.

Anyone in the area takes 2d6 points of acid damage (Re ex

DC 19 half). The save DC is Constitution based.

Caustic Blood (Ex): Any creature successfully striking a

bloodstriker with a melee weapon or natural weapon takes

1d6 points of acid damage from the dinosaurs highly acidic

blood. Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears,

do not endanger their users in this way.

Spiked Skin (Ex): A bloodstrikers thick skin bristles

with defensive spikes. Any creature attacking a bloodstriker

with a melee weapon or natural weapon takes 1d8+6 points

of piercing and slashing damage from the dinosaurs barbs.

Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not

endanger their users in this way.

Skills: *Bloodstrikers gain a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks when they burrow underground to hide. They lurk

just below the surface of the ground with only their eyes and

the tops of their heads exposed.

BLOODSTRIKERS AS MOUNTS

In places where dinosaurs are used as mounts, bloodstrik-

ers are greatly prized because of their defensive capabilities.

Trainers and riders must exercise great personal care when

working with these creatures, however, because their spiked

hide and defensive abilities present additional challenges.

When attempting to

teach  a  bloodstriker

to  take  a  rider  or

perform tasks, the

trainer  must  de-

cide  whether  to  take  extra

precautions  (increasing  the

amount  of  time  (taking  a  4  circumstance  penalty  on  all

Handle Animal checks to teach, train, or rear).

Riding a bloodstriker is equally challenging. All ride

checks are made with a 4 circumstance penalty. In addi-

tion, a rider requires a specially made exotic saddle. Some-

one foolish enough to attempt to ride the creature bareback

or  with  a  noncustomized  saddle  takes  1d8+6  points  of

piercing and slashing damage from its spiked skin upon

mounting it or whenever a Ride check is required.

Thin,  wicked-looking  spines  bristle  from  this  creatures  back,

sinuous tail, and muscled forelimbs, glistening with some clear

liquid. Although it stands upright, you can tell the mottled green

killer can run on all fours should it desire. A long, reptilian snout

opens  wide  with  a  short  bark  to  display  a  set  of  deadly,  sharp

teeth,  and  each  of  its  four  limbs  sprouts  a  pair  of  6-inch-long

hooked claws.

A cousin of the velociraptor, the  eshraker is a clever predator

that lurks in areas of heavy undergrowth and dense forest.

Fleshrakers usually hunt in packs, preying upon unsuspect-

ing creatures that pass by. They prefer to attack lone targets,

but if theyre hungry enough, or if they outnumber a small

group,  eshrakers are just as likely to attack.

When food becomes scarce,  eshrakers have been known

to grow bolder in their hunts. They  nd a deserted stretch

of road traveled by the occasional caravan and attempt to

pick  off  straggling  pack  mules  or  even  lightly  guarded

wagons. Those who have encountered  eshraker packs and

survived swear the creatures set up ambushes and coordi-

nate their attacks.

Some wild tribes of forest dwellers have been known to

domesticate   eshrakers  to  serve  as  guards.  Their  natural

ability to blend in with their surroundings, combined with

their  innate  tactical  sense,  makes  them  especially  deadly

in this capacity. Rumors also abound of some  eshrakers

being used as mounts, although the creatures spines would

certainly require the use of a specially constructed saddle to

ride it comfortably.

An average  eshraker stands 7 feet tall and weighs about

300 pounds.

COMBAT

A  eshraker prefers to begin each combat with a leaping

pounce attack. A  eshraker tries to land on its target, pin-

ning it to the ground so that it can savagely rip its prey apart

as quickly as possible. If a target cannot be slain in a single

leaping pounce attack, a  eshraker is likely to  ee and let its

debilitating poison have a chance to work, returning later

when the prey is weakened.

A  eshraker cannot use its tail attack against an opponent

it bites in the same round.

Leaping  Pounce  (Ex):  When  a   eshraker  charges,  it

leaps high into the air above its prey, attempting to knock it

to the ground. This ability functions much like the pounce

special  attack.  However,  a   eshrakers  incredible  jumping

ability makes its leaping pounce particularly deadly.

When a  eshraker charges a foe, it can make a full attack,

including one rake attack. If a  eshraker successfully hits

and damages a target of its size or smaller that it pounces

on during a charge, it can make a free trip attack without

provoking  attacks  of  opportunity.  If  the   eshraker  wins

the opposed trip check, it can make an immediate grapple

check. If it succeeds, the opponent is considered grappled

and pinned on the ground beneath the  eshraker. On each

subsequent  round,  the   eshraker  can  deal  automatic  claw

and rake damage with a successful grapple check against a

pinned opponent.

If a fleshraker fails the opposed trip check, it cannot

be tripped in return. If it successfully trips its opponent

but  fails  the  subsequent  grapple  check,  the  opponent  is

still prone in the  eshrakers square, but it is not grappled

or pinned.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage

1d6  Dex,  secondary  damage  1d6  Dex.  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +2 melee, damage 1d6+2.

Skills: Fleshrakers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks

and  a  +6  racial  bonus  on  Jump  checks.  *The  Hide  bonus

increases to +10 in forested areas.

This bipedal reptilian creature has a lithe body and a whiplike

tail. Smaller than a halfling, it has a pair of dexterous grasping

hands, a sharp beak, and large pure black eyes.

Not all dinosaurs are massive brawlers that shake the ground

as they pass. The swindlespitter relies on its small size and

natural agility to survive literally beneath the notice of its

larger cousins. They can be found in any land where other

dinosaurs live and are a nuisance to just about every creature

they encounter.

Swindlespitters  are  natural  thieves,  devouring  eggs

they steal from the nests of other breeds. However, they

are easily confused by manufactured objects, mistaking

them for oddly shaped eggs. Travelers should be wary of

their  tendency  to  sneak  into  settlements  or  camps  and

swipe backpacks, spellbooks, and other objects of similar

size. They carry such items into the jungle a fair distance

before trying to rip them open to get at the gooey yolk they

imagine is within. Many adventurers  nd their possessions

shredded by the time they are able retrieve them from a very

perplexed swindlespitter.

In lands where humanoids and dinosaurs live side-by-

side, swindlespitters are treated as an unfortunate neces-

sity. While the creatures walk off with unsecured objects

regularly, those wise in the ways of natural cycles realize

the importance of the lowly swindlespitter. By devouring

the eggs of larger dinosaurs, they keep those creatures from

reproducing in greater numbers than the land can support.

In some cultures, the swindlespitter is even considered a

symbol of balance and harmony with nature. Anyone dis-

covered harming one of the little dinosaurs in such a society

quickly  nds themselves on the wrong end of a very sticky

cultural misunderstanding.

A swindlespitter stands less than 3 feet tall and weighs

about 30 pounds.

COMBAT

A swindlespitter has no interest in  ghting other creatures;

it relies solely on stealth to acquire its meals. It  ees if dis-

covered, either  nding a hiding spot or simply running as

fast as it can with its ill-gotten gains. If it is cornered, it

attempts to blind its pursuers with its poison and dart away.

Only as a last resort does a swindlespitter attack with its

sharp beak. In large groups, they are slightly more daring,

sometimes descending on a nest or camp and carrying off

anything not tied down.

Poison Spray (Ex): When threatened, a swindlespitter

sprays a corrosive poison in a 15-foot cone from its mouth.

Contact; Fort DC 12; initial damage blindness for 2d4 min-

utes; secondary damage 1d4 Con. The swindlespitter can

spray this poison once every 1d4 rounds. Swindlespitters

flee from blinded opponents if possible. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A swindlespitter is adapted to get-

ting out of the way of larger dinosaurs. It has the ability to

react to danger before its senses would normally allow it to

do so. It retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even if it is caught

 at-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.

Skills:  A  swindlespitter  has  a  +2  racial  bonus  on

Spot  checks  and  Listen  checks.  *It  gains  a  +2  racial

bonus on Hide checks and Move Silently skills when in

forested terrain.

SWINDLESPITTER

ANIMAL COMPANIONS

A 1st-level druid can select a swindlespitter dinosaur as an

animal companion.

DINOSAURS IN EBERRON

The  world  of  Eberron  never  endured  an  Ice  Age,  and

consequently dinosaurs remain vital constituents of the

planets  ecology.  On  civilized  continents  such  as  Khor-

vaire and Sarlona, dinosaurs of Large size or smaller are

used as herd animals or mounts, while larger dinosaurs

survive only in remote areas or in captivity. Dinosaurs of

all sizes roam free on the untamed continent of Xendrik,

while on Argonnessen they provide a ready food supply

for  dragons  or  serve  as  mounts  for  dragon-worshiping

barbarian tribes.

DRACOTAUR

This large creature has the upper torso of a muscular reptilian

humanoid,  a  spear  held  tightly  in  its  clawed  hands.  Its  eyes

are  black  and  its  sharp  teeth  glisten.  Its  lower  torso  resembles

the body of a wingless dragon with large, clawed  feet  and  a

spiked tail that flails from side to side.

Dracotaurs  are  sly,  merciless  preda-

tors  incapable  of  showing  compas-

sion  and  expecting  none  in  return.

Hard  scales  that  vary  in  color  from

green to brown cover a dracotaur from

head to tail. Males have ornate crest-

ing  on  their  heads,  throats,  and

chests ranging from bright red to

deep purple. A dracotaurs 4-foot-

long tail, although used primar-

ily  for  balance,  ends  in  wicked

spikes  that  can  be  brought  to

bear in battle.

Dracotaurs  excrete  body

oil  that  helps  keep  their

scales  and  leather  armor

supple.  They  typically

wield sharp spears.

An  adult  dracotaur

stands  7  feet  tall  and  mea-

sures  10  feet  long,  weigh-

ing about 2,000 pounds.

Dracotaurs speak Draconic.

Dracotaur

Dracotaurs  overwhelm  their  foes  quickly

using ambushes and  anking tactics. Cold, calculat-

ing creatures, dracotaurs usually announce their presence by

spitting gouts of  re at their foes and then charge forward

with their spears. In the unfolding con ict, a dracotaur relies

on its brute strength and multiple attacks to win the day.

Spit Fire (Su): A dracotaur can spit a glob of  re as a stan-

dard action. Once a dracotaur spits, it cannot spit again for 1

minute. The dracotaurs spittle is a sticky adhesive substance

that ignites when exposed to air, much like alchemists  re.

This glob of  ery spittle is treated as a ranged touch attack

with a range increment of 20 feet.

A direct hit deals 2d6 points of  re damage. Every creature

within 5 feet of the point where the spittle hits takes 1d4

points of  re damage from the splash. Unlike alchemists

 re, a dracotaurs spittle does not continue to burn.

Skills: Because of their tails, dracotaurs have a +4 racial

bonus on Balance, Jump, and Swim checks.

DRACOTAUR SOCIETY

Dracotaurs  gather  in  small,  nomadic  tribes.  Dracotaurs

respect power above all, and they measure power in terms

of raw strength and arcane magical ability. Their leaders are

usually mighty warriors, sorcerers, or both.

Although dracotaur tribes occasionally  ght over land, ri-

val tribes quickly band together when faced with a common

outside threat. Dracotaurs will also ally with other reptilian

creatures, including lizardfolk and nagas. Although they are

not  devout  creatures,  dracotaurs  see  true  dragons  as  pow-

erful embodiments of the ancient gods and will give their

lives in the service of such creatures. Much of the races ar-

cane  knowledge  comes  from  the  ancient

teachings of the true dragons.

Dracotaurs rarely stay in any one place

long enough to warrant the building

of permanent settlements. However,

tribes will often lay claim to ancient

ruins and use them as sanctu-

aries,  training  grounds,  or

neutral meeting places.

Dracotaurs  and  cen-

taurs  despise  one  another,

and  many  a  dracotaur  war-

rior dreams of devouring the

 esh of a fallen centaur foe.

Combat

Dracotaur  barbarians  enter  a

rage immediately upon joining

a combat.

Rage  (Ex):  Twice  per  day,

this dracotaur rager can enter a state of  erce rage that

lasts 10 rounds. The following changes are in effect as

long as he rages: AC 18 (touch 9,  at-footed 18); hp increase

by 14; Atk +15 melee (2d6+9/3, battleaxe); Full Atk +13/

+8 melee (2d6+9/3, battleaxe) and +13 (1d8+43, handaxe)

and +8 melee (1d8+4, bite) and +8 melee (1d8+13, tail slap);

SV Fort +14, Will +9; Str 28, Con 24. At the end of his rage,

the  dracotaur  barbarian  is  fatigued  for  the  remainder  of

the encounter.

Trap  Sense  (Ex):  A  dracotaur  rager  has  an  intuitive

sense  that  alerts  it  to  danger  from  traps,  granting  a  +1

bonus on Re ex saves and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against

attacks by traps.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A dracotaur rager can react to

danger before its senses would normally allow it to do so.

It retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even if it is caught  at-

footed  or  struck  by  an  invisible  attacker.  However,  it  still

loses its Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

DRACOTAUR RAGER

DRACOTAURS AS CHARACTERS

The most feared warriors in a dracotaur tribe are often barbar-

ians who use their brute strength and ferocity to claim power.

The  dracotaur  rager  presented  here  had  the  follow-

ing ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice

ability score increases: Str 15, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 8, Wis

12, Cha 10.

When they are not hunting or defending their territory,

many  dracotaurs  pursue  the  study  of  sorcery.  Dracotaur

barbarians,  ghters, and rangers are also common. Draco-

taur clerics (which are rare) worship Tiamat and can choose

from the Destruction, Evil, and Trickery domains.

Dracotaur characters possess the following racial traits:

Silvery scales glisten on the muscular

flanks of this long, narrow, creature.

A  powerful,  jagged  beak  snaps

beneath  frighteningly  intelligent

eyes. Pairs of small fins tipped with

hooks march down its belly, while

a  frilled  fin  runs  the  full  length

of its back.

The only redeeming quality

of  the  terrible  dragon  eel  is

that it cant stand to be near

another  dragon  eel  except

when  mating  or  raising

young.  One  dragon  eel

can easily put a hole in the side of a

sailing vessel, devouring the crew at

its leisure after the vessel sinks. In

groups  they  could  destroy  entire

navies. Captains have been known

to negotiate with dragon eels for

safe  passage  of  their  ships,  but

dragon  eels  are  reputed  to  be  great

liars  and  some  crews  who  thought

they  were  safe  have  vanished  without

a trace.

A dragon eel is usually about 20 feet long

and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Dragon eels speak Aquan and Draconic, and particularly

intelligent individuals speak Sahuagin and Common.

COMBAT

A  dragon  eel  prefers  to  attack  ships  by  charging  them,

ramming holes in their sides beneath the waterline in an

attempt to sink them. If an opponent is too large to swallow,

a dragon eel attempts to grapple and then submerge with its

foe, drowning it.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  dragon  eel

must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  it  establishes  a  hold

and  can  attempt  to  swallow  the  foe  the  following  round

(see below).

Swallow Whole (Ex): A dragon eel can try to swallow

a grabbed opponent of Medium or smaller size by making

a  successful  grapple  check.  Once  inside,  the  opponent

takes 1d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 8 points of

acid damage per round from the dragon eels gizzard. A

swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light

slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage

to the gizzard (AC 17). Once the creature exits, muscu-

lar action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent

must cut its own way out. A Large dragon eels interior

can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or

512 Fine opponents.

Blindsense  (Ex):  A  dragon  eel  can  locate

creatures  underwater  within  30  feet  by

nonvisual  means.  Opponents  the  dragon

eel  cant  actually  see  still  have  total

concealment  against  the  dragon

eel. This ability works only when

the dragon eel is underwater.

Keen  Scent  (Ex):  A  dragon

eel can notice creatures by scent

within 180 feet, and detect blood

in the water up to a mile away.

Skills:  A  dragon  eel  has  a

+8  racial  bonus  on  any  Swim

check to perform some special

action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if distracted

or  endangered.  It  can  use  the  run

action  while  swimming,  provided

it swims in a straight line.

DRAGON EELS

IN EBERRON

Dragon eels live in the oceans of Eberron and

prey on dragon turtles and sailing vessels. They are

most common among the islands north of Xendrik,

where  the  sahuagin  dwell.  The  relationship  between

dragon  eels  and  sahuagin  is  unclear.  The  sahuagin

speak  of  their  alliances  with  the  creatures,  but  the

dragon eels clearly consider the sahuagin to be servants,

if not slaves, and guardians of their hoards

Regeneration  (Ex):  Fire  and  cold  deal

Skills: *A dread blossom swarm gains a +10 racial bonus

on Hide checks in forested areas.

Dread blossoms are blood-drinking plants from the Wilder-

ness of the Beastlands transplanted to the Material Plane by

foolish elves who mistook their nature.

An  individual  dread  blossom  looks  like  a  foot-long

crimson  flower,  speckled  with  gold  and  black  pollen,

that  ends  in  a  6-inch-long  hollow  thorn  surrounded  at

its  base  by  a  frill  of  inch-long  roots.  Few  creatures  can

examine a dread blossom in such detail, as a dread blos-

som swarm at rest is usually firmly planted in the bodies

DREAD BLOSSOM SWARMS

IN EBERRON

Dread blossoms are native to the plane of Lamannia, the

Twilight  Forest.  They  gather  in  the  jungles  of  Aerenal.

Millennia  ago,  elf  sorcerers  living  on  Xendrik  brought

the first dread blossoms to Eberron to plague their giant

masters.  Dread  blossom  swarms  continue  to  ravage  the

inhabitants  of  the  jungles  of  Xendrik  and  Aerenal.

The  elves  of  Aerenal  have  been  accused  of  deliberately

transplanting  and  unleashing  dread  blossom  swarms

upon their enemies, most recently the orc tribes of the

Shadow Marches.

This  animated  corpse  is  sopping

wet,  as  if  it  just  crawled  from  the

water. The air around it is thick and

cloying, exuding the essences of the

corpses watery grave.

The drowned lost their lives in

the watery deep. The evidence

of  their  gasping  death  always

saturates their clothing and  esh,

and  lls the air around them.

Many drowned came to their

current circumstances when their

ships  went  down  at  sea  with  all

hands. Others, more ancient,  rst

arose  when  their  island  homes

sank beneath the waves ages ago,

drowning all.

A  drowned  stands  between  5-

1/2 and 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs

between 120 and 210 pounds.

The drowned speak Common and Abyssal.

COMBAT

A drowned slams its foes with sodden limbs, but more wor-

risome is its terrible drowning aura.

A drowned normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus

on damage rolls.

Drowning  Aura  (Su):  A  drowned  gives  off  a  30-foot-

radius  emanation  of  suffocating  drowning,  imbuing  its

surroundings with a watery glint and deadly threat for crea-

tures that breathe. All breathing creatures within 30 feet of

a drowned are treated as if beneath water in terms of being

able to breathe. The drowning aura accelerates the process

of drowning.

Normally,  a  creature  can  hold  its  breath  for  a  number

of  rounds  equal  to  twice  its  Constitution  score  before  it

begins  to  drown.  Within  the

drowning  aura,  a  creature  can

only hold its breath if it makes

a  DC  10  Constitution  check

every round. Each round, the

DC  increases  by  1.  When  the

character   nally  fails  its  Con-

stitution  check,  it  begins  to

drown.  In  the  first  round,  it

falls unconscious (0 hit points).

In the following round, it drops

to 1 hit points and is dying. In

the  third  round,  if  still  in  the

drowning aura, it drowns.

Unholy  Toughness  (Ex):

A drowned gains a bonus to its

hit points equal to its Charisma

modi er  its Hit Dice.

Skills:  A  drowned  has  a  +8

racial bonus on any Swim check

to  perform  some  special  action

or  avoid  a  hazard.  It  can  always

choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even if distracted or endangered.

It  can  use  the  run  action  while

swimming,  provided  it  swims  in

a straight line.

DROWNED IN

EBERRON

Zarash  Bay  holds  one  of  Khorvaires

largest  ship  graveyards,  and  the  drowned

occasionally rise from the depths to trouble

the citizens of Zarashak, the City of Stilts,

to the north. The drowned are also known

to haunt Lantern Keep, a ruined stronghold

in the fetid swamp west of the bay. Ships

lost in the Straits of Shargon and Kraken

Bay have also led to troubling encounters

with drowned in southern Breland and

Darguun. The frontier city of Stormreach on

the northern tip of Xendrik has also faced the hungry wrath

of a drowned crew.

This haggard humanoid creature stands in a small cloud of dust.

Its stonelike features seem eroded and crumbling, like an ancient

statue battered by the elements.

Dust wights are hateful creatures formed by a conjunc-

tion of elemental earth and negative energy. They seek to

tear  down  and  destroy  all  creations  of  stone  and  metal,

and if they have to kill living creatures to do that, so much

the better.

A dust wight looks like a gaunt, human-sized earth ele-

mental with forever-crumbling features. Despite its worn

appearance, it weighs about 400 pounds.

Dust wights speak Terran.

COMBAT

A dust wight enters combat with its stonelike  sts  ying,

seeking to affect as many foes as possible with its petrifying

cloud. If it petri es a foe, it turns its attacks on that target,

battering the stony victim into rubble.

A dust wight normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 3 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +3 bonus

on damage rolls.

Crumbling Touch (Su): A dust wights slam attack, in

addition  to  dealing  damage,  weakens  objects  crafted  of

metal or stone. Each time a creature is struck by a slam

attack from a dust wight, any metal or stone armor worn by

the target takes 2d8+10 points of damage (Fortitude DC 23

half). If this attack destroys the armor, the dust wight gains

5 temporary hit points (which last for a maximum of 1 hour).

The save DC is Strength-based.

The dust wights slam attack deals double normal damage

against creatures or objects crafted of metal or stone, such

as a shield guardian or stone golem.

Petrifying Cloud (Su): A dust wight is surrounded by

a cloud of dusty particles. Any living creature that comes

within  5  feet  of  a  dust  wight  must  succeed  on  a  DC  18

Fortitude save or become petri ed one round later. During

the intervening round, the petri cation can be halted by

stone shape or move earth. A creature who saves successfully

against the petrifying cloud cant be affected again by that

dust wights petrifying cloud for 24 hours. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Elemental Turning Vulnerability (Ex): A character

who can turn undead and also turn earth creatures gains

a  +2  bonus  on  turning  checks  to  turn  a  dust  wight.  A

character who can rebuke undead and also rebuke earth

creatures gains a +2 bonus on turning checks to rebuke a

dust wight.

ELEMENTAL, STORM

A dark storm cloud crackles with lightning and reverberates with

the dull rumble of thunder.

The elemental incarnation of a living storm, a storm elemen-

tal displays the same sudden, violent nature as a tempest. It

seldom leaves its home plane unless summoned or called,

but when it does it is capable of great destruction.

When not on the Elemental Plane of Air, storm elemen-

tals seek out natural squalls and are happiest in the midst of

a raging thunderstorm.

Storm elementals speak Auran but rarely choose to do so.

A storm elementals voice sounds like distant thunder.

COMBAT

Storm elementals are very hearty, yet they prefer to fight

on  wild,  broken  terrain  where  they  can  avoid  obstacles

by flying. They stay airborne when possible, remaining

out of the reach of enemies. Their thunder and lightning

special ability gives them a ranged attack that most other

elementals lack.

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a 1 penalty

on attack and damage rolls against a storm elemental.

Shock  (Su):  Once  per  round  as  a  free  action,  a  storm

elemental can deliver an electrical shock to a single oppo-

nent within 10 feet. This attack deals nonlethal electricity

damage to living opponents (Fortitude half). The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Thunder and Lightning (Su): Once per minute as a full-

round action, a storm elemental can emit a blast of thunder

coupled with a bolt of lightning.

The thunder deals sonic damage (see chart) to all crea-

tures within 60 feet of the storm elemental. A Fortitude

save halves this damage.

The lightning is a 120-foot-long line that deals electricity

damage (see table). A Re ex save halves this damage.

The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Electrical and Sonic Healing (Ex): Storm elementals

take no damage from electricity and sonic attacks. Instead,

any electricity attack (such as shocking grasp or lightning bolt)

or sonic attack (such as sound burst) used against a storm ele-

mental heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage

the attack would otherwise deal. The storm elemental cant

heal hit points by attacking itself.

STORM ELEMENTALS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, storm elementals ravage

the plane of Kythri, where chaos holds sway. Storm elemen-

tals   nd  their  way  to  Eberron  whenever  Kythri  and  the

Material Plane are coterminous. The gnomes of Zilargo and

the drow of Xendrik occasionally use bound storm elemen-

tals to power vehicles and magic items, a tricky endeavor

given the elementals temperamental dispositions. On 15

Lharvion 997 YK in the city of Trolanport, a failed attempt

to bind a storm elemental to a House Lyrandar skyship

resulted in the deaths of four gnomish magewrights and

caused irreparable damage to the ship.

Ephemeral  swarms  are  the  ghostly  collections  of  many

little  creatures  that  suffered  a  common  death.  Just  as

when a spirit of a particular creature lingers on as a ghost,

when many small creatures die a violent death, they may

linger  on  as  a  vengeful  ephemeral  swarm.  The  undead

swarm is composed of the psychic agony and anguish of

the newly departed.

The physical appearance of the creatures in the swarm

corresponds to what was killed. Thus, in an area where a

plague  killed  all  the  cats,  the  ephemeral  swarm  will  look

like a pack of cats and kittens. If a  reball spell took out a

rats nest, the ephemeral swarm would seem to be a ghostly

rat swarm.

COMBAT

Almost all ephemeral swarms return from the dead seeking

to in ict pain and suffering similar to that which they expe-

rienced upon their deaths. If the agent of their destruction

is  visible  and  recognizable  by  the  creatures,  a  swarm  will

direct  its  efforts  toward  killing  him.  Otherwise,  a  swarm

surrounds and attacks any living prey it encounters.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to

an ephemeral swarms damage that begins its turn with

a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 20

Fortitude save negates the effect. Even after a successful

save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the

area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 +

spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentra-

tion requires a DC 20 Concentration check. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Strength Damage (Su): The swarm attack of an ephem-

eral  swarm  deals  1d6  points  of  Strength  damage  to  any

living  creature  whose  space  it  occupies  at  the  end  of  its

move. A creature reduced to Strength 0 by an ephemeral

swarm dies. This is a negative energy effect.

EPHEMERAL SWARMS IN EBERRON

Ephemeral swarms sometimes manifest in cities recover-

ing from a terrible animal or vermin infestation. These

undead swarms are the remnants of one or more swarms

that  were  previously  exterminated.  Ephemeral  swarms

are  also  encountered  in  the  ruined  strongholds  of  the

Dhakaani  Empire  and  the  haunted  halls  of  Nolunthrone,

a ruined dwarf city beneath the Ironroot Mountains in the

Mror Holds.

EPHEMERAL SWARMS IN FAERN

Ephemeral swarms haunt the Underdark and various dun-

geons scattered across Faern (see Known Dungeons of

Faern,  pages  293296  of  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign

Setting, for likely locations). They also haunt the labyrinthine

sewers of Faerns oldest cities, the Mulhorandi capital of

Skuld  in  particular.  Some  ephemeral  cat  swarms  found

under Skuld are particularly ancient and deal other types of

ability damage in addition to Strength damage.

shrunken, unhealthy black skin only in places, and open sores

dot its hide. A feral, narrow, catlike head swings low to the

ground, and you see a long, emaciated tail shifting behind the

creature as it walks.

Feral yowlers are the result of extreme experiments in nec-

romantic  magic  gone  awry.  Whether  originally  spawned

from  displacer  beasts,  panthers,  or  concocted  from  no

known  beast,  the   rst  feral  yowlers  were  warped  and

twisted by massive amounts of magical energy. Because of

these experiments, they not only developed an immunity

to  necromantic  magic,  they  also  gained  the  abilities  that

make them such deadly and ef cient killers. Feral yowlers

are ruthless predators, hunting not only for fun but also for

the thrill of the kill.

A  feral  yowler  measures  about  7  feet  long  and  weighs

roughly 400 pounds. While they love to yowl, feral yowlers

do not actually speak, though some learn to recognize a few

simple words of Goblin.

COMBAT

A lone feral yowler always tries to

ambush  its  prey.  When  it  does

strike,  it  begins  a  battle  with

its yowl of fear, hoping to distract

and weaken its foes. A feral yowler

then charges into combat, relying

on  rapid  attacks  to  bring  prey

down quickly.

A  feral  yowler  prefers  to

 ght  using  its  Power  Attack  feat,

typically taking a 3 penalty on its

attack rolls and gaining a +3 bonus

on damage rolls.

Trip  (Ex):  A  feral  yowler  that

hits with a bite attack can attempt

to  trip  its  opponent  (+5  check

modi er) as a free action without

making  a  touch  attack  or  pro-

voking  attacks  of  opportunity.

If  the  attempt  fails,  the  oppo-

nent  cannot  react  to  trip  the

feral yowler.

Feral yowler

Yowl  of  Fear  (Su):  Every

1d4  rounds,  a  feral  yowler  can

let  loose  a  wailing  yowl  that

strikes  fear  into  the  hearts  of  any

who  hear  it.  All  creatures  within  60

feet of a feral yowler that can hear its yowl

are  affected.  Each  creature  within  the  area  must

make a DC 16 Will save or be shaken for as long as

it remains within the area and for 2d4 rounds after.

A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune

to  that  feral  yowlers  yowl  for  24  hours.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Immunities  (Ex):  Feral  yowlers  are  immune  to  fear,

negative energy, and energy drain effects.

Minor Displacement (Su): A light-bending glamer con-

tinually surrounds a feral yowler, making it hard to surmise

the  creatures  true  location.  Any  melee  or  ranged  attack

directed  at  it  has  a  20%  miss  chance  unless  the  attacker

can locate the beast by some means other than sight. A true

seeing effect allows the user to see the beasts position, but

see invisibility has no effect.

Skills:  A  feral  yowler  has  a  +6  racial  bonus  on  Hide

checks and Move Silently checks.

FERAL YOWLERS IN EBERRON

Feral yowlers roam the Labyrinth, a maze of canyons and

 ssures that scars the landscape of the Demon Wastes. They

also inhabit forlorn ruins and dungeons throughout Khor-

vaire,  occasionally  striking  up  alliances  with  goblinoid

warlords in exchange for treasure or fresh food.

Level Adjustment: 

This  massive,  six-limbed  creature  stands  a  full  30  feet  tall.  Its

rough  gray  hide  is  covered  in  thick,  armored  plates  bulging

with  spiky  protrusions  that  resemble  oversized  caltrops.  The

creatures  head  is  sunken  between  its  massive  shoulders,  and

each of its four arms has two elbow joints, giving the creature a

rolling, smooth gait.

Geriviars  are  nomadic  giants  that  have  a  burning  hatred

to destroy anyone who encroaches on their desolate lands.

Geriviars  lurk  in  hostile  environments,  preferring  rough

mountains  or  inhospitable  marshes.  Wherever  they  lair,

geriviars typically seek isolation, whether as solitary crea-

tures or in small family units. Some members of the race

have  been  pressed  into  service  in  armies,  acting  as  living

siege weapons.

These  spiky  giants  are  extremely  hostile  to  any  other

creature  they  perceive  as  a  threat,  which  includes  almost

anything else that moves. They especially distrust any race

or creature that seeks to stake a claim on the land by build-

ing  permanent  structures  on  it.  Geriviars  have  an  incred-

ible loathing for buildings of any sort, viewing a permanent

structure almost as a personal affront.

Geriviars  are  tenacious  and  uncompromising  in  nearly

every  endeavor.  Once  a  geriviar  undertakes  a  task  or

makes up its mind to accomplish something, only death

or an incredible will can prevent it from following the task

through to its completion.

This odd behavior, combined with a geriviars unique set

of abilities, has led many scholars to surmise that geriviars

were originally engineered beings, created by warlords in

times long past as mobile siege engines. Since they are emi-

nently suited for such an occupation, few who have seen a

geriviar in action can refute these claims.

Geriviars rarely stay in one place for long, possessed of a

nearly insatiable paranoia that someone might be building

on the lands they currently inhabit.

Geriviars, like many giants, carry their treasure in a sack

or other container, as long as its portable. They dress in just

enough  clothing  to  stave  off  the  cold,  which  they  do  not

prefer, and some geriviars wear armor and wield weapons,

although most prefer their natural attacks.

A geriviar stands between 25 and 30 feet tall and weighs

about  twelve  tons.  Their  minimal  body  hair  is  typically

black,  and  their  skin  ranges  in  tones  of  gray.  Geriviars

speak Giant.

COMBAT

A  geriviar  strikes  from  a  distance,  attempting  to  whittle

down an opponents strength with thrown rocks and explod-

ing nodules before engaging in melee. Once in close combat,

it uses its Improved Sunder feat to destroy an enemys weap-

ons,  or  its  Improved  Bull  Rush  feat  to  send  enemies  over

cliffs or into deadly patches of marsh ground.

Batter (Ex): A geriviar is especially ferocious and adept

at attacking unattended objects. When attacking such an

object, it ignores half the items hardness. This ability does

not allow a geriviar to ignore half an items hardness when it

makes sunder attempts.

Exploding  Nodules  (Ex):  A  geriviars  body  is  covered

with spherical, spiny nodules that range between 1 and 2

feet in diameter. Each of these nodules is  lled with small

fragments  of  the  armored  plates  covering  the  geriviars

body, as well as a volatile, explosive liquid secreted through

the giants skin. A geriviar can break off up to two of these

nodules each round (until it runs out) and hurl them at its

opponents as a standard action.

Each  nodule  is  a  grenadelike  weapon  that  deals  5d6

points of piercing damage and 5d6 points of fire damage

in a 10-foot spread (DC 31 Reflex half). The save DC is

Constitution-based.

A healthy geriviar normally carries twelve nodules at a

given  time.  Nodules  take  3d6  minutes  to  grow  back  once

broken off. A geriviar can regrow multiple nodules at the

same time. However, if a geriviars regeneration is negated

somehow, it takes 2 to 3 days to regrow.

Rock Throwing (Ex): A geriviar can hurl rocks of 60

to 80 pounds (Medium objects) up to 160 feet. A geriviar

can throw up to two rocks per round, using two of its four

arms to lift them from the ground or its sack, and two to

hurl them.

7/13/04   5:02:53 PM

Spell-Like  Abilities:  3/dayreverse  gravity,  telekinesis

(DC 19); 1/dayinvisibility, shout (DC 18), stone shape. Caster

level 20th.

Immunities (Ex): Geriviars have immunity to disease,

mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison,  re, and sonic.

Leap (Ex): Geriviars can always take 10 on Jump checks.

Also, if a geriviar leaps down from a great height, a success-

ful DC 15 Jump check negates the damage from the  rst 60

feet of the fall, as opposed to the  rst 10 feet.

Regeneration (Ex): Acid and cold deal normal damage

to a geriviar. If a geriviar loses a limb or body part, the

lost  portion  regrows  in  3d6  minutes.  The  creature  can

reattach  the  severed  member  instantly  by  holding  it  to

the stump.

Rock  Catching  (Ex):  A  geriviar  can  catch  rocks  (or

projectiles of similar shape). Once per round, a geriviar

that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex

save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small

rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the

projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls,

the  DC  increases  by  that  amount.)  A

geriviar  must  be  ready  for  and

aware  of  the  attack  in  order

to  make  a  rock  catch-

ing attempt.

Sprint  (Ex):  A

geriviar  can  sprint

on  all  six  limbs.  A

geriviar  that  takes

the  run  action

moves  six  times

its speed.

GERIVIAR

SOCIETY

Many geriviars seek out a

solitary  existence,  lurk-

ing  in  isolated  places,  pa-

trolling their territories, and

repelling  invaders.  Others

form small familial bands. These groups

of related geriviars roam as a unit. Those

unable  to  keep  pace  with  the  group,

whether  due  to  infirmity,  a  fester-

ing wound, or old age (a rare state

indeed  for  a  geriviar)  are  simply

left  behind.  In  a  battle,  however,

those  geriviars  that  have  com-

mitted  to  the  family  structure

devote  themselves  to  the  idea

absolutely,   ghting  tenaciously

to the death to defend an attacked

member of the band.

The pathological rage geriviars have for structures leads

them to immediate violence against creatures they encoun-

ter who have built on their territory.

Geriviars have been known to join (voluntarily or other-

wise) military divisions in need of siege experts. Some of

the giants even enjoy the duties involved, since it gives them

the opportunity to destroy the buildings they so thoroughly

loathe. Such geriviars require a stern and uncompromising

commander,  however.  When  the  time  to  retreat  sounds,

such a leader will always be hard-pressed to pry a geriviar

from its task.

Unlike many of their giant kin, geriviars rarely take slaves.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

A geriviar typically begins combat invisible, hoping to catch

its opponents unaware. It prefers to  ght from a distance as

long as possible, weakening its enemies with ranged attacks

and  delaying  them  with  its  spell-like  abilities  despite  its

amazing melee pro ciency.

Prior to combat: Invisibility.

Round 1: Throw rocks or exploding nodules at apparent

ranged attackers, such as spellcasters or archers.

GERIVIARS

IN EBERRON

The  ancient  goblinoid  em-

pires of Khorvaire used gerivi-

ars as living siege engines, and

a  few  survive  to  the  present  day

in  Darguun,  defending  Ruukhan

Draal  and  other  large  goblin  settle-

ments.  Free  geriviars  also  roam  se-

cluded valleys in the Mror Holds and

Lhazaar  Principalities,  attacking  all

they encounter.

Geriviar

GERIVIARS IN FAERN

Geriviars dwell in the region bounded

by  the  Maerthwatch (a crescent-shaped

chain  of  mountains  and  craggy  hills  south

of  Chessenta),  the  Black  Ash  Plain,  and  the

Chondalwood.  Small  family  groups  of  geriviars  claim

the Black Ash Plain or have migrated southward, cutting a

narrow swath east of the Landrise. Some have drifted as far

south as the Great Rift, where their territorial claims are

more hotly contested by the indigenous inhabitants.

Challenge Rating: 16

Treasure: Standard

Alignment: Always neutral evil

Advancement: By character class

Level Adjustment: 

This heavily armored, gaunt giant has pointed ears and dark

gray skin. Its hands end in long yellow claws, and its snarl shows

sharp fangs. It is surrounded by a thin fog of swirling vapor, and

as you watch, the cloud forms into tormented faces that scream

in terror and pain.

Death giants are a race of terribly evil giants that, in order to

preserve their empire from destruction, traded the immor-

tal souls of every one of their kind in exchange for unholy

power. It was a poor bargain, and the death giants now live

with the mistake of their ancestors.

The souls of death giants are bound for destruction on

the Negative Energy Plane, and their link to that profane

realm grants them spell-like abilities and great power over

the souls of others.

Death giants have dark gray to black skin and yellow eyes.

Like stone giants, they lack hair; unlike most giants, their

ears come to a point. Their unkempt nails form hard claws,

and their teeth are sharp. A death giant stands about 15 feet

tall and weighs 2,000 pounds.

Death giants speak Giant and Common.

COMBAT

Death giants are fearsome melee opponents and powerful

spellcasters. They prefer to cast spells in combat situations

but reserve some for opportune tactics and healing.

Frightful  Keening  (Su):  As  a  standard  action,  a  death

giant  can  trigger  the  guardian  souls  that  waft  around  its

body to wail in frightful anguish. Living creatures within

100  feet  that  hear  this  keening  must  make  a  DC  30  Will

save. Success indicates that the creature is shaken until it

can no longer hear the keening or moves out of range. Fail-

ure causes the creature to be panicked for as long as it can

hear the keening and remains within range, and shaken for

24 hours afterward.

Ending the frightful keening is a standard action. This

is  a  sonic,  mind-affecting  fear  ability.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Rock  Throwing  (Ex):  Death  giants  are  accomplished

rock  throwers  and  gain  a  +1  racial  bonus  on  attack  rolls

when throwing rocks. A death giant can hurl rocks of 60 to

80 pounds (Medium objects) up to  ve range increments.

The range increment is 120 feet for a death giants rocks.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  3/daygreater  dispel  magic,  in ict

critical wounds (+27 melee touch, DC 21), unholy blight (DC

21); 1/day ame strike (DC 22). Caster level 16th.

Steal Soul (Su): Any living creature with 10 or fewer hit

points within 15 feet of a death giant must succeed on a DC

30 Fortitude save each round or die instantly. This is a death

effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Any creature that dies within 15 feet of a death giant has

its  spirit  sucked  up  into  the  swirling  guardian  souls  that

protect the death giant. Such creatures cannot be raised,

resurrected, or reincarnated so long as the death giant lives.

Killing the death giant releases the souls.

If a living death giant is within 15 feet of a death giant

that dies, the souls are not released and are instead trans-

ferred to the nearby death giant due to its steal soul ability.

Under extraordinary circumstances, a living death giant

may release a soul it has captured.

Guardian  Souls  (Su):  A  death  giants  victims  become

its guardians in death. Each death giant is surrounded by a

constantly swirling cloud of intangible spirits.

These  spirits  provide  the  death  giant  with  warnings

and protection, granting the creature a bonus on initia-

tive rolls, saves, Listen checks, and Spot checks equal to

its Charisma modifier.

A death giants will binds its guardian souls to it. They

are not ghosts or undead in the usual sense and cannot

be damaged, dispelled, or separated from the death giant.

Only a successful turning attempt can quell these spirits

for a time. If the turning attempt would turn or rebuke

an undead with Hit Dice equal to the death giants, the

guardian  souls  vanish  for  1d10  rounds,  and  the  death

giant  loses  the  benefits  of  its  guardian  souls,  frightful

keening,  soul  healing,  and  steal  soul  abilities  until  the

souls return.

Rock Catching (Ex): Once per round, a death giant that

would  normally  be  hit  by  a  rock  (or  projectile  of  similar

shape)  can  make  a  Re ex  save  to  catch  it  as  a  free  action.

7/13/04   5:02:59 PM

7/13/04   5:02:59 PM

The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25

for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus

on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant

must be ready for and aware of the attack in order to make a

rock-catching attempt.

Sold  Soul  (Ex):  A  death  giant  cannot  be  raised,  res-

urrected,  or  reincarnated.  If  a  death  giants  soul  is  not

taken as a guardian soul by another death giant or kept

from departing by some other means (such as soul bind),

it is utterly destroyed 1 round after the giants death.

Soul Healing (Su): When a death giant is protected by

its guardian souls, hit point damage due to negative ener-

gy (such as from an in ict spell) heals rather than harms

a death giant. Death giants are healed by positive energy

(such as from cure spells) normally.

DEATH GIANT SOCIETY

Death giants live in the ruins of their once-great civilization,

scattered across the desert following the wars that brought

their  empires  to  ruin.  Capable  of  using  magic  to  provide

for themselves, death giants have allowed their culture and

skills to atrophy. They create weapons and armor for the often

intense  soul-trading  battles  between  various  groups,  but

otherwise spend their time seeking a way to rid themselves

of their races curse while maintaining their powers.

DEATH GIANTS

WITH CLASS LEVELS

A death giants favored class is  ghter. Death giant clerics

are very rare and worship dark and alien deities that dont

care  if  the  souls  of  their  followers  reach  them.  The

giant deities abandoned the death giants when they

decided  to  sell  the  souls  of  their  race,  although

some death giants still pay homage to them.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

A  death  giant  seeks  to  soften  up  its  opponents  with  its

frightful keening and spells before entering melee.

Round 1: Frightful keening.

Round  2:  Use  unholy  blight  on  shaken  foes.  If  no  foes

appear shaken, charge into melee.

Round 3: Use  ame strike on foes that are both shaken by

the frightful keening and sickened by the unholy blight. If

only one or two foes are shaken and sickened, enter melee,

focusing on foes that resisted the effects.

Round  4:  Charge  the  foe  most  damaged  by  the   ame

strike,  or  make  a  full  attack  on  the  weakest  foe  if  it  is

already in melee.

Round 5: If still in a position of strength, continue the

attack, only using inflict critical wounds on a shaken foe if

it is having trouble hitting with its full attack. If in a po-

sition of weakness, use inflict critical wounds to heal and

attempt to intimidate foes into accepting a truce, perhaps

bargaining the release of the soul of a fallen foe.

DEATH GIANTS IN EBERRON

Death giants haunt cyclopean ruins deep in the wilds

of  Xendrik,  surrounded  by  the  shattered  remains

of a once-proud civilization of giants brought to ruin by

dragons  and  their  own  hubris.  A  few  death  giants  have

found their way to other continents, such as Argonnessen

and  Khorvaire,  although  their  hatred  of  other  creatures

demands  that  they  live  in  isolation.  At  least  two  death

giantsa  pair  of  sisters  named  Arakajda  and  Behkorr

prowl the Mournland searching for souls to steal.

In an EBERRON campaign, the souls of death giants are

bound  to  the  plane  of  Mabar,  the  Endless  Night.  Some

death giants aim to release their souls from the dark grasp

of Mabar, allowing them passage to Dolurrh, the Realm of

the Dead, when the end comes.

DEATH GIANTS IN FAERN

Ash giants (as death giants were once known) lived among

the  humans  of  Netheril.  When  the  Netherese  empire

crumbled in the wake of the phaerimm onslaught, the

ash  giants  surrendered  their  immortal  souls  to

some great power to ensure their own survival,

forsaking  their  human  allies.  What

used to be Netheril survives in

the  present  day  as  the  great

desert of Anauroch, and death

giants inhabit various ancient

Netherese ruins.

GIANT, ELDRITCH

This  giant  resembles  a  well-formed  human  of  enormous  pro-

portions. Its skin is tinged with a faint purple hue, and strange

arcane symbols are tattooed onto nearly every inch of its flesh.

It has light hair and eyes that seem to change color from blue to

green to violet.

Eldritch giants are powerful scions of arcane lore.

Ancient creatures fallen from what was once great

power,  eldritch  giants  spend  countless  years

seeking  out  fragments  of  arcane  knowledge.

Although  they  are  sel sh  and  cruel,  eldritch

giants are smart enough to bargain fairly

when they must and perceptive enough

to  know  that  open  con ict  distracts

them from their studies.

Eldritch  giants  hate  storm

giants, although they are typically

too involved in their pursuit of

magical  power  to  bother  with

 ghting other creatures.

An  adult  eldritch  giant  is  25

feet  tall  and  weighs  about  13,000

pounds.  Eldritch  giants  have

incredible  life  spans  and  can  live

to be more than 3,000 years old.

Eldritch  giants  speak  Abyssal,

Common, Giant, and Terran.

COMBAT

An  eldritch  giant  uses  its  spell-

like abilities to strip opponents

of  their  magical  enhancements

before  entering  melee  combat.

Although its size forces it to  ght

in relatively open environments, an

eldritch giants ability to use dimension door makes

it capable of devastating hit-and-run tactics.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect magic, greater dispel

magic, magic missile; 3/daydimension door, globe of invulner-

ability. Caster level 20th.

Eldritch Mastery (Su): An eldritch giant has an exten-

sive familiarity with and an intuitive grasp of arcane magic.

It can use spell completion items (such as scrolls) as if it had

the wizards class spell list and were of the appropriate level

to cast the spell. It can use spell trigger items (such as wands

and staffs) as if it had the wizards class spell list.

Natural Willpower (Ex): Unlike most giants, eldritch

giants have a strong innate resistance to mental compulsion,

illusion magic, and the like. Eldritch giants have a +6 racial

bonus on Will saves.

Round 1: Use a quickened greater dispel magic on the foe

with the most magical auras and charge the nearest foe.

If unable to close, instead use an empowered magic missile

followed  by  a  quickened  dimension  door  to  get  close  to  a

spellcasting opponent.

Round 2: Continue melee combat, using

quickened greater dispel magic to strip foes of

their magical enhancements.

Round  3:  If  no  foes  are  within

melee  reach,  use  empowered  magic

missile  or  dimension  door  to  attack

elusive opponents.

Round  4:  If  the  foes  are  still

mounting  a  credible  threat,  retreat

using  dimension  door.  Other wise,

alternate  intelligent  use  of  spells

with full attacks.

ELDRITCH GIANT

CONFESSOR

Schemers and manipulators even

among  their  own  people,  eldritch

giant  confessors  have  chosen  the

path of divine magic rather than a

direct study of arcane power. These

giants pull together others of their

kind  through  deceit,  manipula-

tion, and bullying. Eldritch giant

confessors believe in the divinity

of  magic  itself,  justifying  their

cruel  actions  with  a  philosophy

that  proclaims  that  whatever

you  can  accomplish  through

magic is morally correct.

The  eldritch  giant  con-

fessor  presented  here  had  the

following ability scores before racial adjustments

and Hit Dice ability score increases: Str 12, Dex 8,

Eldritch giant

Con 14, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 13.

Combat

Eldritch giant confessors herd lesser giants before them into

battle. Although these cruel creatures have great con dence

in their physical and magical abilities, they place little value

in the lives of lesser creatures, even other eldritch giants.

Eldritch giant confessors carefully enhance their own abili-

ties with spells before and during a  ght, especially favoring

the use of quickened spells such as divine favor that enhance

their  physical  combat  abilities.  They  gain  a  +2  bonus  on

all  turn/rebuke  undead  attempts  due  to  their  Knowledge

(religion) skill.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

An  eldritch  giant  is  most  effective  as  a  melee  combatant,

but it bene ts greatly from spending a few rounds using its

spell-like abilities to strip away the magic effects of its foes.

Prior to Combat: Scout foes with detect magic and activate

ELDRITCH GIANT SOCIETY

Eldritch giants dwell in isolated mountaintop towers or in

deep  caverns  near  wellsprings  of  arcane  power.  They  are

greatly  interested  in  arcane  magic,  and  they  spend  much

of their time researching spells, searching for lost items of

power, or crafting magic items of their own creation. Only a

few eldritch giants typically dwell in the same place, drawn

together by shared interest in specialized or esoteric knowl-

edge  about  one  facet  of  arcane  magic.  Groups  of  eldritch

giants  rarely  live  close  to  others  of  their  kind,  driven  to

remote regions to look for fragments of lost lore or for other

strange  purposes.  On  rare  occasions,  eldritch  giants  will

seek out civilized lands in order to buy large quantities of

raw materials such as paper, ink, and the rare materials used

to create magic items.

GIANT, SAND

This dark-skinned giant looks like an oversized, muscular human

with tan hair and eyes.

Disciplined and cautious, sand giants are respected, honor-

able desert-dwellers.

A sand giants hair can be black, brown, tan, or blond, and

its eyes usually match its hair color. Its skin ranges from a

deep chocolate brown to pale beige.

Sand  giants  prefer  loose,  light  garments  in  colors  that

harmonize with their desert landscape, such as sandy beige,

white, dusty red, and khaki. They avoid wearing bulky or

metal armor, preferring leather or studded leather in the

hot desert.

An adult male is about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000

pounds. Females are slightly larger and heavier, but otherwise

identical with males. Sand giants can live to be 250 years old.

Sand giants speak Common and Giant.

COMBAT

A  sand  giant  usually  prepares  for  com-

bat by digging into the sand and

hiding to lure its opponents in

close, readying its sand blast-

er  to  spray  its  enemies.  In

close  com bat,  a  sand

giant wields its mighty

scimitar.

Sand  Blaster:  A

sand blaster is a Large

exotic  ranged  weapon

made  from  long  tubes.

It  creates  a  10-foot  cone  of

sand, doing 1d8 points of dam-

age  (Re ex  DC  22  half).  Living

creatures  that  fail  their  saves  are

tormented  by  itching  skin  and

burning eyes, imposing a 4 pen-

alty to AC and a 2 penalty on attack

rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-

based. (It relies on the users ability to blow a hearty

gust of air through the tube.) A sand blaster uses 5

pounds of sand as ammunition, and packing a

sand blaster with one charge of ammunition

is  a  full-round  ac-

tion.  A  sand  blaster

costs 30 gp.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/daymeld into stone,

statue. Caster level 15th.

Heat Shimmer (Su): At will as a free action, a sand giant

can create a shimmering effect around itself that functions

like a blur spell, caster level 15th.

Skills:  *A  sand  giant  gains  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Hide

checks and Survival checks in deserts.

Such trained warriors often serve the monarch as his or

her personal guard.

The sand giant champion presented here had the follow-

ing  ability  scores  before  racial  adjustments  and  Hit  Dice

ability score increases: Str 15, Dex 8, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 13,

Cha 12.

Combat

A sand giant champion attacks with great skill and optimizes

its tactics. It uses its Spring Attack to selectively attack oppo-

nents,  maneuvering  to  its  advantage.  It  uses  Power  Attack

judiciously against opponents with a lower Armor Class.

Sand Blaster: Re ex DC 25 half.

SAND GIANT SOCIETY

Sand giants live in stable communities in the desert. Their

lives revolve around ordered discipline. Their desert dwell-

ings exhibit careful organization and a layout that empha-

sizes defensibility. They often build into the side of a mesa

or in some other geographically sheltered area.

Sand giant leadership originates from a hereditary mon-

archy.  The  next  king  or  queen  is

the   rst-born  child  of

the  present  monarch.

A complicated line of

succession  based  on

blood  relations  and  birth  order

dictates  the  order  of  the  heirs

beyond the  rst.

Most  sand  giant  commu-

nities are isolated in the desert,

but the giants are by no means

isolationists. They usually con-

duct profitable trades with cara-

vans  and  travelers.  Occasionally,

a sand giant will act as a guide for

travelers in the harsh desert.

SAND GIANTS

AS CHARACTERS

Logical  and  lawful,  sand  giants  have  a  com-

plex  society  that  interrelates  well  with

humanoids.

SAND GIANTS IN EBERRON

Sand  giants  inhabit  the  vast  desert  on  the  continent  of

Xendrik. Although sand giant clans generally lead nomadic

lives, a few clans maintain permanent dwellings carved into

towering spires of sand-sculpted rock that thrust up from

the desert wasteland.

SAND GIANTS IN FAERN

Sand giants once roamed all of southern Faern, as far west

as the Calim Desert and as far east as Raurin and the Plains

of Purple Dust. The largest settlements of sand giants can

be found in Raurin, near the Giants Belt. The sand giants

must periodically defend themselves against incursions by

eldritch giants and their enslaved goblinoid minions.

GLAISTIG

A staggeringly beautiful maiden stands waist-deep in the water,

swaying back and forth as she sings a haunting song.

Beautiful and enchanting, glaistigs are fey that lurk in and

around  pools,  lakes,  and  streams.  They  have  an  insatiable

craving for the blood of mortals, beguiling victims to come

close  to  their  lair  in  order  to  drain  them.  They  are  com-

monly mistaken for vampires because of their bloodsucking

technique, but they are not undead.

Glaistigs  resemble  incredibly  attractive  female  humans

or half-elves, but instead of normal legs, they have goat legs

with long, white fur. Most have snow-white hair and eyes that

shimmer like water. When they smile, glaistigs try not to

show their teeth, which are sharpened to cruel-looking fangs

and revealed only when they are about to strike. Glaistigs

wear long,  ne robes and dresses that drape along the ground,

which are used to hide their legs. Glaistigs loathe showing

their legs to anyone, and will only reveal them to lash out in

anger. If someone catches sight of a glaistigs goat legs, it will

become very angered and attack the offender.

Despite their single-minded lust for blood, glaistigs are

unpredictable and capricious. If they have recently fed (say,

within a month), then they are just as likely to help some-

one as they are to attack. More than a few people have been

attacked by a glaistig, even if it has talked and been friendly

to them in the past. Glaistigs also enjoy dancing, and some

lure their victims to caper and dance for many hours before

attacking them.

Glaistigs  are  solitary  by  nature  and  do  not  even

like  other  fey  all  that  much.  While  they

gain  no  sustenance  from  the  blood  of

sylvan  creatures,  glaistigs  have  been

known to attack fey that come too

close  into  their  territory.  Per-

haps because of their similar

nature, glaistigs in particular

do  not  like  dryads,  and  it  is

extremely  rare  to  find  the

two  beings  in  the  same  ter-

ritory. An average glaistig is

about 5 feet 2 in height and

weighs about 90 pounds.

Glaistigs  speak  Com-

mon, Elven, and Sylvan.

COMBAT

A glaistig uses its beguiling

song to lure victims close to

the  water,  targeting  speci c

individuals. If a large group comes

close to its lair, it will lurk beneath

the surface until only one or two targets remain.

A glaistig is mystically bound to its watery lair and cannot

move more than 300 yards away from it.

Once  a  victim  is  within  striking  distance,  a  glaistig

will  cease  singing  and  grapple  the  opponent.  If  the  grab

is successful, it will drain blood for as long as possible. If

Glaistig

60

reinforcements arrive, the glaistig will try to use suggestion,

hypnotism, or fog cloud to cause a diversion and slip beneath

the surface of its watery home.

Beguiling Song (Su): A glaistig can attempt to beguile

creatures with its song. A glaistig sings, targeting a single

creature it can see within 300 yards of the body of water to

which it is linked (see Water Symbiosis, below). This is a sonic

charm effect, and the creature must be able to hear the glaistig

for it to take effect. The targeted creature must make a DC 19

Will saving throw. A creature that successfully saves cannot

be affected again by the same glaistigs song for 24 hours.

Failure  indicates  the  creature  is  beguiled  and  moves

toward the glaistig, taking the most direct route available.

If that path leads into a dangerous area (such as very deep

or fast-moving water), the beguiled creature gets a second

saving throw. If that save is successful, the beguiling effect

is  broken,  and  that  creature  cannot  be  affected  by  that

glaistigs song for 24 hours.

A glaistig that desires a companion often moves out of the

water and bestows water breathing upon its beguiled victim

so it can take him underwater. A beguiled creature takes

no actions other than to defend himself. (Thus, a  ghter

cannot run away or attack, but takes no defensive penalties.)

A beguiled victim that moves within 5 feet of the glaistig

must make a DC 19 Will saving throw or be charmed, as

by the charm monster spell cast by an 8th-level sorcerer. A

creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by

the same glaistigs song for 24 hours. The beguiling effect

continues so long as the glaistig sings. A glaistig does not

need to continue singing to keep a victim charmed.

A  glaistig  can  use  its  beguiling  song  both  above

and below the water. Most glaistigs move into deep

water,  forcing  a  beguiled  victim  to  move  toward

them. If these unlucky creatures fail their second

saving throw, they usually drown (see page 304

of  Dungeon  Masters  Guide).  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Blood Drain (Ex): A glaistig can

suck  blood  from  a  living  victim

with  its  fangs  by  making  a  suc-

cessful  grapple  check.  If  it

pins the foe, it drains blood,

dealing 1d4 points of Con-

stitution drain each round

the pin is maintained.

Spell-Like  Abilities:

At  willdancing  lights,

fog  cloud,  hypnotism  (DC  15),

suggestion  (DC  17);  1/daywater

breathing. Caster level 8th.

Water Breathing (Ex): A glaistig can

breath either water or air.

Water Symbiosis (Su): Each glaistig is mysti-

cally bound to a body of water or a waterway as small as a pond

or as large as a lake or river. A glaistig cannot move more than

300 yards away from its body of water and still breathe nor-

mally. If a glaistig strays farther away, it must hold its breath

or immediately start to suffocate (see Suffocation, page 304

of the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide).  Once  a  glaistig  has  moved

beyond  the  boundary  of  its  connection,  it  cannot  breathe

normally until it has immersed itself in its body of water.

Skills: Glaistigs have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Sense

Motive checks. A glaistig has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.

It  can  always  choose  to  take  10  on  a  Swim  check,  even  if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

GLAISTIG MINDBENDER

Naturally inclined toward magic and enchantments of all

kinds,  many  glaistigs  become  sorcerers  that  specialize  in

mind-bending  magic.  They  use  these  abilities  to  enhance

their chances of luring prey to their watery homes.

The glaistig sorcerer presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments and Hit Dice ability score

increases: Str 8, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 15.

Combat

The save DCs for this glaistig sorcerers beguiling song (DC

22) and spell-like abilities (hypnotism DC 18, suggestion DC

20) are adjusted for its higher Charisma score.

Typical  Sorcerer  Spells  Known:  (6/8/6):  0daze*  (DC

2nddaze  monster*  (DC  20),  touch  of  idiocy  (+5  melee

touch; DC 19).

GLAISTIGS IN EBERRON

Glaistigs are found throughout Khorvaire. They haunt the

rivers, lakes, and woodland streams of the Shadow Marches,

Droaam, Breland, the Mror Holds (particularly near Mirror

Lake), and Valenar. Valenar elf warriors often hunt glaistigs

for sport, taking their hooves as trophies.

This  humanoid  is  slightly  larger  than  a  human  and  a  little

broader.  It  has  short,  dirty,  brown  and  red  fur  covering  its

hyenalike head.

These  powerful  and  merciless  relatives  of  the  gnolls  are

often found in gnoll bands as leaders or elite hunters. While

gnolls admire and respect them,  inds have no great love for

their lesser cousins.

A   ind  appear  much  like  a  gnoll,  though  it  is  a  little

shorter  and  broader.  It  stands  roughly  7  feet  tall  and

weighs 300 to 350 pounds. A  inds forehead does not slope

back as far, and its ears are more rounded than those of an

ordinary gnoll.

Flinds speak Gnoll and Common.

COMBAT

The merciless  inds are clever tacticians, preferring to use

surprise, terrain, and superior numbers to their advantage.

When  commanding  gnoll  hunting  parties,  they  have  no

qualms about sacri cing their cousins for personal gain.

Flindbar:  A   indbar  resembles  a  pair  of  chain-linked

iron bars, not unlike a  ail. This one-handed exotic weapon

costs  30  gp,  deals  2d4  points  of  bludgeoning  damage,  has

a threat range of 1920, deals double damage on a critical

hit, and weighs 2 pounds. Flinds treat a  indbar as a martial

weapon instead of an exotic weapon.

The  wielder  of  a   indbar  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  opposed

attack  rolls  made  to  disarm  an  enemy  (including  the  roll

to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). If a pro-

 cient wielder threatens a critical hit, he can make a free

disarm  attempt  against  that  opponent  before  con rming

the critical hit (this disarm attempt doesnt provoke attacks

of opportunity).

Skills: A  ind has a +2 racial bonus on Charisma-based

checks made to in uence gnolls.

FLINDS AS CHARACTERS

Flind  leaders  are  usually  rangers  or  blackguards.  Flind

clerics typically worship Erythnul, deity of slaughter.

Flind characters possess the following racial traits.

 +6 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution.

A  inds base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Goatfolk

An amalgam of goat and human, this creature has a furry chest

and legs that end in hooves.

Goatfolk  are  powerfully  built  goatlike  creatures  that

resemble satyrs. Unlike their hedonistic and mischievous

fey  cousins,  goatfolk  are  much  more  physically  focused

creatures who favor a barbarian lifestyle.

Goatfolk choose leaders by combat, and the strongest and

most aggressive lead the pack. Thus, leadership is transitory

and prone to challenge. Both males and females assert them-

selves and hold these temporary positions of power.

These creatures call themselves ibixians, and races that

deal regularly with them use the proper name, but collo-

quially, theyve been dubbed goatfolk.

Goatfolk are bigger than most humans and almost all

satyrs, standing about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighing about

250 pounds.

Goatfolk speak Common and their own language, Ibixian.

COMBAT

Goatfolk enjoy melee combat. They often start  ghts for the

sheer pleasure of  ghting.

Pack Fervor (Ex): An ibixian loves to brawl with or along-

side others of its kind. Doing this increases its enjoyment of

GOATFOLK IN EBERRON

Goatfolk settlements tend to lie in out-of-the-way places. The

largest concentrations of ibixians can be found in the grassy

steppes and foothills surrounding the Blackcap Mountains

in  northern  Breland  and  southern  Aundair.  During  the

Last War, Aundair used conscripted goatfolk infantry units

against armies from Breland and Thrane. After witnessing

 rsthand the effectiveness of the ibixian troops, Breland fol-

lowed suit. In a battle known as the Clash of Horns, goatfolk

from  Aundair  faced  goatfolk  from  Breland  on  the   eld  of

battle. After a brief yet bloody skirmish, the ibixians on both

sides joined forces and turned against the armies of Aundair

and Breland. Both armies were routed, after which the sur-

viving goatfolk retreated to the Blackcaps. They remain in

hiding to this day, fearing reprisal for their treachery.

GOBLIN, FORESTKITH

This  small,  primatelike  humanoid  is  covered  in  stiff,  black  fur

except for its cruel and wild face.

These  nocturnal  hunters,  also  known  as  kith,  are  formi-

dable despite their small size. Though they can easily stand

upright, forestkith goblins tend to run and walk on all fours

in  a  manner  characteristic  of  primates,  perhaps  because

their  arms  are  longer  than  their  legs.  Their  mouths  sport

very sharp teeth, and each hand and foot brandishes long,

curved claws adapted for climbing. They spend most of their

time in trees.

Forestkith  goblins  hunt  most  creatures  that  travel

through  their  forest  territories,  ignoring  only  those  crea-

tures larger than a horse. In lean times, forestkith goblins

often  plan  and  execute  sophisticated  raids  on

humanoid  frontier  communities  for  food,

preferring snatch-and-run tactics target-

ing the young.

A  forestkith  goblin  stands  about

3  feet  tall  and  weighs  about  40

pounds.

Forestkith  goblins  speak

rudimentary  Goblin  but  are

illiterate.

COMBAT

Forestkith goblins excel at am-

bushes and use well-established

tactics to  t the prey they seek.

If  ghting a larger group, they

attack  the  weakest  members

with  nets   rst,  dragging  the

entangled victims away quick-

ly to feed on them before going

back for the rest.

Forestkith  goblins  attack

obviously  superior  foes  heed-

lessly with the same wild fren-

zy and loud, discordant screams

that paralyze their weaker foes with

fright. Their lust for the kill usually over-

whelms  concern  for  individual  safety.  Any

attack on a more numerous, stronger, or more so-

phisticated  foe  can  result  in  the  whole  forestkith  goblin

party being wiped out if it is not led by a druid kith elder,

who alone possesses the wisdom and leadership to order a

strategic retreat.

Discordant Frenzy (Ex): When melee ensues, forest-

kith goblins go into a frenzy, jumping about chaotically and

screaming loudly. Creatures with 2 HD or fewer within 30

feet  of  at  least  three  attacking  forestkith  goblins  become

shaken for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed on a DC 9 Will

save. A creature that resists the effect cannot be affected by

it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Forestkith goblins are dazzled in

bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Tree Shape (Su): A forestkith goblin can change form

into a small tree, shrub, or limb, equivalent to the tree shape

spell  as  cast  by  a  12th-level  druid.  A  forestkith  goblin

typically uses this ability at or near daybreak as a form of

camou age, due to its dislike for daylight.

A goblin cannot dismiss this effect, but it ends automati-

cally at sunset or if the goblin takes damage.

Skills: Forestkith goblins have a +2 racial bonus on Jump

checks. A forestkith goblin also has a +8 racial bonus on

Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened. *A forestkith goblin

gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks and Move Silently

checks in forested areas, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on

Craft (weaving) checks to create nets.

FORESTKITH

GOBLIN BARBARIAN

The best forestkith goblin hunters are

barbarians. Despite their small size,

these  creatures  are  potent  combat-

ants, as tough as any dwarf or

half-orc.

Combat

The save DC for this forestkith

goblin  barbarians  discordant

frenzy is DC 9.

Rage (Ex): Once per day,

this  forestkith  barbarian  can

enter a state of  erce rage that

lasts 7 rounds. The following

changes are in effect as long

as he rages: AC 15 (touch 11,

 at-footed 13); hp increase by

2;  Atk  +7  melee  (1d10+5/3,

greataxe)  or  +4  ranged  (spe-

cial, masterwork net); Full Atk

+7 melee (1d10+5/3, greataxe) or

+4  ranged  (special,  masterwork

net);  SV  Fort  +6,  Will  +3;  Str  19,

Con  18.  At  the  end  of  his  rage,  the

forestkith  barbarian  is  fatigued  for  the

remainder of the encounter.

Forestkith

FORESTKITH GOBLIN SOCIETY

Forestkith goblins do not have a sophisticated culture or

written language. The only tools they routinely make are

their  nets,  which  are  highly  prized  by  hunters  for  their

masterwork quality.

Forestkith  goblins  are  nomadic  hunters  and  have  no

established  home,  but  roam  a  well-de ned  territory,  usu-

ally 5 square miles per group member. Forestkith goblins

hunt until the rays of daylight make their way through the

forest canopy, whereupon they immediately go to sleep in

their tree shape wherever they are standing.

They operate with a semblance of pack unity and coordina-

tion only when executing ambushes or raids for food. Forest-

kith goblins encountered alone are usually social outcasts.

PLANAR GOLEMS

Planar golems, such as the gloom golem and prismatic golem,

are special kinds of constructs made from the matter of an Outer

Plane. Building one is a task suited only to those who can control

the very essences of the planes.

A planar golem may be constructed only on the plane from

which it is crafted. A spirit from the planar matter is trapped

by a powerful magic item and then bound to the creators will.

The matter is extremely difficult to shape, always destroying the

expensive item in the process.

Planar golems are notoriously difficult to control, because

planes have their own characteristics that override those of the

golems forgers. A planar golem takes on some traits of the plane

it comes from. The creator of the planar golem, as well as anyone

who would control it, must be of an alignment matching that of

the plane used to create the golem. If the controllers alignment

changes, the golem becomes uncontrolled until the controller

returns to the former alignment.

Planar golems have the extraplanar subtype unless on their

home plane. Planar golems otherwise follow the normal rules

for  golems  as  detailed  in  the  Monster  Manual  Golem  entry

Two types of planar golems are introduced in this book: the

gloom golem (from the Gray Waste of Hades) and the pris-

matic golem (from the Blessed Fields of Elysium). Other types

of planar golems can be created from the matter of other planes.

They include the following:

Amorphion (Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo): Comprised of

churning stone, water, fire, air, and color, an amorphion ema-

nates a continual aura of chaos that causes spells or spell-like

abilities in the affected area to go awry, as though affected by

the wild magic planar trait (see pages 149150 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide for details).

Ash Golem (Bleak Eternity of Gehenna): Made from the pyro-

clastic  ash  of  Gehenna,  this  golem  resembles  a  giant  ashen

skeleton surrounded by a cloud of blinding hot cinders.

Battleglory (Heroic Domains of Ysgard): This golem is made

from the bones, armor, and weapons of a dozen slain barbarians,

knitted into a single shambling form that fights relentlessly.

Gear Golem (Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus): A clockwork

creature, this precision golem grinds and ratchets implacably

toward its foes. It can grab foes and hold them against its whirl-

ing gears, grinding and crushing them.

Mindstrike Golem (Windswept Depths of Pandemonium):

This hideous golem feeds on sanity and resembles a 15-foot-long

worm composed of black blood. Its bite transforms its wounded

victims into screaming, deluded maniacs.

Perfector (Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia): This golem is

fashioned from polished silver and gold, perfectly formed into

the shape of an archon, formian, or other lawful being. It can

burn evil creatures with its luminous gaze, and its touch can also

lift curses and cure maladies.

Sentinel of Mithardir (Olympian Glades of Arborea): The body

of this golem resembles an elf formed out of chalky white dust

lifted from the endless desert of Mithardir, Arboreas third layer.

Lightning plays across the surface of the golem as it walks. In

battle, the golem can channel this electricity into its dusty fists

or hurl lightning bolts at distant foes.

Shacklelock Golem (Tarterian Depths of Carceri): This golem

resembles a shambling mass of chains, shackles, and manacles,

created to entwine and bind its foes.

Valorhammer (Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia): This

golem resembles a winged dwarf fashioned from pure white

alabaster and adorned with inlaid mithral filigree. It can smite

evil, and the mithral warhammer it wields is treated as a holy

merciful weapon in its stony hands alone.

Woodwrath Golem (Wilderness of the Beastlands): A rolling

mass of rustling leaves, sharpened twigs, and wooden spikes

deals piercing damage in addition to trampling its foes into

the ground.

give the creature life. An alchemical golem wears no cloth-

ing  and  has  no  possessions.  Despite  the  membrane  that

keeps the ingredients inside, the golem gives off a faint,

acrid smell.

An alchemical golem is 9 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds.

Alchemical golems cannot speak.

Combat

An alchemical golem can be a particularly dangerous oppo-

nent,  because  the  mere  act  of  damaging  it  releases  toxic

chemicals  that  burn  the  skin  and  choke  the  lungs.  Wise

combatants use ranged attacks against alchemical golems.

Acidic  Touch  (Ex):  An  alchemical  golems  surface

gleams with acid. The merest touch of the construct deals

2d6  points  of  acid  damage.  Any  creature  that  touches  an

alchemical  golem  (such  as  with  a  grapple  attack  or  touch

spell) takes this damage as well.

Berserk (Ex): The same noxious mixture of ingredients

that gives an alchemical golem life also makes it unstable.

When  an  alchemical  golem  enters  combat,  there  is  a

cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit

breaks  free  and  goes  berserk.  The  uncontrolled  golem

goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature,

or  smashing  an  object  smaller  than

itself if no creature is within reach,

then  moving  on  to  spread  more

destruction.  Once  the  golem

goes berserk, no known method

can reestablish control.

Breath Weapon (Su): 15-

foot cone, once every 1d4+1

rounds,  5d6  acid,  Re ex  DC

21  half.  All  creatures  in  the

toxic,  acidic  cone  must  also

make a DC 21 Fortitude save to

avoid breathing in the poisonous

fumes taking 2 points of Consti-

tution damage. The save DCs are

Constitution-based.

Alchemical  Healing  (Ex):

An alchemical golem does not heal

as  normal.  An  alchemical  golem  can

consume  a  large  barrel  of  a  special

alchemical  mixture  worth  500  gp

to restore itself to full hit points. It

takes 2 full rounds for an alchem-

ical golem to consume the liq-

uid. Because of this, creators

of  alchemical  golems  com-

monly leave a vat or two of this

substance near a golem in case it

is damaged.

Immunity  to  Magic  (Ex):  An  alchemical

golem is immune to all spells, spell-like abili-

ties,  and  supernatural  effects  that  allow  spell  resistance,

except as follows.

A neutralize poison spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6

rounds, with no saving throw.

A poison spell heals all its lost hit points.

Rupture (Ex): Any single hit that deals at least 10 points

of damage punctures an alchemical golems membrane. This

releases a spray of chemicals that  lls a 5-foot square in the

direction from which the attack originated, its effects are

identical to the breath weapon listed above. The membrane

then closes, reducing the spill to a mere trickle.

When an alchemical golem is reduced to 0 hit points (by

any source), the membrane collapses, spilling out all the

remaining chemicals. The noxious materials  ll a 15-foot

radius with the same effect as the breath weapon.

Construction

An  alchemical  golems  body  is  made  from  a  complex

series of noxious alchemical liquids poured into a tough,

humanoid-shaped membrane.

The golems cost includes 2,000 gp for the construction of

the body. Creating the body is a complex task that requires

a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.

CL 14th; Craft Construct (see page 206), geas/quest, limited

wish, poison, and polymorph any object, caster must be at least

14th level; Price 70,000 gp; Cost 36,000 gp + 2,720 XP.

ALCHEMICAL

GOLEMS IN EBERRON

Tzandro  Kavalant,  a  senior  mentor  at

the  Tower  of  Alchemy  in  Arca-

nix, teaches his pupils the secrets

of alchemical golem creation

secrets  he  learned,  allegedly,

from   esh-eating  witches  in

the Byeshk Mountains. Most

of  Khorvaires  most  gifted

alchemists  have  their  own

handwritten,  potion-stained

copy  of  Kavalants  Alcheme

(a  large  and  rambling  tome)

tucked  away  on  some  dusty

shelf, if not an alchemical golem

guarding their precious supplies.

ALCHEMICAL

GOLEMS IN FAERN

Alchemical  golems  are  prevalent

across  Faern,  usually  found

guarding wizards workshops and

dank dungeons. Some Faernian

alchemical  golems  have  modi-

 ed  breath  weapons  that  deal

other types of ability damage

instead  of  (or  in  addition  to)

Constitution  damage,  while

the  Red  Wizards  of  Thay  have  created  vari-

ants that spew great gouts of alchemists  re or

entangling goo (similar to that found in a tanglefoot bag)

instead of acid.

Level Adjustment: 

A gloom golem attacks with its two claws, although it can

wield weapons as well. Its preferred weapon is the spiked

chain. When using a spiked chain, a gloom golem gains 10

feet on its reach and gets a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls

made to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll

to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). It can also

use  the  spiked  chain  to  make  trip  attacks,  dropping  it  to

avoid being tripped if its own attempt to trip fails.

A gloom golems natural weapons, as well as any weap-

ons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the pur-

pose of overcoming damage reduction.

Crushing Despair (Su): Creatures with-

in  30  feet  of  a  gloom  golem  who  hear  its

incessant  howl  must  succeed  on  a  DC

16 Will save or take a 2 penalty on

attack  rolls,  saving  throws,  skill

checks, ability checks, and weapon

damage rolls. The penalties last un-

til the golem is destroyed, for only

then  is  the  victims  despair  lift-

ed. A good hope spell counters this

mind-affecting  compulsion.  The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Touch  of  Woe  (Ex):  A  crea-

ture  wounded  by  a  gloom  golem

must succeed on a DC 16 Will save

or  take  1d6  points  of  Charisma

drain.  As  the  creature  loses  Cha-

risma, it becomes more miserable

and withdrawn until, at 0 Charisma,

it  collapses  into  a  nightmare- lled

coma. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Skills: Due to its incessant howl-

ing,  a  gloom  golem  takes  a  10  pen-

alty on Move Silently checks.

This misshapen ogrelike brute has taut

flesh with a claylike texture. Howls of pain issue

from a gaping black orifice where its face should be. Tormented

visages press out from beneath its membranous skin, as though

other creatures trapped inside it were clamoring for release.

Gloom golem

Creatures  of  pure  malevolence  and  woe,  gloom  golems

haunt  the  layers  of  Hades,  thriving  on  the  misery  and

despair they inflict on others. The feelings of woe they

absorb  from  their  fallen  victims  manifest  as  tormented

visages  pressing  against  the  inside  of  their  skin.  How-

ever, gloom golems do not actually absorb the bodies of

their prey.

From a distance, a gloom golem could be mistaken for an

ogre, although up close it lacks  ner features. The gray sub-

stance that makes up its body comes from the three layers

of Hades and carries a foul stench. A gloom golem stands 10

feet tall and weighs 950 pounds.

Gloom golems howl incessantly but do not communicate.

68

Construction

A  gloom  golems  body  is  crafted

from a single block of clay taken from the banks

of the River Styx as it flows through the Gray Wastes of

Hades. The block weighs at least 1,000 pounds and costs

10,000  gp.  Assembling  the  body  requires  both  a  DC  21

Craft  (sculpting)  check  and  a  DC  21  Knowledge  (the

planes) check.

CL 11th; Craft Construct (see page 206), crushing despair,

limited wish, planar binding, polymorph any object, caster must

GLOOM GOLEMS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, gloom golems are created

on the plane of Mabar, the Endless Night, and are often

referred to as Mabarak golems or doomhowlers.

GLOOM GOLEMS IN FAERN

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, gloom golems

are created on the Barrens of Doom and Despair.

Two glowing eyes peer from this tall humanoid-shaped creature

composed of twisted ropes.

Also called rope golems, hangman golems are composed of

numerous ropes that are twisted and wrapped into the shape

of a humanoid  gure.

A  hangman  golem  stands  almost  twice  the  height  of  a

normal human, and its face is only a rough outline, with two

pure white globs of energy burning where the eyes would be.

A hangman golem cannot speak, but it expresses acknowl-

edgement of commands with the twisting of ropes. Hang-

man golems stand 10 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.

Combat

A hangman golem is a ferocious combatant that tries to close

with opponents before unleashing its rope whirlwind. If it

is guarding a location or object, it typically unravels itself to

appear like a long-disused rope to catch intruders by surprise.

Constrict (Ex): A hangman golem deals automatic slam

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  hangman

golem must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to

start  a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can constrict.

Rope Whirlwind (Ex): Every 1d4 rounds, a hangman

golem can extend a number of ropes and spin, making a

single slam attack against each creature within 10 feet. A

hangman golem cant use its improved grab ability in con-

junction with this ability.

Strangle (Ex): When a hangman golem grapples a living

opponent, it can make a strangle attack as a standard action

against the foe it grapples. The hangman golem and its foe

make opposed grapple checks (or the foe can oppose with an

Escape Artist check). If the hangman golem exceeds its oppo-

nents grapple check by 10 or more, it squeezes the breath from

that opponent, and in addition to taking constrict damage, the

foe is dazed for 1 round if it fails a DC 19 Fortitude save.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A hangman golem is immune

to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects that

allow spell resistance, except as follows.

Animate rope hastens the golem (as if by the haste spell) for

5 rounds.

Rope trick paralyzes the golem for 1 round (no save).

Unravel (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a hang-

man golem can unravel its form to become a heap of tangled

ropes that  lls a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. While in this form,

a hangman golem cannot attack or move, but it gains fast

healing 10. A hangman golem can reform into its humanoid

appearance as a full-round action.

Construction

A hangman golems body is crafted from numerous magi-

cally treated ropes that cost 1,250 gp. Creating the body is a

complex task that requires a DC 20 Craft (weaving) check.

Five or more ranks in the Use Rope skill grants a +2 bonus

on the Craft check.

CL 16th; Craft Construct (see page 206), animate rope, geas/

quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, caster must be at least

16th level; Price 144,000 gp; Cost 72,625 gp + 5,710 XP.

Mud  golems  are  large,  anthropomorphic

creatures  composed  entirely  out  of  slip-

pery mud. They are hulking  gures with

crudely  shaped  but  strong  limbs.

Their faces are just as rough, with

a mouth and two eye sockets that

are  just  scooped-out  holes  with

dim glowing red spheres burning

in the depressions.

A  mud  golem  stands  about

10  feet  tall  and  weighs  600

pounds.  Mud  golems  cannot

speak, other than to utter groans

and moans.

Combat

A  mud  golem  fights  best  from

the bank of a river, lake, pool, or

cistern, where it buries itself into

the  muck.  Once  an  opponent

comes by, it leaps out and tries

to engulf the creature.

Breath  Weapon  (Su):

Spray  of  slippery  mud;

15-foot  cone,  once  every  1d3

rounds.  This  spray  does  no  damage,

but  everyone  in  the  area  must  make  a  DC  17

Reflex save or be blinded for 1d3 rounds. In addition, the

Mud golem

gp + 2,560 XP.

70

breath weapon leaves a very slippery mud residue, equiva-

lent  to  a  grease  spell  (Reflex  DC  17).  The  mud  remains

slippery for 1 hour before it dries out. The save DCs are

Constitution-based.

Engulf (Ex): A mud golem can try to wrap a Medium or

smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The mud

golem attempts a grapple that does not provoke attacks of

opportunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  it  establishes  a

hold and slams the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on the

attack roll.

Attacks that hit an engul ng mud golem deal half their

damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

While engulfed, a victim can do nothing but try to break

free,  by  succeeding  on  an  opposed  grapple  check.  A  mud

golem can engulf 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8 Tiny, 32 Diminutive,

or 128 Fine opponents at a time.

An engulfed creature has no air to breathe, and there is a

chance it will begin to drown (see Drowning, page 304 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A mud golem is immune to

all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects that

allow spell resistance, except as follows.

A transmute mud to rock spell slows it (as the slow spell) for

2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

A transmute rock to mud spell heals all its lost hit points.

A stone to  esh spell does not actually change the golems

structure, but it negates the mud golems damage reduction

for 1 round.

Skills:  A  mud  golem  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  any

Swim  check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a

hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if distracted or endan-

gered. It can use the run action while

swimming,  provided  it  swims  in  a

straight  line.  *A  mud  golems

body  blends  in  extremely

well when it is submerged in

mud, conferring a +15 circum-

stance bonus on Hide checks

in those situations.

Construction

A mud golems body is made

from  special  mud  found  in

magically  charged  areas  or  cre-

ated through magical means.

The golem cost includes 1,000

gp  for  the  construction  of  the

body. Creating the body is a com-

plex  task  that  requires  a  DC

15 Craft (pottery) or a DC 15

Craft (sculpting) check.

Level Adjustment: 

A  10-foot-diameter  sphere  of  scintillating,  multicolored  light

glides silently toward you.

A  prismatic  golem  is  a  construct  of  pure  light  gathered

from the luminescence of the plane of Elysium. Celestial

spellcasters,  always  endeavoring  to

achieve  the  art  of  perfection,

 nd that light compacted to

its essence makes for a

radiant servant.

A prismatic golem

has  no  weight  and

cannot  speak,  al-

though  it  nods  to

acknowledge a valid

command.

Combat

When commanded, a

prismatic golem moves

up to a foe and strikes him

with its tendrils. The golem

is  disarmingly  fast  and  elusive,

so it never hesitates to distance itself

from those who can hurt it.

Prismatic Body (Su): A prismatic golems body is com-

prised of scintillating colors. Creatures with 8 HD or fewer

within  20  feet  of  a  prismatic  golem  are  blinded  for  2d4

rounds by the  ashing colors (no save). Any creature that

touches  a  prismatic  golem  is  treated  as  though  the  golem

had hit it with its prismatic touch attack. A prismatic golem

can be seen from miles away, and provides illumination as a

daylight spell at all times.

Prismatic Touch (Su): A prismatic golem attacks with

luminous tendrils that extend from its body. A tendrils

color is determined randomly, since the golem lacks the

intelligence to choose colors on its own. The effect of the

touch attack is based on the tendrils color, as shown on

the following table. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A prismatic golem is immune

to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.

In  addition,  some  spells  and  effects  function  differently

against the creature, as noted here.

A prismatic spray heals the golem of 3d8 points of damage

+1 point per caster level (maximum 3d8+15). Contact with a

prismatic wall or prismatic sphere also heals the golem in this

way, and ends the spells effect.

Moral Code: Though unintelligent, a prismatic golem is

imprinted with the moral code of its creator. It will cease to

function on its controllers behalf if given any instructions

that con ict with that moral code, regardless of whether the

creators ethics change.

SHADESTEEL GOLEM

This  7-foot-tall  shadowy  automaton  is  crafted  from  a  matte

black metal that seems to absorb light. A mist fills the hollow

spaces  between  its  skeletal  frame,  and  its  two  long  arms  end

in sharp metal claws. A dour, skull-shaped head surmounts its

broad torso, but the construct has no neck to speak of. It moves

slowly but silently, hovering slightly above the ground and dis-

turbing nothing as it passes.

Crafted  from  metal  mined  and  forged  entirely  on  the

Plane of Shadow, shadesteel golems are silent and powerful

guardians. Necromancers, liches, and vampires create these

planar golems to defend their crypts from clerics or paladins

unlikely to be hampered by undead minions.

Those seeing a shadesteel golem often mistakenly iden-

tify  it  as  undead,  since  it  has  a  dark  shadowy  appearance

and moves as quietly as a wraith. Unlike most constructs,

a shadesteel golem is very stealthy, capable of blending into

even the faintest of shadows. Their creators use them as

hidden  guardians  in  conjunction  with  more  obvious

deterrents, such as iron golems or zombies.

A shadesteel golem stands 7 feet tall and weighs

about  1,500  pounds,  though  it  usually   oats

with such ease that it appears to be almost

weightless.

COMBAT

A shadesteel golem is mindless and fol-

lows  whatever orders its master gives

it.  A  golems  creator  can  command

it if the golem is within 60 feet and

can  see  and  hear  her.  If  uncom-

manded, the golem usually follows its

last instruction to the best of its abil-

ity, though the golem always returns

attacks made against it. The creator can

give the golem a simple command to

govern  its  actions  in  her  absence,

such  as  Attack  any  living  creature

that  enters  this  room.  Like  most

constructs,  it   ghts  to  the  death

unless commanded to retreat.

Negative  Pulse  Wave  (Su):  The

shadesteel golem can radiate a burst of inky

black negative energy as a free action every

1d4+1  rounds.  The  pulse  wave  drains

life from all living creatures within 40

feet of the golem, dealing 12d6 points of nega-

tive energy damage. A DC 19 Fortitude save

halves  the  damage;  the  save  DC  is  Constitution-based.

Undead  creatures  within  the  area  are  healed  of  12d6

points  of  damage  instead,  and  any  turning  effect  they

are under is broken. A death ward spell or similar effect

protects  a  creature  from  a  shadesteel  golems  negative

pulse wave.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A shadesteel golem is immune

to  any  spell,  supernatural  ability,  or  spell-like  ability  that

allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects

function differently against the creature, as noted below.

A  magical  effect  that  has  the  light  descriptor  (such  as

continual  ame) causes the golem to speed up as if affected

by the spell haste for 2d4 rounds. The golem is also hasted

whenever it is subject to a positive energy effect, such as the

turning attempt of a cleric. This might happen if the cleric

has mistakenly identi ed the creature as a nightwalker or

other undead, or if the golem is standing near undead.

If a shadesteel golem is targeted by or within the area of

a spell with the darkness or shadow descriptor, the golem is

healed of 1 point of damage per level of the spell.

Shadow  Blend  (Su):  In  any  condition  of  illumination

other than full daylight, a shadesteel golem can disappear

into the shadows, giving it concealment. Arti cial illumina-

tion, even a light or continual  ame spell, does not negate this

ability, though a daylight spell does.

Skills: A shadesteel golem has a +16 racial bonus on Move

Silently checks and a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Construction

A shadesteel golem must be created entirely on the Plane

of Shadow, using 1,500 pounds of steel tempered with rare

shadow-liquids. This shadow-tempered steel costs

10,000 gp to create. The creator must then make

a DC 30 Craft (armorsmithing) check to forge

the golems body.

CL 17th; Craft Construct (see page 206),

energy  drain,  geas/quest,  limited  wish,  poly-

morph  any  object,  shades,  caster  must

be at least 17th level; Price 130,000 gp;

Cost 70,000 gp + 4,800 XP.

Tactics Round-by-Round

A  shadesteel  golem  is  incapable  of

devising its own tactics, but its master

certainly  does  not  suffer  the  same

de ciency.  Paired  with  a  few  undead,

a  shadesteel  golem  can  be  the  perfect

sentry,  using  its  pulse  wave  to  heal  its

allies and weaken its opponents. A savvy

master  gives  the  construct  instructions  to

delay the use of its negative pulse wave for

a  few  rounds,  so  as  to  maximize  its  bene t

for healing the undead. The following tactics

assume the golem is backed up by  ve greater

shadows (an EL 13 encounter).

Prior  to  combat:  Their  creators  often

place shadesteel golems atop a symbol of death.

When the golem moves to attack, the symbol is

revealed. The golems chamber is always dimly lit, to take

advantage of the constructs ability to blend into shadows.

Round  1:  Charge  the  nearest  opponent,  slamming  once.

The shadows circle and engage, looking for weak prey but

staying within 40 feet of the golem.

Round 2: Slam foe twice. The shadows drain the Strength

of nearby enemies.

Round 3: Release negative pulse wave, damaging all foes

within 40 feet and healing any injured shadows. Follow up

with another two slam attacks (or charge another foe, if the

Round 4: Continue slamming foes. Release another pulse

wave every 1d4+1 rounds.

If  the  golems  master  is  present,  on  the  other  hand,  the

 ght  is  very  different.  While  the  tactics  of  a  high-level

wizard are many and varied, one way in which the master

can use the shadesteel golem to best tactical advantage is

to cast shadow spells that heal the golem while damaging

any enemies. For example, she might cast greater shadow

evocation  to  create  an  illusory  chain  lightning  spell,  tar-

geting  the  most  powerful  opponent,  then  striking  the

remaining  party  members  before  arcing  back  to  hit  the

golem  (and  heal  it).  If  the  master  is  a  lich,  vampire,  or

other undead creature, she tries to stay within 40 feet of

the golem, so that she bene ts from the healing properties

of the negative pulse wave.

GREATER SHADESTEEL GOLEM

A  greater  shadesteel  golem  stands  11  feet  tall  and  weighs

Combat

Greater shadesteel golems use the same techniques and tac-

tics as ordinary shadesteel golems. Its negative pulse wave

has a save DC of 23.

SHADESTEEL GOLEMS IN EBERRON

Jahakinir  the  Shadow-Wizard,  a  lich  of  terrible  power,

created  the   rst  four  shadesteel  golems  on  the  plane  of

Mabar, the Endless Night, and offered them to his vampiric

apprentice,  Osilvune.  He  then  sent  his  apprentice  forth

to raise a kingdom on Eberron. Osilvune became ruler of

her own demesne, but her ambition brought her too many

enemies. One day, she simply vanished from the face and

depths of the world. Her servants claim that she hid her

wealth in secret subterranean vaults guarded by Jahakinirs

shadesteel  golems,  but  these  sepulchers  have  never  been

found. Whether the lich created other shadesteel golems

and whether the secrets of their construction have been

passed on remain mysteries as well.

SHADESTEEL GOLEMS IN FAERN

The human empire of Imaskar gave rise to the  rst shade-

steel golems, which were built to guard the vast troves of

Imaskars  evil  wizard-kings.  Other  rulers  from  different

realms  have  sponsored  expeditions  into  Imaskars  known

ruins  to  unearth  the  lost  knowledge  of  shadesteel  golem

construction, but it is not known whether these explorations

have borne fruit.

This  vaguely  humanoid-shaped

creature is composed entirely of

webs, except for its eight spider-

like eyes and sharp mandibles.

A  web  golem  is  a  construct

entirely  composed  of  thick

layers  of  spider  webbing.  The

body is only the roughest shape of a

humanoid,  with  two  arms,  two  legs,

and a stumpy head, but little de ni-

tion.  Its  long,  powerful  arms  can

reach  up  to  15  feet.  The  golem  has

eight  multi faceted  eyes  and  the  poi-

sonous fangs of a giant spider.

A  web  golem  stands  roughly  8  feet

tall, and despite the gossamer nature

of its webbing weighs 500 pounds.

A  web  golem  cannot  speak  and

gives off no discernable scent.

Combat

Like a spider, a web golem lurks

on high ceilings out of reach of its

74

Web golem

prey,  catching  as  many  opponents  as  possible  in  its  webs

before descending to  nish them off.

Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude DC 15; initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Web (Sp): A web golem can use a web effect, as the spell

(DC 13), three times per day. Caster level 10th.

Adhesive  (Ex):  A  web  golem  is  extremely  sticky.

Anyone who makes an unsuccessful melee attack against

a web golem must succeed on a DC 20 Re ex save, or the

attackers weapon sticks to the web golem and is yanked

out of the wielders grasp. Creatures using natural weapons

are automatically grappled if they fail the save. Pulling a

stuck  weapon  or  limb  loose  from  a  web  golem  requires

a DC 20 Strength check. The save DC and check DC are

Strength-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A web golem is immune to

any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In

addition,  certain  spells  function  differently  against  the

creature, as noted below.

A  grease  spell  slows  it  (as  the  slow  spell)  for  2d6

rounds, with no saving throw.

A web golems movement is not inhibited by a

web spell.

Spider  Climb  (Su):  A  web

golem has a continuous spider climb

ability, as the spell.

Skills:  *A  web  golems  body

allows  it  to  blend  in  extremely

effectively  when  hiding  among

other  giant  spider  webs,  confer-

ring a +15 circumstance bonus on

Hide checks.

Construction

A web golems body is made from

layer upon layer of webbing har-

vested  from  monstrous  spiders.

The  material  costs  1,000  gp  for

construction  of  the  body.  Creat-

ing  the  body  is  a  complex  task

that  requires  a  successful  DC  20

Craft  (weaving)  or  Profession

Despite  this,  grimweirds  are  some  of  the  most  charis-

matic beings in existence. They bluff, cajole, threaten, and

blackmail beings of all types into getting them items and

information they need.

A grimweird is a foot or so shorter than the human it

once  was,  its  muscles  and  sinews  withered  by

exposure  to  negative  energy.  It  weighs  less

than 100 pounds. It speaks the languages

it did in life, though it may have learned

quite a few more to communicate with

its thralls.

COMBAT

A grimweird hates the merest thought

of  being  in  melee  combat,  and  so  it

always interposes at least one mon-

ster  between  it  and  anyone  it

meets. If a grimweird gets into

combat, it will do whatever it can

to get out.

Energy  Drain  (Su):  A  grim-

weird can bestow one negative level

on a successful claw attack, whether

or not it does damage. The DC is 21

for the Will save to remove a negative

level; this save DC is Charisma-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/daydispel

magic,  protection  from  chaos/evil/good/

ment Summoning feat, all the grimweirds

summoned creatures gain +4 Strength and

TACTICS

This  withered,  aged  human  crackles  with  dark  lightlight

that  seems  to  be  holding  him  together.  His  bones  seem  to

have shrunk, like the muscles cant hold them up.

Grimweirds are weak, withered, paranoid former human-

oids  who  have  tapped  into  the  energy  of  the  Negative

Energy Plane. They wield this energy to summon guards

raising  the  spirits  of  hell  if  necessaryfor  their  frail,

barely animated bodies.

A grimweird is never alone. When encountered, it will

have  already  summoned  at  least  one  monster.  A  grim-

weird never rests, so it is always able to devote its energy

to summoning an ally. It is these constant demands that

make grimweirds reviled on planes from which monsters

are summoned.

A  grimweird  usually  opens  combat  by  sending  its  sum-

moned minion into the fray, giving it time to assess its foes

and choose another creature to summon.

Prior  to  combat:  Use  protection  from  good  and  summon

monster  VI.  Good  options  for  the  grimweirds  summon

monster VI spell include the chain devil, fiendish rhinoc-

eros,  Huge  fiendish  monstrous  spider,  and  Gargantuan

fiendish monstrous centipede. Unless you know specifi-

cally  when  the  grimweird  summoned  his  last  monster,

assume  the  spell  duration  has  2d6  rounds  remaining

when combat opens.

Round  1:  Use  targeted  dispel  magic  to  eliminate  a  single

opponents defensive effects.

As soon as possible: Summon another monster using summon

monster VI. If a grimweird needs an escape route, it summons

the largest creature it can put between it and its foes.

This humanoid figure is wrapped from head to toe in strips of

scroll parchment and pages from dusty tomes. Pieces of tattered

magic  belts,  robes,  and  chainmail  also  seem  haphazardly

integrated into its form.

A  grisgol  is  a  horrifying  construct  composed  of  broken

and  worn-out  magic  items,  animated  by  a  powerful  spell-

caster  who  has  harnessed  the  spirit  of  a  lich.  Its  skeleton

is  fabricated  from  old  staffs  and  wands  and  its  skin  from

expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummys burial

cloth.  Woven  into  this  are  rings,  bracers,  fragments  of

leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are

scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils,

vaguely  resembling  sets  of  internal  organs.  It  typically

wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light

glare from underneath a hood or old helmet.

Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk,

is the original lichs phylactery. Unless one knows what

animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece

of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the

insides of the construct.

From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even

moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can

hear  the  tinkling  of  glass  touching  glass,  the  sloshing  of

half- lled  vials  and  bottles,  the  squeaking  of  leather,  the

rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most

prominently, the shuf ing of paper as if pages of a tome

were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke

escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily

residue upon whatever it touches.

A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all

traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich

that powers it. A grisgols damaging and paralyzing touch

attacks  are  the  same  as  a  lich  and  the  construct  retains  a

fraction of the original lichs spell-casting ability. A grisgol

only casts the spells scribed by its creator on the scrolls and

tome pages that make up its outer skin. The spells a grisgol

can cast are, however, restricted to the spell levels, domains,

and specializations the lich (a 20th-level cleric, sorcerer, or

wizard) could have cast.

Destroying a grisgol does not destroy the lich that powers

it. To kill the lich, its phylactery must be destroyed after the

grisgol is destroyed. Otherwise, the lich is free to return in

a physical form in 1d10 days. The escaped lich retains all the

powers and abilities it had previous to its entrapment. The

lich seeks vengeance upon whoever possesses its phylactery

and the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric who originally entrapped

it in the body of a grisgol.

A grisgol stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds.

It  knows  all  the  languages  known  by  the  lich  whose

phylactery animates it.

COMBAT

A grisgol is tenacious and relentless, following its creators

instructions explicitly without regard to strategy. Therefore,

a grisgols spell usage is scripted ahead of time by its creator,

unless its creator is within 60 feet of the golem and is able

to issue commands.

Choking Dust (Ex): Striking the golem with any kind of

implement other than a piercing weapon invites a disease-

causing, choking cloud of dust and mold to explode from

the creature. All within a 10-foot radius must make a DC 23

Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Those who fail the  rst Fortitude save must make another

DC 23 Fortitude save (adjusted by their new Constitution

score)  or  contract  the  slimy  doom  disease  (see  page  292

of the Dungeon Masters Guide) in 24 hours. The save DC is

Strength-based.

Damaging Touch (Ex): As with the lich that animates it,

the touch of a grisgol deals 1d8+5 points of negative energy

damage to living creatures (Will DC 19 half). The save DC

is Charisma-based.

Paralyzing  Touch  (Su):  The  slam  attack  of  a  grisgol

causes  permanent  paralysis  unless  the  subject  succeeds

on  a  DC  19  Fortitude  save.  Remove  paralysis  or  any  spell

that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow

curse spell description, page 203 of the Players Handbook).

The  effect  cannot  be  dispelled.  Anyone  paralyzed  by  a

grisgol seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15

Heal check reveals the victim to be alive. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: A grisgol is created with the ability

to use ten different spells as spell-like abilities (one each of

levels 0 through 9th), each one once per day. These spells

can vary based on the creators whim, and are either cleric

spells (if the animating lich was a cleric) or sorcerer/wizard

Immunity to Magic (Ex):

A  grisgol  is  immune  to  any

spell  or  spell-like  ability  that

allows spell resistance. In addi-

tion, certain spells and effects

function  differently  against  a

grisgol, as noted below.

Erase delivered as a touch at-

tack on a grisgol deals 2d6 points

of damage to the creature (no save).

Casting  secret  page  on  a  grisgol

renders  it  invisible  as  the  invis-

ibility spell.

Incite  Madness  (Sp):  Af-

ter  a  grisgol  is  killed,  any-

one examining the strips of

scroll parchment or tome pages

that  comprise  the  creatures  wrappings  in-

vokes a curse that renders the reader insane (Will

DC 19 negates). The victim of this insanity becomes con-

vinced that the thousands of scraps of parchment contain

great  and  lost  arcane  secrets,  and  that  he  must  discover

these  secrets  by  painstakingly   tting  every  last  piece  of

ripped parchment and torn page back together in the right

order. He dedicates every waking hour to this massive un-

dertaking,  barely  pausing  to  eat  or  rest,  in  order  to   nish

this task as fast as possible. The victim always thinks, and

tries to convince others, that he is on the brink of a revela-

tion. His personal study becomes cluttered with diagrams,

charts, and plans extrapolating how the pieces might  t to-

gether, constantly rearranging them to  t current theories

or hunches.

The subject takes 1 point of Intelligence drain when the

curse  is   rst  activated,  and  takes  another  point  of  Intelli-

gence drain every week the curse continues uncured. The

subject dies when he or she reaches 0 Intelligence.

The Intelligence drain cant be restored while the curse is

active. Only a limited wish or similarly powerful magic can

relieve a victim of this curse.

scraps of scrolls and magic tomes. This costs approximately

10,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 25 Craft (book-

binding) check.

The  creator  of  a  grisgol  must  also  capture  a  lichs

phylactery  and  use  it  in  the  grisgols  construction.  The

creator  first  must  facilitate  the  destruction  of  the  lich

whose  phylactery  he  or  she  wants  to  use.  After  the

lichs body is destroyed, the creator of the grisgol

must finalize construction before the lich

returns (usually in 1d10 days). If the lich

returns before the grisgol is completed,

the  lich  must  be  destroyed

again. Animating the grisgol

while the lich is still in limbo

binds the essence of the lich

to the grisgol.

If a grisgol is to be given

the ability to cast a spell with

a  material  component  worth

more than 100 gp or any XP com-

ponent, the creator must include

50  of  that  material  component  or

spend  50  times  the  XP  cost  as

part  of  the  creation.  If  the

grisgol  is  to  be  given  the

ability  to  cast  a  spell  with

a  focus,  the  creator  must

include the focus as part of

the creation.

GRISGOLS IN EBERRON

The  lich  queen  Vol  uses  devout  agents  and  misguided

adventurers to hunt down other liches and capture their

phylacteries.  Once  she  acquires  a  lichs  phylactery,  Vol

binds the lichs spirit to a grisgol. Vols grisgols are some-

times encountered in secret temples inhabited by Blood

of Vol cultists or in locations where signs of the draconic

Prophecy (see page 130 of the EBERRON Campaign Setting)

have manifested.

GRISGOLS IN FAERN

The  ruins  of  Zhentil  Keep  hold  many  unpleasant  sur-

prises for adventurers, not the least of which is a grisgol

fueled by the life essence of a powerful Zhent lich named

Leneka  Jheth.  Thayan  wizards  have  also  unlocked  the

secrets of creating these foul constructs and often use them

to guard their magic troves or retrieve items that have been

wrongfully taken from them.

This hulking armored creature is nearly as broad as it is tall.

Its head is thick and long, with its lower face and jaws slop-

ing down over its chest. It has two small rhinocerouslike ears

high on its head and small black eyes set deep in its face. Its

chin  bears  a  thick  crystalline  horn  that  projects  from  it  to

stab in your direction, and two small crystalline tusks protrude

upward from its lower lip. The creatures skin is dark gray, and

crystal protrudes from its shoulders and knuckles as well as its

chin. Its hands have two broad and stubby fingers with thick

crystal nails and an equally broad thumb. Well muscled and

well armed, it stares grimly at you, making no sound.

Once  native  to  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Earth,  gulgars

migrated to the Material Plane long ago,  eeing an incur-

sion  of  geniekind.  They  now  live  in  temperate  mountain

ranges, riding the winds on the backs of yrthaks and plumb-

ing the depths of the mountains, seeking the crystals they

eat to give their bones strength.

Gulgars seem to be laconic and dour creatures, but in truth

they are boisterous and full of vigor. Their speech is inaudible

to most beings, and they are wary of strangersespecially

of dwarves, a race with which theyve had many con icts in

the past. This disguises the gulgars true nature, but their

oa sh bravura in combat reveals their real personalities.

A gulgar stands a little over 6 feet tall and weighs 250 to

350 pounds. Gulgars have dark gray skin, with males tend-

ing  to  be  darker  than  females.  As  they  age,  females  grow

paler and males grow darker, making very old gulgars white

or black. The crystalline bone that protrudes from their skin

yellows with age, becoming cloudy and opaque.

Gulgars  cannot  vocalize  speech  in  the  normal  range  of

hearing and make few vocal noises other than the guhl-

gaar  sound  of  their  sonic  pulse  (for  which  they  were

named).  Instead,  they  communicate  in  tones  too  low  in

frequency for most beings to hear. Gulgars speak Terran.

COMBAT

Gulgars prefer to ride yrthaks (see page 262 of the Monster

Manual) into combat. They tame and enslave these magi-

cal beasts using their sonic pulses and train them to take

gulgar  riders  into  battle.  When  mounted  on  a  yrthak,  a

gulgar uses its longbow or a lance (2d6+7/3, or 4d6+14/3

on a mounted charge) to attack foes. It uses its sonic pulse

only  when  it  can  do  so  without  catching  the  yrthak  in

the blast.

On  the  ground,  a  gulgar  charges  boldly  into  combat,

beginning  combat  with  its  Powerful  Charge.  In  follow-

ing  rounds  it  strikes  with  its  warhammer  and  uses  its

horn  to  gore  a  foe.  Gulgars  enjoy  employing  bull  rush

and  overrun  attacks  to  move  about  the  battlefield  and

push foes off the cliffs of their mountain homes. If a foe

possesses a weapon that easily pierces its crystalline skin,

a gulgar might throw down its shield, grip its warhammer

with  both  hands  (for  a  total  of  +7  damage),  and  make  a

sunder attempt.

Crystalline Bone (Ex): A gulgars slam and gore attacks

are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming

damage reduction and hardness.

The protrusions of crystal from a gulgars knuckles, chin,

and  shoulders  are  made  of  an  organic  material  that  is  as

hard as adamantine, but it turns as brittle as quartz when

detached from the gulgar.

Sonic  Pulse  (Ex):  As  a  standard  action,  a  gulgar  can

emit  a  30-foot  cone  of  sound  that  deals  3d6  points  of

sonic damage and may deafen foes. Any creature in the

area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be deaf-

ened  for  1  hour.  Deafened  creatures  cannot  be  further

deafened, but they still take the sonic damage from other

sonic pulse attacks.

Once  it  has  used  this  ability,  a  gulgar  must  wait  1d4

rounds before using it again. This is a sonic effect. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Stability  (Ex):  A  gulgar  gains  a  +4  bonus  on  ability

checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when

standing on the ground (but not when climbing, riding

a  flying  mount,  or  otherwise  not  standing  firmly  on

the ground).

Subsonic Speech (Ex): A creature must have the tremor-

sense ability, or the blindsight or blindsense ability based

on  a  keen  sense  of  hearing  or  sensitivity  to  vibrations,  to

hear  the  subsonic  speech  of  gulgars.  Such  creatures  can

hear  the  subsonic  speech  of  gulgars  using  the  normal

Listen check rules; they do not need to have the speaking

gulgar within the range of their tremorsense, blindsense,

or blindsight ability.

A gulgars subsonic speech carries  ve times as well and

as far as normal speech. This means that to hear a gulgar

talking, a creature who can hear the subsonic speech takes

a 1 penalty on Listen checks per 50 feet of distance from

the speaker. A door increases the Listen DC by just 1, and

a stone wall increases it by 3. These modi ers replace those

given on page 78 of the Players Handbook.

Creatures without the ability to hear the subsonic speech

of gulgars can still read their lips using the Spot skill. The

base DC to read a gulgars lips is 20, and the creature reading

lips must speak Terran.

Skills:  Gulgars  have  poor  vision  but  possess  an  excel-

lent sense of hearing. They have a +4 racial bonus on Listen

checks and a 4 racial penalty on Spot checks.

GULGAR SOCIETY

Gulgars live in tribes in and around the cliffs that yrthaks

typically nest in. When they came to the Material Plane,

the  gulgars  encountered  yrthaks  and  found  them  to  be

tractable  creatures  due  to  their  vulnerability  to  sonic

effects and reliance on hearing to sense prey. Many yrthaks

now  serve  gulgar  tribes  as  mounts  and  beasts  of  burden.

Although some do so for the protection and food a gulgar

tribe provides, most are enslaved and serve out of fear of the

gulgars sonic pulse attacks.

Gulgars  exist  on  a  subsistence  level.  Although  they  are

omnivorous,  they  hunger  for  the  crystals  that  they  once

consumed  on  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Earth,  constantly

mining  and  exploring  caverns  in  search  of   ne  crystals.

Their work often brings up metal ore, which they craft into

armor, weapons, and crude sculptures that tell the story of

their   ight  from  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Earth  and  their

great foes, the genies. Their digging often brings them into

contact with other subterranean creatures. If such creatures

dont  inhibit  the  gulgars  in  their  efforts,  the  gulgars  pay

them no heed; if they try to stop the gulgars or attack them,

bitter con ict is always the result.

GULGARS WITH CLASS LEVELS

A gulgars favored class is fighter, but most gulgar lead-

ers  are  rangers  or  druids.  Gulgar  rangers  often  choose

humanoids  (dwarves)  and  magical  beasts  as  their

favored enemies. Few gulgars are clerics, but those who

are can choose from the Animal, Earth, Protection, and

Strength domains.

Gulgar

GULGARS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, gulgars originally came

from  Lamannia,  the  Twilight  Forest.  They  are  most  often

encountered  near  the  eastern  peaks  of  the  Mror  Holds,

bordering  the  Lhazaar  Principalities,  although  wyverns

and manticores pose a constant threat. They periodically

trade  with  the  Mror  Holds  dwarves,  offering  livestock  in

exchange for crystals.

GULGARS IN FAERN

Gulgar  tribes  are  found  throughout  the  Sunrise  Moun-

tains that form the western border of the Endless Wastes.

However,  all  surface-dwelling  gulgars  can  trace  their

origins back to a series of large enclaves carved into the

walls of the Ramparts of Night, a subterranean abyss in a

region of the Underdark known as the Earthroot (located

under Thay).

HARPOON SPIDER

A creature the size of a large horse looms before you. It resembles

a spider, except it has ten legs rather than eight, its body is cov-

ered with sharp spines, and its eight eyes look like they belong

more on a human than a spider face. Two massive mandibles flex

slowly, as it glares.

A subterranean creature, the har-

poon  spider  is  a  lightning-

fast predator much feared

by  other  denizens  of  its

demesnes.

Close  examination

reveals  that  a  har-

poon  spider  isnt  a

true  spider  at  all,

but something far

more  sinister.  It

superficially  re-

sembles  an  enor-

mous  black  widow,

except  that  hun-

dreds of razor-sharp

spines cover its body.

Each of its ten legs ter-

minates in a tiny clawed

hand,  and  its  eight

eyes  are  humanlike.

It  can  extend  either  of

its  large  mandibles  on  a

long leathery tendril with

surprising force. A harpoon

spider  measures  around  8

feet long and weighs near-

ly 1,400 pounds.

Harpoon  spiders  are

quite  intelligent  and  can

often  be  found  nesting  with  ettercaps  and

monstrous spiders. Harpoon spiders use these

creatures to bolster the defenses of their lair. They have a

particularly morbid sense of humor and enjoy playing with

their food while it ripens on their spines.

Harpoon spiders speak Common and Undercommon in

whispery voices.

Harpoon spider

COMBAT

A harpoon spider is a hunter, often stalking victims in a

large territory around its lair. In combat, it uses its har-

poon  fangs  and  Improved  Trip  feat  (see  below)  to  reel

in  prey,  then  administers  a  bite  once  its  opponent  has

been  brought  close.  If  the  terrain  permits,  the  spider

prefers to attack victims from high vantage points (such

as ledges).

Harpooning (Ex): As ranged attacks, a harpoon spider

can  re one or two of its fangs up to 20 feet (no range in-

crement).  The  spider  can   re  at  two  different  targets  if  it

chooses. A successful hit deals 1d4+1 points of damage as

the harpoon hooks the  esh of the target and immediately

80

exudes a thick, sticky glue. The spider can reel in a har-

poon as a free action; treat this as a trip attack (+10 bonus)

against  any  creature  attached  to  the  fang.  Failure  indi-

cates that the harpoon rips free (and deals another 1d4+1

points  of  damage  to  the  victim).  Success  indicates  that

the victim is pulled off its feet and dragged

back  to  the  spider,  who  can  imme-

diately  make  a  free  bite  attack

against  the  victim.  A  har-

poon spider can only pull

a  creature  smaller  than

itself in this manner. At-

tempts to retract a crea-

ture of its own size or

larger  automatically

cause  the  fang  to  rip

free as if the trip attack

failed.  The  glue  exuded

by  the  spiders  fangs

decomposes  quickly,

and  at  the  end  of  the

spiders  turn  the  fang

automatically detaches.

Poison (Ex): Injury,

Fortitude  DC  16,  initial

damage  1d6  Dex,  sec-

ondary  damage  2d6

Dex.  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Spines  (Ex):  Any

creature  striking  a

harpoon  spider  with

its body or a handheld

weapon  must  make  a

DC  16  Reflex  save  or  take

1d6  points  of  piercing  dam-

age from the spiders spines. (Crea-

tures wielding reach weapons, such as long spears,

are not subject to this damage.) The spines also

deal  an  extra  1d6  points  of  damage  on  a  successful

grapple check (much like  armor  spikes).  The save  DC

is Dexterity-based.

As a full-round action, a harpoon spider can pick up

a  Medium  or  smaller  helpless  creature  with  its  legs  and

impale the body on its spines, dealing 2d6 points of pierc-

ing damage. The spider can carry up to 2 Medium, 8 Small,

32  Tiny,  or  128  Diminutive  or  smaller  creatures  in  this

manner.  Harpoon  spiders  often  use  this  method  to  carry

their next meals.

Web Movement (Ex): Although they cannot spin webs

themselves, harpoon spiders can climb around and through

webs with ease using their climb speed. They are immune to

the effects of the web spell.

Skills: A harpoon spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and Jump checks, and it can always choose to take 10

on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

Feats: A harpoon spider gains Improved Trip as a bonus

feat, even though it does not meet the prerequisites.

DREAD HARPOON SPIDER

A dread harpoon spider measures 18 feet long and weighs

7,200 pounds.

The dread harpoon spider presented here adjusts the base

creatures  statistics  by  advancing  its  Hit  Dice  and  adding

ability score increases based on Hit Dice.

Combat

A  dread  harpoon  spider  patiently  waits  in  ambush  for

its prey.

Harpooning  (Ex):  A  dread  harpoon  spider  can   re  its

harpoonlike  fangs  up  to  20  feet  (no  range  increment).  A

successful hit deals 1d6+1 points of damage as the harpoon

hooks  the   esh  of  the  target  and  immediately  exudes  a

thick, sticky glue. The spider can reel in a harpoon as a free

action; treat this as a trip attack (+21 bonus) against any crea-

ture attached to the fang. Failure indicates that the harpoon

rips free (and deals another 1d6+1 points of damage to the

victim). This ability is otherwise like the ordinary harpoon

spiders harpooning ability.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial damage

1d6  Dex,  secondary  damage  2d6  Dex.  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Spines  (Ex):  Any  creature  striking  a  dread  harpoon

spider with its body or a handheld weapon must make a DC

17 Re ex save or take 1d8 points of piercing damage from

the spiders spines. (Creatures wielding reach weapons, such

as longspears, are not subject to this damage.) The spines

also  deal  an  extra  1d8  points  of  damage  on  a  successful

grapple  check  (much  like  armor  spikes).  The  save  DC  is

Dexterity-based.

As a full-round action, a dread harpoon spider can pick

up  a  Large  or  smaller  helpless  creature  with  its  legs  and

impale the body on its spines, dealing 3d6 points of pierc-

ing damage. The spider can carry up to 2 Large, 8 Medium,

32 Small, or 128 Tiny or smaller creatures in this manner.

HARPOON SPIDERS IN EBERRON

The daelkyr experimented on monstrous spiders to create

the  harpoon  spider.  Harpoon  spiders  inhabit  Khyber,

and  larger  specimens  (dread  harpoon  spiders)  frequently

guard caverns or passages leading to daelkyr strongholds.

Harpoon spiders have also in ltrated the ruins of various

ancient Dhakaani strongholds throughout Khorvaire.

HARPOON SPIDERS IN FAERN

Harpoon spiders threaten denizens and explorers of the

Underdark. Although generally solitary predators, they are

frequently encountered in greater numbers within a North-

dark region known as the Labyrinth, particularly near the

gray  dwarf  metropolis  of  Gracklstugh  and  the  nearby

trading outpost of Mantol-Derith.

Armed with a pair of curved kukris, this armored humanoids

long-fingered  hands  and  its  vaguely  reptilian  face  are  the  only

parts of its body not covered in sand-colored desert clothes. Its

reddish-brown skin is rough and grainy like sand, and its slitted

eyes glow a fiery red.

As harsh and unyielding as their desert homes, harssafs

dont typically deal congenially with others. Harssafs live

in  and  wander  the  great  deserts  and  barren  places  of  the

world.  Seemingly  composed  of  the   re  and  sand  of  their

home terrain, they live in nomadic bands and frequently

raid settlements within or near their desert homes.

Harssafs live mostly insular lives, traveling and raiding

throughout  a  massive  section  of  desert.  Harssafs  have  no

compunctions about killing when necessary, but they take

no particular pride in it. Killing to the harssafs is a neces-

sary skill to survive the coming sandstorms that will carry

the great desert to the far reaches of the world.

Both male and female harssafs stand about 6 feet tall and

weigh about 190 pounds.

Harssafs speak Ignan and Common.

COMBAT

A  harssaf  prefers  to  ambush  its  opponents,  hiding  among

the dunes near the desert edge in sand form or just beneath

the  sands  and  using  its  blindsense  to  determine  when

potential  targets  wander  by.  Once  engaged  in  melee,  a

harssaf ignites its weapons and closes to melee, wielding its

twin kukris with deadly ef ciency. Most clans of harssafs

include monks that specialize in the arts of grappling, and

one  of  these  can  frequently  be  found  as  part  of  a  raiding

party.  These  individuals  have  the  unenviable  job  of  sub-

duing spellcasters, especially those that exhibit any signs of

casting cold magic.

Flaming  Aura  (Su):  At  will  as  a  free  action,  a  harssaf

can generate an intense  ery heat. This aura takes the form

of  a  miragelike  shimmering  around  a  harssafs  body.  Any

creature that comes within 5 feet of a harssaf automatically

takes 1d6 points of  re damage per round, and any creature

struck by a harssafs melee attacks takes an extra 1d6 points

of  re damage. Only metallic weapons conduct this heat, but

harssafs rarely wield wooden weapons when they use this

ability, since doing so typically renders the weapons useless

after a few rounds.

Sand  Pulse  (Su):  Once  per  day  as  a  standard  action,  a

harssaf can generate a sand pulse in a 30-foot-radius spread

centered on itself. All creatures within the area must make

a DC 15 Re ex save or take 3d6 points of damage from the

high-powered blast of sand and be blinded for 5 rounds. Suc-

cess negates the blindness and halves the damage. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Creatures that do not rely on eyes to see (such as grim-

locks) are unaffected by the blindness but can still take

damage from the sand pulse. Harssafs are immune to the

sand pulses of other harssafs.

Sand Form (Su): At will as a standard action, a harssaf

can assume the form of a pile of mobile sand. This ability

works as the gaseous form spell, except the harssaf is com-

posed of sand instead of vapor and it cannot  y; harssafs in

sand form slither along the ground and can  t through gaps

or crevices less than one-quarter inch wide.

HARSSAF SOCIETY

Harssaf  clans  are  incredibly  structured,  composed  of  a

strict caste system of scouts and tenders. Tenders comprise

less  than  one-third  of  a  bands  total  population,  and  even

they are capable warriors. Consisting mostly of scouts inca-

pable of  ghting due to age or in rmity, pregnant females,

young children, and the few craftsfolk of the clan, tenders

are  regarded  as  second-class  citizens.  Leaders  of  the  clans

always emerge from the scout caste, which consists of any

male or female of  ghting age.

Males and females have an equal opportunity to prove

themselves  worthy  of  the  scout  caste.  But  females  who

have children are relegated to be tenders until their chil-

dren  are  old  enough  to  be  left  with  others  of  the  caste.

Only then can these females return to the scout clan. As

a result, children are raised by the clan as a whole, being

alternately schooled by different members of the scout caste.

These scouts have taken it upon themselves to educate the

youngsters  in  various  martial  and  religious  mysteries  to

ensure they are prepared to choose their career when they

come of age.

Harssaf clans sometimes skirmish over resources or ter-

ritory, but they prefer to avoid  ghting other chosen desert

dwellers and focus their raids on the soft outlanders.

A  harssaf  camp  is  usually  composed  of  several  small

tents shared by tenders, and a few large pavilions where

the scouts stay. Due to their natural affinity for hot and

sandy environments, harssafs have no problem sleeping in

the open desert. Rumors exist of ancient harssaf structures

in the deepest deserts, strongholds that all clans visit from

time to time. These strongholds are said to hold the history

of the mysterious harssaf people, as well as monasteries that

devote  themselves  to  schooling  the  many  monks  of  the

harssaf clans.

Harssafs  worship  no  particular  deity,  but  rather

worship  the  desert  itself.  They  believe  their  race  once

spawned from the desert, and that one day the desert will

rise up to swallow the earth in its warm embrace. Only

they, the faithfully prepared, will survive the onslaught of

the desert. A few worship powerful lords of the Elemental

Plane of Fire.

Harssaf clerics can choose from the Fire, Law, Strength,

HARSSAFS AS

CHARACTERS

Monks  are  common  among  the

scout  caste,  as  are  rangers  and

 ghters.  Barbarians  are  almost

unheard  of  among  harssaf  clans,

since  the  race  is  typically  far  too

ordered  and  organized  and

tend  to  a  lawful  alignment.

Harssaf clerics are rare, but

greatly valued for their heal-

ing  powers;  such  individuals

frequently  become  clan  lead-

ers  due  to  their  wisdom  and

leader ship.  Harssaf  druids

are  more  common;  many

actively seek to expand the

deserts in uence on the sur-

rounding  lands,  hoping  to

hasten the day when the desert

swallows  all.  Wizards  and  sor-

cerers  are  slightly  less  rare.  The

structured  lifestyle  of  the  clans

appeals to those of a scholarly bent,

and many hars safs take naturally

to magic without training.

Harssaf  characters  possess

the following racial traits.

 +4 Strength, +6 Dexterity, +6

Constitution, +2 Charisma.

Medium size.

A  harssafs  base  land  speed  is  30  feet,  and  it  has  a

burrow speed of 10 feet.

Racial  Hit  Dice:  A  harssaf  begins  with  six  levels  of

monstrous humanoid, which provide 6d8 Hit Dice, a base

Harssaf communities dot the great deserts of Sarlona.

When humans migrated from Sarlona to Khorvaire

millennia  ago,  they  brought  harssaf  slaves  with

them.  Their  descendants  gather  in  small

tribes  in  the  heart  of  the  Talenta  Plains,

where the harssafs maintain a ten-

uous  truce  with  roaming  hal ing

plainsfolk.  The  hal ings  of  the  Talenta

Plains  refer  to  these  harssaf  interlopers

as the Flameborn.

HARSSAFS IN FAERN

Harssafs  came  to  Faern  as  servants

and  soldiers  of  the  efreeti  emperor

Memnon. Memnon and his archri-

val,  the  djinni  emperor  Calim,

reduced  much  of  Calimshans

fertile  lands  to  a  desert  waste-

land  with  their  tireless  war-

ring  until,  at  long  last,  their

spirits were bound to the air and

sand  by  elven  high  magic.  The

harssafs  were  confined  to  the

Calim  Desert  as  well,  surviv-

ing  the  rise  and  fall  of  Coram-

shan,  the  tyranny  of  the  Rose

Dragon Ylveraasahlisar and be-

holder  occupation,  the  Rage  of

Dragons  (1018  DR),  and  the  Time

of Troubles (1358 DR). Harssaf tribes

menace  Calishite  caravans  and  prey  on

other desert nomads, and many caliphs have lost

sleep  trying  and  failing  to  eradicate  the  Calim  Deserts

harssaf infestation.

(Large); 3145 HD (Huge)

Level Adjustment: 

This creature looks like a heav-

ily muscled dire bear with large

metal  plates  grafted  to  its  skin.

Its  fur  is  thick,  even  around  the

grafted metal plates, and its face

is a twisted, feral mask of rage.

Ironclad  maulers  are  magi-

cally  engineered  dire  bears

created to smash formations of op-

posing troops. They will fearlessly

charge  even  large  groups  of  ene-

mies,  and  they  have  the  size  and

strength  to  decimate  large  groups

of humans or similar creatures. Al-

though  forces  of  great  magic  cre-

ated ironclad maulers, they are now

found in wild regions, having escaped

or  outlived  their  creators.  The  few  still

kept  by  military  leaders  are  among  the  most

deadly engines of war available to civilized nations. They

are so valuable, in fact, that they are seldom risked in open

warfare anymore.

Although  ironclad  maulers  were  once  dire  bears,  the

two species have grown apart, and the two cannot produce

offspring. In rare cases, an ironclad mauler will assume

Ironclad mauler

leadership of a pack of dire bears, pushing even the fero-

cious dire bears into crueler and more violent activities.

An ironclad maulers powerful limbs end in long, deadly

claws, and its face is a twisted and feral version of a normal

bears  face.  A  typical  ironclad  mauler  is  12  feet  long  and

weighs as much as 9,000 pounds, including the weight of its

grafted armor.

COMBAT

As their name implies, ironclad maulers were created spe-

ci cally for war. As such, they relish combat, and rush into

melee  without  hesitation  or  mercy.  Ironclad  maulers  like

nothing more than using their size and strength to smash

formations of weaker creatures, but they also seem to enjoy

close-fought duels with equally powerful creatures. Unlike

natural animals, ironclad maulers never  ee a  ght. Their

innate ferocity and the magical forces used to create them

push them to  ght to the death in every combat. Although

they  have  only  animal  intelligence,  ironclad  maulers

instinctively  trample  groups  of  smaller  creatures  in  close

proximity to one another.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an ironclad

mauler must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity.

Sickening  Aura  (Su):  An

ironclad mauler is surrounded by

a   eld  of  negative  energy.  Any

creature  that  comes  within  10

feet  of  an  ironclad  mauler  must

make a DC 22 Fortitude save or

become  sickened.  This  condi-

tion lasts for 1 hour. A creature

that  succeeds  on  the  saving

throw  is  immune  to  that  crea-

tures aura for 24 hours.

Undead  are  immune  to  this

aura. The save is Constitution-

based.

Trample  (Ex):  Ref lex

half  DC  28.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Grafted  Armor  (Ex):

Iron clad  maulers  wear  ar-

mor  that  has  been  magically

grafted  to  their  forms.  This

armor provides significant pro-

tection in combat, but it impos-

es no maximum Dexterity bonus,

no movement penalty, and no arcane

spell failure chance. Other creatures, even oth-

er  ironclad  maulers,  cannot  wear  an  ironclad

maulers armor.

Light Forti  cation (Ex): An ironclad maulers grafted

armor protects its vital areas and makes it resistant to extra

damage  from  critical  hits  and  sneak  attacks.  Anytime  an

ironclad mauler is hit by a critical hit or a sneak attack, it has

a 25% chance to resist the extra damage.

Level Adjustment: 

An imposing man dressed in gold-inlaid mithral full plate stands

composed with a serious manner. Magnificent black-and-white

feathered wings sprout from his back. His eyes glow gold under

thick brows, and he wields a silvery greatsword.

Single-minded  forces  for  law,  justicators  travel  the  multi-

verse  to  punish  chaos.  In  doing  so,  they  accord  equal

respect to archons and devils and equal hatred to demons

and eladrins. Their goals often coincide with those of inevi-

tables, and the two species sometimes work together.

A justicator stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Its

eyes and weapons include all manner of metallic hues, rang-

ing from electric metallic blue to antique copper.

Justicators speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal.

COMBAT

A justicator focuses on killing creatures it knows are chaotic

and tries to avoid harming creatures it knows are lawful, but

will do so in self-defense.

A justicators natural weapons, as well as any weapons

it  wields,  are  treated  as  lawful-aligned  for  the  purpose  of

overcoming damage reduction.

Smite Chaos (Su): Four times per day, a justicator can

attempt to smite chaos with one normal melee attack. It

gains +1 on the attack roll and +17 on the damage roll. If a

justicator accidentally smites a creature that is not chaotic,

the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for

that day.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willbless, detect chaos; 3/day

cure  serious  wounds,  dimensional  anchor,  invisibility  purge,

silence (DC 13); 1/daydispel chaos (DC 16), greater command

(DC 16), plane shift. Caster level 10th.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

A  justicator  generally  picks  its  target  and  has  its  strategy

well-prepared before encountering its foe.

Before Combat: Use invisibility purge to reveal hidden foes.

Round 1: Use dimensional anchor on its target.

Round 2: If target has allies, use greater command on allies

to  ee. If target is alone, use bless and close to target.

Round 3: Full attack.

Round 4: Continue melee attacks against foe or use silence

to mute pesky spellcaster.

Round 5: Repeat from round 3 or plane shift to safety if

endangered.

JUSTICATORS IN EBERRON

Justicators battle the forces of chaos on Shavarath, a plane of

whirling blades and endless battle elds. However, they are

native to the plane of Daanvi, the Turning Order.

KENKU

A cloaked humanoid clings to the shadows. It has birdlike talons

instead of hands and feet, and beneath the cowl of its robe you

can discern avian featuresbeady black eyes, a black beak, and

russet-brown feathers.

Kenkus evolved from avians, although they no longer pos-

sess wings or the ability to  y. Soft, dark feathers cover a

kenkus head and torso, although its scrawny arms and legs

remain bare.

Sel sh and secretive in their dealings, kenkus gather in

large cities, lurk in dark alleys, and hoard purloined gold.

They  rarely  travel  alone,  instead  preferring  to  roam  the

streets in small gangs, all the while hatching plots to amass

more wealth and power. Due to their penchant for shady

ventures, they are often employed as thugs, thieves, spies,

and assassins.

A kenku averages 5 feet in height. Because its bones are

partly hollow, it weighs a mere 75 pounds.

Kenkus  speak  Common  and  their  own  language,

Kenku.

COMBAT

Beneath their unremarkable brown robes, kenkus conceal

a variety of useful tools and weapons. Vicious but cowardly,

kenkus usually  ee or surrender the instant things start to

go badly for them.

The kenku warrior presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 12, Con 8,

Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 9.

Great  Ally  (Ex):  Kenkus  work  exceptionally  well  with

their allies. When successfully aided on a skill check or

attack  roll  by  an  ally,  or  when  aiding  another,  a  kenku

applies or gains a +3 bonus on its check or attack roll (instead

of the normal +2 bonus). Furthermore, a kenku gains a +4

bonus on attack rolls against an opponent  anked by an ally

(instead of the normal +2 bonus).

Kenku

Mimicry (Ex): A kenku can perfectly mimic familiar

sounds, voices, and accents. This ability does not enable

the kenku to speak languages it cant normally speak. To

duplicate a speci c individuals voice, a kenku makes a Bluff

check; a listener familiar with the voice being imitated must

succeed on an opposed Sense Motive check to discern that

the voice isnt genuine.

Skills: Kenku have a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks and

Move Silently checks.

KENKU SNEAK

A  kenku  sneak  uses  its  skills  to  serve  more  power-

ful creatures as a spy or assassin. In combat, it relies on

sneakiness, cooperation, and initiative to survive. In addi-

tion to its weapons, a kenku sneak carries its own sets of

thieves tools.

The kenku rogue presented here had the following ability

scores before racial adjustments: Str 10, Dex 15, Con 8, Int

12, Wis 13, Cha 14.

Combat

A kenku sneak uses its rogue abilities to great effect, prefer-

ring to work with an ally to  ank and sneak attack a foe.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  If  a  kenku  sneak  can  catch  an

opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively

from its attack, it can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

Basically,  the  kenku  rogues  attack  deals  extra  damage

any time its target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to

AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or

not), or when the kenku rogue  anks its target. This extra

damage is 1d6 points at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6

every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the kenku rogue

score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage

is not multiplied.

Trap  nding (Ex): A kenku sneak can use the Search

skill to locate traps when the task has a Dif culty Class

higher than 20, and it can use the Disable Device skill to

disarm magic traps.

KENKU SOCIETY

Kenkus  hatch  like  birds  and  dwell  in  family  aeries  and

nests, most of which are located in or near large cities. At age

nine, a young adult kenku leaves the home-nest forever and

strikes out on its own, usually falling in with small groups

of like-minded kenkus. Adult kenkus remain with these

groups for mutual protection and gain. A few strike out on

their own or partner with other types of creatures who value

the services a kenku can provide.

KENKUS AS CHARACTERS

Kenku  characters  tend  toward  neutrality;  although  most

kenkus are evil, neutral and neutral good kenkus also exist.

Kenkus favor the rogue class and often pursue the assassin

prestige  class.  Kenku  clerics  are  rare,  but  those  that  exist

typically worship Vecna, the god of secrets.

Kenkus possess the following racial traits.

+2 Dexterity, 2 Strength.

A kenkus base land speed is 30 feet.

KENKUS IN EBERRON

A network of kenku spies calling themselves the Nightswift

has in ltrated various metropolitan cities across Khorvaire.

The  Nightswift  maintains  secret  meeting  halls  (called

eyries)  in  Zarashak  (the  Shadow  Marches),  the  Great

Crag  (Droaam),  Sharn  and  Starilaskur  (Breland),  Wyvern-

skull (Darguun), Taer Valaestas (Valenar), and Newthrone

(Qbarra). Guilds of kenku thieves and assassins are equally

prevalent; the largest of these is called Shadoweyes Flock,

based in Starilaskur. The stately guildmaster, Shadoweye

(NE female kenku rogue 8/assassin 4), has white plumage

that testi es to her advanced age, and rumor is shes looking

for a worthy successor.

KENKUS IN FAERN

Kenku inhabit cities across southern Faern, with a large

but loose guild of thieves and assassins called the Dagger-

talons  based  in  Zazesspur.  Kenku  living  in  the  eastern

nations of Veldorn and Estagund trace their ancestry even

farther east, to Kara-Tur.

This ten-legged, beetlelike creature has a hard, shiny red shell. Two

wicked claws grope the air before its four beady, black eyes and

sharp,  jagged  mandibles.

These  mouth parts  sit

below  a  massive  pro-

trusion  that  looks  like

a bell made of chitin,

from  which  you  can

hear  a  faint,  high-

pitched warbling.

Knell beetles are an off-

shoot  of  giant  beetles

that were long ago warped

by overexposure to trans-

mutation  magic

and  sonic  energy.

Since  their  original

creation,  the  twelve-

limbed  vermin  have  thrived

in  underground  colonies,  con-

structing  immense,  convoluted

tunnel complexes reminiscent of anthills.

A knell beetles black and red carapace looks

like  it  might  conceal  wings,  but  it  acts  only  as  durable

armor.  Two  more  limbsjointed,  agile,  and  wickedly

hooked clawsjut from each side of a pair of long man-

dibles. Above the knell beetles head is a hornlike growth

shaped like the bell of a massive trumpet, tapering above

the creatures shoulders and  aring out over its sharp jaws.

Its four black, insectoid eyes sit in a chitinous brow ridge

Knell beetle

that  runs  just  below  this  horn.  Essentially,  the  creature

lacks a true head; in its place is the large horn, which war-

bles and trumpets when the knell beetle communicates to

other knell beetles.

Knell beetles, like most vermin, are mindless hunters.

They  live  to  breed  and  expand  their  warrens,  breaking

off  into  new  colonies  when  one  has  grown  too  large  for

an area (typically when a colony has amassed more than

 fty  members).  Knell  beetles  have  also  been  known  to

be used as mounts by Underdark races. Hobgoblins have

domesticated  them  in  the  past,  as  have  some  orc  tribes.

These  groups  know  that  in  great  numbers  knell  beetles

only become more effective, and mounted units of knell

beetles riders sometimes form the elite  ghting units for

certain tribes or cities.

A knell beetle usually measures about 9 feet in length and

weighs about 1,500 pounds.

COMBAT

Knell  beetles  in  groups   ght  by  using  their  shake  the

earth ability, attempting to knock prone as many enemies

as possible. They then rush in and trample whatever foes

they can before switching to claw, bite, and rend attacks.

The creatures only resort to their sonic chime attacks if

necessary. Although mindless vermin, knell beetles  ght

with a certain amount of savage cunning, perhaps also a

result  of  the  long  ago  transmutation

experiments that created them.

Rend  (Ex):  If  a  knell  beetle  hits

with both claw attacks, it latches onto

the  opponents  body  and  tears

the   esh.  This  attack  auto-

matically  does  an  additional

4d8+12 points of damage.

Shake the Earth (Ex):

A  knell  beetle  can  chan-

nel  some  of  the  son-

ic  energy  within  its

body  by  performing

a  rhythmic  stomp-

ing  on  the  ground

as a standard action.

Any  creature  within

5 feet of a knell beetle when it acti-

vates this ability must make a DC 24

Re ex save or fall prone as the ground

lurches and buckles beneath it. Knell bee-

tles  are  immune  to  shake  the  earth  generated  by

themselves or other knell beetles and never need to save

against the effect.

If  multiple  knell  beetles  activate  their  shake  the  earth

ability in the same round, the radius of the effect expands

as the resonance in the ground combines. For every knell

beetle within 5 feet using shake the earth, the radius of the

effect  expands  by  another  5  feet.  Thus,  two  knell  beetles

within 5 feet of one another generate a shaking that affects

all  creatures  within  10  feet  of  either  knell  beetle.  Three

knell beetles within 5 feet using the ability would generate

an effect that affects all creatures within 15 feet of any one

of the knell beetles.

Creatures  with  stability  or  that  are  considered  stable

against trip attempts receive a bonus on their Re ex save as

if they were being tripped (so a dwarf would receive the +4

bonus on the save to resist being knocked prone). The save

DC is Strength-based.

Sonic  Chime  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a  knell  beetle  can

emit a cone of sonic energy from the chitinous bell above

its head. The cone is 30 feet long, and activating the chime

is  a  standard  action.  Creatures  within  the  cone  take  10d6

points of sonic damage (Re ex DC 22 half). A knell beetle

is immune to its own sonic chime attack and that of other

knell beetles. Knell beetles attacking in numbers use this

ability instinctually to heal their fellow knell beetles once

several have taken damage (see sonic healing, below). The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  half  DC  24.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Sonic Healing (Su): For every 5 points of damage a sonic

attack would deal to a knell beetle, the creature instead heals

1 point of damage it has already sustained. If a knell beetle

receives more healing than its current hit point maximum,

the extra hit points are wasted (the creature does not gain

temporary  hit  points  from  exposure  to  sonic  damage).  A

knell beetle gets no saving throw against attacks that deal

sonic damage.

Skills: Knell beetles have a +8 racial bonus on Balance,

Listen, and Spot checks.

Level Adjustment: 

Lesser knell beetles are the equivalent of the worker drones

in  a  beehive.  They  scavenge  for  food,  build  and  expand

the  nest,  and  serve  as  frontline  defenders  if  the  colony

is attacked. Although not nearly as potent as the normal

knell beetles, in groups, the lesser versions can be nearly

as deadly. A lesser knell beetle measures 45 feet long and

weighs 180200 pounds.

Combat

Like  their  larger  brethren,  lesser  knell  beetles  seek  to

attack in groups, using their shake the earth ability and

sonic screeches to both deal damage on their foes and heal

each other. A key difference in strategy when lesser knell

beetles and normal knell beetles  ght together seems to be

an instinctual tactic. The lesser knell beetles attack in a line

as  a  unit,  while  the  normal  knell  beetles  gather  together

behind their smaller brethren. In this way, a normal knell

beetles sonic chime attack catches many more lesser knell

beetles in its blast. Due to their sonic healing ability, which

is more potent than that possessed by the larger specimens,

the lesser knell beetles are able to  ght much longer than

expected. Combined with their own screeches, lesser knell

beetles  often  seem  as  durable,  if  not  more  so,  than  their

heftier kin.

Rend (Ex): If a knell beetle hits with both claw attacks,

it  latches  onto  the  opponents  body  and  tears  the   esh.

This attack automatically does an additional 2d10+6 points

of damage.

Screech  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a  lesser  knell  beetle  can

emit a cone of sonic energy from the chitinous bell above its

head, just as a normal knell beetle. However, the lesser knell

beetles cone is 20 feet long, and creatures within take 5d6

points of sonic damage (Re ex DC 17 half). The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Shake the Earth (Ex): This ability functions just as a

normal  knell  beetles  shake  the  earth  ability,  except  the

Re ex save DC is 17. Lesser and normal knell beetles are

immune to each others shake the earth ability, as well as

their own. The save DC is Strength-based.

Trample:  Re ex  half  DC  17.  The  save  DC  is  Strength-

based.

Sonic Healing (Su): This ability functions as the normal

knell beetles sonic healing ability, except lesser knell beetles

heal 1 point of damage per 3 points of sonic damage a sonic

attack would normally deal.

Skills: Lesser knell beetles have a +4 racial bonus on Bal-

ance, Listen, and Spot checks.

KNELL BEETLES IN EBERRON

Knell beetles were used as mounts by the warrior legions

of the ancient Dhakaan Empire. The ancient hobgoblin

dynasty lives on as a series of ruins across Khorvaire, and

knell beetles inhabit several of these sites. They also lurk in

the depths of Khyber, where their ominous sonic chimes

can sometimes be heard for miles.

This creature appears to be a

black-furred  gorilla  from  the

waist  up  and  a  large,  hairy,

monstrous  spider  from  the

waist  down.  Its  intelligence

is  obvious  from  its  equipment

which  includes  various  belts

and tools.

Lhosks  are  jungle-dwelling

hunter-gatherers  that  live  off

the rich natural resources of their

jungle homes. Nimble despite their

size,  they  roam  large  territories

in  search  of  food  and  water.  Lhosks

believe the world is full of spirits, both those of

intelligent beings and those of objects such as

rocks and trees. Lhosks also believe they were created to

interpret and carry out the wishes of those spirits while

guarding and protecting them.

Lhosks live in family groups run by the toughest male.

They determine leaders through ritual combat. A lhosk nest

includes females (half as many as there are males) and young

(half as many as there are females).

A  lhosk  stands  67  feet  tall  and  weighs  approximately

1,000 pounds. It has two arms, as a normal gorilla, and eight

Lhosk

legs. Its legs cover a roughly ten-foot diameter area and the

spider portion of its body is about three feet tall.

Lhosks  speak  Common,  and  those  with  above-average

Intelligence often speak the languages of their neighbors,

most commonly Draconic, Goblin, and Orc.

COMBAT

Lhosks are wary of other civilized races but not particularly

vicious. They prefer to use their webs to set traps and ques-

tion  trapped  intruders.  If  intruders  ignore  their  instruc-

tions or attack, they defend themselves to the death. They

dont  hesitate  to  attack  those  who  threaten  their  females

and young.

A  lhosk  normally  attacks  using  its  Power  Attack  feat,

taking a 4 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +4 bonus

on damage rolls (+8 if using a spear).

Entangling  Web  (Ex):  A  lhosk  can  throw  a  web  eight

times  per  day.  This  is  a  ranged  touch  attack  for  the  lhosk

with a range increment of 10 feet (maximum range, 50 feet);

it  is  effective  against  targets  up

to Huge.

A  creature  hit  by  the  en-

tangling  web  is  entangled.

An  entangled  creature  can

escape  with  a  successful  DC

17 Escape Artist check or burst

free with a DC 21 Strength check.

The save DCs are Dexterity-based,

and  the  Strength  check  DC  in-

cludes a +4 racial bonus. Both are

standard actions.

Skills: A lhosk has a +8 racial

bonus on Climb checks and can

always  choose  to  take  10  on

Climb  checks,  even  if  rushed

or threatened.

LHOSK SOCIETY

Lhosks live in small, nomadic

groups.  During  the  day  they

travel, search for fruit and veg-

etables, and hunt. They rarely

stay  in  any  one  part  of  their

territory  more  than  a  few  days

before moving on to another part

where  there  is  more  food.  They

build  temporary  shelters  from

natural  materials  when  they  stop,  leaving  these

behind when they move on.

A lhosk patrol is generally composed entirely of males.

A lhosk troop has the same composition of males, females,

and young as a nest (being simply a lhosk nest moving to

a new encampment).

LHOSKS WITH CLASS LEVELS

A lhosks favored class is ranger, but most lhosk leaders are

druids. Most lhosk choose humanoids (elves) as their favored

enemy due to their many encounters with elves in the woods.

LIVING SPELL

For  reasons  unknown,  in  the  magical  mayhem  of  the

Last War spell effect occasionally took on sentience and

refused to dissipate. These living spells still haunt places

blasted by magic, apparently subsisting on ambient magi-

cal energy. They seem to kill only for pleasure, not out of

any need to feed.

A  living  spell  appears  similar  to  a  normal  spell  effect,

except  thateven  in  the  case  of  an  instantaneous  spell,

such as  reballthe magical energy lingers, writhing and

moving with de nite purpose.

CREATING A LIVING SPELL

Living spell is an unusual template, in that it is applied to

an arcane or divine spell effect (or in some cases, a group

of spell effects) and not a creature. The characteristics of

a living spell are determined by the nature of the spell(s),

including the caster level of the spells. The template can

be applied to any spell that creates an area or effect (not

targeted  spells),  but  not  a  spell  whose  effect  is  already  a

creature (such as a summon monster spell).

A living spell composed of more than one spell uses the

caster level of its highest-level spell for all its spell effects.

Size and Type: A living spells size depends on its caster

level: 1st6th is Medium, 7th12th is Large, 13th or higher

is Huge. Its type is ooze.

Hit Dice: A living spell has Hit Dice equal to its caster

level. Its Hit Dice are d10s.

Speed:  A  living  spells  speed  depends  on  the  spells

range: A spell with a range of close has a speed of 20 feet, a

spell with a range of medium has a speed of 40 feet, and

a spell with a range of long has a speed of 60 feet. A spell

with any other range has a speed of 20 feet. If two spells

with different ranges combine to make a living spell, the

living spells speed is base on the range of the slower of the

two parent spells.

Armor Class: A living spell has a de ection bonus to its

AC equal to its spell level.

Attack:  A  living  spell  gains  a  slam  attack  it  can  use

once per round. The slam attack deals damage based on

the living spells size (see the table below), plus its Strength

bonus    1-1/2.  A  successful  slam  attack  also  affects  the

target as though it were within the spell effect or area (see

Special Attacks, below).

Special Attacks: A living spell has two special attacks.

Spell  Effect  (Su):  A  creature  hit  by  a  living  spells  slam

attack is subjected to the normal effect of the spell or spells

making up the creature, as if it were within the area or effect

of the spell itself. Saves apply as normal for the spell; the DC

is 10 + spell level + Cha modi er.

Engulf (Ex): A living spell can  ow around creatures that

 t within its space as a standard action. It cannot make a

slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The living

spell merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as

many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of oppor-

tunity against the living spell, but if they do so they are not

entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks

of opportunity must succeed on a Re ex save (DC 10 + spell

level + Cha modi er) or be engulfed; on a success, they are

pushed back or aside (opponents choice) as the spell moves

forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the full normal

effect of the spell(s) each round on the living spells turn,

and are considered to be grappled.

Special Qualities: A living spell has ooze traits, damage

reduction  10/magic,  and  spell  resistance  equal  to  10  +  its

caster level.

Saves: A living spell has normal saves for a creature of the

ooze type (no good saves). It gains a resistance bonus on all

saves equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell upon

which it is based.

Abilities: A living spell has Strength, Constitution, and

Charisma scores equal to 10 + its spell level. Its Dexterity

and Wisdom scores are 7 + its spell level. It is mindless, and

has no Intelligence score.

Skills and Feats: Living spells, being mindless, have no

skills or feats.

Environment: Any land. Living spells are found in the

Mournlands and other areas blasted by magic.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: A living spells Challenge Rating is

equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell upon which

it is based, plus one-half its caster level, rounded down (min-

imum CR 1). If the living spell is based on multiple spells,

increase the CR by one-half the sum of the additional spell

levels (minimum increase +1).

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Always neutral. If the original spell had an

alignment, the living spell adds that alignment to its neutral

alignment. For example, an evil spell would spawn a neutral

evil living spell, a chaotic spell a chaotic neutral living spell,

A thick fog bank radiates cold as it drifts toward you.

A chilling fog is a living cone of cold

spell,  subjecting  its  prey  to

deathly frost.

Combat

A chilling fog often lurks

in misty areas, making it

difficult  to  detect  until

it attacks.

Cone  of  Cold  (Su):

A creature hit by a chill-

ing  fogs  slam  attack

or  engulfed  by  it  is

dealt  9d6  points  of

cold  damage  (Reflex

DC 17 half).

Engulf (Ex): A chill-

ing fog can flow around crea-

tures  that  fit  within  its  space  as  a

standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during

a round in which it engulfs. The chilling fog merely has to

move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover.

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against a chill-

ing fog, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving

throw.  Those  who  do  not  attempt  attacks  of  opportunity

must succeed on a DC 17 Re ex save or be engulfed; on a

success, they are pushed back or aside (opponents choice) as

the spell moves forward. Engulfed creatures take 9d6 points

of cold damage (Re ex DC 17 half) and are considered to

be grappled.

A  low  cloud  of  bright,  crackling  motes  of  light  move  along  the

ground, causing tiny explosions in its wake.

Glitter re is a living combination

of  two  spells  commonly  em-

ployed  on  the  war-torn   elds

of  the  Mournlandglitter-

dust and  reball. Armies made

invisible  by  their  allies  were

outlined  through  the  use

of  glitterdust  and  then  de-

stroyed  by  their  enemies

through the judicious use

of  reballs. These two en-

ergies  merged  into  a

single dangerous form that

seeks out creatures and annihi-

lates them in a gout of  ame.

Glitter re  oats a few inches above

the ground, much like a fog.

Combat

Being unintelligent, glitter re simply approaches any living

creature, lighting it up and blinding it with glitterdust while

erupting in tiny, but dangerous, explosions.

Engulf  (Ex):  A  glitter re  can   ow  around  creatures

that fit within its space as a standard action. It cannot

make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. A

glitter  re  merely  has  to  move  over  the  opponents,  affect-

creatures are subject to the full normal effect of the  reball

and glitterdust effects each round on the glitter res turn,

Fireball (Su): A creature hit by a glitter res slam attack

Glitterdust  (Su):  A  creature  hit  by  a  glitter res  slam

Combat

A living blasphemy attacks by slamming into prey with its

Blasphemy (Su): A nonevil creature hit by a living blas-

phemys slam attack or engulfed by the ooze suffers certain

This  stocky,  heavily  muscled  reptilian

human oid stands almost 9 feet in height.

Deep-socketed eyes and flat nasal open-

ings  give  its  face  the  appearance  of

a  skull.  Its  scales  are  black,  and  a

leathery crest running from the top

of its head to the middle of its back

rises up as it sees you. It flexes talon-

tipped fingers and snarls, revealing a

row of vicious fangs.

Like  their  smaller  cousins,  blackscale

lizard folk are primitive reptilian humanoids

that can be very dangerous if provoked.

A blackscale lizardfolk is usually 8-1/2 to 9-1/2

feet tall, and weighs about 600 pounds. Its tail is 4

to 5 feet long.

Blackscale  lizard folk  speak

Draconic,  and  a  blackscale

lizard folk  with  an  Intelli-

gence score of 12 or greater

will also speak Common.

COMBAT

Blackscale  lizardfolk

are  proud  and   erce   ghters,

concerned  with  heroic  action  and  personal  glory.  Left  on

their  own,  they  will  fight  as  disorganized  individuals,

but their leaders can force them to work together for short

periods of time. The blackscales have little patience for

tricks and traps, considering such tools to be the trade of

lesser lizardfolk.

Hold Breath (Ex): A blackscale lizardfolk can hold its

breath for a number of rounds equal to 4  its Constitution

score before it risks drowning (see page 304 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Skills: Because of their tails, blackscale lizardfolk have a

+4 racial bonus on Balance, Jump, and Swim checks.

BLACKSCALE LIZARDFOLK

WITH CLASS LEVELS

Most blackscales advance as barbarians, the races favored

class. Blackscale priests are actually adepts and can select

spells from the Protection and Sun domains.

BLACKSCALE

LIZARDFOLK IN EBERRON

Blackscales  claim  that  their  dark  coloration  and  facial

features are proof of a blood connection to the dragons of

Hakatorvhak, but little proof to this claim exists.

The jungles of Qbarra are home to three distinct spe-

cies  of  lizardfolkthe  blackscales,  the  Cold  Sun  Tribes,

and the poison dusk. The blackscales are the largest of the

three, and throughout the history they have used their size

to dominate and intimidate their smaller kindred. They

are  the  guardians  of  the  sacred  city  of  Hakatorvhak

and  the  warriors  of  the  dragon  Rhashaak.  They  are

proud and arrogant, and are usually extremely hostile

toward humans who trespass into the deep jungles

of Qbarra.

While  their  culture  is  quite  primitive,  the

black scales have access to the vaults and arsenals

of  Hakatorvhak.  High-ranking  warriors  or

priests wear glittering jewels, and the weapons

of the blackscales are often elaborately carved

and  decorated.  The  guardians  of  the  sacred

city may be equipped with better weapons,

shields,  or  armorpossibly

even magic relics from the

deep vaults.

The  blackscales  typi-

cally  live  off  the  tribute

they extract from the oth-

er  tribesof cially,  offer-

ings  made  to  the  great

dragon and its guardians.

The  dragon  priests  hold

the  ultimate  authority

within  society  but  rarely

use this power; in the absence

of  interference  from  a  priest,  the

most  powerful  warrior  rules  the  tribe.  Any  of

the three species of lizardfolk can be called to

serve as dragon priests; the blackscales consider

the priests to be a fourth tribe, and thus see no shame in

following their commands.

LIZARDFOLK,

POISON DUSK

This reptilian humanoid seems to melt out of the shadows of the

jungle. It is about three feet tall, and it has a lean, wiry build. It has

large eyes that reflect the light and a slight crest that runs down the

back of its head. It hisses at you, revealing sharp teeth.

While smaller than their lizardfolk cousins, the poison dusk

lizardfolk are just as dangerous when provoked.

A poison dusk lizardfolk is between 3 to 4 feet in

height,  weighing  4252  pounds.  Its  tail  is  2  to  3

feet long, and its scales shift color with

its  mood.  The  eyes  of  a  poison  dusk

lizardfolk are larger than those of the

other species, and males have a crest running

down the back of the head that can lie  at or

extend based on mood.

Poison  dusk  lizardfolk  speak  Draconic.  A

lizardfolk with an Intelligence score of 12 or

greater will also speak Common.

Most poison dusks encountered in the

wild  are  rangers;  exceptional  indi-

viduals  usually  become  adepts  and

sorcerers serving dragons.

COMBAT

Poison dusks are far more cunning

than  the  other  species  of  lizard-

folk. They prefer to avoid physical

combat  altogether  if  possible;

when  striking  against  a  hu-

man village, they will often

try to poison the water or

food supply instead of launch-

ing a direct assault. When they

do  ght, they favor ambushes

and  clever  traps.  Bolas  and

nets are considered to be martial

weapons for poison dusks, and they

often use these tools to handicap larger foes while

archers strike with poisoned arrows.

Poison Use: Due to their long tradition of working with

venoms, poison dusks are never at risk when applying poisons

to weapons. Common poisons include black adder venom

and blue whinnis.

Chameleon  Skin  (Ex):  Poison  dusks  can  adjust  the

colors of their scales to blend in with their surroundings.

When  it  is  not  wearing  armor,  robes  or  other  covering

clothing, a poison dusk lizardfolk gains a +5 racial bonus

on Hide checks.

Hold Breath (Ex): A poison dusk lizardfolk can hold its

breath for a number of rounds equal to 4  its Constitution

score before it risks drowning (see page 304 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Skills: Because of their tails, lizardfolk have a +4 racial

bonus on Jump, Swim, and Balance checks. The skill modi-

 ers given in the statistics block include a 1 armor check

penalty (2 on Swim checks) for carrying a buckler.

POISON DUSK

LIZARDFOLK IN EBERRON

The poison dusks are one of the three species of lizardfolk

found in Qbarra. Smaller and weaker than the other breeds

of lizardfolk, they are faster and more intelligent than their

larger cousins. They are highly skilled trackers and hunters

and have long used poison, nets, and other tricks to bring

down larger prey.

The  poison  dusks  present  the  greatest  danger  to  the

human  population  of  Qbarra.  After  the  better  part  of  a

century,  they  still  hate  the  warmblooded  invaders  with

a  fiery  passion.  Alone  among  the  lizardfolk,  they  have

adapted  their  tactics  and  traditions  since  the  arrival

of  humanity.  While  they  still  shun  armor,  they  have

adopted the use of swords and bows, which are superior

to the clubs and javelins used by the Cold Sun Tribes and

the blackscale lizardfolk.

While  the  poison  dusks  consider  themselves  to  be  the

superior breed of lizardfolk, they are fanatically devoted

to  the  dragon  Rhashaak  and  acknowledge  the  authority

of  the  blackscales  as  the  chosen  guardians  of  the  great

dragon. The poison dusks generally avoid other lizardfolk,

except when they travel to Hakatorvhak for religious cer-

emonies or to offer tribute to the great dragon. They are

nomadic by nature and rarely stay in one area for more

than a few months. The areas inhabited by the humans of

Qbarra include many of the lands once frequented by these

traveling nomads, and this is a major cause of the friction

between the two species.

LUMI

A solemn and dignified head floats about six inches above the

shoulders of the otherwise headless body of this stocky human-

oid creature. The beings skin softly glows, and white light peeks

between the cracks of its armor.

The lumi are a race of warriors and healers who live on the

Positive Energy Plane. There they build towering cities of

glass and light that are protected from intruders simply by

virtue of the planes dangers to nonnative life. The power of

unchecked positive energy keeps all but the most curious

from even reaching their doorstep.

The lumi worship Light as a concept rather than owing

allegiance to any deity. They praise its ability to uncover

that which is hidden and see it as a symbol of purity and

truth.  The  lumi  themselves  are  honest  to  a  fault  and  are

known for their inability to hold back from telling others

blunt  and  un attering  truths.  They  despise  deception

above all other offenses, and lies (or even simple illusion

spells) are capital crimes within their settlements. Lumi

often travel to the Material Plane to battle wielders of nega-

tive energy or known deceivers. This can make them allies

of good-aligned adventurers for a time, but they put their

own code of honesty and truth ahead of the well-being of

others.  They  think  nothing  of  slaying  those  who  offend

their morality.

An average lumi stands between 5 and 7 feet in height and

weighs 100 to 300 pounds.

Lumi  speak  their  own  language,  Lumi,  as  well  as

Common.

COMBAT

A  lumi  wields  a  golden  morningstar

with  trained  ease  as  it  wades  into

melee.  It  prefers  open  combat  on

a  clear   eld  of  battle,  eschewing

ambush  tactics  entirely.  Lumi

clerics  favor  spells  that  enhance

their warriors over those that di-

rectly affect the enemy.

Body  of  Light  (Su):  A  lumis

body  is  infused  with  a  softly

glowing  positive  energy.  It  is

immune to all death spells, mag-

ical  death  effects,  energy  drain,

and  any  negative  energy  effects

(such  as  from  inflict  spells  or

chill touch).

Lumi are adapted to live on the

Positive  Energy  Plane.  They  nev-

er  gain  additional  temporary  hit

points as a result of being on a plane

with the major positive-dominant en-

ergy  trait  (see  Manual  of  the  Planes,

page 12), and thus are never in danger

of exploding when on the Positive En-

ergy Plane. They still gain full bene t from the fast healing

ability of planes with any positive-energy trait.

A  lumi  sheds  white  light  in  a  5-foot  radius  at  all  times.

It cannot voluntarily suppress this ability, though the light

can be concealed by spells that create darkness.

Clear Vision (Ex): A lumi cannot be blinded or dazzled

by any effect. It can still be effectively blind due to conceal-

ment, such as by darkness or fog. It is speci cally immune

to color spray, rainbow pattern, searing light, sunbeam, sunburst,

or other effects that use direct light as an attack form (such

as a ghaeles light ray attack). Sun blades deal only nonlethal

damage to a lumi.

Floating Head (Ex): A lumis head naturally  oats a few

inches above its shoulders. The creature can rotate its head

in any direction but cannot raise, lower, or otherwise move

its head away from where it  oats; an unseen force prevents

others from moving its head as well. Opponents who  ank a

lumi do not gain the normal +2 bonus on attack rolls. Lumi

are immune to the decapitation power of a vorpal weapon.

They may not be strangled and are immune to suffocation.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willdisrupt  undead  (DC  10),

light; 3/daycure light wounds, glitterdust (DC 12). Caster

level 3rd.

Skills:  A  lumi  has  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Search,  Sense

Motive, and Spot checks.

LUMI CRUSADER

Often seen as the leaders of lumi warparties to other planes,

crusaders  are  trained  from  those  lumi  knights  that  have

shown faith and devotion to the cause of the Light. They are

holy,  erce warriors, using their magic to maximum tactical

advantage while still  ghting effectively.

The lumi crusader presented here had the fol-

lowing ability scores before racial adjustments: Str

13, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 12.

Combat

Crusaders cast their spells in prepara-

tion for combat, reserving only a few

for  healing  their  soldiers  and  other

unforeseen  situations.  Once  battle

begins,  they  lead  the  charge,  seek-

ing to sunder the weapons of any

enemy warriors.

Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (5/5/

5/4; save DC 13 + spell level); 0

cure minor wounds (2), detect magic,

LUMI SOCIETY

The lumi have a highly ordered society with a strict hierarchy

based on their theology. Each settlement is more or less inde-

pendent, though periodically the High Ecclesiastics of many

cities will gather in a hidden cathedral that  oats alone in

the Positive Energy Plane.

The lumi are dedicated to wiping out liars and other deceiv-

ers; they would like nothing more than to invade the Mate-

rial Plane and execute every dishonest creature. Fortunately,

their numbers are far too few for such a scourgeso far. The

lumis numbers are growing quickly. Some worry that within

less than twenty years, the lumi may have enough soldiers to

enact their envisioned cleansing. Such an invasion is likely to

have grave consequences.

A  3-foot-long  strand  of  striated

muscle connects two floating eyeballs.

The strand flexes and twists.

Lurking strangler

Many  species  enjoy  pets  that  resemble

themselves.  Some  humans  keep  monkeys  as

companions and some rakshasas keep house cats.

Gauths and beholders enjoy lurking stranglers.

This lesser creature acts as a companion, pet, and occasional

spy for them.

Lurking stranglers are 3 feet long from eyeball to eyeball.

They weigh 5 pounds.

Lurking  stranglers  understand  Beholder  and  Common.

They  have  neither  a  mouth  nor  any  means  of  speaking.

They communicate by twisting their bodies. A wide-open

posture usually signi es assent, and a tight spiral indicates

fear, tension, or disagreement.

COMBAT

A lurking strangler primarily uses its eye rays to attack. It

can use its entire body to lash at an adjacent foe. However,

it prefers to keep its distance and let its eye rays defeat its

enemies. Once its victims are asleep, it will coil itself around

a foe and choke it to death.

100

Eye Rays (Su): Each of a lurking stranglers two eye rays

resembles a spell cast by a 3rd-level caster. One eye acts as

the cause fear spell, and the other produces a sleep effect. Each

effect is negated with a DC 11 Will save. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

Cause Fear: This ray works like the spell. It has a range of

30 feet.

Sleep:  This  ray  works  like  the  spell,  except  that  it

affects one creature with up to 4 Hit Dice. It has a range

of 130 feet.

Suffocate  (Ex):  If  a  lurking  strangler  hits  a  help-

less foe with its lash attack, it wraps itself around the

victims  throat  and  begins  to  choke  it.  In  the  first

round,  the  victim  falls  unconscious  (0  hit  points).

In  the  following  round,  she  drops  to  1  hit  points

and  is  dying.  In  the  third  round,

she suffocates and dies.

All-Around  Vision  (Ex):

Lurking stranglers are exception-

ally  alert  and  circumspect.  Their

eyes  and  physiology  give  them  a

+4  racial  bonus  on  Spot  checks

and Search checks, and they cant

be  anked.

Flight  (Su):  A  lurking  stran-

glers  body  is  naturally  buoyant.

This  buoyancy  allows  it  to  fly

at  a  speed  of  20  feet.  This  buoy-

ancy  also  grants  it  a  permanent

feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

LURKING STRANGLERS

IN EBERRON

The  daelkyr  (see  page  278  of  the

EBERRON  Campaign  Setting)  created  the

 rst lurking stranglers out of boredom,

and  only  later  did  their  beholder  min-

ions  adopt  them  as  companions  and  pets.

Although  the  beholders   nd  lurking  stranglers

amusing and occasionally useful as sentries and

spies,  the  species  wasnt  spawned  for  either  purpose;

they  merely  serve  as  living  examples  of  the  daelkyrs

willingness to experiment.

LURKING STRANGLERS IN FAERN

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, beholder mages are the

progenitors of lurking stranglers, creating them by means

of a spell. Wherever beholder enclaves are found, so too are

lurking stranglers. Ooltul, a small city in the Underdark,

harbors the largest population of lurking stranglers.

A gigantic elephantlike creature towers before you,

with an extremely long pair of tusks that are nearly as

long as it is.

More vicious and territorial than their more domesticated

cousins,  mastodons  are  ancient  creatures  related  to  ele-

phants. Mastodons usually live in isolated forests, jungles, or

tropical islands. In colder climates, they grow thick coats of

fur, making them look very shaggy. A few species, especially

those that live in snow regions, lack the extended tusks of

the mastodon described here.

A  mastodon  stands  10  feet  high  at  the  shoulder  and

weighs over 4,000 pounds. Mastodon tusks are 12 to 15 feet

long, providing the animal reach with its gore attack.

COMBAT

A mastodon, like an elephant, charges at threatening crea-

tures. A mastodons long tusks allow it to attack at a distance

that far outreaches its opponents ability to melee.

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  half  DC  28.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light  load  for  a  mastodon  is  up

to 4,152 pounds; a medium load, 4,1538,304 pounds; and

a  heavy  load,  8,30512,480  pounds.  A  mastodon  can  drag

62,400 pounds.

MASTODON

ANIMAL COMPANIONS

Druids of 16th level or higher can select mastodon animal

companions. Apply a 15 adjustment to the druids level for

purposes  of  determining  the  companions  characteristics

and special abilities.

MASTODONS IN EBERRON

Herds of mastodons freely wander the untamed hinterlands

of the Tashana Tundra on the continent of Sarlona. Occa-

sionally these enormous animals are captured and brought

to Riedra, becoming beasts of burden for the Inspired. Frost

giants  living  in  the  mountains  of  southern  Xendrik  use

Gargantuan mastodons as mounts. Many ivory hunters have

been lured to their deaths in Xendrik by rumors of great

mastodon graveyards  lled with tusks. A tusk from an adult

mastodon can be sold for 500 gp or more in Khorvaire.

MASTODONS IN FAERN

Mastodons once walked as far west as Vaasa, Damara, and

Narfell.  However,  encroaching  civilization  has  pushed

them  east,  into  the  Endless  Wastes.  There,  small  herds  of

mastodons  still  roam.  However,  the  mastodon  population

dwindles year after year. An ivory tusk from a mastodon can

fetch 500 gp or more in Thay and other lands farther west.

This squat lump of flesh rests on four short, thick legs that pro-

trude from the sides of its body and bend like a spiders. Its flat

snout  and  thick  neck  give  it  the  appearance  of  a  thick-bodied

hairless bulldog, except for its strangely jointed legs and the two

rubbery tentacles it waves aggressively in the air.

Mindshredder larvae are the  rst life stage of a dangerous

group of aberrations known for their ability to detect the

thoughts of living creatures and sap targets of their mental

energy. Larvae feel an insatiable hunger for the mental energy

that  they  feed  upon,  making  them  aggressive  and  nearly

impossible to reason with or train. Larvae are the least pow-

erful form of mindshredders, and their presence typically

indicates that a more powerful group of mindshredder war-

riors or zenthals have moved into an area.

A mindshredder larvas legs radiate from high up on its

body and are jointed like a spiders, leading many to think

the beasts look like  eshy four-legged spiders. Two rubbery

tentacles protrude from the creatures squat torso, and it uses

these to bludgeon its foes and steal their mental energy.

The touch of a mindshredder larvas tentacles deals Wisdom

damage to living creatures. The larva feeds off this mental

energy, and once it has accumulated a suf cient amount, it

can build a chrysalis and transform into a larger, more pow-

erful mindshredder warrior. Mindshredder larvae average 2

feet in length and weigh about 16 pounds.

Mindshredder larvae do not speak, but they understand

Common and Undercommon.

Combat

A mindshredder larva rushes into combat quickly, batter-

ing the nearest foe with its tentacles. Although not smart

enough to devise truly sophisticated tactics, a larva attempts

to  ambush  foes  when  possible.  A  mindshredder  larva  is

perceptive enough to ascertain when its tentacle attacks

are not penetrating the armor of its foe; in such a case, it

attempt touch attacks against that foe rather than regular

melee attacks.

Thought Sense (Su): All mindshredders are sensitive

to  the  thought  emanations  of  living  creatures.  A  mind-

shredder larva usually does not need to make Spot or Listen

checks to pinpoint the location of a living creature with an

Intelligence of 3 or higher within 20 feet. Any opponent

a  mindshredder  cannot  see  still  has  total  concealment

against the mindshredder, and the mind shredder still has

the  normal  miss  chance  when  attacking  foes  that  have

concealment. A mindshredder is still denied its Dexter-

ity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it

cannot see.

A mindshredder need not have line of effect to a crea-

ture to detect it. A mindshredders thought sense ability

can penetrate barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone,

1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of

wood or dirt.

Any creature immune to mind-reading effects (such as a

character under the effect of mind blank) cant be detected

with thought sense.

Wisdom Damage (Su): A mindshredder larva deals hit

point damage as well as 1 point of Wisdom damage each

time it hits a living creature with a tentacle attack. A mind-

shredder larva can also use a tentacle to make a touch attack.

If successful, the touch attack deals no hit point damage but

still deals 1 point of Wisdom damage.

If a mindshredder larva grapples an opponent, that oppo-

nent takes an extra 1 point of Wisdom damage at the begin-

ning of each of the mindshredder larvas turns.

For each point of Wisdom damage that a mind shredder

larva  deals,  it  heals  2  hit  points  of  damage.  If  a  mind-

shredder larva is already at its maximum hit point total,

it gains 2 temporary hit points for each point of Wisdom

damage  it  deals.  These  temporary  hit  points  last  for  a

maximum of 1 hour.

Transformation (Ex): Once a mindshredder larva has

fed on enough mental energy, it can build a cocoon and

transform into a mindshredder warrior. A mindshredder

larva must deal 20 points of Wisdom damage before it

can build its chrysalis. Building the chrysalis requires

one week of work. Once the chrysalis is complete, a larva

must remain in the chrysalis for one month. At the end

of  the  month,  it  emerges  from  the  chrysalis  as  a  mind-

shredder warrior.

A  mindshredder  larvas  chrysalis  has  a  hardness  of  5

and 45 hit points (each chrysalis is 3 inches thick and has

15 hit points per inch of thickness). The hardened resin

of a mindshredder larvas chrysalis is pale rose in color. A

larva inside a chrysalis is helpless and dies if the chrysalis

is destroyed.

Protected by a thick, chitinous shell, the crablike creature before

you has four legs and two powerful, bladelike claws.

Mindshredder warriors are the second life stage of the

strange  species  of  aberrations  called  mindshredders.

They  have  physically  powerful,  crablike  bodies  and

power ful  slashing  claws  made  out  of  a  chitinous  resin

that they secrete.

Mindshredder warriors share a basic body structure with

mindshredder larvae (see above). They have four thick, pow-

erful legs that branch from their squat torso like a spiders.

Each creature also has two thick claws that protrude from

its torso just behind the neck.

The  touch  of  a  mindshredder  warriors  claws  deals

Wis dom  damage  to  living  creatures.  The  warrior  feeds

off  this  mental  energy,  and  once  it  has  accumulated  a

suf cient amount, it can build a chrysalis and transform

into a smaller but magically skilled form called a zenthal

(see below). Mindshredder warriors average 8 feet long and

weigh 1,000 pounds.

Mindshredder  warriors  do  not  speak,  but  they  under-

stand Common and Undercommon.

Combat

Mindshredder  warriors  are  direct  physical  opponents  in

combat. They usually just rush toward the nearest foe and

start slashing with their claws.

Great  Leap  (Ex):  As  a  move  action,  a  mindshredder

warrior  can  make  a  great  leap.  The  creature  can  cover

any  distance  up  to  the  distance  indicated  by  the  result

of  its  Jump  check,  even  if  that  distance  exceeds  its  base

speed.  When  using  this  ability,  a  mindshredder  warrior

calculates distances for standing long and high jumps as

if it were making a running long or high jump. (A typical

mindshredder warrior covers an average distance of about

45 feet with this ability.)

Thought Sense (Su): Like a mindshredder larva, a mind-

shredder warrior is sensitive to the thought emanations of

living  creatures.  A  mindshredder  warriors  thought  sense

functions out to a distance of 40 feet.

Wisdom  Damage  (Su):  A  mindshredder  warrior  deals

hit point damage as well as 1d2 points of Wisdom damage

each time it hits a living creature with a claw attack. A mind-

shredder warrior can also use a claw to make a touch attack.

If successful, the touch attack deals no hit point damage but

still deals 1d2 points of Wisdom damage.

If  a  mindshredder  warrior  grapples  an  opponent,  that

opponent takes an extra 1d2 points of Wisdom damage at

the beginning of each of the warriors turns.

For each point of Wisdom damage that a mindshredder

warrior deals, it heals 2 hit points of damage. If a mind-

shredder warrior is already at its maximum hit point total,

it gains 2 temporary hit points for each point of Wisdom

damage  it  deals.  These  temporary  hit  points  last  for  a

maximum of 1 hour.

Transformation  (Ex):  Once  a  mindshredder  warrior

has fed on enough mental energy, it can build a cocoon and

transform into a mindshredder zenthal. A mindshredder

warrior must deal a total of 80 points of Wisdom damage

before  it  can  build  its  chrysalis.  Building  the  chrysalis

requires one week of work. Once the chrysalis is complete,

the warrior must remain in the chrysalis for a month. At the

end of the month, it emerges from the chrysalis as a mind-

shredder zenthal.

A  mindshredder  warriors  chrysalis  has  a  hardness  of  5

and 90 hit points (the cocoon is 6 inches thick and has 15

hit points per inch of thickness). The hardened resin of a

mindshredder  warriors  chrysalis  is  pale  rose  in  color.  A

warrior inside a chrysalis is helpless and dies if the chrysalis

is destroyed.

Skills: A mindshredder warrior has a +20 racial bonus on

Jump checks.

MINDSHREDDERS IN EBERRON

Mindshredder  larvae,  warriors,  and  zenthals  prey  on

human  oid  communities  in  the  caverns  of  Khyber.  If  a

mind shredder lair lies close enough to the surface, mind-

shredder warriors (accompanied by a zenthal) will occa-

sionally  venture  above ground  in  search  of  prey,  saving

enough of what they find for the hungry mindshredder

larvae left behind.

Challenge Rating: 8

Treasure: None

Alignment: Usually lawful evil

Advancement: By character class

Level Adjustment: 

The strange-looking creature resembles a gaunt, fleshy spider with

only four thin legs. Two tentacles protrude from its shoulders,

swinging over the creatures head and dripping a toxic-looking

slime. The creatures skin has a faint bluish glow, and it is clear

that some strange mystical energy surrounds it.

The  final  and  most  powerful  life  stage  of  the  strange

creatures  known  as  mindshredders,  the  mindshredder

zenthal  combines  powerful  spell-like  abilities  with  the

Wisdom-damaging attacks that all mindshredders share.

Like  other  mindshredders,  zenthals  are  cruel  preda-

tors who feed on the mental energy of living creatures.

Although a zenthal is intelligent enough to reason with

other creatures, it does so only as a means of preserving

its own life or securing intelligent creatures on whom it

and its progeny can feed.

Mindshredder zenthals share a basic body structure that

other mindshredders have, but where other mindshredders

are  squat  and  physically  powerful,  zenthals  are  thin  and

strikingly quick. They have four long legs that branch from

their emaciated torso like a spiders legs. They also have two

thin, slime-coated tentacles that protrude from the torso

just  behind  the  neck.  In  their  transformation  from  war-

riors, mindshredder zenthals shed their chitinous carapace

and gain the ability to generate magical  elds of energy that

resemble the mage armor and shield spells. These magical

protections are nearly invisible, but they give the skin of

the zenthal a bluish glow.

The  touch  of  a  mindshredder  zenthals  tentacles  deals

Wisdom damage to living creatures. Unlike lesser forms of

mindshredders who store this mental energy and use it to

power their transformation into a higher life stage, zenthals

use it to generate offspring. Once a zenthal has dealt 60

points of Wisdom damage, it secrets itself away for a week

while it asexually produces 1d4 mindshredder larvae.

Although larvae and warriors instinctively move in packs

for  protection,  the  zenthals  know  that  these  packs  draw

attention. After giving birth to one or two packs of larvae,

a zenthal usually moves to a new area, leaving the larvae

behind  to  fend  for  themselves.  Mindshredder  zenthals

average 4 feet in length and weigh about 60 pounds.

Mindshredder  zenthals  speak  Common  and  Under-

common.

Combat

A  mindshredder  zenthal  is  a  far  more  intelligent  and

sophisticated  antagonist  than  its  lesser  mindshredder

brethren. Where the larva and warrior incarnations of the

mind shredder rush headlong into battle, a zenthal uses its

spell-like abilities to distract and confuse its foes before

entering melee. When possible, zenthals gather groups of

warrior  and  larva  mindshredders  around  them,  direct-

ing the efforts of these simpler creatures and bene ting

from  the  physical  protection  that  they  offer.  Although

zenthals are willing to sacri ce lesser mindshredders to

save themselves, they are genuinely interested in preserv-

ing the species and do not throw away the lives of any

mindshredder needlessly.

Shield of Force (Su): A magical shield of force protects

a mindshredder zenthal at all times. This shield grants the

zenthal a +4 shield bonus to AC (even against incorporeal

touch attacks, since it is a force effect) and negates magic

missile attacks directed at it (just as a shield spell does).

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayconfusion (DC 20), hypnotic

pattern (DC 18). Caster level 13th.

Thought  Sense  (Su):  Like  the  larva  and  the  warrior,  a

mindshredder  zenthal  is  sensitive  to  the  thought  emana-

tions of living creatures. A mindshredder zenthals thought

sense functions out to a distance of 60 feet.

Wisdom  Damage  (Su):  A  mindshredder  zenthals  ten-

tacles deal 1d4 points of Wisdom damage each time it hits a

living creature with a melee touch attack.

If  a  mindshredder  zenthal  grapples  an  opponent,  that

opponent takes an extra 1d4 points of Wisdom damage at

the beginning of each of the zenthals turns.

For each point of Wisdom damage that a mindshredder

zenthal deals, it heals 2 hit points of damage. If a mind-

shredder zenthal is already at its maximum hit point total,

it  gains  2  temporary  hit  points  for  each  point  of  Wisdom

damage  it  deals.  These  temporary  hit  points  last  for  a

maximum of 1 hour.

Tactics Round-By-Round

A mindshredder zenthal is most effective when it can divide

and distract the party with its spell-like abilities and then

attack one creature at a time.

Prior  to  Combat:  A  mindshredder  zenthal  knows  that

it has little chance of hurting creatures immune to both

mind-affecting abilities and ability score damage. When

confronted by such creatures in the presence of minions or

allies, it directs those minions and allies to concentrate on

such foes  rst. If it encounters such creatures alone, a mind-

shredder zenthal does not hesitate to  ee.

Round 1: Quickened hypnotic pattern, confusion on the

largest  concentration  of  creatures  not  affected  by  the

hypnotic pattern.

Round 2: Quickened hypnotic pattern. If most creatures are

affected by either confusion or one of the two hypnotic pat-

terns, advance and attack the creature that is likely to have

the lowest Wisdom.

Round 3: If more than one foe is unaffected by spell-like

abilities, confusion. If (after the second confusion) facing only

one creature not under the effect of confusion or hypnotic

pattern, continue  ghting; otherwise, retreat.

MINDSHREDDER SOCIETY

Although the aberrations are organized and ef cient in their

own way, mindshredder society more closely resembles a

colony  of  vermin  than  the  sophisticated  cultures  of  the

civilized races. Mindshredders are grouped by colony, led

by a group of the eldest zenthals.

While most members of a minshredder colony have far

less sophisticated mental capacity than the average human,

the zenthal rulers are smarter on average than any of the

common  races.  The  warriors  and  larvae  in  the  colony

instinctively obey these leaders. These zenthals zealously

protect the colony from discovery, using sophisticated

and subtle techniques to hide the true location of

the colony. Often, a small number of zenthals

sets up a few satellite colonies some distance away from the

main community and populates it with a variety of mind-

shredders. These stations serve as guard outposts and as a

staging area for exploration or raids. Any major movement

from the main colony, such as an assault on a surface com-

munity, is careful to travel through one of the satellites and

return by the same route. If attacked, the mindshredders,

even the zenthals, in the satellite colonies, loyally  ght to

the  death,  as  if  defending  their  home  and  young.  These

sacri ces,  although  painful  to  the  mindshredders,  serve

the greater good of protecting the larger numbers of larvae

and mindshredders caught in their chrysalis transforma-

tions in the main colony. Recognizing a satellite colony is

no easy task, but a character who studies a mindshredder

colony for at least a minute can attempt a DC 35 Knowl-

edge (dungeoneering) check to determine the true nature

of the colony.

The species prefers underground cavern complexes for

their  colony  lairs.  A  new  colony  settles  in  natural  tun-

nels and caves. They focus first on making the area safe

and producing larvae. Both mindshredder warriors and

mind shredder zenthals are capable of bearing young, and

both produce the same brutish larvae when they repro-

duce. As the colony grows and more minshredders in the

settlement  go  through  the  chrysalis  process,  the  more

alien-looking  the  caverns  become.  The  mindshredders

reshape their living area with strangely twisted pillars of

the chrysalis material. They also line the nat-

ural tunnels with chrysalis material, making

the passages more confining. The thickness of

the materials coating the tunnels reveals the age of

a settlement.

MIVILORN

Resembling a very large elephant crossed with a dog, this crea-

ture has a massive, oversized head with jutting, ragged teeth and

loose skin on its jowls.

The mivilorn thrives when fending for itself on the plane

of Acheron, and it is also a favorite war mount of many

demons. Mivilorns are very aggressive when encountered

in the wild, and they hunt Medium and larger creatures

for food.

A mivilorn has a blocky, solid body much like that of an

elephant and is covered with a wrinkled, tough, dark gray,

hairless hide. The body of a wild mivilorn is almost always

covered with caked-on mud. The large feet of a mivilorn are

more lionlike than elephantine. Although the creature

never uses its feet for attacks because of its weight, the

mivilorn has a surprising degree of dexterity

for its size, in part because of the structure

of its feet.

The  most  prominent  feature  of  a  mi-

vilorn  is  its  massive  head  that  is  as

wide  as  its  body.  The  shape  of

the  head  resembles  that  of  a

mastiffs,  but  with  even  more

pronounced  loose,  hanging

skin on either side of its jowls.

This loose skin allows a mi-

vilorn  to  open  its  mouth

incredibly wide and swal-

low  smaller  prey  whole,

sometimes more than one

at a time.

Fully open, the mouth

of  a  mivilorn  can  be  up

to 8 feet wide and 7 feet

from lower to upper jaw.

It  is   lled  with  large,

ragged  teeth  designed

for  crushing  and  pierc-

ing prey. The large jowls also

house glands that secrete a potent digestive

acid that can be seen dripping from the teeth and

gums  of  a  mivilorns  mouth,  oozing  out  even  when  the

mouth is closed. A large part of a mivilorns digestion occurs

in its mouth.

A typical mivilorn stands nearly 14 feet tall at the shoul-

der, is around 18 feet in length, and weighs at least 8 tons.

Mivilorns do not speak, but they understand simple com-

mands in Abyssal.

Mivilorn

Breath Weapon (Su): 3/dayAs a free action, a mivilorn

can  spew  out  digestive  acid  on  its  opponents.  This  breath

weapon  is  a  15-foot  cone,  and  it  deals  5d4  points  of  acid

damage to any caught in the area (Re ex DC 23 half). The

save DC is Dexterity-based.

Charging Bite (Ex): When charging, a mivilorn opens

its expansive mouth to its fullest width in order to swal-

low one or more opponents whole. If a mivilorn succeeds

on  a  bite  attack  at  the  end  of  a  charge,  the  victim  must

make a DC 23 Re ex save to avoid being scooped into the

creatures  expanded,  open  mouth.  A  mivilorn  can  scoop

up  a  single  Large  creature,  or  two  creatures  of  Medium

or smaller size in the same attack if they are adjacent. In

the latter case, the mivilorn makes one attack roll against

the  opponent  with  the  higher  AC.  If  the

creature  hits,  both  opponents  take  bite

damage,  and  each  gets  its  own  Reflex

save to avoid being trapped in the toothy

cage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): In order to

swallow an opponent without charg-

ing,  a  mivilorn  must  hit  a  Large  or

smaller opponent with its bite attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple

as  a  free  action  without  provoking

attacks  of  opportunity.  If  it

wins  the  grapple  check,  it  es-

tablishes  a  hold  and  can

try to swallow the foe the

following round.

Swallow  Whole  (Ex):  A

swallowed  creature  automatical-

ly  takes  6d4  points  of  bite  dam-

age every round in addition

to  the  maximum  dam-

age from the mivilorns

acid  attack  (8  points).

A  mivilorn  spews  out

any  creature  or  crea-

tures  that  succeed  in

dealing  a  total  of  40  points  of  dam-

age  to  its  mouth  (which  has  damage  reduction  15/

bludgeoning and an AC of 16). Trapped creatures may only

use light melee weapons.

After  3  rounds  of  chewing  on  an  opponent,  a  mivi-

lorn spits it out to see if it is dead. If its still alive, the

mivilorn attempts to grapple and swallow the creature a

second time.

COMBAT

When  attacking  from  a  distance,  a  mivilorn  instinctively

charges in order to use its charging bite special attack.

A mivilorns natural weapons are treated as chaotic-aligned

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A mivilorn normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking  a  15  penalty  on  its  attack  rolls  and  gaining  a  +15

bonus on damage rolls.

ELITE DEMON WAR MOUNT

A  mivilorns  size  and  ferocity  make  it  valuable  as  a  war

mount for those brave and skilled enough to ride it. Mivi-

lorns  are  most  typically  found  roaming  the  plane  of  Pan-

demonium and can be pressed into service as war mounts

in the armies of demons, who tenaciously guard the secrets

they use to subdue and train these creatures. A mivilorn

that  is  not  controlled  magically  attacks  its  own  rider  or

trainer, neglecting all other adversaries, following the roll

Hit Dice and ability scores.

MIVILORNS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, mivilorns are native to

the war-torn plane of Shavarath. They are also found in

the deep caverns of Khyber, lurking in the former lairs

of  their  demonic  masters  who  have  since  been  trapped

or destroyed.

MIVILORNS IN FAERN

In  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign  setting,  mivilorns

roam the plane of Furys Heart. They are also encountered

as mounts on Blood Rift, where they serve demons  ghting

in the Blood War.

A  towering  shape  seemingly  built

from bones and corpses, this crea-

ture  rolls  and  lurches  across

the ground, searching around

itself  with  four  massive,

angular arms.

The  necronaut  is  an  un-

dead  monstrosity  that

abhors  life.  It  commu-

nicates  grudgingly  with

constructs and other undead,

from whom others have learned what lit-

tle  is  known  about  these  macabre  crea-

tures.  Necronauts  are  created  by  demons

that on plains of bones in the Abyss and then

sent forth to the Material Plane to kill, and to

grow by adding bones and corpses to their hulking forms.

Individual  necronauts  vary  in  shape  but  average  about

20 feet tall, 20 feet wide, and 30 to 40 feet long; each one

weighs some 50 tons.

A necronaut speaks Infernal and rarely bothers to learn

other languages.

Necronaut

108

COMBAT

A necronaut attacks by crushing as many opponents as it

can  beneath  itself,  then  attacking  any  survivors  with  its

slam attacks.

A  necronauts  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any  weapons

it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A necronaut normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus

on damage rolls.

Assimilate Corpse (Su): A necronaut can, as a move

action, add the corpse of an opponent to its body. Once

the  corpse  is  added,  the  necronaut  begins  assimilating  it.

This process takes 1 round to run its course and heals some

damage to the necronaut, based on the size of the assimi-

lated creature: Small or smaller, 10 points healed; Medium,

30 points; Large, 60 points; Huge, 100 points; Gargantuan,

150 points; or Colossal, 210 points. Once a creature is fully

assimilated, it cannot be raised from the dead. Before a crea-

ture is fully assimilated, an ally can pull it free with a DC 24

Strength check.

Necromantic Effects (Su): Necronauts are affected dif-

ferently by some spells. Because each one is composed of

bones  and  corpses,  spells  that  create  undead

deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to

a necronaut, up to the maximum given here for

each spell: animate dead, 10d4; create undead, 15d4;

create greater undead, 20d4.

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  half

DC 41. The save DC is Strength-

based.

Unholy Toughness (Ex):

A necronaut gains a bonus to its

hit points equal to its Charisma

modi er  its Hit Dice.

NECRONAUTS

IN EBERRON

Necronauts  are  jugger-

nauts that roam the Mourn-

land, collecting bones and

corpses and increasing in

size and toughness as they

do.  The  warforged  that  fol-

low the Lord of Blades have had

some limited success in control-

ling  a  few  of  them,  but  mostly

they  go  where  they  will.  Those

war forged  also  know  that  necro-

nauts form near sinister planar rifts that

haunt the Mournland.

Planar travelers have sought necronauts on the plane of

Dolurrh, not realizing that they are native to the plane of

Mabar, the Endless Night.

A wave of tiny, brightly colored dinosaurs chirps and whistles as

it cascades over the ground.

Named for their large, incredibly sharp fangs, needletooth

dinosaurs are extremely dangerous predators that hunt in

massive swarms, tearing apart land animals the same way

piranhas devour their prey. Always hungry, needletooth

swarms  prowl  the  underbrush  of  jungles  and  have  no

compunctions about what they eat. They are inquisitive,

fearless,  and  quickly  overcome  any  skittishness  toward

strange  or  unusual  beasts  that  may  stumble  into  their

jungle territory.

Needletooth  dinosaurs  are  crafty  and  patient  hunters

that will stalk and harry prey for miles before closing in

for the kill. They are noted for their high-pitched trilling

sound, which can seem harmless, almost cute, until a swarm

descends on its target.

Needletooth  dinosaurs  stand  1  foot  tall  and  weigh

2 pounds.

COMBAT

A  needletooth  swarm  seeks  to  surround  and  attack  any

living  prey  it  encounters.  A  swarm  deals  3d6  points  of

damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end

of its move.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a

needletooth swarms damage that begins its turn with a

swarm in its space is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude

DC  17  negates  the  effect.  Even  after  a  successful  save,

Needletooth swarm

needletooth swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20

+ spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concen-

tration  requires  a  DC  20  Concentration  check.  The  save

DC is Constitution-based.

Wounding  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  damaged  by  a

needletooth swarm continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point

per  round  thereafter.  Multiple  wounds  do  not  result  in

cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a

DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some

other healing magic.

Skills:  *Needletooth  swarms  gain  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Hide checks when in areas of dense foliage, jungle, or heavy

underbrush.

NEEDLETOOTH

SWARMS IN EBERRON

Needletooth swarms scour the jungles and ruins of Qbarra,

particularly in and around the ancient city of Hakatorvhak.

They are also found in Dajar Orioth (the Jungle of Daggers)

in  Aerenal.  A  variety  of  needletooth  swarm  found  in  the

northern  jungles  of  Xendrik  carries  the  red  ache  disease

(see page 292 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

NEEDLETOOTH SWARMS IN FAERN

Needletooth swarms can be found in the Jungles of Chult

and  the  Black  Jungles.  Some  varieties  of  needletooth

swarms are poisonous (Fortitude DC 17, initial and second-

ary damage 1d3 Dex) and have a Challenge Rating of 7. The

poisons save DC is Constitution-based.

You see a large, black, leafless tree charac-

terized  by  unnatural  and  unsettling  shapes.

It  radiates  gloomy  twilight,  nightmares,

and sorrow.

its despair song. A typical night twist stands 15 feet tall and

weighs 600 pounds.

Night twists rarely speak, but they understand Common,

Elven, and Sylvan.

COMBAT

A night twist, when actively seeking victims, sends out its

despair song in order to bring prey to it. When those lured

by the song are within range, a night twist uses its phantas-

mal killer spell-like ability. A night twist employs its power-

ful slam attack only if opponents  rst survive the illusion.

The creature uses its entangle and deeper darkness spell-like

abilities  to  keep  opponents  from  escaping.  When  a  night

twist feels threatened, it uses its wind attack and fear spell-

like ability.

Death Curse (Su): Killing a night twist invites a curse

similar to that bestowed by the nightmare spell. The crea-

ture dealing the death blow must make a DC 22 Will save

to avoid being cursed with hideous and unsettling night-

mares that prevent restful sleep and deal 1d10 points of

damage.  The  recipient  becomes  fatigued  and  unable  to

prepare or ready arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The

nightmares and resulting damage affect the subject every

night  until  the  curse  is  removed  or  the  victim  dies.  If

the curse is removed, the victim remains fatigued for 24

hours thereafter.

A limited wish spell or more powerful magic cast while the

subject is in the throes of a nightmare is the only way

to remove a night twists death curse.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Long  before  luckless  travelers

in  more  remote  and  forebod-

ing  marshes  see  the  harrowing

sight of a lone night twist, they hear

its  haunting  and  melancholy

song.  The  ghostly  moan-

ing sounds of its song seem

slightly  different  to  every

traveler. For some, the song of

the  night  twist  sounds  like  a

women  weeping.  To  others,

it is more akin to a cold wind

blowing over a desolate grave-

yard. Most likely, the despair

song of a night twist is the most

sorrowful sound each traveler

can  conjurer  within  his  or

her own mind.

Night twists subsist in the

most  inhospitable  marshes,

feeding on the rotting carcasses

of creatures and travelers attracted by

110

Night twist

If the victim of a night twist vic-

tim  dies  and  is  interred,  a  new  night

twist  springs  from  where  the  corpse

was  laid  one  month  later.  While  the

creature is developing, a night twist sap-

ling appears at the gravesite; the

creature seems to be a normal

(nonintelligent)  plant  until  it

reaches maturity.

Despair Song (Su): Every eve-

ning,  a  night  twist  emits  a  sor-

rowful  sound  that  inspires

melancholy and despair in all

creatures with an Intelligence

score of 6 or higher within a radius

of  ve miles per Hit Die of the night

twist.  Those  who  fail  a  DC  22  Will

save are affected as if by a crush-

ing despair spell and must seek

out the source of their sorrow

(the  night  twist)  to  the  neglect

of all other tasks or needs, in-

cluding eating or sleeping. If

physically restrained and not

allowed to seek out the night

twist,  a  victim  of  this  despair

song  loses  1d10  hit  points  every

evening until it dies or the enchantment

is removed. Relocating a victim outside the area affected by

the night twists song does not end the enchantment.

The despair song ceases to affect a subject in the round

after  the  night  twist  makes  a  slam  attack  against  it.  To

remove the effects of the night twists despair song before

it attacks, a limited wish or more powerful magic must be

employed. Dispel magic or dispel evil spells cannot remove

the enchantment. However, a bard of 12th level or higher

using the song of freedom class feature can provide the subject

a second Will save. The death of the night twist always ends

the enchantment. A night twists caster level is equal to its

Hit Dice for the purpose of its despair song ability. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayblight (DC 20) , deeper dark-

ness, entangle, fear (DC 19), phantasmal killer (DC 19) . Caster

level 10th.

Unholy  Grace  (Su):  A  night  twist  adds  its  Charisma

modi er as a bonus on all its saving throws, and as a de ec-

tion bonus to its Armor Class.

Wind  Blast  (Su):  A  night  twists  wind  blast  ability

is similar to the gust of wind spell. The creature can use

its wind blast as a free action, but does so only when it

feels  threatened.  A  powerful,  gale-force  wind  (50  mph)

emanates from the tree in all directions out to 120 feet.

All other effects of the wind blast are the same as those

of the gust of wind spell. Any creature in the affected area

can avoid the effect with a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

If a night twist is attacked with  re, it uses its wind blast

to extinguish the  ames.

Skills: *Night twists gain a +16 racial bonus on Hide

checks in swamps or marshes where other trees and foli-

age thrive.

Night  twists  live  for  an  inde nite  length  of  time.  Some

legends claim the age of the most ancient specimens can

be counted in millennia. Feeding off the despair, fear, and

corpses of victims over hundreds of centuries and growing

to a height of 30 feet or more, an ancient night twists is a

horrifying  and  daunting  spectacle  to  mortals.  Each  one

weighs  some  4,500  pounds  and  speaks  Common,  Elven,

and Sylvan.

COMBAT

In addition to the special abilities and qualities inherent

in a younger specimen, an ancient night twist has even

deadlier  powers  and  spell-like  abilities  in  its  arsenal.

This creature uses its spell-like abilities before resorting

to its powerful slam attack. It summons plants to its aid

if faced by superior numbers. The save DCs (DC 28) for

an  ancient  night  twists  death  curse,  despair  song,  and

wind blast are adjusted for its higher Charisma score and

increased Hit Dice.

Spell-Like Abilities: 5/dayphantasmal killer (DC 20);

3/dayblight (DC 21), circle of death (DC 22), deeper darkness,

entangle (DC 17), fear (DC 20), insanity (DC 23); 1/dayweird

(DC 25). Caster level 20th.

NIGHT TWISTS IN EBERRON

Rangers  of  the  Eldeen  Reaches  have  heard  and  felt  the

despair song of night twists in their forests. These night

twists watch over the unplundered tombs and overgrown

barrows of evil druids and barbarian kings who ruled the

land in ancient times. Much older night twists can be found

throughout Xendrik, taking root in and around the cyclo-

pean ruins of fallen giant cities, their songs of despair luring

explorers to a swift doom.

NIGHT TWISTS IN FAERN

The horrible lament of the night twist has been heard in

the wooded depths of Cormanthor, but night twists are not

friends of the elves or any other creature that inhabits the

ancient forest. They inhabit the darkest reaches, taking root

near the tombs of elf kings, fallen temples, and the bones

of  slain  dragons.  Night  twists  even  threaten  travelers

seeking the ruins of Myth Drannor. The night twists song

can also be heard as far west as the Silver Marches, in par-

ticular in the Far Forest near such forlorn sites as Masulks

Tomb and Taerymdoom.

NYCTER

An odd creature looking like a cross between a bat and a halfling

peers down at you from where it hangs from the cave ceiling. Its

face has a pair of slits that extend from the nostrils to just below

its eyes, and its tail ends in a T shape.

Nycters are cave-dwelling batfolk that strive to live peace-

ably and well. Distantly related to the desmodus (described

in Monster Manual II), they view their larger cousins as

barbaric savages, akin to the way many humans view ogres.

Likewise,  desmodus  view  nycters  as  lesser  beings,  simple

folk not as brainy or ambitious as their own race.

Nycter culture and society revolve around the cave and

the community. Nycters have a keen sense of duty to their

group and do their utmost to contribute to it.

A nycter stands 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs

20 to 25 pounds. The creatures wing

colors range from pale tan to dark

gray,  and  the  fur  tones  are  tan,

brown, or gray.

Nycters  speak  their  own

language, known as Nycter.

The few who travel outside

their home territory (usu-

ally as adventurers or emis-

saries) know Common.

COMBAT

Nycters  prefer  peace

over  war.  If  they  encounter

other  creatures  without  being

noticed  in  turn,  they  often

choose  to  avoid  them  al-

together.  If  confronted,

they  parlay  and  seek

harmonious  solutions.

However, they  ght  erce-

ly  to  defend  themselves  or

their territory.

Hunting Cry (Su): A nycter can emit a high, piercing

shriek that damages and paralyzes its prey (30-foot cone,

once  every  2d4  rounds,  damage  2d4  sonic  plus  paralysis

for  1d4+1  rounds,  Fortitude  DC  11  halves  damage  and

negates paralysis). This is a sonic mind-affecting ability. A

creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by

the same nycters hunting cry for 24 hours. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Blindsense (Ex): A nycter uses echolocation to pinpoint

creatures within 60 feet. Opponents still have total conceal-

ment against the nycter unless it can actually see them.

Skills:  Nycters  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Spot  and

Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if their blindsense

is negated.

Nycter

Combat

Before entering battle, a nycter defender of the cave casts

bears endurance and bulls strength on itself, followed by magic

fang on its dire bat animal companion. It uses its hunting cry

before entering melee combat. Once battle is joined, it relies

on its weapons and magic items more than its spells.

Hunting Cry (Su): The save DC for this defender of the

caves hunting cry (DC 13) is adjusted for its higher Consti-

tution score.

Animal  Companion  (Ex):  This  defender  of  the  cave

has a dire bat as an animal companion (see Monster Manual,

page 62).

Nature  Sense  (Ex):  This  nycter  gains  a  +2  bonus  on

Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.

Resist Natures Lure (Ex): This nyct-

er  gains  a  +4  bonus  on  saving  throws

against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Trackless Step (Ex): This nycter

leaves  no  trail  in  natural  surround-

ings and cannot be tracked.

Wild  Empathy  (Ex):  This

nycter  can  improve  the  attitude

of  an  animal  in  the  same  way

that  a  Diplomacy  check  can

improve the attitude of a per-

son.  The  druid  rolls  1d20+5

to determine the wild empa-

thy check result (1d20+1 if at-

tempting to in uence a magical

beast with an Intelligence score

of 1 or 2).

Wild  Shape  (Su):  This  druid

can change into a Small or Medium

animal  and  back  again  once  per  day,

for up to 5 hours.

Woodland  Stride  (Ex):  This

nycter  can  move  through  natural

thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and sim-

ilar  terrain  at  its  normal  speed  and  without  taking

damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and

overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede

motion still affect it.

Typical Druid Spells Prepared: 0create water, cure minor wounds,

detect magic, light, virtue; 1stcharm animal (DC 15), cure light

wounds, magic fang, produce  ame; 2ndbears endurance, bulls

strength, heat metal (DC 16); 3rdmeld into stone, wind wall.

Possessions: +1 scimitar, +1 sling, bag of tricks (rust), wand of entan-

gle, potion of heroism, potion of shield of faith +3, 20 sling bullets.

Defender of the Cave Animal Companion

Nycter druids often take a dire bat as an animal companion;

they  feel  a  kinship  and  protective  duty  toward  most  bats

and batlike creatures. Because of this defender of the caves

druid levels, this dire bat knows one bonus trick.

Dire Bat Animal Companion: CR 2; Large animal; HD

4d8+12;  hp  30;  Init  +6;  Spd  20  ft.,   y  40  ft.  (good);  AC  20,

touch 15,  at-footed 14; Base Atk +3; Grp +10; Space/Reach 10

ft./5 ft.; Atk or Full Atk +5 melee (1d8+4, bite); SQ blindsense

NYCTER DEFENDER OF THE CAVE

A nycter that has earned the title defender of the cave holds

a prominent position in a nycter community, usually acting

landscape at random, destroying whatever they encounter

as they roll ever onward.

Powerful beings can force odopis to travel where they

wish, using violence and the threat of violence to keep them

on the right path. Odopis, having a strong sense of indepen-

dence, suffer such treatment poorly, but they remain some-

what tractable so long as they are provided with targets upon

which they can vent their rage. Odopis average 24 feet in

diameter and weigh 9 tons.

Odopis  speak  their  own  language,  which  consists  of

gurgling sounds and hand clapping.

COMBAT

An  odopi  tramples  foes  to  get  within  reach  of  several

enemies at a time. It grapples foes and tramples them as

it  pursues  other  enemies.  If  enemies  move  beyond  its

reach, the odopi swallows those

it  grapples  and  throws  stones.

Flying foes should be sure to fly

out of range of the odopis dimen-

sion  door  ability,  or  it  is  likely  to

appear above them and bear them

to the ground.

Although  its  hands  are  dexter-

ous  enough  to  grasp,  move,  and

throw  objects,  an  odopi  can-

not  wield  melee  or  ranged

weapons  other  than  those  that

can be thrown.

An  odopis  claw  attacks,

and  any  objects  it  throws,  are

treated  as  chaotic-aligned,  evil-

aligned,  and  magic  for  the  pur-

pose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

An  odopi  normally  at-

tacks  using  its  Power  Attack

feat,  taking  a  5  penalty  on

its attack rolls and gaining a +5

bonus on damage rolls.

This  creature  looks  like  a  giant  sphere  of

hundreds  of  demonic  clawed  arms.  The

center of its body is hidden by the forest of

its limbs. Each hand bears a yellow eye in its

palm that blinks shut as the behemoth rolls

hand-over-hand toward you.

Odopi

Twisted abominations from the Tarterian Depths of Carceri,

odopis are strange creatures that boil out of planar rifts to

rampage across the Material Plane.

Akin to no other beings, odopis are nightmarish monsters

from a nightmare realm. Hundreds of warty, orange-skinned

arms project from a muscular central body obscured by its

 ailing limbs. This body has no features except for a single

toothless mouth that serves as the opening for its cavern-

ous  stomach.  Each  arm  bears  a   ve- ngered  hand  and

long yellow claws. A baleful eye glares from the palm of

each hand. Like titanic tumbleweeds, they roam about the

Improved Grab (Ex): To use

this ability, an odopi must hit a Large

or smaller creature with its claws. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a free action with-

out provoking attacks of opportunity.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willfeather fall; 3/day

dimension door; 1/daytrue seeing. Caster level 18th.

Swallow Whole (Ex): Although an odopi lacks a mouth

in  the  usual  sense,  it  can  swallow  foes  by  passing  them

through its forest of arms to the center of its body. If an

odopi begins its turn while pinning a Medium or smaller

creature, it can move the pinned foe into its stomach (deal-

ing the bludgeoning and acid damage given below) in lieu

of making a grapple check to deal damage.

A  swallowed  creature  is  considered  grappled,  but  the

odopi  is  not.  A  swallowed  creature  takes  1d8+10  points

of  bludgeoning  damage  and  2d8  points  of  acid  damage

each round. A creature can cut its way out by using a light

piercing or slashing weapon to deal 40 points of damage to

the stomach (AC 17). Once a creature exits, muscular action

closes  the  hole;  another  swallowed  opponent  must  cut  its

own way out. Regardless of how it escapes, a creature that

exits the stomach is back in the odopis many arms and the

creature is automatically considered grappled.

An odopis stomach can hold 1 Medium, 4 Small, 16 Tiny,

64 Diminutive, or 256 Fine creatures.

Throw  Stones  (Ex):  As  a  full-round  action,  an  odopi

can pick up stones or other objects of Tiny size weighing

up  to  20  pounds  and  hurl  them  at  foes.  The  attack  has  a

range increment of 30 feet, and an odopi can hurl a stone

up to  ve range increments. Each stone deals 1d6+7 points

of  damage.  An  odopi  can  make  up  to  four  stone  attacks

per round, but it cannot direct more than one stone at any

single target.

Trample (Ex): Re ex half DC 27. The save DC is Strength-

based. An odopi can use its trample ability as a full-round

action  while  grappling  (no  grapple  check  required).  If

an odopi uses its trample ability while holding a foe, the

grappled  enemy  automatically  takes  trample  damage  (no

save) as the odopi rolls over it.

All-Around Vision (Ex): Odopis are exceptionally alert.

Their many eyes give them a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks

and Search checks, and they cant be  anked.

Skills: Odopis have a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks.

An odopi has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can

always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed

or threatened.

mally attacks using its Power Attack feat, taking a 10 pen-

alty on its attack rolls and gaining a +10 bonus on damage

odopi uses its trample ability while holding a foe, the grappled

enemy automatically takes trample damage (no save) as the

odopi rolls over it.

Skills: Elder odopis have a +8 racial bonus on Survival

checks.  An  elder  odopi  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb

even if rushed or threatened.

ODOPIS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, odopis are native to the

plane  of  Xoriat,  also  known  as  the  Realm  of  Madness.

Powerful specimens brought to the world by fell wizardry

lurk  in  the  great  caverns  of  Khyber,  sometimes  guarding

extraplanar portals or  endish redoubts. The Lords of Dust

occasionally unleash odopis upon the blasted plains of the

Demon  Wastes,  usually  when  they  wish  to  dispose  of  a

troublesome barbarian tribe.

OGRE, SKULLCRUSHER

This  8-foot-tall  brute  resembles  an  ogre  but  looks  to  be

more  intelligent,  and  it  stands  more  erect.  Its  armor  and

shield  are  covered in spikes, and it carries a vicious-looking

morningstar.

Skullcrusher  ogres  are  an  offshoot  of  the  ogre

stock  bred  for  war.  Shorter  and  less  brutish

than  typical  ogres,  skullcrusher  ogres  are

nevertheless stronger and more dangerous.

Thuggish  and  sadistic,  bellicose  and

rowdy, skullcrusher ogres enjoy bully-

ing weaker creatures. Tribes often

keep  slaves,  which  in  many  cases

are normal ogres.

Created long ago to serve as sol-

diers,  skullcrusher  ogres  have

naturally  centered  their  culture

on  warfare,  and  their  villages  are

arrayed  like  military  encamp-

ments. Skullcrusher ogres build

siege walls and other structures

to defend their homes, and they

train  elephants  for  mounted

combat.

An  adult  skullcrusher  ogre

stands 8 to 9 feet tall and weighs

550 to 600 pounds. The crea-

tures  skin  color  ranges  from

pale  yellow  to  pale  brown,  and

their  hair  tends  to  be  black.  Skullcrusher  ogres

wear armor during their waking hours and little

clothing when sleeping.

Skullcrusher ogres speak Giant and Common.

COMBAT

Skullcrusher ogres are born  ghters. They love the clangor

and calamity of battle.

A  skullcrusher  ogre  gleefully  charges  into  combat  and

strikes at foes with both its morningstar and spiked shield.

A  skullcrusher  ogre  especially  enjoys  grappling  foes  and

crushing them on his spiked armor. (A successful grapple

check  to  deal  damage  causes  1d4+7  points  of  nonlethal

damage plus 1d8 points of piercing damage.)

Rock Throwing (Ex): Like giants, skullcrusher ogres

are accomplished rock throwers and gain a +1 racial bonus

on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A skullcrusher ogre

can hurl rocks of 40 to 50 pounds (Small objects) up to  ve

range  increments.  The  range  increment  is  100  feet  for  a

skullcrusher ogres rocks.

SKULLCRUSHER SERGEANT

Skullcrusher warbands typically include one or more ser-

geants armed with bastard swords.

The skullcrusher sergeant presented here had the follow-

ing ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 15, Dex 13,

Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.

Combat

Skullcrusher sergeants are canny  ghters. Even when con-

fronted by a well-armored foe, a sergeant will often use its

Power Attack feat, taking a 4 penalty on attack rolls

to gain a +4 bonus on damage. However, it

usually  commands  nearby  allies  to  aid

its attacks, hoping to counter the attack

penalty from the Power Attack feat.

SOCIETY

Although they are as ill-tempered as

their ogre brethren, skullcrusher ogres

understand  the  importance  of  disci-

pline  within  their   ghting  squads.

The  warband  becomes  their  family,

of sorts. Their swords and shields be-

come their trusted companions. While

lesser ogres allow fatigue, hunger, and

petty greed to get the better of them,

skullcrushers tirelessly rehearse battle

tactics, sharpen their blades, and survey

the terrain of the lands they intend to

conquer, looking for tactically advan-

tageous ground on which to  ght.

A strict hierarchy governs each

skullcrusher warband. The smart-

est  and  mightiest  skullcrusher

leads  the  warband  until  the  day

he falls in battle, at which point his

chosen  successor  takes  command,

often claiming the weapons and trophies of her fallen

predecessor. A skullcrusher must  ght for her place

in the chain of command, and all challenges among mem-

bers of the warband are resolved through nonlethal combat.

Although incapable of feeling deep love for a comrade-in-

arms, a skullcrusher knows better than to take the life of an

ally and wouldnt think to deprive another skullcrusher of

the chance to die a glorious death on the battle eld.

SKULLCRUSHER OGRES

AS CHARACTERS

Most exceptional skullcrusher ogres are  ghters or rangers.

Skullcrusher ogre characters possess the following traits.

 +14 Strength, +6 Constitution, 2 Charisma.

Large  size.  1  penalty  to  Armor  Class,  1  penalty

on attack rolls, 4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on

grapple  checks,  lifting  and  carrying  limits  double  those

of Medium characters.

Space/Reach: 10 ft./10 ft.

A skullcrusher ogres base land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Low-light vision.

Racial Hit Dice: A skullcrusher ogre begins with eight

levels  of  giant,  which  provide  8d8  Hit  Dice,  a  base  attack

bonus of +6, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +6, Ref

+2, and Will +2.

Racial Skills: A skullcrusher ogres giant levels give

it skill points equal to 11  (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1).

SKULLCRUSHER OGRES IN EBERRON

Skullcrusher ogres populate the armies of Droaam. They are

Omnimental

Environment: Elemental Plane of Fire

Organization: Solitary

Challenge Rating: 15

Treasure: None

Alignment: Usually neutral

Advancement:  3348  HD  (Gargantuan);  4964  HD

(Colossal)

Level Adjustment: 

A coruscating being, shimmering with fire, electricity, water, and

whirling air moves toward you, devastating all in its path.

Omnimentals  are  the  descendants  of  magically  created

elemental beings. Though originally intended as liaisons

between  warring  elemental  armies  in  ancient  times,

omnimentals  instead  became  powerful  warriors.  Now

they roam the Elemental Planes with no regard for their

original purpose.

This combination of elements lacks several of the attack

forms of the speci c elementals, but also does not have many

of their limitations. For instance, unlike a  re elemental, an

omnimental  can  enter  water  and  non ammable  liquids;

when it does so, the water, air, and earth aspects of the crea-

ture form protective layers around its bodys  re aspect. An

omnimental is 48 feet in height and weighs 10 tons.

Omnimentals speak Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.

COMBAT

An impressive combatant in all kinds of terrain, an omni-

mental can devastate a battle eld. Its size and reach enable

it to attack many foes at a distance. Its elemental ball attack

grants the creature further options at long distances.

Death  Birth  (Su):  When  an  omnimental  reaches  0  hit

points, it bursts into its component elemental parts, creat-

ing four 16 HD Huge elementals, one each of air, earth,  re,

and water (see pages 96100 of the Monster Manual for statis-

tics). (Defeating these Huge elementals earns no additional

experience  points.  Their  XP  value  is  accounted  for  in  the

Challenge Rating of the omnimental.)

Elemental  Ball  (Ex):  As  a  standard  action,  an  omni-

mental can detach part of itself to create a clod of  aming

earth that it can  ing at an opponent up to 100 feet away.

Using  this  ability  reduces  the  omnimentals  current  hit

points by 10.

Skills: An omnimental has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted

or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,

provided it swims in a straight line.

OMNIMENTALS IN EBERRON

Although they have mastered the ability to bind elementals

inside magic items, the gnomes of Zilargo have been unable

to capture and bind a summoned omnimental. Some have

tried, but the results have been uniformly disastrous. It is

rumored that the drow of Xendrik may hold the secret to

omnimental binding, but attempts to duplicate their research

have likewise proven calamitous.

This creature looks like a bloated ovoid

supported  by  three  stocky  legs.  A

vinelike eyestalk rises about 2 feet

above  its  bloated  body,  and

four  thick  tentacles  extend

from  its  sides.  The  crea-

tures horrid mouth extends

around the entire front half of

its body and holds multiple rows

of  jagged  teeth.  The  creatures

rough hide twists and contorts

over  its  strange  form,  seem-

ingly  infused  with  a  horrid

energy of its own.

Like the more common otyugh, the

lifeleech  otyugh  is  a  grotesque

subterranean monster that lurks

within heaps of refuse. Warped

by  arcane  magic  to  thwart  the

healing power of divine spellcast-

ers, a lifeleech otyugh feeds on the

energy of nearby healing spells.

Like other otyughs, a lifeleech otyugh spends most of its

time within its lair. It keeps the lair  lled with refuse and

carrion, and it covers itself in this vile stuff.

Evil  divine  spellcasters  have  realized  that  lifeleech

otyughs can make ef cient and deadly companions. Such

evil clerics realize that even when they save their precious

healing magic for themselves, the lifeleech otyugh can still

gain the bene t of their healing. A typical lifeleech otyugh

is 8 feet in diameter and weighs 700 pounds.

Lifeleech otyughs speak Common.

COMBAT

Although less capable mentally than the average human,

lifeleech otyughs possess a cruel cunning that serves them

well in combat situations. Knowing that their ability to

absorb  healing  magic  takes  many  by  surprise,  lifeleech

otyughs often seek to wound divine spellcasters early in

an encounter.

Constrict (Ex): A lifeleech otyugh deals automatic ten-

tacle damage with a successful grapple check.

Spell-Strengthened Hide (Su): The sickly gray skin of

a lifeleech otyugh has been infused with magical energy.

This strange energy grants a lifeleech otyugh a +4 de ection

bonus to its Armor Class.

Lifeleech Aura (Su): Whenever a spell or spell-like abil-

ity with the healing descriptor is used on a creature within

60 feet of a lifeleech otyugh, the otyugh gains the bene t

of the healing spell as if it had been one of the spells

targets. If a healing spell cast within 60 feet of a life-

leech  otyugh  would  grant  it

enough  hit  points  to  exceed

its full normal total, it gains

the  remaining  hit  points

as  temporary  hit  points.  A

lifeleech  otyugh  cant  have

more temporary hit points from

its lifeleech aura than its full nor-

mal hit point total. Temporary hit

points  gained  in  this  manner  last

for 1 hour.

This  ability  affects  spell  com-

(such as scrolls, staffs, and wands),

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To

use  this  ability,  a  lifeleech  ot-

yugh must hit with its tentacle at-

tack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without pro-

voking attacks of opportunity.

Skills:  A  lifeleech  otyugh  has  a  +8

ways choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even

if rushed or threatened. *A lifeleech otyugh

gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when

LIFELEECH OTYUGHS IN EBERRON

Lifeleech otyughs are most commonly found in Droaam,

where the Daughters of Sora Kell and their humanoid min-

ions use them as guardians and mounts. The origins of the

lifeleech otyugh trace all the way back to the great Empire

of Dhakaan, and Dhakaani wizardry is widely accused of

creating these monstrosities.

While the actions of petals may be whimsical and inno-

lies  not  with  the  petals  themselves,  but  with  dangerous

creatures that might also inhabit the area. Predators and the

unscrupulous are quite happy to take advantage of opportu-

nities provided to them by the petals.

The skin color of a petal resembles the color of a  ower,

ranging from pale pastels to vibrant red or yellow. In place

of hair atop their heads, they have blossoms. These are often

of  a  different  shade  or  color  than  their  skin.  Often,  the

blossoms have different hues, sometimes with paler tips or

centers, even speckles or strips. Their wings are of the same

shades and patterns as their blossoms. A typical petal stands

While  nonfey  may  view  petals  as  mischievous  nui-

sances,  petals  know  that  theyre  only  doing  whats  right

and proper. Every traveler and adventurer needs the bene t

of a restful sleep. All should wake refreshed and surrounded

by beauty.

As their way of carrying out this philosophy, petals sing trav-

elers to sleep. They then remove their sleeping victims armor,

weapons, and equipment, piling it nearby. (Petals never steal

anything; to a petal, doing so would be a wrongful act.) Once

Petals like to use their sleep songs from a distance to put

travelers to sleep. They avoid close combat.

Sleep Songs (Su): Petals can sing two kinds of songs that

deal no damage but can lull a creature into a state of relax-

ation or sleep.

Lullaby: Any creature within a 20-foot-radius that fails a

DC 14 Will save is affected as though by a lullaby spell. A

creature  that  successfully  saves  cannot  be  affected  again

by that petals lullaby song for 24 hours. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Sleep: This song re-

quires two or more pet-

als separated by no more

than 100 feet to be sing-

ture  within  100  feet  of

either singer that hears

the  song  must  succeed

on  a  DC  14  Will  save

by  a  sleep  spell.  Addi-

tional  petals  within  100

feet of a target can lend

their voices to the song,

strengthening it and in-

creasing the save DC by

1 per additional singer.

A  creature  that  success-

fully  saves  cannot  be  affected  again  by  those  petals  sleep

song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

PETALS IN EBERRON

Petals inhabit the sylvan woodlands and  ower  elds of

Aundair. There, they go beyond their traditional roles of

their  pastoral  demesnes  against  encroaching  evil,  using

their sleep songs as offensive tools.

This tall, slender, human-sized creature bears a massive falchion

across its back. Although it looks mostly human, feathers of red

and gold line the backs of its arms, legs, and its jaw, and thicker

feathers grow in place of its hair. Its golden-hued skin seems to

radiate an inner heat and warmth, and its eyes glow.

Phoelarches are thought to be the descendants of the leg-

endary  phoenix.  Their  proud  bearing,  brilliant  plumage,

and  the  intense  heat  they  can  generate  all  prove  these

rumors are closer to the truth than many realize.

Phoelarches  vary  somewhat  in  plumage  and  skin  tone.

Some have skin the color of dark rust, while others have

skin that shows just a hint of gold. The feathers of these

creatures  serve  no  purpose  but  to  hint  at  their  ancestry

and give the phoelarches something to preen. They range

in color from pale gold to deep  ery red. Phoelarches stand

taller than humans, most reaching 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall. An

average phoelarch weighs around 180 pounds.

Phoelarches speak Ignan and a smattering of other lan-

guages  picked  up  in  their  wanderings  as  well  (Common,

Sylvan, Elven, Draconic, Celestial, and so forth).

Phoelarches do not con ne themselves to any one ter-

rain  or  climate.  They  prefer  warmer  areas,  but  they  can

tolerate almost any habitable clime. They are almost uni-

versally possessed of a terrible wanderlust, though. Most

phoelarches spend their lives wandering the land, seeking

out new places and new people. As a result, phoelarches

dont typically have their own society, although rumors of

phoelarch cities on the Elemental Plane of Fire circulate

among the phoenixkin.

Another trait phoelarches have in common is how they

respond to injustice. Phoelarches treasure their freedom,

and the freedom of others, almost more than anything else.

As  a  result,  wherever  a  peoples  freedom  is  threatened,  a

phoelarch may be drawn to the scene to help in the  ght for

justice or freedom.

COMBAT

A  phoelarch  is  a  deadly  combatant  at  a  distance  and  in

melee. In a  ght, it prefers to rely on its empowered scorching

ray and other spell-like abilities as long as possible, engaging

in melee with its falchion only if necessary. Charismatic and

engaging, a phoelarch is rarely encountered alone. One is

frequently accompanied by companions of similar interests,

or by loyal followers.

Death Throes (Su): When slain, a phoelarch explodes in

a blinding burst of  re that deals 10d6 points of  re damage

to anything within 20 feet (Re ex DC 15 half). The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Heat  (Ex):  A  phoelarch  generates  so  much  heat  that

merely touching it deals 1d6 points of  re damage to the

toucher. The phoelarchs metallic weapon also conducts this

heat. A phoelarch can suppress or resume this ability as a

free action.

Healing Fire (Su): Any  re attack that would normally

deal damage instead heals a phoelarch. Any  re effect tar-

geted  on  a  phoelarch  heals  1  point  of  damage  for  every  3

points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of

healing would cause the phoelarch to exceed its full normal

hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For

example, a phoelarch exposed to a  reball that deals 30 points

of damage would heal up to 10 points of damage, or provide

the phoelarch with up to 10 temporary hit points.

Immunities (Ex): A phoelarch is immune to disease

and poison.

Rise From the Ashes (Su): When a phoelarch is slain

(reduced to 10 hit points or below), its body is immolated,

leaving nothing but ash and a chrysalis form in the shape

of a small black glass egg roughly 6 inches across. The egg

remains dormant for 24 hours, after which time it hatches,

releasing a fully grown phoera (see below).

The ash and chrysalis left behind when a phoelarch dies

can  be  used  to  resurrect  the  phoelarch,  but  the  creature

cannot be raised by any means. Once a phoera has burst free

from its chrysalis, the phoelarch cannot be brought back to

life by any means. A gentle repose spell or similar magic cast

on a chrysalis can keep the egg from hatching, allowing the

phoelarch to possibly be brought back to life at a later time.

Once the gentle repose effect ends, however, the egg hatches

24 hours later.

A wish or miracle spell used in conjunction with a resurrec-

tion effect can restore a phoelarch to life after its chrysalis

has hatched.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willlight, scorching ray (DC 15);

CHRYSALIS

The most distinctive aspect of a phoelarch has nothing to

do with its life, but rather with its death. When a phoelarch

dies, it explodes in a massive burst of  ame. This burst leaves

behind a small black glass egg. The egg radiates faint trans-

mutation  magic  but  otherwise  has  no  magical  properties.

The black egg has hardness 5, 20 hit points, and immunity

to  re.

If the egg is undamaged, within 24 hours it hatches into

a new creature: the phoera, a beautiful bird that closely

resembles the phoenix of myth. While the phoera retains

many of the phoelarchs abilities, this beautiful, red-and-

gold-plumed bird has no memory of the phoelarchs life. It

is, in fact, an entirely new creature.

This  brilliantly  plumed  bird  has  feathers  of  red  and  gold.  In

contrast to its beauty, its wickedly hooked beak and talons look

capable of rending flesh from bone. A long tail of feathers streams

behind the creature as it flies, leaving a shimmering of heat in

the wake of its passage.

Once  hatched,  a  phoera  typically  finds  a  comfortable,

remote stretch of forest in which to nest. It preys on small

mammals,  and  tends  to  shy  away  from  larger  creatures.

Being very territorial, however, it attempts to frighten off

intruders in its claimed area of forest. If pushed, a jealous

phoera will not hesitate to set its forest home ablaze to keep

it from the hands of intruders.

These creatures do not willingly risk their lives. They

seem to have no knowledge of their power to rise from

the ashes.

A phoera measures 7 feet long from its beak to the tip of

its long tail. It weighs around 250 pounds.

COMBAT

PHOELARCH AND PHOERA VARIANTS

The  vazalkyon  and  the  vazalka  (described  below)  are  cold-

based variants of the phoelarch and phoera, respectively. Other

elemental variants may also exist.

VAZALKYON AND VAZALKA

Vazalkyons are cold-dwelling creatures similar in appearance to

phoelarches, except that they have pale blue skin, silvery-white

plumage, and a chilling aura. When a vazalkyon dies, it turns

into  a  pile  of  slushy  ice  and  leaves  behind  a  glassy  black  egg

thats cold to the touch (hardness 5, 20 hit points, immunity to

cold). After 24 hours, an undamaged vazalkyon egg hatches into

a vazalka, a cold-based variant of the phoera.

In the Eberron Campaign Setting, vazalkyons and vazalkas often

Chill (Ex): As the phoelarchs heat ability, except that it deals

cold damage.

Healing Cold (Su): As the phoelarchs healing fire ability, except

it applies only to cold attacks.

Vazalka: The vazalka does not possess the phoeras ignite

ability. A vazalkas statistics and abilities are otherwise similar

to the phoeras, except as noted below:

Cold Subtype: A vazalka has the cold subtype instead of the fire

subtype.

of fire damage) when it hits with a claw or bite attack.

Breath Weapon (Su): 30-foot line of cold, 3/day, damage 5d4

cold, Reflex DC 12 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Chill (Ex): As the phoeras heat ability, except that it deals cold

damage.

Healing Cold (Su): As the phoeras healing fire ability, except

it applies only to cold attacks.

Shivering Strike (Ex): A creature struck by a vazalkas bite or

claw attack must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be

shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

make their lairs near portals to Risia, the plane of ice.

Vazalkyon: A vazalkyon has statistics and abilities similar to

the phoelarch, except as noted here:

Cold Subtype: A vazalkyon has the cold subtype instead of the

fire subtype.

Damage: A vazalkyon deals 1d6 points of cold damage (instead

of fire damage) when it hits with a weapon.

Death Throes (Su): A slain vazalkyon deals cold damage instead

of fire damage when it explodes.

Heat  (Ex):  A  phoera  generates  so  much  heat  that

merely touching it deals 1d6 points of fire damage to the

toucher. A phoera can suppress or resume this ability as

a free action.

Ignite (Ex): A creature struck by a phoeras

bite or claw attacks must make a success-

ful DC 12 Re ex save or catch on

 re. The  ames burn for 1d4

rounds.  A  burning  crea-

ture can take a move action

to put out the  ames. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Healing  Fire  (Su):  Any

 re attack that would nor-

mally deal damage instead

heals a phoera. Any  re ef-

fect  targeted  on  a  phoera

heals 1 point of damage for

every  3  points  of  damage

it  would  otherwise  deal.

If  the  amount  of  healing

would cause the phoera

to  exceed  its  full  nor-

mal  hit  points,  it  gains

any  excess  as  temporary

hit points. For example, a

phoera exposed to a  reball

that  deals  30  points  of  dam-

age would heal up to 10 points of

damage, or provide the phoera with

up to 10 temporary hit points.

Rise From the Ashes (Su): When

a  phoera  is  slain  (reduced  to  10  hit

points or below), its body is immolated,

leaving  nothing  but  ash  and  a  chrysalis

form  in  the  shape  of  a  small  black  glass  egg

roughly  6  inches  across.  The  egg  remains  dormant  for  24

hours, after which time it hatches, releasing another fully

grown  phoera.  If  the  slain  phoera  had  advanced  to  4  Hit

Dice or more, the new one only has the Hit Dice (3) of an

unadvanced phoera.

The ash and chrysalis left behind when a phoera dies can

be used to resurrect the phoera, but the creature cannot be

raised by any means. Once a phoera has burst free from the

chrysalis,  the  previous  phoera  cannot  be  brought  back  to

life by any means. A gentle repose spell or similar magic cast

on a chrysalis can keep the egg from hatching, allowing the

phoera  to  possibly  be  brought  back  to  life  at  a  later  time.

Once the gentle repose effect ends, however, the egg hatches

24 hours later.

A wish or miracle spell used in conjunction with a resur-

rection effect can restore a phoera to life after its chrysalis

has hatched.

the freedom of others, almost more than

anything  else.  For  this  reason,  they  fre-

quently unite with bands of adventurers strongly

opposed to tyranny. The ancient past saw phoelarches help-

ing to free elf slaves from their giant overseers on Xendrik,

and in the present day phoelarches have been know to help

kalashtar  escape  the  tyranny  of  the  Inspired  and  assist

warforged who are struggling to gain recognition as an

independent race.

PHOELARCHES AND PHOERAS

IN FAERN

Whenever a peoples freedom is threatened, a phoelarch

may be drawn to the scene to help in the struggle for free-

dom and justice. Phoelarches staunchly oppose slavery in

Faern. Consequently, they are most active in places such

as Calimshan, Mulhorand, and other nations where slav-

ery is legal. They also form alliances with organizations

and bands of adventurers opposed to powerful tyrants or

slave rings.

Plague brush

An enormous ball of vines, easily the size of a building, tumbles

toward you.

These  monstrous,  tumbleweedlike  plant  creatures  roll

along the vast scarlet plains of Cathrys, the second layer

of Carceri. A plague brush is often 35 feet wide and can

weigh as much as 40 tons.

COMBAT

A  plague  brush  has  only  one instinct: roll over things to

 atten  and  kill  them.  The  creature  is  not  precise  about

accomplishing  this  goal,  though.  Once  it  rolls  over  an

obstacle, it often ignores it thereafter. Its not unusual for

a plague brush to tumble through a camp or a community

and simply keep on rolling by.

Greensickness  (Su):  A  plague  brush  is  continually

surrounded by a cloud of spores in a 30-foot radius. The

spores act as an inhaled poison (Fort DC 33); initial and

secondary damage 2d6 Str and 1d4 Con. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Scoop  (Ex):  Any  creature  successfully  trampled  by  a

plague brush might be picked up and carried off with it. The

plague brush can immediately attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it picks up the victim and carries it

as the plague brush moves.

In this manner, a plague brush can scoop up to 2 Huge,

8  Large,  32  Medium,  128  Small,  or  512  Tiny  or  smaller

creatures.

A  creature  scooped  up  by  a  plague  brush  is  considered

grappled.

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  DC  37  half.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Airy (Ex): Since a plague brush is constantly turning

over and its anatomy is made up of a (relatively) small

amount of plant matter and lots of empty space, it is dif-

 cult to know where to attack the creature. Any melee

or  ranged  attack  with  a  piercing  weapon  directed  at  a

plague brush has a 20% miss chance. The blow or missile

may pass through the creatures body without harming

it.  Even  a  true  seeing  effect  is  useless  for  determining

where and how to strike the creature.

PLAGUE BRUSHES IN EBERRON

In Eberron, the plague brush is not an extraplanar plant

(and it loses the extraplanar subtype). Instead, it poses a

danger  to  those  brave,  foolish,  or  desperate  enough

to  venture  into  the  Mournland.  Created  to  weak-

en  troops  by  means  of  their  greensickness  poison,

plague  brushes  served  as  advance  units  in  the  Last

War; now they randomly wander the stricken land.

PLAGUE BRUSHES IN FAERN

In  the  FORGOTTEN  R EALMS  campaign  setting,  plague

brushes sweep across the Barrens of Doom and Despair.

It is rarebut not unheard offor these creatures to  nd

their way onto other planes.

Myriad lumps move just under the skin of this huge, gruesome,

humanoid-shaped creature. Its bloodless complexion resembles

a corpse.

These mindless undead creatures lumber about, seeking

to kill any living creature except for rats and vermin.

If one finds its way into civilization it, and the rat

swarms it brings, can deplete the population of

a town.

A plague spewers greatest threat is the devastat-

ing disease it carries. Unlike many such ailments,

this one spreads merely from contact. Thus, those

seeking to help the afflicted often become victims

themselves. Plague spewers stand 22 feet tall and weigh

10 tons.

COMBAT

Plague  spewers  hate  almost  all  living  creatures  and

will  launch  themselves  into  combat,  relentlessly

attacking the nearest foe. Plague spewers attack with-

out  cunning  or  guile.  They  seek  to  slam  and  bash

living  creatures.  Periodically,  and  whenever  they

cannot easily reach a foe, they vomit forth swarms

of rats.

Plague  (Su):  Supernatural  diseaseslam,  For-

titude DC 21, incubation period 1 minute; damage

2d4  Dex  and  2d4  Con.  The  save  DC  is  Charisma-

based.

The disease is spread by contact and does not require

injury.

Unlike  normal  diseases,  plague  continues  until  the

victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or until a remove

disease spell or similar magic (see Disease, page 304 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide) is applied.

An af icted creature of Huge size or larger who dies of the

plague rises as a plague spewer in 1d4 days.

Vomit Rat Swarm (Su): As a full-round action, a plague

spewer can spew forth a rat swarm (see Monster Manual page

239). It can do this up to four times per day.

PLAGUE SPEWERS IN EBERRON

At least one plague spewer haunts the dungeons below

Sharn, and others are known to inhabit the Mournland

as well as some of the ancient Dhakaani ruins that dot

the  landscape  of  Khorvaire.  However,  plague  spewers

are  most  commonly  encountered  on  Xendrik,  where

they  are  rumored  to  be  the  undead  remains  of  giants

whom the great dragons of Argonnessen cursed with a

foul plague.

PLAGUE SPEWERS IN FAERN

Plague  spewers  have  infested  cities  such  as  Westgate,

Marsember,  and  Urmlaspyr  with  their  rat  swarms.  The

fact that almost all plague spewers have been encountered

along the Dragon Coast has fueled rumors of a plague cult.

Although  adventurers  in  Westgate  and  Urmlaspyr  have

helped local constabularies deal with the unprecedented

rat populations in those cities by  nding and destroying

the plague spewers responsible, attempts to locate a plague

spewer  beneath  the  streets  of  Marsember  have

thus far failed.

PROTEAN SCOURGE

This creature stands 7 feet tall, with red, pebbled skin, and two

massive horns sprouting nearly straight up from its forehead.

Its angular features look vaguely demonic, and its many sharp,

pointed teeth only add to that impression. Its legs are almost

unnaturally long, well over half its body length, and its long arms

display four fingers with wickedly curved, 8-inch-long claws.

Cases  of  mistaken  identity  are  common  with  protean

scourges,  which  just  adds  to  their  reputation  as  deadly

assassins.  With  their  crimson  skin  and  long,  demonic

horns, protean scourges are often mistaken for  ends from

the  Abyss.  Still  other  protean  scourges   nd  themselves

mistaken for doppelgangers because of their innate shape-

shifting ability. A protean scourge uses its shapechanging

and potent magical abilities to great effectiveness. Protean

scourges  are  naturally  deceptive  and  have  keen  powers

of observation.

Protean  scourges  have  red,  pebbled  skin  in  their  natu-

ral  form  that  looks  scaly  from  a  distance.  Their  yellow

eyes add to the overall demonic look, as

do  the  two  thick,  foot-and-a-half-

long horns that grow from

their  foreheads,  curv-

ing  only  slightly  to

razor-sharp  points.  A

protean  scourges  legs

are abnormally long for its size, giving it a bet-

ter than average land speed. Its clawed hands are

lethal in their own right, but most protean scourges

also carry a scythe that they wield in

deadly fashion, mostly to add to the

myth that the creature is some sort of

evil outsider.

Protean  scourges  love  to  kill.  Most   nd

that  their  natural  abilities  make  them

highly effective assassins, able to get

close to a target without its knowl-

edge,  then  strike  when  the  mo-

ment  is  most  opportune.  Other

protean scourges  nd service in the forces

of  evil  warlords,  who  use  them  as  spies.

Still other protean scourges  nd work in

thieves guilds, usually as leaders. As long

as it has an opportunity to shed blood, a

protean scourge can be content.

A protean scourge is roughly 7 feet tall

and weighs about 200 pounds.

Protean scourges speak Common, Infernal, and Abyssal.

capabilities of a normal protean scourge. Many an unknow-

ing  foe  has  seen  a  protean  scourge  use  this  ability  and

assumed it to be some other illusion, only to learn too late

how real the double really is.

Spells: Protean scourges cast spells as 8th-level sorcerers.

They generally favor illusion and transmutation magic over

other schools.

Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/7/7/6/4): 0acid splash

(+16  ranged  touch),  dancing  lights,  daze  (DC  14),  detect

magic,  ghost  sound  (DC  14),  mage  hand,  open/close,  pres-

tidigitation;  1stcharm  person  (DC  15),  color  spray  (DC

15),  mage  armor,  ray  of  enfeeblement  (+16  ranged  touch),

ventriloquism  (DC  15);  2ndmirror  image,  scorching  ray

(+16 ranged touch), spider climb; 3rddisplacement, haste;

4thgreater invisibility.

Split (Su): When damaged, a protean scourge splits into

two  identical  versions  of  itself.  This  ability  is  not  an  illu-

sion; each new protean scourge is fully capable of dealing

real  damage  and  poses  a  real  threat.  Each  version  of  the

protean scourge has all the current statistics and access to

all the current abilities of a single creature, including any

remaining uncast spells. However, any spells cast by either

split protean scourge come from the total pool of remaining

available spells. So, the two versions share access to remain-

ing spells; each does not get its own spell list or spells per

day. Neither half of the protean scourge can change shape

as long as the creature remains split.

Each  version  has  the  protean  scourges  cur-

rent hit point total (they do not split remaining

hit  points),  and  both  versions  of  the  protean

scourge must be slain to kill the creature.

The split protean scourges can recombine

into a single creature in a process that takes

1 minute. While it recombines, the protean

scourge is helpless.

Change  Shape  (Su):  A  protean

scourge  can  assume  the  shape  of  any

Medium human oid. In humanoid form,

a protean scourge loses its natural at-

tacks. A protean scourge can remain

in its humanoid form until it choos-

es to assume a new one. A change

in form cannot be dispelled, but

a  protean  scourge  reverts  to  its

natural form when killed. A true

seeing  spell  or  ability  reveals  its

natural form.

COMBAT

A protean scourge strikes from the shadows, using its magic

to lead its opponents into traps or separate them into easily

slaughtered smaller groups. Once it is ready to strike, a pro-

tean scourge uses its claws or its scythe and horns to gouge

a foe. A protean scourges deadliest surprise only becomes

apparent  when  it  has  been  damaged  in  battle:  It  splits

into two protean scourges, each one with the strength and

QUARAPHON

This unusual brute has a squat, centaurlike form, with deep azure

skin. Its elongated head has two mouths stacked upon each other

and four menacing eyes.

Quaraphons  are  belligerent,  swaggering  creatures  that

wander the open plains looking to hone their  ghting prow-

ess on anything that seems to be a challenge. Quaraphons

spend  most  of  their  time  wandering  in  nomadic  groups,

hunting herds of large, dangerous animals such as bison and

elephants. Because the creatures require a huge amount of

food, the range of a quaraphon herd can be enormous and

often  infringes  on  the  territory  of  other  plains-dwelling

races. Most times, these territorial intrusions turn violent,

although occasionally the members of a herd will temper

their brawling nature to trade with others.

While rather dim, quaraphons love weapons and armor of

all kinds and will attack anyone that enters their territory

bearing such items.

A  quaraphon  stands  9  to  10  feet  tall  and  weighs  650  to

750 pounds. Its skin is deep azure blue and is covered with

warty knots. The head of a quaraphon is unusually large, and

includes two mouths, one on top of the other, and four eyes.

The placement of the eyes varies with each quaraphonsome

arrangements  are  uniformly  even  and  horizontal,  while

other quaraphons look as though their eyes were randomly

placed  on  their  faces.  Despite  this  strange  physiological

feature, quaraphons are alert and do not seem hindered by

the odd placement of their eyes.

Quaraphons speak Giant.

COMBAT

A quaraphon is an unsubtle combatant that relies on its

brute  strength  to  discourage  any  serious

resistance.  It   rst  lets  loose  a  deafen-

ing  bellow  before  charging  in  on

its victim.

A  quaraphon  normally  attacks

using its Power Attack feat, tak-

ing  a  3  penalty  on  its  attack

rolls  and  gaining  a  +3  bonus  on

damage rolls.

Deafening Bellow (Su): Once

per day, a quaraphon can let loose

a cacophony of noise from its two

mouths.  Any  creature  within  60

feet of the quaraphon takes 2d6

points  of  sonic  damage  and

must  make  a  DC  20  Forti-

tude save or be deafened for

1d6 rounds. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

QUARAPHON BULLY

Quaraphons commonly be-

come barbarians, marrying

Rage (Ex): Twice per day, this quaraphon barbarian can

enter a state of  erce rage that lasts 13 rounds. The following

changes are in effect as long as he rages: AC 21 (touch 8,  at-

footed 20); hp increase by 28; Atk +17 melee (2d8+20/1920,

+1 greatclub) or +16 melee (1d8+12, bite); Full Atk +17/+12/+7

bite) and +11/+11 melee (1d6+7, 2 hooves); SV Fort +17, Will

+6;  Str  28,  Con  31.  At  the  end  of  his  rage,  the  quaraphon

barbarian is fatigued for the remainder of the encounter.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): This quaraphon bar-

barian cannot be  anked; he retains his Dexterity bonus to

AC regardless of being caught  at-footed or attacked by an

invisible opponent. This defense is denied to the creature if

it is attacked by a rogue of 8th level or higher.

Trap Sense (Ex): This quaraphon barbarian has a +1 bonus

on Re ex saves made to avoid traps. He also has a +1 bonus

to his AC against attacks by traps.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): This quaraphon barbarian gains

the ability to react to danger before his senses would nor-

mally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus

to AC (if any) even if he is caught  at-footed or struck by

an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity

bonus to AC if immobilized.

QUARAPHON SOCIETY

Quaraphons live in nomadic herds that roam the open plains

and hilly expanses. Most herds have between 30 and 100 indi-

viduals, with at least half being females and children. Although

omnivorous, quaraphons prefer meat, and the males spend

most of their time tracking large game, while females graze for

nuts, berries, and tubers to supplement their diet. Constantly

on the move, quaraphons travel light and prefer not to burden

themselves with large amounts of material goods.

The leader of a quaraphon herd is known as the bullmas-

ter  and  is  always  the  largest  and  strongest  mem-

ber. The bullmaster spends most of his time

watching out for younger quaraphons that

vie for his lofty position. The bellows of

dueling  quaraphons  can  be  heard  for

miles around, lending a chilling qual-

ity  to  the  desolate  plains.  However,

while males are de nitely in charge

of the tribes, elder females also have

a serious say in mattersa bull-

master  would  be  foolhardy  to

make  decisions  without   rst

consulting the eldest female of

the tribe. Females are also the

most  likely  to  become  spell-

casters,  particularly  druids

and clerics. Quaraphons have

a deep distrust of arcane magic,

and  ascribe  all  manner  of  su-

perstitious  belief  to  its  prac-

tice. For this reason, no sane

quaraphon willingly associates with

Once every ten years, all the quaraphon herds converge at a

prescribed location, following an ancient migratory path. This

gathering, called a herdmeet, is an enormous, raucous affair

where trade is conducted, hotheaded males compete in boister-

ous games, and young females are traded between herds to build

alliances and reaf rm friendships. Other creatures are strictly

forbidden from attending herdmeets, and any that are caught

will be used as live game in the next round of hunting.

RAGE DRAKE

This heavily muscled reptile stalks about on four limbs, its fluid

movements and feline grace belying its size. Its dark red scales are

scarred and chipped from past struggles, and its scowling visage

hints at unchecked rage.

Primitive  draconic  creatures,

rage drakes have more in com-

mon with large and dangerous

dire  animals  than  with  true

dragons. Although capable of

at  least  rudimentary  reason-

ing,  rage  drakes  remain  ani-

malistic in many ways. Cruel

and  sel sh,  rage  drakes  em-

body  many  of  the  worst  quali-

ties  of  evil  dragonkind.  Some

sages  believe  that  rage  drakes

were created deliberately in an

attempt  to   nd  a  mount  with

the  fearsome  physical  abili-

ties of a dragon but without

the  intelligence  and  pow-

erful  magical  abilities.  Rage

drakes  do  not  hoard  treasure,

though they do value precious

gems . . . as snacks.

Rage  drakes  have  dull,  deep

red scales and the feline build com-

mon to true dragons. Unlike many other dra-

conic creatures, they do not have wings. However,

their size and strength make them extremely fast

compared  to  most  ground  creatures.  A  typical

rage drake can grow to be over 12 feet long and can weigh

up to 6,000 pounds.

Rage drakes do not speak, but they understand Common

and Draconic within the limits of their intelligence.

COMBAT

Brutal, instinctive hunters, rage drakes hide and ambush

their foes when possible. Beyond this instinctive hunting

technique, rage drakes take a simple approach to the many

battles they  ght in their violent lives. When combat begins,

a rage drake charges and pounces on the nearest foe, tearing

its opponent to shreds as fast as it can and then moving on

to the next foe. It usually tries to pounce and stun its foe

in the  rst round of combat and then begins raging in the

next round. If overmatched in combat, a rage drake is just as

likely to  ght to the death as it is to  ee.

A rage drake normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus

on damage rolls.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a rage drake

must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start

a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks  of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can use both its rake and worry attacks against

the held foe.

130

Pounce (Ex): If a rage drake charges, it can make a full

attack, including its two rake attacks and one worry attack

if it grabs its foe.

Rage (Ex): Four times per day, a rage drake can enter

a  state  of   erce  rage  that  lasts  11  rounds.  The  following

changes  are  in  effect  as  long  as  he

rages: AC 18 (touch 10,  at-footed 15);

hp increase by 28; Atk +18 melee

(1d8+15/1920,  claw);  Full  Atk

+18  melee  (1d8+15/1920,  2

claws)  and  +13  melee  (2d6+10,

bite); SV Fort +17, Will +12; Str

31, Con 27; Jump +33. Unlike

a barbarian, however, a rage

drake  is  not  fatigued  after

raging.  A  rage  drake  can  end

its rage early, though it seldom

does  so  even  when  all  its  foes

are apparently defeated.

Rake  (Ex):  Attack  bonus

+16 melee, damage 1d8+13, in-

cluding  adjustment  for  using

Power Attack feat.

Worry  (Ex):  Whenever  a

rage  drake  grabs  a  foe  at  least

one  size  category  smaller  than

itself in its mouth, it instinctively

shakes the foe, stunning and disori-

enting  its  victim.  Anyone  grabbed

by a rage drake must succeed on a DC

25 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1

round. A rage drake can only use this ability in

the first round after it grabs a foe. The save DC is

Strength-based.

Skills: Rage drakes have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks

and Listen checks.

FIENDISH RAGE DRAKE

Demon princes often breed powerful  endish versions of

rage drakes to use in their Abyssal armies. These ferocious

monsters  are  even  more  terrifying  than  their  ordinary

cousins, combining draconic fury with demonic toughness

and vigor.

Combat

A  fiendish  rage  drake  normally  attacks  using  its  Power

Attack feat, taking a 9 penalty on its attack rolls and gain-

ing a +9 bonus on damage rolls.

Rage (Ex): Four times per day, a  endish rage drake can

enter a state of  erce rage that lasts 12 rounds. The following

changes are in effect as long as he rages: AC 18 (touch 10,

 at-footed 15); hp increase by 42; Atk +22 melee (1d8+20/

1920,  claw);  Full  Atk  +22  melee  (1d8+20/1920,  2  claws)

and +14 melee (2d6+15, bite); SV Fort +21, Will +14; Str 32,

Con 28.; Jump +38. Unlike a barbarian, however, a  endish

rage drake is not fatigued after raging. A rage drake can end

its rage early, though it seldom does so even when all its foes

are apparently defeated.

RAGE DRAKE MOUNTS

Although  they  are  too  intelligent  to  be  trained  with  the

Handle Animal skill, rage drakes can occasionally be bribed

or  bullied  into  serving  as  mounts  for  extremely  powerful

riders. Riding a rage drake, even a thoroughly cowed one,

is always risky, and the rider must be prepared to deal with

the rage drakes attempt to assert control or turn on its rider.

Controlling a mount is especially dif cult when the crea-

ture enters a rageall Ride checks during such a time have

their DCs increased by 10.

A rage drake willing to serve as a mount and trained for

battle costs at least 15,000 gp. Frequent rewards of food,

drink, and precious gems can keep a rage drake happy and

reasonably loyal. In general, a rage drake rider should expect

to spend between 500 and 1,500 gp per month on the crea-

ture if he wants to keep the beast content (or as content as a

rage drake ever is).

RAGE DRAKES IN EBERRON

Rage drakes are found in large numbers on the continent

of Argonnessen, lairing in caves carved into perilous cliffs

near coastal waters. They are also found in alarming num-

bers on mainland Khorvaire, battling wyverns for territory.

Longships of the Lhazaar Principalities often have  gure-

heads  carved  to  resemble  rage  drakes,  and  the  creatures

are hunted, respected, and feared up and down Khorvaires

eastern coastline. The barbarian tribes of Argonnessen use

rage drakes as mounts.

RAGE DRAKES IN FAERN

Rage  drakes  populate  various  mountain  ranges  in  the

Unapproachable East, most notably the Giantspire Moun-

tains  in  Narfell  and  the  Dragonjaw  Mountains  in  Thesk

and Aglarond. Enslaved rage drakes also serve various Red

Wizards  of  Thay.  They  have  been  encountered  in  large

numbers as far south as the Toadsquat Mountains of the

Eastern Shaar. Shiertalaran traders have also reported rage

drakes in the Wyrmbones that prey on caravans approach-

ing the city of Kormul as well as on boats heading up and

down the Talar River.

This tall creature looks at once slender and deadly. Its generally

humanoid  body  has  thin  legs  and  arms,  and  its  features  are

concealed  by  tight-fitting  metal  armor.  The  creatures  move-

ments are graceful and sure, yet they are sharp and angry at

the same time. Swords, axes, and other bladed weapons spin

around the creature in a tight cloud. These weapons look sharp

and deadly, but none comes close enough to the creature that

it risks striking itself.

Ragewalkers embody the natural forces of war and combat

in  the  same  way  that  a  nymph  embodies  the  beauty  of

nature  or  a  dryad  embodies  the  heart  of  its  tree.  These

deadly fey emerge from a landscape torn and twisted by

war, and they are natures response to the ravages of such

battles. The ragewalker, also known as the war torn fey,

exists to perpetuate combat, turning men and beast alike

against one another. Insane by the standards of any but

the uncaring forces of nature, ragewalkers seek the anni-

hilation of all war through the annihilation of all who are

capable of making war.

As  spirits  of  a  war-torn  land,  ragewalkers  sometimes

emerge from the sites of great battles. Ragewalkers seem

somehow related to living spells or to their creation, and

they have an innate ability to control and command such

creatures.  A  ragewalker  is  often  encountered  with  one

or more living spells bound to it as guardians, although

such  relationships  seem  to  be  based  more  on  instinct

than on reason.

Ragewalkers have light gray skin, a generally humanoid

build, and fair, el ike features. Few ever see their faces, dis-

torted by bloodlust, since they are covered from head to foot

in tight- tting metal armor. The most unusual feature of a

ragewalker is the cloud of weapons that spins around it in a

tight orbit. Any who come close to the creature risk injury

from these  ying weapons. A ragewalker stands 15 feet tall

and weighs 500 pounds.

Ragewalkers  speak  Common,  Abyssal,  Infernal,  and

Sylvan.

COMBAT

Ragewalkers embody ferocious combat, yet they prefer to

bring  about  such  con ict  in  others  rather  than  directly

engage  in  melee.  A  ragewalker  uses  its  powerful  super-

natural  abilities  to  turn  its  foes  against  one  another.  It

then uses its spell-like abilities to divide the battle eld to

its liking, isolating small groups of foes and then moving

in to destroy them.

Control Living Spells (Su): A ragewalker rebukes and

commands living spells in the same way that evil clerics

rebuke and control undead. A ragewalker can use this abil-

ity a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma bonus

(ten times per day for a typical ragewalker). A ragewalker

rebukes and commands living spells as a cleric with a level

equal to one-half its Hit Dice.

Grafted  Armor  (Ex):  A  ragewalker  wears  armor  it

has  scavenged  from  countless  battlefields.  This  armor

provides signi cant protection in combat, but it imposes

no maximum Dexterity bonus, no armor check penalty,

no movement penalty, and no arcane spell failure chance.

Other  creatures,  even  other  ragewalkers,  cannot  wear  a

ragewalkers armor.

Induce Blood Frenzy (Su): Any creature coming within

10 feet of a ragewalker must make a DC 28 Will save or  y

into a mindless killing frenzy. Any creature that fails its

saving  throw  gains  a  +2  bonus  to  Strength  and  takes  a

2  penalty  to  AC.  Affected  creatures  become  unable  to

distinguish friend from foe and must make a melee attack

against the nearest creature each round (using a full attack

if possible, or charging if appropriate). An affected creature

is  incoherent  and  cannot  talk,  cast  spells,  or  otherwise

communicate for the duration of the effect. It remains in a

frenzy for a number of rounds equal to 10 minus its Wisdom

bonus (minimum 1 round), even if the ragewalker is dead or

no longer present.

This is a mind-affecting ability. The save DC is Charisma-

based.

Repel Missiles (Su): Any time a thrown or projectile

weapon is used against a ragewalker, the weapon instead

turns  and  could  strike  the  wielder.  The  attacker  com-

pares his attack roll against his own Armor Class, figur-

ing the attacks success and damage as if he had attacked

himself.

Ranged weapons with epic enhancement bonuses are not

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayblade barrier (DC 23), bulls

strength, greater magic weapon, wall of  re. Caster level 20th.

Note  that  the  feats  Quicken  Spell-Like  Ability  and

Empower  Spell-Like  Ability  affect  all  of  the  ragewalkers

daily uses of blade barrier and wall of  re.

Weapon Cloud (Su): Ragewalkers are surrounded at all

times  by  a  cloud  of   ying,  whirling  weapons.  This  cloud

deals 2d6 points of slashing damage each round to any crea-

ture adjacent to the ragewalker. Damage reduction applies

to this damage.

TACTICS

ROUND-BY-ROUND

A  ragewalker  is  most  effective  when  it

can  induce  a  blood  frenzy  in  its  foes,

turning  them  against  one  another.

The  ragewalker  must  close  to

within 10 feet of its foes at the

beginning  of  combat  to  in-

duce a blood frenzy in them.

Once those foes have turned

on each other, the ragewalk-

er  carefully  divides  the

battlefield  with  blade  bar-

riers and walls of fire. When

its  spell-like  and  supernatu-

ral  abilities  have  done  their

work,  it  can  close  with  its

foes  one  at  a  time  and  rip

them apart, enhancing its

combat ability with bulls

strength when possible.

Prior  to  Combat:  Scout

the  area  to  pick  ideal

spots  to  divide  foes  into

smaller  groups  with  blade

barrier  and  wall  of

fire.

Just  before  the  fight,  cast

bulls  strength  (adding  +3  to

spiked  chain  damage  rolls

and  +2  to  Jump  checks).  A  ragewalker  always

has  greater  magic  weapon  active  (included  in

statistics above).

Round  1:  Move  near  the  foes  most  likely  to  have  poor

Will saves (heavily armored warrior-types), forcing them

to  deal  with  the  ragewalkers  ability  to  induce  a  blood

frenzy. Use a quickened and empowered wall of  re to split

a group of foes into smaller groups. Try to divide them

in such a way that some of those who have succumbed

to  the  blood  frenzy  are  in  each  of  the  newly  formed

smaller groups. Use a second move action to back away

from the conflict.

Round 2: Repeat round 1s tactic.

Round 3: If some foes have not yet been exposed to the

blood frenzy, move near them and repeat round 1s tactic.

If all foes have been exposed, use either blade barrier or wall

of  re (quickened and empowered in either case) to isolate

one unaffected foe and move so that the unaffected foe is

attacked by the weapon cloud.

Round 4: If foes are unable to attack

as  a  group,  pick  them  off  one  at  a  time

with melee attacks. If they are still able

to mount a coordinated attack, use

quickened  and  empowered  blade

barriers and walls of fire to cover

a retreat.

RAGEWALKERS

IN EBERRON

Ragewalkers  are  drawn  to

the  Mournland  because  of

the spectacular battles waged

there during the Last War, but

they are also found near ancient

battle  sites  that  time  and  na-

ture  have  all  but  hidden

from  the  world.  They  also

lurk  in  the  ruins  of  cas-

tles  and  fortresses  aban-

doned  after  the  fall  of  the

Dhakaani Empire.

RAGEWALKERS

IN FAERN

If ragewalkers exist on Faern,

they  are  typically  found

wherever  living  spells  have

formed  (see  the  living  spell

entry on page 91). They might inhabit ancient Neth-

erese ruins, regions where the millennia-old Orc-

gate Wars and Crown Wars once raged, and sites of more

recent  battles  (see  Chapter  6:  History  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting for suggestions).

A RAGEWALKERS TROUPE

Ragewalkers are often accompanied by one to three living spells.

The DM can choose these from those available in his game or

roll randomly once, twice, or three times on the table below.

A tall, emaciated figure with the head

of a white tiger glares at you. Its body

is cloaked in fine robes, and its clawed

hands  seem  ready  to  dip  into  the

numerous spell component pouches

at its waist at a moments notice.

Akchazar  rakshasas  wander  the

planes  seeking  new  lands  to  sub-

jugate and new undead minions to

enslave.  These  rakshasas  are  mas-

ters of necromantic magic, although they

are  powerful  in  the  other  schools  of  magic  as

well. Akchazar rakshasas typically work behind the scenes,

manipulating events to suit their dark whims and relying on

their web of spies, assassins, and intelligent undead to carry

out their nefarious plots.

Akchazar rakshasa

An  akchazar  rakshasa  looks  like  a  humanoid  with  the

head of a white tiger. A light coating of ghostly white fur

coats the creatures body from the shoulders down, and its

hands display razor-sharp nails, like a cats claws. The palms

of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a

human. An akchazar rakshasa stands around 6 feet tall and

weighs about 175 pounds.

Akchazar  rakshasas  do  associate  with  other  rakshasas,

often as leaders or manipulators. Other types of rakshasas

value an akchazars intelligence even as they fear its abili-

ties. It is not uncommon for weaker rakshasas to follow the

complex plans of an akchazar even as they go about their

own missions. All rakshasas tend toward solitary existences,

but communication and coordination between the various

kinds is not unheard of.

An  akchazar  rakshasa  typically  establishes  a  power

base at the site of a great battle, a large cemetery, or some

other  place  where  a  large  number  of  corpses  might  be

interred. It uses its power over undead to create several

intelligent  undead  minions.  Thereafter,  it  might  make

contact  with  a  local  underworld  organization  (almost

always  through  intermediaries)  or  even  a  corrupt  or

power-hungry  political  official.  It  will  play  with  these

leaders,  offering  them  advice,  power,  or

riches as it learns their habits and defin-

ing  characteristics.  Then  the  akchazar

uses  its  magic  jar  spell-like  ability  to

replace one of these leaders for a time,

using the borrowed body to solidify

its hold on the region.

Akchazar  rakshasas  speak  Com-

mon, Infernal, and Undercommon.

COMBAT

In  battle,  an  akchazar  rakshasa  avoids

a  close-quarters  combat  situation  when-

ever  it  can.  Pragmatic  and  cautious,

it feels no need to personally deliver

a  death  blow,  relying  on  minions

or  their  spells  to  carry  out  such

tasks. These rakshasas take care to

learn their enemies strengths and

weaknesses,  and  they  use  their

magic accordingly.

Change  Shape  (Su):  An

akchazar  rakshasa  can  assume

any  humanoid  form,  or  revert

to  its  own  form,  as  a  standard

action.  In  humanoid  form,  an

akchazar rakshasa loses its claw

and  bite  attacks  (although

it  often  equips  itself  with

weapons and armor instead).

An  akchazar  rakshasa  typically  remains  in  one

form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in

form cannot be dispelled, but an akchazar rakshasa reverts

to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals its

natural form.

Pain Wave (Su): Three times per day for 1 round per Hit

Dice,  an  akchazar  rakshasa  can  emit  an  aura  of  negative

energy as a free action. Every creature within 20 feet of an

akchazar  rakshasa  when  it  activates  the  ability  is  subject

to  an  in ict  moderate  wounds  spell  (caster  level  20th)  and

becomes shaken for 1d6+1 rounds. Creatures within the area

can make a DC 24 Will save for half damage (and to ignore

the shaken effect). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Rebuke Undead (Su): An akchazar rakshasa can rebuke

and  command  undead  as  a  20th-level  cleric.  An  akchazar

rakshasa can make up to nine rebuke attempts per day.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayanimate dead; 2/daycontrol

undead  (DC  23),  create  undead;  1/daycreate  greater  undead,

magic jar (DC 21), trap the soul (DC 24). Caster level 20th.

Spells: An akchazar rakshasa casts spells as a 12th-level

sorcerer.  It  favors  spells  of  the  necromancy  and  enchant-

ment schools.

Typical  Sorcerer  Spells  Known  (6/8/8/7/7/6/4):  0daze

Skills:  Akchazar  rakshasas  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

An akchazar rakshasa rarely travels alone. It is usually accom-

panied  by  various  undead  created  by  animate  dead,  create

undead, and create greater undead (see sidebar). An akchazar

rakshasa is a wise deceiver, so it should know a great deal

about its opponents before a battle begins. The creature uses

its rebuke undead ability to keep its nonintelligent servants

under control, and often strikes bargains with the intelligent

undead it creates to serve the rakshasa in return for power or

other, less savory considerations.

Once  combat  is  joined,  an  akchazar  rakshasa  lets  its

undead minions do the dirty work of melee  ghting while

it  focuses  on  dealing  with  any  ranged  attackers.  It  often

attacks from hiding, and when its hiding place is discovered,

it usually takes the time to  nd a new hiding spot before

resuming  its  attack.  In  battle,  its  spells  are  an  akchazar

rakshasas best weapons, and the creature is well aware of its

limitations in melee.

An akchazar rakshasa is always careful to keep a teleport

spell (technically, the 5th-level spell slot needed to cast the

spell) in reserve in case a quick getaway is necessary.

Prior to combat: Mage armor; mirror image.

Round 1: Trap the soul on an opponent that it believes to

have a low Will save.

Round 2: Disintegrate spellcasting foe, or dominate person

on another low Will save target, directing that individual to

attack any of its companions.

Round  3:  Use  offensive  spell;  focus  on  keeping  at  least

some bodies intact for later experiments or the creation of

new undead.

Round 4: Repeat offensive spells, or use magic jar on target

with low Will save. When using magic jar in combat in this

way, an akchazar rakshasa often issues a standing order for

one of its undead lieutenants to destroy the gem holding the

opponents soul as soon as the spell is successful.

Round 5: Continue with offensive spells, either using ener-

vation to eliminate opponents high-level spells, or readying

magic missile attacks to disrupt enemy spellcasting.

AKCHAZAR

RAKSHASAS IN EBERRON

Many  of  the  Lords  of  Dust  are  actually  akchazar  raksha-

sas.  They  sequester  themselves  in  foreboding  strongholds

beneath the Demon Wastes, although some have made lairs

closer to the heart of civilization on Khorvaire. At least one

akchazar rakshasa operates from within the Great Crag in

central Droaam, lending his services and undead minions

to the Daughters of Sora Kell in exchange for special favors

too terrible to ponder.

AKCHAZAR RAKSHASAS IN FAERN

Akchazar rakshasas often make their lairs in places where

wars, famines, and plagues grant access to plenty of corpses

for their necromantic experiments. Most keep a low pro-

 le; however, a pair of akchazar rakshasas is believed to

operate  in  the  city  of  Unthalass,  currently  occupied  by

the Mulhorandi army. They also have operatives stirring

up unrest in the Chessentan cities of Cimbar, Luthcheq,

and Soorenar.

This  being  is  garbed  in  dark

clothing.  Its  body  seems

mostly  human  except  for  a

luxurious  coat  of  black  fur

and its black, tigerlike head.

While  some  theorize

that  rakshasas  are  the

very  embodiment  of

evil, those rare few who

have  survived  an  en-

counter with the deadly

naztharune  know  it  as

fact. Like other rakshasas,

the palms of a naztharune

rakshasas  hands  are  where

the backs of the hands would be

on  a  human.  While  this  physical  feature

doesnt  detract  from  the  creatures  manual  dexterity,  it

makes a rakshasa look very disturbing to those unfamil-

iar with the creature.

Naztharune  rakshasas,  like  most  rakshasas,  tend  to  be

solitary creatures but will work with other rakshasas when

necessary  and  even  team  up  with  other  naztharunes  on

a  continuing  basis.  They  sometimes  work  as  in ltrators

and spies for akchazar rakshasas, and they sometimes hire

themselves out to other creatures as mercenaries or assas-

sins. Naztharune rakshasas have a hearty contempt for all

creatures except other rakshasas, but they can suppress this

feeling when it pro ts them to do so. Unlike most of their

rakshasa brethren, naztharune rakshasas feel less of a need

to  be  the  boss  in  every  operation.  They  are  much  more

mercenary in their desires and needs.

A  naztharune  rakshasa  is  about  the  same  height  and

weight as an elf (5 feet tall, 100 pounds).

Naztharune  rakshasas  speak  Common,  Infernal,  and

Undercommon.

COMBAT

Unlike  their  spellcasting  cousins,  a  naztharune  rakshasa

enjoys sneaking up on a target and killing it in close combat.

Whenever possible, it uses allies to distract opponents and

maneuver into  anking situations.

Detect Thoughts (Su): A naztharune rakshasa can con-

tinuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th;

Will DC 17 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability

as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Change Shape (Su): A naztharune rakshasa can assume

any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a stan-

dard action. In humanoid form, a naztharune loses its

claw attacks (although it usually uses weapons

and armor). A naztharune rakshasa typically

remains in one form until it chooses to

assume a new one. A change

in form cannot be dispelled,

but  a  naztharune  reverts  to

its natural form when killed.

A  true  seeing  spell  reveals  its

natural form.

Evasion (Ex): If a naztha-

rune  rakshasa  is  exposed

to  any  effect  that

normally allows it

to attempt a Reflex

saving  throw  for  half

damage, it takes no dam-

age with a successful saving

throw.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): A naz-

tharune  rakshasa  can  use  the  Hide  skill

even while being observed. As long as it is

within  10  feet  of  some  sort  of  shadow,  a

naztharune  rakshasa  can  hide  itself  from

view  in  the  open  without  anything  to  actu-

ally hide behind. It cannot, however, hide in its

own shadow.

7/13/04   5:34:14 PM

7/13/04   5:34:14 PM

Improved  Evasion  (Ex):  This  ability  works  like  eva-

sion, except that while a naztharune rakshasa still takes no

damage on a successful Re ex save against spells such as a

 reball or a breath weapon, it now takes only half damage on

a failed save.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A naztharune rakshasa

cannot be  anked except by a rogue of at least 15th level.

Shadow  Jump  (Su):  A  naztharune  rakshasa  has  the

ability  to  travel  between  shadows  as  if  by  means  of  a

dimension  door  spell.  The  limitation  is  that  the  magical

transport must begin and end in an area with at least some

shadow. A naztharune can jump up to 20 feet each day in

this way; this can be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps

of 10 feet each.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  If  a  naztharune  rakshasa  can  catch

an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively

from its attack, it can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basi-

cally,  the  naztharune  rakshasas  attack  deals  extra  damage

any time its target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC

(whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or

when the naztharune rakshasa  anks its target. This extra

damage is 1d6 points at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every

two rogue levels thereafter. Should the naztharune rakshasa

score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is

not multiplied.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A naztharune rakshasa can react

to danger before its senses would normally allow it to do

so. It retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even when caught

 at-footed.

Skills: A naztharune rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on

Bluff checks and Disguise checks.

When  using  change  shape,  a  naztharune  rakshasa

gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise

checks.  If  it  is  reading  an  opponents  mind,  its  circum-

stance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by

a further +4.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

A naztharune rakshasa generally attacks from ambush. Naz-

tharunes sometimes work in pairs to maximize their  ank-

ing  and  sneak  attack  opportunities.  They  avoid   ghting

constructs, undead, and other creatures against whom they

cannot use their sneak attack.

Prior  to  Combat:  Hide  and  detect  thoughts  to  monitor  ap-

proach of victims.

Round 1: Spring from the shadows, attack a living creature

with a short sword, and deal sneak attack damage.

Round 2: Move and hide again. If unable to hide (due to a

daylight spell or other reason), full attack.

Round 3: Move and hide again. If unable to hide (due to

a daylight spell or other reason), full attack. If moderately

injured, shadow jump to safety and  ee. Repeat round 3

tactics until combat ends.

NAZTHARUNE RAKSHASAS

NAZTHARUNE RAKSHASAS

IN EBERRON

Naztharune  rakshasas  are  loyal  servants  of  the  great

rakshasa  rajahs  imprisoned  in  Khyber  below  the  Demon

Wastes. They work their masters evil abroad, eliminating

threats to the Lords of Dust and spying on their enemies

from  the  shadows.  Naztharune  rakshasas  often  work  in

pairs  and  have  toadies  and  minions  scattered  throughout

Khorvaire, most of them mid- to high-ranking members of

thieves guilds.

NAZTHARUNE RAKSHASAS

IN FAERN

Most  naztharune  rakshasas  serve  the  akchazar  rakshasas

as spies and assassins. A pair of akchazar rakshasas operat-

ing in Unther has sent naztharune agents to stir up unrest

in neighboring Chessenta, most notably in the cities of

Cimbar, Luthcheq, and Soorenar. These naztharune rak-

shasas have already compromised several local guilds and

eliminated key politicians and merchants in an attempt to

turn the Chessentan cities hatred of one another into open

war. Naztharune rakshasas have also been encountered in

cities as far west as Waterdeep and Calimport, in some cases

pursuing their own agendas.

REDCAP

You see a very short, tough-looking old man with leathery skin,

iron boots, and bright red hat. He is wielding a scythe that looks

too large for him. His wicked grin is lined with sharp teeth.

Redcaps  are  the  most  evil  fey  youre  ever  likely  to  meet.

They  are  mass-murdering  psychotic  killers  who  live  on

other  creatures  pain.  A  redcap  stands  3  to  4  feet  tall,

weighs about 50 pounds, and looks like a tough old man

with protruding teeth. On their heads redcaps wear bright

red  hatskept  fresh  and  moistly  colored  by  dipping  in

their  victims  bloodand  on  their  feet  they  wear  boots

of iron.

Redcaps  prefer  to  roost  in  old  abandoned  keeps  and

towers, preferably ones left vacant by some horri c tragedy.

These fey absorb some of the essence of every creature they

kill. Thanks to this ability, a redcap that manages to live a

long  life  can  amass  tremendous  strength  and  near  invul-

nerability. When a redcap dies, it vanishes from the world,

leaving only a single tooth behind.

Redcaps speak Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Redcaps  prefer  to  attack  from  ambush,  usually  waiting

until  their  intended  victims  are  preparing  to  settle  in  for

the  evening.  Brutal  combatants,  redcaps  attack  without

mercy,  opening  up  combat  with  their  slings  and  magic

stones  but  quickly  closing  to   nish  opponents  with  their

wicked scythes.

A  redcap  normally  attacks  using  its  Power  Attack  feat,

taking a 2 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +2 bonus

on damage rolls (+4 if using a scythe).

Eldritch Stone (Su): Bullets  red from a redcaps sling

glow with a greenish-blue magical energy, giving them a

+1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls as

well  as  dealing  1d6  points  of  damage  (instead  of  the  1d4

points an ordinary bullet deals).

Powerful  Build  (Ex):  The  physical  stature

of a redcap lets it function in many ways as if

he were one size category larger. Whenever

a redcap is subject to a size modi er or spe-

cial  size  modi er  for  an  opposed  check

(such as during grapple checks, bull rush

attempts,  and  trip  attempts),  the  redcap  is

treated as one size larger if doing so is advan-

tageous to it. A redcap is also considered to be

one size larger when determining whether a

creatures  special  attacks  based  on  size

(such  as  improved  grab  or  swallow

whole) can affect it. A redcap

can  use  weapons  de-

signed for a creature

one size larger with-

out  penalty.  However,

its  space  and  reach

remain  those  of  a

creature  of  its  actual

size. The bene ts of this characteristic stack with

the  effects  of  powers,  abilities,  and  spells  that  change  the

subjects size category.

ELDER REDCAP

The elder redcap entry represents a redcap that has advanced

to 12 HD by slaying victims and absorbing their essence

(see Advancement, below).

Combat

An elder redcap  ghts in a similar manner to the younger

version, relying on ambush whenever possible. It is capable

of tracking weak or wounded prey for miles, waiting until

the intended victims let down their guard.

ADVANCEMENT

After a redcap has slain a victim, it dips its cap into the

victims  blood,  thereby  gradually  gaining  strength  and

power. This ability is re ected in special rules for advance-

ment that apply only to redcaps. For each additional Hit

Die a redcap has, it gains +1 Strength, +1 Dexterity, and +1

Constitution as well as the normal bene ts for advancing

in Hit Dice. For every 2 additional Hit Dice, an advanced

redcap gains +1 natural armor. The redcaps damage reduc-

tion also improves as its Hit Dice increase, as indicated on

the table below.

Redcaps  assemble  in  small  bands,  occasionally

squatting  in  old  ruins  or  caves  after  slaughter-

ing  the  previous  tenants.  Redcaps  argue  and

 ght  with  each  other  constantly,

and   aring  tempers  often  result

in  bloodshed.  They  will  massacre

each  other  with  little  provocation,  but

they do not douse their hats in each others

blood,  fearful  that

some  curse  will  be

visited  upon  them.

It takes one or more red-

cap  elders  to  maintain

some semblance of con-

trol  over  a  group,

essentially  bully-

ing the younger redcaps

into submission.

Redcaps  can  live  up  to  150  years,  al-

though  they  typically  die  at  a  much  younger  age.

They are asexual creatures that propagate by budding.

REDCAPS IN EBERRON

Murderous gangs of redcaps prowl the hills of Khorvaire

as  far  west  as  the  foothills  of  the  Byeshk  Mountains  in

Droaam  and  as  far  east  as  the  foothills  of  the  Hoarfrost

Mountains in the Lhazaar Principalities. Redcaps are found

in  considerable  numbers  in  the  Mror  Holds,  where  they

display a particularly  endish hatred for dwarves. Redcaps

that  spend  their  days  hunting  dwarves  near  the  Goradra

Gap refer to themselves as dwarfsplitters.

REDCAPS IN FAERN

Redcaps  are  found  throughout  Faern,  although  they  are

a  particular  nuisance  to  the  hal ings  of  Luiren.  In  many

hal ing fairy tales, redcaps are described as hal ings who

were cursed with murderous rage as punishment for some

dreadful  act  of  betrayal.  However,  these  tales  are  nothing

more than whimsy.

A redcap buds once or twice in its lifetime, carrying each

bud on its back like a hump for six months before it falls off

and sprouts a head and limbs. A newborn redcap must fend

for itself immediately and quickly develops a ravenous and

foul demeanor. It grows to its full size within a year after

its birth.

Redcaps  have  their  own  elaborately  interwoven  super-

stitions. They believe rivers contain water spirits that can

snatch their souls, so they bathe only in still water. Dubious

of  even-numbered  quantities,  they  always  travel  in  odd-

numbered groups, and no redcap will carry an even number

of coins in its pouch. Redcaps are not devout creatures, but

redcaps who live near human settlements sometimes wor-

ship Erythnul, the god of slaughter. Redcap adepts are rare,

and redcap clerics rarer still.

The  rejkars  are  a  race  of  crea-

tures  that  resemble  a  caribou  or

stag but can freeze a target solid

with  a  single  glance.  Native  to

Baator,  rejkars  originally  made

their  home  on  the  frigid  layer  of

Cania,  but  they  are  not  devils.

The creatures loathe the baate-

zu and their kin, and many have

found their way to the arctic re-

gions of other planes to seize new territory and power. They

dream  someday  of  turning  these  conquests  into  a  power

base from which they can seize all of Cania.

Typically, rejkars appear to the leader of an arctic civiliza-

tion, promising to turn their magical powers to the bene t

of the tribe. They create food for the starving, aid in craft-

work, and even share visions of future events. Over time,

the leader becomes dependent on the mystic caribou that

aid him, and the rejkars control the entire tribe through its

leader. Soon, the tribe uses weapons crafted by the rejkars

Rejkar

140

to  turn  against  its  neighbors,  and  thus  more  mortals  are

brought under the monsters control.

A rejkar is almost 8 feet long and stands 6 feet tall at the

shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.

Rejkars speak Abyssal, Common, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin,

and Infernal.

COMBAT

When facing foes more threatening than a typical tribes-

man, a rejkar commands any minions it has under its sway

to attack, inflaming their battle lust with magic. When

a  rejkar  must  fight,  it  uses  its  gaze  to  disable  as  many

enemies  as  possible  before  charging  the  hardiest  with  a

powerful gore.

A rejkars natural weapons are treated as magic for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcrushing despair (DC 16),

fabricate, rage; 3/daymajor image (DC 15); 1/weekaugury.

Caster level 5th.

Freezing  Gaze  (Su):  Rejkars  have  a

dangerous  gaze  attack  with  a  range

of 30 feet. Any creature affected by

the gaze freezes in place, completely

motionless  as  a  layer  of  ice  crystals

forms over its body (Fortitude DC 16

negates).  Every  round  after  being

frozen,  the  creature  can  attempt

a  new  saving  throw  to  end  the

effect. A creature that succeeds

on the saving throw is immune

to that particular rejkars gaze

for 24 hours.

Creatures  with  resis-

tance  or  immunity  to  cold

are  unaffected  by  the  freez-

ing  gaze.  Heat  can  melt  the

ice crystals; if 5 or more points of

 re  damage  are  dealt  to  a  frozen

creature, the effect ends. A rejkar

can  suppress  or  resume  its  gaze

attack as a free action on its turn.

The save DC is Charisma-based

and includes a +2 bonus for the

Ability Focus feat.

Heroes  Feast  (Sp):  Once  per  week,  three

rejkars working together can create a heroes feast

(caster  level  11th).  The  creatures  usually  use  this

reward as an incentive for their pawns.

Skills: A rejkar has a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and

Sense Motive checks.

REJKARS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, rejkars hail from the icy

plane of Risia. Herds of rejkars inhabit the Frostfell, and a

lone rejkar is sometimes encountered in the cold tundra of

northeastern Khorvaire.

This large creature looks like a f leshy tree, with four

tentacles  waving  gently  above  it.  Its  skin  pulses

and dances with a hypnotic, ever-changing range

of colors.

The prismatic roper is a patient

predator that lurks in the less

deep  regions  of  an  under-

ground  environment.  It

has  the  ability  to  change

its skin color rapidly, like a

squid, which allows  it  to

blend  into  a  rocky  land-

scape or produce a mesmerizing

array  of  colors  that  draws  in

prey. Prismatic ropers are the

bane of many underground commu-

nities, since nests of these creatures tend to be

located along heavily traveled paths.

A prismatic roper subsists primarily on small

cave animals, which are easily drawn in by the prismatic

ropers coloration, but it also preys on larger humanoids.

It is slow and ponderous when walking, only doing so to

move  to  new  hunting  ground,  but  it  is  lightning-quick

with its tentacles when a creature comes too close. Like

an ordinary roper, a prismatic roper stands 9 feet tall and

weighs 2,200 pounds.

Unlike  ordinary  ropers,  prismatic  ropers do not under-

stand or speak any language. They communicate among

themselves by rapidly changing their skin colors.

COMBAT

A  prismatic  roper  lurks  in  the  darkness  and  uses  its  tre-

morsense to locate approaching creatures. If not severely

outnumbered, it uses its hypnotic coloration to lure prey

close  before  lashing  out  with  its  tentacles  and  injecting

its paralytic poison. It will direct a color spray toward the

largest  cluster  of  opponents,  but  only  if  they  are  within

easy  reach  once  they  become  fascinated  by  its  effect.  If

approached by larger or more numerous foes, a prismatic

roper  blends  into  the  background  and  tries  to  remain

hidden, unless a creature approaches within its tentacle

reach. Once its prey is paralyzed, it will squeeze the life

out of the creature before bringing it to its mouth, which

is located on the top of its head.

Color Spray (Sp): 3/daycolor spray (DC 13). Caster level

9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Hypnotic Coloration (Ex): A prismatic roper

can use a standard action to change colors rapidly

like a squid, creating a mesmerizing display. This effect

grants the creature concealment and fascinates all who

can  see  it  (Will  DC  18  negates).  Those  fascinated  by  a

prismatic roper approach the creature at walking

speed. When using this ability, a prismatic roper

loses  its  normal  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks

(see below).

Sightless creatures are not affected. This is a

mind-affecting ability. The save DC is Charisma-

based  and  includes  a  +2  bonus  from  the  Ability

Focus feat.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17,

initial  1d6  Dex,  secondary  paralysis.  The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Skills:  *Prismatic  ropers

gain a +20 racial bonus on Hide

checks in underground areas

due to their camouflaged hide.

This  apelike  creature  is  completely

hairless, and cancerous blemishes

and  strange  disf igurements

cover its thick, yellow-green flesh.

Two  thick  tongues,  dripping

with  black  ichor,  protrude

from  the  things  mouth.

Each one winds around one

of  the  creatures  thick  arms,

looping  down  the  limb  to  lick

the blades of the cleavers that

it wields.

Rot  reavers  crave  the  taste

of  undead   esh,  gaining  suste-

nance from the consumption of the

foul  energies  that  animate  the  undead.  While

a creature that hunts and consumes undead might

be seen as a boon to civilized creatures, the rot

reaver remains a menace to living creatures

as well. Although a rot reaver is willing to

destroy  and  consume  existing  undead,  it

gains  greater  pleasure  and  more  ful-

 lling sustenance from killing living

creatures, animating them as undead

thralls,  and  then  feasting  on  their

necromantic energy.

142

A rot reaver looks like a squat, hairless ape with short hind

legs and long, powerful arms. It walks about on all fours in

apelike  fashion,  but  rises  onto  its  hind  legs  to   ght.  Even

when running, it holds two magical cleavers in its hands.

A  rot  reaver  stands  about  4  feet  tall  when  walking  on  all

fours, and rises to a height of just over 6 feet when standing.

It weighs about 250 pounds. A rot reavers most disturbing

feature is its twin tongues which loop around the creatures

arms and hang far enough down to lick the blades of the

creatures  cleavers.  Looped  around  the  creatures  arms  as

they are, the tongues follow the movement of the cleavers,

and any time a rot reaver strikes something with a cleaver, it

attempts to lick the wound with the accompanying tongue,

causing wound rot (see below).

When a rot reaver touches a living creature with one of

its cancerous tongues after it has wounded the creature, it

drains  some  of  the  creatures  health  and  vitality  away.  At

the same time, it transfers some of the necromantic energy

that suffuses its own body into its victim. Should a creature

struck by the tongue die within 24 hours, the rot reaver can

animate it as an undead creature. Although they eventu-

ally consume any creature that they animate, rot reavers

are smart enough to keep some of their undead creations

around as minions.

Bred and warped by magic, rot reavers were created to

serve  in  some  long-lost  mage  war,  perhaps  designed  to

counter  the  undead  legions  of  some  powerful  group  of

necromancers. That they have outlived the record of their

creators and the war for which they were bred proves the

power of their perverted form of life.

Rot reavers gain no sustenance from incorporeal undead,

but they still attempt to control or destroy such creatures in

the event of a chance meeting.

Rot reavers speak Common.

COMBAT

A brutal and formidable opponent, a rot reaver

charges  into  battle  and  smashes  its  cleavers

into  its  foes.  Although  it  gains  sustenance

from  undead   esh,  a  rot  reavers  greatest  joy

comes  from  the  destruction  and  reanimation

of  living  creatures.  Even  the  most  voracious

rot reaver is smart enough to preserve some of

the  creatures  it  animates  as  minions,  and

it  sends  these  creatures  into  battle  to

soften  up  its  opponents.  If  possible,

a rot reaver will isolate one opponent,

bring that individual down with the help

of its undead minions, and then ani-

mate  that  foe  immediately  while

its undead servitors move on

to the next opponent.

When pressed, a rot reaver

does not hesitate to use its

drain  unlife  ability  on  its

own  undead  minions,  slashing  away

at  the  undead  creature  with  its  cleavers

Rot reaver

and gaining strength as it does so.

Cleaver Mastery (Ex): A rot reavers cleavers are identi-

cal in appearance to +1 handaxesexcept that in a reavers

hands, these cleavers deal quadruple damage on a critical hit

(rather than a handaxes triple damage).

Rebuke Undead (Su): A rot reaver can rebuke undead

as an evil cleric of 10th level. The creature can control

any  undead  of  5  Hit  Dice  or  less  when  it  successfully

affects  the  undead  with  its  rebuke  ability,  and  it  can

command up to 10 Hit Dice worth of undead at any

one time.

Wound Rot (Su): Any time a rot reaver damages

a living creature with one of its cleavers in melee,

it  can  immediately  make  a  touch  attack  with  one  of

its black, cancerous tongues (attack bonus +9). If the touch

attack succeeds, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution

damage and becomes vulnerable to the rot reavers animate

dead ability.

Creatures immune to ability damage are immune to this

special attack.

Animate Dead (Su): As a standard action, a rot reaver

can  animate  any  dead  creature  within  60  feet  that  was

affected by its wound rot ability within the last 24 hours.

Creatures animated by a rot reaver rise as zombies.

A rot reaver can animate a number of Hit Dice of crea-

tures equal to its own Hit Dice. Any attempt to animate a

creature whose HD would cause this limit to be exceeded

automatically fails. These animated undead are under the

command of the rot reaver, and they do not count against

the total number of Hit Dice of undead that a rot reaver can

control using its rebuke undead ability.

Drain Unlife (Su): Any time a rot reaver damages an

undead creature with one of its cleaver attacks, it heals a

number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.

Immunity  to  Energy  Drain  (Su):  Rot  reavers  are

immune to energy drain attacks.

Skills: A rot reaver has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.

At first glance, this creature looks like an ape in jet-black armor.

Twin  tongues,  dripping  with  disgusting  ichor,  snake  from  its

helmeted head and loop around its armored arms.

Necrothanes are the vicious, malevolent champions of the

rot reaver species. Physically, a necrothanes resembles its

rot  reaver  brethren,  but  its  apelike  form  is  encased  in  a

magical suit of jet-black full plate armor. With its power-

ful  combat  options  and  its  ability  to  create  numberless

hordes  of  undead,  a  necrothane  is  a  danger  capable  of

wiping  out  entire  communities  of  living  creatures.

Because it is smart enough to realize that its depredations

are likely to draw the attention of powerful adventurers,

a necrothane usually prepares several escape routes and

seeks out magic items that allow it to make a speedy exit

should the need arise.

Rarely, a necrothane enters into a unholy pact with a

necromancer  or  a  cabal  of  evil  priests.  These  spellcast-

ers provide the necrothane with magical equipment and

living  victims,  and  the  necrothane  in  turn  gives  these

spellcasters an easy way to raise and maintain an army of

zombie minions.

Combat

A necrothane approaches combat much as an ordinary rot

reaver does, but its ability to command greater numbers of

undead allows them to employ more sophisticated tactics.

Typically, a necrothane remains hidden in some secret loca-

tion,  commanding  its  undead  minions  to  bring  it  living

creatures to animate and consume.

Cleaver  Mastery  (Ex):  A  necrothanes  cleavers  are

identical  in  appearance  to  +1  handaxesexcept  that  in  a

necrothanes hands, these cleavers deal quadruple damage

on a critical hit (rather than a handaxes triple damage).

Rebuke Undead (Su): A necrothane can rebuke undead

as an evil cleric of 20th level. The creature can control any

undead of 10 Hit Dice or less when it successfully affects the

undead with its rebuke ability, and it can command up to 20

Hit Dice worth of undead at any one time.

Wound  Rot  (Su):  Any  time  a  necrothane  damages  a

living  creature  with  one  of  its  cleavers  in  melee,  it  can

immediately  make  a  touch  attack  with  one  of  its  black,

cancerous tongues (attack bonus +18). If the touch attack

succeeds, the target takes 1 point of Constitution damage

and  becomes  vulnerable  to  the  necrothanes  animate

dead ability.

Creatures immune to ability damage are immune to this

special attack.

Animate Dead (Su): As a standard action, a necrothane

can  animate  any  dead  creature  within  60  feet  that  was

affected by its wound rot ability within the last 24 hours.

Creatures animated by a necrothane rise as zombies.

ROT REAVERS AND RELIGION

Rot  reavers  occupy  an  odd  place  in  the  religious  belief

systems  of  many  cultures.  Followers  of  death  or  undeath-

related deities such as Wee Jas, the Keeper and the Undying

Court (Eberron), or Kelemvor (Forgotten Realms) believe

rot  reavers  were  created  as  a  punishment  and  a  scourge

against evil undead. Those religions that believe in the cre-

ation of undead sometimes  ght against the rot reavers but

more often use the abominable creatures as a threat to keep

their creations in line.

Some  believe  that  rot  reavers  have  their  own  religion

devoted to death, darkness, and negative energy. If so, their

clerics abilities certainly stack with their own natural abil-

ity to rebuke undead and these clerical rot reavers must be

fearsome indeed.

ROT REAVERS IN EBERRON

Rot  reavers  are  foul  creations  of  the  daelkyr.  Speculation

abounds concerning the reasons for their creation. The dael-

kyr may have bred rot reavers to deal with some growing

undead menace or to deal with vampire cabals and liches

determined  to  learn  their  secrets,  or  they  may  have  been

experimenting  with  fell  negative  energies  seeping  into

Eberron from the plane of Mabar, the Endless Night.

Rot  reavers  prowl  the  caverns  and  passageways  of

Khyber, occasionally  nding their way into the dungeons

and  warrens  below  ruined  fortresses  across  Khorvaire.

They are also drawn to locations where Mabar is cotermi-

nous with Eberron, toward portals and gates suffused with

negative energy.

ROT REAVERS IN FAERN

A  secret  cabal  of  undead  spellcasters  called  the  Twisted

Rune created the  rst rot reavers. More accurately, rot reav-

ers are the work of three allied Runecastersthe leaders

of the cabal. Runecaster Rhangaun, a thousand-year-old

human  lich  living  in  Calimshan,  has  more  than  one  rot

reaver necrothane guarding his phylactery. Sapphiraktar

the Blue, the only dracolich Runecaster, uses rot reavers to

replenish the undead guardians in its subterranean lair and

clear out surrounding areas of the Underdark. The identity

of the third Runecaster remains hidden.

Level Adjustment:



The  creature  before  you

looks like a large, hairless

wolf. Its pale, slimy skin is cov-

ered with bizarre, abstract

tattoos.  As  it  moves  for-

ward, you see that it has no

head; instead, a long, ser-

pentine  neck  extends

from  the  middle  of

its  back,  terminating  in

a  grotesquely  oversized

maw  filled  with  mul-

tiple  rows  of  teeth.

Though it has no eyes,

the  mouth  unerringly

whips  around  to  face

you,  spewing  forth  a

jet of acidic bile.

A  runehounds  slick

skin is pale and mottled, although keepers often tattoo gar-

ish patterns on their runehounds. A runehound can be up to

6 feet long and 3-1/2 feet tall at the shoulder, and can weigh

up to 360 pounds.

Runehounds have a limited language using clicks and squeals,

which is virtually impossible for humanoids to reproduce. Most

understand Undercommon, though they cannot speak it.

COMBAT

Runehounds  are  cunning  and  tenacious  creatures.  If  an

enemy does not possess ranged weapons, a runehound will

attempt to use its speed to  ank its opponents, staying out of

reach while using its acidic spew to injure its foes. Against a

foe with ranged weapons, the hound will use its sticky spew

against the strongest ranged combatant and then close as

quickly as possible. It makes maximum use of its re exes

and extended reach, striking out against any creature that

moves through its threatened space.

Vile Spew (Ex): A runehound can produce two noxious

substances that it can spit with tremendous force. It can

emit a stream of acid that deals 1d6 points of damage for

every  Hit  Die  the  runehound  possesses  (5d6  for  a  typical

specimen), with a DC 15 Re ex save halving this damage.

Alternatively, it can spit a glob of glutinous goo that acts as

a  single-target  web  spell;  a  DC  15  Re ex  save  negates  the

effect. Both attacks have a range of 100 feet, require a suc-

cessful ranged touch attack, and can be used once every 1d4

rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Extended  Reach  (Ex):

The  serpentine  neck  of  a

runehound  is  long  and  power-

ful, giving the creature a

reach of 10 feet with its

bite  attack;  this  reach

also  allows  it  to  threaten

a  10-foot-radius  area.

Because  of  the   exibil-

ity of its neck, the rune-

hound can attack adjacent

foes with no penalty.

Psychic  Scent  (Su):  A

runehound  tracks  by  fol-

lowing  psychic  trails  and

aura  traces.  It  gains  a  +20  bo-

nus on all Survival checks

made  to  track.  *It  does

not  receive  this  bonus

against  mindless  crea-

tures or creatures shielded

against mental effects.

Uncanny Blindsight

(Su):  Runehounds  are

blind  but  perceive  their

surroundings with their

psychic senses. This abil-

ity provides a runehound

with blindsight out to 500

feet. In addition, a rune-

hound cannot be  anked.

RUNEHOUNDS IN EBERRON

Runehounds serve the daelkyr, the dolgaunts, and the Cults

of the Dragon Below. Independent packs can occasionally

be found in Khyber, the Shadow Marches, and the Eldeen

Reaches. In daelkyr and dolgaunt armies, runehounds serve

as trackers and living artillery.

This  humanoid  figure  is  mum-

mified,  desiccated,  and  so

encrusted with salt that it is

impossible  to  determine  its

original race. Despite its min-

eral  encrustation,  it  lurches

forward, reaching eagerly.

Salt  mummies  are  pre-

served  corpses  of  ancient

humanoids  who  were  accidentally  buried

too close to veins of white, brittle salt. Of course,

salt  alone  is  not  suf cient  to  suffuse  a  body  with  undead

vigor; often, such a creature has taken a great sin with it

to its subterranean grave, the horror of which eventually

creates a linkage to the Negative Energy Plane.

A salt mummy is usually encountered by miners work-

ing a new deposit. It appears at first to be nothing more

than an old, salt-rimed corpse. If the miners continue to

dig it out, eventually the mummy becomes animate and

waits until it is almost dug free. The shuddering crack as

a salt mummy breaks away from a salt vein is a dreadful

thing to hear.

A salt mummy stands around 6 feet tall and weighs about

180 pounds.

Some  salt  mummies  know  Common,  but  many  more

know only the ancient language they spoke when living, a

language now long dead.

COMBAT

In melee combat, a salt mummy delivers a powerful blow,

but worse than that, its salt-encrusted body is supernatu-

rally arid.

A salt mummy normally attacks using its Power Attack

feat, taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a

+5 bonus on damage rolls.

Dehydrating  Impact

(Su):  Each  time  a  salt  mum-

my  touches  a  living  creature,

the creature must make a DC 19

Fortitude save or take 4d6 points

of damage as moisture is evapo-

rated from its body. This impact

is  especially  devastating  to  plants

and creatures with the water subtype

(such  as  water  elementals),  which

take 4d8 points of damage. Even

on a successful save, a creature

still  loses  moisture,  taking

half damage. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Water Weakness: All water

deals damage to a salt mummy as

if it were holy water.

Unholy  Toughness  (Ex):  A

salt mummy gains a bonus to its hit

points equal to its Charisma modi er 

its Hit Dice.

SALT MUMMIES

IN EBERRON

Clerics  of  the  Blood  of  Vol  some-

times seal the corpses of slain assas-

sins, corrupt of cials, and criminals

in  caskets  packed  with  salt  in

hopes of spurring the trans-

formation of those corpses

into  salt  mummies.  Most

salt  mummies,  however,  are

found undergroundthe remains of evil adven-

turers, goblinoids, and other humanoid creatures killed in

Khyber and ravaged by the salt deposits.

SALT MUMMIES IN FAERN

Salt mummies haunt some of the larger salt caverns under

Faern, most notably in the Buried Realms near the dwarf

ruins  of  Tethyamar  (under  Anauroch),  Deep  Raurin

(beneath the Raurin Desert), and the Darklands (especially

near  the  troglodyte  warrens  of  Traaskl  Thorog,  located

under Chessenta).

Blindsight  (Ex):  A  sea  tiger

emits  high-frequency  sounds  inau-

This long, streamlined creature has a striped, leathery hide with

a dorsal fin like a killer whale or a dolphin. Unlike a fish, it has

four muscular legs ending in webbed claws. Long fangs jut from

between rows of sharp teeth.

Sea  tigers  are  aquatic  mammals  similar  to  sea  lions  and

walruses. They hunt anything they can catch, including

 sh, birds, and animals foolish enough to stray too close to

the shore. Sea tigers can often be seen on rocky shorelines,

sunning themselves in large family groups.

Sea tigers have the intelligence of dogs and wolves, and

they can be trained much the same way.

The  biggest,  strongest  member,  regardless  of  gender,

leads a sea tiger pod. A pod includes females (half as many

as males) and young (half as many as females).

A typical sea tiger is about 20 feet long and weighs 3 tons.

SEA TIGER ANIMAL COMPANIONS

AND SPECIAL MOUNTS

Druids of 10th level or higher can select sea tiger animal

companions. Apply a 9 adjustment to the druids level for

purposes  of  determining  the  companions  characteristics

and special abilities (as described in The Druids Animal

Companion  sidebar,  page  36  of  the  Players  Handbook).  A

rangers effective druid level, for purposes of gaining a sea

tiger animal companion, is half his ranger level.

A paladin of 9th level or higher can select a sea tiger as his

special mount. Apply a 4 adjustment to the paladins level

for  purposes  of  determining  the  mounts  characteristics

and special abilities (as described in The Paladins Mount

sidebar, page 45 of the Players Handbook).

SEA TIGERS IN EBERRON

Some coast-dwelling people domesticate and raise sea tigers,

using them as mounts and training them to herd schools

of  sh into their nets. The largest pods of sea tigers prowl

the  coastlines  of  the  Lhazaar  Principalities,  occasionally

competing with dragon turtles for food.

SERYULIN

This large, sluglike creature measures nearly 9 feet long from its

tooth-filled maw to the end of its glistening tail. Its body is a pale

green, the color of wave crests, and covered with long, thin, undu-

lating cilia that seem to move of their own accord. Two antennae

sprout from the top of its blunted head, probing the air.

The amphibious seryulins live near coastal areas, hunting

for   sh  and  small  water-dwelling  mammals  on  which  to

feed.  Using  their  sluglike  antennae  and  sensitive  cilia  to

 nd prey, they make deadly hunters.

Many sentient aquatic races befriend or enslave seryulins

to use as both land- and water-based mounts. The surprise

advantage gained by riding a seryulin out of the water and

into a land battle is often signi cant, since many foes under-

estimate a seryulins land speed until they see the creature

in action.

An  undomesticated  seryu-

lin  spends  most  of  its  time

hunting.  An  omnivore,  it  pri-

marily  goes  after  seals,  large

 sh  (including  sharks), and its

favorite prey: sahuagin.

An  average  seryu lin  mea-

sures between 8 and 10 feet

in  length  and  weighs

between 900 and 1,200

pounds.  Seryulins  do

not speak but can un-

derstand Aquan.

in  combat.  Aware  that

most  opponents  will

underestimate  them,

seryulins  have  been  known

to  lure  prey  to  them  by   oundering

in shallow water, feigning a beached

state.  Once  engaged  in  battle,  seryulins

typically  activate  their  sticky  spray  before

moving in to use slam attacks.

Seryulin  riders  take  advantage  of  the  painful

toxin secreted by a seryulins cilia to wear down foes. Once

a  victim  has  been  struck  by  the  cilia,  the  rider  typically

withdraws his mount for a round or two (into the water if

possible) and lets the toxin do its work.

Pain  Toxin  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  struck  by  a

seryulins slam attack is exposed to a substance secreted by

the cilia around its upper body. Contact with this substance

causes the target excruciating pain, and the target takes an

additional  1d6  points  of  damage  in  the  round  after  being

struck. Damage reduction does not apply to this effect. Crea-

tures with immunity to poison are immune to a seryulins

pain toxin.

Sticky Spray (Ex): Once per day, a seryulin can use a

standard action to expel a 20-foot-radius burst of viscous

Seryulin

148

goo from its body. Any creature in the area becomes entan-

gled and must succeed on a DC 17 Re ex save or become

glued  to  the  ground,  unable  to  move.  A   ying  creature  is

not stuck to the ground, but it must succeed on the save or

be unable to  y and fall to the ground. Seryulins, as well as

their riders, are unaffected by the sticky spray. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

A creature stuck to the ground can break free by mak-

ing  a  DC  20  Strength  check  or  by  dealing  15  points  of

damage  to  the  goo  with  a  slashing  weapon.  A  creature

trying to scrape the stuff off itself, or another creature as-

sisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the

goo is automatic, after which the creature that scored the

hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was

scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including

flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting

who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentra-

tion check to cast a spell.

The  goo  becomes  brittle

and  fragile  after  2d4

rounds, cracking apart

and  losing  its  effec-

tiveness.  An  application  of

universal  solvent  dissolves

enough  goo  to  free  one

creature immediately.

Cant  Be  Tripped  (Ex):  A

seryulins  body  shape  makes  it  im-

possible for a foe to trip the crea-

ture. Any trip attempts against

the  seryulin  automatically

fail,  as  if  the  opponent  had

failed  to  win  the  opposed

Strength check.

Slick  (Ex):  A  slip-

pery,  quick-dissolving

substance  secreted  by  a

seryulins body makes it

(and  its  rider)  immune

to  any  effect  that  usu-

ally impedes movement,

such  as  paralysis,  slow,

a  tangle foot  bag,  or  the

seryulins own sticky spray, much like the effect of

a freedom of movement spell.

Unlike  with  the  freedom  of  movement  spell,  howev-

er,  a  seryulin  does  not  automatically  succeed  on  any

grapple check made to resist a grapple or pin attempt,

although it does gain a +4 bonus on grapple checks to

escape a grapple, and it has a +8 racial bonus on Escape

Artist checks.

Skills:  A  seryulin  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  any  Swim

check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.

It  can  always  choose  to  take  10  on  a  Swim  check,  even  if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A  seryulin  also  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Escape  Artist

checks due to its slick body (see above).

GREATER SERYULIN

SERYULINS IN EBERRON

Particularly  large  specimens  of  seryulins  are  found  in

remote coastal areas that have plentiful food supplies. These

greater seryulins are capable of taking on whales and dire

sharks if the need arises.

Combat

The  save  DC  for  a  greater  seryulins  sticky  spray  (DC  24)

is  adjusted  for  its  greater  number  of  Hit  Dice  and  higher

Constitution score.

Sticky Spray (Ex): Once per day, a greater seryulin can

use a standard action to expel a 20-foot-radius burst of vis-

cous goo from its body. Any creature in the area becomes

entangled  and  must  succeed  on  a  DC  24  Re ex  save  or

become  glued  to  the  ground,  unable  to  move.  A   ying

creature is not stuck to the ground, but it must succeed on

the save or be unable to  y and fall to the ground. Greater

seryulins, as well as their riders, are unaffected by the sticky

spray. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The daelkyr created the  rst seryulins to serve as aquatic

mounts. When the Gatekeeper druids trapped the daelkyr

in Khyber, many daelkyr-created aberrationsincluding

the  seryulinsbecame  independent,  true-breeding  spe-

cies. Tritons inhabiting the Straits of Shargon occasionally

use  seryulins  as  mounts,  and  undomesticated  seryulins

prowl  the  stormy  coastal  waters  of  northern  Xendrik

as well as the cavernous, subterranean seas of Khyber.

Most of the seryulins encountered in Khyber are former

servants or cohorts of the daelkyr, and they are typically

greater specimens.

SERYULINS IN FAERN

Seryulins populate the Glimmersea. Kuo-toa clerics from

the Holy Mother Cauldron use them as mounts, as do a

number  of  other  Underdark  races  living  in  and  around

the Glimmersea. Specimens have also been encountered

as far west as the Giants Chalice, challenging the vampiric

squids that claim the subterranean lake for their own.

This lithe humanoid assumes a crouched posture, springing and

leaping nimbly as it walks. It has bestial features, including a

wide, flat nose, large eyes and heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, a

wild mane of hair, and long sideburns. A somewhat menacing

half-smile reveals sharp incisors.

Shifters, sometimes called the weretouched, are descended

from humanoids and natural lycanthropes. Shifters cannot

fully change shape but can take on animalistic featuresa

state they call shifting. Shifters have evolved into a unique

race that breeds true. They have a distinct culture with its

own traditions and identity.

Shifters  personalities  are  in uenced  by  their  animal

natures. Many are boorish and crude, while others are quiet,

shifty, and solitary. Just as most lycanthropes are carnivores,

shifters have a predatory personality and think of most activi-

ties in terms of hunting and prey. They view life as a challenge,

striving to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful.

A  typical  shifter  stands  about  5  feet  3  inches  tall  and

weighs  140  pounds.  Shifters  speak  Common  and  often

learn the languages of their neighbors in the wilderness

and  rural  areas  where  they  live,  including  Elven,  Gnome,

Hal ing, and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Shifters are aggressive and feral in their approach to combat.

When they feel superior to their opponents, they often stalk

them like prey, remaining concealed until they can strike

with  surprise.  They  avoid  stronger  opponents  but   ght

wildly if they are forced to.

Shifting  (Su):  A  shifter  can  tap  into  his  lycanthropic

heritage  to  gain  short  bursts  of  physical  power.  Once  per

day, a shifter can enter a state that is super cially similar to a

barbarians rage. Each shifter has one of six shifter traitsa

characteristic  that  manifests  when  he  is  shifting.  Each

shifter trait provides a +2 bonus to a physical ability score

(Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) and grants some other

advantage as well.

Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds

equal  to  3  +  the  shifters  Con  modi er.  (If  a  shifter  trait

or  other  effect  increases  the  shifters  Con  modi er,  use

the  newly  improved  modi er.)  A  shifter  can  take  feats  to

improve this ability (see Shifter Feats, below). Every shifter

feat a shifter takes increases the duration of shifting by 1

round. For every two shifter feats a shifter takes, the number

of times per day he can tap into the ability increases by one.

So, a shifter with two shifter feats can shift two times per

day (instead of the usual one), and each use of the ability

lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 (instead of 3) + the

shifters Con modi er.

Shifting,  though  related  to  and  developed  from  lycan-

thropy, is neither an af iction nor a curse. It is not passed on

by bite or claw attacks, and a shifter cant be curedshifting

is a natural ability for the race.

The shifter warrior presented here has the following stats

when shifted: Grp +3; Atk +3 melee (1d8+2/3 , battleaxe) or

+2 ranged (1d6+2, throwing axe); Full Atk +3 melee (1d8+2/

3, battleaxe) and 2 melee (1d6+1, bite); or +2 ranged (1d6+2,

throwing axe); Str 15; Climb +3, Jump +3.

Shifter base land speed is 30 feet.

Low-light vision.

 +2 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks.

Automatic  Languages:  Common.  Bonus  Lan-

guages: Elven, Gnome, Hal ing and Sylvan.

Favored Class: Ranger.

wielding a weapon in his primary hand, but all his attacks

in that round take a 2 penalty.

Wildhunt (Su): While shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2

bonus to Constitution and the scent ability. This ability allows

the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden

foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can iden-

tify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights.

A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by

sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases

to  60  feet;  if  downwind,  it  drops  to  15  feet.  Strong  scents,

such  as  smoke  or  rotting  garbage,  can  be  detected  at  twice

the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk

musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal

range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can

sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait.

When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location

of the source isnt revealedonly its presence somewhere

within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the

direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within

5 feet of the source, he pinpoints the sources location.

SHIFTER TRAITS

Each  shifter  has  one  special  trait

from among those described below.

Beasthide (Su): While shifting, a beast-

hide shifter gains a +2 bonus to Consti-

tution and natural armor that provides

a +2 bonus to AC.

Cliffwalk  (Su):  While  shifting,  a  cliff-

walk shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity

and has a climb speed of 20 feet.

Longstride (Su): While shifting, a longstride

shifter  gains  a  +2  bonus  to  Dexterity  and  a

bonus of +10 feet to his base land speed.

Longtooth  (Su):  While  shifting,  a

longtooth shifter gains a +2 bonus to

Strength and grows fangs that can be used as a

natural weapon, dealing 1d6 points of damage (plus an

additional +1 for every four character levels he has)

with a successful bite attack. He cannot attack more

than once each round with his bite, even if his base

attack bonus is high enough to give him multiple attacks.

He can use his bite as a secondary attack (taking a 5 penalty

on his attack roll) while wielding a weapon.

Razorclaw (Su): While shifting, a razorclaw shifter gains

a  +2  bonus  to  Strength  and  grows  claws  that  can  be  used

as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage

(plus  an  additional  +1  for  every  four  character  levels  he

has) with each successful attack. He can attack with one

claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack

action  (as  a  primary  natural  weapon).  He  cannot  attack

more than once per round with a single claw, even if his base

attack bonus is high enough to give him multiple attacks.

He can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while

Shifter

While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the

Track  feat  can  follow  tracks  by  smell,  making

Wisdom (or Survival) checks to  nd or follow

a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10

(regardless of the surface that holds the

scent). This DC increases or decreases

depending on how strong the quarrys

odor  is,  the  number  of  creatures  pro-

ducing the odor, and the age of the trail.

For each hour that the trail grows cold,

the DC increases by 2. The ability other-

wise follows the rules for the Track feat.

Wildhunt  shifters  tracking  by  scent

ignore the effects of surface condi-

tions and poor visibility.

When not shifted, a wildhunt

shifter  gains  a  +2  bonus  to  Survival

checks due to the lingering effects of the

scent ability.

SHIFTER SOCIETY

Shifters generally live among humans,

elves, or sylvan creatures, not in settle-

ments of their own. They prefer rural or wil-

derness regions, though signi cant numbers of them

live in the slums of human cities, often grouping together

into criminal gangs. Many shifters earn their way as trap-

pers, hunters,  shers, trackers, guides, and military scouts.

Shifters  usually  congregate  into  family  groups.  These

groups include about 30% noncombatants, primarily chil-

dren.  A  few  elders  govern  the  pack,  under  the  leadership

of  a  chief  who  is  usually  the  packs  oldest  member.  Some

shifters are loners, preferring the solitude of the wilderness

to human society or even the company of their own kind.

Most shifters are inclined toward druidic religion rather

than the worship of a speci c deity. They believe in the

divine  power  of  the  earth  itself,  the  elements,  and  the

creatures of the earth.

Shimmerlings are minus-

cule and nearly mindless

fey  that  feed  on  pollen.

Individually  harmless,

shimmerlings  would

be no more worrisome

than  sparrows  but  for

their ability to swarm.

Shimmerlings  form

swarms  when  under

great  stress.  Common

triggers are a lack of food

sources,  loss  of  habitat,

or overhunting by pred-

ators.  Shimmerlings  collect

into  swarms  primarily  to  move  the  entire

population to another location, but a swarm also develops

an aggressive group intelligence that often seeks revenge on

whatever it thinks caused the stress.

An  individual  shimmerling  looks  like  a  4-inch  tall  elf

with dragon y wings. Its skin and hair are the same color as

the glow it gives off, which can be any color of the rainbow.

A shimmerling weighs 1 ounce.

Shimmerlings speak Sylvan.

Shimmerling swarm

152

COMBAT

A shimmerling swarm often flies around out of reach of

foes  to  hypnotize  them  before  singling  out  one  to  sur-

round and attack. A shimmerling swarm deals 3d6 points

of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the

end of its move.

Dazzling  Illumination  (Su):  Each  shimmerling  in  a

shimmerling  swarm  glows  in  some  color  of  the  rainbow.

When the members of a swarm concentrate this glow, the

swarm sheds light equivalent to a daylight spell. This illumi-

nation dazzles any sighted creature within a 60-foot radius

that  has  its  eyes  open,  whether  or  not  it  is  looking  at  the

shimmerling swarm.

Furthermore,  the  swarms  display  of  light  and  move-

ment  is  hypnotic.  At  the  mere  sight  of  an  illuminated

shimmerling swarm, a creature within 300 feet must suc-

ceed on a DC 19 Will save or be fascinated for as long as

the swarm is in sight. Any potential threat allows another

saving throw against the effect, and an obvious threat auto-

matically frees the creature from the effect, as does vigor-

ous shaking. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw

is immune to that shimmerling swarms hypnotic form for

1 minute. This is a mind-affecting ability. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

A  shimmerling  swarm  can  activate  or  deactivate  its

dazzling illumination as a standard action. It cannot hide

(automatically fails Hide checks) while shedding dazzling

illumination.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a

shimmerling swarms damage that begins its turn with a

swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 15 For-

titude save negates the effect. Even after a successful save,

spellcasting  or  concentrat-

ing  on  spells  within  the

area of a swarm requires a

Concentration  check  (DC

20  +  spell  level).  Using

skills  requiring  patience

and  concentration  re-

quires a DC 20 Concentra-

tion check. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Hive  Mind  (Ex):  A

shimmerling  swarm  that

has  at  least  1  hit  point

per Hit Die (or 11 points

for  a  standard  shimmer-

ling swarm) forms a hive

mind,  giving  it  an  Intelli-

gence score of 7. When a shimmerling swarm

is  reduced  below  this  hit  point  threshold,  its  Intelligence

score is reduced to 1. This change reduces its skill modi ers

to the following values: Diplomacy +4, Hide +36, Listen +2,

Move Silently +6, Sense Motive +2, Spot +2.

Shredstorm

A shredstorm is a swarm of thousands of bladed disks crack-

ling  with  electricity.  Each  disk  is  a  magically  animated

adamantine  saw  blade,  roughly  the  size  of  a  shuriken,

spinning at tremendous speed. The magical ingredient in

their creation that allows them to  y binds them together

into a cohesive creature that can be commanded as one by

its creator.

Shredstorms  are  constructs  designed  for  use  on  the

battlefield to breach enemy fortifications and eviscerate

defenders. Commanders deploy them to rip through walls,

opening a passage for allied troops, or else to simply slip

into a castle and begin wiping out defenders from behind

their lines.

Each  individual  disk  that  makes  up  a  shredstorm  is  4

inches in diameter and weighs about 2 ounces.

Shredstorms do not speak.

COMBAT

A shredstorm follows the commands of its creator if that indi-

vidual is within 120 feet; if uncommanded, it follows its last

orders to the best of its ability. Its creator can give it simple

programs that the construct follows in its creators absence,

such as Enter the fortress and attack anyone inside.

Due to its deadly nature and electrical aura, a shredstorm

deals  4d6  points  of  damage  plus  2d6  points  of  electricity

damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end

of its move.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a

shredstorms  damage  that  begins  its  turn  with  a  swarm

in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 17 Fortitude

save negates the effect. Even after a successful save, spell-

casting  or  concentrating  on  spells  within  the  area  of  a

swarm  requires  a  Concentration  check  (DC  20  +  spell

level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration

requires  a  DC  20  Concentration  check.  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Lightning Bolt (Su): A shredstorm can discharge part

of its electrical aura in a blast of electricity that acts as a

lightning bolt cast by a 14th-level caster (Re ex DC 17 half).

A shredstorm requires 2d6 hours after each use of this abil-

ity  to  build  its  electrical  levels  back  up  to  full  strength;

during  this  time,  it  deals  only  1d6  points  of  electricity

damage to those whose space it occupies. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Penetration (Ex): The swarm attack of a shredstorm is

treated as an adamantine magic weapon for the purpose of

overcoming  damage  reduction,  and  it  strikes  incorporeal

creatures as a magic weapon does. When striking an object,

a shredstorm ignores any hardness less than 20.

CONSTRUCTION

Creating  the  body  of  a  shredstorm  costs  15,000  gp

for  the  adamantine  blades.  A  successful  DC  25  Craft

(weapon smithing) check is required to forge the blades

from raw metal.

CL 13th; Craft Construct,  y, geas/quest, greater magic weapon,

lightning bolt, limited wish, caster must be at least 13th level;

Price 85,000 gp; Cost 50,000 gp + 2,800 XP.

SHRIEKING TERROR

This creature looks like a nightmarish flying starfish. Five necks

radiate out from a central core capped with wings. At the end of

each neck is a hideously distorted humanlike head with scaly skin.

The eyes in these heads burn with a menacing green flame.

Shrieking  terrors  originated  as  magically  mutated  var-

gouilles crossbred with hydras. These horrors possess the

worst aspects of each parent creature, making them a hearty,

multiheaded  terror  equipped  with  the  vargouilles  special

attacks.  Created  for  war  and  destruction,  these  monsters

vigorously attack most creatures not native to Carceri. They

have been known to act as advance troops for demodands in

some of the many con icts on Carceri.

Some vargouilles view these twisted creatures as repug-

nant abominations and attack them unmercifully if given a

chance. Others revere them, almost

to the point of worship.

Each of a shrieking terrors

heads is slightly larger than a

human head, about 18 inches across.

The monsters features hint at a reptili-

an heritage. The central wings span

nearly 8 feet. A shrieking terror

weighs about 200 pounds.

Shrieking terrors speak Infernal.

COMBAT

A  shrieking  terror  generally  be-

gins  combat  by  using  its  shriek

ability. It then selects a paralyzed

foe as its  rst victim, and one or

two heads kiss it while the other

three or four either attack any ac-

tive  foes  that  come  near,  or  use  their

shriek ability defensively.

A  shrieking  terror  can  be  killed  by

severing  all  its  heads  or  by  slaying  its

body.  To  sever  a  head,  an  opponent  must

make a successful sunder attempt with a slash-

ing weapon. (The player should declare where

the attack is aimed, either at the body or at a

head, before making the attack roll.) An op-

ponent can strike at a shrieking terrors

heads from any position in which

he  could  strike  at  the  shriek-

ing  terrors  body,  because  the

monsters  heads  writhe  and

whip  about  during  combat.  An

opponent  can  ready  an  action  to

attempt to sunder a shrieking ter-

rors head when the creature bites at him.

Each of a shrieking terrors heads has hit points equal

to the creatures full normal hit point total divided by 10.

For  example,  if  a  shrieking  terror  has  97  hit  points,  9  or

more points of damage severs a head (97  10 = 9.7, rounded

down to 9). Losing a head deals damage to the body equal

to the heads full normal hit points. After a head is severed,

a natural re ex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood

loss. A shrieking terror can no longer attack with a severed

head but takes no other penalties.

Each time a head is severed, two new heads spring from

the  stump  in  1d4  rounds.  A  shrieking  terror  can  never

have more than ten heads at any one time, and any extra

heads it gains beyond its original number wither and die

within  a  day.  To  prevent  the  stump  from  growing  two

new heads, at least 5 points of  re or acid damage must be

dealt to the stump (requiring a touch attack to hit) before

the  new  heads  appear.  A  flaming  weapon  (or  similar

effect) deals its energy damage to the stump in the same

blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid damage from

an area effect (such as a  reball spell or dragon breath) may

burn multiple stumps in addition to

dealing  damage  to  the  shrieking

terrors body. A shrieking terror

does  not  die  from  losing  its

heads until all its heads have

been cut off and the stumps

seared by  re or acid.

Shrieking terror

A  shrieking  terrors

body  can  be  slain  just  like

any  other  creatures,  but

shrieking  terrors  possess

fast  healing  and  are  difficult  to

defeat  in  this  fashion.  Any  attack

that is not (or cannot be) an attempt

to sunder a head affects the body. For

example,  area  effects  deal  damage

to  a  shrieking  terrors  body,

not  to  its  heads.  Targeted

magical  effects  cannot

sever  a  shrieking  terrors

heads  (and  thus  must  be

directed  at  the  body)  unless

they  deal  slashing  damage

and  could  be  used  to  make

sunder attempts.

Kiss  (Su):  Each  head  of  a  shrieking

terror can kiss a paralyzed target with a suc-

cessful melee touch attack (attack bonus +12).

An  affected  opponent  must  succeed  on

a DC 23 Fortitude save or begin a ter-

rible  transformation  that  turns  the

creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often

much  sooner;  roll  1d6  separately  for  each  phase  of  the

transformation).  First,  over  a  period  of  1d6  hours,  all  the

victims hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter,

the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the

chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs.

During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes 1 point of Intel-

ligence drain and 1 point of Charisma drain per hour (to a

minimum score of 3 in each ability).

The  transformation  is  complete  1d6  hours  later,  when

the head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and

becomes  a  vargouille.  This  transformation  is  interrupted

by sunlight, and even a daylight spell can delay death, but

to reverse the transformation requires a remove disease spell

or similar effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and

includes a +4 racial bonus.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 19 or be unable to

heal the shrieking terrors bite damage naturally or magi-

cally. A neutralize poison or heal spell removes the effect,

while delay poison allows magical healing. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Pounce (Ex): If a shrieking terror moves or charges a foe

in a round, it can still make a full attack with all its heads at

no penalty.

Shriek  (Su):  As  a  full-round  action,  a  shrieking  terror

can open its distended mouths and let out a terrible sound.

Anyone within 60 feet (except other shrieking terrors and

vargouilles)  that  hears  this  shriek  and  can  clearly  see  the

creature must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be para-

lyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks

the target, moves out of range, or blocks the targets line of

sight to it. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the shriek-

ing  terrors  kiss  (see  above).  A  creature  that  successfully

saves cannot be affected again by the same terrors shriek for

24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save

DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus for

each of its heads. (If a shrieking terror gains or loses heads,

the save DC changes accordingly.)

Skills: A shrieking terror has a +2 racial bonus on Listen

checks and Spot checks, thanks to its multiple heads. (This

bonus is negated if the creature is reduced to one head.)

TEN-HEADED TERROR

Thankfully  rare  in  the  extreme,  solitary  ten-headed

shrieking terrors have been reported by planar travelers.

A ten-headed terror has a wingspan of 16 feet and weighs

1,600 pounds.

Combat

A ten-headed shrieking terror has a particularly nasty series

of bite attacks, but its combat tactics are identical to the  ve-

headed terror.

Kiss (Su): The save DC against a ten-headed-terrors kiss

attack is 28.

Poison  (Ex):  The  save  DC  against  a  ten-headed  terrors

poison is 24.

Shriek (Su): The save DC against a ten-headed terrors

shriek is 34, including a +1 racial bonus for each of its

ten heads.

SHRIEKING TERRORS IN EBERRON

To create these unspeakable horrors, mind  ayer wizards

captured vargouilles and hydras from Eberron and warped

them into a single species on their home plane of Xoriat.

The shrieking terrors were then released back into Eberrons

ecology. Shrieking terrors are found in the dark caverns

of Khyber, usually accompanied by mobs of sycophantic

vargouilles eager to undergo similar transformation.

SIEGE CRAB

This massive crablike creature has four large pincers and six seg-

mented legs. Its bright blue shell is covered with strange, glowing

runes, and a round hatch is visible on the crustaceans underbelly.

The siege crab is a titanic crustacean that

has been warped into a living amphibi-

ous  war  machine  by  powerful  magic

and  skilled  surgery.  Kuo-toa  clerics  and  wiz-

ards cooperated to  rst create them centuries ago,

though  reports  exist  of  sahuagin  and  lo-

cathah warbands using siege crabs to

raid surface settlements as well.

Siege  crabs  are  mutated  from

normal  crabs  in  a  process  that

takes decades. Each creature is

magically  bonded  to  a  coral

circlet,  the  wearer  of  which

has  absolute  command  over

that  siege  crab  and  can  give  it

direct verbal commands. The crab

obeys these orders to the best of its

ability, but unlike a construct it cannot

be  given  conditional  instructions  or  programs.

The creature can only follow direct orders and is

usually commanded to simply stand still if the con-

troller needs to leave the crabs immediate vicinity.

A siege crab is almost 20 feet in diameter, stands

15 feet tall, and weighs over 30 tons. A siege crab

does not speak but can understand simple instruc-

tions  in  any  language  given  by  the  bearer  of  its

coral circlet.

COMBAT

As their name implies, siege crabs are employed to attack

coastal or underwater cities. In battle eld engagements, a

siege crabs controller moves it directly through ranks of

smaller creatures, using it to swiftly destroy enemy war

machines and forti cations. The siege crabs claws make

quick work of most masonry; once the city walls fall, the

crab  disgorges  any  troops  it  carries  into  the  settlements

interior. After achieving its primary mission, the crab obeys

its  controllers  next  orderusually  to  turn  and  obliterate

any defensive troops within sight.

Constrict (Ex): A siege crab deals automatic claw damage

on a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a siege crab must

hit an opponent at least three sizes smaller than itself with

a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins

the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict on

subsequent rounds. (A siege crab can grapple foes of larger

size than indicated above, but not without provoking attacks

of opportunity.)

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  half  DC  30.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Force  Carapace  (Su):  The  runes  inscribed  in  a  siege

crabs shell project a  eld of force around the creature at all

156

Siege crab

times. While its force carapace is active, a crab gains a +10

de ection bonus to Armor Class, a +8 resistance bonus on

all saving throws, and immunity to magic missile spells and

effects.  All  creatures  riding  within  the  crabs

compartment  gain  the  same  bene ts  with  re-

gard to attacks originating outside the crab.

The  physical  attacks  of  incorporeal  crea-

tures  cannot  bypass  the  force  carapace,

nor  can  such  creatures  pass  through

the  crabs  shell  to  enter  or  exit  the

inner chamber. The siege crabs claw

attacks are considered force effects

and can strike incorporeal crea-

tures  normally  while  the  force

carapace is in effect.

The force carapace is essentially

a magic item crafted from the

shell of the living creature. A

dispel  magic  effect  targeting  a

siege crab can suppress its force

carapace for 1d4 rounds. Morden-

kainens  disjunction  or  any  other

effect that destroys magic items can

permanently dispel a carapace.

CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, protec-

tion from spells, shield, wall of force. Price 200,000

gp; Cost 100,000 gp + 8,000 XP.

Shielded  Compartment  (Ex):  Much  of  the

interior tissue of a siege crab has been surgical-

ly removed and replaced with a sealed compart-

ment for passengers or cargo. The compartment

is accessed by a ventral hatch, and is air- and watertight.

Water-breathing creatures using a siege crab can  ood the

compartment with seawater, while air-breathing creatures

keep  the  chamber  lled  with  air.  The  passenger  space  is

about 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet; it can hold 1 Large crea-

ture or 4 Medium or Small creatures.

Creatures  riding  within  a  siege  crabs  inner  chamber

have  cover  and  concealment  from  opponents  outside

the crab when the hatch is open. While it is sealed, they

instead have total cover and total concealment. The hatch

is  10  feet  in  diameter,  and  the  chambers  occupants  can

make ranged attacks from within the crab while it is open.

Opening or closing the hatch is a standard action for an

adjacent creature.

The death of a siege crab does not compromise the cover

or  concealment  of  passengers  within  its  shell.  However,

since  the  crabs  death  usually  results  in  it  collapsing  on

its  belly,  it  is  dif cult  for  occupants  to  exit  through  the

hatch. Creatures trapped within the crabs carcass must cut

through the tough carapace to escape; the shell has hardness

15, and breaking through it requires dealing it 30 points of

damage from a slashing weapon.

Skills: A siege crab has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.

It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

GREATER SIEGE CRAB

Greater siege crabs are almost 30 feet in diameter, stand 20

feet tall, and weigh over 130 tons.

Combat

A greater siege crab is simply a larger version of an ordinary

siege crab.

Trample  (Ex):  Reflex  half  DC  40.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

Shielded Compartment (Ex): A greater siege crabs pas-

senger space is about 10 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet; it can hold

4 Large creatures or 16 Medium or Small creatures.

CORAL CIRCLET

A coral circlet is a simple headpiece that allows the wearer

to control a single speci c siege crab. The wearer can give

the crustacean commands whenever the crab is within 120

feet, which the crab carries out to the best of its ability. By

closing his or her eyes, the wearer can see through the crabs

eyestalks, allowing him or her a clear view of the battle eld

even  if  the  wearer  is  entirely  enclosed  within  the  crabs

hollow abdomen.

If the wearer of the circlet is located within the siege crabs

shielded compartment, any spell he or she casts (except those

with a range of personal or touch) can be targeted as if the

spell  was  originating  from  the  crab  itself.  For  example,  a

wizard  within  the  compartment  could  cast  a  meteor  swarm

that originated from the crabs claw rather than the casters

own hand. This does not require an action on the crabs part.

SIEGE CRABS IN EBERRON

Siege  crabs  are  reportedly  the  creation  of  a  storm  giant

wizard who lives deep in the Thunder Sea. These mammoth

crabs have attacked ships crossing the Thunder Sea, ravaged

miles of coastline on both Khorvaire and Xendrik, and even

preyed upon the sahuagin of Shargons Teeth. A siege crab

that attacked the city of Stormreach disgorged four chuuls

before  retreating  back  into  the  sea.  The  chuuls  were  all

slain by the citys defenders, and no other siege crabs have

attacked Stormreach since.

SIEGE CRABS IN FAERN

Siege crabs  rst appeared during the Tenth Sers War in 720

DR, when a sahuagin princess named Trysskar received a

vision from the god Sekolah prompting her to attack Myth

Nantar. Sahuagin raiding parties used siege crabs to destroy

as  much  of  Myth  Nantar  as  possible  before  emerging  to

slaughter the citys merfolk and aquatic elf guardians. The

sahuagin  used  siege  crabs  again  throughout  the  Twelfth

Sers War, mainly to hold merfolk, shalarin, and aquatic elf

cities conquered by their king, Iakhovas.

This  powerful  humanoid

stands over 9 feet tall and

has a bestial face vaguely

reminiscent  of  a  lizards.

Its  skin  is  covered  with

patches of a strangely

morphic  carapacea

constantly  moving  and

faintly iridescent shell that

covers its shoulders, torso, and

upper  thighs.  The  creature  has  thick

forelimbs  that  curve  slightly  away  from

its  body.  The  creature  looks  like  a  cross

between a giant, a lizard, and an ape.

COMBAT

A  skindancer  enters  combat  fearlessly,  con dent  that  its

magical, ever-shifting skin will protect it against whatever

weapons its opponents bring to bear.

Trip (Ex): A skindancer that hits with a slam attack can

attempt to trip its opponent (+10 check modi er) as a free

action without making a touch attack or provoking attacks

of  opportunity.  If  the  attempt  fails,  the  opponent  cannot

react to trip the skindancer.

Adaptive Energy Resistance (Su): A skindancer gains

resistance to energy based on the last type of energy that

dealt  damage  to  it.  If  the  last  type  of  energy  was  acid,  it

gains  resistance  to  acid  20.  If  the  last  type  of  energy  was

 re, it gains resistance to  re 20, and so on. This resistance

to energy lasts for 1 minute or until another type of energy

damages the skindancer.

In most instances, a skindancer does not have

resistance to energy at the beginning

of combat.

Damage  Reduction

(Su):  A  skindancer  gains

damage  reduction  based

on the damage type of the

last  weapon  that  damaged  it.

If  the  last  weapon  that  dam-

aged  it  was  a  piercing  weapon,

it  gains  damage  reduction  15/

bludgeoning  or  slashing.  If  the

last  weapon  that  damaged

it  was  a  slashing  weapon,

it gains damage reduction

15/piercing  or  bludgeon-

ing.  If  the  last  weapon

that  damaged  it  was  a

bludgeoning and piercing

weapon,  it  gains  damage

reduction  15/slashing.  This

damage reduction lasts for

1 minute or until another

type  of  weapon  damages

the skindancer.

In  most  instances,  a

skindancer  does  not  have  damage

reduction at the beginning of combat.

Reactive  Skin  (Su):  The  magical  energy

that  suffuses  a  skindancers  skin  can  turn  away

attacks before they even touch the creature. This

energy grants a skindancer a +6 de ection bonus

Skindancer

Born  of  arcane  experiments

into the changeable nature of life,

the skindancer perpetuates a perversion

of  eldritch  magic.  This  strange  creature  has

prodigious defensive abilities, and many theo-

rize that skindancers were created to serve as

guardians for arcane spellcasters.

Although it is not a shapechanger, a skindancers  esh is

highly reactive to weapons and spell attacks. The thick pro-

trusions that cover a skindancers upper body look like a hard

carapace, but in truth they shift in shape and consistency to

best resist any attack that is used against it. A skindancer

stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.

Skindancers speak Common.

to Armor Class.

SKINDANCERS IN EBERRON

Skindancers inhabit caves throughout Khorvaire, although

they are a particular bane to the dwarves of the Mror Holds.

An  enormous  skindancer  known  only  as  Glamerskin

threatens  the  dwarf  enclave  of  Eigendor,  and  so  far,  no

champion or concerted assault has succeeded in disposing

of the creature.

Level Adjustment: 

This massive automaton resembles a six-legged stone cat. Four

huge, hammerlike arms jut from its front two pairs of shoulders,

and it has a low, squat build.

Among the most powerful of constructs, the slaughterstone

behemoth  is  one  of  the  deadliest  expressions  of  dwarven

ingenuity  and  magical  power.  Shaped  from  a  pure  block

of  stone,  the  behemoth  is  a  terror  on  the  battle eld,  able

to  literally  bowl  over  hordes  of  lesser  troops.  Although

originally designed by dwarves, the secrets of the creation

of slaughterstone constructs have spread to other races, and

characters are much more likely to face one as a foe than to

have a chance to  ght beside one.

A slaughterstone behemoth has the same overall bulk as an

elephant, although its proportionally shorter and broader in

stature. It has four thick arms, one pair of which extends from

each of the  rst two sets of the behemoths shoulders.

Slaughterstone  behemoths  cannot  speak  or  make  any

vocal noise, nor do they have any distinguishable odor.

COMBAT

A  slaughterstone  behemoth  approaches  combat  with  the

uncaring and brutal precision that most constructs exhibit.

When confronted with large groups of foes, a behemoth wades

in to trample when appropriate and  ails away with its limbs.

Like its smaller counterpart, the slaughterstone eviscera-

tor (see the next page), a behemoth has no ranged combat

capability and is at the mercy of highly mobile groups with

powerful ranged attacks. For this reason, dwarves and other

races  that  employ  slaugtherstone  behemoths  usually  sup-

port them with powerful archers or spellcasters capable of

striking down foes determined to  ght from a distance.

Dazing Blow (Ex): Any creature struck by a slaughter-

stone behemoth must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or

be dazed for 1 round. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

Thunder Step (Ex): The ponderous steps of a slaughter-

stone behemoth shake the very earth. Any creature within

5  feet  of  a  slaughterstone  behemoth  when  it  moves  must

succeed on a DC 24 Re ex save or fall prone. The save DC is

Wisdom-based.

Trample (Ex): Re ex half DC 37. The save DC is Strength-

based.

Tunnel Fighting (Ex): A slaughterstone behemoth has

a limited ability to reshape its form to  t into a tight area. It

does not take a penalty on attack rolls or to Armor Class

when squeezing through a tight space. See page 29 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide for more information on squeezing

through tight spaces.

CONSTRUCTION

A slaughterstone behemoths body is chiseled from a single

block of hard stone, much like the body of a stone golem.

The  behemoth  weighs  at  least  10,000  pounds.  The  stone

must be of exceptional quality and costs 10,000 gp. Assem-

bling the body requires a DC 25 Craft (sculpting) check or a

DC 25 Craft (stonemasonry) check.

port  this  stone  automatons

thick,  insectoid  body,  which  is

wider  and  lower  to  the  ground

than  a  horses.  The  creatures

stable  bulk  supports  four  ser-

rated  blade-arms  that  whirl

around with vicious speed.

Slaughterstone eviscerator

Slaughterstone eviscerators were originally built

by dwarves to defend their strongholds; now,

other underground races have started to build

their own versions of this deadly construct. Made for war, a

slaughterstone eviscerator has powerful blade-arms capable

of tearing through hordes of foes.

A slaughterstone eviscerators blades are of a size compa-

rable to Large greatswords.

Slaughterstone  eviscerators  cannot  speak  or  make  any

vocal noise, nor do they have any distinguishable odor.

COMBAT

A slaughterstone eviscerator approaches combat with the

uncaring and brutal precision that most constructs exhibit.

When confronted with a large group of foes, an eviscerator

uses its enhanced mobility to move toward the largest con-

centration of foes that it can reach and cut them down.

Lacking ranged attacks itself, a slaughterstone eviscerator

is at the mercy of highly mobile groups with powerful ranged

160

attacks. For this reason, dwarves and other races that employ

slaugtherstone  eviscerators  usually  support  them  with  a

number of archers or spellcasters capable of striking down

foes determined to  ght from a distance.

Augment Critical (Ex): A slaughterstone eviscerators

adamantine  blades  are  magically  hardened  and  honed  to  a

razors edge. They threaten a critical hit on a natural attack

roll of 1820, dealing triple damage on a successful critical

hit. The blades are not subject to effects such as keen edge that

would further improve their threat range.

Enhanced  Mobility  (Ex):  A  slaughterstone  evis-

cerator can move up to 15 feet in a round and still make a

full attack.

Tunnel  Fighting  (Ex):  A  slaughterstone  eviscerator  has

a limited ability to reshape its form to  t into a tight area. It

does not take a penalty on attack rolls or to Armor Class when

squeezing through a tight space. See page 29 of the Dungeon

Masters  Guide  for  more  information  on  squeezing  through

tight spaces.

CONSTRUCTION

A slaughterstone eviscerators body is chiseled from

a single block of stone, much like the body of a stone

golem.  The  eviscerator  weighs  at  least  3,000

pounds.  The  stone  must  be  of

exceptional  quality  and  costs

7,500 gp. Assembling the body

requires  a  DC  20  Craft  (sculpting)

check  or  a  DC  20  Craft  (stone-

masonry)  check.  Creating  an

eviscerator also requires four

Large  +2  adamantine  great-

swords.  These  swords  are  for-

ever  melded  into  the  form  of

the eviscerator and are destroyed

if it is.

CL 16th; Craft Construct,

SLAUGHTERSTONE CONSTRUCTS

IN EBERRON

Slaughterstone  behemoths  (see  page  159)  and  slaughter-

stone  eviscerators  protect  the  cities,  strongholds,  and

necropolises  of  the  Mror  Holds.  House  Kundarak  also

uses them as guardians in their great banks. The massive

slaughterstone  behemoth  that  stands  guard  inside  the

Kundarak Bank of Sharn is one of the citys most popular

tourist attractions.

SLAUGHTERSTONE CONSTRUCTS

IN FAERN

Slaughterstone behemoths (see page 159) and slaughterstone

eviscerators guard the kingdoms of the gold dwarves. The

Level Adjustment: 

What at first appeared to be just a bank of snow is in fact a lacy,

delicate-looking  creature  resembling  an  enormous  snowflake

with a complex structure.

One  of  the  most  attractive  of  oozes,  the  snow ake  ooze

inhabits cold climates and the depths of caves or tunnels

where natural ice can be found. It slowly moves around the

area, seeking warm-blooded creatures to freeze.

A snow ake ooze can grow to a diameter of about 10 feet

and a thickness of about 4 inches, but it can compress its

body to  t through cracks as small as 1 inch wide. A typical

specimen weighs about 250 pounds.

COMBAT

A snow ake ooze uses straightforward tactics, attempting

to grab and constrict prey.

Constrict  (Ex):  A  snowflake  ooze  deals  automatic

slam  damage  and  cold  damage  with  a  successful

grapple check.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  snow ake

ooze must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can constrict.

Airy (Ex): Since a snow ake oozes physiology is made

up of a little ooze and lots of empty space, it is dif cult to

know where to attack. Any piercing melee or ranged attack

directed  at  it  has  a  20%  miss  chance  (the  blow  or  missile

just passes harmlessly through the creatures space). Even a

true seeing effect is useless in determining where and how to

strike the creature.

Cold  Aura  (Ex):  A  snow ake  ooze  exudes  cold.  Any

creature  within  5  feet  of  one  takes  1d6  points  of  cold

damage (DC 18 Fortitude half). The save DC is Constitu-

tion-based.

Split (Ex): Bludgeoning weapons deal no damage to a

snowflake ooze. Instead, the creature fractures into two

identical snow ake oozes, each with half of the originals

current hit points (round down). A snow ake ooze with 10

hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced

to 0 hit points.

Skills: A snow ake ooze has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check,

even if rushed or threatened. *When in an area containing

snow or ice, a snow ake ooze gains a +12 racial bonus on

Hide checks.

SNOWFLAKE OOZES IN EBERRON

Snow ake  oozes  inhabit  the  mountains  and  vales  of  the

Mror Holds, northern Karrnath, and the northern main-

land  of  the  Lhazaar  Principalities.  Rumor  has  it  that  the

lich queens blisteringly cold island called Farlnen (located

in  the  Lhazaar  Sea),  plays  host  to  several  dozen  of  these

creatures. Larger specimens prey on visitors to the Tashana

Tundra (on Sarlona) and the Frostfell.

SNOWFLAKE OOZES IN FAERN

Snow ake oozes plague travelers as far west as Icewind Dale

and as far east as Narfell. They are also known to inhabit

caverns that doubly serve as white dragon lairs.

SPELLWARPED CREATURE

Spellwarped creatures have been tainted by powerful magic.

Long  ago,  powerful  spellcasters  infused  magic  into  the

bodies  of  many  creatures,  seeking  to  make  them  stronger,

tougher, and more tractable. The magic used in this process

changed the nature of the affected creatures. These changes

were  irreversible,  and  the  changes  bred  true  as  the  crea-

tures  matured  and  produced  offspring  of  their  own.  The

process was a partial success, and the creatures did indeed

grow  stronger  and  faster  than  normal  creatures  of  their

kind. The creatures invariably proved unruly, however, and

they seemed more clever and quick-thinking than others of

their type. In addition, the creatures gained a strange and

alien mind-set, reacting to many situations in unusual but

cunning ways.

SAMPLE SPELLWARPED CREATURE

This example uses an ettin as the base creature.

A spellwarped ettin has the vicious, unpredictable tem-

perament of an ordinary ettin combined with the twisted

outlook  common  to  all  spellwarped  creatures.  Its  two

heads  make  the  creature  exceptionally  sharp-eyed  and

alert.  Those  few  strong  enough  and  careful  enough  to

control  such  a  creature  find  that  it  makes  an  excellent

guardian or scout.

Like its normal kindred, a spellwarped ettin never bathes

if it can help it, leaving the creature so grimy and dirty that

its skin resembles a thick gray hide. An adult spellwarped

ettin is about 11 feet tall, but it is so bent and stooped that

were it to stand completely upright, it would gain a foot or

two  in  height.  A  typical  creature  weighs  5,200  pounds  or

more and lives up to 125 years.

A spellwarped ettin speaks Common and Giant. Spell-

warped ettins also speak pidgin Orc and Goblin, and can

usually  communicate  their  wishes  to  those  who  speak

those languages.

This hulking giant has two heads, each visage warped and twisted

by some strange force. Its heads bear hideous porcine features,

but the strange distortion makes the creature disconcerting to

look upon. The creatures shovellike jaws have protruding lower

canines  like  a  boars  tusks.  The  creatures  skin  is  covered  in

patchy scales and fur, and its limbs look twisted and warped like

its facial features. This warping gives the creature a stooped look,

yet it moves with apparent agility and an obvious strength.

COMBAT

Spellwarped ettins are cunning, dangerous  ghters. They

prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a

straight  ght, but once battle has started, a spellwarped

ettin  fights  furiously  until  all  of  its  enemies  are  dead.

When possible, a spellwarped ettin closes with spellcasters,

attempting to force them to cast spells at it so it can absorb

the spell energy.

When it absorbs spell energy, it typically uses the energy to

 rst increase its Constitution, then its Strength, and  nally

it gains hit points from any other spell energy absorbed. If

hard-pressed and fortunate enough to absorb a spell, a spell-

warped ettin will use the energy to increase its base speed

and then  ee.

Spell Absorption (Su): Whenever a spell fails to pen-

etrate a spellwarped ettins spell resistance, the creature

gains one of the following bene ts, chosen at the time that

the spell effect is resolved.

Might:  The  spellwarped  ettin  gains  a  +4  enhancement

bonus to Strength for 1 minute.

Agility:  The  spellwarped  ettin  gains  a  +4  enhancement

bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute.

Endurance: The spellwarped ettin gains a +4 enhancement

bonus to Constitution for 1 minute.

Life:  The  spellwarped  ettin  gains  temporary  hit  points

equal to 5  the level of the failed spell.

Speed: The spellwarped ettins base speed increases by a

number of feet equal to 5  the level of the failed spell.

Resistance:  The  spellwarped  ettin  gains  resistance  10  to

one energy type (acid, cold, electricity,  re, or sonic).

Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex): A spellwarped

ettin  ghts with a morningstar or a javelin in each hand.

Because each of its two heads controls an arm, a spellwarped

ettin does not take a penalty on attack rolls or damage rolls

for attacking with two weapons.

Skills: A spellwarped ettins two heads give it a +2 racial

bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks.

CREATING A

SPELLWARPED CREATURE

Spellwarped  is  an  inherited  template  that  can  be

added to any corporeal aberration, animal, dragon,

fey,  giant,  humanoid,  magical  beast,  monstrous

humanoid, plant, or vermin (referred to hereafter

as the base creature).

A spellwarped creature uses all the base creatures

statistics and abilities except as noted here.

Size  and  Type:  The  creatures  type

changes  to  aberration.  Do  not  recalculate

the creatures Hit Dice, base attack bonus,

saves, or skill points if its type changes. The

creature  gains  the  augmented  subtype  if

necessary. Size is unchanged.

Armor  Class:  Natural  armor  bonus  im-

proves by 2 (this stacks with any natural ar-

mor bonus the base creature has).

Special  Qualities:  A  spellwarped  crea-

ture has all the special qualities of the base

creature, plus the following special qualities.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A spellwarped creature

gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its Hit Dice. If

the creature already has spell resistance, use the

greater of the two values.

Spell  Absorption  (Su):  Whenever  a  spell  fails  to

penetrate a spellwarped creatures spell resistance,

the creature gains one of the following bene ts,

chosen at the time that the spell resolves.

Might:  The  spellwarped  creature  gains  a  +4

enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 minute.

Agility:  The  spellwarped  creature  gains  a  +4

enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute.

Endurance:  The  spellwarped  creature  gains  a  +4

enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute.

Life: The spellwarped creature gains temporary hit points

equal to 5  the level of the failed spell.

Speed: The spellwarped creatures base speed increases by

a number of feet equal to 5  the level of the failed spell.

SPELLWARPED

CREATURES IN EBERRON

Long  before  humans  walked  Eberron,  dragon  sorcerers

experimented on various lesser creatures in a vain attempt

to  improve  upon  them.  The  dragons  pitted  their  spell-

warped creations against each other in battle, mostly for

their mutual amusement. After centuries of experimenta-

tion, they grew bored with the exercise and became more

Spellwarped ettin

immersed in the draconic Prophecies. Many

of  their  spellwarped  creations  survived  the  ages  and  con-

tinue to inhabit Eberron to this day, although few have any

recollection of their true origins.

The  giants  of  Xendrik  learned  the  secrets  of  creating

spellwarped  creatures  from  the  dragons  and  revived  the

arcane  practice,  creating  spellwarped  elves,  orcs,  ettins,

and  even  more  monstrous  creatures.  Many  spellwarped

creatures that once served the giants as slaves now haunt the

ruins of the giants shattered civilization.

SPELLWARPED

CREATURES IN FAERN

The origin of spellwarped creatures can be traced back to

Netheril, possibly back to the Nether Scrolls themselves.

Netherese  wizards  worked  their  spellwarped  creations

into the armies of the day, even putting them to use defend-

ing cities against the phaerimm onslaught. Explorations of

Netherils ancient ruins enabled the Red Wizards of Thay

to unlock the secrets of creating spellwarped creatures, and

new variations have begun to emerge from the Thaymount

to perform the Red Wizards bidding.

SPLINTERWAIF

This frightfully thin humanoid has long, pointed fingers and a

forest of razor-sharp wooden spines for hair. Its tongue is overly

long and studded with wooden splinters and barbs. Its thick skin

has a barklike texture and patches of thorns jutting from it, and

its black eyes dart about wildly.

Unlike most fey, who are most at home in

the  wilderness,  the  sinister  splinter-

waif  lurks  in  the  narrow  alleyways

and tangled slums of large cities. As

long  as  its  environment  contains

large  amounts  of  old  weathered

wood in which to hide and a fair

amount of young children to catch,

transform, and eat, a splinterwaif

is happy.

Splinterwaifs are masters of cam-

ou age,  and  they  are  rarely  seen  except  by

their victims. A splinterwaif moves with

remarkable speed, clambering up verti-

cal surfaces with ease. A splinterwaif

appears super cially like a thin, lithe

humanoid. Its skin can change between

a multitude of colors. Thorns jut from the

skin, some dropping off while others rap-

idly grow to replace those that have fall-

en away. A typical splinterwaif is 5 feet

tall and weighs about 70 pounds.

Splinterwaifs speak Sylvan.

Splinterwaif

Splinterwaifs  lie  in  wait  in  piles  of  discarded  lumber,

ramshackle  buildings,  or  decommissioned  ships,  attack-

ing with surprise and sneak attacks. While they are rather

adroit with their claws, their favorite attack is to spit a long,

thin wooden splinter at a target from hiding. When forced

into physical combat, a splinterwaif is somewhat cowardly

and tries to escape so it can stalk its prey and attack later on

its own terms.

Call Brambles (Su): As a standard action, a splinterwaif

can cause a thorny branch to grow out of any nonmagi-

cal wooden surface within 30 feet. Treat this branch as a

Medium animated object with a speed of 0 feet and the con-

strict exceptional ability. Splinterwaifs are fond of creating

animated brambles to help  ank opponents or to hold them

immobile for sneak attacks. Controlling an animated bramble

is a free action. A splinterwaif can animate and control only

one bramble at a time.

Camou  age (Su): A splinterwaifs skin changes color to

match its surroundings. Doing this requires a full-round

action on the part of the splinterwaif and grants it a +10

circumstance bonus on Hide checks. While camou aged,

a splinterwaif also gains concealment. As soon as the splin-

terwaif moves or attacks, it loses these bene ts until it takes

another full-round action to camou age again.

Sneak Attack (Ex): A splinterwaif can sneak attack as a

rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage on a successful

164

sneak attack. As a splinterwaif advances in Hit Dice, its sneak

attack ability improves. A splinterwaif with 4 or 5 Hit Dice

deals an extra 3d6 points of damage with a successful sneak

attack, while a splinterwaif with 6 Hit Dice deals an extra 4d6

points of damage with a successful sneak attack.

Splinterspit (Su): A splinterwaif can spit a splin-

ter of wood at a foe as a ranged attack with

a range increment of 30 feet. The act

of spitting a splinter provokes attacks

of  opportunity  from  any  creatures

that  threaten  the  splinterwaif.  A

hiding  splinterwaif  can  attempt  to

snipe  at  targets  with  its  splinter  spit

attack  by  taking  a  move  action  to  im-

mediately  hide  after  making  a  ranged

attack. It takes a 20 circumstance pen-

alty on its Hide check to conceal itself af-

ter the shot. As long as the target is within

30 feet and unaware of the splinterwaifs po-

sition, the splinterwaif can take full ad-

vantage of its sneak attack with this

ranged weapon.

Superior Woodland Stride (Su):

A splinterwaif can move through nat-

ural  thorns,  briars,  overgrown  ar-

eas, and similar terrain at its normal

speed without taking damage or suffer-

ing  other  impairment.  This  includes

thorns,  briars,  and  overgrown  areas  that

are magically manipulated to impede motion.

Transformation  (Su):  A  splinterwaif  can

transform a dead humanoid or fey into a Medium

thorny bush at will. Doing this requires a full minute of con-

centration; if the splinterwaif is interrupted during this time,

it must start the transformation over from the beginning. A

transformed body does not radiate magic, and is treated as

a normal plant. Creatures that have been transformed into

plants in this manner cannot be restored to life via raise dead

or resurrection, although true resurrection, miracle, or wish can

revive a dead character.

Skills:  A  splinterwaif  has  a  +10  racial  bonus  on  Hide

checks. It also has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and

can  always  choose  to  take  10  on  a  Climb  check,  even  if

rushed or threatened.

SPLINTERWAIF KNAVE

Splinterwaif knaves have adapted fully to their urban sur-

roundings and display an uncanny knack for survival. They

are  the  most  vicious  and  cruel  of  their  kind.  Some  lead

bands  of  weaker  splinterwaifs,  while  others  are  solitary

hermits who despise all others, including their own kin.

Combat

A splinterwaif knave likes to make ranged sneak attacks using

its splinterspit ability. If it cant kill its mark quickly, it withdraws

and seeks out easier prey. A knave accompanied by weaker splin-

terwaifs doesnt  ee as quickly, rushing into melee if it sees an

opportunity to  ank a foe and make sneak attacks.

SPLINTERWAIF SOCIETY

No  one  is  sure  how  splinterwaifs  originated;  the  most

popular  theory  is  that  they  are  little  more  than  insane

dryads  that  somehow  managed  to  survive  the  harvest-

ing of their chosen trees. It is said the act of harvesting

her tree forces a dryad into a state of incorporeal hiber-

nation,  during  which  she  transforms  and  twists  into  a

mockery of her former self. Once her tree is converted

to lumber and used to build ships, houses, or fences, she

awakens and lays claim to the region into which she has

been transplanted.

This theory starts to break down upon close examination.

For example, splinterwaifs dont seem to exhibit any particu-

lar symbiotic attachment to anything in their environment,

and they are not bound to speci c regions. Indeed, splinter-

waifs are often unknowingly transported to new cities when

they stow away on ships.

A  splinterwaifs  lair  is  hard  to  detect,  but  one  sure

sign of splinterwaif activity is a predominance of small,

thorny shrubs in a vacant lot or lumberyard. These shrubs

invariably  turn  out  to  be  the  bodies  of  people  the  local

splinterwaifs  have  captured,  killed,  and  transformed.

Splinter waifs  are  careful  to  gather  these  victims  from

random locations throughout the city, and they tend to

focus  on  orphans  or  other  children  who  wont  particu-

larly be missed. Splinterwaifs have a singularly horrible

reason for transforming the bodies of those they capture

and killthey relish the taste of slain children who have

been  transformed  into  dry  thorny  shrubs.  Sometimes

splinterwaifs  are  forced  to  kill  adults.  They  transform

these victims into shrubbery as well, if only to disguise

the dead bodies. Splinterwaifs find transformed adults to

be sour and unpalatable, however, so the shrubs of adult

victims tend to accumulate over time and mark a region

as  one  of  splinterwaif  activity.  Curiously,  splinterwaifs

loathe  destroying  these  shrubs,  and  once  they  become

too  dense  or  obviously  denote  an  area  as  a  splinterwaif

lair, the creatures simply move on to a new home rather

than destroy the shrubs.

This creature is an elongated, snakelike dragon. Its scales are pat-

terned in vivid green and black diamonds. The fangs protruding

from its great jaw drip viscous fluid.

Just  as  yuan-ti  are  descended  from  humans  whose  blood-

lines  were  mingled  with  those  of  snakes,  ssvaklors  origi-

nated as a cross between dragons and yuan-ti. Ssvaklors and

yuan-ti have much in common and often work together.

While ssvaklors lack much of the yuan-tis natural intel-

ligence  and  cunning,  they  still  enjoy  participating  in  the

complex plans laid by the crafty monstrous humanoids.

Ssvaklors can rear upright but prefer to maneuver on all

four limbs. A typical creature measures 8 feet from nose to

tail and weighs 120 pounds.

Ssvaklors speak Common, Draconic, and Yuan-ti.

COMBAT

A ssvaklors combat strength lies in close-quarters attacks. It will

soften up a group of enemies with its breath weapon, then enter

melee while it waits to recover the use of its breath weapon.

A  ssvaklor  prefers  to   ght  alone  or  in  the  company  of

creatures  immune  to  its  poisonous  breath  weapon.  It  has

too little patience to consider the welfare of associates that

are vulnerable to its breath, so a ssvaklors allies often  nd

themselves in the affected area when the ssvaklor breathes.

A ssvaklor normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus

on damage rolls.

Breath  Weapon  (Su):  30-foot  cone  of  poisonous  gas,

once every 1d4 rounds, damage 1d4 Con, Fortitude DC 24

half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison  (Ex):  Injury,  Fortitude  DC  24,  initial  damage

paralysis, secondary damage 1d4 Con. The save DC is Con-

stitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayanimal trance (DC 13), cause fear

(DC 12), darkness (DC 13), entangle (DC 12). Caster level 15th.

Skills:  A  ssvaklor  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  any  Swim

check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.

It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

SSVAKLORS IN EBERRON

As  the  Inspired  tightened  their  grip  on  Sarlona,  the

yuan-ti natives of that continent fled from their cities in

Riedra, plying the Dragonreach in skiffs and

taking  refuge  on  Argonnessen.  The  yuan-ti

migration did not sit well with many of Argon-

nessens dragons, but a handful of wyrms

saw the immigrants as signs of an unfold-

ing  prophecy  and  offered  them  sanctu-

ary. The yuan-ti forged good relations with

these dragons, and that unlikely union gave

rise  to  the   rst  ssvaklors.  However,  the

yuan-ti were unable to settle Argonnessen

in  large  numbers.  The  dragons  banished

many  of  them  to  Xendrik,  where  they

became corrupt and hateful.

The yuan-ti of Xendrik capture

dragon eggs and use spells to trans-

form  the  unborn  dragon  fetuses  into

ssvaklors. They use ssvaklors as guardians

in their secret cities and temples, most

of which lie hidden beneath the jungle

canopies  of  Xendrik  or  in  the  dank

bowels of Khyber.

Greater ssvaklors continue to thrive

on  Argonnessen,  guarding  dragon

observatories  and  strongholds  as

well  as  protecting  secret  yuan-ti

redoubts beneath the mountains.

super cially  resem-

bles a scorpion, with a

wide,  at body covered by thick scales. It moves

about with the aid of its long, spidery legs that end in crystal

claws that can pierce stone. The front of the creature is a nest

of six long claws mounted on thick, segmented arms. The

creatures tail is in fact a long stalk of  exible black stone

that ends in a huge lampreylike mouth surrounded by  ve

hooked arms.

Although  commonly  mistaken  for  outsiders  from  the

Elemental Plane of Earth, stonesingers are native to the Mate-

rial Plane. They are masters at controlling the earth, and they

sing haunting, booming songs that are often mistaken for

the wind blowing over hollows in the desolate badlands.

Stonesingers are quite intelligent. They are great appre-

ciators of music, and an accomplished performer can some-

times placate an angry stonesinger with an impressive song.

168

This works in the same manner as in uencing a creatures

attitude with Diplomacy, except that the character makes a

Perform (sing) check instead of a Diplomacy check.

Stonesingers are fond of imprisoning intelligent creatures

in cases of stone, leaving only the victims head exposed, so

that they are forced to hear the stonesingers song. Stonesing-

ers sometimes raid towns simply to kidnap audience mem-

bers for their lair. Typically, these individuals are poisoned

and eaten once the stonesinger  nishes its performance.

Stonesingers subsist on fossilized organic matter. While

they can consume natural fossils, they usually gain nutri-

tion by poisoning living creatures and then devouring the

victims hardened form. A typical stonesinger is 12 feet long

and weighs 3,000 pounds.

Stonesingers speak their own language.

COMBAT

A stonesinger invariably sings during combat. While the

sound may be unsettling to listeners, it does not other-

wise  affect  the  fight.  Stonesingers  are  fond  of  making

grandiose moves in combat, and they use Power Attack

to make their attacks more impressive and painful when

it is in their interest to do so.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial

and  secondary  damage  1d4  Dex.  The  save  DC

is Constitution-based. A creature reduced to

0 Dexterity in this manner becomes com-

pletely fossilized. Stone to  esh can restore

a victim.

Shattering  Shriek  (Su):  Once  ev-

ery 5 rounds, a stonesinger can emit an

ear-piercing  shriek  as  an  attack.

This  shriek  creates  a  blast  of

sonic energy that it can direct at

any single target within

60 feet; the stonesinger

makes a Perform (sing)

check,  using  the

targets touch AC as

the check DC. If suc-

cessful, the attack deals

12d6  points  of  nonlethal  damage

and  the  victim  is  stunned  for  1d6  rounds  (For-

titude  DC  18  negates  the  stun).  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daymeld into stone, stone shape;

1/daywall of stone (DC 19). Unlike normal spell-like abili-

ties, these have a verbal component (the stonesinger must

sing). Caster level 9th.

Skills: A stonesinger has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check,

even if rushed or threatened.

STONESINGERS IN FAERN

Stonesingers are most commonly encountered near the

Great Rift and represent a constant bane to the gold dwarves

living there. They can also be encountered as far west as Old

Shanatar and as far north as the Earthroot.

Level Adjustment: 

A  gelatinous  creature  slides  toward  you.

Its  body  is  nearly  transparent  except  for

a  number  of  strangely  glowing  arcane

symbols  that  seem  to  float  within  its

protoplasm. The symbols seem to form

a circle within the ooze, glowing and

pulsing as it moves.

The  result  of  a  bizarre  summon-

ing  ritual  gone  awry,  a  summon-

ing ooze is the living embodiment

of a summoning circle. Capable of

summoning  various  creatures  to

do  its  bidding,  a  summoning  ooze

is  never  fought  alone.  It  surrounds

itself  with  summoned  minions  that

defend it with their lives.

A  summoning  ooze  looks  like  a

translucent  blob  of  protoplasm

roughly 4 feet across. The runes

of  its  absorbed  summoning

circle shift and  ash within

it,  swirling  together  in

a  flash  of  golden  arcane

light  to  form  a  summoning

circle whenever the ooze uses

its summon monster ability.

A  summoning  ooze  is  typically  motivated  primarily  by

a need to hunt and reproduce. With its reasonable intelli-

gence and an ability to produce whatever minions it might

need  for  whatever  purpose  it  can  conceive,  it  can  make  a

potent foe. Some summoning oozes set their sights on the

subjugation of humanoid tribes, supplementing their sum-

moned forces with real minions.

A  summoning  ooze  grows  until  it  reaches  10  Hit  Dice,

at which time it can split into two 5 HD oozes. Likewise,

a summoning ooze with 15 HD can split into three 5 HD

oozes or one 10 HD ooze and one 5 HD ooze. Some sum-

moning oozes choose to split as soon as they reach one of

these thresholds, while other oozes never split at all. Sum-

moning oozes average 6 feet in diameter and 300 pounds in

weight. They do not speak.

COMBAT

Summoning oozes are quite perceptive. They prefer to set

up ambush situations rather than  ght up-front battles. If

they  can,  they  position  themselves  up  high  away  from  a

preferred battleground, summoning monsters each round

down on their prey and only engaging in melee when abso-

lutely necessary.

Acid  (Ex):  A  summoning  ooze  secretes  a  natural  acid

through  its  protoplasmic  membrane.  Each  of  its  natural

attacks deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage.

Summon  Monster  (Sp):  Once

per round as a standard action, a sum-

moning ooze can summon a creature

as the summon monster I spell (caster

level  20th).  The  summoned  creature

remains  for  20  rounds  or  until  slain.  A

summoning  ooze  can  summon  a  maxi-

Due to the oozes Augment Sum-

Level Adjustment: 

This  headless  humanoid  shape  appears  to  be  covered  in  glass

shards that encircle hollows that run all the way through its body.

It lumbers forward on all four limbs, and the slight rasping sound

of  its  scales  scraping  the  floor  it  mostly  masked  by  a  soothing

drone that comes from its body.

A susurrus is an otherwise peaceful creature that destroys

undead  on  sight.  It  moves  through  underground  pas-

sages, taking in the air that sustains it. This act creates a

susurrating dronesong,

sounding  like  a

gentle  wind

blowing

through the trees, that has a curiously stupefying effect on

undead. As such, intelligent undead try to kill a susurrus

if possible.

A  susurrus  is  7  feet  tall  and  about  as  wide.  An  average

susurrus weighs about 500 pounds. Its exoskeleton is honey-

combed with tiny ducts and passages through which the

creature  draws  sustaining  air.  The  creatures  dronesong

echoes through dungeon corridors, and can be heard up to

a quarter-mile away.

A  susurrus  speaks  its  own  hollow-sounding  language,

which most other creatures do not have the vocal capacity

to reproduce. A susurrus lives for several centuries, mating

only infrequently.

COMBAT

A susurrus attacks anyone carrying a torch, wielding  ame,

or otherwise tainting the air that the creature needs to sur-

vive. It also attacks undead on sight. Otherwise, it generally

keeps to itself. Still, if aggravated, it attacks swiftly and

brutally, shredding its foes until they can use no more of

its precious air.

Barbed Defense (Ex): Any creature striking a susurrus

with a handheld weapon or a natural weapon takes 1d4+6

points of piercing and slashing damage from the susurruss

barbs. Reach weapons, such as longspears, do not endanger

their users this way.

Creatures  grappling  with  a  susurrus  take  this  damage

each round as well.

Blindsight  (Ex):  A  susurrus  sees  by  hearing  the

movement of the air and sensing dead zones occupied by

objects. A susurrus in the middle of a fog cloud or similar

spell or magical effect is blinded. (Normal fog has no effect

on a susurrus.)

Detect Undead (Su): A susurrus can use detect undead,

as the spell, at will. This effect is always active.

Dronesong (Su): A susurruss dronesong has no effect on

living creatures, but it soothes undead into a state of torpor.

This ability functions as a rebuke undead attempt from an

evil  cleric  of  a  level  equal  to  the  susurruss  Hit  Dice.  An

undead so rebuked or commanded is instead put into a state

similar to the effect of a hold undead spellit cannot move

and doesnt want to. This effect lasts for 10 rounds.

Ghost  Touch  (Su):  A  susurrus  deals  damage  nor-

mally  against  incorporeal  creatures.  Its  natural  armor

bonus becomes a deflection bonus against an incorpo-

real opponent.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  susurrus

must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start

a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks  of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and can impale its opponent on its barbed body,

dealing  1d4+6  points  of  piercing  and  slashing  damage

each round.

Skills: A susurrus has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if

rushed or threatened.

Swamp strider swarm

Swamp  striders  are  predatory  insects  whose  physiology

allows them to walk on water as easily as on land. They

mob large creatures, piercing them with their dangerously

long  stingers,  consuming  the  blood  that  leaks  into  the

water. Despite the swarms dangerous nature, humanoid

races sometimes hunt swamp strider swarms, considering

roasted striders to be a  ne delicacy. An individual strider

is 7 inches long and weighs 1/2 pound.

COMBAT

Like  any  swarm,  a  swamp  strider  swarm  surrounds  and

attacks  any  living  warm-blooded  prey  it  encounters.  The

swarm  deals  2d6  points  of  damage  (plus  damage  from  its

wounding ability; see below) to any creature whose space it

occupies at the end of its move

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a

swam  strider  swarms  damage  that  begins  its  turn  with

a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 14

Fortitude save negates the effect. Even after a successful

save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the

area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 +

SWAMP STRIDER

SWARMS IN EBERRON

Swamp strider swarms are deadly nuisances in the Crawl-

ing  Swamp  (in  the  Shadow  Marches)  and  the  Vile  Marsh

(in western Droaam). Dozens of swamp strider swarms sur-

round  the  ruined  keep  atop  Karthoon  Tor,  located  in  the

Vile Marshdrawn to the presence of the vermin lord that

lairs there (see the Vermin Lords in Eberron entry, page 185,

SWAMP STRIDER

SWARMS IN FAERN

Swamp strider swarms harry travelers passing through the

Adder Swamp east of Luthcheq in Chessenta and frequently

terrorize the denizens of the Vast Swamp east of Cormyr.

Swarms of blind white swamp striders inhabit the Lightless

Sea and other Underdark lakes and seas; these Underdark

swarms have blindsight instead of darkvision.

A  small  humanoid-shaped

creature thickly garbed in rub-

bery leaves holds a buckler and

grips a thornlike longsword. Its

skin is dark green, and its hair

is brown.

Thorn

The  warriors  of  the  fey

realms, thorns are fanatical defend-

ers.  Often,  a  grig,  nixie,  or  pixie  will   nd  that

its  whimsical  or  mischievous  nature  gets  it  into  trouble

beyond its ability to manage. Sometimes, a thorn will be

around to help such a creature out. These warriors also act

as guards or guardians for prestigious fey or important fey

sites.  For  instance,  if  a  dryad  ever  undertakes  a  mission

important enough to cause her to leave her tree for a time,

she endeavors to enlist a thorn to guard it.

Thorns get their name from the unusual longswords they

carry, which are made of thorns from carefully cultivated,

enormous rose bushes in the faerie courts. Their armor is

made from thick, rubbery leaves and gives them protection

equivalent to leather.

A  thorn  stands  about  3  feet  tall  and  is  very  slender,

weighing only 25 pounds. Its skin can be any shade of

green.  Its  hair  is  usually  bark-brown,  but  a  few  have

berry-red tresses.

Thorns speak Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Thorns generally do not pick  ghts, but they will attack

anyone or anything that threatens or harms other fey.

Like  most  fey,  though,  they  dont  take  a  direct

approach. Instead, they are sneaky creatures that

launch vicious attacks from hiding.

Sleep Arrows (Ex): Thorns carry the

sleep  arrows  commonly  used  by  pixies.

Any  opponent  struck  by  one  of  these

arrows,  regardless  of  Hit  Dice,  must

succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save

or be affected as though by a sleep

spell. The save DC is Charisma-

based and includes a +2 racial

bonus.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  A

thorn  can  sneak  attack  as  a

rogue,  gaining  an  extra  2d6

points of damage on a successful

sneak attack.

THORNS

IN EBERRON

Thorns  inhabit  the  sylvan  wood-

lands of Aundair, defending their pas-

toral demesnes against encroaching

evil. They also lair in the southern

Eldeen  Reaches,  in  the  vast  wood-

lands west of Silver Lake, where they

routinely confound orc and goblin-

oid hunters coming down from the

Byeshk Mountains.

THORNS IN

FAERN

Campfire  tales  about  thorns

and petals (see page 120) keep

the children of the Dalelands from

straying  too  deeply  into  the  surrounding  wood-

lands. The stories suggest that thorns are creatures of mis-

chief, not menace, and local rangers and druids who have

encountered thorns generally speak kindly of them. Indeed,

thorns fancy themselves as sentinels of Cormanthor, watch-

ing over various evil sites that lie half-buried in the darkest

reaches of the ancient woods.

TOPIARY GUARDIAN

This neatly trimmed shrub has been impeccably sculpted into the

shape of an animal.

A topiary guardian is a shrub or bush sculpted into the

shape of an animal and then animated by arcane magic.

As  much  decoration  as  defense,  these  creatures  guard

the  courtyards  of  kings  and  nobles,  blending  in

seamlessly  among  ordinary  hedge

sculptures. The guardians spring

to life only when an

intruder  enters

the garden.

A  topiary  guardian  is  the  same  size  as  the  creature  it

imitates,  so  a  lion  topiary  guardian  would  have  a  lions

tiny branches and leaves, making it much lighter than a

 esh-and-blood  creature  of  the  same  size;  it  weighs  only

one-quarter  as  much  as  its   esh-and-blood  counterpart.

Topiary guardians do not speak, but do rustle slightly as

they move.

COMBAT

Triceratops

A topiary guardian follows the orders of

its  creator  if  he  is  within  90  feet.  If

uncommanded, it continues to fol-

low  the  last  order  it  received  to

the  best  of  its  ability,  though

it attacks any creature that at-

tacks  it.  The  guardians  cre-

ator can leave simple

orders,  such  as

Topiary  guardians

are  as  much  con-

struct as plant. They

are  not  naturally  mobile

plant  creatures;  like  golems,

their animating force is a spirit from

the  Elemental  Plane  of  Earth  that  has

been bound to the body via magic. As a result,

druids  nd them distasteful at best, and an abom-

ination at worst. The wealthy landowners who keep

the creatures in their gardens rarely worry about such

issues, however. They consider the extra security of having a

topiary guardian patiently waiting to spring on thieves or

assassins more important than the shrubs feelings.

sense  vibrations  through

the  ground,  making  them

excellent sentries. When a topi-

ary guardian spots an intruder, it stays per-

often catching the foe off guard.

whether to deal lethal or nonlethal damage depending

on the orders it is given by its creator. Orders to capture

A  triceratops  topiary  guardian  measures  25  feet  long  and

weighs 5,000 pounds.

Combat

A triceratops topiary guardian has the following special attack.

Trample  (Ex):  Re ex  half  DC  31.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based.

CONSTRUCTION

Creating  a  topiary  guardian  begins  with  acquiring  a  per-

fectly sculpted topiary of a boar, lion, or triceratops. Shap-

ing  the  plant  takes  six  weeks  and  requires  a  DC  25  Craft

(gardening), Craft (sculpting), or Profession (gardener) check.

After the topiary has been properly crafted, the creator must

treat it with rare tinctures and oils costing 1/25th the base

price of the guardian (800 gp for a Medium topiary guard-

ian, 2,400 gp for a Large topiary guardian, or 4,600 gp for

a  Huge  topiary  guardian).  Once  the  topiary  is  properly

treated, the animating ritual can commence. The entire

ritual  for  animation  must  take  place  outdoors,  since  the

shrub  remains  dependent  on  sun,  rain,  and  soil  until  the

 nal day of the procedure.

CL  13th;  Craft  Construct,  awaken,  geas/quest,  limited

wish, creator must be a 13th-level caster; Price 20,000 gp

(Medium),  60,000  gp  (Large),  115,000  gp  (Huge);  Cost

10,800 + 800 XP (Medium), 32,400 gp + 2,400 XP (Large),

62,100 gp + 4,600 XP (Huge).

ALTERNATIVE TOPIARY GUARDIANS

Creating  a  topiary  guardian  that  mimics  a  different

animal (of Medium, Large, or Huge size) is possible. Start

with  the  base  creatures  normal  statistics  and  make  the

following changes.

Size  and  Type:  The  creatures  type  changes  to  plant.

Recalculate  base  attack  bonus,  saves,  and  skill  points

based on the topiary guardians Hit Dice (see below). Size

is unchanged.

Hit  Dice:  Topiary  guardians  have  Hit  Dice  according

to their size. Medium topiary guardians have 5 HD, Large

topiary  guardians  10  HD,  and  Huge  topiary  guardians

20 HD.

Speed: Land speed same as base creature. A topiary guard-

ian does not gain any burrow, climb,  y, or swim speed of

the creature on which it is based.

Special Attacks: A topiary guardian gains the following

special attack.

Merciful (Ex): A topiary guardian can deal nonlethal damage

with any of its attacks without taking the standard 4 penalty

on attack rolls. The creature chooses whether to deal lethal

or nonlethal damage depending on the orders it is given by

its creator. Orders to capture or subdue enemies cause the

topiary guardian to use nonlethal attacks; any other attack

order causes the creature to deal lethal damage.

Special Qualities: A topiary guardian gains the follow-

ing special qualities.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A topiary guardian has damage

reduction 10/slashing.

Freeze (Ex): A topiary guardian can hold itself so still that

it appears to be a normal sculpted shrub. An observer must

succeed  on  a  DC  30  Spot  check  to  notice  that  a  topiary

guardian is actually an animated creature.

Tremorsense (Ex): A topiary guardian has tremorsense out

to 90 feet.

Vulnerability to Fire: Topiary guardians are vulnerable

to fire.

TOPIARY GUARDIANS IN EBERRON

Wealthy Khorvairian nobles as well as members of dragon-

marked  families  are  fond  of  using  topiary  guardians  to

protect their estates. Boar topiary guardians are popular

with the nobles of Aundair, Thrane, and Breland. Karr-

nathi  and  Cyran  nobles  favor  lion  topiary  guardians.

Huge  topiary  guardians  such  as  the  triceratops  grace

the impeccably sculpted gardens of some dragonmarked

noble families.

TOPIARY GUARDIANS IN FAERN

Topiary guardians are typically found in places druid circles

convene, including city parks and other places where civi-

lization and nature converge. They also protect temples and

shrines of Chauntea, Mielikki, Silvanus, and other similar

deities.  Aquatic  elf  druids  have  learned  how  to  fashion

underwater  topiary  guardians  from  beds  of  kelp,  while

in  the  Underdark  topiary  guardians  are  fashioned  from

sculpted clumps of living moss.

Advancement: 924 HD (Small)

Theres nothing to be seen here.

A trilloch is a parasite from the Negative Energy Plane. It

causes discord and recklessness in creatures around it, and

it survives by feeding off the dying essence of those who fall

in the midst of the chaos it incites. It always sticks close to a

violent creature until the creature is destroyed, and then it

will follow those who destroyed it.

A  trilloch  is  naturally  invisible.  Even  if  its  presence  is

detected, spells such as see invisibility reveal only an amor-

phous pulse of energy. True seeing or a similarly powerful

divination is required to see a trillochs true forma bizarre

cross between a feathery fungus, a crinoid, and a crustacean.

A fully extended trilloch might measure some 3 feet long,

with a wingspan to match. Trillochs are weightless.

Trillochs cannot speak, but they understand all spoken

languages.

COMBAT

A trilloch cannot  ght on its own, because it has no attacks.

It  controls  the  rage  of  every  creature  it  can  affect,  likely

Trilloch

preventing  spellcasting.  As  creatures  drop  to  negative  hit

points, it uses its death knell ability to feed off their prema-

ture deaths. If harmed, a trilloch fades into a nearby wall.

A  trillochs  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any  weapons  it

wields,  are  treated  as  chaotic-aligned  for  purpose  of  over-

coming damage reduction.

Control Rage (Sp): A trilloch can inspire rage (as a rage

spell,  but  with  a  DC  19  Will  save  allowed  to  negate  the

effect)  in  all  living  creatures  within  180  feet  at

will.  Each  creature  gains  a  +4  morale  bonus

to  Strength  and  Constitution,  a  +2

morale  bonus  on

Will  saves,  and  a

4  penalty  to  AC.

This effect is other-

wise  identical  to  a

barbarians  rage  ability,  ex-

cept that the subjects arent

fatigued  at  the  end  of  the

rage. If a creature has the rage

ability  and  its  bonuses  when

raging  are  greater  than  those

given  here,  it  can  use  its  other

bonuses  instead.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting

compulsion effect.

An  affected  creature  can  end  its  rage  by  making  a

DC  19  Will  save.  The  trilloch  can  end  the  rage  for  any

number  of  creatures  prematurely,  without  affecting

other raging creatures. It can also end a rage caused by

any other effect, such as a barbarians rage ability, and in

that case the barbarian would become fatigued. A trilloch

always ends the rage for a creature who has gone beyond

its normal hit points into those granted by the rage, likely

killing it.

This effect lasts for as long as the trilloch concentrates on

it, plus 1 round per Hit Die of the creature.

Death Knell (Sp): As a quickened action at will, a tril-

loch can create an effect similar to death knell on all crea-

tures within 180 feet. Any living creature in the area that

has 1 or fewer hit points must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude

save or die. The trilloch gains no hit points or other bene t

from the death knell.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A trilloch is immune to most

spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except

the following: Detect magic and deathwatch show its location.

Death ward protects a creature from a trillochs control rage

and death knell abilities. Holy word and banishment return it

to its home plane. It is treated as an undead creature for the

purposes of being affected by cure spells and positive and

negative levels.

Natural  Invisibility  (Su):  This  ability  is  inherent  and

not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

TRILLOCHS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, trillochs are native to the

plane of Mabar, the Endless Night.

Includes adjustments for Power Attack feat.

This hulking creature is about one and a half times as tall as a

human. Its legs end in clawed, three-toed feet, and its massive

forearms end in wide, powerful hands with scythelike claws. Its

hide is rubbery-looking, and its writhing hair is thick and ropy.

Instinct alone drives the powerful carnivores known as cave

trolls. Like their more intelligent kindred, these creatures

have no fear of death and attack unceasingly when hungry.

Cave  trolls  can  live  almost  anywhere,  although  they

prefer to lair underground whenever possible. Whenever a

group of hunting cave trolls wanders near a civilized settle-

ment,  the  trolls  attack  relentlessly,  driven  by  their  nearly

insatiable appetite, until they are slain or the entire settle-

ment has been destroyed. A cave troll stands 10 feet tall and

weighs 800 pounds.

Cave  trolls  have  a  rudimentary  understanding  of  the

Giant language.

COMBAT

Cave trolls are brutal, instinctive hunters. They charge into

melee combat, using their pounce and rend abilities on the

nearest target.

A cave troll normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 3 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +3 bonus

on damage rolls.

Dazing Blow (Ex): The force of both of a cave trolls claws

hitting can be overwhelming. If a cave troll hits with both claw

attacks, the opponent must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or

be dazed for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cave troll must

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Pounce (Ex): If a cave troll charges a foe, it can make a

full attack, including two rakes.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +11, damage 2d6+7. A cave troll

that gets a hold can make two rake attacks with its hind legs,

including adjustment for Power Attack feat.

Rend (Ex): If a cave troll hits with both claw attacks,

it latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh.

This attack automatically deals an additional 4d6+13 points

of damage.

Skills: **Cave trolls gain a +4 racial bonus on Survival

checks when tracking by scent.

CAVE TROLLS IN EBERRON

Cave trolls often serve more intelligent monsters such as the

dark elves of Xendrik, the hobgoblin warlords of Darguun,

and  the  hag  rulers  of  Droaam.  Cave  trolls  inhabit  small

subterranean labyrinths within the foothills of the Byeshk

Mountains separating the Eldeen Reaches and Droaam, the

Howling Peaks north of Zilargo, the Seawall Mountains

between Zilargo and Darguun, and the Ironroot Mountains

that frame the Mror Holds. Numerous cave trolls of Huge

size populate the mountains in central Argonnessen.

CAVE TROLLS IN FAERN

Cave trolls can be found wherever caves exist, although they

are most commonly encountered in the Galena Mountains

south of Vaasa, the Earthspur Mountains west of Impiltur,

and the foothills of the Orsraun Mountains west of Turmish.

They are also encountered in the Underdark, often serving

more intelligent creatures such as beholders, duergar, derro,

phaerimms, and deep dragons.

talline  troll  is  still  only

slightly  less  feral.  A  crystal-

line  trolls  skin  is  made  of  a

Crystalline trolls stand more upright

tall and weighs 600 pounds.

Crystalline trolls speak Giant.

COMBAT

Like an ordinary troll, a crystalline

troll  has  no  fear  of  death  and

joins  combat  with  vigor  and

pleasure. It attacks the nearest

opponent. Even when being hurt

with  sonic  attacks,  the  troll  will

continue its assault.

Rend  (Ex):  If  a  crystalline  troll  hits

with both claw attacks, it latches onto the

opponents  body  and  tears  the   esh.  This

attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9

points of damage.

Crystalline troll

Regeneration (Ex): Sonic attacks deal normal damage to

a crystalline troll. If a crystalline troll loses a limb or body

part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature

can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to

the stump.

This  creature  has  the  ape-

like  posture  and  rubber y

green  skin  of  a  troll,  but  it

is merely the size of a large

human. Its gaze and posture

bespeak an intelligence greater

than its troll-like visage would suggest.

COMBAT

Crafty and organized hunters, forest trolls prefer to strike

from ambush. When possible, they throw their javelins

from the safety of the trees and then drop down on their

weakened prey. They use sophisticated tactics to capital-

ize on their fast healing ability, splitting a warband into

waves  of  hunters.  Should  the  first  wave  encounter  dan-

gerous foes, those hunters retreat to allow their wounds

to  heal  while  the  second  and  subsequent  waves  press

the attack. By using this tactic, a warband rarely loses a

hunter in combat.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and second-

poison  made  from  their  saliva  to  coat  their  javelins  and

Skills: A forest troll has a +8 racial bonus

on Climb checks and can always choose to take

10  on  a  Climb  check,  even  if  rushed  or

The skin of a forest troll chang-

es  color  somewhat,  allowing  it

settings,  this  bonus

improves to +4.

FOREST TROLLS

IN EBERRON

Forest  trolls  are  common

threats  throughout  Khor-

vaire,  inhabiting  the  for-

ests  of  Zilargo,  Darguun,

Valenar,  Qbarra,  Karrnath,

and  Breland.  They  are  even

more prevalent in the jungles

of  Xendrik.  Although  they

have  been  hunted  to  near  ex-

tinction on Aerenal by the elves

who live there, some continue to

populate  the  deepest  jungles  of

that island continent.

Smaller and smarter than other trolls, forest trolls can prove

almost  as  dangerous  as  their  larger  kindred  to  those  who

underestimate them. Although they lack the size and pro-

digious strength of their larger cousins, their intelligence

makes them capable of sophisticated tactics that other trolls

cannot match.

Gifted with a mind at least as adept as that of an average

human,  a  forest  troll  takes  advantage  of  its  amazing  recu-

perative powers with crafty  ghting techniques. An adult

forest troll stands between 6 and 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs

around 250 pounds.

Forest trolls speak Giant.

FOREST TROLLS IN FAERN

Forest  trolls  inhabit  many  of  Faerns  deciduous  wood-

lands.  The  forest  trolls  of  Chondalwood  are  known  as

muskwarts  because  they  have  warty  pustules  covering

their skin. These pustules expel a horrible musk that burns

the eyes. All living creatures (except forest trolls) within

10 feet of the muskwart forest troll must make a successful

DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. Crea-

tures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same

forest trolls blinding musk for 24 hours. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

This  hulking  creature  has

thick,  gray  skin  and  the

rough features of a troll. Its hunched, apelike posture

emphasizes its massive bulk and hints at the power

of its huge fists.

COMBAT

Mountain trolls have no concept of fear or caution. When

they  see  something  they  want  (typically  something  that

they want to eat), they take it. If anything or anyone gets

in their way, they smash it.

A  mountain  troll  normally  attacks  using  its  Power

Attack feat, taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gain-

ing a +5 bonus on damage rolls (+10 if using

a greatclub).

Knockdown  (Ex):  A  mountain  troll

that  hits  with  a  weapon  or  claw  attack

can  attempt  to  trip  the  opponent  as  a

free  action  without  making  a  touch  at-

tack  or  provoking  attacks  of  oppor-

tunity.  If  the  attempt  fails,  the

opponent cannot react to trip the

mountain troll.

Stability  (Ex):  Mountain

trolls  are  exceptionally  sta-

ble  on  their  feet.  A  mountain

troll  has  a  +4  bonus  on  abil-

ity  checks  made  to  resist  be-

ing bull rushed or tripped when

standing  on  the  ground  (but

not  when  climbing,  flying,  rid-

ing, or otherwise not standing

firmly on the ground).

Skills:  Mountain  trolls  can

blend  in  with  their  mountain

surroundings,  providing  them  a

+8  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks

in the mountains.

MOUNTAIN TROLLS

IN EBERRON

Mountain  trolls  inhabit

the Byeshk Mountains

separating Droaam and

the Eldeen Reaches, and

the  Shadow crags  bor-

dering the Eldeen Reaches

and the Demon Wastes. The former tend to be more

in touch with nature, often taking levels of ranger

or druid. The latter are more ferocious, sometimes taking

levels of barbarian.

Mountain troll

The  massive  mountain  trolls  are  the  largest  members  of

the  troll  family.  They  dwell  near  mountain  peaks  and

stir from their lairs only to gather food. Like other trolls,

mountain trolls have voracious appetites.

Mountain trolls are rarely encountered alone. Brutes and

bullies, they casually push around giants, ogres, and smaller

trolls. Although giants and ogres make reluctant minions

at  best,  the  slow-thinking  mountain  trolls  simply  eat  any

creatures  that  fail  to  follow  their  simplistic  commands.  A

typical mountain troll stands 17 feet tall and weighs 2 tons.

Mountain trolls speak Giant.

MOUNTAIN TROLLS

IN FAERN

Brutish mountain trolls inhabit the mountains surround-

ing Halruaa and, to a lesser extent, other mountain ranges

across Faern. Halruaan mountain trolls have the Improved

Natural Attack (bite) feat instead of the Iron Will feat, and

their  bite  attacks  deal  2d6+6  points of damage instead of

1d8+6 points. These mountain trolls can be recognized by

their oversized fangs.

This hulking creature stands upright. Although it has the feral

features of a troll, its rubbery green skin has a dark, metallic tinge

and it wears substantial armor. The creature holds a greatsword

with ease and is clearly a skilled warrior.

These intelligent and dangerous creatures were bred speci -

cally for war. Never without their weapons and armor, war

trolls  know  nothing  of  peace,  only  the  chaos  of  constant

battle. They typically travel from battle to battle in merce-

nary bands. Like forest trolls (see page 179), they are capable

of sophisticated tactics that most other trolls cannot match.

Although they are now a separate variety of troll, war trolls

were once ordinary trolls of unusual strength and intelligence.

pqs

WAR TROLL MERCENARIES

War trolls often gather together in mercenary companies. Al-

though their unruly nature and sheer power makes these mer-

cenaries difficult to control, few armies can stand against them,

and they command premium prices. A mercenary soldier (an

ordinary war troll) will not sign on for less than 30 gp per day, and

a war troll sergeant (4th-level fighter) requires 75 gp per day.

pqs

Gathered together by a powerful cabal of arcane spellcasters,

these trolls were magically engineered and augmented. They

were then bred to produce soldiers of incredible power.

War trolls have a great love of magic weapons and armor,

and they actively seek such equipment if it is properly sized

for their frames. A typical war trolls is 9 feet tall and weighs

about 700 pounds.

War trolls speak Giant.

COMBAT

Unlike their troll kindred, war trolls are precise and methodi-

cal in combat. They trust their regenerative abilities to see

them through a  ght against even powerful warriors, so they

focus their attention on spellcasters early in any skirmish.

Dazing  Blow  (Ex):  The  force  of  a  war  trolls  blow  can

be overwhelming. If a war troll hits with a weapon or claw

attack, the opponent must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or

be dazed for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Regeneration  (Ex):  Unlike  with  their  lesser  cousins,

acid (not  re) deals normal damage to a war troll. If a war

troll loses a limb or a body part, the lost portion regrows in

2d4 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member

instantly by holding it to the stump.

WAR TROLLS IN EBERRON

War  trolls  commonly  reinforce  Darguul  and  Droaamite

infantry units. War troll mercenaries also saw battle dur-

ing the Last War, fighting alongside the

armies of Breland and Cyre against the

armies  of  Thrane  and

Karr nath, respectively.

Level Adjustment: 

A spherical cloud of impenetrable darkness floats toward you.

As  it  draws  near,  black  tendrils  reach  out  from  the  clouds

opaque core.

Vasuthants  are  shad-

owy,  undead  abomina-

tions. These life-hungry

creatures  vary  greatly  in

size  and  power,  each  one

growing  larger  as  it  sucks

in more life energy. Smaller

vasuthants  appear  as  shad-

owy clouds, while larger

varieties  are  colossal

spheres  of  pitch-black

nothingness  that  can

suck  up  nearby  light,

sap strength, and manipu-

late  gravity  and  time.

Vasuthants possess immu-

nity  or  resistance  to  most

forms of energy.

A Small vasuthant is about 2 feet in diameter.

As it advances in Hit Dice and becomes larger,

its  diameter  increases  to  5  feet  at  Medium  size,  10  feet  at

Large size, 15 feet at Huge size, 20 feet at Gargantuan size,

and 30 feet at Colossal size. Vasuthants are weightless and

know no languages.

COMBAT

A vasuthant desires to feed off the positive energy of every

living  thing  it  encounters.  In  every  round,  the  creature

attempts to use its improved grab ability to initiate an ener-

vating crush attack.

Enervating  Crush  (Su):  A  successful  grapple  attempt

by a vasuthant against a living creature of the same size or

smaller  pulls  the  victim  into  the  center  of  the  vasuthant.

In that round and every round thereafter, a grappled victim

takes  1d4  points  of  damage  plus  1d4  points  of  Strength

damage. A creature reduced to 0 Strength by a vasuthant

dies. This is a negative energy effect.

Every point of Strength damage dealt by a vasuthant heals

the creature of 1 point of damage, or gives it 1 temporary

hit point if the creature is at full normal hit points. These

temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.

A vasuthant can grapple with one creature of its size,

or can simultaneously grapple one or two creatures one

size  smaller  or  up  to  four  creatures  two  or  more  sizes

smaller.  Creatures  that  become  pinned  are  suspended

inside  the  vasuthant  while  their  life  energy  is  crushed

out of their bodies.

The  use  of  its  enervating  crush  ability  does  not  pre-

vent a vasuthant from making slam attacks or using its

spell-like abilities.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  vasuthant

must  rst hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks

of  opportunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  a  vasuthant

immediately employs its enervating crush attack.

Reality Distortion (Ex): A vasuthant has limited in u-

ence over the forces of time and reality. Three times per

day (but only once per round), a

vasuthant can take a free action

to reroll any unfavorable die roll

or force its opponent to reroll a fa-

vorable die roll. The vasuthant must

accept the result of the reroll.

Immunity  to  Light  (Ex):

Unlike  many  other  undead

creatures,  a  vasuthant  is  im-

mune to any harmful effects

of  light,  either  natural

or  magical.  All  cleric

spells  of  the  Sun  do-

main  as  well  as  other

spells  with  the  light

descriptor  (such  as  day-

light) produce no adverse effects

on a vasuthant.

Trap  Light  (Ex):  A  vasuthant

effectively  absorbs  nearby  magical  and

nonmagical light, creating a 60-foot emanation

of  shadow.  All  creatures  within  this  area,  including  the

vasuthant,  gain  concealment.  Creatures  with  low-light

emanation.  Light  sources  within  the  area  are  suppressed,

not dispelled. If a vasuthant moves out of range before the

light sources duration expires, the light source illuminates

again  (though  its  illumination  still  cannot  extend  within

the area of the vasuthants trap light effect).

Unholy Toughness (Ex): A vasuthant gains a bonus to its

hit points equal to its Charisma modi er  its Hit Dice.

Skills:  Vasuthants  have  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Listen

checks and Spot checks. *A vasuthant gains a +4 racial

bonus on Hide checks in areas of shadowy illumination.

In areas of bright illumination, it takes a 4 penalty on

Hide checks.

A  horrific  vasuthant  has  grown  massive  and  terrifying

after centuries of absorbing life energy. Horri c vasuthants

have  more  potent  reality  distortion  powers  than  ordinary

vasuthants, in addition to spell-like abilities.

A  Huge  horri c  vasuthant  is  15  feet  in  diameter.  As

it  advances  in  Hit  Dice  and  becomes  larger,  its  diameter

increases to 20 feet at Gargantuan size and 30 feet at Colos-

no languages.

Combat

A  horrific  vasuthant  has  the  same  abilities  as  a  normal

vasuthant except as noted below.

Reality  Distortion  (Ex):  A  horri c  vasuthant  can  use

this ability at will, but no more than once per round.

Spell-Like Abilities: 4/daylevitate, slow (DC 19), teleki-

nesis (DC 21), waves of fatigue; 2/dayreverse gravity (DC 23),

waves of exhaustion; 1/daytemporal stasis (DC 24), time stop.

Caster level 17th.

Alter Past (Su): As a free action, a horri c vasuthant can

produce a rift in time that enables it to replay its last turn.

The  vasuthant  returns  to  the  position  it  occupied  when

its turn began, and any effects that occurred during that

time are reversed (including any readied actions or attacks

of  opportunity  that  its  actions  provoked).  If  it  used  any

spell-like abilities, it regains the daily uses spent. A horri c

vasuthant  can  use  this  ability  three  times  per  day,  but  no

more than once per round.

Trap Light (Ex): A horri c vasuthant effectively absorbs

nearby magical and nonmagical light, creating a 120-foot

emanation  of  shadow.  All  creatures  within  this  area,

including the horri c vasuthant, gain concealment. Crea-

tures  with  darkvision  can  see  normally  within  the  area

of the emanation. Light sources within the area are sup-

pressed, not dispelled. If a horri c vasuthant moves out of

range before the light sources duration expires, the light

source illuminates again (though its illumination still can-

not extend within the area of the horri c vasuthants trap

light effect).

Unholy  Toughness  (Ex):  A  horri c  vasuthant  gains  a

bonus to its hit points equal to its Charisma modi er  its

Hit Dice.

Skills:  Horri c  vasuthants  have  a  +2  racial  bonus  on

Listen checks and Spot checks. *A horri c vasuthant gains

a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in areas of shadowy illumi-

nation. In areas of bright illumination, it takes a 4 penalty

on Hide checks.

VASUTHANTS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, vasuthants are native to

the plane of Mabar, the Endless Night. They often lurk in

ancient  dungeons,  hovering  near  treasure  in  hopes  of

feasting on the life energy of powerful adventurers.

VASUTHANTS IN FAERN

The  Crown  Wars  ended  the  legacies  of  more  than  one

elven  empire,  mighty  Aryvandaar  among  them.  The

sun  elves  of  Aryvandaar  were  fearsome  supremacists  in

command  of  powerful  and  destructive  magic.  Although

their  empire  perished  more  than  ten  thousand  years

before  Dale reckoning,  the  remains  of  many  Aryvan-

daar  sorcerers  continue  to  haunt  their  empires  ancient

ruins  as  vasuthantsambitious,  power-hungry  sun  elves

consumed by utter darkness.

The insectlike creature before you stands 12 feet tall on locust

legs. It has four arms, two of which wield a sword and shield in

chitinous hands while the others bear large, scorpionlike claws.

Beneath its armor, its body is covered with green and black chitin.

Pincers  project  from  its  mouth,  and  a  scorpions  tail  quivers

behind it. As it steps forward, the beetlelike carapace on its back

flickers open and closed, causing the great wasp wings beneath

to rustle like dry leaves.

Vermin  lords  are  largely  solitary  creatures  that  roam  the

underground and visit surface jungles in search of tractable

creatures they can enslave under their rule. Vermin lords

have great power over vermin, and they see their lordship

over other creatures as a natural extension of their divine

right to rule.

Vermin lords rarely work together due to their jealousy

of one another, but vermin lords who meet often have their

slaves battle one another to decide primacy. The victor gains

the  other  vermin  lord  as  a  vassal  and,  if  of  the  opposite

gender, as a mate.

Vermin  lords  dont  create  anything  for  themselves  and

instead scavenge items of use to them from other cultures

or  force  their  slaves  to  make  them  items  as  tribute.  They

particularly value magic items due to their natural af nity

for the use of such objects. A vermin lord stands 12 feet tall

and weighs 1,500 pounds.

Vermin  lords  speak  several  languages  in  an  effort  to

learn more about the magic of other creatures. Most speak

Common, Draconic, Elven, Dwarven, and Undercommon.

COMBAT

Vermin lords are strong melee combatants, but they prefer

to allow vermin minions to do their  ghting. Vermin lords

make judicious use of their magic items and those plucked

from fallen foes.

Command  Vermin  (Su):  A  vermin  lord  can  compel

vermin  to  do  its  bidding.  As  a  standard  action,  a  vermin

lord can target a vermin within 100 feet. The vermin must

succeed on a DC 25 Will save or be controlled. The control-

ling effect functions as a dominate monster spell from a 20th-

level caster. A vermin lord can command up to ten vermin

at one time.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a vermin lord

must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it gets a hold and can

constrict. A vermin lord can use either its Strength modi er

or its Dexterity modi er for grapple checks.

Constrict  (Ex):  A  vermin  lord  deals  automatic  claw

damage on a successful grapple check.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 28, initial and second-

ary damage 1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willrepel  vermin  (DC  17);

5/daysummon swarm (spiders only); 3/daygiant vermin,

insect plague, creeping doom. Caster level 20th.

Vermin  Cloud  (Su):  A  vermin  lord  is  constantly  sur-

rounded  by  a  5-foot-radius  cloud  of   ying  and  crawling

insects of all kinds. The cloud grants the vermin lord con-

cealment from any creature outside the cloud.

In addition, when a vermin lord ends its move within

5  feet  of  a  creature  or  with  a  creature  in  its  space,  the

creature takes 2d6 points of damage and must succeed on

a DC 28 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The

save DC is Constitution-based. The damage of the vermin

cloud can be reduced by damage reduction normally, but

even creatures that take no damage can become nauseated.

Vermin and other vermin lords are immune to the vermin

clouds effect.

The  vermin  that  make  up  the  cloud  are  unaffected  by

the repel vermin spell and similar effects. Effects that would

damage  the  vermin  of  the  cloud  have  no  effect,  because

more vermin instantly appear to replenish the cloud.

A vermin lord can suppress its vermin cloud or renew its

use as a free action. If it does not suppress the cloud, it takes

a 10 penalty on Move Silently and Hide checks.

Evasion (Ex): If a vermin lord succeeds on a Re ex save

against an effect that causes half damage with a successful

save, the vermin lord takes no damage from the effect.

Regeneration  (Ex):  Cold  deals  normal  damage  to  a

vermin lord. If a vermin lord loses a body part, the lost limb

regrows in 3d6 minutes. It can reattach the severed member

instantly by holding it to the stump.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  A  vermin  lord  reacts  to  danger

before its senses would normally allow. It retains its Dex-

terity bonus to Armor Class even if it is caught  at-footed or

struck by an invisible attacker. A vermin lord still loses its

Dexterity bonus to AC when immobilized.

Skills: A vermin lord has a +5 racial bonus on Hide, Jump,

Search,  Spot,  and  Tumble  checks.  A  vermin  lord  has  a  +8

racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take

10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +2 cold iron scimi-

tar, +1 composite longbow (+4 Str bonus), cloak of resistance

+3, wand of fireball. (Different vermin lords may have dif-

ferent possessions.)

VERMIN LORDS

WITH CLASS LEVELS

A vermin lords favored class is rogue. Some indulge their

interest in magic, becoming sorcerers or wizards, but most

vermin  lords  that  are  not  rogues  become  rangers  to  aid

themselves in their wandering.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

A vermin lord is most effective on a battle eld thoroughly

covered by vermin.

Prior to Combat: Before a battle, a vermin lord uses any

protective magic items that it possess on itself and makes

several Colossal vermin using its giant vermin spell-like

ability. If it has a scroll of greater invisibility, it uses it on

itself. If possible, it uses its command vermin ability on

the  giant  vermin  to  give  itself  more  tactical  control  in

the  coming  battle.  After  making  preparations,  it  sup-

presses  its  vermin  cloud,  hides,  and  follows  its  giant

vermin into combat.

First Round: Summon ten centipede swarms from hiding

using creeping doom and place them to hedge in foes against

the attacking giant vermin.

Second Round: If not spotted in the  rst round, use insect

plague around  ying foes or summon swarm around a climb-

ing enemy. If spotted, move out of sight, hide behind a giant

vermin and then use insect plague.

Third Round: If not spotted, continue to use summon swarm,

insect  plague,  giant  vermin,  and  creeping  doom,  hoping  to

entrap enemies and wear them down over several rounds. If

spotted, renew the vermin cloud and use a damaging magic

item against foes, hoping to remain at range.

Following  Rounds:  If  engaged  in  melee,  disengage  and

charge  a  foe  that  has  many  obvious  magic  items  or  has

demonstrated the use of a powerful item. Use a claw attack

against that foe, attempting to grapple and then kill the foe

and make use of the foes magic items.

A  vermin  lord  relies  on  giant  vermin  to  occupy  strong

melee combatants while it focuses its attacks on enemies that

seem likely to succumb to its vermin cloud and poison.

VERMIN LORDS IN EBERRON

Vermin lords occasionally rule their own vermin-infested

cities and demesnes in the heart of Xendrik. They occasion-

ally form pacts with the drow, but these alliances are tenu-

ous at best. Although most vermin lords keep a low pro le,

a vermin lord calling itself Miirkym has taken residence in

a ruined keep atop Karthoon Tor, a hill rising from the Vile

Swamp in western Droaam. Adventurers seeking to destroy

the  vermin  lord  and  retrieve  the  keeps  buried  treasures

have  been  driven  back  by  deadly  swarms  of  insects  sur-

rounding the structure and larger kinds of vermin within

the ruined keep itself.

A few vermin lords have found their way to Khorvaire,

taking up residence beneath large cities such as Sharn and

Korranberg.

VERMIN LORDS IN FAERN

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, vermin lords

typically do not see eye to eye with the drow, although

small  gangs  of  them  often  make  their  lairs  close  to  drow

cities (where vermin are common).

Visilights  communicate  with  each  other  by  means  of

their telepathic link and body gestures. They cannot speak

and do not communicate with other kinds of creatures.

COMBAT

A  visilight  typically  wades  into

combat   ailing  its  powerful   sts,

preferring  to  strike  opponents

that  have  become  paralyzed  by

its  fearsome  gaze.  Its   sts  are

as  hard  as  steel;  it  uses  its  Im-

proved Sunder feat to destroy

weapons,  shields,  and  other

annoying items.

A  visilights  natural  weap-

ons,  as  well  as  any  weapons  it

wields,  are  treated  as  lawful-

aligned  for  the  purpose  of  over-

coming damage reduction.

Charisma  Drain  (Su):  A

visi light  feeds  on  great  beauty  and

presence, and it is irresistibly drawn to

exceptionally  charismatic  humanoids.

When confronted by a humanoid with

a  Charisma  score  higher  than  its  own,  a

visilight attempts to grapple and pin it. Any

living  creature  pinned  by  a  visilight  takes

1d6  points  of  Charisma  drain  each  round

on  the  visilights  turn.  As  the  visilight  be-

gins  absorbing  its  victims  personality,

its  mask  begins  to  reshape  itself  to  more

closely  resemble  the  visage  of  the  indi-

vidual being drained. For every point of

Charisma  it  drains,  a  visilights  Cha-

risma score temporarily increases by

1. A visilight loses these gained points of

Charisma at a rate of 1 point per hour; as this

occurs,  its  porcelain  mask  gradually  reverts  to

A  floating  humanoid  wearing  a  tight-

fitting, floor-length black dress drifts toward you. The

creatures black garb contrasts sharply with the chalky white-

ness of its skin. Its face is a hollow porcelain mask, and the back

of its steel-haired head is missing. Hovering in the hollow of its

head is a pale ball of light that shines through the masks eyes

and mouth.

Visilight

The ball of light that hovers behind a visilights mask is the

sentient part of the creature. This ball of light sheds bright

illumination  in  a  5-foot  radius  and  shadowy  illumination

out to 10 feet. When a visilight is killed, its ball of light

explodes in a brief and harmless radiant burst that turns the

porcelain-white  hands  and  mask  to  dust,  leaving  nothing

behind but the empty black dress.

Visilights equate beauty with perfection. On their native

plane  of  Mechanus,  they  strive  to  absorb  beauty,  thus

bringing themselves closer to perfection, while simultane-

ously eradicating ugliness. In these pursuits, they are both

insatiable and merciless. A visilight stands 6 feet tall and

is weightless.

its original shape.

Gaze (Su): Paralysis for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC

14 negates. A paralyzed opponent cannot resist a visilights

grapple  or  pin  attempt.  As  the  visilights  Charisma  score

improves (see Charisma Drain, above), the save DC against

its gaze attack increases. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the visi-

lights Hit Dice + the visilights Cha modi er.

Telepathic  Link  (Ex):  Visilights  share  a  communal

consciousness, enabling them to communicate telepathi-

cally with other visilights. A group of visilights within 100

feet of each other are in constant contact. If one is aware of

a particular danger, they all are. If one in the group is not

 at-footed,  none  of  them  are.  No  visilight  in  the  group  is

considered  anked unless all are.

Skills: A visilights ability to  oat in near silence gives it

a +8 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

VISILIGHTS IN EBERRON

In the EBERRON campaign setting, visilights are native to the

plane of Daanvi, the Perfect Order.

VOIDMIND CREATURE

As  much  as  mind   ayers  enjoy  devouring  the  brains  of

lesser creatures, they remain interested in  nding new ways

to create minions. Many creatures are preserved in mind

 ayer cities and communities for research, or to serve as the

basis for a new monstrous creation suitable as a servant for

the illithids.

In ages past, mind  ayers experimented to discover the

proper method to create a new servitor race, consuming a

great many creatures brains in the process. Only when one

illithid proposed leaving a portion of the brain intact

enough to preserve the motor functions of the bodywas

the  rst voidmind creature created. A voidmind creature

hovers on deaths door as a result of the process of its cre-

ation, drawing power from the psionic ritual used to infuse

it with a semblance of life.

The creation of a voidmind creature requires the joint

effort  of  three  illithids,  one  of  which  must  be  the  mind

 ayer  that  succeeded  in  attaching  all  four  tentacles  to

the creatures skull. They begin by eating portions of the

subjects  brain  until  just  the  part  is  left  that  allows  the

creature to move. Into the near-empty skull, through the

holes created by the tentacles, is poured a quantity of psioni-

cally charged, translucent green goo. When the voidmind

creatures  cranium  is  again  full,  the  mind  ayers   ll  the

four  holes  in  the  skull  with  dabs  of  mucus  that  quickly

solidify into loose- tting plugs. At the end of the process,

the creature is ready and willing to do the foul bidding of

its masters.

A voidmind creature can think for itself. Although its

brain is nearly gone, the psionic slime put in to replace

the gray matter gives the creature the ability to function

even better intellectually than it could before the trans-

formation.  The  voidmind  process  also  leaves  a  creature

faster, stronger, tougher, and (most important to the mind

flayers) unchanged in physical appearance. A voidmind

creature looks in every way like the creature from which

it was made, except for the four plugged holes in its head

(which  are  evident  upon  close  inspection,  should  the

opportunity arise) that occasionally leak a small amount

of the greenish fluid. A voidmind creature makes a near-

perfect  spy  for  the  illithids,  able  to  return  to  its  home

and  its  former  life  with  little  fear  of  detection  while

gathering  information  in  preparation  for  the  illithids

inevitable onslaught.

A  voidmind  creature  is  bound  to  its  three  mind   ayer

masters  (see  the  mind   ayer  host  special  quality,  below).

However, some have won free of their masters. If all three

of the illithids bonded to a voidmind creature are slain, the

creature regains its free will, though it remains physically

altered. In addition, a carefully worded wish or miracle spell

can free a voidmind creature of its bond and even reverse

the process, although the illithids bonded to the creature

become aware of such an attempt and usually seek out their

wayward servant for the purpose of recapturing it or killing

it outright.

This  eyeless,  muscular  humanoid  has  a  trickle  of  pale  green,

translucent goo running down its neck.

A voidmind grimlock serves as a spy for its mind  ayer mas-

ters in its home enclave.

COMBAT

In  a  battle,  a  voidmind  grimlock  uses  its  cone  of  slime

attack, attempting to catch as many opponents in it as pos-

sible, before resorting to its weapon and tentacle attacks.

Cone of Slime (Su): Once per day, a voidmind grim-

lock can spray forth a 30-foot cone of slime from inside

its skull that deals 2d6 points of acid damage (Re ex DC

14  half).  Any  creature  damaged  by  the  slime  takes  a  2

penalty  on  Will  saves  and  is  stunned  for  1d4+1  rounds

(Fortitude  DC  14  negates  the  stunned  effect).  The  save

DCs are Constitution-based.

Constrict (Ex): A voidmind grimlock deals 1d6+6 points

of damage with a successful grapple check when grappling

with its tentacle.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a voidmind

grimlock  must  hit  a  Medium  or  smaller  creature  with  its

tentacle  attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to  start  a  grapple  as  a

free  action  without  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity.  A

voidmind grimlock has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks

made  with  its  tentacle.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  it

establishes a hold and can constrict.

Sentient Tentacle (Ex): A voidmind grimlocks tentacle

attacks of its own accord. The creature can direct it to attack

certain targets, but the psionic nature of the tentacle enables

it to  ex and move in combat without hindering the crea-

tures other combat abilities. A voidmind grimlock that has

successfully grappled a creature with its tentacle can attack

another creature at no penalty, as long as that creature is

within 10 feet.

Immunities  (Ex):  A  voidmind

grim lock has immunity to acid, gaze

attacks,  mind-affecting  spells  and

abilities (charms, compulsions, phantasms, pat-

terns, and morale effects), visual effects, illusions,

and other attack forms that rely on sight. It is

also immune to ability damage, ability drain,

and energy drain.

Mind  Flayer  Host  (Su):  A  voidmind

grimlocks  mind   ayer  masters  are  in-

stantly aware if the creature takes any

damage, wanders out of range of their

control, or is the target of any magic.

Also  as  a  result  of  this  bond,  the

masters  can,  as  a  standard  action,  see

and hear through the eyes and ears of

their  bonded  voidmind  grim-

lock  to  a  range  of   ve  miles.

Maintaining  this  link  requires

a  mind  flayer  to  concentrate,

but  the  mind  flayer  remains

aware of its surroundings and

can move normally.

Finally, any one of the three

masters can take control of the

voidmind  grimlock,  at  will,

as  the  dominate  monster  spell

(no save). While controlling the

voidmind grimlock in this fashion,

a mind  ayer can manifest its own innate psionic abilities

through  the  voidmind  grimlock,  as  though  the  creature

were manifesting the ability itself. Any of the mind  ayers

psionic powers used in this fashion can target or affect crea-

tures  within  range,  line  of  sight,  and  line  of  effect  of  the

voidmind creature. So, for example, a mind  ayer can use

plane shift to send the voidmind grimlock to another plane,

or it could send itself to another plane. Likewise, the mind

 ayer  could  use  suggestion  on  a  target  it  sees  through  the

voidmind grimlocks eyes.

Skills:  Voidmind  creatures  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Bluff, Escape Artist, and Intimidate checks. *In addition, a

grimlocks dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain,

conferring  a  +10  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks  when  the

creature is in mountains or underground.

magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or outsider (referred to

hereafter as the base creature) of Tiny to Huge size.

A voidmind creature uses all the base creatures statistics

and special abilities except as noted here.

Armor  Class:  Natural  armor  bonus  improves  by  4  (this

stacks with any natural armor bonus the base creature has).

Attacks: A voidmind creature gains a tentacle attack.

At  will,  the  creature  can  extrude  a  tentacle  (re-

sembling  an  oversized  mind   ayer  ten-

tacle)  from  the  psionic  slime  in  the

creatures skull. This tentacle sprouts

from the head of the voidmind crea-

ture  and  can  attack  with  a  reach  5

feet longer than the base creatures

normal reach.

If the base creature can use weap-

ons, the voidmind creature retains this

ability. A creature with natural weapons

retains  those  natural  weapons.  A  void-

mind  creature  fighting  without  weap-

ons  uses  the  primary  natural  attacks  of

the  base  creature,  or  the  tentacle  attack

if the base creature doesnt have natural weap-

ons. When it has a weapon, it usually uses the

weapon instead.

Full Attack: A voidmind creature fight-

ing without weapons uses the nat-

ural weapons of the base creature,

or  its  tentacle  attack  if  the  base

creature  doesnt  have  natural

weapons.  If  armed  with  a  weap-

on,  it  uses  the  weapon  to  make  its

full attack.

Damage: A voidmind creature gains a

tentacle attack. Even if the base creature already

has a tentacle attack, use the damage value on the

table below for its new tentacle. In addition, a void-

mind  creature  gains  the  improved  grab  ability

with its tentacle (see Special Attacks, below).

Special Attacks: A voidmind creature retains all the spe-

Cone  of  Slime  (Su):  Once  per  day  as  a  standard  action,

a  voidmind  creature  can  expel  the  psionically  charged

slime in its head in a 30-foot cone. This attack deals 1d6

points of acid damage per Hit Die of the voidmind creature

(maximum 20d6). A successful Re ex save (DC 10 + 1/2

voidmind creatures racial Hit Dice + voidmind creatures

Con modi er) halves the damage. In addition, any creature

that  takes  damage  from  the  spray  takes  a  2  penalty  on

its Will saves and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds (Fortitude

save negates the stun; save DC same as above). The psionic

slime replenishes itself automatically in 24 hours. The save

DCs are Constitution-based.

Constrict (Ex): A voidmind creature gains the ability to

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a voidmind crea-

ture must hit a creature of its size category or smaller with

its tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. A

voidmind creature has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks

made  with  its  tentacle.  If  the  creature  wins  the  grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Sentient  Tentacle  (Ex):  A  voidmind  creatures  tentacle

attacks of its own accord. The creature can direct it to attack

certain targets, but the psionic nature of the tentacle enables

it to  ex and move in combat without hindering the crea-

tures other combat abilities. A voidmind grimlock that has

successfully grappled a creature with its tentacle can attack

another  creature  at  no  penalty,  as  long  as  that  creature  is

within a distance equal to the tentacles reach.

Special Qualities: A voidmind creature retains all the

special attacks of the base creature and also gains the follow-

ing special abilities.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A voidmind creature has damage

reduction 5/magic.

Immunities  (Ex):  A  voidmind  creature  has  immunity  to

acid and mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, com-

pulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It is also

immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain.

any voidmind creature they create. A different mind  ayer

cannot bond itself to a voidmind creature after creation. The

creatures masters are instantly aware if the creature takes

any damage, wanders out of range of their control, or is the

target of any magic.

Also as a result of this bond, the masters can, as a standard

action, see and hear through the eyes and ears of their bonded

voidmind creature to a range of  ve miles. Maintaining this

link requires a mind  ayer to concentrate, but the mind  ayer

remains aware of its surroundings and can move normally.

Finally,  any  one  of  the  three  masters  can  take  control

of  the  voidmind  creature,  at  will,  as  the  dominate  monster

spell  (no  save).  While  controlling  the  voidmind  creature

in this fashion, a mind  ayer can manifest its own innate

psionic abilities through the voidmind creature, as though

the creature were manifesting the ability itself. Any of the

mind  ayers psionic powers used in this fashion can target

or  affect  creatures  within  range,  line  of  sight,  and  line  of

effect  of  the  voidmind  creature.  So,  for  example,  a  mind

 ayer can use plane shift to send the voidmind creature to

another plane, or it could send itself to another plane. Like-

wise, the mind  ayer could use suggestion on a target it sees

through the voidmind creatures eyes.

Spell Resistance (Ex): Voidmind creatures gain spell resis-

tance equal to 10 + Hit Dice.

Abilities: Change from the base creature as follows: Str

+4, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Cha 2 (minimum 1).

Skills:  Voidmind  creatures  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Bluff,  Escape  Artist,  and  Intimidate  checks.  Otherwise

same as the base creature.

Feats:  A  voidmind  creature  gains  Alertness,  Combat

Re exes, and Great Fortitude, if the base creature meets the

prerequisites and doesnt already have these feats.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: +1.

Treasure: Standard.

Alignment: Usually lawful evil (an enslaved voidmind

creature has the alignment of its illithid masters, while a

free-willed  voidmind  creature  has  the  alignment  of  the

base creature).

Level Adjustment: +3.

VOIDMIND CREATURES

IN EBERRON

Voidmind  creatures  are  encountered  throughout  Khyber,

and their presence usually hearkens to an illithid enclave

in  the  area.  Illithids  will  often  graft  antennae,  grasping

mandibles, and extra raking tentacles onto their voidmind

guardians,  adding  to  their  freakish  appearance  and  foul

demeanor. Some mind  ayers do this to impress their peers

and  rivals,  while  others  strive  to  emulate  or  surpass  the

ingenuity of their daelkyr overlords.

VOIDMIND CREATURES

IN FAERN

Mind  ayers in the undercity of Oryndoll (especially mem-

bers of the citys Abysmal creed) create voidmind creatures

to  terrify  nonillithids  throughout  the  Underdark.  Quag-

goths  are  by  far  the  most  common  subjects  for  voidmind

experimentation,  although  illithids  are  always  creating

horrible new voidmind varieties.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

IDENTIFYING A VOIDMIND CREATURE

An observer can notice the holes in a voidmind creatures head

by making a DC 10 Spot check, or by succeeding on a Spot check

opposed by the creatures Disguise check if it is actively trying to

conceal its true nature. The creature receives a +5 bonus on this

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

check, because the change in appearance involves minor details

only (see page 73 of the Players Handbook).

If the creatures head is covered by armor or clothing, it

receives an additional +5 bonus on its Disguise check.

WARFORGED

Originally  built  to  serve  as  mindless  war  machines,  the

creatures known as warforged developed intelligence as a

side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make

them  the  ultimate  weapons  of  destruction.  With  each

successive model that emerged from the creation forges,

the  warforged  evolved  until  they  became  a  new  type  of

beingliving constructs.

Warforged are renowned for their combat prowess, their

size, and their single-minded focus. They make steadfast

allies and fearsome enemies. They were made for war, and

they continue to perform their function with distinction.

They  ght  ercely and usually without remorse, displaying

adaptability impossible in a mindless construct. In times

of peace, the warforged often struggle to adapt to

a new kind of life without war. Some settle easily

into new roles as artisans or laborers, while others

wander as adventurers or even continue  ghting as

if war had never ceased.

Just as the warforged strive to  nd a place in society in

times of peace, they simultaneously struggle to  nd ways

to relate to the races that created them. In gen-

eral, the humanoid races regard the war-

forged as an unpleasant reminder

of the brutality of war and

avoid  dealing  with  them

when  possible.  Some

societies  regard  them

as the property of the

military forces that paid to have them

built,  and  most  warforged  in  those

lands serve as slave laborers. In other

lands, they are free but sometimes

the  victims  of  discrimination,

hard-pressed  to   nd  work  or

any  kind  of  acceptance.  Most

warforged,  not  particularly

emotional  creatures,  accept

their  struggles  and  servi-

tude  with  equanimity,

but others seethe with

resentment  against  all

other  races  as  well  as

those  warforged  whose

only desire is to please their masters.

Living  Construct  Traits  (Ex):  As  living  constructs,

warforged possess a number of racial traits (see page 215).

Molded plates of wood, stone, and metal cover the body of this

massive  yet  agile-looking  humanoid.  Beneath  the  inter-

locking plates are strands of fibrous sinew. An arcane

glyph is engraved on the creatures mostly featureless

head, and its small eyes gleam with intelligence.

Warforged  appear  as  massive  humanoids

molded  from  a  composite  of  materials

obsidian,  iron,  stone,  darkwood,  and

silverthough  they  move  with  sur-

prising  grace  and  flexibility.  Flex-

ible  plates  connected  with  fibrous

bundles  make  up  the  body  of  a

warforged,  topped  by  a  mostly

featureless head.

Warforged

Warforged have no physi-

cal  distinction  of  gender,

and  all  warforged  have  a

body  shape  that  is  basi-

cally  male.  In  person-

ality,  some  warforged

seem  more  masculine

or  feminine,  but  different  people  might

judge  the  same  warforged  in  different

ways. The warforged themselves seem wholly unconcerned

with matters of gender. The warforged do not age naturally,

though  their  bodies  do  decay  slowly  even  as  their  minds

improve through learning and experience.

Warforged  are  able  to  modify  their  bodies  through

magic.  Many  warforged  are  adorned  with  heavier  metal

plates than those their creator originally provided, built-

in  weaponry,  and  other  enhancements  to  their  physical

form,  which  helps  to  differentiate  one  warforged  from

another. A warforged stands between 6 and 6-1/2 feet tall

and weighs about 300 pounds.

Warforged speak the language of their creators, usually

Common.

Combat

Warforged  are  built  for  combat,  and  they  carry  out  that

task  admirably.  Though  they  are  capable  of  emotion,  few

warforged allow it to cloud the business of war. They  ght

ef ciently and brutally, while remaining remarkably calm

in the heat of battle.

Composite  Plating  (Ex):  The  plating  used  to  build  a

warforged  provides  a  +2  armor  bonus.  This  plating  is  not

natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give

an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite

plating  occupies  the  same  space  on  the  body  as  a  suit  of

armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor

or magic robes. A warforged can be enchanted just as armor

can be. The creature must be present for the entire time it

takes to enchant him.

Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5%

arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wear-

ing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged

to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets

him ignore this penalty as well.

Light Forti  cation (Ex): When a critical

hit or sneak attack is scored

on a warforged, there is a

25%  chance  that  the  criti-

cal hit or sneak attack is

negated  and  damage  is

instead rolled normally.

The  warforged  warrior

presented  here  had  the

following ability scores be-

fore racial adjustments: Str

13,  Dex  11,  Con  12,  Int  9,

Wis 10, Cha 8.

Warforged as Characters

Most  warforged  have  levels  in  mar-

tial classes such as warrior,  ghter,

or  occasionally  paladin,  ranger,  or

barbarian.  Some  warforged  abandon

their  warlike  heritage,  becoming

spellcasters or even rogues.

Warforged  characters  possess

the following racial traits.

 +2 Constitution, 2 Wisdom,

2 Charisma.

Warforged  base  land  speed  is

30 feet.

An  earlier  model  of  warforged

than  the  scouts  and  soldiers,

chargers  are  larger,  less  intel-

ligent, and generally less adapt-

able than their successors. They

are  designed  for  a  single  task:

charging  enemy  defenses  and

pounding them to rubble.

A  warforged  charger  stands

10 to 11 feet tall and weighs up to

2,400 pounds. It haltingly speaks

the language of its creators, usually

Combat

Warforged chargers demonstrate less strategy and initiative

than smaller warforged, clinging to their simple orders or,

barring that, smashing anything that gets in their way.

Adamantine Fists (Ex): A warforged chargers hammer-

the damage reduction of other constructs and to ignore the

hardness of objects.

warforged charger (re ected in the Adamantine Body feat),

providing a +8 armor bonus and granting damage reduction

2/adamantine. This plating is not natural armor and does

not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other

than natural armor). This plating occupies the same space

on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged

charger  cannot  wear  armor  or  magic  robes.  A  warforged

charger can be enchanted just as armor can be. The creature

must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant it.

Adamantine  plating  also  provides  a  warforged  charger

with a 35% arcane spell failure chance. A charger is consid-

ered to be wearing heavy armor that allows a maximum Dex-

terity bonus of +1 and provides a 5 armor check penalty.

Moderate  Forti  cation  (Ex):  When  a  critical  hit  or

sneak attack is scored on a warforged charger, there is a 75%

chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and

damage is instead rolled normally.

Warforged Chargers as Characters

Warforged  chargers  almost  universally  adopt  the   ghter

class on the rare occasions when they advance levels.

Warforged chargers possess the following racial traits.

  +10  Strength,  +10  Constitution,  6  Intelligence,  4

Wisdom, 8 Charisma.

Large  size.  1  penalty  to  Armor  Class,  1  penalty

on attack rolls, 4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on

grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits double those

of Medium characters.

Space/Reach: 10 feet/10 feet.

A  warforged  chargers  base  land  speed  is  30  feet,  but

this  is  reduced  to  20  feet  by  its  Adamantine-Laced  Body

bonus feat.

Racial Hit Dice: A warforged charger begins with four

levels  of  construct,  which  provide  4d10  Hit  Dice,  a  base

attack bonus of +3, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort

+1, Ref +1, and Will +1.

Racial  Skills:  A  warforged  chargers  construct  levels

give it skill points equal to 7  (2 + Int modi er, minimum

1). Its class skill is Jump.

Racial Feats: A warforged chargers construct levels

give  it  two  feats.  It  also  receives  Adamantine  Body  and

Powerful Charge as bonus feats.

Natural Weapons: 2 slams (1d8).

Special Attacks (see above): Adamantine  sts.

Special  Qualities  (see  above):  Adamantine  plating,

damage reduction 2/adamantine, living construct traits,

moderate forti cation.

WARFORGED FEATS

The following feats are available only to warforged characters.

For additional warforged feats, see Chapter 3: Heroic Character-

istics in the EBERRON Campaign Setting.

ADAMANTINE BODY

At  the  cost  of  mobility,  a  warforged  characters  body  can  be

crafted  with  a  layer  of  adamantine  that  provides  formidable

protective armor and some damage reduction.

Prerequisites: Warforged, 1st level only.

Benefit: Your armor bonus is increased to +8, and you gain

damage  reduction  2/adamantine.  However,  your  base  land

speed is reduced to 20 feet, and you are considered to be wear-

ing heavy armor. You have a +1 maximum Dexterity bonus to AC,

a 5 penalty on all skill checks that armor check penalties apply

to (Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently,

Sleight of Hand, Swim, and Tumble), and an arcane spell failure

chance of 35%.

Normal: Without this feat, a warforged character has an armor

bonus of +2.

Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level,

during character creation. Warforged druids who take this feat

cannot cast druid spells or use any of the druids supernatural

or spell-like class features. Warforged characters with this feat do

not gain the benefit of any class feature prohibited to a character

wearing heavy armor.

MITHRAL BODY

A  warforged  characters  body  can  be  crafted  with  a  layer  of

mithral that provides some protection without hindering speed

or gracefulness.

Prerequisites: Warforged, 1st level only.

Benefit: The warforgeds armor bonus is increased to +5,

and the character is considered to be wearing light armor. He

now has a +5 maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, a 2 penalty

on all skill checks that armor check penalties apply to (Bal-

ance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight

of  Hand,  Swim,  and  Tumble),  and  an  arcane  spell  failure

chance of 15%.

Normal: Without this feat, a warforged character has an armor

bonus of +2.

Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level,

during character creation. Warforged druids who take this feat

cannot cast druid spells or use any of their druid supernatural

or spell-like class abilities. Warforged characters with this feat do

not gain the benefit of any class feature prohibited to a character

wearing light armor.

MITHRAL FLUIDITY

Your  movements  are  smoother  and  more  fluid  than  those  of

other warforged.

Prerequisites: Warforged, Mithral Body.

Benefits: The maximum Dexterity bonus a warforged with the

Mithral Body feat can apply to Armor Class is increased by 1. In

addition, the armor check penalties to Balance, Climb, Escape

Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble

checks are reduced by 1.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. However, armor

check penalties cannot be reduced to less than +0.

sneak attacks and extra damage from critical hits.

Prerequisites: Warforged, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: You gain immunity to sneak attacks and extra damage

from critical hits, but you lose the ability to be healed by spells

Skills: Hide +8, Move Silently +6

Feats: Stealthy

Environment: Any land

Organization: Solitary or squad (28)

Challenge Rating: 1/2

Treasure: No coins; 50% goods; standard

60 pounds. Warforged scouts speak the language of their

creators, usually Common.

Combat

Warforged  scouts  avoid  face-to-face  melee,  preferring  to

pepper opponents with arrows from cover and then disap-

pear before striking again.

Composite Plating (Ex): The composite plating used

to  build  warforged  scouts  provides  a  +2  armor  bonus.

This  plating  is  not  natural  armor  and  does  not  stack

with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than

natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same

space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus

a warforged scout cannot wear armor or magic robes. A

warforged scout can be enchanted just as armor can be.

The creature must be present for the entire time it takes

to enchant him.

Composite plating also provides a warforged scout with

a 5% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for

wearing  light  armor.  Any  class  ability  that  allows  a  war-

forged  scout  to  ignore  the  arcane  spell  failure  chance  for

light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.

Light  Forti  cation  (Ex):  When  a  critical  hit  or  sneak

attack is scored on a warforged scout, there is a 25% chance

that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is

instead rolled normally.

The warforged scout warrior shown above began with the

following  ability  scores  before  applying  the  warforged

scout  racial  modi ers:  Str  12,  Dex  13,  Con  11,  Int  9,

Wis 10, Cha 8.

WITCHKNIFE

This 5-foot-tall humanoid has stubby red horns atop its head. It

seems to lack a nose, and tiny red horns grow from its chin like a

beard. It wears brown leather armor studded with more horns,

and  bears  a  shortspear  and  shield.  Its  orange  eyes  widen  as  it

opens its mouth.

Witchknife is the name other creatures

use  to  refer  to  a  race  of  humanoids  that

have the power to compel victims to do

their bidding with but a single utterance.

This power, and their tendency to stab foes

in the back, are the reasons behind the name.

These creatures call themselves athames.

Witchknives live in small settlements,

hiding  in  deserts  and  other  forbidding

locations,  while  they  plot  to  regain

from  the  world  what  they  believe

they once had.

One athame legend tells of a time

when  all  creatures  spoke  one  lan-

guage  and  athames  ruled  the

world. Their word was law, and

other  creatures  obeyed  any

command the athames gave.

Then  a  deity  interfered  and

taught the athames subjects

to  speak  new  languages.

This  broke  the  athames

power over them, and the subjects, who

feared  and  hated  the  athames  despite  their

magnanimous  rule,  rebelled  and  tore  the  athame  empire

to pieces. This legend can be refuted in many ways, one of

which  is  that  different  athame  settlements  blame  differ-

ent deities for their downfall, but nonetheless all athames

believe the legend with a religious fervor.

This much of the athames legend is true: Other races do

fear and hate the witchknives. The power of the witchknives

to control creatures with a word drives other races to desper-

ate actions in order to oppose them. Elves have allied with

orcs, and giants with dwarves, in efforts to root out and

destroy witchknife settlements.

Witchknives have tough skin that ranges in color from

dark  brown  to  ruddy  orange.  They  have  short  red  horns

in  the  places  where  other  creatures  have  hair.  Their  eyes

are orange or yellow with red pupils. A typical witchknife

stands 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.

A witchknifes psionic ability to command others relies

on the target creatures being able to understand the witch-

knife.  Thus,  witchknives  learn  to  speak  many  languages.

All  of  them  speak  Common  and  Undercommon,  and

most  know  four  other  languages.  Typical  choices  include

Dwarven, Elven, Giant, and Goblin.

Witchknife

of its presence, a witchknife attacks from hiding. Multiple

witchknives attempt to  ank foes.

If confronting many foes, a witchknife uses its greater com-

mand ability to have them fall prone. It then attempts to kill

each foe in turn, using its command ability to delay any foe

that  succeeds  in  withstanding  its  greater  com-

mand. If facing a spellcaster, a witchknife often

dismisses its silence ability long enough to utter

a greater command and then renews it to

engage the spellcaster in melee.

Psionics  (Sp):  At  willcom-

mand (DC 16), message, silence (self

only;  dismiss  as  a  free  action);

1/daygreater command (DC 18).

Effective caster level 9th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Sneak Attack (Ex): A witch-

knife can make a sneak attack like

a  rogue,  dealing  an  extra  2d6  points  of

damage whenever a foe is denied

its Dexterity bonus or when the

witchknife is  anking.

WITCHKNIFE CAPTAIN

Witchknife captains generally lead squads

of eight to twelve witchknives and coordi-

nate their subordinates efforts to great effect.

The witchknife captain presented here had the

following  ability  scores  before  racial  adjustments

and Hit Dice ability score increases: Str 13, Dex 14,

Con 15 Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.

Combat

Witchknife captains gain advantages from patience and

planning.  They  prefer  to  ambush  foes  and  attack  from

hiding.

Psionics  (Sp):  At  willcommand  (DC  15),  message,

silence (self only; dismiss as a free action); 1/daygreater

command (DC 17). Effective caster level 9th. The save DCs

are Charisma-based.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  A  witchknife  captain  can  make  a

sneak  attack  like  a  rogue,  dealing  an  extra  4d6  points  of

damage  whenever  a  foe  is  denied  its  Dexterity  bonus  or

when the witchknife is  anking.

WITCHKNIFE SOCIETY

Witchknives  live  in  small  enclaves  that  rarely  have  more

than two hundred adults, hidden from the civilizations of

other races. These enclaves have a hierarchy of rank deter-

mined by birth, but most witchknives are of equal rank and

have  many  rights  and  privileges.  Witchknives  do  not  use

their  psionic  abilities  on  witchknives  of  equal  or  higher

rank except in training exercises.

Witchknives  live  in  an  austere  and  monastic  manner

inside their fortresslike homes. Those not involved in the

tasks of day-to-day survival and subsistence spend most of

their  time  meditating,  training  for  combat,  or  learning  at

the library.

COMBAT

Witchknives  use  their  silence  psionic  ability  to  protect

themselves from sonic attacks and aid their attempts to stalk

enemies. When within striking distance of a foe unaware

Level Adjustment: +3

This strange humanoid-shaped

creature  bears  a  large  wooden

shield and club held at the ready.

Small  black  eyes  glower  at  you

from within deep pits in its face.

Its  body  is  covered  in  bark  and

burls  of  muscle,  and  a  circle  of

branch stubs crowns its head.

Wood  woads  are  brutish  and

territorial plant creatures akin

to treants. Their bodies resemble

those  of  powerfully  built

but  twisted  men,  composed

entirely  of  bark-covered  wood.

Their  hands  end  in  gnarled,  branchlike   ngers,

and their feet are masses of black roots.

A wood woad has the power to enter trees as a dryad can, but it

can also use this ability to teleport from tree to tree. This similar-

ity to the dryads ability has led some to think that wood woads

are the male version of the race, but they are in fact plants, and

they reproduce through seeds much like a treant does.

Wood woads cannot carry most treasure items with them

when they move from tree to tree; after defeating a foe, they

often carry useful items some distance away to hide them in

a hollow tree or under a stump. Although dimwitted, wood

woads have an excellent memory for where such caches lie,

and they return to them to retrieve better weapons or useful

items when they spot intruders.

Such caches are often guarded by a thick wooden door

that a wood woad opens and closes with its warp wood ability.

This power allows a wood woad to twist dead wood and wooden

objects, and a forest occupied by a wood woad is often marked

by frequent instances of its past uses of the ability. A wood

woad is about 6 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

Wood woads speak a rudimentary form of Sylvan.

COMBAT

Wood woads attack any creature not native to their forests.

They charge foes from some distance away, using their tree-

walk ability to cross the distance swiftly. After they warp

their foes wooden weapons and strike a few blows, wood

woads  ee and watch to see if their enemies go away.

Warp Wood (Sp): A wood woad can use a warp wood effect,

as the spell, at will. Attended objects can avoid the effect with

a DC 13 Will save (but if a saving throw succeeds, the wood

woad can simply produce the effect again in the following

round). Caster level 8th. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

Treewalk (Su): At will, a wood woad can enter a living

tree as a free action and exit from it or another living tree

within 60 feet, continuing as though the distance between

the trees had not been crossed. A wood woad moving in this

manner can charge or run through trees so long as it moves

in a straight line.

The entrance and exit trees

must have girths at least equal

to the wood woads, and the wood

woad  cannot  take  non vegetable

items or other creatures with it when

it  treewalks.  A  wood  woad  can  exit  a

tree in any direction and from any part

of the tree that has enough girth.

A wood woad can remain inside a

living tree for as long as it wishes. A

wood  woad  inside  a  tree  senses  the

world  around  it  normally  and  auto-

matically  knows  which  trees  within

60  feet  are  living  and  can  accept  its

girth.  If  the  tree  in  which  a  wood

woad  hides  is  chopped  down,  burned

up, or otherwise killed, the wood woad

inside dies.

This ability is a teleportation effect.

Skills:  Wood  woads  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Balance checks and Hide checks. A wood woad has a +8 racial

bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on

Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. *In wooded areas, a

wood woad gains an additional +4 bonus on Hide checks.

WOOD WOADS WITH CLASS LEVELS

A wood woads favored class is ranger, but most wood woad

leaders  are  druids.  Most  wood  woad  rangers  choose  elves

as their favored enemy due to their many encounters with

elves in the woods.

WOOD WOADS IN EBERRON

Wood woads haunt the ancient forests of the Eldeen Reaches.

They frequently loiter around treants and make their lairs

near old ruins.

WOODLING

Woodling  creatures  have  bonded  with  nature;  to  a  large

extent, they have become plant creatures. These creatures

have an unusual mind-set, much like that of a treant. They

are one with nature and at peace with it and themselves.

This example uses a monitor lizard as the base creature.

Monitor  lizards  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks

A woodling uses all the base creatures statistics and abili-

ties except as noted here.

Size and Type: A woodlings type does not change, but it

possesses fully developed plant traits (see below).

Armor  Class:  The  base  creatures  natural  armor  bonus

improves by 7.

Attack:  A  woodling  retains  all  the  attacks  of  the  base

creature and also gains a slam attack if it didnt already have

one.  If  the  base  creature  can  use  weapons,  the  woodling

retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains

those natural weapons. A woodling  ghting without weap-

ons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon

(if it has any). A woodling armed with a weapon uses its slam

or a weapon, as it desires.

Full Attack: A woodling  ghting without weapons uses

either its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it

has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon

as  its  primary  attack  along  with  a  slam  or  other  natural

weapon as a natural secondary attack.

Damage:  Woodlings  have  slam  attacks.  If  the  base

creature does not have this attack form, use the appropri-

ate  damage  value  from  the  table  below  according  to  the

woodlings size. Creatures that have other kinds of natural

weapons retain their old damage values or use the appropri-

ate value from the table below, whichever is better.

Special  Qualities:  A  woodling  creature  has  all  the

special qualities of the base creature, plus the following

special qualities.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A woodling creature has damage

reduction 5/slashing.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): The creature gains low-light vision,

enabling  it  to  see  twice  as  well  as  a  human  in  starlight,

moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar  conditions  of  shadowy

illumination. It retains the ability to distinguish color and

detail under these conditions.

Plant Traits: A woodling has immunity to poison, magic

sleep  effects,  paralysis,  polymorph,  stunning,  and  mind-

affecting  spells  and  abilities  (charms,  compulsions,  phan-

tasms, patterns, and morale effects). It is not subject to extra

damage from critical hits.

Skill  Bonuses  (Ex):  A  woodlings  skin  and  hair  resemble

bark  and  leaves.  Any  wings  the  creature  may  have  are

lea ike  or  frondlike,  and  every  part  of  the  creature  has  a

distinctly plantlike look that changes with the seasons. It is

light green in early spring, darkening during the summer.

In autumn, it turns yellow, orange, or red like a deciduous

leaf. In the winter, it is a dry brown. A woodling has a +4

bonus on Hide checks and Move Silently checks in aboveg-

round natural environments.

Vulnerability to Fire (Ex): Woodling creatures have vul-

nerability  to  fire.  A  woodling  takes  half  again  as  much

(+50%)  damage  as  normal  from  the  effect,  regardless  of

whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a suc-

cess or failure.

Environment: Any aboveground natural.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Organization: Same as the base creature, except most

of  a  group  will  be  the  base  creature  with  usually  only

one woodling.

Level Adjustment: +3.

WOODLINGS IN EBERRON

Woodlings  inhabit  forests  and  jungles  throughout  Khor-

vaire  and  Aerenal.  Aerenal  elves  keep  woodling  apes  and

baboons as pets, while Valenar elves hunt woodling lizards

for sport (using their skins to fashion clothing and armor).

A tribe of wild woodling hal ings called the Feryk inhabit

the jungles of Xendrik. The Feryk, who revere a group of

ancient treants known as the Viridian Grove, used to meet

and trade with visitors, but a foul plague of unknown origin

has  corrupted  the  Viridian  Grove  and  turned  the  Feryk

savage and feral.

WOODLINGS IN FAERN

Folklore  says  that  places  where  Silvanus  touched  the

ground in Toril are especially fertile and blessed. A place

where  Silvanus  tarried  for  a  time  contains  more  of  his

magic,  exhibiting  large  trees  and  hardy  plants.  The  leg-

ends say that a child conceived or born in such a locale

might gain the Forest Fathers blessing and be as one with

nature, a woodling.

This  massive  armored  canine

snarls  and  flicks  its  huge,

barbed  tongue  inside  its

double-jawed  mouth.  Eye-

less,  it  sniffs  and  snorts  as

it shifts its bulk and rakes

the  ground  with  its  four

clawed feet.

The  scouts  and  skir-

mishers  in  yugoloth

armies,  canoloths  also

serve  as  guardians

and  bodyguards  for

their  dark  masters.

Their keen senses spot

stealthy  adversaries,

which  are  then  appre-

hended  with  their  wicked,

barbed tongues.

A  canoloth  looks  like  an

armored  bulldog  the  size  of  a

human,  with  two  sets  of  jaws:  a

vertical  set  inside  a  horizontal  set.

It has no eyes, relying totally on hearing

and smell to  nd intruders. Its most promi-

nent feature is a barbed tongue several inches thick

that it can  ick out at a target up to 20 feet away. A canoloth

stands about 4 feet tall at the shoulder, is about 6 feet long,

and weighs 400 pounds.

Canoloths speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal.

COMBAT

A canoloths combat strategy is simple: Use scent and hear-

ing  to  track  down  an  opponent,  then  grab  it  with  the

tongue,  pull  it  back  to  the  mouth,  and  chew  until  its  a

meal, not an enemy.

A canoloths natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of over-

coming damage reduction.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a canoloth must

hit with its tongue attack. It can pull a grabbed opponent of

Medium or smaller size into its mouth in the same round

and make a bite attack. The canoloth can establish a hold

with  a  successful  attack  even  if  the  victim  isnt  paralyzed

(see below).

Paralysis  (Ex):  Those  hit  by  a  canoloths  tongue  attack

must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for

1d6+2 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willcause  fear  (DC  12),  des-

ecrate, detect good, detect magic. Caster level 5th.

Summon Yugoloth (Ex): Once per day, a

canoloth  can  attempt  to  summon  a  mezzo-

loth or 1d3 canoloths with a 40% chance

of success.

Blindsight  (Ex):  Canoloths

can  ascertain  all  foes  within  40

feet as a sighted creature would.

Beyond that range, they treat

all  targets  as  having  total

concealment.

Canoloths  are  susceptible

to  sound-  and  scent-based

attacks,  and  are  affected

normally  by  loud  noises

and  sound-based  spells

(ghost sound, silence) and by

overpowering odors (such

as stinking cloud, cloudkill,

or incense-heavy air). Ne-

gating  a  canoloths  sense

of  smell  or  hearing  reduc-

es  this  ability  to  normal

Blind-Fight  (as  the  feat).  If

both senses are negated, the

canoloth is effectively blinded.

Immunities (Ex): Cano-

loths  are  immune  to  gaze  at-

tacks, visual effects, sight-based

illusions  (such  as  silent  image),

and  other  attack  forms  that  rely  on

sight.  All  yugoloths  are  immune  to  poison

and acid.

Telepathy  (Su):  Canoloths  can  communicate

telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that

Canoloth

has a language.

This  six-limbed  insectoid  horror  stares  ahead  unblinkingly

through glowing red eyes. It holds a long trident in its claws.

Mezzoloths  are  the  most  common  foot  soldiers  in  the

yugoloth  armies.  They  understand  little  beyond  combat,

but their skill in battle is fearsome. When they arent  ght-

ing, theyre imagining new ways to hurt their enemies and

practicing their martial skills.

A mezzoloth looks like a human-sized insect with heavy

chitin  and  four  limbs  tipped  with  sharp  claws.  Its  wide-

set eyes glow red when its angry (which is almost always).

When  arrayed  for  battle,  mezzoloths  wield  tridents  and

carry shields. A mezzoloth stands 7 feet tall and weighs

250 pounds.

Mezzoloths speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal.

COMBAT

When  directed  to  attack  an  opponent,  mezzoloths   rst

try to weaken it with cloudkill, then close and attack with

their  tridents.  If  the  enemy  is  likely  to  use  enhancing

magic such as bulls strength or stoneskin, a few mezzoloths

use an area dispel magic before melee begins. If the battle is

Mezzoloth

going poorly, mezzoloths use darkness and teleport without

error to make a getaway.

Their tactics are similar in a large army battle. Squads of

trident-wielding mezzoloths are the backbone of a yugoloth

force. They teleport into battle, launch cloudkill at the enemy,

then charge into the yellow mist with their tridents.

A mezzoloths natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of over-

coming damage reduction.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willcause  fear  (DC  13),  dark-

ness,  desecrate,  produce   ame,  see  invisibility;  2/daycloudkill

(DC 17), dispel magic. Caster level 10th.

Twice  per  day,  a  mezzoloth  can  use  greater  teleport  (self

plus 50 pounds of objects only), as the spell cast by a 14th-

level sorcerer.

Summon Yugoloth (Ex): Once per day, a mezzoloth can

attempt to summon another mezzoloth with a 40% chance

of success.

Immunities (Ex): Mezzoloths are immune to poison

and acid.

Telepathy (Su): Mezzoloths can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

YUGOLOTH, NYCALOTH

Though large and obviously powerful, this winged green creature

still evokes a sense of speed and agility. Its dog-shaped head turns

quickly from side to side, almost like a birds. The claws on the

ends of its powerful fingers look like more than a match for all

but the best armor.

Nycaloths  act  as  elite  cavalry  in  yugoloth  armies,  swoop-

ing down onto enemy  anks and tearing up unsuspecting

troops. They pride themselves on their ability to strike with-

out warning, then disappear before the enemy has time to

launch a reprisal.

A nycaloth looks like a big gargoyle with powerful bat-

wings  and  thick,  green  skin.  All  four  limbs  have  razor-

sharp claws. The head is vaguely canine, with small webbed

ears and horns. Most nycaloths carry large greataxes into

battle. An average nycaloth stands 8 feet tall and weighs

800 pounds.

Nycaloths speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal.

Combat

A nycaloths favorite tactic is to use invisibility to approach an

enemy on the ground, then dive in with claws extended. If

the opponent survives the attack, the nycaloth grabs it and

takes off, grappling the enemy until it can drop it from a

great height.

A  nycaloths  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any

weapons  it  wields,  are  treated  as  evil-aligned

for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

202

Nycaloth

A nycaloth normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 3 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +3 bonus

on damage rolls (+6 damage with greataxe).

Bleeding  Wounds  (Ex):  A  wound  from  a  nycaloths

claw  attack  continues  to  bleed  after  the  injury  was

inflicted. Each wound bleeds for 1 point of damage per

round thereafter. Multiple claw wounds result in cumula-

tive bleeding loss (two wounds deal 2 points of damage

per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only

by  a  successful  DC  15  Heal  check  or  the  application  of

any cure spell or other healing spell (heal, mass heal, and

so on).

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  nycaloth

must  hit  with  both  claw  attacks.  It  can  then  attempt  to

start  a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can attempt to either deal damage with its claws,

rake the grappled target (see below), or use its liftoff ability

(see below).

Liftoff (Ex): A nycaloth can only use this ability when

airborne. A nycaloth that gets a hold on a nonflying oppo-

nent of Medium or smaller size can ascend with the grap-

pled creature. When carrying a medium load (a creature

weighing between 267 and 532 pounds), the nycaloths fly

speed drops to 60 feet and it takes a 3 penalty on Hide

and Move Silently checks; these penalties worsen to 6

with a heavy load (a creature weighing between 533 and

800 pounds). A nycaloth cant carry a load of more than

800 pounds.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +15, damage 1d6+5. A nycaloth

that  gets  a  hold  can  make  two  rake  attacks  with  its  hind

legs. This includes using the Power Attack feat to take a 3

penalty on its attack rolls and gain +3 on damage rolls.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdeeper darkness, desecrate,

fear  (DC  17),  invisibility,  mirror  image,  see  invisibility,  greater

teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only).

Summon Yugoloth (Ex): Once per day, a nycaloth can

attempt  to  summon  another  nycaloth  or  1d3  mezzoloths

with a 30% chance of success.

Immunities  (Ex):  Nycaloths  are  immune  to  poison

and acid.

Telepathy  (Su):  Nycaloths  can  communicate  tele-

pathically with any creature within 100 feet that has

a language.

NYCALOTH COMMANDER

Commanders of nycaloth forces in the yugoloth armies

earn  their  rank  by  being  bigger,  brawnier,  and  tougher

than their fellows.

lowing ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit

Dice ability score increases: Str 14, Dex 8, Con 16, Int

Dark-skinned and alien-looking, this slim

figure  is  fearsome  to  behold.  Its  long

head and bulbous eyes give its face

an imposing, evil look.

Ultroloths  are  the  elite  of-

 cers in yugoloth armies,

leading  troops  and  dis-

rupting  enemy  plans.  In

the  competitive  environ-

ment  of  Gehenna,  theyre

frequently at one anothers

throats,  and  they  continu-

ally  scheme  to  enhance

their power.

Ultroloths  have  a  well-

deserved  reputation  for

cruelty.  They  often  linger

over  fallen  foes,  taunting

and  torturing  them  rather

than  granting  them  a  quick

death. Many wear the severed  n-

gers of their victims on grisly necklaces.

204

They rarely engage in a stand-up  ght themselves, leaving

such work to their minions.

An ultroloth is a robed humanoid with an elongated head

that  is  featureless  beyond  two  large  eyes  that  swirl  with

color. Its skin is a mottled dark gray. Tall and thin, an ultro-

loth stands 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.

Ultroloths speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal.

COMBAT

Ultroloths  prefer  to  work  behind  ranks  of  mezzoloths  or

nycaloths,  using  their  spell-like  abilities  to  keep  foes  off

balance. An ultroloth captain usually puts up walls of  re to

assist front-line troops. If the battle hangs in the balance,

it  uses  symbol  of  death  to  disrupt  the  enemy.  An  ultroloth

engaged in serious melee almost always retreats, reasoning

that it has already lost the battle at that point.

Ideally,  ultroloths  dont   ght  at  all.  They  use  invisibility

or alter self to get close to their enemies, then unveil their

hypnotic gaze. Once opponents are entranced, they are easy

prey for the ultroloths other abilities.

A ultroloths natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of over-

coming damage reduction.

This  5-foot-tall  creature  stands  upright  on  two  powerful  hind

legs, while two slender but muscular forelimbs sprout three long,

curving claws each. The creatures reptilian head features a wide

mouth full of sharp teeth. Its red hide is rough and pebbled, with

narrow bands of black across its back, legs, and long, thick tail.

The zezir is a ruthless desert predator that loves the sight of an

open, uncontrolled  ame. Zezirs live to start and spread  res,

reveling in the crackle and play of something, anything, as it

burns. Zezir packs have been known to attack merchant cara-

vans and set them alight, retreating beyond the range of retalia-

tion to cavort in joy as the entire caravan goes up in smoke.

The creatures feed on ash, and their seeming infatuation

with   re  provides  them  with  sustenance.  However,  their

love  of   re  also  stems  from  their  chaotic  nature  and  an

innate love of destruction.

Male and female zezirs participate in hunts equally, and

packs share the responsibility of raising the young. Zezirs

can communicate by means of a sequence of yips, growls,

and whines.

Zezirs are not reptilian, although they have some reptil-

ian traits. They are more closely related to avians. A typical

zezir stands between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs around

150 pounds.

COMBAT

Zezirs  are  fast  and  agile,  but  not  particularly  stealthy.  A

pack  typically  posts  a  lookout  near  the  site  of  a  possible

Z

Zezir

ambush, while the rest of the creatures lie in wait several

hundred feet away. Once possible prey is spotted, the zezir

scout returns to report the size and direction of the target.

The  pack  then  heads  off  at  a  run  to  intercept.  Once  they

reach their objective, the zezirs run through and by their

targets.  The   rst  zezirs  of  the  pack  spray  their  opponents

with their sticky  ammable spray, and the following zezirs

use their spark stream attack to set the very air on  re. The

zezirs often retreat to a safe distance to watch the burning,

repeating the tactics if necessary.

A  zezir  normally  attacks  using  its  Power  Attack  feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus

on damage rolls.

Flammable Spray (Ex): As a standard action, a zezir can

expel  a  sticky,  superheated,  highly   ammable  goo  from

glands in its neck every 1d4 rounds. The goo  lls a 30-foot

cone  and  deals  2d6  points  of   re  damage  (Re ex  DC  18

half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

If  any  open   re  (such  as  a  torch  or  a   aming  sword)  is

present within this area or enters the area in the following

round, the entire area bursts into  ame for 3 rounds. This

effect  deals  1d6  points  of   re  damage  every  round  to  all

creatures and objects within the area (no save).

Spark  Stream  (Su):  As  a  standard  action,  a  zezir  can

shoot of stream of sparks at an opponent from its mouth as

a ranged touch attack. The spark stream has a range of 30

feet and no range increment.

ZEZIRS IN EBERRON

In  the  EBERRON  campaign  setting,  zezirs  are  native  to  the

 ery plane of Fernia.

Monster Feats

Several of the creatures in Monster Manual III have one or

more of the feats described on this page and the follow-

ing page. All of these feats, except for Improved Tough-

ness and Powerful Charge, were originally described in

the Monster Manual.

Even though this section is titled Monster Feats, many

of these feats can be taken by player characters and NPCs as

well as monsters, so long as they meet the prerequisites.

Unless otherwise noted in a feats header line, all the feats

presented here are general feats.

ABILITY FOCUS

The special attack of a creature with this feat is more potent

than normal.

Prerequisite: Special attack.

Bene  t: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against

the special attack on which the creature focuses.

Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Its

effects do not stack. Each time the creature takes the feat, it

applies to a different special attack.

AWESOME BLOW

A creature with this feat can choose to deliver blows that

send its smaller opponents  ying like bowling pins.

Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush,

size Large or larger.

Bene  t: As a standard action, the creature can choose

to  subtract  4  from  its  melee  attack  roll  and  deliver  an

awesome  blow.  If  the  creature  hits  a  corporeal  opponent

smaller  than  itself  with  an  awesome  blow,  its  opponent

must succeed on a Re ex save (DC equal to damage dealt)

or be knocked  ying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking

creatures choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can

only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent

cant move closer to the attacking creature than the square

it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the

opponents move, the opponent and the obstacle each take

1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space

adjacent to the obstacle.

Special: A  ghter can select Awesome Blow as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

A newly created construct has average hit points for its

Hit Dice.

EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY

A  creature  with  this  feat  can  use  a  spell-like  ability  with

greater effect than normal.

Prerequisite:  Spell-like  ability  at  caster  level  6th  or

higher.

Bene  t: The creature can use one of its spell-like abili-

ties as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day

(or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice

per day).

When  a  creature  uses  an  empowered  spell-like  ability,

all  variable,  numeric  effects  of  the  spell-like  ability  are

increased  by  one-half.  An  empowered  spell-like  ability

does half again as much damage as normal, cures half again

as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and

so on as appropriate. For example, a phoelarchs empowered

scorching ray deals 1-1/2 times normal damage (roll 4d6 and

multiply the result by 1-1/2 for each ray). Saving throws and

opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts

dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities without

random variables are not affected.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating

a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level

(round down) 2. For a summary, see the table in the descrip-

tion of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat on the next page.

For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as

a  13th-level  caster  can  only  empower  spell-like  abilities

duplicating spells of 4th level or lower.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its

spell-like abilites.

FLYBY ATTACK

A creature with this feat can attack on the wing.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Bene  t: When  ying, the creature can take a move action

(including a dive) and another standard action at any point

during the move. The creature cannot take a second move

action during a round when it makes a  yby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard

action either before or after its move.

CRAFT CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]

A creature with this feat can create golems and other magic

automatons that obey its orders.

Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,  Craft

Wondrous Item.

Bene  t: The creature can create any construct whose pre-

requisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes one day for

each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct, a

spellcaster must spend 1/25 the items price in XP and use

up raw materials costing half of this price.

The  creature  can  repair  constructs  that  have  taken

damage.  In  one  day  of  work,  the  creature  can  repair  up

to  20  points  of  damage  by  expending  50  gp  per  point  of

damage repaired.

IMPROVED NATURAL ARMOR

The natural armor of a creature with this feat is thicker and

harder than normal for its kind.

Prerequisites: Natural armor, Con 13.

Benefit: The creatures natural armor bonus increases

by 1.

Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Each

time the creature takes the feat, its natural armor bonus

increases by 1.

IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK

The natural attacks of a creature with this feat are more dan-

gerous than its size and type would otherwise dictate.

Prerequisite: Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.

7/13/04   5:43:46 PM

7/13/04   5:43:46 PM

Bene  t: The damage for one of the creatures natural

attack forms increases by one step, as if the creatures size

had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6,

3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. A weapon or attack that deals 1d10

points of damage increases as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8,

6d8, 8d8, 12d8.

IMPROVED TOUGHNESS

A creature with this feat is signi cantly tougher than normal.

Prerequisite: Base Fortitude save bonus +2.

Benefit:  The  creature  gains  a  number  of  hit  points

equal to its current Hit Dice. Each time it gains a Hit Die

(such as by gaining a level), it gains 1 additional hit point.

If it loses a Hit Die (such as by losing a level), it loses 1 hit

point permanently.

Special: A  ghter can select Improved Toughness as one

of his  ghter bonus feats.

MULTIATTACK

A creature with this feat is adept at using all its natural

weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.

Bene  t:  The  creatures  secondary  attacks  with  natural

weapons take only a 2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, the creatures secondary attacks

with natural weapons take a 5 penalty.

POWERFUL CHARGE

A creature with this feat can charge with extra force.

Prerequisites: Medium or larger, base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t: When the creature charges, if its melee attack

hits,  it  deals  an  extra  1d8  points  of  damage  (if  it  is  of

Medium size). For Large creatures, the extra damage is

2d6 points; for Huge, 3d6; for Gargantuan, 4d6; and for

Colossal, 6d6.

This feat only works when the creature makes a charge.

It  does  not  work  when  the  creature  is  mounted.  If  the

creature  has  the  ability  to  make  multiple  attacks  after

a charge, it can only apply this extra damage to one of

those attacks.

Special: A  ghter can select Powerful Charge as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY

A creature with this feat can employ a spell-like ability with

a moments thought.

Prerequisite:  Spell-like  ability  at  caster  level  10th  or

higher.

Benefit:  The  creature  can  use  one  of  its  spell-like

abilities as a quickened spell-like ability three times per

day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or

twice per day).

Using a quickened spell-like ability is a swift action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The creature can

perform another actionincluding the use of another spell-

like  abilityin  the  same  round  that  it  uses  a  quickened

spell-like ability. The creature can use only one quickened

spell-like ability per round.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicat-

ing a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster

level (round down) 4. For a summary, see the table below.

For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a

15th-level caster can only quicken spell-like abilities dupli-

cating spells of 3rd level or lower. In addition, a spell-like

ability  that  duplicates  a  spell  with  a  casting  time  greater

than 1 full round cannot be quickened.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires

a  standard  action  and  provokes  attacks  of  opportunity

unless otherwise noted.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its

spell-like abilities.

SWIFT ACTIONS

The  Miniatures  Handbook  introduced  the  concept  of  a  new

action  type:  the  swift  action.  This  game  concept  is  not  re-

stricted to miniatures play and can be utilized in a regular D&D

roleplaying game. The Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat in Monster

Manual III and some feats, spells, and items in future DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS supplements will use this concept. A description of

how it works follows.

Swift Action: A swift action consumes a very small amount

of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy

than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn

without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that

regard,  a  swift  action  is  like  a  free  action.  However,  you  can

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what

other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time you

would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions

usually involve spellcasting or the activation of magic items;

many characters (especially those who dont cast spells) never

have an opportunity to take a swift action.

Casting a quickened spell is a swift action (instead of a free

action, as stated in the Quicken Spell feat description in the

Players Handbook). Likewise, using a quickened spell-like ability

is a swift action.

Casting a spell or using a spell-like ability with a casting time

of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Glossary

This section of  Monster Manual III provides definitions

and  descriptions  of  monster  characteristics.  If  you  have

come across a term used earlier in this book that youre not

familiar with, this is the place to  nd out more.

Aberration Type: An aberration has a bizarre anatomy,

strange abilities, an alien mind-set, or any combination of

the three.

Features: An aberration has the following features.

d8 Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good Will saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An aberration possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Proficient  with  its  natural  weapons.  If  generally

humanoid in form, pro cient with all simple weapons and

any weapon it is described as using.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Aberrations are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.

Ability  Score  Loss  (Su):  Some  attacks  reduce  the

opponents score in one or more abilities. This loss can be

temporary (ability damage) or permanent (ability drain).

Ability Damage: This attack damages an opponents ability

score. The creatures descriptive text gives the ability and the

amount of damage. If an attack that causes ability damage

scores a critical hit, it deals twice the indicated amount of

damage (if the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two

dice). Ability damage returns at the rate of 1 point per day

for each affected ability.

Ability  Drain:  This  effect  permanently  reduces  a  living

opponents ability score when the creature hits with a melee

attack. The creatures descriptive text gives the ability and

the  amount  drained.  If  an  attack  that  causes  ability  drain

scores a critical hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if

the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two dice). Unless

otherwise speci ed in the creatures description, a draining

creature  gains  5  temporary  hit  points  (10  on  a  critical  hit)

whenever  it  drains  an  ability  score  no  matter  how  many

points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this fashion

last for a maximum of 1 hour.

Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 draining creatures racial HD + draining creatures Cha

modi er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive

text). If no saving throw is mentioned, none is allowed.

Air Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals

and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane

Air. Air creatures always have  y speeds and usually have

perfect  maneuverability  (see  the  section  on  Movement,

page 216).

Alignment: This line in a monster entry gives the align-

ment that the creature is most likely to have. Every entry

includes a quali er that indicates how broadly that alignment

applies to all monsters of that kind.

Always:  The  creature  is  born  with  the  indicated  align-

ment. The creature may have a hereditary predisposition to

the alignment or come from a plane that predetermines it.

It is possible for individuals to change alignment, but such

individuals are either unique or rare exceptions.

Usually: The majority (more than 50%) of these creatures

have the given alignment. This may be due to strong cul-

tural in uences, or it may be a legacy of the creatures origin.

For example, most elves inherited their chaotic good align-

ment from their creator, the deity Corellon Larethian.

Often: The creature tends toward the given alignment,

either by nature or nurture, but not strongly. A plurality

(4050%)  of  individuals  have  the  given  alignment,  but

exceptions are common.

Animal Type: An animal is a living, nonhuman creature,

usually a vertebrate with no magical abilities and no innate

capacity for language or culture.

Features: An animal has the following features (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

d8 Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good Fortitude and Re ex saves (certain animals have

different good saves).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits:  An  animal  possesses  the  following  traits  (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intel-

ligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).

Low-light vision.

Alignment: Always neutral.

Treasure: None.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only. A noncomba-

tive herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary attack.

Such attacks are made with a 5 penalty on the creatures

attack rolls, and the animal receives only 1/2 its Strength

modi er as a damage adjustment.

Pro cient with no armor unless trained for war.

Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.

Aquatic  Subtype:  Creatures  with  the  aquatic  subtype

always have swim speeds and thus can move in water with-

out making Swim checks. An aquatic creature can breathe

underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the

amphibious special quality.

Augmented Subtype: A creature receives this subtype

whenever something happens to change its original type.

Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born

with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an

acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired

with  the  creatures  original  type.  For  example,  a  wizards

raven  familiar  is  a  magical  beast  (augmented  animal).  A

creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits

of its current type, but the features of its original type. For

example, a wizards raven familiar has an animals features

and the traits of a magical beast.

Blindsense  (Ex):  Using  nonvisual  senses,  such  as  acute

smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things

it  cannot  see.  The  creature  usually  does  not  need  to  make

Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of a creature

within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line

of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot

see still has total concealment against the creature with blind-

sense, and the creature still has the normal miss chance when

attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects

the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with

blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class

against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

Blindsight (Ex): This ability is similar to blindsense,

but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as

sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echo-

location, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and  ghts as

well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most

kinds  of  concealment  are  irrelevant,  though  the  creature

must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that

creature or object. The abilitys range is speci ed in the crea-

tures descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to

make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range

of its blindsight ability. Unless otherwise noted, blindsight

is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it.

Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a

free action. If so, this is noted in the creatures description.

If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature

gains the bene ts of blindsight only during its turn.

Breath Weapon (Su): A breath weapon attack usually deals

damage and is often based on some type of energy (such as

 re). Such breath weapons allow a Re ex save for half damage

(DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creatures racial HD + breathing crea-

tures  Con  modi er;  the  exact  DC  is  given  in  the  creatures

descriptive  text).  A  creature  is  immune  to  its  own  breath

weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath weapons allow

a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a Re ex save.

Change Shape (Su): A creature with this special quality

has the ability to assume the appearance of a speci c crea-

ture  or  type  of  creature  (usually  a  humanoid),  but  retains

most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change

shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger

than its original form. Changing shape results in the follow-

ing changes to the creature:

The creature retains the type and subtype of its original

form. It gains the size of its new form.

The  creature  loses  the  natural  weapons,  movement

modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.

The  creature  gains  the  natural  weapons,  movement

modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.

The  creature  retains  all  other  special  attacks  and

qualities  of  its  original  form,  except  for  breath  weapons

and gaze attacks.

The  creature  retains  the  ability  scores  of  its  original

form.

The creature retains its hit points and saves.

The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in

its original form, although it must be able to speak intelligi-

bly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have

humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic components.

The creature is effectively camou aged as a creature of

its new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if it

uses this ability to create a disguise.

Chaotic Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to out-

siders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most crea-

tures  that  have  this  subtype  also  have  chaotic  alignments;

however, if their alignments change they still retain the sub-

type. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature

with this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic alignment,

no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also

suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature

with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if

its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-

aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).

Class Skills: Any skill in which a monster has acquired

at least one rank or in which the creature has a racial bonus

is  considered  a  class  skill  for  that  kind  of  creature.  Some

monsters, such as the true dragons, have their class skills

explicitly listed. Other monsters class skills can be deter-

mined from their statistics blocks.

Creatures with a Swim speed always have Swim as a class

skill. Creatures with a Climb speed always have Climb as a

class skill. Skills listed in an entry merely because of syn-

ergy with another skill are not class skills. For example, a

ssvaklors class skills are Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

Survival  and  Swim.  It  has  other  skill  modi ers,  such  as

Diplomacy,  Disguise  and  Intimidate,  that  are  due  to  syn-

ergy  bene ts  granted  by  other  skills.  The  statistics  block

also includes a Jump modi er due to its speed, even though

Jump is not a class skill for the creature.

Cold Subtype: A creature with the cold subtype has

immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to  re, which means

it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

 re, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the

save is a success or failure.

Constrict (Ex): A creature with this special attack can

crush  an  opponent,  dealing  bludgeoning  damage,  after

making a successful grapple check. The amount of damage

is given in the creatures entry. If the creature also has the

improved grab ability (see page 214), it deals constriction

damage in addition to damage dealt by the weapon used

to grab.

Construct  Type:  A  construct  is  an  animated  object  or

arti cially constructed creature.

Features: A construct has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

No good saving throws.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit  Die,  with  quadruple  skill  points  for  the   rst  Hit  Die,

if  the  construct  has  an  Intelligence  score.  However,  most

constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: A construct possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

No Constitution score.

Low-light vision.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity  to  all  mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities

(charms,  compulsions,  phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale

effects).

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and necromancy effects.

Cannot  heal  damage  on  their  own,  but  often  can  be

repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see

the creatures description for details) or through the use of

the Craft Construct feat (see page 206). A construct with the

fast healing special quality still bene ts from that quality.

Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability

damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save

(unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).

Not  at  risk  of  death  from  massive  damage  (see  page

145 of the Players Handbook). Immediately destroyed when

reduced to 0 hit points or less.

Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised

or resurrected.

Because  its  body  is  a  mass  of  unliving  matter,  a  con-

struct is hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based on

size, as shown on the following table.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only, unless gener-

ally humanoid in form, in which case pro cient with any

weapon mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with no armor.

Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.

Damage Reduction (Ex or Su): A creature with this spe-

cial quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural

attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off

harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack was

ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy

attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like abilities,

and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of weapon can

sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted below.

The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usu-

ally 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the

ability. For example, the werewolfs entry reads damage

reduction 10/silver: Each time a foe hits a werewolf with

a weapon, the damage dealt by that attack is reduced by 10

points (to a minimum of 0). However, a silvered weapon

deals full damage.

Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or

slashing damage. For example, the plague spewer has damage

reduction 10/slashing. When hit with bludgeoning or pierc-

ing weapons, the damage dealt by each attack is reduced by

5 points, but slashing weapons deal full damage.

Some  monsters  are  vulnerable  to  certain  materials,  such

as alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron. Attacks

from weapons that are not made of the correct material have

their damage reduced, even if the weapon has an enhance-

ment  bonus.  Examples:  the  war  trolls  damage  reduction

5/adamantine, the young redcaps damage reduction 5/cold

iron, and the splinterwaifs damage reduction 5/silver.

Some  monsters  are  vulnerable  to  magic  weapons.  Any

weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack

and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduction of these

monsters. Such creatures natural weapons (but not their attacks

with weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. For example, the ssvaklor has

damage reduction 10/magic and can strike as a magic weapon

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or

lawful-aligned weapons. When a cleric casts align weapon,

affected weapons might gain one or more of these proper-

ties,  and  certain  magic  weapons  have  these  properties  as

well. For example, many tanarri demons and baatezu devils

have damage reduction 10/good, while the prismatic golem

has damage reduction 10/evil. A creature with an alignment

subtype  (chaotic,  evil,  good,  or  lawful)  can  overcome  this

type  of  damage  reduction  with  its  natural  weapons  and

weapons it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had

an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of

the creature. An arrow demon, for instance, has the chaotic

and evil subtypes, and thus can overcome damage reduction

as if its weapons and natural weapons were chaotic-aligned

and evil-aligned.

When a damage reduction entry has a dash () after the

slash, no weapon overcomes the damage reduction.

A  few  creatures  are  harmed  by  more  than  one  kind  of

weapon. The bonedrinker, for example, has damage reduc-

tion  5/silver  or  good.  Either  kind  of  weaponsilver  or

goodovercomes its damage reduction.

A few other creatures require combinations of different

types of attacks to overcome their damage reduction. The

sorrowsworn  demon  has  damage  reduction  10/cold  irn

and good, meaning that a weapon must be made of cold-

forged iron and be good-aligned in order to overcome the

demons damage reduction. A shadesteel golem has damage

reduction 10/adamantine and magic, meaning that only

adamantine weapons with at least a +1 enhancement bonus

deal full damage to it. A weapon that falls into one category

but not the other is of no help in overcoming the creatures

damage reductiona magic sword or a nonmagical mace is

no better at harming a lich than any other weapon.

Darkvision (Ex): A creature with this special ability can

see in the dark, out to the distance given in the creatures

entry. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is other-

wise like normal sight, and a creature with darkvision can

function just  ne with no light at all.

Dragon Type: A dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually

winged, with magical or unusual abilities.

Features: A dragon has the following features.

12-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Fortitude, Re ex, and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (6 + Int modi er) per Hit Die, with

quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits:  A  dragon  possesses  the  following  traits  (unless

otherwise noted in the description of a particular kind).

Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Immunity to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only unless human-

oid  in  form  (or  capable  of  assuming  humanoid  form),  in

which  case  pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any

weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with no armor.

Dragons eat, sleep, and breathe.

Earth Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elemen-

tals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane

of Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and

most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.

Effective  Character  Level  (ECL):  This  number  repre-

sents a creatures overall power relative to that of a character

from the Players Handbook. A creature with an ECL of 10 is

roughly equivalent to a 10th-level character. A creatures ECL

is  the  sum  of  its  Hit  Dice  (including  class  levels)  and  level

adjustment. For instance, a splinterwaif has 2 HD and a +4

level adjustment. It is the equivalent of a 6th-level character.

Elemental Type: An elemental is a being composed of

one of the four classical elements: air, earth,  re, or water.

Features: An elemental has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good saves depend on the element: Fortitude (earth,

water) or Re ex (air,  re).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An elemental possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity  to  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  and

stunning.

Not subject to critical hits or  anking.

Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental does

not have a dual natureits soul and body form one unit.

When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that

restore souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate,

and resurrection, dont work on an elemental. It takes a dif-

ferent magical effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or

true resurrection, to restore it to life.

Pro cient with natural weapons only, unless generally

humanoid in form, in which case pro cient with all simple

weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter

types. Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not

proficient  with  armor.  Elementals  are  proficient  with

shields if they are pro cient with any form of armor.

Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe.

Energy Charge (Su): This ability bestows vital energy at

a touch, and happens automatically when a melee or ranged

attack  hits.  Each  successful  energy  charge  bestows  one  or

more positive levels (the creatures description speci es how

many) on living creatures. Unless otherwise speci ed in the

creatures description, a draining creature loses 5 hit points for

each positive level it bestows. A creature may not have more

positive levels than its Constitution bonus (minimum 1).

An  affected  creature  gains  a  +1  competence  bonus  on

all  skill  checks  and  ability  checks,  attack  rolls,  and  saving

throws,  and  gains  one  effective  level  or  Hit  Die  (whenever

level is used in a die roll or calculation) for each positive level.

A spellcaster gains one spell slot of the highest level of spells

she can cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that level.

These gains persist until the positive level goes away.

Positive levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with

a spell, such as restoration. After 24 hours, the positive level

automatically goes away.

Undead react to positive levels the way nonundead react to

negative levels. An undead character with negative levels at

least equal to its current level is instantly destroyed. After 24

hours, an undead must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 attackers

HD + attackers Cha modi er). (The DC is provided in the

attackers description.) If the saving throw succeeds, the posi-

tive level goes away with no harm to the creature. The af icted

creature makes a separate saving throw for each positive level

it has gained. If the save fails, the positive level goes away, but

the creatures level (or HD) is also reduced by one.

Energy Drain (Su): This attack saps a living opponents

vital  energy  and  happens  automatically  when  a  melee  or

ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows

one or more negative levels (the creatures description speci-

 es how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain

scores a critical hit, it drains twice the given amount. Unless

otherwise speci ed in the creatures description, a draining

creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit)

for  each  negative  level  it  bestows  on  an  opponent.  These

temporary hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour.

An affected opponent takes a 1 penalty on all skill checks

and ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses

one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die

roll or calculation) for each negative level. A spellcaster loses

one spell slot of the highest level of spells she can cast and (if

applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss persists

until the negative level is removed.

Negative  levels  remain  until  24  hours  have  passed  or

until they are removed with a spell, such as restoration. If a

negative level is not removed before 24 hours have passed,

the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 draining creatures racial HD + draining creatures Cha

modi er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive

text). On a success, the negative level goes away with no

harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes

away,  but  the  creatures  level  is  also  reduced  by  one.  A

separate saving throw is required for each negative level.

Environment: This entry in a statistics block describes

the type of climate and terrain where the creature is typically

found. This is a preference, but is not exclusionary. Note that

these environments can also exist in portions of dungeons

due to magical effects or other supernatural interference, or

as features in dungeons or other environment areas.

Any: No preferred environment.

Cold: Arctic and subarctic climes. Any area that has winter-

like conditions for the greater portion of the year.

Temperate: Any area that has alternating warm and cold

seasons.

Warm: Tropical and subtropical climes. Any area that has

summer conditions for the greater portion of the year is warm.

Aquatic: Fresh or salt water.

Deserts: Any dry area with sparse vegetation.

Forests: Any area covered with trees.

Hills: Any area with rugged but not mountainous terrain.

Marshes: Low,  at, waterlogged areas; including swamps.

Mountains:  Rugged  terrain,  with  a  higher  elevation

than hills.

Plains: Any fairly  at area that is not a desert, marsh, or

forest.

Plane Name: An extraplanar creatures home plane.

Underground: Subterranean areas.

Evil Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders

native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also

called  ends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have

evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they

still  retain  the  subtype.  Any  effect  that  depends  on  align-

ment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature

has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually

is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual align-

ment.  A  creature  with  the  evil  subtype  overcomes  damage

reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields

were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).

Extraordinary (Ex) Abilities: Extraordinary abilities are

nonmagical,  dont  become  ineffective  in  an  antimagic   eld,

and are not subject to any effect that disrupts magic. Using an

extraordinary ability is a free action unless otherwise noted.

Extraplanar Subtype: A subtype applied to any creature

when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature

that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes

from  plane  to  plane.  This  book  assumes  that  encounters

with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every

creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the

extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home

plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home

plane mentioned in its description. These home planes are

taken from the Great Wheel cosmology of the D&D game

(see Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). If your cam-

paign  uses  a  different  cosmology,  you  will  need  to  assign

different home planes to extraplanar creatures.

Creatures  not  labeled  as  extraplanar  are  natives  of  the

Material  Plane,  and  they  gain  the  extraplanar  subtype  if

they  leave  the  Material  Plane.  No  creature  has  the  extra-

planar subtype when it is on a transitive plane; the transi-

tive planes in the D&D cosmology are the Astral Plane, the

Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.

Fast Healing (Ex): A creature with the fast healing special

quality regains hit points at an exceptionally fast rate, usually

1 or more hit points per round, as given in the creatures entry

(for example, a cave troll has fast healing 8). Except where noted

here, fast healing is just like natural healing (see page 146 of the

Players Handbook). Fast healing does not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a

creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated,

it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached.

Favored  Class:  A  monster  that  takes  levels  in  a  class

(or more than one class) has a favored class, just as player

characters do. In addition, a monsters racial Hit Dice also

count as a favored class, in effect: If the monster becomes a

multiclass character, neither its favored class nor its racial

Hit  Dice  count  when  determining  whether  the  creature

takes an experience point penalty.

Fear (Su or Sp): Fear attacks can have various effects.

Fear Aura (Su): The use of this ability is a free action. The

aura can freeze an opponent (such as a mummys despair) or

function like the fear spell (for example, the aura of a lich).

Other effects are possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The

descriptive text gives the size and kind of area.

Fear Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su): These effects usually work

like the fear spell.

If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC

10 + 1/2 fearsome creatures racial HD + creatures Cha modi-

 er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive text).

All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.

Fey Type: A fey is a creature with supernatural abilities

and connections to nature or to some other force or place.

Fey are usually human-shaped.

Features: A fey has the following features.

6-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).

Good Re ex and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (6 + Int modi er) per Hit Die, with

quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

7/13/04   5:44:23 PM

Traits: A fey possesses the following traits (unless other-

wise noted in a creatures entry).

Low-light vision.

Pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any  weapons

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter

types. Fey not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient

with armor. Fey are pro cient with shields if they are pro -

cient with any form of armor.

Fey eat, sleep, and breathe.

Fire  Subtype:  A  creature  with  the  fire  subtype  has

immunity to  re. It has vulnerability to cold, which means

it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if

the save is a success or failure.

Frightful  Presence  (Ex):  This  special  quality  makes  a

creatures  very  presence  unsettling  to  foes.  It  takes  effect

automatically  when  the  creature  performs  some  sort  of

dramatic action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling).

Opponents  within  range  who  witness  the  action  may

become frightened or shaken.

Actions  required  to  trigger  the  ability  are  given  in  the

creatures descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, and

the duration is usually 5d6 rounds.

This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice

or levels than the creature has. An affected opponent can

resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2

frightful  creatures  racial  HD  +  frightful  creatures  Cha

modi er; the exact DC is given in the creatures descrip-

tive text). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw

is immune to that same creatures frightful presence for 24

hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Gaze (Su): A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents

look at the creatures eyes. The attack can have almost any sort

of effect: petri cation, death, charm, and so on. The typical

range is 30 feet, but check the creatures entry for details.

The type of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is

usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing crea-

tures racial HD + gazing creatures Cha modi er; the exact

DC is given in the creatures descriptive text). A successful

saving throw negates the effect. A monsters gaze attack is

described in abbreviated form in its description.

Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt

a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn

in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with

a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can

avoid the need to make the saving throw by not looking at

the creature, in one of two ways.

Averting  Eyes:  The  opponent  avoids  looking  at  the  crea-

tures face, instead looking at its body, watching its shadow,

tracking  it  in  a  re ective  surface,  and  so  on.  Each  round,

the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a saving

throw against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze

attack, however, gains concealment against that opponent.

Wearing a Blindfold: The opponent cannot see the creature

at all (also possible to achieve by turning ones back on the

creature or shutting ones eyes). The creature with the gaze

attack gains total concealment against the opponent.

A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack

action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must

attempt a saving throw but can try to avoid this as described

above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save against a

creatures gaze twice during the same round, once before the

opponents action and once during the creatures turn.

Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature

is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless oth-

erwise noted. Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might

be  affected.  All  the  creatures  allies  are  considered  to  be

averting their eyes from the creature with the gaze attack,

and have a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw

against  the  gaze  attack  each  round.  The  creature  also  can

veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.

Giant Type: A giant is a humanoid-shaped creature of

great strength, usually of at least Large size.

Features: A giant has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good Fortitude saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: A giant possesses the following traits (unless other-

wise noted in a creatures entry).

Low-light vision.

Pro cient with all simple and martial weapons, as well

as any natural weapons.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium

or  heavy)  it  is  described  as  wearing,  as  well  as  all  lighter

types. Giants not described as wearing armor are not pro -

cient with armor. Giants are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Giants eat, sleep, and breathe.

Goblinoid Subtype: Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids

who live by hunting and raiding and who all speak Goblin.

Good Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsid-

ers native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures

that have this subtype also have good alignments; however,

if  their  alignments  change,  they  still  retain  the  subtype.

Any  effect  that  depends  on  alignment  affects  a  creature

with this subtype as if the creature has a good alignment,

no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also

suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature

with  the  good  subtype  overcomes  damage  reduction  as  if

its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were good-

aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).

Humanoid Type: A humanoid usually has two arms,

two  legs,  and  one  head,  or  a  humanlike  torso,  arms,

and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or

extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually

have  well-developed  societies.  They  usually  are  Small  or

Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype, such

as elf, goblinoid, or reptilian.

Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their

humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class.

Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors,

which means that they have average combat ability and poor

saving throws.

Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die (for example, gnolls

and bugbears) are the only humanoids who make use of the

features of the humanoid type.

Features: A humanoid has the following features (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good  Re ex  saves  (usually;  a  humanoids  good  save

varies).

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, or

by character class.

Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Pro cient with all simple weapons, or by character class.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class. If a

humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is pro -

cient with that type of armor and all lighter types. Human-

oids not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient with

armor.  Humanoids  are  pro cient  with  shields  if  they  are

pro cient with any form of armor.

Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.

Immunity: A creature that has immunity to an effect is

never harmed (or helped) by that effect. A creature cannot

suppress an immunity in order to receive a bene cial effect.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a creature with this special attack

hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it

deals  normal  damage  and  attempts  to  start  a  grapple  as  a

free action without provoking attacks of opportunity (see

Grapple, page 155 of the Players Handbook). No initial touch

attack is required.

Unless  otherwise  noted,  improved  grab  works  only

against opponents at least one size category smaller than

the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used

in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to

do the latter, it takes a 20 penalty on grapple checks, but is

not considered grappled itself; the creature does not lose its

Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use

its remaining attacks against other opponents.

A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless

the  creature  also  has  the  constrict  special  attack.  If  the

creature does not constrict, each successful grapple check

it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the

damage indicated for the attack that established the hold.

Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well (the amount

is given in the creatures descriptive text).

When  a  creature  gets  a  hold  after  an  improved  grab

attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can even move (pos-

sibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the

opponents weight.

Incorporeal Subtype: Some creatures are incorporeal

by nature, while others (such as those that become ghosts)

can acquire the incorporeal subtype. An incorporeal crea-

ture has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other

incorporeal  creatures,  magic  weapons  or  creatures  that

strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or

supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack

forms. Even when hit by spells, including touch spells, or

magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative

energy, force effects such as magic missile, or attacks made

with  ghost  touch  weapons).  Nondamaging  spell  effects

affect  incorporeal  creatures  normally  unless  they  require

corporeal  targets  to  function  (such  as  implosion)  or  they

create  a  corporeal  effect  that  incorporeal  creatures  would

normally  be  unaffected  by  (such  as  a  web  or  wall  of  stone

spell).  Although  it  is  not  a  magical  attack,  holy  water  can

affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a

50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal creature.

An incorporeal creatures attacks pass through (ignore) nat-

ural armor, armor, and shields, although de ection bonuses

and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against

it. Nonmagical attacks made by an incorporeal creature with

a melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any

melee  attack  an  incorporeal  creature  makes  with  a  magic

weapon  against  a  corporeal  target  has  a  50%  miss  chance,

except for attacks it makes with a ghost touch weapon, while

are made normally (no miss chance).

Any equipment worn or carried by an incorporeal creature

is also incorporeal as long as it remains in the creatures pos-

session. An object that the creature relinquishes loses its incor-

poreal quality (and the creature loses the ability to manipulate

the object). If an incorporeal creature uses a thrown weapon

or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon

as it is  red and can affect a corporeal target normally (no miss

chance). Magic items possessed by an incorporeal creature

work normally with respect to their effects on the creature

or on another target. Similarly, spells cast by an incorporeal

creature affect corporeal creatures normally.

An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but

has a de ection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always

at  least  +1,  even  if  the  creatures  Charisma  score  does  not

normally provide a bonus).

An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid

objects,  but  must  remain  adjacent  to  the  objects  exterior,

and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space

is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures

or objects within a square adjacent to its current location,

but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from

an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to

see farther from the object it is in and attack normally, the

incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature

inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a crea-

ture outside the object it only has cover, so a creature out-

side with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An

incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.

Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water

as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall

or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make

trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled.

In  fact,  they  cannot  take  any  physical  action  that  would

move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are

they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no

weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.

An  incorporeal  creature  moves  silently  and  cannot  be

heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be. It has no

Strength score, so its Dexterity modi er applies to both its

melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such

as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly

effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal

creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at

full speed even when they cannot see.

Lawful:  A  subtype  usually  applied  only  to  outsiders

native  to  the  lawful-aligned  Outer  Planes.  Most  creatures

that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however,

if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype.

Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature

with this subtype as if the creature has a lawful alignment,

no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also

suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature

with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if

its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-

aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).

Level  Adjustment:  Certain  monsters  can  used  as  the

basis for interesting, viable player characters. These crea-

tures  have  a  level  adjustment  entry,  which  is  a  number

that is added to the creatures total Hit Dice to arrive at its

effective  character  level.  A  creature  with  multiple  special

abilities is more powerful as a player character than its Hit

Dice alone would indicate. For example, a drow elf has spell

resistance, bonuses to its ability scores, and spell-like abili-

ties. Its level adjustment of +2 indicates that a 1st-level drow

wizard is the equivalent of a 3rd-level character.

Some creatures level adjustment entries include the word

(cohort). Although these creatures may be problematic as

PCs, they make good companions for a character who has

taken  the  Leadership  feat.  Some  other  creatures  arent

intended for use as PCs or cohorts but can become compan-

ions through the use of the Improved Familiar feat. In these

cases, the level adjustment entry is a dash followed by the

words (Improved Familiar).

Level adjustment is not the same thing as an adjustment

to  a  creatures  Challenge  Rating  because  of  some  special

qualities it possesses. Challenge Rating re ects how dif -

cult an opponent is to  ght in a limited number of encoun-

ters. Level adjustment shows how powerful a creature is as

a player character or cohort in campaign play. For instance,

a drow receives a +1 adjustment to its Challenge Rating to

account for its special abilities, indicating that its tougher in

a  ght than its Hit Dice would suggest, but its level adjust-

ment is +2 to balance its abilities over long-term play.

Living: Any creature with a Constitution score is a living

creature. Constructs and undead are not living creatures.

Living Construct Subtype: A living construct is a new

subtype of construct, a created being given sentience and free

will through powerful and complex creation enchantments.

Living constructs combine aspects of both constructs and

living creatures, as detailed below.

Features:  A  living  construct  derives  its  Hit  Dice,  base

attack  bonus  progression,  saving  throws,  and  skill  points

from the class it selects.

Traits:  A  living  construct  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Unlike other constructs, a living construct has a Consti-

tution score. A living construct does not gain bonus hit points

by size but gains (or loses) bonus hit points through a Consti-

tution bonus (or penalty) as with other living creatures.

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  does  not

have low-light vision or darkvision.

Unlike  other  constructs,  a  living  construct  is  not

immune to mind-in uencing effects.

Immunity  to  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  disease,

nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, and energy drain.

A living construct cannot heal damage naturally.

Unlike other constructs, living constructs are subject

to critical hits, effects requiring a Fort save, death from mas-

sive damage, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage,

ability drain, and death effects or necromancy effects.

Unlike other constructs, a living construct can use the

run action.

Living constructs can be affected by spells that target

living creatures as well as by those that target constructs.

Damage dealt to a living construct can be healed by a cure

light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example,

and a living construct is vulnerable to a harm spell. How-

ever,  spells  from  the  healing  subschool  provide  only  half

effect to a living construct.

A living construct responds slightly differently from

other  living  creatures  when  reduced  to  0  hit  points.  A

living  construct  with  0  hit  points  is  disabled,  just  like  a

living  creature.  He  can  only  take  a  single  move  action  or

standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does

not  risk  further  injury.  When  his  hit  points  are  less  than

0  and  greater  than  10,  a  living  construct  is  inert.  He  is

unconscious  and  helpless,  and  he  cannot  perform  any

actions.  However,  an  inert  living  construct  does  not  lose

additional hit points unless more damage is dealt to him, as

with a living creature that is stable.

Can be raised or resurrected.

Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but can still ben-

e t from the effects of consumable spells and magic items

such as heroes feast and potions.

Does not need to sleep, but must rest for 8 hours before

preparing spells.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): A creature with low-light vision

can  see  twice  as  far  as  a  human  in  starlight,  moonlight,

torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination.

It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under

these conditions.

Magical Beast Type: Magical beasts are similar to ani-

mals but can have Intelligence scores higher than 2. Magical

beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary abilities,

but sometimes are merely bizarre in appearance or habits.

Features: A magical beast has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Fortitude and Re ex saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits:  A  magical  beast  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Magical beasts eat, sleep, and breathe.

Manufactured  Weapons:  Some  monsters  employ

manufactured  weapons  when  they  attack.  Creatures  that

use swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules

as characters, including those for additional attacks from a

high base attack bonus and two-weapon  ghting penalties.

This  category  also  includes  found  items,  such  as  rocks

and logs, that a creature wields in combatin essence, any

weapon that is not intrinsic to the creature.

Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manu-

factured weapons when they make a full attack. When they

do  so,  the  manufactured  weapon  attack  is  considered  the

primary  attack  unless  the  creatures  description  indicates

otherwise (using the manufactured weapon consumes most

of  the  creatures  attention),  and  any  natural  weapons  the

creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks.

These secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary

attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they

take the usual 5 penalty (or 2 with the Multiattack feat)

for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is normally

the creatures primary natural weapon.

Monstrous  Humanoid  Type:  Monstrous  humanoids

are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or animalistic

features. They often have magical abilities as well.

Features: A monstrous humanoid has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Re ex and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits:  A  monstrous  humanoid  possesses  the  following

traits (unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Pro cient  with  all  simple  weapons  and  any  weapons

mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Monstrous humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not

pro cient with armor. Monstrous humanoids are pro cient

with shields if they are pro cient with any form of armor.

Monstrous humanoids eat, sleep, and breathe.

Movement Modes: Creatures may have modes of move-

ment other than walking and running. These are natural, not

magical, unless speci cally noted in a monster description.

Burrow:  A  creature  with  a  burrow  speed  can  tunnel

through dirt, but not through rock unless the descriptive

text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run while

burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind

tunnels other creatures can use (either because the material

they tunnel through  lls in behind them or because they

do not actually dislocate any material when burrowing); see

the individual creature descriptions for details.

Climb: A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus

on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check

to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it

always can choose to take 10 (see Checks without Rolls, page

65 of the Players Handbook), even if rushed or threatened while

climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed while climb-

ing. If it chooses an accelerated climb (see the Climb skill,

page 69 of the Players Handbook), it moves at double the given

climb speed (or its base land speed, whichever is lower) and

makes a single Climb check at a 5 penalty. Creatures cannot

run while climbing. A creature retains its Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no

special bonus on their attacks against a climbing creature.

Fly: A creature with a  y speed can move through the air

at the indicated speed if carrying no more than a light load;

see Carrying Capacity, page 161 of the Players Handbook.

(Note that medium armor does not necessarily constitute a

medium load.) All  y speeds include a parenthetical note

indicating maneuverability, as follows:

Perfect:  The  creature  can  perform  almost  any  aerial

maneuver  it  wishes.  It  moves  through  the  air  as  well  as  a

human moves over smooth ground.

Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a house-

 y or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as read-

ily as those with perfect maneuverability.

Average: The creature can  y as adroitly as a small bird.

Poor: The creature  ies as well as a very large bird.

Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.

A creature that  ies can make dive attacks. A dive attack

works just like a charge, but the diving creature must move a

minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make

only claw or talon attacks, but these deal double damage. A

creature can use the run action while  ying, provided it  ies

in a straight line.

For  more  information,  see  Tactical  Aerial  Movement,

page 20 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Swim: A creature with a swim speed can move through

water  at  its  swim  speed  without  making  Swim  checks.  It

has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some

special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.  The  creature  can  always

can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted

or endangered. The creature can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Native Subtype: A subtype applied only to outsiders. These

creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to

the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resur-

rected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with

this  subtype  are  native  to  the  Material  Plane  (hence  the

subtypes name).

Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.

Natural  Weapons:  Natural  weapons  are  weapons  that

are physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee

attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise, it threatens

any space it can reach.

Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base

attack bonus when using natural weapons. The number of

attacks a creature can make with its natural weapons depends

on the type of the attackgenerally, a creature can make one

bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack,

one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures

with arms or armlike limbs can make a slam attack with each

arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.

Unless  otherwise  noted,  a  natural  weapon  threatens  a

critical hit on a natural attack roll of 20.

When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of

them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary weapon.

All the creatures remaining natural weapons are secondary.

The primary weapon is given in the creatures Attack entry,

and the primary weapon or weapons is given  rst in the crea-

tures Full Attack entry. A creatures primary natural weapon is

its most effective natural attack, usually by virtue of the crea-

tures physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon.

An attack with a primary natural weapon uses the creatures

full attack bonus. Attacks with secondary natural weapons are

less effective and are made with a 5 penalty on the attack roll,

no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the Multiattack

feat take only a 2 penalty on secondary attacks.)

Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The

most common are summarized below.

Bite: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing pierc-

ing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.

Claw or Talon: The creature rips with a sharp appendage,

dealing piercing and slashing damage.

Gore:  The  creature  spears  the  opponent  with  an  antler,

horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.

Slap  or  Slam:  The  creature  batters  opponents  with  an

appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.

Sting: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing

damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in

addition to hit point damage.

Tentacle: The creature  ails at opponents with a powerful ten-

tacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores.

These creatures do not have an ability score of 0they lack

the  ability  altogether.  The  modi er  for  a  nonability  is  +0.

Other effects of nonabilities are detailed below.

Strength:  Any  creature  that  can  physically  manipulate

other objects has at least 1 point of Strength.

A creature with no Strength score cant exert force, usu-

ally because it has no physical body (a prismatic golem, for

example). The creature automatically fails Strength checks.

If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modi er to

its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modi er.

Dexterity: Any creature that can move has at least 1 point

of Dexterity.

A creature with no Dexterity score cant move. If it can

perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its Intel-

ligence modi er to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity

modi er. The creature automatically fails Re ex saves and

Dexterity checks.

Constitution: Any living creature has at least 1 point of

Constitution.

A creature with no Constitution has no body (a vasuthant,

for example) or no metabolism (a gloom golem). It is immune

to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect

works on objects or is harmless. For example, a zombie is

unaffected by any type of poison but is susceptible to a disin-

tegrate spell. The creature is also immune to ability damage,

ability drain, and energy drain, and automatically fails Con-

stitution  checks.  A  creature  with  no  Constitution  cannot

tire and thus can run inde nitely without tiring (unless the

creatures description says it cannot run).

Intelligence: Any creature that can think, learn, or remem-

ber has at least 1 point of Intelligence.

A  creature  with  no  Intelligence  score  (such  as  a  shred-

storm)  is  mindless,  an  automaton  operating  on  simple

instincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to

mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) and automatically

fails Intelligence checks.

Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although

they may have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.

Wisdom: Any creature that can perceive its environment

in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.

Anything  with  no  Wisdom  score  is  an  object,  not  a

creature.  Anything  without  a  Wisdom  score  also  has  no

Charisma score.

Charisma: Any creature capable of telling the difference

between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1

point of Charisma.

Anything  with  no  Charisma  score  is  an  object,  not  a

creature.  Anything  without  a  Charisma  score  also  has  no

Wisdom score.

Ooze Type: An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature,

usually mindless.

Features: An ooze has the following features.

10-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

No good saving throws.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the ooze has an Intelligence score. However, most oozes are

mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: An ooze possesses the following traits (unless oth-

erwise noted in a creatures entry).

Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all

mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

Blind  (but  have  the  blindsight  special  quality),  with

immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other

attack forms that rely on sight.

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph,

and stunning.

Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to objects.

In such a case, the amount of damage is equal to 10 + 1/2

oozes HD + oozes Con modi er per full round of contact.

Not subject to critical hits or  anking.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.

Outsider Type: An outsider is at least partially composed

of  the  essence  (but  not  necessarily  the  material)  of  some

plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start

out  as  some  other  type  and  become  outsiders  when  they

attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.

Features: An outsider has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as  ghter).

Good Fortitude, Re ex, and Will saves.

Skill points equal to (8 + Int modi er) per Hit Die, with

quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die.

Traits: An outsider possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Unlike  most  other  living  creatures,  an  outsider  does

not have a dual natureits soul and body form one unit.

When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that

restore souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate,

and resurrection, dont work on an outsider. It takes a dif-

ferent magical effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or

true resurrection to restore it to life. An outsider with the

native subtype (see page 217) can be raised, reincarnated, or

resurrected just as other living creatures can be.

Pro cient with all simple and martial weapons and any

weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or  heavy)  it  is  described  as  wearing,  as  well  as  all  lighter

types.  Outsiders  not  indicated  as  wearing  armor  are  not

pro cient with armor. Outsiders are pro cient with shields

if they are pro cient with any form of armor.

Outsiders  breathe,  but  do  not  need  to  eat  or  sleep

(although they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders

breathe, eat, and sleep.

character can usually resist it with a Fortitude saving throw

(the DC is given in the creatures description). Unlike hold

person and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow

a new save each round. A winged creature  ying in the air

at the time that it is paralyzed cannot  ap its wings and falls.

A swimmer cant swim and may drown.

Plant Type: This type comprises vegetable creatures.

Note  that  regular  plants,  such  as  one  finds  growing  in

gardens and  elds, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see

Nonabilities, above) and are not creatures, but objects, even

though they are alive.

Features: A plant creature has the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good Fortitude saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if the

plant creature has an Intelligence score. However, some plant

creatures are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits:  A  plant  creature  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Low-light vision.

Immunity to all mind-affecting spells or abilities (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph,

and stunning.

Not subject to critical hits.

Pro cient with its natural weapons only.

Pro cient with no armor.

Plants breathe and eat, but do not sleep.

Poison  (Ex):  Poison  attacks  deal  initial  damage,  such

as ability damage (see page 208) or some other effect, to the

opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted,

another saving throw is required 1 minute later (regardless of

the  rst saves result) to avoid secondary damage. A creatures

descriptive text provides the details.

A  creature  with  a  poison  attack  is  immune  to  its  own

poison and the poison of others of its kind.

The Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to

10 + 1/2 poisoning creatures racial HD + poisoning creatures

Con modi er (the exact DC is given in the creatures descrip-

tive text). A successful save avoids (negates) the damage.

Pounce  (Ex):  When  a  creature  with  this  special  attack

makes a charge, it can follow with a full attackincluding

rake attacks if the creature also has the rake ability.

Psionics (Sp): These are spell-like abilities that a creature

generates with the power of its mind.  The saving throw (if

any) against a psionic ability is 10 + the level of the spell the

ability resembles or duplicates + the creatures Cha modi er.

Paralysis  (Ex  or  Su):  This  special  attack  renders  the

victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak,

or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the

spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a

Racial Hit Dice: The Hit Dice a monster has by virtue

of what type of creature it is. Hit Dice gained from taking

class levels are not racial Hit Dice. For example, the armand

warden described in this book is a 9 HD creature because of

its four levels of monk, but it has 5 racial Hit Dice (the same

number as a typical armand without any class levels).

Rake (Ex): A creature with this special attack gains extra

natural attacks when it grapples its foe. Normally, a mon-

ster can attack with only one of its natural weapons while

grappling, but a monster with the rake ability usually gains

two additional claw attacks that it can use only against a

grappled foe. Rake attacks are not subject to the usual 4

penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple.

A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grap-

pling to use its rakeit cant begin a grapple and rake in the

same turn.

Ray (Su or Sp): This form of special attack works like a

ranged attack (see Aiming a Spell, page 175 of the Players

Handbook). Hitting with a ray attack requires a successful

ranged  touch  attack  roll,  ignoring  armor,  natural  armor,

and shield and using the creatures ranged attack bonus. Ray

attacks have no range increment. The creatures descriptive

text  speci es  the  maximum  range,  effects,  and  any  appli-

cable saving throw.

Regeneration (Ex): A creature with this ability is dif-

 cult  to  kill.  Damage  dealt  to  the  creature  is  treated  as

nonlethal  damage.  The  creature  automatically  heals  non-

lethal  damage  at  a   xed  rate  per  round,  as  given  in  the

entry (for example, a dread blossom swarm has regenera-

tion 5). Certain attack forms, typically  re and acid, deal

lethal damage to the creature, which doesnt go away. The

creatures descriptive text describes the details.

A regenerating creature that has been rendered unconscious

through nonlethal damage can be killed with a coup de grace

(see page 153 of the Players Handbook). The attack cannot be of

a type that automatically converts to nonlethal damage.

Attack forms that dont deal hit point damage (for example,

most poisons) ignore regeneration. Regeneration also does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.

Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their

bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts; details

are in the creatures descriptive text. Severed parts that are

not reattached wither and die normally.

A  creature  must  have  a  Constitution  score  to  have  the

regeneration ability.

Rend (Ex): If a creature with this special attack hits with

the speci ed natural attack, it latches onto the opponents

body and tears the  esh. A rend attack deals damage equal

to the creatures natural attack + 1-1/2 times its Str modi er.

The creatures descriptive text gives the exact amount.

Reptilian Subtype: These creatures are scaly and usually

cold-blooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe

a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that

are truly reptiles.

time it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold,  re,

or electricity). The entry indicates the amount and type of

damage ignored. For example, a witchknife has resistance to

 re 5, so it ignores the  rst 5 points of  re damage dealt to it

anytime it takes  re damage.

Scent (Ex): This special quality allows a creature to detect

approaching  enemies,  sniff  out  hidden  foes,  and  track  by

sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify

familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense

of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60

feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as

smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges

noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or

troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the

source is not revealedonly its presence somewhere within

range. The creature can take a move action to note the direc-

tion of the scent. Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet

of the source, the creature pinpoints the sources location.

A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can

follow  tracks  by  smell,  making  a  Wisdom  (or  Survival)

check to  nd or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh

trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent).

This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the

quarrys odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the

trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases

by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track

feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface

conditions and poor visibility.

Shapechanger Subtype: A shapechanger has the super-

natural  ability  to  assume  one  or  more  alternate  forms.

Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting,

and  not  every  creature  that  can  change  shapes  has  the

shapechanger subtype.

Traits: A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Pro cient with its natural weapons, with simple weap-

ons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creatures

description.

Pro cient with any armor mentioned in the creatures

description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor

is mentioned, the shapechanger is not pro cient with armor.

A shapechanger is pro cient with shields if it is pro cient

with any type of armor.

Size:  The  nine  size  categories  are  (in  ascending  order)

Fine, Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gar-

gantuan, and Colossal. A creatures size provides a modi er

to its Armor Class and attack bonus, a modi er on grapple

checks it attempts, and a modi er on Hide checks. The Crea-

ture Sizes table on the following page provides a summary

of the attributes that apply to each size category.

Resistance to Energy (Ex): A creature with this special

quality  ignores  some  damage  of  the  indicated  type  each

Sonic Attacks (Su): Unless otherwise noted, a sonic

attack follows the rules for spreads (see Aiming a Spell,

page 175 of the Players Handbook). The range of the spread is

measured from the creature using the sonic attack. Once a

sonic attack has taken effect, deafening the subject or stop-

ping  its  ears  does  not  end  the  effect.  Stopping  ones  ears

ahead  of  time  allows  opponents  to  avoid  having  to  make

saving throws against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not

other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that deal damage).

Stopping ones ears is a full-round action and requires wax

or other soundproof material to stuff into the ears.

Spell-Like (Sp) Abilities: Spell-like abilities are magical

and work just like spells (though they are not spells and so

have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components).

They go away in an antimagic  eld and are subject to spell

resistance  if  the  spell  the  ability  resembles  or  duplicates

would be subject to spell resistance.

A  spell-like  ability  usually  has  a  limit  on  how  often  it

can be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at will has

no use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action

unless otherwise noted, and doing so while threatened pro-

vokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Con-

centration check to use a spell-like ability defensively and

avoid provoking attacks of opportunity, just as when casting

a spell. A spell-like ability can be disrupted just as a spell can

be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor

can they be counterspelled.

For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster

level  de nes  how  dif cult  it  is  to  dispel  their  spell-like

effects and to de ne any level-dependent variables (such as

range and duration) the abilities might have. The creatures

caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the crea-

ture has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the

level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of

the same name. If no caster level is speci ed, the caster level

is equal to the creatures racial Hit Dice.

The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10

+ the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates +

the creatures Cha modi er.

Some  spell-like  abilities  duplicate  spells  that  may  work

differently  or  be  of  a  different  level  when  cast  by  charac-

ters of different classes. A monsters spell-like abilities are

presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in

question is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric,

druid, bard, paladin, and ranger, in that order.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A creature with spell resistance can

avoid the effects of spells and spell-like abilities that directly

affect  it.To  determine  if  a  spell  or  spell-like  ability  works

against a creature with spell resistance, the caster must make

a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result equals or

exceeds  the  creatures  spell  resistance,  the  spell  works  nor-

mally, although the creature is still allowed a saving throw.

Spells: Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or divine spells

just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and can activate

magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the

same spellcasting rules that characters are, except as follows.

A  spellcasting  creature  that  lacks  hands  or  arms  can

provide  any  somatic  component  a  spell  might  require  by

moving  its  body.  Such  a  creature  also  does  need  material

components  for  its  spells.  The  creature  can  cast  the  spell

by either touching the required component (but not if the

component is in another creatures possession) or having the

required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting

creatures utilize the Eschew Materials feat to avoid fussing

with noncostly components.

A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class

unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any class abilities.

For example, a creature that casts arcane spells as a sorcerer

cannot  acquire  a  familiar.  A  creature  with  access  to  cleric

spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives

domain spells if noted, but it does not receive domain granted

powers unless it has at least one level in the cleric class.

Summon (Sp): A creature with the summon ability can

summon speci c other creatures of its kind much as though

casting a summon monster spell, but it usually has only a

limited  chance  of  success  (as  speci ed  in  the  creatures

entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the sum-

mons.  Summoned  creatures  automatically  return  whence

they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been sum-

moned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.

Most  creatures  with  the  ability  to  summon  do  not  use

it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned

creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save

their own lives.

An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning

ability for purposes of Concentration checks and attempts

to dispel the summoned creature. As stated on page 37 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide, no experience points are awarded for

summoned monsters.

Supernatural  (Su)  Abilities:  Supernatural  abilities

are magical and go away in an antimagic  eld but are not

subject to spell resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be

dispelled. Using a supernatural ability is a standard action

unless otherwise noted. Supernatural abilities may have a

use  limit  or  be  usable  at  will,  just  like  spell-like  abilities.

However,  supernatural  abilities  do  not  provoke  attacks

of  opportunity  and  never  require  Concentration  checks.

Unless otherwise noted, a supernatural ability has an effec-

tive caster level equal to the creatures Hit Dice.

The saving throw (if any) against a supernatural ability is

10 + 1/2 the creatures HD + the creatures ability modi er

(usually Charisma).

Swallow  Whole  (Ex):  If  a  creature  with  this  special

attack begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth

(see Improved Grab, page 214), it can attempt a new grapple

check  (as  though  attempting  to  pin  the  opponent).  If  it

succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite

damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up

to one size category smaller than the swallowing creature.

Being swallowed has various consequences, depending on the

creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is consid-

ered to be grappled, while the creature that did the swallowing

is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any

light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage

required to get free is noted in the creature description), or it can

just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of the interior of

a creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural

armor bonus, with no modi ers for size or Dexterity. If the swal-

lowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the

attackers mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

Swarm  Subtype:  A  swarm  is  a  collection  of  Fine,

Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature.

A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted

here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a

single initiative modi er, a single speed, and a single Armor

Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a single creature.

A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of non y-

ing creatures) or a cube (of  ying creatures) 10 feet on a side,

but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order

to attack, it moves into an opponents space, which provokes

attacks of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a crea-

ture of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can

move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa

without impediment, although the swarm provokes attacs of

opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks

or holes large enough for its component creatures.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 non ying crea-

tures or 1,000  ying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive crea-

tures consists of 1,500 non ying creatures or 5,000  ying

creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 crea-

tures, whether they are  ying or not. Swarms of non ying

creatures include many more creatures than could normally

 t in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because

creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and gener-

ally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or

attacking.  Larger  swarms  are  represented  by  multiples  of

single swarms. (A swarm of 15,000 centipedes is ten centi-

pede swarms, each swarm occupying a 10-foot square.) The

area  occupied  by  a  large  swarm  is  completely  shapeable,

though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.

Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no discern-

ible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or  anking.

A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from

slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine

or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage.

Reducing  a  swarm  to  0  hit  points  or  lower  causes  it  to

break  up,  though  damage  taken  until  that  point  does  not

degrade  its  ability  to  attack  or  resist  attack.  Swarms  are

never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also,

they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they

cannot grapple an opponent.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a

speci c number of creatures (including single-target spells

such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting

spells and abilities (charms, compulsions, phantasms, pat-

terns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence

score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much

damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such

as splash weapons and many evocation spells.

Swarms  made  up  of  Diminutive  or  Fine  creatures  are

susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of

wind spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind

on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as

its constituent creatures (see Winds, page 95 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide). For example, a swarm of locusts (a swarm of

Diminutive creatures) can be blown away by a severe wind.

Wind effects deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to a swarm

per  spell  level  (or  Hit  Dice  of  the  originating  creature,  in

the case of effects such as an air elementals whirlwind). A

swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage

becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form

until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.

Swarm  Attack:  Creatures  with  the  swarm  subtype  dont

make  standard  melee  attacks.  Instead,  they  deal  automatic

damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of

their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not

subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarms

statistics  block  has  swarm  in  the  Attack  and  Full  Attack

entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a

swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.

other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or

at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms

also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other special attacks

in addition to normal damage.

Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do

not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack.

However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as

described below.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a swarms

damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is

nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarms

HD + swarms Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a

swarms  description)  negates  the  effect.  Spellcasting  or

concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires

a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills

that  involve  patience  and  concentration  requires  a  DC  20

Concentration check.

Tanarri Subtype: Many demons belong to the race of

evil outsiders known as the tanarri.

Traits:  A  tanarri  possesses  the  following  traits  (unless

otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Immunity to electricity and poison.

Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and  re 10.

Summon (Sp): Tanarri share the ability to summon

others of their kind (the success chance and type of tanarri

summoned are noted in each monster description).

Telepathy.

Telepathic Link (Ex): Creatures with this ability share a

communal consciousness, enabling them to communicate

telepathically  with  other  creatures  of  their  kind.  A  group

of  such  creatures  within  a  certain  distance  of  each  other

(speci ed in the creatures entry) are in constant contact. If

one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in the

group is not  at-footed, none of them are. No creature in

the group is considered  anked unless all are.

Telepathy  (Su):  A  creature  with  this  ability  can  com-

municate  telepathically  with  any  other  creature  within  a

certain range (speci ed in the creatures entry, usually 100

feet) that has a language. It is possible to address multiple

creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a tele-

pathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is

just as dif cult as simultaneously speaking and listening to

multiple people at the same time.

Trample (Ex): As a full-round action, a creature with this

special attack can move up to twice its speed and literally

run  over  any  opponents  at  least  one  size  category  smaller

than itself. The creature merely has to move over the oppo-

nents  in  its  path;  any  creature  whose  space  is  completely

covered by the trampling creatures space is subject to the

trample attack.

If a targets space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered

trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares

it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over only some of

a targets space, the target can make an attack of opportunity

against the trampling creature at a 4 penalty. A trampling

creature  that  accidentally  ends  its  movement  in  an  illegal

space  returns  to  the  last  legal  position  it  occupied,  or  the

closest legal position, if theres a legal position thats closer.

A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creatures

slam damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modi er). The creatures

descriptive text gives the exact amount.

Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity,

but these take a 4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of

opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Re ex saves

to take half damage. The save DC against a creatures trample

attack  is  10  +  1/2  creatures  HD  +  creatures  Str  modi er

(the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive text). A

trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each

target once per round, no matter how many times its move-

ment takes it over a target creature.

Tremorsense (Ex): A creature with tremorsense is sen-

sitive  to  vibrations  in  the  ground  and  can  automatically

pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the

ground. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense

the location of creatures moving through water. The abilitys

range is speci ed in the creatures descriptive text.

Treasure: This entry in a monster description describes

how  much  wealth  a  creature  owns.  (See  pages  5256  of

the Dungeon Masters Guide for details about treasure, par-

ticularly Tables 35 through 38.) In most cases, a creature

keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with

it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, por-

table treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and use

these, leaving bulky items at home.

Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures

can have varying amounts of each, as follows.

Standard: Refer to Table 35 in the Dungeon Masters Guide

and roll d% once for each type of treasure (Coins, Goods,

Items) on the Level section of the table that corresponds to

the creatures Challenge Rating (for groups of creatures, use

the Encounter Level for the encounter instead).

Some  creatures  have  double,  triple,  or  even  quadruple

standard treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of trea-

sure two, three, or four times.

None: The creature collects no treasure of its own.

Nonstandard:  Some  creatures  have  quirks  or  habits  that

affect the types of treasure they collect. These creatures use

the same treasure tables, but with special adjustments.

Fractional  Coins:  Roll  on  the  Coins  column  in  the  sec-

tion corresponding to the creatures Challenge Rating, but

divide the result as indicated.

%  Goods  or  Items:  The  creature  has  goods  or  items  only

some of the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll d%

against the given percentage. On a success, make a normal

roll on the appropriate Goods or Items column (which may

still result in no goods or items).

Double Goods or Items: Roll twice on the appropriate Goods

or Items column.

Parenthetical Notes: Some entries for goods or items include

notes that limit the types of treasure a creature collects.

7/13/04   5:44:41 PM

When a note includes the word no, it means the creature

does  not  collect  or  cannot  keep  that  thing.  If  a  random  roll

generates such a result, treat the result as none instead. For

example,  if  a  creatures  items  entry  reads  no   ammables,

and a random roll generates a scroll, the creature instead has no

item at all (the scroll burned up, or the creature left it behind).

When a note includes the word only, the creature goes

out of its way to collect treasure of the indicated type. If an

entry for goods indicates gems only, roll on the appropriate

Goods column and treat any art result as gems instead.

Its sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of

item appears. For example, if a creatures items entry reads

non ammables  only,  roll  normally  on  the  appropriate

Items  column.  If  you  get  a   ammable  item,  reroll  on  the

same portion of the table until you get a non ammable one.

If  the  table  you  rolled  on  contains  only   ammable  items,

back up a step and reroll until you get to a table that can give

you an appropriate item.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A creature with this special qual-

ity (usually an undead) is less easily affected by clerics or

paladins (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Play-

ers Handbook). When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or

bolster attempt, add the indicated number to the creatures

Hit Dice total. For example, a deathshrieker has 18 Hit Dice

and +4 turn resistance. Attempts to turn, rebuke, command,

or bolster treat a deathshrieker as though it had 22 Hit Dice,

though it is an 18 HD creature for any other purpose.

Undead  Type:  Undead  are  once-living  creatures  ani-

mated by spiritual or supernatural forces.

Features: An undead creature has the following features.

12-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).

Good Will saves.

Skill points equal to (4 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if the

undead  creature  has  an  Intelligence  score.  However,  many

undead are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: An undead creature possesses the following traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

No Constitution score.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity to all mind-affecting spells and abilities

(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale

effects).

Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, and death effects.

Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability

drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical

ability  scores  (Strength,  Dexterity,  and  Constitution),  as

well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.

Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence

score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such as an

in ict spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special

quality works regardless of the creatures Intelligence score.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save

(unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).

Uses its Charisma modi er for Concentration checks.

Not  at  risk  of  death  from  massive  damage,  but  when

reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.

Not  affected  by  raise  dead  and  reincarnate  spells  or

abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead

creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the

living creatures they were before becoming undead.

Pro cient  with  its  natural  weapons,  all  simple  weap-

ons, and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient with whatever type of armor (light, medium,

or  heavy)  it  is  described  as  wearing,  as  well  as  all  lighter

types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not pro -

cient with armor. Undead are pro cient with shields if they

are pro cient with any form of armor.

Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.

Vermin  Type:  This  type  includes  insects,  arachnids,

other arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.

Features: Vermin have the following features.

8-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).

Good Fortitude saves.

Skill points equal to (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the  rst Hit Die, if

the vermin has an Intelligence score. However, most vermin

are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.

Traits: Vermin possess the following traits (unless other-

wise noted in a creatures entry).

Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all

mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities  (charms,  compulsions,

The newly released Monster Manual III offers a host of new foes to bedevil player char-

acters. Some of these, such as the new trolls, are variants on old standbys; others are

entirely new. This short scenario takes a sampling of these deliciously nasty creatures

and puts them through their paces.

Troll Outpost is a short D&D adventure for four 8th-level player characters (PCs). It

takes place in and around a cavern complex hidden in a forested hillside. As always, feel

free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.

PREPARATION

You  (the  DM)  need  the  D&D  core  rulebooksthe

Players  Handbook, the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide,  and  the

Monster Manualas well as Monster Manual III to run

this adventure. This scenario utilizes the D&D v.3.5 rules.

To get started, print out the adventure, including the

map. Read through the scenario at least once to famil-

iarize  yourself  with  the  situation,  threats,  and  major

NPCs (particularly their motivations). Then review the

information on the trolls and mindshredder in Monster

Manual III. Text that appears in shaded boxes is player

information that you can read aloud or paraphrase for

the players at the proper times. Monster and NPC statis-

tics  are  provided  with  each  encounter  in  abbreviated

form  or,  where  appropriate,  the  proper  page  in  the

Monster Manual or Monster Manual III is referenced.

ADVENTURE

BACKGROUND

The  war  troll  Hurdrac  has  decided  to  retire  from  the

mercenary life and set himself up as a petty lord. Once

established, he plans to build himself a small nation of

trolls.

To  that  end,  Hurdrac  has  assembled  a  small  contin-

gent of troll followers through bribery (with the money

had  has  amassed  over  the  years)  and  intimidation  (via

his  fiery  greatsword,  which  can  strike  fear  into  the

hearts of most ordinary trolls.) He has recently located

a modest cavern complex hidden in a forested hillside

that  he  deems  suitable  as  a  base  of  operations  and

moved  into  it  with  his  band.  From  there,  he  plans  to

terrorize and conquer the whole forest as the first step

in his quest for personal glory.

Unbeknownst  to  Hurdrac,  however,  a  colony  of

mindshredders lives in the neighborhood, and a mind-

shredder  scout  has  already  infiltrated  his  outpost.  For

the moment, the scout is content to observe the trolls

and  enjoy  the  occasional  snack  when  it  catches  one

asleep.  Its  favorite  treats  are  the  cave  trolls  that  guard

the  outposts  main  entrance,  since  they  arent  too

perceptive at the best of times, and theyre in the habit

of getting good and drunk when theyre not on duty. So

far,  the  trolls  havent  noticed  the  mindshredders

Wisdom-damaging attacks.

ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS

The  characters  must  penetrate  Hurdracs  outpost  and

clean  out  the  trolls  as  well  as  the  mindshredder  that

secretly  watches  the  place  from  below.  Once  the

1

complex has been cleared of monsters, the surrounding

area is safe until the next tenant takes up residence in

the cavern complex.

ADVENTURE HOOKS

As DM, you know best how to involve your PCs in an

adventure. You can use the following hooks to spur your

imagination,  modifying  them  as  necessary  to  fit  your

campaign or the characters.

While traveling through a thickly forested area, the PCs

stumble  upon  a  weird  caravan  in  which  several

wretched  humanoid  slaves  are  serving  as  beasts  of

burden. The caravan masters might be drow, duergar, or

some even more sinister creatures, such mind flayers.

The caravans contents, however, seem quite mundane

for such an unusual expedition: low-quality wine, some

salt, and a considerable quantity of low-grade iron ore.

The slaves know only that theyre bound for a hidden

fortress somewhere in the forest. The overseers claim to

be honest businesspeople who are delivering a perfectly

legitimate shipment to a private customer. If the PCs

press the issue, they learn that the customer is an upstart

petty  lord  with  plans  for  conquest.  A  little  kindness

toward the slaves (or intimidation aimed at the over-

seers) reveals the approximate location of the planned

delivery.  (In  fact,  the  caravan  is  bound  for  Hurdracs

outpost. The war troll has forged a tentative alliance with

the overseers, who have agreed to sell him supplies.)

Various forest dwellers have been complaining about

increased  activity  from  trolls  in  the  area. The  trolls

(who are actually Hurdracs forest trolls) have in fact

been  competing  with  the  local  populace  for  game,

and  they  seem  to  be  brutally  efficient  hunters.

However, they have not limited themselves to hunt-

ing game, and the leaders of several forest communi-

ties  want  the  trolls  driven  out  before  they  kill  any

more  people. Thus,  the  community  elders  have  put

out a call for help with the problem.

The PCs come upon a wrecked homestead deep in the

forest. The house and barn have literally been torn to

bits.  Oddly  enough,  the  wreckage  appears  to  have

caught  fire  at  some  point,  but  someone  evidently

doused the flames very quickly with water from the

well.  If  the  PCs  comb  the  area,  they  might  find  a

survivor  or  two  hiding  in  the  woods,  or  perhaps  a

sylvan creature that witnessed the attack. Because the

attackers came in the dark of night, it was difficult to

see them clearly, but they were bigger than humans

and very strong. They quickly killed the settlers, then

pried  apart  the  building  plank  by  plank. When  the

embers  from  the  kitchen  fire  started  a  blaze,  the

attackers  immediately  put  it  out. The  brief  firelight,

however, revealed that most of the attackers had tall,

thin  silhouettes,  muscular  bodies,  and  long  arms

ending in big, clawed hands. Two of them had a simi-

lar build but were closer to human size. (The attackers

were  Hurdracs  normal  troll  minions,  plus  a  pair  of

forest trolls serving as guides.)

BEGINNING THE

ADVENTURE

Troll Outpost is a site-based scenario in which the action

occurs in and around the hidden cavern complex that

houses  Hurdrac  and  his  followers.  The  adventure

begins  when  the  characters  find  an  entrance  to  the

outpost (see Entry Points, below).

HURDRACS OUTPOST

The  outpost  occupies  a  cave  complex  beneath  a  rocky

slope  in  a  rugged  and  heavily  forested  area.  The

surrounding  land  could  be  low  mountains  or  hills,

possibly with a valley to one side.

INTERIOR FEATURES

Noteworthy features and conditions within the outpost

are described below.

Ceilings: On  the  main  level,  the  ceilings  in  the

corridors are about 15 feet high, and those in the cham-

bers  are  about  30  feet  high.  Below  the  main  level,  the

ceilings  in  both  the  corridors  and  the  single  chamber

are only about 7 feet high.

Floors: The  floors  throughout  the  complex  are

uneven  but  fairly  smooth  as  natural  stone  floors  go,

thanks to the many creatures that have inhabited these

caves  over  the  years.  Running  or  charging  within  the

complex  requires  a  DC  10  Balance  check.  Characters

who  fail  the  check  can  still  move  but  cannot  run  or

charge during their turns.

Light: Most of the complex is unlit and remains

dark even during the day. A few areas have some illumi-

nation, which is noted in the appropriate area descrip-

tions.

Natural  Staircases: Several  passages  inside  the

complex have fairly steep slopes with ridged floors that

form stony terraces. Characters can walk up or down these

natural staircases without making Climb checks, but doing

so hampers movement. Each square that a character moves

2

on  the  terraces  costs  10  feet  of  movement.  Characters

cannot run or charge on these natural staircases.

Sinkholes: Several  areas  within  the  complex

feature natural sinkholes. Each has a vertical shaft that

drops  more  or  less  straight  down  to  the  subterranean

level  below. The  vertical  distance  to  the  lower  level

varies and is noted in the descriptive text for the cham-

ber where the sinkhole is located.

Originally,  the  sinkholes  and  the  vertical  shafts

below them were made of the same smooth stone as the

walls  inside  the  complex  (see  below).  Recently,

however, the mindshredder living in area 12 has been

lining  them  with  chrysalis  material  (see  page  102  in

Monster  Manual  III)  to  a  thickness  of  1  foot.  This

substance  looks  and  feels  like  very  smooth,  wet  rock

and has a pale rose color. Though it appears slippery, it

has  been  cleverly  shaped  to  provide  good  handholds

and footholds (at least for a mindshredder). The Climb

DC for a sinkhole is 20, and a mindshredder gets a +5

circumstance  bonus  on  the  check.  A  DC  15  Spot  or

Search  check  reveals  that  the  sinkhole  has  a  resinous

lining,  and  a  DC  20  Spot  or  Search  check  reveals  the

handholds  and  footholds.  A  DC  30  Knowledge

(dungeoneering)  or  bardic  knowledge  check  reveals

that the lining is mindshredder chrysalis material.

Each of the shafts was originally about 5 feet wide,

but the lining has narrowed the diameter to less than 3

feet. A Small or Medium creature must squeeze to move

up  or  down  the  shaft  (see  page  29  in  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide).

The trolls in the outpost know about the sinkholes

but cannot fit down them. They simply assume that the

shafts get narrower and narrower the farther down they

go until they end in solid rock.

ss Mindshredder  Chrysalis  Lining: 12  in.

thick; hardness 5; hp 180; Break DC 31.

Walls: The  walls  inside  the  complex  are  made  of

fairly  smooth,  natural  stone  with  a  brownish  yellow

color. They  are  slightly  damp  and  slippery,  and  their

Climb DC is 25.

ENTRY POINTS

The  outpost  has  two  entrancesone  more  or  less  at

ground level that provides access to area 1, and another

about 200 feet up the slope that leads to area 11.

Lower Entrance

The  lower  entrance  is  the  easier  of  the  two  to  find.

Anyone searching the base of the hill comes upon a trail

that  winds  through  the  woods  and  eventually  leads

directly  to  area  1. The  dirt  of  this  trail  is  packed  hard

enough that it shows few footprints, but an occasional

print can be found in a soft spot. A DC 20 Survival or

Search check in such a location reveals a print made by

a biped, most likely of Large size, with clawed feet. The

prints arent clear enough to reveal any other informa-

tion.  Even  if  the  PCs  dont  find  any  tracks,  however,

they can still follow the trail right into area 1.

Upper Entrance

If the PCs climb the slope above area 1 and work their

way  back  toward  the  top  of  the  ridge,  they  can  find  a

cave with a square hole in the floor. This hole is the top

of a vertical shaft that leads about 200 feet straight down

to  area  11  (Climb  DC  10). The  trolls  dont  bother  to

maintain  this  exit  because  they  hardly  ever  use  it,  so

thick  brambles  almost  completely  obscure  the  cave

entrance.  Even  a  PC  who  looks  at  the  hole  must  still

make a DC 25 Search or Survival check to recognize it

as an opening. Once the characters locate the cave, they

must tear through the brambles to get inside.

ss Bramble Curtain: 18 in. thick; hardness 5; hp

150; break DC 29.

Creatures: While the  PCs are poking about near

the upper entrance, four forest trolls take the opportu-

nity to attack them.

INSIDE THE OUTPOST

The following areas are keyed to the outpost map.

1. CAVE OPENING

The main entrance lies in a rocky niche at the base of

the hill. This area is outdoors and is lit whenever the sun

or a fairly bright moon is shining.

3

In a small hollow in a hillside lies a pleasant grotto

filled with moss, ferns, and saplings. Behind it, the

hill  rises  steeply,  its  slopes  covered  with  massive

trees.  Two  openings  are  visible  in  the  grottos

depths. Through  the  opening  straight  ahead  is  a

natural staircase of smooth, slightly wet stone that

seems to lead upward into the hillside. Beyond the

opening off to the right, a fairly level corridor with

a sandy floor also leads into the hillside.

A DC 10 Search check or Survival check made to track

reveals many footprints going to and from both open-

ings. A character with the Track feat can make a DC 20

Survival check to determine that the tracks going to the

right are both fewer in number and slightly older than

the ones going straight ahead.

1a. Pit Chamber (EL 7)

Shadowy  illumination  (see  page  164  in  the  Players

Handbook) reaches this chamber from area 1 whenever

the sun or a fairly bright moon is shining.

Traps: Hurdrac has placed a pit trap in this dead-

end chamber to catch invaders who take the wrong path.

aa Well- Camouflaged  Pit  Trap: CR  7;

mechanical; location trigger; repair reset; DC 25 Reflex

save avoids; 70 ft. deep (7d6, fall); multiple targets (first

target in each of two adjacent 5-ft. squares); Search DC

27; Disable Device DC 18. Market Price: 24,500 gp.

Development: The sentry at area 1b can hear any

noisy activity here (such as characters falling into the pit).

1b. Guardpost (EL 8)

Shadowy  illumination  (see  page  164  in  the  Players

Handbook) reaches this chamber from area 1 whenever

the sun or a fairly bright moon is shining.

The natural staircase ends in an irregular chamber

that has a crystalline pool in the center of the floor.

The pool appears to be fed by water seeping down

the  walls  opposite  the  stairs.  Two  exits  are

visiblea  corridor  straight  ahead  on  the  other

side of the pool and a natural staircase to the left.

Fresh, cold water fills the pool to a depth of about 4 feet.

This  pool  once  held  a  few  fish,  but  the  trolls  have

scooped all of them out. A few crude, wooden buckets

lie  here  and  there  on  the  floor. The  trolls  use  these  to

carry water into their chambers when they need it.

A  long-forgotten  tenant  fitted  this  chamber  with  a

secret door. It is watertight, and the water flowing down

the back wall flows across it as well.

ss Stone Secret Door: 4 in. thick; hardness 8; hp

60; Search DC 25; Break DC 28.

Creature: A cave troll is always on guard here.

DD Cave  Troll: hp  112;  see  Monster  Manual  III,

page 177.

Tactics: The  cave  troll  lurks  in  the  alcove  at  the

west end of the chamber. It tends to doze, so unless the

PCs  make  a  lot  of  noise  or  dally  in  area  1  (discussing

plans,  casting  spells,  or  otherwise  making  their  pres-

ence known), it doesnt notice them until they reach the

top of the stairs. When it does notice intruders, it moves

to the staircase to block the chamber entrance with its

body if possible, then it simply fights to the death. If set

afire, it plunges into the pool to put itself out.

If  the  cave  troll  manages  to  catch  the  PCs  while

theyre still on the stairs, it gains a +1 bonus on melee

attack rolls because it is on higher ground.

Development: Thanks  to  the  secret  door,  noise

from  this  chamber  isnt  audible  in  the  rest  of  the

outpost. If the smith is in area 3, however, he can hear

fighting in here. When he does, he picks up two heated

pots from his forge and hurries to join the fight, using

the tactics noted in area 3.

If the PCs manage to capture either the smith or the

cave troll guard, they can try to question their captive.

The cave troll is almost too stupid to answer questions,

and the smith is very stubborn, so each gets a +4 bonus

on  Sense  Motive  checks  made  to  oppose  Bluff,

Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks.

If the PCs get the cave troll to talk, all they can learn

is that many trolls live on the other side of the magic

wall (his term for the secret door), including the boss

(Hurdrac), who is a great and terrible troll indeed. The

cave troll can also tell the party that his mate is asleep in

area 2, and he cant figure out why she didnt wake up and

join the fight. The cave troll doesnt know how to open

the  secret  door  and  is  convinced  that  anyone  who

attempts to do so without the bosss leave will surely die.

The smith knows more but plays dumb. He tells the

party that a dozen trolls just like the guard live in the

complex (a lie), in addition to their even more formida-

ble boss (the truth) and a few useless apprentice smiths

that  look  just  like  him  (true  as  far  as  the  smith  is

concerned).  If  pressed,  the  smith  admits  that  most  of

the  trolls  in  the  outpost  are  just  regular  trolls.  He  has

never made an exact count, but he knows they number

about a dozen. He also knows there is a second cave troll

is area 2, and he assumes that she didnt join the fight

because  shes  dead  drunkafter  all,  both  cave  trolls

both frequently drunk.

2. SLEEPING CAVE (EL 8)

The two cave troll guards share this chamber, but one of

them is always on duty in area 1b.

On a pile of damp twigs and ferns sleeps a large,

chunky,  rubbery-looking  humanoid  with  thick,

ropy hair. A low table, two flat rocks, and several

barrels complete the crude furnishings of the cave.

The flat rocks serve as chairs for the cave trolls. One of

the barrels holds smoked meat from area 10, another is

filled with water from area 1b, and the third with sour

wine, also from area 10. The chamber also has a sinkhole

that  leads  down  20  feet  to  the  subterranean  passage

below.

Creatures: A  female  cave  troll  is  asleep  in  here.

Normally, a disturbance in area 1b or area 3 would cause

her to wake up and go to join the fray. Today, however,

the mindshredder from area 12 was feeling hungry, so it

crept out of the sinkhole and attacked the sleeping troll

with its tentacles, dealing 6 points of Wisdom damage.

That  damage  plus  the  wine  she  consumed  when  she

went off duty has left her dead to the world.

DD Cave Troll: hp 112, see Monster Manual III, page

177.  Because  this  cave  troll  has  taken  6  points  of

Wisdom damage, her current Wisdom score is 7, which

produces  the  following  changes  in  her  statistics: Will

+3; Listen +3, Spot +3, Survival +1 (+5 when tracking by

scent).

Tactics: The  PCs  can  attempt  a  coup  de  grace  on

the sleeping cave troll. If she survives that attack (or any

attack  that  deals  normal  or  nonlethal  damage),  she

lumbers to her feet and then fights to the death.

Ad  Hoc  XP  Award: Dealing  with  the  sleeping

troll should prove easy, so give only half the usual expe-

rience award for defeating it.

3. SMITHY (EL 8)

The trolls have just begun making their own weapons

and  armor  in  this  chamber. The  ruddy  glow  from  the

forge always fills the room with shadowy illumination.

This chamber stinks of coal smoke, and a banked

fire  glows  in  a  crude  forge.  Several  clay  pots  and

glowing  metal  ingots  lie  in  the  hot  coals.  Along

one wall stands a high, flat stone and a workbench

made from logs.

The trolls placed iron ore in five clay pots and put them

in the fire to heat as a prelude to making a small amount

of  steel. The  metal  hasnt  yet  melted,  but  some  of  the

impurities have, so some molten slag is now mixed in

with pieces of iron ore. The ingots are bits of finished

steel that are ready for forging. The flat rock serves as an

anvil, and the homemade bench holds an assortment of

tongs  and  hammers  for  metalworking.  A  leather  bag

under  the  bench  contains  about  three  dozen  steel

arrowheads, all newly made and razor sharp.

The clay pots are searing hot. Touching a pot deals 1

point of fire damage, picking up a pot deals 1d4 points

of  fire  damage,  and  carrying  a  pot  deals  1d4  points  of

fire  damage  per  round.  If  someone  manages  to  toss  a

pot, it functions as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals

2d4 points of fire damage immediately and 1d4 points

of additional fire damage each round for 1d4 rounds, or

until the hot slag is quenched. (A plunge into the pool

in area 1b would do the trick.) A splash from a pot deals

1d4  points  of  fire  damage,  and  the  creature  splashed

must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take an extra point of

fire damage each round for 1d4 rounds or until the hot

slag is quenched.

The sinkhole in this chamber leads down 30 feet to

the subterranean passage below.

Creatures: When  the  PCs  arrive  at  the  outpost,

the smith has a 50% chance to be here and a 50% chance

to be in his quarters at area 9.

Regeneration  (Ex): See  Monster  Manual  III,

page 178.

Possessions:  Masterwork  studded  leather  armor,  ring

of minor energy resistance (fire).

Tactics: The smith immediately attacks any intrud-

ers by grabbing a pot from the forge and hurling it at the

closest foe. He keeps throwing pots until he runs out of

them  or  until  someone  comes  within  melee  reach,

whereupon  he  switches  to  melee  attacks.  Like  most

trolls, he doesnt fear death, but he realizes the value of

5

6

living to fight another day. If reduced to 60 or fewer hit

points,  he  tries  to  withdraw  from  the  battle,  overrun-

ning  a  character  in  the  process  if  necessary.  If  he

manages  to  break  away,  he  tries  to  flee  through  the

secret  door  in  area  1b  and  move  to  area  5  to  warn  the

guards there.

Development: The smith goes to assist the guard

in area 1b if he hears a fight there. If the PCs get into the

smithy without dealing with the guard in area 1b, the

latter joins any combat that happens in here.

4. SHOOTING GALLERY

This natural staircase serves to slow down intruders. It

is 110 feet long and rises a total of 70 feet to area 5.

A natural staircase leads upward from west to east.

Tangled  ropes  and  threads  hang  from  the  ceiling

like strands of tattered cobwebs. They arent thick

enough to block vision, but they would probably

impede movement.

The threads and ropes hang from the ceiling all the way

down to the stairs and cover the entire staircase. They

serve to alert the guards in area 5 to the presence of invis-

ible creatures on the stairs. Pulling down all the threads

and ropes would take days, but an area spell such as a

lighting bolt cleans out a section of them immediately. Its

possible to move up the stairs without disturbing the

mass, but doing so requires a DC 20 Escape Artist check

for each round of movement. Smaller creatures have an

easier time with the task, however. Apply the following

modifiers for size to the Escape Artist check: Fine +16,

Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large 4, Huge 8,

Gargantuan 12, Colossal 16.

Development: The guards at area 5 can see 90 feet

down the stairs thanks to their darkvision. They keep a

steady watch on the staircase and fire their bows at any

intruders they see approaching. Thanks to the threads

and ropes, they can pinpoint the location of any invisi-

ble intruder traversing the stairs unless she successfully

avoids the threads or clears them out first.

5. STAIRCASE GUARDPOST (EL 8)

The trolls have constructed two 4-foot-high walls west

of this chamber, one at the top of the stairs and one 10

feet west of that (farther down the staircase). The walls

are temporary and as such are not shown on the map. A

Medium  or  Large  creature  can  cross  one  without  a

Climb or Jump check by spending 10 feet of movement

in addition to the extra movement cost for traversing

the  stairs.  Smaller  creatures  must  jump  or  climb

(Climb DC 15) the walls, and larger creatures can just

step over them.

Creatures: A  quartet  of  forest  trolls  is  always  on

guard here.

DD Forest Troll Guards (4): Male or female forest

Possessions: Masterwork  studded  leather  armor,

composite longbow (+3 Str bonus) with 10 masterwork

arrows.

Tactics: Two forest trolls hunker down behind the

lower makeshift wall on the stairs and keep watch over

the  staircase. The  remaining  trolls  stand  at  the  south

entrance to the chamber and watch for intruders.

When the forest trolls notice the PCs, they fire their

bows  and  call  for  help.  If  the  foes  are  coming  up  the

stairs, the trolls at the south entrance to area 5 move to

the  top  of  the  stairs  and  begin  firing  their  bows  from

there, since they can shoot over their comrades heads

without any penalties. The trolls have cover (+4 bonus

to Armor Class) against attacks that cross a wall. Once

their foes come within melee reach, the two forest trolls

behind  the  lower  wall  try  to  hold  them  off  while  the

others  hang  back  and  shoot  into  the  melee  as  best  as

they  can. When  a  front-line  troll  is  reduced  to  20  or

fewer hit points, it drops back to the second rank and a

fresh troll steps up to replace it in the front line. In this

way,  the  forest  trolls  hope  to  make  full  use  of  their

regeneration ability. They fight to the death.

(see

through  area  4

Development: The  forest  trolls  can  usually  spot

that  areas

foes  coming

Development  section).  Calls  for  help  or  sounds  of  a

fight  from  area  5  alert  the  trolls  in  area  6,  but  they

require  1  round  to  wake  up  and  grab  their  weapons

before  they  can  go  and  join  the  fray.  Noise  here  also

alerts Hurdrac in area 7. Once he becomes aware of an

attack, Hurdrac gathers the trolls from areas 9 and 11 to

mount a defense, as noted in the Development section

for area 7.

6. FOREST TROLL BARRACKS (EL 8)

Hurdracs  forest  troll  followers  sleep  in  this  chamber.

Read  or  paraphrase  the  following  when  the  PCs  look

into  this  chamber,  adjusting  as  needed  if  any  of  the

inhabitants are present.

Twelve log-and-plank beds topped by mattresses

stuffed  with  leaves  and  ferns  occupy  the  rear

section of the room. In front of them stands a crude

table littered with dirty dishes and food scraps. Two

log  benches  flank  the  table  to  provide  seating.

Barrels line the east wall, and a rack holding weap-

ons and armor stands against the west wall.

the  platinum  pieces  in  the  barrel  requires  a  DC  10

Search check.

7. BEDCHAMBER (EL 12)

This room is Hurdracs private chamber. Read or para-

phrase  the  following  aloud,  adjusting  as  needed  if

Hurdrac is present.

A massive, canopied bed dominates this chamber. At

its foot stands a huge chest with metal fittings. On

one side of the room is a small banquet table, and on

the other side is a well-padded divan. The bedclothes

and  the  divans  upholstery  appear  soiled,  and  the

whole room smells of rotting food and waste.

The  barrels  contain  the  same  kinds  of  provisions  as

those in area 2.

Creatures: A dozen forest trolls live here, but only

four  are  present  at  any  one  time.  Of  the  remaining

eight,  four  stand  guard  in  area  5  and  four  are  outside

hunting for provisions.

Poison (Ex): See Monster Manual III, page 179.

Possessions: Masterwork  studded  leather  armor,

composite longbow (+3 Str bonus) with 10 masterwork

arrows.

Tactics: The trolls in here spend most of their time

sleeping, but they wake up if fighting occurs in area 5,

taking  1  round  to  get  out  of  bed  and  arm  themselves

before heading out to join the fray. In a fight, they use

the same tactics as their comrades in area 5 do.

Treasure: The dirty dishes on the table include 5

tarnished silver platters worth 50 gp each, and hidden

among  the  twelve  mattresses  are  eight  deep  blue

spinels  (250  gp  each). The  barrel  filled  with  meat  has

275 pp hidden in the bottom. To find the silver platters

among the dirty dishes, a character must appraise them

(DC  12  Appraise  check).  Finding  the  gems  in

mattresses requires a DC 20 Search check, and finding

Hurdrac obtained the bed as part of his loot while serv-

ing in a mercenary campaign. The chest is made of teak-

wood, and its fittings are mithral.

Creatures: Hurdrac spends most of his time here

exercising and planning tasks for his minions.

page 181.

Possessions: +1  breastplate,  +2  flaming  burst  greatsword,

masterwork composite longbow (+10 Str bonus) with 20

arrows, key to the teakwood and mithral chest.

Tactics: Hurdrac keeps his eyes and ears peeled for

any  signs  of  invasion  from  outside  the  complex  or

dissent among his underlings. He automatically notices

any disturbance in area 5, 9, or 11 and draws troops from

nearby chambers in preparation to meet the attack. For

example,  if  he  notes  fighting  in  area  5,  he  gathers  the

8

crystalline trolls from area 9 and the regular trolls from

area 11. Likewise, if he hears trouble in area 11, he takes

the  crystalline  trolls  from  area  9  and  the  forest  trolls

from areas 5 and 6.

Hurdrac  prefers  to  waylay  invaders  in  area  8.  He

places  half  his  troop  there  and  the  other  half  here  in

area 7. When the trolls in area 8 enter melee, Hurdrac

leads the rest of his troops there in a flanking maneuver.

Both  groups  use  tactics  similar  to  those  of  the  forest

trolls  in  area  5they  keep  a  front  line  supplied  with

fresh  troops,  while  the  trolls  in  the  second  line  hang

back to let their regeneration work.

If  the  PCs  manage  to  catch  Hurdrac  unawares,  he

picks out the most formidable-looking fighter type and

engages  that  character  in  melee  while  bellowing  for

help.  If  any  of  the  trolls  in  areas  5,  9,  and  11  are  still

alive, they begin moving to this area 1 round after hear-

ing Hurdracs cries.

Treasure: The table in this room is worth 1,000

gp,  and  the  teakwood  chest  is  worth  5,000  gp.  In

addition,  the  chest  contains  510  pp,  1,600  gp,  and  8

rubies (500 gp each).

9. SMITHS ROOM (EL 10 OR 11)

This  chamber  is  similar  to  area  6.  It  is  furnished  with

four beds, a table, and three barrels of provisions with

the same contents as those in area 2.

Creatures: The smith and his three assistants, all

crystalline trolls, live in this chamber and are here most

of the time. When the PCs enter the outpost, however,

the smith has a 50% chance to be here and a 50% chance

to be in area 3.

Possessions:  Masterwork  studded  leather  armor,  ring

Tactics: If the three apprentices face the PCs alone,

they  simply  try  to  gang  up  on  one  character  at  a  time

and  claw  their  way  through  the  party,  fighting  to  the

death.  If  either  the  smith  or  Hurdrac  is  on  hand  to

direct them, they try to encircle their foes. When heav-

ily damaged, they attempt to retire for a few rounds to

regenerate before rejoining the fray.

Development: The trolls here go to join any fight-

ing that occurs in area 7 or 11.

10. LARDER

The trolls keep their supplies in this chamber. Dressed

carcasses of various creatures hang from the ceiling, and

seven barrels of sour wine are stacked against the wall.

The sinkhole in this chamber leads down 90 feet to

the subterranean passage below.

11. TROLL BARRACKS (EL 9)

This  chamber  is  similar  to  areas  6  and  9  and  contains

four beds, a table, and several barrels of provisions. The

natural chimney begins 30 above the floor and connects

with  a  vertical  shaft  that  rises  to  the  outposts  rear

entrance  (see  Entry  Points,  above).  The  trolls  use  a

ladder  to  reach  the  chimney,  but  they  usually  leave  it

lying on the floor.

Creatures: The  four  normal  trolls  that  live  here

are charged with keeping an eye on the back door.

DD Trolls  (4):  hp  63  each;  see  Monster  Manual,

page 247.

Tactics: These  trolls  use  the  same  tactics  as  the

crystalline trolls in area 9 do.

Development: The trolls here join any fights that

break  out  in  area  7  or  9.  Likewise,  the  trolls  in  those

chambers  come  to  join  any  fighting  here,  as  noted  in

the Development sections for those areas.

12. LOWER CHAMBER (EL 8)

The walls of this dank chamber are lined with smooth

mindshredder chrysalis material. The rooms sinkhole is

blocked about 15 feet down by a plug of chrysalis material.

ss Mindshredder  Chrysalis  Lining: 3  in.

thick; hardness 5; hp 45; Break DC 27; Climb DC 30.

9

ss Mindshredder Chrysalis Plug: 24 in. thick;

hardness 5; hp 360; Break DC 33.

Creatures: A single mindshredder zenthal dwells

here. The  creature  is  a  scout  for  its  colony,  which  is

located underground, several miles away.

DD Mindshredder  Zenthal: hp  84,  see  Monster

Manual III, page 104.

Tactics: The mindshredder tries to remain aware of

events that occur on the level above, so it listens care-

fully for any fighting up there. If it suspects invaders are

present, it keeps track of their progress as best it can by

moving  from  sinkhole  to  sinkhole  and  listening  care-

fully. Even if it is unaware of the PCs presence in the

outpost,  the  mindshredder  tends  to  sit  and  use  its

thought sense ability whenever it is not otherwise occu-

pied. The ability has a range of 60 feet and some ability

to penetrate barriers, but the twisting passages around

its  chamber  effectively  limit  the  powers  range  to  the

nearest turns in the corridors leading in here.

When the mindshedder notes an approaching crea-

ture, it scuttles off into a corridor and tries to work its

way around behind the intruder. As soon as it is in posi-

tion,  it  uses  its  hypnotism  and  confusion  abilities

against the nearest foe. Once battle is joined, it tries to

keep its distance while maintaining the attack with its

spell-like abilities. If forced into melee combat, it uses

its tentacles but tries to move out of reach as quickly as

it can.

Development: The  trolls  are  aware  of  the  sink-

holes, but they dont usually dont pay much attention to

them because they have noted no creatures coming up

from below thus far. Thus, they dont notice any activity

down here unless the PCs use some flashy spells. In that

case, Hurdrac orders the trolls from area 11 and area 6

down a sinkhole to investigate. If Hurdrac is dead, the

surviving trolls are content to keep watch over the sink-

holes  and  attack  any  creatures  that  might  come  up  to

their level.

If the PC break through the plug at the bottom of the

sinkhole,  they  find  another  cave  complex  below  this

one. See Further Adventures, below, for some possible

scenarios using this area.

CONCLUDING THE

ADVENTURE

If the PCs slay Hurdrac, theyve effectively put an end to

his outpost and his dreams of conquest. Any surviving

normal trolls, forest trolls, and crystalline troll appren-

tices pack up their remaining treasures and gear and go

find  another  lair  somewhere  in  the  forest. The  crys-

talline troll smith is reluctant to abandon his forge, but

he  does  so  after  his  apprentices  leave.  Any  surviving

cave trolls, however, stay right where they are.

FURTHER ADVENTURES

As noted at the beginning of the adventure, the cavern

complex  in  which  Hurdrac  built  his  outpost  has  had

many  tenants  over  the  years,  so  it  probably  wont  stay

empty for long after the PCs drive out the trolls. If the

crystalline troll smith survives the adventure, he even-

tually returns to his forge. He might set himself up as

the  new  lord  of  the  outpost,  or  he  might  strike  a  deal

with  whoever  or  whatever  has  taken  up  residence  in

these  caverns  in  the  meantime. The  complex  would

make a decent lair for a fairly young green dragon or a

family of lycanthropes, though it could also serve as an

outpost for drow or duergar raiderspossibly the same

group of duergar that sponsored the caravan mentioned

in  the  Character  Hooks  section.  Mindshredders  also

might move in after the trolls are gone.

If the PCs find their way into the caverns below the

outpost  (see  area  12),  they  might  simply  find  a  few

tunnels that lead to the surface a mile or two from the

outpost, or they might find themselves inside an active

cave complexperhaps even a mindshredder colony or

outpost.  In  any  case,  its  a  good  bet  that  a  few  more

mindshredders are prowling around that area.

Add the following text to the body of the ability

A true seeing spell or ability reveals the creatures

natural form. A creature using change shape reverts to

its natural form when killed, but separated body parts

retain their shape. A creature cannot use change shape

to take the form of a creature with a template.

Replace Line 2 of the changes with the following text:

The creature loses the natural weapons and

movement modes of its original form, as well as any

extraordinary special attacks of its original form not

derived from class levels (such as the barbarians rage

class feature).

Replace Line 6 of the changes with the following text:

The creature retains its HD, hit points, base attack

bonus, and base save bonuses.

Add the following text to the end of the entry.

Any gear worn or carried by the creature that cant be

worn or carried in its new form instead falls to the

ground in its space. If the creature changes size, any

gear it wears or carries that can be worn or carried in its

new form changes size to match the new size.

(Nonhumanoid-shaped creatures cant wear armor

designed for humanoid-shaped creatures, and vice-

versa.) Gear returns to normal size if dropped.
