the Easting Reach and the Sunrise Mountains, from the Wiz-

ards Reach (the southern coasts of Aglaronds peninsula) to

the  Icerim  Mountains  of  the  frozen  north,  hard  on  the

boundaries  of  the  Great  Glacier.  More  than  half  a  million

square miles of territory fall within its bounds, divided be-

tween five principal lands: Aglarond, the Great Dale, Rashe-

men,  Thay,  and  Thesk  (Narfell  counts  as  part  of  both  the

Unapproachable  East  and  the  Cold  Lands  of  Damara  and

Vaasa). Dozens of independent cities, towns, and strongholds

lie scattered in the lands between the recognized countries, al-

though any settlement in the Great Dale or Thesk could be

considered independent too, as those lands lack any central

government or authority.

Aglarond is renowned as the realm of the Simbul, a mighty

sorcerer-queen  who  has  ruled  the  land  for  generations.  The

Yuirwood, an ancient forest that once sheltered a powerful civ-

ilization of mysterious elves, blankets most of the peninsula,

sheltering  its  coastal  cities  from  Thayan  expansion.  Unex-

plored ruins filled with deadly perils and wondrous magic lie

beneath the dense woods.

East of Aglarond is mighty Thay, a populous land enslaved

by the arrogant and ambitious magocracy of the Red Wizards.

Few invaders have overcome the great escarpments and dif-

ficult mountains girding the Plateau of Thay, and the secre-

tive  and  suspicious  Red  Wizards  raise  barriers  just  as

formidable to discourage travelers from venturing into their

lands. From their strongholds and estates, the Red Wizards

plot the mercantile and military domination of all the Un-

approachable Eastand after that, the world.

West of Thay, in the thief-ruled city of Telflamm, the trade

road known as the Golden Way begins. For thousands of miles

it  heads  eastward,  joining  Faern  to  the  fabulous  lands  of

Kara-Tur. Along this road lie the merchant towns that com-

prise the realm of Thesk, the crossroads of the Unapproach-

able  East.  A  dozen  years  ago,  the  mighty  Tuigan  horde

attacked Thesk. A great alliance of western powers halted the

Tuigans near the city of Phsant, but Thesk is still recovering

from the devastation of the war while struggling to accom-

modate thousands of Shou who fled their far eastern home-

land before the horde.

Across the wide lands of Faern, bards and trav-

elers tell strange tales of the Unapproachable

East, a distant land of proud barbarians, forest-

grown  ruins,  and  dreadful  wizardry.  It  is  a  world  filled  with

ancient mysteries and endless strife, a swirling maelstrom of

exotic beauty and hell-spawned peril, where tribes value free-

dom more than their lives and slaves groan under the worst

kind  of  sorcerous  oppression.  It  is  a  crossroads  and  a  battle-

ground  where  East  meets  West  and  today  struggles  to  claw

itself free of the half-remembered past. So fantastic is the rep-

utation of this region in western Faern that in the taverns

and  taprooms  of  a  dozen  western  cities,  skeptics  greet  an

unlikely tale or fanciful fable with a snort and mutter, In the

East, perhaps!

The story of the Unapproachable East is the roll of an-

cient empires, terrible magic, and the clash of human races

and realms. Unlike the lands of the west, where elven and

dwarven  realms  of  great  antiquity  shielded  the  young

human kingdoms from monstrous threats, few nonhuman

realms have left their mark upon the east. Instead, ancient

human realms such as old Narfell, Raumathar, and the ear-

lier dynasties of Mulhorand and Unther have battled over

these lands for almost two thousand years, while the newer

powers  of  Thay,  the  Tuigan  Horde,  and  the  cities  of  the

Easting Reach continue to vie for supremacy. The battles

of old were fought with mighty magic and great armies, but

the struggle today is more often joined with deceit, guile,

and coin.

So what, precisely, is the Unapproachable East? At the sim-

plest level, it is a vast area encompassing the lands between

North  of  Thesk  lies  a  thinly  settled  land  sandwiched

between two of Faerns greatest forests. The Great Dale

is a long, fertile vale running 300 miles east from the town

of Uthmere, dividing the Forest of Lethyr from the dark and

deadly Rawlinswood. Governed by a council of druids, the

independent clanholds of the Great Dale stand amid the

ancient ruins of old Narfell, a demon-haunted realm whose

dark legacy still threatens nearby lands a thousand years after

its destruction.

East of the Great Dale, across the bitter Lake of Tears, lies

the most remote land of the Unapproachable East: Rashemen.

Long the mortal enemy of Thay, Rashemen is in its own way

as unwelcoming of strangers as the realm of the Red Wizards.

Here, the famous Witches of Rashemen guard secrets of mag-

ical lore and are vigilant against the next manifestation of

Thays ambitions.

Each of these five different lands has its own perils and

mysteries, villains and dangers. All are bound by the accident

of geography and the memory of ancient empires, but each

conceals its own secrets and threats. For characters from other

parts of Faern, the Unapproachable East is inscrutable, un-

known, and alluring, a place to venture where few westerners

have traveled and explore mysteries few outsiders have pen-

etrated.  For  the  Aglarondans,  the  Rashemi,  and  other  folk

native  to  the  East,  these  lands  are  less  mysterious  but  still

filled with ancient perils and deadly, neverending strife.

Skill and feat Changes

In the revised D&D core rulebooks, three skills and one feat are

renamed. In order to be consistent with the core rulebooks in

this regard, this book uses the new names given below.

Also,  minor  changes  have  been  made  to  the  way  two

feats work.

Two-Weapon  Fighting  no  longer  has  Ambidexterity  as  a

Old Name

Alchemy

Pick Pocket

prerequisite.

Weapon Finesse no longer must be applied to a particular

weapon  when  it  is  takena  single  acquisition  of  the  feat

allows its possessor to use the feat whenever that individual

is wielding any of the weapons to which the feat applies.

INTRODUCTION

Full Attack: This entry gives all the physical attacks the

creature can make when it uses the full attack action. It pro-

vides the number of attacks along with the weapon, attack

bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The first list-

ing  is  for  the  creatures  primary  weapon,  with  an  attack

bonus  including  modifications  for  size  and  Strength  (for

melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature

with the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier

on melee attacks.

The  remaining  weapons  are  secondary  and  have  a  5

penalty on their attack bonus, no matter how many there are.

Creatures with the Multiattack feat (see Feats, below) take

only a 2 penalty on secondary attacks.

Skills: This part of a description lists all the creatures skills

alphabetically along with each skills modifier, which includes

adjustments for ability scores and any bonuses from feats or

racial traits. All listed skills are class skills, unless the crea-

ture has a character class (noted in the entry). A creatures

type  and  Intelligence  score  determine  the  number  of  skill

points it has. If it lacks an Intelligence score, it doesnt have

any skill points.

The Skills section of the creatures descriptive text recaps

racial bonuses and other adjustments to skill checks for the

sake of clarity; these adjustments have already been accounted

for in the statistics block. An asterisk (*) following a skill mod-

ifier in the statistics block indicates a conditional adjustment,

which  is  explained  in  the  Skills  section.  Conditional  adjust-

ments are not accounted for in the statistics block.

Skill Synergy: Certain skills provide a bonus to the use of

related skills when a character has 5 or more ranks in that

skill. For instance, having 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist

provides a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks to escape from bind-

ings. This is expressed in a creatures statistics block by a par-

enthetical note following the base skill modifier, such as Use

Rope +2 (+4 bindings).

Feats: This part of a description lists the creatures feats al-

phabetically. The creatures descriptive text may contain ad-

ditional information if a feat works differently from how it

is described in Chapter 5: Feats of the Players Handbook or

in the Monster Manual.

Sometimes, a creature has one or more bonus feats, indi-

cated by B following the name. It is not necessary for a crea-

ture to meet the feats prerequisites in order to have and use

a bonus feat. If you wish to customize the creature with new

feats, you can replace its regular feats, but not its bonus feats.

The creature cannot have a regular feat unless it meets all the

feats prerequisites.

Notes on Monsters

Creatures described in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East reflect

some changes in the revised core rulebooks. These revisions are

summarized below.

Types: The beast and shapechanger types no longer exist.

Beasts with an Intelligence score of 3 or above are magical

beasts;  those  with  lower  Intelligence  are  animals.  Shape-

changer is now a subtype (see below).

Subtypes: This book introduces or revises the following

subtypes.

Cold Subtype: A creature with the cold subtype is immune

to cold damage. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage

as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is

allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Fire Subtype: A creature with the fire subtype is immune

to fire damage. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage as

normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is al-

lowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Native  Subtype:  This  subtype  applies  only  to  outsiders.

These creatures have mortal ancestors or a connection to the

Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected

just as other living creatures can.

Shapechanger Subtype: A shapechanger has the supernatu-

ral ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many mag-

ical effects allow some kind of shapeshifting, and not every

creature that can change shapes is a shapechanger.

Base Attack/Grapple: The number before the slash in this

entry is the creatures base attack bonus, which is its attack

bonus  before  any  modifiers  are  applied.  A  creatures  base

attack bonus depends on its type, Hit Dice, and class level (if

any).  You  usually  will  not  need  this  number,  but  it  can  be

handy to have sometimes, especially if the creature has the

Power Attack or Expertise feat. The number after the slash

is the creatures grapple bonus, which is used when the crea-

ture makes a grapple attack or when someone tries to grap-

ple the creature. The grapple bonus includes all modifiers that

apply  to  the  creatures  grapple  checks  (base  attack  bonus,

Strength  modifier,  special  size  modifier,  and  any  other  ap-

plicable modifier, such as a racial bonus on grapple checks).

Attack: This entry provides the single physical attack the

creature  uses  with  an  attack  action  (in  most  cases,  this  is

also  the  attack  the  creature  uses  during  an  attack  of  op-

portunity). The entry shows the weapon, attack bonus, and

form of attack (melee or ranged). The attack bonus includes

modifications for size and Strength (for melee attacks) or

Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon

Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks.

If the creature uses natural weapons, the natural weapon

given here is the creatures primary natural weapon.

If the creature has several different weapons at its disposal,

the alternatives are shown as well.

A  creature  can  use  one  of  its  secondary  natural  weapons

with the attack action if it chooses, but if it does, it takes an

attack penalty, as noted in the Full Attack section (below).

Races

The  races  commonly  found  in  other  parts  of

Faernhumans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-

lings, and half-orcsare prevalent throughout

the Unapproachable East as well. However, the East is also

home  to  several  peoples  who  are  either  isolated  in  the

remoter  portions  of  the  region  or  found  only  here.  These

are  the  star  elves,  gnolls,  hagspawn,  spirit  folk,  taers,  and

volodnis.

Of  the  common  races,  humans  are  by  far  the  most  nu-

merous. They include several distinct ethnicities. The folk of

Rashemen  and  the  downtrodden  commoners  of  Thay  are

Rashemi, a dark-haired people with deep, swarthy complex-

ions, while the Mulan, a people originating from Mulhorand,

rule  Thay.  Damarans,  a  widespread  group  that  colonized

many lands east of the Inner Sea in the last six or seven cen-

turies,  call  Aglarond,  the  Great  Dale,  and  Thesk  home.

Smaller  numbers  of  Chondathans  dwell  in  Aglarond  and

Thesk, and some Nars live in the Great Dale. Finally, more

exotic nationalities such as Shou and Tuigan are sprinkled

throughout the region.

Dwarves are not common in the Unapproachable East, al-

though arctic dwarves make their homes on the Great Glac-

ier north of Narfell, and duergar cities lie buried under the

Sunrise Mountains. A small number of shield dwarves live in

isolated holds in the Giantspire and Icerim Mountains.

Wood elves and wild elves inhabit the realm of Aglarond,

and a small number of wood elves prowl the Forest of Lethyr,

but the East never was blessed with the great elven realms

that arose in lands farther west. Drow are rumored to lurk be-

neath the open lands of Thesk and the frozen reaches of the

Icerim Mountains, but if so, they have few dealings with the

surface folk of the East.

Gnomes  are  somewhat  common  in  the  Unapproachable

East, which is noteworthy, as the Forgotten Folk arent found

in  numbers  anywhere  else  except  the  isle  of  Lantan.  Rock

gnome settlements dot the Dragonjaw Mountains, and an iso-

lated valley in the eastern slopes of the Sunrise Mountains is

home to a secret, well-defended gnome realm known as the

Hidden Kingdom.

Half-elves  are  also  common  in  the  East,  particularly  in

Aglarond. Born of human settlers and the ancient Yuir elves,

these handsome folk have made the Simbuls domain a haven

for their kind. Half-orcs are numerous too, although they do

not call a particular land home. Descended in large part from

Powerful Races

Some of the races listed in this chapter have a level adjust-

ment listed in their racial traits. When a member of these

races gains class levels, this level adjustment is added to the

creatures  Hit  Dice  to  determine  the  effective  character

level, or ECL, of the character. The ECL measures the rel-

ative strength of the character for the purpose of experience

point  requirements  to  advance  in  levels.  For  example,  the

taer has a level adjustment of +1. Adding this to the taers

starting 2 Hit Dice brings the taers ECL to 3. Thus, a 1st-

level taer character is the equivalent of a 4th-level standard

character. For more information, see Chapter 1: Characters

in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

RACES OF THE EAST

Physical Description: Of all the elven subraces, star elves

most closely resemble moon elves. They have pale skin that

sometimes takes on a pearly gray or faintly violet tinge, and

hair of gold, red, or silver-white. Their eyes are gray or violet,

sometimes with gold flecks. Like the sun elves or moon elves,

star elves are tall and slender; men average between 5 1/2 and

6 feet in height and weigh around 140 pounds, while women

are about half a foot shorter and weigh around 110 pounds.

In  their  homes  they  favor  elegant,  embroidered  tunics  but

dress  in  neutral  colors  with  dappled  gray-green  cloaks  to

remain unseen in woodlands. Star elves are graceful and strik-

ingly handsome by human standards.

Relations: Most star elves have removed themselves from

the everyday life of Faern and therefore have little under-

standing of humans, dwarves, and other races. They think of

humans as aggressive expansionists who readily take up blade

and spell to get what they want, and they regard humans with

caution. They get along well with other elves, especially sun

and  wood  elves,  but  fear  trouble  from  the  moon  elves  un-

guarded generosity and engagement of human realms.

Alignment:  Most  star  elves  prefer  not  to  involve  them-

selves in the worlds troubles. Star elf society values individ-

ual accomplishment and rights over collective effort, so they

lean toward chaotic rather than lawful alignments.

Religion: Star elves venerate the Seldarine, the pantheon of

elven deities. They are not a devout race but hold a special rev-

erence for Corellon Larethian.

Language: Star elves speak Common and Elven. Those who

venture  to  Faern  from  Sildyuir  often  learn  Aglarondan,

Mulan,  or  Rashemi.  In  their  refuge,  Auran,  Celestial,  and

Sylvan are common, while some star elves learn Abyssal and

other evil tongues to converse with those seeking to destroy

Sildyuir.

Names:  MaleAeril,  Brevel,  Dhisten,  Jhered,  Mourel,

Ourevel,  Thaeleven;  FemaleBracatha,  Calastra,  Evindra,

Falindra,  Lauratha,  Nimara,  Varele.  Surnames:  Dawnsong,

Duskwood,  Moonshadow,  Nightsong,  Nightwind,  Starwind,

Woodsong, Woodwalker.

Adventurers:  After  two  millennia  in  isolation,  star  elves

have  realized  that  they  know  little  about  the  world  from

which  they  took  refuge.  As  their  ancient  haven  no  longer

shields  them  entirely,  many  have  begun  to  debate  whether

Sildyuir  should  remain  closed.  Certain  Faernian  realms

might make powerful and reliable allies in their war against

the abominations who threaten Sildyuir. A few have taken it

upon themselves to spy out the lay of the land, seeking knowl-

edge  to  defend  their  homeor  a  place  to  call  their  own  if

Sildyuir must be abandoned.

Regions: Most star elves live in the extraplanar realm of

Sildyuir; see the star elf region description in Chapter 3: Re-

gions and Feats. A small number already live quietly among

the people of Aglarond, and choose that region instead.

the  Zhentish  legion  that  battled  Yamun  Khahans  horde  in

Thesk thirteen years ago, half-orcs dont even merit a second

look in the cities along the Golden Way.

Halflings are not well known in the East, and those who

do live here are almost exclusively lightfoots. Small num-

bers of halflings live among the cities of Aglarond and the

trade towns of Thesk, and a few have settled down in the

Great  Dale  alongside  the  human  farmers  and  herders  of

that lonely land.

Planetouched are rare in most parts of the Unapproachable

Eastexcept in Thay. Tieflings are more common there than

anywhere else, descended from fiends summoned to serve the

Red Wizards. Other planetouched folk are less common, al-

though the cities of the Wizards Reach, once ruled by Unther,

are home to a few aasimars and genasi.

The green depths of the Yuirwood hide an ancient secret long

forgotten by folk beyond Aglaronds borders, and not widely

known even withinthe star elves, an elven subrace that re-

treated  from  Faern  to  an  extraplanar  refuge  known  as

Sildyuir. Sometimes referred to in ancient texts as mithral

elves, the star elves concealed the existence of their hidden

kingdom for almost two thousand years, leaving behind noth-

ing but mysterious ruins and old, strong magic in the stone cir-

cles of the Yuirwood.

While the star elves have kept themselves apart from the

rest of Faern for many centuries, their isolation is coming

to an end. Besieged by an insidious peril from beyond the cir-

cles  of  the  world,  they  face  the  possibility  of  being  driven

from Sildyuir back to their ancient abode in the Yuirwood.

Personality: Star elves are cautious and aloof, keeping an

emotional distance from events. They can be judgmental, al-

though they take their time and consider many factors before

passing judgment on a creature or action. Once won, a star

elfs  friendship  (and  enmity)  is  deep  and  long  lasting.  Star

elves love beauty in any form and have a knack for perceiv-

ing inner beauty rather than outward appearance and actions.

Among their own kind, star elves delight in song, dance, and

works of magic, but away from their homeland they are slow

to bestow the gift of their voice or artistry.

RACES OF THE EAST

Star Elf Racial Traits

Star elves have the following abilities and characteristics.

+2 Charisma, 2 Constitution: Star elves are graceful but

frail.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet.

Immunity to magic sleep spells and effects, and a +2 racial

saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.

Low-light Vision: Star elves can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, or similar conditions of

poor  illumination.  They  retain  the  ability  to  distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Otherworldly Touch (Su): Between sunset and sunrise a star

elf confers the ghost touch ability on any melee weapon she

wields  and  any  armor  she  wears,  but  only  so  long  as  she

keeps the weapon in hand or wears the armor. Star elves

have a magical affinity for starlight that gives them an un-

usual edge in fighting extradimensional foes.

Extraplanar (Su): Star elves are not outsiders, but they are

not native to Faern. Spells and effects that target extra-

planar  creatures  affect  star  elves.  Banishment,  dismissal,

and similar effects that banish outsiders return a star elf

to Sildyuir.

+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A star

elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed

door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were

actively looking for the door. A star elfs senses are so keen

that she practically has a sixth sense about hidden portals.

Star elves have no racial weapon proficiencies.

Automatic  Languages:  Common  and  Elven.  Bonus  Lan-

guages: By character region.

Favored  Class:  Bard.  A  multiclassed  star  elfs  bard  class

does not count when determining whether she suffers an

XP penalty.

Gnoll

Bestial and bloodthirsty, gnolls are a savage race of hyena folk

considered a blight upon the face of Faern by other races.

Great  numbers  of  gnolls  inhabit  the  Plateau  of  Thay,  pro-

viding the Red Wizards with fierce warriors to terrorize their

own people as well as the neighboring lands.

Personality: The typical gnoll has few redeeming virtues. He

is a cruel, hateful bully, quick to rob from or torment those

weaker than himself, and just as quick to grovel in the pres-

ence of those stronger. Lazy and ill-tempered, he prefers to

steal what he needs and murder anyone who objects. Only the

promise of loot and easy slaughter can stir him to real effort,

and even then he is likely to abandon ongoing tasks to indulge

his larcenous instincts unless a strong leader cows him into

obedience.

A small number of gnolls rise above the craven and violent

nature of their fellows, taking pride in their skill at arms and

their natural ferocity. While still contemptuous of weaklings,

these gnolls have a savage nobility and can endure privation

and real danger to prove theyre the toughest warriors around.

Where a common gnoll is all bluster and bullying, a superior

gnoll doesnt waste time on wordshe strikes hard and strikes

fast to get what he wants. A gnoll with such determination

and courage is rare and generally rises to a position of lead-

ership among his people.

Physical Description: If a hyena could walk on two legs and

carry weapons, it would not be far from a gnoll. Gnolls skin

is  a  greenish-gray  color,  and  the  furry  hide  is  marked  with

brown spots and a reddish-gray to dirty yellow mane. These

massive humanoids are nocturnal carnivores by nature, and

theyre  not  particular  about  who  or  what  they  eator,  for

that matter, whether its been cooked. A gnoll can stand up

to 7 1/2 feet in height.

Relations: No one harbors goodwill toward gnollkind, not

even gnolls themselves. Civilized folk such as humans or elves

view them as cruel, rapacious marauders no better than orcs

or  goblins,  and  even  other  savage  races  do  not  get  along

with them. Gnoll bands serve the Red Wizards of Thay out

of fear and the chance to plunder or torment those weaker

than themselves.

Alignment: Most gnolls are chaotic and evil, taking what

they want from anyone not strong enough to defend it, and

having  no  patience  for  rules.  Those  who  behave  otherwise

either bury their nature beneath slavish devotion to a more

powerful  master  or  drive  themselves  to  be  better  at  what

they do.

Religion: Gnolls worship Yeenoghu, a demon lord who is the

patron of their vile race. They are not particularly reverent,

but a tribe or clan down on its luck might propitiate Yeenoghu

through the sacrifice of living captives.

Language: Most gnolls speak only Gnoll, but player char-

acters speak Common as well. Bonus languages include Giant,

Goblin, Mulan, Orc, and Rashemi.

Names:  MaleBrask,  Durrash,  Faush,  Lask,  Thovarr,

Wesk; FemaleAmal, Hett, Ishtish, Senga. Surnames: Blood-

fang, Ear-taker, Face-ripper, Spearbreaker.

Adventurers: Generally regarded as vicious thugs and brig-

ands, most gnolls live down to expectations. However, in lands

where gnolls are common, a small number are reliable enough

(barely) to hold down jobs as guards, trackers, or hired muscle.

As a sword-for-hire, a gnoll usually falls in with the worst sort

RACES OF THE EAST

of adventuring party. At best, a gnoll adventurer is willing

to  go  along  with  good-intentioned  comrades,  provided  hes

paid well for his services and given the respect he feels his

prowess deserves.

Gnoll Racial Traits

Gnolls have the following abilities and characteristics.

+4 Strength, +2 Constitution, 2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma:

Gnolls are tough and strong, but are not especially bright

or personable.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet.

Darkvision: Gnolls can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Racial Hit Dice: A gnoll begins with two levels of human-

oid. This provides 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1,

and base saving throws of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.

Racial Skills: A gnoll characters humanoid levels give him

skill points equal to 5  (2 + Intelligence modifier). Gnoll

class skills are Listen and Spot.

Racial Feats: A gnolls humanoid levels give him one feat.

Natural Armor: +1 natural armor bonus.

Weapon Familiarity: Gnolls treat battleaxes and shortbows

as  simple  weapons.  No  gnoll  grows  to  adulthood  without

learning something about fighting.

Automatic Languages: Common, Gnoll. Bonus Languages:

By region.

Level Adjustment: +1. A gnoll has an effective character

level (ECL) of 3 plus class levels, so a 1st-level gnoll ranger

would have an ECL of 4. See the Powerful Races sidebar.

Favored  Class:  Ranger.  A  multiclassed  gnolls  racial  Hit

Dice  and  ranger  class  do  not  count  when  determining

whether he suffers an XP penalty.

Hagspawn

Sons  of  malicious,  predatory  mothers,  hagspawn  are  not  a

complete race, as there are no females of their kind. Hags con-

tinue their awful lineage by taking human males for mates,

usually  murdering  and  devouring  the  hapless  captive  later.

The female children of a hag quickly grow into hags like their

mothers, but the male children are hagspawn, half-human out-

casts. Feared and hated by normal humans, hagspawn must

make their way in the world by dint of their strength, hardi-

ness, and sheer determination.

Hagspawn  are  found  in  any  land  but  are  especially

common where many hags dwellRashemen, for example.

Personality: All  too  often,  hagspawn  are  filled  with  the

malice, violence, and resentment of their monstrous parent.

They are quick to take offense and view even the most in-

nocent remark as a hidden slight. People regard them as ill-

tempered monsters, and many hagspawn perpetuate distrust

of their kind by behaving exactly as expected. They look out

for  themselves  first  and  regard  companions  as  temporary

allies to be discarded when convenient. Unlike many other

evil-natured  creatures,  though,  hagspawn  are  capable  of

working furiously to achieve a desired end and do not shy

away from physical hardship or danger if the reward seems

worth the risk.

Many hagspawn overcome their evil tendencies and strive

to get along as best they can in human society, enduring the

suspicions  of  their  neighbors  while  proving  themselves

through their actions. Stoic and uncomplaining, a hagspawn

of this sort can be a great force against evil.

Physical  Description: Hagspawn  are  tall  and  powerfully

built, with long arms, big hands, and a hunched posture. Their

black  hair  is  long  and  lank,  and  their  eyes  gleam  red  with

malice. Their faces are heavy-featured and coarse, and their

skin color often hints at their mothers subracepallid blue

for the sons of annises, sickly green for a green hags spawn,

and so on. In lands where hags are scarce, a hagspawn might

pass for a loutish and ill-favored human, but the folk of the

East know them all too well.

Relations: Hagspawn dont get along well with anybody, al-

though  they  have  a  certain  sympathy  for  half-orcs  and

tieflings. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and other civilized non-

humans generally judge a hagspawn based on his deeds, but not

so  humans.  In  Rashemen,  hagspawn  are  infamous  for  their

evil tempers, violent natures, and depraved crimes, and they

can expect no welcome in a Rashemi village. A few individu-

als have overcome this social stigma by proving themselves

loyal and true, but most hagspawn either leave Rashemen or

die  bitter  and  young,  having  finally  done  something  awful

enough to rouse their neighbors against them.

Alignment: A typical hagspawn is a malefactor through and

through. Those who conquer their violent heritage dont fit in

with very lawful societies but do best where an individual is

judged on his own merits.

Religion: Hagspawn most often adopt a faith that appeals

to the lonely, embittered, and vengeful. Bane, Shar, and Cyric

are common patron deities, although the elemental fury of

Talos and the battle skill of Tempus also speak to the hag-

spawns violent nature. Good hagspawn most often worship

the  deity  of  whatever  community  they  eventually  find  a

home in.

Language: Hagspawn speak Common, Giant, and the human

language of their native region (usually Rashemi). Bonus lan-

guages depend on their home region.

Names:  Hagspawn  usually  take  simple  human  names  for

themselves in the language of their home region. In Rashe-

men, these include Bor, Dor, Josel, Kurg, Sergel, and Vladir.

Some claim their fathers surname, while others who do not

care to hide their heritage call themselves Hagson, or use

their monstrous mothers name.

Adventurers: In one sense, almost all hagspawn are adven-

turers, with dim prospects for staying at home and living as

normal members of a human community. Many are wander-

ing brigands, thugs, and sellswords, never staying too long in

any one spot lest their neighbors blame them for some crime

or misfortune. Hagspawn make good fighters and rogues and

are well suited to a life of violence and robbery.

Spirit Folk

Spirit folk are the descendants of humans and various spirits

of nature. They are not common in any land but are found

most often in and around Rashemen, a land renowned for its

guardian  spirits.  A  small  number  of  spirit  folk  can  also  be

found in Thesk, among Shou immigrants from distant Kara-

Tur. The spirit folk of the Unapproachable East belong to two

distinct branchesmountain spirits and river spirits.

Personality: Spirit folk tend to be serene, attuned to their

surroundings and at peace with the world. Their ancestry gives

them  an  awareness  of  the  spirit  world,  but  they  have  little

desire to manipulate that world through magic. They mani-

fest a love and enjoyment of life that many humans envy.

Physical Description: Spirit folk look human, although they

are fine-featured, with small mouths, thin eyebrows, and pale

or golden complexions. They have no facial or body hair, but

the hair on their heads is thick and luxurious. They appear in

all  the  diversity  that  humans  display,  although  most  spirit

folk in the East show Rashemi features and coloring. Many

are strikingly beautiful.

Relations: Spirit folk typically live as part of human soci-

ety, although they rarely remain in any one village or town

for more than a single human generation. Spirit folk prefer

to blend in with the surrounding population, acknowledging

human rulers and making their way through life as any full-

blooded human would. Their neighbors dont realize how dif-

ferent the spirit folk truly are and regard them as wise ones

who understand things most people do not perceive.

Spirit folk get along well with elves and fey creatures of all

sorts, as well as the spirits of Rashemen.

Alignment: Perhaps because of their strong ties to the nat-

ural world, spirit folk seek a benevolent balance between ex-

tremes. They tend toward neutral good alignment.

Religion:  Spirit  folk  share  the  religious  habits  of  their

human neighbors. In Rashemen, they often venerate Silvanus,

Mielikki, and Selne.

Language: Spirit folk speak Common, Sylvan, and the local

human language of their native regionusually Rashemi, but

sometimes Shou or Tuigan.

Names: Spirit folk of Rashemi descent usually have Rash-

emi names. Male: Andar, Chevik, Daumar, Hladislak, Ilvik,

Olek, Pergaur. Female: Ayvarra, Belmith, Emmezel, Gevarra,

Iseldra,  Karra,  Ranya.  Surnames:  Antonin,  Fyodorin,  Gu-

denny, Kerska, Molotva.

Adventurers: Some spirit folk more acutely feel their dif-

ferences from their human neighbors and take up the life of

an adventurer to find their way. More rarely, sheer wander-

lust impels spirit folk to explore the world and experience its

natural beauty.

Regions: Most of the spirit folk found in the Unapproach-

able  East  are  native  to  Rashemen  or  Thesk  and  choose  the

appropriate region. The Shou region is also appropriate for

spirit folk immigrants from Kara-Tur.

Mountain Spirit Folk

Racial Traits

Mountain spirit folk have the following abilities and char-

acteristics.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet.

Mountain  spirit  folk  have  a  base  climb  speed  of  30  feet.

They gain a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The moun-

tain spirit folk must make a Climb check to climb a wall or

slope with a DC of more than 0 but can always choose to

take  10,  even  if  rushed  or  threatened  while  climbing.  A

mountain  spirit  folk  who  chooses  an  accelerated  climb

moves at double the listed climb speed and makes a single

Climb check at a 5 penalty. Mountain spirit folk cannot

use the run action while climbing. They retain their Dex-

terity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and op-

ponents  get  no  special  bonus  to  their  attacks  against

climbing mountain spirit folk.

Low-Light Vision: Spirit folk can see twice as far as humans

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Balance,  Jump,  and  Tumble  checks.

Mountain spirit folk are at home on steep slopes and sheer

pinnacles that would terrify most humans.

Once  per  day,  a  mountain  spirit  folk  can  use  speak  with

animals  to  speak  with  any  bird.  This  ability  is  innate  to

mountain  spirit  folk.  It  has  a  duration  of  1  minute  (the

spirit folk is considered a 1st-level caster when using this

13

ability,  regardless  of  actual  level).  See  the  speak  with

animals spell description in the Players Handbook.

Automatic Languages: Common and Sylvan. Bonus Languages:

Aquan, Auran, Giant, Goblin, Mulan, Rashemi, Shou, Tuigan.

Favored Class: Any. A multiclassed spirit folks highest-level

character class does not count when determining whether

she suffers an XP penalty.

River Spirit Folk Racial

Traits

River spirit folk have the following abilities and characteristics.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet.

River spirit folk have a base swim speed of 30 feet. They do

not need to make Swim checks to swim normally. They gain

a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some spe-

cial action or avoid a hazard, and they can always choose to

take 10 on these checks, even if distracted or endangered

when swimming. They can use the run action while swim-

ming, provided they swim in a straight line.

Water  Breathing:  River  spirit  folk  can  breathe  water  as

easily as they breathe air.

Low-Light Vision: Spirit folk can see twice as far as humans

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like

effects with the word water in the name of the effect.

Once per day, a river spirit folk can use speak with animals

to speak with any fish. This ability is innate to river spirit

folk. It has a duration of 1 minute (the spirit folk is con-

sidered a 1st-level caster when using this ability, regardless

of actual level). See the speak with animals spell description

in the Players Handbook.

Automatic  Languages:  Common  and  Sylvan.  Bonus  Lan-

guages:  Aquan,  Auran,  Giant,  Goblin,  Mulan,  Rashemi,

Shou, Tuigan.

Favored Class: Any. A multiclassed spirit folks highest-level

character class does not count when determining whether

she suffers an XP penalty.

Taer

Primitive hunters of the icebound north, taers are cruel and

savage creatures who haunt the remote mountains and passes

of the East. They launch war parties into warmer lands, car-

rying off livestock, food stores, or even people for the clans

larder.  Even  more  so  than  other  evil  folk  such  as  orcs  or

gnolls, taers are regarded by other races as crude, bloodthirsty

beasts without a single redeeming quality.

Although taers regard other creatures as potential enemies

or meals, they possess a surprisingly complex store of oral his-

tories, rules for conduct within the clan, and tribal wisdom.

Long ago, the race developed a comprehensive code to govern

its tendency toward violence, at least between its own mem-

bers. Anyone not of the taers clan is beyond the protection

of  this  code  and  can  be  robbed,  murdered,  or  eaten  at  will.

Those few taers who wander into civilized lands either extend

their concept of clan to some other set of intelligent crea-

tures, such as a group of bandits, a village, or an adventuring

band, or quickly die at the hands of an angry mob.

Personality: They lack the cognitive and innovative intel-

ligence of humans and other such races, but taers are intuitive

and imaginative in their own way. They think in analogies and

metaphors, most of which are mythic sagas handed down by

the storytellers of the clan from generations past. Taers see

themselves as characters in a life-story that began long before

they were born and will go on long after they are dead.

Taers who leave their clans and learn to regard people of

other  races  as  fellow  tribesfolk  (as  opposed  to  prey)  slowly

weave  their  new  experiences  into  their  old  worldview,  con-

structing new myths to explain what they cannot understand

any  other  way.  A  taer  can  literally  turn  off  cognitive

thought and descend into bestial rage in the blink of an eye

to meet a physical challenge, but for days afterward, he pon-

ders the experience and seeks to explain what happened.

Physical  Description: Taers  are  powerfully  built  creatures

about 5 to 6 feet in height, with thickly muscled arms and ape-

like faces. They are covered in thick white fur that blends in with

snowy backgrounds, although their hands and faces are bare of

fur. Beneath their fur, their skin is dark gray and leathery in tex-

ture. A male taer weighs about 220 pounds, while a female is

more  lightly  built,  weighing  about  180  pounds.  Taers  carry

themselves in a crouch, their knuckles almost dragging on the

ground; a taer that straightens up stands almost 7 feet in height.

Relations: No other race gets along well with taers, although

frost giants, ogres, and white dragons occasionally ally with

a taer clan to achieve some greater goal. In turn, taers typi-

cally view all other creatures as either enemies or prey. A taer

who learns to include nontaer companions as part of his clan

can be a loyal comrade, but he often measures his companions

actions against taer expectations.

Alignment: Taers are drawn neither to law or chaos. They

value the complex rules of their clan life but yearn for wild

freedom. They tend to be evil, preying on nontaers too weak

to defend themselves. Even within the clan, taers use their tra-

ditions ruthlessly to attain the highest status possible. A fair

number of adventuring taers are of neutral alignment.

Religion: Taers possess a complex pantheon filled with spir-

its and mythical figures, but they most often revere aspects

of Auril the Frostmaiden and Loviatar. Giant deities such as

Grolantor and Thrym also appear in taer mythology.

Language: Taers speak Giant. Player character taers speak

Common as well. Bonus languages include Auran, Damaran,

Draconic, Orc, and Rashemi, although its a rare taer who can

manage more than two languages.

Names: Taers name themselves after landmarks and natu-

ral phenomena, preceded by a simple clan name. Examples in-

clude: Hrusk Mountain Thunder, Vulg Falling Ice, or Chark

Smoking Sky.

14

RACES OF THE EAST

Adventurers: Adventuring taer are almost always outcasts

from their clan, who were defeated in (or failed to pursue cor-

rectly) the endless taer measurement of fitness. They are more

comfortable joining a small band they can think of as a new

clan than living among the folk of a large settlement. Most

taer adventurers are simple brigands, but some become mer-

cenaries who sell their strength and ferocity, and a few rare in-

dividuals attach their loyalties to a band of good-hearted heroes.

Regions: Almost all taers choose the taer region, which de-

scribes an individual driven from his clan and sent into exile

in human lands. See Chapter 3: Regions and Feats.

Taer Racial Traits

Taers have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

+4  Strength,  +2  Constitution,  4  Intelligence  (to  a  mini-

mum of 3), 2 Charisma: Taers are tough and tremendously

strong, but are insular and do not have the reasoning ca-

pacities of other races.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet, climb speed 30 feet. Taers gain a +8

racial bonus on all Climb checks. A taer must make a Climb

check to climb a wall or slope with a DC of more than 0 but

can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened

while  climbing.  A  taer  who  chooses  an  accelerated  climb

moves at double the listed climb speed and makes a single

Climb  check  at  a  5  penalty.  Taers  cannot  use  the  run

action while climbing. They retain their Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no

special bonus to their attacks against climbing taers.

Racial Hit Dice: A taer begins with two levels of giant. This

provides 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base

saving throws of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.

Racial Skills: A taer characters giant levels give him skill

points equal to 5  (2 + Intelligence modifier). Taer class

skills are Climb, Hide, and Spot. A taers pelt blends in with

snowy backgrounds, conferring a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks in snow-covered locales.

Racial Feats: A taers giant levels give him one feat.

Weapon Familiarity: Taers treat greatclubs and longspears

as simple weapons.

Giant: Taers are not subject to spells or effects that affect

only humanoids, such as charm person or dominate person.

Darkvision: Taers can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Natural Armor: +2 natural armor bonus.

Natural Attacks: An unarmed taer can make two slam attacks

at his normal attack bonus and a bite attack at a 5 penalty

on his normal attack bonus. The taers slam attacks deal 1d3

points of damage, and the bite deals 1d4 points of damage.

Cold Subtype (Ex): Taers are immune to cold damage but are

vulnerable  to  fire  attacks.  They  take  half  again  as  much

(+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a

saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Automatic Languages: Common, Giant. Bonus Languages:

By character region.

Level Adjustment: +1. A taer has an effective character level

(ECL)  of  3  plus  class  levels,  so  a  1st-level  taer  barbarian

would have an ECL of 4. See the Powerful Races sidebar.

Favored  Class:  Barbarian.  A  multiclassed  taers  barbarian

class does not count when determining whether he suffers

an XP penalty.

Volodni

More than a thousand years ago, at the end of the terrible

wars that racked Narfell and Raumathar, a proud Nar lord led

a  host  of  his  people  into  the  great  forests  of  the  ancient

empire, seeking to escape the roaming demons and magical

plagues that ravaged his lands. Some power of the old woods

perhaps an elder treant, or even the Oakfather himselfcon-

fronted  the  Nar  refugees  to  deny  them  refuge  unless  they

forswore their demon-summoning ways and agreed to take the

forests blood for their own. The lord agreed on the spot, con-

vinced that any bargain was better than returning to certain

destruction, but the price was greater than he could imagine:

He and his followers surrendered their humanity in exchange

for sanctuary. Thus the volodnis, the pine folk, were born.

The volodnis are a humanlike race of treefolk who defend

their  forest  homes  with  iron  resolve.  Unlike  other  sylvan

beings, volodnis aggressively seek to expand into new forests

and grow the borders of old ones, regardless of who gets in the

way. Many feel that only the fall of warm folk civilization

can preserve Faerns forests, but others hope to peacefully

persuade humans to allow the return of the ancient forests.

Personality: Volodnis are cold and dispassionate, remorse-

less in pursuit of any tactic that serves their ends. They re-

member every injury but have the patience of the forest itself

when  exacting  vengeance.  They  are  not  acquisitive,  as  they

have little need for material possessions. Some volodnis feel

the blood of their human ancestors more deeply than others

and are capable of benevolenceor spitefulness and crime.

Physical Description: Volodnis resemble their human fore-

bears, but their skin is the deep olive-green of a pine needle,

and their flesh is woody and tough. Clear sap runs through

their veins instead of blood, and their hair grows in long, thick

locks scaled like the bark of a young tree. Their eyes are gleam-

ing black, and they tend to be tall and lean, with wide shoul-

ders and long arms. The pine folk favor weapons and armor

made  from  leather  and  wood,  dyed  in  green  and  brown  to

blend in with the terrain of their forest home.

Relations:  Volodnis  get  along  reasonably  well  with  other

sylvan creatures such as centaurs and satyrs and usually work

toward  the  same  ends  as  elves.  They  revere  treants  and  are

warm to druids of any race, but they do not care for people who

see a forest only as uncut firewood and unbuilt homes. Those

who despoil natural settings out of spite rather than necessity

wake a volodnis latent hostility into pure, cold rage (the most

militant volodnis see no difference between the two actions).

Consequently, volodnis harbor a stronger dislike for goblins,

orcs, and such creatures than they do for dwarves or humans.

15

RACES OF THE EAST

Alignment: Volodnis are not actively malicious, but they

are not benevolent, either. They believe in the individuals call

to act as he or she sees fit rather than laws and rules to guide

behavior and so favor a chaotic disposition.

Religion: As one might expect, the pine folk have a strong

druidic tradition. Druid circles govern their society, and all

volodnis venerate nature gods. Among the forest deities they

hold a deep reverence for Silvanus the Oak Father.

Language: Volodnis speak Common and Sylvan as well as

the  human  language  of  the  surrounding  regionusually

Damaran or Rashemi in the East. They often learn Draconic,

Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, or Treant to communi-

cate with creatures of the woodlands.

Names: The pine folk go by simple human names, usually

followed by a description of a favorite forest locale, such as

Andror of the Deepspring, Harl of the Old Grove, or Mara

of  the  Windridge.  Male:  Andror,  Huvast,  Isilvor,  Leped,

Normol,  Strevast,  Yevgen.  Female:  Atryanna,  Hela,  Kari,

Lara, Naskyara, Slaela, Zashi.

Adventurers:  Volodnis  who  leave  their  home  forest  to

wander the world are unusual, but not as rare as one might

think. The pine folk have a great desire to explore and see the

wonders  of  Faerns  surviving  forests.  Volodni  druids  and

rangers go out into the world to protect woodlands and to spy

out the civilized lands near their homes.

Regions: Most volodnis choose the volodni region, which re-

flects a pine folk character native to one of the large forests

of the Great Dale. (See Chapter 3: Regions and Feats.) A small

number of volodni characters choose human character regions

such as Rashemen, the Great Dale, or Thesk.

Volodni Racial Traits

Volodnis have the following abilities and characteristics.

+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, 2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma:

Volodnis are hardy and intuitive, but are not exceptionally

bright or personable.

Medium-size.

Orcs of the East

Races of Faern describes the gray orcs, the orcs of the east-

ern lands. Descended from the hordes that invaded Faern in

the  Orcgate  Wars,  the  gray  orcs  are  a  distinct  subrace  of

orckind with their own unique abilities and traits. Mountain

orcs (common orcs) can be found in Thesk and the northern

borderlands  of  the  Unapproachable  East,  but  many  of  the

orcs  of  the  Sunrise  Mountains  and  the  Endless  Wastes  are

gray  orcs.  The  orcs  of  Thay  include  large  numbers  of  both

subraces; while the gray orcs invaded the Thayan Plateau in

great numbers long ago, for centuries now the Red Wizards

have imported mountain orc mercenaries and slaves.

Gray orcs look less bestial than their more savage north-

ern  kin  but  are  still  obviously  nonhuman.  They  are  some-

what hairy, with long manes of bristly hair on their heads,

shoulders, and backs. Their faces are less porcine than the

mountain orcs, with the exception of their tusks. They have

yellow,  orange,  or  red  eyes,  lupine  ears,  and  black  or  gray

hair.  Gray  orcs  are  more  apt  to  wear  civilized  clothing

than  mountain  orcs  and  prefer  varying  shades  of  brown,

black,  blue,  and  other  dark  colors.  Skin  tones  are  usually

gray with mottled patches of lighter or darker gray on the

chest and flanks.

Unlike common orcs, gray orcs are nomads. They dwell in

remote,  desolate  regions  and  eke  out  a  meager  existence  as

they  can,  traveling  along  traditional  migratory  routes

between established campsites and favorite caves as the sea-

sons  change.  When  resources  in  an  area  run  low,  a  tribe

moves on to greener fields.

A typical gray orc tribe consists of thirty to fifty members,

led by the strongest orc in the tribe. The true power behind a

tribe  of  gray  orcs,  though,  is  the  tribes  high  priest,  who  is

typically an adept or cleric (often female) who has held the

position for many years. The gray orcs are zealots, and the

word of their tribal clerics is law.

Gray orcs all possess the following racial traits.

+2  Strength,  2  Intelligence,  +2  Wisdom,  2  Charisma:

Gray orcs are not as strong as mountain orcs, but they tend

to be much more independent and strong-willed.

Medium-size.

Gray orc land speed is 40 feet. Their gait is long and loping

and they can cover great distances quickly.

Proficient with the greataxe and longbow; gray orcs train

with weapons from childhood.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Gray orcs take a 1 penalty on attack

rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Scent (Ex): Gray orcs have the scent ability, as detailed in

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Orc Blood: For all special abilities and effects, a gray orc is

considered an orc. Gray orcs, for example, can use or create

orc  weapons  and  magic  items  with  racially  specific  orc

powers as if they were orcs.

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Orc.  Bonus  Languages:

Draconic, Giant, Goblin.

Favored Class: Cleric. Gray orcs are comfortable with the

savage life of the barbarian, but they tend to be more calm

and  devout  than  northern  orcs,  focusing  their  rage  and

hatred inward. This allows them to excel as clerics of the

warlike orc deities.

Level Adjustment: +1. A gray orc has an effective charac-

ter level (ECL) of 1 plus class levels, so a 1st-level gray orc

cleric would have an ECL of 2.

16

RACES OF THE EAST

Land speed 30 feet.

Cold resistance 5.

+4 racial bonus on Hide checks in wooded terrain.

Low-Light Vision: Volodnis can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Plant: Volodnis are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, and polymorphing. They are not subject to critical hits

or mind-affecting effects.

Half damage from Piercing: Piercing weapons deal only half

damage to volodnis, with a minimum of 1 point of damage.

Sustenance: Volodnis require only 2 hours of sleep per day

to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep (although arcane

spellcasters  must  still  have  8  hours  of  rest  to  prepare

spells).  Volodnis  only  require  one-quarter  the  food  and

water  a  human  requires,  as  they  absorb  nutrients  from

their environment.

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Sylvan.  Bonus  Lan-

guages: By character region.

Level Adjustment: +2. A volodni has an effective character

level (ECL) of 2 plus class levels, so a 1st-level volodni druid

would have an ECL of 3. See the Powerful Races sidebar.

Favored Class: Druid. A multiclassed volodnis druid class

does not count when determining whether he suffers an

XP penalty.

Age, Height,

and Weight

The details of your characters age, gender, height, weight, and

appearance are up to you. However, if you prefer some rough

guidelines, refer to Tables 12 through 14.

Character Age

Your characters starting age is determined by your choice of race

and class, as summed up on Table 12: Random Starting Ages.

For example, a taer barbarians starting age is 10 + 1d4 years

(1114), while a volodni ranger is 20 + 3d6 years old (2338).

When a character becomes venerable, the DM secretly rolls

to  determine  her  maximum  age.  This  is  the  sum  of  the

number from the Venerable column for that race in Table

13: Aging Effects plus the modifier from the Maximum Age

column. When a character reaches her maximum age, she dies

of old age at some point in the following year, as determined

by the DM.

Height and Weight

Choose your characters height and weight from the ranges

mentioned  in  the  racial  description,  or  roll  randomly  on

Table 14: Random Height and Weight. The dice roll given

in the Height Modifier column determines the characters

extra height beyond his base height. That same number mul-

tiplied by the dice roll given in the Weight Modifier column

determines  the  characters  extra  weight  beyond  his  or  her

base weight.

the unique powers of the archmage and combine those with

their own formidable talents, while a smaller number choose

to affiliate themselves with the faith of Kossuth as devotees.

Shadow adepts are scarce but most likely to be found among

Red  Wizards  specializing  in  illusion  or  necromancy.  Some

Rashemi clerics, particularly males, take up the path of the

runecaster,  as  do  a  few  of  the  secretive  star  elves.  Harper

scouts and Purple Dragon knights are virtually unheard-of in

the Unapproachable Eastthose orders simply do not have

much to do with eastern lands.

This chapter presents a number of prestige classes unique to

the East: the Aglarondan griffonrider, the Black Flame zealot,

the  durthan,  the  master  of  the  Yuirwood,  the  Nar  demon-

binder, the Nentyar hunter, the Raumathari battlemage, the

runescarred berserker, the Shou disciple, the Talontar blight-

lord, the Telflammar shadowlord, and the Thayan slaver.

Aglarondan

Griffonrider

Soaring above the Yuirwood and the coasts of Aglarond, the

famed Aglarondan griffonriders are an elite force of aerial

knights  who  serve  the  Simbul  and  defend  their  homeland

against attack. Griffonriders study aerial combat and develop

special skills for fighting from the sky. Fighters, paladins, and

rangers  are  most  common  among  their  ranks,  but  a  small

number of clerics and wizards also have become griffonriders.

All griffonriders hold the rank of velskoon (a mid-ranking of-

ficer)  in  Aglaronds  army  and  possess  broad  powers  to  com-

mandeer Aglarondan soldiers, enforce the Simbuls laws, and

keep the peace in their homeland. While many griffonriders are

palace guards, scouts, messengers, or company commanders, in

practice, they have a great deal of latitude in the pursuit of their

duties. Griffonrider scouts range far over the plains of Thesk

and the plateau of Thay, watching the armies of the Red Wiz-

ards. Because of their loyalty and skill, many griffonriders un-

dertake dangerous tasks of spying and infiltration, leaving their

The  Unapproachable  East  is  home  to  secret  soci-

eties,  elite  orders,  and  forgotten  paths  to  power,

both good and ill.

Of the prestige classes described in the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide, the assassin is by far the most common in the East. The

folk of Thay and Thesk both possess long traditions of assas-

sination and are home to guilds or sects of professional mur-

derers.  Blackguards  are  relatively  common  in  Thay,  but

thankfully  scarce  in  other  lands,  and  usually  serve  as

autharchs or guard-captains to powerful Red Wizards. Shad-

owdancers are common in Thesk, especially among the Shad-

owmasters of Telflamm. The elves of the Lethyr Forest boast

a number of arcane archers in their ranks, but dwarven de-

fenders are rare in the Eastthere simply are not any large

dwarven  settlements.  Loremasters  are  highly  regarded  in

Aglarond but not widely known elsewhere. While some Red

Wizards take up the loremasters arts to seek hidden knowl-

edge  that  might  aid  them  in  their  various  enterprises,  few

Thayans have the patience for slowly distilling the secrets of

true power from musty old tomes when quicker (if more dan-

gerous) paths to knowledge exist.

Most of the classes presented in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting are common in the East. As one would expect,

hathrans  are  prevalent  in  Rashemen;  most  female  Rashemi

spellcasters choose the Ethran feat early in their careers and

enter the hathran prestige class as soon as possible. Similarly,

most arcane spellcasters in Thay aspire to the Red Wizard pres-

tige class and steer their advancement in that direction.

Arcane devotees and archmages are both found among the

Aglarondans and Thayans. Many Red Wizards are drawn to

feathered mounts behind and relying on wits and stealth in-

stead. Some griffonriders are trustworthy enough to operate

completely on their own, advancing Aglaronds cause in what-

ever manner they deem appropriate.

The typical NPC griffonrider is a 4th-level human or half-

elf  fighter  who  selects  feats  and  skills  suitable  for  aerial

combat, rather than taking levels in the Aglarondan griffon-

rider class. In general, NPC griffonrider commanders are re-

sponsible for leading the Simbuls forces and supervising her

palace guard. Player character griffonriders are detached for

special service or the recipients of an honorary title. A char-

acters level in this prestige class is irrelevant to her rank in

Aglaronds  military,  although  higher-ranked  griffonriders

tend to be of higher level.

The griffon retains its own type and gains no abilities other

than  those  listed,  although  the  griffonrider  may  be  able  to

confer the ability to perform special maneuvers. The griffon-

rider can have only one bonded mount at a time, and either

party may sever this relationship at any time without penalty

(although the griffon almost never does so unless the griffon-

rider violates the griffonrider code described below).

If the griffonrider is a paladin, she may designate the grif-

fon as both her bonded mount and her special paladin mount.

In  this  case,  the  mount  abilities  described  under  Paladin  in

Chapter  3:  Characters  of  the  Players  Handbook  supersede

those  listed  on  Table  22  here,  and  the  paladin  adds  her

griffonrider levels to her paladin levels to determine which

abilities her bonded mount gains.

Griffonrider Level: The characters griffonrider levels only.

If the mount receives negative levels, treat it as the mount of

a correspondingly lower-level griffonrider.

Bonus Hit Dice: These are extra ten-sided (d10) Hit Dice, each

of which gains a Constitution modifier as normal. Extra Hit

Dice also improve the griffons base attack and base save bonuses.

Natural Armor Bonus: This number is an improvement to

the griffons natural armor bonus.

Strength  Adjustment:  Add  this  figure  to  the  griffons

Strength score. This is not a cumulative adjustment.

Flyby Attack: While an Aglarondan griffonrider is on her

bonded mount, both she and her griffon have access to the

Flyby Attack feat described in the Monster Manual.

Aerial Evasion (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, when an Agla-

rondan griffonrider is airborne on her bonded mount, both she

and her mount gain the benefit of evasion. If exposed to any

attack that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex

saving throw for half damage, the character and her mount

may attempt a single saving throw at the better of their two

Reflex saving throw bonuses. If successful, both the griffon-

rider and her mount take no damage. Aerial evasion cant be

used if the griffon is carrying a medium load.

At 8th level, the griffonrider and her mount gain superior

aerial evasion. This works like aerial evasion, except they take

only half damage on a failed saving throw.

Improved Mounted Combat (Ex): At 3rd, 5th, and 7th level,

an Aglarondan griffonrider increases by one the number of Ride

checks she may attempt each round to negate a hit against her

mount (two times per round at 3rd, three times per round at

5th, and four times per round at 7th). The hit is negated if the

griffonriders Ride check result is greater than the attack roll.

Hover  (Ex):  Starting  at  4th  level,  when  an  Aglarondan

griffonrider is on her bonded mount, her mount gains the abil-

ity to hover much as some dragons do. When flying, the grif-

fon  can  halt  its  forward  motion  and  hover  in  place,  fly

straight down, or fly straight up, regardless of its maneuver-

ability. While hovering, the griffon can perform a full attack

action but cannot rake.

Power Dive (Ex): At 6th level, an Aglarondan griffonrider

gains  the  ability  to  direct  her  bonded  mount  to  perform  a

power dive attack while she is riding it. The griffon must begin

its move at least 50 feet above its target, and it uses the charge

action to attack with both foreclaws simultaneously, making

a  single  attack  that  deals  2d4  +  (Strength  bonus   1  1/2)

points  of  damage.  The  griffon  may  fly  past  the  target  and

alter course after it makes its attack.

Superior  Flight  (Ex):  From  9th  level  on,  when  an  Agla-

rondan  griffonrider  is  airborne  on  her  bonded  mount,  her

mounts fly speed increases to 100 feet (good). The griffon-

rider knows how to encourage the best possible performance

from her mount.

Fell Swoop (Ex): When an Aglarondan griffonrider reaches

10th level, her mount deals double damage in a power dive

attack, as if it knew the Spirited Charge feat.

THE GRIFFONRIDER CODE

A griffonrider is sworn to defend the people of Aglarond, obey

the orders of the Simbul or her duly authorized proxy, and

uphold the laws of the land.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Replacement Mounts: If the griffonriders mount is slain,

she may obtain a new mount at no cost the next time she gains

a level in the Aglarondan griffonrider prestige class. (Some

griffonriders  prefer  to  have  a  slain  mount  raised  or  resur-

rected at their own expense to avoid the delay.) The griffon-

rider and her new mount require three days of training before

the griffonriders special benefits accrue. If a griffonrider loses

her third mount and does not replace the mount at her own

expense, she becomes an ex-griffonrider as noted below.

Ex-Griffonriders: A griffonrider who loses three mounts or

who fails to uphold the griffonrider code loses all

special abilities derived from this prestige class.

rangers are simply scarce in Thay, and sorcerers and wizards

more often pursue arcane paths to power in service to Kos-

suth, such as arcane devotee. Paladins are simply incompati-

ble with the Order of the Black Flame.

Trained in the rites of Kossuths

temple, the Black Flame zealots

use stealth, divine magic, and the zeal

of  fanaticism  to  destroy  those  who

have  given  offense  to  the  Lord  of

Flames. Even the mighty zulkirs are

not above Kossuths wrath, since the

Order is a sanctioned and respected

means  for  wealthy  and  powerful

Thayans to pursue vendettas.

Clerics of Kossuth, monks, and partic-

ularly devout rogues or fighters most often

become Black Flame zealots. A small number

of the orders members are high-ranking cler-

ics of the Firelord who keep an eye open for

fellow  devotees  who  seem  like  suitable  candi-

dates. Barbarians and bards tend to lack the spiri-

tual  devotion  necessary  for  the  class,  druids  and

ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks.

Feats:  Exotic  Weapon

Proficiency  (kukri),  Iron

Will.

Spellcasting: Able to

cast 2nd-level divine spells.

Special: Sneak attack damage +1d6.

Special: Kossuth must be the char-

acters patron deity, and the charac-

ter must slay an enemy of the faith

for  no  other  reason

than  to  join  the  Order

of the Black Flame.

CLASS SKILLS

The Black Flame zealots class skills (and

PRESTIGE CLASSES

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Black Flame zealot

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Black Flame zealots gain

no proficiency in any weapon or armor.

Spells  per  Day:  At  every  other  Black  Flame  zealot  level

beginning with 2nd, the character gains new spells per day as

if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to

which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He

does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that

class would have gained (improved chance of turning or de-

stroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on).

This  essentially  means  that  he  adds  half  the  level  of  Black

Flame zealot to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class

the character has, then determines spells per day and caster

level accordingly.

If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class

before becoming a Black Flame zealot, the player must decide

to which class to add each Black Flame zealot level for the

purpose of determining spells per day.

Death  Attack  (Ex):  As  the  assassin  ability,  except  that

Black Flame zealots do not have the option of paralyzing

their targets. If a Black Flame zealot has levels in the as-

sassin prestige class (see Chapter 2: Characters in the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide), he may add his assassin and Black

Flame zealot class levels together to calculate the save DC

of his death attack.

Zealous  Heart  (Su):  A  Black  Flame  zealot  is  immune  to

fear,  magical  or  otherwise.  Unlike  a  paladins  aura  of

courage, this confers no special benefits on his companions.

Poison Use (Ex): At 2nd level, a Black Flame zealot gains

the ability to use poison safely, as the assassin ability.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex): At  3rd,  6th,  and  9th  level,  a  Black

Flame  zealot  deals  additional  sneak  attack  damage  as  the

rogue ability. Since the Black Flame zealot gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses

to damage stack.

Fateful Stride (Sp): Once per day at 5th level and above, a

Black Flame zealot can take a single step and pass through ob-

stacles  or  distance  as  the  spell  dimension  door.  The  zealots

caster level is equal to half his character level.

Sacred Flame (Su): Beginning at 6th level, at will, a Black

Flame  zealot  can  command  a  single  melee  weapon  in  his

possession  to  burn  with  a  black,  deadly  fire.  The  weapon

gains the flaming special ability, dealing 1d6 points of fire

damage  per  successful  attack  in  addition  to  its  normal

weapon damage. Once per day, the Black Flame zealot can

bestow the flaming burst special ability on a weapon in his

possession for 1 minute.

Unholy  Immolation  (Su):  When  a  Black  Flame  zealot

reaches 10th level, any creature killed by his death attack

or sneak attack is immediately consumed utterly by unholy

fire.  The  only  way  to  restore  life  to  a  being  slain  in  this

manner  is  to  use  true resurrection, a  carefully  worded  wish

spell followed by resurrection, or miracle.

Durthan

Durthans are an order of evil spellcasters who tap into the

darker  spirits  of  Rashemen.  They  use  their  powers  to

punish  their  enemies  and  those  who  have  offended  the

spirits. The durthans seek to wrest control of their home-

land from the Witches of Rashemen and rule it with an

iron hand, torturing secrets out of their enemies and using

that knowledge to expand Rashemens power. Like those of

the  hathrans,  durthans  abilities  are  greater  than  other

spellcasters of their level while they are within the borders

of Rashemen.

All  durthans  are  skilled  in  some  form  of  arcane  magic.

Some come from the ranks of the hathrans, but most have

always worked against the Witches. Durthans are covetous

of power, even among other durthans, and share spells with

others  only  if  the  recipient  is  useful  to  the  greater  cause.

Like hathrans, durthans usually wear masks, if only to fool

others into thinking they are Witches in good standing.

Durthans  work  together,  although  they  protect  their

identities behind masks. Outside their homes, the durthans

assassinate  or  spy  upon  enemies,  follow  Rashemi  women

who  might  be  turned  to  their  cause,  and  work  to  recover

Rashemi spells and magic items. Within Rashemen, they do

all the former but also plot against the hathran hierarchy,

send angry spirits to punish the careless, and manipulate the

secular  rulers.  Individual  durthans  work  on  elements  of

these plans or pursue their own agendas, usually with the

help  of  trusted  minions  and  whatever  spirits  they  have

bound to their will.

Just  as  fallen  paladins  may  trade  in  paladin  levels  for

blackguard levels, hathrans who adopt the philosophy of the

durthans may trade in hathran levels for durthan levels. Be-

cause most of these former hathrans no longer meet the re-

quirements of the hathran prestige class (usually because of

alignment reasons), this change allows the new durthan to

regain most of the abilities she would otherwise lose. Clever

durthans use the possibility of this conversion to help sway

potential hathran recruits to their cause.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a durthan, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Gender: Female.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Feats: Improved  Counterspell  (FRCS),  Iron  Will,  any

metamagic feat.

Spellcasting: Able to cast 2nd-level arcane spells and 2nd-

level divine spells.

Special: The character must qualify to select regional feats

from Rashemen (Rashemen is her home region, or she has 2

ranks in Knowledge [localRashemen]).

22

CLASS SKILLS

The durthans class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Intim-

idate (Cha), Knowledge (all skills taken individually) (Int),

Profession (Wis), Swim (Str), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival

(Wis). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook for skill

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the

durthan prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Dur-

thans gain no proficiency in any weapon

or armor.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  At  each

durthan  level,  the  character  gains  new

spells per day (and spells known, if appli-

cable) as if she had also gained a level in a

spellcasting  class  to  which  she  belonged

before adding the prestige class level. She

does not, however, gain any other ben-

efit  a  character  of  that  class  would

have  gained  (improved  chance  of

turning or destroying undead, metam-

agic or item creation feats, and so on).

This essentially means that she adds the

level of durthan to the level of whatever

spellcasting  class  the  character  has,

then  determines  spells  per  day  and

caster  level  accordingly.  If  the  char-

acter had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a durthan, the

player must decide to which class to

add each durthan level for the pur-

pose of determining spells per day.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

divine spellcaster levels (in other words, she does not reassign

these level increases when converting levels in this manner).

The durthans also have a short custom spell list. These spells

are  arcane  spells  and  must  be  acquired  as  any  other  arcane

spell.  They  use  spell  slots  of  the  appropriate  level  in  the

durthans arcane spellcasting class.

DURTHAN SPELL LIST

4th levelcontrol winds.

5th levelcommune with nature.

6th levelrepel wood.

7th levelwaterspout (FRCS).

8th levelwhirlwind.

9th levelelemental swarm.

Place Magic: Durthans possess a special bond

to the land of Rashemen

that lets them draw upon

the  power  of  the  spirits  to

cast spells without preparing

them.  When  a  hathran  or

durthan uses place magic, she

can  cast  any  arcane  or  divine

spell known to her. (Spells on her

hathran or durthan spell list can be

cast  as  either  arcane  or  divine

spells, as she desires.)

A place magic spell uses an unas-

signed spell slot of the appropriate type

(arcane or divine) and level. If the caster

does  not  have  an  open  spell  slot,  she  may

spontaneously lose a prepared spell of the appro-

priate  type  and  level  to  cast  her  place  magic

spell. Using place magic takes longer than cast-

ing a spell normally; any spell that takes 1 stan-

dard action to cast requires 1 full round to cast

with  place  magic.  Spells  with  casting  times

longer than 1 standard action simply add 1

round to the casting time. For more information,

A  character  who  has  converted  hathran

levels to durthan levels retains the same alloca-

tions of caster level increase among her various arcane and

Durthan

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Telthor Companion: Beginning at 3rd level, a durthan

acquires a telthor (see the Telthor entry in Chapter 6: Mon-

sters of the East) as a companion creature. The telthor must

be an animal with the telthor template. This spirit creature

is loyal to the durthan in the manner of a familiar or special

mount. It has a supernatural bond to her rather than to a

specific  location,  and  it  remains  healthy  as  long  as  it  stays

within one mile of the durthan. The telthor has a number of

Hit Dice up to the durthans class level (not her total char-

acter level); as the durthan gains levels, the telthor

advances  in  Hit  Dice  as  the  base

creature. The durthan may dismiss

her telthor at any time (normally

in an area suitable for the telthor

to  live,  for  even  the  cruelest  dur-

thans respect the spirits of the land).

If her telthor is dismissed or slain, the

durthan may acquire another telthor

after one month.

At 7th level, the durthan gains

a second telthor companion. Each

telthor  may  have  a  number  of

Hit Dice equal to the durthans

class  level  (or  fewer)  and  ad-

vances  in  Hit  Dice  as  she

gains levels.

Cold Resistance (Ex): At 4th

and  6th  levels,  a  durthan  be-

comes increasingly resistant to

cold, gaining cold resistance in

the amount listed on the table.

Cold Immunity (Ex): At 9th

level, a durthan becomes com-

pletely immune to cold damage.

Utter Cold (Su): At 10th level,

a  durthan  may  call  upon  the

primal  cold  of  winter  that  annu-

ally blankets Rashemen to make her spells

more difficult to resist. The save DC for any spell

she casts with the cold energy descriptor increases by +2. This

increase is cumulative with those granted by the Spell Focus

or Greater Spell Focus feats.

Master of the

Yuirwood

The masters of the Yuirwood are an elite group of foresters

who work to keep the ancient Yuirwood free of evil influence.

They strive to halt the retreat of this proud forest that once

covered the entire Aglarondan peninsula, and in some

regions they have actually been able to re-

claim some of that lost land. The mas-

ters make frequent use of the menhir

circles  that  dot  the  Yuirwood,  em-

ploying these portals to swiftly take

them from one part of the forest

to another. They can also activate

the portals to take them to distant

lands or even other worlds.

Most  masters  of  the  Yuirwood

start out as rangers, although there

are  also  a  number  of  druids  in

their  ranks.  Paladins  of  nature

gods  might  be  interested  in

this class, and it sometimes at-

tracts  fighters  and  bards.

Monks,  rogues,  sorcerers,  and

wizards  find  that  the  life  of  a

master  of  the  Yuirwood

dwelling in the forest, always

on the lookout for threats to

its  healthrarely  fits  with

their preferences.

The masters of the Yuirwood

spend  most  of  their  days  pa-

trolling  the  forest,  protecting  it

from strangers who may damage the

place (intentionally or not). They work in

conjunction with the half-elves of the forest, and

they  are  traditionally  loyal  to  the  ruler  of  Aglarond.  The

Simbul holds a special place in their hearts, for she has done

more than any recent ruler to defend the Yuirwood herself.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

The masters of the Yuirwood follow a loose meritocracy.

Those of lower level are obliged to listen to the wisdom of

those  of  higher  level.  The  leadernever  called  rulerof

their organization is the person who has the most levels as a

master of the Yuirwood.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a master of the Yuirwood, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Elf or half-elf.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Skills: Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, Survival 10 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Track.

Special: The character must qualify to select regional feats

from Aglarond or the star elf region (the region is his home

region, or he has 2 ranks in Knowledge [localAglarond or

star elf]).

CLASS SKILLS

The master of the Yuirwoods class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Handle

Animal (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (nature)

(Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis),

Search (Int), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

See  Chapter  4:  Skills  in  the  Players  Handbook for  skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are features of the master of the Yuirwood

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Masters of the Yuirwood

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with light

armor, and with shields.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each master of the Yuir-

wood level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spell-

casting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige

class  level.  He  does  not,  however,  gain  any  other  benefit  a

character of that class would have gained (improved chance

of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation

feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level

of  master  of  the  Yuirwood  to  the  level  of  whatever  spell-

casting class the character has, then determines spells per day

and caster level accordingly.

If the character had more than one spellcasting class before

becoming a master of the Yuirwood, the player must decide to

which class to add each master of the Yuirwood level for the

purpose of determining spells per day.

Work Menhir Circle (Su): Once per day per class level, the

master of the Yuirwood can activate the menhir circles scattered

throughout the Yuirwood. These circles act as keyed portals (see

Chapter 2: Magic in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Set-

ting), transporting users to any other menhir circle in the Yuir-

wood or to the star elf realm of Sildyuir. The master of the

Yuirwood can choose which menhir circle he wishes to travel to.

Once activated, the portal remains open for 1 full round. During

this time, any creature touching one of the menhirs is trans-

ported to the destination the master of the Yuirwood chose.

At 4th level, the master of the Yuirwood can use a Yuir-

wood menhir circle portal to transport himself to any circle

of standing stones in any wooded region in Faern, regardless

of whether or not the destination stones are a portal terminus,

although  he  must  have  knowledge  of  the  destination  he  is

trying to reach.

At 7th level, the character can use this ability to return to

a  menhir  circle  in  the  Yuirwood  from  a  circle  of  standing

stones in a wooded region anywhere in Faern, regardless of

whether the origination circle is a portal terminus or not. In

effect,  the  master  can  create  a  one-way  portal that  lasts  1

round from any suitable spot, as long as the destination is a

menhir circle in the Yuirwood.

At 10th level, the master of the Yuirwood can use a menhir

circle to transport to a ring of menhirs in any wooded region

in another world, although he must have knowledge of the des-

tination he is trying to reach. He can return to the Yuirwood

from a menhir circle in another world, regardless of whether

the origination circle is a portal terminus or not.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a master of

the  Yuirwood  gains  uncanny  dodge  as  the  rogue  ability,  re-

taining his Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed. At

5th level, he gains the improved uncanny dodge ability and

cannot  be  flanked  except  by  a  rogue  of  at  least  four  levels

higher.  If  a  master  of  the  Yuirwood  has  another  class  that

grants the uncanny dodge ability, he gains improved uncanny

dodge instead.

Pass without Trace (Sp): At 3rd level, a master of the Yuir-

wood can use pass without trace once per day, affecting up to

one creature per class level.

Speak  with  Animals (Sp):  At  6th  level,  a  master  of  the

Yuirwood can use speak with animals at will.

Forests Grace (Ex): At 9th level, a master of the Yuirwood

applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all

saving throws.

Nar Demonbinder

Master of the black art of demon summoning, the Nar de-

monbinder  keeps  alive  the  sinister  traditions  of  the  old

Empire of Narfell. More than a thousand years ago the sor-

cerous  land  of  Narfell  grew  mighty  on  the  strength  of  its

unholy mages and cruel priest-lords. Although Narfells traf-

ficking with demons contributed to its eventual downfall, se-

crets of the old Nar lore still draw unscrupulous spellcasters

who plunder the buried vaults of the long-vanished land in

search of knowledge and power, as well as more principled re-

searchers who pursue this forbidden lore to battle demons.

25

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Nar demonbinders are most often clerics, sorcerers, or wiz-

ards. Bards and druids do not have access to the spells necessary

to  call  up  and  command  fiendish  creatures,  and  the  prestige

class demands high spellcasting ability simply to qualify.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Nar demonbinder, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Skills: Intimidate 5 ranks, Knowledge (the planes) 10 ranks,

Sense Motive 2 ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, Spell Focus (conjuration).

Spellcasting: Able to cast 4th-level arcane or divine spells,

knowledge of at least one summon monster spell.

Languages: Abyssal.

CLASS SKILLS

The  Nar  demonbinders  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Decipher

Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge

(arcana,  the  planes)  (Int),  Profession  (Wis),  Sense  Motive

(Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Nar demonbinder

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Nar demonbinders gain no

proficiency in any weapon or armor.

Spells Per Day: Beginning at 1st level, a Nar demonbinder

gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. He

gains arcane spells per day according to Table 26. He must

learn and choose his spells from the Nar demonbinder spell

list, below. The characters caster level is equal to his Nar

demonbinder level plus his levels in one other spellcasting

class of his choice. To cast a spell, the demonbinder must

have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spells level. De-

monbinder bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving

throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level +

the  demonbinders  Charisma  modifier.  Nar  demonbinders

prepare and cast their demonbinder spells as sorcerers, as

shown below.

Fiendish Familiar: A Nar demonbinder can call a fiendish

familiar. Doing so takes a day and uses up magical materials

that cost 100 gp. The demonbinder may choose either an imp

or a quasit as a familiar, just as if he knew the Improved Fa-

miliar feat and were an arcane spellcaster of the appropriate

level. The fiendish familiar is magically linked to its master

just like a normal familiar. The imp or quasit uses the basic

statistics for a creature of its kind as given in the Monster

Manual,  with  the  following  exceptions.  (Unless  otherwise

stated,  for  all  fiendish  familiar  abilities  dependent  on  the

masters level, count only sorcerer/wizard levels and Nar de-

monbinder levels, which stack for the purposes of determin-

ing the familiars abilities.)

Hit Points: One-half of the masters total or the fiendish fa-

miliars normal total, whichever is higher.

Attacks:  Use  the  masters  base  attack  bonus  or  the

fiendish familiars, whichever is better. Use the familiars Dex-

terity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the

familiars melee attack bonus with unarmed attacks. Damage

equals that of a normal creature of that kind.

Special Attacks: The fiendish familiar has all the special

attacks of its kind.

Special Qualities: The fiendish familiar has all the special

qualities of its kind.

Saving Throws: The fiendish familiar uses the masters base

save bonuses if they are better than its own. The familiar uses

its own ability score modifiers on saves, and it doesnt enjoy

other bonuses that the Nar demonbinder might have (such as

from magic items or feats).

Skills: Use the normal skill ranks for a creature of that kind,

modified by the fiendish familiars own ability score modifiers.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Familiar Special Abilities: Use Table 319: Familiar Spe-

cial Abilities in the Players Handbook to determine additional

abilities as you would for a normal familiar. The character

may add any levels of sorcerer and/or wizard to his Nar de-

monbinder  class  level  for  purposes  of  determining  his

fiendish familiars special abilities.

Inimical Casting (Ex): A Nar demonbinder knows how to

employ spells that deflect the attacks of outsiders, regard-

less  of  alignment.

When  a  Nar  demon-

binder  casts  one  of  the

spells  listed  below,  he

may  choose  one  of  the

listed effects instead.

Magic  circle  against  good

can  be  cast  as  magic  circle

against  evil,  magic  circle

against chaos, or magic circle

against law.

Dispel good may be cast as

dispel  chaos,  dispel  evil,  or

dispel law.

Blasphemy  may  be  cast  as

dictum, holy word, or word of chaos.

Unholy aura may be cast as holy

aura, cloak of chaos, or shield

of law.

Iron  Sign:  On  reaching  2nd

level, a Nar demonbinder learns how

to fashion a special token known as an

iron  sign.  Creating  the  token  re-

quires  three  days  and  1,000  gp  in

magical materials. The iron sign is

the  size  of  a  large  amulet.  The  de-

monbinder can use it in one of two ways.

Calling  Diagram:  The  iron  sign  func-

tions as a calling diagram (see Conjuration

under  Schools  of  Magic  in  Chapter  10:

Magic of the Players Handbook) that combines

a magic circle with dimensional anchor. The demonbinder need

only  set  the  token  on  a  suitable  surface,  and  no  Spellcraft

check is necessary to scribe the diagram. A creature held by

the iron sign must remain within 5 feet of it and otherwise

behaves as if it were completely enclosed in a suitably sized

calling diagram.

it is transported to a square of its choice within 5 feet of the

iron sign, and trapped just as if the demonbinder had conjured

it into a calling diagram.

When a trapped creature leaves the iron sign (because it was

freed by the demonbinder, escaped on its own, or the duration

of the calling diagram lapsed), the token crumbles into powder

and is destroyed.

Master Summoner (Ex): At 3rd level, a Nar demonbinder

gains a +4 bonus on opposed Charisma checks to trap

or compel creatures called through any planar bind-

ing spell.

Brazen Sign: On reaching 4th level, a Nar de-

monbinder learns how to fashion a brazen sign. This

works exactly like the iron sign, except that

the called creature cannot use its spell re-

sistance  to  attempt  to  break  out  of  the

calling diagram or to resist being caught

in  the  demon  trap.  Crafting  a  brazen

sign requires five days and the expendi-

ture of materials worth 2,000 gp.

Infernal  Certitude  (Ex):  Due  to

his long study of demons, devils, and

such  creatures,  a  5th-level  Nar  de-

monbinder  gains  a  +4  bonus  on

spell penetration checks against

any outsider.

Silver Sign: On reach-

ing  6th  level,  a  Nar  demonbinder

learns how to fashion a silver sign. This

works  just  like  the  brazen  sign, except

that the DC of the Charisma check for

the called creature to escape increases by

+5,  and  none  of  its  attacks  or  abilities

can  exit  the  area  within  5  feet  of  the

token. Crafting a silver sign requires seven days

and the expenditure of 5,000 gp in materials.

Baleful Energy (Ex): On attaining 7th level,

when a Nar demonbinder casts a spell that deals

damage, one-half of the damage dealt is derived

directly from infernal power and is therefore not reduced by

resistance to the energy type of the damaging spell. In the case

of flame strike, the entire damage of the spell is derived from

infernal power and is not subject to fire resistance (although

targets are still permitted spell resistance and saving throws).

Nar Demonbinder

The iron sign can hold a called creature for up to one day

per  caster  level  of  the  character  who  crafted  it.  Unlike  a

normal  calling  diagram,  the  iron  sign cannot  be  disturbed

unless something physically removes the token from the spot

where it was placed (naturally, the called creature cannot dis-

turb the token either directly or indirectly).

Demon Trap: As a full-round action, the demonbinder can

set the token on a suitable surface and try to compel a free

outsider within 30 feet of the token into its effective calling

diagram (Will save negates, DC 10 + Nar demonbinder level

+ Nar demonbinders Charisma modifier). The subject is en-

titled to spell resistance. If the creature fails its saving throw,

NAR DEMONBINDER SPELL LIST

Demonbinders can learn all spells on the following list.

missal,  lesser  planar  binding,  magic  circle  against  good,

Nentyar Hunter

Sworn to defend the great forests and serve the Nentyarch,

druidic ruler of the Circle of Leth, the Nentyar hunters roam

the wild lands of the East, uprooting foul and evil things.

Skilled  with  both  steel  and

magic, a Nentyar hunter is a re-

sourceful, self-reliant hero who

has  learned  to  trust  her  own

judgment,  confronting  those

who would harm the forest. The Nentyar

hunters  are  few  in  number,  but  even  a

single hunter is capable of achiev-

ing great things in the service of

the lands she loves.

Barbarians  and  rangers  are

the  most  common  Nentyar

hunters,  as  the  prestige  class

offers access to powerful forest

magic  to  complement  their

skill at fighting. Druids are less

commonly drawn to the class,

since  many  of  the  Nentyar

hunters  spells  are  druid  spells,

and  the  Nentyar  hunters  are

sworn to protect druids and carry

out  their  edicts.  Fighters  and

rogues with a preference for wilder-

ness skills sometimes become Nent-

yar hunters, but clerics, sorcerers,

and wizards do not often choose

this path.

Most  Nentyar  hunters  are

humans, elves, or volodnis.

Hit Die: d6.

hunters Wisdom modifier. Nentyar hunters prepare and cast

their hunter spells as druids.

Woodland  Stride  (Ex):  A  Nentyar  hunter  may  move

through  any  sort  of  undergrowth  (such  as  natural  thorns,

briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal

speed and without taking damage or suffering other impair-

ment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are

magically  manipulated  to  impede  normal  movement  still

affect her.

Swift Tracker (Ex): At 2nd level, a Nentyar hunter gains

the ability to move at normal speed while following tracks

without taking the normal 5 penalty.

Swiftness of the Stag (Su): At 3rd level, a Nentyar hunters

speed increases by +10 feet when she is wearing no armor or

light armor and is not carrying a heavy load.

Eyes of the Hawk (Ex): A Nentyar hunter develops preter-

naturally sharp vision and gains a +4 bonus on all Spot checks

at 4th level.

Heart of the Lion (Su): At 5th level, a Nentyar hunter be-

comes  immune  to  fear,  magical  or  otherwise.  Unlike  a  pal-

adins aura of courage, this confers no special resistance to fear

on any of her allies.

NENTYAR HUNTER SPELL LIST

Nentyar hunters have access to all spells on the following list.

Raumathari

Battlemage

Enemies of ancient Narfell, the Raumathari sorcerers of old

were fearsomely powerful evokers whose spells could scatter

demonic armies like chaff in the wind. Few mages still living

have studied the lore of Raumathar, but those who have are

some of the most dangerous men and women on the face of

Faern. Employing sword and spell with dauntless courage and

deadly  force,  the  handful  of  Raumathari  battlemages  re-

maining in the world comprise a lonely and little-known order

of adventurers, explorers, and mercenaries in search of battle.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Raumathari battlemage, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

sword), any one metamagic feat.

Spellcasting: Able to cast 3rd-level arcane spells and knowl-

edge of at least four evocation spells.

Languages: Able to read Roushoum and the Imaskari script

Proficiencies: Proficient with martial weapons.

Special: The  character  must  find  a  mentor  who  already  has

levels in Raumathari battlemage and spend at least ten days study-

ing in the mentors company. During this time of study, both

CLASS SKILLS

The Raumathari battlemages class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Craft (Int), Concentration (Con), Decipher Script

(Int), Knowledge (arcana, history) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride

(Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha). See Chap-

limit.  The  maximum  allowable  spell  level  and  number  of

times per day this ability can be used increase as noted below.

All the following are class features of the Raumathari battle-

mage prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Raumathari battlemages

gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each Raumathari battle-

mage level (except 5th), the character gains new spells per day

(and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level

in a spellcasting class to which he be-

longed  before  adding  the  prestige

class level. He does not, how-

ever, gain any other benefit

a  character  of  that  class

would have gained (improved

chance of turning or destroying

undead,  metamagic  or  item

creation feats, and so on). This

essentially  means  that  he

adds  the  level  of  Raumathari

battlemage  to  the  level  of

whatever spellcasting class the

character  has,  then  deter-

mines  spells  per  day  and

caster level accordingly.

If  the  character  had

more than one spellcasting

class  before  becoming  a

Raumathari  battlemage,  the

player  must  decide  to  which

class  to  add  each  Raumathari

battlemage level for the purpose

of determining spells per day.

Sword  Focus  (Su):  A  Rau-

mathari  battlemage  may  per-

form  a  special  rite  to  make  a

single sword into a focus for his

spells. The focus sword can then

replace any material component

of less than 50 gp value in the cast-

ing  of  the  battlemages  spells.  The

sword  is  not  consumed  or  damaged  by

its use as a focus, although it must be in hand to be used in this

way. The Raumathari battlemage gains +1 caster level with

any spell cast through his sword focus.

The  rite  to  create  a  sword  focus  requires  three  days  and

1,000 gp in magical materials as well as a masterwork weapon.

Magic swords may be attuned as sword foci. A battlemage may

attune only a single sword at a time; if he loses the weapon,

he must repeat the rite to create a new sword focus.

Channel Spell (Su): As a free action, a Raumathari battle-

mage can cast a spell through his melee weapon (usually his

sword) as he attacks with it. He gains an attack bonus equal

to the level of the channeled spell for that attack only. The

channeled spell counts against the battlemages normal daily

The number of channel attempts

Spell IV cant use his ability ten

levels.

A  channeled  spell  targets

the  creature  hit  by  the  battle-

mages weapon, which still gets a

saving throw if the spell allows

one. Even if a spell can target

more than one creature, chan-

neling  it  through  the  weapon

limits its effect to the single op-

ponent  attacked.  If  the  weapon

attack misses, the channeled spell

is  wasted.  The  spell  to  be  chan-

neled must have a range of touch,

be a ray effect (in which case the

ray  affects  only  the  creature  at-

tacked), or specify a creature as the

target. For example, sleep is not el-

igible  since  it  does  not  affect  a

target creature.

Battle  Spell  (Su):  As  a  free

action,  the  Raumathari  battle-

mage  may  apply  a  single  metam-

agic  feat  to  a  spell  as  he  casts  it.

Unlike  a  bard  or  sorcerers  use  of

metamagic  feats,  this  does  not  affect

the  casting  time  of  the  spell.  At  2nd

level, the battlemage may use this abil-

ity once per day and apply the Silent Spell feat to the battle

spell he chooses to cast.

At 4th level, the battlemage gains a second battle spell per

day, which he can still as per the Still Spell feat.

At 6th level, the battlemage gains a third battle spell per

day, which he can empower as per the Empower Spell feat.

At 8th level, the battlemage gains a fourth battle spell per

day, which he can quicken as per the Quicken Spell feat.

At 10th level, the battlemage gains a fifth battle spell per

day, which he can maximize as per the Maximize Spell feat.

Sublime Sword (Su): At 5th level, the save DC of any spell

cast  through  the  Raumathari  battlemages  sword  focus  in-

creases by 1.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Runescarred

Berserker

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  runescarred  berserker,  a  character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Deadly barbarians who bear magical runes carved into their

flesh, runescarred berserkers are among the most feared of

Rashemens defenders. They are

loyal  bodyguards  to  the

hathrans of the land and stand

ready  to  unleash  a  storm  of

martial  fury  at  a  single  word

from  any  Witch.  Many  rune-

scarred  berserkers  bind  them-

selves  to  a  single  Witch  and

protect her with their very lives,

but  others  become  the  chieftains

of  berserker  lodges  or  take  up  a

simple existence as a wandering de-

fender of the Rashemi people. The

word of a Witch is law in Rashemen,

but  runescarred  berserkers

carry  a  weight  of  authority

almost  as  great  in  some

quarters of the land.

All runescarred berserkers

have at least some experience

as barbarians, since the abil-

ity  to  rage  is  a  require-

ment  of  the  prestige

class.  Characters  with

some  training  as  fight-

ers, rangers, and rogues are also

common among the ranks of the

runescarred.  Spellcasters  rarely

choose  this  path,  because  Rashemi

society defines other roles for them.

Monks and paladins have antithetical

alignment  requirements,  and  only

characters  who  have  abandoned  one  of  these

classes can become a berserker.

Hit Die: d10.

a berserker lodge. (For more information

about  berserker  lodges,  see  Chapter  10:

Rashemen.) Also, the character must qual-

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Scribe Runescar (Sp): At 1st level, a runescarred berserker

learns how to carve a runescar into her own skin. A runescar is

a  means  of  storing  a  spell,  much  like  a  scroll.  The  berserker

knows only a limited number of spells with which to imbue rune-

scars, selected from the runescarred berserker spell list below. To

learn a runescar spell, the berserker must have a Wisdom score

of at least 10 + the spell level. A runescar berserker can only cast

spells by crafting them as runescars; she has no other spellcasting

capability and cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic

items based on spells from this list.

Scribing a runescar takes 1 hour, the expenditure of ma-

terials equal to 5 gp  spell level  caster level, and the ex-

penditure of XP equal to 1/25th the gp spent. The character

may set the caster level of the runescar at anywhere from the

minimum class level necessary for her to know the rune to

her own runescarred berserker class level. She may scribe a

runescar only on her own body. The act of scribing a rune-

scar is painful and deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level

at the end of the scribing time. (The berserker is free to heal

this damage by any normal means afterwardthe runescar

remains until activated.)

A runescarred berserker can bear no more than seven rune-

scars  at  any  one  time:  two  on  the  chest,  two  on  the  upper

arms,  two  on  the  backs  of  the  hands,  and  one  on  the  face.

Runescars are dormant until activated and cannot be dispelled

(although they can be suppressed).

Runescars  are  considered  divine  spells,  although  a  ber-

serker does not actively prepare or cast them. The save DC,

if  necessary,  is  10  +  spell  level  +  the  berserkers  Wisdom

score.  To  activate  a  runescar,  the  character  must  take  a

standard  action  and  touch  the  rune.  All  runescar  spells

target only the runescarred berserker or an item in her pos-

session, even if the spell scribed could normally be bestowed

on another subject.

After activation, the runescars magic is discharged, and

the rune fades to nothing but a faint outline. Typically, a

berserkers  skin  is  crisscrossed  with  dozens  of  old,  dis-

charged runescars.

Extra Rage (Ex): A runescarred berserker gains additional

daily uses of the barbarian rage ability. At 2nd level, she gains

one additional rage per day; at 5th level, she gains a second ad-

ditional  rage;  and  at  9th  level,  she  gains  a  third  additional

rage. For example, a barbarian 8/runescarred berserker 5 can

rage three times per day from her barbarian levels, plus two

more times from her runescarred berserker levels, for a total

of five rages per day.

Ritual Scarring (Ex): Through frequent disfiguration of her

own skin, a runescarred berserker gains a +1 natural armor

bonus to AC at 3rd level. This increases to +2 at 6th level, and

+3 at 9th level.

Spawn of the Frost (Su): Inured to the bitter cold of Rashe-

mens winters, a runescarred berserker gains cold resistance 5.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex):  Starting  at  4th  level,  a  rune-

scarred  berserker  gains  the  ability  to  shrug  off  some

amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from

the damage the berserker takes each time she is dealt damage

from a weapon or natural attack. At 7th level and 10th level,

this damage reduction increases to 2 and then 3 points. This

overlaps (does not stack with) damage reduction from any

other class feature.

Greater  Rage:  Starting  at  8th  level,  a  runescarred  ber-

serkers rage bonuses become +6 to Strength, +6 to Constitu-

tion, and a +3 morale bonus on Will saves. Her AC penalty

remains 2.

RUNESCARRED BERSERKER SPELL LIST

Runescarred berserkers must select their runescar spells known

from the following list.

1st  levelcure  moderate  wounds,  divine  favor,  low-light

vision*, protection from chaos/evil/good/law, resist elements, see

invisibility, true strike.

2nd levelbulls strength, cure serious wounds, darkvision,

endurance, invisibility, keen edge, protection from elements.

3rd levelair walk, cure critical wounds, death ward,

tion, righteous might, spell immunity, stoneskin.

5th levelantimagic field, dimension door, heal, polymorph

self, spell resistance.

New spell described in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells.

Shou Disciple

Shou  disciples  are  martial  artists  who  have  studied  or  ob-

served  the  monks  of  Kara-Tur  and  seek  to  emulate  their

style.  Focusing  more  on  the  martial  aspects  of  a  monks

training, they sacrifice the enlightenment and supernatural

abilities of the true ascetic. Shou disciples fight with martial

weapons and often wear armor, instantly marking them as

different from monks.

Fighters and rogues are the most likely to become Shou dis-

ciples, although some bards study the martial arts of Kara-

Tur to enhance their combat ability. Clerics of athletic deities

may train in this manner, and a few true monks have become

Shou disciples to maximize their skill with weapons at the ex-

pense of some supernatural abilities. Barbarians usually prefer

other methods of disabling opponents, most druids follow a

more spiritual path, and sorcerers and wizards would rather

spend their time developing their magic, so members of those

classes rarely become Shou disciples.

Shou disciples work alone or together. The loners are usu-

ally  wanderers  in  the  manner  of  traveling  monks,  seeking

wisdom  or  worthy  opponents.  Those  in  groups  are  usually

members  of  the  same  gang  or  training  school,  since  skilled

Shou  disciples  often  retire  to  found  their  own  academies,

teaching these Kara-Turan martial arts to those who are will-

ing to learn.

To  qualify  to  become  a  Shou  disciple,  a

character must fulfill all the following

criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

Base Reflex Save: +2.

Skills: Balance  4  ranks,  Jump  8  ranks,

Tumble 4 ranks.

Feats: Dodge,  Improved  Unarmed

Strike, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike).

Special: The character must qualify

to  select  regional  feats  from  the

Shou  expatriate  or  Thesk  regions

(the region is her home region, or she

has  2  ranks  in  Knowledge  [local

Shou expatriate or Thesk]).

CLASS SKILLS

The  Shou  disciples  class  skills

(and the key ability for each skill)

are  Balance  (Dex),  Climb  (Str),

Craft  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),

Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Jump  (Str),

Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim

ter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook for

skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Shou Disciple

All the following are class features of the Shou disciple

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:

Shou disciples are proficient with

martial  weapons  and  light

armor, as well as with the

following  monk  weap-

ons:  kama,  nunchaku,

and  siangham.  Light

armor  does  not  interfere

with any of a Shou disciples class

abilities,  but  shields  and  medium  or

heavy armor do. When wearing medium or

heavy armor or using a shield, the Shou

disciple  loses  his  class  dodge  bonus

and any flurry of blows ability.

Dodge Bonus (Ex): Shou disciples

are highly trained at dodging blows.

When a Shou disciple designates an

opponent  for  his  Dodge  feat,  this

bonus replaces the normal +1 dodge

bonus to AC against that opponent.

A condition that makes him lose his

Dexterity bonus to AC also makes him

lose this dodge bonus.

Unarmed Strike (Ex): As the monk abil-

ity, except that a Shou disciple deals unarmed

damage as shown on Table 210. A Shou disciple

with levels in the monk class can take the better of the

two damage ranges, or he can add his Shou disciple levels

Multiclassed Monks and Unarmed Attacks

A Shou disciple with monk levels adds his monk base attack

bonus and his Shou disciple base attack bonus and uses the

unarmed attack progression of a monk with the same base

attack bonus. For example, a Monk 6/Shou disciple 5 has a

base attack bonus of +4 from his monk levels and +5 from

his Shou disciple levels, totaling +9, and uses the unarmed

attack bonus of a monk with a +9 base attack bonus.

The character does not use his base attack bonus from any

33

other class levels in this determination, unless the class allows

unarmed  attacks  like  the  monks.  For  example,  a  monk  6/

fighter 2/Shou disciple 5 has a base attack bonus of +11 but

an  unarmed  base  attack  bonus  of  only  +9.  A  character  can

always choose to use his base attack bonus progression instead

of his unarmed attack bonus to make unarmed attacks. It will

usually be to his advantage to do so if he has several levels

that are in neither monk nor Shou disciple.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

to his monk levels and use the unarmed damage of a monk of

the resulting level if that produces a better result.

Martial Flurry (Ex): At 3rd level, a Shou disciple gains the

ability to use any light melee weapon for his flurry of blows,

not just special monk weapons. At 5th level, the Shou disciple

may use any melee weapon for his flurry of blows.

Bonus Feat: At 2nd and 4th level, a Shou disciple gets

a  bonus  feat,  which  must  be  drawn  from  the  following

list: Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Endurance, Exper-

tise,  Improved  Initiative,  Improved  Trip,  Mobility,

Power Attack, Spring Attack, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon

Specialization.  The  character  must  meet  all  the  feats

prerequisites to select it.

Talontar

Blightlord

Corrupt priests who revel in decay, the blightlords of Talona

are feared and reviled throughout the Unapproachable East.

Their plagues have transformed the western reaches of the

Rawlinswood into a foul green hell of diseased monsters and

deadly poisons. Worse yet, the blightlords seek to infect the

healthy  forests  and  lands  nearby  with  the  same  sickness.

Under the tutelage of the horrible Rotting Man, the Talon-

tar blightlords marshal the Rawlinswoods black horde, lead-

ing their infected minions forth to scourge the nearby lands.

(For more on the Rotting Man and his minions, see Chapter

9: The Great Dale.)

Most of the blightlords are drawn from evil clerics, druids,

or rangers who venerate Talona, the Mother of All Plagues.

A handful of fighters, barbarians, and sorcerers have become

captains of the Rotting Mans armies, but since the prospec-

tive blightlord must have access to divine spells, any such can-

didate must have at least some levels in a divine spellcasting

class to qualify.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Talontar blightlord, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Feats: Great Fortitude.

Spellcasting: Able to cast 4th-level divine spells.

Proficiency: Glaive. A druid who wields a glaive is in viola-

tion of her spiritual oaths, but a character may take a Mar-

tial  Weapon  Proficiency  feat  with  the  weapon  and  simply

refrain from wielding it until she qualifies for the blightlord

class.

Patron Deity: Talona.

CLASS SKILLS

The Talontar blightlords class skills (and the key ability for

each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Handle

Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Hide  (Dex),  Knowledge  (local,

nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Int), Spellcraft (Int),

Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis). See Chapter 4: Skills in the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Talontar blightlord

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Talontar blightlords gain

no proficiency in any weapon or armor. Druids who become

Prestige Domains

The  Talontar  blightlord  gains  access  to  the  Blightbringer

prestige  domain.  A  prestige  domain  functions  just  like  a

normal cleric domainthe character gains a granted power

associated with the domain and access to a special spell list. A

character with cleric spellcasting ability may choose to pre-

pare  a  spell  from  the  Blightbringer  prestige  domain  as  her

domain spell at any given level when she prepares spells.

Characters  with  druid  or  ranger  spellcasting  ability  who

acquire a prestige domain gain an extra domain spell per day

at each spell level. In effect, they are like clerics with only

one domain. The character only gains an additional domain

spell for each spell level she can cast normallyso a ranger,

whose  spell  capability  reaches  its  maximum  at  4th-level

spells, does not gain domain spells for 5th through 9th level.

BLIGHTBRINGER PRESTIGE DOMAIN

Deity: Talona.

Granted Power: Rebuke or command blightspawned creatures and

evil-aligned animals or plants as an evil cleric rebukes undead. You

may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your

Charisma modifier. This is a supernatural ability.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

blightlords no longer need abide by their weapon and armor

restrictions,  as  the  blightlords  turn  their  backs  on  the  con-

ventional druidic traditions.

Spells  Per  Day:  At  every  Talontar  blightlord  level

(except 6th and 10th), the character gains new divine spells

per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spell-

casting class to which she belonged before adding the pres-

tige class level. She does not,

however, gain any other ben-

efit a character of that class

would have gained (improved

chance  of  turning  or  de-

stroying  undead,  metamagic

or item creation feats, and so on).

This  essentially  means  that  she

adds  the  level  of  Talontar  blightlord

to  the  level  of  whatever  spellcasting

class  the  character  has,  then  deter-

mines spells per day and caster level

accordingly.

If the character had more than

one divine spellcasting class before

becoming  a  Talontar  blightlord,

the  player  must  decide  to  which

class  to  add  each  Talontar  blight-

lord level for the purpose of deter-

mining spells per day.

Blightbringer  Prestige  Domain:

At 1st level, a Talontar blightlord

gains  access  to  the  Blightbringer

prestige  domain,  described  in  the

sidebar.  The  domain  must  be  as-

signed to the characters spell pro-

gression  in  an  existing  divine

spellcasting class.

Blightblood (Ex): A Talontar blight-

lord  is  completely  immune  to  all  disease,

magical or otherwise. Blightspawned creatures

(see Chapter 6: Monsters of the East) do not attack

her unless she attacks them, although they may attack other

creatures in her company.

Illmaster:  Any  animal  companions  a  blightlord  possesses

gain the blightspawned template (see Chapter 6: Monsters of

the East). This does not affect the number of animal com-

panions she may have at any given time.

Blight Touch (Su): Starting at 3rd level, once per day as a

standard action, a Talontar blightlord may attempt a melee

touch attack to infect a victim with Talonas blight.

Talonas Blight: Supernatural diseaseby spell, Fortitude

save (DC 10 + Talontar blightlord class level +

Talontar  blightlords  Wisdom  modifier),  incu-

bation  period  1d6  days;  damage  1d4  Constitu-

tion and 1d4 Charisma. Unlike normal diseases,

Talonas  blight  continues  until  the  victim

reaches Constitution 0 (and dies), Charisma

0 (possibly becoming a blightspawned crea-

ture,  if  it  is  a  valid  type),  or  receives  a

remove disease spell or similar magic.

At 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Talon-

tar blightlord gains one more use of this

power per day.

Blightmind  (Su):  On  reaching  4th

level, once per day as a standard action,

a  Talontar  blightlord  may  establish  a

mental link with and dominate (as dom-

inate monster) a single blightspawned

creature  within  60  feet.  The  mental

link  lasts  for  up  to  1  minute  per

blightlord level and has a range of up

to  one  mile.  While  the  link  is  in

effect, the blightlord may concentrate

to  receive  sensory  input  from  the

linked creature or issue it instructions.

(The creature obeys any orders to the

best of its ability and need not be con-

tinuously directed in its assigned tasks.)

The  blightspawned  creature  receives  a

Will saving throw (DC 10 + Talontar blight-

lords  class  level  +  Talontar  blightlords  Wisdom

modifier) to negate the effect.

Talontar Blightlord

Black Glaive (Su): Starting at 6th level, any glaive wielded

by a Talontar blightlord gains the icy burst ability, dealing

+1d6 points of bonus cold damage on a successful hit (or +2d10

points on a successful critical hit). In addition, the blightlord

can make a normal melee attack with the glaive to deliver her

blight touch attacks.

Corrupting Blows (Su): An 8th-level Talontar blightlords

black glaive gains the wounding ability. A creature struck by

the black glaive loses 1 hit point per round on the blightlords

action.  Multiple  hits  by  the  blightlord  have  no  additional

effect and deal no additional wounding damagea creature is

either wounded or it is not. The wounding damage continues

until  the  victim  is  treated  with  a  successful  Heal  check

(DC 20) or receives magical healing.

Winterheart (Ex): At 10th level, a Talontar blightlords in-

fected blood effects a terrible change in her physiology. Her

skin blackens and splits, becoming cold and slimy to the touch,

although  she  does  not  bleed  or  suffer  pain  from  this  trans-

formation. Her type changes to plant, which means (among

other  things)  that  she  is  no  longer  subject  to  poison,  sleep,

mind-affecting effects, paralysis, polymorphing, critical hits,

sneak attacks, or spells and effects that affect humanoids only.

Telflammar

Shadowlord

The Shadowmasters of Telflamm are one of Faerns most no-

torious thieves guilds, a secret society every bit as grasping

and ruthless as the Night Masks of Westgate or the Shadow

Thieves of Amn. Under their subtle and cloaked rule, Thesks

port city of Telflamm is a prime center of trade in both legal

and illicit goods.

The  Shadowmasters  are  made  up  of  burglars,  murderers,

and thugs with a variety of talents, including assassins, experts,

fighters,  rogues,  shadowdancers,  and  warriors.  A  small

number of clerics devoted to Mask belong to the guild, as do

some arcane spellcasters whose greed outweighs their scruples.

Above all these criminals stand the Telflammar shadowlords,

the secret captains of iniquity who demand unquestioned obe-

dience  from  their  numerous  minions.  Characters  of  other

classes  may  hold  important  positions  in  the  guild,  but  the

shadowlords call the shots.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Telflammar shadowlord, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: The character must possess the shadow-walker tem-

plate, which is conferred by a special rite consecrated to Mask

(see Chapter 6: Monsters of the East). Members in good stand-

ing of the Shadowmasters guild can arrange for the rite of

transformation by gifting 2,000 gp to Masks temple in Tel-

flamm; others must give at least 10,000 gp and perform a

service of some kind for the clerics of Mask. A character who

is not a shadow-walker can still qualify for the Telflammar

shadowlord prestige class, but he must meet the spellcasting

requirement below.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills: Hide 10 ranks, Move Silently 10 ranks.

Feats: Blind-Fight, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack.

Spellcasting:  If  the  character  is  not  a  shadow-walker,  he

must either possess the ability to shadow jump (as the shad-

owdancer prestige class ability) or be able to cast dimension

door as a spell or spell-like ability.

Special: Sneak attack damage +2d6.

Special: The character must qualify to select regional feats

from Thesk (the region is his home region, or he has 2 ranks

in Knowledge [localThesk]).

CLASS SKILLS

The Telflammar shadowlords class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha),

Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex),

Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Open Lock (Dex), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sleight of

Hand  (Dex),  Spot  (Wis),  Tumble  (Dex),  Use  Magic  Device

(Cha),  and  Use  Rope  (Dex).  See  Chapter  4:  Skills  in  the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Telflammar shad-

owlord prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Telflammar shadowlords

gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.

Spells  Per  Day/Spells  Known:  At  each  Telflammar  shad-

owlord level, the character gains the ability to cast a small

number of arcane spells. He gains arcane spells per day ac-

cording to Table 212 and must choose his spells from the

Telflammar  shadowlord  spell  list,  below.  The  shadowlords

caster level is equal to his Telflammar shadowlord level. To

cast a spell, the shadowlord must have an Intelligence score

of at least 10 + the spells level. Telflammar shadowlord bonus

spells  are  based  on  Intelligence,  and  saving  throws  against

these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the shadowlords

Intelligence modifier. When the shadowlord gets 0 spells of

a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the shad-

owlord gets only bonus spells. The shadowlord prepares and

casts spells just as a wizard does.

Shadowsight  (Ex): Gifted  with  a  mystical  connection  to

shadow and darkness, the shadowlord gains a superior form of

darkvision with a 60-foot range. He can see through any form

of normal or magical darkness without hindrance.

Shadow Jump (Su): A Telflammar shadowlord can travel be-

tween shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The

limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end

in an area with at least some shadow or darkness. The shad-

owlord can jump up to a total of 20 feet per class level per

day in this way. This amount can be

split  up  among  many  jumps,  but

each  jump,  no  matter  how  small,

counts  as  a  10-foot  increment.  If

the  Telflammar  shadowlord  al-

ready has shadow jump from an-

other  class  (because  he  did  not

meet the spellcasting prerequisite,

for example), this ability confers

no additional benefit.

Shadow Blur (Su): At 2nd level,

a  Telflammar  shadowlord  gains

an unusual defenseanytime he is

not in daylight or the illuminated

radius  of  a  light  source,  the  shad-

ows  cloak  his  every  movement,

conferring the benefits of a blur

spell. The shadowlord can choose

to activate or end this effect as a

free action.

Shadow  Walk (Sp): Once  per

day  starting  at  3rd  level,  a  Tel-

flammar  shadowlord  may  use

shadow walk as a caster whose level

is  equal  to  his  shadowlord  class

level. If he previously possessed the

ability to use shadow walk as a spell-

like ability, he gains a second daily use

of that power.

Telflammor Shadowlord

Shadow Pounce (Ex): At 4th level, a Telflammar shadow-

lord learns how to attack swiftly from the shadows. Any time

he uses an ability, spell, or effect with the teleportation de-

scriptor (for example, his shadow jump ability), he may exe-

cute a full attack upon completion of the teleportation. The

shadowlord  must  have  line  of  sight  on  his  intended  target

from his original location, and the spot to which he teleports

must be a place from which he can launch a melee attack at

the intended target with whatever weapon he has in hand at

the beginning of his action.

Shadow Discorporation (Su): At 5th level, a Telflammar

shadowlord learns how to use his mastery of shadows to cheat

death. If the shadowlord is in shadow or darkness (anything

but direct daylight or the illuminated radius of a light source),

any damage that would reduce him to 0 hit points or below in-

stead has a chance to discorporate him. The shadowlord attempts

a Reflex save (DC 5 + damage dealt); if successful, he simply

breaks apart into dozens of flitting shadows and vanishes, along

with  anything  he  is  holding  or  carrying.  At  the  next

sunset, the shadowlord reappears at a spot of his choos-

ing within one mile of the place where he was forced to

discorporate. While discorporated, the shadowlord simply

does not existhe can do nothing, nor can any of his en-

emies do anything to him.

Death Attack (Ex): At 6th level, a Tel-

flammar shadowlord gains the ability to

make a death attack as the assassin abil-

ity. If the shadowlord has levels in the as-

sassin  prestige  class  (see  Chapter  2:

Characters

in  the  D U N G E O N

MASTERs Guide), he may add his as-

sassin  and  Telflammar  shadowlord

class levels together to calculate the

save DC of his death attack.

Thayan Slaver

Thayan  slavers  are  cruel  marauders  who  use  their  awful

abilities to abduct creatures and then break their wills. They

are experts at creating docile slaves who obey their masters

without question.

Most Thayan slavers start out as rogues, but they can come

from any class other than paladin. Evil sorcerers and wizards

sometimes become Thayan slavers to more easily handle as-

sistants and even subjects for their wicked experiments. Some

evil fighters and barbarians find the prestige class is a natural

37

PRESTIGE CLASSES

extension of their aggression, as well as expanding their treas-

ure options to include other people. Bards and rangers are less

likely to take up such a prestige class, and there are few druids

who would consider it.

Thayan slavers can be found throughout Faern, wherever

slaves are traded. Sometimes they work or travel incognito, es-

pecially in places in which slavery is outlawed. Of course, Thay

is filled with all sorts of Thayan slavers, many of whom work

together in the great slave markets of Bezantur, Tyraturos,

and Eltabbar.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Thayan slaver, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Race: Human.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Appraise 10 ranks, Intimidate 10 ranks, Use Rope

5 ranks.

Special: Sneak attack damage +2d6.

Special: The character must qualify to select regional feats

from  Thay  (Thay  is  his  home  region,  or  he  has  2  ranks  in

Knowledge [localThay]).

CLASS SKILLS

The Thayan slavers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Appraise  (Int),  Bluff  (Cha),  Concentration  (Con),

Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Forgery (Int), Heal (Wis), Hide

(Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (slaver) (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis),

Spot (Wis), and Use Rope (Dex). See Chapter 4: Skills in the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  Thayan  slaver

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Thayan slavers are profi-

cient  with  all  simple  weapons,  with  light  armor,  and  with

shields.  They  are  also  proficient  with  the  sap,  spiked  chain,

whip, and net.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each Thayan slaver level,

the  character  gains  the  ability  to  cast  a  small  number  of

arcane spells. He gains arcane spells per day according to Table

213. He must choose his spells from the Thayan slaver spell

list,  below.  The  slavers  caster  level  is  equal  to  his  Thayan

slaver level. To cast a spell, the slaver must have an Intelli-

gence score of at least 10 + the spells level. Thayan slaver

bonus  spells  are  based  on  Intelligence,  and  saving  throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the slavers

Intelligence modifier. When the slaver gets 0 spells of a given

level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the slaver gets only

bonus  spells.  The  slaver  prepares  and  casts  spells  just  as  a

wizard does.

Ruthless Beating: A Thayan slaver is an expert at dealing

out nonlethal punishment. He takes no penalty for choosing

to  deal  subdual  damage  instead  of  normal  damage  with  a

melee weapon. A slaver may also use a melee weapon to deal

subdual damage in a sneak attack, although he attacks with a

2 penalty in this case.

Enervating  Attack:  As  the  assassin  death  attack  ability,

except that Thayan slavers have only the option of paralyz-

ing their victims. If a Thayan slaver has levels in the assas-

sin prestige class (see Chapter 2: Characters in the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide), he may add his assassin and Thayan slaver

class levels together for purposes of calculating the DC of his

enervating attack. Slaver class levels do not add to the DC of

the assassins death attack.

Break Will (Ex): At 2nd level, the Thayan slaver gains the

ability to break a targets will. Any time the Thayan slaver

wins an Intimidation check by 10 or more, the opponent takes

1 point of temporary Wisdom damage. Such lost Wisdom re-

turns at the rate of 1 point per day of rest, but most Thayan

slavers dont give their slaves a chance to recover.

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, a Thayan

slaver  deals  additional  sneak  attack  damage  as  the  rogue

ability. If the Thayan slaver gets a sneak attack bonus from

another  source  (such  as  rogue  levels),  the  bonuses  to

damage stack.

Crippling  Strike  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  a  Thayan  slaver  can

sneak  attack  opponents  with  such  precision  that  his  blows

weaken and hamper them. When the slaver damages an op-

ponent with a sneak attack, that opponent also takes 1 point

of temporary Strength damage. Ability points lost in this way

return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each

damaged ability.

Stunning  Blow  (Ex):  Three  times  per  day,  an  8th-level

Thayan slaver may declare a stunning blow before any melee

attack. If the slaver hits, the victim must make a successful

Fortitude save (DC 10 + Thayan slaver class level + Thayan

slavers  Intelligence  modifier)  or  be  stunned  for  1  round

(until just before the slavers next action). A stunned char-

acter cant act and loses any Dexterity bonus to

Armor  Class.  Attackers  get  a  +2  bonus  on

attack rolls against a stunned opponent.

SAMPLE THAYAN SLAVER

Thayan Slaver

Reg Neroz is one of the most in-

famous of Thays slavers, tire-

lessly  canvassing  the

lands  of  the  Inner  Sea

for captives to sell in the

markets of Bezantur and El-

tabbar.  His  minions  engage  in  wholesale  slave  raids

that depopulate entire villages, descending on their unwary

prey in small fleets of pirate vessels or at the head of a ma-

rauding band of evil tribesfolk. Reg Neroz avoids becoming

personally embroiled in battles against crusading heroes, pre-

ferring to let his thugs cover his retreat while he slips away

and prepares a stealthy ambush for a later time.

Darkly handsome and surprisingly well-spoken and cultured,

Reg Neroz spends his wealth lavishly to surround himself with

fine things. Despite his impeccable tastes, he is nevertheless a

thoroughly  evil  man  who  justifies  his  foul  occupation  with

statements such as, If I dont sell slaves, someone else will,

and they will be far crueler than I am. He maintains resi-

dences and strongholds in many lands, all well guarded and

fitted with the luxuries he enjoys so much.

choosing to deal subdual damage with a melee weapon. He can

use a melee weapon to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack,

at a 2 attack penalty.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If Reg Neroz catches his opponent flat-

footed, he deals +6d6 damage.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): Reg  Neroz  retains  his  Dexterity

bonus to AC regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck

by an invisible attacker. He cannot be flanked (except by a

rogue of 18th level or higher).

Region Descriptions

Each of the regions is described in the following order.

Preferred Class: Each region possesses one or more preferred

classes. A preferred class is a character class that is especially

common in or representative of a particular land or race. A

character of one of these classes who selects the region as his

gence scores may choose one language from this list for every

point of their Intelligence bonus.

Regional  Feats: The  feats  specific  to  characters  of  the

region. Regional feats are usually exclusive to characters who

choose  a  preferred  class  in  a  particular  region.  However,  a

character with 2 ranks in Knowledge (local) pertaining to a

region qualifies to select regional feats from that region.

Bonus  Equipment:  A  character  who  chooses  a  class  pre-

ferred in his home region gains bonus equipment at 1st level,

in addition to any starting money he gains based on his choice

of class. He gains only one of the equipment packages listed

here. Items marked with an asterisk (*) are masterwork items.

REGIONS FOR CHARACTERS

ABOVE 1ST LEVEL

Characters from powerful races may be equivalent to 2nd-, 3rd-,

or 4th-level characters despite the fact that they have only 1

class level. When such a character chooses a region and meets

the  preferred  class  requirement,  he  gains  access  to  regional

feats, automatic and bonus languages, and bonus equipment just

like any other character. Generally, a beginning character of

higher than 1st level should be equipped as a character of his

40

As a crossroads of Faern, the lands of the Unap-

proachable  East  are  home  to  a  variety  of  spe-

cialized  combat  techniques,  secrets  of  magical

lore, and rare talents not found in other lands. Characters from

all over Faern journey to the crowded cities of Thesk or the

deep forests of Aglarond in search of hidden knowledge, hoping

to glean some new trick that will help them on their way.

Character Regions

Regions appropriate to the Unapproachable East include Agla-

rond, the Great Dale, Narfell, Rashemen, Thay, Thesk, and the

Hordelands. Characters from other parts of Faern journey to

the East, of course, but humans native to the area hail from one

of those lands. Nonhuman characters commonly found in the

East  include  gray  dwarves,  shield  dwarves,  wild  elves,  wood

elves, rock gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and lightfoot halflings.

A nonhuman character who chooses one of these racial regions

could easily be a native of the Unapproachable East.

This section introduces three new human regions: Altum-

bel, Shou Expatriate, and the Wizards Reach. New nonhuman

regions for the races introduced in this book are the star elf,

gnoll, taer, and volodni character regions, all described below.

REGIONS AND FEATS

effective  character  level  (ECL),  so  the  bonus  equipment  is

often less important to him than it is to a 1st-level character.

If the character has racial Hit Dice or levels before he adds

his first level of a character class, he can still choose a region.

This  provides  the  character  with  the  normal  benefits  of  a

region, but he can only choose a regional feat if his racial Hit

Dice or levels would permit him a new feat. For example, a taer

begins with 2 Hit Dice, and thus two levels of giant. He may

use  his  1st-level  giant  feat  or  his  3rd-level  character  feat

(achieved when he becomes a taer with one level in any char-

acter class) to choose regional feats, pro-

vided he chooses a class that is preferred

for his race and region.

and pirates at the westernmost tip of

the Aglarondan peninsula, the folk of

Altumbel  distrust  nonhumansespe-

New Feats

The feats described in this section are commonplace in the Un-

approachable East. If a feat lists a Region line, it is a re-

gional feat and cannot be selected unless a character meets the

requirements for choosing feats from that region.

The  new  feats  described  in  this  chapter  are  summarized

below. A feat with the Fighter descriptor can be chosen as

a bonus fighter feat.

Battle Jump [FIGHTER, GENERAL]

You know how to launch a devastating attack from above by

dropping onto your opponent.

Region: Taer.

Benefit: You can execute a charge by simply dropping from

a height of at least 5 feet above your opponent. For example, a

ledge 10 feet above the floor of a cavern would suffice for jump-

ing on a Medium-sized creature, while a ledge 15 feet high is re-

quired for a jumping on a Large creature. You cant jump from

more than 30 feet above your opponent, nor can you effectively

battle jump while under the influence of a fly or levitate spell

or effect, as you have to hurl yourself down on your foe.

If you hit, you can choose either to deal double damage with

a melee weapon or natural attack or to attempt a trip attack.

You are treated as one size category larger than normal if you

try to trip your opponent with the battle jump. After you attack,

you take falling damage as normal for the distance you jumped.

Explosive Spell

Transdimensional Spell 

You are entitled to a Jump check (DC 15) to take less damage,

as if you had fallen 10 feet less than you actually did. If you fail

this Jump check, you fall prone 5 feet from your opponent.

You can also use Battle Jump to begin a grapple attempt in-

stead of making a normal attack. If you do, you are treated

as one size category larger than normal for the first grapple

check following the battle jump.

Normal: Anybody can try to jump down on an enemy, but

it  is  not  considered  a  charge,  and  they  do  not  gain  double

damage or the size bonus for the ensuing attack.

Craft Contingent Spell

[ITEM CREATION]

You know how to create contingent spells, which are semi-

permanent  spells  that  can  be  worn  and  activate  under

certain conditions.

Prerequisites: Spellcaster level 11th+.

42

REGIONS AND FEATS

Benefit: You can make contingent any spell for which you

meet the prerequisites. Crafting a contingent spell takes one

day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a contingent

spell, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up

raw  materials  costing  half  its  base  price.  Some  contingent

spells incur extra costs in material components or XP as noted

in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those de-

rived from the contingent spells base price.

See Contingent Spells in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells for

more information.

Draw From the Land [GENERAL]

You can draw strength and sustenance from the land itself.

Prerequisites: Ethran.

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: Before resting, you may draw upon the power of

the land to revitalize your body and mind. This allows you to

recover 2 hit points per day of light activity, or 4 hit points

per level for each day of complete rest, and 2 ability score

points per day, or 4 ability score points for each day of com-

plete rest. This stacks with the benefits of long-term care pro-

vided by someone with the Heal skill (see Chapter 5: Skills in

the Players Handbook).

You may also use the energy of the land to fuel your bodys

need for food and water. This gives you a +10 bonus on Con-

stitution checks made to avoid subdual damage from hunger

and thirst (see Starvation and Thirst Dangers in Chapter 3:

Running the Game in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Finally, you may use the power of the land to refresh your

mind and body as a supplement to sleep. You require half as

much sleep as normal (although you still have to rest a full

8 hours to prepare spells or regain spell slots).

Outside of Rashemen, you must make a Concentration check

(DC 10 + 2 per 100 miles from the border of Rashemen) to ac-

tivate this ability. If you fail, you cannot retry for 1 day.

Ettercap Berserker

[FIGHTER, GENERAL]

The intense physical training required to join your lodge has

made you tougher.

Prerequisites: Ability to rage, membership in the Ettercap

berserker lodge (see Berserker Lodges in Chapter 10: Rashe-

men).

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against

poison.  When  raging,  you  gain  a  +6  bonus  to  Constitu-

tion. During a greater rage, you instead gain a +8 bonus to

Constitution.

Normal: A character in a rage gains a +4 bonus to Con-

stitution. A character in a greater rage gains a +6 bonus to

Constitution.

Explosive Spell [METAMAGIC]

You can cast spells that blast creatures off their feet.

Benefit: An explosive spell ejects any creature caught in its

area to the nearest edge of its effect and knocks the creature

prone if it fails its saving throw against the spell. For exam-

ple, an explosive fireball moves all creatures in its area who

fail their saves at least 20 feet from the center of the effect,

while an explosive lightning bolt moves targets 5 feet to either

side of the stroke.

Any creature moved in this manner takes an additional

1d6  points  of  damage  per  10  feet  moved.  This  movement

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If some obstacle in-

tervenes to prevent the blasted creature from moving to the

nearest edge of the effect, the creature stops at the obstacle

but takes 1d6 points of damage from striking the barrier (in

addition to any damage taken from being forcibly moved to

the barrier).

Explosive  Spell  can  only  be  applied  to  spells  that  allow

Reflex saves and affect some area (a cone, line, or burst). An

explosive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the

spells actual level.

Extended Rage [GENERAL]

Your rage lasts longer than it normally would.

Prerequisites: Ability to rage.

Benefit: Each  of  your  rages  lasts  an  additional  5  rounds

beyond its normal duration.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times, and the ad-

ditional rounds stack.

Fortify Spell [METAMAGIC]

You can cast spells that easily penetrate spell resistance.

Benefit:  A  fortified  spell  has  a  higher  caster  level  than

normal for the purpose of defeating a targets spell resistance.

For every level added to the spells actual level, you gain a +2

bonus on spell penetration checks with that spell. For exam-

ple, a 9th-level wizard who prepares a fortified lightning bolt

as a 5th-level spell rolls 1d20+13 for spell penetration with

that spell, not 1d20+9. Spells that do not permit spell resist-

ance are not affected.

A fortified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than

the spells actual level.

Great Stag Berserker

[FIGHTER, GENERAL]

Your fighting style employs aggressive charges in the manner

of your lodges totem animal.

Prerequisites: Ability to rage, membership in the Great Stag

berserker lodge (see Berserker Lodges in Chapter 10: Rashemen).

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: When using the charge action, you may gain a +4

bonus on your attack roll and take a 4 penalty to your AC

for 1 round.

Normal: A charging character normally has a +2 bonus on

attacks and a 2 penalty to AC for 1 round.

Ice Troll Berserker

[FIGHTER, GENERAL]

When raging, your skin becomes very thick and tough like the

ice trolls that plague parts of your homeland.

Prerequisites: Constitution 13, ability to rage, membership

in the Ice Troll berserker lodge (see Berserker Lodges in Chap-

ter 10: Rashemen).

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: When raging, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus

to  AC.  During  a  greater  rage  this  natural  armor  bonus  in-

creases to +4.

Improved Grapple

[FIGHTER, GENERAL]

You are skilled in martial arts that emphasize holds and throws.

Prerequisite: Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.

Benefit: You do not incur an attack of opportunity when

you make a touch attack to start a grapple. You also gain a +4

bonus on all grapple checks (regardless of whether you started

the grapple).

Normal: Characters without this feat incur an attack of op-

portunity when they make a touch attack to start a grapple.

Long Reach [FIGHTER, GENERAL]

You know how to use your great stature to reach an opponent

more than 5 feet away with a spearlike weapon.

Region: Gnoll, volodni.

Benefit: When you wield a spear or shortspear, you can use

the weapon to attack opponents 5 or 10 feet away. When you

wield  a  longspear,  you  can  attack  opponents  10  or  15  feet

away. You do not get the advantage of the extra reach except

on your action, so you threaten the area around you accord-

ing to the weapons normal characteristics.

Normal:  Characters  who  do  not  have  this  feat  can  only

attack foes 5 feet away with a spear or shortspear and 10 feet

away with a longspear.

Owlbear Berserker

[FIGHTER, GENERAL]

Your fighting style emulates the owlbear, the totem beast of

your berserker lodge.

Prerequisites: Strength 13, ability to rage, membership in

the Owlbear berserker lodge (see Berserker Lodges in Chapter

10: Rashemen).

Great Stag Berserker

44

REGIONS AND FEATS

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: When grappling, you can make an unarmed attack

to deal 1d6 points of normal damage with a successful grap-

ple check. You do not suffer the usual 4 penalty for dealing

normal damage.

Normal: Characters who do not have this feat can deal 1d3

points of subdual damage, or normal damage at a 4 penalty

on the grapple check.

Special: Characters with this feat may choose the Improved

Grapple feat even if they dont meet the other prerequisites

for Improved Grapple.

Rashemi Elemental

Summoning [GENERAL]

You may summon Rashemens native elementals in any situ-

ation where you could summon an air or earth elemental.

Prerequisites: Spellcaster level 5th.

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: When casting a spell that summons air or earth el-

ementals, you may choose to summon an orglash or thomil in-

stead.  (See  the  Orglash  and  Thomil  entries  in  Chapter  6:

Monsters of the East) For example, if you cast summon mon-

ster  V, which  can  summon  a  medium  elemental,  you  may

summon an orglash or thomil using a medium elemental as

the base creature. If you cast elemental swarm, you could opt

to  summon  orglashes  or  thomils  based  on  large,  huge,  and

greater  air  or  earth  elementals.  Altering  the  spell  in  this

manner does not change any other aspects of the spell. You

may use this ability outside of Rashemen.

Snow Tiger Berserker

[FIGHTER, GENERAL]

You have learned how to pounce on your foes, much like your

totem spirit.

Prerequisites: Dexterity 13, ability to rage, membership in

the Snow Tiger berserker lodge (see Berserker Lodges in Chap-

ter 10: Rashemen).

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit:  You  may  make  a  full  attack  as  part  of  a  charge

action, but only if you are armed with a light weapon. (If you

have light weapons in both hands, you may strike with both

under the normal rules for fighting with two weapons.)

Normal: Characters without this feat may make only one

attack as part of a charge action.

Transdimensional Spell

[METAMAGIC]

You can cast spells that affect targets lurking in coexistent

planes  and  extradimensional  spaces  whose  entrances  fall

within the area of effect.

Benefit:  A  transdimensional  spell  has  full,  normal  effect

upon incorporeal creatures, creatures on the Ethereal Plane

or Plane of Shadow, and creatures within an extradimensional

space  in  the  area  of  effect.  Such  creatures  include  ethereal

creatures, creatures that are blinking or shadow walking, man-

ifested ghosts, and creatures within the extradimensional space

of a rope trick or portable hole.

You must be able to perceive a creature to target it with a

spell, but you do not need to perceive a creature to catch it in

the area of a burst, cone, emanation, or spread.

A transdimensional spell uses up a spell slot one level higher

than the spells actual level.

Normal: Only force spells and effects can affect ethereal

creatures, and no Material Plane attack affects creatures on

the Plane of Shadow or in an enclosed extradimensional space.

There is a 50% chance that any spell other than a force effect

fails against an incorporeal creature.

Vremyonni Training [GENERAL]

You have had more than the typical amount of training with

the  vremyonni, the  Old  Ones  who  research  spells  and  craft

magic items for the Witches of Rashemen.

Prerequisites: Able to cast 1st-level spells.

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spell-

craft checks.

Wolf Berserker [FIGHTER, GENERAL]

You have studied the fighting style of the wolf and employ its

tactics in combat.

Prerequisite: Ability to rage, membership in the Wolf ber-

serker lodge (see Berserker Lodges in Chapter 10: Rashemen).

Region: Rashemen.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on trip attacks and on checks

to resist an opponents trip attacks.

Special: Characters with this feat may choose the Improved

Trip feat even if they dont meet the other prerequisites for

Improved Trip.

Woodwise [GENERAL]

You are trained in fighting in woodlands and know how to use

the terrain to best advantage.

Region: Star elf, volodni.

Benefit:  You  ignore  hampered  movement  penalties  from

naturally occurring moderate or heavy undergrowth. (You are

still hampered by magically enhanced brush and plants.) When

fighting in wooded areas, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC.

Normal: A character without this feat is reduced to three-

quarters  normal  speed  in  moderate  underbrush  and  half

normal  speed  in  heavy  underbrush,  and  gains  no  defensive

bonus for fighting in woodlands.

45

The  Unapproachable  East  is  known  throughout

Faern as a land of strange, powerful magic. Sto-

ries abound of the awesome arcane strength of the

Red Wizards, the terrible majesty of the Simbul, and the fierce

pride and sensual allure of the Witches of Rashemen. Clerics

and wizards of other lands wield great power and influence, but

only in the East do spellcasters rule entire nations with such

unshakable strength and determination. Wizards enslave Thay;

druids govern the Great Dale; a sorcerer-queen rules over Agla-

rond, while female clerics and wizards choose the Iron Lord of

Rashemen and arrange the realms affairs to suit their wishes.

Secrets of the East

Secrets of magical lore lie hidden in every land of the Unap-

proachable East. The wizard-ruled land of Thay is notorious

for magical experimentation and cruel necromancy, while the

Witches  of  Rashemen  jealously  guard  their  secrets  behind

magical  masks  and  cultural  barriers  designed  to  baffle  any

enemy seeking to understand the sources of their powers.

Circle Magic

Several orders, sects, and secret societies practice cooperative

circle magic, but two of the foremost of these groups are located

in  the  Eastthe  Red  Wizards  of  Thay  and  the  Witches  of

Rashemen. By combining their magical strength, a handful of

spellcasters may accomplish together things undreamed of by

the most powerful of their fellows working alone.

Circle  magic  is  described  in  Chapter  2:  Magic  of  the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. Not every spellcaster

may join a circle; a Red Wizard must have the Tattoo Focus

feat to do so, while a Witch must have the Ethran feat. Sim-

ilarly, leading a circle requires a character to reach 5th level

in the Red Wizard prestige class or 4th level in the hathran

prestige  class.  Many  high-ranking  Red  Wizards  convene  a

circle of their apprentices each day to siphon magical power

from their minions and strengthen their own spells. Hathrans

are less likely to do this as a matter of course but do not hes-

itate to volunteer their most powerful spells for circles when

the situation calls for such a measure.

Contingent Spells

Contingent spells are single-use, one-spell magic items that do

not use a magic item space and do not have a physical form.

They remain inactive until triggered, similar to a spell cast

with a contingency spell. Once triggered, they immediately take

effect  upon  the  bearer  of  the  contingent  spell  (or  in  the

bearers square, if the spell affects an area). A character must

take the Craft Contingent Spell feat (see Chapter 3: Regions

and Feats) to create contingent spells.

Triggers  for  contingent  spells  are  usually  things  that

happen to the bearer of the spell. Possible triggers include be-

coming helpless, blind, or deaf; death; disease; exposure to a

breath  weapon  or  to  energy;  falling;  poison;  proximity  to

danger (such as fire, water, and so on); sleep; and gaining neg-

ative levels.

The market price of a contingent spell is spell level  caster

level  100 gp. A contingent spell must be crafted in the pres-

ence of the person to bear it, and the bearer is treated as a par-

ticipant in the creation of the item (he cannot cast any other

spells while the contingent spell is being crafted, must be pres-

ent for 8 hours each day, and so on). Once assigned to a bearer,

a contingent spell cannot be transferred to another creature, al-

though it can be destroyed (see below). An unwilling recipient

46

MAGIC AND SPELLS

cannot be a bearer for a contingent spell. A contingent spell is

tied  to  the  bearers  body,  alive  or  dead,  and  stories  circulate

among adventuring parties about contingent spells remaining

quiet for hundreds of years on a slain bearer, only to suddenly

activate when the proper condition was triggered.

Contingent  spells  are  subject  to  dispel  magic and  similar

spells. If a contingent spell is affected by dispel magic (made

against the caster level of the contingent spells crafter), it is

destroyed rather than merely suppressed. Destroying a con-

tingent spell in this manner does not trigger the spell. Con-

tingent  spells  are  suppressed  by  an  antimagic  field or  dead

magic zones like any other magic item but are not destroyed

by them.

At any one time, a creature can bear a number of contin-

gent spells equal to its Hit Dice. Additional contingent spells

applied beyond this limit simply fail.

The process of creating contingent spells has been discovered

independently several times in the history of the world. Most

recently, it was unearthed by the Red Wizards, who bear death-

contingent area spells in hopes of destroying whoever manages

to kill them in a devastating blast. Many young Red Wizards

arrange to bear a contingent fireball just for this purpose.

Place Magic

Hathrans and durthans possess a special bond to the land of

Rashemen that lets them draw upon the power of the spirits

to  cast  spells  without  preparing  them.  When  a  hathran  or

durthan uses place magic, she can cast any arcane or divine

spell known to her. (Spells on her hathran or durthan spell list

can be cast as either arcane or divine spells, as she desires.) In

effect, she can use any spell on any of her spell lists when she

wishes, as long as she is within the borders of Rashemen.

A  place  magic  spell  uses  an  unassigned  spell  slot  of  the

appropriate type (arcane or divine) and level. If the caster does

not have an open spell slot, she may spontaneously lose a pre-

pared spell of the appropriate type and level to cast her place

magic  spell.  Using  place  magic  takes  longer  than  casting  a

spell normally; any spell that takes 1 standard action to cast

requires 1 full round to cast with place magic. Spells with cast-

ing times longer than 1 standard action simply add 1 round

to the casting time. For example, casting a summon monster

spell with place magic increases the casting time from 1 round

to 2 rounds.

The hathran or durthan may apply metamagic feats to her

place magic spells, but this also adds 1 full round to the cast-

ing time. For example, a hathran casting an empowered fire-

ball with place magic requires 2 rounds to cast the spell and

must use a 5th-level arcane spell slot to do so.

Rune Magic

Once the secret lore of dwarves and giants, magical runes are

now commonplace in the northern portions of the East, par-

ticularly in Narfell and Rashemen. The folk of these lands

learned  their  runes  from  the  giants  of  their  cold  country

centuries  ago,  when  they  were  rootless  barbarians  and

vagabonds with little in the way of their own lore.

Rune  magic  is  described  in  Chapter  2:  Magic  of  the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. Few Rashemi clerics

take  up  the  path  of  the  runecaster,  but  a  number  of  them

learn the Inscribe Rune feat, and the tradition is more com-

monplace among the Nars and the folk of the Great Dale and

Ashanath.  Runescarred  berserkers  (see  Chapter  2:  Prestige

Classes) are common in these lands, too, although these mystic

warriors  are  not  spellcasters  in  the  traditional  sense  of  the

word. Finally, monsters beset the East that use the power of

rune  magic  for  illmost  notably  the  frost  giants  of  the

Icerim Mountains, whose tribes include a number of power-

ful runecasters.

The Shadow Weave

Wielders  of  the  Shadow  Weave  are  scarce  in  the  Unap-

proachable East. Given the Red Wizards drive to experiment

and innovate, the relative lack of shadow adepts in the East

might seem unusual. The explanation is simple: Red Wizards

quickly turn on those of their order who have learned some-

thing  of  value.  Consequently,  those  Red  Wizards  who  have

adopted Shadow Weave magic find it advantageous to conceal

their special spellcasting talents, preferring to surprise rivals

with their newfound capabilities.

The  Witches  of  Rashemen  harbor  a  great  suspicion  of

Shadow Weave users, and in concert they have destroyed sev-

eral wizards who chose that dark path. The leading hathrans

believe the Shadow Weave is the blackest sort of poison and

have warned their sisters to maintain a vigilant watch for any

signs of its use within Rashemens borders.

New Spells

The following spells are common in the Unapproachable East.

Spells listed as Hth spells are part of the hathran spell list

set out in Chapter 1: Characters of the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting.

ABOLISH SHADOWS

Abjuration

Level: Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 30 feet

Area: 30-ft.-radius burst, centered on you

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

A burst of dark energy leaps forth from your body and dis-

rupts all shadows in the area of effect. This has two primary

effects: First, shadow creatures (including shadows, shades, and

47

MAGIC AND SPELLS

other monsters or beings of the shadow type) take 1d6 points

of damage per caster level, to a maximum of 10d6. Creatures

subject to this effect are entitled to a Fortitude saving throw

for half damage. Second, spells of the shadow subschool or the

darkness  descriptor  (including  shadow  conjurations  and

shadow  evocations)  may  be  dispelled.  Make  a  dispel  check

(1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against a DC of 11

+ the target spells caster level.

Material Component: A small piece of obsidian.

ANIMATE DREAD WARRIOR

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Sor/Wiz 6

Components: V, S, M, XP

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: One humanoid corpse

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You transform the corpse of a skilled warrior into an undead

monster under your command. The corpse in question must be

that of a humanoid with at least three levels or Hit Dice and

no more Hit Dice than your own, killed within the last tenday.

The  body  must  be  substantially  whole,  although  any  injury

short of dismemberment does not interfere with the spell.

Upon completion of the spell, the subject corpse reanimates

as a dread warrior under your command (see the Dread War-

rior entry in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East). The creature

serves loyally and obeys your orders to the best of its ability,

although  a  cleric  with  the  ability  to  command  undead  can

usurp  your  control  with  a  sufficiently  high  rebuke  undead

check. Upon the casters death, the dread warrior becomes a

free-willed undead creature.

Created  twenty  years  ago  by  the  zulkir  of  Necromancy,

Szass Tam, this spell is found only in the spellbooks of those

Red Wizards who served as his apprentices and the apprentices

of those apprentices. Szass Tam has been using this spell to

steadily create a vast army of dread warriors.

Material Component: A rusted fragment of a sword blade

broken in battle.

XP Cost: 250 XP per HD of the dread warrior created.

BALL LIGHTNING

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: One or more balls of lightning, up to 1/2 levels

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Reflex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create one or more 3-foot-diameter balls of lightning that

shed light as candles and move under your control. You can

deal a number of damage dice (d6) equal to half your caster

level (maximum 10d6), divided however you see fit, although

no one ball can deal less than 1d6 points of damage. For ex-

ample, a 9th-level caster could create one 4d6 lightning ball,

two 2d6 balls, four 1d6 balls, or a 2d6 ball and two 1d6 balls.

On the round in which you cast the spell, the lightning balls

appear where you wish in the spells range, and you may direct

their movements as a free action. On following rounds, you

must actively direct the lightning balls to move them; oth-

erwise, they stay at rest and damage any creature in the spaces

they occupy. Directing the movement of all existing lightning

balls is a move-equivalent action for you. A lightning ball has

a  fly  speed  of  100  feet  with  perfect  maneuverability.  If  a

lightning ball enters a space with a creature, it stops moving

for  the  round  and  deals  electricity  damage  equal  to  the  as-

signed number of dice. The target of a lightning ball can halve

this damage with a successful Reflex save. A ball winks out if

it exceeds the spells range.

Note: This  spell  first  appeared  in Magic of Faern. This

version supersedes the one originally printed there.

Material Component: A handful of copper and iron pellets.

BELTYNS BURNING BLOOD

Necromancy

Level: Nar demonbinder 4, Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You infuse a living creatures blood with a hot, corrosive mix-

ture, dealing 1d8 points of acid damage and 1d8 points of fire

damage per round. Each round, on its action, the subject may

attempt a Fortitude save to negate that rounds damage, but

a successful save in one round does not necessarily prevent

damage in future rounds. On any round in which the subject

fails its Fortitude save, the pain limits it to a single move-

equivalent action in that round.

Beltyns burning blood does not affect creatures of the con-

struct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead types.

Material  Component:  A  drop  of  blood  and  a  pinch  of

saltpeter.

BLADEBANE

Transmutation

Level: Clr 3, Pal 2, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

48

MAGIC AND SPELLS

Target: Weapon touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

You impart a deadly quality to a single bladed weapon (any

slashing  weapon)  for  a  short  time.  Bladebane  confers  the

bane ability on the weapon touched, against a creature type

(and subtype, if necessary) of your choice. The weapons en-

hancement  bonus  increases  by  +2  against  the  appropriate

creature type, and it deals +2d6 points of bonus damage to

those creatures.

Material Component: A drop of blood and ruby dust

worth 500 gp.

As polymorph self (see the spell entry in Chapter 11: Spells of

the Players Handbook), except as noted above and as follows.

You may take the form of any fiendish creature, demon, or

devil  that  can  be  summoned  by  summon  monster  IV. You

cannot assume multiple forms with each use of the spell, but

you  gain  all  the  creatures  extraordinary,  spell-like,  and  su-

pernatural abilities. Your type changes to outsider, and spells

and effects that harm or ward evil outsiders affect you. Spells

that would banish you to your home plane end this spell and

leave you staggered for 1 round per caster level but do not

send you to another plane.

Material Component: A bone from any fiendish crea-

ture, half-fiendish creature, demon, or devil.

DECASTAVE

Conjuration (Creation) [Force]

Level: Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Quarterstaff of

You conjure into existence a quarterstaff of force,

approximately 8 feet long and 2 inches in diameter. The

decastave lasts only so long as you keep it in hand; if you

give it to another character or drop it, it vanishes. (You

can cast other spells with somatic components by hold-

ing the staff in one hand.)

You  can  use  the  decastave in  combat  to  strike  with  a

melee touch attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage per

hit. Since the decastave is made of force, it affects in-

corporeal  and  ethereal  creatures  normally  (provided

you can see such creatures). The decastave possesses the

thundering weapon  ability  and  deals  1d8  points  of

bonus sonic damage on a critical hit. Subjects dealt a critical

hit  by  the  decastave  must  also  succeed  at  a  Fortitude  save

(DC 14) or be deafened permanently.

Material  Component:  A  slender  wand  of  duskwood  (this

material is described in Chapter 6: Magic Items of Magic

of Faern).

FIENDFORM

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Nar demonbinder 6, Sor/Wiz 6

Components: V, M

Duration: 1 minute/level

FORCE ORB

Evocation [Force]

Level: Nentyar hunter 4, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Targets: One or more creatures or ob-

jects, no two of which can be

more than 30 ft. apart

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

or Reflex half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

One or more globes of force about 3 inches across streak

from your palm at their targets. You must succeed at a

ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orbs deal a

total of 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum

10d6), divided any way you see fit, but a single orb must

deal at least 1d6 points of damage. You declare the divi-

sion of damage between targets before making your

attack rolls. A creature struck directly takes the orbs

damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage

by half.

If you miss, the orb explodes in a 10-foot burst, deal-

ing 2 points per die of damage assigned to that orb. A

Decastave

successful Reflex save reduces the burst damage by half.

GHORUS TOTHS MAGNETISM

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 6

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Targets: One metallic creature or object

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

49

MAGIC AND SPELLS

You  fire  a  brilliant  blue  ray  at  a  single  creature  or  object

within range. If your ranged touch attack succeeds, you charge

the  target  with  an  intensely  powerful  magical  magnetism

effect. You can only affect objects made of metal or creatures

wearing or carrying metal armor, weapons, or gear.

The magical magnetism generated by Ghorus Toths mag-

netism creates a zone of attraction with a radius of 30 feet

around the affected creature or object. Every metallic object

entering  the  zone  of  attraction  is  pulled  toward  the  target

creature or object by this attractive force, which has an ef-

fective Strength score of 10 + the casters level (maximum

25). Every round metal creatures or objects remain within the

zone of attraction, they must attempt an opposed Strength

check against the force. If an attracted creature wins this con-

test, it suffers no ill effects this round. If it fails, it is entan-

gled and drawn 10 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which

it failed the opposed Strength check closer to the creature or

object at the center of the zone.

Creatures carrying or holding metal objects may choose to

release them, in which case the items fly to the creature or

object at the center, or hold onto them, in which case they

are treated as metal creatures. Unattended metal objects of

50 pounds or less in the zone of attraction (including items

voluntarily  released,  as  well  as  metallic  projectiles  fired

through the zone) fly with great force and strike the target,

dealing 1d6 points of damage per 5 pounds of weight (maxi-

mum 10d6). Objects heavier than 50 pounds are dragged 10

feet closer each round.

Metal creatures or objects that reach the target of Ghorus

Toths  magnetism  become  stuck  fast  to  the  target.  (If  the

target  is  a  metal  or  metal-armored  creature,  it  is  instantly

stuck fast to itself by the spell.) Creatures stuck together this

way are considered to be grappled and must first escape the

grapple  by  defeating  the  attractive  force  in  an  opposed

Strength check before they can try to move away or take any

actions prohibited in a grapple. Similarly, an object stuck to

the target must be wrested away with a Strength check before

it can be used.

If a creature or object within the zone of attraction is more

than twice as heavy as the target of Ghorus Toths magnetism,

the target is dragged to it instead. This naturally moves the

zone of attraction, which may shift other creatures into or out

of the magnetisms range of influence.

Material Components: A small lodestone.

GREENFIRE

Evocation [Acid]

Level: Drd 3, Nentyar hunter 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: One 5-ft. cube/level (S)

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: Reflex half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  evoke  from  the  earth  an  upwelling  of  virulent  green

energy, burning any creature in the spells area for 2d6 points

of acid damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum 2d6

+10). Any creature in the affected area when the spell is cast

is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage; any creature that

enters the area of the spell while the greenfire is still present

gets no saving throw.

The  greenfire  does  not  harm  natural  vegetation,  ground

cover, or plant creatures, if you so desire.

ILYYKURS MANTLE

Abjuration

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

You  cloak  yourself  in  a  luminous  aura  that  protects  you

against hostile magic. The  aura has  two effects: You gain a

luck bonus of +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5) on saving

throws against spells and spell-like abilities, and you gain elec-

tricity resistance 10.

Material  Component:  An  uncut  diamond  worth  at  least

50 gp.

IMPROVED BLINK

Transmutation

Level: Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Like  the  3rd-level  arcane  spell  blink,  you  flicker  back  and

forth between the Material and Ethereal planes. However, you

are capable of controlling the timing of your blinks and there-

fore make better use of them. Blinking by means of this spell

has several effects:

Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and

the Blind-Fight feat doesnt help the attacker. If the attack is

capable of striking invisible or incorporeal creatures, the miss

chance is only 20%. An attacker who can both see and strike

ethereal creatures takes no penalty. You have no chance of in-

terfering with your own attacks.

Individually  targeted  spells  have  a  50%  chance  to  fail

against you while blinking, unless your attacker can target

invisible, ethereal creatures. You have no chance of interfer-

ing with your own spells. You take only half damage from

area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the

Ethereal Plane).

50

MAGIC AND SPELLS

While blinking, you strike as an invisible creature (+2 bonus

on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to

AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you are sub-

ject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane.

You  can  ready  an  action  to  blink away  from  a  specific

enemy  attack,  physical  or  magical.  If  you  do  so,  the  attack

misses automatically unless it can also affect ethereal targets.

You move at three-quarters speed, since movement on the

Ethereal Plane is at half speed and you spend about half your

time there and half your time material.

While  blinking, you  can  step  through  (but  not  see

through) solid objects. You do not risk materializing inside a

solid object unless you actually end your move inside one, in

which case you materialize and are shunted off to the near-

est open space. You take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet trav-

eled in this manner.

Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane,

you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact

with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact

with  material  ones  (their  attacks  have  a  50%  miss  chance

against you, and so on).

IMPROVED MAGE ARMOR

Conjuration (Creation) [Force]

Level: Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You create an invisible but tangible field of force around the

subject of the spell. This provides an armor bonus to AC of +3

+ 1 per 2 caster levels, to a maximum of +8 at 10th caster

level. Unlike mundane armor, improved mage armor entails no

armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed re-

duction. Since improved mage armor is made of force, incor-

poreal creatures cant bypass it the way they do normal armor.

Material Component: A tiny platinum shield worth at least

100 gp.

LOW-LIGHT VISION

Transmutation

Level: Asn 1, Hrp 1, Hth 1, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You give the target creature low-light vision, the ability to see

twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight,

and similar conditions of poor illumination. The target re-

tains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these

conditions.

Arcane Material Component: A small candle.

NYBOR'S GENTLE REMINDER

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sor/Wiz 1 (Red Wizard)

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is popular with Thayan slave overseers and those

wishing to make their servants work a little faster, but the Red

Wizards mainly employ it as a combat spell. The subject suf-

fers agonizing pain for the duration of the spell unless he suc-

ceeds on a Fortitude save. If the subject fails his saving throw,

he is dazed for 1 round, and takes a 2 penalty on all attacks,

saving throws, and checks while the spell lasts. Nybor's gentle

reminder distracts spellcasters, who must make Concentration

checks to cast spells while under its effect (see the Concen-

tration skill description in the Player's Handbook).

Focus: A slender wooden rod at least 1 foot long.

Note: This  spell  first  appeared  in  Magic of Faern. This

version supersedes the one originally printed there.

NYBOR'S STERN REPROOF

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sor/Wiz 7 (Red Wizard)

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  causes  stabbing  pains  even  greater  than  those  of

Nybor's gentle reminder. The target creature must succeed on

a Fortitude save or die instantly. If he survives, the subject is

dazed for 1d4 rounds unless he succeeds on a Will save. Re-

gardless of whether he succeeds on this second save, the sub-

ject  takes  a  2  penalty  on  all  attacks,  saving  throws,  and

checks  while  the  spell  lasts.  Nybor's  stern  reproof  distracts

spellcasters,  who  must  make  Concentration  checks  to  cast

spells  while  under  its  effects  (see  the  Concentration  skill

description in the Player's Handbook).

51

MAGIC AND SPELLS

Focus: A slender gold-chased adamantine rod 1 foot long,

worth at least 1,000 gp.

Note: This  spell  first  appeared  in  Magic of Faern. This

version supersedes the one originally printed there.

RECITATION

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Clr 4

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 60 ft.

Area: All allies and foes within a 60-ft.-radius burst centered

on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

By reciting a sacred passage or declaration, you invoke your

dietys blessings upon yourself and your allies while causing

confusion and weakness among your enemies. The spell af-

fects all allies and foes within the spells area at the moment

you  cast  it.  You  and  your  allies  gain  a  +2  luck  bonus  on

attack rolls and saving throws, or a +3 luck bonus of they

worship  the  same  patron  deity  as  you.  Enemies  take  a  2

penalty on attack rolls and saving throws. After casting the

spell, you are free to take further actions during the spells

duration as you see fit.

Divine Focus: In addition to your holy symbol, this spell re-

quires a sacred text as a divine focus.

SINSABURS BALEFUL BOLT

Necromancy

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 5 feet wide to medium range

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reflex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You conjure a black bolt of dark energy that begins at your

fingertips and crackles out to the maximum range. The bolt

deals  temporary  Constitution  damage  and  temporary

Strength damage to each creature within its area, each equal

to 1d3 points +1 per 4 caster levels (maximum 1d3+3). Lost

ability score points are recovered normally at the rate of 1

point per day.

Constitution loss also causes a reduction in hit points by

lowering  the  victims  Constitution  modifier.  (Creatures

cannot be reduced to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die by

Constitution loss.) This hit-point loss may be fatal to a crea-

ture already injured, even if the Constitution loss alone does

not kill it. Creatures without Strength scores or Constitution

scores are unaffected by this spell.

SNILLOCS SNOWBALL

Evocation [Cold]

Level: Sor/Wiz 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Orb of cold

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

An icy sphere of bitter cold appears in your hand, harming

neither  you  nor  your  equipment.  You  can  use  the  Snillocs

snowball to strike opponents with a melee touch attack, or you

can throw the orb as a ranged touch attack (maximum range

120 feet, no range penalty). Either use deals 1d6 points of cold

damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6+5). Right

after you hurl the icy sphere, another appears in your hand.

You may throw up to one Snillocs snowball per caster level

(maximum five orbs) before exhausting the spell.

Material Component: A small bit of ivory.

SOUL SCOUR

Necromancy

Level: Clr 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Effect: Living creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous (see text)

Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your  touch  corrupts  your  victims  very  soul,  damaging  his

mental  characteristics.  You  must  make  a  successful  melee

touch attack to deliver the spell. The spell deals 2d6 points of

temporary  Charisma  damage  and  1d6  points  of  temporary

Wisdom damage immediately, and another 1d6 points of tem-

porary  Charisma  damage  1  minute  later.  A  successful  Will

save negates each instance of damage.

Soul scour is not a poison and cannot be ameliorated or neu-

tralized by spells that halt poison damage.

Material  Component:  A  pinch  of  dust  from  the  bones  of

a lich.

SPHERE OF ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sor/Wiz 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

52

MAGIC AND SPELLS

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: 2-foot-radius sphere

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You conjure a featureless black sphere of nothingness that dis-

integrates almost anything it touches. It flies at up to 30 feet

per round and attacks the creature or object you indicate. You

must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike a creature with

the  sphere.  The  sphere  stops

moving for the round when you

make an attack on a creature or

object.  You  must  actively  direct

the  sphere  on  your  action  to

move it to a new target; this re-

quires  a  move-equivalent  action

on  your  part.  The  sphere  winks

out if it exceeds the spells range.

If  the  sphere  ends  its  move-

ment  in  a  square  occupied  by  a

creature  or  object,  the  target

must succeed at a Fortitude save

or  be  subject  to  a  disintegrate

effect. If successful, the creature

or  object  is  only  partially  af-

fected  and  takes  5d6  points  of

damage instead. If the sphere is

directed  to  strike  an  object  or

part  of  an  object,  it  disinte-

grates the 5-foot cube it occupies.

The  sphere  may  destroy  one

creature, object, or 5-foot cube of

matter per round, provided it is

directed to a suitable target.

SUPERIOR DARKVISION

Transmutation

Level: Rgr 4, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject gains the ability to see in total darkness, with no

limitation to the range of vision. Terrain, distance, and line

of sight are the only limitations to the subjects ability to see,

and  the  normal  Spot  check  penalties  apply  on  attempts  to

descry distant or small objects or creatures.

Darkvision  is  black  and  white  only  but  otherwise  like

normal sight. Superior darkvision does not grant the target

creature the ability to see in magical darkness.

Material Component: A chip of agate.

WATCHWARE

Abjuration

Level: Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Touch

Effect: Object touched

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You create a mystical con-

nection with a single inan-

imate  object.  When  that

object is damaged, moved,

or  touched  at  any  later

time,  you  are  instantly

aware  of  the  fact.  If  an-

other  creature  physically

touches the object, you also

receive a mental image of

the creature, which counts

as  firsthand  knowledge  of

the  creature  should  you

later choose to cast scrying

or  a  similar  spell  on  that

creature.  The  watchware

is activated when the item is disturbed for any reason, whether

someone touches it or pokes it with a pole, a cat walks on it,

or an earthquake knocks it over.

The  watchware  functions  only  once  and  is  then  dis-

charged. Since its components are expensive, most sorcerers

and wizards reserve watchware to protect valuable, out-of-the-

way items.

A watchware is a magical trap. A rogue can find a watch-

ware with a successful Search check (DC 25 + spell level, or

30  for  watchware)  and  disarm  it  with  a  successful  Disable

Device check (DC 25 + spell level, or 30 for watchware). You

can  designate  a  password  that  allows  another  creature  to

handle the object without sounding the mental alarm if you

so choose.

Material  Component:  A  sprinkling  of  rare  sands  and

powdered reagents worth at least 500 gp.

Sphere of Ultimate Destruction

Mag c

tems

The Red Wizards are renowned as Faerns most

skillful and prolific crafters of magic items, but

they are not the only spellcasters of the East who

create  magic  items.  In  Rashemen,  the  mysterious  Old

Onesthe male wizards of the landspecialize in the art of

item creation, working assiduously to provide the folk of their

harsh land with weapons to resist the perils of the north and

the  threat  of  Thay.  Along  the  Golden  Way,  strange  en-

chantments from distant Kara-Tur have found their way to

the bazaars and crowded shops of Thesk, while in the depths

of the Yuirwood, sorcerers under the patronage of the Simbul

and bards from the hidden realm of Sildyuir also craft items

for a variety of purposes.

Magic Items

In  addition  to  the  magic  items  presented  in  the  DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide and any other items in an ongoing FORGOT-

TEN REALMS campaign,  the  following  magic  items  can  be

found in the Unapproachable East or in the hands of people

or creatures from those regions.

Weapons

MAGIC WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITIES

A magic weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1

enhancement bonus.

Berserker: A  berserker  weapon  is  valuable  to  barbarians

and other creatures that can enter a rage. When the wielder

is raging, the weapons enhancement bonus increases by +2.

The  vremyonni of  Rashemen  craft  many  axes  and  swords

with this ability.

Caster  Level: 7th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, divine power or rage; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Diseased: Sometimes found in the hands of Talontar blight-

lords or minions of the most sinister Red Wizards, this foul

weapon immediately infects the creature struck with disease

no  incubation  time  is  required.  Any  living  creature  struck

must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 12) or contract filth

fever. This deals 1d3 points of temporary Dexterity damage

and 1d3 points of temporary Constitution damage, and the

subject continues to suffer from the effects of the disease until

he recovers on his own or is cured through magical means.

Multiple infections against the same target have no additional

effectthe subject either has filth fever or he doesnt.

Caster  Level:  7th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, contagion; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Dismisser: Created long ago by the warlords of Raumathar

to deal with the infernal legions of Narfell, a dismisser weapon

has a chance to blast an extraplanar creature back to its plane

of origin with every hit. Any creature subject to a dismissal

spell  (including  called  or  summoned  creatures,  celestial  or

fiendish creatures, outsiders, and some elementals) struck in

combat by this weapon must succeed at a Will save (DC 17)

or be dismissed as by the spell. The subject adds a modifier to

its saving throw equal to its Hit Dice  9. For example, a 6

HD succubus would save at a 3 penalty, while a 13 HD pit

fiend saves at a +4 bonus.

Caster  Level:  9th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, dismissal; Market Price: +3 bonus.

Steeped in powerful magic and the wreckage of ancient empires,

the East is the birthplace of many innovative incantations.

Valorous:  A  valorous  weapon  allows  its  wielder  to  make

powerful charge attacks. When used in a charge, the valorous

54

MAGIC ITEMS

weapon  deals  double  damage,  much  like  a  mounted  warrior

with  the  Spirited  Charge  feat.  More  than  one  doubling  of

damage increases the damage multiple by one per additional

doubling,  so  double-double  damage  is  triple  damage,  triple-

double damage is quadruple damage, and so on.

Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, righteous might; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Vampiric:  Any  living  opponent  struck  by  a  vampiric

weapon must make a Fortitude save (DC 16) or lose an addi-

tional  1d4  hit  points,  which  are  immediately  added  to  the

wielder's current hit point total.

Any hit points above the wielder's

maximum are treated as tempo-

rary  hit  points  (multiple  addi-

tions  of  temporary  hit  points

don't  stack)  and  disappear  after

1 hour.

SPECIFIC MAGIC

WEAPONS

The  following  weapons  usually

are constructed with exactly the

abilities described here.

Aglarondan Flight Lance: This

+2 shock lance is made especially

for  griffonriders.  Once  per  day,

the wielder may use feather fall

(caster  level  8th),  on  herself

only, as a free action.

Caster  Level:  8th;  Prerequi-

sites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  feather  fall,  call  light-

ning  or  lightning  bolt;  Market

Price: 21,510 gp; Cost to Create:

10,910 gp + 848 XP.

Ebon Lash: Created by and for Red Wizards, the ebon lash

is a +2 scourge that inflicts searing agony on its victims. Any

living  creature  struck  by  the  scourge  in  a  successful  melee

attack must make a Fortitude save (DC 11) or be dazed for 1

round and crippled by pain for 6 rounds, taking a 2 penalty

on all attack rolls, saving throws, and checks. Spellcasters suf-

fering  from  this  effect  are  distracted  and  must  make  Con-

centration checks to cast spells (see the Concentration skill in

the Player's Handbook). The pain effect is the same as that

caused by the spell Nybor's gentle reminder, as if cast by a 6th-

level sorcerer.

Caster  Level:  6th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  Nybor's  gentle  reminder;  Market  Price: 20,320  gp;

Cost to Create: 10,320 gp + 800 XP.

Flamelance: Crafted by Red Wizards for their favored war-

riors, the flamelance is a +1 flaming burst lance that may be

wielded as a longspear by a character on foot at no penalty.

On command, the flamelance can fire a jet of white-hot flame

as  Aganazzars  scorcher  cast  by  a  6th-level  sorcerer.  This

deals 3d8 points of damage (Reflex half DC 13) in a 5-foot-

wide path 40 feet long. The flamelance can produce fifty such

blasts before this power is exhausted, after which it is simply

a +1 flaming burst lance.

Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, Aganazzars scorcher, and flame blade, flame strike,

or fireball; Market Price: 39,910 gp; Cost to Create: 20,110

gp + 1,584 XP.

Spectral Dagger: Fashioned

from a bone of a creature that

died violently, this appears to

be just a dagger hilt made of

bone. When a creature grasps

the  hilt,  a  dagger  "blade"  of

light  appears.  (Treat  the

weapon as a dagger for profi-

ciency, feats, and so on.) The

blade winks out when the hilt

leaves the wielder's hand.

The spectral dagger has no

attack  bonus  and  deals  no

damage, but any target struck

is  affected  by  a  chill  touch

spell  (DC  11).  Striking  with

the  spectral  dagger is  consid-

ered a touch attack. Creatures

with multiple attacks may use

the  spectral  dagger in  a  full

attack  action  to  strike  more

than once per round just as if

they wielded a normal dagger.

Caster  Level:  5th;  Pre-

requisites: Craft Magic Arms

and  Armor,  chill  touch;

Market Price: 20,000 gp.

Thayan  Bombard:  The

Thayan bombard is a magical

cannon that can launch a vari-

ety of dangerous or noxious bombs. The effects depend on the

missile launched. Firing the weapon is a standard action, re-

quiring a ranged touch attack to strike the desired space. (The

touch AC of an empty square is 5.) The Thayan bombard has

a range increment of 150 feet, and like any projectile weapon,

can fire up to 10 range increments at the normal 2 penalty

per range increment. If the ranged touch attack misses, re-

solve the bombs effect as a grenadelike weapon (see Chapter

3: Running the Game in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Once  fired,  the  Thayan  bombard requires  three  separate

Profession (siege engineer) skill checks (DC 10) to clear, load

with a new bomb, and prepare for firing. A skilled crew of

four can fire the weapon every round with a little cooperation,

while a smaller or less proficient crew takes longer (although

a single skilled character can fire the bombard once every 4

rounds, provided he makes successful checks).

Flamelance

MAGIC ITEMS

Caster  Level:  9th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, telekinesis; Market Price: 22,500 gp; Weight: 500 lb.

Typical bombs are listed below. Most bombs are single-use

magic  items  that  can  be  triggered  only  through  being

launched from a Thayan bombard, although similar actions

such as being flung from a catapult or hurled by a giant might

also work. A bomb is a thick glass sphere about 1 foot in di-

ameter and weighing 20 pounds.

Cloudkill  Bomb: This  bomb  is  filled  with  a  bilious  green

liquid. When it hits, it creates a cloudkill spell triggered at and

centered on the point of impact. The cloudkill is stationary

and does not move away from the point of impact.

Caster  Level:  9th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

cloudkill; Market Price: 1,125 gp; Weight: 20 lb.

Death Bomb: Black and cold, this bomb is covered with

sinister blue runes. It creates a circle of death triggered at

and centered on its point of impact, slaying 11d4 Hit Dice

of creatures.

Caster  Level:  11th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

circle of death; Market Price: 1,650 gp; Weight: 20 lb.

Fireball Bomb: The  most  common  magical  bomb,  this  is

warm to the touch and glows a dull, angry red. It creates a

fireball  triggered  at  and centered  on  the  point  of  impact.

These bombs come in three sizes: a 3d6, 6d6, or 10d6 fireball.

Caster Level: 5th, 6th, or 10th, for 3d6, 6d6, or 10d6 fire-

ball, respectively; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fire-

ball; Market Price: 375 gp (3d6), 450 gp (6d6), or 750 gp

(10d6); Weight: 20 lb.

Snowball Swarm Bomb: This bomb is blue and frost-cov-

ered.  It  creates  a  Snillocs  snowball  swarm  that  deals  3d6

points of cold damage, triggered at and centered on the point

of impact.

Caster  Level: 5th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

Snillocs  snowball  swarm;  Market  Price:  250  gp;  Weight:

20 lb.

Stinking Cloud Bomb: Filled with a sickly yellow concoction,

this bomb creates a stinking cloud triggered at and centered on

the point of impact.

Caster  Level:  5th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

stinking cloud; Market Price: 375 gp; Weight: 20 lb.

Stone Shot: Not a magical bomb at all but a simple stone

shaped  to  fit  the  Thayan  bombard, a  stone  shot  deals  3d6

points of damage. The shot must be aimed at a creature, not

a  square,  and  it  is  resolved  through  a  ranged  attack  (not  a

ranged touch attack).

Market Price: 5 gp; Weight: 30 lb.

Yuir  Ghostblade: Made  by  the  star  elves  to  battle  the

extradimensional marauders threatening their home, this

+1 aberration bane ghost touch longsword also confers a +2

deflection bonus to the wielders Armor Class.

Caster  Level:  9th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  dimensional  anchor,  plane  shift,  shield  of  faith,

summon monster I; Market Price: 44,315 gp; Cost to Create:

22,315 gp + 1,760 XP.

Wondrous Items

The Thayans manufacture many standard wondrous items in

their secret workshops, but some of the more unusual items

found in the East appear below.

Breachstone: A smooth stone token carved with runes on

both sides, the breachstone need only be touched to a wall or

barrier to create a passwall as cast by a 10th-level sorcerer.

The breachstones tunnel is 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and up to

10 feet long. The tunnel remains in existence as long as the

breachstone remains in the passage, and it closes 1 round after

the breachstone is removed. As with passwall, the breachstone

can only create an opening in stone, wood, or plaster walls, not

through metal or magical walls. (A wall of stone is not mag-

ical after it has been created.) The breachstone operates five

times and then crumbles into dust.

Caster  Level:  9th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

passwall; Market Price: 10,000 gp; Weight: .

Circlet of the Wilderness: When placed on the head of a

ranger, this band of braided strands of wood grants the wearer

a number of spell-like abilities. Each function requires a dif-

ferent command word. At willcalm animals (DC 11), pass

without  trace,  speak  with  animals; 3/daysummon  natures

ally  I,  cure  light  wounds (DC  11);  1/daysummon  natures

ally II, cure serious wounds (DC 16). These abilities are as the

spells cast by a 7th-level druid.

The wearer of the circlet of the wilderness can also predict

all naturally occurring weather within fifty miles of his cur-

rent location for the next 24 hours, at will. He cannot predict

the use of weather-altering magic by someone else.

The  Simbul  sometimes  awards  these  wondrous  items  to

Aglarondan rangers who have proven their loyalty to her and

their country through some great act of heroism.

Caster  Level:  7th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

animal friendship, cure light wounds, cure serious wounds, pass

without  trace,  speak  with  animals,  summon  natures  ally  I,

summon natures ally II; Market Price: 50,000 gp. Weight .

Hathran Masks: The hathrans of Rashemen are known for

traveling and fighting wearing elaborate masks. Often these

masks are magical, and some of the more common types of

hathran  masks are  listed  here.  A  mask  counts  as  a  pair  of

lenses for limitations on wearing multiple magic items.

Mask of Disguise: In its normal form, this mask is usually

decorated with carved wavy lines and small, plain bird feath-

ers. It functions as a hat of disguise, although it changes only

the wearers face (the mask also adjusts to accommodate the

disguise, appearing as a circlet, comb, hat, or similar item worn

on the face or head).

Caster  Level: 2nd;  Prerequisites: Craft  Wondrous  Item,

change self; Market Price: 1,000 gp; Weight: .

Mask  of  Flame: This  mask  is  red  with  flames  drawn  in

black or orange. The wearer is protected by endure elements

(fire) and may invoke a burning hands spell (caster level 5, DC

11) once per day.

Mask of Mental Armor: This mask is painted with broad

lines  radiating  from  the  eyes,  each  of  which  ends  in  a  pro-

tective spiral. The wearer gains a +4 resistance bonus on all

saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, spell

resistance; Market Price: 4,000 gp; Weight: .

Mask of Language: This mask is covered with tiny letters

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, non-

detection, resistance; Market Price: 48,000 gp; Weight: 2 lb.

Shaporyls Mask: This very rare hathran mask is decorated

with tiny fancy stones and painted with elaborate patterns. Its

wearer can use charm person three times per day, confusion

once per day, and dominate person once per day. The mask can

also scintillate in a multicolored pattern for 1 round three

times per day, which works like a gaze attack with a range of

30  feet.  Creatures  that  succumb  to  the  gaze  attack  (Will

negates DC 14) are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds. The gaze attack

in many languages and with pictures of

strange  creatures.  A  mask  of  lan-

guage is  created  with  three  lan-

guages, and the wearer can speak,

understand, read, and write those

languages. The most common lan-

guages  used  are  Chondathan,

Shaaran, and Thayan Mulhorandi.

Caster  Level: 5th;  Prerequi-

sites: Craft  Wondrous  Item,

tongues;  Market  Price: 4,000  gp;

Weight: .

Mask of Nightseeing: These dark

gray  masks  are  usually  decorated

with owls feathers and stylized eye

markings around the eye holes. They

function  exactly  like  goggles  of

night, granting the wearer 60-foot

darkvision.

Caster  Level: 3rd;  Prerequi-

sites: Craft Wondrous Item, dark-

vision;  Market  Price: 8,000  gp;

Mask  of  Protection  and  Resis-

tance: These  powerful  masks  are

decorated with powerful abjurative

symbols  and  the  feathers  of  rare  birds.  Each  acts  as  a

combined ring of protection and a cloak of resistance, and nor-

mally the protective bonus of each of these powers is the same.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, re-

sistance, shield of faith, caster level must be three times that

Mask of True Seeing: These masks are white with red mark-

ings  under  the  eyes  and  on  the  forehead.  They  allow  the

wearer to view things with true seeing.

Caster  Level: 10th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Wondrous  Item,

Witchboat: One  of  these  row-

boat-sized  wooden  boats  can  hold

three  people.  They  move  through

the water effortlessly at a speed of

30 feet upstream or downstream and

are  guided  by  verbal  commands

from  a  person  who  knows  the  acti-

vation command word. A witchboat

can  even  be  ordered  to  return  to  a

previous location without a pilot or

passengers,  and  the  sight  of  such

empty  boats  is  common  in  Rashe-

men. Crafted by the Witches and Old

Ones, these boats do not work outside

the boundaries of Rashemen.

A  larger  variety  of  the  witchboat,

called a warboat, is made by applying

the same spells to a well-crafted felucca

(a  two-masted  Rashemi  sailing  vessel),

giving it a speed of 20 feet.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

freedom of movement, fly, permanency; Market Price: 20,000

gp (witchboat), 40,000 gp (warboat); Weight: .

Minor Artifacts

The treasuries of the Red Wizards conceal a number of arti-

facts dating back to the old empires of Imaskar, Raumathar,

and Narfell.

The Ironwood: This 6-foot-long staff is cast to resemble

rough-hewn wood, despite the fact it is composed entirely

of rusted iron. It possesses many baleful and dangerous abil-

ities. As its primary abilities, the Ironwood gives the user

the following spell powers, which she can use at will and at

no charge:

Fog cloud

Soften earth and stone

Spike stones (DC 16)

Stone shape

MAGIC ITEMS

Special Materials

In addition to the magic items described above, the priests and

mages of the East sometimes work in materials with innate

special properties.

Bluewood:  Volodni  craftsfolk  often  fashion  armor  and

weapons  from  the  wood  of  blueleaf  trees  grown  with  care,

sculpted with wood shape, and then magically treated to be as

hard as steel. A bluewood weapon has the same hardness and

characteristics as a normal metal armor or weapon of that

sort but weighs half as much. Bluewood armor and weapons

created in this fashion are considered masterwork items and

gain the appropriate bonuses.

Bluewood items have the following additional costs:

Light armor

Medium armor

Heavy armor

Shield

Weapon (1d4 or 1d6)

Weapon (any other)

+300 gp

+600 gp

+1,200 gp

+300 gp

+400 gp

+800 gp

The process of treating bluewood to harden it requires ten days

of  work  by  someone  knowledgeable  in  the  process.  This  is

either  a  volodni  with  10  ranks  in  Craft  (alchemy  or  wood-

working), or a nonvolodni with the same skills and 2 ranks in

Knowledge (localvolodni).

The following spell powers drain one charge each:

Control water

Move earth

Transmute mud to rock (DC 17)

Transmute rock to mud (DC 17)

Wall of stone

These powers drain 2 charges per use:

Create shambling mound (special)

Command plants (DC 16)

Earthquake (DC 22)

Iron body

Create  Shambling  Mound  (Sp):  The  Ironwood has  the

unique  extraordinary  power  to  create  a  shambling  mound

from any suitably sized mass of dead vegetation (roughly two

5-foot cubes of material). This power requires 10 minutes to

employ. The wielder of the Ironwood can use the staffs com-

mand plants power to attempt to control the new shambler,

if she so chooses.

The  Ironwood  is  recharged  by  destroying  another  magic

item through cancellation, an extraordinary power that works

much like a rod of cancellation. The wielder must succeed in

a melee touch attack to strike an item held by another char-

acter. The item gains a Will save (DC 19) to avoid destruction;

use the bearers Will save if it is better than the target items.

The Ironwood regains 1 charge for every +1 bonus value of the

item  in  question,  or  1  charge  per  full  10,000  gp  value  for

items without a numerical description, to a maximum of 5

charges per item destroyed. The Ironwood has a maximum ca-

pacity of 50 charges; if it absorbs more than 50 charges, it is

canceled and destroyed itself.

The Ironwood is intelligent and neutral evil. It has Intelli-

gence 17, Wisdom 19, and Charisma 14 and can communicate

by speech or telepathy. Its Ego is 26.

Caster Level: 20th; Weight: 12 lb.

Shazzelurt: A potent magic dagger in the possession of Lau-

zoril,  the  zulkir  of  enchantment,  Shazzelurt is  a  hateful

weapon  almost  two  thousand  years  old.  It  has  a  wavy  blade

with a hilt of iron curved into a flame motif. Shazzelurt is

a +3 keen dagger with Intelligence 15, Wisdom 9, and Charisma

14. It is neutral evil and possesses the following abilities:

Detect magic at will (primary ability)

Detect secret doors at will (primary ability)

Heal 1/day (extraordinary power)

Its  special  purpose  is  to  slay  bards  and  rogues.  Any  such

character struck by Shazzelurt must succeed a Fortitude save

(DC 16)  or  be  disintegrated  as  the  spell.  Shazzelurts  Ego

score is 16.

Caster Level: 20th; Weight: 2 lb.

The lands of the East are home to a unique collec-

tion  of  creatures  not  found  in  other  portions  of

Faern,  ranging  from  the  hags  of  Rashemen  to

the twisted magical creations of the Red Wizards. In addition,

hundreds of creatures commonly found elsewhere also plague

the Unapproachable East.

Some of the creatures presented in this chapter are suitable

for characters; such monsters have a level adjustment listed

in their statistics. Creatures without a level adjustment entry

are not recommended as characters (they are mindless undead,

for example, or have an effective character level above 20).

Tainted by the corruption seeping through the dark Rawlins-

wood,  a  blightspawned  creature  is  a  perversion  of  nature.

Sustained by the power of decay rotting their black hearts,

the  blightspawned  loathe  anything  clean  and  whole.  They

seek  to  spread  their  horrid  poison  throughout  the  wood-

lands of the East at the direction of the Rotting Man, their

malevolent creator.

At first, a blightspawned creatures appearance changes little.

As time wears on, though, the foul infection it carries begins

to destroy its body. Healthy wood and flesh blacken, becom-

ing damp and crumbly. Leaves and hair clot with oozing sores

and soon fall out. Sap and blood become oily and black, run-

ning from abscesses in the body. The eyesif the creature had

any to begin withsink in to become black pits, lit by an evil

green light. Finally, life deserts the tortured form altogether,

leaving behind nothing but a putrescent corpse sustained by

the black sorcery of the Rotting Mans blight.

COMBAT

The sample blightspawned presented here uses a treant as the

base creature.

Animate Trees (Sp): This blightspawned can animate trees

within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time.

It takes a full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. There-

after it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in

59

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the

treant who animated them is incapacitated or moves out of

range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak as cast by a

12th-level druid.

Blight  Touch  (Su): For  this  blightspawned,  the  Fortitude

save  DC  to  resist  the  blight  touch  is  19.  See  the  template

description, below, for more information.

Create Spawn (Su): An animal, beast, or plant infected by

this  blightspawneds  blight  touch  becomes  a  blightspawned

itself if its Charisma reaches 0 before its Constitution does.

Double  Damage  Against  Objects  (Ex):

This  blightspawned  or  an  animated

tree that makes a full attack against

an object or structure deals double

damage.

Trample  (Ex): As  a  standard

action,  this  blightspawned  or  ani-

mated  tree  can  trample  oppo-

nents at least one size category

smaller than itself. This attack deals

2d12+5  points  of  bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent can

attempt  either  an  attack  of  oppor-

tunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save

(DC 20) for half damage.

Fire Vulnerability (Ex): This blight-

spawned  takes  half  again  as  much

(+50%) damage as normal from fire,

regardless  of  whether  a  saving

throw is allowed, or if the save is a

success or failure.

Plant Traits (Ex): This blightspawned

is  immune  to  poison,  sleep,  paralysis,

stunning, and polymorphing. It is not

subject to critical hits or mind-affecting

effects. It also has low-light vision.

Undead  Transformation  (Su): Each

month of a blightspawned treants exis-

tence, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15 + 1 per pre-

vious  saving  throw  attempted)  or  die.  See  the  template

description, below, for more information.

Skills: This blightspawned receives skills as though it were

a  fey.  *It  has  a  +16  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks  made  in

forested areas.

The

Blightspawned Template

Blightspawned  is  a  template  that  can  be  added  to  any

animal, beast, or plant (referred to hereafter as the base crea-

ture). The creatures type changes to plant, if it is not al-

ready  a  plant.  It  uses  all  the  base  creatures  statistics  and

special abilities except as noted here.

Hit Dice: Change to d8.

Special  Attacks:  A  blightspawned  creature  retains  all  the

special attacks of the base creature, and also gains those spe-

cial attacks listed below.

Blight  Touch  (Su):  Supernatural  diseaseany  natural

attack, Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 blightspawneds HD +

blightspawneds  Constitution  modifier),  incubation  period

1d6 days; damage 1d4 temporary Constitution and 1d4 tem-

porary  Charisma.  Unlike  normal  diseases,  the  effects  of

blight touch continue until the victim reaches Constitution

0 (and dies), Charisma 0 (becoming a blightspawned creature,

if the victim qualifies; see Create Spawn, below), or receives

a remove disease spell or similar magic (see Dis-

ease  in  Chapter  3:  Running  the  Game  in  the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Create  Spawn  (Su):  An  animal  or  plant  in-

fected by a blightspawneds blight touch be-

comes  a  blightspawned  itself  if  its

Charisma  reaches  0  before  its  Constitu-

tion  does.  When  a  creature  infected  by

blight touch becomes a blightspawned, it

recovers all ability score points lost to the

progress of the disease.

Special  Qualities:  A  blightspawned  re-

tains all the base creatures special quali-

ties, and also gains those special qualities

listed below.

Plant Traits (Ex): A blightspawned

is  immune  to  poison,  sleep,  paralysis,

stunning,  and  polymorphing.  It  is  not

subject to critical hits or mind-affecting

effects.  A  blightspawned  creature  also

has low-light vision.

Undead  Transformation  (Su):  Each

month  a  creature  lives  as  a  blight-

spawned, it must succeed at a Forti-

tude  save  (DC  15  +  1  per  previous

saving  throw  attempted)  or  die.  A

Light Sensitivity (Ex): This blooded one takes a 1 penalty

CREATING A BLOODED ONE

To prepare the mixture for a single blooded one, an arcane

spellcaster must know the Brew Potion feat and expend one

day and rare material components worth 500 gpin addi-

tion to the fresh blood of at least two Medium-size or four

Small humanoids. The creature to be changed must be im-

mersed in the alchemical mixture for at least 24 hours and

is entitled to a Fortitude save (DC 16) to resist the change

if it is unwilling.

The blooding process can be applied only to a young

creature (any creature that has not yet reached the age

of adulthood for its race). The mixture is virulently

poisonous to adults, who must succeed at a

Fortitude  save  (DC  16)  upon  initial  ex-

posure to the bath or take 1d10 points of

temporary Constitution damage. Crea-

tures  failing  this  save  must  make  a

second save 1 minute later.

Over  the  centuries,  the  evil  mas-

terminds  of  the  Red  Wizards  have

continuously  pressed  their  finest  re-

searchers to breed for them a race of ul-

timate  warriors,  violent  but  intelligent

and  entirely  loyal  to  Thay.  Time  after

time, the wicked wizards failed, but even-

tually they stumbled onto an idea. Instead

of breeding a new race, theyd simply take

an existing race and put its young through a

process that would transform them into the kind

of creatures the Red Wizards sought. Thus, the blood

orcs were born.

The wizards perfected a procedure that involves

immersion in a pool of alchemically treated blooda crimson

baptism from which the infant emerges tougher than ever,

ready  to  become  one  of  the  finest  warriors  of  Thay.  This

process can be used on any humanoid, but the Red Wizards

prefer orcs, whose evil natures make them more useful for the

wizards ends.

A blooded one looks much like the base creature, but its skin

is dark and mottled with red, and its eyes are a deep yellow.

COMBAT

The sample blooded one uses a 1st-level orc warrior as the base

creature. Blood orcs fight with even more furious disregard for

themselves than typical orcs.

War Cry (Ex): Once per day, this blooded one can cause all

blooded  ones  (including  itself)  within  30  feet  to  gain  a  +1

morale bonus on all attack and damage rolls for 2d4 rounds.

This effect does not stack with other war cries.

Called forth to serve in undeath through foul

necromantic magic, dread warriors are undead

beings usually created from the corpses of skilled

warriors. They retain many of the martial skills and

talents they possessed in life but are compelled to serve

their creator with unquestioning obedience. Dread war-

riors are created by casting the animate dread warrior

spell (see Chapter 4: Magic and Spells).

A dread warrior appears more or less as it did in

life,  although  it  bears  the  ghastly  wounds  that

killed it, and its eyes glow with a feral yellow light. Its

skin tends to shrivel and darken, falling in on its sunken flesh

to give it a gaunt, withered appearance. It usually carries the

arms and armor it favored before its death and transforma-

tion. It speaks whatever languages it knew in life.

Dread warriors are not always reliable servants, as they

are  easily  confused  by  complicated  orders.  Orders  of

twelve words or less cause no problems, but there is a cu-

mulative  5%  chance  per  word  after  the  twelfth  that  the

dread warrior misinterprets the instructions. If the dread

warrior fails to understand its orders, treat the monster as

confused (see the confusion spell) and roll randomly to de-

termine what action it takes in response to the command

that triggered its confusion.

COMBAT

Dread warriors fight with the arms and armor they used

in  life. This example uses a 4th-level human warrior as the

base character.

Undead Traits: A dread warrior is immune to mind-affect-

ing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death ef-

fects,  necromantic  effects  (unless  they  specifically  affect

undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless

it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical hits, sub-

dual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death from mas-

sive  damage.  A  dread  warrior  cannot  be  raised,  but  may  be

resurrected. A dread warrior has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills:  Dread  warriors  gain  a  +4  racial

bonus on Climb, Jump, and Spot checks.

Hag

Rashemen, the North Country, and the Endless Wastes are

plagued  by  several  varieties  of  hag  unique  to  the  Unap-

proachable East. Like their kin, the annis and green hag, bheurs

and shrieking hags are hideously strong crones with hateful na-

tures  and  fell  magic  at  their  command.  The  hagspawn  are

62

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

their unlucky progeny, hulking brutes with all the malice and

strength of their monstrous mothers.

COMBAT

Bheur

Bheurs  are  hags  unique  to  Rashemen,  capable  of  bringing

winters chill to any place in the land. Hideous and wrinkled,

they love the taste of human flesh.

A bheur hag resembles a hideous old crone with blue-white

skin and white hair, dressed in a ragged shawl. Its hands are

flecked with dried blood, and it usually carries a gnarled gray

wooden staff. A bheur lives to bring misery and freezing death

to as many people as it can. Powerful and malevolent, bheurs

sometimes enlist the aid of orglashes to help them smite folk

with terrible cold. Some legends hold that there is only one

bheur, for no more than one has been seen at a time, but it is

likely  these  are  merely  solitary  individuals.  Every  year  the

hathrans battle a bheur as spring approaches, finally driving

the  creature  off  and  heralding  the  return  of  warmth,  but

every year the fight is enacted again.

Bheurs speak Auran, Giant, and Rashemi.

A bheur normally opens with cone of cold to evaluate op-

ponents  vulnerability.  Those  who  appear  wounded  from

this attack are likely to be the targets of it again, while those

who  appear  immune  to  cold  are  subjected  to  ice  storm or

melee attacks. Bheurs prefer to retreat from dangerous op-

ponents rather than fight to the death and often ambush en-

emies who have driven them away before, using their great

maneuverability to lure enemies into inescapable deadfalls

and snowdrifts.

Graystaff Focus (Sp): A bheurs wooden staff has no mag-

ical properties of its own but acts as a focus that allows the

bheur  to  use  the  following  spell-like  abilities:  at  willhold

person, solid fog; 3/daycone of cold, ice storm, and wall of ice.

These abilities are as the spells cast by a 10th-level sorcerer

(save DC 11 + spell level).

Without  her  graystaff  focus,  the  bheur  cannot  use  these

spell-like  abilities.  Creating  another  graystaff  takes  the

bheur one year (as if crafting a magic item, although inter-

rupting the process does not cause the item to be ruined).

Shrieking Hag

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

Maddening Feast (Su): A bheur dines on the bodies of the

creatures it slays. As a full-round action, it can totally devour

the flesh of a slain or helpless victim, leaving only the bones

and equipment. Any creature within 60 feet that views this

must make a Will save (DC 16). The save is Charisma-based.

Those that fail are either permanently blinded (75% chance)

or become confused for 2d6 days (25% chance). This is a mind-

affecting effect. Although they prefer the flesh of humans,

bheurs are willing to eat just about any humanoid creature,

livestock, or fish.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willchill metal, ray of frost, Snil-

locs  snowball  swarm  (FRCS);  1/tendaycontrol  weather.

These abilities are as the spells cast by a 10th-level sorcerer

(save DC 11 + spell level).

Acid and Electricity Vulnerability: Bheurs take half again

as much (+50%) damage as normal from acid and electricity,

regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save

is a success or failure.

Size Change (Su): A bheur can grow to Large size or return

to its normal size as a standard action. When in Large form,

the bheurs AC and attack bonus decrease by 1 due to size,

it gains +8 Strength, 2 Dexterity, and +4 Constitution, nat-

ural armor increases to +12, and its reach increases to 10 feet

(see  the  above  statistics  for  size  changes  effect  on  attacks,

skills, and abilities). However, its fly speed is reduced to 30 ft.

(average). The bheur can remain in its Large form for only

10 minutes per day.

Shrieking Hag

Shrieking hags are horrible, spiteful monsters that haunt des-

olate wastelands and barren plains, preying on unwary trav-

elers and spreading all sorts of mischief in their wake. They

delight in deceiving the strong and virtuous, seeking to spread

chaos and despair. When a potential victim resists its wiles, a

shrieking hag flies into a murderous rage. One angry hag can

scour an entire village in a matter of minutes with its for-

midable spell-like abilities and terrible, maddening shriek.

A shrieking hag resembles a tall, regal woman ravaged by

age. Its skin is yellow-brown in hue, tough and leathery, and

its hands are twisted into iron-hard talons. Its long, white hair

whips about in a bitterly cold wind that seems to follow the

hag wherever it goes. A shrieking hag usually wears thin, tat-

tered robes and may lean on a crooked staff that it has no real

need for.

COMBAT

flesh.  This  attack  automatically  deals  an  additional  2d4+10

points of damage.

Shriek (Su): Three times per day, the shrieking hag can give

voice to a terrible, maddening shriek. Any creature within 60

feet of the hag takes 2d6 points of damage and is also confused

for 2d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 19) negates

the confusion effect and reduces the damage by half. The save

is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willchange  self,  dancing  lights,

ghost sound, gust of wind, shocking grasp, wind wall; 3/day

charm person, control winds, improved invisibility, lightning

bolt, see invisibility, suggestion; 1/daycharm monster, great

shout  (FRCS), polymorph  self,  whirlwind;  1/tendaycontrol

weather. These abilities are as the spells cast by a 12th-level

sorcerer (save DC 12 + spell level).

Hagspawn

Through charm or coercion, hags of all sorts use human males

to propagate their wicked kind. Female children from such a

union grow into hags, but the male children become hagspawn,

brutish and ill-tempered creatures who inherit many of their

hideous  parents  worst  qualities.  Usually  abandoned  while

young, hagspawn frequently fall into lives of violence, murder,

and brigandage, using the physical strength and toughness of

their monstrous heritage to intimidate the smaller and weaker

folk around them.

Hagspawn resemble brutish humans at first glance. They

are tall and powerfully built, with long arms, big hands, and

a distinctive hunched posture. Their hair is long and lank, usu-

ally black in color, and their red eyes gleam with malice. Their

faces are heavy-featured and coarse, and their skin color hints

at  their  mothers  kindpallid  blue  for  the  sons  of  annises,

sickly green for a green hags spawn, and so on.

Most hagspawn become brigands, thugs, or mercenaries and

thus take the warrior class. The information presented in the

entries  above  represents  a  1st-level  hagspawn  warrior.  For

more  information,  see  the  Hagspawn  entry  in  Chapter  1:

Races of the East.

COMBAT

Gifted with unusual strength, tough hides, and an innate re-

sistance to magic, hagspawn naturally gravitate to physical

combat. They favor large, powerful weapons and are notori-

ously reckless with their own lives, counting on their superior

brawn and ferocity to see them through.

Shrieking hags prefer to deceive, entice, and charm travelers

into their lairs, using their spell-like abilities to split up par-

ties and draw away a single chosen victim. Should that fail,

they resort to a furious assault from the night sky, shrieking

and blasting their foes with wind. They reserve their physical

attacks for dealing with solitary victims.

Rend (Ex): A shrieking hag that hits a single target with

both  claws  latches  onto  the  opponents  body  and  tears  the

HAGSPAWN CHARACTERS

A hagspawns favored class is barbarian, but they also make

good fighters, rangers, and rogues. Given the circumstances

of  their  birth,  hagspawn  are  loners  by  nature,  and  few

become the leaders of anything at all. Hagspawn clerics usu-

ally worship evil, violent deities such as Bane or Talos.

65

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

Hagspawn have the following abilities and characteristics.

+2 Strength, +2 Constitution, 2 Charisma.

Medium-size.

Hagspawn land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Hagspawn can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Natural Armor: +2 natural armor bonus.

Spell resistance of 11 + character level.

Automatic Languages: Common, Giant. Bonus Languages:

By character region.

Level Adjustment: +2. A hagspawn has an effective char-

acter level (ECL) of 2 plus class levels, so a 1st-level hag-

spawn barbarian would have an ECL of 3. See the Powerful

Races sidebar.

Favored  Class:  Barbarian.  A  multiclassed  hagspawns  bar-

barian class does not count when determining whether he

suffers an XP penalty.

Animated by a particularly hateful brand of necromancy, juju

zombies  are  malicious,  murderous  creatures  enslaved  by  the

mighty spells that created them. Armed with powerful abilities,

juju zombies are far superior to the mindless, shambling corpses

that most adventurers think of when they hear the word zombie.

Juju zombie

A  juju  zombie  appears  to  be  an  ordinary  zombie  at  first

glance, although it is generally in better condition than most

of the walking dead. Its flesh has a grayish cast, and its skin

is leathery and hard. A hateful light burns in its sunken eyes

the juju zombie comprehends its condition and loathes the foul

magic that sustains it. A juju zombie free to do as it wishes is

a bloodthirsty thing, driven to destroy the living and bring

woe wherever it wanders.

A juju zombie can be created with a create undead spell cast

by  a  16th-level  spellcaster  or  by  certain  powerful  magical

curses or diseases, such as the blightspawneds blight touch (see

the Blightspawned entry above).

Juju zombies understand all languages they knew in life, but

they are incapable of speech.

Combat

The sample juju zombie uses a bugbear as the base creature.

Juju  zombies  fight  with  whatever  arms  they  are  given  and

their own tremendous strength.

Undead Traits: A juju zombie is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects (unless they specifically affect undead),

and  any  effect  that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also

works  on  objects.  It  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  subdual

damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death from massive

rected. A juju zombie has darkvision (60-foot range).

assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and does-

nt already have these feats.

Immunities (Ex): Juju zombies are immune to magic mis-

siles and electricity damage.

Scent (Ex): This juju zombie can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

The Juju Zombie Template

Juju zombie is a template that can be added to any formerly

living corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of at least

1 (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creatures

type changes to undead. It uses all the base creatures sta-

tistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

Speed: In addition to its land speed, a juju zombie gains a

climb speed equal to one-half its base speed if it does not have

a climb speed already.

AC: Natural armor improves by +3.

Attacks and Damage: A juju zombie retains all the attacks

of the base creature and also gains a slam attack if it doesnt

already have one. If the base creature does not already have

a slam attack, use the values listed in the table below. A base

creature with natural attacks retains its old damage rating or

uses the values below, whichever is better.

Special Qualities: A juju zombie retains all the base crea-

Damage Reduction (Su): The fell sorcery animating a juju

zombie makes it difficult to destroy and gives it damage re-

duction  5/slashing.  Piercing  and  bludgeoning  weapons  have

little effect on its tough hide.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A juju zombie has turn resistance +4.

Immunities (Ex): A juju zombie is immune to magic mis-

siles and electricity damage.

Abilities: Adjust from base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex

+2, Int 4 (minimum 1), Cha +2. As undead creatures, juju

zombies have no Constitution score.

Skills: Since juju zombies possess a natural climb speed, they

receive a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks and can always

choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened.

Feats: Same as the base creature, except that a juju zombie

gains Improved Initiative, Power Attack, and Toughness,

Advancement: By character class

Nilshais are a race of bizarre and malevolent alien sorcerers

who hail from the same strange plane that birthed the ethe-

real filchers and ethereal marauders.

Like  their  lesser  kindred,  nilshais  spend  much  of  their

time  on  the  Ethereal  Plane  but  sometimes  mount  expedi-

tions  onto  the  Material  Plane  to  plunder  magic  and  lore.

They can move quickly back and forth between the Ethereal

and Material Planes and are potent spellcasters to boot. They

have a particular hatred for Sildyuir; although the Ethereal

Plane is not coterminous with the domain of the star elves,

the nilshais have bored a number of portals through the di-

mensions to reach itportals that now threaten the realms

very existence.

A nilshai is a horrid-looking creature with three clawed

legs,  a  ropy  body,  and  three  long  whiplike  tentacles  that

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

divide at the end into stubby, strong fingers. Its head is a

bulbous case atop its trunk, crowned by three stalked eyes.

Its three membranous wings fold tightly against its torso

when not in use. Its hide is a slick, mottled blue and black

color, soft and slimy to the touch, but its flesh is iron-hard

beneath its skin.

Star elves sometimes refer to nilshais as ethereal theurges.

Combat

A  nilshai  is  a  stranger  to  the  Material

Plane and is almost always on a mission

when  encountered.  It  may  be  in

search  of  a  magic  item,

spying on local residents,

or  looking  for  intelli-

gent humanoid slaves to

carry off to its alien home. Whatever its

purpose, it brooks no interference from

denizens of the Material Plane. It uses

its spells profligately, fig-

uring  that  any  threat

deserves  the  quickest

possible  death.  A  com-

mon tactic against magic-

using foes is to cast a spell

and  then  ready  a  dispel

magic to  counterspell  in

the same round.

Spells:  A  nilshai  casts

spells as an 8th-level sorcerer. The save DC for

its spells is 13 + spell level. A typical nilshai spell

list follows (spells per day 6/7/7/6/3): 0daze,

detect magic, disrupt undead, light, mage hand,

ray  of  frost,  read  magic,  resistance;  1stcolor  spray,  mage

armor,  magic  missile,  silent  image,  true  strike;  2ndmirror

image, resist elements, Snillocs snowball swarm (FRCS); 3rd

dispel magic, lightning bolt; 4thenervation.

Ethereal Jaunt (Su): A nilshai can shift from the Ethereal

to the Material Plane as a free action and shift back again as

a  move-equivalent  action  (or  as  part  of  a  move-equivalent

action). The ability is otherwise identical with ethereal jaunt

cast by a 15th-level sorcerer.

Fearsome Celerity (Ex): The nilshais trilateral symmetry

and alien mind allow it to divide its attention among multi-

ple tasks at the same time. A nilshai gains an extra partial

action  each  round,  during  which  it  typically  casts  a  second

spell or activates a magic item after it moves and attacks or

casts a spell.

Mind Blank (Su): Nilshais are magically resistant to spells

and effects of detection and mental influence. They are pro-

tected by a mind blank effect at all times.

Skills: Due to their ability to multitask and their trilateral

symmetry, nilshais receive a +4 racial bonus on Listen, Spot,

and Use Magic Device checks.

Nilshai Society

Few on the Material Plane or in Sildyuir know much about

how the nilshais organize themselves or what they do in their

own alien world. Their cities are bizarre strongholds of ethereal

stone shaped into maddeningly complex chambers and twisting

passages. As many as five hundred nilshais live in a large strong-

hold, but most are smaller communities of fifty or so individ-

uals. The most powerful sorcerer of a stronghold is its absolute

master and commands the implicit obedience of all others.

Nilshais associate with creatures from their own alien ecology.

Ethereal marauders (their pets) and ethereal filchers (their

servants) often populate

nilshai  strongholds.

(Nilshai  strong-

holds are also home to

ethereal  slayers,  found

in  Monster  Manual

II.)  The  nilshais  em-

ploy  even  stranger  crea-

tures as guards and raiders

from time to time.

Nilshai

Characters

Nilshais  favored  class  is  sorcerer.

Levels of sorcerer add to a nilshais

ability to cast spells as an 8th-level sor-

cerer,  so  a  5th-level  sorcerer  nilshai

casts spells as a 13th-level sorcerer.

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

Level Adjustment: +5

Treasure: None

Alignment: Usually chaotic neutral

Advancement: 57 HD (Medium-Size)

An orglash, or ice spirit, is a kind of air elemental native to the

colder parts of Rashemen. Alien and unpredictable, they are

viewed as a mixed blessing by the Rashemi people, for despite

their  occasional  danger  to  travelers,  they

have helped defend the land against the

Red Wizards for hundreds of years.

An orglash looks like an air elemen-

tal with wisps of snow spinning about

and  two  barely  visible,  darker  spots

that  look  like  eyes.  Orglashes  roam

the frozen mountains and forests of

Rashemen,  attacking  creatures  that

threaten  the  land.  Their  perspective

of what is threatening is very broad,

however,  and  they  have  been  known

to attack small parties in remote areas.

Orglashes speak Auran.

COMBAT

The sample orglash uses a medium air

elemental as the base creature.

Air  Mastery  (Ex):  Any  airborne

creature  takes  a  1  penalty  on

attack and damage rolls made against

an orglash.

Cone  of  Cold (Sp): 3/day  as  a  4th-level

sorcerer.

Cold Fast Healing (Ex): As long as it has at least

1 hit point, in extremely cold or cold weather conditions,

an  orglash  recovers  lost  hit  points  at  the  rate  of  3  per

round. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from

starvation,  thirst,  or  suffocation,  and  it  does  not  allow  the

orglash to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Cold Subtype (Ex): An orglash is immune to cold damage.

Orglashes take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal

from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or

if the save is a success or failure.

Elemental  Traits  (Ex): An  orglash  is  immune  to  poison,

sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to critical hits

or flanking. The creature also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Whirlwind  (Su):  This  orglash  can  transform  itself  into  a

whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for

up to 2 rounds. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up

to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 to 30 feet in height.

The orglashs movement while in whirlwind form does not

provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it enters the space an-

other creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in

the whirlwind if it touches or enters it, or if the orglash moves

into  or  through  the  creatures  space.  It  deals  1d6  points  of

damage to Small or smaller creatures and may sweep them

bodily up. The save DC to avoid the whirlwind is 13. This save

is Strength-based.

Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move away except

to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can

cast spells normally with a successful Concentration check (DC

10 + spell level). Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a 4

penalty to effective Dexterity and a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

An orglash in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks

and does not threaten the area around it.

The Orglash

Template

Orglash is a template that can be applied to

any elemental creature with the air subtype

(referred  to  hereafter  as  the  base  crea-

ture).  Most  orglashes  use  an  air  ele-

mental as the base creature, but secret

and undiscovered leaders could be based

on another elemental being, such as an

invisible stalker. It uses all of the base

creatures statistics and special abili-

ties except as noted here.

Speed: If the base creature cannot

fly, it gains a fly speed equal to its land

speed  (poor  maneuverability).  If  the

base creature can fly, use the base crea-

tures fly speed and maneuverability.

AC: Natural armor increases by +2.

Damage: An orglashs natural at-

tacks deal cold damage in addition to

the normal damage for the attack. This

cold  damage  is  half  the  number  of  dice  of

damage  the  natural  attack  deals,  not  including  the

Strength modifier. If the natural attack deals one die

of damage, reduce the die type by two steps. For example,

if the base creature deals 2d8 points of damage with a slam

attack, add 1d8 points of cold damage. If the base creature deals

1d6 points of damage, add 1d3 points of cold damage.

Special Attacks: An orglash retains all the special attacks of

the base creature, and also gains the following special attack.

Cone of Cold (Sp): 3/day as a sorcerer with a caster level

equal to its Hit Dice.

Special Qualities: An orglash retains all the base creatures spe-

cial qualities, and also gains those special qualities listed below.

Cold Subtype (Ex): An orglash is immune to cold damage.

Orglashes take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal

from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or

if the save is a success or failure.

Fast Healing (Ex): In extremely cold or cold weather con-

ditions, an orglash recovers lost hit points at the rate of 3

per round.

Native  Elemental: Orglashes  are  native  to  the  Material

Plane. Spells that banish outsiders or elementals to their home

plane do not work on orglashes. Spells that send outsiders or

elementals to another plane (rather than to their home plane)

69

Orglash

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

work normally. Orglashes can be raised or resurrected, although

their remains quickly vanish if killed, making it difficult to

use these spells to restore them to life.

Saves: Orglashes receive a +2 morale bonus on all saving

throws against spells from creatures they recognize to be

Red Wizards.

Abilities: Adjust from the base creature as follows: Con +4,

Int at least 10.

Climate/Terrain: Cold forest and plains.

Organization: Solitary.

Shadow-walkers  are  people  who  have  experienced  a  magical

ritual of the god Mask that attunes a persons body to shadow.

Similar to shades, they gain powers in shadow and darkness.

Jalaunther Ithbreeiur, high priest of the Maskarran

temple  in  Thesk,  discovered  a  rite  sacred  to  his

deity  called  the  Ritual  of  Shadow  Walking.

This  ritual  exchanges  some  of  the  recipi-

ents life force for shadowstuff. The re-

cipient  appears  exactly  the  same  as

before, although her shadow stands out

as crisp and dark even in overcast situ-

ations.  The  Shadowmasters  use  this

ritual to allow their agents to enter and

leave difficult spots with ease, and they

normally  work  in  pairs,  with  two

agents  transporting  together  to  the

site of the intended crime.

COMBAT

The  sample  shadow-walker  uses

Yastera  Blackhands  Menano,  a

female human 5th-level rogue and

member of the Shadowmasters of

Telflamm, as the base character.

Nicknamed Blackhands because

of  the  black  aura  that  manifests

around  her  hands  when  she  manipu-

lates shadows, Yastera is responsible for

several  key  kidnappings  in  Telflamm.

She has also been trained as a spy and

often  visits  official  functions  and

nobles  parties  to  learn  things  about

people the Shadowmasters are investigat-

ing. Yastera is very loyal to the guild, for

they have treated her well and respect her

ability. She has red hair and a slight build

and is quite pretty. She prefers to avoid situations where she

may get hurt, and if involved in a fight, she remains out of

melee for as long as possible. If threatened directly, she uses

her dimension door ability to escape.

Shadow-walker

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally allows

a Reflex save for half damage, this shadow-walker takes no

damage on a successful saving throw.

Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such

as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds this shadow-walker for

1 round. In addition, she takes a 1 penalty on all attack rolls,

saves, and checks when operating in bright light.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daydarkness, shadow mask (FRCS);

1/daydimension door (self only). These abilities are as the

spells cast by a 5th-level sorcerer.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): This  shadow-walker  retains  her

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed.

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

Spirit folk are the descendants of humans and various spirits of

nature found in and around the land of Rashemen. Spirit folk

have two distinct subraces: river and mountain. All have very

strong ties to the natural world as well as to human society.

Spirit folk look human, although their eyebrows are thin

and their complexions are very pale or golden. They have no

facial or body hair, but the hair on their heads is thick and lux-

urious. They appear in all the diversity of humans, particularly

the Rashemi race, and many come close to the ideal of human

beauty in their society.

Spirit folk speak Common and Fey.

Most  spirit  folk  encountered  outside  of  their  homes  are

warriors; the information above describes a 1st-level spirit

folk warrior.

Combat

Though spirit folk prefer peaceful solutions to violence, they

can fight courageously and skillfully when necessary. They use

a variety of weapons and prefer light armor.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): Spirit folk can see twice as far as

a  human  in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar

conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Spirit Folk Traits (Ex): Spirit folk have a number of racial

traits,  depending  on  their  type.  See  Spirit  Folk  Characters,

below.

Spirit Folk Characters

Any class can be a spirit folk characters favored class. A mul-

ticlassed  spirit  folks  highest-level  character  class  does  not

count when determining whether she suffers an XP penalty.

These abilities and characteristics are common to both

varieties of spirit folk.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Spirit folk can see twice as far as humans

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Automatic  Languages:  Common  and  Sylvan.  Bonus  Lan-

guages:  Aquan,  Auran,  Giant,  Goblin,  Mulan,  Rashemi,

Shou, Tuigan.

MOUNTAIN SPIRIT FOLK

In addition to the spirit folk traits described above, mountain

spirit folk have the following abilities and characteristics.

Mountain spirit folk have a base climb speed of 30 feet.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Balance,  Jump,  and  Tumble  checks.

Mountain spirit folk are at home on steep slopes and sheer

pinnacles that would terrify most humans. Since mountain

spirit folk possess a natural climb speed, they receive a +8

racial bonus on all Climb checks and can always choose to

take 10, even if rushed or threatened.

Once  per  day,  a  mountain  spirit  folk  can  use  speak  with

animals to speak with any bird. This ability has a duration

of 1 minute (the spirit folk is considered a 1st-level caster

when using this ability, regardless of actual level).

RIVER SPIRIT FOLK

In addition to the spirit folk traits described above, river spirit

folk have the following abilities and characteristics.

River spirit folk have a base swim speed of 30 feet. They do

not need to make Swim checks to swim normally. They gain

a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some spe-

cial action or avoid a hazard, and they can always choose to

take 10 on these checks, even if distracted or endangered

when swimming. They can use the run action while swim-

ming, provided they swim in a straight line.

Water  Breathing:  River  spirit  folk  can  breathe  water  as

easily as they breathe air.

+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like

effects with the word water in the name of the effect.

Once per day, a river spirit folk can use speak with animals

to  speak  with  any  fish.  This  ability  has  a  duration  of  1

minute (the spirit folk is considered a 1st-level caster when

using this ability, regardless of actual level).

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

Taers  are  violent  and  primitive  creatures  that  inhabit  the

coldest mountain ranges, dwelling in noisome caves and gla-

cial crevasses.

In  wintertime,  taers  range  far  from  their  mountain  re-

treats,  reaving  and  pillaging  all  in  their  path.  In  warm

weather,  they  remain  high  in  their  mountains,  harassing

anyone bold enough to attempt the high passes. They regard

most  other  creatures  as  simple  prey  but  possess  a  compre-

hensive system of myths, stories, and rules for conduct.

A taer is a powerfully built creature about 5 to

6 feet in height, with thickly muscled arms

and an apelike face. A taer carries itself in

a  crouch  and  its  knuckles  reach  the

ground; when a taer straightens up, it

stands almost 7 feet in height. Males

weigh about 220 pounds, females about

180 pounds. The creature is covered in

matted  white  fur  that  tends  to  blend

into its snowy environs.

Combat

Taers can attack barehanded and deal pun-

ishing  blows  through  sheer  strength  and

savagery, but most are armed with crude

spears or clubs. They often wear poorly

cured  hide  armor,  and  many  smear

themselves  with  taer  stench  grease,

described in the accompanying sidebar.

Cold  Subtype  (Ex):  Taers  are

immune to cold damage but are vul-

nerable to fire attacks. They take half

again  as  much  (+50%)  damage  as

normal from fire, regardless of whether

a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is

a success or failure.

all  Climb  checks  and  can  always  choose  to  take  10,  even  if

rushed or threatened. *Taers also receive a +4 racial bonus on

Hide checks in snowy conditions.

Taer Society

Taers are never far from flying into a blind rage. To keep

from destroying one another, they have developed a complex

society marked by rich myths, rules for governing behavior

and determining status, and methods for contesting issues

through  analogy  and  metaphor  rather  than  physical  vio-

lence. They view their existence as a living myth and con-

sider  dreams,  stories,  and  ideas  every  bit  as  real  and

important as their waking lives. The oldest male who shows

some degree of wisdom and an aptitude for leadership rules

the taer clan. This clan chief usually designates a strong and

ruthless war chief to lead hunts and raids.

Most taers are concerned with accumulating status and

respect within their clan, which in turn guarantees

the best food, sleeping places, and most

desirable  mates.  They  jealously

defend their own prerogatives while

challenging  those  above  them.

Taers rarely resort to physical at-

tacks  to  take  these  things  from

other  clan  members,  since  that

would  entail  a  loss  of  status.  Any

nontaer,  though,  is  fair  game  for

robbery, murder, and the cook pot.

Taers  are  curious  about  items  or

tools  from  more  civilized  races  and

are  likely  to  murder  a  woodcutter

simply to take a rusty old axe.

Taer Characters

Taers  favor  the  barbarian  class,  although

warriors and fighters are also common. Few

taers  become  arcane  spellcasters,  but  a

small number become adepts, clerics, or

druids. Taer clerics usually venerate Auril

and  choose  the  domains  of  Evil  and

Storm (FRCS).

From time to time, taers who fail in

a  bid  to  oust  the  current  chieftain  or

who  are  weak  by  the  standards  of  the  clan  are  driven

out. These exiles usually fall prey to other dangerous mon-

sters of the cold lands, but some wander down to the lands

of the soft ones, drawn by curiosity about more advanced

folk. Most become brigands or thugs, but a few fall in with

adventuring  bands  in  need  of  muscle  unconstrained  by

civilized morals.

Taers have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

Taer Stench Grease

Taers brew a foul-smelling substance derived from their own

scent, which they smear on their bodies before entering combat

to  sicken  and  disorient  foes.  An  application  of  taer  stench

grease is sufficient to coat one creature and lasts for 1 hour.

Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a Fortitude

save (DC 15) or be sickened, taking a 2 penalty on all attack

rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and abil-

ity  checks  for  1d6+4  minutes.  A  delay  poison  or  neutralize

poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature, and

taers and creatures immune to poison are unaffected.

+4 Strength, +2 Constitution, 4 Intelligence, 2 Charisma.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet, climb speed 30 feet.

provides 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base

saving throws of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.

Racial Skills: A taer characters giant levels give him skill

points equal to 5  (2 + Intelligence modifier). Taer class

skills are Climb, Hide, and Spot. A taers pelt blends in with

Telthors are spirit animals or people native to Rashemen, par-

ticularly those who died defending the land. Incorporeal and

ghostly, they are still formidable opponents.

Many places in Rashemen have guardian spirits, and

some trees, rocks, and rivers have them as well. These

spirits  are  the  telthors,  and  they  take  a  form

appropriate to what they are guarding. For

example,  a  mountain  may  have  a

telthor dire bear guardian, a forest

might have a telthor dire wolf

guardian, and a spring might

have  a  telthor  hawk

guardian. Large places or

very  important  sites

might  have  multiple

telthors,  each  respon-

sible for a part of the

site  but  working  to-

gether  against  a  foe

that  threatens  them  all.

Each berserker lodge of the Rashemi barbarians has

a spirit totem, and usually the lodge itself is watched over

by a telthor of that kind.

Telthor

Rashemen is rich in untapped spirit magic, and sometimes

in places where people have died defending the land, an echo in

the sleeping spiritual energy grants a person a semblance of life

as a telthor. Normally these people are warriors, fighters, or bar-

barians, but sometimes a spellcaster can become a telthor. These

spirits watch over the battlegrounds where they died, alert for

other invaders or those who would despoil their resting places

and those of their slain allies. If a creature who became a telthor

is  brought  back  from  the  dead,  the  telthor  vanishes  and  the

newly raised person has no memories of that spirit existence.

This telthor can speak and understand Rashemi.

Combat

The sample telthor uses a wolf as the base creature.

Trip (Ex): If this telthor hits with a bite attack, it can at-

tempt to trip the opponent as a free action (see Chapter 8:

Combat in the Players Handbook) without making a touch

attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt

fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the telthor.

Bound to the Land (Su): A telthor that moves more than

1 mile from the place it guards takes 1 point of damage every

74

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

minute. This damage ends immediately if it enters its home

area again.

Incorporeal Subtype: A telthor can be harmed only by other

incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, spells, spell-

like  abilities,  and  supernatural  abilities.  The  creature  has  a

50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source,

except  for  force  effects  or  attacks  made  with  ghost  touch

weapons.  A  telthor  can  pass  through  solid  objects,  but  not

force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor,

and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work nor-

mally  against  them.  A  telthor  always  moves  silently  and

cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Native Animal Empathy (Ex): This telthor can communi-

cate and empathize with other wolves. This gives it a +4 bonus

on checks to influence a wolfs attitude and allows the com-

munication of simple concepts and commands.

Scent (Ex): This telthor can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Telthor Telepathy (Su): Telthors can communicate with one

another telepathically, regardless of language, at a range of

100 feet.

Skills: *This telthor receives a +4 bonus on Survival checks

when tracking by scent.

The Telthor Template

Telthor is a template that can be applied to any animal or

humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The

creatures type changes to fey, and it gains the incorporeal

subtype. It uses all of the base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Telthors can speak and understand Rashemi in addition to

any languages the base creature knew.

Speed: A telthor gains a fly speed equal to its normal speed

(poor  maneuverability),  unless  its  previous  fly  speed  was

better,  in  which  case  the  base  creatures  fly  speed  and  ma-

neuverability is retained.

AC: The telthor loses any natural armor bonus but gains a

deflection bonus equal to the value of its natural armor bonus.

If the creature already has a deflection bonus to AC, use the

greater value. This change does not apply to natural armor or

deflection bonuses granted from spells or magic items.

Attacks:  The  base  creatures  melee  attacks  become  incor-

poreal touch attacks. A creature that used weapons retains the

ability to attack with its melee weapons as melee touch attacks

but loses all ranged attacks. As incorporeal creatures, telthors

apply their Dexterity modifier instead of their Strength mod-

ifier to melee attacks.

Special Qualities: A telthor retains all the base creatures

special  qualities,  and  also  gains  those  special  qualities  listed

below.

Bound to the Land (Su): A  telthor  is  tied  to  the  place  it

guards and is weakened if it moves more than 1 mile from

that  place.  Outside  of  this  area,  it  takes  1  point  of  damage

every minute. This damage ends immediately if it enters its

home area again. Telthors can sense the boundaries of their

territory  and  normally  do  not  leave  them  except  to  warn

others of danger. Rashemen legends tell of telthors that trav-

eled miles to warn the hathrans of an invasion and then died

from the pain of separation before they could be healed.

Native Animal Empathy (Ex): Telthors can communicate

and empathize with animals of their kind. This gives them a

+4  bonus  on  checks  to  influence  the  animals  attitude  and

allows  the  communication  of  simple  concepts  and  (if  the

animal  is  friendly)  commands,  such  as  friend,  enemy,

flee, and attack. A humanoid telthor chooses one kind of

animal for its empathic bond and gains this ability for that

kind of animal only.

Telthor Telepathy (Su): Telthors can communicate with one

another telepathically, regardless of language, at a range of

100 feet.

Abilities: Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is

at  least  3.  As  incorporeal  creatures,  telthors  have  no

Strength score.

Climate/Terrain: Cold forest and hills.

Organization: Solitary or band (25).

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.

Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +2.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Usually neutral.

A thomil, or rock spirit, is a kind of earth elemental local

to the colder parts of Rashemen. Thomils are created or sum-

moned to guard Rashemen against its enemies.

75

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

granted by earth mastery also apply to the thomils opposed

Strength checks.

Elemental Traits (Ex): A thomil is immune to poison, sleep,

paralysis,  and  stunning.  It  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits  or

flanking, and it cannot be raised or resurrected. The creature

also has darkvision (60-foot range).

The Thomil Template

Thomil is a template that can be applied to any elemental crea-

ture with the earth subtype (referred to hereafter as the base

creature). Most thomils use an earth elemental as the base crea-

ture, but in the deep places under Rashemens mountains where

the magma warms the earth, some thomils may be based on other

elemental creatures such as thoqquas. A thomil uses all of the base

creatures statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

AC: Natural armor increases by +2.

Special Attacks: A thomil retains all the special attacks of

the base creature, and also gains the following special attack.

Engulf (Ex): As a standard action, a thomil of size Small

or larger may attempt to envelop an opponent at least one

size category smaller than itself. It cannot make a slam attack

on the round it engulfs prey. The thomil merely has to move

over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Oppo-

nents can make opportunity attacks against the thomil, but

if they do, they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who

do not attempt opportunity attacks must succeed at a Reflex

save (DC 10 + 1/2 thomils Hit Dice + thomils Constitution

modifier) or be engulfed; on a success they are pushed back or

aside (opponents choice) as the thomil moves forward. En-

gulfed creatures are considered grappled and trapped within

the  thomils  body  and  automatically  take  crushing  damage

each round, based on the thomils size, as set out below. The

thomil adds its Strength modifier to the damage dealt.

Thomil

A thomil is an animate piece of rock with a humanoid form

from the waist up but merging into the rock and earth be-

neath  it.  It  normally  rests  under  the  earth,  only  becoming

active on the surface when it senses a threat.

Thomils  are  respected  and  feared  by  the  Rashemi

people, for while they repel invaders, they also strike out

at  greedy  or  short-sighted  natives  who  forget  to  pay

homage to the spirits. Normally, before starting a mining

operation or other action that involves disturbing a large

amount of rock, the local people call a hathran to appease

the thomils in the area.

Thomils speak Terran.

COMBAT

The  sample  thomil  uses  a  medium  earth  elemental  as  the

base creature.

Earth Mastery (Ex): This thomil gains a +1 bonus on attack

and damage if both it and its foe touch the ground. If an op-

ponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a 4

penalty on attack and damage.

Engulf (Ex): For this thomil, the Reflex save DC to avoid

the  engulf  attack  is  17.  The  thomil  can  attempt  to  engulf

Small  or  smaller  opponents.  See  the  template  description,

below, for more information.

Push (Ex): This thomil can start a bull rush maneuver with-

out provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers

An  engulfed  creature  can  attempt  to  cut  its  way  out  of  the

thomils body with either claws or a light slashing or piercing

weapon. Dealing at least one-quarter of the elementals normal

hit points (AC equal to its flat-footed AC) in this way creates an

opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed

creature exits, the thomils body reshapes to close the hole; thus,

another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The en-

gulfed creature can instead attempt an Escape Artist check (DC

15 + 1/2 thomils Hit Dice + thomils Constitution modifier) or

Strength  check  (DC  20  +  thomils  Strength  modifier).  The

thomils body can hold two creatures one size category smaller

than itself, or four of two or more size categories smaller.

The thomil can move and attack normally while envelop-

ing a creature.

76

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

Special Qualities: A thomil retains all the base creatures spe-

cial qualities, and also gains those special qualities listed below.

Boulder Defense (Ex): A thomil can change its shape to a

smooth,  immobile,  boulderlike  form.  In  this  form,  the

thomils damage reduction increases to 15/ and its spell re-

sistance increases by 5, but it cannot move or make attacks.

Assuming this form takes a standard action, while returning

to its semihumanoid form is a free action.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A thomils rocky body grants it

DR 10/+1. If the base creature already has damage reduction,

use the better value.

Cold Resistance (Ex): A thomil has cold resistance 5.

Native  Elemental: Thomils  are  native  to  the  Material

Plane. Spells that banish outsiders or elementals to their home

plane do not work on them. Spells that send outsiders or ele-

mentals to another plane (rather than to their home plane)

work normally. Thomils can be raised or resurrected, although

their remains quickly vanish if killed, making it difficult to

use these spells to restore them to life.

Spell  Resistance  (Ex): A  thomil  has  SR  equal  to  5  +  the

thomils Hit Dice.

Saves: Thomils receive a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws

against spells from creatures they recognize to be Red Wizards.

Abilities: Adjust from the base creature as follows: Con +4,

Int at least 10.

Climate/Terrain: Cold mountains.

Organization: Solitary or patrol (520).

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +1.

Alignment: Usually chaotic neutral.

Troll

Reviled  and  loathed  throughout  Faern,  trolls  are  all  too

common  in  the  Unapproachable  East,  especially  along  the

shores of Lake Ashane, in the mountains of Thesk, and across

the windswept North Country of Rashemen. Three distinct va-

rieties not widely known in other lands plague the East: the

fell troll, the ice troll, and the mur-zhagul (or demon troll).

Fell Troll

Standing taller than a hill giant, the two-headed fell troll is the

largest of its horrid kind. Like any troll, it is a voracious meat-

eater that delights in gorging itself on human prey, but it will

devour anything that moves when humans arent around.

A fell troll is more than 15 feet tall and weighs about 5,000

pounds. Its hide is thick and rubbery, a mottled moss-green

and  gray  color  with  knobby  protrusions,  especially  on  the

shoulders  and  back.  Its  lank,  fleshy  hair  writhes  of  its  own

accord, and its maw is filled with large, sharp fangs. Like its

lesser kin, the fell troll has a hunched, ungainly posture, with

long arms that sometimes brush the ground as it walks.

Fell trolls speak Giant.

COMBAT

A fell trolls tactics are simple. It bounds up to some unlucky

soul and does its best to tear the victim limb from limb.

Rend (Ex): A fell troll that hits with both claw attacks

latches  onto  the  opponents  body  and  tears  the  flesh.

This  attack  automatically  deals  an  additional  4d4+16

points of damage.

Double Mind (Ex): Having two heads, fell trolls are diffi-

cult to charm, confuse, or otherwise deceive with magic. A fell

troll makes two saving throws against any spell or effect call-

ing for a Will save and uses the better of the two results.

Regeneration  (Ex):  Fell  trolls  take  normal  damage  from

fire and acid. If a fell troll loses a limb or body part, the lost

portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the

severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.

Scent  (Ex): A  fell  troll  can  detect  approaching  enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A fell trolls two heads grant it a +2 racial bonus on

Listen, Spot, and Search checks.

Ice Troll

Inhabitants of the frozen north, ice trolls are clever and ma-

licious. Like other trolls, they devour humans, dwarves, and

other humanoids. Unlike the rest of their foul ilk, ice trolls

are skilled armorers and weaponsmiths who craft large and

deadly weapons to use in combat.

An ice troll stands about 8 feet tall and weighs around

400 pounds. Its gelid skin is a sickly, translucent white, and

78

pale blood can be seen coursing through veins just below the

surface.  It  has  a  stoop-shouldered  posture  and  long  arms

that end in icy claws. Ice trolls favor armor made from the

scales of remorhazes or white dragons.

Ice trolls speak Giant.

COMBAT

Ice trolls often begin a fight with a blast of their freezing spit-

tle before wading in to bludgeon their foes with a big,

heavy melee weapon. At any moment, an ice troll

might cast away weapon and shield to sink its

frigid claws into warm-blooded prey.

Freezing  Spittle  (Su):  Three  times  per

day, an ice troll can spit a disgusting glob

of frigid slime with a range of 20 feet. The

troll must make a ranged touch attack to

hit. The target takes 1d4 points of cold

damage and must succeed on a Forti-

tude save (DC 17) or be nauseated for

1 round. The saving throw is Constitu-

tion-based. An ice troll sometimes uses

its freezing spittle to extinguish a flame

carried by its enemies, such as a lantern

or a torch. In this case, the spittle deals

no  damage  to  the  target,  and  the

bearer  may  attempt  to  negate  the

effect with a Reflex save (DC 17).

Cold Subtype (Ex): An ice troll is

immune  to  cold  damage.  Ice  trolls

take  half  again  as  much  (+50%)

damage as normal from fire, regard-

less of whether a saving throw is

allowed, or if the save is a success

or failure.

COMBAT

Demon trolls are clever enough to wield weapons and armor

if they so choose, but most prefer to rip their prey apart with

their bare hands.

Rend  (Ex):  A  mur-zhagul  that  hits

with both claw attacks latches onto the

opponents body and tears the flesh. This

attack automatically deals an additional

2d6+10 points of damage.

Mur-Zhagul (Demon Troll)

Mur-zhaguls are planetouched creatures descended from the

mingling  of  trolls  and  demons,  much  as  a  tanarukk  is  de-

scended from orcs and demons. They combine the feral vo-

raciousness  of  their  troll  ancestors  with  the  supernatural

malice  and  cunning  of  their  fiendish  blood.  Demon  trolls

often live among gangs or bands of normal trolls and usually

rise to their leadership.

A mur-zhagul bears a strong resemblance to a normal troll,

but its skin is a mottled red-orange and tends to be scaly rather

than  warty.  Its  head  is  hairless  and  its  ears  are  long  and

conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its claw to hold

the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the uthraki

is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grap-

ple  check  it  makes  during  successive  rounds  automatically

deals claw damage.

Combat

Uthrakis prefer to fight in their disguised form so their op-

ponents cannot determine what sort of creature they truly are.

Their nails remain amazingly tough even in other forms, al-

lowing them to attack creatures without changing form be-

forehand. They prefer to prowl and attack at night, for they

are stronger in the dark.

Alternate Form (Su): An uthraki can assume the shape of

any Small or Medium-size humanoid or monstrous humanoid

at will. This transformation works like alter self cast by an

18th-level sorcerer, but the uthraki can remain in the chosen

form  indefinitely.  It  can  assume  a  new  form  as  a  standard

action or return to its own form as a free action.

MONSTERS OF THE EAST

The volodnis, or pine folk, are a race of vengeful foresters

who defend the ancient woods of northeastern Faern against

the incursions of the warm folk, as they refer to the hu-

manoid races. They seek to expand the borders of their forest

homelands, regardless of who might stand in their path, and

dream of a day when all Faern once again lies cloaked in un-

broken green.

Volodnis are descended from a forgotten tribe of humans

who traded their humanity in exchange for shelter from their

enemies. They still strongly resemble their human forebears,

although their skin is the deep olive-green of a pine needle,

and their flesh is woody and tough. Clear sap runs through

their veins instead of blood, and their hair grows in long, thick

locks  scaled  like  the  bark  of  a  young  tree.  Their  eyes  are  a

gleaming black, and they are tall and lean, with wide shoul-

ders and long arms. The pine folk do not work metal or kindle

fires if they can help it and favor arms and armor made from

leather and wood, dyed green and brown to blend in with the

forest terrain.

Volodnis  respect  druids  of  any  race  and  often  ally  with

druid circles to deter human expansion in the wild lands. Some

wish to drive off settlers, others prefer to retreat deeper into

the woods and avoid contact altogether, and a few believe that

the time has come to take the struggle to the world beyond

the trees. Most volodnis are driven to bring more of Faerns

forests under their protection, and pine folk roam the East in

search of suitable homes for their kind.

Most  volodnis  encountered  away  from  their  homes  are

warriors; the information presented above describes a 1st-

level  volodni  warrior.  Volodni  rangers  and  druids  are

common as well.

Pine folk typically live to well over 100 years of age. They

speak Common and Sylvan.

Combat

Volodnis  are  remorseless  and  determined  opponents.  They

have little fear of weapon-wielding humans, as they know they

are hard to incapacitate with a single blow.

Half Damage from Piercing (Ex): Piercing weapons deal

only half damage to volodnis, with a minimum of 1 point

of damage.

Plant Traits: Volodnis are immune to poison, sleep, paral-

ysis, stunning, and polymorphing. They are not subject to crit-

ical hits or mind-affecting effects.

Sustenance (Ex): Volodnis require only 2 hours of sleep per

day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep (although arcane

spellcasters must still have 8 hours of rest to prepare spells).

Volodnis only require one-quarter the food and water a human

requires, as they absorb nutrients from their environment.

Skills: *Due to their coloration and ability to remain mo-

tionless, volodnis receive a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in

wooded terrain.

Volodni Society

The pine folk retain some vestige of their long-lost human

tribal society, even though they have little need for food or

shelter. They consider all forests their own tribal lands and

view attempts to harvest the forests resources as a human vil-

lager regards the pillaging of his fields and plundering of his

house. Open-minded pine folk make agreements permitting

limited access to their forests, but many take a more aggres-

sive stance and do not negotiate with intruders.

Volodnis gather in small bands, dwelling in carefully cul-

tivated groves. A druid answerable to a forest-wide hierarchy

of druids leads most volodni bands, while a skilled ranger is

the  bands  war  leader.  Pine  folk  have  little  use  for  magic

other than druidic and regard wizards with suspicion. They

get along well with other forest creatures such as centaurs

and  most  elves,  although  elves  disapprove  of  their  dispas-

sionate ruthlessness.

Pine folk raise few buildings, but open-air stone circles or

hearthstones are common. They make weapons and equipment

from wood, stone, and leather. Experienced volodnis are likely

to carry weapons and armor made of bluewood (see Chapter

5: Magic Items).

Volodni Characters

A volodnis favored class is druid, and most volodni leaders are

druids. Volodni druids usually take Silvanus for their patron

deity. Warriors, fighters, and rangers are common as well. Few

pine folk become arcane spellcasters.

Volodnis have the following abilities and characteristics.

+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, 2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma.

Medium-size.

Land speed 30 feet.

Cold resistance 5.

+4 racial bonus on Hide checks in wooded terrain.

Low-Light Vision: Volodnis can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Plant: Volodnis are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, and polymorphing. They are not subject to critical hits

or mind-affecting effects.

Half damage from Piercing.

Sustenance.

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Sylvan.  Bonus  Lan-

guages: By character region.

Level Adjustment: +2. A volodni has an effective character

level  (ECL)  of  2  plus  class  levels,  so  a  1st-level  volodni

druid would have an ECL of 3.

Favored Class: Druid. A multiclassed volodnis druid class

does not count when determining whether he suffers an

XP penalty.

whose shadow lies over lands from Scornubel to Mulmaster,

are simply not a force in the East. Similarly, the Night Masks

of  Westgate,  the  Lords  Alliance,  and  even  the  far-ranging

Harpers  have  little  to  do  with  lands  such  as  Rashemen  or

Thay. From time to time, these western organizations dispatch

spies or emissaries to the East, but the real power beyond the

Easting Reach lies in the hands of those organizations that are

native to the area.

The Blightlords

Deep in the heart of the Rawlinswood lies a festering wound,

the  wreckage  of  Dun-Tharos,  the  ancient  Nar  capital.  (See

Chapter 12: Thesk for more information.) Here a malevolent

creature known only as the Rotting Man has raised his own

dark citadel, marshalling forces of corruption and evil against

the  surrounding  lands.  The  Rotting  Mans  handpicked  lieu-

tenants  and  emissaries  are  the  blightlords,  evil  clerics  and

druids who hold the power to warp forest creatures to their

sick purposes and scourge the East with Talona-sent plagues.

The blightlords and their feral minions menace Damara,

Impiltur,  and  the  Great  Dale.  Centaurs,  treants,  and  many

noble animals of the Rawlinswood have fallen prey to their

magical plague, becoming horrors of unthinking bloodlust and

hate. Worse yet, the blightlords have ensnared many volodni

warriors for their nihilistic cause. Legions of blightspawned

pine folk now hold the heart of the Rawlinswood and march

at the Rotting Mans command. His army is not yet strong

enough to take on a strong realm such as Damara or Impil-

tur, but bands of blightspawned marauders have brought blood

and  madness  to  the  sleepy  clanholds  and  farmsteads  of  the

Great Dale.

The blightlords are captains and champions of the Rotting

Mans forces, lending their leadership and magical might to

bands of blightspawned marauders. (See the Talontar blight-

lord prestige class in Chapter 2: Prestige Classes.)

d Typical Blightlord: Human cleric 7/Talontar blightlord 3;

CR 10; Medium-size humanoid (human); HD 10d8+20; hp 69;

Artifacts  of  terrible  power  lie  entombed  in  the

wreckage of ancient empires. Unspeakable mon-

strosities  born  of  twisted  sorcery  roam  the

land,  thirsting  for  blood.  Cruel  spirits  rage  against  the

living, harrying mortals with their spectral claws. And a sinis-

ter land of black watchtowers and fell sorcery looms over its

neighbors like a great dark dragon restless in its sleep. To these

lands,  adventurers  from  all  over  Faern  come  in  search  of

fame, fortune, and power.

A campaign set in the Unapproachable East offers a wealth

of possibilities for adventure. The lands of Aglarond, the Great

Dale, and Thesk are mysterious and intriguing destinations for

characters from western Faern. Rashemen and Thay are not

as welcoming to foreign freebooters, but earning the trust and

respect of the Witches (in the case of the former) or sneak-

ing in to spy out the hidden secrets of the Red Wizards (the

latter) make for daring and perilous adventures.

The following chapters detail the five different lands of the

East, including information on major sites and settlements.

Some cities have detailed statistics.

Many of the secret societies and orders familiar to characters

from western Faern have little or no influence in the lands

of  the  Unapproachable  East.  For  example,  the  Zhentarim,

The Church of Kossuth

No one questions the authority of the Red Wizards over Thay,

but  the  red-robed  mages  are  not  the  only  power  in  that

guarded realm. The faith of Kossuth, the Firelord, is preva-

lent throughout Thay. The clerics of Kossuth defer to the Red

Wizardsas  all  in  Thay  mustbut  for  generations,  many

who  would  check  the  wizards  power  have  turned  to  the

Church of Kossuth. The clerics of Kossuth have come to stand

for law, justice, and a fierce national pride that is, in its own

way, every bit as dangerous to the neighboring lands as the

naked ambition of the Red Wizards. Thays millions are cowed

by the Red Wizards and obey their commands out of fear

but should the Church of Kossuth ever supplant that power,

Faern might face the threat of a Thay whose people served

with courageous and selfless devotion.

The Church of Kossuth has little reach outside of Thay, al-

though priests of the Firelord often accompany Red Wizards

abroad. Clergy of Kossuth obey the Red Wizards, but unlike

most  Thayans,  they  are  reasonably  protected  against  the

whims of the ruling mages. The zulkirs know that in a con-

test  for  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  Thayan  people,  the

Firelords clerics would most likely winand therefore they

harshly discipline any of their underlings who threaten the

Church or its agents without sound reason.

The Church sponsors several prominent orders or societies.

The Order of the Fire Drake is a militant arm of the faith,

whose knights guard its holiest locations and are bodyguards

to  important  Kossuthans  abroad.  The  Order  of  the  Black

Flame is a secret society of holy assassins who strike at the en-

emies  of  the  faith  wherever  they  may  lurk.  (See  the  Black

Flame zealot prestige class in Chapter 2: Prestige Classes.) Fi-

nally,  the  Society  of  the  Illuminating  Flame  is  a  monastic

order that schemes to seize mastery of Thay.

The Circle of Leth

The Forest of Lethyr is home to one of the most powerful

druidic hierarchies in all Faernthe followers of the Nent-

yarch, who traditionally governs affairs in Lethyr (and the

Great  Dale  by  default).  They  are  known  collectively  as  the

Circle of Leth, and they are served by the Nentyar hunters,

a strong society of rangers, scouts, and warriors who carry out

the commands of the druid circle. (See the Nentyar hunter

prestige class in Chapter 2: Prestige Classes.)

The Circle of Leth comprises three concentric rings, forming

orders.  Five  high  druids  make  up  the  first  ring,  standing  just

below the Nentyarch. The high druids advise the ruler of the

Circle and are teachers and mentors to those below them. Nine

druid masters make up the second ring and are the most active

in searching out threats to the forest and the dale. They com-

mand the Nentyar hunters in times of war; currently, several are

engaged in a desperate battle to preserve what can be saved of the

nearby Rawlinswood, working to stop the depredations of the Rot-

ting Man and the blightlords. The third and most numerous ring

is  composed  of  the  Circles  initiates,  low-ranking  druids  and

novices  who  serve  among  the  Nentyar  hunters  or  apprentice

themselves to a high druid or druid master, as the Circle requires.

The Nine Golden Swords

Among the teeming Shou towns of Thesks Golden Way lurks

an insidious perilthe Nine Golden Swords, a secret society

of yakuza and their minions who seek to bind the Shou expa-

triates beneath their own ruthless rule. Once all Shou in Thesk

serve the Nine Golden Swords, the masters of the society aim

to make themselves the secret lords of the land.

The rogues and thugs who make up the hundreds of soldiers

in the society go about their sordid business in much the same

manner as crime syndicates anywhere do. They peddle vices of

all sorts in dens and houses of ill repute along the Golden Way,

rob passing caravans, and intimidate local business owners,

83

ADVENTURING IN THE EAST

demanding a ruinous cut of legitimate enterprises. So far, they

have been cautious in extorting native Theskians, preferring to

maintain a chokehold on their fellow Shou instead of provok-

ing the merchant-princes. Now the Nine Golden Swords have

just about conquered their chosen battlefield, and the riches of

their neighbors beckon. Shou thugs and gangsters are moving

their operations into the heart of Theskian business all along

the Golden Way.

The  Nine  Golden  Swords  are  led  by  a  mysterious  figure

known as the Golden Master. The city of Phsant is the base

of their power; the Golden Master can muster hundreds of

loyal soldiers in the Shou quarter of that city, if he so chooses.

The Shadowmasters of Telflamm have no use for the Nine

Golden Swords, and a fierce gang-war has sprung up between

the two powerful societies.

The Red Wizards of Thay

No discussion of powerful organizations would be complete

without mentioning the Red Wizards, a society of such am-

bition and ruthlessness that their reach extends across a con-

tinent.  Red  Wizard  enclaves  dot  the  shores  of  the  Sea  of

Fallen Stars, exporting deadly and wondrous magic to cities

and  kingdoms  throughout  Faern  in  exchange  for  goods,

slaves, and coin of unimaginable value.

While the Red Wizards are discussed at length in Chapter

11: Thay, their influence pervades all the lands of the Unap-

proachable  East.  Thayan  spies  skulk  among  the  people  of

Aglarond  and  Rashemen,  seeking  ways  to  sow  dissent  and

weakness among the traditional enemies of their land. Thayan

merchants  and  wizards  dominate  the  Wizards  Reach  and

wield  great  power  in  cities  such  as  Nethentir  and  Tammar.

Those states are nominally independent, but the Red Wizards

could devour them in a tenday if they chose.

The Shadowmasters

of Telflamm

Ruthless and sinister, the Shadowmasters are one of the most

successful and widespread thieves guilds in all Faern. Only

the Shadow Thieves of Amn, and perhaps the Night Masks of

Westgate,  rival  their  power.  Shadowmaster  guilds  lurk  in

Emmech,  Escalant,  Laothkund,  Nethentir,  Nethjet,  Nyth,

Phent, Phsant, Uthmere, and even Bezantur in Thay, schem-

ing  to  plunder  from  commoner  and  noble  alike.  The  Shad-

owmasters secretly rule Thesk, since many of the merchant

princes who make up the lands governing Council are either

spies for, or thoroughly intimidated by, the guild.

While the Shadowmasters virtually rule Telflamm through

its weak Merchants Council, they do not yet exercise the same

political power in other cities, such as Emmech or Escalant.

There the Shadowmaster presence is limited to small bands of

thieves content to burglarize, embezzle, extort, and mug in

the manner of criminal gangs everywhere. But unlike other

guilds,  these  Shadowmaster  cells  are  eyes  and  ears  for  the

entire  organization,  funneling  information  back  to  their

ADVENTURING IN THE EAST

hungry overlords in Telflamm. In turn, the presence of Shad-

owmasters in nearby cities allows these minor guilds to quickly

dispose of dangerous merchandise and offers ready safehouses

to members in trouble with local authorities.

Shadowmaster agents seek out news of mercantile transac-

tions  or  the  discovery  of  unexpected  wealth,  such  as  the  re-

covery  of  a  long-lost  hoard  by  a  band  of  adventurers.  They

inform the organizations leaders, who decide on the appropri-

ate course of action (often an operation to seize the wealth they

view as rightfully theirs). The Shadowmasters also serve as in-

formation brokers for those who arent picky about the source,

although their services are not cheap. Those who once do busi-

ness with the Shadowmasters find that the thieves can make it

difficult, even dangerous, not to do business with them again.

The Simbulmyn

The Simbulmyn, or Simbuls Guard, is a small company of elite

palace guards who do much more than simply protect Agla-

ronds queen. They are also expert spies, engaging in secret mis-

sions in lands all around the Inner Sea. The primary concern

of the Simbulmyn is the safety of the Simbul, but the general

security and good order of Aglarond is a very close second, and

they maintain a vigilant eye on all potential enemies.

The Simbulmyn devote most of their efforts to watching the

armies of Thay and spying out the plans of the zulkirs, tasks

that call for lengthy undercover journeys into the heartland of

Aglaronds forbidding neighbor. The Guard also work assidu-

ously to identify and neutralize Thayan spies in Aglarondan ter-

ritory.  Of  late,  the  rise  of  the  Sons  of  Hoar  (see  below)  has

attracted their attention, although the Simbulmyn are hesitant

to suppress the movement for fear of throwing fuel on the fire.

The Simbuls Guard is under the command of High Captain

Hovor Seawind (CG male half-elf fighter 4/rogue 6/Aglaron-

dan griffonrider 8), a former adventurer who is fanatically de-

voted to his queen and would give his life for her in a heartbeat.

Only  experienced  combatants  who  have  demonstrated  their

loyalty to Aglarond are invited to join the Simbulmyn; the typ-

ical member is a human or half-elf Ftr4/Rog2, although many

wizards and sorcerers may also be found among their ranks.

The Sons of Hoar

Not all Aglarondans are content to be ruled by an immortal

sorcerer-queen. Some among the wealthy old families of Vel-

printalar  and  Furthinghome  believe  the  Simbuls  rule  is  a

hopeless despotism with no end in sight. The Sons of Hoar are

a secret society of nobles, well-to-do merchants, and landown-

ers who long to shape events in Aglarond as in other lands

with the power of coin and the rule of law.

Many of the Sons of Hoar hope for opportunities to enrich

themselves at the expense of others, but the organization also

includes  idealists  and  populists  who  argue  that  the  Simbul

cannot truly understand the concerns of common folk. The

cynical hardcore of the society are happy to let the idealists

stirring words and impassioned pleas mask their own plots.

Thus, the Sons consist of a secret leadership of nobles and

merchants (many of lawful evil alignment) who lurk behind

a much larger group of younger men who romanticize rev-

olution and dream of winning over the hearts of the Agla-

rondan people.

The Sons of Hoar are bound by a common veneration for the

Doombringer, as one might expect. In Aglarond, Hoars old Un-

theric  aspects  of  law,  justice,  and  noble  war  overshadow  the

deitys portfolio of vengeance. The High Fatemaster Nomyr

Dedriech (LN male human Clr12 of Hoar) is the current First

Son, although the true power in the organization is the wealthy

Duke  Varran  Gloskil  (LE  male  human  Ari8/Ftr7).  Gloskil

dreams of reshaping Aglarond as a land free of witches and

elves, under the rule of merchant oligarchs such as himself.

The  Sons  of  Hoar  are  growing  more  restive  and  daring.

Their agents seek to cultivate foreign support for the Simbuls

overthrow, intimidate the sorcerer-queens supporters through

kidnapping and sabotage, and infiltrate the army and palace

guards of Aglarond.

The Wychlaran

The Witches of Rashemen, or wychlaran as they call them-

selves, are discussed at length in Chapter 10: Rashemen, but

like  the  Red  Wizards  of  Thay,  their  actions  and  influence

ripple  throughout  the  lands  of  the  East.  For  centuries,  the

wychlaran  defended  their  homeland  against  Thay,  but  now

that  the  Red  Wizards  have  set  aside  their  dreams  of  con-

quering their neighbors in favor of aggressive and forthright

trade, the Witches are unsure how to proceed.

Without  the  constant  threat  of  Thayan  raids,  spies,  or

armies, the wychlaran have turned to strengthening their land

against  the  war  they  know  must  follow  Thays  commercial

overtures. Witches roam the nearby lands of Thesk, Ashanath,

and the Great Dale, keeping a wary eye on all Thayan activ-

ities and building up a network of foreign informants to pro-

vide key insights into Thayan plans. Since Thayan spies are no

longer  creeping  into  Rashemen  in  numbers,  the  wychlaran

seek  them  out  in  foreign  lands  and  find  other  problems  to

worry about in the processthe blightlords of the Rawlins-

wood, the Shadowmasters of Telflamm, even the Nine Golden

Swords of Thesk.

ADVENTURING IN THE EAST

Dungeons in the

Unapproachable

East

A  dungeon  is  traditionally  an  underground  chamber  in

which prisoners are incarcerated, but adventurers in Faern

use the term more loosely. To them, just about anything un-

derground is a dungeon, preferably populated with monsters

rather  than  prisoners.  Mines,  ruins,  caves,  subterranean

homes, and passages all qualify.

By the adventurers definition, there are dozens of dungeons

across Faern, many of which have long ago been looted, while

others have lain undisturbed for centuries. When it comes to

dungeons, the Unapproachable East is no exception. The most

notorious of these are listed here.

Citadel Rashemar: Once the home of a large Rashemi army

charged with keeping watch over the Golden Way, this fortress

was destroyed by the Tuigan horde when it passed through in

1359 DR. It has since been taken over by the hag Chaur and

her partner in evil, the dreaded half-orc cleric Durakh. They

have moved a small army of goblins into the area, under the

charge of eight ogre barbarians. See Chapter 10: Rashemen.

City of Weeping Ghosts: North of Kront lie the ruins of a

great  city  along  the  shore  of  Lake  Ashane.  This  was  Shan-

daular, capital of the realm of Ashanath, a petty Nar kingdom

destroyed by the Nentyarch of Tharos almost two thousand

years ago. Many powerful undead haunt the place, and few ad-

venturers care to remain in the ruins after the sun goes down.

Clymph Tower: These ruins were sealed off long ago. Today,

the only way into them is via the portal in Tower Threespires.

The tower, and especially the vaults beneath it, is infested with

evil creatures from other planes. Many adventurers have tried

to clear out this infestation of evil, only to be crucified by the

fiends they were arrogant enough to believe they could destroy.

Dun-Tharos: Formerly the capital of ancient Narfell, this

great ruin sits near the center of the Rawlinswood (see Chap-

ter 9: The Great Dale). Great plazas and wrecked temples de-

voted to demonic powers lie half-buried in the boggy forest,

and the treasures of Narfells sinister lords are said to lie in

buried storehouses and conjuring chambers beneath the old

ruins.  Dun-Tharos  is  virtually  unexplored  by  adventurers;

the powerful druid known as the Nentyarch raised his own

living fortress of magical trees over the evil ruins and for

centuries chased off explorers. The Nentyarch is gone now,

displaced by the Rotting Man and his blightlords. Impudent

adventurers  hoping  to  plumb  the  royal  vaults  of  Narfell

must contend with the Talontar and their army of blight-

spawned creatures.

Fortress of the Half-Demon: This old Nar fortress lies in

Rashemens  North  Country,  overlooking  the  northernmost

arm of Lake Ashane. It is named for its great brazen gate,

forged in the shape of a demonic face. Squat and strong, the

keep  remains  intact,  and  its  surface  levels  have  been  taken

over by a band of brigands led by Losk, a hagspawn warrior-

mage.  The  marauders  harry  travelers  along  the  lonely,

windswept stretch of the Long Road that passes nearby. Deep

conjuring  chambers  lie  beneath  the  keep,  still  haunted  by

things summoned almost twenty centuries ago.

The Great Barrow: About seventy miles east of Uthmere

along the Great Road stands a mysterious barrow-field dom-

inated by the Great Barrowan artificial mound the size of

a small hill, heaped up in three concentric steps. The barrow,

said to predate ancient Narfell, might be five thousand years

old or more. If anyone has found an entrance, it has not been

reported, but the whole area has a bad reputation as a place

where old and hateful undead lurk. See Chapter 12: Thesk.

Ring of Gray Flames: Three days ride east of Mulptan, hard

on the borders of the Endless Waste, stands this ancient Rau-

mathari ruin. Five broken towers stand in a ring, each crowned

by a flickering gray flame. Strange and perilous magic taints

the landscape surrounding them, including magical constructs

that seem to be spells given life, longevity, and dire purpose.

See Chapter 10: Rashemen.

The Sunglade: The Sunglade actually covers an incredible

dungeon that stretches for miles beneath the Yuirwood. The

only way to get into it, however, is by means of one of the

menhir circle portals. Only the masters of the Yuirwood can

activate them, and they rarely poke around in the environs

below. They know some things in this world are better left

undisturbed. Some scholars theorize that this complex is where

the ancient Yuir elves escaped to when they found humans en-

croaching on their ancestral lands, but there has been no proof

of this as of yet. See Chapter 8: Aglarond.

Telflamm  Harbor:  What  is  now  Telflamm  harbor  was

once a proud cliff face in ancient times, where the powers

of  the  region  ruled.  The  cliff  was  destroyed  in  a  massive

magical accident that hurled it almost intact into the sea.

Heroes who can breathe water might find all sorts of treas-

ure beneath the harbors waves, assuming they can pry it

out of the hands of the locathahs that have moved in. See

Chapter 12: Thesk.

Thaymount: The mountains that form the center of Thay

are riddled with all sorts of underground passages. Many of

these merely connect the homes and dungeons belonging to

the most powerful of the Red Wizards. Others sink deeper into

the earth, into regions best left alone. The zulkirs have been

beating back an incursion from below over the past few years,

another reason they dont wish to be engaged in a battle along

their borders.

Umbergoth: This massive mountain on the border between

Aglarond and Thay is currently home to Nartheling, an an-

cient fang dragon. The creature has welcomed all sorts of evil

creatures to the mountain under a loose alliance. None are in-

dividually strong enough to challenge the mighty dragon, but

they should be sufficient to handle most intruders foolhardy

enough to brave the steep slopes of lonely Umbergoth.

Umlaor:  This  island  was  once  the  center  of  civilization

throughout the Wizards Reach and the Alamber Sea. It was

the most important shipping port in the region, and thousands

of people lived thereright up until the day the places rulers

A Rashemi berserker encounters an ice troll

lost  a  bet  with  a  demon  prince  and  paid  with  the  death  by

drowning  of  all  they  held  dear.  Umlaor  lies  less  than  fifty

miles west of the Alaor, once part of the same chain of islands.

Today, local sahuagin live in the upper levels of this sunken

island, but the caverns farther below are filled with creatures

so noxious as to turn the waters black with their passage.

Val-Murthag: Once the religious capital of demon-haunted

Narfell, this sprawling city was leveled by the battle magic of

the  Raumathari  in  the  last  war  between  those  two  ancient

realms. Its cyclopean walls and shattered towers lie two days

march from Bezentil, in a wild and lonely corner of the Great

Dale. Little is left on the surface, but deep vaults filled with

imprisoned  demons  and  restless  Nar  ghosts  lie  beneath  the

citys numerous keeps.

Wilderness

Encounter Tables

The East is a vast region encompassing nearly 500,000 square

miles. Outside the plateau of Thay, the Golden Way, and the

coasts of Aglarond and the Easting Reach, much of this area

is wilderness.

Encounter Chance

As a party travels across the lands of the Unapproachable East,

there is a chance per hour of travel of a wilderness encounter,

as  set  out  in  Table  71:  Wilderness  Encounter  Chance.  The

first number in a column is for a single hour of travel in that

type of terrain; the second (in parentheses) is the chance of a

single encounter in 8 hours of travel in that terrain. If the ter-

rain does not change in the course of a days travel, its much

easier to make a single check and then determine randomly

when during the day the encounter takes place.

that  are  stopped  or  camped  normally.  Parties  camping  in

secret or hiding use the Concealed Camping/Hiding column.

A party that lights a fire is never camping in secret unless

they can somehow hide the light and smoke.

Desolate areas are not settled and generally do not support

great numbers of wildlife or monsters.

Berserkers: 1d3+1 1st-level human barbarians and 1d2 bar-

barians of level 1d4+1. Berserkers are usually chaotic neutral.

Blooded One Squad: 1d6+4 blood orcs, 1d3 blood orc fight-

ers (level 1d3), and a blood orc leader of level 1d4+2. To de-

termine  the  leaders  class,  roll  d%:  cleric  0140,  fighter

4190, rogue 91100.

Wilderness  areas  are  not  settled  but  support  significant

Bugbear Band: 1d6+4 bugbears, 1d3 bugbear fighters (level

wildlife or monsters.

Frontier areas are lightly settled, but communities are small

and far apart.

Settled areas feature broad stretches of cleared land, small

villages and thorps no more than a days travel from one an-

other, and some patrols from nearby cities or fortresses.

There  are  fifteen  general  adventuring  areas  in  the  Unap-

proachable East, whose encounter chances are described in tables

72 through 716 below. These supplant the encounter tables

in the FORGOTTEN REALMS DUNGEON MASTERs Screen, since

they provide more localized encounter possibilities. Encounter

areas  are:  Aglarond  and  Altumbel;  the  Aglarondan  coastal

waters; Ashanath and the North Country; the Dragonjaw and

Thesk Mountains; the Forest of Lethyr; the Firward, Icerim

and Northern Sunrise Mountains; the Great Dale; Lake Ashane;

Rashemen;  the  Rawlinswood;  the  Sunrise  Mountains;  Thay;

Thesk; the Umber Marshes; and the Yuirwood.

How to Use the

Encounter Tables

Each encounter table includes the following information:

d%: The result on percentile dice that will generate this en-

counter. Use the Day or Night column, as appropriate.

Encounter: The type of creature encountered. Some of these

may be groups, such as an orc patrol or merchant caravan. If

the listed creature is a template, use the sample creature whose

statistics appear in the template entry.

Notations that identify a monsters source follow some en-

tries, as shown below. If there is no note, the creature is listed

in the Monster Manual.

Situated  on  a  long  peninsula  that  stabs  like  a  knife

into the heart of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Aglarond

is  a  land  of  open  water  and  deep  woods.  Here

humans  and  elves  have  intermingled  for  centuries,  and  no-

where else in Faern is there a greater concentration of half-

elves. The land has long stood as a bulwark holding back the

Red Wizards of Thay from the western lands. This is a thank-

less task, but the people of Aglarond take it up not for the

survival of other countries, but their own.

Geographic

Overview

The Aglarondan peninsula is roughly 540 miles long from the

westernmost islands off the peninsulas tip to the eastern edge

of the Umber Marshes. At its widest point, its around 180

miles  across,  but  this  narrows  to  practically  nothing  at  its

western tip. The vast portion of this length of land is roughly

150 miles across from north to south.

Much of the Dragonjaw Mountains are also part of Agla-

rond, although the northwestern range is generally consid-

ered part of Thesk. However, the lands beyond the fortress

at Emmech are past the direct protection of the armies of

Aglarond  and  are  thinly  populated  for  this  reason  among

others. This is an unforgiving part of the country, beset not

only  by  monsters  but  by  the  ever-encroaching  forces  of

Thay. Today, the minions of the Red Wizards are more rare,

but  the  areas  monsters  still  pose  a  grave  threat  to  home-

steaders and travelers alike.

Although  Aglarond  is  at  roughly  the  same  latitude  as

Cormyr, its weather is much more moderate. No place in

the countryeven the heart of the Yuirwoodis farther

95

than ninety miles from the sea, and most of its cities are

actually  on  the  peninsulas  rocky  coast.  The  waters  mod-

erate the weather, so the seasons are rarely as harsh as they

are elsewhere.

Aglarond  is  isolated  from  the  rest  of  Faern  by  the

plateau of Thay to the east and the Sea of Fallen Stars on

three other sides. Thus it separates the Easting Reach of the

north from the Wizards Reach and the Alamber Sea of the

south.  The  Pirate  Isles  lie  only  a  hundred  miles  or  so  off

Aglaronds own western islands, but since piracy is punish-

able by immediate execution in Aglarond, most buccaneers

give the land a wide berth. The length of water that sepa-

rates  Aglarond  from  Thesk  is  known  as  the  Sea  of  Dlurg.

This  is  more  of  a  bay  than  a  proper  sea:  At  its  narrowest

point, about midway down its length, only fifteen miles sep-

arate the city of Furthinghome from the Theskian shore.

While the Yuirwood covers much of Aglarond, the land be-

tween the trees and the shore consists of fertile, rolling hills

that make excellent farmland. Farms are rarely more than

ten  miles  from  the  shore.  The  half-elves  who  make  their

home under the Yuirwoods leafy canopy discourage large-

scale settlement of the forest with a mixture of compromise,

diplomacy, and the occasional veiled threat. Despite such ef-

forts,  though,  the  woods  continue  to  recede  every  year.

Grasses, shrubs, and vines quickly reclaim abandoned farm-

steads, but trees are slow to return to territory stripped from

the Yuirwood long ago.

AGLAROND

Major Geographic

Features

From its rocky shores to the heart of the Yuirwood, Aglarond

is a land that defines its people as much as they define it. Its

isolation and its long history of sieges by Thay have made the

once-trusting  Aglarondan  people  suspicious  of  outlanders

anyone could be an agent of their hated enemy. As the edges

of the Yuirwood recede, Aglarondans have become exposed to

the scrutiny of the outer world, forcing them to interact more

with those from without.

Altumbel

To most people, all of the Aglarondan peninsula is one land,

but not to those who live in Altumbel. When Aglarond was

formed many centuries ago, after long years of war, humans

and half-elves agreed to share power in the form of a coun-

cil  of  locally  appointed  leaders  led  by  a  king.  A  number  of

humans were too bitter from the wars to lay aside their ani-

mosity. Rather than become part of this new nation, they set

out for the far western end of the peninsula, claiming it as

their own.

In addition to the narrow cape at the end of the Aglaron-

dan peninsula, Altumbel includes the mazelike archipelago of

the  Thousand  Swords.  Most  of  these  islets  are  desolate  and

rocky, covered with low scrub and lichen, but some are fairly

large. Ghevden, the largest, is more than thirty miles wide and

is home to several populous villages of fishers, herders, and

merchants. One-third of Altumbels people live scattered over

the barren Swords. Pirates harry the islands, but many hail

from the Swords themselvesraiding ones neighbors is some-

thing of a local tradition.

Altumbel and its archipelago are almost entirely devoid of

woods.  The  people  here  dont  care  for  trees,  which  remind

them  of  the  Yuirwoods  half-elves.  Most  make  their  living

from  the  sea,  either  netting  fish  or  trapping  shellfish.  The

land is rocky and unforgiving, not much good for farming, al-

though some sheltered dells are suitable for gardening. These

sun-warmed and wind-protected valleys usually have springs

and the occasional cave.

Altumbel boasts a history of harboring pirates, daring (or

foolhardy) characters who knew the lay of the reefs beneath

the sea and used them to confound less knowledgeable pur-

suers. In fact, Spandeliyon, the capital of the region, is still

known as the City of Pirates. These days, however, the Simbuls

harsh punishment of pirates has put the lie to that name. Few

dare to brave the ladys wrath, even in a city so far from her

home in Velprintalar.

Beyond the rocky, fog-cloaked northern shores of Altum-

beland all Aglarond, in factthe sea quickly drops off into

a deep trench. The seasonal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich

waters make this place a fishers paradise.

Dragonjaw Mountains

The Dragonjaws separate Aglarond from Thesk to the north.

While relations between the two countries are generally fine,

both are happy to have a bit of distance between them. For

Aglarond, the Dragonjaw Mountains are another natural de-

fense against the forces of Thay or other invaders, prevent-

ing  armies  from  crossing  the  River  Umber  or  the  Sea  of

Dlurg. The northern coastal settlements face only a few small

fishing villages across the watery gap, hugging the sheer faces

of slopes that drop rapidly into the sea.

Only the Tannath Mountains and the Tannath Gapboth

described laterare considered part of Aglarond. The rest of

the mountains belong solidly to Thesk.

THE WATCHWALL

This  massive,  magically  engineered  length  of  stone  wall

stretches from the fortress city of Glarondar to the slopes of

Umbergoth.  This  extends  the  defensive  barrier  of  the

Dragonjaw Mountains another fifteen miles, up to a rocklike

fortification containing one-third of Aglaronds armed forces.

The galeb duhrsa race of earth elementalsbuilt the wall

during the reign of King Brindor, the first ruler of Aglarond.

In exchange, the king pledged the aid of his people whenever

the galeb duhrs might call for it. So far they have not, but

if  the  Thayans  ever  turn  their  attention  to  this  secretive

people, the Simbul would be obliged to come to their rescue,

no matter the potential cost.

The Watchwall is 30 feet high and 10 feet thick. It is seam-

less (Climb DC 25) and features no gates or windows. Wide

stairs  are  carved  into  the  Aglarond  side  of  the  wall  every

quarter-mile or so, and the guards atop the wallknown as the

Watcherscarry rope to lower themselves down in case of

emergency. They sometimes throw a rope down to visitors

on the Thayan side, but only to those confirmed as friends

of Aglarond.

Units  of  the  Aglarondan  army  stationed  at  Glarondar

patrol the length of the Watchwall at all times, staring out

across the desolate Umber Marshes. Recently theyve observed

a number of shambling mounds staring back, but the creatures

have taken no further step toward the wall, watching quietly

even  as  the  occasional  lost  unit  of  undead  Thayan  soldiers

makes a mad attack. Thayan diplomats explain away these in-

cidents as regrettable but understandable; the Red Wizards cre-

ated thousands of such creatures, many of which went missing

after the latest round of hostilities.

Guard barracks are set up on the Aglarondan side of the

wall,  one  at  each  mile  marker.  When  not  on  patrol,  the

Watchwalls soldiers rest here, preparing for the call to arms

they know must inevitably come. Whether it happens sooner

or later is anyones guess.

AGLAROND

The Fang

The Fang is the part of the north coast that juts out the far-

thest  into  the  sea.  Although  close  to  Aglaronds  capital,  its

people  here  consider  themselves  part  of  another  land.  This

hard  territory  contains  two  settlements:  Findar  and  Dhast.

Both are windswept fishing ports filled with people who are

as weathered as their homes.

The people of the Fang (derisively called Fangers) are even

more suspicious of foreigners than those of Altumbel. They

dont  dislike  just  half-elves;  they  cant  stand  anyone  who

wasnt born and raised in the area. There are no inns in this

land. Strangers simply are not welcome.

A gleaming white tower known as the Fang Light stands

proudly at the far end of the Fang. The wizard Thymar (NG

male  human  Wiz12)  tends  to  the  beacon  atop  the  tower,  a

light that guides travelers clear of the local reefs.

Unbeknownst  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  an  Altumbellan

pirate, Quelzur Naismen (LE male human Rog5/Sor8), has re-

cently captured the lighthouseand Thymar along with it.

Naismen is in the pay of the Sons of Hoar, who want to dis-

rupt trade in the area; the sinister marauder uses a hat of dis-

guise to  pose  as  Thymar,  manipulating  the  beacon  to  cause

ship after ship to founder on the nearby reefs. He has so far

sent half a dozen vessels to a watery end and plundered their

holds. Someones sure to come looking for the ships eventu-

ally, but when that happens, Naismen will be ready.

Tannath Mountains

The Tannath Mountains form the southern range of the Drag-

onjaws, south of the River Umber, which flows from the heart

of Thay past the Aglarondan fortress at Emmech. Tall and

rugged, they form the bulk of Aglaronds geographical defenses

against Thay. They are considered unscalable by humanoids

especially the peak of Umbergoth at the easternmost edge

but wide passes flank them on both sides. To the west is the

Tannath Gap, while the Shyvar Pass is wedged between the rest

of the Tannaths and Umbergoth to the east.

The steep, bare slopes of the Tannaths are a discouraging

prospect for most homesteaders. Little more than birds and

mountain goats reside here. The most notable exceptions are

the griffons that nest atop the highest peaks and the ancient

fang dragon of Umbergoth.

is a threat. Those creatures smart enough to realize they were

not welcome have long since left.

Still, unnatural creatures wander through the Gap. Atten-

tive travelers can spot griffons from the Tannaths soaring

overhead, but they rarely get close enough to interact with

earthbound souls.

The River Umber, long a natural barrier between Aglarond

and  its  neighbors,  has  recently  become  a  pulsing  artery  of

trade passing in and out of the country through Emmech. De-

spite the recent improvement in relations between Aglarond

and Thay, though, few dare to eat fish from the waters of the

Umber, much less swim in it. Living downriver from a civi-

lization that has spent centuries trying to destroy them has

created generations of distrust that a few good years of trade

wont allay.

SHYVAR PASS

The Shyvar Pass is a much more difficult passage through the

Tannath Mountains than the Tannath Gap, varying in width

from 100 yards to ten miles. It seems a natural invasion route

for Thay, and the Red Wizards have attempted the pass sev-

eral times over the centuries. However, it is high, narrow, and

tortuous, filled with places where a small company can hold

off an army. Aglarondan watchtowers keep an eye on the pass,

but these days they greet Thayan trade caravans instead of

fending off raiders.

UMBERGOTH

Umbergoth is the mightiest mountain in all of Aglarond. In

recent years, Nartheling, an ancient fang dragon, decided to

carve  out  a  home  for  itself  in  the  caves  riddling  the  snow-

capped crest. This creature plagues the trade caravans passing

back and forth between Aglarond and Thay. It doesnt choose

sides, but it prefers the Thayan trade trains stocked with magic

items. It remains a mystery why the creature is gathering such

things and what it plans to do with them.

Umbergoth is so high that its peak always wears a snowy

mantle,  even  in  the  hottest  days  of  summer.  Griffons,  hip-

pogriffs, and giant eagles used to soar in the updrafts around

the mountain, but Nartheling has scared off all but the most

foolhardy of such beasts.

THE TANNATH GAP

Umber Marshes

The Tannath Gap is a narrow range of woodland between the

Tannaths  and  the  rest  of  the  Dragonjaw  Mountains.  The

slopes drop steeply to the narrow plains surrounding the River

Umber, which winds down the middle of the gap. The fauna

is typical for the region: deer, foxes, squirrels, badgers, rac-

coons, opossums, otters, beavers, and so on; there are few mon-

sters  here.  Travelers,  Thayan  invaders,  and  Aglarondan

defenders  alike  have  hunted  most  dangerous  species  in  the

region to near extinctiononly the occasional mountain lion

The Umber Marshes are so named for their rust-brown color,

which they get from vast amounts of submerged iron. More

than one dwarf has commented, If you could only drain it,

what a beautiful mine youd have.

These wetlands consists of almost impassable bogs, swamps,

and mudflats, run through with shallow streams that drain

south into the River Lapendrar and from there into the Wiz-

ards  Reach.  Both  Aglarond  and  Thay  claim  the  territory,

though neither country really wants the waterlogged lands.

Since they form the first line of defense between two nations

Umber Marshes

that  have  traditionally  been  at  war,  many  conflicts  have

played out here, the muck running crimson with the blood of

armies. The most effective troops in this miserable land are

Thays undead hordes. However, the dampness causes zombies

to rot at an accelerated pace, and undead foot soldiers fare no

better than the living when traversing the muck.

The Umber Marshes are also home to dangerous creatures,

including monstrous vermin, poisonous snakes, hydras, sham-

bling mounds, and trolls. Yet those threats seem minor com-

pared  to  the  clouds  of  biting  insects  that  follow  every

red-blooded creature passing through the place. These pests

are sources of disease as well as discomfort, and more than

one noble warrior has met an ignoble end by such insignif-

icant creatures.

Recently, the shambling mounds of the Umber Marshes

have either found a leader or developed some sort of collec-

tive intelligence. At first, they lined up about a mile from the

marshes  southern  border,  gazing  out  toward  the  River

Lapendrar beyond. Now they have formed a second line look-

ing up and out at the Watchwall, and some have been spot-

ted as far west as Glarondar. Some of Thays zulkirs, including

Szass Tam, believe the shambling mounds are the reconsti-

tuted  remains  of  thousands  of  undead  soldiers  lost  in  the

marshes, and they hope to advantage of this. If they can mag-

ically wrest control of these creatures, they can turn what was

once  a  natural  barrier  into  a  terrible  weapon  against  the

people of Aglarond.

The truth is so far unsuspected by both Aglarond and Thay.

A trio of undead druids known as the Umber Council have

been creating and directing the plant monsters for months.

The druids have set up a vast underground lair in the heart

of  the  marshes,  forming  vines  and  plants  to  prop  up  the

rooms and tunnels they forced open in the muck. The leader

of  the  Umber  Council  is  Ysvel  the  Black  (NE  female  lich

Drd18) who was driven mad by an ancient artifacta rusted

iron rod known as the Ironwoodthat she uncovered in the

sucking mud of her home marshes years ago. (For more about

the  Ironwood, see  Chapter  5:  Magic  Items.)  She  killed  her

acolytes in their sleep and then turned them into juju zombies

at the command of the device. Under its malevolent influence,

she  transformed  herself  into  a  licha  rare  choice  among

druids. She now leads her undead fellows in creating an army

of shambling mounds. No one knows what Ysvel plans, but

shes clearly up to no good.

The Wizards Reach

Along the southern shores of the Aglarondan peninsula lie the

cities of the Wizards Reach. Between the Sea of Fallen Stars

and the Yuirwood stretches a broad, sunny plain more than

300 miles long and up to eighty miles wide. Unlike the north-

ern coastal plain, the Wizards Reach is low, marked by ex-

tensive  tidal  marshes  and  barrier  islands,  which  makes

east-west travel difficult.

99

AGLAROND

The Wizards Reach is not part of the kingdom of Aglarond

and never has been. It is so named for the powerful magical

empires that dominated this stretch of water for thousands of

years. Its cities were founded by the people of ancient Unther

(and Chessenta, which was subjugated by Unther at the time),

and  over  the  last  ten  centuries  they  have  been  Untheric

colonies, independent, a loose league of their own, Chessentan

conquests, independent again, and finally Thayan conquests,

which is the current situation. In practice, the Red Wizards

hold Escalant in strength, Laothkund loosely, and Delthuntle

not at all.

The Wizards Reach has always been wilder and less settled

than the lands to the north. It has been nearly three centuries

since any single power grasped these cities in one hand, so com-

munications and settlement in the lands between are haphaz-

ard. Monsters shelter in the southern eaves of the Yuirwood,

roaming  the  wilder  places  of  the  coastal  plains,  and  the

marshes are home to dangerous lizardfolk and sivs. Most travel

and trade between cities is by searuined settlements and for-

gotten towers are common along the abandoned coastal roads.

The Yuirwood

The Yuirwood is named for the Yuir, the ancient star elves and

green elves who once made this part of the world their home.

Once this vast, green forest covered almost the entire penin-

sula, but today Aglaronds largest cities and most of its people

are scattered along its rocky northern coast. In six centuries

of human settlement, its northern edges have receded up to

fifty miles from the coast at some points, but the tenacious

forest seems to be making a comeback.

The Yuirwood divides Aglarond into two nationsor three,

if you count Altumbel as separate, as its inhabitants do. The

Aglarond most travelers see is the old human realm of Vel-

prin along the coastal plains of the northern shore. It consists

of  wide,  rolling  farmlands  and  handsome  port  cities,  inter-

spersed with the manors and estates of Aglaronds human no-

bility and wealthy merchants. While half-elves thrive here,

they are outnumbered by their human kin. Some fear that in

the lands north of the Yuirwood, Aglaronds half-elven her-

itage is slowly drowning in a rising sea of humanity.

The  other  Aglarondthe  old,  true  landconsists  of  the

half-elf villagers and foresters who call the Yuirwood their

home.  These  are  an  insular  people,  suspicious  of  strangers,

even fellow Aglarondans of the coasts. They recognize the rule

of the Simbul and her advisory council but have as little to do

with the outside world as possible. Those who get to know the

people of the Yuirwood find them to be warm companions and

loyal friends. This is rare, however, since the half-elves hide

in the deep woods and do not confront strangers unless pressed

by need or circumstance.

The Yuirwood is a temperate deciduous forest, with milder

winters than typical of a land at this latitude. In the spring

and  summer,  it  is  a  sweltering  tangle  of  brush  and  dense

thickets, virtually impassable to anyone who doesnt know

its ways. A low but rugged spine of forest-covered hills runs

the  length  of  the  peninsula,  and  from  these  well-watered

highlands innumerable streams descend to the coastal lands,

although few are large enough to be termed rivers. Game is

plentiful but wary, as dangerous beasts and monstrous pred-

ators hunt through the green gloom. Few truly malevolent

creatures haunt the forest, but foul-tempered beasts such as

boars or monstrous spiders are every bit as dangerous to the

unwary traveler.

Strange enchantments and old, strong magic are thick in

the Yuirwood. The ancient star elves were masters of power-

ful magic, and they left behind two legacies that continue to

be useful. First, the Yuirwood is impenetrable to detection and

scrying magic. Attempts to pierce the Yuirwoods leafy canopy

reveal the wood, but thats it. They cannot reveal any specific

location, nor can they magically locate or track anyone under

its  boughs.  The  subject  is  not  shielded  in  any  wayit  just

seems not to be there, or anywhere else, at all. Over the cen-

turies, this phenomenon has served Aglarond well, since ene-

mies who inspect the place magically find nothing to report.

Second, the Yuirwood is littered with ruins, remnants of the

great elven society that once called this land home. These are

wonderful places for treasure seekers, but the most amazing

ruins are the circles of menhirs, standing stone monuments

carved in an ancient Elven dialect. The magic of these circles

has faded with the strength of the Yuirwood itself, but there

is some power left in them.

The menhir circles, many of which are nearly swallowed by

the forests undergrowth, form a network of portals that can

be activated by those who know their secret. This knowledge

is guarded by an elite group of half-elven druids and rangers

known as the Masters of the Yuirwood. (For more about this

organization, see Chapter 3: Prestige Classes.) Using these cir-

cles, they can quickly transport themselves and their friends

from one point in the Yuirwood to another instantaneously.

Menhir circles sometimes trigger themselves by the light of

a full moon, and they are frequently employed by the Yuir-

woods fey folk on these nights.

Any of these portals can connect to any other menhir circle

within the Yuirwood, but never beyondat least not inten-

tionally. When not triggered by a Master of the Yuirwood,

treat these stone circles as malfunctioning portals. (See Chap-

ter 2: Magic in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting

for details.)

SILDYUIR

More than two thousand years ago, the depths of the Yuir-

wood held the realm of Yuireshanyaar, home to the reclusive

star, or mithral, elves. Faced with aggressive human settlers

along the Wizards Reach (most from Old Unther) carving

out lands of their own from the ancient forest, the star elves

decided to withdraw from Faern. Their High Mages forged

a  forestwide  network  of  stone  circles  and  then  worked  a

mighty spell through the standing stones that created a demi-

plane  for  the  star  elves  to  call  their  own.  Most  departed

Faern at that time.

Sildyuir is a plane of eldritch beauty, a land of perpetual

twilight illuminated by a host of glittering stars. It extends

100

AGLAROND

about as far as the forests borders, and like the Yuirwood,

is  an  unbroken  expanse  of  deep  green  dells  and  hidden

brooks. The star elves raised great glass citadels for them-

selves and live there still, masters of song magic and lords

of this fey realm.

If you are using the Manual of the Planes, Sildyuir has the

following properties.

Light gravity.

Flowing Time: Two days on the Material Plane equal one

day in Sildyuir.

Finite Size: Sildyuir is coterminous with the Yuirwood.

Alterable Morphic. Objects remain constant unless affected

by physical force or magic.

No elemental or energy traits.

Strongly  neutral-aligned:  Intelligence,  Wisdom,  and

Charisma-based  checks  take  a  2  penalty  for  nonneutral

creatures; 4 for beings with two nonneutral components

in their alignment.

Enhanced Magic: Spells with the sonic descriptor are em-

powered and heightened by two levels in Sildyuir.

The ancient menhir circles of the Yuirwood hold portals lead-

ing to Sildyuir, although most are keyed to function only for

star elves. The Ethereal and Shadow Planes are not cotermi-

nous with the demiplane, so spells using ethereal or shadow ef-

fects do not work there, but the Astral Plane is accessible.

Sildyuir has been under assault by a race of alien sorcer-

ers of great power for several centuries now. The nilshais, na-

tives of some distant, horrible reality, stumbled across the

existence of the demiplane long ago, and they seek to invade

Sildyuir and subvert it to their own twisted purposes. (See

the Nilshai entry in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East.) Each

incursion is more difficult to fend off, and large portions of

the realm have been poisoned by the nilshais alien sorcery.

From  these  corrupted  regions  horrid,  unliving  spawn

emerge to haunt the silver woods and terrorize the citadels

of  the  star  elves.  Some  among  the  mithral  elves  counsel

abandoning  their  extraplanar  home  and  returning  to  the

Yuirwood,  while  others  argue  for  seeking  help  from  their

kinfolk in Aglaronds forests.

THE SUNGLADE

The Sunglade is a clearing in the center of the Yuirwood. It

resembles any meadow, except for the two concentric circles

of menhirs standing here. Long ago ensorceled, the area is im-

pervious to the ravages of time: Its grasses are well tended and

the  rocks  are  free  from  vines  or  moss,  despite  being  undis-

turbed for untold centuries.

The outer circle of menhirs is the tallest of the two, the

rocks standing nearly 20 feet high. They are carved with an-

cient Espruar runes dedicating each stone to one member of

the  Seldarine,  the  elven  pantheon.  The  stones  of  the  inner

circle are a mere 6 feet tall. These are carved in the same style

as the others but are dedicated to the forgotten pantheon of

the folk who lived in the Yuirwood even before the star elves.

Most  menhir  circle  portals in  the  Yuirwood  only  transport

someone to the nearest such portal, but the Sunglades portal

is special. Those who use it can transport directly to any of the

Yuirwoods portals.

People of Aglarond

Two  different  peoples  inhabit  Aglarond:  those  who  live

along the coast and those who live beneath the trees. The

shore  dwellers  are  predominantly  descended  from  the

humans of old Velprin, while the folk of the Yuirwood are

mostly half-elves. The two cultures have learned to live and

work beside each other over the years, sometimes together

but most often in parallel, each ignoring the other. Agla-

ronds humans prefer to work and live along the coast, while

those with elven blood choose to remain hidden in their an-

cestral woods, so there is little reason for the two cultures

to  interact.  Also,  neither  has  something  that  the  other  is

ready to kill for, and so peace has endured ever since King

Brindor first donned his crown.

The geography of the land has made this strange symbio-

sis possible. Its isolation means that threats come from only

one  direction:  Thay.  This  single  threat  has  been  a  unifying

force: If the people of Aglarond werent willing to stand to-

gether, they would surely die alone. With no current threat

from Thay, some feel the time is ripe for dividing the nation.

Ambitious human merchants and nobles dream of logging the

Yuirwood, while the more elitist half-elves hope to shift the

kingdoms balance of power away from the teeming human

cities and back to the old elven forests. Fortunately, Aglarond

has been blessed with rulers of unusual personal vision and

wisdom, and under the governance of House Olssyne (and

more recently, the Simbul) these bitter divisions have rarely

given rise to acts of open rebellion.

Races and Cultures

The humans of Aglarond are descended primarily from the

people who settled Altumbel, Thesk, and the Wizards Reach

ten  to  fifteen  centuries  ago.  Most  of  these  folk  were  Ches-

sentans, Chondathans, and Damarans, but with the passage of

time, these cultures have blended into a unique national iden-

tity. Aglarondans have a reputation as honest and hardwork-

ing,  slow  to  make  friends  but  quick  to  come  to  their  aid.

Despite this, they enjoy raucous revelry during their off-hours.

Aglarondan beer and liquor is brewed for potency rather than

taste, and the inhabitants take advantage of this fact as often

as possible.

In the early years of the nation, humans and half-elves har-

bored mutual resentment, and echoes of these old divisions

still resound. The two cultures tolerated each others company

only  grudgingly,  and  every  meeting  of  the  Royal  Council

threatened to dissolve into chaos without the strong guiding

hand of the monarch. Today, open racial strife is a thing of

the past. Most of those humans who refused to share the land

101

AGLAROND

with the half-elves left for the western part of the peninsula,

settling in either Altumbel or the Fang. Neither region has

much  of  a  sayif  anyin  Aglarondan  politics  or  culture

these days.

Human  Aglarondans  are  sturdy,  dark-haired  people  with

brown or blue eyes and ruddy skin from regular exposure to

the  elements.  The  men  average  about  58  tall,  while  the

women stand around 52. Aglarondan half-elves, descended

from humans and wild elves, have coppery skin, sometimes

with a greenish tinge, with black or blond hair. Their ears show

a subtle elven point, and their eyes tend to be gold-flecked and

wise. Aglarondans of both races are stoic by nature and harbor

a deep love for the woods and shores of their peninsula. Most

take any chance they can get to hike or travel along the rocky

coast  or  the  eaves  of  the  Yuirwood,  although  few  without

elven blood find the forests depths comforting.

Aglaronds half-elves include both wary foresters, living as

simple, nomadic hunters in the heart of the Yuirwood, and cos-

mopolitan city-dwellers living alongside humans in shoreside

towns. Most fall somewhere between these two extremes: They

live under the forests canopy but are schooled in the ways of

the outside world; they treasure their own culture while rec-

ognizing those of others. They participate in governing their

nation, because if they fail to moderate the commerce and ex-

pansion  of  their  human  neighbors,  open  strife  between  the

races may one day return to Aglarond.

Life and Society

Aglarondans  prefer  to  live  alone  and  in  peace,  but  theyve

rarely been given that opportunity. The rest of Faern does

not think much of the peninsula nation (if they think of the

place at all) but the same cant be said of the Red Wizards of

Thay. Before the recent cessation of hostilities, Aglarond lived

under the constant threat of invasion by the zulkirs, who saw

the peninsula as the first stepping-stone in their ongoing cam-

paign toward world domination.

Despite this, the outside world rarely touched Aglarondans

who werent part of the nations well-trained military force.

While not ignorant of foreign affairs, most Aglarondans chose

not to be affected by distant events. The humans quietly fished

the Sea of Fallen Stars and tended the broad fields and pas-

tures  between  the  shore  and  the  trees.  The  elves  harvested

natures bounty beneath the Yuirwoods leaves.

Coastal and arboreal Aglarondans have differing attitudes

toward magic. Those who live under the trees have a healthy

respect for and appreciation of magic. Those who dont are

fearful of all things magical, especially if they come from out-

side the country, an attitude likely rooted in generations of

trouble with Thay. Even native Aglarondan spellcasters are

regarded with suspicion until they have demonstrated their

trustworthiness.

The Simbul is aware of the coastal attitude to magic. She

personally  takes  in  citizens  who  display  a  talent  for  spell-

casting and arranges for their schooling in the art. The most

promising  she  instructs  herself.  These  spellcasters  are

known as the Simbuls Hands. Once they are ready, the Simbul

scatters her students as both ambassadors and spies through-

out the wider world.

ECONOMY

Aglaronds economy is traditionally self-contained and self-

sufficient.  The  recent  peace  with  Thay  has  made  the  ports

more  open  every  day.  While  the  people  here  still  have  few

needs from the outside world, they are happy to open up new

markets for their goods.

Aglaronds main exports are grain, gems, copper, iron, tex-

tiles, and produce, as well as lumber milled from trees fallen

throughout the Yuirwood and cleared out by the half-elves.

The most commonly exported gemstones are the black pearls

that divers harvest off the northern and eastern coasts. These

are highly prized in distant lands, as is the Aglarondan blood

wine favored by the half-elves.

The nation has no merchant fleet to speak of, although a

number of noble merchants own a ship or two. Most goods

that come in and out of Aglarond are carried in Impilturan

or  Sembian  vessels,  and  foreign  merchants  maintain  ware-

houses and mercantile emporiums in large cities such as Vel-

printalar and Furthinghome.

LAW AND ORDER

The people of Aglarond follow a simple set of laws that pro-

scribe most acts of violence against people or property. The

local ruler settles all matters of justice, often through puni-

tive fines, unless someone has been hurt or killed. There is

no national police force, but any officer in Aglaronds army

can  enforce  the  laws  of  the  land  and  apprehend  anyone

breaking them. Technically, anyone can appeal a local sen-

tence to the Royal Council or even the Simbul, but in prac-

tice, this rarely happens.

The  written  laws  are  kept  in  the  library  of  the  Royal

Council. However, they are often misunderstood, so local of-

ficials often apply common sense to any situation. If the city

watch believe an action to be a crime, they treat it as such.

One  universal  law  is  compulsory  enlistment  in  the  army,

served when an Aglarondan reaches the age of majority. Ser-

vice is at least one year, but many youths choose to serve for

several. Many conscripts are assigned to local militias and

garrisons and never serve in the distant border fortresses of

Emmech or Glarondar.

DEFENSE AND WARCRAFT

Aglarond  has  often  been  a  country  at  war  but  is  not  a

nation of soldiers. The Aglarondan fighting force consists

of  three  small  armies,  almost  all  of  which  are  stationed

along the border between their home and Thay. The Army

of  the  Green  Drake  consists  of  4,000  troops  stationed  at

Glarondar Keep and the Watchwall, while the Army of the

Lion numbers 1,500 soldiers in Emmech. An additional 500

soldiers garrison Velprintalar, and the Simbuls navy (a fleet

102

AGLAROND

of a dozen warships, crewed by about 1,000 sailors) is based

there as well.

While there are only 6,000 troops on the Simbuls payroll,

the farmers, hunters, and fishers of the land are ready to fight.

In  times  of  war,  the  number  of  available  troops  can  easily

swell to 30,000 or more. Invaders who reach Aglaronds cities

can expect to fight against every able-bodied man and woman

in  the  region.  As  residents  of  a  peninsula,  the  Aglarondans

have few places to run.

Aglarondan  soldiers  are  mostly  infantry  armed  with

bows,  pikes,  and  swords.  About  15%  of  their  forces  are

mounted,  including  an  elite  guard  of  about  a  hundred

griffonriders  stationed  at  strategic  points  around  the

country. These elite units are normally used as scouts and

messengers rather than in open battle. They are too precious

to risk unless absolutely necessary.

Despite being surrounded by water on three sides, Aglarond

has a small navy. To reach its cities, a fleet from Thay would

have to circumnavigate the entire peninsula, well out past the

cape of Altumbel and the archipelago of the Thousand Swords.

Thus. the Simbuls ships are primarily intended for pirate-chas-

ing and spend most of their time at sea patrolling the west-

ern coasts. Aglaronds army uses small coastboats, shallow,

cheap boats like long canoes propelled by oars and a lateen-

rigged sail. These can move up and down rivers as well as along

the coast and are particularly useful for hit-and-run attacks

against invaders.

The  half-elves  of  the  Yuirwood  have  an  elite  corps  of

rangers known as foresters. These men and women are loyal

to the crown, but they are more of a police force than a mil-

itary unit. They patrol the edges of the Yuirwood, keeping

an eye out for invaders or even travelers who have lost their

way. They also help keep the peace between nonnatives and

the  more  xenophobic  half-elves  who  live  in  the  forests

deepest parts.

RELIGION

Aglarondans  are  not  particularly  devout.  The  typical  Agla-

rondan believes the gods are not directly involved in ordinary

daily events and does not pay them much mind. Aglarondan

farmers favor Chauntea, while fishers pay tribute to Valkur,

patron of sailors, and Selne, who is in charge of the stars by

which they navigate. Half-elves often worship forest gods like

Mielikki and Silvanus or any members of the Seldarine, par-

ticularly Rillifane Rallathil.

Adventurers

In the past, adventurers have passed by Aglarond for what

they thought were richer lands, ignoring the dozens of ancient

ruins scattered throughout the Yuirwood in favor of better-

known locations. With the recent influx of trade in this part

of the world, rumors about the hidden treasures of Aglarond

are spreading.

The people of Aglarond arent hospitable toward adven-

turers. As the local saying goes, Its better to leave some

stones unturned. Besides the coast-dwellers traditional sus-

picion of spellcasters, folk here believe that poking around

in ancient ruins can only lead to trouble. Theres a reason

why such places have been undisturbed for so long, after all.

The  people  of  the  Yuirwood  are  no  less  suspicious  of  in-

truders tromping through their lands. Any foreigner is a po-

tential Thayan spy and is generally treated accordingly until

proven otherwise.

Politics and Power

Ever since half-elves prevailed in the racial wars that tore the

country apart over three hundred years ago, a monarch has

ruled the people of Aglarond, starting with the legendary King

Brindor.  The  Simbul  has  been  Aglaronds  queen  for  a  little

over fifty years, and during that time she has built up an in-

formal hierarchy of trusted officers, civic-minded merchants,

and  noble  allies  who  serve  as  a  civil  administration.  The

Simbuls  cult  of  personality  has  drastically  increased  the

monarchs ability to get things done, but she has so far neg-

lected to formalize any of her appointments or arrangements,

so her death or disappearance would signal the end of effec-

tive centralized rule in the country, at least for a time.

A  Royal  Council  of  powerful  nobles  and  representatives

from  participating  Aglarondan  communities  advises  the

monarch. Not all take advantage of the opportunity, prefer-

ring instead to chart their own course, distinct from that of

Aglarond as a whole. The Simbul keeps her own counsel, de-

spite what her advisors may have to say. They are not often

privy to her larger plans for guiding the lands destiny. In-

stead, they handle the daily affairs of the nation. The coun-

cil  numbers  thirty-three  members,  some  of  whom  are  the

designated representatives of cities and towns, and others of

whom are nobles with hereditary seats. About a dozen coun-

cil members are close allies of the Simbul and part of her ad-

ministration, but a handful oppose her rule and constrain her

ability to do as she wishes.

Aglaronds ruler has traditionally chosen his or her own

successor. Often this is the monarchs heir, but the last few

rulers have not been related by blood. Since the Simbul has

no children of her own, its anyones guess as to whom she

might  name  to  follow  her.  Given  her  penchant  for  disap-

pearing  for  months  on  end,  the  Simbul  has  acceded  to  the

councils request to tentatively name a successor. She hasnt

been so foolish as to make public the identity of this indi-

vidual, however. Instead, she has given magically sealed en-

velopes  to  several  trustworthy  Aglarondans  (including  her

High Steward), to be opened only upon conclusive proof of

her  death.  On  several  occasions  in  the  past,  various  of  the

Simbuls sisters impersonated her during some of her absences

(at  her  request,  and  with  her  later  support  of  their  ruling

decisions), so proof of her death may not be readily accepted

by Aglarondans.

AGLAROND

Government

Loose is a generous description of the governments of Agla-

rondan towns and cities. They are chiefly concerned with only

one thing: staving off invasion by Thay. In many ways, Agla-

rond is not a nation so much as a defensive leagueone reason

the  people  of  Altumbel  and  many  of  the  cities  along  the

nations southern coast consider themselves independent. With

the rest of Aglarond between them and Thay, they are con-

fident of weathering any Thayan storm.

A lady or lord governs each Aglarondan community. Hered-

itary  nobles  hold  many  of  these  positions,  while  others  are

awarded by acclamation (whether given willingly, extracted by

blackmail or force, or taken simply because no one else wants

the thankless job). The chief duty of an Aglarondan lord is to

represent the community on the Royal Council. Some eschew

this to set themselves up as petty lords answerable to no one,

but most take their duties seriously.

The  Royal  Council  meets  once  a  month,  so  local  rulers

spend a great deal of time traveling to Velprintalar and back.

Some live in the capital most of the time and come back every

other month or so to report whats happening in the court and

to check on events at home.

Those who have earned the Simbuls trust carry out most

of Aglaronds administration. While the Simbul does not in-

tervene in the selection or accession of council members, she

is not above dispatching one of her apprentices or elite cap-

tains to act as her surrogate in a town, thus circumventing

troublesome individuals. Some view the Simbuls willingness

to ignore the council as tyranny and worry about the prece-

dent she is setting.

Enemies

Aglaronds  relative  isolation  should  mean  potential  enemies

pass it by, but that hasnt been the case. A number of differ-

ent organizations would love to see the downfall of the Simbul

and her people. Four of the most prominent are described here.

THE RED WIZARDS

The  Red  Wizards  of  Thay  are  by  far  the  most  consistent

thorn in Aglaronds side. They have tried to invade at least

ten  times  since  King  Brindor  began  his  rule,  and  three  of

those attempts have come during the Simbuls reign alone.

For  more  details  on  the  Red  Wizards  and  their  plots,  see

Chapter  11:  Thay  (or  the  Lords  of  Darkness  campaign  ac-

cessory, if you have that book).

The Thayans have chosen commercial expansion over mil-

itary  conquest,  but  that  doesnt  mean  they  no  longer  covet

Aglarond. Their desire to conquer this land stems from two

reasons. First, the zulkirs believe they cant attack other parts

of the world while leaving their western flank exposed. And

while Aglarond may not have much of a navy, the Red Wiz-

ards would gladly clear-cut the Yuirwood to build one. They see

Aglarond as the perfect base for further advances, providing

Thay  not  only  the  needed  routes  and  resources,  but  also  a

buffer against any retaliation from the western powers, which

would have to fight through the peninsula to reach Thay.

The current Thayan plan is to cozy up as close to the Ag-

larondans as the Simbul will permit. The zulkirs hope that the

Simbul will be impressed by the benefits of trade and allow

Thayan enclaves in Aglarondan cities. Then, when the time is

right, the Red Wizards can attack Aglarond from within.

CULT OF THE DRAGON

The  Cult  of  the  Dragon  has  a  secret  cell  in  the  village  of

Glarondar.  These  evil  souls  venerate  Nartheling,  the  fang

dragon  of  Umbergoth,  and  hope  to  persuade  the  wyrm  to

become a dracolich. Small bands of cultists regularly make the

pilgrimage from Glarondar to the top of the icy peak, bring-

ing the dragon news of the town and opportunities to enrich

itself by providing information on caravans and patrols.

The  current  leader  of  the  Glarondan  cell  is  a  half-elven

necromancer by the name of Winn Kardzen (CE male half-

elf  Nec7).  He  is  plotting  an  attack  against  the  fortress  at

Glarondar by reanimating corpses in the Umber Marshes to

simulate a Thayan attack. This is designed to draw the patrols

from the Watchwall, giving Nartheling a chance to ravage the

town while the army is off chasing decoys.

THE NILSHAIS

Sinister creatures from some far dimension, the nilshais are

alien  sorcerers  who  have  constructed  dark  gateways  into

Sildyuir, the extraplanar refuge of the star elves. Worse yet,

some of the elven realms portals linking it to the Yuirwood

have fallen into the hands of the nilshais, and the invaders

have  dispatched  marauding  bands  to  scout  out  the  ancient

forest and learn more about the world beyond. The nilshais are

contemptuous of Material Plane life and hunger for new lands

to conquer; it is only a matter of time before they gather their

strength for a major incursion, bringing madness and vile sor-

cery to the green haven of the Yuirwood.

THE SONS OF HOAR

The  Sons  of  Hoar  are  a  newly  formed  group  that  aims  to

peacefully remove the Simbul from her throne and install a

normal person on the throne. In their parlance, normal

means a high-born human noble of Velprins old line, prefer-

ably one who isnt a spellcaster. This group plays on Aglaron-

dans  natural  distrust  of  magic,  even  that  used  by  their

neighbors. They want a real hero on the throne, one of the

people, not someone catapulted to power through pacts with

unnatural forces.

The Sons of Hoar have great support in the nominally in-

dependent regions of Aglarond, particularly in Altumbel and

the Fang. While some of the Sons are cynical racists acting out

of naked ambition, they have also attracted misguided ideal-

ists to their cause. The cold, hard core of the secret society

106

AGLAROND

plans a well-orchestrated coup to seize power over their home-

land, while the rank and file believe their leaders are honor-

able.  The  leaders  of  the  Sons  are  carefully  feeling  out  the

appointed rulers of every major settlement in the nation, con-

vincing them to side with them or step aside for someone who

will. They call for the oft-absent Simbul to give up her throne.

When she does, they plan to install one of their own as ruler

over a human-dominated Aglarond.

Cities and Sites

The coast of Aglarond is dotted with dozens of fishing com-

munities, but few are substantial. Most of the larger settle-

ments are along the northern coastal plain. These include the

cities of Velprintalar, Furthinghome, and Emmech. The one

major  exception  is  Glarondar,  which  rose  up  around  the

fortress  at  the  near  end  of  the  Watchwall.  Delthuntle  and

Laothkund, on the southern coast, are independent cities of

the Wizards Reach and not under the Simbuls rule. All these

cities are populated mostly by humans, but they are also home

to a substantial number of half-elves.

The small settlements of the Yuirwood, on the other hand,

are  almost  exclusively  elven  and  half-elven.  Most  are  not

even permanent, consisting of shelters erected for a season

or  two  and  then  abandoned  when  the  forest  folk  decide  to

move on. The largest of these communities, and one of the

few permanent ones, is Relkaths Foot, the unofficial half-

elven capital.

Delthuntle (LARGE TOWN)

Situated on the southern coast of Aglarond, just to the south

of the cape of Altumbel, Delthuntle is not part of either Agla-

rond or Altumbel. Like the other free cities of the western

Wizards  Reach,  Delthuntle  is  on  generally  friendly  terms

with Aglarond, and its people often think of the Simbul as

their protector as well as Aglaronds. In most cases, if either

side were to ask the other for aid, it would be readily granted.

Pirates founded Delthuntle only two centuries ago. These

were a bloodthirsty lot who raided up and down the Wiz-

ards Reach for decades before deciding the potential gains

no longer outweighed the risks. The citys architecture still

reflects  this  nautical  heritage.  Much  of  its  timber  was

stripped from the original pirates ships, as well as from the

husks  of  unfortunate  boats  that  foundered  on  the  nearby

reefs.  The  people  of  Delthuntle  are  almost  exclusively

human, and they have little if anything to do with the half-

elves of the Yuirwood.

Delthuntles harbor is small and shallow, making it a poor

choice for merchants. Its perfect for fishing, though, and

this is how the vast majority of the people here make their

living. Delthuntles ruler is known as the Master of Pilots,

a position handed down from one generation to the next by

popular acclamation. A Master who is ready to retire calls

a town meeting and makes the announcement, traditionally

putting forward a nominee to take over. Others can be sug-

gested by anyone, but its rare for any but the favored choice

to win.

Emmech (SMALL CITY)

This town at the mouth of the River Umber hosts a fortress

that houses the Army of the Lion, which numbers about one-

third of Aglaronds soldiers. The Army of the Lion is the first

line of defense against Thayan invaders intent on forcing the

Tannath  Gap.  Despite  the  current  truce  between  Thay  and

Aglarond, the leader of the soldiers here, Lord Gante Demelin

(LG male half-elf Ftr14), keeps his troops prepared for any

eventuality.  He  has  seen  too  many  Thayan  tricks  over  the

years  to  trust  the  Red  Wizards,  although  the  Simbul  has

guardedly accepted their offer of peace. It hasnt been that

long since the last Thayan invasion.

Emmech was originally little more than a campsite set up

by hangers-on who served the needs of those inside the grim

stone fortress. Today, it is a large, ramshackle town with a mil-

itary air, although the tents have been traded in for buildings.

Most homes in Emmech are made of stones hauled up from

the coast, typical of architecture in the cities along the rocky

shore. Such building supplies are plentiful, and they provide

good protection against both the elements and the few Thayan

invaders who make it this far into the land.

Fortress Emmech is a simple, gray affair squatting atop a

low  hill  in  the  center  of  town,  overlooking  the  river.  Two

strong towers on either side of the Umber hold a great river-

chain that can be raised to bar the passage of ships; the chain

lies on the river bottom most of the time. The fortress bris-

tles with towers and parapets. Every wall is crenellated, and

the commander stocks enough supplies to hold off a six-month

siege. In times of trouble, the townspeople leave their belong-

ings behind and move within the fortresss gates.

Furthinghome (METROPOLIS)

Built on the site of one of the first human settlements in what

would become Aglarond, Furthinghome (population 40,643)

is  one  of  the  largest  cities  in  the  land,  second  only  to  Vel-

printalar itself. Lord Fardyl Albin (LN male human Ari16),

a descendant of the old royal line of Velprin, rules the city.

He is a member of Aglaronds Royal Council but prefers to

leave the affairs of the kingdom to the Simbul, concentrating

on keeping things as theyve always been in his city and cater-

ing to the interests of its powerful merchants (many with sim-

ilarly noble pedigrees).

Ships from many nearby nations continually scud in and

out of Furthinghomes port. The harbor is smaller and shal-

lower  than  that  of  Velprintalar,  so  only  merchants  with

smaller vessels can use it. The people of Furthinghome are

hungry for exotic imports from other lands and export goods

of all sorts to the rest of Faern, including fish, produce, a

limited amount of Yuirwood timber, and the famous herbs and

flowers grown in the citys numerous greenhouses.

Furthinghome is built in and around a circular road that ex-

tends from the port into the rest of the town. Near the port,

in the center of the business district, is a large, cobblestoned

public park known as Old Furthing, which is the social and fi-

nancial  center  of  the  city.  Merchant  princes  and  magnates

meet here to arrange trades and broker deals affecting the for-

tunes  of  the  entire  kingdom.  Most  of  the  buildings  are  ex-

tremely old, built of stone and weathered wood. As in the rest

of Aglarond, there is little new wooden construction.

Furthinghomes  eastern  hills  are  blighted  by  one  of  the

few truly impoverished areas to be found in Aglarond. Gen-

erations ago, settlers driven off from the eaves of the Yuir-

wood  came  here  and  raised  a  sprawling  shantytown  of

lean-tos and thatch huts called Furthingharrow. While the

lords and merchants of Furthinghome live in grand manors

overlooking the sea, the poor folk of Furthingharrow scrab-

ble to make a living by hiring themselves out as dockwork-

ers, laborers, and drivers. The slums have become a center of

human racist sentiment, since most of the people here blame

the elves for their lack of prosperity. They believe it takes

elven blood to get ahead in Aglarond, and the Sons of Hoar

have found the warrens of Furthingharrow a fruitful ground

for recruiting to their cause.

Furthinghome  is  also  known  as  the  City  of  the  Peacock.

Flocks of the birds roam the countryside, having been brought

here nearly a century ago for a Mulhorandi nobleman by the

name of Lord Ceraut. Since his death, his beautiful estate has

gone to seed, and the peacocks run wild.

Glarondar (SMALL CITY)

Glarondar isnt a true city, although it is home to more people

than  all  but  a  handful  of  communities  in  Aglarond.  More

than two thousand troops are stationed here at the end of the

Watchwall, in a fortress of black stone built by the same galeb

duhrs who fashioned the massive wall for King Brindor. An-

other  two  thousand  soldiers  guard  the  Watchwall  itself,

stretching another thirty miles to the north. This is the Army

of the Green Drake, and it is also the largest garrison ever

posted on this frontGlarondar and the Watchwall are burst-

ing at the seams.

Glarondar Keep is made of a nearly indestructible, shiny,

black stone resembling magically enhanced obsidian, giving

rise  to  its  nickname:  the  Night  Fortress.  A  small  town  of

1,500 or so people sits in the shadow of the great keep, be-

tween the massive structure and the Yuirwood. Most of the in-

habitants here are half-elves, many of whom migrated from

the wood to start anew in the open air. The structures here are

mostly  made  of  weathered  wood  harvested  from  trees  that

have naturally fallen in the forest.

AGLAROND

Relkaths Foot (SMALL CITY)

This is the largest permanent settlement of half-elves in the

Yuirwood. To many of the localsthose who believe in such

civilized things as citiesthis is the capital of the Yuirwood,

much as Velprintalar is the capital of the encompassing nation

of Aglarond. Princess Blindelsyn Olssyne (NG female half-

elf Ari6/Sor6) is a distant descendant of King Brindor him-

self.  Her  brother,  Prince  Branelwyr  (NG  male  half-elf

Ari3/Rgr6) is the citys current representative on the Royal

Council and rules in his sisters absence.

Relkaths Foot is built around four tall, majestic trees that

rise more than 100 feet out of the forests thick canopy into

the open light. These are said to have sprung from the buried

foot of an ancient god, Relkath of the Numberless Branches.

Relkath, along with other mysterious powers who predate the

elves, is said to be sleeping beneath the forests soil, someday

to awaken when the people of the Yuirwood need their ancient

gods again.

Many inhabitants of Relkaths Foot live on the ground, con-

stantly on the lookout for invaders or strangers of any kind.

The rest make their homes on wooden platforms in the massive

trees and the surrounding forest, all strung together by a com-

plex  network  of  ropes  and  suspension  bridges.  Outsiders  are

rarely permitted in the boughs of the trees. A merchants square

is set up on the ground near the four trees, and a pair of inns

flank the town to the north and south. Travelers are welcome

as long as they respect the natives and their way of life.

Relkaths Foot is more a center of barter, celebration, and

lorekeeping than of commerce and industry. The local hunters

bring their game and furs here to sell, usually bartering for

needed goods rather than hoarding the Simbuls coinage. Many

skilled woodworkers, including some of the kingdoms finest

bowyers, keep workshops in and around the town. The Mas-

ters of the Yuirwood have their headquarters here. Just out-

side the city stands a menhir circle portal that leads directly

to the Sunglade. From there, the Masters can reach anywhere

else in the forest in less than a day.

The rangers of Relkaths Footmany of whom are masters

of  the  Yuirwoodare  legendary.  Human  rangers  from  all

over  Faern  journey  here  to  learn  from  these  seasoned

foresters.

THE ROYAL HALL

Princess Blindelsyn spends much of her time here, overseeing

the work of keeping Relkaths Foot running smoothly. It is an

amazing  structure,  made  entirely  of  living  wood  magically

fashioned into floors, walls, windows, and even a leafy throne

covered with everblooming flowers.

The Royal Hall is situated at the top of the tallest of the

four trees. The only thing higher in the entire region is the

aerie of a family of song dragonstwo mature adults and two

young. They live here among the half-elves, and each party is

sworn to protect the other. The half-elves cover the ground,

while the dragons watch the skies.

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

There are two excellent inns in Relkaths Foot: the Green Man

(to the north) and the Taproot (to the south). Both are fine

places, although outsiders are more common at the Taproot,

which boasts a first-class alehouse as well as private rooms. The

Green Man has only a single common room.

The two inns often hold competitions between their regu-

lar patrons. These include tests of forester skills, such as climb-

ing greased poles or firing arrows at a moving target through

a stand of trees. Outlanders are welcome to join but rarely do

well against the local experts.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Many members of the elven pantheon are traditionally rep-

resented in Relkaths Foot. Rillifane Rallathil, the elven deity

of woodlands and nature, is held in especially high regard, and

the House of the Leaflord, in a tree-shaded glen a mile from

the town, is one of the largest of Rillifanes temples anywhere

on Faern. Ilmiryl Oakheart (NG male half-elf Drd17 of Ril-

lifane), the ranking druid of the Yuirwood, watches over his

domain from this place. Smaller shrines to Corellon Larethian

and Silvanus also exist.

Spandeliyon (LARGE TOWN)

The people of Altumbel are almost entirely human and no-

tably xenophobic, far more so than their neighbors in Agla-

rond  proper.  They  live  almost  exclusively  in  small  fishing

villages scattered along the western shores like seashells. The

one exception is the capital, Spandeliyon, the City of Pirates.

Spandeliyon  is  little  more  than  a  cluster  of  low-slung

wooden buildings made gray from constant exposure to the

harsh winds and rains that lash the lands. The architecture

here is more eclectic than in the rest of Aglarond, which isnt

saying  much.  The  regular  influx  of  retired  pirates  along

with fisherfolk from all across the Sea of Fallen Stars would

seem to give the place a more cosmopolitan flavor. The truth,

however, is that people come here to be left aloneor at least

to get away from their former lives. When facing an outside

threat, though, the people of Spandeliyon are thick as thieves.

Spandeliyon is governed by a ruling council of those mer-

chants who chose to buy a voice in governing the city. Simi-

lar councils run most of Altumbels towns, although in some

places,  hereditary  nobles  are  born  to  hold  seats.  The  First

Consul of Spandeliyon also sits on the High Council of Al-

tumbel, which is composed of representatives from all of Al-

tumbels  towns  and  villages.  In  practice,  the  High  Council

never meets except under the most dire of emergencies, and

even then is incapable of agreeing on a course of action. About

half of the delegates follow the lead of the First Consul, while

the rest refuse to go along and return to their homes.

THE COUNCIL HALL

Velprintalar (METROPOLIS)

This shining city is the crown jewel of the peninsula and one

of the most beautiful and striking cities of all Faern. Over

65,000 souls call this place home, as does the Simbul herself.

Formerly the seat of the human kings of old Velprin, Vel-

printalar has been the capital of united Aglarond since King

Brindors time.

Velprintalar is the only major port in Aglarond proper. Its

harbor is deep and well sheltered from the sea. Ships of any

size sail or row in and out of the wide bay all day long. Vel-

printalars  docks  are  usually  crammed  with  merchant  ships

from Impiltur and Sembia, jockeying for space next to the

smaller fishing boats. A large naval yard dominates the east

end of the harbor, home to the graceful, whitewashed warships

of the queens royal navy. Commerce is booming in Aglaronds

largest city, for peace with Thay has brought no small pros-

perity. In fact, the population of the city has nearly doubled

over the past decade.

Velprintalars green hills rise quickly as one travels inland

from the waters edge, forcing buildings closer and closer to-

gether on precariously steep slopes. Its not uncommon to see

new stories built atop the old ones. The architectural styles of

the different floors dont always match up, giving the city a

unique patchwork look.

THE SIMBULS PALACE

The Simbul lives in a graceful palace of pale green Mulho-

randi stone, perched atop a hill overlooking the harbor and

city below. This place was built several generations ago on the

site of the original place. Commissioned by King Brindor him-

self,  that  beautiful  wooden  structure  burned  to  the  ground

during an attack by a red dragon whose corpse remains at the

bottom of the harbor.

Over the years, the various rulers of Aglarond have woven

layer after layer of magical protections and conveniences into

the place. The Simbul herself has made many contributions to

this legacy, making this the safest and most marvelous build-

ing on the entire peninsula. The Simbul, though, is often

not here. Her steward, a wise lord named Nerrol Hamastyl

(LG male half-elf Rgr6/Pal6) governs the Royal Council and

serves as regent in her absence, often under the command of

one  of  her  four  apprentices:  Phaeldara  (CN  human  female

Sor16/Wiz8),  The  Masked  One  (CN  human  female  Sor14/

Rog9), Thorneira Thalance (LN human female Sor12/Wiz6),

and Evenyl Nathtalond (NG human female Sor11/Wiz5). The

commander of the Simbuls Guard, High Captain Hovor Sea-

wind (CG male half-elf fighter 4/rogue 6/Aglarondan griffon-

rider 8), assists the High Steward in his duties.

The Royal Council of Aglarond meets here once a month, usu-

ally during the full moon. Each settlement has the right to

send a representative to the council, but not all take advan-

tage  of  this  opportunity.  Most  council  seats  are  hereditary

titles joined to the holdings of the oldest and most noble lines

of a city or province. The High Steward Nerrol Hamastyl is

the Simbuls representative to the Council most of the time,

although he steps aside on those rare occasions when the queen

of Aglarond chooses to address the Royal Council in person.

The hall is built of weathered wood in the traditional Agla-

rondan style. It was once a simple structure consisting of a

single large meeting room, but over the centuries the council

has added on to it. Today, visitors normally require either a

guide or a map to get around.

Once here, councilors need never leave. There are plenty of

guest rooms, pantries, kitchens, meeting rooms, and so on, all

centered on the main hall. The place is a ghost town when the

council  is  not  in  session,  but  sessions  are  taking  longer  and

longer, often up to a full tenday or more, so the amount of

down time grows shorter and shorter.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Both Chauntea and Selne are popular among the humans of

Aglaronds coast, and large old temples to each deity stand on

the  hills  above  the  city.  The  House  of  the  Four  Moons  is

Selnes temple, a graceful old cathedral of white stone that

gleams like a beacon with silver light beneath the full moon.

The priestesses of Selne maintain regular contact with other

temples of their goddess throughout Faern, and they work

with the Harpers and other groups to promote the advance-

ment of good over evil in their homeland and beyond.

The Green Ladys Keep is Velprintalars temple to Chaun-

tea. Located well inland from the hill-ringed harbor, it is a

low, rambling structure that includes a temple, a civic gran-

ary, and a large fortresslike abbey, home to more than one

hundred monks famed for their potent ale. Greenish in color

and said to include fermented parsley, it is one of the most

popular of the citys many exports, and the monks are work-

ing overtime to meet the increased demand.

OTHER NOTABLE PLACES

The manor house of Lady Mytela Halvasyn is home to an in-

formal  society  started  by  the  long-dead  matriarchs  descen-

dants. The nature of this club is secret, but everyone in town

knows that only wealthy or powerful half-elves are permitted

to join. The reason for this is that the group is dedicated to

expelling the humans from Aglarond.

This  movement,  known  as  the  Society  of  the  Verdant

Arrow, has been growing in strength over the past few years.

Having a frequently absent human rule the country has only

111

AGLAROND

inflamed  the  anger  of  the  societys  members.  The  Verdant

Arrows are directly opposed to the Sons of Hoar, and the more

violent Sons have earmarked prominent Verdant Arrows for

intimidation and harassmentor death.

Griffonheight Keep is the main barracks of the city and the

home of the famed Aglarondan griffonriders. It sits atop a hill

and houses 400 foot soldiers plus a squadron of aerial cavalry.

The keep has been expanded and improved over the past few

years, giving rise to wild rumors about why the Simbul would

increase the military presence in the capital, which has

never come under direct attack by an army since

its founding.

Many attribute the buildup as a

response to the number of Thayan

ships passing through. Actually, the

Simbul is aware of the plans of the Ver-

dant  Arrows  (and  suspects  many  of  the

plots of the Sons of Hoar) and wishes to be

prepared for any eventuality. Secret societies

within the army agree with the senti-

ments  of  one  party  or  the  other,

though,  so  the  soldiers  of  Agla-

rond  may  not  be  reliable.  Once

the  time  comes  to  choose  sides,

they wont all be on the same one.

Sandwiched  between  Narfell  and  Thesk,  the  Great

Dale is considered a vast wilderness by most. The land

is  speckled  with  lonely  farmsteads  and  clanholds,

guarded  by  druids  and  rangers  who  enjoy  their  solitude  and

protect  their  homes  with  a  vengeance.  Few  foreigners  have

reason  to  journey  to  the  Great  Dale,  and  thats  just  how  its

inhabitants like it.

Narfell  and  Damara  bound  the  Great  Dale  to  the  north,

Impiltur  and  the  Easting  Reach  to  the  west,  Thesk  to  the

south, and Rashemen to the east. While a decent road runs the

length of the country (if it can be called that) between the

Rawlinswood and the Forest of Lethyr, it is not a major trade

route. There are few stops along the way, and the residents of

the Great Dale show so little hospitality to strangers that a

popular joke is Theres no room in the dale!

The land here was once part of the ancient Empire of Nar-

fell, although it was originally settled by folk from Jhaam-

dath.  When  Narfell  and  Raumathar  destroyed  each  other

1,500 years ago, the Great Dale was decimated in the fight-

ing and lay virtually empty and wild for centuries. The land

is now a frontier for the populous kingdom of Impiltur to the

west. For generations, Impilturans in search of land and in-

dependence have been trickling eastward, carving out homes

from the Dales wide-open spaces.

Geographic

Overview

Including the great forests that flank the dale itself, the Great

Dale extends from the western end of the Rawlinswood to the

shores of Lake Ashane, a little more than 400 miles from east

113

to west. North to south, the land runs from the north side of

the Rawlinswood down through the Forest of Lethyr to just

shy of the River Flam, just over 300 miles. In all this vast ter-

ritory lives a human population numbering little more than

that of a single great city in other lands, and most of that is

concentrated at the western end of the dale in Uthmere and

the surrounding countryside. There are few settlements in the

central or eastern reaches of the Great Dale, and most people

in those regions live at least a hard days ride from their near-

est neighbor.

Most  of  the  land  between  the  forests  consists  of  rolling

downs, a seemingly endless series of low, heather-grown ridges

steadily climbing as one travels from west to east. The soil is

thin  and  rocky  in  most  spots,  and  few  crops  grow  well  at

higher altitudes. Long ago, ancient glaciers gouged this land

deeply, leaving behind long, snaking moraines and countless

tiny lakes, but scraped the best soil into the low plains near

the Easting Reach and the Forest of Lethyr. The folk of the

eastern dale are mostly goatherds and shepherds, not farmers.

The Great Dales climate is tempered by the proximity of

the Easting Reach, but winters are harsh, while summers are

comparatively cool. The Forest of Lethyr is a mix of conif-

erous and deciduous forest, but the Rawlinswood is a true taiga,

a  northern  pine  forest  with  bitterly  cold  winters  and  cool,

mosquito-plagued summers.

THE GREAT DALE

Major Geographic

Features

The two defining features of the Great Dale are the massive

forests that bound it to either side. The Rawlinswood runs to

the north of the dale from which the land gets its name, and

the  Forest  of  Lethyr  borders  the  south.  The  dale  climbs

steadily  from  west  to  east,  reaching  an  elevation  of  nearly

2,000 feet above sea level at Ashanath.

The Dale

The most prominent feature of the Great Dale is this long,

windswept  gap  between  the  Forest  of  Lethyr  and  the

Rawlinswood. When the world was young, some arm of the

Great  Glacier  scoured  a  path  between  two  slightly  higher

stretches  of  land,  and  since  that  long-ago  time,  the  great

forests have been unable to take root in the vale between.

The Dalesfolk tell other stories to explain the gap; some say

a  great  dragon  burned  a  path  through  one  great  forest,

while others claim that Shaundakul and Silvanus held a con-

test  to  determine  whether  wood  or  wind  would  rule  this

land,  and  that  Auril  the  Frostmaiden  intervened  to  set

winter over both.

Whatever its origin, the gap averages forty to sixty miles

in  width  and  stretches  nearly  250  miles  in  length.  (The

region known as the Great Dale includes the two forests and

is quite a bit larger than the dale itself.) Rumpled ridges of

bare rock rise from its thin soil, growing steeper and more

rugged  toward  the  forests  that  flank  north  and  south.  In

sheltered spots, the topsoil is thick and fertile, but most of

the  land  is  suited  only  for  raising  hardy  livestock  such  as

goats and sheep.

Most of the people of the Great Dale live in the western

reaches of the land, near Uthmere. As one travels east, settle-

ments become fewer and farther between; most folk live on

the edge of the two major forests or just inside their eaves. The

canopy of the trees is so thick, even in the heart of winter,

that almost no light passes through, casting vast portions of

the land in twilight even at the height of the day. While this

also  provides  for  shelter  from  the  rains,  sun,  and  snows,  it

makes for poor farming.

A long roadthe only well-traveled one in the territory

runs from Uthmere all the way to the Cold Road in the east.

Technically called the Great Road, it is known by many names

throughout the region, but most of the areas residents just

refer to it as the Road. Since there arent any other major

roads, its clear which one is meant.

The dale is known for its fierce winter winds. Those farms

and settlements not sheltered by the woodlands are scoured by

harsh west winds that blow down the length of the gap as if

Shaundakul himself were racing along the Great Road.

THE GREAT BARROW

About seventy miles up the Great Road from Uthmere looms

the Great Barrow, a vast dark mound. A number of lesser bar-

rows ring it like cold sentinels, the long brown grasses of their

rounded sides hissing endlessly in a chill north wind that never

dies away completely. No one knows who is interred in the

Great Barrow, or what forgotten people raised it, but stories

say that a cruel human tribe once roamed these lands before

even the rise of Narfell, and that their god-born champion lies

buried here. Naturally, the place is said to be haunted by rest-

less spirits.

A century ago, an Impilturan lord named Elphras mocked

the old stories and raised a small stone keep on a nearby hill,

claiming the barrowfield along with the land for miles about.

Some unknown catastrophe overtook Elphras and his entire

household, for the Impilturan lord, his family, and a keep full

of  guards  and  servants  disappeared  one  cold  night,  leaving

behind an empty and cheerless tower.

VAL-MURTHAG

North and east of Bezentil lies the wreckage of the old fortress

of Val-Murthag, one of the largest Nar ruins not covered by

forest.  This  great  castle  stood  watch  over  the  eastern  ap-

proaches of the Dale, a formidable rampart in the path of any

attack from Raumathar to the east. Val-Murthag was a place

of madness and horror, the spiritual center of the demonic cult

that dominated the dark empires final days, and Raumathari

battlemages visited untold destruction on the place in the final

battle of the two realms. Little of Val-Murthag remains to be

seen, except for sprawling old walls of weathered black stone

that  run  for  miles  across  the  cold  downs  and  the  shattered

stumps of watchtowers amid heaps of battered stone.

The ghosts of Nar demonpriests are said to haunt the ruins,

and most of the Dalesfolk give the place a wide berth.

Firward Mountains

At the northeastern end of the Rawlinswood, hard by Lake

Ashane,  stand  the  Firward  Mountains.  This  range  lies

midway between the Giantspires of Narfell and the northern

Sunrise Mountains of Rashemen. The Firwards are unlike the

forbidding  ranges  of  the  neighboring  lands.  Relatively  low,

they are densely forested to their summits and unusually cold

and snowy in wintertime. Narfell, Rashemen, and the Great

Dale all could claim the Firwards, but the mountains rise be-

tween  the  least  populous  portions  of  all  three  countries,  so

they form an uncontested border between them.

Even in the days of ancient Narfell, the Firwards were not

heavily populated, although some of the kingdoms more pow-

erful  archsummoners  raised  demon-built  fortresses  in  their

cold  isolation.  These  days,  the  Firwards  are  home  to  the

Horned Skulls (a large, fierce tribe of bugbears), bands of frost

giants, and several clans of vicious taers. Beneath their frozen

Forest of Lethyr

The Forest of Lethyr occupies the southern half

of the Great Dale and is a natural boundary

between that land and Thesk. The portion of the

forest  south  of  the  River  Flam  is  considered

Theskian land. The residents of the Great Dale

hardly  notice.  This  area  has  been  constantly

logged  over  the  years,  making  it  the  poor

cousin  of  the  northern  reaches.  Close  to  the

Golden  Way,  these  lands  are  too  near  civi-

lization  for  comfort  in  the  minds  of  druids

and rangers.

The Forest of Lethyr is home to the Nent-

yarch (N male human Drd17/Hie5/Sor6), the

most powerful druid in northeastern Faern.

The Nentyarch leads the Circle of Leth and

their agents, the Nentyar hunters. From his

seat  at  Yeshelmaar,  the  Nentyarch  and  the

druids who serve him defend the forest against

wanton cutting and oversettlement. The Nent-

yarch is also the master of the Rawlinswood,

but two years ago the frenzied hordes of the

Rotting Man stormed Dun-Tharos, his former

seat of power, and drove the Circle of Leth to

the southern forest. Separated by the sparsely

populated valley of the Great Dale, these two

opposing  forces  are  engaged  in  a  mortal

struggle for both woodlands.

The Forest of Lethyr is filled with all sorts

of creatures, but the most prominent ones are

the  treants  who  work  with  their  humanoid

friends  to  protect  the  woods.  Lethyr  is  also

home  to  several  villages  of  secretive  wood

elves,  as  well  as  a  handful  of  volodni  bands.

Human settlements are limited to the forests

southern edges. Spearsmouth Dale is nestled

on the edges of the treeless valley closest to

the  source  of  the  Flam.  The  next  valley  to

the northeast along the forests edge is home

to Mettledale.

FORTRESS NARDER

Like Clymph Tower in the Rawlinswood, this

ruin in the Forest of Lethyr is twisted and evil.

Some buried taint of ancient Narfell lurks

in the dungeons beneath the ivy-grown stones,

poisoning the groundwater and sickening the

trees and forest creatures of the surrounding

area. While it is tempting to blame this bale-

ful  influence  on  the  Talontar  blightlords  of

A ghost of the Great Barrow

116

THE GREAT DALE

the Rawlinswood, the evil here is different. Its foulness is

not Talonas blightin fact, the Rotting Man is keenly in-

terested in the mystery of Fortress Narder and sends parties

of  blightlords  here,  hoping  to  unearth  something  from  its

horrible dungeons.

Under the direction of the Nentyarch, the Circle of Leth

is calling treants to move the remaining healthy trees to safer

parts of the forest. Then the druids plan to quarantine the

area  and  destroy  the  corrupted  flora  and  fauna.  This  will

create a hole in the heart of the forest, but in time the wound

should heal over. If the druids have anything to say about it,

none but they and the Nentyar hunters will know there was

anything wrong here.

In the meantime, monstrous creatures spawned in Fortress

Narders dungeons creep out to hunt and slay in the forest

nearby, delaying the druids plans. The Nentyarch fears that

simply quarantining the ruins may not be enough. He may

have to find someone to uncover the source of the horrible

evil and destroy it once and for all.

MAUBERGS OAK

Maubergs  Oak  is  a  huge  tree  located  in  the  northwestern

reach of the Forest of Lethyr, about a hundred miles south-

east of Uthmere. The tree measures 50 feet in diameter at its

base and stands over 300 feet tall, towering over the canopy

of the forest around it. Its branches shade a vast area, and its

leaves are thick and green all year round, even in the dead of

the harshest winters.

Although still living, the tree was long ago hollowed out by

the powerful druid Mauberg. He magically worked the wood

to build a massive tower hideaway in the heart of the amaz-

ing tree. Although Mauberg has been dead for over a century,

his legacy lives on. He crafted the oak to house a school for

young druids and to display the awesome power of nature. The

tower features almost a dozen levels on the inside of the tree

and extends below the soil for three more levels.

The  schools  headmaster,  a  Theskian  woman  known  as

Oakandra  (NG  female  human  Drd13)  is  wary  of  strangers,

even new applicants. Only those who prove their dedication to

nature by passing various tests, both magical and mundane,

are allowed to enter the tree itself. Others are permitted to

sleep under the eaves of the oak if they are of either good or

neutral alignment. Evil visitors are run off immediately.

A large colony of treants lives under the oaks canopy. They

provide Oakandra with an early warning system against in-

coming  threats.  A  dozen  aarakocras  live  in  the  upper

branches  of  the  tree,  watching  the  skies  for  danger  from

above.  The  leader  of  this  group,  Chirkawta  (NG  male

aarakocra Drd12), is a powerful druid who once studied here

under Oakandra herself.

THE MUCKLESTONES

This ancient druidic holy site is located in the northeastern

Forest of Lethyr. Its unusual clearing features no tree trunks

but is protected from the sky by the bordering trees, which

meet  over  the  center  of  the  open  space.  Within  this  space

stand a number of weathered stones about 6 feet in height, 4

feet across, and 2 feet thick. Their surfaces are covered with

nature-runes.

The stones form an elaborate arrangement that shifts from

time  to  time,  as  the  stones  occasionally  move  about.  Elder

druids who have tracked the progression of the Mucklestones

over the years claim that sometimes the entire clearing moves,

taking  the  stones  along  with  it.  It  never  moves  very  far,

though, and the druids have always been able to track it down.

Each of the Mucklestones is a portal to a different part of

Faern. The nature-runes on a given stone indicate where it

leads, but they are difficult to puzzle outthey are carved in

an  ancient  dialect  of  the  Druidic  tongue  (Decipher  Script

check DC 30 or knowledge of the secret language of druids).

Some of the runes have faded over the years, making it im-

possible to know where the portal might lead.

At least one of these portals connects to the Sunglade deep

in the Yuirwood (see Chapter 8: Aglarond). The druids of this

area sometimes use it to meet with the Masters of the Yuir-

wood, and sometimes they bring along young rangers who wish

to study with the foresters of those elder woods.

The  Mucklestones  arent  the  property  of  any  person  or

group. Still, the Circle of Leth guards the area jealously for

fear that evil creatures might locate the stones and destroy

them. A high druid named Briartan (LN male human Drd13)

lives nearby, and he coordinates the efforts of his fellows

to  keep  the  Mucklestones  safe.  These  people  sometimes

call themselves the Mucklefriends, but rarely in the com-

pany of strangers.

YESHELMAAR

Not far from the crossroads of Bezentil, near the center of the

Great Dale, a great rocky tor rises from the forest. A pristine

lake of clear, cold water stands at its foot. Carved into the tor

is an old wood-elf stronghold known as Yeshelmaar, built in

the days when the Lethyr elves faced destruction at the hands

of the sinister Empire of Narfell to the north.

The threat of old Narfell has long since passed away, but so

too have most of the elven folk. Of the wood elves who once

lived here, only a few small villages survive. The old elven

stronghold has become the new fortress of the Circle of Leth.

The Nentyarch and his High Druids formerly inhabited Dun-

Tharos  in  the  Rawlinswood,  but  two  years  ago  they  were

driven  out  by  the  Talontar  blightlords,  and  Yeshelmaar

became the Nentyarchs seat-in-exile.

Yeshelmaar is the informal capital of the Great Dale, or at

least its eastern half. The folk of the lonely clanholds hold

a  deep  reverence  for  the  Nentyarch.  At  any  given  time,  a

dozen  druids  of  various  ranks  and  twice  that  number  of

rangers, hunters, and foresters occupy the stronghold or the

woods nearby, along with a handful of Dalesfolk come to seek

advice  or  assistance.  The  Nentyarch  is  occupied  in  a  fierce

contest against Talonas Rotting Man for the very soul of

two great forests, but his druids do what they can to help out

117

THE GREAT DALE

the Dalesfolk and shield them from the worst of the blight-

lords depredations.

Rawlinswood

The Rawlinswood forms the northern border of the Great

Dale, weaving its way south of the Giantspire Mountains and

the plains of Narfell until it peters out near the Cold Road

and the Firward Mountains. Once, the Rawlinswood was a

northern twin to the Forest of Lethyr, but a horrid evil has

clawed its way out of the black earth, poisoning the Rawlins-

wood  and  filling  its  green  gloom  with  blood,  disease,  and

madness.  The  sinister  Rotting  Man  (NE  male  half-fiend

human druid 12/Talontar blightlord 10, Chosen of Talona)

leads a dark circle of evil clerics and druids devoted to the

Lady  of  Poison  and,  through  these  blightlords,  a  growing

host of blightspawned volodni warriors that menace all the

nearby lands.

The Rawlinswood is a mixture of deciduous and evergreen

trees along its southern border but quickly becomes a soggy

taiga as one travels north from the Dale. Treacherous muskeg

bogs  fester  above  a  deep  layer  of  permafrost,  giving  rise  to

clouds of mosquitoes in the Rawlinwsoods short summer. In

its northwestern reaches, the forest climbs sharply toward the

Giantspire  Mountains,  covering  rugged  foothills  and  deep,

shadowed vales. Like all the Great Dale, it also rises toward the

east, and its easternmost reaches are quite hilly. The forest nar-

rows to a narrow band only twenty-five miles wide about two-

thirds of the way along its length, moving from west to east.

The now-abandoned settlement of Denderdale is located here

along the northern edge, almost enclosed by the reaching arms

of the forest. This is the best place to try cutting through the

forest. The way isnt long, comparatively, and those who are

eloquent or desperate enough may be able to hire a guide to

take them to the south side of the forest or back.

Just to the northwest of the forest is the Damaran settle-

ment of Tellerth, hard by the Long Road. For years, the Circle

of Leth worked to stop the encroachment of Damaran and

Impilturan loggers into the western reaches of the Rawlins-

wood, but the Nentyarchs followers have been driven into the

Forest of Lethyr and no longer patrol this area. The humans

now face the Rotting Man and his rising tide of evil.

DUN-THAROS

Once  the  capital  of  the  ancient  Empire  of  Narfell,  Dun-

Tharos sprawls for miles through the pines and bogs at the

heart of the Rawlinswood. From this place, the Nentyarchs (as

the rulers of ancient Narfell were known) ruled a great and

terrible realm of dark keeps and proud, sinister lords. Dun-

Tharos was laid waste in the final cataclysmic war between

Raumathar  and  Narfell,  the  entire  city  leveled  by  some

mighty spell of unspeakable power. So ended the Nentyarchs

and their demon-haunted kingdom.

Centuries  passed,  and  the  forest  grew  over  the  great

black  scar in its heart. A group of druids and rangersthe

Circle of Lethundertook the work of healing the wounded

land. Their leader took the title of Nentyarch anew to signify

that the druids of Leth ruled over the heart of ancient Nar-

fell. In the ruins of Dun-Tharos, the new Nentyarchs raised

a fortress to govern the great forest. The black keep of the old

demonpriests was reborn as a castle of living trees, woven by

druidic magic.

From this forest-castle the Nentyarchs ruled for nearly six

hundred  years,  preserving  the  Forest  of  Lethyr  and  the

Rawlinswood from encroachment by human kingdoms on all

sides. The ruins of the old Nar capital reminded the druids of

humanitys ability to harm nature, and the forest that had

swallowed its black stones offered an example of what might

be accomplished with patience and strength.

All things come to an end, though. Ten years ago, the Rot-

ting Man, Chosen of Talona, began to gather a circle of dark

druids in the western reaches of the Rawlinswood. The Circle

of Leth fought against the rising power of the blightlords and

contained the Rotting Man in the west, but two years ago the

Rotting Man created a terrible new weapon to use against the

Nentyarchthe blight of Talona. He corrupted a handful of

captured  Leth  druids,  changing  them  into  blightlords  who

serve him. Through these tortured minions, he ensnared hun-

dreds of volodnis and infected them with Talonas blight. At

Midwinter in 1371 DR, he hurled his blightspawned army at

the Nentyarchs fortress and drove the Circle of Leth out of

the Rawlinswood.

Dun-Tharos is still a castle of trees, but they are now dead,

animated through the Rotting Mans foul sorcery. Hundreds

of his minions lurk in the ruins of Narfells old capital, ready

to surge forth and slay at his command. His blightspawned

warriors  slaughtered  the  small  community  of  Denderdale,

north of the forest, only two months ago, and bands of evil

volodnis  harry  the  clanholds  and  farmsteads  south  of  his

forest. Dun-Tharos has become a place of death and madness

once again.

CLYMPH TOWER

Once a proud, walled keep, Clymph Tower has lain in ruins for

as long as anyone can remember. A mighty sorcerer named

Clymph built the place nearly five hundred years ago. Clymph

is also believed to have constructed Tower Threespires, for the

two sites have a similar architecture and were built around the

same  time.  Clymph  Tower  has  remained  untouched  for

decades, though, and the locals believe it is cursed for some

transgression of its fabled builder against the gods.

The best storyor at least the one that gets repeated the

mostis that Clymph was a powerful demonbinder, a student

of the forbidden arts of ancient Narfell. He dreamed of forg-

ing a kingdom in the Great Dale with his demonic armies. He

constructed this keep as a pen for his foul servants and imbued

its  very  stones  with  abjurative  magic,  transforming  the

perimeter of the building into a massive magic circle. He then

created a permanent gate directly into the Abyss. Unfortu-

nately, Clymph was unable to control the demonic hordes he

summoned, and his fiendish minions destroyed him. However,

118

THE GREAT DALE

he had crafted his demon-trap so well that the fiends could not

escape except through one portal leading to Tower Threespires,

and that door is sealed. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of demons

are still trapped in the fell tower Clymph raised centuries ago.

Today,  those  few  people  who  dare  to  approach  the  ruins

report that its stones glow red with heat and that massive fires

crackle from the depths. Even the most daring adventurers

give the place a wide berth.

TOWER THREESPIRES

The  legendary  Clymph  reputedly  built  this  tower  as  well.

Three stone spires stab out of its broad base. It would have

fallen over years ago if not for the thick network of vines that

wrap  around  every  inch  of  the  place.  If  the  vines  were  to

wither and die, the tower would come down along with them.

From a distance, the vine-engulfed tower looks like nothing

so much as a giant, three-fingered hand reaching up out of the

Rawlinswood.

The tower is maintained by a small group of druids who are

the descendants of a special order of guardians created by the

Nentyarch hundreds of years ago. The peak of the north tower

features a portal that leads right into the heart of Clymph

Tower. The druids perform a ritual every Feast of the Moon

to  keep  the  portal sealed  up  tight,  preventing  the  demons

trapped therein from escaping into the world. The druids who

perform the ritual are no longer certain if the legends about

the demons of Clymph Tower are true, but they hold to their

appointed task.

The druids of Tower Threespires are suspicious of strangers.

They never allow anyone into the tower, no matter how dire

the need, for fear of opening the portal and unleashing the

demons of the Abyss on the Great Dale.

NIGHTHAWK TOWER

Brave souls who skirt the Narfell edge of the Rawlinswood

on  their  way  east  and  south  toward  more  welcoming  lands

eventually  come  to  Nighthawk  Tower.  City  dwellers  may

not immediately recognize it, since its actually a mighty oak

treeabout 100 feet tallthe branches of which are filled

with  platforms  constructed  with  sturdy  rope  and  rough-

hewn wood.

Nighthawk Tower is the home of Hensoi (NG male human

Drd12 of Silvanus), who has a reputationdeserved or not

as the friendliest druid in the Great Dale. In other words, he

doesnt hide at the first sight of other people, nor does he run

off visitors before theyve had a chance to speak. Hensoi is

fond  of  the  regions  birds,  and  at  times  the  boughs  of

Nighthawk Tower seem like a giant aviary. The local raptors

often rest here.

Hensoi isnt outgoing, but he is willing to talk to strangers,

which is more than most druids in the area do. Underneath his

gruff  exterior,  hes  softhearted.  When  presented  with  good

people who need his help, he grudgingly agrees to do what he

can, although he complains about it the entire time.

When confronted with evil, Hensoi sends his avian friends

high into the sky to screech for help. The druids and rangers

in the region recognize the signal, and when they see it, they

dash for the tower to offer their help. The locals may think

Hensoi a bit too free with strangers, but hes one of them, and

they wont let him come to harm.

People of the

Great Dale

The people of the Great Dale are honest, hardworking folk

who simply want the outside world to leave them alone. For

the most part, theyve gotten their wish, since few people see

much reason to travel here. If it were not for the Great Road

connecting Uthmere to the east, there would not be any traf-

fic through the region at all.

The people of the Great Dale are a mix of old Chondathan,

Nar, Theskian, and more recently, Impilturan blood. The clan-

holds possess the oldest bloodlines of the land, with more than

a little of the ancient Nars. The folk of the Great Dale place

little importance on race or ethnicitya good neighbor is a

good neighbor. The older families do not always get along with

Impilturan  homesteaders  pushing  eastward  from  Uthmere,

who see miles of empty land and believe theyre free to settle

where they wish. This has led to bloodshed, but for the most

part, the Impilturan colonists have found land that doesnt en-

croach on the holds of the earlier Dalesfolk.

The  people  of  the  Great  Dale  dress  simply  and  for  the

weather. They favor homespun linen fabrics in the summer

and leathers and furs in the winters. Although sunlight barely

reaches the floor of the great forests, the ground underneath

them is well protected. The canopy of these elder woods is a

blanket in the winter, a shade in the summer, and an umbrella

when the rains come.

Races and Cultures

Once wild elves, wood elves, volodnis, and perhaps other races

populated the Great Dale. Few traces of their presence remain

in the land between the forests; since ancient times, this has

been a human land. Settlers fleeing the destruction of ancient

Jhaamdath moved into the area over sixteen centuries ago only

to end up under the crushing boot of the Empire of Narfell.

When that realm was destroyed in its war against Raumathar,

the residents of the Great Dale were suddenly ungoverned and

independent. They have avoided foreign rule ever since.

The people of the Great Dale are almost exclusively human.

The only exceptions, other than the odd wanderer, are the few

nonhumans who have settled in Uthmere, the only place in

the region that can lay claim to the label civilized. In the

wild eastern part of the Dale, that word is synonymous with

worthless and weak, carrying overtones of conniving and

deceit. Using it usually leads to an all-out brawl.

119

THE GREAT DALE

While the Dalesfolk dont like outlanders at all, they dont

care much for one another, either. The forests and fields are

dotted  with  tiny  enclaves  of  isolated  clans.  The  common

tongue here is Damaran, a legacy of ancient Narfell, but the

Nar heritage of the Great Dale is long forgotten. The old

Dalesfolk are descended from Chondathans who came to this

land  more  than  a  thousand  years  ago,  while  the  new  are

generally Impilturans who have settled the western reaches

of the Dale for several hundred years. The Circle of Leth is

the only unifying force in the region. If it were not for the

druidic  hierarchy,  the  two  cultures  sharing  the  Great  Dale

would be at each others throats.

Life and Society

Outside  the  port  city  of  Uthmere,  three  different  kinds  of

people inhabit the Dale: farmers, herders, and the druids and

rangers. Most of the farmers live under the trees in the west-

ern portions of the Dale and are often of Impilturan descent.

They grow crops of all sorts but prefer hardier grains such as

wheat  and  corn  that  can  stand  up  to  windswept  springs

and early frosts. The farmers usually end up with plenty for

themselves  and  enough  left  over  to  barter  with  traveling

merchants or their neighbors for things they cant grow or

make on their own. Most Great Dale farms are homesteads of

one or two families.

The herders keep their flocks in the open stretches of the

central and eastern Dale. Their homes are often made of field-

stone  fitted  together  by  hand  and  chinked  with  mud,  half-

buried  in  a  hillside  to  stay  below  the  winter  winds.  These

goatherds and shepherds are more likely to be old Dalesfolk

and gather in clanholds of five to ten related families.

The  rangers  and  druids  patrol  the  forests,  keeping  out

strangers and protecting their beloved woods. They warn off

wayward souls who wander into something they know noth-

ing about. People who are out to maliciously harm the forests,

however, receive the harshest treatment. The rangers of the

Great  Dale  save  their  greatest  fury  for  those  fools  who  at-

tempt to set up logging operations within their domain.

Both rangers and druids prefer to sleep under the shelter-

ing canopy of the Rawlinswood or the Forest of Lethyr. When

traveling, they may spend a night or two under the stars, but

they  prefer  to  minimize  their  time  in  the  open.  These  fol-

lowers of the Nentyarch hunt and gather their own food. They

sometimes call on the farmers of the land to contribute food

or shelter, but they prefer not to trouble the Dalesfolk.

ECONOMY

Uthmere has the only real economy in the Great Dale. Its lord

mints  coins  that  are  used  throughout  the  city  but  rarely

beyond. The people of the wilds prefer barter to money. As the

locals like to say, Coins are too easy to lose. Uthmere makes

most of its money on mooring fees charged to merchants who

use its harbor. In effect, this is a toll for the Great Road, as

the  only  easy  way  to  get  to  it  from  the  coast  is  directly

through Uthmere.

The people of the wild lands produce herbs, alchemical in-

gredients, and wooden goods of the highest quality. The Great

Dale has no mines within its borders, and the only forges are

in  Uthmere,  Bezentil,  and  Kront.  With  the  exception  of

simple iron items such as horseshoes or nails, the Dalesfolk

must import metal items and tools.

LAW AND ORDER

Uthmere is governed by an old code based on the laws of the

Impilturan crown. The city guards are empowered to enforce

the law; there is no separate town watch. An appointed mag-

istrate hears most cases, although Lord Uthlain himself pre-

sides  over  issues  of  serious  crimes.  Uthmere  is  a  haven  for

smugglers who ferry contraband into Impiltur across the East-

ing Reach, and the Shadowmasters of Telflamm are eager to

bring this illicit trade under their control.

In the countryside, the Great Dale is almost lawless. While

most  folk  dont  steal  from  or  injure  their  neighbors,  they

expect only what justice they can carve out with a blade. Many

people do not venture away from their homes unless armed,

even  if  only  with  a  quarterstaff  or  a  club,  but  a  well-worn

longsword or longbow is preferred by travelers in the wilder

reaches. Bandits and marauders are not very common, but the

lands of the Great Dale are filled with wild animals and mon-

sters. Only a civilized person would even consider walking

around without a weapon at his side.

Outside  of  Uthmeres  walls,  justice  is  either  swift  or  left

undone. Wrongdoers who are caught are punished on the spot

by their captors. The favored method of execution is to bind

criminals high in the branches of a tree, where they either die

of thirst or are eaten by animals. Its not unusual to see sun-

bleached, picked-over skeletons hanging in the trees along the

perimeter  of  either  forest.  These  are  an  object  warning  to

those who would intrude on the peace of these woods.

DEFENSE AND WARCRAFT

No one has tried to invade the Great Dale in centuries. The

Great  Road  could  be  a  path  of  Thayan  aggression  against

lands farther west, but the Great Dale is hundreds of miles

from Thay, and even the Red Wizards would have difficulty

sustaining an army so far from home. Even if invaders were

to attack the Dale, most of its people would let them pass

unmolested, as long as their armies stuck to the Great Road.

Any troops who entered the woods, however, would have to

contend with the full fury of the Nentyarch and the Circle

of Leth.

Its hard to imagine why another nation would want to con-

quer the Great Dale other than out of some kind of mad land-

lust. The riches of the land lie almost exclusively within its

mighty forests, and the danger involved in extracting them

would be ridiculously high. It is simpler, safer, and far cheaper

120

THE GREAT DALE

to barter with the localsand thats just what most of the

Great Dales neighbors have done over the years.

The rise of the Rotting Man and his blightlords in the black

hold of Dun-Tharos has finally brought a real threat to the

Great  Dale.  The  blightlords  command  an  army  of  blight-

spawned  treants,  volodnis,  and  animals,  a  slavering  horde

strong  enough  to  overwhelm  everything  east  of  Uthmere.

Only the vigilance of the Circle of Leth holds them in check,

and the Circle may not be able to contain the Talontar blight-

lords for much longer.

The Dalesfolk have seen enough of the blight to understand

that their homes and lives are endangered by the fell power

in the northern woods. For the first time in living memory,

the clanlords of the eastern Dale are making ready for war.

Nentyar hunters carry messages from hold to hold and farm

to farm. No one hold can muster more than a dozen or so

militia, but the druids hope a call to arms from the Nentyarch

will  bring  fighting  men  and  women  from  a  hundred  such

settlements. Only an immediate and dire threat could bring

the Dalesfolk to forget distance and differences, and the Rot-

ting Mans feral army poses exactly such a threat. Led by the

Circle  of  Leth,  Dalesfolk  under  arms  may  be  surprisingly

determined soldiers.

RELIGION

The citizens of Uthmere venerate most deities of the Faern-

ian pantheon. Even so, the most popular gods here are those

who  are  worshiped  throughout  the  Dale:  Chauntea,  Eldath,

Mielikki,  and  Silvanus  (although  Tyrs  faith  is  also  wide-

spread). Of these, Eldath garners the most worship in Uth-

mere because of her association with the waters that tumble

out of the forest and into the sea. The secret House of the

Masters Shadow (recently founded in an anonymous building

in the citys poorest quarter) is the local branch of the Shad-

owmasters.  The  Shadowmasters  have  already  started  their

standard tactic of recruiting from the youngest and poorest

inhabitants, and they have had a lot of success so far. Mask

is pleased.

Chauntea, Mielikki, and Silvanus are worshiped widely in

the  rest  of  the  territory.  The  people  of  the  Great  Dale  un-

derstand that while they may seem alone, they are always

surrounded by their chosen deitiesnature gods all. The farm-

ers who work the open fields favor Chauntea. Silvanus ap-

peals  to  most  of  the  druids  and  rangers,  although  Mielikki

comes in a close second. Women are especially fond of her, and

when a person of the Great Dale is in need, they appeal to her

kinder nature first. People who live along the Great Imphras

River  or  near  the  headwaters  of  the  Easting  Reach  often

prefer Eldath.

Adventurers

When most adventurers look at a map of Faern, they pass

over the Great Dale without a second thought. The reputation

of the Nentyarch and his followers is well known, as well as

the fact that the forests they protect are perilous to intrud-

ers. Still, there are plenty of opportunities for adventure in

the Great Dale: elven ruins to explore, rampaging monsters

to defeat, and terrorized communities to rescue. But heroes

who come here must deal with the Circle of Leth eventually.

If they are not careful in where they go and how they answer

challenges,  they  are  certain  to  have  problems  with  the

guardians of the Dale, possibly deadly ones.

Adventurers passing through the area find accommodations

few and far between. A fast-moving traveler on foot requires

at least fifteen to twenty days to walk the Great Road from

Uthmere to Kront, depending on the weather. In that entire

journey, shell find inns or welcoming farmhouses for no more

than  three  or  four  nights.  Its  rare  for  anyone  to  take  in

strangers. It doesnt matter if they are noble heroes on a quest

to free Faern from its worst nightmares. Theyll have to earn

the trust and friendship of the Dalesfolk, and that will not be

the work of a day.

Politics and Power

The Great Dale is a political nonentity. Its borders are defined

by its neighbors and the will of the Circle of Leth to protect

its forests. There is no national government, and the people

like  it  that  way.  Two  people  could  claim  to  rule  the  Great

Dale, were they so inclined: Lord Uthlain of Uthmere and the

Nentyarch.

Uthlain has enough trouble governing his small city, es-

pecially now that the Shadowmasters have moved into town.

Even if he tried to extend his influence outward from the

city, the people of the open lands would simply laugh at him.

Some  of  Uthlains  advisors  entertain  the  notion  of  subju-

gating the rest of the dale through military might, but the

Lord of Uthmere wants no part of such aggression. He knows

the  homesteaders  and  clansfolk  would  appeal  to  the  Nent-

yarch, and the land would erupt in a civil war. While Lord

Uthlain may have many ambitions for Uthmereand, by ex-

tension, the rest of the Great Dalehe has no desire to water

the forests with blood.

The Nentyarch already leads all the folk he cares to govern

through the Circle of Leth and harbors no desires to become

a druid-king. He is already in charge in the ways that matter,

and he is happy to avoid the politicking and headaches that

come with overt rule.

History of the Great Dale

The Great Dale has been mostly undisturbed since its lands fell

out  from  under  the  control  of  ancient  Narfell.  However,

recent  events  have  caused  the  people  of  the  Great  Dale  to

wonder if their long streak of luck is finally running out.

The Nentyarch of Tharos builds his capital at Dun-

Tharos and forges the Crown of Narfell. He begins a

campaign  to  conquer  the  various  petty  Nar  realms

and unite them beneath his rule.

The Nentyarchs armies destroy Shandaular, capital of

Ashanath; all Nar kingdoms now united.

The Raumvirans establish the realm of Raumathar,

with its capital at Winterkeep.

Year of the Stone Giant: Narfell and Raumathar de-

stroy each other. Dun-Tharos and Val-Murthag are

ruined.

Year of the Lyre: Uthmere is founded by Lord Uth-

mere of Dilpur.

Year of the Last Hunt: The Great Druid of Leth takes

the title of Nentyarch and raises a new druidic castle

amid the overgrown ruins at Dun-Tharos.

Year of the Twelve Teeth: The sorcerer Clymph raises

the demon-built tower that bears his name.

Year  of  the  Burning  Tree:  Clymph  builds  Tower

Threespires. Shortly thereafter, he is slain by demons

in his own keep.

Year  of  the  Dawndance:  The  war-captain  Imphras

unites the major cities of the Easting Reach into the

new nation of Impiltur.

Year of the Defiant Keep: Lord Elphras of Impiltur

raises a castle near the Great Barrow; the castle is mys-

teriously  abandoned  soon  thereafter,  and  he  is  not

heard of again.

Year of the Wanderer: The Windblown Goat is built

near  the  old  stone  markers  at  Bezentil.  Other  folk

follow, founding a small town at the site.

Year of the Serpent: Szass Tam allows the Tuigan horde

to pass through Thay and attack Rashemen. Thousands

of refugees stream across Lake Ashane. A few of the

more  determined  head  toward  Uthmere  and  settle

along the Great Road. To this day, the people of the

Great Dale refer to these people as the newcomers.

Year of the Helm: The Rotting Man appears in the

Rawlinswood.

Year of the Wave: Lord Uthlain inherits his position

from his father, Lord Uthrain. The elder lord is killed

in a hunting accident initially blamed on the rangers

of  the  Forest  of  Lethyr.  A  group  of  adventurers

tracks down the real killers, servants of the Shadow-

masters who hoped to destabilize Uthmere.

Year of the Banner: A strange plague sweeps through

the Forest of Lethyr, destroying the minds of many

treants and reducing them to mere trees.

Year  of  the  Tankard:  An  adventuring  party  enters

Clymph  Tower  with  the  aim  of  destroying  its

demons. They are never heard from again.

Year of the Unstrung Harp: The Rotting Mans army

takes Dun-Tharos, driving the Nentyarch into exile at

Yeshelmaar.

Year  of  Wild  Magic:  Current  year.  The  Talontar

blightlords begin mustering a blightspawned army to

crush the Circle of Leth and raze the Great Dale.

Government

The government of Uthmere is an inherited monarchy. The

first  ruler  of  the  city  was  its  founder,  Lord  Uthmere,  a

wealthy Dilpuran sea captain who believed he had discovered

the  perfect  gateway  to  eastern  Faern.  He  began  the  con-

struction  of  the  Great  Road  along  the  center  of  the  Great

Dale, and it was completed during his grandsons reign.

Sadly, Lord Uthmeres plans for transforming his town into

the jewel of the Easting Reach never materialized. Each of the

lords who followed has tried to breathe life into that dream,

but none have had much success. This is partly because the rest

of  the  country  doesnt  really  want  this  to  happen,  but  its

mostly because Uthmeres main competitor as the gateway to

the east is Telflamm, a city notoriously corrupted by the Shad-

owmasters headquartered there.

The Great Dale itself has no government. The closest the

lands outside of Uthmere come a ruler is the Nentyarch, the

leader of the Circle of Leth. The Nentyarch earned his posi-

tion by becoming the most powerful and respected druid in the

region.  He  plans  to  hold  this  place  of  honor  until  another

druid surpasses him, he retires, or he dies.

In the open lands of the Dale, politicssuch as they are

work like this: The Nentyarch tells the druids what to do; the

druids advise the clanlords and the leaders of homesteads, and

those individuals run their lands as they choose. The leader of

a small clan is hardly an autocrat or a tyrant; he might be the

king of his hold, but one who rules with the consent of his

kinsfolk. The Nentyar rangers or Leth druids often serve as

impartial arbiters when neighboring clan-chiefs cant come to

an agreement about matters of mutual concern.

Enemies

Despite the Great Dales lack of traditional riches and the fact

that  it  is  mostly  untamed  wilderness,  a  number  of  factions

harbor ill intentions toward the Dalesfolk and their druidic

protectors.

THE QUENCESTA

The Quencesta are members of one of the most violent tribes

in  all  Narfell.  Eager  for  plunder  and  slaughter,  they  have

launched  attack  after  attack  against  their  kinfolk  over  the

years, and every time, they have been crushed by the combined

might  of  the  other  tribes.  Recently,  they  have  decided  to

switch  targets  and  have  turned  their  collective  eye  on  the

Great Dale.

Under the guidance of Warleader Heara (CE female human

Bbn11/Rog2),  the  Quencesta  have  been  slowly  massing  for

war. Their activity has not gone unnoticed by the Dag Nost

tribe, who live in the southern plains of Narfell. The Dag Nost

are not the target of the impending Quencesta raid, though

the  folk  of  the  Great  Dale  are.  Warleader  Heara  plans  to

strike south, cutting straight though the narrowest part of the

Rawlinswood to break out into open ground near Bezentil.

A blightlord waits for a chance to strike

In  the  path  of  the  savage  Quencesta  stand  the  blight-

spawned armies of the Rotting Man. Heara and her warriors

know little of the Talontar blightlords, as the tribesfolk nor-

mally do not come so far south. Similarly, the blightlords pay

little attention to the barbarians of the plains north of the

Rawlinswood. Most likely, the blightlords will meet the drive

of the Quencesta invasion with their own armyunless the

Rotting Man chooses to stand aside and allow the Quencesta

to pass through his forest or, worse yet, makes an alliance with

the bloodthirsty barbarians.

DEMONS FROM ANCIENT DAYS

The rulers of ancient Narfell forged their empire, not with

statesmanship and diplomatic skill, but through pacts with

demons who agreed to serve them. Despite the power of their

foul  allies,  the  rulers  of  Narfell  came  to  a  bad  end.  While

they were being wiped out, many of their demonic servants

vanished into the deepest, darkest parts of the forest. Some

of  these  fiends  concealed  themselves  for  centuries,  slum-

bering away the years while they waited for great Narfell to

rise again.

But  many  of  the  creatures  were  unable  to  awaken  from

their  deathless  slumber.  Beneath  the  Rawlinswood  and  the

darker portions of the Forest of Lethyr, these ancient demons

still lie buried despite the passage of fifteen centuries.

Every  now  and  then,  some  curious  fortune-hunter  runs

across an old ruin, and while poking around for treasure, dis-

turbs a sleeping demon. The Nentyarch is aware of the po-

tential  problems,  but  he  prefers  not  to  risk  awakening  the

creatures. Some of the fell powers sleeping beneath the forests

are so strong and wicked that not even the Nentyarch him-

self could hope to imprison them again.

The Nentyar hunters keep an eye on such places to ensure

that no strangers get near them, but their bitter contest with

the  Talontar  blightlords  and  the  impending  raid  of  the

Quencesta may make such vigilance difficult. While the Circle

of Leth has its hands full, the invaders are likely to discover

and let loose a few demons.

Cities and Sites

The  Great  Dale  boasts  only  one  city  of  any  size:  Uthmere.

Every other settlement is a tiny hold or thorp, usually home

to fewer than twenty people. Most of these tiny communities

huddle along the Great Road, including Bezentil and Kront,

123

THE GREAT DALE

the only other settlements that might even be called towns.

For most people of the Great Dale, these towns are a neces-

sary evil, if only because their presence along the road keeps

strangers from wandering into the woods.

The Circle of Leth guard this secret carefully. If word of the

markers true nature gets out, the Great Road would once again

become a main artery of traffic moving between Kara-Tur and

the rest of Faern. The druids cherish their solitude, and they

will  go  to  great  lengths  to  ensure  that  it  is  not  broken  by

twenty times the current number of merchant caravans.

Merchants, of course, would pay dearly for such informa-

tion.  Such  a  mysterious  but

useful  portal would  open  up

new trade with the east, with-

out  anyone  having  to  brave

the  hazards  of  the  Endless

Wastes.

MAJOR

BUSINESSES

Only a handful of businesses

flourish  in  Bezentil.  Their

proprietors are the friend-

liest and most open-minded

people east of Uthmere.

The  largest  building  is

Stricks  Trading  Post,  a

general store run by Abri-

hando  Strick  (LE  male

human  Com6)  and  his

wife  Gennia  (LN  female

human  Com3).  Travelers

can  buy  and  sell  most

mundane  items  worth  25

gp  or  less  here,  although

Stricks  prices  are  double

normal.  Hes  literally  the

only  shop  for  hundreds  of

miles around, and he knows it.

Mimor Katan (NG male human

Com4)  and  his  family  run  the  Windblown

Goat, a small inn and tap house. Katans rooms

are charitably described as rustic, but he has a

half-dozen  available  at  a  reasonable  rate,  and  on  a  winter

night,  a  dirt-floored  room  with  a  fire  is  much  more  com-

fortable than a blanket on a frigid hillside. Katans kitchen

serves a hearty meal and excellent homemade ale, but the spe-

cialty of the house is a precious liquor known as goldenleaf.

Last year, a livery stable opened up not far from the Wind-

blown Goat. Weary travelers can rest their mounts and have

them groomed and fed for a few silver pieces each. Cassilla

Fen  (NG  female  human  Exp7),  the  owner,  is  also  a  skilled

cartwright,  capable  of  repairing  all  but  the  most  damaged

wagons. She has been a godsend to the caravans passing this

way, the more so because her prices are reasonable.

cBezentil (Hamlet): Conventional; AL LN; 100 gp limit;

Assets 620 gp; Population 124; Isolated (human 96%, half-elf

3%, elf 1%).

Bezentil (HAMLET)

Bezentil is the only real commu-

nity  between  the  Great  Roads

western  and  eastern  ends,  and

the  only  town  worthy  of  the

name  for  at  least  a  hundred

miles  in  any  direction.  Here  a

series of ten dwarf-high stones

are  spaced  along  the  road  in

10-foot intervals. The site has

been  used  as  a  meeting  place

for  untold  years,  but  the

settlement  itself  is  rela-

tively  new.  As  recently  as

forty years ago, no buildings

stood  here,  and  no  one

lived within a dozen miles

of the spot.

The  sole  industry  in

Bezentil  is  trading  with

people  passing  through  on

the  Road.  Caravans  com-

monly  use  the  place  as  a

waymeet.  The  locals  bring

out  locally  made  or  grown

goods  such  as  fine  wooden

items,  rare  herbs,  produce,

pelts, and leather goods, bar-

tering  for  manufactured

items  such  as  tools  and

weapons.  The  people  of  the

Great Dale are wonderful foresters

and  farmers,  but  they  lack  skill  in

mining and working metals.

The markers at Bezentil

THE MARKERS

The stone markers along the Road radiate a lingering aura of

conjuration magic almost all year long. At the exact moment

of both the spring and autumn equinoxes, the powerful spells

with which they are imbued suddenly leap to life. Anyone who

moves along the road at this time and touches all ten mark-

ers in sequence is instantly transported with his belongings to

an identical set of markers in far-off Kara-Tur.

The Great Road was once the main route for transport be-

tween Faern and the lands to the east, but this was long ago,

back when elves were the only humanoids who lived in the

Great Dale. The only evidence that elves were ever here in-

cludes a handful of ancient ruins scattered throughout the ter-

ritoryand these markers on the road.

Denderdale (RUINED)

In the northern cut of the Rawlinswood, a little north and

west of Bezentil, lie the ruins of the small community of Den-

derdale. Its Dalesfolk formerly traded with those Nar tribes

inclined to deal with outsiders and maintained a wary truce

with the rest. But two months ago, on a cold night in early

Marpenoth, a trio of powerful blightlords led a company of

blightspawned  volodni  warriors  out  of  the  surrounding

forests and razed the village. Of the settlements four hundred

people, only a few dozen escaped with their lives. Its whis-

pered that many of the slain have been reanimated as undead

troops in the Rotting Mans army.

Evreltheds Hill

About four days travel east of Uthmere and half a days walk

from  the  Great  Road  stands  the  farmstead  of  Evrelthed

Northol (LG male human Ftr2/Exp3). Evrelthed, his wife,

their four sons, his brother, and his brothers family live here,

a tiny settlement of eleven people huddled in a sheltered dell

miles from their nearest neighbors. Such farmsteads are scat-

tered like a half-handful of seed corn across the broad expanse

of the Dale. Unlike more settled areas, where most parcels of

arable ground belong to somebody, the Great Dale has wide

stretches of unclaimed land that anyone can claim, as long as

theyre willing to put up with bitter weather, dangerous mon-

sters, and a lot of loneliness.

Evrelthed  is  a  thin,  sour  man  of  about  forty  who  has

steadily refined the art of complaining about his land and his

fortunes for decades. He and his family are willing to put up

travelers who dont mind sleeping in a fieldstone cellar cut

into the side of a hill a hundred yards from the farmsteaders

home. The accommodations may be humble, but Evreltheds

wife  Kalina  (LG  female  human  Com3)  serves  the  heartiest

supper for a hundred miles.

Kront (HAMLET)

Kront is a tiny outpost where the Great Road meets the Cold

Road and the road to Tammar. This is the most well-traveled

crossroads in the region, and most of the Dalesfolk disavow

it for that reason, claiming the place more properly belongs

to Thesk. Thesk, Rashemen, and Narfell all refuse to lay claim

to the place, though, so its part of the Great Dale by default.

Kront  is  a  neutral  trading  ground  for  the  surrounding

lands.  The  merchants  who  regularly  pass  through  here  ap-

preciate the lack of politics, especially since this translates

into no direct taxes or tolls. The people of Kront make their

living trading goods and services with travelers. Kront con-

centrates on providing services to traders, but its also a key

point  for  folk  from  hundreds  of  miles  around  to  purchase

tools  and  other  items  they  cannot  fashion  on  their  own.

Many merchants who start out thinking of Kront as a rest

stop on their way to other points have decided this is a fine

place  to  trade  as  well.  In  particular,  fisherfolk  come  here

every day to hawk their catches from Lake Ashane, provid-

ing fresh fish for those staying in Kront and smoked meat for

them to take on their way.

Mavalgard (THORP)

Home to Clan Maval, a sturdy family of hardscrabble farm-

ers and herders, Mavalgard is typical of the dozen or so iso-

lated clanholds in the central and eastern reaches of the Great

Dale.  Fiercely  independent  and  stubbornly  self-reliant,  the

Mavals came to this land from Impiltur almost two hundred

years ago, determined to carve out a life of their own from

the barren wilderness. Today, the hold is home to an extended

family  of  perhaps  fifty  souls  under  the  rule  of  Angheder

Maval (CG male human Ftr4/Ari3), a short-tempered old cur-

mudgeon who is far wiser than he lets on.

Mavalgard is a rough motte-and-bailey keep with a field-

stone  tower  and  a  ramshackle  wooden  palisade.  It  is  sur-

rounded  by  several  rude  homes  of  fieldstone  and  thatch

burrowed snugly into the steep hillsides to avoid the worst of

the winter winds. The Mavals maintain friendly relations with

several other clanholds within a days journey or so, and the

folk of these holds gather three or four times a year to drink,

trade, decide matters of justice, and arrange marriages.

125

THE GREAT DALE

Mettledale and

Spearsmouth Dale

Along the southern border of the Forest of Lethyr lie two small

settlements that are part of the Great Dale, of Thesk, or nei-

ther, depending on whom you happen to ask. Spearsmouth Dale

is a little more than fifty miles north of Phsant in a narrow

vale  that  arrows  another  twenty  miles  or  so  into  the  forest.

Lord Abraer Thellblade (CG male human Ftr8), a former ad-

venturer, watches over the sleepy village from a keep he and

his companions cleared of vampires several years ago. Its people

consider themselves Dalesfolk, but Lord Abraer obtained his

writ to govern the land from the ruling council of Phsant. This

doesnt trouble the locals, who know that Abraer saved them

from death or worse by destroying the vampire lord of the keep.

Mettledale is in a larger vale just north and east of Spears-

mouth Dale. Several small villages dot this fertile valley, all

under the rule of an arrogant wizard-lord named Vosthor (NE

male hagspawn Wiz11). The dale has traditionally been ruled

by  the  most  powerful  wizard  in  residence,  and  Vosthora

wandering troublemaker and tomb-plundererunseated the

previous ruler two years ago upon learning of the tradition.

A brutal gang of brigands and thugs backs up the hagspawn,

serving as his constables and tax collectors. The folk of

Mettledale are too intimidated to move directly against their

wizardly master, but they are growing desperate to get rid of

the predacious Vosthor.

Uthmere (SMALL CITY)

Built where the Dalestream meets the Easting Reach, Uth-

mere is easily the largest settlement in all the Great Dale.

The river is shallow and not navigable, but a stone breakwa-

ter protects a small but bustling harbor. Of course, the people

of the wilds dont consider the big city part of their home-

land at all. Similarly, the residents of Uthmere have little at-

tachment to the rest of the country. As the saying goes among

the people of the Great Dale, Its a long way from Uthmere

to Kront.

Most  of  Uthmeres  inhabitants  hail  from  Impiltur,

Damara, and Thesk. For centuries, various Impilturan lords

have  ruled  the  citysome,  exiles  who  fled  an  enemy  at

court, others, crusaders who dreamed of taming the wilder-

ness to the east and bringing Impilturan law and culture to

the benighted Dalesfolk. Although Uthmere is nominally in-

dependent of Impiltur, the lordship of the city remains an

Impilturan title.

As one might expect, the interests of Uthmere dont always

coincide with those of the rest of the Great Dale. The current

ruler, Lord Uthlain (NG male human Ari12), hopes to see his

small city become a major hub of commerce in the region, but

the druids and rangers who live along the Great Road have

confounded his efforts. The Circle of Leth does not concern

itself  with  homesteaders  claiming  empty  lands  in  the  open

dale, but entrepreneurs hoping to rake furs, timber, and other

THE GREAT DALE

riches from the forests find the druids quick to discourage all

but the least intrusive of such activities.

LORDS PALACE

Lord Uthlain lives in a gray stone palace above the harbor.

He  maintains  his  power  through  a  decades-old  alliance  his

family made long ago with a band of seven stone giants. These

massive creatures are Uthlains muscle in the small city, and

they supplement and reinforce the town guard.

The stone giants have sworn an oath of fealty to Uthlains

family, a duty that they take seriously. They are compensated

well for their efforts and actually live on the first floor of the

Lords Palace. Nearly everything at this level is built for both

joint human and stone giant use. The ceilings are 20 feet high,

but a railed balcony runs along every room at the floor, rais-

ing those standing on them to eye level with the giants who

share the place.

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

The city boasts a number of excellent inns, mostly catering

to seafarers who wish to spend a night on solid ground for a

change. At the top end of the scale, the Captains Loft offers

luxurious accommodations. Its prices (roughly triple normal)

ensure that only the proper class of people stay there. Only

the  captains  of  the  largest  and  most  successful  ships  can

afford it.

Toward the bottom of the barrel, there is the legendary dive

known as the Bloody Hook. This seedy hole in the wall serves

hard drinks to hard people, and at the end of the night, the

scullery maid often mops up as much spilled blood as beer. For

adventurers looking for action, though, this is the place.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Most of the major good and neutral deities are represented in

Uthmere.  The  Hall  of  Brilliant  Justice  is  a  large,  fortified

temple  to  Tyr  under  the  High  Master  of  the  Just,  Blostin

Marsk (LG male human Clr10 of Tyr). The hidden House of

the Masters Shadow, a temple dedicated to Mask, lurks in the

worst part of town. The Shadowmasters of Telflamm vener-

ate Mask, and as they extend their tendrils deeper and deeper

into the commerce of the nearby cities, they bring the wor-

ship of their nefarious deity with them. The Shadowmasters

have gained a secure foothold in Uthmere, and they intend to

bring the entire city under their dark dominion.

Heroes and

Monsters

Most characters from the Great Dale are humans, wood elves,

half-elves, or volodnis. Adventurers are most often druids

or rangers.

Volodnis, the hardy pine folk of the northern forests, are

described in Chapter 1: Races of the East. Chapter 2: Prestige

Classes describes the Nentyar hunter, Nar demonbinder, and

Talontar blightlord prestige class. Although the demonbinder

is rarely (if ever) a heroic figure, and the blightlord is always

a  black-hearted  villain  of  the  worst  sort,  these  classes  are

useful when designing NPC villains.

New monsters in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East that are

common to the Great Dale include the blightspawned (often

treants  or  volodnis),  juju  zombies,  fell  trolls,  mur-zhagul

(demon  trolls),  and  volodnis.  Blooded  ones  (usually  orcs  or

ogres) and dread warriors are not uncommon in the vicinity

of Ashanath, which borders the Great Dale to the southeast.

Some of these creatures are left over from the last war be-

tween Thesk and Thay. Others have wandered up the coast or

were sent out more recently to scout in this direction.

127

east,  quickly  becoming  quite  rugged  as  one  approaches  the

Sunrise Mountains. The northernmost reaches of the Sun-

rise range are lower and snowier than the southern portion

bordering  Thay,  and  from  these  well-watered  peaks,  innu-

merable rivers and streams flow west to Lake Ashane. Ages

ago,  glaciers  scarred  this  land,  carving  deep  U-shaped

canyons in the mountains and trapping hundreds of tiny lakes

behind moraines.

The  North  Country,  Rashemens  upper  two-thirds,  is

mostly  bleak,  windswept  plains  with  little  vegetation  other

than hardy grass and scrub. The southerly reaches of this area

consist of knife-edged rocky ridges with steep ravines covered

with  a  thick  pine  forest,  but  the  landscape  flattens  as  one

moves north, becoming a vast cold steppe unbroken for more

than a hundred miles before the foothills of the Icerims rise

up from the plains. The North Country lies 3,000 feet above

sea level, as does much of the rest of Rashemen, and this al-

titude contributes to its harsh winters.

On Rashemens western flank is a veritable inland sea, the

great  lakes  of  Ashane  and  Mulsantir.  Stretching  over  500

miles  in  length  and  more  than  eighty  miles  wide  at  their

broadest point, these lakes occupy deep rift valleys between the

high  plateaus  of  Ashanath,  Thay,  and  the  North  Country.

Rivers from the surrounding elevations drain into these lakes,

which have no surface outlet. However, they are freshwater,

not salt, which suggests that one or both are linked to seas or

subterranean rivers in the Underdark.

Magic  has  sculpted  Rashemens  geography  as  much  as

wind  and  weather.  Caught  between  the  warring  nations  of

Narfell and Raumathar long ago, Rashemen is a place of an-

cient wizardry and powerful spirits (called telthors) tied to the

features of the land. Spirits guard the forests, mountains, and

waterways against defilersin some places, every stone and

sapling has its own guardian. The local folk respect and take

care to not offend the spirits, which are said to punish those

who are callous toward them and bear grudges against com-

munities for years.

In addition to its native spirits, Rashemen features many

old sites of battle between the dead warring nations, and from

time to time dormant spells are awakened, rocking the land

Foreigners  view  Rashemen  as  a  mysterious,  magical

land  of  harsh  winters  ruled  by  masked  witches  and

populated by berserkers. Far away from the southern

climates and the warming oceans, it is a barren waste of frozen

plains and snow-covered mountains where a person can freeze

to death overnight even in the middle of summer. Such talk is

exaggeration, but it is based in truth. Much of Faern owes its

safety and security to Rashemen, for this small nation has held

its own against the armies and collected magic of Thay time

and again, sparing Thays other neighbors from the attentions

of the Red Wizards.

Geographic

Overview

Rashemen  is  about  the  same  size  as  Cormyr,  running  ap-

proximately 330 miles from its southern border at Lake Mul-

santir to its northern reaches at the Icerim Mountains, and

270 miles from Lake Ashane, its western border, to its curv-

ing eastern border that ends at the southeast arm of the Ice-

rims. The Sunrise Mountains and two small but thick forests

divide Rashemens lower third from the rest of the country,

and most of its citizens inhabit this smaller portion. Although

its size is comparable, Rashemens harsh climate and remote

location mean its population is less than half that of Cormyr.

The lower third of Rashemen is a cool, hilly land of pine

forests and heather-grown downs. The land climbs toward the

RASHEMEN

with earthquakes, freakish storms, and strange monsters. For-

tunately, most of these battlefields are in the northern, less

populated reaches of the country. The icy lakes and rivers that

form Rashemens western border are enough to deter casual

aggressors, and the fury of its native sons and daughters drives

off  all  but  the  most  determined  attackers.  The  people  of

Rashemen love their home despite its dangers and prefer to

keep it untarnished by the footprints of ignorant visitors.

Major Geographic

Features

Lake Ashane is the longest natural feature defining Rashe-

mens  borders.  Icy  cold  and  inhabited  by  water  spirits  and

aquatic monsters, it is the lifeblood of many fishing villages.

Ferries cross at Mulsantir, where the Golden Way spans the

lake.  The  Ashane  ices  every  winter,  particularly  in  its  nar-

rower stretches, and caravans cross on foot when the surface

is frozen.

Lake  Mulsantir  is  a  turbulent  body  of  water  that  forms

part of the border with Thay. In years past, the Red Wizards

stocked  the  lake  with  hostile  magical  crossbreeds,  but  such

things were as likely to return south against their creators as

to go north, so this practice has ceased. Some of the more cun-

ning creatures survive, though, and are blamed whenever boats

disappear on this lake. Mulsantir connects with Lake Ashane

through a broad passage referred to as the River Mulsantir.

Rashemens southern border continues east from Lake Mul-

santir along the Gorge of Gauros to the Sunrise Mountains.

Evil humanoids and natural predators make life dangerous for

travelers and prospectors here. The border runs north past the

ruins of Citadel Rashemar, which is inhabited by fell creatures

and ruled by a powerful hag sorcerer, then north and north-

east along the edge of the Endless Waste until it reaches the

Icerim Mountains. Frost giants, frost worms, taers, and white

dragons lurk in the Icerims, but these creatures dislike the rel-

ative warmth of the flatlands and are rarely seen there. The

southern edge of the Icerims forms the countrys northern

border to the Falls of Erech, which flow downstream to join

Lake Ashane.

Most interesting features of Rashemen are confined to its

southern parts. The eastern side of Lake Ashane cradles the

Ashenwood, a wild forest inhabited by hungry monsters. East

of the Ashenwood are the Running Rocks, a leg of the Sun-

rise Mountains reputed to have mystical powers and connec-

tions  to  the  Underdark.  The  Urlingwood  to  the  north  is

controlled by the Witches and forbidden to all others under

penalty of death. In the middle of the southern flatlands is

Lake Tirulag, fed by rivers originating in the forests and in-

habited by an ice dragon.

Ashenwood

This  ancient  forest  is  primarily  ash,  aspen,  fir,  and  pine.

Mighty  spirits  live  in  the  stones  and  trees,  capable  of  im-

parting  great  wisdom  to  listeners  or  exacting  terrible

vengeance  on  those  who  trespass.  By  ancient  tradition,  the

Ashenwood  remains  unpopulated,  both  as  a  precaution

against the anger of the spirits and as a promise to preserve

this most sacred and pristine part of Rashemen.

While no Rashemi live here permanently, some enter for

a short time to hunt or to complete a quest. These visits always

begin with prayers and small gifts for the spirits to ensure

their favor. A typical offering is a flask of clean water, a hand-

ful of fertile earth from a garden or farm, and a meal con-

sisting  of  several  kinds  of  food  that  would  appeal  to  the

creatures of the forest. The meal is burned on a smoky fire in

the middle of a circle of stones so the smell of it will reach

the spirits.

The subjects of a hunt are usually perfect specimens of a

particular kind of animal (such as a stag), although dangerous

dire animals are common prey as well. Whenever a hunt is suc-

cessful, the hunters make offerings so that the creatures spirit

will become a telthor (see Chapter 6: Monsters of the East)

or at least will not seek vengeance against the hunters.

In addition to mundane creatures and spirits, fierce mon-

sters inhabit the forest, such as annis hags, ettercaps, owlbears,

stirges, and trolls. Some of these creatures are very old and

cunning and have grown to unusual size. Rashemi legend tells

of Hornclaw the Gray, an owlbear bigger than most giants and

said to be over a hundred years old, and of Dar-Guran, a fell

troll who can take off a mans head in one bite.

Not all of the unusual residents of the Ashenwood are so

dangerous. Bristlebeard, an awakened dire boar with patches

of  bright  red  hair,  listens  to  the  telthors  and  watches  over

Rashemi who become lost in the forest. Stormwind (NG treant

of 20 HD) is a huge and ancient treant who sleeps for decades

at a time but awakens to speak to the Witches when they need

his council. Stormwind is so large that he has been mistaken

for the Wood Man, a legendary embodiment of the power of

the forest that is said to defend Rashemen against invaders.

Ashanath

With the exception of the trade-town of Kront (see Chapter

9: The Great Dale) at its north end, this plain is completely

uninhabited by humanoids. Grassy with rich dark soil and a

few small herds of wild oxen and ponies roaming its length,

the Ashanath is an untouched breadbasket. Resources are so

plentiful in this area that they easily could support a large

city-state such as those along the Moonsea, but people do not

settle here because of the frequent tornadoes that tear up the

earth for miles at a stretch. Regardless of the season or am-

bient weather conditions, this territory experiences dozens of

tornadoes a yearsometimes as often as once a tenday.

Hornclaw greets a hunter

The Red Wizards of Thay use magic to ensure good weather

for  their  slave-farmed  crops,  and  many  believe  the  strange

storms  in  the  Ashanath  are  a  side  effect  of  this  artificial

weather, or an attempt by nature to balance out the magically

induced tranquility in Thay. In any case, the Rashemi avoid

this area and do not consider it part of their territory. The

only time they cross the River Mulsantir and go through the

Ashanath is when traveling to Thesk. Theskian druids have

imbued large boulders on the plain with spells that detect tur-

bulent weather, so they have a limited awareness of when the

storms are active. Fortunately, it is very rare for the torna-

does to reach the Golden Way or cross Lake Ashane.

About twenty miles north of Kront, on the shores of the lake,

lie the ruins of a great city. Known locally as the City of Weep-

ing Ghosts, this place was once Shandaular, capital of the petty

Nar realm of Ashanath. The Nentyarch of ancient Tharos de-

stroyed Shandaular almost two thousand years ago, the final

step in the unification of ancient Narfell. The place is haunted

by many dangerous undead, including at least one nightshade.

Erech Forest

This remote forest lies outside the domain of Rashemen, but

its dark and bitter woods are the home of angry spirits, hos-

tile  plants,  and  evil  fey.  The  secret  sisterhood  of  the

durthans,  aggressive  counterparts  of  the  hathrans,  use  the

Erech Forest as their private refuge, just as the hathrans use

the Urlingwood. The durthans invisibly travel to and from the

Erech to meet with their sisters, train guardian beasts, and ex-

plore  dark  magic.  Assassin  vines,  night  hunters,  owlbears,

shambling  mounds,  and  at  least  one  gray  render  guard  the

forest,  in  addition  to  evil  telthors.  Most  dangerous  are  the

durthans themselves, who slay any intruders. Few people sus-

pect  the  existence  of  the  durthans  and  fewer  still  know  of

their base in the Erech, so it remains secure against concerted

investigation. The durthans are in the process of building a

fortress for themselves, dubbed Citadel Tralkarn.

FALLS OF ERECH

These falls mark the northwesternmost part of Rashemen. As

the waters of the River Erech flow toward Lake Ashane, they

plunge over a hundred feet in a roaring cascade of white that

is breathtaking. Rashemi youths about to leave their country on

a journey of adulthood camp here for at least one night and cast

offerings into the falls to the spirits and deities. The falls are

said to possess a magic that punishes thieves and rewards those

who show the proper obeisance with good fortune and long life.

Most Rashemi attribute any success in life to proper offerings.

Over  the  centuries,  a  fortune  in  gems,  coins,  weapons,

armor, and minor magic items has accumulated at the bottom

of the cataract. However, only a fool would try to steal this

131

RASHEMEN

wealth. The water is glacial runoff, little more than freezing,

and its constantly pounding on the rocks below. As well, the

local  spirits  guard  these  offerings  and  slay  any  would-be

thieves. The Rashemi themselves capture and execute any loot-

ers who manage to escape the spirits.

Beyond the falls are a few humanoid tribes, but they rarely

are brave enough to tempt the wrath of the Rashemi, instead

harassing the small Nar horse tribes to the west.

The High Country

This  northernmost  portion  of  the  Sunrise  Mountains  is  a

place of dark hills, ancient monoliths, wild magic, and strange

occurrences. Few go there, and the Rashemi who live in this

place are a cautious and suspicious folk.

The High Country is a chain of high peaks surrounded by

a scattering of hills. Ragged and forbidding, the slopes hide

hundreds  of  small  ravines  and  valleys,  many  of  which  are

filled with snow for months. They claim dozens of lives every

year  from  fools  who  mistake  a  smooth  white  break  in  the

mountains for a pass, only to discover it is a thin crust of snow

and ice over a hundred-foot drop into a crevasse.

Some  of  the  monoliths  are  markers  for  old  Raumathari

sites, but others are magical traps created by the Raumathari

wizards to imprison Nar demons. If broken, these stone pris-

ons would release any trapped fiends, so the Witches of Rashe-

men  check  the  known  monoliths  every  year  for  wear  and

damage. Other structures predate the Narfell-Raumathar war

and may be wayposts left by the Imaskari or an even older

race. Natural animals avoid the magical stones.

Grim  hunters  who  prefer  solitude  sparsely  inhabit  the

mountains. Even the most nature-savvy Rashemi wonder how

these folk manage to survive. The hunters are suspicious of all

strangers, even other Rashemi, and assume that non-Rashemi

are wizards intent on stealing souls or enslaving the innocent.

They  are  very  superstitious  and  carry  charms  and  amulets

(some magical, some not) to ward off hostile spirits. They fear

the monoliths and avoid them at all costs.

Goblins and kobolds live in the ravines and dig many war-

rens there, raiding mining settlements and even lowland areas

when  the  weather  is  good.  The  largest  colony  of  goblins  is

ruled by King Nanraak the Fierce (LE male goblin Ftr7), a

lean and belligerent chieftain with over one hundred fighting

goblins  under  his  command.  Tekun  the  Warlord  (NE  half-

white  dragon  kobold  Rgr6  of  Auril)  is  the  greatest  kobold

leader in the mountains and may have two hundred or more

kobold warriors in his forces.

Snow tigers, wolves, and winter wolves are common preda-

tors  in  the  mountains.  The  normal  animals  are  a  threat  to

humans only when other game cannot be found, but the winter

wolves maliciously seek out intelligent prey, sometimes work-

ing  in  concert  with  goblin  tribes.  The  most  powerful  one

known by name is Hurrahesh (NE male winter wolf Bbn5),

easily recognized by his unusual green eyes. The winter wolves

sometimes work with small troll tribes, but as they compete for

food and territory, this is infrequent except in times of plenty.

An adult white dragon, Kissethkashaan, has been spotted in

several places among the mountains but withdraws whenever

he  notices  humans.  There  are  many  half-dragons  and  very

young white dragons among the local kobold tribes, suggesting

that the dragon, called Kashaan by the Rashemi, has been cre-

ating minions for himself. He is avoiding conflict, preferring

to annex most of the High Country through his offspring.

Recently,  human  miners  have  reported  patrols  of  gray

dwarves  at  night  east  of  Lake  Mulsantir.  Apparently,  the

duergar  have  tunneled  through  to  the  surface  and  are  sur-

veying the area. Whether their intent is hostile or mercantile

is unknown, but tensions are high among the mountain folk,

and the leaders of Rashemen are investigating.

Telthors and the ghosts of slain Tuigan raiders lurk in the

mountains. The telthors usually wish to pass messages to their

families or scare off enemies, but the Tuigan ghosts can be

vengeful. Travelers are warned to avoid anything appearing

insubstantial, even if on good standing with the local spirits.

What seems a guardian spirit of Rashemen may turn out to

be a years-dead raider from the Endless Waste looking to take

revenge for the failure of the Horde.

MINES OF TETHKEL

This large mine is the source of most of the countrys mineral

wealth, particularly iron. The place is big enough to have its

own settlement, and the miners prefer to live nearby rather

than travel back and forth every day or tenday. The miners

are a dangerous lot, more raucous, undisciplined, and savage

than most other Rashemi, but such qualities are necessary in

the middle of hostile territory. In addition to the obvious en-

vironmental dangers, the miners endure raids by kobolds and

goblins, attacks from winter wolves, and in recent times, in-

cursions of duergar from the south.

The miners are very tough, and fighting one another is a

favorite  pastime.  Boxing  and  wrestling  matches  are  a

common sport, with bouts held in the upper, depleted tunnels

of the mines. The miners scorn anyone they perceive as weak,

Feluccas are small two-masted vessels unique to Rashemen. A

felucca is roughly equivalent to a keelboat (see Ships in Chap-

ter 5: Campaigns in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide), but is

only  about  40  to  50  feet  in  length.  It  has  a  crew  of  six  to

twelve and can carry up to 35 tons of cargo. A felucca moves

at about 2 miles per hour.

Feluccas

132

RASHEMEN

and the easiest way for a visitor to gain their esteem is to put

up a good fight against the local champion. They consume an

immense amount of firewine (see Economy, below) and boast

that they drink more of it than any others in Rashemen.

MULSANYAAR PLATEAU

North of the Gorge of Gauros lies the Mulsanyaar Plateau, a

rugged  land  similar  in  appearance  and  topography  to  the

tharch of Gauros in Thay (see Chapter 11: Thay). The Mul-

sanyaar is actually the northernmost arm of the Plateau of

Thay, but the great gorge divides the Rashemi portion from

the rest of the Thayan plateau like a moat twenty miles wide.

Few Rashemi live in this southerly reach of the High Coun-

try,  leaving  the  Mulsanyaar  to  the  goblins  that  infest  the

region. The Iron Lord details several warbands of berserkers

to keep the goblins in check and to watch for signs of Thayan

movement in the Gorgeeven though the canyon is virtually

impassable, the zulkirs have tried to invade Rashemen by this

difficult path.

Under the lowering heights of Mount Omvulag stand the

black towers of Omvudurth, a sprawling citadel of crude dark

stone that marks the seat of the Omvurr, a great goblin chief-

tain.  The  Omvurr  (LE  male  goblin  Bbn4/Ftr6)  claims  the

entire plateau as his realm, but in practice, his warriors steer

clear of the Rashemi berserkers.

Lake Ashane

This icy body of water is also known as the Lake of Tears for

the battles fought on its shores centuries ago between Nar-

fell  and  Raumathar  (and  more  recently  by  the  Rashemi

against the Red Wizards and the Tuigan Horde). Formed of

runoff from the Icerim Mountains and possibly carved by a

glacier,  Lake  Ashane  is  notorious  for  its  cold  even  on  the

hottest days of summer. The water itself is deep, blue, and

beautiful. Ashane has no surface outlets, but somewhere near

its deepest point (almost a mile below the surface) it drains

to a vast underground sea in an unexplored portion of the

Underdark.

The lake itself is inhabited by nixies, nymphs, native water

elementals, and telthor fish, which protect the waters against

those who would drain or defile them. Few other creatures are

present  except  a  few  cold-tolerant  species  of  fish,  for  the

waters  are  too  cold  for  most  animals.  The  fey  and  telthors

serve  a  powerful  animal  spirit,  although  only  they  and  the

Witches know its name and nature.

With the exception of one trade-town, Kront, the western

shore of the lake is unpopulated, mainly because of its hor-

rible weather. The Rashemi shore has more settlements, in-

cluding the large communities of Immilmar and Mulsantir

and  many  villages  and  hamlets  scattered  between  them.

Most of the smaller communities survive by fishing the lake,

although gardening and small farms make them moderately

self-sufficient. Fishers take to the water in stout rowboats

or feluccas.

Terrible monsters crawl out of the Ashenwood to plague the

human settlements along the eastern shore. Because of these

frequent attacks, most nearby settlements have simple walls

and even watchtowers, with a higher proportion of combat-

ready men and women than usual. If a large number of mon-

sters attack, the townsfolk take to the water and harry the

invaders with arrows from boats.

Lake Mulsantir

Fed by three rivers, Lake Mulsantir is a turbulent muddle of

silty  runoff,  murky  depths,  and  strange  currents  that  can

overturn craft or suddenly sweep a person away. Its waters

flow north into Lake Ashane through a broad passage called

the River Mulsantir. Rashemen patrols the lake with magi-

cally animated witchboats, piloted by hathrans. (See Chapter

5: Magic items for more information.) The Mulsantir is less

cold than the Ashane and contains more varieties of fish, so

many fisherfolk work here despite the dangers.

Thay used to battle Rashemen for control of the lake, but

Thay has less lumber than Rashemen, and the witchboats are

far more maneuverable than any vessels of the Red Wizards.

Thay eventually stopped aggressive action on the lake, pre-

ferring to invade across the River Mulsantir to the north. The

Red Wizards dumped magically crossbred monsters into the

lake in hopes of upsetting the witchboats, but the currents and

cold made the monsters hug the southern shores and prey on

Thayan vessels and settlements, so they abandoned that prac-

tice. Boats disappear more often here than even the difficult

waters would explain, so it is likely that some of these crea-

tures remain and occasionally surface to grab a snack before

retreating to the comforting darkness.

Lake Tirulag

This body of water lies in the center of the most populous por-

tion of Rashemen amid the nations major waterway. Its water

is cold and filled with hardy trout, crayfish, and other tasty

creatures,  which  provide  sustenance  and  trade  for  a  large

number  of  Rashemi.  The  tradesfolk  who  harvest  the  lakes

bounty use typical Rashemi boats and ships, and they always

give  the  witchboats a  wide  berth,  particularly  empty  ones

moving under magical guidance, performing unknown tasks

for the hathrans.

Lake Tirulag is not as deadly cold as the Ashane, and brave

or foolhardy Rashemi use the lake to prove their toughness

and  endurance  in  bizarre  competitions.  They  strip  down  to

nothing and swim about, with victory going to whoever re-

mains in the water the longest. Occasionally contestants die,

but normally the worst result is blue-tinged skin for a while.

These  competitions  are  followed  by  feasts  and  drinking  in

well-heated lodges throughout the night.

Great treasure is said to lie at the bottom of the lake, al-

though its source has many explanations. Some say it is wealth

seized from those foolish enough to attack the Witches; others

claim  it  is  the  secret  hoard  of  a  mad  Nar  wizard;  and  yet

133

RASHEMEN

others  believe  it  is  a  gift  from  the  spirits  of  the  land  for

anyone brave enough to claim it. The treasure remains un-

claimed because its exact location is unknown, and a creature

known  as  the  ice  dragon  guards  it.  No  one  knows  its  exact

nature, but it is probably a mutant aquatic white dragon with

ice-clear scales that make it almost impossible to see without

magic. Strange patches of ice appear on the surface of the lake

at all times of the year, usually with a hapless foreigner frozen

to death inside, a victim of the dragons icy breath. The crea-

ture  is  under  the  control  of  the  hathrans,  or  at  least  ac-

knowledges their power, and leaves normal Rashemi alone.

The North Country

Spoken of as if it were a different land, the North Country ac-

counts for almost two-thirds of Rashemens territory. The site

of many battles between old Narfell and Raumathar, the place

is scattered with old ruins and decrepit fortresses of those dead

empires. Rashemi nobles explore these dangerous sites to prove

their bravery and bring back great treasures. Few survive, but

the reward of ancient treasure is worth the great risk.

Few people live in the North Country. Those who do inhabit

small, isolated farming settlements as far as possible from the

nearest  ruin.  The  local  people  have  many  stories  about  the

ruins  and  those  who  explored  them,  but  only  a  handful  of

these describe nobles returning laden with gold, weapons, and

magic. Rumors about the nearby sites are almost always tales

handed  down  from  earlier  generations,  for  no  sensible

person would approach such places.

THE RING OF GRAY FLAMES

Raumathari ruins are usually clusters of tall towers, most of

which are fallen or severely damaged. Guarded by lethal and

large-scale battle-spells, some leach magic into the nearby area,

creating  odd  effects  and  mutating  natural  creatures.  Their

treasures are usually spells designed to slaughter large num-

bers of foes or items that augment sorcerers magic. One ruin,

called the Towers of Smoke by the nearby villagers, constantly

leaks a plume of deadly vapors (equivalent to a cloudkill spell)

and is said to be guarded by iron golems of many sizes.

The most famous ruin is the Ring of Gray Flames, a circle

of five narrow towers, each with a harsh gray fire burning

atop it. The flame emits only a feeble light but disrupts divine

magic  brought  near  it.  Occasionally,  grinding  noises  can  be

heard  within  the  two  intact  towers.  The  countryside  sur-

rounding the towers is roamed by spell wards, free-willed mag-

ical constructs that seem to be spells given life.

THE FORTRESS OF THE HALF-DEMON

Nar ruins are squat fortresses with many underground levels

used  for  summoning  terrible  beings.  Protected  by  powerful

glyphs, chained demons, and imprisoned spirits, some still con-

tain portals into the Abyss and the Nine Hells, although the

keys  have  been  lost.  Nar  structures  usually  hold  devices  to

summon and banish demons, as well as repositories for scrolls

of lost clerical spells.

The Fortress of the Half-Demon is so named for the rem-

nants of a gigantic iron gate made in the shape of a huge de-

monic  face.  It  may  still  be  the  home  of  fiendish  and  half-

fiendish creatures that cannot leave their place of summon-

ing. The Fortress of the Half-Demon is currently the strong-

hold of Losk (CE male hagspawn Ftr4/Wiz9), a warrior-mage

who leads a vicious group of brigands.

The Running Rocks

These granite peaks form a spur of the mountains that define

the High Country. The lower reaches have a few quarries and

mines for copper and iron, but the rest of the mountains are

avoided by normal Rashemi. The upper mountains have a mys-

tical reputation and are thought to harbor violent spirits that

dump rocks on visitors rather than accept offerings. As well,

trolls  and  bheur  hags  plague  the  region.  Unknown  to  most

except the Witches, these mountains are the secret lairs of the

vremyonni, or  Old  Ones,  male  Rashemi  wizards  who  manu-

facture magic items for the Witches and train the young re-

cruits  in  arcane  magic.  The  caves  of  the  Old  Ones  are  well

guarded by rare spells and sealed with great stone doors that

require the proper magical command word to open.

IMMIL VALE

Along the northern edge of the Running Rocks is a deep fis-

sure in the earth known as Immil Vale. No matter the season

or  temperature  above,  this  place  is  continually  warm  and

green. Grass, flowers, and trees grow everywhere, and crystal-

clear streams are free of ice year-round. Many kinds of col-

orful birds nest here that live nowhere else in Rashemen, while

deer  and  small  animals  live  in  the  underbrush,  hunted  by

small predators such as lynxes.

Legend has it that the goddess of magic blessed this place with

protection from the cold so the Rashemi would always have a

vision of spring even in the heart of winter. The real explanation

is mundanesubterranean volcanic activity heats underground

water, keeping the vale warm and creating many hot springs,

which emit clouds of steam. Fortunately, these springs are not

tainted with the brimstone stench of some volcanic vents, so the

air is pleasant. Sometimes the vale fills with mist, giving it an

ethereal quality and enhancing its magical reputation.

Many spirits live here, bound to the trees and stones. One

famous  spot  is  the  Mosstone,  a  huge  moss-covered  piece  of

rock  near  the  center  of  the  vale.  Those  who  camp  in  the

stones  shadow  are  blessed  with  prophetic  dreams  and  are

sometimes  visited  by  Hulmarra  Murnyetha  (N  female

telthor  human  Rgr9),  a  beautiful  and  skilled  Rashemi

tracker killed by a Red Wizard over two hundred years ago.

She was fond of visiting the rock, and after she died, her spirit

found its way back to it. Hulmarra sometimes steals away vis-

iting men who remind her of her long-dead husband, return-

ing them years later looking not a day older.

The Ring of Gray Flames

Another notable feature is the Red Tree, a large aspen with

about half its leaves turning colors as if it were autumn. The

spirits  of  two  WitchesImsha  (LN  female  telthor  human

Sor4/Clr3/Hth1  of  Chauntea)  and  Tamlith  (LN  female

telthor human Sor3/Clr4/Hth1 of Mystra)are tied to the

tree and give advice to other Witches who visit them. The spir-

its dislike idle chatter and only speak of important things, par-

ticularly involving the safety of Rashemen.

In addition to the spirits described above, many telthors and

thomils  inhabit  the  vale  and  vigorously  defend  it  from  ag-

gressors. The Witches are on good terms with the spirits and

elementals, and can sometimes convince telthors to undertake

short missions outside of the vale but within the spirit crea-

tures safe distance.

Urlingwood

This forest north of the Sunrise Mountains is dense and wild.

It could be considered the mystical heart of Rashemen, for the

Witches  hold  their  most  secret  meetings  in  this  place  and

allow no person to enter who is not part of their sisterhood.

The penalty for violating this prohibition is death, and the

Witches are not lenient to anyone, even first offenders, the

lost, or the ignorant. Because of this extreme law, warriors and

scouts of the Iron Lord patrol the perimeter of the forest to

warn away those who might brave its dangers. The Witches

are not cruel; after questioning (not torturing) violators, they

put them to death in a quick and humane manner (often using

sleep spells or drugs first). They confiscate any property and

then take the bodies to the edge of the forest for disposal by

the perimeter guardians.

Normally, the Witches do not have to slay intruders them-

selves.  All  the  native  telthors  are  absolutely  loyal  to  the

hathrans and either attack those who cannot prove themselves

to be Witches or inform larger telthors or the hathrans about

them. In the cold season, the telthors are aided by orglashes.

Large sections of the forest are warded by alarm spells en-

hanced  by  circle  magic,  and  particularly  secret  areas  are

guarded with dangerous glyphs, similarly enhanced.

In addition to their private councils, the Witches come here

to commune with the guardians of the land, make offerings,

bind  and  control  excessively  hostile  spirits,  and  brew  the

famous Rashemi firewine. In meetings, they discuss happen-

ings  within  Rashemen,  receive  reports  from  hathrans  re-

turning from abroad, use scrying magic on the Red Wizards,

and plan for the needs of the people in the upcoming season.

Young ethrans who have come of age are ordained within the

Urlingwood before taking their first journey outside of Rashe-

men, and young men who are to join the Old Ones are brought

here to receive the blessing of the spirits before going into iso-

lation in the Running Rocks. When not in council or travel-

ing, most of the Witches live in the nearby town of Urling.

135

RASHEMEN

People of

Rashemen

The people of Rashemen are sturdy, hardworking, and deeply

respectful of the land. A traveler here will never see a logger

casually cutting down trees for greater profit, nor a stream

dammed to power a mill. The Rashemi understand that they

must respect the land as they would a neighbor, for the spir-

its punish those who take what they dont need.

Rashemi are a short, hardy folk, built for strength rather

than speed. Men grow beards but keep them trimmed short.

Both sexes keep their hair long: The men wear a pair of thick

braids, while the women have only one. The length of ones

hair is a measure of status, in marked contrast to the shaven-

headed Red Wizards. The penalty for adultery in many villages

is  to  have  ones  hair  cut  short,  and  others  shun  shorthaired

Rashemi for this crime against the family.

Typical Rashemi dress is simple, made of wool, leather, and

pelts.  Men  wear  trousers,  loose  shirts,  and  fur  vests,  while

women  dress  in  long  woolen  skirts  and  blouses  of  linen.  In

times of celebration, both sexes dress colorfully, preferring

vests and blouses of red, blue, and yellow, embroidered in red,

white, and green. Rashemen is relatively poor in metal, and

most  of  that  goes  to  making  weapons,  tools,  and  armor,  so

Rashemi jewelry is made of carved stone, bones, and ivory dec-

orated with complex patterns and runic markings. These pieces

are often used as trade goods.

Long ago, these people were forced to defend themselves

against the greed of Narfell and Raumathar, two magical

nations  that  constantly  fought  each  other,  usually  in  the

lands the Rashemi called home. This ongoing battle against

aggressive  neighbors  turned  the  Rashemi  into  insular  war-

riors, distrustful of outlanders and honoring kinfolk who de-

stroyed  the  most  enemies.  That  mentality  persists  today,

fueled by the greedy attacks of the Red Wizards and Rashe-

mens relative isolation. With such a history, it is no surprise

Berserker Lodges

The berserkers of Rashemen are organized into lodges named

after local creatures. These represent an extended family, and

a  member  of  a  given  lodge  in  one  village  can  always  find

friends and a place to sleep in the appropriate lodge-house of

another village. A lodge also focuses on special skills, weap-

ons, or fighting styles, all based on the creature from which

it takes its name. Some lodges are larger and better known

than othersthe Great Stag and Wolf lodges have a presence

in many settlements, while a smaller lodge may only exist in

one tiny village.

The  lodge-house  itself  is  a  typical  Rashemi  edifice  that

serves  as  a  tavern,  boarding  house,  and  meeting  place  for

members. Many Rashemi berserkers live in their lodge-house,

while others visit regularly to drink with their friends, and

still others come only when trouble is brewing and they are

needed. Each lodge-house is watched over by a telthor, usually

of  the  creature  bearing  the  lodges  name,  which  warns  the

berserkers of approaching danger.

Members of the lodges honor and respect one another as

brothers (and sisters, for women are not excluded), although

there is much rivalry for skill at fighting, hunting, wrestling,

jumping, swimming, and feats of strength. To join a lodge, a

character must demonstrate the ability to fly into a barbar-

ian rage and pass through a ritual of initiation. This ranges

from an all-night drinking contest to a single-handed battle

against  every  other  member  of  the  lodge  (usually  dealing

subdual  damage,  but  not  always).  An  outlander  must  know

something  of  Rashemen  and  its  ways  to  join  (2  ranks  in

Knowledge [localRashemen]), and must have proved his or

her worth in battle against the enemies of Rashemen.

Some of the better-known lodges follow. Each has a gift or

fighting  style  that  is  reflected  in  a  feat  listed  in  Chapter  3:

Regions and Feats. Only members of a particular lodge may

learn that lodges feat. It is possible for a berserker to change

lodges,  and  there  is  no  stigma  in  doing  so.  Changing  lodges

does not prevent a berserker from using his old lodges fight-

ing style.

Ettercap: These  strange  berserkers  undertake  grueling

tasks  that  would  kill  a  normal  human,  including  subjecting

themselves  to  various  animal  poisons.  Their  lodge-house

guardian is usually a telthor horse.

Great Stag: These berserkers charge recklessly into combat

and often rush opponents through ranks of their own allies.

Their telthor guardian is always a stag.

Ice  Troll: The  members  of  this  lodge  toughen  their  skin

with strange draughts and frequent exposure to frozen con-

ditions.  They  shrug  off  hits  that  would  disable  a  normal

person.  A  telthor  badger  normally  guards  Ice  Troll  lodge-

houses.

Owlbear: Members  of  this  lodge  practice  wrestling  and

take pride in their ability to bring down creatures larger than

themselves. Some wear armor spikes to more easily damage

their foes. The telthor of a lodge-house is usually a bear or

large owl.

Snow Tiger: These berserkers wear the skins and claws of

snow tigers, wading into combat with the ferocity and skill of

their  spirit  animal.  The  claws  are  weapons,  treated  as  claw

bracers,  and  can  be  enhanced  as  if  they  were  masterwork

items.  A  telthor  snow  tiger  is  always  the  guardian  of  the

lodge-house.

Wolf: Like their spirit animal, Wolf lodge berserkers are

fond of laying out their opponents and then chopping them

to  pieces  while  theyre  down.  Telthor  wolves  protect  their

lodge-houses.

RASHEMEN

that the Rashemi glorify personal strength and shun people

who are not like them.

Life and Society

Races and Cultures

Given their remote location and the natural barriers that pre-

vent easy communications with other lands, it is not surpris-

ing  the  people  of  Rashemen  are  almost  exclusively  human.

Although of the same racial stock as the Rashemi of Thay,

they spit at the suggestion that they are related to weaklings

who allowed themselves to be enslaved. The people of Rashe-

men are taller and paler than their Thayan cousins and can

easily recognize someone from the land to the south.

As a warrior culture, the Rashemi see competition as a way

to define status and honor, as well as to release pent-up ag-

gression. Rashemi compete in nonlethal tests of strength, skill,

and  endurance,  leaving  overt  hostility  for  their  enemies.

Rashemen would never host a gladiatorial arena, but many

settlements  have  regular  athletic  competitions  where  con-

testants  pummel  one  another  into  submission  in  hopes  of

achieving higher esteem among their peers.

For a country that always has a male leader and laws en-

forced by an exclusive group of female spellcasters, Rashemi

are surprisingly egalitarian. Most warriors and berserkers are

male, as are most craftsfolk in demanding fields such as black-

smithing,  but  women  with  the  necessary  skill  are  not

shunned  or  ridiculed,  and  the  lodges  that  train  Rashemens

berserkers welcome anyone with an interest in fighting.

While  martial  skill  is  respected  among  the  Rashemi,  the

ability to go berserk against ones enemies is the mark of an

elite combatant. Berserkers have the highest status of any class

or group in Rashemen other than the Witches. Fangs (mili-

tary units of ten to fifty berserkers) practice similar fighting

styles. Each village has one or more fangs, each tied to a par-

ticular berserker lodge (see the Berserker Lodges sidebar).

The people of Rashemen prefer to live their own lives with-

out interference and invasions from hostile neighbors. How-

ever,  as  long  as  the  Red  Wizards  control  Thay,  that  is  not

likely to happen, so the Rashemi spend their lives in a near-

constant anticipation of attack. This makes life very tense, so

the  people  throw  themselves  into  work  and  recreation  to

forget about the constant threat. Rashemi work hard to sur-

vive in their harsh and beautiful home, and they play hard to

lighten their hearts.

Even within their own land, the Rashemi are surrounded

by  strange  and  potentially  hostile  powersspirits  in  the

very rocks, trees, and waters. A Rashemi is trained at a very

young  age  to  avoid  certain  landmarks,  to  leave  gifts  for

helpful spirits, and to ask permission of the telthors before

touching anything in an unfamiliar place. The relationship

with the spirits is a strange one, for while Rashemi fear of-

fending them, they also love the spirits for their power to

protect the land.

The people have a similar relationship with the Witches.

The hathrans are mysterious, always wearing masks when in

Rashemen, and have the power of life and death. They wield

powerful magic that can burn out a mans mind or reduce a

womans body to dust in an instant, and they are feared for

these things. The hathrans also commune with the spirits and

placate them when they are angry, sparing the common folk

their wrath. They defend against the magic of the Red Wiz-

ards  and  name  the  Iron  Lord,  the  face  of  leadership  in

Rashemen. These earn the peoples respect. But most of all, the

Rashemi love the Witches because they come from the ranks

of their own sisters and daughters.

Among the Rashemi, berserkers are universally honored.

In  a  warrior  culture  that  values  strength,  endurance,  and

skill, the berserkers embody the highest ideal of those things,

primal  and  powerful.  They  lead  the  fight  against  enemies

Jhuild(Rashemi Firewine)

This dark reddish brew is made from certain grapes, fruits,

and  herbs  grown  near  the  city  of  Urling.  It  is  a  common

drink for wealthier berserkers. Like alcoholic drinks, jhuild is

technically a poison, and a character who drinks it must suc-

ceed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC 12) to avoid its effect;

those  who  desire  it  may  voluntarily  fail  this  saving  throw.

Upon drinking firewine, the character takes 1 point of tem-

porary Wisdom damage. One minute later, the drinker gains

a +2 bonus to Strength, which lasts for 2 hours.

Once  the  Strength  bonus  wears  off,  the  user  must  make

another Fortitude saving throw (DC 20) or immediately fall

unconscious  for  3d4  hours.  Whether  or  not  that  save  suc-

ceeds,  the  user  takes  a  2  penalty  on  attacks,  saves,  and

checks  for  the  next  12  hours.  It  is  not  possible  to  become

addicted to jhuild or overdose on it (although a person might

incapacitate  himself  by  drinking  enough  to  reduce  his

Wisdom score to 0).

A  bottle  of  jhuild  costs  70  gp  in  Rashemen,  but  in  other

countries, it can cost 100 gp or more because of its scarcity.

Nonberserkers are usually content to drink a weakened form

of firewine diluted with ale, which sells for 2 sp a tankard in

Rashemen, 7 to 15 gp elsewhere. This weak brew has almost

the same flavor as the true drink but does not grant a Strength

bonus  or  cause  unconsciousness.  Visitors  to  Rashemen  who

believe themselves accustomed to jhuild are surprised to find

they have been drinking the diluted version. This causes no end

of amusement to the Rashemi, especially in a drinking contest

with a berserker.

137

and are the face of the Rashemi people to all inside and out-

side the land. Although the Witches are the real power in

Rashemen, they are wise enough to elect a berserker as leader

of the people.

The Witches test all children at a young ageless than

ten years oldfor aptitude in magic. Those who pass these

tests are taken away from their parents to be trained with

the Old Ones, male Rashemi of great age and magical power.

The Witches are not cruel or secretive; the families know

what is to become of their child and that she will become a

person of power and influence. The family is

always compensated, usually with live-

stock, tools, or an orphaned child of

similar age.

Both boys and girls train. The girls

are  taught  the  deep  tenets  of  Rashe-

mens  religion  in  preparation  for  be-

coming hathrans, while the boys study

only  arcane  magic.  Upon  reaching

adulthood  (age  twenty  in  Rashe-

men), girls are normally ordained as

ethrans. Some choose to return to

their  home  villages  as  practicing

mages  or  healers,  but  they  are

always  potential  recruits  for  a

hathran  in  need.  The  boys  are

given  a  choice  when  they  reach

adulthood:  Join  the  Old  Ones,

or  leave  Rashemen  forever

under a geas to never reveal

their  secrets.  Most  choose  to

remain  and  may  eventually

become  Old  Ones  themselves.

Those who leave usually practice

their magic in distant lands.

An  important  aspect  of  the

Rashemi  way  of  life  is  the  da-

jemma,  a  journey  of  self-discov-

ery that all young men must take

before  being  considered  adults

(women may take this journey as well, but it

is not required). In days of old, young Rashemi

nobles  made  the  dajemma  to  visit  strange

lands, slaying horrible monsters and wicked warlords, but now

it  is  mostly  an  exercise  in  drinking  and  sightseeing.  It  also

helps Rashemen build trade contacts with the outside world.

The  hathrans  require  all  young  ethrans  to  go  on  a  journey

(usually in groups) to learn about the outside world and report

on current events.

Other than the dajemma, few Rashemi leave their home-

land for any length of time. Foreigners within Rashemens

borders are a curiosityand not a welcome one. Visitors get

many suspicious looks, and mages and obvious spellcasters

of non-Rashemi faiths gain hostile stares, for the locals dis-

like  anyone  other  than  the  Witches  practicing  magic  in

their land.

RASHEMEN

ECONOMY

Blocked in by mountains, icy lakes, and haunted forests, Rashe-

men has to fend for itself in most things. Its people raise herd

beasts (cattle, sheep, and surface roth), hunt wild game, fish,

and grow crops in the short summer. They trade with the car-

avans that come through their country on the Golden Way,

offering wool, carved items, furs, firewine, and their famous

smoky cheese in exchange for cloth, wood products, and foods

they  cannot  find  in  their  own  land.  Rashemi  have

limited options: They cannot pro-

duce  enough  excess  to  simply  buy

what  they  wish,  and  they  are  un-

willing  to  trade,  sell,  or  lend  the

things  that  others  really  want  (magic,

lumber,  and  skilled  berserkers).

Rashemen  could  greatly  benefit

from a portal to a large city out-

side  their  homeland,  but  the

Witches  have  little  interest  in

that  sort  of  magic  and  are  un-

likely to allow another person to

create such a portal for fear of

unwanted visitors.

The most popular export of

Rashemen is jhuildRashemi

firewinea powerful draught

that boosts strength and dulls

the senses. The full-strength

drink is very expensive, but

a  watered-down  version  is

affordable to those who have

a taste for the exotic. As it is

customary to bring a bottle of

full-strength  jhuild  on  a  da-

jemma,  many  young  Rashemi

have quickly become popular and

made  some  coin  in  an  emer-

gency  just  by  sharing  the

potent drink with their hosts.

LAW AND ORDER

Rashemen is governed by a simple set of laws, primarily con-

cerned  with  safeguarding  people  and  property.  The  legal

system relies on common sense, which is in good supply despite

the number of hotheads in the land. The code of laws takes up

less than two written pages, which is fortunate, because a ma-

jority of Rashemi are illiterate. The laws also exist in song,

making them easier for the common folk to remember.

Do not kill or deliberately injure another Rashemi. Save your

anger for your true enemies.

Do  not  steal  from  your  fellow  Rashemi  or  outsiders  with

honor. To do so is to taint your own honor.

138

RASHEMEN

Respect your family, the spirits, and the deities, for they guard

your soul in this life and after.

Respect  the  spirits  of  your  home,  for  they  guard  the  land

when you sleep.

Obey the Iron Lord, for the safety of all Rashemen is his re-

sponsibility.

Obey the Witches, for they are the bond that ties the people

to the land and the Iron Lord to the people.

Be strong, resolute, and courageous, for the weak, lazy, and

craven betray the spirit of the Rashemi people.

DEFENSE AND WARCRAFT

Most  of  Rashemens  soldiers  are  warriors  and  berserkers.

Unlike in most other countries, the standard leader or elite

member of an army is not a fighter but a barbarian. Rashe-

mens warriors favor light and medium armor for mobility

and stealth, dressing for concealment in snowbanks when en-

emies approach. The military is divided into units called fangs,

which serve together as members of the same berserker lodge.

Warriors  support  the  berserkers  with  ranged  fire  or  follow

them to deal with foes left alive after the initial charge. Some

units ride small mountain ponies to reach the front lines or

to deploy ranged weapons, but they dismount for battle be-

cause the ponies are not suitable combat mounts.

Although the berserkers are terrible to behold, they rarely

use group tactics. They generally advance as a screaming mass

to tear holes in the enemy lines, which is effective but costly.

It is the Witches who make the berserkers successful in war,

using powerful place magic and summoning great spirits to

attack and terrify the enemy forces, taking advantage of the

berserkers initial successes. They also use the witchboats to

deploy forces rapidly into key locations, utilizing their great

mobility to place shock troops where they are needed.

Most communities in Rashemen have defensive walls. With

the cessation of attacks by the Red Wizards, the Rashemi are

enhancing and expanding their southern fortifications, often

with spells such as wall of stone. As much as they hope for an

end to centuries of war with the Thayans, the Rashemi have

lived with their hostile neighbors for too long to believe they

could change their colors so easily.

The Rashemi are generally content to defend their own bor-

ders and rarely invade neighboring lands. On the rare occa-

sions when large numbers of Rashemens warriors did leave

their homes for war, it was always to make a punitive strike

against  an  enemy  fortification  in  retaliation  for  an  attack

against Rashemen. The Rashemi, and the berserkers in par-

ticular, feel there is no honor in slaying commoners barely

able to defend themselves; they prefer to take out their ag-

gression on military targets.

RELIGION

The Rashemi are a devout people, involving religion in every

aspect of their daily life, for they venerate the spirits of the

land  as  minor  deities.  Rashemi  religion  focuses  on  the

ThreeBhalla  (Chauntea),  Mielikki,  and  the  Hidden  One

(Mystra)but also honors telthors and famous heroes. Most

of the spirits are not known by name, except for very old ones

with recognizable personalities. Most people do not meet the

spirits in person but instead seek their signs, which are inter-

preted as miraculous occurrences and omens. Celebrated heroes

are believed to serve the Three in the afterlife as generals,

strategists, and messengers. They are rarely seen except in fan-

tastic displays of hathran magic such as the planar ally spell.

All Rashemi respect the hathrans in their role as speakers to

the divine (whether deities or spirits). The younger divine spell-

casters  (ethrans  who  have  not  yet  become  hathrans)  are  re-

sponsible  for  most  spiritual  guidance  and  healing,  much  like

clerics and druids in other lands. This frees up the hathrans to

concentrate on greater matters, such as battling the Red Wiz-

ards, thwarting the bheur hags, and guarding Rashemen. Only

when an ethrans power is insufficient to minister to the peoples

needs (such as in the case of a plague) are the hathrans called in.

THE WYCHLARAN

The wychlaran (wise old women) are the spiritual guides of

the Rashemi people, watching over their souls and communi-

cating  with  the  spirits  of  the  land.  The  formal  term  for  a

member of this group is hathran (learned sister), although

the Red Wizards and others call them the Witches of Rashe-

men, a term the women use informally themselves. All female

spellcasters in Rashemen, arcane or divine, fall into one of the

four following ranks: unproven, ethran, hathran, or othlor.

The  unproven  are  those  female  spellcasters  who  do  not

choose to become ethrans. (In game terms, these are Rashemi

spellcasters who do not take the Ethran feat.) A number of

adepts and minor spellcasters fall into this category, women

who simply do not have the inclination or aptitude for fur-

ther  study.  These  women  are  generally  left  alone  by  the

Witches to practice their magic as they see fit, so long as they

do not claim the privileges and authority of a true Witch.

Ethrans are low-ranking initiates of any arcane or divine

spellcasting class, although most are clerics or sorcerers. (To

become an ethran, a character must choose the Ethran feat.)

An ethran is a Witch and bears the full responsibility and au-

thority  that  goes  along  with  the  title,  although  she  must

defer  to  the  hathrans  and  othlors.  There  are  thousands  of

ethrans, although most are little more than village healers or

spirit-talkers.

Hathrans are the leaders of the sisterhood. (To become a

hathran,  a  character  must  acquire  at  least  one  level  in  the

hathran prestige class.) A hathran can do no wrong in Rashe-

men; her word is law, and to disobey her is death. There are

about three hundred hathrans scattered over the country and

elsewhere in Faern; the actual number is a carefully guarded

secret of the sisterhood.

The wisest and most experienced hathrans carry the title of

othlor (true one). No more than a dozen or so othlors exist

at any one time, although the title is freely awarded to any

sister who merits it.

139

RASHEMEN

THE VREMYONNI

While the wychlaran serve Rashemen as judges, rulers, priests,

and  warriors,  men  with  spellcasting  ability  are  segregated

from  their  kin  as  vremyonni, or  Old  Ones.  Divine  spell-

casters such as clerics or druids are not required to set them-

selves  apart  in  this  way,  but  Rashemi  expect  wychlaran  to

placate the spirits and intercede with the gods, so male cler-

ics or druids do not have a role in society. Most become her-

mits or eventually join a berserker lodge (after multiclassing

as barbarians) and become advisors to these elite brotherhoods.

Men  who  happen  to  be  arcane  spellcasters  have  no  such

option. They must secret themselves among the hidden vil-

lages and cavern strongholds of the vremyonni, or they must

leave Rashemen. To refuse this command is death. Most Old

Ones  accept  this  as  the  way  of  things  and  do  not  begrudge

their seclusion. In their hidden refuges, they become expert

weaponsmiths and item-crafters, creating potent magic weap-

ons for the berserkers and wychlaran in defense of the land.

On  very  rare  occasions,  when  Rashemen  faces  the  direst

threats, vremyonni take the field and march to war alongside

the wychlaran. Masked like their hathran sisters, each binds

himself to a hathran with a short length of silken cord, and

the paired spellcasters work as deadly teams.

Adventurers

True adventurerspeople who wander about solving problems

and investigating strange old ruinsare rare in Rashemen, for

most get such urges out of their system in the dajemma. Most

adventurers  within  Rashemen  are  nobles  (usually  men  and

women born of powerful and influential berserkers) who un-

dertake dangerous quests to prove their fitness and courage.

Adventurers from other lands are viewed with as much sus-

picion as any foreigner unless traveling with a hathran or re-

spected berserker. Such folk are uncommon, although they are

sometimes  seen  along  the  Golden  Way,  acting  as  caravan

guards or heading to explore remote dungeons. Adventurers

are most common in the North Country, where the locals are

happy to point strangers toward the nearest ruin just to get

rid of them.

Most settlements in Rashemen have only one small estab-

lishment for dealing with foreign adventurers (locals can usu-

ally stay with family or at a berserker lodge-house). Mulptan

and Shevel are the exceptions, having become used to caravan

traffic and strange faces. Visiting adventurers are often forced

to sleep outside, as no right-minded Rashemi would even lend

a barn to someone who may be a spy for the Red Wizards.

Many  adventurers  freeze  to  death  in  the  colder  months,

unused to such a reception and unprepared for the extreme

temperature.

All strangers are encouraged to move along after a couple

of  days,  and  foreign  spellcasters  are  advised  to  use  as  little

magic as possible within Rashemens borders for fear of up-

setting the locals, spirits, and Witches.

Politics and Power

Rashemen has had the same form of government for over

1,400 years. Not long after the empires of Narfell and Rau-

mathar collapsed, the tribes of the Rashemi were united with

the  help  of  a  mysterious  band  of  women  spellcasters,  the

wychlaran. The women swore to protect Rashemen, its people,

and its native spirits until the end of the world. In exchange,

they asked only for the power to choose Rashemens kings and

war leaders. The Rashemi, having seen how effectively the

wychlaran battled against the Nars and Raumathari, grate-

fully agreed, and the first Iron Lord was selected sometime

around seventy-five years before the start of the Dalereck-

oning calendar.

History of Rashemen

Rashemens  history  is  a  long  series  of  invasions  by  hostile

neighbors, followed by the invaders defeat by berserker fury

and  hathran  magic.  These  enemies  include  old  Narfell  and

Raumathar, Mulhorand (seeking to expand its holdings from

its  northernmost  territory),  the  Tuigan  Horde,  and  Thay,

which  is  responsible  for  at  least  twenty  major  invasion  at-

tempts in the past 450 years. Because Rashemen is isolated and

communicates little with the outside world, the details of most

of these attacks are not well known, but the following events

have become common knowledge.

and unite them beneath his rule.

The Nentyarchs armies destroy Shandaular, capital of

Ashanath; all Nar kingdoms are united.

The Raumvirans establish the realm of Raumathar,

stroy each other with terrible magic. Rashemen is rav-

aged by demons and destructive spells.

Year of the Black Marble: Rashemen falls under the

rule of the demon lord Eltab.

Witches,  Yvengi  defeats  Eltab  and  frees  Rashemen

from demonic rule. Mulhorand invades Rashemen but

is driven off by the combined efforts of the berserk-

ers  and  Witches.  The  Witches  demand  the  right  to

name the Iron Lord of Rashemen.

Year  of  the  Cowled  Defender:  Bregg  the  Strong,  a

mighty  berserker,  launches  a  rebellion  against  the

Witches when they refuse to name him Iron Lord on

the  death  of  the  previous  lord.  Berserkers  loyal  to

Bregg cut down dozens of hathrans in the first hours

of his revolt.

Year  of  Coiled  Smoke:  Breggs  rebellion  is  finally

crushed. The hathrans take to wearing masks as a con-

sequence of Breggs war.

Year of the Fanged Horde: A mighty host of orcs de-

scends on Rashemen from the Sunrise Mountains but

is driven off.

Year of the Coven: The durthans, a secret sect within

the wychlaran, attempt to overthrow the order and

seize Rashemen. Strife between the hathrans and their

dark  sisters  lasts  for  decades,  but  the  durthans  are

eventually driven out.

Year of the Spouting Fish: The wizards of Thay rebel

against Mulhorandi rule and sack the provincial cap-

ital at Delhumide.

Year of Fell Wizardry: The Red Wizards launch their

first invasion of Rashemen but are repelled.

Year of the Serpent: The Tuigan Horde attacks Thay.

Zulkir Szass Tam arranges a truce with the Tuigans

and builds a great portal to transport them north to

Rashemen.  The  Tuigans  besiege  and  destroy  Citadel

Rashemar,  with  the  main  force  moving  west  across

the  High  Country  to  attack  forces  rallied  by  the

Witches at the Lake of Tears. Pinned by the Thayan

army south of Lake Mulsantir, the largest force of

Rashemi berserkers is unable to support the Witches,

who can only delay the immense horde.

Year  of  the  Turret:  Winter  snows  hold  the  Thayan

army in place, allowing the berserkers to move north

again  and  attack  the  unsuspecting  Tuigans  in  their

camps.  The  Battle  of  the  Lake  of  Tears  forces  the

Horde to fall back. The Red Wizards part the waters

of Ashane to allow the Tuigans to retreat. The Rash-

emi  do  not  pursue.  The  Tuigans  are  eventually  de-

feated  in  Thesk  by  a  multinational  army  rallied  by

King Azoun IV of Cormyr.

Year of the Helm: Thay attempts to invade Rashemen

by  moving  forces  through  Thesk  along  the  Golden

Way, but they are overwhelmed by water elementals

summoned by the Witches. The Thayans retreat after

using magic to scorch the western shore to bare rock.

The Witches spend a month repairing the damage.

Year  of  the  Wyvern:  An  unusually  cold  winter  in

Rashemen allows a large number of cold-loving crea-

tures to move southward from the Icerim mountains

into the North Country and beyond.

east, while Red Wizards melt glaciers in the Icerim

Mountains, causing severe flooding in Immilmar and

Mulsantir.  While  the  hathrans  are  distracted,  the

Thayan forces cross the foothills of the High Coun-

try but are driven back by angry elementals.

Year of the Staff: Thesk offers to improve part of the

road along the Golden Way to facilitate traffic. The

Witches accept the offer under certain conditions of

construction, and the building begins in late summer.

Year  of  the  Shield:  The  road  builders  complete  the

stretch from Mulsantir to Tinner.

Year of the Banner: Thay causes chaos in Rashemen

by  igniting  the  western  portion  of  the  Ashenwood,

driving its fell creatures eastward into civilized areas.

During the confusion, gangs of cutthroats teleport to

Mulsantir and Immilmar to slay important Rashemi

but are cut down by berserkers.

Year of the Gauntlet: Increased eastward trade inspires

merchants from other countries to establish outposts

in  Rashemen.  One  group  of  settlers  are  shield

dwarves.  The  local  Rashemi  welcome  the  dwarves

after testing their ability to forge, fight, and drink.

Year of the Tankard: Thay attempts to invade Rashe-

men  by  crossing  Lake  Mulsantir  on  magically

crafted  boats,  but  a  storm  created  by  the  hathrans

dashes their vessels against the southern shore.

Year  of  the  Unstrung  Harp:  Thydrim  Yvarrg,  Iron

Lord  of  Rashemen,  is  slain  by  a  Thayan  assassin.

Rather than raising him from the dead, the Witches

opt to replace him with Volas Dyervolk, whom they

feel will chafe less under their guidance.

Year of Wild Magic: Current year. Khalia, a Thayan

emissary,  approaches  Mulsantir  under  the  flag  of

peace and asks permission to create an enclave. She is

refused but allowed to leave safely. The return of Bane

puts the hathrans on alert for any news of Banite ac-

tivity in the area.

Government

At its simplest, each community is led by a fyrra (lord or

war leader), usually a warrior of renown from a clan of good

standing. Technically, a fyrra wields power only over the sol-

diers he trains and commands, but he often keeps the peace

and settles matters of traditional law and judgment. A fyrra

is advised by the Witches and normally defers to their judg-

ment. The fyrras of each settlement report to the Huhrong,

or Iron Lord, the highest-ranking leader in Rashemen.

The Iron Lord is always a man, chosen by the Witches, and

rules at their whim; they may replace him at any time. The

Iron Lord is expected to rule wisely and in the best interests

of the people of Rashemen. It is his duty to keep travel between

settlements reasonably safe, secure the frontiers, and control

raiding  monsters  from  the  wilder  parts  of  the  country.  In

times of invasion, the Iron Lord is the supreme warlord of all

141

RASHEMEN

Rashemens forces except the Witches, who usually follow his

suggestions as if they were orders.

The  Iron  Lord  represents  the  physical  ideal  of  Rashemi

men and personifies all their virtues: He should be able to out-

fight, out-ski, outswim, outdrink, and outrun all his warlords.

In  practice,  no  Iron  Lord  has  been  able  to  do  this,  though

many have come close.

Justice in Rashemen is swift and precise. People who steal

have their property confiscated. People who kill are killed or

exiled. The Witches dispose of people who offend them or the

spirits. Fortunately, most problems in Rashemen are the result

of drunken brawls and lusty spouses, and such things can usu-

ally be worked out without serious harm to either party.

The  absolute  rulers  in  Rashemen  are  the  Witches.  They

prefer to remain behind the scenes, but if thwarted in their

tasksmost  involving  the  safety  of  Rashementhey  are

ruthless in eliminating a potential spy or traitor. The Witches

have the power of life and death over the people but exercise

this right only when absolutely necessary (such as when some-

one deliberately harms a Witch within Rashemens borders)

to  avoid  a  bad  reputation.  Disobeying  the  direct  order  of  a

Witch is considered treason and may be punished by death as

well,  although  the  Witches  normally  give  a  warning  and

repeat the order before exacting this punishment and are more

lenient with the young, the ignorant, or other Witches.

Enemies

Despite its remote location, natural barriers, and lack of min-

eral resources, Rashemen has a number of enemies who would

like to see it destroyed, pillaged, or enslaved.

CHAUL OF CITADEL RASHEMAR

With  the  fall  of  Citadel  Rashemar,  a  power  vacuum

opened  in  the  eastern  end  of  Rashemen,  and  in  stepped

Chaul,  a  devious  hag  with  many  minions  and  significant

abilities as a sorcerer. She is one of the durthans (see below)

and is power-hungry like all of her sisterhood. Since she isnt

human, some humans in that organization fear what would

come to pass if she gained too much power. As it stands, she

has  close  ties  with  the  annis  hags  of  the  Ashenwood,  the

bheurs of the Running Rocks, and the shrieking hags of the

Endless Wastes.

Chaul is busily gathering an army in the eastern slopes of

the Sunrise Mountains, rallying goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears,

and ogres to her banner. While she loathes Rashemen and the

wychlaran,  she  knows  she  cannot  overthrow  the  hathrans

with a humanoid rabble, and so she is seeking a subtler strat-

egy. She dreams of finding some way to turn the people of

Rashemen against the Witches, and to this end she has been

working to entrap young ethrans and seduce them to her way

of thinking with offers of power and wealth. So far she has

had  little  success,  and  any  Witch  who  falls  into  her  hands

soon winds up dead.

THE DUERGAR

Below the Sunrise Mountains lies a strong kingdom of duer-

gar known as Darzalstaukh, the City of Dark Dreams. So far,

the gray dwarves have not engaged in overtly hostile actions.

However, given their generally evil nature and the rarity of

their  expeditions  to  the  surface,  most  Rashemi  assume  the

duergar are up to no good. Drow are rumored to appear in the

Running Rocks from time to time, so if the Underdark be-

neath Rashemen is contiguous, the gray dwarves may be able

to strike at any portion of the country from below.

Already, duergar outposts in surface caves come into con-

flict with Rashemens miners over the lands meager supply

of iron ore. The miners are preparing for inevitable war and

dont  plan  on  being  the  victims  of  a  surprise  attack.  The

hathrans  suggest  patience  and  caution,  for  the  numbers  of

duergar are unknown, and they might be interested in trade

rather than war. The duergar may be unsavory trading part-

ners, but peace with Darzalstaukh would give Rashemen access

to iron and other valuable metals.

THE DURTHANS

The  wychlaran  arent  the  only  female  spellcasters  manipu-

lating events in Rashemen. The durthans are a generally evil

group  of  women  with  powers  similar  to  those  of  the

hathrans,  but  they  are  focused  more  on  the  spirits  of  de-

struction  and  vengeance  that  live  within  the  land.  The

durthans believe the only way to protect Rashemen is to be as

ruthless  to  its  enemies  as  its  enemies  are  to  the  Rashemi

people. They dream of mounting attacks into Thay and Nar-

fell, stealing magic, and eliminating powerful foes. They would

tax the Golden Way and demand tribute from Thesk to allow

eastern goods to reach that country. The Great Dale, a simi-

larly  forested  and  natural  place,  would  become  a  target  of

Rashemi  expansion;  the  durthans  are  certain  they  can

awaken the spirits in that land and make it a place much like

their home.

As it stands, the durthans are greatly outnumbered by the

Witches, but because they work in secret and sometimes pre-

tend to be hathrans themselves, the extent of their power is

unknown.  The  Witches  are  grateful  for  the  respite  from

Thayan attacks, which gives them time to concentrate on this

danger from within. Most durthans take the durthan prestige

class  (see  Chapter  2:  Prestige  Classes),  although  they  are

grooming  many  underlings  for  membership  in  their  dark

order, much as the hathrans count the ethrans among their

number despite the inexperience of the untried.

NAR BARBARIANS

Old Narfell may be long dead, but the descendants of those

evil priests live on as bloodthirsty marauders and raiders who

fight with one another and anyone who stumbles into their

cold lands. From time to time, aggressive Nar tribes cross the

River Erech to battle the Rashemi, and when the two groups

142

RASHEMEN

of berserkers meet, blood stains the ground for many miles.

Fortunately, weather and water discourage this behavior, but

when populations grow large in Narfell and resources grow

thin,  foolish  young  Nars  are  willing  to  raid  Rashemen.  Re-

cently the Witches have encouraged the berserkers to leave de-

feated raiders alive, but only after removing an arm. These

grim survivors of pointless Nar raids are sent home to remind

their fellows of the consequences of attacking Rashemen.

The most aggressive of these horse-raiders are the Ragnor

tribe, a powerful band of barbarians who live on the steppes

north of the Firward Mountains. The Ragnor tribe is led by

a vicious killer called Ghur-Tha the Cleaver (CE male human

Bbn4/Clr9 of Orcus) who delights in capturing enemies alive

and sacrificing them to his demonic patron.

RED WIZARDS OF THAY

The primary enemies of modern Rashemen are the Red Wiz-

ards  of  Thay  and  their  servants,  slaves,  and  armies.  Even

though the common people of Thay have no reason to hate the

Rashemi, Thays history of war with Rashemen and the con-

stant exhortations of the Red Wizards have convinced the lower

classes that the Rashemi are a horrible and debased people.

Fortunately for Rashemen, the Red Wizards have been in-

competent in execution of their goals of conquest, wasting re-

sources  fighting  one  another  instead  of  focusing  on  their

opponents.  They  might  take  the  field  with  an  army  of  orc

troops and a new magical crossbreed that loves to eat orcs, or

send a squadron of griffonriders to aid a gnoll tribe that hates

all flying creatures. They give imprecise orders to mindless

undead, so that thousands of troops walk aimlessly into the

forest or march themselves into a lake. The Red Wizards are

best when dealing with opponents directlyusing spells and

magic items they wield themselvesbut they avoid such tac-

tics, which put them directly in harms way.

Now that the Thayans are focusing on trade rather than

military conquest, it will be interesting to see what happens

to their long-term relationship with Rashemen. The Rashemi

arent going to forget five hundred years of conquest attempts

overnight, and the Red Wizards arent going to forget their

defeats  at  the  hands  of  the  hathrans,  nor  the  phenomenal

magic hoards of the Old Ones. Even if the Thayans succeed

at spreading their trade enclaves throughout the nearby lands,

the Rashemi will be a tough sell.

Cities and Sites

Most  Rashemi  live  outside  of  large  settlements,  preferring

separated homesteads surrounded by small tracts of farmland

or pasture. Their homes are usually built to blend in with the

countryside.  Some  are  stone,  covered  with  earth  and  grass;

others  are  built  against  small  hillside  caves;  and  a  few  are

almost completely buried, looking like nothing more than a

low knoll. Rashemi cities are small and compact, with build-

ings made of dark wood and stone and topped with sod and

grass.  The  thick  walls  keep  out  the  cold  weather  and  are

treated to resist burning (always a danger when a constant fire

is needed for much of the year). Rural Rashemi look down on

the city dwellers, considering them soft, but in truth the res-

idents of Rashemens cities live much the same as the coun-

try folk, although with shorter walks to their neighbors.

Citadel Rashemar (VILLAGE)

This great fortress once held a garrison of over 2,000 Rashemi

troops,  ready  to  repel  bandits  and  protect  traders  moving

within the country. When the Tuigan Horde invaded in 1359

DR, they left 5,000 troops behind to besiege the fortress. With

the  hathrans  distracted  by  the  main  Tuigan  force,  the  de-

fenders of the citadel were left unsupported. Ballads are still

sung  by  Rashemi  bards  about  the  valor  and  bravery  of  the

doomed soldiers, who held out for three months against supe-

rior numbers. When the Tuigans finally took the fortress, they

mercilessly slaughtered all the defenders and the other locals

who had taken shelter within. The Tuigans then pulled down

its  mighty  walls  with  teams  of  strong  horses,  leaving  little

more than piles of shattered stone. Although the Tuigans were

defeated soon thereafter, Citadel Rashemar was not rebuilt.

The fallen citadel is now the haunt of foul creatures. Gob-

lins lair in the upper levels as well as in the remnants of the

village that surrounded the fort. Monstrous spiders crawl over

the ruins and are sometimes used as steeds by the goblins. The

lower levels are the lair of Chaul (NE female annis hag sor-

cerer 6/durthan 7), a powerful spellcaster and an enemy of the

hathrans, having slain two of them who sought to expel her.

Chaul is guarded by eight barbarian ogres and by goblins apt

at sorcery, and she is grooming her spellcasting followers for

the ability to use place magic. Her closest ally is Durakh Haan

(NE female half-orc Clr9 of Luthic), a woman of unknown

heritage but a bitter disposition. In combat, Chauls ogres are

enhanced by Durakhs magic, each leading a wing of twenty

goblins trained in dealing with berserkers (using hit-and-run

tactics to deplete their rage). Chaul and Durakh stay out of

sight of their enemies, with Durakh casting raise dead to re-

plenish any fallen allies and animate dead on fallen foes. The

undead guard inner portions of the ruins, while the clerics

power to restore the dead to life has filled the goblins with un-

shakeable faith in themselves and their leaders.

Citadel  Rashemar  was  originally  a  ring-shaped  hilltop

fortress enclosing an area almost 300 yards across within its

outer walls, with towers enspelled against long-range magic

like that used by the Red Wizards. Its most intact part is the

inner  keep  that  caps  the  shaft  leading  to  the  subterranean

levels. The former walls have been rearranged into defensive

lines surrounding the central keep, and the scattered stones

have been re-formed into crude, one-story towers able to con-

ceal  an  ogre.  Covered  passages  run  from  the  keep  to  each

tower, allowing troops to move to and from these outer po-

sitions without being exposed to ranged attacks. The houses in

the remains of the outlying village are little more than empty

shells, but the goblins have dug shallow tunnels beneath, which

they use as their homes. Anyone approaching is noticed long

143

before reaching the keep, and the goblins use horns to com-

municate with one another and with their masters.

Immilmar (LARGE CITY)

Overlooking the icy waters of Lake Ashane, this city is home

to the Iron Lords citadel and is the Rashemi capital. Immil-

mar is one of the few places in Rashemen where foreigners are

tolerated, and a number of Nar fur-traders and Theskian mer-

chants  are  always  abroad  in  the  city.  Foreign  legations  to

Rashemen come here as well, although the Iron Lord permits

few  permanent  embassies  from  other  lands.  Consuls  from

Aglarond, Impiltur, and Damara maintain homes in Immil-

marrepresentatives of all other lands are dispatched to the

city  for  specific  missions  and  are  not  encouraged  to  linger

after their business with the Iron Lord is done.

The Iron Lords citadel dominates the center of Immilmar,

and many stone buildings cluster about the feet of the castle.

As one travels away from the citadel, the citys construction

becomes more and more Rashemi, with fieldstone and rough-

hewn  timber  replacing  dressed  stone  and  smooth-sawn

lumber. Other than the Huhrongs castle, most of the citys

large buildings are steep-sided lodges built of heavy timbers in

the Rashemi style, with a double row of inward-slanting heavy

beams sunk into the ground and meeting along a high peak

directly overhead.

Built atop the foundations of an ancient Nar keep, the Iron

Lords  castle  is  a  mighty  fortress  of  iron  and  stone.  More

than five hundred years ago, the Witches used great magic

to raise this stronghold. Grim and forbidding, the citadel is

one  of  the  strongest  castles  in  the  land,  capable  of  with-

standing  almost  any  assault.  Its  walls  are  reinforced  with

spells designed to blunt magical attack and block ethereal and

teleporting invaders.

The  current  Iron  Lord  is  the  clever  Volas  Dyervolk  the

Bear (CG male human Bbn18), a crafty and strong-willed man

who does not shy away from arguing with the Witches when

he  feels  they  are  wrong.  On  more  than  one  occasion  the

RASHEMEN

Witches have considered his removal, but Volass forthright-

ness and keen insights have won their grudging respect. The

Witches awarded Volas his seat on the death of Yvarrg, the

previous Iron Lord, who was murdered by a Thayan assassin.

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

Immilmar  is  known  for  its  leather  goods,  woodcarvers,  and

ironworks. The tanneries and smelters are located in the hills

north and east of the town, as a long-dead Iron Lord ruled that

any enterprise producing fumes or reek must be away from the

citys  center.  Dozens  of  woodcarvers  and  stonecarvers  still

labor  in  workshops  in  the  tangled  streets  around  the  Iron

Lords citadel, but for the most part, Immilmars heart is a

pleasant place of young trees and winding ways.

Several  inns  of  note  cater  to  foreigners  calling  on  the

Huhrong. Blackstone House is the best of them, a comfortable

building stocked with wines and ales from several lands. Varro

the Fat (CG male human Ftr8) is the proprietor of the inn.

North of town, amid the cheerless foundries and forges of the

Smiths Quarter, is the well-worn workshop of the armorer

Tholli Ironweaver (NG male human Ftr4/Exp8). Tholli man-

ufactures both swords and mail of masterwork quality, and his

blades often sell for two to three times the normal price due

to his excellent reputation.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Chauntea is one of the more popular deities in Rashemen, al-

though she is more often known as Bhalla here. The House

of Bhalla is a medium-sized temple to Chauntea located in an

old stone building near the Iron Lords citadel. Brother Der-

varr (NG male human Clr7 of Chauntea) is the leader of this

temple. An Impilturan by birth, he was sent here to ensure

that Rashemi veneration of Chauntea does not stray too far

from her worship in other lands.

Although it is not really a temple, one of the most sacred

sites in the city is the Witches Hall, a whitewashed longhouse

with crossbeams carved in the shape of dragons, hounds, and

unicorns. Forbidden to all but the hathrans, this mysterious

building, sacred to Mystra, is the meeting place and refuge of

the wychlaran of Immilmar. Othlor Fydra Night-Tree (CN

female  human  Clr3/Sor9/Hth5)  presides  over  the  local

Witches and guards the hall from any desecration.

Mulptan (LARGE CITY)

Rashemens northern trading gateway to the outside world, Mulp-

tan is a sprawling, windswept city enclosed by an old stone wall

dating back to the Narfell-Raumathar wars. Damarans, Nars, and

even Tuigans come here to trade, meeting in a great field outside

of town that is crowded with the caravans and wagons of traders.

Farming is difficult this far north, so Mulptan subsists on vast

herds  of  roth,  sheep,  reindeer,  and  longhaired  goats  that  do

better in the frigid winters than southern cattle.

Most foreigners bound for Immilmar and the Iron Lords

citadel  actually  pass  through  Mulptan  on  their  way  to  the

countrys capital, even though Mulptan lies eighty miles to

the  east.  No  ferries  cross  Lake  Ashane  opposite  Immilmar

(the western shores of the lake are quite wild, this far north),

so  travelers  come  up  the  Golden  Way  or  the  Long  Road.

Either way, Mulptan is the first Rashemi city they come upon.

While Immilmar is a city of craftsfolk and smiths visited by

a few merchants, Mulptan is a city of merchants catered to

by a small number of Rashemi craftsfolk.

A number of foreigners reside in Mulptan, making it the

most cosmopolitan of Rashemens cities. The Shou Quarter oc-

cupies the south side of the city, while people of other nations

mix in the Western Quarter, so named because it is populated

by folk from western countries such as Thesk or Damara (the

district is actually located on the northeast side of the city). In

the wintertime, most of the merchants (and those foreigners

who have not actually settled in the city) depart for warmer

lands, since snow and wind make travel along the exposed roads

of the region virtually impossible for several months.

Two large Rashemi clans, the Ydrass and the Vrul, sponsor

many  contests  as  friendly  rivals.  The  competition  has  im-

proved both families, who are accomplished warriors, hunters,

and artisans. The two clans number in the hundreds, and while

they do not rule Mulptan outright (that privilege is reserved

for  the  Multrong,  or  Eastlord,  a  title  granted  by  the  Iron

Lord),  they  wield  great  influence  over  the  trade  and  com-

merce of the city.

RASHEMEN

Mulsantir (LARGE TOWN)

Shevel (LARGE TOWN)

At Mulsantir, the Golden Way meets Lake Ashane and halts.

Several  large  ferryboats  ply  the  waters  between  Mulsantir

and the western shore, carrying landbound caravans over the

lake to continue their trek west. A large and prosperous town

has grown up at the crossing point, where caravaneers often

provision themselves and purchase new mounts before they

unload, cross, and load up again. Mulsantirs ferry operators

and innkeepers make a good living from the passing cara-

vans. The town also boasts a large fishing fleet that nets stur-

geon in the lake. Farmers from miles around sell provisions

to the caravaneers.

During winter, the River Mulsantir freezes enough for car-

avans  to  continue  without  interruption,  but  in  spring,  the

lakes thaw makes it impossible to cross on foot or by boat for

several tendays. Westbound caravans fill up the town during

this time, waiting for the ice to break up.

Mulsantirs strategic location and prosperity have made it

a frequent target for Thayan attacks. It has been besieged at

least five times but has never fallen, due to the extensive stone

walls  that  protect  it.  The  town  is  made  up  of  rugged  stone

buildings separated by broad dirt streets that become muddy

in the fall and freeze solid in winter.

This trader settlement is the largest community along Rashe-

mens part of the Golden Way. As in Mulptan, foreigners are

allowed to settle here if they practice a valuable trade or are

involved in moving goods along the Golden Way. Since the

fall of Citadel Rashemar, raids by bandits and evil humanoids

have been more frequent, so mercenaries can easily find jobs

here, although the Witches evict any who seem intent on loi-

tering or settling down.

Walled to deter attackers, Shevel does not looks like a tra-

ditional Rashemi settlement, with many wooden houses and a

complete absence of stone-hill dwellings. Within the town are

several mini-districts settled by people from other countries,

from Damara to Kara-Tur to Mulhorand, all arranging deals

with  incoming  merchants  to  benefit  their  businesses  back

home. There is even a contingent of shield dwarves here, forg-

ing and selling iron weapons, which are popular among the

axe-wielding berserkers.

Taporan (SMALL TOWN)

This small settlement is primarily a river community, and its

boaters are responsible for most of the traffic on the River

Tir. The river folk are brave and reckless, fond of songs and

drinking, although usually not while ferrying passengers. The

settlement itself is a jumble of Rashemi rough stone buildings

separated  by  cobbled  streets  (a  rarity  in  this  country).  The

town is long and hugs the waterfront, sporting many noisy ale-

houses and berserker lodges. The Wolf Lodge is the largest of

these, and Taporan has a much higher proportion of berserk-

ers in its population than its primary trade requires.

Thasunta (LARGE TOWN)

Rashemi normally disdain folk who live in cities, even other

Rashemi, but for the men and women of Thasunta (popula-

tion 2,150), they make an exception. The people of this town

have a reputation as fierce berserkersan exaggeration, but

the locals do little to dispel the myth. Even nonberserkers pre-

tend to fly into a rage when they fight.

Most of the time, Thasunta is a stopping point along the

Golden Way and a mercantile center for nearby farmers and

ranchers, but in times of war, its true purpose comes to the

fore. A fierce horde of hundreds of experienced berserkers can

be mustered here at the call of the Witches or the Iron Lord.

Many times have the berserkers of Thasunta answered this

call, as the town lies along Thays primary invasion route. The

barbarians also played an important part in the war against

the  Tuigan  Horde,  holding  the  enemy  long  enough  to  give

their allies time to circle around and attack from the rear.

Now that the Thayans seem to be pursuing ends other than

overt conquest, there is talk among the townsfolk of mount-

ing raids against the savage humanoid tribes and other mon-

sters in the High Country.

146

RASHEMEN

The Iron Lord has traditionally left the governing of Tha-

sunta to the leaders of the berserker lodges, in particular the

Old Lodgea brotherhood reserved for the wisest and most

experienced warriors. A berserker must master the fighting

techniques of no fewer than three other lodges before being

considered for membership in the Old Lodge. Currently, the

Master  of  the  Old  Lodge  is  Jhorrgel  the  Black  (CN  male

human Bbn20). For someone so fierce in battle, Jhorrgel is a

surprisingly patient and perceptive leader.

Tinnir (VILLAGE)

This  small  community  is  partially  hidden  in  a  wooded  vale

along Lake Tirulag, and most travelers on the Golden Way pass

it without realizing there is a settlement just out of sight. In ad-

dition to the typical Rashemi dwellings, there are several white-

washed buildings in the style of western Faern. The villagers

are mainly fisherfolk, supplementing their food with small gar-

dens. The village sees some traffic from travelers on the lake,

and the Lakeside Inn caters to those who would stay overnight.

The  inn  is  an  old  two-story  structure  run  by  Vrulla  the

White, a friendly old woman fond of telling stories. Legend

has it that Chauntea blessed some of the rooms of the inn so

that  anyone  who  slept  in  one  would  be  granted  wondrous

dreams and good fortune in life. However, the blessed rooms

change often, so trying to find the right one is a gamble. The

inn is guarded by Nyella, the spirit of a dog belonging to the

man who built the inn over a century ago. Nyella is fond of

barking at strangers but is very protective of the inn, Vrulla,

and anyone she seems to favor.

Urling (HAMLET)

This community is easily overlooked by the ignorant. It looks

like nothing more than a grove of alders and evergreen trees

growing among clusters of grassy mounds. These mounds are

in fact the homes of the Witches of Rashemen, built in the

traditional style and covered with soil and plants. Most of the

inhabitants are hathrans, their spouses, and servants (ethrans

normally live among the common folk and only come here to

meet  with  their  superiors).  Foreigners  are  not  forbidden

hereand  certainly  are  not  executed  for  visitingbut

anyone  other  than  an  ethran,  a  hathran,  or  an  immediate

family member is encouraged to leave after a day or two.

One of the larger mounds is the Green Chapel, a quiet inn

for those who have come to speak to the hathrans. Any who

stay at the Green Chapel are warned of the consequences of

entering the Urlingwood. The inn is run by Selov (LN male

human Wiz15), a former Old One who accidentally stripped

himself of all magical ability while testing a mage-negating

spell  he  created  to  use  against  the  Red  Wizards.  Selov  is

trusted by the Witches and is protected by several spells that

will wipe portions of his memory if he is ever interrogated

about the secrets of the Old Ones.

The leading hathran of Urling is the Lady Yhelbruna (LN

female human Clr6/Wiz12/Hth10), the oldest and most pow-

erful hathran in Rashemen. Yhelbruna spends little time look-

ing  after  the  town;  the  hathrans  keep  their  own  affairs  in

order and quickly deal with troublesome intruders. Nythra of

the  Seven  Rivers  (NG  Wiz4/Clr4/Hth4)  is  Yhelbrunas

spokeswoman.  She  is  friendly  and  talks  openly  with  non-

hathran Rashemi, and even consents to speaking with the rare

foreign visitor whose business takes him to Urling.

Heroes and

Monsters

Most  characters  from  Rashemen  are  barbarians,  clerics,

druids,  fighters,  or  wizards.  Rangers  from  Rashemen  may

choose Thayans as a favored enemy. Humans are far and away

the most common Rashemi characters, but hagspawn, spirit

folk, and taers exist in various portions of the country and

often take up the adventurers career.

Chapter 2: Prestige Classes describes several prestige classes

common in Rashemen, including the durthan, the Raumath-

ari battlemage, and the runescarred berserker. Chapter 3: Re-

gions and Feats introduces a number of new feats appropriate

to characters of Rashemi origin, such as Draw From the Land,

Extended Rage, Improved Grapple, Rashemi Elemental Sum-

moning, Vremyonni Training, and feats associated with the

various berserker lodges.

Rashemen is home to a number of unique monsters rarely

encountered in other lands. New monsters presented in Chap-

ter 6: Monsters of the East include two varieties of hag (the

bheur, a hag with an affinity for cold magic, and the shriek-

ing hag, a deadly hunter of the steppes), the orglash (an air

elemental with a love of frozen temperatures), the telthor (an

incorporeal fey creature), the thomil (a tough variety of earth

elemental),  and  the  uthraki  (an  evil  shapechanger  active

mainly at night).

147

Best  known  for  the  crimson-robed  Red  Wizards

who  rule  the  land  with  an  iron  fist,  Thay  is  a

realm  shrouded  in  mystery.  Few  outsiders  have

traveled extensively within its borders unless abducted and sold

into  a  short  life  of  slavery  there.  The  Thayans  who  do  talk

about their homeland speak of it with such pride as to make

most listeners doubt their amazing claimswere it not for the

fact  that  these  same  rumors  surface  again  and  again  from  a

dozen different sources.

The Thayans have endeavored constantly to expand their

borders since they won their independence from Mulhorand

in 922 DR. In fact, it was only twelve years after that mo-

mentous date that the Thayans launched their first invasion

of Rashemen. The Thayans have been beaten back numerous

times from both Aglarond and Rashemen, but though their

armies failed to subjugate these realms, they still brought the

Alaor, the Priador, the Sur and Umber vales, and the cities of

the Wizards Reach under Thays control.

The borders of Thay have changed little since the conquest

of the Wizards Reach fifteen years ago. The Red Wizards keep

their armies at home these days, while their merchants have

spread throughout the lands of the Inner Sea, selling valuable

magic  items  in  well-protected  concessions  and  Thayan  en-

claves. Rivers of gold, goods, and slaves pour into the zulkirs

coffers from this expansion of Thayan trade. Szass Tam and

his colleagues have come to understand that gold can conquer

lands that resist swords and spells, and Thays monopoly on

the manufacture and sale of magic items might be the weapon

that brings the Red Wizards dominion over all Faern.

Geographic

Overview

The country of Thay, once a large portion of the Mulhorandi

Empire, extends from the borders of Thesk and Aglarond in

the  west  to  the  Sunrise  Mountains  in  the  east.  It  stretches

nearly 500 miles from north to south and 450 miles from east

to west. Rashemen is directly to the north, across Lake Mul-

santir, while the Alamber Sea and Mulhorand form Thays

southern edge.

Most of Thay consists of a great plateau almost 350 miles

across. These arid tablelands are about 2,000 feet above sea

level at the outer edges and slope up to an elevation of about

4,000  feet  in  the  vicinity  of  Lake  Thaylambar  and  the

foothills  of  the  Sunrise  Mountains.  The  plateaus  southern,

western, and northern borders are a band of broken cliffs and

rugged canyons known as the First Escarpment. While few of

these cliffs are more than a couple of hundred feet in height,

the Escarpment rises on a dozen or so such precipices in the

space of ten or fifteen miles, like the tiers of a wedding cake.

A small party on foot can pick their way up the Escarpment

over a day or two of difficult paths and short scrambles, but

an army of any size is limited to a small number of passes and

roads, which the Thayans guard well.

Atop the Plateau of Thay, the land consists of broad, rolling

vistas broken by low mesas and chains of jagged rocks. Within

its  bounds  rises  the  Ruthammar  Plateau,  a  second,  smaller

plateau roughly 150 miles in diameter, which is more often re-

ferred to as the Thaymount (its most prominent feature) or

High Thay. The Second Escarpment, a chain of cliffs and gorges

even more forbidding than the First Escarpment, bounds High

Thay. It averages almost 6,000 feet in elevation and is notice-

ably colder and more arid than the tablelands below.

At the center of High Thay stand the volcanic peaks of the

Thaymount,  in  actuality  a  hundred-mile  chain  of  fanglike

ridges  and  smoldering  cinder  cones  whose  highest  point  is

THAY

more than 17,000 feet high. In the youth of the world, basalt

flows from these now-slumbering giants formed the mighty

plateaus  of  Thay.  While  a  number  of  people  live  in  High

Thay, few settlements stand close to the peaks of the Thay-

mountminor eruptions are common, creating ash falls and

clouds of sulphurous fumes that drift northeast, rendering a

large area of the plateau virtually uninhabitable.

At the eastern edge of the country, amid the foothills of the

Sunrise Mountains, rises a third series of cliffsthe Surague

Escarpment. This forms a shelf atop the First Escarpment,

and like the plateau of High Thay, averages about 6,000 feet

in elevation. Numerous streams spill down from the heights

of the Sunrise Mountains, creating a tangled maze of gorges

and canyonlands in this corner of the country.

Just east of High Thay, near the eastern foot of the Second

Escarpment, lies Lake Thaylambar. Fed by the River Surag,

born of the snowmelts of the Sunrise Mountains, this deep,

cold body of water is nearly eighty miles across. Its outlet is

the River Thay, which flows north to Lake Mulsantir near

the Surmarsh. The Sunrise Mountains also give rise to two

other great riversthe Thazarim in the south and the Gauros

in  the  north.  The  soot-covered  glaciers  of  the  Thaymount

feed two more great riversthe Umber, which flows west to

Aglarond  and  the  Sea  of  Dlurg,  and  the  Lapendrar,  with

flows  southwest  through  the  Priador  to  meet  the  Wizards

Reach at Escalant.

Thay is a naturally warm, dry land whose lofty elevation

prevents the moisture-laden winds from the Sea of Fallen

Stars  from  bringing  much  precipitation  to  the  interior.

Never ones to be satisfied with their lot, the Red Wizards

have  created  a  network  of  spells  that  maintains  pleasant

weather conditions all year round. This plays havoc with the

weather  in  Thesk,  but  the  Thayans  do  not  concern  them-

selves with the difficulties of their neighbors. The days are

warm  but  not  unpleasantly  so.  The  plains  are  regularly

soaked with rains, but only in the dead of night. Just about

every day in Thay is a fine one, in stark contrast to the mis-

erable lives most people lead here. The weather spells ensure

fine growing conditions for vast croplands, worked by the

uncounted thousands of slaves upon whom the Thayan econ-

omy depends.

Major Geographic

Features

Thay  is  blessed  with  many  special  natural  fea-

tures, from the glaciers and volcanoes of the Thay-

mount to the beaches of Bezantur. Those traveling

along one of the few main roads are treated to breath-

taking views as they mount first one escarpment

and then another. The distant snow-covered

peaks of the Thaymount seem to watch

over  it  all  like  sleeping  kings,  a

landmark  visible  from  almost  any

spot in the country.

THAY

Most  travelers  enter  Thay  through  one  of  five  major

routes. In the north, those following the Golden Way come

first to the port city of Surthay on the southern shore of Lake

Mulsantir.  Traditionally,  travelers  ride  or  walk  the  Long

Portage from Surthay up to the top of the Plateau of Thay.

The River Thay is one of the great highways of the land, and

slave-pulled barges ferry goods and passengers from the First

Escarpment to Lake Thaylambar. Once on the lake, its an

easy voyage to Eltabbar, the capital city, located on the south-

western shore.

In  the  southeast,  travelers  forge  their  way  up  the  River

Thazarim to the First Escarpment. An old Mulhorandi road

leads through the gorge of the Thazarim and meets a track

bound for Pyarados. From there, one can either take the path

along the Sunrise Mountains to Lake Thaylambar, or go by

the well-maintained Eastern Way to Tyraturos, then north

along the High Road to Eltabbar. Few people enter Thay by

this route, as the tharch of Thazalhar is a desolate and for-

bidding land, plagued by restless undead and hungry monsters

from the mountains.

Most  people  bound  for  Thay  put  in  at  the  great  port  of

Bezantur,  one  of  the  largest  cities  along  the  Sea  of  Fallen

Stars. The High Road leads straight north through Tyraturos

to  Eltabbar.  The  Thayans  expect  visitors  to  enter  by  this

route, so inns and taverns catering to foreigners are common

along the High Roadas are spies and agents of the Red Wiz-

ards, who keep a close eye on folk of other lands.

In the past, armies seeking to invade Thay have come by

way of the River Lapendrar. The Lapendrar itself is not nav-

igable past the First Escarpment, as a waterfall tumbles over

the edge of the Plateau of Thay, preventing passage. However,

the gorge of the River of Sorrows is one of the broadest and

most gentle ascents of the First Escarpment, at least for trav-

elers on foot. When Halacar of Aglarond led his ill-advised ex-

pedition into Thay a century ago, this was the route he chose.

Lastly, some prefer to sail up the River Umber to Neth-

jet, located on the eastern side of Lake Umber. From here,

one can follow the Eastern Way until it meets up with the

High Road at Tyraturos, then head north to Eltabbar. Mon-

sters haunting the passage through the Dragonjaw Mountains

make this route somewhat dangerous, and the Nethjet end of

the Eastern Way is poorly maintained, a magnet for gnoll

brigands and similar undesirables. Folk from northerly lands

along  the  Inner  Sea  find  this  a  faster  but  more  dangerous

route than the long walk up the Golden Way to Mulsantir

and Surthay.

In addition to the natural defenses of Thay, a number of

small citadels sprinkle the slopes of both the First and Second

Escarpments. These well-built stone structures ostensibly keep

out enemies, but in truth, they are home to patrols of humans

and  gnolls  who  spend  more  of  their  time  keeping  Thayan

slaves in. Most roads on the Plateau itself (especially the East-

ern  Way  and  the  High  Road)  are  impeccably  maintained.

Raised a few feet above the surrounding land, they are covered

with  an  alchemical  tarmac  for  durability  and  ease  of  use.

Work crews constantly repair the roads, keeping them in near-

perfect shape. Small fortresses known as tax stations line the

roads and appear at all other points of entry into Thay.

The Alaor

The Alaor comprises two islands off the southern coast of

Thay,  where  the  Wizards  Reach  meets  the  Alamber  Sea.

While this is the smallest of the eleven tharchs, its position

makes it one of the most vital. The bulk of the Thayan navy

is  housed  here,  along  with  the  primary  Thayan  shipyards.

The  principal  harbor  of  the  Alaor  is  an  expansive  cove

guarded by a sea-arch. In the rock of the headlands lies a net-

work of sea caves large enough to hide an entire fleet. The

rugged islands have no other good landing spots or sheltered

bays, which is one reason no other country thought to use

them as a naval base.

Tharchion  Thessaloni  Canos  (LE  female  human  Ftr17)

commands the tharch; the evoker Mur Vhol (N male human

Evo7/Red5) assists her, supervising the various magelings as-

signed to the tharchions fleet. Over 15,000 souls call this

tharch home, including sailors. The fleet consists of a dozen

slender, deadly dromonds, powerful galleys each crewed by

over  one  hundred  well-armed  warriors  and  twice  that

number  of  slave  rowers.  Each  warship  carries  a  pair  of

Tax Stations

Thay is filled with these small fortresses. Each houses a gar-

rison of thirty to fifty gnoll or human warriors, ready to put

teeth into the implied threat each visitor faces when accosted

by the tax collectors.

Tax stations stand not only at the edges of Thay, but also

at the border of each tharch and at every other point along

which people are likely to pass. The revenues collected help

to fund the tharchs, one of the reasons for Thays excellent

public services. Taxes vary greatly from tharch to tharch,

not  to  mention  from  station  to  station.  They  are  rarely

exorbitant, as the tharchions dont wish to discourage traf-

fic  through  their  territories.  The  amount  ranges  from  as

little  as  2  cp  to  as  much  as  1  gp.  Guards  also  check  for

passes or traveling permits while they collect the coins, and

folk abroad without the proper documentation are usually

jailed on the spot.

The tax stations also keep the slave population under con-

trol. Few slaves have any money, and those who try to pose

as  Thayan  citizens  are  sure  to  run  into  problems  without

cash. The fees may not be that high, but they must be paid.

The stations soldiers do their utmost to make tax evaders see

the error of their ways.

151

THAY

Thayan bombards (see Chapter 5: Magic Items for more in-

formation), as well as a ships mage and a ships acolytea

wizard and a cleric specializing in battle magic. The pride of

the  Thayan  navya  massive  warship  known  as  the  Red

Scourgelies  at  anchor  here  when  not  escorting  Thayan

merchant ships in and out of the area. Most pirates flee at

the first sight of the ships crimson-colored sails, for they

know that to confront such a powerful vessel is to invite a

swift and sorcerous death. Altogether, the fleet is crewed by

almost 5,000 officers, soldiers, and slaves; most of the re-

maining folk who call this barren island home are carpen-

ters, stevedores, provisioners, sailmakers, shipwrights, and all

the  other  artisans  and  professionals  needed  to  maintain  a

fleet in port.

With the advent of Thay as a mercantile power, the Alaor

has  become  even  more  vital  to  the  nations  interests.  The

Thayan navy had long worked to keep the waters of the Sahua-

gin Sea (as the Alamber Sea is also called) free of pirates. They

have since extended their operations to include a good stretch

of the Wizards Reach. Between the forces of Thay and Agla-

rond, there are few safe places for pirates to operate in this

region. Several naval ships have even been converted into mer-

cantile vessels carrying Thays goods to the rest of the world.

Merchant ships from Bezantur carry much of Thays trade to

other lands, but shipments to and from major enclaves are en-

trusted only to Thays navy.

The Alaor is well defended. The zulkirs know the islands

are Thays first line of defense against an invasion by sea. If

the islands were to fall into a foreign powers hands, the re-

sults would be disastrous. Any foe who had control over such

a base could attack up and down the southern coast of Thay

with impunity.

Besides the garrison of 1,000 soldiers on duty here at all

times,  the  islands  are  outfitted  with  dozens  of  batteries  of

Thayan bombards.

Delhumide

Once the most populous district of old Thay in the days of

Mulhorandi rule, the tharch of Delhumide is now thinly set-

tled.  Stretching  from  Lake  Thaylambar  to  the  Gorge  of

Gauros and bounded on the east and west by the River Thay

and  the  River  Gauros,  Delhumide  is  a  broad  land  of  open

plains and few people. The tharch could easily support a much

greater population, except that demons, ghosts, and sleeping

spells of deadly malevolence taint the countryside for miles

around the ruins of the old capital and the provinces aban-

doned estates.

With  the  exception  of  some  farmland  along  the  river

valleys,  Delhumide  is  mostly  used  as  open  range  for  large

herds of cattle. Tharchion Invarri Metron (LE male human

Ftr11) governs the land from his palace at Umratharos, a

small city at the bend of the River Thay. He has little in-

terest in the ruins of the old capital but is happy to collect

a cut of any wealth recovered by adventurers picking through

the wreckage.

Eltabbar

Northwest Thay belongs to the tharch of Eltabbar, a curving

swath of land that extends from the western shores of Lake

Thaylambar and around the northern slopes of the Second Es-

carpment all the way to the River Umber, almost directly op-

posite the city of Eltabbar. Even though Thays capital city

is located in this tharch, large portions of it are lightly pop-

ulatedmost of the land between the rich valley of the River

Thay and the Umber is scrubland, home to the roaming bands

of gnolls and orcs who make up the zulkirs foot soldiers.

The tharchion of Eltabbar is the notorious Dmitra Flass

(NE female human Ill7/Red8), the so-called First Princess of

Thay. She spends all her time in the capital and gives little

thought to anything that happens on the northwest frontier.

The wreckage of old Nar ruins dot the remoter portions of

the  tharch,  occasionally  disgorging  some  forgotten  demon

that terrorizes the countryside until bound or destroyed by

the Red Wizards.

Gauros

Gauros is a relatively poor tharch with no major cities. The

River  Gauros  flows  down  from  the  heights  of  the  Sunrise

Mountains and through northeastern Thay before tumbling

over the edge of the First Escarpment to carve out the great

Gorge of Gauros. From there, it flows into Lake Mulsantir on

the nations northern border.

Gauros is rocky, rugged, and forbidding, a wild land of dry

pine forests and high, barren mesas. Swift, shallow snow-

melt rivers from the Sunrises rush through the land, but by

midsummer they are reduced to dusty rivulets. Most of the

folk in the district are Rashemi woodcutters and goatherds.

Ruined  towers  and  empty  keeps  crown  many  of  the  barren

hills, the remnants of ancient Raumathars foothold on this

part  of  the  Thayan  plateau.  The  nearby  mountains  harbor

dangerous monsters, including athachs, chimeras, and bands of

feral gnolls.

The  ruler  of  Gauros  is  Tharch  Azhir  Kren  (NE  female

human Ftr15). An aggressive general, she is itching to lead

Szass Tams legions into battle. The zulkirs fascination with

developing trade does nothing but frustrate her. Krens troops

constantly patrol the Gorge of Gauros, looking for any excuse

to  launch  an  invasion  of  her  nations  northern  neighbor,

Rashemen. Kren only needs the thinnest of pretexts, and if she

doesnt stumble across one soon, shell manufacture the nec-

essary evidence.

DAGGERTOOTH PASS

One of only two passes through the Sunrise Mountains, Dag-

gertooth  Pass  follows  the  Gauros  up  to  its  headwaters  and

crosses a high saddle to come down in the upper vale of the

Murghol, a tributary to the Clearflow of the Endless Wastes.

To  one  side  of  the  main  track  a  knifelike  peak  looms,  the

mountain that gives the pass its name. The top of the pass is

152

THAY

a little more than 9,000 feet above sea level, and heavy snows

linger on the shaded northern sides of the peaks all year long.

In some years, the Daggertooth is completely impassable.

The narrow and steep track is unsuitable for anything ap-

proaching the size of an army, which is why the Tuigans have

never troubled the Thayans by this route. The zulkirs main-

tain a sinister fortress called Chur-Gathos a little way down

from the saddle on the Thayan side. This cold, lonely outpost

is reserved for those soldiers unlucky enough to earn a post-

ing in one of the worst spots in the land.

GORGE OF GAUROS

Well over 100 miles in length, the Gorge of Gauros cleaves

the First Escarpment in a maze of deep, narrow canyons, di-

viding the plateau of Thay from the Mulsanyaar Plateau in

Rashemen. Here the river Gauros joins a number of smaller

streams racing down from the heights of the Sunrise Moun-

tains. The northeast corner of the Plateau of Thay is more

than 4,000 feet above sea level, and the Mulsantir basin has

an elevation of about 1,500 feet, so the gorge averages half

a  mile  or  more  in  depth.  It  is  about  twenty  miles  wide  for

most of its length, its floor divided by numerous side-canyons,

nameless cascades, and crumbling plinths of rock scoured by

ancient floodwaters.

The Gorge of Gauros blocks all north and south travel east

of Lake Mulsantir, except for a narrow strip along the foot

of the escarpment right by the lakeshore. It is one of Rashe-

mens  most  effective  defenses  against  Thayan  attack.  The

gorge is home to a number of monsters, including a very old

female red dragon named Magrevystala, who lairs in a dry

hanging valley somewhere in its heart.

High Thay

Also known as the Plateau of Ruthammar or (mistakenly) the

Thaymount, High Thay is that portion of the country above

the  Second  Escarpment  and  below  the  Thaymount  proper.

Little is known of this land outside of Thay: Foreigners are

not permitted to travel there except under the direct escort

of a Red Wizard, and the Red Wizards do not bring outsiders

to this portion of their land without very good cause.

While the center of High Thay is dominated by the ice-clad

volcanoes of the Thaymount, a ring of cool, fertile highlands

surround the smoking mountains. This higher plateau is only

a dozen miles wide on its eastern side, but in other places it

is a broad, lightly forested highland almost 100 miles across.

Like the Plateau of Thay below, the land consists of low mesas

separated by broad, rolling plains, but High Thay is cooler and

more humid than the lands below and supports pine forests,

vineyards, and great orchards of fruit trees. High Thay climbs

steeply upward as one travels toward the Thaymount, and the

foothills could be called mountains in any other land.

For centuries, High Thay has been the refuge of the lands

masters. Mulan noble families, high clerics of the faiths of

Bane, Cyric, or Kossuth, and of course prominent Red Wizards

own  vast  estates  on  this  high  plateau.  The  Thayans  do  not

build  great  cities  here,  although  a  number  of  well-ordered

towns  populate  the  southern  and  western  regions  of  the

plateau. Most of these powerful Thayans are absentee land-

lords, spending their time in the cities of greater Thay and

only retreating to their estates to escape the late-summer heat

of the lower plateau.

Portions of High Thay, particularly the foothills and the

northerly and eastern reaches downwind of the Thaymount,

are quite barren, covered with ash falls from the volcanoes.

These  lands  are  unsettled  except  for  the  occasional  Red

Wizard determined to raise a tower in a particularly desolate

spot. Wild gnolls, orcs, and other humanoids haunt these lands,

mostly because the Red Wizards find them useful stock for

their armies and have not made any concerted effort to ex-

terminate them.

Lapendrar

Hezass Nymar (NE male human Clr8 of Kossuth) is the thar-

chion of Lapendrar. This tharch begins at the southeastern

edge of the Second Escarpment and rolls down to the borders

of Thesk and Aglarond. This territory features many impor-

tant cities, including Nethentir, Nethjet, Amruthar, and Es-

calant. The River Umber flows through this territory before

reaching  Aglarond,  while  the  River  Lapendrar  forms  the

tharchs southern border until it empties into the Wizards

Reach.  The  Eastern  Way,  one  of  the  two  major  roads  con-

necting the southern portions of Thay, bisects this tharch.

Lapendrar  is  one  of  the  least  strongly  held  of  all  the

tharchs. Its border with Aglarond is constantly disputed, and

its largest city, Amruthar, is nominally independent of Thay.

This suits Nymar, who craftily maintains a compassionate and

generous manner unknown in the other tharchs. Many of his

fellows condemn Nymar as a well-connected weakling, but in

truth he is a master of treacherymost of his victims dont

even realize it was he who orchestrated their downfall. Nymar

rules his tharch from an elegant palace of white marble in the

city  of  Escalant  (the  most  recent  addition  to  the  Thayan

Empire) although he spends much of his time in Eltabbar,

scheming against his peers.

Plateau of Thay

The Plateau of Thay includes everything within the First Es-

carpment, a long line of sheer cliffs surrounding the interior

portion of the country, although the lands above the Second

EscarpmentHigh  Thay  and  the  Thaymountare  dis-

tinctly different. The distance between the First and Second

Escarpments ranges from little more than twenty miles on

the western edge overlooking Nethentir to nearly 200 miles

in the southeast and northeast reaches.

The  First  Escarpment  guards  Thay  from  attack  and  has

daunted many who contemplated invasion. The natural walls

are  a  better  defense  than  any  army.  The  cliffs  are  honey-

combed with tunnels, barracks, and fortresses carved directly

153

THAY

into the rock, highlighting the difficulty of challenging Thay

on its own turf. In fact, the escarpment was one of the rea-

sons the wizards of Thay were able to fight off their Mulho-

randi  overlords  during  their  war  of  independence.  Even

though the Thayans were disorganized and divided by vicious

feuds, the Mulhorandi army had a devil of a time getting up

and over those cliffs.

The plateau itself is a naturally arid, rolling plain with oc-

casional dusty mesas. Centuries ago, the Red Wizards crafted

great weather-controlling spells to bring rain and moderate

temperatures to this upland, and now vast tracts of former sa-

vannah  are  densely  cultivated  cropland.  In  the  southern

reaches of the plateau, every bit of land is put to use. Slaves

tend the fields and orchards, planting and harvesting crops,

felling  timber,  and  picking  fruit.  Cotton  and  grain  are  the

major crops, although citrus and olive trees and the occasional

vineyard grow between the fields. Tax stations and the estates

of noble Thayans and Red Wizards dot the land, along with

small  villages  that  sprout  up  around  them.  North  of  the

Second  Escarpment,  the  plateau  is  much  less  densely  popu-

lated. The valleys of the rivers Gauros and Thay are heavily

settled,  but  much  of  the  rest  is  empty  scrubland,  inhabited

only by goatherds, shepherds, and stonecutters.

Nearly 3 1/2 million people live on the Plateau of Thay. Of

these, about 2 1/2 million are slaves or the evil humanoids

who guard them (mostly gnolls and orcs). Both slaves and war-

riors live in squalor in massive barracks. The Thayan economy

depends on slaves, a constantly replenished source of cheap

labor who are routinely worked to death under the watchful

eyes of cruel overseers and guards.

The  Thayan  merchant  fleet  ships  surplus  cotton,  grain,

olive oil, and citrus fruit all across eastern Faern. Thayan

grain feeds Impiltur, Chessenta, and the Vast, as well as the

cities of the Wizards Reach. The success of this trade led to

the  current  strategy  of  exporting  more  valuable  goods

namely, magic itemsto other lands. Thayan merchants al-

ready knew the trade routes and had demonstrated for decades

that Thay could be a successful trading partner.

The entire plateau is impervious to scrying magic. The Red

Wizards  have  set  up  an  elaborate  shield  of  overlapping

wards that prevent such spying. Any spell with the scry-

ing descriptor that targets a person or point within the First

Escarpment  fails  automatically.  Divination  of  other  types

usually works, but many Red Wizards screen their activi-

ties  with additional defenses such as mind blank or nonde-

tection. These  wards  interfere  with  the  Red  Wizards  own

scrying spells as well, making it difficult for them to magi-

cally locate intruders. However, the patrols usually do a good

job of watching.

Guards both human and gnoll patrol the plateau in the set-

tled areas, on the lookout for escaped slaves and foreign spies.

Despite the opening of trade agreements with many nations,

few foreigners spend much time in the Thayan countryside.

Most are issued passes permitting travel to only one or two

cities along a specified route.

LAKE THAYLAMBAR

Lake Thaylambar is the largest body of fresh water within

Thays borders. It is wide, deep, and always cold, even in the

middle  of  summer.  Its  waters  feed  the  River  Thay,  which

flows north to empty into Lake Mulsantir. Eltabbar, the cap-

ital of Thay, sits on the southwestern shore of Lake Thay-

lambar.  Delhumide,  the  original  provincial  capital,  once

looked out from the northeastern shore, but it was destroyed

in Thays war of independence.

The  fishing  in  Lake  Thaylambar  is  wonderful.  Large

amounts of seafood from its depths find their way onto plates

throughout  the  nation.  The  lake  is  not  without  dangers,

though. Its depths are infested with dragon turtles that some-

times  like  to  snack  on  fishing  vessels.  Over  the  years,  the

zulkirs have sent out hunting parties to thin their numbers,

with  limited  success.  Although  these  expeditions  sometimes

manage  to  find  and  kill  dragon  turtles,  the  hunters  often

become the hunted. On occasion, expeditions have been com-

pletely wiped out.

However, last year one group of hunters managed to cap-

ture  a  dragon  turtle  alive.  Brazhal  Kos  (LE  male  human

Enc7/Red4), a powerful enchanter, devised a magic harness

that enslaved the creature to his will. Kos has offered its serv-

ices to Homen Odesseiron, the tharchion of Surthay. Assum-

ing the Red Wizards can transport the creature, this would put

the captive dragon turtle in Lake Mulsantir to contest Rash-

emi  control  of  the  lake.  Brazhal  Kos  makes  this  offer  ex-

pecting something in return, of course.

RIVER THAY

From Lake Thaylambar, the River Thay flows north toward

Surthay and Lake Mulsantir, marking the boundary between

the tharchs of Delhumide and Eltabbar. The vale of the Thay

is heavily populated, a fertile plain supporting vast orchards

of  fruit  trees  more  suited  to  cool  weather  than  the  citrus

groves  of  the  south,  such  as  apples  and  cherries.  The  river

itself  is  the  principal  highway  to  the  northern  marches  of

Thay, and numerous keelboats and barges ply its waters, towed

by slave teams along the banks.

Priador

Tharchion Aznar Thrul, the zulkir of evocation, rules this

tharch with an iron fist. Thays trade enclaves in other lands

brings  immense  wealth  into  Bezantur,  the  tharchs  largest

city. Thrul has almost unlimited resources at his disposal, and

there is little to stop himother than the other zulkirs, that

is. Thrul derided the notion of selling magic items early on

when  Thay  was  establishing  the  enclave  system,  so  he  has

reaped little of the enormous profits of the Guild of Foreign

Trade. The zulkir simmers over the lost opportunity. He be-

lieves a hefty cut of the Guilds take is due him as the thar-

chion  controlling  Bezantur,  and  he  is  considering  how  to

154

THAY

claim his portion against the interest of those who supported

the idea from the beginning.

The Priador extends along Thays southern coast, from the

River Lapendrar all the way east to the River Thazarim. Its

northern  boundary  is  the  Lapendrar  and  the  First  Escarp-

ment. Along with the Alaor and Surthay in the distant north,

the Priador is not actually part of the Plateau of Thay. Besides

Bezantur, the tharch holds two other major settlements. Thas-

selen lies on the shore seventy miles west of Bezantur. An-

other hundred miles or so farther in that direction squats the

port city of Murbant. Both of these ports are closer to the Sea

of  Fallen  Starsand  therefore  the  bulk  of  Faernthan

Bezantur,  but  they  are  poor  sisters  to  the  tharchs  capital.

Bezantur is one of the largest and wealthiest cities in eastern

Faern,  and  its  port  is  thronged  with  the  ships  of  a  dozen

lands at all times.

The High Road, one of the nations two major roads, starts

in  Bezantur.  From  there,  it  climbs  the  First  Escarpment,

passes through Tyraturos, and ends in Eltabbar. Some of the

locals call this road the Slave Way, for large numbers of slaves

are driven north along it to the markets of Eltabbar.

Unlike most of Thay, much of the Priador is still wild. In

fact,  a  number  of  preserves  throughout  the  region  permit

monsters to roam freely. These creatures are kept on hand for

use in the Red Wizards unethical experiments. Travelers ac-

costed by the creatures are allowed to defend themselves, but

more than one monster-slayer has discovered that damaging

a zulkirs property brings more pain than claws and teeth.

Pyarados

The tharch of Pyarados runs between the eastern edge of Lake

Thaylambar and the Sunrise Mountains, right to the lower

portion of the River Thazarim and the southern edge of the

First Escarpment. The tharch doesnt quite reach the High

Road to the west, which is part of Tyraturos. The ruler of this

tharch  is  Nymia  Focar  (CE  female  human  Ftr9).  Pyrados

hasnt benefited directly from the influx of wealth brought

about  by  the  zulkirs  new  trade  policy,  but  Focar  has  been

savvy enough to make herself rich through her own initia-

tives.  She  is  more  forgiving  of  the  presence  of  foreign  ad-

venturers than most of her peers, granting them free rein to

explore  those  portions  of  the  Sunrise  Mountains  that  lie

within her tharch. The only catch is that the shops in Pyara-

dos charge foreigners triple the normal prices and pass the

bulk of the profits back to the tharchion.

In addition to monster dens and old ruins, this part of the

Sunrise Mountains harbors all sorts of mineral wealth. Focar

cant be bothered with owning or operating mines herself, so

she charges a stiff tax on those who do. Any who try to cheat

her  or  refuse  to  pay  find  their  claims  sold  out  from  under

them to people more willing to go along with Focars demands.

There is only one major city herePyarados, after which

the tharch is named. Situated on the west bank of the River

Thazarim, this is where the Eastern Way ends, just shy of the

Surague Escarpment. Two well-worn tracks lead out of city.

One follows the edges of the Surague Escarpment and the edge

of Lake Thaylambar up to the city of Eltabbar. The other is

on  the  east  side  of  the  River  Thazarim,  and  it  leads  south

through the tharch of Thazalhar into Mulhorand, eventually

winding up in either Sultim or Rauthil, depending on which

fork one follows.

THE PASS OF THAZAR

A short distance north and east of the city of Pyarados is the

Pass of Thazar, one of only two ways (Daggertooth Pass is the

other)  across  the  Sunrise  Mountains  into  Thay.  The  pass

climbs along the vale of the Thazarim River. At the top of

the  valley,  a  difficult  road  of  switchbacks  and  precipitous

drops snakes under the crest of the mountains for about ten

miles before dropping into the upper vale of the Copper River,

a tributary of the Clearflow. A great stone wall raised cen-

turies ago guards the top of the pass.

The Thazar is lower and easier than the Daggertooth, but

it is not as strategically important. Most travelers to Mul-

horand or Murghm simply take the road south from Pyara-

dos to Rauthil. In the ancient wars against Mulhorand, the

Pass of Thazar was much more important, as it offered an

eastern approach to Thay, but little of consequence has hap-

pened here in a long time.

SURAGUE ESCARPMENT

Like the First and Second Escarpments, the Surague is a long

line of steeply layered precipices climbing from the Plateau of

Thay toward the Sunrise Mountains. It is much more broken

and rugged than the other escarpments, sometimes vanishing

entirely for dozens of miles before reappearing. Most of the

Surague (the land above the escarpment) is at an elevation of

about 6,000 to 7,000 feet and quickly merges with the steep

foothills and sheer peaks of the Sunrise range.

The Thayans maintain few watchposts or fortresses along

this frontier, since the Sunrises are virtually impassable to any

but skilled mountaineers who know where theyre going. Slaves

hoping to escape into the mountains usually meet a quick end

from  the  arduous  conditions  or  the  hungry  monsters  that

plague the high vales. A few ragged bands of escaped slaves eke

out a hardscrabble existence in the lower slopes, fleeing the ap-

proach of Thayan forces and raiding down onto the plateau

when they dare. From time to time Thayan nobles organize

expeditions to hunt these wretches for sport.

Sunrise Mountains

The Sunrise Mountains, which many consider to mark the

eastern  end  of  Faern  proper,  run  all  the  way  from  the

center of Rashemen to just past the southeastern border of

Thay. They form the entirety of Thays eastern border, tow-

ering almost 15,000 feet above sea level. To get to the Thayan

portion of the Sunrise Mountains, a traveler must first tackle

the  Surague  Escarpment.  Few  find  even  this  to  be  worth-

while, as the Sunrises themselves are virtually impassable to

155

THAY

those on foot. As well, the lands above the Surague Escarp-

ment are wild and untended, nothing like the civilized plains

of the First Escarpment. They are teeming with dangerous

animals  and  hostile  humanoids.  From  time  to  time,  scouts

from  the  goblin  and  kobold  tribes  living  here  forage  into

Thay proper.

Every  now  and  then,  the  tharchions  of  Surthay,  Gauros,

Pyrados, and Thazalhar send an expedition into the peaks. Old

Raumviran towers and strongholds lie buried under the snows

of the high slopes, as well as the ancient well-like fortresses

of some even older people now forgotten by time. High and

perilous  passes  cross  the  mountains  at  Daggertooth  and

Thazar, but there have long been rumors of a secret passage

through  the  deeps  into  the  Endless  Wastes  beyond.  If  this

could be found and secured, it might divert the trade of the

Golden Way south to Thay and increase tenfold the power of

the tharchion whose people discovered the pass.

Scouts and adventurers have so far failed to discover such

a way through, despite centuries of searching. The dangers of

the  mountains  multiply  the  farther  one  descends  from  the

surface. The caverns beneath the Sunrise mountains are filled

with horrible creatures, including nagas, chimeras, and things

unspeakably worse.

The patrols along this edge of Thay are not as alert as those

of the nations other borders. The denizens of the mountains

rarely descend the Surague Escarpment to attack, and the idea

of invading force coming through the mountains is prepos-

terous. Border patrol here is considered one of the dullest and

most miserable jobs a soldier can get, so it often draws the less

ambitious of Thays defenders. No one ever became a thar-

chion on such duty, after all.

Surthay

Surthay is the northernmost of the tharchs. It stretches from

the Surmarsh in the west to the Gorge of Gauros in the east,

and it encompasses all Thayan land from the northern edge

of the First Escarpment down to Lake Mulsantir. Surthay was

originally Thays first line of defense against invasion from

Rashemen, but over the years, its become the springboard for

attacks against the barbarians to the north.

While the Surmarsh is technically within this tharch, Thar-

chion Homen Odesseiron (LE male human Evo6/Red1/Ftr12)

doesnt bother with it much. As long as the marshs lizard-

folk dont cross the River Thay, they are fine where they are.

Odesseiron gave up membership in the Red Wizards to pursue

a military career years ago, but he is not as foolishly aggres-

sive as Tharchion Kren of Gauros. Kren often pushes Odes-

seiron to join her in launching an attack against Rashemen,

despite the orders of the zulkirs. So far, Odesseiron has not

been persuaded of the wisdom in that act, although he allows

Kren to move her troops through Surthay on the pretext of

military exercises.

THE LONG PORTAGE

The River Thay cuts through the middle of the tharch on its

way from Lake Thaylambar to Lake Mulsantir below. Its im-

possible to navigate past the point where the river tumbles

down the First Escarpment. However, there is a long tradition

of portaging boats and goods up the escarpment, where a ship

can then work its way upriver to Lake Thaylambar and the

port at Eltabbar. The Guild of Portagers used to charge out-

rageous prices to move goods, three hundred or more years

ago. The Red Wizards of the time grew frustrated with the

arrangementhomicidally  so.  They  killed  most  of  the

portagers and animated them as zombies.

To  this  day,  tireless  zombies  handle  the  grunt  work  of

portaging. Although they can be clumsy, they are also obedi-

ent, and they never steal from their masters or their clients.

And,  unlike  traditional  slaves,  they  dont  have  to  be  fed,

clothed, or permitted to rest.

THE SURMARSH

The Surmarsh is a wide, fetid swamp on the southern shore of

the  western  end  of  Lake  Mulsantir,  at  the  point  where  the

River Sur flows into the lake. This cold and dreary place lies

beyond the effects of the Red Wizards weather magic and is

exposed to seemingly endless rains as the cold air of Ashanath

and Rashemen meets the warm, stationary air mass artificially

maintained  over  the  Plateau  of  Thay.  Fierce  thunderstorms

even in the depths of winter are not uncommon here.

The Surmarsh swarms with tribes of lizardfolk. These prim-

itive humanoids spend most of their energies struggling with

one another for supremacy over this soggy piece of land. Some

Red Wizards think the lizardfolk may be the descendants of

the serpent-people who built the Citadel, an ancient fortress

buried beneath the highest peak in the Thaymount. If that is

true, a once-proud folk have fallen a long, hard way.

Almost all the tribes here have a treaty of some sort with the

Red Wizards. The lizardfolk agree not to bother the Thayans of

the region, and the Red Wizards promise not to annihilate the

lizardfolk. The treaty specifically does not apply to foreigners

wandering through, whom the lizardfolk capture or kill and turn

over to the next Thayan patrol. This is usually rewarded with a

bounty of 10 gp worth of food per captive or corpse.

The lizardfolk of the Surmarsh consider it a great honor to

be drafted into any Thayan armed force. Many have proudly

served in the distant Umber Marshes during numerous cam-

paigns against Aglarond. Thayan nobles sometimes enter the

Surmarsh on hunting expeditions, employing the local lizard-

folk as porters and guides. The swamp is infested with dan-

gerous creatures, including ropers, otyughs, and beasts even

more threatening. The prize trophy of the land is the head of

a black dragon. A clan of the creatures lairs in the depths of

the Surmarsh, and dragons are routinely spotted soaring high

above the swamp. Finding such monsters is hard enough, and

besting  them  is  even  more  unlikely,  but  several  parties  of

nobles give it a try every year just the same.

156

THAY

Thaymount

The Thaymount is a not a single peak but a chain of volcanic

mountains in the middle of High Thay, the plateau above the

Second Escarpment. Knifelike ridges of rock and smoldering

cinder cones reach an altitude of more than 17,000 feet, and

soot-covered glaciers cling to their upper slopes. Access to this

region is restricted to Red Wizards and their guestsunau-

thorized visitors are executed on the spot.

Three rivers have their sources in Thaymounts ice-

covered peaks. The River Umber runs west

toward  the  Sea  of  Dlurg.  The  River

Lapendrar flows south to the Wizards

Reach, and the River Eltar pours east

into  Lake  Thaylambar,  the  largest

body of fresh water in the nation.

Eltabbar  may  be  the  capital  of

Thay,  but  Thaymount  is  the  nations

heart.  Private  fortresses  of  the  most

powerful Red Wizards are scattered

across  the  smoking  slopes  like

black  stars  in  a  fiery  sky.  Gold

mines,  volcanic  forges,  and  the

dark  barracks  of  elite  monstrous

troops, as well as the magical work-

shops and armories of the Red Wiz-

ards, cluster around the foothills of

the Thaymount. Many of the magic

items created for export, along with

deadlier  devices  the  Red  Wizards

keep for their own use, come from

these forbidding factories.

The Thaymount

The  troops  heremostly  gnolls,

blood  orcs,  darkenbeasts,  and  other

evil  creaturesnumber  in  the  thou-

sands. They stand ready to be launched

in  any  direction  their  masters  send

them.  The  current  peace  has  left

these aggressive warriors restless for

action. This pent-up violence has been

painful for the few foolhardy souls who

have trespassed in Thaymount over the past

couple of years, as the creatures take out their

frustrations on folk unfortunate enough to cross their paths.

Many of the Red Wizards fortresses contain laboratories

for dangerous experiments in magically influenced breeding.

The more promising results are sent out into the world to test

their abilities, striking fear into all who encounter them. The

greatest success so far has been the blood orcs, which have ex-

ceeded their creators wildest dreams. Now the Red Wizards

have started trying the same techniques on members of other

races  to  build  even  broader  populations  of  creatures  under

their  control.  (For  more  information,  see  the  Blooded  One

entry in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East.)

The Thaymounts peaks include a number of active volca-

noes. Ash falls and pyroclastic flows are more common than

lava fountains or explosive events. In recent years, the activity

157

of the Thaymount has been increasing, giving rise to stories

that  demons  imprisoned  there  before  the  founding  of  the

realm may be close to escaping. The earthquake that shook

Eltabbar a few years back broke the seals holding the demon

prince Eltab under the city, and rumor has it that this crea-

ture wasor still isbehind the latest geological troubles too.

Whats not in doubt is that the Red Wizards are more ag-

itated and secretive than usual. The sinister mages are spend-

ing  a  great  deal  of  time  and  effort  on  constructing  new

fortifications around their keeps. Some are even working to

connect their fortresses for mutual defense, something that

was almost unheard of just a few years ago.

Thazalhar

Thazalhar  is  the  smallest  of  the

tharchs outside of the islands of the

Alaor. It covers much of the land be-

tween  the  River  Thazarim  and  the

River of Dawn. This gives Tharchion

Milsantos  Daramos  (LN  male

human Ftr14) complete control over

any land routes between Thay and

Mulhorand.  In  the  realms  earliest

days, this tharch was a vital point of

defense  between  Thay  and  its  old

master.  For  a  long  time  after

that, it was a launching point for

Thayan troops rolling into Mul-

horand.  Today,  it  is  a  primary

conduit  of  trade  between  the

two formerly bitter enemies.

Daramos  is  the  only  one  of

the tharchions who is not evil, and

it shows in the way he governs his

territory. Many of the other thar-

chionsand  even  some  of  the

zulkirsthink  the  old  man  has

gotten  soft  in  his  later  years.  In

fact,  Daramos  has  never  cared  for

killing,  but  he  saw  it  as  necessary  to

protect  the  interests  of  his  people.  Hes

thrilled with the growing success of the trade

enclaves. A true patriot, Daramos hopes this method will fi-

nally allow the vicious Thayans to lay aside their differences

and work together. He knows he is past his prime and has no

chance  of  bringing  the  factions  under  a  single  banner,  but

perhaps Szass Tam has finally managed it, using money not

to purchase weapons but as a weapon. No other land could pos-

sibly stand against the might of a united Thay.

Thazalhars  main  source  of  income  is  the  bridge  fees  it

charges to pass over the River of Dawn into Thay (1 sp each

for Thayans and 10 gp each for everyone else). Some foreign

merchants pay the fees, but many sell their goods at a cut rate

to Thayans on the Mulhorandi side of the bridge, then turn

around and go home again.

THAY

Tyraturos

The tharch of Tyraturos is literally the crossroads of Thay.

The Eastern Way crosses the High Road at the city that gives

the tharch its name. This makes Tyraturos a hotbed of mer-

chant activity, particularly in the slave trade. Just about any

kind of slave can be found for sale here, including exotic crea-

tures  like  lamias,  centaurs,  and  the  normally  indomitable

drow. The tharchion here is a former priest of Waukeen by the

name  of  Dimon  (LN  male  human  Clr7  of  Bane)  who  con-

verted to the worship of Bane soon after the return of the

Black Lord. The rampant corruption of Thay led Dimon to

the worship of tyranny as a way to impose order on the squab-

bling factions of his homeland.

Tyraturos is the third-largest city in Thay, which makes it,

as  one  observer  noted,  one  of  the  filthiest  and  most  un-

pleasant cities in a filthy and unpleasant land. Over 50,000

souls call this pit home, but that number can double during

the high trade seasons of the spring and fall. While the city

is not walled, it features a central citadel that houses a gar-

rison  of  over  8,000  warriors  who  stand  ready  to  quell  any

problems that may erupt. Here a traveler can purchase just

about anythingor anyoneshe could want. Contraband of

all sorts used to be traded openly in Tyraturos, even though

such crimes are punishable by a quick death. Before the thar-

chions conversion, it was accepted practice to bribe any po-

tential prosecutor, but Dimon has discovered a new zeal for

law under the Black Lord, and he has put a stop to the cor-

ruption of his officers.

The tharchion taxes all goods moving along the great roads.

Until recently, customs officials could be persuaded to be cir-

cumspect  in  their  tax  assessments,  but  under  Dimons  new

laws,  they  are  no  longer  willing  to  accept  such  persuasion.

After Dimon made public examples of both the briber and the

recipient of the bribe by ordering both drawn and quartered,

the merchants of the city have resigned themselves to paying

up as a cost of doing business.

River Umber

Born in the Thaymounts high glaciers, the River Umber is a

steep, swift torrent with many cascades in the first hundred

miles of its length. At Nethentir, it spills out from its rapids

along the First Escarpment into the placid waters of Lake

Umber. From Lake Umber, the river is navigable all the way

to  the  Sea  of  Dlurg,  passing  through  a  broad  gap  in  the

Dragonjaw Mountains.

Vessels cannot ascend the Umber past Nethentir, but from

the  twin  towns  on  the  lake,  vessels  regularly  carry  Thayan

grain, fruit, and timber out to the Sea of Fallen Stars. The

Aglarondans at Emmech grudgingly allow Thayan cargo ves-

sels to pass unless Aglarond and Thay are at war, which has

not been the case for several years now.

People of Thay

Thay  is  a  land  of  divisions,  many  of  which  determine  a

persons place in society and her access to power. While the

vast majority of Thayans are human, there is a substantial hu-

manoid population as well. Most of the nonhumans are either

slaves or warriors in the various armed forces of the Red Wiz-

ards, but some have earned their emancipation.

Races and Cultures

Gnolls and orcs are the most common nonhuman humanoids

in Thay. They form the backbone of the Thayan armies, es-

pecially the gnolls, who are often placed in city garrisons to

keep the populace in line. The less-controllable orcs are usu-

ally employed as shock troops.

With the zulkirs current policy of peaceful trade, the orcs

often sit idle, itching for a fight of some sort. If one doesnt

come quickly enough, they end up rioting among themselves.

To keep this violence from overflowing into the rest of the

population, the Red Wizards have set up a regular series of

gladiatorial games. Orcs, gnolls, and other violent humanoids

are pitted against one another in blood matches for the en-

joyment of ever-growing crowds of spectators.

Goblins and halflings are also not uncommon in Thay, al-

though they are almost always slaves. Their lives may not be

as violent as those of the gnolls and orcs, but they are just as

short. Tieflings and other planetouched creatures can be found

here as well, although these rare folk are judged more by their

human ancestry than their physical appearance.

In addition to the nonhumans, Thay is home to two distinct

human cultures: the Rashemi and the Mulan.

MULAN

Mulhorandi blood runs thick in the veins of the Mulan. These

are the descendants of renegades who rebelled against the Mul-

horandi Empire 400 years ago, and since those fateful days,

they have retained the power they wrested from their distant

masters. Nearly all the Red Wizards are of Mulan extraction.

There are a few exceptions, and most of these pass themselves

off as the children of Mulan parents.

The Mulan people are tall and slim, sometimes to the point

of being gaunt. Their skin is sallow, and they usually remove

what little body hair they have by means magical or mundane.

They wear intricately designed tattoos in place of hair, usually

on their bare skulls and where their eyebrows once were. These

tattoos  often  represent  dragons,  demons,  devils,  and  other

creatures of ancient evil. They are extremely stylized, some-

times to the point of being cryptic runes or even abstract de-

signs. Many Red Wizards use tattoo magic, and the fashion of

tattooing arose from this. Even those without the power of

the Red Wizards wish to look as though they do.

Almost all nobles in Thay are of Mulan descent, although

not all Mulan are nobles. At worst, lowborn Mulan are free

158

THAY

farmers or artisans, although many seek power that does not

depend on their familys wealth, becoming bureaucrats, sol-

diers, or priests. For those with the aptitude, the path of the

Red Wizard lies open. In fact, most Red Wizards come from

Mulan families of relatively humble means (although high-

born Red Wizards have the advantage of personal wealth and

noble alliances to aid their advancement when they complete

their training).

RASHEMI

The common people in Thay are almost exclusively Rashemi,

kin to the folk of Rashemen. The Rashemi are a hardy people,

short and stocky with dusky skin and dark eyes. They all have

thick, dark hair, although most free Rashemi choose to shave

their scalps (or at the least, crop their hair quite short) to dis-

tinguish  themselves  from  slaves,  who  are  forbidden  to  cut

their hair. Wealthy Rashemi often have themselves tattooed

in the Mulan style.

Thayan Rashemi are not a conquered people, nor are they

oppressed. They do not have the same opportunities for ad-

vancement or wealth that people of Mulan descent do, but

they think of themselves as Thayans first. The Rashemi are

not happy about having the Mulan as their overlords, but they

are resigned to their lot and take fierce pride in the strength

and dark majesty of their land. Any Rashemi with sufficient

means  owns  slaves,  and  most  likely  treats  those  slaves  as

harshly as they are treated anywhere in Thay. Few Red Wiz-

ards are of Rashemi descent, but Rashemi make up the bulk

of Thays free soldiers. Many of the most elite military forces

are  composed  of  cruel  Rashemi  warriors  who  are  happy  to

serve the tharchions and Red Wizards.

Life and Society

There are four levels of Thayan society. They are, in order

of increasing influence: slaves, commoners, nobles, and Red

Wizards. Its no coincidence that this is also the decreasing

order of population. There are far more slaves in Thay than

any other group, but they have the least power. The Red Wiz-

ards,  on  the  other  hand,  have  few  members  but  easily  the

most power.

SLAVES

The lowest level of Thayan society is, of course, the slave. The

economy of Thay is built upon slave labor, and without it the

country would quickly collapse. The current trade in magic

items has changed this only a little, and it has not improved

the lives of slaves one whit.

Slaves are not considered citizens and have no rights. They

are chattels, like livestock. Killing or harming a slave is not

murder or mayhem. It is merely damaging someones prop-

erty. A slaves owner can do with his own slave as he wishes,

but  if  he  harms  someone  elses  property,  he  is  expected  to

make reparations.

Slaves are costly (a young human field slave sells for about

50 gp in the markets at Eltabbar), so few commoners have the

means to own them. Since slaves represent a significant in-

vestment  for  a  small  farmer  or  artisan,  common  Thayans

take good care of them. Slaves consigned to the broad estates

of noble Thayans face a harder existence, and those unfortu-

nate souls sold off to the vast state-run fields or mines are

treated as nothing more than beasts of burden.

Thay imports slaves from all over Faern, and just about

every race is represented among the servile population. Those

who survive the trip are usually the hardiest, but most do not

last long in their job. House slaves live in relative comfort,

caring directly for the needs of their Mulan masters. Those

consigned  to  the  mines  rarely  survive  a  year  of  scratching

metals from the unforgiving Underdark.

COMMONERS

As a whole, commoners do not have much better lives than

slaves  do.  However,  they  are  citizens,  not  property,  which

means they cant be indiscriminately tortured or killed. The

Red Wizards can usually get away with such behavior, but they

usually have to invent some sort of pretext for their actions.

Commoners have a far better life expectancy than slaves

and better prospects overall. The worst jobs go to slaves, so by

default, the commoners are a slight step up. Some have even

managed to claw their way to the top of the heap, usually by

becoming successful adventurers or wealthy merchants. A few

are actually wealthier than most of the nobles and even some

Red Wizards. Most commoners are Rashemi, although there

are a few members of this class from more distant lands.

NOBLES

Most of Thay is owned by ancient noble families of Mulan de-

scent. The dividing line between a well-off Mulan commoner

and an impoverished Mulan lord is starkly defined by ances-

try. Certain Mulan families are noble, and others arent. The

nobles of Thay are content to be governed by the Red Wiz-

ards (after all, the most influential mages in that order are

nobles themselves), but they jealously maintain control over

the elevation of commoners, even heroic ones, to noble status.

Nobles enjoy two paths to comfort, power, and wealth: land

and service. Wealthy nobles often own vast tracts of land and

make money by leasing it to those who reside upon it, whether

they are farmers, ranchers, or miners. Land ownership is not

restricted to the noble classes, but in practice, most land in

Thay is already owned by a noble, so it is difficult for a com-

moner to acquire land of his own.

Landless nobles (or those who simply wish to make some-

thing of themselves) often take up service in Thays army, bu-

reaucracy,  or  clergy.  While  any  free  Thayan  can  become  a

soldier, official, or priest, leaders are most often drawn from

the ranks of well-off nobles who purchase their rank or title.

For example, in a typical Thayan garrison, the captain is a

minor  landed  Mulan  noble,  his  officers  are  landless  Mulan

The slave market of Eltabbar

nobles, and his sergeants are Rashemi veterans. The troops, of

course, are mostly Rashemi. A noble who buys a good post can

enrich himself just as easily as one who owns a great estate:

It is expected that a powerful official or highly-placed officer

will divert a certain amount of taxes for his own use.

THE RED WIZARDS

At an early age, noble children are carefully examined for any

signs  of  arcane  talent.  Any  who  are  shown  to  have  even  a

small  aptitude  are  immediately  inducted  into  wizardry

school, followed by a long and arduous apprenticeship to a Red

Wizard. Those who survive their apprenticeship and are am-

bitious, resourceful, and talented are invited to join the Red

Wizards. Some refuse the red robes, but this is rare: Becom-

ing a Red Wizard is such an obvious path to power that the

zulkirs dont need to recruit anyone.

The Red Wizards are the ruling class of this magocracy. Its

illegal for any Red Wizard to take on an apprentice of other

than Mulan blood. Some still do, however, and its usually an

open secret. At any given time, most Red Wizards claim up to

a dozen apprentices (in game terms, wizards who have not yet

acquired  their  first  level  in  the  Red  Wizard  prestige  class),

whom they keep at one anothers throats to advance their own

schemes. Apprentices exist to serve as the masters agents, min-

ions, and thralls. What magical training they gain in the process

is determined solely by their own ambition and initiative.

Only Red Wizards are permitted to wear red robes, their

badge of office. The penalty for posing as one is instant death

at the hands of the first Red Wizard to uncover the deception.

The Red Wizards are ruled by a council of eight zulkirs, one

representing each of the eight schools of magic. These posi-

tions are for lifethe only way a zulkir would ever deign to

leave office would be feet first. Within each school exists an

elaborate pecking order, in which standing is determined by

magical ability and the patronage of more powerful wizards.

The current leader of the council is Szass Tam, the zulkir of

necromancy.

The Red Wizards are evil through and through. Their ul-

timate goal is nothing less than world domination, and they

have spent much of Thays history in pursuit of that effort

by military means. Its only within the past few years that

they have set aside the ways of war in favor of more insidi-

ous, economic methods.

ECONOMY

Thays economy has traditionally been borne on the backs of

the vast number of slaves who are brought into the country

in chains. With the increase of trade in magic items over the

past few years, the number of slaves sold in Thay hasnt gone

down one bit. In fact, now that Thay has enclaves in just about

every  major  city  of  Faern,  its  merchants  have  even  more

access to slaves, and the slave population is actually growing.

160

THAY

Revenue from the sale of discounted magic items in the en-

claves has far exceeded expectations. Thayan merchants have

long  traded  their  nations  goods  throughout  the  world,  but

they are finding their wares in high demand these days. Before

the change in policy, the vast bulk of Thayan exports were raw

foodstuffs, timberincluding that of the highly prized black-

wood treeand Thayan artwork, jewelry, and crafts, mostly

fashioned by skilled slaves. Such trade continues to this day,

cementing Thay as a mercantile powerhouse.

Everyone the Thayans do business with is aware of their

horrible history and their evil ways. The prices and quality of

their wares, however, are just too good to turn down. This suits

Szass Tam and the rest of the zulkirs, who have not given up

their goal of world domination. The current plan is to use the

greed  of  other  people  as  a  tool  against  them.  Bearing  dis-

counted goods, Thayans should be able to work their way into

every major economy on Faern. Once the Red Wizards have

become entrenched in a nation, they can learn enough about

the locals to dismantle them quietly from within.

Not all the zulkirs agree with this policy. This is particu-

larly true of the more aggressive leaders such as Aznar Thrul,

as well as those who arent in a position to line their own pock-

ets with the wealth brought in by this new venture, such as

Zulkir  Nevron  of  the  school  of  conjuration.  As  with  most

large projects in Thay, this one could be brought low at any

point by the bickering of the zulkirs.

LAW AND ORDER

Anyone, foreigner or Thayan, traveling in Thay must carry

a pass issued by a tharchion allowing the traveler to use spe-

cific roads and visit specific cities. All tharchions delegate the

task of issuing passes to minor officials and officers, which

means that a travel permit for most points can be purchased

with a suitable bribe (generally, 10 to 50 gp for foreigners).

Soldiers, messengers, and officials engaged in the perform-

ance  of  their  duties  are  exempt  from  the  requirement  to

obtain permission to travel, but they generally carry tokens

of their authority.

Outsiders traveling without authorization find it difficult,

if  not  impossible,  to  move  about  the  plateau.  Patrols  con-

stantly  scour  the  roads  and  byways,  searching  for  escaped

slaves (and the occasional brigand, criminal, or foreign spy).

The penalty for being caught is usually death. Those found

inside a Red Wizards estate, on the other hand, are in for an

even worse fate as the subject of painful magical experiments.

The laws of Thay are simple, and the penalties are brutal.

They are mostly concerned with establishing whos in power.

The tharchions and zulkirs consult a set of tomes known as the

Library of Law when faced with a serious problem. However,

most of the time, the authorities ignore these books in favor

of expediency. These are the most important laws of Thay.

Only Red Wizards may wear red robes, so that all shall be able

to identify them instantly.

Do not steal from other Thayans or harm their belongings,

especially their slaves.

Do not kill or harm another Thayan. (In practice, this means,

Do not kill or harm anyone from your class or above.)

Obey the orders of your betters.

The  proscription  against  wearing  red  robes  is  unusual,  but

Thayans take it so seriously that most refuse to dress in any

clothing of that color. The penalty for being caught in such

garb is execution on the spot. Its rumored that some of the

forces of the Red Wizards always carry a spare red robe or two.

This is then supposedly thrown onto the body after the guards

have killed someone, giving them an excuse for their actions.

The laws of Thay are enforced by whoever claims to have

jurisdiction over the people involved or the location in which

the  disturbance  occurred.  In  Thay,  just  about  every  Red

Wizard employs slaves or commoners as private guards. The

more  powerful  the  person,  the  more  numerous  and  more

skilled the guards. In Thay, might makes right, and the Red

Wizards have plenty of might. The trouble comes when more

than one group of guards claims jurisdiction over any partic-

ular issue. This happens often, and when it does, a fight usu-

ally breaks out.

DEFENSE AND WARCRAFT

Thay is a military powerhouse, its combined armies outnum-

bering those of all its neighbors put together. However, due

to a lack of cooperation between the various forces, Thay has

never been as effective as it should be.

Each zulkir and tharchion is expected to form a body of

troops known as a legion. Only a sponsors resources limit the

legions makeup and size. Other Red Wizards are permitted

household forces or bodyguards, too. The wealthiest of them

may have thousands of troops at their disposal. Sadlyor for-

tunately,  depending  on  ones  point  of  viewthe  disparate

Thayan  forces  work  together  as  poorly  as  do  their  leaders.

Only during extreme threats to the entire nation are the var-

ious armies able to put aside their differences and work with

one another. Even then, their cooperation is hardly complete.

The  various  legions  include  a  motley  conglomeration  of

races and even monsters in their numbers. Goblin slaves, orc

and half-orc mercenaries, and human cavalry are the most pop-

ular troops. Gnolls are common, but due to their cowardly na-

tures, they are most often deployed as skirmishers and raiders

rather than as front-line troops. Companies of hill giants, ogres,

and trolls make terrifying foes on the field of battle.

Cavalry  units  use  many  different  kinds  of  mounts,  in-

cluding creatures not ridden anywhere else in Faern. Cen-

taurs,  manticores,  leucrottas,  griffons,  hippogriffs,  giant

beetles, and even dragons serve Thays elite troops, although

horses are much more common. The most notorious units fea-

ture female riders mounted on the feared black unicorns bred

by  the  Red  Wizards.  The  best-known  army  of  Thay  is  the

Griffon Legion, a group of some four hundred Red Wizards

commanded by the tharchion of Pyaradoscurrently Thar-

chion Nymia Focarsoaring through the skies on the backs

of griffons.

161

THAY

The  most  successful  soldier-breeding  program  in  recent

years has been the blooded ones, or blood orcs. Fierce, loyal,

and  physically  powerful,  the  blooded  ones  make  excellent

shock troops. Its now rare to find a legion that doesnt have

at least one unit of blood orcs in it. The Red Wizards are ex-

perimenting on other races with the techniques used to create

blooded ones, too, so it may be only a matter of time before

even more blood races are seen in the armies of Thay.

Few  of  Thays  cities  have  walls  or  other  defenses.  The

Thayans  regard  the  First  Escarpment  as  a  wall  around  the

entire country and plan to halt invaders at the edge of the

precipice.  Thayan  cities  that  lie  below  the  escarpment

(Bezantur, for example) are often protected by extensive walls.

The first line of defense for Thay is the constant and vigor-

ous patrolling of both its borders and its interior. This pro-

vides  the  zulkirs  with  an  early  warning  system  that  allows

them plenty of time to respond to any massive attack.

RELIGION

Arcane magic is supreme in Thay, but even the most jaded of

the Red Wizards cant deny the power of the gods. Even the

zulkirs at least pay lip service to a chosen deity. To do other-

wise is to invite retribution. Evil deitiesBeshaba, Loviatar,

Shar, Talona, Umberlee, and Gargauth the Outcastare openly

worshiped. Veneration of good gods is not forbidden, but it is

discouraged. Still, the Red Wizards know that there are times

when anyoneeven a lawful good deitycan come in handy,

so they rarely advocate the burning of any metaphorical bridges.

The most widespread and powerful faith in Thay is that of

Kossuth, the Lord of Flames. The Thayans find the neutral-

aligned  elemental  deities  to  be  a  good  match  for  their  op-

pressive  land.  The  tenets  of  good  deities  such  as  Tyr  or

Lathander stand in direct opposition to the hierarchy built by

the Red Wizards, and evil deities demand the submission of

their followers. Kossuth represents power and mastery with-

out constraints, and so he finds favor among the Red Wizards.

Kossuths  faith  enjoys  a  primacy  of  position  and  numerous

special  considerations  in  Thayan  society.  Clerics  of  the

Firelord are among the very few people a Red Wizard cannot

harm or kill with impunity.

The  worship  of  Bane  has  had  a  long  tradition  in  Thay.

While the church of the Black Lord suffered after the Time

of Troublesduring which Cyric arose to take Banes place

the return of Bane has resulted in strong and well-organized

churches  of  both  Bane  and  Cyric  in  Thay.  A  number  of

Thayans venerate Mask, and this number has been steadily but

quietly  growing  in  the  past  few  years.  Shars  faith  is  also

strongly ensconced in Thay.

The brutal humanoids in the service of the Red Wizards

continue  to  worship  their  own  pantheons.  Orcs  venerate

Gruumsh, much as they do elsewhere, and gnolls worship the

demon-god Yeenoghu.

A common misconception outside Thay is that the Red Wiz-

ards worship demons and devils. Actually, many ambitious Red

Wizards do make regular contact with such evil outsiders, but

only to strike bargains with the creatures. The Red Wizards

consider themselves the equals of such beingsat least, when

they band together as a group, just as they did when they sum-

moned the demon Eltab to help them in their quest for in-

dependence from Mulhorand.

Adventurers

Outlanders are observed suspiciously throughout Thay. The

zulkirs have done enough spying of their own over the cen-

turies to know they are likely being spied on too. This is es-

pecially  true  because  of  the  anti-scrying  magic  that  covers

most of the country. The only way for most foreign govern-

ments  to  learn  what  is  happening  in  Thay  is  by  sending  in

spies to handle the investigation personally.

Thus, its hard for a party of adventurers to get into Thay

without being watched. Those suspected of espionage are sum-

marily executed, and most Red Wizards arent above accusing

troublesome innocents of espionage just to have an excuse to

kill them.

However,  the  zulkirs  have  realized  that  there  are  times

during which a group of adventurers might come in handy.

There are many ruins scattered about Thay, for instance, es-

pecially  in  Delhumide  and  in  the  Sunrise  Mountains.  The

zulkirs and tharchions permit adventurers to poke around in

such  places,  as  long  as  they  get  a  cut  of  any  profits.  They

manage this in several ways, from overcharging for supplies

to selling permits to actually demanding a share of treasure.

Adventurers can stay at many inns across Thay. However,

the locals are wary of people who are ignorant of the ways of

the nation. There are just too many ways to run afoul of the

Red Wizards and their cronies for most people to feel com-

fortable around visitors. On the other hand, many common-

ers and even some nobles see such newcomers as the perfect

pawns in their schemes, unschooled as they are in the art of

Thayan politics.

Politics and Power

In Thay, politics and power are inextricably related. Those in

charge are those who have the power to take charge. Most of

the  Red  Wizards  (essentially  the  ruling  class)  are  of  noble

birth and would command obedience and fealty in any land by

virtue of their bloodlines alone, but those at the very top

the zulkirshave to claw their way there.

The growing wealth of the Guild of Foreign Trade may be

changing  this  time-honored  tradition.  The  Guilds  officers

have been catapulted to astounding wealth by the success of

the mercantile enclaves. The wisest among them realize that

such power can be ephemeral, especially if the more warlike

tharchs and zulkirs get their way, so they are doing every-

thing  they  can  to  secure  their  long-term  positions.  Chief

among  these  is  Master  of  the  Guild  Samas  Kul  (LE  male

human  Tra7/Red8),  the  organizations  top  officer.  He  has

made himself one of the most influential and powerful Red

Wizards, second only to the zulkirs.

THAY

History of Thay

Ever since its founding, Thay has been ruled by ambitious wiz-

ards who believe their ultimate destiny is to rule the world. Al-

though they have extended their rule into the Wizards Reach

and the Lapendrar vale, theyve had less success in subjugat-

ing the neighboring realms of Aglarond and Rashemen. How-

ever,  with  the  opening  of  Thayan  enclaves  in  cities  across

Faern, the Red Wizards can finally claim to have extended

their territory across most of the continent. Before an enclave

is built, the Red Wizards insist that the local government cede

the land to Thay, and Thays laws apply within the walls of

these disparate and far-flung places.

Government

In  Thay,  the  eight  zulkirs  run  the  country  by  consensus,

built through debate that sometimes borders on open feud-

ing. Of them all, Szass Tam has the most influence over his

fellows. He is the most powerful of them, and in his long

years as a lich he has entrenched himself so deeply that he

could  never  be  forced  from  office  by  anything  short  of  a

very permanent death.

163

THAY

The zulkirs appoint tharchions, or governors, to run the

eleven tharchs. These tharchions in turn appoint a number

of local bureaucrats called autharchs to oversee various lo-

cations and projects for them. Autharchs are often replaced

quickly, always at the whim of their tharchion. Those who

are  incompetent  are  removed  soon  after  being  discovered.

Those who are successful are promoted to tharchion as soon

as theres an opening, but many of the current tharchions,

not wishing to lose their jobs, engineer the downfall of such

hopefuls to eliminate contenders. Only the truly ruthless and

resourceful manage to work their way up to the rank of thar-

chion, and theyre not going to go down without a fight.

The leader of a trade enclave is called a khazark. This po-

sition is supposedly equal in rank to an autharch, but in prac-

tice, it is even more respected, because only Red Wizards can

hold such rank. Members of any class can become tharchions,

the highest post in the land to which a Thayan can aspire who

is not one of the Red Wizards.

There is supposed to be a chain of command in which the

zulkirs hand orders down to the tharchions and khazarks, and

they to their inferiors, and so on until commoners boss around

slaves. In reality, the zulkirs order around whomever they like,

whenever they like. None dare tell them they should work dif-

ferently. The problem is that the zulkirs end up being the only

ones who can see the big picture. Since there are eight of them,

each with their personal agenda, each issues orders that are

often in direct conflict with others. It is then up to subordi-

nate Thayans to choose which master to follow and hope they

can  escape  the  wrath  of  the  zulkir  whose  orders  they  were

forced to ignore.

This  inherent  problem  with  the  Thayan  government  has

proved to be its weak point again and again. Because there is

no one in charge of everything, no one responsible for making

it all work, the various factions in Thay end up spending more

time battling one another than carrying out their plans for

world domination. This has been a saving grace for the rest

of Toril. Should a single zulkir ever manage to take full con-

trol of the nation, the rest of the world is in for a rough ride.

The latest example of Thayan disharmony is the fact that

not every zulkir and tharchion is behind the make trade, not

war doctrine the zulkirs are currently following. Tharchion

Homen  Odesseiron  of  Surthay,  for  instance,  is  planning  to

launch an invasion of Rashemen soon, largely at the urging

of Tharchion Azhir Kren of Gauros, who is itching for a fight.

Both tharchions feel they have been shut out of the prosper-

ity brought about by the trade boom, and they are desperate

to reestablish themselves as the figures of importance they

were during Thays more warlike years.

Both Odesseiron and Kren have been massing their forces

for  months.  They  plan  to  take  Mulsantir  before  anyone,

zulkirs  and  the  Rashemi  alike,  realizes  what  is  happening.

They believe that if they succeed, there will be no complaints

from Eltabbar. If they fail, they hope to be dead enough to

be beyond even the necromantic grasp of Szass Tam.

For more details on the Red Wizards and the specific people

who rule Thay, see the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting

and the Lords of Darkness accessory.

Enemies

From Thays point of view, every other nation in the world

is its foe. It used to be that the Thayans expressed this belief

openly, making diplomatic efforts pointless. In recent years,

as  a  part  of  their  trade  plans,  they  have  toned  down  their

rhetoric. The Red Wizards see themselves and their way of life

as superior to all else, but they are circumspect enough not to

tattoo  this  on  their  own  foreheads  or  on  those  of  their  de-

feated foesfor now.

AGLAROND

Over the centuries, the Aglarondans have been Thays most

implacable foe. From the Thayan point of view, the peninsula

of Aglarond must be theirs. Its a perfect point from which

to launch offensives into the other lands surrounding the Sea

of Fallen Stars. If the land is not in Thayan hands, its the

primary spot from which any counteroffensive against Thay

would likely begin.

Despite their best efforts, the soldiers of Thay have never

been able to penetrate Aglarond. The Dragonjaw Mountains

and the Yuirwood defend the country almost as thoroughly as

the First Escarpment guards Thay, and the Aglarondans have

made the most of these advantages. The primary example of

this  is  the  Watchwall,  which  keeps  the  Red  Wizards  from

sending  undead  troops  through  the  treacherous  Umber

Marshes into Aglarond.

The  Red  Wizards  have  an  especially  cold  hatred  in  their

rotten hearts for the Simbul. It frustrates them to no end that

a womanand a sorcerer to bootcan thwart their combined

efforts. The zulkirs are elated that the Simbul agreed to the

most recent truce, but they are suspicious at the same time.

They hope she will soon permit them to place an enclave in

Glarondar, but they know it will require far more to worm

their way into Aglarond than simply asking.

MULHORAND

To  the  Thayans,  Mulhorand  is  the  gateway  to  southern

Faern. Also, it is the motherland of the Mulan people, whom

the Red Wizards would love to unite under a single banner.

However, Mulhorand, once a nation in decline, is on the rise

once again.

Thay  has  tried  to  invade  Mulhorand  a  number  of  times

over the centuries since winning its independence. The largest

problem has always been the geography of the region. Only a

narrow strip of land along the Sunrise Mountains allows Thay

to march an army south. The Mulhorandi always patrol this

territory, so the Thayans have a hard time getting far into the

country. Likewise, the Mulhorandi Empire has attacked Thay

on more than one occasion, hoping to recapture their long-lost

northern province and forge an unstoppable giant in eastern

Faern.

Foiled by the stalemate in the north, Mulhorand recently

turned west and invaded decrepit Unther. Like everyone else,

164

THAY

the Red Wizards have little love for Gilgeam the Tyrant, but

they also have no desire to see Mulhorand accomplish any-

thing easily. They hope to mire the Mulhorandi army in years

of anarchy and chaos in the wreckage of Unther and are fun-

neling gold, magic, and mercenaries south to prop up the rem-

nant of Gilgeams domain.

RASHEMEN

Rashemen has been the subject of more Thayan invasion at-

tempts than any other country. The land itself seems to work

against the Red Wizards. The reason for so many invasions of

Rashemenand so many failuresis that the tharchions of

Surthay and Gauros usually hurl their forces across Lake Mul-

santir with little to no preparation. They often have some sort

of  guaranteed  scheme  that  never  works  out.  Some  of  the

darkest jokes told around Rashemi inns concern foolish Red

Wizards and their latest plans.

If  Tharchions  Azhir  Kren  and  Homen  Odesseiron  have

their way, though, the Rashemi will soon trade their laughter

for tears. The two leaders have been secretly massing forces

along  the  southern  shore  of  Lake  Mulsantir  with  an  eye

toward a lightning strike on the city of Mulsantir itself.

Cities and Sites

Thay is a large and long-settled country. Its great plateau is

covered  with  towns,  settlements,  and  villages,  as  well  as  a

number of major cities. The cities of Thay are crowded and

dirty, mostly because great portions of the populationthe

slaves and their humanoid guardslive in filth and squalor.

The poor and enslaved live in little better than hovels made

of adobe.

The wealthy and the powerful inhabit a completely differ-

ent world. Their sprawling villas are surrounded by walled gar-

dens designed not only to provide privacy but also to keep out

the noises and smells of the city. These brick or stone build-

ings are often several stories high, emphasizing the fact that

the powerful in Thay are above the rabble physically as well

as metaphorically.

Amruthar (METROPOLIS)

The city of Amruthar is independent of Thay, despite the fact

that it sits in the middle of the tharch of Lapendrar. Four

hundred years ago, when the Red Wizards launched their over-

throw of Mulhorandi rule, a powerful satrap named Sekhotet

governed the southwestern sector of the province, ruling from

this  city.  Sekhotet  desired  to  govern  his  lands  without  an-

swering to a pharaoh in Skuld, so he threw in with the wizards,

aiding and abetting their rebellion. The price Sekhotet asked

was a free hand to rule Amruthar as he liked. Sekhotets line

has long since died out, but the zulkirs have honored the letter

of their agreement with the Mulhorandi lords successors.

Amruthar  may  still  be  independent,  but  its  commonly

known that its current ruler, Hierarch Numos Thal (LE male

human Ari9), is merely a puppet of the zulkirs. He and the

rest of the aristocracy of the city are well paid for their com-

placency, and in turn, they surrender a portion of all finan-

cial transactions made in the city to Thay. The arrangement

has worked well for centuries, and neither the hierarch nor the

zulkirs see any reason to change it.

This is not true for many of Amruthars citizens, though.

Three factions vie for the chance to lead the people in a rev-

olution against their corrupt and decadent leaders. The largest

group is known as the Realists. They wish to depose the hier-

arch while maintaining the citys relationship with Thay. They

know that their city could never stand against the forces of

the Red Wizards, so their leaders curry favor with the zulkirs.

In truth, if the zulkirs have a falling out with the hierarch,

theyd be happy to let the Realists take over, but that day isnt

here yet.

The members of the second-largest faction are known as In-

dependents. They want to sever all ties with Thay and trans-

form  Amruthar  into  a  true  city-state.  The  Independents

realize that Thay would have a problem with this, but they

hope the old agreement of Sekhotet and Thays current pros-

perity  might  dissuade  the  zulkirs  from  seizing  the  city  by

force  of  arms.  In  the  meantime,  they  advocate  the  quiet

growth of Amruthars military and economic might, hoping

to strengthen the city for the eventual break.

The smallest faction call themselves the Westerners. They

wish to join Aglarond, bringing their city under the protection

of another land. The zulkirs would never allow this, of course,

and while the Simbul is sympathetic to Amruthars plight, she

is  not  prepared  to  commit  herself  to  fight  a  war  on  Am-

ruthars  behalf.  Aglarond  has  traditionally  excelled  at  de-

fending its borders, but even the most rabid Thay-haters in

Velprintalar do not think it possible to fight the Red Wizards

on the Plateau of Thay and win. Hierarch Thal is anxious to

stamp out any public debate along these lines, fearing that the

Westerners in their folly might provide the zulkirs with the

excuse to end Amruthars special independence.

Bezantur (METROPOLIS)

Eltabbar may be the capital of Thay, but Bezantur has

long been the commercial center of the realm. The city

is the capital of the tharch of Priador and is

the  largest  port  in  the  Red  Wizards

domain.  For  centuries,  Thayan

cotton,  fruit,  and  grain  flowed

through  Bezantur,  enriching  the

masters  of  the  city  and  the  thar-

chion,  but  the  wealth  pouring  in

now  is  unimaginable.  To  Bezantur

flow the gold, goods, and slaves ex-

changed in dozens of Thayan enclaves

across the Sea of Fallen Stars, so it is

not only the largest city in Thay but

by far the wealthiest.

Black-walled  Bezantur  squats

on  the  northern  shore  of  the

Alamber  Sea.  Artisans,  mer-

chants, priests, and soldiers live

crammed  within  its  walls,

while  beyond  sprawls  an  im-

mense and squalid shantytown

of commoners and slave pens.

No tree grows within twenty

miles of the city; great ship-

yards even larger than those of

the  Alaor  lie  along  the  shore

beyond  its  walls,  employing

hundreds  of  carpenters  and  ship-

wrights and thousands of slaves.

On  the  eastern  side  of  the  city,

within  newly  built  walls  even  higher  and  stronger

than  the  citys  own,  stands  the  Guild  of  Foreign

Trade, the heart of Thays sinister enterprise to enslave the

West through commerce.

THE CENTRAL CITADEL

This  heavily  fortified  structure  is  one  of  Bezanturs  most

notable landmarks, dominating the city center. Made of hewn

black stone stacked tall enough to be seen from any place in

the  city,  the  Central  Citadel  is  the  first  building  visible  to

people  approaching  Bezantur,  even  before  the  low  shanties

mounded up against the outside of the wall like rats nesting.

The citadel houses the legion of Aznar Thrul (zulkir of evo-

cation and tharchion of the Priador) as well as his own luxu-

rious  private  quarters.  These  armed  forces  include  nearly

5,000  gnolls,  humans,  goblins,  darkenbeasts,  and  creatures

even more foul.

The  previous  tharchionwho  most  believe  to  be  long

deadsecretly lives here as well. Mari Agneh has been bent

entirely to Thruls will, and he keeps her as a private slave, oc-

casionally trotting her out at his most debauched private par-

ties  to  demonstrate  his  power.  Thrul  is  fond  of  magical

experimentation, and he keeps a number of well-stocked

laboratories here, as well as dungeons filled with fresh

victims for his trials.

THE GUILD OF

FOREIGN TRADE

Thays  foreign  enclaves  are

administered  through  the

Guild  of  Foreign  Trade,

headquartered in a vast com-

plex  of  warehouses,  vaults,

and fortresslike offices domi-

nating  the  eastern  end  of

Bezanturs harbor. The Guild

has existed for hundreds of

years,  issuing  licenses  to

Thayans wishing to import

or export goods, but in the

last twenty years, its spon-

sorship  of  mercantile  en-

claves  dealing  in  magic

items  has  catapulted  the

Guild from a small, corrupt

bureaucracy to a vast, corrupt,

state-sponsored industry.

The  guild  is  naturally  obsessed

with the safety of its valuable mer-

chandise, and its vaults are guarded

by hundreds of wizards, skilled war-

riors, and monstrous creatures. Thousands

of laborers and slaves toil at its docks and ware-

houses,  loading  and  unloading  the  yellow-sailed

dromonds  that  carry  the  output  of  magic  workshops  to

Thayan  concessions  and  quarters  across  the  Inner  Sea.  The

dromonds  return  even  more  heavily  laden  than  they  were

when  they  set  out,  since  most  of  the  goods  exchanged  for

Thayan magic items are bulkier and heavier than a cargo of

potions, scrolls, and wondrous items.

The Master of the Guild of Foreign Trade is a brilliant Red

Wizard named Samas Kul (LE male human Tra7/Red8). Am-

bitious and cynical, Samas Kul is known for his acidic sarcasm

and urbane manner. He is a tall, corpulent man who flaunts

his wealth shamelessly, bedecking himself with gem-studded

robes  and  rings  worth  thousands  of  gold  pieces.  Some  of

Samas Kuls colleagues have mistakenly dismissed him as a

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

Hundreds of artisans, merchants, and laborers fill Bezanturs

commercial districts. The most important part of the citys

economy, however, are the docks that run the length of the

citys shore. Hundreds of ships from every land on the Sea of

Fallen Stars are moored to these stone quays or rock gently

at anchor in the bay beyond, waiting for their turn to tie up

and take on cargo.

The docks range widely in quality and safety. Some rival the

finest in the world; others amount to a rocky patch of shore

where one might shove a rowboat. No matter where a ships

master moors, however, she can expect to be charged for the

privilege. In the better parts of town, the docking fee earns

her top-level service and protection from the ever-emboldened

members of the local thieves guild. In the worst parts, she is

essentially paying the local thugs not to rob her. If they keep

anyone else from robbing her too, so much the better.

A traveler can find just about any kind of legitimate mer-

chandise imaginable within the citys walls. For those in search

of something less legitimate, Tharchion Thrul has long turned

a blind eye toward any dealings in Market Town, a cluster of

shacks  that  cozy  up  against  the  citys  mighty  walls  like  re-

moras near a sharks gills.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Once of Bezanturs many nicknames is the City of a Thousand

Temples. Just about every god in every pantheon on the face

of  Faern  is  represented  here.  This  is  one  of  the  few  major

cities in which evil deities are worshiped proudly and openly,

and some of their most magnificent temples are in Bezantur.

Only the patronage of Mystra and Azuth is forbidden; the Red

Wizards  jealously  guard  access  to  arcane  knowledge  by  any

means outside of their own tutelage. The most popular gods

among Bezanturs people are Umberlee and Mask.

The Temple of Umberlee is monstrously large, carved from

massive blocks of blue-veined green marble, reminiscent of the

watery domain of the goddess of the deep. Traditionally, Um-

berlee is honored with wealth thrown from a ships railing into

the waters of the open sea. The people of Bezantur have re-

fined this a bit. Instead, they rob the captains of ships, throw

some of their ill-gotten gains in the water, pocket some of it

for themselves, and bring the remainder to this temple. Those

who brave the shark-, sahuagin-, and monster-infested waters

of Bezanturs harbor to gather loot offered up to the Bitch

Queen invariably suffer death by drowning, no matter how far

from the sea they flee.

The Temple of Mask doubles as the headquarters of the ex-

tremely powerful thieves guild. Its leader, Guildmistress Sha-

bella  the  Pale  (NE  female  human  Rog7/Clr11  of  Mask),

struggles to maintain her position against an incursion by the

Shadowmasters of Telflamm. The guild here controls nearly

all of the illegal activities in and around Bezantur, making it

167

THAY

too  juicy  a  target  for  the  Shadowmasters  to  pass  up.  The

thieves in the city are choosing sides, and an alarming number

have thrown in their lot with the Theskians, weary of Sha-

bellas tyranny.

The Citadel

The Citadel was already carved into the peak of one of the

highest mountains in the Thaymount when the first humans

explored this strange and marvelous region. The identity of

the places original owners has been lost in the swirls of time,

but murals and carvings found in its lowest halls depict an

advanced lizardfolk civilization destroyed so long ago as to

be forgotten. Its possible that the lizardfolk of the Surmarsh

are  descendants  of  this  ancient  people,  but  if  so,  their  fall

from  grace  was  particularly  hard.  The  primitive  lizardfolk

wouldnt have the first idea how to go about creating such an

amazing place.

The Citadelnot to be confused with the dozens of lesser

citadels scattered about the countryhas long been off-limits

to the Thayan people. Foreigners are not even supposed to be

told of its existence. In earlier years, the Red Wizards sent ex-

peditions into the place to explore as much of it as they could.

Some  returned  with  treasure,  including  gold,  artwork,  and

even powerful magic items. However, more often than not,

the parties of explorers never returned at all. Those brave (or

simply lucky) souls who did return spoke of a vast network of

tunnels beneath the mountain, infested with the more noto-

rious subterranean races, including troglodytes and drow.

One of the more successful ventures retrieved a tome that

describes the lower levels of the Citadel in detail. A portion

of the place, known as the Paths of the Doomed, is a maze of

tunnels occupied by all sorts of monsters. How they got there

and why they stay remains a mystery to this day. Zulkir Szass

Tam has confiscated the book for his own studies, and few out-

side of his direct circle of peersthe other zulkirshave ever

actually seen it, much less read from it.

Today, only a select few of the most prominent Red Wiz-

ards are permitted anywhere near the known entrances to the

Citadel. Whether the zulkirs are trying to keep intruders out

or keep something even more dangerous in, only they can say.

Ruins of Delhumide

Delhumide (the city, not the tharch named after it) was the

provincial capital back when Thay was just another part of

the Mulhorandi Empire. When the Thayans rebelled against

Mulhorand in 922 DR, they summoned a number of demons

to  help  them  in  their  quest  for  freedom.  These  creatures

razed  the  once-proud  city  to  the  ground,  removing  the

largest symbol of Mulhorandi might forever from the face

of Thay.

Today, no structure in the ruins of Delhumide stands taller

than one story high. However, the labyrinthine tunnel system

that  ran  beneath  the  old  city  remains  intact.  Rumor  has  it

that the subterranean depths are filled with dangerous crea-

tures,  including  demons  that  evaded  the  Red  Wizards  at-

tempts  to  dismiss  them  back  to  the  Abyss  after  the  evil

creatures had outlived their usefulness.

Tharchion Metron has little interest in exploring the ruins,

despite  the  rumors  of  great  treasure  that  have  surrounded

them since their creation. His predecessor lost his life in just

such an expedition, despite Metrons warning not to go. So far,

the unusual Thayan peace has been good to the tharch of Del-

humide, and Metron has no desire to tamper with what has

been  working  for  him.  If  times  get  tough,  though,  he  may

become  desperate  enough  to  poke  around  in  the  rubble  for

something that can solidify his position.

In the meantime, the ruins of Delhumide are a common

destination for adventurers of all stripes. Metron has come up

with a clever scheme to put this to his advantage. The patrols

within Metrons tharch are under orders to keep track of out-

landers heading into Delhumideor any of the other near-

by ruins, for that matter. Once the intruders enter, the patrols

call for help, then surround the ruins and wait for the

adventurers to emerge. In this way, Metron gets adventurers

to do the dangerous work of rummaging around in the un-

derground  chambers,  while  he  reaps  the  ill-gotten  fruits  of

their labors.

Some captured groups of adventurers are sent into the ruins

time and time again. They are permitted to live as long as they

continue to bring back treasure and magic items. Those who

fail to do so are executed on the spot. Still, many desperate

souls find this preferable to reentering the tortured ruins.

Eltabbar (METROPOLIS)

Escalant (LARGE CITY)

The second-largest city in Thay, Eltabbar is the countrys cap-

ital. Getting around can be difficult for an stranger without

a guide, for maps of the city are forbidden to anyone who is

not a Red Wizard. This odd law is a holdover from the days

when Eltabbars streets formed a massive diagram imprison-

ing the demon lord Eltab. The River Eltar flows through the

city in an elaborate series of canals before meeting Lake Thay-

lambar, which the city overlooks. These canals were also part

of the magical prison that held Eltab beneath the city, but the

Abyssal creature escaped after an earthquake rocked the region

a few years back. There are rumors that a demon resides in

this prison once again, but no one knows whether the prisoner

is Eltab or some other evil monster.

The  ruler  of  Eltabbar  is  Tharchion  Dmitra  Flass  (LE

female human Ill7/Red8). Of all the tharchions and zulkirs,

she is by far the most diplomatic. Without her considerable

skills, the zulkirs might have fallen into open civil war long

ago. (Szass Tams intimidating style of rulership might work

well with most Thayans, but his fellow zulkirs arent so easily

impressed.) Eltabbar is also the capital of its home tharch, a

long stretch of land that wraps around the northern side of

Thaymount. Flass is often too busy with intrigues at home to

worry about the rest of the tharch, but she makes up for it

with relatively enlightened methods of governing.

Eltabbar is the center of the nations slave trade, as well as

its political center. Thousands of slaves are brought into the

markets here every year and auctioned off in the bloodstained

public blocks. Once dispatched to their new assignments, most

can  look  forward  to  at  best  a  few  months  of  backbreaking

labor followed by a quick death.

This coastal city, situated on the west bank of the mouth of

the  River  Lapendrar,  has  been  under  intermittent  Thayan

control for the past 338 years. The most recent break came

during  the  time  of  the  Great  Inner  Sea  Plague,  but  the

Thayans returned to the region in 1357 DR, and they have

ruled over Escalant continuously ever since.

Escalant was first settled around 400 DR. Today, the city

sprawls beyond the cramped limitations of the crumbling wall

long ago thrown up around the place. Over 28,000 souls call

this city home, making it second in importance only to Bezan-

tur  as  a  Thayan  port.  Tharchion  Hezass  Nymar  (NE  male

human Clr8 of Kossuth) allows life in Escalant to continue

without  much  interference  from  Thay,  other  than  the  col-

lection of taxes from the citizens. To that end, Nymar has sta-

tioned throughout the city several barracks of one hundred

gnolls  each.  These  Thayan  brutes  patrol  the  streets,  occa-

sionally  taking  the  time  to  make  an  example  out  of  some

criminal orworst of alltax cheat.

Nethentir (SMALL TOWN)

Nethentir is the sister city of Nethjet, which is situated on the

other side of Lake Umber. Like Nethjet, it was historically a

launching point for invasions against Thesk or the Aglaron-

dan city of Emmech. However, Nethentir has not enjoyed the

recent booming prosperity of Nethjet. While it has a port, no

roads  lead  into  the  town.  Still,  some  merchants  forge  their

own overland paths from Thesk and beyond. The captains of

Nethentir spend a great deal of their time ferrying goods back

and forth from Nethjet to their homeport, but thats about

as far as most of them go.

This has built up some resentment on the part of the citi-

zens of Nethentir. However, many of them are just as happy

not to have the increased attention of the Red Wizards that

comes along with such wealth.

Nethjet (LARGE TOWN)

This once-sleepy lake town used to be little more than the spot

where  the  Eastern  Way  dead-ended  at  Lake  Umber.  Grain

ships bound for Impiltur and other northerly lands took on

their  loads  here,  but  for  the  most  part,  Nethjet  saw  little

action except as the occasional launching point of yet another

invasion into Aglarond by way of the Umber Marshes. Today,

however, the tiny port here bustles with activity.

While most of Thays magic goods are exported through the

great  port  of  Bezantur  on  the  southern  coast,  the  growing

trade in magic has opened up new markets for the countrys

older commodities, including cotton, fruit, and grain. The new

Thay sends a great deal of traffic down the Umber, and Neth-

jet is the natural port for most ships that come and go from

the region. Goods that travel the Umber into the Sea of Dlurg

avoid  the  long  and  sometimes  treacherous  trip  around  the

western tip of the Aglarondan peninsula.

Tharchion Nymar maintains a small palace in the center of

the town, although he rarely travels to this sleepy corner of

his tharch. In the past, he mostly used it as a base of opera-

tions to oversee the buildup and deployment of Thayan forces

along the Aglarondan border. These days, hes more interested

in the proper collection of taxes from the travelers passing

through this now-booming port.

Heroes and

Monsters

Thay is home to misbegotten monstrosities and sinister villains.

The  Red  Wizards  have  bred  horrible  creatures  for  their  ne-

farious purposes over the centuries, and the dungeons and pits

of Thay are filled with their handiwork. In addition to mon-

sters, Thay is also home to characters with abilities and skills

found nowhere else in Faern. Many are unrepentant villains

who flourish in Thays evil society, but others leave their for-

bidding homeland to seek adventure elsewhere in Faern, and

a few take up the dangerous, almost hopeless, struggle to bring

about true and lasting change in their native land.

Humans are the most common race in Thay. Folk of other

races such as dwarves, elves, or halflings simply dont exist

except as slaves, and their lot is grim. Half-orcs, fire genasi,

and tieflings are not uncommon, and the Thayans are rea-

sonably open-minded about folk of such parentage, especially

if they have Mulan blood in their veins. Of the new charac-

ter  races  in  Chapter  1:  Races  of  the  East,  only  gnolls  are

found in Thay. In fact, they are quite common, accounting

for almost 10% of the population. Favored soldiers in many

Red Wizards personal armies, gnolls are the realms guards,

scouts, and enforcers. Most are cruel and greedy, but some de-

velop something of a sense of honor and become heroes in-

stead of villains.

Thayan  characters  most  often  become  clerics,  fighters,

monks, rogues, or wizards. Of course, many wizards aspire to

become  Red  Wizards  and  attain  power  and  status  in  their

homeland.  Clerics  of  Kossuth  sometimes  adopt  the  Black

Flame zealot prestige class, and fighters or fighter/rogues of

sinister disposition find the Thayan slaver prestige class at-

tractive.  (Both  of  these  classes  are  described  in  Chapter  2:

Prestige Classes.)

Thayan characters most often choose the Thay character

region, but gnolls may take the Gnoll region, and characters

from Thays western coasts may choose the Wizards Reach

region. Characters from Thay may choose from the expanded

list  of  feats  in  the  Chapter  3:  Regions  and  Feats,  often  se-

lecting Craft Contingent Spell, Explosive Spell, Fortify Spell,

Transdimensional Spell, and Improved Grapple. A number of

new  spells  and  magic  items  described  in  this  book  are  also

appropriate for Thayan characters.

New monsters presented in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East

that are common to Thay include the blooded one (also known

as the blood orc), dread warrior, juju zombie, and mur-zhagul

(demon troll).

170

Thesk  has  had  its  share  of  trouble  over  the  years.

Besides being a constant target of slave raids from

neighboring Thay, the Tuigan Horde nearly over-

ran the place a few years back. To top it all off, the city of Tel-

flammlargest  and  wealthiest  in  the  countryhas  fallen

under the rule of the Shadowmasters, a powerful thieves guild

associated with the worship of Mask.

Despite this, the people of Thesk are honest, hardworking

folk. As the gateway from Faern to Kara-Tur, a vast number

of caravans pass through its borders each year, some of which

are  initiated  by  its  own  shrewd  merchants.  Those  parts  of

Thesk  that  arent  based  around  the  Golden  Way  consist  of

broad, prosperous farmsteads and forests with an occasional

mining community.

Geographic

Overview

Thesk lies between the Great Dale to the north and Aglarond

and the Sea of Dlurg to the south. To the west is the Easting

Reach, while Thay and Rashemen are to the east. The coun-

try is nearly 300 miles from north to south and a little less

than  500  miles  across.  Like  the  Great  Dale  to  the  north,

Thesk climbs as one travels east; Two Stars is about 2,000 feet

above sea level.

Thesk is surrounded by water on two sides. The waters of the

Easting Reach batter the western shore, but they also carry

eager merchants to the two port cities of Telflamm and Nyth,

places ripe for the plucking (or so it seems to such ambitious

people). To the south, the Dragonjaw Mountains define much

of  the  lands  lower  edge.  These  steep  slopes  tumble  precipi-

tously into the waters of the Sea of Dlurg, across which the

northern shore of distant Aglarond is visible on a clear day.

The border with Thay is more ephemeral, defined by few ge-

ographical  landmarks.  To  most  Theskians,  their  land  ends

wherever the Thayan patrols begin. Over the past few years,

this border has been more stable: The tharchions of Lapendrar

and  Eltabbar  have  made  few  efforts  to  edge  farther  into

Thesk. The River Sur is well within Thayan territory, as is the

River  Umber.  The  Thesk  Mountains  and  the  vale  between

those peaks and the Dragonjaws to the south are Theskian, al-

though  settlements  grow  few  and  far  between  within  fifty

miles or so of Nethentir.

Lake Mulsantir and Lake Ashane form the rest of Thesks

eastern border. The Theskians have good relations with the

Rashemi,  and  both  parties  have  respected  this  border  for

decades. The southern edge of the Forest of Lethyr marks the

boundary between Thesk and the Great Dale. Few Theskians

live along the road from Tammar to Kront, conceding the

forests to the rangers and druids of the Circle of Leth; they

know  that  the  penalty  for  trespassing  there  is  often

death.  Theskian  woodsfolk  claim  only  the  portion  of  the

Lethyr that lies south of the River Flam, logging the south-

ern eaves of the forest.

The  Thesk  Mountains  (after  which  the  entire  country  is

named)  dominate  the  center  of  the  land,  a  range  of  low,

rugged, scrub-covered peaks stretching more than 100 miles

east from Phent. The mountains are inhospitable enough in

their western vales, but as one travels east, they grow higher,

more rugged, and more desolate. Snows persist on their north-

ern  faces  until  the  end  of  summer,  but  the  snow  is  usually

gone by the middle of Eleasis. The sere brown peaks are visi-

ble from just about every point in the country, and travelers

use them as landmarks.

A merchant on the Golden Way

Thesk is most famous for the Golden Way. This well-main-

tained road starts in Telflamm, crosses the River Flam, and

then passes through Phent, Phsant, Tammar, and Two Stars,

skirting the northern side of the Thesk Mountains before it

dead-ends at the River Mulsantir, between Lake Ashane and

Lake Mulsantir. From there, travelers and their cargo take

ferries across the water to Mulsantir, in Rashemen, and con-

tinue along the Golden Way through Rashemen and the End-

less Wastes all the way to distant Kara-Tur. The Golden Way

is a major overland trade artery. Its existence is the primary

reason that Thesk isnt simply part of the Great Dale or

worse yetanother tharch in Thay.

With the increase in trade in and out of Thay, merchants

have developed a number of paths to Nethentir from Phent,

Tammar, and Two Stars. They are well traveled these days, but

all of them are long treks plagued by brigands and hungry

monsters. The merchant princes of Thesk have no interest in

building expensive new roads that would only make it easy for

Thay  to  roll  its  siege  engines  from  Eltabbar  to  Telflamm.

Thesk may be a land of merchants rather than warriors, but

its  people  know  enough  not  to  build  a  convenient  invasion

route for a power that has been their enemy in the past and

will likely be their enemy again someday.

Major Geographic

Features

For the most part, Thesk is a rural, lightly settled nation. Its

main sources of revenue are farming and providing services

to travelers along the Golden Way. Like the Great Dale to the

north, Thesk is also a place of untouched natural beauty. Vast

stretches of land are empty of people. Even most of the farm-

ers in Thesk live along the Golden Way, making it easier to

transport their harvests to market.

Few people live along the path between Phent and Nethen-

tir, although this is one of the most breathtaking stretches of

land in this part of Faern, running as it does between two

mountain ranges separated by only twenty miles. Even in high

summer,  travelers  can  see  snow  high  on  the  white-capped

peaks to both the left and right.

Ashanath

Ashanath consists of the high, windswept plains leading up to

the  eastern  border  of  Thesk,  Lake  Ashane.  This  region  is

almost entirely empty of habitation, even though it has the

potential to be the most fertile land in all the Unapproach-

able East. Monstrous windstorms and cyclones (born of the

Red Wizards manipulation of the weather to moderate the cli-

mate of the Plateau of Thay) roar through the region in all

seasons  of  the  year,  preventing  all  but  the  most  foolhardy

from putting down stakes here.

Two towns frame the Ashanath, one to the north and an-

other to the south. In the north, Kront stands where the Great

Road meets the Cold Road. The people here make their living

by serving the needs of travelers who pass through. Destruc-

tive storms hammer the town at least once or twice a year, but

every building features a cellar into which the places inhab-

itants escape when an incoming tornado is spotted.

Life  is  much  the  same  in  Two  Stars  to  the  south.  Built

where the Golden Way meets the Cold Road, Two Stars is lit-

erally the crossroads of commerce in the East. The crossing

to Rashemen lies only twenty miles east of the town, and in

spring, when the River Mulsantirs ice has not yet broken but

has grown too dangerous to attempt, eastbound caravans fill

the inns and hostels of the town to bursting.

For more information about the Ashanath, see the descrip-

tion of this area in Chapter 10: Rashemen.

Dragonjaw Mountains

The  Dragonjaw  Mountains  form  Thesks  southwestern

border. This range of tall, majestic peaks rises quickly from

the  northern  foothills  and  then  tumbles  down  even  faster

into the Sea of Dlurg to the south. The Dragonjaws stretch

from the Umber Marshes west into the Sea of Fallen Stars,

although the broad Tannath Gap divides the range near the

center.  The  tip  of  the  western  peninsula  is  known  as  Cape

Dragonfang, and it is a useful navigational point for sailors

on the Inner Sea. Creatures of all sorts call the Dragonjaw

Mountains home, but only one settlement of any serious size

exists there: the city of Milvarune. On the northern shore of

the Sea of Dlurg, right at the bottom of a steep and narrow

pass that cuts through one of the thinnest parts of the range,

Milvarune is bounded by mountains on three sides and by the

sea on the fourth.

Dozens  of  rock  gnome  clans  live  in  high,  hidden  vales

throughout the range. The Dragonjaws are unusually rugged,

even as mountains go, so the gnomes have mastered the art

of cultivating narrow terraces that cling to the steep slopes.

They are also miners of great skill, and they trade precious

metals and gems through Milvarune to the south or Phent to

the north in exchange for goods they cant fashion for them-

selves, as well as foodstuffs that do not flourish in their moun-

tain homes. A few of the gnome mines scrape copper, iron, and

other metals from the ground, but the most successful ones

chip up diamonds, rubies, and emeralds from the Underdark.

The  gnomes  of  the  Dragonjaws  are  reclusive  and  avoid

humans (or other big folk) they dont know. They usually hide

when strangers come along, coming out only once they have

established that the intruders mean no harm. The gnomes dis-

trust humans wearing any kind of red clothing. If the human

has a shaved head as well, they remain in their hiding holes

until he goes away. If he is bald and tattooed, they are likely

to  ambush  him  the  first  chance  they  get.  The  Dragonjaw

gnomes have no use for Red Wizards.

THE DRAGONS TOOTH

A hundred miles out to sea, sailors can spot the purplish peak

of  the  Dragons  Tooth,  the  westernmost  mountain  of  Cape

Dragonfang. The mountain is home to an ever-growing family

of copper dragons who occasionally descend from the moun-

taintops to rescue hapless ships from being plundered by pi-

rates. The dragons vigilance is another reasonbesides the

Simbuls famous edict declaring piracy in the waters of Agla-

rond to be punishable by immediate deaththat corsairs avoid

the Sea of Dlurg.

The  patriarch  of  the  dragon  clan  is  named  Filauxerimos

(CG male wyrm copper dragon Brd8) who is said to have called

celestial allies to build a great draconic castle near the peak

of Dragons Tooth. His clan includes two mature adults, a ju-

venile,  two  young,  and  two  very  young  copper  dragons,  al-

though the other adults (his daughters) live in mountaintop

lairs elsewhere in the range. These dragons have taken it upon

themselves  to  protect  the  region  around  their  home.  They

dont care who rules Thesk, as long as the Dragonjaw Moun-

tains are left alone; more than one arrogant Red Wizard has

crawled home maimed by horrible acid burns. Filauxerimos

and his kin stay away from the southern half of the range, in

particular Mount Umbergoth, where Nartheling, the ancient

fang dragon, has his lair.

The copper dragons all take part in an annual festival in

Milvarune every spring. The central event of Dragon Day,

as  this  festival  is  known,  is  a  riddle  contest  between  the

gnomes and dragons. The dragons normally win handily, but

the  occasional  gnome  victory  always  keeps  the  hope  of  the

little people alive.

THE OLD SWORDS

At the eastern end of the northern range, overlooking the

Tannath Gap, stands the distinctive peak known as the Old

Swords. Near its acme, the mountain splits into two great

rocky piers that jut a thousand feet into the sky, creating

a landmark known by all who pass this way. In the cleft be-

tween  the  two  pillars  a  tribe  of  evil  dragonkin  has  made

their home, venturing out to raid the Nethentir track and

harry farmsteads in the valley below when the mood takes

them. The leader of the tribe is a hulking monster called

Daggerclaw (NE male dragonkin Ftr3/Clr7 of Tiamat), who

delights in capturing humans for sacrifice to his dark dra-

conic deity.

Filauxerimos  and  his  clan  havent  been  sufficiently  pro-

voked to destroy the raiders stronghold, but they attack and

kill  any  dragonkin  they  come  across.  The  dragonkin  have

learned to hide at the first sign of a copper dragon. Dagger-

claw is plotting to secretly gather all his warriors and ambush

one of Filauxerimoss younger and weaker kin, dreaming of a

174

THESK

truly worthy sacrifice to Tiamat. Such an act would, of course,

bring down upon the dragonkin tribe the full wrath of the

copper wyrm and all his followers.

Thesk Mountains

Bare and inhospitable, the Thesk Mountains loom brown and

sullen  over  the  western  stretch  of  the  Golden  Way.  Little

grows here, and the land is dry and infertile. The mountains

are not terribly highthe tallest peak is only about 7,000 feet

tallbut they are unusually steep and difficult, with few gaps

penetrating the maze of ridges and canyons. The last patches

of winter snow melt by late summer, but for most of the rest

of the year, the higher elevations are blanketed in white.

The biggest danger in the Thesk Mountains is a landslide.

Incautious adventurers who make their way into unexplored

portions of the mountains run the risk of bringing literally

tons of loose rocks and earth down on their heads. Trails that

have been safely used for generations can suddenly drop off

into space, victims of the latest rainfall or rockslide. This is

no place for an unwary traveler.

The Thesk Mountains are infested with all sorts of crea-

tures, but the most common these days are orcs. The Zhents

left these former warriors behind when they, along with the

other armies of the West, faced down the Tuigan Horde many

years ago. Today, many orcs work small iron mines scattered

throughout the mountains, coming down to the city of Phsant

to blow off steam whenever they scrape together enough ore

and the time to enjoy the profits from their labor.

HILL TOWN

This is a small community of about forty hill giants based in

the northeastern foothills of the Thesk Mountains. They live

here with an assortment of dire wolves, ogres, and orcs, an un-

stable arrangement that frequently devolves into brawls over

who is in charge of the place.

These creatures do some hunting and gathering, but their fa-

vorite means of feeding themselves is raiding the Golden Way.

Theyre careful not to take advantage of travelers on this road

too  often,  though,  as  theyve  been  punished  by  the  Shadow-

masters of Telflamm before for such indiscretions. These days,

the marauders more commonly harass people on the path from

Phent to Nethentir. The giants never raid a caravan escorted

by a Red Wizard or one bearing the mark of the Shadowmas-

ters. They are prepared to deal with just so much trouble.

MOUNT NIRG

The tallest of the Theskian peaks, Mount Nirg is a rampart

of barren rock and loose, gravelly slopes that winds almost ten

miles  through  the  eastern  reaches  of  the  range.  Its  lower

reaches are littered with hundreds of ancient tombs and the

remnants of old stone roads built by some folk lost to history,

and the mountain itself has an even worse reputation than the

rest of this bleak range.

In a high, rocky tor near the summit lurks a drow outpost

of the city of Phaundakulzan, which lies deep in the Under-

dark  about  halfway  between  the  Thesk  Mountains  and  the

Thaymount. The outpost is nearly impossible to reach with-

out flying, but the drow use a series of seemingly endless stair-

cases that spiral upward through the mountain. The occupants

of the outpost monitor the movements of the Red Wizards up

and down the path between Nethentir and Phent. The drow

can scarcely believe the zulkirs have given up their warlike

ways and keep a close eye on them at all times. Just why the

drow care about Thayan movements is unclear, but one theory

favored by those in Telflamm who know of the outpost is that

they are waiting for Thay to launch an all-out attack against

someone. When they do, the drow plan to sweep in and take

the Plateau of Thayor at least Thaymountfor themselves.

People of Thesk

Although Thesk is populated mostly by humans (a substantial

majority), it is still the most racially diverse nation in the Un-

approachable East. Gold is the great equalizer here. No matter

who a person is or what she may have done, her fortune speaks

louder  than  all  else.  The  people  of  Thesk  respect  those  of

wealth,  especially  those  lucky  or  talented  souls  who  earned

their wealth with their own hard work and ingenuity.

Races and Cultures

Thesk is the melting pot of the East. Races who would be at

war against one another in other parts of the world work side

by side here. The influence of gold is certainly one factor, but

many new peoples have also come to Thesk over the past sev-

eral years. Given the situation at the timethe war with the

Tuigan  Horde  and  the  ever-present  threat  of  Thaythe

Theskians  were  happy  for  the  help,  and  their  gratitude  has

waned little over time.

DAMARANS

Most of the humans of Thesk are descended from the Dama-

rans who settled this land 400 to 500 years ago. These folk

came from the cities of Impiltur to the north, and for some

time the lords of Telflamm owed fealty to the rulers of that

land,  but  Thesk  has  been  independent  of  Impiltur  for  well

over 200 years. In Thesk, folk of Damaran blood have long

mingled with Rashemi and a handful of Nars and Mulan who

have come to this land, so Theskians show signs of both Dama-

ran and Rashemi blood.

SHOU

These people hail from the expansive Shou Empire in the dis-

tant lands of Kara-Tur, far beyond the Endless Wastes to the

east. Many of the Shou currently living in Thesk were either

slaves of the Tuigan Horde or refugees scurrying just ahead

of its advance who slipped into Thesk mere days or tendays

before their relentless pursuers. Others came with the long

caravans  of  merchant  wagons  that  have  been  crossing  the

Endless  Wastes  between  Kara-Tur  and  the  Unapproachable

East for centuries.

No matter how they got here, the Shou have become a fact

of  life  in  Thesk.  These  foreign  people  with  their  strange

tongues and exotic ways usually congregate in districts of their

own, called Shou-towns, in just about every major city along

the Golden Way and beyond. They are slowly starting to have

an influence upon the societies of Faern as they become more

and more common in the region, and nowhere is this more ob-

vious than in the cities of Thesk.

TUIGANS

When the Tuigan Horde was defeated, not all the Tuigans re-

turned home. Some doffed their armor and threw down their

swords, trading in a soldiers life for a peaceful existence in

Thesk. Most of these folk have little to no education, but they

are sharp. Many of them were pressed into the service of the

Horde and felt no great loss when it disappeared.

Others refused to give up the violent ways that had gotten

them to the doorstep of Faern. Many of these raiders knew no

other trade than war, and they were determined to make it pay.

The bandits who held Tammar for so long, for instance, were

mostly remnants of the Tuigan Horde. Such brigands continue

to plague Thesk to this day, although in dwindling numbers. Few

have enough determination to stand against the resolve of the

Merchants Council to keep the roads clear, and most such high-

way robbers have been summarily executed for their trouble.

ORCS AND HALF-ORCS

The  Zhents  came  to  the  aid  of  Thesk  against  the  Tuigan

Horde  a  dozen  years  ago.  After  helping  to  win  the  battle

against the Horde, the Zhents opted to leave their orc units

stationed in Thesk. Over the intervening years, hundreds of

other orcs and half-orcs have come to join their fellows in one

of the few human nations that has shown the capacity to tol-

erate their kind.

176

THESK

The oligarchs worry that the orc soldiers are still loyal to

Zhentil Keep. If this is true, the Zhents could conceivably ac-

tivate these troops at any time and destroy Thesk from within.

For this reason, many of the orcs who came to Telflamm have

been  relocated,  but  most  have  been  treated  well  enough  in

Thesk  to  reconsider  their  loyalties,  should  the  call  to  arms

come once again.

Life and Society

Thesk is all about business, at least from the point of view of

most humans who live and work here. There are a few mines

in the mountains and a number of farms along the Golden

Way, but these collectively come in a distant second behind

commerce, shipping, and catering to the caravans along the

main trade routes.

Wealth  is  the  means  to  power,  station,  and  comfort  in

Thesk.  Most  often,  this  wealth  lies  in  the  hands  of  the  so-

called merchant lords, or oligarchs, who control the great mer-

chant houses and the endless streams of caravans bound for

the  lands  beyond  the  Endless  Wastes.  However,  prosperous

landowners and retired adventurers fit into this hierarchy as

well. The merchants of Thesk do not look down on the farm-

ers,  craftsfolk,  and  laborers  who  populate  their  country.  A

merchant who has gained wealth and influence sees govern-

ing as a responsibility imposed by success and rarely seeks to

do anything more than discharge his duties in the quickest and

most efficient manner possible.

Theskians tend to be a warm people, always ready with a

kind wordand an open palm. They accept payment for serv-

ices  rendered  in  any  form.  To  them,  its  not  who  you  are

thats important so much as what youre worth. To call all

Theskians schemers is a bit harsh, but most of them are always

on  the  prowl  for  the  next  big  deal.  Others  may  see  their

commercialism  as  crass,  but  Theskians  are  some  of  the

most open-minded folk in Faern. They didnt condemn the

orcs  the  Zhentarim  left  behind.  Instead,  they  saw  them  as

valuable resources.

work as clerks, guards, laborers, and provisioners in the great

merchant houses. Those who are not involved in the eastern

trade  make  their  living  much  as  do  people  of  other  lands.

Thesk  exports  beef,  leather,  grain,  and  some  timber  to  the

nearby nations of the East, although many farmers and ranch-

ers simply provision the caravans instead of selling their pro-

duce abroad.

Thesk took a hit in the coin purse when the Tuigan Horde

invaded. The disruption cost not only many lives but a great

deal of gold, as two entire seasons of caravans were lost. Clear-

ing the Golden Way became a top priority for the Merchants

Council and even the Shadowmasters, both of whom rely on

the prosperity of Telflamm to fuel their own rise to power.

LAW AND ORDER

Aglarondans mutter that justice is for sale in Thesk, but this

is not entirely true. Crime and disorder are bad for business,

so the oligarchs make a point of keeping order in their cities

and towns. The common folk are protected by a code of laws,

enforced by city watches hired by the merchants councils to

protect people and property from the depredations of the law-

less. However, there is little regulation of business practices,

so unscrupulous merchants think nothing of bribing the clerks

of their competitors to pass them information, charging usu-

rious rates when lending money, or even paying marauders in

the Endless Wastes to attack their rivals caravans.

Most crimes are punishable by stiff fines as opposed to im-

prisonment or execution. A merchant lord can usually afford

to buy her way out of any trouble short of murder, and some-

times even that can be atoned for with a sufficiently large

payment to the citys ruling merchants. Common Theskians

do not often have recourse to this sort of bribery, so its not

unfair to say that the laws of the land are more onerous to the

poor than the wealthy. Thesk has a tradition of vigilante jus-

tice, though, and poor folk may take the law into their own

hands when they perceive their wealthy neighbors have gotten

away with something.

ECONOMY

DEFENSE AND WARCRAFT

As the gateway between Kara-Tur and Faern, Thesks for-

tuitous geographical location has transformed its people into

one of the wealthiest nations in the East. Dozens of large trad-

ing  costers  and  hundreds  of  minor  entrepreneurs  organize

huge caravan trains to carry the goods of Faern to the dis-

tant eastern lands. These magnates invest thousands of gold

pieces in cargoes that sell at a premium in Kara-Tur, then use

the revenues to buy silk, spices, and other exotic goods to bring

back to Thesk and sell to other merchants of the Inner Sea for

a princes ransom. An investment of 100 gp in western goods

sent to Kara-Tur can return 500 gp in silk and spice, although

the journey to Kara-Tur and back takes a full year and can be

quite dangerous.

Not all Theskians are capable of sponsoring their own car-

avans to the far east, but many, especially in the larger cities,

The  Theskians  are  not  a  warlike  people.  They  have  never

mounted an invasion of another country and have no desire

to do so. Theyd rather trade with their neighbors, and its hard

to do that in the middle of a fight. War is bad business for

everyone but the gravediggers, is an old Theskian maxim, oft

repeated  in  troubled  times.  Still,  the  Theskians  know  their

wealth makes them a target for those who conduct business

transactions at the point of a sword. They invest considerable

resources in securing themselves and their belongings against

aggressors. Most merchants, not content to leave the safety

of themselves, their families, and their belongings to anyone

else, hire on large numbers of competent and loyal guards.

Thesk has no national army. Instead, the larger cities of Mil-

varune, Nyth, Phsant, and Telflamm each field relatively small

forces of professional soldiers augmented by well-ordered and

177

THESK

disciplined mercenary companies. These mercenaries abide by

a long-standing, relatively strict set of standards that prevent

dishonorable actions, such as changing sides in the middle of

a conflict or refusing to fight unless their employers come up

with more money. The mercenary companies also have a tra-

dition of negotiating with one another before a battle to see

if  a  show  of  force  will  suffice.  Numerous  conflicts  between

Thesks cities have turned into little more than martial parades:

The captains of both sides determine who would have won in

open battle and report the results to their employers.

For the most part, the cities of Thesk stand together in a de-

fensive league. A Thayan attack against Tammar, for example,

would bring the armies of Telflamm, Phsant, and Two Stars

to their neighbors defense. Theskians may not have much of

a martial tradition, but they can hire a lot of help (including

sorcerers, wizards, and intelligent monsters) to fight a major

war. When the professional forces are insufficient to meet the

threat, Theskian towns muster numbers of well-armed militia.

Thesk is a plutocracy, not a democracy, but its folk are will-

ing to fight for the freedom and opportunities they do possess.

The  typical  Theskian  soldier  is  an  experienced  mercenary,

mounted and equipped with the best arms and armor he can

afford. Thesks defenses have been strengthened of late by the

addition of thousands of orc warriors, many of whom serve in

the armies and mercenary companies of the cities. The orcs may

be less reliable than human soldiers, but they live for battle.

RELIGION

Its said that the people of Thesk worship only coins, but this

is patently not true. In fact, most Theskians are extremely

generous with their contributions to the gods, tending to favor

several deities over one. Merchants like to cover all the bases,

ensuring  that  most  of  the  deities  they  recognize  are  happy

with them. Waukeen, Tymora, and Shaundakul are all popu-

lar in Thesk, as these deities oversee commerce, fortune, and

travel, respectively.

Few  Theskians  openly  worship  evil  gods,  although  those

willing to use any means to get ahead find Cyrics church com-

pelling. The one great exception to this is Mask. Just about

everyone in Thesk ends up contributing to the priests of Mask

by  allowing  the  Shadowmasters  a  cut  of  their  earnings,

whether they realize it or not. Those who choose not to con-

tribute voluntarily are quite often required to pay later.

Adventurers

Adventurers are welcome in Thesk. There are plenty of dan-

gerous jobs to be hadfrom poking around in ancient ruins

to escorting caravans across the countryand never enough

brave souls ready to undertake them at a reasonable price. The

Theskians recall the role of adventurers in terminating the

drive  of  the  Tuigan  Horde,  and  they  respect  the  power  of

high-level adventurers. They try to get into the good graces

of such people, hoping this investment of time and friendship

will pay off in the future.

Thesk itself has only a few locations appropriate for a tra-

ditional dungeon delve, but it makes a great base of operations

for  an  ambitious  party  willing  to  hire  out  its  services  to  a

wealthy benefactor.

Politics and Power

Thesk is more accurately described as a league of allied cities

than as a single, unified realm. Founded more than 400 years

ago by Impilturan merchants, the land retains its commercial

character to this day. The realm is a true oligarchy: Councils

of merchants govern each of its towns and cities, and the coun-

try as a whole is governed by the Council of Thesk, composed

of the speakers, lords, or chairpersons of each of the civic coun-

cils. Appointment to a citys merchant council requires wealth,

station, and success. However, the folk of Thesk place little

stock in old bloodlines or musty titlesanyone with ambition,

drive, and a little luck can aspire to the ruling elite.

Thesks  cities  are  associated  only  loosely,  and  no  central

government binds them under a common law or authority.

Each is free to do as it sees fit and is expected to look after

its  own  defense,  law,  and  prosperity.  The  oligarchs  of  one

town usually extradite wanted criminals to their neighbors,

but not always, especially if the person in question is a pillar

of their own community. From time to time, mercantile ri-

valries between cities break out into open fighting, but the

folk of Thesk have no stomach for long and ruinous wars.

Mercenaries contest the issue until one side or the other holds

a clear advantage, and then the losing side knuckles under and

makes peace.

History of Thesk

Once an empty land settled by colonists from old Impiltur,

Thesk remains thinly populated in many spots. Although the

cities of Thesk have been independent of Impiltur for more

than two centuries, they have yet to forge a true nation under

one government.

Government

Representatives  from  the

merchant councils of each of

the  lands  towns  and  cities

gather  once  a  year  (or  as

events  demand)  to  discuss

issues of mutual import. How

a  city  chooses  its  leaders  or

manages  its  affairs  is  of  no

interest  to  its  neighbors.

Councils of oligarchs (wealthy

merchants  or  landowners)

govern most towns in Thesk,

and  the  head  of  the  council

represents that town to the as-

sembled oligarchs of the rest

of the country. Milvarune is

represented by its prince, as

is  Telflamm,  but  these

nobles wield no more power

than the leading merchants of

Phsant or Nyth.

The  assembled  leaders  are

known as the Council of Thesk. The Council oversees no

administration, commands no army, and has no responsibil-

ities or authority other than the voluntary contributions

of its member cities. Thesk does not even have a capital city

for  the  Council  to  meet  in,  although  Phsant  is  most  often

chosen for its central location. Telflamm was the de facto cap-

ital  for  many  years,  losing  its  prestigious  place  only  as  the

other settlements of the Golden Way grew from small towns

to bustling cities.

Within  each  town  or  city,  a  merchants  council  oversees

most civic functions. Ascension to the council is usually based

on demonstrated success in business and personal wealth. The

merchants councils keep an eye on any potential members,

inviting someone to join when she has reached an appropriate

level of achievement. The standards vary from town to town,

although the minimum is ownership or control of property

and enterprises worth 10,000 (in a small town) to 100,000 gp

(in a large city such as Telflamm).

THESK

Today,  the  Shadowmasters  control  or  influence  the  mer-

chants  councils  of  almost  all  Thesks  towns  and  cities.

Through bribery, corruption, or intimidation, the thieves of

Telflamm have brought many of the ruling merchants around

to  their  point  of  view.  The  Shadowmasters  oppose  steps  to

unite  Thesk,  establish  central  authority,  or  introduce  ac-

countability over the merchants councils, but other than that,

they leave the oligarchs to run the country as they like.

would march to reopen the Golden Waywould be a much

more difficult task.

These days, Thay is on relatively friendly terms with Thesk.

One of the first of the Red Wizards trade enclaves was opened

in Telflamm, and the relationship has been strong ever since.

Average Theskians dont trust the Red Wizards, as their long

history of aggression is too much to ignore, but in the mean-

time they are happy to take the Thayans money.

Enemies

With the vast amount of wealth flowing through Thesk, its

inevitable that the country would draw the envy of all sorts

of foes. The most notable of these are described here.

THE SHADOWMASTERS

The rest of the world is likely not aware that the power-

ful thieves guild known as the Shadowmasters runs Tel-

flamm, but its an open secret among the residents of that

city. What is interesting is that most people really dont

seem to mind. The machine of corruption the thieves have

set up actually does a better-than-average job of keeping

the city running.

The Shadowmasters realize they need the acquiescence of

the people to maintain their position. They are careful not to

skim too much off the various operations they set up, for if

they make the costs too onerous, theyre sure to end up with

a revolt on their hands. Its a lot better for profit margins to

extort money from people who dont find it worthwhile to

fight back.

Of course, the forces of good in the city see this reasoning

as a slippery slope of complicity and corruption. They are qui-

etly taking the good fight to the Shadowmasters, hoping to

free  the  city  from  the  thieves  unwholesome  grip.  Prince

Balindre is secretly backing these opponents, at great risk to

both  himself  and  his  family,  because  he  resents  having  to

dance to the Shadowmasters tune. He wants his familys city

restored to what he calls its former greatness, and hes will-

ing to do whatever he can to help that alongprovided he

doesnt get caught.

THE RED WIZARDS OF THAY

Over the centuries, the most consistent threat to Thesk has

come from Thay. The Red Wizards have always coveted the

nations easy access to the rest of Faern and even Kara-Tur.

For that reason, Thay attempted several invasions over the

years  and  managed  to  capture  Nethjet  and  Nethentir.  The

Thayans have not had much success in extending their con-

trol farther north or west, mostly because the wild and empty

land between the Thesk Mountains and the Surmarsh is not

worth fighting over. The Red Wizards could seize Tammar

or Two Stars easily enough, but holding their conquest against

the  armies  of  Phsant,  Telflamm,  and  Nythall  of  whom

Cities and Sites

Large stretches of Thesk are empty plains, rugged mountains,

or impassable forests. Most of the lands settlements lie along

the  major  trade  routes  running  from  the  Easting  Reach

toward Rashemen and Thay. The cities of Thesk concentrate

not on industry but instead exist for trade or providing serv-

ices to those involved in trade. These cities bustle with activ-

ity. The competition for money is fierce, and while most of

the people are honest folk, theyre willing to push the limits

to get a leg up on their fellows.

Most cities in Thesk are not walled. Buildings are made of

wood, often stacked high upon one another, as everyone wants

to be as close as possible to centers of commerce. This should

make them dirty, crowded places, but the merchant councils

pay to keep the streets clean. Its a small price to encourage

more business to come their way.

Fort Thesk

The Thesk Mountains have been contested by Thesk and Thay

several  times  over  the  years.  Although  the  Thayans  have

never overrun the mountains in their entirety or held their

gains for long, they have managed to set up several fortifi-

cations and outposts in the eastern hills, extending their con-

trol deep into the Theskian borderlands.

Fort Thesk is one such fortification, established many years

ago  on  the  far  eastern  edge  of  the  range.  It  was  originally

meant  to  be  a  watchtower,  keeping  a  cold  eye  out  for  any

Theskian attempt to retake the land the Thayans had wrested

from them. But when the merchants of Phsant finally hired

mercenaries to push back the Red Wizards, Fort Thesk was

cold and silent. No one has been able to determine what hap-

pened,  but  expeditions  to  the  stone-walled  fort  found  no

Thayans and no sign of a struggle. Plates were left with half-

eaten meals, mugs of ale remained half-drained, and a patina

of dust lay over everything in the place.

There are many theories about what caused the people of

Fort Thesk to suddenly disappear. Perhaps an experiment

of the Red Wizards working there went awry. Maybe mon-

sters from the Underdark invaded the place, but the lack

of  any  sign  of  a  struggle  argues  against  that.  Sometimes

travelers report seeing a great flame blazing at the top of

the forts observation tower, but no one has been able to

discover the cause.

THESK

Milvarune (SMALL CITY)

Located on the southern coast of Thesk, overlooking the

Sea of Dlurg and Aglarond beyond, Milvarune is a hard place

to get to on foot. Sheer mountains cut off its landward

approaches except for a couple of tortuous paths not even

suitable  for  an  oxcart.  Most  visitors  to  this  city  come  by

way  of  the  sea.  Boats  regularly  make  the  run  across  from

Furthinghome  in  Aglarond  or  from  Telflamm  around

Cape Dragonfang.

Milvarune is an independent principality, only loosely af-

filiated  with  Thesk.  For  hundreds  of  years,  the  Mindosel

family has ruled it. The reigning lord is Prince Auvur Min-

dosel (LG male human Ari9), a young and flamboyant man

whose  ambitions  seem  too  large  for  his  tiny  realm.  Prince

Auvur believes he has the best claim to Aglaronds throne, be-

cause his great-great-grandfather Elthas married one of the

Gray Sisters who ruled that kingdom more than a hundred

years ago, and the royal line of that country has since died out.

The Sons of Hoar have secretly approached Auvur about as-

serting his claim, but the prince of Milvarune proceeds with

unusual caution in this matter.

Milvarune  is  the  most  cosmopolitan  city  in  Thesk.  The

human population includes Theskians (mostly of Damaran de-

scent), Aglarondans, Impilturans, Shou, and even a handful of

Tuigans.  Besides  the  humans,  Milvarune  is  also  home  to  a

large population of gnomes from the mountains, as well as

half-elves from Aglarond. The folk of the various races get

along fairly well, although there is some tension between the

Shou and their old enemies, the Tuigans.

Nyth (SMALL CITY)

Lying  on  the  northern  section  of  Thesks  western  coast,

Nyth is the weaker sister city of Telflamm. Isolated as it is

from  the  rest  of  Thesk  by  the  Forest  of  Lethyr  and  the

River  Flam,  Nyth  never  became  the  major  port  of  com-

merce into which Telflamm has matured. For much of its

existence,  Nyth  has  been  under  the  direct  control  of  the

prince  of  Telflamm.  These  days,  with  the  princes  power

weakened,  Nyth  stands  alone  againat  least  in  name.  In

truth, the same Shadowmasters who secretly run Telflamm

rule in Nyth as well.

Nyth was named after the strange creatures by the same

name  that  once  haunted  the  western  edge  of  the  Forest  of

Lethyr, which was once much closer to the city than it is now.

Long ago, the prince of Telflamm sent a cabal of wizards to

eliminate  the  nyths  and  protect  the  town.  The  wizards  ac-

complished their goal in a spectacular battle, but most of them

were killed in the action.

To this day, arcane spellcasters are well respected in Nyth

as  long  as  theyre  not  wearing  the  telltale  robes  of  a  Red

Wizard. No matter how unrelated an arcane spellcaster may

be to the members of that doomed mission so long ago, most

Nythans believe all such spellcasters are fated to meet a sim-

ilar end, likely when the nyths return from the depths of the

forest to exact their revenge. Fortunately, there is no indica-

tion that this belief is anything more than a superstition.

Phent (LARGE TOWN)

Built at the spot where the route from Telflamm to Nethen-

tir breaks off from the Golden Way, Phent is the crossroads

for most traffic to and from Thay. Before the normalizing of

relations with Thay, Phent was just a way station between Tel-

flamm and Phsant, but today, Thayan trade draws many for-

eign merchants to the town.

Several hundred of the orcs abandoned in Thesk by Zhen-

til Keep live in Phent. Many more live in the foothills and

canyons of the nearby Thesk Mountains, eking a living out

of small iron mines high among the peaks. The orc popula-

tion  swells  toward  the  end  of  the  tenday,  when  the  miners

make their way into town to sell off their ores and stock up

181

on  supplies.  Orc  miners  take  over  Phents  taverns  and  ale-

houses for a day or two, and inevitably, property gets damaged

and people get hurt, but Phents townsfolk have learned when

to push back and when to stay out of the way.

Phent can be rowdy when the miners are in town. Sergeant

Kraansh (N male orc Ftr9), the leader of a well-armed and nu-

merous town watch, keeps a tight rein on things. Since he was

a commander in the Zhent army most of the orcs belonged to

years ago, they quickly come to heel when he barks at them.

The towns graveyard is filled with

orc toughs who thought to make

a name for themselves by killing

their old sergeant.

THESK

Phsant (LARGE CITY)

Phsant is where the armies of the western alliance put a stop

to the Tuigan Horde thirteen years ago. A large, thriving mer-

chant city, Phsant is the most popular rest stop between Tel-

flamm and Mulsantir. It lies in the center of one of the most

densely settled portions of Thesk and is second only to Tel-

flamm  in  power  and  influence.  The  merchant  princes  of

Phsant do not dance on the strings of the Shadowmasters

at least, not all of themand if

any place might be said to rep-

resent Thesks capital, Phsant is it.

Like  Phent  to  the  west,

Phsant  is  home  to  many  orcs

from  the  Zhent  legion  aban-

doned  here.  Although  the

native  Theskians  were  not

pleased by this development, the

fact  that  the  orc  soldiers  had

fought hard and valiantly against

the Tuigan Horde mitigated the

humans natural suspicion of the

Zhent  warriors.  For  their  part,

the orcs have learned to restrain

their  more  violent  nature  and

fit in as best they can. Few other

places  in  Faern  are  as  wel-

coming of their kind as Thesk,

and the orcs know that.

Phsant  is  also  home  to  the

largest Shou-town in Faern, a

crowded  district  home  to

almost 5,000 of these east-

erners  displaced  from

small  villages  and  settle-

ments by the Tuigans fif-

teen years ago. The Shous

honesty  and  industrious-

ness  have  earned  them  a

welcome  in  Phsant.  Several

Shou merchants have risen to the

ranks of Phsants council, and many others

run prosperous businesses alongside those of

the native Theskians. The Tuigans are long gone, but the Shou

have no intention of returning to their homeland.

Phsant is also the base of the Shou secret society known as

the Nine Golden Swords. Amid the honest folk who came to

Thesk looking for a better life lurked vicious yakuza, and these

murderous thugs have quickly returned to their accustomed

ways, intimidating and extorting the poor people of the city.

So far, the Nine Golden Swords have limited their activities

to the Shou districts, but the Golden Master (leader of the so-

ciety) is gathering strength to extend his power throughout

the whole city, whether the Shadowmasters like it or not.

Tammar (LARGE TOWN)

This town is located where the road from Kront crosses the

Golden Way before continuing on to Nethentir. Since the Cold

Road is actually a better and more direct route from Kront

to Nethentir, most of the traffic that comes this way from the

north is on its way to Telflamm.

During the Tuigan invasion, Tammar was nearly razed to

the ground. Only a few of the stouter buildings, those made

of stone, were left standing. For a while thereafter, a massive

gang of bandits set up camp here, extorting exorbitant tolls

from  the  merchants  passing  through.  They  made  a  good

enough living at it that every cutthroat for 200 miles around

flocked to the place to claim a share of the booty. The mer-

chants council of Phsant could permit this to continue for

only  so  long.  When  the  bandit  company  struck  directly  at

their livelihood, they leaders of Phsant took quick action to

root it out. They hired the best Zhent orc soldiers they could

find and sent them off to deal with the matter. The orcs hand-

ily defeated the bandits, most of whom fled at the first sight

of the creatures. When the original residents returned, they

hailed the orcs as heroes. Together they rebuilt the town, and

the orcs agreed to stay on permanently.

Telflamm (LARGE CITY)

To many people outside the country, Telflamm is Thesk. The

foreign merchants whose ships call in the citys harbor have

no reason or desire to proceed farther inland. To them, Tel-

flamm represents the westernmost tip of Kara-Tur, the mys-

terious  lands  of  the  east.  Like  Milvarune  to  the  south,

Telflamm  is  an  independent  principality  and  not  officially

part of Thesk, which is run by an oligarchy of the leading mer-

chants and lords of the lands various communities. In truth,

Telflamms influence over the land is so great that the oli-

garchs might as well declare the city to be their capital.

SHOU TOWN

A  large  Shou  community  has  developed  in  Thesk  over  the

years, mostly merchants who traveled the Golden Way from

Kara-Tur. Some of these people liked what they saw in Tel-

flamm so much that they decided to stay. Others were fleeing

troubles back home, although there have been fewer of these

since the defeat of the Tuigan Horde. Still others simply ran

out of money and have never been able to afford passage home.

Shou Town is a quarter of the city that favors all things

eastern. The buildings here feature the architecture of Kara-

Tur, and there is no better place in all Faern to find a Shou

restaurant or inn. The people here are mostly poor but honest,

happy for the chance to carve out a life for themselves in this

new land. But along with peasants and minor merchants, the

Shou brought with them the criminals of their native land

the yakuza of the Nine Golden Swords. The Swords hope to

one day wrest control of Telflamm from the citys Shadow-

masters, but they do not yet dare to challenge the shadowlords

directly, not in their home city.

CASTLE BALINDRE

About four and a half centuries ago, an Impilturan merchant

named Windyn Balindre founded the city of Telflamm. He

had a vision of a gateway to the east, and he invested all of

183

THESK

his prodigious fortune and business savvy into making that

dream a reality. The Royal Company of Shou-Lung, Balindres

company, pioneered the endless miles of the Golden Way and

established a chain of outposts along its length. Balindre de-

clared himself Merchant Prince, a title of respect he hoped

would impress his business partners in Kara-Tur.

When Balindre died, he passed his royal charter and his as-

sumed title on to his son. Each heir to the house of Balindre has

taken on this mantle ever since. Today, Prince Wendren Balin-

dre (LE male human Rog4/Ari4) rules over the city from his

familys castle, a fortified building right on the waterfront that

has been so important to Telflamms fortunes over the years.

While the prince may rule the city in name, in practice he has

long been the puppet of the Shadowmasters. The thieves have

a habit of killing troublesome princes, so Wendren Balindre does

nothing to clean up the corruption of his city watch or his mer-

chant council. Instead, he demands a suitable consideration

from the Shadowmasters to continue their activities, and has his

minions stop the occasional crime of note so the cityfolk wont

see the ineffectiveness and graft of their overlord.

Most of Telflamms citizens know the city watch is for sale

but believe that the prince is earnestly working to get rid of

the most corrupt officers. Should the depth of Prince Balin-

dres  complicity  ever  be  revealed,  Telflamm  would  likely

revolt against the princes rule.

THE MERCHANTS FORTRESS

The power in Telflamm rests in the hands of the Merchants

Council,  the  wealthiest  and  most  influential  people  in  Tel-

flamm andby extensionthe whole of Thesk. The number

of people in this august group varies from year to year as elder

members die and promising new entrepreneurs are brought on.

The Council is a legislative and regulative body, intended to

balance the power of the citys ruling prince and moderate the

citys commerce. To house their operations, the members of

the  Merchants  Council  pitched  in  to  build  the  Merchants

Fortress, a sprawling stone complex perched atop the tallest

hill in the center of the city. The polished, white stone walls

of this edifice can be seen throughout Telflamm.

The prince controls the city watch and the militia, but every

councilor has a private force. At least half of these are head-

quartered in the Merchants Fortress, while most of the rest

are traveling along the Golden Way, escorting caravans safely

to their destinations.

THE HOUSE OF THE MASTERS SHADOW

This is the hidden temple of Mask as well as the headquarters

of the local thieves guildthe infamous Shadowmasters of

Telflamm. People who are new to town may have a hard time

finding it, but anyone who has lived and worked here for any

time knows all about the Shadowmasters and the secret citadel

from which they operate.

The Shadowmasters have their fingers in just about every

pie  in  the  city.  Through  racketeering,  prostitution,  drugs,

extortion, murder, and other, even fouler practices, they are

by far the most successful business in Telflamm. Directly

or indirectly, just about everyone in the city works for the

Shadowmasterswhether they like it or not.

The  House  of  the  Masters  Shadow  looks  like  any  other

temple in town. The only difference is that this building has

absolutely no locks. The Shadowmasters know such safeguards

are useless against most of their members, and everyone else

in town knows better than to even dream of taking something

from them.

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

The  business  of  Telflamm  is business,  as  they  say,  and  the

towns streets are crowded with merchant emporiums, trading

costers,  and  shipping  agents.  Telflamm  produces  little  for

export itself but instead is a gateway to the rest of Faern for

the exotic goods of the eastmostly silk, spices, smokepowder,

and small handcrafted works of art.

Telflamm  is  home  to  one  of  the  older  Thayan  enclaves,  a

small, cluttered district conceded to Thay more than twenty years

ago. The enclave is set up on a hill to the north of the city, a for-

tified structure enclosing several other buildings within a 20-foot-

tall stone wall. The Thayans sell all manner of imported items,

but discounted magic items are their most popular merchandise.

The prices on these are consistently 10% less than those listed in

Chapter 8: Magic Items in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. For

more details on Thayan enclaves, including a full description of

a sample enclave, see the Lords of Darkness accessory.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Besides the House of the Masters Shadow, Telflamm has tem-

ples  to  Shaundakul,  Waukeen,  and  Tymora.  Cyrics  faith  is

common  in  the  city,  although  the  clerics  of  the  Black  Sun

must worship their sinister deity in secret. In recent months,

the Hall of the Avenging Hammer, a small temple of Tyr, has

grown more prominent with the appointment of a new high

priest, the Lady Justicar Vala Destrayal (LG female human

Clr13 of Tyr). She is determined to put an end to the Shad-

owmasters ruthless domination of the city and has launched

a crusade against corruption. The Shadowmasters have already

made three attempts on her life, but the Lady Justicar still

persists in her efforts to clean up the town.

Two Stars (LARGE TOWN)

If Two Stars were anywhere else in Thesk, there wouldnt be

much  to  say  about  it.  However,  the  town  is  situated  at  the

crossing of the two most important trade routes in the Un-

approachable East. While its certainly not the largest com-

munity  in  the  region,  more  commerce  passes  through  Two

Stars than anywhere else in the whole of TheskTelflamm

and Phsant included.

nose too far into anyones business. In her opinion, whatever

anyone is doing is probably okay as long as no one gets hurt.

The Gallidys make their money by charging a road tax

on  wagons  passing  through  town.  Individuals  without

wagons are exempt, but all others must surrender a payment

equal to about 1% of their cargos value. This is a reasonable

enough cost that few people try to avoid it or even complain

much. However, with all the traffic passing through the place,

the fees add up quickly. It has made the Gallidys the wealth-

iest family in Thesk, other than the great merchant lords of

Telflamm itself.

The  Gallidys  live  in  an  expansive  castle  at  the  center  of

town. Both the Golden Way and the Cold Road pass through

its gates, coming in from each of the cardinal directions. The

crossroads is right in the castles main courtyard, emphasiz-

ing the influence the Gallidys have over trade in the region.

Lady Gallidy is currently struggling with an incursion by

the Shadowmasters of Telflamm. The Shadowmasters would

love to claim Two Stars, but they hadnt reckoned on the fe-

rocity with which Lady Gallidy fights to protect what belongs

to her family. Still, a darkness has fallen over the town, and

only Lady Gallidys stubborn good-heartedness keeps it from

engulfing Two Stars.

GALLIDY CASTLE

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

Lady Yolatir Gallidy (CG female human Ari2/Exp10) is the

latest in a long line of Gallidys to govern Two Stars, a town

originally named for the stars of east and west that meet in the

heavens overhead. Her general style of rule is to not stick her

needs  of  the  merchants  passing  through.  Here  almost  any-

thing that can be legally sold is, and everything else changes

hands just outside its walls. The 30-foot-tall stone walls that

surround the place have withstood tornadoes, fended off ban-

dits,  and  even  persuaded  the  Tuigan  Horde  to  pass  it  by  in

favor of easier pickings. The Gallidys are a wealthy people, and

they dont stint on making sure they stay that way.

The Crossroads Inn is the most popular in town. This was

the first business ever built by Prasso Gallidy, the towns now-

legendary founder. It sits on the northwest corner of the cross-

roads,  right  inside  Gallidy  Castles  main  courtyard.  The

Gallidys themselves spend most of their evenings here. Mer-

chants from Telflamm and far Kara-Tur drink at adjoining

tables or even share a flask of wine.

Two Stars is also home to a small Thayan enclave. It boasts

the lowest prices on magic items outside of Thay itself. Most

common magic items can be had here for 15% off the normal

market price. The Thayans originally asked to build their en-

clave inside the walls of Gallidy Castle. Remembering Thays

previous  attempts  to  take  over  all  Theskincluding  Two

Starsthe Gallidys balked at this. Lady Gallidy didnt want to

permit the Thayans in her town at all, but their fabulous and

exclusive new business was too much for her to resist.

While  there  are  many  different  types  of  shops  in  Two

Stars, the most interestingoutside of the Thayan enclave, of

coursewould have to be the Seers Eye. This is a storefront

opened up by an enterprising group of former adventurers to

sell  their  services  as  high-level  spellcasters.  They  include  a

former Red Wizard among their ranks, along with both good

and evil clerics. They can cast just about any spell on 24 hours

notice, as long as they can obtain the necessary material com-

ponents  (not  always  an  easy  task).  The  most  commonly  re-

quested spells are divinations to determine the potential fate of

caravans heading across the Endless Wastes. This undertaking

is always fraught with peril, and many merchants find it worth

their  whileand  their  livesto  hedge  their  bets  by  seeking

useful prophecies before setting out on the long journey.

IMPORTANT TEMPLES

There are many chapels in Two Stars but few temples. Most

of these are staffed by a single cleric who ministers to the needs

of the followers of his deity as they pass through. The only ex-

ception is the temple of Shaundakul, the patron of travelers.

Just about everyone who passes through Two Stars stops to pay

her respects to the Rider of the Winds. This keeps the head

priest of the templeShanton Gallidy (CN male human Clr12

of Shaundakul), cousin to Lady Gallidyin great comfort. He

has constructed the grandest temple to Shaundakul in all the

East, despite the communitys relatively small size.

Heroes and

Monsters

Characters native to Thesk are most often humans, halflings,

or  half-orcs,  although  a  number  of  gnomes  inhabit  the

Dragonjaw  Mountains.  The  humans  of  Thesk  are  mostly

Damaran,  Rashemi,  or  Shou  (although  some  Tuigans  still

remain, having decided to settle in the lands they formerly

tried to conquer). Bands of gnolls from the Plateau of Thay

sometimes wander down into the eastern portions of the coun-

try,  and  some  of  these  humanoids  find  work  as  sellswords,

guarding caravans and serving as bodyguards. Most Theskian

adventurers are bards, clerics, fighters, or rogues.

Of  the  prestige  classes  introduced  in  Chapter  2:  Prestige

Classes, the most common in Thesk are the Shou disciple and

the  Telflammar  shadowlord  (although  Thayan  slavers  also

prey on this land). The Shou Expatriate region described in

Chapter 3: Regions and Feats is common among characters

from the Shou-towns of Thesks crowded cities. Several of the

feats in this chapter are appropriate for Theskian characters,

especially Improved Grapple, a Shou fighting technique.

Monsters native to these lands most often come from the

laboratories  of  Thay.  The  blooded  ones  are  common  here,

most often blood orcs sent from Thay to patrol the borders.

Dread warriors and juju zombies spawned in Thay also harry

the frontiers and plague the eastern reaches of Thesk. Hag-

spawn and spirit folk are not uncommon in Ashanath, as the

eastern reaches of Thesk are close to Rashemen culturally and

demographically as well as physically. For more information

on new creatures, see Chapter 6: Monsters of the East.

186

The five lands of Aglarond, the Great Dale, Rashemen,

Thay,  and  Thesk  stretch  nearly  700  miles  from

north  to  south  and  900  miles  from  east  to  west.

Bounded by the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Easting Reach to the

west,  the  Unapproachable  East  is  surrounded  by  the  Wizards

Reach  and  the  Alamber  Sea  to  the  south.  To  the  southeast

stands Mulhorand, the former ruler of what is now Thay. To the

east, beyond the Sunrise Mountains, the Endless Wastes march

seemingly  forever  toward  Kara-Tur.  To  the  north,  the  Icerim

Mountains and once-proud Narfell hem in the region. Impiltur

and Damara complete the circle to the northwest.

The Sea of

Fallen Stars

The Sea of Fallen Stars, also known as the Inner Sea, is the

largest landlocked body of water in Faern. It reaches all the

way  from  Suzail  in  the  Dragonmere  to  Gheldaneth  in  the

Alamber Sea to the east, a distance of over 1,800 miles. It also

stretches nearly 1,200 miles from Ilmwatch in the northern

part of the Easting Reach all the way down to Nimpeth in the

southern portion of the Vilhon Reach. With the exception of

Rashemen,  every  nation  of  the  Unapproachable  East  has  a

portion of the Sea of Fallen Stars crashing on its shores.

Ships of all sorts ply the Inner Sea, and a hundred ports

crowd  along  its  shores.  While  piracy  is  a  major  problem  in

some  of  the  other  lands  bordering  the  Sea  of  Fallen  Stars,

these cutthroats have learned to give Aglarond and Thay a

wide berth. Corsairs come to a bad end in both lands, destroyed

by powerful magic. Thesk and the Great Dale are not so well

protected,  but  the  Royal  Navy  of  Impiltur,  one  of  the

strongest warfleets of the Inner Sea, shields the Easting Reach.

The Impilturans are under no obligation to protect the far

side of the Reach, but most captains try to capture pirate ves-

sels anywhere they encounter them.

The Easting Reach

The Easting Reach is the northeastern arm of the Sea of Fallen

Stars, stretching up along the western coasts of the Great Dale

and Thesk. Most travelers consider Cape Dragonfang, just off

the westernmost tip of the Dragonjaw Mountains, to be the

place where the Easting Reach meets the Sea of Fallen Stars.

The Easting Reach effectively separates Impiltur from the Un-

approachable East, but trade across these waters is common,

mostly from Ilmwatch and Sarshel to Telflamm.

Sea of Dlurg

The Sea of Dlurg is the body of water between Aglarond and

southern  Thesk.  Dominated  by  the  spectacular  Dragonjaw

Mountains  plunging  into  its  northern  reaches,  the  Sea  of

Dlurg is more of an Aglarondan lake, although the Theskian

city of Milvarune sits on the northern shore.

Today,  the  Thayans  have  made  this  region  into  a  major

shipping lane, sailing from Nethentir down the River Umber

to its mouth on the Sea of Dlurg. In times of war, the Agla-

rondan fortress at Emmech bars the passage of Thayan ves-

sels, but for now the tenuous peace between the Simbul and

the Red Wizards holds, and Thayan ships pass into the Inner

Sea  unhindered.  The  Aglarondan  fisherfolk  here  avoid  the

Thayan ships, recalling all too well the times when Thayan

dromonds raided their shores.

187

BORDER AREAS

The Wizards Reach

Between the Thousand Swords of Altumbel and the Akana-

peaks of Chessenta, the Sea of Fallen Stars narrows to little

more than 100 miles in width. This broad eastern arm of the

Inner Sea extends almost 1,000 miles to the east, linking the

Old Empires with the ports of western Faern. The portion

of this arm from Delthuntle in the west to the Alaor in the

east is known as the Wizards Reach. It forms the southern

borders of both Aglarond and Thay, separating them from the

Old Empires to the south.

The Wizards Reach sees a lot of traffic these days, mostly

moving from Bezantur to Thayan enclaves around the Sea of

Fallen Stars and back. The sahuagin who live here have learned

to recognize Thayan ships from the red sigils painted on the

bottom of their hulls, and they give such vessels a wide berth.

The Alamber Sea

This body of water is an extension of the Wizards Reach, run-

ning south from Bezantur all the way to Gheldaneth on Mul-

horands southern coast. Ships from Bezantur sail up and down

its coast constantly, bringing Thayan goods to major cities in

both  Unther  and  Mulhorand.  The  Alamber  Sea  is  occupied

mostly by the sahuagin of the kingdom of Aleaxtis, a good por-

tion of which actually surrounds the Alaor. Thay had problems

with these creatures in the past, but the Red Wizards treated

the sahuagin so mercilessly that the sea devils grudgingly allow

Thayan vessels free passage through the Alamber Sea.

Giantspire

Mountains

North of the Rawlinswood rise the rugged, snowy Giantspire

Mountains. Claimed by both Damara and the Nar tribes, the

range is, in fact, occupied by the folk of neither land, for hob-

goblins, bugbears, and evil cloud giants hold the peaks.

The  Long  Road  crosses  the  Giantspires,  right  through  a

region of rolling foothills known as the Giant Gap. Snows close

the gap in the wintertime, but few travelers come this way

even  at  the  height  of  summermarauders  and  monsters

harry travelers in this lonely and desolate land.

The hobgoblins of the Giantspires are ruled by King Kar-

dobbik (LE male hobgoblin Ftr12), a particularly danger-

ous  warlord.  The  kings  primary  advisor  is  Lady  Farkattle

(LE female hobgoblin Nec11). She has managed to animate

the corpse of a long-dead, very old deep dragon that once made

its home here but was slain in the war that brought the old

empire of Narfell to a bloody end. This skeletal dragon looks

like  a  dracolich  to  the  uninitiated,  but  it  is  entirely  under

Farkattles  control.  Kardobbik  uses  this  fearsome  monster  to

keep the hobgoblin tribes of the Giantspires in lineno easy task.

Mulhorand

Mulhorand was once a sprawling empire that encompassed all

of Thay as well as the lands of Murghm and Semphar to the

east. The Thayans have not forgotten this part of their his-

tory, no matter how many hundreds of years ago it may have

been.  They  guard  their  border  with  Mulhorand  carefully,

ready to beat back any invasion force that may come their

way. The two nations have fought terrible wars on several oc-

casions, the last less than a hundred years ago.

Mulhorand has its collective hands full these days, trying

to absorb what it can of Unther in the wake of that nations

dissolution.  This  makes  the  Mulhorandi  much  too  busy  to

worry about Thay. Despite the rivalry between the two na-

tions, Mulhorand is actually the closest thing Thay has to an

ally.  The  Thayan  nobles  and  zulkirs  are  Mulan,  sharing  a

common language and heritage with the Mulhorandi. Also,

since  slavery  is  legal  in  Mulhorand,  Thay  imports  a  great

number of slaves from its ancient fatherland.

Mountains of Copper

The Mountains of Copper march east from the Sunrise Moun-

tains and are an ancient spur of that mighty range. This

was once the home of a proud dwarven race that fought bit-

terly  against  Mulhorandi  rule  hundreds  of  years  ago.  Al-

though  many  of  their  southern  holds  were  destroyed,  the

surviving dwarves have taken up residence on the north side

of the chain, facing the wide expanse of the Endless Wastes.

The Mulhorandi eventually gave up on the idea of subjugat-

ing the dwarves.

The copper dragons of the Dragonjaw Mountains are de-

scended  from  the  even  larger  family  of  dragons  who  make

their home here. They live in the western potion of the range,

overlooking the gap of the Clearflow River.

Ganathwood

The Ganathwood is a strange and dark place nestled against

the southern portion of the Sunrise Mountains. The place was

once occupied by wild elves, much like the Yuirwood of Agla-

rond,  but  this  people  died  out  entirely.  Today,  the  place  is

home to wild creatures and bloodthirsty monsters. The largest

group  in  the  Ganathwood  is  a  tribe  of  escaped  slaves  from

Thay and Mulhorand who have gone native, returning to an

almost feral state in the heart of the forest. Cut off from the

outside world, these people have learned to make do with what

little they can scrape together. Some here dream of leading a

rebellion  against  the  leaders  in  the  Mulhorandi  capital  of

Skuld, but such ideas are the ramblings of madmen.

188

BORDER AREAS

The Endless Wastes

The Endless Wastes encompass some of the most inhospitable

terrain on all Toril. This is a vast, waterless wasteland allevi-

ated by only a handful of oases. The only people who live here

are the Tuigans, which is why this region is also known as the

Hordelands. For many years, raiders here plagued the mer-

chants  traveling  along  the  Golden  Way  between  the  Unap-

proachable  East  and  Kara-Tur.  These  same  raiders  united

under  the  banner  of  Yamun  Khahan  and  invaded  Faern.

They were destroyed in a massive battle in the heart of Thesk,

greatly reducing the power of the Tuigan folk.

Today, those who travel the Golden Way only occasionally

have to worry about bandits. The greatest danger now comes

from the monsters that roam the wastes, creatures that were

previously kept in check by the now-reduced Tuigans.

Great Ice Sea

The Great Ice Sea is a large body of salt water in the far north

of the Endless Wastes, about 150 miles north of the Golden

Way.  Most  travelers  have  no  reason  to  deviate  from  their

path to reach the always-frozen waters of this massive sea.

Long ago, the Raumathari kings used to winter in a palace

on the Great Ice Seas southern shore, at a place called Win-

terkeep. The city has long since been abandoned, and all that

is left is a set of ruins where the palace once stood. The Tu-

igans in the region give Winterkeep a wide berth despite the

legends of great riches in the underground levels beneath the

palace ruins. These same legends also tell how the angry ice

gods of the sea rose up from the frozen waters to seal the Rau-

mathari in solid blocks of ice. These ice godsor ice demons,

as many of the Tuigans call themare said to still haunt Win-

terkeeps weathered remains.

The Golden Way

As the main trade route to the east, the Golden Way has long

been one of the most important assets of the Unapproachable

East. As it passes east out of the mountains and down into the

wastes, the Golden Way ceases being a proper road. Instead, it

becomes a series of stone markers, each visible from the last,

leading out into the broad expanse. The Golden Way is valu-

able not because its well maintained, but because it connects

oases and other precious sources of water. Without these vital

watering  holes,  it  would  be  nearly  impossible  to  cross  the

Hordelands without dying of thirst.

The  Shadowmasters  and  the  Red  Wizards  both  have  big

plans for the Golden Way and the communities along it. With

the Tuigans out of the picture, both groups feel the time is

right to expand into Shou Lung and the rest of Kara-Tur. This

is a vast, untapped market for peddling their particular brands

of evil.

Lake of Mists

The Lake of Mistsso named for the water that continuously

evaporates off its surfaceis the largest body of fresh water

in  the  Hordelands,  a  veritable  paradise  in  the  desert.  This

means, of course, that it is the likeliest place for brigands to

settle, which is one reason why the Golden Way gives its shores

a wide berth.

Few people have extensively explored the Lake of Mists,

and most who have gone off to do so have never come back.

Legend has it that it once covered most of the Endless Wastes,

but some nameless evil in its center created a permanent gate

that drains away most of the lakes water to this day. For what

purpose this may have been done, no one can say. If the leg-

ends  are  true,  finding  and  sealing  the  gate could  flood  the

whole  of  the  Hordelands,  transforming  the  region  from  a

barren waste into the largest lake on the face of Toril.

Icerim Mountains

The Icerim Mountains form the northern border of this por-

tion of Faern. Beyond these perpetually snow-mantled peaks

there is little but snow and ice.

The Icerims are home to all sorts of cold-loving creatures

that  dont  care  for  the  relatively  warm  plains  of  the  North

Country of Rashemen: frost giants, frost worms, remorhazes,

taers, and white dragons. Only the hardiest of peoples would

dare to live in such an environment, much less thrive on hunt-

ing such beasts. Yet the tribes of humans, dwarves, and orcs that

live  here  do  just  thatalthough  the  dwarves  cheat  a  bit  by

living in the sheltering warmth of the mountains themselves.

There  are  stories  of  a  warmer  land  beyond  the  Icerims,

almost at the top of the world, surrounded by a ring of active

volcanoes that keep the place steamy. Another legend has this

pleasant valley centered upon a permanent gate that permits

creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire to wander about

the place. However, no reliable sources have ever been able to

verify such tales.

Narfell

Narfell, frigid land of barbarian tribes, was once the heart of a

vast empire that included all of the Great Dale, much of Thesk,

and part of the Plateau of Thay, among other lands. In those

days,  evil  priests  ruled  Narfell,  maintaining  power  through

horrid blood-pacts with demon lords. However powerful it may

once have been, this great civilization fell over 1,500 years ago

in a climactic battle with its ancient enemy Raumathar.

The few survivors from the old empire fell back to Narfells

current borders to nurse their wounds, vowing to rebuild their

mighty realm. That dream has long since fallen by the way-

side. Today, most Nars have little inkling of their high and

sinister past, concerned as they are with simply surviving the

regions harsh winters.

The plains of Narfell are littered with ruins, most of which

are ignored by the Nars. They have learned that there are usu-

ally goodand often lethalreasons why these places have re-

mained undisturbed for so long. Still, every now and then, a

group of adventurers gets it into their collective head to poke

around in these places. The Nars dont discourage this, since

they can pick up the pieces after the foolhardy foreigners trip

any long-dormant traps.

Merchants who dont wish to travel through Thesk some-

times  use  Narfell  as  an  alternative  trade  route.  The  Long

Road starts in Damara and enters Narfell through the pass in

the Giantspire Mountains before intersecting with the Cold

Road at NJast. From there, it continues on toward Nathoud,

which  stands  in  the  shadows  of  the  Icerim  Mountains  in

northern  Rashemen.  However,  the  Giant  Gap,  as  its  com-

monly  known,  is  impassable  for  much  of  the  winter  and

plagued by hobgoblins.

30,000  Nars.  This  festivalalso  named  Bildoobarisis  the

largest and most important holiday in Narfell, and even the cru-

elest and most fierce Nar tribes come to drink, feast, and trade.

Mount Nar

The ancient rulers of Jastaath, one of the petty Nar kingdoms

that existed before the rise of the Empire of Narfell, ruled

over their homeland from a massive fortress high atop the

western slopes of Mount Nar. In those days, the magic of the

great priest-kings kept the weather around the fortress pleas-

ant and warm even in the dead of winter. Today, the ruins of

that once-great city lie lost beneath never-melting snow.

To  this  day,  no  modern  expedition  to  the  peak  has  even

found  the  buried  ruins  of  the  castle,  much  less  penetrated

them. Such efforts are no doubt hindered by the presence of

Kryonar, the white dracolich wyrm who lives in an icy cavern

in the mountains northern face.

Damara

The  unofficial  capital  of  Narfell  is  little  more  than  an  open

plain in the shadow of Mount Nar, a massive, snow-capped peak

visible  from  the  crossroads  at  NJast.  For  one  tenday  each

summer,  this  humble  plain  becomes  a  thriving  city  of  over

to Nathoud, and Damaran foresters log the western verge of

the Rawlinswood, but these are rare and hardy souls.

In recent years, the rise of the Rotting Man and his blight-

lords in the Rawlinswood has posed a new threat to the king-

dom  of  Damara.  Blightspawned  monstrosities  have  made

woodcutting  and  trapping  in  the  Rawlinswood  a  dangerous

proposition, and blightspawned volodni warriors have attacked

and burned numerous homesteads near the forest. The Talon-

tar have become strong enough to force an unlikely alliance

between  the  Nentyarch  and  King  Dragonsbane  of  Damara,

who in years past differed over logging the ancient wood.

Trails End

This large Damaran city lies close to the Rawlinswood. Long

a center of trade in the region, it has recently built a reputa-

tion as the perfect launching point for one adventure or an-

other. From Trails End, adventurers set out to explore the

ancient ruins of the Rawlinswood, harry the evil marauders of

the Giantspires, and travel the Long Road to Rashemen.

The Icelace River

This  river  runs  fast  and  wide  enough  that  it  never  freezes

over, even in the middle of the harshest winters. Its icy waters

are cold enough to kill within minutes any human unfortu-

nate enough to fall in. This makes the river the first line of

defense for Damara against raids by the more aggressive Nar

tribesfolk. For the most part, King Dragonsbane has refused

to push beyond the edges of the Rawlinswood, but if the Nars

of the steppes and the blightlords of the forest continue to

harry  his  eastern  frontiers,  he  may  decide  its  necessary  to

claim that land to make his borders more defensible.

Impiltur

In this part of the world, Impiltur is second only to Thesk in

the unabashed importance it places on commerce. This is re-

flected in the fact that almost all of the countrys largest cities

are arrayed along its coast, stretching from Ilmwatch in the

far north of the Easting Reach all the way down to Lyrabar

on the edge of the Gray Forest and the Vast. Impiltur is a

good neighbor to the Great Dale and to Thesk. Traders from

Dilpur,  Sarshel,  and  the  other  cities  of  the  kingdom  bring

much prosperity to Telflamm and Uthmere.

Impiltur is an old, strong land that has existed in one form

or  another  along  this  coast  for  well  over  a  thousand  years.

Impilturans settled much of Damara, the Great Dale, Thesk,

and even the northern coasts of Aglarond. On rare occasions,

the  kings  of  Impiltur  have  stood  with  the  folk  of  these

younger lands against threats from the east, such as the Red

Wizards or the Tuigan Horde, but Impilturans have a history

of avoiding involvement in the troubles of other lands.

The  Red  Wizards  have  opened  enclaves  in  Lyrabar,

Dilpur, and Ilmwatch, all with the permission of the Council

of Lords and their figurehead, Queen Sambryl. The paladins

on the council are loath to have any dealings with the evil

Thayans, but they believe its better to have the Red Wizards

where the people of Impiltur can keep an eye on them. Also,

trade with the Thayans is so profitable that the merchants of

Impiltur have strongly lobbied on the foreigners behalf.

ILMWATCH

More a fortress than a city, Ilmwatch is a large town that

guards  trade  traveling  to  and  from  Damara  and  the  Great

Dale. Despite its strategic position at the head of the Easting

Reach, Ilmwatch is not an extremely busy port; the Great Im-

phras River is navigable up to Heliogabalus for most of the

year, so shipping from the Sea of Fallen Stars to Damara usu-

ally proceeds up the river instead of offloading in Ilmwatch.

However, many coasters and sailing ships ferry trade across

to Uthmere. The road leading north to Damara is known as

the Heralds Road, and numerous small villages dot its length.

The lord of Ilmwatch is Heskar Brandosk (NG male human

Ftr6),  a  doughty  leader  who  vigorously  patrols  the  nearby

coasts to discourage piracy. He has earned the enmity of the

Shadowmasters of Telflamm, who have made several attempts

to kill the Impilturan and replace him with a less zealous lord.

SARSHEL

Sarshel was one of the four city-states that united to form the

nation of Impiltur beneath the banner of the great war-captain

Imphras almost 300 years ago. The city serves as Impilturs

gateway to the East and the North. It is governed by two of

Impilturs Twelve Companions, Lords Rilaunyr (LG female

human Pal13) and Silaunbrar (LG male half-elf Pal12).

During the long years of the Bloodstone Wars, Sarshels

trade  came  to  a  virtual  standstill,  and  the  city  declined.

Gareth Dragonsbanes victory over the Witch-Kings forces

15 years ago did little to change Sarshels fortunes, since

the bustling town of Ilmwatch captured much of the Dama-

ran  trade  that  formerly  passed  through  Sarshel,  and  the

cities  of  Dilpur  and  Hlammach  drew  away  much  of  the

highly  profitable  Golden  Way  traffic  that  formerly  came

from Telflamm to Sarshel.

Hard times in Sarshel have led to the rise of brigandage,

piracy, and smuggling. Several of Sarshels most prominent

merchants secretly sponsor piracy in the Easting Reach. The

most powerful of these merchant-pirates is Strengedar Ham-

merfist (NE male shield dwarf Rog7/Ftr5). Strengedar owns

a fleet of six large ships and dozens of small coasters and skiffs

that ply the inlets and uninhabited isles of the Reach.

Surprisingly, the Shadowmasters of Telflamm have noth-

ing to do with the rise of crime in Sarshel, and so far the shady

merchants of Sarshel have resisted intrusions by the powerful

Telflammar guild. The city is growing restless, and Sarshels

wealthiest and most powerful citizens harbor schemes of se-

cession from Impiltur in order to gain a free hand in their

true business.

A Call

to Arms

Introduction

The citizens of Phent, which is a large town in Thesk, are a proud, yet

warm and accepting folk. For the past nine years, they have been host

to over six hundred orcs, which is certainly an anomaly in the average

Faernian community. In 1360 DR, Zhentil Keep sent one thousand

orcs to aid in the fight against the westward-sweeping Tuigan hordes.

The orcs fought wellwell enough that the citizens of Thesk welcomed

them as citizens when Zhentil Keep abandoned them in this land in 1363

DR. Still, a current of unsettling concern lingers. Some believe that the orcs

are still part of Zhentil Keeps strike force, but that they went on standby

to wait for the moment when their masters give the signal. Once allowed,

these orcs may launch a crippling attack from within.

However, in nine years, no signal has been givenat least none

that any of the paranoid folk have noticed. The orcs are enthusias-

tic citizens and, apart from some rowdiness during breaks from the

mines or fields, they have hurt no one.

And then, a prophet comes, with a message of war . . .

In A Call to Arms, the player characters (PCs) have a chance to

prevent orcs from rising up against some humans. This adventure is

designed for four 9th-level D&D characters. The encounters can be

adjusted up or down to suit your groups needs, however.

Preparation

You, the Dungeon Master (DM), need a copy of the Players Hand-

book, the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide, and the Monster Manual to

use this material. You may also want to have a copy of Unapproach-

able  East and  Magic  of  Faern handy.  Boxed  text  that  appears

throughout this adventure is player information, which you can read

aloud or paraphrase when appropriate. Monster and NPC statistics

are  provided  with  each  encounter  in  abbreviated  form  or,  where

appropriate, the Monster Manual is referenced.

Adventure

Background

Despite  what  some  may  think,  those  in  Zhentil  Keep  havent  for-

gotten about their orc troops in Phent. In public discussion in Zhen-

til Keep, the leaders of the Zhentilar, the military branch of Zhentil

Keep,  have  confidently  asserted  that  the  orcs  in  Thesk  are  com-

pletely loyal to Zhentil Keep. They maintain that the orcs are just

biding their time and building up trust among the citizens, until the

appointed time when the word is given.

In private, these same leaders are gravely concerned. The leaders

didnt get to positions of command by being idiots, and they know

that the orcs are treated well and accepted in Thesk, which is a rarity

for them with the humans and humanoids of Faern in general. The

leaders know that many of the orcs would be reluctant to destroy

the source of this acceptance.

But what if the orcs chief god, Gruumsh, told them to?

The  Zhentilar  turned  to  the  Black  Network  and  presented  the

problem. The Zhents knew what to do. The Zhents have dispatched

a powerful cleric, a master of persuasion and deception, to pose as an

orc prophet of Gruumsh and whip the orcs into a destructive frenzy.

In addition, the Zhentilar have staged raids against human caravans

by what look like orc warriors so that they can start antiorc senti-

ment among the population of Thesk.

Adventure

Summary

The main portion of this adventure is the investigation of the mys-

terious  orc  prophet,  who  is  located  in  the  eastern  foothills  of  the

Thesk Mountains about 20 miles due east of Phent. The party needs

to do some snooping around Phent to collect some information, and

they must help prevent a bit of misplaced mob justice by stopping

the self-styled prophet of Gruumsh before the less acclimated orcs

decide to follow his words.

Character Hooks

While the heroes can get involved in this adventure in several ways,

the  best  way  includes  an  encounter  that  occurs  about  ten  miles

northeast of Phent, along the Golden Way. Here are some hooks to

get the adventurers into this region:

A new Thayan enclave could possibly open up in Phent. Not only

do certain individuals want it checked out to make sure that every-

things aboveboard, some say that the proprietor plans to have an

opening-day sale with some fantastic bargains.

Reports  of  increased  bandit  raids  on  the  Golden  Way  between

Phent and Pshant have prompted various councils to send adven-

turers  out  along  that  route  to  investigate.  Ideally,  these  groups

will find traces of the bandits, track them back to their lair, and

eliminate the problem.

A merchant and his son hire the group to escort the pair from

Telflamm to Tammar. If this hook is used, bear in mind that the

group needs to come up with some way to be released from their

obligation so that they can address the serious matter at hand.

Encounters

The  following  encounters  begin  in  a  somewhat  linear  progression,

but once the heroes become engaged in the adventure, they should

have  some  options  about  which  course  to  follow.  In  the  end,  they

should  discover  the  prophet,  but  if  they  dont,  some  consequences

follow that DMs may want to use in their campaigns.

The Raid (EL 10)

The heroes encounter a brutal attack on a caravan about ten miles

northeast of Phent. While the attack looks as if it is conducted by

the local orc population, the perpetrators are in fact a squad of elite

Zhent  half-orc  warriors  who  have  been  subtly  touched  up  to

resemble full-blooded orcs.

The  Golden  Way,  famed  trade  route,  is  a  well-maintained  road

that  is  usually  a  pleasure  to  travel  upon.  As  you  move  along,

though, you see the beginnings of a plume of smoke rising at a

point around a small bend in the Way. The plume drifts up to the

heavily overcast sky. The scent of burning wood and grass reaches

you, as well.

You  can  also  hear  faint  sounds  of  the  clashing  of  steel,  the

frightened  whinnies  of  horses,  the  mingled  din  of  guttural  war

cries,  and  the  shouts  and  screams  of  panicked  victims  coming

from that general direction.

Once the PCs get within 700 feet of the plume, they can make Spot

checks  (DC  13)  to  see  the  attacking  Zhents  and  their  foes.  The

Zhents and their foes Spot the approaching PCs at the same distance

if they make Spot checks of their own (DC 20). If the PCs try to

approach with stealth, the Spot DC to see them coming is 25 + the

worst  Hide  skill  modifier  in  the  group;  however,  the  PCs  also

receives a 2 penalty to their own Spot checks. Any group that fails

the Spot check automatically sees their foes when they get within

350 feet.

Since the orcs and their victims are rather busy with the work at

hand, both of these groups receive a 5 penalty on any Listen checks

they might make to notice the PCs. Read the following aloud, adjust-

ing as necessary, when the PCs successfully see the combat ahead:

A caravan of four wagons is halted on the road, and one of them

is in flames. The drivers and the well-dressed merchants have run

from the wagons, desperately trying to get out of harms way. A

group of six warriors, possibly hired guards, are busily engaging a

force of ten orcs mounted on horseback. The orcs move and fight

with the practiced air of experienced warriors.

Anyone  who  can  understand  Orc,  will  make  out  the  phrases  No

more peace! and All humans must die!

The orcs are disguised half-orcs. If the PCs get a good look at

them  (as  they  might  if  they  attack  them  or  try  to  parley  with

them), they can make Spot checks (DC 25) to note the disguise.

Creatures: The orc fighters are mounted on horses, and they use

the horses to their advantage in combat.

DCaravan  Guards  (6):  War  3;  hp  18;  see  DUNGEON MASTERs

Tactics: The orcs focus on eliminating the caravan guards first,

unless  they  see  evidence  that  the  party  is  quite  proficient;  spell-

throwing characters are noticed particularly. If the orc group loses

half  its  number,  the  remaining  members  make  a  retreat  into  the

hills, but they do not go back to the prophet. Rather, they attempt

to go deeper into the mountains in hopes of shaking off pursuit.

Development: The  merchant  is  named  Boren  (NG  male  human

Exp5), and his son is Baderan (NG male human Exp2), and they had

set  out  from  Phent  with  intentions  to  reach  Tammar.  Should  the

party rescue them, they are most effusive in their gratitude and prom-

ise the group some excellent bargains the next time they are in Phent.

If all the caravan guards are dead, Boren asks the heroes to escort

him and his son to Tammar, and he offers 3 gp per day of travel

(plus food and drink) to each adventurer in exchange for guardian

services rendered. Should the group do this, roll normal chances of

encounters during the trip.

In  any  event,  Boren  gives  the  party  one  very  crucial  piece  of

information: Rumors abound of the orc population in Phent getting

restless, and some orcs are always at the Resthaven Inn, in Phent,

arguing orc politics and such. Boren believes that the restlessness is

causing  the  orcs  in  Phent  to  resort  to  banditry  such  as  they  have

seen,  though  if  confronted  by  the  fact  that  the  orcs  are  actually

half-orcs, he gets puzzled and wonders aloud if a plot is afoot to rile

up the folk in Phent so that they get angry at the orcs there.

If the PCs decide to head for Phent to discover more about these

rumors, they have to cover ten miles of the Golden Way to hit the

Resthaven Inn, which is one of the larger inns right off the Golden

Way in Phent. DMs can roll for random encounters as the PCs cover

the terrain to Phent.

At the Resthaven Inn

The Resthaven Inn is one of the larger inns that the PCs see when coming

into town via the Golden Way. The group can get some idea about whats

going on in Phent. This is an excellent place to pick up rumors.

The inn is a two-story stone building with a stable out back, an

interior common room with a bar, and stairs leading up to rooms.

The  innkeeper  and  his  staff  bustle  about  serving  patrons.  The

place is full of people, and most give you only a passing glance.

At  one  table,  a  particularly  tough  orc  watches  you  with  an

appraising eye.

The  Resthaven  has  nice  rooms  for  2  gp  per  night,  though  some

lesser facilities are available for 5 sp per evening. The place is run

by Golvas Winterhaven (NG male human War5/Exp2), a huge man

with a laughing manner about him.

A few hours of drinks and chatting with the locals earns each PC

doing so a chance to make a Gather Information check. The follow-

ing  table  presents  some  information  and  the  DCs  for  the  Gather

Information check to discover that information. In each case, suc-

cess at beating a DC usually grants that DCs information and all

the  information  provided  by  succeeding  at  any  lower  DC.  DMs

might  award  slightly  more  information  than  what  is  provided

depending on how much a players roll exceeds a given DC. If a bard

is in the group and performing for the patrons successfully (as in

having an enjoyable or better performance as listed under the Per-

form skill in the Players Handbook), decrease the DC listed below

by 5. Additionally, each bit of information notes whether it is true

or not beside it.

GATHER INFORMATION

Information

Bandit raids on the road have been on the rise (true).

A  new  Thayan  enclave  may  be  opening  in  town  soon  (true).

Agents  of  Cyric  have  been  spotted  lurking  about  town  (false).

The  bandit  raids  consist  primarily  of  orcs  these  days,  it  seems

(true).

Recently,  orcs  have  been  heading  off  to  the  nearby  hills  for

some odd nightly meetings (true). The more established bandit

gangs are getting upset over the fact that orcs are taking their

plunder (true).

An actual temple of Mask is due to be constructed here soon, so

strong  is  the  power  of  the  Shadowmasters  that  it  now  can  be

done out in the open (false). One bandit gang in particular, the

Tarnished Blades, is watching the town closely and trying to use

the information they gain by doing so to get a jump on caravans

before the orc bandits do (true). Some say that the bandit orcs

arent local orcs (true).

Some believe that the Tarnished Blades are one step away from

seeking out and confronting the orc bandit leader (true).

The orc looking at the party is Sergeant Kraansh, leader of the town

watch. If the PCs show a strong interest in getting to the bottom of

the  bandit  raids,  he  eventually  approaches  the  PCs  and  asks  their

businessall  politely  done,  of  course.  If  asked  about  orc  raids,  he

frowns and appears concerned. The sergeant does his best to keep the

orcs from getting too rowdy, and, in fact, he has a dilemma.

According  to  the  good  sergeant,  meetings  take  place  almost

nightly  in  the  hills  just  outside  of  town.  Local  orcs  attend  these

meetings, and some say that a prophet has come from the wildsa

prophet of Gruumsh, talking crazy talk. Kraansh himself refuses

to go. But if the party is interested in whats going on up there, and

if it has some bearing on the raids, then Kraansh can tell the group

where the meetings are. He does advise, though, that the party be

somehow disguised or invisible. (If the party has no way to remain

hidden or invisible, he can make some potions available, but theyll

need  to  be  used  wisely,  and  hell  barter  for  themthey  certainly

arent free, but possibly discounted if used for the meeting.)

Kraansh tells the interested heroes that the meetings are usually

held an hour after midnight in a small ravine in the foothills to the

southeast,  which  is  about  an  hours  walk  or  half-hours  ride.  He

advises them to be careful and not to repeat any of it to anyone. If

the PCs decide to head out to see this meeting, the encounter called

A Nightly Meeting covers the events of this meeting.

trimmed extremely close to his head.

A SPY AMONG US

The  Zhentarim  have  an  agent  in  Thesk:  a  young  man  who  looks

wholesome and behaves decentlya hardworking sort. Boridin, the

agent,  keeps  in  close  contact  with  Zhentil  Keep  and  gives  them

tenday reports.

Boridin does odd jobs all over Thesk, but he spends a lot of time

at Resthaven Inn. He keeps an eye on the good sergeant, since he is

wary of the old veterans stabilizing influence on the orcs. If at all

possible, he ingratiates himself with the PCs, though he is extremely

careful not to overplay his hand.

* Spell found in Magic of Faern.

Boridin is in his early twenties, and he has a very open, guileless

face.  He  has  tousled  brown  hair,  freckles,  and  bright  blue  eyes.

Boridin  acts  like  a  wholesome,  hard-working  lad.  Secretly,  hes  a

spiteful,  hateful,  devout  servant  of  Bane  and  the  Zhentarim.  He

often works for Resthaven Inn, where he keeps tabs on adventurers

and reports them and their activities to the Black Network.

Loose Ends

Some of the rumors presented in the inn may cause the PCs to find

some fun that isnt quite related to the adventure at hand. Here are

some short encounters that cover the false rumors, as well as those

rumors that arent entirely relevant. (This can also be used as part

of a larger Phent Random Encounter chart. In this format, assign

each mini-encounter a 20% chance of happening.)

The Tarnished Blades (EL 9): The bandits have a pair of repre-

sentatives  anxious  to  find  information  about  caravans  leaving

town (so that they can jump on the caravan before the orc bands

do) and extremely interested to discover where the orc bandits are

hiding out (so that they can deal with the orcs in some manner

of their own choosing). The one who usually works around the inn

arranges for a few of her friends to meet up with the PCs at some

appropriate time and location. (If the PCs go about town looking

for information about bandits, they invariably draw the attention

of the second bandit, as well, with the same result.) The two prefer

dark alleys or wilderness settings, but they arent averse to getting

the  PCs  to  a  remote  location  via  subterfuge.  For  instance,  Stace

(the female of the pair assigned to gathering information) often

uses the ploy of saying that her sister was badly mauled by a brute

of an orc (or other creature) outside of town, and she cant possi-

bly move her given her current wounds unless she has help or until

her sister has been healed a bit first. If the PCs fall for this bluff,

they  meet  up  with  a  band  of  eight  bandits  from  the  Tarnished

Blades. DMs should note that the PCs may in fact find themselves

forging a temporary alliance with the bandits in return for infor-

mation about the current orc problems. Be sure to allow any inter-

actions  that  the  PCs  wish;  the  leader  of  the  Tarnished  Blades  is

quite willing to make a deal as long as it benefits her group in some

way. This aspect of the adventure is left to DMs to flesh out, how-

ever, but it can help get the PCs on track if they overlook the orc

meetings.

The Thayan Enclave: If the PCs decide that they need to check

into  this  rumored  new  enclave,  they  find  that  this  rumor  is  true.

Tracking down some visiting representatives of Thay is easier than

the PCs might expect, but thats due to the fact that things are not

yet finalized, and these representatives are still looking into various

matters (and not all of the representatives are here in Phent right

now due to various negotiations going on). If the PCs seek an audi-

ence with the Thayans, they find out only that the enclave will come

about after various matters have been reconciled (and nobody wishes

to speak about these matters). However, the PCs also can walk away

with a task from the Thayans if they wish. The task is up to the DM,

but it can include delivering a message to another existing enclave,

ensuring that the spot chosen for the enclave is free of any hidden

dangers, or something similar. (DMs might also want to use this as

a way to introduce some potions of invisibility to the PCs so that they

can sneak around when appropriate later.)

Meetings at Night (EL 7): Should the PCs decide to look more

into the matter of night meetings among orcs, they find themselves

dealing  with  some  rowdy  orcs  during  their  investigation.  The  orcs

noted their interest at some appropriate point before, and now they

want  to  make  sure  that  no  pesky  humans  are  messing  with  their

4

business. Use the statistics below, but be ready to have the sergeant

and his own troops come bust up the battle by the third round of

combat  (unless  this  takes  place  outside  town).  This  gives  the  DM

another opportunity to introduce the sergeant and send the PCs to

the section called The Nightly Meeting.

The  Temple  of  Mask: As  with  the  bandits,  interest  shown  by

the PCs in anything dealing with Mask is soon rewarded by a con-

frontation with a few followers of Maskbut only if the PCs per-

sist in following up on this lead after the first evening in town. If

the  PCs  make  a  successful  Gather  Information  check  (DC  20)

that first evening, they do find out that the Mask temple was a

rumor started by Fiskus Evanson (CN male half-orc War3), who

was actually quite drunk one evening. (He was proposing that the

bandit problems were actually the work of Masks followers and

that he wouldnt be surprised if a temple was forming up some-

where  nearby.  Others  misheard  and  took  that  as  word  that  this

was actually happening.) Should the PCs fail at the Gather Infor-

mation check with regards to following up on the Mask temple,

they dont learn of this information. Further investigation is up

to them and may lead to some interesting problems later (DMs

option).

Cyric Followers in Phent: Again, if the PCs spend time outside

the inn doing some follow-up research on the rumor about Cyric

followers,  they  can  learn  (Gather  Information  DC  20)  that  the

rumor  they  had  heard  is  completely  false.  This  time  the  rumor

comes from the speculation of a local merchants daughter, whose

father  had  just  been  assassinated.  While  some  believe  an

unscrupulous merchant from another town set up the assassina-

tion, the daughter Lesta Fording (CG female human Exp3) is cer-

tain  that  a  follower  of  Cyric  set  up  the  assassination  since  she

knows that her father and the so-called opposing merchant were

about to come to an agreement on something. If the PCs follow

up on this lead, they can talk to the daughter and find out that

the  agreement  included  her  marrying  the  son  of  the  enemy

merchant,  and  that  this  union  would  bring  together  these  two

families  in  a  manner  that  would  allow  for  further  mercantile

expansion. She believes that she saw someone wearing purple and

silver  leaving  her  fathers  rooms  just  before  he  was  discovered

dead by poison. She also thinks she had a glimpse of a skull-and-

sunburst symbol. If pressed, though, shell reveal that she isnt so

sure about the symbol. DMs can allow PCs to further investigate

this death, though this investigation goes beyond the scope of this

current adventure. Suggestions for the killer include having it be

the son of the enemy merchant (who loves another despite what

he  has  told  Lesta  and  his  father),  the  enemy  merchant  (who

decided that hed rather absorb Lestas fathers trade completely

instead  of  sharing  it  with  the  Fording  family,  who  is  a  fairly

recent  arrival  to  the  area),  or  perhaps  even  a  current  foe  from

among  the  enemies  that  the  PCs  have  already  made  who  would

have reason to disrupt a fortuitous trade alliance. Should the PCs

fail  at  their  Gather  Information  rolls,  they  may  well  end  up

spending some wasted time trying to track down nonexistent fol-

lowers of Cyric. (Of course, another option is to have this rumor

be true and integrate this adventure into an existing Cyric-based

plot in your campaign.)

The Nightly Meeting

The nightly meeting is the meeting where the prophet comes down

from the hills and talks to the gathered assembly of orcs. Should the

PCs make their way to the meeting, read the following aloud, adjust-

ing as necessary:

Picking your way carefully along the barely discernible trail, you

eventually come to a ravine. Arrayed in a sort of amphitheater-

like setting are lots of orcs. At least three hundred of them are all

focusing on one spot. They are eerily, unsettlingly silent. Standing

at the spot they are all staring at is a huge orc who is clad in the

priestly  vestments  of  a  servant  of  Gruumsh,  including  an  eye-

patch to cover the orb he gouged out as service to his god. As the

crowd watches, the cleric speaks, and his voice rings through the

ravine.

If one of the PCs has the ability to understand Orc, this is what he

or she hears (adjust as necessary for PC actions):

Orcs!  Again  I  come  to  you,  as  I  have  every  night  for  the  past

tenday, to stir your blood! For years now, you have settled down

and lived side-by-side with humans. Instead of lifting the sword of

war, you lift an axe . . . a plow! Instruments of the weak!

Have  you  forgotten  who  you  are?  Have  you  forgotten  what

you  are?  Our  god  calls  us  to  battleto  be  orcsand  you  sit  in

human  taverns  and  drink  ale,  instead  of  drinking  their  blood?

Listen to your instincts. Heed the pounding savage blood in your

veins.  Rise  up,  lift  off  this  mantle  of  false  human  civilization,

embrace your orc heritage, and go forward! Forward, in the name

of Gruumsh!

Some of the orcs stand and cheer; most just sit and ponder, and

a few shake their heads and scoff at the priests words. The priest

simply stares at the orcs, drops something on the ground, then,

gradually, his body fades away.

Eventually, the assembly starts to leave the area, most of them in

small groups, talking about what they saw. About a half-hour after

the priest fades away, the area is silent and empty.

If the PCs didnt make good use of their invisibility and hiding

options, its possible that they will have to deal with a nasty situa-

tion in terms of orcs. First of all, none of the orcs care for the fact

that the PCs are sneaking around spying on them, but enough orcs

are around who dont want to see this break into a fight that they

can  all  calm  each  other  down  somewhat.  Since  there  are  so  many

orcs, it makes no sense for the PCs to attempt to face them all down,

and  it  would  become  rather  hard  on  the  DM  to  run  that  many.

(Remember, hundreds of monsters does not equate to a good fight

for four PCs.) As an added situational modifier, several of the orcs

who werent so impressed with the priest also may have seen the PCs

talk  to  the  sergeant  back  in  town,  so  they  could  easily  become

spokespeople for the PCs and help the situation evolve into one of

the following outcomes. DMs should use the NPC Attitudes section

in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide to help adjudicate the situation;

orcs range from hostile to unfriendly initially:

PCs are escorted back to the sergeant and left in his custody, with

a slew of complaints about their presence at the meeting.

The PCs must fulfill some task for some of the orcs to appease

them  and  help  calm  down  the  angrier  ones.  This  task  could

include working the jobs of some of the orcs present for a couple

of days and would invariably involve mining iron.

Unapproachable EastWeb Enhancement

If the PCs have time to investigate the site of the meeting, they can

find the following information:

an exceptional greataxe hangs on the wall. The weapon is, in fact, a

+1 elfbane greataxe.

A Wilderness Lore check (DC 12) reveals that there was indeed

someone where the priest stood; it wasnt an image or an illusion.

The thing the priest dropped was a holy symbol of Gruumsh, and

apparently the orcs didnt pick it up.

A Wilderness Lore check (DC 15) around an area about 60 feet

from  the  priests  location  in  a  direction  that  none  of  the  other

orcs went reveals tracks that head out in the direction of the hills.

Any spellcaster who makes a Spellcraft check (DC 20) can hazard

a guess that the vanishing was in fact a gaseous form effect.

If the PCs wish, they can attempt to follow the tracks. If they dont

pick up this information, they may need to come to another meet-

ing and try again. (Go to Hot on the Trail if the PCs find the tracks

leading away.) If the PCs find these tracks later, adjust the DC of the

Wilderness Lore checks appropriately (see Track in Chapter 5 of the

Players Handbook).

Hot on the Trail

The tracks head due east through the hills and place the PCs in a

direct line of sight with the Thesk Mountains. The trail requires 5

hours  of  travel,  with  an  hourly  Wilderness  Lore  check  (DC  15).

Each of the first 3 hours has a different problem, as shown below:

Hour One: Two Heads Are Better Than One (EL 10) (H4)

The orc priest, knowing that he may be followed, has set up some

guards. These guards consist of beings he has bullied or persuaded to

aid him in his cause. The first is a group of ettins. Read the follow-

ing, adjusting for time of day as necessary:

The stars are a brilliant canopy overhead as you follow the trail

over  the  broken  terrain  of  the  Thesk  foothills.  The  dips  in  the

trail get steeper and rockier in turns, and you occasionally hear

the breeze through the grasses and trees of the foothills.

About 30 minutes away from the site of the meeting, six ettins lurk.

They have attempted to hide themselves in their cave off the path,

which is about 40 feet ahead and to the right of the PCs. The cave

has an uninterrupted line of sight to the path (putting the encounter

distance at 40 feet). However, the conditions of the night allow the

ettins a chance to hear the PCs before they come within line of sight,

so the ettins should make an opposed Listen check before the PCs

approach the initial encounter distance. After that, use the rules as

presented  in  the  DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for  determining  how

the encounter runs. The night is starlit with no moon, and the ettins

tend to remain still until they hear the PCs (if they hear them). (If

the PCs dont start tracking the priest immediately after the cere-

mony, adjust the visual conditions as necessary. There is also a 10%

chance that one of the ettins is out and about near the path instead

of in its cave.)

The ettins were swayed to the point of fanaticism by the cleric,

and  they  guard  the  pass  with  their  lives.  The  large  cave  serves  as

their  resting  point,  and  the  bones  of  many  orcs  litter  the  caves

floor. These are the remains of curious orcs who sought to follow the

cleric back to his starting point.

DDEttins (6): hp 70; see Monster Manual.

Tactics: The ettins are quite emphatic in their tactic about not

allowing  anyone  to  get  away,  and  they  especially  do  not  want

anyone following their cleric friend. As a result, they fight to the

death.

Treasure: The cleric doesnt permit the ettins to keep much. Any-

thing truly valuable goes to the priest and his cause. However, under

a rock in the cave lies 1,000 gp, a token of the clerics esteem. Also,

HOUR TWO: BIGGER PROBLEMS (EL 9)

As  the  tracks  continue  eastward,  the  terrain  gets  rockier  and  the

footing  becomes  more  difficult.  The  second  set  of  guards,  a  small

group of hill giants, is determined to succeed where the first group

failed.  Again,  the  giants  have  an  advantage  in  terms  of  knowing

when  the  PCs  are  coming  if  the  PCs  started  after  the  priest  right

after the ceremony. They not only have the higher ground (and a

better line of sight), but they are listening for the nightly followers.

(Theyve  had  much  fun  with  orcs  over  the  past  several  evenings.)

Read the following aloud, adjusting as necessary for vision concerns,

and so on:

As your group continues to doggedly follow the tracks, a boulder

crashes in front of younot blocking the path, but certainly get-

ting your attention. About 60 feet above you, to your right, is a

sheer cliff side, and on top of that cliff stand four huge forms.

Their laughing rumbles deeply in their throats, and they are about

to throw more rocks.

If the PCs come at another time, the giants are most likely slum-

bering in their own dwelling, which is another cave set back from

the  cliff  that  they  usually  set  up  ambushes  upon.  Sometimes  one

comes out to go hunting (10% chance of this happening when the

PCs near the area in their second hour of tracking). They do, how-

ever, keep one person on watch at all times.

Aside from climbing or magical means, there is no easy way to get

up the cliff. If the characters reversed direction, theyd find a small

path 5 minutes away that eventually winds its way to the cliff over-

looking  the  path.  They  can  stumble  upon  it  by  accident  as  they

wander, or a Wilderness Lore check (DC 15) allows the PC to see the

path before they pass it. Anyone attempting to climb the cliff must

make a Climb check (DC 12); the surface is fairly good for climbing.

A cave on top of the cliff is filled with boulders and also serves as

the shelter for the giants. Atop one rock shelf 20 feet high is a large

sack  with  600  gp,  which  is  the  clerics  pay  for  the  giants  loyalty.

There arent any orc remains here, but PCs can find some further

behind the cave if they care to look (Search check DC 15).

D Hill Giants (4): hp 90; see Monster Manual.

Tactics: The giants happily toss boulders down at the characters,

hopefully knocking any off the cliff who dare to attempt to climb

up.  Eventually,  if  they  think  they  have  the  advantage,  or  if  the

heroes are running off, the giants use their Jump skill to leap off the

cliff, land down below, and chase down the victims, engaging them

in melee.

HOUR THREE: THE TRUE COLORS

COME FORTH (EL 11)

The third obstacle should tip adventurers off as to what the true

nature  of  the  threat  is.  Read  the  following  aloud,  adjusting  as

necessary:

Still  eastward  you  march,  and  the  mountains  loom  closer  and

sharper.  The  terrain  is  rougher  now,  and  the  moon  casts  a  cold

pale light over everything, creating shadowy shapes everywhere.

A cold wind cuts through you, but its not just the cold air of a

night in the highlands; the air carries a scent of death and decay.

The  cleric  has  placed  a  mixture  of  banedead  and  baneguards  as

guards behind numerous rocks and talus piles. The clerics own tem-

porary base is about 2 hours ahead. (If the PCs are fresh and of a

higher level than 9th, you may want to place these undead 200 yards

be an early warning system for the cleric.)

then  blink  in  for  melee  attacks,  while  the  banedead  simply  wade

through the ranks of the heroes.

The Orc Cleric (EL 11) (H3)

The  group  finally  sees  what  theyre  up  against.  If  the  previous

encounter  fired  up  their  suspicions,  those  suspicions  will  be  con-

firmed here.

A big bonfire blazes in the center of a circular depression 90 feet

in diameter, and it has been cleared of most rocks and debris. The

borders of the depression are choked with debris; rocks, boulders,

deadfalls. A small wooden hut stands off to one side at the edge

of the circle farthest away from you. Between the hut and the fire

stands an orc cleric.

If the PCs allow the cleric to speak, they learn or see the following.

You can also allow some interaction with the cleric, but this is what

should result in the order it should occur:

You shouldnt have come, he says, and his voice is surprisingly

not  like  an  orcs  in  timbre.  In  fact,  its  a  rather  cultured  voice.

This was none of your business. You should have left well enough

alone and remained content with guarding caravans, exploring old

ruins,  then  drinking  a  few  ales.  He  sighs  and  shakes  his  head.

Now, its too late. You cant be allowed to return. You cant be

allowed to tell others what you see. You cannot be permitted to

interfere with the plans of Zhentil Keep.

7

The orc cleric doffs his headgear and his features twist and change

into a human male in his forties. His clothing changes to armor,

with a holy symbol of Bane displayed prominently.

Once the cleric reveals himself, four armored men peek out from

behind the debris, bows at the ready, and let fly with arrows.

Tactics: The fighters hit the group with arrows, though they first

attack clerics and spellcasters. Thules spells are used mostly to take

out individuals and finish each one off before moving onto the next

person.

If the battle goes badly, the fighters do their best to cover Thules

escape. The cleric is a good recurring villain and can use his scroll

and the word of recall spell on it to send himself back to Zhentil

Keep if matters go badly.

Concluding the Adventure

Although  the  group  may  have  halted  Thules  plans  for  now,  the

Zhents will not stop in their efforts to get the orcs rallied back to

their  cause.  The  Black  Network  has  agents  all  over  Thesk,  and

theyre just waiting for another chance to strike. For now, though,

if the PCs succeeded in stopping Thule, the orc community is unaf-

fected  by  the  events.  In  fact,  if  it  is  made  known  to  the  sergeant

exactly what happened, it will strengthen many of the orcs resolve

to live in peace with the humans and humanoids of Phent.

Unapproachable EastWeb Enhancement

If the PCs dont put a stop to the false prophet, here are some

suggestions for what happens next:

The  town  of  Phent  is  a  town  divided.  The  orcs  in  the  area  find

themselves with a bad case of infighting. Some of the younger orcs

want to follow the path that the false prophet claims is theirs, and

they start to do so by stealing things from outlying folk, causing

fights wherever they can, and making their own raids on caravans.

Those  who  wish  to  live  peacefully  with  the  folk  of  Phent  find

themselves forced to take up arms against their own kin. At the

same time, the humans and other folk who already feel a bit para-

noid about the orcs point to the raids and thefts and general call

to arms that these young orcs follow and cause problems in town,

making the already difficult situation even worse.

The Tarnished Blades find themselves with new recruits: humans

who want to put a stop to the orcs and gain a little extra money

at the same time. These bandits step up their predations on cara-

vans while they start to target those orcs that mine ore, claiming

that  killing  these  orcs  will  prevent  future  bloodshed  since  it

diminishes  the  forces  and  support  that  the  orcs  may  call  upon.

(They  also  appropriate  their  victims  belongings.)  The  leader  of

the  Tarnished  Blades,  while  angry  at  the  orc  bandits  who  have
