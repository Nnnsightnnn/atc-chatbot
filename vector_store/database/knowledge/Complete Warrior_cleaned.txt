Introduction

The  Complete  Warrior  book  is  a  rules  accessory  for  the

DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS  Roleplaying  Game.  It  is  primarily

a  player  resource  focusing  on  new  options  and  expanded

rules for D&D players who want to create or advance martial

characters. DMs can use this book as a resource for creating

or optimizing their own creations.

MARTIAL CHARACTERS

So  what  is  a  martial  character?  The  authors  of  this  book

de ne a martial character as any character that focuses his

or her development on improving his or her combat capabili-

ties, particularly those capabilities that emphasize melee or

ranged combat over spellcasting, skill use, or other abilities

common  to  a  D&D  character.  (For  brevity  in  some  places

throughout this book, including its title, martial

characters are referred to as warriors.

In  this  context,  warrior  does  not

refer  to  a  member  of  the  warrior

NPC class described in the Dun-

geon  Masters  Guidealthough

a  character  with  levels  in  that

class could be considered a martial

character  and  could  bene t  from

the material in this book just as any

other character might.)

Again, though, this doesnt mean

that  if  youre  playing  a  wizard  you

should  don  plate  armor  and  start

hefting  a  greatsword.  This  book

details  options  for  non- ghter-types

who  want  to  maximize  their  combat

effectiveness.  Spellcasting  warriors,

skill-using  soldiers,  and  holy  (or  unholy)

combatants of all types can  nd resources within these pages.

If youre playing a rogue whod like to improve her chances

to hit, or a sorcerer who might like to withstand a few more

points of damage, this book is for you.

THE COMPLETE WARRIOR

This book contains information for players and DMs, showcas-

ing new and interesting options for characters and creatures

utilizing the D&D combat rules. Players can read through the

entire book without hesitationDMs can use the material to

generate their own surprises without any help!

Classes (Chapter 1): This chapter introduces three new

character classes: the arcane hexblade, the honorable samu-

rai,  and  the  dexterous  swashbuckler.  Each  class  provides

an  alternative  for  players  interested  in  a  different  kind  of

 ghter.  And,  in  keeping  with  the  theme  of  alternatives,

this chapter concludes with some variant rules for existing

classes, including variant rangers and paladins.

Martial Prestige Classes (Chapter 2): A large number of

prestige classes are presented here, all with a focus on being

better in combat. Whether youre playing a  ghter, a wizard, a

cleric, or even some sort of strange monstrous character, you

should   nd  a  prestige  class  here  that

appeals to you.

Supplemental  Rules  (Chapter

3):  This  chapter  includes  compila-

tions of new feats and spells as well

as  some  other  rules  systems  you

might  not  expect  in  a  book  for

warrior-types.  Fighting  spellcasters

should  enjoy  the  section  on  guard-

ian  familiars,  and  the  chapter

also  discusses  new  uses  for  skills

such  as  Concentration,  Perform,  and

Knowledge.

Fantasy  Warfare  (Chapter  4):  A

book  for  martial  characters  wouldnt

be complete without a chapter on war-

fare.  We  look  at  historical  warfare  and

fantasy warfare with a more modern slant.

Here are suggestions and rules for war-oriented adventures

as  well  as  advice  on  running  a  wartime  campaign.  Players

should  nd the sections on magic items and warrior organi-

zations useful, and both DMs and players can use the section

on the warrior pantheon.

SOURCES

This  book  includes  material  from  other  sources,  including

Dragon  magazine,  web  articles  previously  published  on  the

Wizards of the Coast website, and earlier works like Sword and

Fist.  Much  of  this  material  has  been  picked  up  and  revised

based on feedback and comments from D&D players and DMs

all around the world. We hope you like the changes we made

to the prestige classes, feats, and other elements of the game

as well as the large amount of brand-new material youll  nd

in these pages.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Remember,  however,  that  DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS  is  your  game.

If youve been playing with a particular prestige class or feat that

weve picked up and revised, we hope youll look at the new version

and see why we made the changesbut you dont have to play with

the revised material if you dont want to. The Dungeon Master, as

always, should make the  nal call about what material belongs in

his or her game, and if youve been playing with an older version of

something that appears in this book and youre having fun doing it,

dont worry about making a change. We think all the changes weve

made are for the best, but its your game, after all.

he latest edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game

has  been  about  options  from  the  very  beginning.

The revised versions of the core rulebooks are recent

evidence  of  that,  as  is  this  book.  When  the  design-

ers began contemplating what a complete warrior book

should include, the idea of new classes came up.

Of  course,  prestige  classes  are  one  type  of  class  thats

gotten a lot of attention since the concept was introduced

in  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide.  However,  new  character

classes havent been given the same amount of exposure

in D&D accessories produced by Wizards of the Coast.

This  chapter  remedies  that  lack  of  attention  to  some

degree  with  the  presentation  of  three  new  character

classes  for  the  game.  Following  those  class  descriptions

are new variant versions of the paladin and ranger classes,

speci cally  designed  for  low-magic,  warrior-centered

campaigns and without the ability to cast spells.

HEXBLADE

Combining  the  dynamic  powers  of  martial  prowess  and

arcane might, the hexblade presents a deadly challenge to

opponents unused to such a foe.

Adventures:  Hexblades  adventure  for  personal  gain,

whether that gain is power, prestige, wealth, or all the above.

Characteristics:  The  hexblade  balances  talents  in

combat and arcane spellcasting. At lower levels, the hex-

blade  relies  on  melee  ability  augmented  by  his  special

power to curse his enemies. As he gains experience, he

becomes capable of casting a limited number of spells

while  his  curse  ability  becomes  more  potent  and  he

gains the ability to warp the normal laws of probability.

He can also draw upon the service of a familiar to fur-

ther augment his abilities.

Alignment:  The  style  of  the  hexblade  tends  to

be  sel sh,  sometimes  even  cruel,  though  it  is  by

no means limited to evil characters. Still, even the

friendliest  hexblade  is  at  best  neutral.  Hexblades

may  be  tyrannical  or  free-minded,  disciplined  or

creative, and thus have no particular bent toward

law or chaos.

Religion:  Most  hexblades  arent  very  pious,

relying  on  their  own  talents  rather  than  count-

ing on a deity to protect them. Those who revere

a deity often choose Wee Jas (deity of death and

magic) or Boccob the Uncaring (deity of magic).

Some  particularly  evil  hexblades  venerate  Nerull

(deity of death) or Vecna (deity of secrets).

Background: Like that of the sorcerer, the power

of the hexblade often displays itself at an early age,  5

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   5

9/12/03, 10:10:31 AM

frequently in the form of unexplained accidents or other inci-

dents of bad luck experienced by those around the budding

hexblade.  Though  the  hexblade  is  ultimately  a  self-taught

character, many receive rudimentary training from another

arcane spellcaster, such as an older hexblade, sorcerer, wizard,

or bard, before setting off on their own.

Unlike sorcerers, hexblades share a unique bond. Though

two  hexblades  who  meet  in  a  tavern  or  apothecary  wont

necessarily  strike  up  a  lasting  friendship,  it  is  rare  for  two

hexblades to oppose one another unless great personal gain

is on the line.

Races: As with sorcerers, most hexblades are humans or

half-elves. Those few gnomes who enjoy a cruel twist to their

levity may take up the tradition. Elves wishing to mix magic

and  warfare  more  often  become   ghter/wizards.  Dwarves

and  hal ings  rarely  exhibit  the  self-centered  behavior

common among hexblades.

Among the savage human oids, hexblades may be found as

leaders or advisors.

Other  Classes:  Hexblades  tend  to  get  along  best  with

other classes whose members look out for themselves before

others, including rogues, rangers, and barbarians. They avoid

paladins and other characters dedicated to the service of good

or other high-minded ideals. Hexblades sometimes feel jeal-

ous of the sorcerers superior arcane talents, and they shun

wizards as weak book-learners.

Role:  Though  a  capable  melee  combatant,  the  hexblade

relies on opportunistic use of his spells and special abilities

to augment this role in the group. A hexblade with the proper

skill selection can make a  ne leader for a group comfortable

with his style.

GAME RULE INFORMATION

Hexblades have the following game statistics.

Abilities: Charisma controls many of the hexblades spe-

cial powers, including his spellcasting. Strength is important

for him because of its role in combat. Dexterity and Constitu-

tion both contribute to the hexblades long-term survival.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills

The hexblades class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy

(Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession

(Wis), Ride (Dex), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 in the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modi er)  4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the hexblade.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Hexblades  are  pro-

 cient  with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,  and  with  light

armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components

required for hexblade spells are simple, a hexblade can cast hex-

blade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the

normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other

arcane spellcaster, a hexblade wearing medium or heavy armor

or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the

spell in question has a somatic component (and most do). A

multiclass hexblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure

chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.

Hexblades  Curse  (Su):  Once  per  day,  as  a  free  action,

a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe. The target must

be visible to the hexblade and within 60 feet. The target of

a hexblades curse takes a 2 penalty on attacks, saves, abil-

ity checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour

thereafter.  A  successful  Will  save  (DC  10  +  1/2  hexblades

class level + hexblades Cha modi er) negates the effect.

9/12/03, 10:10:48 AM

At every four levels beyond 1st (5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th)

a hexblade gains the ability to use his curse one additional

time per day, as indicated on Table 11. Multiple hexblades

curses dont stack, and any foe  that  successfully resists the

effect cannot be affected again by the same hexblades curse

for 24 hours.

Any effect that removes or dispels a curse eliminates the

effect of a hexblades curse.

Arcane Resistance (Su): At 2nd level, a hexblade gains

a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum +1) on

saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.

Mettle (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a hexblade

can  resist  magical  and  unusual  attacks  with  great

willpower or fortitude. If he makes a successful Will

or Fortitude save against an attack that normally

would  have  a  lesser  effect  on  a

successful save (such as any spell

with  a  saving  throw  entry  of  Will

half or Fortitude partial), he instead

completely  negates  the  effect.  An

unconscious  or  sleeping  hexblade

does not gain the bene t of mettle.

Familiar: Beginning at 4th level,

a  hexblade  can  obtain  a  familiar.

Doing so takes 24 hours and uses

up magical materials that cost 100

gp. A familiar is a magical beast

that  resembles  a  small

animal  and  is  unusu-

ally  tough  and  intelli-

gent. The creature serves as

a companion and servant.

The  hexblade  chooses  the

kind  of  familiar  he  gets.  As  the

hexblade  advances  in  level,  his

familiar  also  increases  in  power.  Treat

the hexblade as a sorcerer of three levels

lower  for  determining  the  familiars

powers and abilities (see the Familiars side-

bar on page 52 of the Players Handbook).

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the

hexblade,  the  latter  must  attempt a

DC  15  Fortitude  saving  throw.

Failure  means  he  loses  200  experience

points  per  hexblade  level;  success  reduces  the  loss

to  one-half  that  amount.  However,  a  hexblades

experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a

familiars demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar

cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be

raised from the dead just as a character can be, but it does not

lose a level or a point of Constitution when this happy event

occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar

may have only one familiar at a time.

Spells: Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade gains the ability

to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from

the hexblade spell list (see Chapter 3). He can cast any spell

he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer

can (see page 54 of the Players Handbook).

To learn or cast a spell, a hexblade must have a Charisma

score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level

spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Dif -

culty Class for a saving throw against a hexblades spell is 10

+ the spell level + the hexblades Cha modi er.

Like  other  spellcasters,  a  hexblade  can  cast  only  a

certain number of spells of each

spell level per day. His base daily

spell allotment is given on Table

11.  In  addition,  he  receives

bonus spells per day if he has

a  high  Charisma  score  (see

Table  11:  Ability  Modi ers

and  Bonus  Spells,  page  8  of

the  Players  Handbook).  When

Table  11  indicates  that  the

hexblade  gets  0  spells  per

day of a given spell level (for

instance,  1st-level  spells  for  a

4th-level  hexblade),  he  gains

only  the  bonus  spells  he  would

be  entitled  to  based  on  his  Cha-

risma score for that spell level.

The hexblades selection of spells

is  extremely  limited.  A  hexblade

begins  play  knowing  no  spells,  but

gains one or more new spells at certain

levels,  as  indicated  on  Table  12.

(Unlike spells per day, his

Charisma  score

does  not

affect the

number  of  spells  a  hexblade  knows;  the

numbers on Table 12 are  xed.)

Upon  reaching  12th  level,  and  at

every  third  hexblade  level

after  that  (15th  and

18th),  a  hexblade  can

choose  to  learn  a  new  spell  in  place  of  one  he

already knows. In effect, the hexblade loses the

old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spells

level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged,

and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level

hexblade  spell  the  hexblade  can  cast.  For  instance,  upon

reaching  12th  level,  a  hexblade  could  trade  in  a  single  1st-

level spell (two spell levels below the highest-level hexblade

spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell.

At 15th level, he could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level

spell (since he now can cast 4th-level hexblade spells) for a

different spell of the same level. A hexblade may swap only

a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or

not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells

known for the level.

Through 3rd level, a hexblade has no caster level. At 4th

level  and  higher,  his  caster  level  is  one-half  his  hexblade

level.

Ex-Hexblades

A  hexblade  who  becomes  good-aligned  loses  all  hexblade

spells  and  all  supernatural  class  abilities.  His  familiar

becomes a normal animal and leaves the hexblades service

as soon as possible. He may not progress any farther in levels

as  a  hexblade.  He  retains  all  the  other  bene ts  of  the  class

(weapon and armor pro ciencies and bonus feats).

Bonus Feat: At 5th level, and every  ve levels thereafter

(10th, 15th, and 20th), a hexblade gains a bonus feat, which

must  be  selected  from  the  following  list:  Combat  Cast-

ing,  Greater  Spell  Focus  (enchantment,  necromancy,  or

transmutation only), Greater Spell Penetration, Spell Focus

(enchantment,  necromancy,  or  transmutation  only),  Spell

Penetration.

Greater Hexblades Curse (Su): When a hexblade attains

7th level, the penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill

checks, and weapon damage rolls incurred by a target of the

hexblades curse becomes 4 instead of 2.

Aura  of  Unluck  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a  hexblade  of  12th

level or higher can create a baleful aura of misfortune. Any

melee or ranged attack made against the hexblade while this

aura of unluck is active has a 20% miss chance (similar to the

effect of concealment). Activating the aura is a free action,

and  the  aura  lasts  for  a  number  of  rounds  equal  to  3  +  the

hexblades Charisma bonus (if any).

At  16th  level  and  higher,  a  hexblade  can  use  his  aura  of

unluck twice per day. A 20th-level hexblade can activate this

aura three times per day.

Dire  Hexblades  Curse  (Su):  When  a  hexblade  attains

19th level, the penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill

checks, and weapon damage rolls incurred by a target of the

hexblades curse becomes 6 instead of 4.

SAMURAI

Known  for  their  matchless  bravery  and  strict  code  of

honor,  the  samurai  were  the  noble  soldiers  of  feudal

Japan. In a fantasy setting, the samurai brings that cour-

age  and  honor  to  the  service  of  a  lord,  general,  or  other

leader. The reputation of samurai for being tenacious in

combat  often  precedes  them  in  battle,  and  their  mere

presence is often enough to make dishonorable enemies

slink away in the darkness.

Adventures: Samurai undertake quests and other adven-

tures at the behest of their lord, who often uses mid- to high-

level samurai as troubleshooters. A samurai might be ordered

to defend a village beset by bandits, to lead allies in battle,

or to hunt down and duel a rival who has stained the lords

honor.

Characteristics: Wielding their signature katana (bastard

sword) and wakizashi (short sword) simultaneously, samurai

are as potent in melee as a  ghter, although they are less versa-

tile. Their adherence to the code of bushido is intimidating to

their foes, and the  xed stare of a samurai can unnerve most

opponents.

Alignment: Almost every aspect of a samurais life is ruled

by the code of bushido, which demands total obedience to

ones lord, bravery in the face of utmost peril, and honor and

respect  to  superiors,  peers,  and  lessers  alike.  Samurai  are

always lawful, stoic in demeanor, and implacable when mat-

ters of honor and justice are concerned.

Religion:  In  a  fantasy  world,  some  samurai  worship  no

deity,  instead  relying  on  the  code  of  bushido  for  guid-

ance  on  moral  and  ethical  issues.  Others  gravitate  to

the worship of deities of law, honor, and justice, such as

Heironeous and St. Cuthbert. Some evil samurai  nd the

tyrannical teachings of Hextor acceptable.

Background:  Samurai  are  traditionally  of

noble  birth,  although  folk  tales  are  replete

with samurai who were orphans adopted by

noble families or foot soldiers who showed

outstanding bravery in battle. Becoming a

samurai  means  untold  hours  learn-

ing  to  use  the  katana  and  waki-

zashi,  lessons  in  manners  and

etiquette, and relentless instruc-

tion in the tenets of bushido.

Races: The clan-based, lawful

society of the dwarves would make

a  good  match  for  samurai  culture.

Elves  long  lives  and  sense  of  history

could lead them down the samurais path.

Most hal ings wander too much to make

effective  samurai,  and  gnomes  show  no

particular  af nity  for  the  class.  Least

likely of all are half-orcs, who rarely

attain  a  high  enough  station  in

civilized  society  to  become

samurai.

Other  Classes:

Because  both  classes

live  their  lives  ac cording  to  a

code  of  behavior,  samurai  tend

to get along well with paladins,

although  samurai  are  sometimes

puzzled  when  paladins  ask,  Is

this  the  right  thing  to  do?  (A

typical samurais response might be You dishonor the lord

by questioning his orders.) Monks are likewise admired for

their strict training regimen and self-discipline. Samurai also

get along well with  ghters, especially if they have served in

an  army,  and  bards  whose  art  re ects  appropriate  themes.

Barbarians are tolerated with only a thin veneer of politeness,

as  are  rogues  who  focus  on  larceny  and  other  dishonorable

activities.

Role: With heavy armor and a razor-sharp blade in each

hand,  samurai  are  front-line  melee  combatants.  They  also

bene t from a series of abilities that give morale penalties to

their foes. In addition, because they are trained in matters of

etiquette, samurai make good negotiators and spokesmen.

GAME RULE INFORMATION

Samurai have the following game statistics.

Abilities:  Strength  is  of  paramount  importance  to  the

sword-wielding  samurai,  and  Dexterity  and  Constitution

help him survive in the midst of battle. Many of the samurais

other class features depend on Charismaa samurais force

of personality can make his enemies quake in fear.

Alignment: Any lawful.

Hit Die: d10.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Additional

Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the

samurai.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:  A

samurai is pro cient with all simple and mar-

tial weapons, and with all types of armor, but

not with shields.

Daisho  Proficiency  (Ex):  In  melee

combat,  a  samurai  favors  the  katana  (a  mas-

terwork  bastard  sword)  and  the  wakizashi  (a

masterwork short sword). Many samurai

receive  an  heirloom  set  of  these  two

blades, known as the daisho. Because

a samurai is trained in their use, he

gains Exotic Weapon Pro ciency

(bastard sword) as a bonus feat.

Two Swords as One (Ex): At 2nd

level, a samurai has learned to wield the katana and

wakizashi together. He is treated as having the Two-Weapon

Fighting feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if

he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat.

Kiai Smite (Ex): Once per day, a samurai of 3rd level or

higher  can  give  a  great  cry  during  combat  that  invigorates

him. When a sam urai shouts (a free action), his next attack

gains a bonus on the attack roll and the damage roll equal to

his Charisma bonus (minimum +1).

As a samurai gains levels, he can make a kiai smite more

often.

Iaijutsu Master (Ex): By 5th level, a samurai has become

adept  at  iaijutsu,  a   ghting  technique  that  concentrates  on

+6  Frightful presence

drawing his weapon and striking a foe in one  uid motion.

He is treated as having the Quick Draw feat, but only when

he draws his katana or wakizashi.

Staredown (Ex): At 6th level, a samurai becomes able to

strike fear into his foes by his mere presence. He gains a +4

bonus on Intimidate checks and can demoralize an opponent

(as described in the Intimidate skill description, page 76 of

the Players Handbook).

Improved Initiative (Ex): At 8th level, the samurai has

practiced  iaijutsu  techniques  used  in  ritual  duels  between

two  samurai,  and  he  is  able  to  anticipate  when  any  enemy

will attack. He now has the Improved Initiative feat.

Mass Staredown (Ex): At 10th level, a samurai has suf -

cient presence that he can cow multiple foes. Using a Intimi-

date check, the samurai can demoralize all opponents within

30 feet with a single standard action.

Improved  Two  Swords  as  One  (Ex):  At  11th  level,  a

samurais prowess with the katana and wakizashi improves.

He is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting

feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if he does

not meet the prerequisites for the feat.

Improved Staredown (Ex): At 14th level, even a glance

from  the  hard  eyes  of  a  samurai  is  enough  to  give  his  foes

pause. The samurai can demoralize opponents within 30 feet

as a move action, not a standard action.

Greater Two Swords as One(Ex): At 16th level,  ghting

with  a  katana  and  wakizashi  becomes  second  nature  for  a

samurai.  He  is  treated  as  having  the  Greater  Two-Weapon

Fighting feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if

he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A 20th-level samurais bravery,

honor, and  ghting prowess have become legendary. When

10

the samurai draws his blade, opponents within 30 feet must

succeed on a Will save (DC 20 + samurais Cha modi er) or

become panicked for 4d6 rounds (if they have 4 or fewer Hit

Dice) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if they have from 5 to 19 Hit

Dice). Creatures with 20 or more Hit Dice are not affected.

Any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected

again by the same samurais frightful presence for 24 hours.

Ex-Samurai

A samurai who ceases to be lawful or who commits an act of

grave dishonor loses all samurai class features that depend on

Charisma or Charisma-based checks. Minor embarrassments

dont count, but major breaks with the code of bushido do. Acts

that could lose a samurai his status include disobeying an order

from a superior of cer or feudal lord,  eeing in cowardice from

an important battle, being caught in a major lie or other breach

of integrity, and appallingly rude behavior. A disgraced char-

acter may not progress any farther as a samurai. He regains his

class features the ability to advance in the class if he atones for

his violations (see the atonement spell, page 201 of the Players

Handbook), assuming the feudal lord offers a chance at redemp-

tion. (Some feudal lords demand ritual suicide as the only act

that cleanses the stain of dishonor.)

Like a member of any other class, a samurai may be a multi-

class character, but multiclass samurai face a special restriction.

A samurai who gains a level in any class other than samurai

may never again raise his samurai level, though he retains all

his current samurai abilities. The way of the samurai demands

constant adherence to the code of bushido. Samurai may some-

times take levels in particular prestige classes without violat-

ing this code. The kensai and the knight protector (both in this

book) and the dwarven defender (in the Dungeon Masters Guide)

are three such examples. The Dungeon Master may designate

other prestige classes as available to a samurai.

Some disgraced samurai take levels in the ronin prestige

class (described in Chapter 2 of this book), which gives them

a chance to regain their lost class features.

SWASHBUCKLER

The swashbuckler embodies the concepts of daring and

panache. Favoring agility and wit over brute force, the

swashbuckler  excels  both  in  combat  situations  and

social interactions, making her a versatile character

indeed.

Adventures: Swashbucklers adventure for a variety

of  motivations,  based  on  their  alignment  and  back-

ground. Some seek to right injustices, while others seek

only fame and fortune. All swashbucklers, however,

share  a  tendency  to  leap  into  action  when  the  call

comes, regardless of their personal views.

Characteristics:  The  swashbuckler  combines

skill and  nesse with sheer combat prowess. Though

swashbucklers cant dish out quite as much damage

as a typical  ghter or barbarian, they tend to be more

agile and mobile than most melee combatants. When

she  can  pick  her  battles  carefully,  a  swashbuckler

becomes  a  very  deadly  opponent  (not  to  mention

hard  to  pin  down).  Swashbucklers  also  hold  their

own in social situations, unlike most  ghters.

Alignment:  Like  rogues,  swashbucklers  tend

to be diverse in their outlooks, and thus in their

alignments.  Those  who  chafe  under  societal

restrictions  tend  to  be  chaotic,  while  those

who  uphold  honorable  traditions  may  well  be

lawful.

Religion: Most swashbucklers pay at least some

small amount of homage to Olidammara (deity of

thieves),  since  that  deity  is  renowned  as  being

lucky.  Lawful  or  chivalrous  swashbuck-

lers  may  revere  Heironeous  (deity  of

valor)  or  even  St.  Cuthbert  (deity  of

retribution).  Swashbucklers  who

choose the open road over a  xed

residence  often  worship  Fharlanghn

(deity of roads).

Background:  Many  swashbucklers

come from af uent backgrounds, but anyone valu-

ing  nesse over force can become a swashbuckler,

regardless of background. A com mon shared element among

swashbucklers backgrounds is life in an urban environment,

whether the back alleys of a slum or the cultured halls of roy-

alty.

Swashbucklers  tend  to  see  other  swashbucklers  as  rivals

rather  than  allies,  even  when  sharing  similar  goals.  The

swashbucklers need for attention often outweighs her better

judgment,  leading  either  to  friendly  competition  or  even

outright distrust and antipathy.

Races:  Swashbucklers  are  most  often  humans,  elves,  or

half-elves.  Humans  and  half-elves  tend  to  have  the  daring

nature  required  of  a  swashbuckler,  and  the  natural  grace

of elves makes them well suited for the class. Hal ings and

gnomes often have the temperament to become a swashbuck-

ler, though their slower speed works against them. Dwarves

tend to prefer  ghting in heavy armor with big weapons, and

thus rarely become swashbucklers.

Among  the  savage  human oids,  swashbucklers  are

virtually unknown.

Other  Classes:  Swashbucklers  prefer  to  work

with  other  quick,  lightly  armored  characters.  They

get  along  best  with  rogues  and  bards,  and

appreciate the agility and combat talents of

the  monk  (though  chaotic  swashbucklers

may  chafe  at  the  monks  ascetic  nature).

Lawful good swashbucklers often share the

paladins  honorable  nature,  but  otherwise

the  classes  tend  to  clash  in  their  approach

to life. Swashbucklers have no particular dis-

taste for spellcasters, and they appreciate the

utility of a cleverly chosen, well-timed spell.

They dont interact with barbarians, druids,

or rangers very often, since these characters

tend to prefer natural settings to the typical

urban environment of the swashbuckler.

Role: The swashbuckler is an able melee

combatant, particularly when paired with

a  ghter or rogue. She can also make a  ne

party leader or spokesperson, thanks to her

access to Charisma-based skills.

GAME RULE

INFORMATION

Swashbucklers  have  the  following  game

statistics.

Abilities:  The  lightly  armored  swash-

buckler depends on a high Dexterity for her

Armor Class, as well as for many class skills.

High  Intelligence  and  Charisma  scores  are

also hallmarks of a successful swashbuckler.

Strength is not as important for a swashbuck-

ler as it is for other melee combatants.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the swashbuckler.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Swashbucklers are pro-

 cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light

armor.  Some  of  the  swashbucklers  class  features,  as  noted

below, rely on her being no more than lightly armored and

unencumbered.

Weapon  Finesse  (Ex):  A  swashbuckler  gains  Weapon

Finesse as a bonus feat at 1st level even if she does not qualify

for the feat.

Grace (Ex): A swashbuckler gains a +1 competence bonus

on Re ex saves at 2nd level. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th

level and to +3 at 20th level. A swashbuckler loses this bonus

when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a

medium or heavy load.

Insightful  Strike  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  a  swashbuckler

becomes  able  to  place  her   nesse  attacks  where  they  deal

greater damage. She applies her Intelligence bonus (if any)

as  a  bonus  on  damage  rolls  (in  addition  to  any  Strength

bonus she may have) with any light weapon, as well as any

other weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse, such

as a rapier, whip, or spiked chain. Targets immune to sneak

attacks  or  critical  hits  are  immune  to  the  swashbucklers

insightful  strike.  A  swashbuckler  cannot  use  this  ability

when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a

medium or heavy load.

Dodge  Bonus  (Ex):  A  swashbuckler  is  trained  at  focus-

ing  her  defenses  on  a  single  opponent  in  melee.  During

her action, she may designate an opponent and receive a +1

dodge bonus to Armor Class against melee attacks from that

12

opponent. She can select a new opponent on any action. This

bonus increases by +1 at every  ve levels after 5th (+2 at 10th

level, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th). A swashbuckler loses this

bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when car-

rying a medium or heavy load.

If the swashbuckler also has the Dodge feat, she need not

designate the same target for this ability as for the Dodge feat.

(If she designates the same target, the bonuses stack.)

Acrobatic  Charge  (Ex):  A  swashbuckler  of  7th  level

or  higher  can  charge  in  situations  where  others  cannot.

She  may  charge  over  dif cult  terrain  that  normally  slows

movement  or  allies  blocking  her  path.  This  ability  enables

her to run down steep stairs, leap down from a balcony, or

to tumble over tables to get to her target. Depending on the

circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks

(Jump or Tumble checks, in particular) to successfully move

over the terrain.

Improved  Flanking  (Ex):  A  swashbuckler  of  8th  level

or higher who is  anking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on

attacks  instead  of  a  +2  bonus  on  attacks.  (Other  characters

 anking  with  the  swashbuckler  dont  gain  this  increased

bonus.)

Lucky (Ex): Many swashbucklers live by the credo Better

lucky than good. Once per day, a swashbuckler of 11th level

or higher may reroll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability

check, or saving throw. The character must take the result of

the reroll, even if its worse than the original roll.

Acrobatic Skill Mastery (Ex): At 13th level, a swashbuck-

ler becomes so certain in the use of her acrobatic skills that

she  can  use  them  reliably  even  under  adverse  conditions.

When  making  a  Jump  or  Tumble  check,  a  swashbuckler

may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally

prevent her from doing so.

Weakening Critical (Ex): A swashbuckler of 14th level or

higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2

points of Strength damage to the creature. Creatures immune

to critical hits are immune to this effect.

Slippery Mind (Ex): When a swashbuckler reaches 17th

level,  her  mind  becomes  more  dif cult  to  control.  If  the

swashbuckler fails her save against an enchantment spell or

effect, she can attempt the save again 1 round later at the same

DC (assuming she is still alive). She gets only this one extra

chance to succeed at a certain saving throw.

Wounding  Critical  (Ex):  A  swashbuckler  of  19th  level

or  higher  who  scores  a  critical  hit  against  a  creature  also

deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the creature. (This

damage  is  in  addition  to  the  Strength  damage  dealt  by  the

swashbucklers  weakening  critical  class  feature.)  Creatures

immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.

Half-Elf Swashbuckler Starting Package

Armor: Studded leather (+3 AC, armor check penalty 1,

speed 30 ft., 20 lb.).

Weapons:  Rapier  (1d6,  crit  1820/2,  2  lb.,  one-handed,

restored), blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, dis-

eased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nause-

ated, sickened, stunned, or poisoned.

The  paladin  can  remove  adverse  conditions  at  the  same

time that she heals damage, but any points of healing spent

to end adverse conditions dont also cure hit point damage.

Holy Sword (Sp): At 16th level, a paladin gains the ability to

use holy sword once per day, as a caster whose level is equal to

one-half the paladins class level.

VARIANT RANGER

The variant ranger gains all the normal class features of the

ranger, with the following changes and additions.

Spells: The ranger does not gain the ability to cast divine

spells.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 6th level, the rangers base land

speed increases by 10 feet. This bene t applies only when he

is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not

carrying a heavy load.

Natures  Blessing  (Su):  At  11th  level  and  higher,  the

ranger  can  use  a  standard  action  to  add  a  +4  bonus  to  his

Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom score. This ability may

be used once per day, and its effect lasts for 1 minute per class

level.

Healing  Touch  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  a  ranger  of  13th  level

or  higher  can  use  either  neutralize  poison  or  remove  disease,

as a caster whose level is equal to one-half the rangers class

level.

Freedom of Movement (Sp): A ranger of 16th level or higher

can  use  freedom  of  movement  on  himself  once  per  day,  as

a  caster  whose  level  is  equal  to  one-half  the  rangers  class

level.

Dagger  (1d4,  crit  1920/2,  1  lb.,  light,  piercing  or  slash-

ing).

Shortbow (1d6, crit 3, range inc. 60 ft., 2 lb., piercing).

VARIANT:

PALADINS AND RANGERS

WITHOUT SPELLCASTING

The paladin and ranger in the Players Handbook are hybrid

classes, in that they combine martial talents with spellcast-

ing and other abilities. To make these classes  t better into

a warrior-focused campaign, consider using the following

variants that trade the classes spellcasting powers for other

extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. In gen-

eral,  these  variant  classes  give  up  the  versatility  of  daily

spell  selection  in  exchange  for  more  powerful  or  reliable

special abilities.

VARIANT PALADIN

This variant paladin gains all the normal class features of the

paladin, with the following changes and additions:

Spells: The paladin does not gain the ability to cast divine

spells.

Blessed Weapon (Su): Any melee weapon wielded by a

paladin of 6th level or higher is treated as good-aligned for

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Divine Might (Su): At 11th level and higher, the paladin

can use a standard action to add a +4 bonus to her Strength,

Wisdom, or Charisma score. This ability may be used once

per day, and its effect lasts for 1 minute per class level.

Tend to Mount (Su): A paladin of 13th level or higher

who uses her lay on hands ability to heal her mount cures

5 points of damage per point of healing spent. In addition,

the paladin may use her lay on hands ability to end any one

of the following adverse conditions affecting her mount, at

the cost of 5 points of healing per condition unless other-

wise noted: ability damage (costs 1 point per ability point

his  chapter  presents  a  host  of  prestige  classes

geared toward combat and martial themes. As

mentioned  throughout  this  book,  these  prestige

classes  arent  simply  for   ghtersor  even  just

members of the games martial classes ( ghters, paladins,

monks, rangers, and barbarians). Many of these classes

incorporate  aspects  of  other  classes  in  their  require-

ments  and  class  abilities,  and  more  than  a  few  should

appeal to characters of any class.

PICKING A

PRESTIGE CLASS

If youre looking for a prestige classeither for your

current player character or as an NPC for a campaign

youre  runningreview  the  descriptions  of  each

prestige  class  in  this  chapter  before  choosing  one.

Also review the prestige classs requirements. Many

of these prestige classes have high base attack bonus

requirements, or they require a number of combat-

oriented  feats  for  admission.  If  you  want  to  build

a  character  hoping  to  achieve  entry  in  one  of  these

classes, you have to plan.

You also need to decide what you would like to do

with your character. Since we have already narrowed

14

the focus of this book to combat-oriented prestige classes,

that narrows things down somewhat. What sort of combat

specialist do you want this character to be? Refer to Table

21 on the next page for some helpful suggestions. Terms

used on the table are de ned in the following text.

Good Guys/Bad Guys: Members of these groups de ne

themselves  by  their  alignment  and  their  outlook  on  the

world   rst,  their  other  abilities  second.  Their  strengths

re ect  their  alignment  choices,  and  roleplaying  one  of

these characters means putting attitude  rst. The cavalier,

justiciar, and kensai fall into both the good guy and bad

guy  categories,  because  the  alignment  requirement  for

those classes does not preclude such characters from being

either good or evil.

Melee: A character belonging to one of these prestige

classes is skilled at  ghting in close quarters. He or she

generally  has  a  good  amount  of  hit  points,  a  high  base

attack bonus, and often little or no restriction on armor

choices,  unless  the  character,  like  the  monk,  focuses  on

mobility rather than toe-to-toe  ghting.

Mounted: These characters prefer to ride into and out

of combat and often have abilities that improve the capa-

bilities of their mounts or other abilities related to riding.

Nemesis: When a character chooses to  ght a particular

kind of foe in preference to any other, that enemy becomes a

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   14

9/12/03, 10:14:00 AM

nemesis. These prestige classes heighten a characters existing

abilities, but at the expense of narrowing the characters focus.

Members of these classes are often very good at  ghting a par-

ticular kind of foe, but they lose some of their general utility.

Ranged:  Masters  of  archery,  thrown  weapons,  or  other

ranged  attacks  fall  into  this  category.  While  any   ghter

can  become  good  with  a  bow  or  javelin,  members  of  these

prestige  classes  gain  additional  bene ts,  sometimes  at  the

expense of other attributes. Ranged weapon users tend to be

less  concerned  with  Armor  Class  and  hit  points  and  more

focused  on  increasing  their  number  of  attacks,  precisions,

and damage per shot.

Spellcaster: Combat-oriented divine and arcane spellcast-

ers fall into this group, as well as members of classes that dont

actually cast spells, but instead have a considerable number

of spell-like abilities. Some are just dabblers, casting spells

from a small list or gaining a few spell-like abilities; a few are

hybrids that blend physical combat with mystic spells, and

a few others are pure spellcasters that give up very little in

spellcasting to pick up a few combat-ready abilities.

Terrain:  If  a  character  spends  most  or  all  of  his  adven-

turing time in a particular environment, a terrain-oriented

prestige class gives him an edge. The classs features focus on

improving the characters abilities in that terrain, but dont

help him much when he leaves that terrain behind.

Weapon  Specialist:  Members  of  these  prestige  classes

usually  pick  one  or  two  weapons  (or  sometimes  a  type  of

weapon, usually one considered suboptimal) to truly focus

their  efforts  on.  They  become  very  good  at  their  chosen

weapons  and  sometimes  gain  abilities  beyond  the  norm.

Sometimes this means sacri cing other abilities, but often it

simply means a sacri ce of  exibility.

THE MARTIAL

PRESTIGE CLASSES

These  classes  follow  the  format  presented  in  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide. Each class has a name and a descriptionboth

of which can be modi ed to suit your own campaign without

any serious impact to the class at all.

Most of these classes have combat-oriented requirements.

The fastest way into each of them usually involves picking up

one or more levels in the  ghter, paladin, ranger, barbarian, or

monk class. More than a few have requirements that can most

easily be met by dabbling in a few other classes, toorogue

levels  often  make  skill  requirements  easier  to  meet,  and

spellcasting  requirements  are  usually  met  by  picking  up  a

few levels in the wizard, sorcerer, druid, or cleric class.

If you choose to adjust the requirements for one of these

martial classes, do so carefully. Each class has been balanced

against projected levels of entry. The bear warrior, for exam-

ple, has a base attack bonus requirement of +7, meaning that

even the martial classes dont meet that requirement until at

least 7th level. This is because the bear warrior gains the abil-

ity to transform into a bear, an ability normally reserved for

high-level spellcasters and druids.

The  skill  points  gained  at  each  level  for  each  class  were

determined based primarily on the classs focus. A class whose

strengths lie in many special abilities, learned feats, or spell-

casting seldom has a high number of skill points. Those that

need more skills, such as the master thrower, who values mobil-

ity, or the dark hunter, who needs skills to track his quarry,

have more skill points per level. None of these classes are heavy

skill-users, however; their focus is, again, on combat.

When you review the class features for each prestige class,

note  that  they  all  use  either  the  best  or  near-best  attack

progression, but only a few have more than one good saving

throw  category.  This  is  another  balancing  factor.  Combat-

oriented  characters  need  to  be  able  to  hit  their  opponents

in  combat,  but  sometimes  a  good  offense  means  a  poorer

defense . . . at least as far as saving throws go. Since these are

prestige classes, however, its quite likely that your character

has  above-average  saving  throws  (after  multiclassing)  in  at

least two categories. Examine the requirements to determine

which  classes  your  character  has  to  invest  in  and  how  the

saving throws stack with each other.

Every  aspect  of  each  prestige  class  is  meant  to  balance

with every other. You should not only be able to  nd a few

prestige classes that appeal to you (as a player or as a DM),

but combinations that work extraordinarily well together or

in  conjunction  with  the  character  classes  from  the  Players

Handbook  or  Chapter  1  of  this  book.  The  combination  of

classes  that  quali es  you  for  a  prestige  class  at  the  lowest

possible character level is not always the most effective one,

though it is a place to start.

If youre interested in building your own martial prestige

classes, refer to the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Meeting Class Requirements: Its possible for a charac-

ter to take levels in a prestige class and later be in a position

where the character no longer quali es to be a member of the

class. An alignment change, levels lost because of character

death, or the loss of a magic item that granted an important

ability are examples of events that can make a character ineli-

gible to advance farther in a prestige class.

If  a  character  no  longer  meets  the  requirements  for  a

prestige class, he or she loses the bene t of any class features

or other special abilities granted by the class. The character

retains Hit Dice gained from advancing in the class as well as

any improvements to base attack bonus and base save bonuses

that the class provided.

BEAR WARRIOR

Many people, particularly those in uncivilized regions of

the world, revere bears as symbols of the warriors strength

and battle prowess. By adopting the bear as a totem anima,

warriors of these people hope to tap into some of the bears

strength.  Bear  warriors,  through  a  special  relationship

with  bear  spirits,  literally  adopt  a  bears  strength  in  the

rage of battle, actually transforming into bears while they

fight.

Only characters who can already tap into a spiritual power

of  rage  can  heighten  that  power  to  become  bear  warriors.

Most bear warriors are barbarians, but other multiclass char-

acters  sometimes  become  bear  warriors.  Characters  with

another  prestige  class  that  grants  a  rage  or  frenzy  ability

occasionally adopt this class.

NPC bear warriors are usually the champions of barbarian

tribes,  rustic  villages,  or  warlike  temples.  They  lead  other

warriors not through discipline and order, but by the inspir-

ing example they present.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify to become a bear warrior, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Feats: Power Attack.

Special: Rage or frenzy ability.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  bear  warrior

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Bear warriors gain no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Bear Form (Su): A bear warrior can transform into a bear

(similar to the polymorph spell) while in a rage or frenzy. His

only limit on the number of times per day he can assume a

bear form is the number of times per day he enters a rage or

frenzy, and the bear warrior returns to his own form once

the rage or frenzy ends. The bear warrior retains the normal

+2 bonus on Will saves and 2 penalty to Armor Class while

raging,  but  the  ability  score  bonuses  granted  by  rage  or

frenzy are replaced by Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution

bonuses appropriate to the bear form taken (see below). As

normal for polymorph, the bear warrior gains the bear forms

physical qualities (including size, movement, natural armor

bonus,  natural  weapons,  space,  and  reach),  as  well  as  any

ex tra ordinary  special  attacks  possessed  by  the  form  (such

as improved grab in the brown bear or dire bear form). The

transformation lasts for the duration of the rage or frenzy.

Unlike  with  the  polymorph  spell,  a  bear  warrior  doesnt

gain the bears Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores

when he takes bear form, nor does he regain any hit points

when he transforms. However, his current hit points increase

due to his new Constitution, as normal for a rage ability.

Any bear warrior can assume the form of a black bear once

per  day.  While  in  black  bear  form,  he  gains  a  +8  bonus  to

Strength, a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a +4 bonus to Constitu-

tion.

At 5th level, a bear warrior can assume bear form twice per

day  and  can  choose  between  black  and  brown  bear  forms.

While in brown bear form, he gains a +16 bonus to Strength,

a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a +8 bonus to Constitution.

A bear warrior

At 10th level, a

bear  warrior  can

assume bear form three

times per day and can choose

between black, brown, and dire bear forms. While in

dire bear form, he gains a +20 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus

to Dexterity, and a +8 bonus to Constitution.

Scent  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  a  bear  warrior  gains  the  scent

special ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual) while in

bear or nonbear form.

Rage +1/Day (Ex): When a bear warrior attains 7th level,

the number of times per day that he can enter a state of rage or

frenzy increases by one. For example, a 7th-level barbarian/

7th-level  bear  warrior  can  rage  three  times  per  day.  If  that

character  were  to  gain  one  more  barbarian  level,  he  could

rage four times per day.

BLADESINGER

Bladesingers  are  elves

who have blended art,

swordplay,  and  arcane

magic  into  a  harmonious

whole.  In  battle,  a  bladesingers

lithe movements and subtle tactics are beau-

tiful, belying their deadly martial ef ciency.

Multiclass  ghter/wizards are the most obvious candidates

for the prestige class, although any elf who can wield a mar-

tial weapon and cast arcane spells can become a bladesinger.

Bladesinger ranger/wizards, rogue/wizards, and even bards

are not unknown.

Bladesingers command great respect in most elf communi-

ties, and NPC bladesingers usually serve as itinerant guard-

ians and champions of the elf community at large.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a bladesinger, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Race: Elf or half-elf.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Balance 2 ranks, Concentration 4 ranks, Perform

(dance) 2 ranks, Perform (sing) 2 ranks, Tumble 2 ranks.

Feats: Combat Casting, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Weapon

Focus (longsword or rapier).

Spells: Able to cast arcane spells of 1st level.

Class Skills

The  bladesingers  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Concentration  (Con),  Jump  (Str),

Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Perform  (Cha),  Spellcraft  (Int),

and Tumble (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of

the bladesinger prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency:

Bladesingers  gain  no  proficiency

with  any  weapon.  They  gain  pro-

 ciency  with  light  armor  but  not

with shields.

Spells  per  Day:  At  every  odd-

numbered  level  gained  in  the

bladesinger class, the character

gains new spells per day as if

she  had  also  gained  a  level

in  an  arcane  spellcast-

ing  class  she  belonged  to

before  adding  the  prestige

class. She does not, however, gain

any  other  bene t  a  character  of

that class would have gained, except

for  an  increased  effective  level  of

spellcasting.  If  a  character  had  more

than  one  arcane  spellcasting  class

be fore  becoming  a  blade-

singer, she must decide to

which class she adds the

new level for purposes of determin-

ing spells per day.

Bladesong Style (Ex): When wielding a

longsword  or  rapier  in  one  hand  (and  nothing  in  the

other), a bladesinger gains a dodge bonus to Armor Class

equal to his class level, up to a maximum of her Intelli-

gence bonus. If the bladesinger wears medium or heavy

armor, she loses all bene ts of the bladesong style.

Lesser Spellsong (Ex): When wielding a longsword

or rapier in one hand (and nothing in the other), a blade-

singer of 2nd level or higher can take 10 when making a

Concentration check to cast defensively.

Song of Celerity (Ex): Once per day, a bladesinger of 4th

level or higher may quicken a single spell of up to 2nd level, as

if she had used the Quicken Spell feat, but without any adjust-

ment  to  the  spells  effective  level  or  casting  time.  She  may

Table 23: The Bladesinger

Fort

Ref  Will

A bladesinger

only use this ability when wielding a longsword or rapier in

one hand (and nothing in the other). At 8th level and higher,

she can quicken a single

spell of up to 4th level.

Greater  Spellsong

(Ex): A bladesinger of 6th level

or higher ignores arcane spell fail-

ure chances when wearing light armor.

Song  of  Fury  (Ex):  When  a  10th-level

bladesinger  makes  a  full  attack  with  a  long-

sword or rapier in one hand (and nothing in

the  other),  she  can  make  one  extra  attack  in

a round at her highest base attack bonus, but

this  attack  and  each  other  attack  made  in

that  round  take  a  2  penalty.  This  penalty

applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks

of opportunity the bladesinger might make

before her next action.

CAVALIER

Representing the ultimate in mounted warfare, the cavalier

is the quintessential knight in shining armor. The charge of

the cavalier is among the most devastating offensive weapons

any culture can hope to  eld.

Most cavaliers belong to the upper social class or nobility of a

society. The cavalier dedicates his life to the service of a higher

authority, such as a noble or sovereign, deity, military or religious

order, or a special cause. His is a hereditary honor that comes

with  the  price  of  lifelong  service  to  his  monarch,  country,  or

other object or entity. The cavalier is expected to participate in

any wars or other armed con ict in which his lord or cause is

engaged. Cavaliers in service to other nobles often serve their

master beyond the battle eld as well, performing such duties as

their skills, and their noble lord, see  t.

The  cavalier  often  pursues  such  sel ess  goals

as the eradication of evil and chaos from

the world, and justice for all the subjects

of his land. He can also be a bully and a

braggart who uses his status

and  privileges  to  pursue

only his own self-aggran-

dizement.

Hit Die: d10.

+4  on  checks  to  notice  unusual  stonework,  such  as  sliding

walls, stonework traps, new construction, unsafe stone sur-

faces,  shaky  stone  ceilings,  and  the  like.  This  bonus  also

applies on Search checks made to detect stonework traps.

Enhanced  Darkvision  (Ex):  Dark  hunters  spend  most

of their lives in the darkest caverns they can  nd. As a dark

hunters skills improve, her almost mystical understanding of

the deep caverns sharpens her inborn visual acuity. If a dark

hunter does not already have darkvision when she attains 2nd

level, she gains it at a range of 30 feet. If she already had darkvi-

sion, she adds 30 feet to the range. Once a dark hunter attains

4th level, her darkvision range increases by an extra 30 feet.

This bonus stacks with other natural or extraordinary abili-

ties that improve darkvision, but it does nothing to improve

magically granted darkvision.

Any condition that causes the character to lose her normal

darkvision also causes the enhanced darkvision to fail.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If a dark hunter can catch an oppo-

nent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her

attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time

the dark hunters target would be denied his Dexterity bonus

to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or

not),  the  dark  hunters  attack  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of

damage. Should a dark hunter score a critical hit with a sneak

attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

It  takes  precision  and  penetration  to  hit  a  vital  spot,  so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

within 30 feet.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dark hunter can make

a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal

damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to

deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the

usual 4 penalty,  because she must make optimal use of her

weapon in order to execute the sneak attack.

A dark hunter can only sneak attack living creatures with

discernible  anatomiesundead,  constructs,  oozes,  plants,

and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any crea-

ture that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak

attacks. The dark hunter must be able to see the target well

enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such

a spot. A dark hunter cannot sneak attack while striking a

creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature

whose vitals are beyond reach.

If  a  dark  hunter  gets  a  sneak  attack  bonus  from  another

source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.

Stones Hue (Su): When within 5 feet of a stone or earth

wall, a dark hunter can take on the coloration of the stone

and may seem to blend into the surface of the wall. As long

as the dark hunter is within 5 feet of the wall, she gains a +10

circumstance  bonus  on  Hide  checks  and  can  successfully

hide herself from view in the open without having anything

to actually hide behind.

Death Attack (Ex): If a dark hunter studies her victim for

3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon

that  successfully  deals  damage,  the  sneak  attack  has  the

additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the

target (dark hunters choice). While studying the target, the

dark hunter can undertake other actions as long as her atten-

tion stays focused on the target and the target does not detect

the dark hunter or recognize the dark hunter as an enemy. If

the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

the dark hunters class level + the dark hunters Int modi er)

against the kill effect, he dies. If the saving throw fails against

the paralysis effect, the victims mind and body become ener-

vated, rendering him helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds

plus 1 round per level of the dark hunter. If the victims saving

throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once

the dark hunter has completed the 3 rounds of study, she must

make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death

attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if

the dark hunter does not launch the attack within 3 rounds

of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required

before she can attempt another death attack.

Class Features

All of the following are class

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro-

  ciency: Darkwood stalk ers

gain no pro  ciency with any

weap on or armor.

A darkwood stalker

Elves  and  orcs

are  ancient  foes,

their  enmity  dating  back

to  times  before  humans  walked  the

land.  Some  elves  train  as  elite  hunters

of  the  hated  orcs.  These  hunters,  called

darkwood stalkers among the elves, pursue

their age-old enemies with grim determination.

Darkwood stalkers usually come from the ranks of elf (or

half-elf)  rangers  or  rogues,  although  the  rare  elf  barbarian

can follow this path as well. Fighters and paladins make poor

darkwood stalkers without gaining at least one level in ranger

or rogue. Spellcasters rarely take up the mantle of the dark-

wood stalker, although druids willing to forego spellcasting

can  t well into the order.

Most darkwood stalkers are af liated with elven military

units, although some are lone scouts or  eld agents.

Hit Die: d8.

Ancient Foe (Ex):

Due to his extensive

study  of  orcs  and

training  in  the

proper techniques for combating them, a

darkwood stalker gains a +2 bonus on Bluff,

Listen,  Sense  Motive,  Spot,  and  Survival

checks when using these skills against orcs.

He  gets  the  same  bonus  on  weapon  damage  rolls  against

these  creatures.  A  darkwood  stalker  also  gets  the  bonus

on damage with ranged weapons, but only against targets

within  30  feet  (the  darkwood  stalker  cannot  strike  with

deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus on damage

does not apply against creatures that are im mune to criti-

cal hits. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the darkwood stalkers

bonus goes up by +2.

This  bonus  stacks  with  a  favored  enemy  bonus  (if  any)

acquired through ranger levels.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a darkwood

stalker gains the ability to react to danger before his senses

would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexter-

ity bonus to Armor Class (if any) regardless of being caught

 at-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. He still loses his

Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

If  a  darkwood  stalker  already  had  the  uncanny  dodge

ability from another class, the character automatically gains

improved uncanny dodge instead.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  If  a  darkwood  stalker  can  catch  an

opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from

his attack, he can strike a vital spot for an extra 1d6 points of

damage. For complete details on the sneak attack ability, see

the description of the dark hunter earlier in this chapter.

Darkvision  (Ex):  Although  stealthy  and  keen-eyed,  the

darkwood stalker is often at a disadvantage against orcs when

 ghting in the darkness. Long ago, elven sages developed a

ritual to allow the most dedicated stalkers to overcome this

disadvantage. Now, as they grow in experience, their night

vision continually improves, eventually matching the darkvi-

sion of their hated foes. At 4th level, a darkwood stalker gains

darkvision out to 30 feet, and at 7th level, the range increases

to 60 feet. If the darkwood stalker already has darkvision as a

racial ability, this ability does not increase it.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level and higher,

a darkwood stalker can no longer be   anked, since he can

react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he

can react to a single attacker. This defense denies other char-

acters the ability to use  ank attacks to sneak attack him. The

exception to this defense is that a rogue of at least four levels

higher  than  the  character  can   ank  him  (and  thus  sneak

attack him).

If a darkwood stalker gains the uncanny dodge ability from

another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny

dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required

to  ank the character.

Dodge  Critical  (Ex):  Although  often  more  skilled  than

their orc foes, darkwood stalkers have seen too many battles

won by one lucky blow from a falchion. At 8th level, a dark-

wood stalker becomes able to turn even the luckiest blow into

24

a grazing strike. Once per day, a darkwood stalker can make a

Re ex saving throw (DC 20 + the enhancement bonus, if any,

possessed by the weapon) to turn a critical hit dealt upon him

into a normal hit. The darkwood stalker must be aware of the

attack and not  at-footed, and he must declare his attempt to

reduce the effect of the critical hit before the damage from

the hit is rolled.

Death  Attack  (Ex):  If  a  10th-level  darkwood  stalker

studies a particular orc for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak

attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage,

the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing

the target. While studying the orc, the darkwood hunter can

undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused

on  the  target  and  the  target  does  not  detect  the  darkwood

stalker  or  recognize  the  darkwood  stalker  as  an  enemy.  If

the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

the  darkwood  stalkers  class  level  +  the  darkwood  stalkers

Wis modi er), he dies. If the victims saving throw succeeds,

the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the darkwood

stalker has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make

the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack

is  attempted  and  fails  (the  victim  makes  his  save)  or  if  the

darkwood stalker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds

of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required

before he can attempt another death attack.

damage rolls against orcs. (These bonuses include the favored

enemy bonus from the characters ranger levels.)

requisites.

Dodge Critical (Ex): Once per day Nexal can attempt a

Re ex save (DC 20 + weapons enhancement bonus) to turn a

critical hit into a normal hit.

these  skills  against  dragons.  He  gets  the

same  bonus  on  weapon  damage  rolls

against dragons. (His +4 bonus against

orcs is accounted for in his ancient

foe ability; see above.)

the  ability  to  distinguish  color  and  detail  under  these

conditions.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Nexal can react to danger before

his  senses  would  normally  allow  him  to  do  so.  He  retains

his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when caught  at-

footed.

Wild  Empathy  (Ex):  Nexal  can  improve  the  attitude  of

an animal in the same way a Diplomacy check can improve

the attitude of a sentient being. He rolls 1d20+4, or 1d201 if

attempting to in uence a magical beast with an Intelligence

score of 1 or 2.

bracers of archery, masterwork longsword, 20 arrows.

DERVISH

Wild, exotic, and as dangerous as her whirling blades, the der-

vish epitomizes speed, quickness, and abandon. Her motions

appear to be as random as they are graceful, but the steps of

her lethal dance play out according to their own rhythm.

Nearly  all  dervishes  belong  to  nomadic  cultures.  These

nomads are not simple wanderers with no roots to call their

ownthey have their ancient traditions, and their societies

simply do not consider permanent settlements an important

part  of  their  nature.  They  are  gypsies,  keeping  their  own

traditions and forging their own familial and societal bonds

while  they  move  throughout  the  world.  Often,  these

tribes  adopt  the  attitudes  and

even some of the laws

of  the  lands  they

live  infor  the

sake  of  expedi-

ence, if nothing

else.  The  der-

vish treats  ght-

ing  styles  the

same  way.  A

dervish  learns

the  dance  of

war  as  she

grows up among

her  family  and

her  tribe.  She  watches

others as she travels, however,

and  brings  new  steps  to  the

dance as she goes.

Fighters,  rangers,  and  monks

often take up the role of the dervish.

Many paladins look at the wildness of

the dance and assume it has some roots

in  chaos,  but  those  who  look  past  the

seeming  randomness  can   nd  things  to

learn. Barbarians seldom choose to learn the

ways of the dancethe dervish depends on

subtlety more than brute force. The way of

the dervish has been known to appeal to some

druids, bards, and even sorcerersthose who wish to learn

a type of  ghting that does not rely on heavy arms or armor

 nd the class interesting.

Hal ings  and  elves  make  good  dervishes,  and  many

nomadic  hal ing  tribes  have  dervishes  as  their  primary

protectors.

NPC dervishes seldom wander without their tribes. They

can be sent on missions, or serve as scouts in new lands, but

the dervish is too important to the tribal unit to go off on her

own for extended periods of time. Some dervishes balk at this

responsibility,  however,  so  exceptions  to  this  rule  do  show

up occasionally. A dervish found wandering alone is usually

seeking new challenges and new knowledge.

Class Skills

The dervishs class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Balance  (Dex),  Craft  (Int),  Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Jump

(Str),  Listen  (Wis),  Perform  (Cha),  Profession  (Wis),  Swim

(Str), and Tumble (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the dervish prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Dervishes  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

AC  Bonus  (Ex):  A  dervish  gains  this  bonus  to  Armor

Class as long as she is wearing no armor or light armor and

not carrying a shield. This bonus to AC applies even against

touch attacks or when the dervish is  at-footed. She loses this

bonus when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears

any armor heavier than light, when she carries a shield, or

when she carries a medium or heavy load.

Dervish  Dance  (Ex):  A  dervish  can  become  a  whirling

dancer of death a certain number of times per day. While in

this dervish dance, she can take a full attack action (for melee

attacks  only)  and  still  move  up  to  her  speed.  However,  the

dervish must move a minimum of 5 feet between each attack

when using this ability, and she cannot return to a square she

just exited (though she may return to that square later during

her full attack). The dervish is subject to attacks of opportu-

nity while dancing, but may tumble normally as part of her

move. A dervish prevented from completing her move is also

prevented from  nishing her full attack.

If a dervish wields a slashing weapon while in a dervish

dance, she gains a bonus on her attack and damage rolls. This

bonus is +1 at 1st level, and it increases by an extra +1 at every

odd-numbered level thereafter.

A dervish may only perform a dervish dance while wield-

ing  a  slashing  weapon  (she  may  use  a  double  weapon,  or

multiple  weapons,  only  if  both  ends  of  the  weapon  or  all

weapons  are  of  the  slashing  type).  She  cannot  perform  a

dervish  dance  in  any  armor  heavier  than  light  or  if  she  is

using a shield. While dancing, a dervish cannot use skills or

abilities that involve concentration or require her to remain

still, such as Move Silently, Hide, or Search. A dervish with

the bardic music ability can, however, sing while she dances,

and a dervish can also use the Combat Expertise feat while

in a dance. A dervish cannot perform a dervish dance while

under the effect of a rage or frenzy ability.

A  dervish  can  perform  a  dervish  dance  only  once  per

encounter. A dervish dance lasts 1 round for every two ranks

of Perform (dance) that the character has. At the end of a der-

vish dance, the character becomes fatigued for the duration

of the encounter (unless she is a 9th-level dervish, at which

point this limitation no longer applies).

Movement Mastery (Ex): A dervish is so certain of her

movements  that  she  is  unaffected  by  adverse  conditions.

When  making  a  Jump,  Perform  (dance),  or  Tumble  check,

she may take 10 even if stress and distraction would normally

prevent her from doing so.

Slashing Blades: A dervish treats the scimitar as a light

weapon (rather than a one-handed weapon) for all purposes,

including  ghting with two weapons.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a dervish

gains an enhancement bonus to her speed. A dervish in any

armor heavier than light or carrying a medium or heavy load

loses this bonus.

Spring  Attack:  At  3rd  level,  a  dervish  gains  the  Spring

Attack feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

Dance of Death: At 4th level, a dervish gains the bene t

of the Cleave feat while performing a dervish dance, even if

she does not meet the prerequisites for the feat. She does not

have to move 5 feet before making the extra attack granted

by this ability.

Improved Reaction (Ex): When she attains 6th level, a

dervish gains a +2 bonus on initiative rolls.

Elaborate  Parry  (Ex):  When  she  attains  7th  level,  a

dervish  gains  an  extra  +4  bonus  to  Armor  Class  when  she

chooses to  ght defensively or use all-out defense in melee

combat.

Tireless  Dance:  When  a  dervish  reaches  9th  level,  the

character no longer becomes fatigued for the duration of the

encounter at the end of a dervish dance.

A Thousand Cuts (Ex): When a dervish reaches 10th level,

once per day she may double the number of melee attacks she

makes  while  performing  a  full  attack  action  (whether  in  a

dervish dance or not). If a dervish uses this ability in conjunc-

tion with her dervish dance, she can make up to two attacks

between moves.

The dervish also gains the bene t of the Great Cleave feat

with  slashing  weapons  while  performing  a  thousand  cuts,

even  if  she  does  not  meet  the  prerequisites.  She  does  not

have to move 5 feet before making any extra attacks granted

by this ability.

A  dervish  using  this  ability  can  receive  an  extra  attack

from the haste spell, but the bonuses provided by the spell do

not stack with the bonuses granted by the class.

DRUNKEN MASTER

Martial arts students face a bewildering array of martial arts

schools,  each  with  its  own  adherents  and  detractors.  How-

ever,  few  schools  are  as  unusualor  as  controversialas

drunken boxing. By weaving and staggering about as if ine-

briated, drunken boxers avoid many blows. Likewise, their

stumbling, lurching attacks catch their opponents off guard.

Moreover,  when  they  actually  imbibe  alcohol,  drunken

masters can perform truly prodigious feats of strength and

bravery.

This ability garners a drunken master little respect among

adherents  of  other  martial  arts  schools,  because  drunken

boxing  exacts  a  toll  on  its  users.  Drunken  masters  may

remain intoxicated for hours after a  ght, and they are often

found  half-asleep  in  taverns,  mumbling  incoherently.  This

 ies in the face of other schools ascetic principles. Members

of rival schools must be warythey never know when the

tipsy lout at the bar is just a harmless thug, and when he is a

nigh-unstoppable drunken master.

Monks form the backbone of the drunken boxing school.

A monk loses some face with his original school or monas-

tery for becoming a drunken master, but a brilliant display

of  drunken   ghting  can  sometimes  silence  critics  in  ones

former  school.  Members  of  other  classes  become  drunken

masters  only  rarely,  although  students  often  tell  the  tale

of  a  barbarian  from  the  north  who  became  a  phenomenal

drunken master.

Prospective  students  are  studied  at  a  distance  by  other

drunken masters, then treated to a display of the power of

drunken  boxing.  If  the  student  expresses  enthusiasm  for

learning  the  new  techniques,  a  group  of  drunken  masters

takes him or her from tavern to tavern, getting rip-roaring

drunk, causing trouble, and passing along the  rst secrets of

the technique. Those who survive the revelry are welcomed

as new drunken masters.

NPC drunken masters are often found in taverns and bars.

They rarely pick  ghts there, but are quick to come to the aid

of someone overmatched in a tavern brawl. Most keep a low

pro le,  although  some  are  famousor  infamousfor  the

deeds they have performed while under the in uence.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the drunken master

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Drunken masters gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Drink  Like  a  Demon  (Ex):  A  drunken  masters  body

handles alcohol differently from other peoples. He can drink

a  large  tankard  of  ale,  a  bottle  of  wine,  or  a  corresponding

amount of stronger alcohol as a move action. Every bottle or

tankard of alcohol he consumes during combat reduces his

Wisdom and Intelligence by 2 points each, but increases his

Strength or Constitution (characters choice) by 2 points. A

drunken master may bene t from a number of drinks equal

to his class level. The duration of both the penalty and the

bonus is a number of rounds equal to the characters drunken

master level + 3.

Improvised Weapons (Ex): While bottles and tankards

are  a  drunken  masters  preferred  improvised  weapons,  he

can use furniture, farm implements, or nearly anything else

at  hand  to  attack  his  foes.  A  drunken  masters  improvised

weapon deals as much damage as his unarmed strike plus an

extra 1d4 points. Most improvised weapons deal bludgeoning

28

damage, although some (a broken glass bottle, for example)

would  deal  piercing  or  slashing  damage.  When  a  drunken

master  rolls  a  natural  1  on  an  attack  roll  while  using  an

improvised weapon, that weapon breaks apart and becomes

useless.

Stagger  (Ex):  By  tripping,  stumbling,  and  staggering,  a

drunken  master  of  2nd  level  or  higher  can  make  a  charge

attack  that  surprises  his  opponents.  This  ability  has  two

bene cial aspects: First, the charge need not be in a straight

line, even though the character can still move up to twice his

speed. Second, if a drunken master makes a DC 15 Tumble

check  before  beginning  a  charge,  his  movement  through

threatened squares provokes no attacks of opportunity.

Swaying  Waist  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  a  drunken  master

knows how to weave and bob during an attack, making him

more dif cult to hit. The character gains a +2 dodge bonus to

Armor Class against any one opponent he chooses during his

turn.

AC Bonus (Ex): At 4th level, a drunken master gains a +1

bonus to Armor Class. This bonus improves to +2 at 9th level.

Improved Improvised Weapons (Ex): A drunken master

of 4th level or higher can use long improvised weapons (such

as ladders) as reach weapons according to their length, and

improvised weapons with many protrusions (such as chairs)

provide a +2 bonus on opponents disarm attempts. Finally,

large objects with broad,  at surfaces (such as tables) can be

upended to become improvised tower shields.

Greater  Improvised  Weapons  (Ex):  At  5th  level  and

higher,  a  drunken  master  wielding  an  improvised  weapon

deals an extra 1d8 points of damage instead of 1d4.

Improved Feint (Ex): A drunken master who attains 6th

level gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat even if he does not

meet the prerequisites.

Improved Grapple (Ex): A drunken master who attains

7th level gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat even if he

does not meet the prerequisites.

For Medicinal Purposes (Sp): At 8th level, a drunken master

gains the ability to convert a single alcoholic drink he has

ingested into a single potion of cure moderate wounds, as if he

had just drunk a dose of the potion. To use this ability, the

character must be under the effect of an alcoholic drink (see

Drink Like a Demon, above). When he converts one drink of

alcohol into one dose of the potion, his ability scores change

(+2 to Intelligence and Wisdom, 2 to Strength or Constitu-

tion) as if the duration of the alcohols effect had expired. This

ability can be used up to three times per day. It is a standard

action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Corkscrew  Rush  (Ex):  A  drunken  master  of  9th  level

or higher can perform this maneuver, leaping forward and

twisting his body in midair as he attempts to head-butt an

opponent. When making a charge attack he can, in addition

to dealing normal damage, initiate a bull rush (without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity). If the bull rush attempt

succeeds,  the  opponent  is  stunned  unless  she  makes  a

Will save (DC 10 + the drunken masters class level + the

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   28

9/12/03, 10:22:28 AM

drunken masters Wis modi er). However, if the bull rush

attempt  fails,  the  drunken  master  lands  prone  in  front  of

the opponent.

Superior  Improvised  Weapons  (Ex):  At  9th  level  and

higher,  a  drunken  master  wielding  an  improvised  weapon

deals an extra 1d12 points of damage instead of 1d8.

Breath  of  Flame  (Sp):  A  10th-level  drunken  master  can

ignite some of the alcohol within his body and spew it forth

from his mouth as a free action. This breath of  ame deals

3d12 points of  re damage to all within the 20-foot cone, or

half damage to those who make a Re ex save (DC 10 + the

drunken masters class level + the drunken masters Con

modi er). Each time a drunken master uses breath of

 ame,  it  consumes  one  drinks  worth  of  alco-

hol  from  within  his  body,  lessening  the

penalty  to  his  Wisdom  and  Intelligence

scores  and  reducing  the  bonus  to  his

Strength or Constitution score (characters

choice).

Multiclass  Note:  A  monk  who  becomes  a

drunken master may continue advancing as a

monk.

Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (unarmed strike),

Improved Feint, Improved Grapple, Mobility, Spring Attack,

Stunning Fist, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike).

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Kirin may use a full attack action

to make one extra attack per round with an unarmed strike

or a spe cial monk weapon at his highest base attack bonus,

but this attack and each other attack made in that round take

a  1  penalty  apiece.  This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it

affects  attacks  of  opportunity  Kirin  might  make  before  his

next action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham,

Kirin can make the extra attack either with that weapon or

unarmed. If armed with two such weapons, he uses one for

his regular attack(s) and the other

for  the  extra  attack.  In  any

case, his damage bonus on the

attack with his off hand

is not reduced.

Ki  Strike  (Su):

Kirins unarmed strike

can  deal  damage  to  a

creature  with  damage

reduction  as  if  the

blow  were  made  with

a magic weapon.

Drink  Like

a

Demon  (Ex):  Each  drink

Kirin  takes  during  combat

reduces  his  Wisdom  and

Intelligence  by  2  points

but  increases  either  his

Strength or his Con-

stitution  by  2  points

for 11 rounds.

Evasion  (Ex):  If

Kirin  is  exposed  to

any  effect  that  nor-

mally allows him to

attempt  a  Re ex

saving  throw

for half dam-

age,  he

takes  no

damage  with  a  successful

A drunken master

saving throw.

For Medicinal Purposes (Sp): Kirin

can  convert  an  alcoholic  drink  to  a  potion  of  cure  moderate

wounds three times per day.

Improvised  Weapons  (Ex):  Kirin  can  use  almost  any-

thing  at  hand  to  attack  his  foes.  An  improvised  weapon

deals 1d6 points of damage (type of damage depends on the

weapons shape). Long items have reach, and items with many

protrusions give Kirin a +2 bonus on disarm attempts.

Purity of Body (Ex): Kirin has immunity to all diseases

except for magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycan-

thropy.

Slow Fall (Ex): When within arms reach of a wall, Kirin

can use it to slow his descent while falling. He takes damage

as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still Mind (Ex): +2 bonus on saving throws against spells

EXOTIC WEAPON MASTER

Characters  of  any  race  or  background  can  become  exotic

weapon masters; the only real requirement is commitment

and perseverance. Nevertheless, most exotic weapon masters

are human, because members of that race have the most expo-

sure to new cultures and thus the most opportunity to take

up exotic weapons.

NPC exotic weapon masters often open training arenas or

schools for those interested in learning to  ght with unusual

weapons or tactics. They often take levels in other prestige

classes  and  can  be  found  as  champions  or  leaders  among

bands of warriors.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the exotic weapon

master prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Exotic weapon masters

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Exotic  Weapon  Stunt  (Ex):  At  each  level,  an  exotic

weapon master learns a special trick that he can use with any

exotic weapon for which he has the Weapon Focus feat. He

must  select  the  trick  learned  when  he  gains  the  level,  and

once selected, the choice cannot later be changed. He cant

select the same stunt more than once.

Close-Quarters Ranged Combat: A character who knows this

stunt doesnt provoke an attack of opportunity when using an

exotic ranged weapon.

Double  Weapon  Defense:  When  wielding  an  exotic  double

weapon  with  both  hands,  the  character  gains  a  +1  shield

bonus to AC.

Exotic Reach: When wielding an exotic weapon with reach,

the character may make an attack of opportunity against a foe

that provokes such an attack even if the foe has cover (but not

total cover).

Exotic Sunder: When wielding a one-handed or two-handed

exotic  weapon,  the  character  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of

damage on any successful sunder attempt.

Flurry of Strikes: When wielding an exotic double weapon or

a spiked chain with both hands, the character can elect to use

a full attack action to make a  urry of strikes. When doing

so, he may make one extra attack in the round at his full base

attack bonus, but this attack takes a 2 penalty, as does each

other attack made in that round and until the exotic weapon

masters next turn. The extra attack may be with either end

of the double weapon.

Ranged Disarm: The character can make a disarm at tempt

even on a ranged attack. Such an attack provokes no attack of

opportunity (except as normal for using a ranged weapon).

For the purpose of this disarm attempt, treat the characters

ranged weapon as a light weapon. If the character fails this

disarm attempt, the defender cant attempt to disarm him.

Show Off: As a standard action, the character can display

his mastery with an exotic weapon and confound his oppo-

nent. The character may make an Intimidate check against

a single opponent within 30 feet that can see him, adding

his base attack bonus to the result. If the result exceeds the

opponents  modi ed  level  check  (see  the  skill  description

on page 76 of the Players Handbook), the opponent becomes

shaken (2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving

throws)  for  1  round  per  class  level  of  the  exotic  weapon

master.

Stunning  Blow:  If  the  character  has  the  Stunning  Fist

feat, he can utilize the feat while wielding an exotic melee

weapon.

Throw  Exotic  Weapon:  The  character  can  throw  an  ex otic

weapon  with  no  penalty  on  the  attack  roll,  even  if  it  isnt

designed to be thrown (such as an orc double axe or a spiked

chain). When he throws a double weapon, only one end of

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   30

9/12/03, 10:23:24 AM

the weapon (characters choice) can strike the target. Exotic

weapons  thrown  in  this  way  have  a  range  increment  of

10 feet.

Twin Exotic Weapon Fighting: When wielding the same light

exotic weapon in each hand, the character is treated as having

the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. If he already has the feat, the

penalties on attack rolls are lessened to 1 for both the pri-

mary hand and the off hand when  ghting in this manner.

Trip  Attack:  The  character  can  use  a  one-handed  or  two-

handed exotic weapon to make a trip attack. If he is tripped

during his own trip attempt, he can drop the weapon to

avoid being tripped. If the exotic weapon already allows

its  wielder  to  make  trip  attacks,  the  character  instead

adds a +2 bonus on any trip attempt.

Uncanny  Blow:  When  wielding  a  one-handed  exotic

melee  weapon  in  two  hands,  the  character  can  focus

the  power  of  his  attack  so  that  he  deals  extra  damage

equal  to  his  Strength  bonus  2  instead  of

his  Strength  bonus  1-1/2.  If  he

has  the  Power  Attack  feat,  he

treats  the  weapon  as  two-

handed  for  purposes

of  determining  his

bonus  on  damage

rolls.

ing, Weapon Focus (gnome hooked hammer), Weapon Spe-

cialization (gnome hooked hammer).

Double Weapon Defense (Ex): When wielding a gnome

hooked  hammer  (or  any  other  exotic  double  weapon)  with

both hands, Golgos gains a +1 shield bonus to AC.

Flurry of Strikes (Ex): As part of a full attack, Golgos can

make an extra attack, with all of his attacks up to his next

turn taking a 2 penalty.

Gnome Traits (Ex): +1 save DC for illusions, +2 bonus on

EYE OF GRUUMSH

Most  people  think  they  have  seen  the  worst  that  orcs  can

breed when an orc barbarian comes raging over a hilltop

until they see a one-eyed orc barbarian come raging over a

hilltop. This creature may well be an eye of Gruumsh, an orc

so devoted to his evil deity that he has dis gured himself in

Gruumshs name.

In an epic battle at the dawn of time, the elven deity Corel-

lon Larethian stabbed out Gruumshs left eye. Filled with rage

and hatred, the orc deity called for followers loyal enough to

serve in his image. Those who heed this call are known as the

eyes of Gruumsh. They sacri ce their right eyes instead of

their left ones so that their impaired vision complements that

of their deity. Thus, symbolically at least, eyes of Gruumsh

can see what Gruumsh cannot. These living martyrs are some

of the toughest orcs and half-orcs in the world.

The eye of Gruumsh is a true prestige class in the sense that

all  orcs  respect  those  who  achieve  it.  If  a  candidate  proves

capable  with  the  orc  double  axe  and  has  no  moral  code  to

stand  in  the  way  of  his  service,  only  the  test  remainsto

put  out  his  own  right  eye  in  a  special  ceremony.  This  is  a

bloody and painful ritual, the details of which are best left

undescribed.  If  the  candidate  makes  a  sound  during  the

process, he fails the test. No consequences for failure exist,

except that the candidate can never thereafter become an eye

of Gruumshand he has lost an eye.

Barbarians  gain  the  most  value  from  this  prestige  class,

since it encourages raging as a  ghting style. Fighters, cler-

ics,  rangers,  and  even  rogues  also  heed  this  calling.  Some

orc tribes whisper of barbarians from other races who have

adopted  this  mantle.  Of  course,  these  may  just  be  legends

meant to inspire young orcs to jealous rage.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify to become an eye of Gruumsh, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Sight of Gruumsh

All of the following are class features of the eye of Gruumsh

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Eyes of Gruumsh gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Blind-Fight:  An  eye  of  Gruumsh  gains  Blind-Fight  as  a

bonus feat. In addition, he suffers no adverse effects from the

loss of one of his eyes.

Command  the  Horde  (Ex):  An  eye  of  Gruumsh  can

direct the actions of any nongood orcs or half-orcs that are

within 30 feet of him and whose Hit Dice are lower than his

character level. Those who follow the characters orders gain

a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. Any eligible orc or half-orc

who willingly goes against the eye of Gruumshs directions

loses this bonus immediately.

Rage (Ex): An eye of Gruumsh can  y into a rage just as a

barbarian can, with all the same bene ts and drawbacks (see

page 25 of the Players Handbook). An eye of Gruumshs class

levels stack with his barbarian levels (if any) for determining

the number of times per day he can use his rage ability. Add

together the characters levels in the eye of Gruumsh and bar-

barian classes and refer to Table 33: The Barbarian on page

25 of the Players Handbook to determine the number of rages

per day. For example, a 6th-level barbarian/2nd-level eye of

ORGANIZATION: THE EYES OF GRUUMSH

The cycle of my fathers people is a simple one. You kill, you get

better at killing, and you kill again. Break the cycle, and you die.

Krusk

Though orcs revere eyes of Gruumsh for their unique clarity of

vision, the average eye of Gruumsh isnt particularly well quali-

 ed to think for an entire tribeeven though he often assumes

leadership of a tribe early in his career. Thus, he relies on a cleric

of Gruumsh for wise counsel. To discourage any unhealthy con-

fusion among their followers about who is in charge, both the

eye of Gruumsh and the cleric encourage war against other races

at every opportunity.

Since eyes of Gruumsh seek to avenge Corellon Larethians

insult to their deity, most are so obsessed with the destruction of

elves that they attack any elven community on sight. Inspired by

their leaders rage, other orcs often throw themselves heedlessly

at elven hordes.

Multiple eyes of Gruumsh usually dont work well together

be cause  they  commonly  have  competing  ideas  about  which

course of action serves their deity best. Every few decades or

so,  how ever,  several  eyes  of  Gruumsh  get  the  same  idea  in

their  headsa  crusade!  (After  all,  a  holy  crusade  involving

hundreds of tribes under the command of dozens of eyes of

Gruumsh  is  just  the  thing  to  inspire  the  younger  generation

to the deitys service.) When this occurs, the eyes of Gruumsh

meet and declare truces between competing tribes by closing

their  functional  left  eyes  all  at  oncethus  blinding  them  to

their own bickering. Then they go out and try to eradicate some

other kind of creature.

Gruumsh could rage three times per day (the same as an 8th-

level barbarian), while a 4th-level eye of Gruumsh with no

levels in barbarian could rage twice per day (the same as a

4th-level barbarian).

Swing Blindly (Ex): An eye of Gruumshs rage becomes

more powerful when he reaches 2nd level, but at the cost

of  lowered  defenses.  The  character  adds  an  extra  +4  to

Strength while in a rage, but his Armor Class penalty goes

from 2 to 4.

Ritual Scarring (Ex):

Through  frequent  dis guration

of his own skin, an eye of

Gruumshs natural armor

bonus  improves  by  +1

at 3rd level (or to +1 if

he  didnt  already  have

a  natural  armor  bonus).

This  bonus

increases

by  another  +1  for  every

three  eye  of  Gruumsh

levels gained thereafter.

Blinding  Spittle

(Ex):  An  eye  of  Gru-

umsh  of  4th  level  or

higher  can

launch

blinding  spittle  at  any

opponent  within  20  feet.

With  a  successful  ranged

touch

(at

a  4  penalty),  he

spits  his  stomach

acid  into  the  targets

eyes.  An  opponent  who

fails a Re ex save (DC 10 + eye

of Gruumshs class level + eye

of  Gruumshs  Con  modi er)  is

blinded until he or she can rinse away

the spittle. This attack has no effect on

creatures that dont have eyes or

dont  depend  on  vision.  Blind-

ing  spittle  is  usable  twice  per

day  at  4th  level  and  four  times  per

day at 7th level.

Blindsight (Ex): At 5th level, an eye

of  Gruumsh  gains  blindsight  (see  page  306  of  the  Monster

Manual) out to 5 feet. The range increases to 10 feet at 8th

level.

Sight of Gruumsh (Ex): At 10th level, an eye of Gruumsh

gains the ability to see the moment of his own death through

his missing eye. This foreknowledge gives him a +2 morale

bonus on all saving throws and Armor Class from then on.

He also does not go unconscious when reduced to negative

hit points; however, the character still dies at 10 hit points.

(Whether  or  not  the  vision  is  accurate  is  irrelevantthe

character believes it to be true.)

Class Skills

The frenzied berserkers class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Ride

(Dex), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

FRENZIED BERSERKER

The random madness of the thunderstorm and the unpredict-

ability of the slaadi come together in the soul of the frenzied

berserker. Unlike most other characters, she does not  ght to

achieve some heroic goal or defeat a loathsome villain. Those

are mere excusesit is the thrill of combat that draws her.

For the frenzied barbarian, the insanity of battle is much like

an addictive drugshe must constantly seek out more con-

 ict to feed her craving for battle.

Along the wild borderlands and in the evil kingdoms of the

world, frenzied berserkers often lead warbands that include

a  variety  of  character  typesand  even  other  frenzied  ber-

serkers. Some such groups turn to banditry and brigandage;

others  serve  as  specialized  mercenaries.  Whatever  their

origin, such warbands naturally gravitate toward situations of

instability and con ict, because wars and civil strife are their

bread and butter. Indeed, the coming of a frenzied berserker

is the most obvious herald of troubled times.

The frenzied berserkers path is unsuited for most adven-

turersa  fact  for  which  the  peace-lovers  of  the  world  can

be thankful. Because of their traditional love for battle, orc

and  half-orc  barbarians  are  the  ones  who  most  frequently

adopt  this  prestige  class,  though  human  and  dwarf  barbar-

ians  also   nd  it  appealing.  It  might  seem  that  elves  would

be good candidates because of their chaotic nature, but the

elven aesthetic and love of grace are at odds with the frenzied

berserkers  devaluation  of  the  self.  Spellcasting  characters

and monks almost never become frenzied berserkers.

NPC frenzied berserkers often lead tribal warbands or raid-

ers made up of  ghters, barbarians, or other martial charac-

ters. Some fall in with humanoids and even giantish tribes,

but not all frenzied berserkers turn their chaotic strength to

evil.  A  few  have  found  homes  in  small  villages  or  in  rural

areas, acting as members of the settlements defenses. Most

people give even such well-intentioned frenzied berserkers a

wide berth, however, and they often  nd themselves wander-

ing as loners in the wilderness.

Hit Die: d12.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  frenzied  ber-

serker prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Frenzied  berserkers

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Frenzy  (Ex):  A  frenzied  berserker  can  enter  a  frenzy

during  combat.  While  frenzied,  she  gains  a  +6  bonus  to

Strength and, if she makes a full attack action, gains a single

extra  attack  each  round  at  her  highest  bonus.  (This  latter

effect is not cumulative with haste or other effects that grant

additional attacks.) However, she also takes a 4 penalty to

Armor  Class  and  takes  2  points  of  nonlethal  damage  per

round. A frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the

frenzied berserkers Constitution modi er. To end the frenzy

before its duration expires, the character may attempt a DC

20 Will save once per round as a free action. Success ends the

frenzy immediately; failure means it continues. The effects

of frenzy stack with those from any rage ability the character

may have.

At  1st  level,  the  character  can  enter  a  frenzy  once  per

day. Thereafter, she gains one additional use per day of this

ability for every two frenzied berserker levels she acquires

(but she cant use the ability more than once in any encoun-

ter). The character can enter a frenzy as a free action. Even

though this takes no time, she can do it only during her turn,

not in response to anothers action. In addition, if she takes

damage from an attack, spell, trap, or any other source, she

automatically enters a frenzy at the start of her next action,

as long as she still has at least one daily usage of the ability

left. To avoid entering a frenzy in response to a provoking

effect, the character must make a successful Will save (DC

10 + points of damage taken since her last action) at the start

of her next turn.

While frenzied, the character cannot use any Charisma-,

Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Intimi-

date),  the  Concentration  skill,  or  any  abilities  that

require  patience  or  concentration,  nor  can  she  cast

spells,  drink  potions,  activate  magic  items,  or  read

scrolls. She can use any feat she has except Combat

Expertise, item creation feats, or metamagic feats.

She can use her special ability to inspire frenzy (see

below) normally.

During  a  frenzy,  the  frenzied

berserker  must  attack  those  she

perceives  as  foes  to  the  best  of

her ability. Should she run out of

enemies before her frenzy expires,

her  rampage  continues.  She  must

then attack the nearest creature (deter-

mine  randomly  if  several

potential  foes  are  equidis-

tant) and  ght that opponent

without regard to friendship,

innocence,  or  health  (the

targets or her own).

When  a  frenzy  ends,

the frenzied berserker

is  fatigued  (2  pen-

alty to Strength and

Dexterity, unable to

charge or run) for

the  duration  of

the encounter.

A frenzied berserker

If the character is still under the effect of a rage ability, the

fatigued  condition  does  not  apply  until  the  rage  endsat

which point the character is exhausted, not merely fatigued.

Diehard:  A

frenzied  ber-

serker gains Die-

hard as a bonus feat

even if she does not meet

the prerequisites.

Supreme  Cleave:  At

2nd  level  and  higher,  a  frenzied

berserker  can  take  a  5-foot  step

between  attacks  when  using  the

Cleave or Great Cleave feat. She is

still limited to one such adjust-

ment  per  round,  so  she  cannot

use  this  ability  during  a  round

in  which  she  has  already  taken  a

5-foot step.

Deathless  Frenzy  (Ex):  At  4th  level

and  higher,  a  frenzied  berserker  can

scorn  death  and  unconsciousness

while  in  a  frenzy.  As  long  as  her

frenzy continues, she is not treated

as disabled at 0 hit points, nor is

she treated as dying at 1 to 9

hit points. Even if reduced to 10

hit  points  or  less,  she  continues

to  ght normally until her frenzy

ends. At that point, the effects of her

wounds  apply  normally  if  they  have

not  been  healed.  This  ability  does  not

prevent  death  from  massive  damage

or from spell effects such as slay living

or disintegrate.

Improved  Power  Attack:  Begin-

ning  at  5th  level,  a  frenzied  berserker

gains a +3 bonus on her melee damage

rolls for every 2 penalty she takes on

her  melee  attack  rolls  when  using

the  Power  Attack  feat  (or  +3  for

every  1  penalty  if  wielding  a

two-handed  weapon  other  than  a

double weapon). This bene t does

not stack with the normal effects of

Power Attack.

Inspire Frenzy (Su): Beginning

at 6th level, a frenzied berserker can

inspire frenzy in her allies while

she herself is frenzied.

When  she  uses  this

ability,  all  willing  allies  within

10 feet of her gain the bene ts and

the  disadvantages  of  frenzy  as  if

they had that ability themselves. The

frenzy of affected allies lasts for a number of rounds equal to

3 + the frenzied berserkers Constitution modi er, regardless

of whether they remain within 10 feet of her.

A frenzied berserker gains one additional use of this abil-

ity per day for every two additional frenzied berserker levels

she acquires, though the ability is still usable only once per

encounter.

Greater Frenzy (Ex): Starting at 8th level, the characters

bonus  to  Strength  during  a  frenzy  becomes  +10  instead

of +6.

Supreme Power Attack: A 10th-level frenzied berserker

gains  a  +2  bonus  on  her  melee  damage  rolls  for  every  1

penalty she takes on her melee attack rolls when using the

Power  Attack  feat  (or  +4  for  every  1  penalty  if  wielding

a  two-handed  weapon  other  than  a  double  weapon).  This

bene t  does  not  stack  with  the  effects  of  Power  Attack  or

Improved Power Attack.

Tireless Frenzy: A 10th-level frenzied berserker no longer

becomes  fatigued  after  a  frenzy,  though  she  still  takes  the

nonlethal damage for each round it lasts.

Improved Sunder, Intimidating Rage, Power Attack.

Frenzy (Ex): When frenzied, Shanna gains a +10 bonus to

Strength, and she gains a single extra attack at a +21 bonus

if she makes a full attack action. She takes a 4 penalty to

Armor Class and takes 2 points of nonlethal damage every

round.  The  frenzy  lasts  for  5  rounds,  or  7  rounds  if  she  is

also raging. If she takes damage and still has uses of greater

frenzy remaining that day, she goes into greater frenzy as a

free  action  during  her  next  turn  unless  she  succeeds  on  a

Will save (DC 10 + points of damage). While in a frenzy, she

must attack foes, or a random creature if no foes remain. She

isnt considered disabled if she has 0 hit points or incapaci-

tated below 1 hit point. Even if shes below 9 hit points, she

doesnt die until the frenzy is over.

Improved  Power  Attack:  Shanna  gains  a  +3  bonus  on

her melee damage rolls for every 1 penalty she takes on the

attack roll when using the Power Attack feat.

Improved  Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Shanna  cannot  by

 anked except by a rogue of at least 10th level.

Inspire  Frenzy  (Su):  While  she  is  frenzied,  all  allies

within 10 feet of Shanna gain the bene ts and disadvantages

GNOME GIANT-SLAYER

In  every  gnome  community,  only  a  select  few  individuals

of extraordinary courage take up the mantle of giant-slayer.

Relying  on  a  combination  of  agility,  combat  prowess,  and

pure  craftiness,  the  gnome  giant-slayer  is  the  bane  of  all

creatures who use their size to terrorize the small or weak.

The champion of those far-too-often trampled underfoot, the

gnome  giant-slayer  stands  far  taller  than  his  stature  would

suggest. As the ultimate believers that The bigger they are,

the harder they fall, these doughty battlers actively seek out

ogres,  trolls,  giants,  and  the  like  to  slay.  Some  also  utilize

their training to take on other immense opponents, such as

umber hulks, monstrous vermin, and even dragons.

Most gnome giant-slayers are  ghters or rangers, although

some paladins and clerics also take up the path of giant slay-

ing. Rogues who favor looting the dens of ogres and the like

also become giant-slayers. Monks make excellent giant-slay-

ers.  Arcane  spellcasters  rarely  take  up  this  class,  since  it

largely  depends  on  toe-to-toe  interaction  with  immensely

powerful creatures.

Gnome giant-slayer NPCs are often lauded as heroes or celeb-

rities within gnome communities. They might serve as captains

of the guard, trainers, or in other positions of authority. Some

pass down their mantle from generation to generation, grant-

ing the bravest son or daughter a treasured nickname such as

Trollbane or Giant-Crasher. Those who work for their own

purposes  might  still  enjoy  some  measure  of  popularity  but

prefer to remain aloof from political venues in favor of pursu-

ing personal gain. Of course, many look to adventure to prove

their mettle; rare indeed is the gnome giant-slayer who hasnt

bearded his share of trolls or  re giants in their very lairs.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become a gnome giant-slayer, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Race: Gnome.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills:  Escape  Artist  3  ranks,  Speak  Language  (Giant),

Tumble 3 ranks.

Feats: Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack.

dodge bonuses, this bene t stacks with the bonus granted by

the Mobility feat.

Annoying  Strike  (Ex):  Whenever  a  gnome  giant-slayer

of 9th level or higher damages a giant in melee, that giant is

shaken for 1 round.

Defensive Roll (Ex): A 10th-level gnome giant-slayer can

roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from

it than he otherwise would. Once per day, when he would be

reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a

weapon or other blow struck by a giant, not a spell or special

ability), he can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this

ability, he makes a Re ex saving throw (DC = damage dealt;

the gnome giant-slayer adds his class level as a bonus on this

saving throw). If the save succeeds, he takes only half damage

from the blow; if it fails, he takes full damage. He must be

aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute

his defensive rollif he is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC,

he cant use this ability. Since this effect would not normally

allow a character to make a Re ex save for half damage, the

characters evasion or improved evasion ability (if applicable)

does not apply to the defensive roll.

HALFLING OUTRIDER

The seminomadic culture of the hal ing race often results

in  sudden  encounters  with  peril.  To  safeguard  themselves,

many  hal ing  communities  turn  to  their  outriders,  elite

champions  whose  task  it  is  to  warn  their  fellows  of,  and

protect them from, danger. The hal ing outrider is naturally

skilled in the arts of riding and scouting.

Most  hal ing  outriders  are   ghters,  rangers,  druids,  or

rogues.  All  classes,  however,  can  bene t  from  the  Armor

Class bonus and defensive riding capabilities of the class.

NPC  hal ing  outriders  are  usually  found  performing

their duties in the  eld, or relaxing in their off-duty hours.

The presence of an outrider whether a eld or at rest usually

indicates that a hal ing community cannot be far away.

However, some outriders feel the pull of adventure more

strongly.  These  individuals  leave  behind  their  hearths  and

homes for a life of excitement on the road.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  hal ing  outrider,  a  character  must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Race: Hal ing.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Listen: 3 ranks, Ride 6 ranks, Spot 3 ranks.

Feats: Mounted Combat, Mounted Archery.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the hal ing outrider

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Hal ing outriders gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

AC Bonus: A hal ing outrider gains a dodge bonus to the

characters Armor Class when she is mounted. This bene t

is lost in any situation in which the character would lose her

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.

Mount: A hal ing outrider gains a mount appropriate to

the resources of her hal ing community. Most hal ing com-

munities attempt to provide an out rider with a riding dog or

a warpony. A hal ing outrider may, of course, choose to  nd

and  train  or  purchase  a  more  exotic  mount.  Standard  tack

and  harness  is  also  provided,  though,  again,  the  character

may wish to purchase masterwork or magic gear.

Hal ing outrider class levels stack with paladin, druid, and

ranger levels for determining the characteristics of a paladins

mount or an animal companion.

Alertness: A hal  ing outrider gains Alertness as a bonus

feat.

Ride  Bonus:  A  hal ing  outrider  gains  a  competence

bonus equal to her class level on all Ride checks.

Defensive Riding (Ex): A hal ing outrider of 2nd level

or higher knows the tricks of defensive riding. If she does

nothing else while mounted (she cannot attack when riding

defensively), she gains a +2 bonus on Re ex saves and a +4

dodge bonus to Armor Class. In addition, her mount gains a

+20 ft. bonus to its speed, a +2 bonus on all Will saves, and a

+4 dodge bonus to its Armor Class.

Unbroken  Charge  (Ex):  At  3rd  level  and  higher,  a

mounted hal ing outrider can charge through dif cult ter-

rain or squares occupied by friendly creatures by making a

DC 15 Ride check.

Stand on Mount (Ex): At 4th level, a mounted hal ing

outrider  becomes  able  to  stand  on  her  mounts  back  even

during movement or combat, taking no penalties to actions

while doing so, by making a DC 20 Ride check. While stand-

ing  on  her  mounts  back,  a  hal ing  outrider  does  not  take

any penalty for using a ranged weapon while her mount is

taking a double move or running (see the Mounted Archery

feat description, page 98 of the Players Handbook).

Leap  from  the  Saddle  (Ex):  A  hal ing  outrider  of  5th

level or higher can dismount and land adjacent to her mount

as a free action by making a DC 20 Ride check. If an oppo-

nent is in a square she threatens (after dismounting), she can

make a melee attack against that opponent, taking a +2 bonus

on the attack roll and a 2 penalty to Armor Class (just as if

the  character  were  making  a  charge).  This  ability  is  usable

only if the mount is moving no faster than twice its speed.

Evasion  (Ex):  At  7th  level,  a  hal ing  outrider  gains  the

evasion ability. If she makes a successful Re ex saving throw

against an attack that normally deals half damage on a suc-

cessful  save,  she  instead  takes  no  damage.  Evasion  can  be

used only if the hal ing outrider is wearing light armor or

no  armor.  A  helpless  hal ing  outrider  (such  as  one  who  is

unconscious  or  paralyzed)  does  not  gain  the  bene t  of  the

ability.

While the hal ing outrider is mounted, she confers this

ability to her mount as well, and the mount is able to use the

hal ing outriders Re ex save bonus or its own, whichever is

higher.

If the character already has the evasion ability, she gains

improved evasion instead, and her mount still receives the

bene t  of  evasion  as  described  above.  Improved  evasion

works like evasion, except that while the character still takes

no  damage  on  a  successful  Re ex  saving  throw,  she  takes

only half damage on a failed save.

Full Mounted Attack (Ex): At 8th level and higher, a hal-

 ing outrider may make a full attack when her mount moves

more than 5 feet but no more than a single move action. The

character  cannot  combine  this  full  attack  with  a  charge

action.

Quick Turn (Ex): A 10th-level hal ing outrider can make

a  DC  25  Ride  check  as  a  free  action  to  force  her  mount  to

execute  one  change  of  direction  during  while  running  or

charging (though the mount must still move at least 10 feet

in a straight line after the turn to execute a charge). The turn

may be up to 90 degrees, and the mount may make only one

such  turn  per  round.  If  the  Ride  check  fails,  the  mount

moves an extra 10 feet in a straight line and then loses the

rest of its actions on this turn.

To qualify to become a hulking hurler, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Feats: Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (any

thrown weapon).

Special: Large size or larger.

Class Skills

The  hulking  hurlers  class

skills (and the key ability for

each  skill)  are  Climb  (Str),

Intimidate  (Cha),  Jump

(Str), and Swim (Str).

Skill  Points  at  Each

Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

Area  Attack:  The  character  makes  an  attack  roll  against  a

square the target creature occupies (AC 10) rather than the

creature itself. Any creature in the square must succeed on

a  Re ex  save  (DC  10  +  the  hulking  hurlers  ranged  attack

bonus)  or  take  full  damage.  This  ability  may  only  be  used

with a Huge or larger weapon.

Knockdown  Blow:  If  the  hulking  hurlers  attack  hits  and

does damage to any creature of Medium or smaller size, the

target is rendered prone.

Meteor Strike: As a full-round action, a hulking hurler deals

extra damage equal to twice his Strength bonus on a success-

ful hit with a thrown weapon.

Overburdened  Heave:  The  hulking  hurler  can  throw  a

weapon up to two sizes larger than his size category, or

an  item  that  weighs  as  much  as  his  medium  load  (so  a

Large hulking hurler with a Strength score of 25 could

heave a Gargantuan javelin or a rock weighing up to 533

pounds).

Ranged Power Attack: If the target is within 30 feet, the hulk-

ing hurler can use Power Attack with his thrown weapon.

Sample Hulking Hurler

Wellsy: Stone giant hulking hurler 3; CR 11; Large giant;

HD 14d8+72 plus 3d10+18; hp 170; Init +3; Spd 30 ft.; AC 24,

A hulking hurler

All the following are class features of the hulking hurler.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Hulking hurlers gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Catch Weapon (Ex): A hulking hurler gains the Snatch

Arrows feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites. He

may catch weapons of his size or smaller (and hurl them back

at the attacker immediately if he chooses).

Really Throw Anything (Ex): A hulking hurler gains the

Throw Anything feat (described in Chapter 3 of this book)

as  a  bonus  feat.  However,  since  a  hulking  hurler  depends

on  brute  strength  more  than  skill,  he  can  throw  anything

(not just weapons) he can lift as a light load. If the item is an

improvised weapon, he takes a 2 penalty on his attack roll

instead of the normal 4. Use the rules in Chapter 4 of this

book to determine the amount of damage the thrown weapon

does.

The range increment of a thrown weapon or improvised

weapon  wielded  by  a  hulking  hurler  is  10  feet  +  5  feet  per

size  category  the  hulking  hurler  is  beyond  Large  (this  is  a

modi cation of the Throw Anything feat).

Two-Handed  Hurl  Trick  (Ex):  At  2nd  level  and  again

at 3rd level, a hulking hurler chooses one of the following

tricks.  In  order  to  use  any  of  these  abilities,  the  hulking

hurler must grip the weapon or improvised weapon in two

hands and throw it as a full-round action.

human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar condi-

tions of poor visibility. He retains the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Rock Catching (Ex): Wellsy can catch Small, Medium, or

Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once per round,

if he would normally be hit by a rock, he can make a Re ex

save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock,

20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile

provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC in creases

by that amount.) Wellsy must be ready for and aware of the

attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.

Possessions:  Large  +1  greatclub,  5  throwing  rocks,  6  other

items in his bag (see page 120 of the Monster Manual).

HUNTER OF THE DEAD

The hunter of the dead is the hated enemy of all undead. She

spends each restless night tracking undead to their lairs and

cleansing the land of their foul presence.

The  hunter  of  the  dead  has  many  tools  with  which  to

 ght such creatures. Her skill with arms is the match of any

 ghters, but, to aid her in the hunt, she also possesses spells

and  special  abilities  that  draw  upon  her  connection  with

positive energy. Most hunters of the dead are clerics or pala-

dins.  Fighters,  rangers,  monks,  druids,  and  barbarians  also

make excellent hunters of the dead, while rogues and bards

add  their  subterfuge  skills  to  create  a  foe  that  the  undead

never see coming. Sorcerers and wizards especially those

with a few levels of cleric or paladinhave many advantages

when  ghting undead, so they should never be discounted as

potential hunters of the dead.

As  NPCs,  hunters  of  the  dead  are  quiet  loners,  driven

to  think  of  little  but  their  cause.  They  usually  have  some

traumatic tale about what brought them to hate the undead,

but few are willing to share it with those they meet as they

wander from town to town. In places where spirits are partic-

ularly restless and the dead walk in numbers, hunters of the

dead gather in secretive orders such as the House of Death to

pool their strength and attack their foes together.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a hunter of the dead, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks.

Special: Able to turn undead.

Special:  Scar  of  Unlife:  The  character  must  have  lost  one

level or had an ability score point drained by an undead crea-

ture. Even if the loss is later offset by magic, this is the scar of

unlife that all hunters of the dead carry.

Class Skills

The hunter of the deads class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Heal (Wis), Knowledge

(religion)  (Int),  Profession  (Wis),  Ride  (Dex),  and  Search

(Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  hunter  of  the

dead prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Hunters  of  the  dead

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: Beginning at 1st level, a hunter of the dead gains

the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast a spell, a

hunter of the dead must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 +

the spells level, so a hunter of the dead with a Wisdom of 10

or lower cannot cast these spells. Hunter of the dead bonus

spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these

spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the hunter of the deads

Wisdom  bonus  (if  any).  When  the  hunter  of  the  dead  gets

0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level

spells for a 1st-level hunter of the dead), she gains only the

bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom

score for that spell level.

The hunter of the deads spell list appears below; she has

access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to

prepare. A hunter of the dead prepares and casts spells just as

a cleric does (though a hunter of the dead cannot lose a spell

to cast a cure spell in its place).

Detect Undead (Sp): At will, a hunter of the dead can use

detect undead as if casting the spell of the same name.

Smite Undead (Su): Once per day, a hunter of the dead

of 2nd level or higher can attempt to smite undead with one

normal melee attack. She adds her Wisdom modi er (if posi-

tive) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per

level.  For  example,  an  8th-level  hunter  of  the  dead  armed

with a longsword would deal 1d8+8 points of damage, plus

any additional bonuses for Strength and magical effects that

normally  apply.  If  a  hunter  of  the  dead  accidentally  smites

attempts as a standard action, Torga can deal 8d6 points of

damage to all undead within 100 feet (Re ex DC 18 half).

Smite Evil (Su): Torga may attempt to smite evil with one

normal melee attack. She adds +2 to her attack roll and deals

5 extra points of damage. Smiting a creature that is not evil

has no effect but counts as a use of the ability for that day.

Smite Undead (Su): As smite evil, but it functions against

undead and provides a +2 bonus on the attack roll, and a +8

bonus on the damage roll. Torga can use smite evil and smite

undead in a single attack (against an evil undead creature) if

or otherwise). Allies within 10 feet of her gain a +4 morale

bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

Aura  of  Good  (Ex):  Torgas  aura  of  good  (see  the  detect

good spell) is equal to that of a 5th-level cleric.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell of the same name.

Detect Undead (Sp): At will, as the spell of the same name.

Divine  Grace  (Su):  Torga  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  saving

throws (already  gured into the above statistics).

Divine  Health  (Ex):  Torga  is  immune  to  all  diseases,

including  magical  diseases  such  as  mummy  rot  and  lycan-

thropy.

Lay  on  Hands  (Su):  Torga  can  cure  10  hit  points  of

wounds per day.

Special Mount (Sp): Torgas special mount is a heavy war-

horse (see page 45 of the Players Handbook) that has +2 Hit

Dice, a +4 bonus to natural armor, +1 Strength, and improved

evasion. Torga has an empathic link with the mount and can

share spells and saving throws with it. She can call her mount

once per day for up to 10 hours as a full-round action.

Spurn  Deaths  Touch  (Ex):  Torga  gains  a  +2  bonus  on

saves against spells and effects from undead.

True Death (Su): Undead slain by Torga in melee or with

spells can never again rise as undead.

INVISIBLE BLADE

Who  is  this  fool  who  dares  to  challenge  you  in  the  arena?

You brandish a greatsword, and he whips out a dagger. You

unsheathe  your  longsword,  and  he  throws  off  his  armor.

You advance menacingly, and he only smiles at youa big,

maniacal grin. Is he mad? Does he have a death wish? No, he

is an invisible blade, and you have made the classic mistake of

underestimating his prowess. As you  ght, he seems almost

relaxed,  stepping  lightly  to  the  side,  dodging  your  blows

easily.  His  eyes  note  your  every  move,  as  though  taking

mental notes about your style. Then, in the split second when

you  lower  your  guard,  he  exploits  your  error,  plunging  his

weapon into your heart.

Invisible  blades  are  deadly   ghters  who  prefer  to  use

daggers and related weapons in combat. Their training and

techniques with these weapons make them just as lethal as

any  well-armed   ghter.  Invisible  blades  enjoy  cultivating

misconceptions about the level of danger they present, and

they relish any chance to demonstrate that the most unim-

posing weapons can be the most lethal. Thus, invisible blades

are rarely impressed by how mighty their opponents appear.

An invisible blade specializes in  ghting with the dagger,

kukri, or punching dagger. He is not penalized for using other

weapons with which he is pro cient, but every class ability he

possesses is tied into using one of these three weapons.

Class Skills

The  invisible  blades  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each skill) are Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft

(Int),  Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Jump  (Str),  Hide  (Dex),  Innu-

endo  (Cha),  Listen  (Wis),  Move  Silently  (Dex),  Perform

(Cha),  Profession  (Wis),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  Spot  (Wis),

and Tumble (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the invisible blade

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Invisible blades gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Dagger Sneak Attack (Ex): An invisible blade gains the

sneak attack ability (see the description of the dark hunter,

earlier  in  this  chapter)  if  he  does  not  already  have  it,  but

the extra damage applies only to sneak attacks made with a

dagger, kukri, or punching dagger (the DM may allow other

similar weapons). When making a sneak attack with one of

these weapons, he deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st

level, and this increases to 2d6 at 3rd level and to 3d6 at 5th

level. If he already has the sneak attack ability from a previ-

ous class, the applicable bonuses on damage rolls stack.

Unfettered  Defense  (Ex):  An  invisible  blade  bene ts

from an increased survival instinct during combat. Because

of this sixth sense, he adds 1 point of Intelligence bonus (if

any) per invisible blade class level to his Armor Class in addi-

tion to any other modi ers he would normally receive. If the

invisible blade is caught  at-footed or is otherwise denied his

Dexterity modi er to Armor Class, he also loses this bonus.

Unfettered defense functions only when an invisible blade

is not wearing armor and is armed with one or more daggers,

kukris, or punching daggers as his only weapons.

Bleeding  Wound  (Ex):  An  invisible  blade  of  2nd  level

or  higher  who  makes  a  successful  dagger  sneak  attack  can

choose  to  deal  a  bleeding  wound,  sacri cing  1d6  points  of

the  extra  damage  from  the  dagger  sneak  attack.  Such  an

attack deals damage as normal in the round when the attack

hits.  Thereafter,  the  wound  caused  by  the  invisible  blades

dagger  bleeds  for  1  point  of  damage  per  round.  Multiple

wounds from the weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss

(two wounds for 2 points of damage per round, and so on).

The bleeding can only be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or

the application of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal,

healing circle, and so on). Creatures immune to sneak attack

damage are immune to bleeding wounds as well.

Uncanny Feint (Ex): At 3rd level, an invisible blade gains

the ability to feint in combat (see page 68 of the Players Hand-

book) as a move action rather than a standard action. At 5th

level, the character can feint in combat as a free action. An

invisible blade can use uncanny feint only when armed with

a dagger, kukri, or punching dagger.

Feint Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, an invisible blade armed

with  a  dagger,  kukri,  or  punching  dagger  becomes  so  sure

of  his  ability  to  mislead  opponents  that  he  can  take  10  on

all Bluff checks when feinting in combat (see page 68 of the

Players Handbook), even if stress and distractions would nor-

mally prevent him from doing so.

Point Blank Shot, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (dagger).

Bleeding  Wound  (Ex):  Tallis  can  forgo  1d6  points  of

dagger  sneak  attack  damage  to  in ict  a  wound  that  bleeds

for 1 point of damage per round until the victim receives the

bene t of a Heal check (DC 15) or magical healing. Multiple

wounds result in cumulative bleeding. Creatures immune to

sneak attack are immune to bleeding wounds as well.

Feint Mastery (Ex): When armed with a dagger, kukri, or

punching dagger, Tallis can always take 10 on Bluff checks

when feinting in combat.

Uncanny Feint (Ex): Tallis can feint in combat as a free

action rather than a standard action.

Evasion (Ex): If Tallis is exposed to any effect that nor-

mally allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half

damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Half-Elf Traits (Ex): Immunity to magic sleep spells and

effects;  +2  racial  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  enchant-

ment spells or effects; elven blood.

Trap Sense (Ex): Against attacks by traps, Tallis gets a +2

bonus on Re ex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

Trap  nding (Ex): Tallis can use a Search check to locate

a trap when the task has a DC higher than 20.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Tallis  can  react  to  danger  before

his  senses  would  normally  allow  him  to  do  so.  He  retains

his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when caught  at-

footed.

Unfettered Defense (Ex): Tallis adds his +2 Intelligence

bonus to his Armor Class when he is not wearing armor and

is armed with one or more daggers, kukris, or punching dag-

gers as his only weapons. If he is denied his Deterity modi er

to AC, he loses this bonus.

Possessions:  2  +1  returning  daggers,  headband  of  intellect  +2,

bracers  of  armor  +1,  cloak  of  elvenkind,  boots  of  striding  and

springing.

JUSTICIAR

Where  there  are  laws,  there  are  those  who  defy  them,  and

where citizens live in fear of these lawbreakers, brave souls

hunt  them  down.  These  are  the  justiciars.  They  dont  do

it  for  money;  they  dont  do  it  for  glory.  They  do  it  because

its a thankless job that needs to be done. It also

happens  to  be  a  satisfying  vocation

to  make  a  living  by  kicking  the

daylights out of a criminal who

desperately deserves it.

Justiciars  are  generally  soli-

tary, relying on their own wits

and  skills.  They  are  fearless

and  single-minded  in  pur-

suit  of  their  prey  and

ruthlessly  effective

in  combat.  Inno-

cence  and  alibi

can  be  argued  in

front of a court, but

pretty  words  dont

change  the  facts  of

the  case  or  absolve

a criminal of guilt. A

justiciar is not neces-

sarily judge, jury, or

executioner;  often

he  simply  sees  to  it

that those people get

the  chance  to  do

their jobs. When

it  is  impracti-

cal  to  bring  a

miscreant  to

the  hands  of

the  law,  or  if

the  criminal

resists, a justiciar

doesnt  hesitate  to

bring   nal  justice

to  someone  who

deserves  it.  Some  evil

justiciars  prefer  torturing

their prisoners into confessing before turning them in.

When faced with a dif cult challenge, justiciars may team

up  with  each  other  or  with  a  posse  of  other  characters  to

hunt those wanted by the law. The presence of one or more

justiciars in a posse might come as a rude surprise to a group

of individuals that have been robbing from the rich to give to

the poor. . . .

Most justiciars begin as rangers. Some paladins also  nd

being a justiciar in line with their ideology. Fighters often

 nd enough reward in killing; bringing people back alive is

typically  more  effort  than  they  consider  worthwhile.  Con-

versely, many clerics are too forgiving to be justiciars; obvious

exceptions  include  clerics  of  St.  Cuthbert,  as  well  as  those

of Hextor and certain other lawful evil deities. Rogues and

bards, with their stealth-oriented skills, can be very effective

in this class. Even the occasional druid, sorcerer, or wizard

(especially diviners) enters the  eld, wielding spells as their

weapons instead of steel.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  justiciar,  a

character must ful ll all the following

criteria.

Alignment: Any lawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Skills:  Gather  Information  5  ranks,

Search 5 ranks, Survival 5 ranks.

Feats:  Skill  Focus  (Gather  Information),

Track.

A justiciar

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the justiciar prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Justiciars gain no pro-

 ciency with any weapon or armor.

Bring em Back Alive (Ex): Whenever a justiciar attacks

with  a  melee  weapon,  he  can  deal  nonlethal  damage  with

the weapon instead of lethal damage with no penalty on the

attack roll. Normally, attempting to deal nonlethal damage

with a weapon in this way incurs a 4 penalty on the attack

roll.

Nonlethal  Strike  (Ex):  A  justiciar  can  make  nonlethal

strikes. Any time the character uses the bring em back alive

ability and his target would be denied her Dexterity bonus

to Armor Class (whether she actually has a Dexterity bonus

or not) or when the justiciar  anks the target, the justiciars

attack  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of  nonlethal  damage.  This

extra damage increases to 2d6 at 4th level, 3d6 at 7th level,

and 4d6 at 10th level. Should the justiciar score a critical hit

with a nonlethal strike, this extra damage is not multiplied.

A justiciar can use nonlethal strike only on a living creature

with discernible anatomyundead, constructs, oozes, plants,

and incorporeal creatures are not subject to this extra damage.

Also, creatures immune to nonlethal damage are immune to

nonlethal strike damage. The justiciar cannot make a nonle-

thal strike against a creature with concealment.

Improved Grapple (Ex): At 2nd level, a justiciar receives

Improved Grapple as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the

prerequisites.

Crippling Strike (Ex): A justiciar of 2nd level or higher

can make a nonlethal strike against an opponent with such

precision that his blow weakens and hampers the opponent.

When  a  justiciar  damages  an  opponent  with  a  nonlethal

strike, that character also takes 1 point of Strength damage.

Exotic  Weapon  Pro  ciency  (Manacles):  Intimately

familiar with the capture of criminals, justiciars have learned

to do more with a pair of manacles than restrain a lawbreaker.

A justiciar of 3rd level or higher can swing a pair of metal

manacles in one hand as if they were a club without taking a

penalty for using an improvised weapon. Masterwork mana-

cles can be wielded as if they were a masterwork light  ail.

Street Savvy (Ex): A justiciar of 3rd level or higher gains

a  circumstance  bonus  on  Gather  Information  checks  he

attempts while in pursuit of a criminal. This bonus is initially

+2 at 3rd level, and increases by an extra +2 every third level

thereafter.

Hog-Tie (Ex): When a justiciar of 5th level or higher suc-

cessfully pins an opponent while grappling, he can attempt

to hog-tie the opponent (in addition to his other options; see

48

If  Youre  Pinning  an  Opponent  on  page  156  of  the  Players

Handbook). A justiciar must have a rope, chain, or manacles

in one hand to use this ability.

A justiciar can use this ability on an opponent of up to one

size category larger than he is (for example, a hal ing justiciar

can attempt to hog-tie a Medium or smaller opponent). He

can use the ability only against humanoid-shaped creatures

(thus,  most  humanoids,  monstrous  humanoids,  outsiders,

and giants would qualify).

An attempt to hog-tie is resolved with an opposed check.

The justiciar can make a Use Rope check instead of a normal

grapple  check,  while  the  opponent  makes  either  a  grapple

check  or  an  Escape  Artist  check.  If  the  justiciar  succeeds,

the opponent is hog-tied. If the opponent succeeds, the hog-

tie attempt fails and the grapple continues.

If a justiciar successfully hog-ties an opponent, that person

is  considered  bound  and  helpless.  A  bound  opponent  can

attempt to escape by making an Escape Artist check opposed

by the justiciars Use Rope check (including his +10 bonus;

see Bind a Character on page 86 of the Players Handbook) or a

Strength check (DC 23 for rope, DC 26 for chain or manacles,

DC 28 for masterwork manacles) to break free.

Improved  Hog-tie  (Ex):  A  justiciar  of  8th  level  or

higher can make a hog-tie attempt without  rst pinning his

opponent.Whenever a grapple is established, the justiciar can

use an attack action to make a hog-tie attempt. Also, if the jus-

ticiar has the Quick Draw feat, he does not need to be holding

the rope, chain, or manacles in his hand before making the

attempt.

Intuition (Su): When hunting a speci c person, a 10th-

level justiciar can use a Survival check to determine in which

direction the culprit might be found if the criminal is within

1 mile of the justiciar (DC 15 + targets HD). A justiciar can

use this ability to determine the direction of anyone he has

previously faced in combat if he or she is within range.

The DM should make this check secretly for the justiciar,

since the character should not know if he failed the check

because of the die roll or because the target is too far away.

A justiciar can make this check once per day for any single

target.

Multiclass Note: A paladin who becomes a justiciar may

continue advancing as a paladin.

Sample Justiciar

Bring em Back Alive (Ex): Sharsek can deal nonlethal

damage with a melee weapon with no penalty on the attack

roll.

Crippling Strike (Ex): When Sharsek makes a nonlethal

strike (see below), he also deals 1 point of temporary Strength

damage.

Improved  Hog-Tie  (Ex):  Whenever  Sharsek  establishes

a grapple against a Large or smaller humanoid-shaped crea-

ture, he can use an attack action to make a hog-tie attempt

(a  grapple  check  or  Use  Rope  check  opposed  by  the  foes

grapple  check  or  Escape  Artist  check).  If  he  succeeds,  the

foe is bound and helpless.

Nonlethal  Strike  (Ex):  When  Sharsek  deals  nonlethal

melee damage against a foe he is  anking or who would be

denied  her  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  (whether  she

actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), Sharseks attack deals

an extra 4d6 points of damage. Only living creatures with dis-

cernible anatomy are subject to a subdual strike. The justiciar

cant use subdual strike against creatures with concealment.

Animal  Companion  (Ex):  Sharsek  has  a  wolf  as  an

an imal companion. Its statistics are as described on page 283

of the Monster Manual, except that Sharsek can handle it as a

free action and share spells if the companion is within 5 feet

(see page 36 of the Players Handbook).

Combat  Style  (Ex):  Sharsek  has  selected  two-weapon

combat. He gains the Two-Weapon Fighting feat despite not

having the requisite Dexterity score.

Favored  Enemy  (Ex):  Sharsek  gains  a  +4  bonus  on  his

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when

using these skills against humans. He gets the same bonus on

weapon damage rolls against humans.

Against  goblinoids,  he  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  these  skill

checks and on weapon damage rolls.

Improved Combat Style (Ex): Sharsek has the Improved

Two-Weapon Fighting feat despite not having the requisite

Dexterity score.

Intuition (Su): When hunting a speci c person, Sharsek

can determine the direction of his quarry with a successful

Survival check (DC 15 + targets HD) if the target is within

1 mile.

Street Savvy (Ex): Sharsek has a +6 circumstance bonus

on all Gather Information checks made while in pursuit of

a criminal.

Wild Empathy (Ex): Sharsek can improve the attitude of

an animal in the same way a Diplomacy check can improve

the attitude of a sentient being. He rolls 1d20+6, or 1d20+2 if

attempting to in uence a magical beast with an Intelligence

score of 1 or 2.

Ranger  Spells  Prepared  (2;  save  DC  12  +  spell  level):  1st

animal messenger, magic fang.

Possessions: +2 short sword, +1 short sword, +1 composite longbow

(+6 Str bonus), +2 mithral breastplate, belt of giant strength +4,

dimensional shackles (counts as masterwork manacles), medal-

lion of thoughts.

KENSAI

The kensai masters body, mind, weapon, and will. He devotes

his strength and his life to the service of a master or an ideal

he  accepts  as  greater  than  himself.  Some  kensai  become

masters  in  their  own  right,  but  even  one  who  becomes  an

emperor sees himself as a servant of some higher power.

Most characters who become kensai aspire to the class from

the beginning of their careers. Often, other kensai or elite mil-

itary organizations train likely young men and women in the

principles of service, the arts of war, and the purity of mind

and body necessary to become a kensai. Even those who do

not qualify at the end often become powerful adventurers.

A  kensai  can  be  a  lone  adventurer,  serving  an  ideal  or

attempting  to  ful ll  a  lifetime  goal.  Some  kensai  swear

fealty to great lords and rise to become trusted bodyguards,

warlords, or leaders in the lords service. Monks and paladins

know the strenuous road a kensai must travel, and some tread

that path. Fighters value the might of the kensai, and some

clerics  have  been  known  to  join  their  ranks.  Few  wizards

or sorcerers achieve kensai status, and bards and barbarians

 nd themselves particularly unsuited to service as a kensai.

While it might be thought that a rogue would make a poor

kensai, such characters are not unheard of and can be deadly

adversaries.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become a kensai, a character must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Alignment: Any lawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Concentration 5 ranks, Diplomacy 5 ranks, Ride 5

ranks.

Feats: Combat Expertise, Weapon Focus (any weapon).

Special: Must complete an oath of service (see sidebar) to

either an overlord or an ideal.

Class Skills

The kensais class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft

(Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Jump  (Str),

Knowledge (local and nobility) (Int), Ride (Dex), and Sense

Motive (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the kensai prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Kensai gain no pro -

ciency with any weapon or armor.

Signature Weapon (Su): The kensai chooses one of his

weapons (it must be one for which he has the Weapon Focus

feat)  to  become  a  signature  weapon.  Most  kensai  choose

either  a  sword  or  bow  for  this  weapon,  but  even  a  kensais

natural weapons can be chosen. If the weapon is a manufac-

tured one, it must be of at least masterwork quality.

Upon  qualifying  for  the  class,  a  kensai  gains  the  ability

to establish a link with his signature weapon. The character

focuses part of his life energy on the weapon, making it more

effective in his hands and his hands alone.

A weapon cant actually have an enhancement bonus

higher than +5, but it can have special abilities that are the

equivalent of additional bonuses. Use these lines on the

table to determine the XP cost when special abilities are

added to a signature weapon. Example: A 6th-level kensai

who has a masterwork longsword can imbue it with the

power to be a +5 keen longsword at a cost of 1,440 XP, since

the keen special ability is equivalent to a +1 bonus.

* The XP cost presented here assumes that the weapon

being imbued does not already have an enhancement

bonus. If it does, the cost to imbue it with additional power

is reduced. For instance, if a kensai has a +1 longsword and

wants to imbue it with the power to be a +3 longsword, he

may do so by paying the difference in XP cost between

creating a +1 weapon and a +3 weapon (360 minus 40, or

320 XP).

The process for imbuing a signature weapon with power

is a simple one. The character must  nd a quiet, safe spot to

meditate (and pray, for those kensai who serve deities) for 24

hours. At the end of this meditation, the kensai sacri ces a

number of experience points, essentially shifting some of his

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

OATH OF SERVICE

A kensais oath of service must be sworn in front of witnesses

and  must  be  upheld  for  the  kensai  to  continue  advancing  in

levels. Typical oaths include swearing service to a powerful lord

of  the  kensais  alignment,  to  an  organization  with  the  same

alignment and goals of the kensai, to the kensais deity, or even

to an ideal or principle the kensai upholds.

These  oaths  are  not  trivial,  and  prospective  kensai  who

at tempt  to  enter  the  prestige  class  with  broad  oaths  or  ones

deliberately easy to ful ll  nd themselves spurned and cannot

join the class at all, even if they meet the other requirements.

A  kensai  who  breaks  his  oath,  for  whatever  reason,  loses

access to his kensai special abilities and must receive an atone-

ment spell from a cleric or druid of his alignment to get them

back  and  to  continue  advancing  in  the  kensai  class.  A  kensai

must also strictly adhere to his alignment. A kensai who inten-

tionally and seriously violates his alignment also breaks faith and

endures the same negative effects.

This  dual  requirement  can  pose  a  serious  conundrum  at

times. If a lawful good kensai swears service to a lord who then

orders the kensai to perform an evil act, the kensai is caught be-

tween his oath and his alignment. He must violate one to ful ll

the other, and either way he needs to atone. If the kensai chooses

his alignment, he can break his oath, gain atonement, and swear

a new oath (often one relating to correcting his former lord).

He can then advance as a kensai again. If the kensai chooses his

lord, he changes alignment and must gain atonement from, in

this case, an evil cleric.

A  kensai  who  changes  his  alignment  from  lawful  loses  his

kensai abilities and cannot advance further in this class until he

gains atonement and switches his alignment back to lawful.

Ful llment of the Oath of Service: If a kensai ful lls an oath of

service, or if the terms of the oath no longer apply (for example,

if a kensai swears service to a king who then dies of old age, or if

a kensai swears to defeat an enemy power and then in the course

of adventuring defeats it), the kensai must re ect and then swear

a new oath. In general, a kensai can be between oaths for no

more than one week per class level. A kensai who does not swear

a  new  oath  before  the  grace  period  expires  is  treated  as  if  he

broke his oath of service.

DM  Note:  The  idea  of  the  oath  of  service  does  not  exist  to

punish a player who chooses to roleplay a kensai, but to chal-

lenge that player. The kensai is a powerful prestige class, and the

oath of service is one of the costs that goes along with it. You

should work with the player to come up with an oath that  ts into

your campaignone that provides the player with roleplaying

opportunities and you with a hook you can use to motivate the

entire party.

life force into his signature weapon. The signature weapon

then becomes a magic weapon (if it wasnt already) and gains

an enhancement bonus and/or special abilities. His current

class level limits the amount of enhancement a kensai can

place  into  his  signature  weapon.  A  kensai  cannot  create  a

signature weapon if doing so would cost enough experience

points to reduce his character level.

Use  the  table  on  the  previous  page  to  deter-

mine XP costs and class level limits.

If the ritual is interrupted, it can be

begun again at any time, but it must

run  for  a  full  24  hours  for  the

signature weapon to be imbued.

The  kensai  pays  the  XP  cost

as  soon  as  the  ritual  has  been

completed.

A kensais signature weapon

has a caster level equal to the

characters class level + 10.

Imbuing  Double  Weapons:

A  double  weapon  may  be

imbued,  but  both  ends  of  the

weapon  must  be  paid  for  and

imbued separately.

Imbuing  Natural  Weapons:

The  process  for  imbuing  a

kensais natural weapons (such

as his  sts) is the same as for a

manufactured  weapon,  except

all of the kensais natural weap-

ons  of  one  type  are  imbued

at  100%  of  the  cost  +  10%  per

natural weapon. For example, a

human kensai who has Weapon

Focus  (unarmed  strike)  may

turn  his  fists  into  signature

weapons for 120% of the XP cost.

A  six-armed  kensai  with  a  bite  and

tail  attack  would  have  to  choose  between

 sts,  bite,  and  tail  and  pay  either  160%  of

the cost (for six  sts) or 110% of the cost (for

the single bite or tail). A kensai who imbues a

particular type of natural weapon must imbue all his natural

weapons of that type (so a human kensai with two  sts must

imbue both  sts). It takes 24 hours for a kensai to imbue one

type of natural weapon, regardless of how many actual weap-

ons of that type he possesses.

Losing a Signature Weapon: If a kensais signature weapon

is lost or stolen, the character must strive to recover it by any

means  that  do  not  violate  his  oath  or  alignment.  A  kensai

who knowingly abandons a signature weapon is treated as if

he broke his oath of service (see the sidebar). A kensai who

abandons  a  signature  weapon  and  atones  for  the  deed  can

begin to create a new signature weapon.

If someone destroys a kensais signature weapon, only the

kensai can repair it. If enough is left of the weapon to salvage

(the shattered shards of a sword, for example), the kensai can

reforge  the  weapon  as  if  he  were  using  the  Craft  (weapon-

smithing) skill to make a masterwork weapon. If he takes the

reforged weapon and then meditates for 24 hours, he may pay

the appropriate XP cost to restore his weapon to full

strength.

Should nothing remain of the weapon,

the  kensai  must  begin  anew  with  a

weapon that has never before been

imbued. The character, however,

has not failed in his oaththe

destruction of a kensais weap on

in  service  of  his  oath  is  not

shameful,  and  other  kensai

are  likely  to  show  even  more

respect to a comrade whose

weapon  is  destroyed  in

oathbound service.

Losing  Natural  Weapons:

If a kensai loses his natu-

ral  weapons  (such  as  his

 sts),  he  may  have  them

regrown  by  using  regen-

eration  or  a  similar  spell.

In  this  singular  case,  the

kensai  does  not  need  to

spend  any  more  XP  or  time

to reimbue his signature weapon

with power. The link is direct enough

that no extra effort is necessary.

Power  Surge  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  a

kensai  gains  the  ability  to  make  a  DC

15 Concentration check as a move action

to focus his energy and spirit. If he suc-

ceeds,  he  gains  +8  to  his  Strength  for

a  number  of  rounds  equal  to  one-half

his  class  level.  Each  time  after  the   rst

that a kensai successfully uses this ability

in  a  single  24-hour  period,  the  check  DC

A kensai

increases by 5.

Ki Projection: At 4th level and higher, a kensai adds one-

half  his  class  level  (round  down)  to  any  Bluff,  Diplomacy,

Gather Information, or Intimidate checks he makes. At 8th

level and higher, the kensai adds his full class level to such

checks.

A target that realizes it has been fooled by a kensais suc-

cessful Bluff check gains a +10 bonus on any check or saving

throw involving the kensais use of Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather

Information, or Intimidate against that target in the future.

The  kensai  can  regain  the  creatures  trust  by  changing  its

attitude  from  unfriendly  to  friendly  (see  In uencing  NPC

Attitudes, page 72 of the Players Handbook).

Withstand (Ex): When a kensai of 5th level or higher is

forced to make a Re ex save to avoid damage from an area

effect spell (such as a  reball), he can make a Concentration

check instead of a Re ex save to resist taking full damage. If

a  kensai  has  the  evasion  or  improved  evasion  ability,  those

bene ts apply on this Concentration check as well.

Instill (Ex): Once per day, a kensai of 8th level or higher

may take a full-round action to make a Concentration check

(DC 10 + targets HD or character level) to impart some of his

own ability into a willing ally he can touch. The kensai then

transfers some of his power to the ally: He subtracts up to 1

point per class level from his base attack bonus and/or any or

all of his base save bonuses and transfers the same amount to

the recipient. The kensai regains the instilled power 1 hour

later,  when  it  transfers  back  out  of  the  ally.  If  the  ally  dies

before  the  instilled  power  is  transferred  back,  the  kensai

must make a Fortitude save (DC 5 + targets HD or character

level) or die as well. If he succeeds, he immediately gets his

instilled powers back.

Ki  Warlord:  When  a  kensai  attains  10th  level,  he  gains

great notoriety and becomes known as a ki warlord. Other

kensai of the same alignment revere the ki warlord, and even

those of differing alignments treat him with some measure

of respect. If the ki warlord has an NPC master, this master

likely assigns the ki warlord more responsibility and author-

ity within his domain (perhaps giving him a castle, monas-

tery, or military school). If the ki warlord serves a deity, that

deity may take a personal interest in giving the ki warlord

more  responsibility,  perhaps  actually  contacting  the  ki

warlord directly or through intermediaries and making the

deitys wishes known.

In addition to this added responsibility, a ki warlord gains

some  tangible  bene ts.  He  has  the  right  to  petition  other

(lower-level)  members  of  the  prestige  class  for  assistance

on  adventures  or  in  the  ful llment  of  his  oath.  As  long  as

a  ki  warlords  requests  do  not  violate  the  other  members

own  oaths  of  service  or  alignment,  lower-level  kensai  have

a  responsibility  to  assist  a  ki  warlord  in  any  reasonable

mannersuch as providing food and shelter, access to minor

resources, and other things another character might have to

barter for.

Ki  warlords  inspire  those  around  them.  When   ghting

within 30 feet of a ki warlord, allies gain a +1 morale bonus

on Will saves, Concentration checks, and attack rolls. Lawful

allies gain a +2 morale bonus on these checks.

Multiclass Note: A samurai, paladin, or monk who becomes

a kensai may continue advancing in his original class.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Shen may use a full attack action

to make one extra attack per round with an unarmed strike

or a spe cial monk weapon at his highest base attack bonus,

but this attack and each other attack made in that round take

a  1  penalty  apiece.  This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it

affects attacks of opportunity Shen might make before his

next action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham,

Shen can make the extra attack either with that weapon or

unarmed. If armed with two such weapons, he uses one for

his regular attack(s) and the other for the extra attack. In any

case, his damage bonus on the attack with his off hand is not

reduced.

Signature  Weapon  (Su):  Master  Shen  has  imbued  his

 sts,  giving  them  a  +5  enhancement  bonus  on  attack  and

damage rolls.

Ki Strike (Su): Shens unarmed strike can deal damage to

a creature with damage reduction as if the blow were made

with a magic weapon.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Shen  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that  nor-

mally allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half

damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Instill (Ex): Once per day, Shen can make a Concentration

check (DC 10 + targets level or HD) as a full-round action to

transfer up to 8 points of his base attack bonus and/or base

save bonuses to the recipient for 1 hour. If the recipient dies,

Shen  must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  save  (DC  5  +  recipients

HD) or die as well.

Power Surge (Ex): Shen can make a Concentration check

(DC 15, + 5 for each daily use beyond the  rst) to gain a +8

bonus to Strength for 4 rounds.

Purity of Body (Ex): Shen has immunity to all diseases

except for magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycan-

thropy.

Slow Fall (Ex): When within arms reach of a wall, Shen

can use it to slow his descent while falling. He takes damage

as if the fall were 30 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still Mind (Ex): Shen gains a +2 bonus on saving throws

against spells and effects from the enchantment school.

Wholeness of Body (Su): Shen can cure up to 30 points of

his own wounds per day, and he can spread this healing out

over several uses.

Withstand (Ex): Shen can make a Concentration check

rather than a Re ex save to avoid damage from an area effect

spell.

Possessions: Bracers of armor +4, 4 javelins of lightning, monks

belt, ring of invisibility, masterwork longsword.

KNIGHT OF THE CHALICE

Class Skills

The knight of the Chalices class skills (and the key ability

for  each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Diplo-

macy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (the planes) (Int),

Knowledge  (religion)  (Int),  Profession  (Wis),  and  Sense

Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the knight of the

Chalice prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Knights  of

the Chalice gain no pro ciency with any weapon or

armor.

Spells:  Beginning  at  1st  level,  a  knight

of  the  Chalice  gains  the  ability  to  cast  a

number  of  divine  spells.  To  cast  a  spell,

a  knight  of  the  Chalice  must

have  a  Wisdom  score

of  at  least  10  +  the

spells level, so a

knight  with  a

A  knight  of  the  Chalice  is  a  member  of  an  elite  knightly

organization  devoted  to   ghting  demons  and  other  evil

outsiders. Motivated by a pious hatred of these creatures that

embody the principles of evil and routinely invade the Mate-

rial Plane, knights of the Chalice learn tactics

and  gain  special  abilities  to  help  them  in

their crusade.

A  character  who  qualifies  for

entrance  into  the  Order  of  the

Chalice  is  typically  a  paladin/

ranger  or  a  cleric/ranger.  Char-

acters  with  minimal  levels  as  a

ranger/cleric or ranger/paladin

can  qualify  even  if  they  have

more levels in other classes

rogue,  fighter,  and  even

wizard  or  sorcerer.  Wizards

and  sorcerers  are  rarely

drawn  to  the  orders  cru-

sade, and cannot qualify as

knights  until  reaching

high  levels.  Few  monks

or  bards  have  enough

dedication  to  extermi-

nating demons to take

up this class.

Knights  of  the

Chalice  are  often  lone

crusaders,  maintain-

ing only loose connec-

tions  to  their  order.

NPC  knights   some-

times  gather  adven-

turing  bands  around

themselves  for  combat

support.  A  knight

of  the  Chalice  could

become  a  temporary

ally  of  a  group  of

adventurers  while  the

party  is  engaged  in  a

campaign against a demon.

Hit Die: d10.

A knight of the Chalice

Requirements

To qualify to become a knight of the Chalice, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Base Attack Bonus: +8.

Skills: Knowledge (the planes) 5 ranks, Knowledge (reli-

gion) 10 ranks.

Spells:  Able  to  cast  divine  spells,  including  protection

from evil.

10 or lower can not cast

these  spells.  Knight  of  the  Chal-

ice  bonus  spells  are  based  on  Wisdom,  and  saving  throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the knights

Wisdom modi er. When the knight gets 0 spells per day of

a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level

knight), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled

to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level.

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   53

9/12/03, 11:24:32 AM

The knight of the Chalices spell list appears below; he has

access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to

prepare. A knight of the Chalice prepares and casts spells just

as a cleric does (though a knight cannot lose a spell to cast a

cure spell in its place).

Fiendslaying (Ex): Knights of the Chalice gain a number

of special bene ts in combat with evil outsiders. A 1st-level

knight of the Chalice gets a +1 competence bonus on attack

rolls against evil outsiders. On a successful attack, she deals

an extra 1d6 points of damage due to her expertise in com-

bating these creatures. These bonuses increase as the knight

advances in level, as shown on Table 219.

A  1st-level  knight  of  the  Chalices  +1  competence  bonus

also  applies  to  Intimidate,  Listen,  Sense  Motive,  and  Spot

checks when she uses these skills against evil outsiders. She

gets the same bonus on Will saving throws against attacks

from evil outsiders, and on opposed ability checks she makes

against evil outsiders.

These bonuses all stack with the knights favored enemy

bonus (if any).

Censure  Demons  (Su):  Knights  of  the  Chalice  can

censure demons, much as clerics turn undead. Rather than

channeling positive energy, a knight of the Chalice channels

energy from the celestial planes of lawful good.

When a knight of the Chalice uses this ability, any demon

within  30  feet  must  succeed  on  a  Will  save  (DC  10  +  the

knight of the Chalices class level + the knight of the Chalices

Cha modi er) or be censured.

A censured demon whose Hit Dice are equal to or greater

than twice the knights class level is stunned by the knights

holy power for 1 round.

If  a  censured  demon  has  fewer  Hit  Dice  than  twice  the

knights  class  level,  it  is  stunned  and  must  succeed  on  a

second  Will  save  (same  DC)  or  be  sent  back  to  its  home

plane as if it had been the subject of a dismissal spell. Only

one demon may dismissed in this way by any single censure

demons attempt; if more than one demon is required to make

this second Will save, check for the demon with the lowest

HD  rst.

A knight may attempt to censure demons once per day for

every two class levels she possesses.

Courage of Heaven (Su): A knight of the Chalice of 2nd

level or higher is immune to fear effects cast or created by

evil outsiders. At 5th level and higher, a knight of the Chal-

ice is also immune to enchantment spells and effects cast or

created by evil outsiders, including charms and suggestions.

At 8th level and higher, these immunities extend to all allies

within 20 feet of the knight of the Chalice.

Consecrated Casting (Ex): When a knight reaches 4th

level,  spells  cast  by  the  character  on  evil  outsiders  become

more dif cult to resist. When the knight casts a spell that tar-

gets an evil outsider, add +2 to the knights caster level check

to overcome the targets spell resistance and +2 to the DC of

any saving throw the spell allows.

Holy Aura (Su): A 10th-level knight of the Chalice has the

ability to create a holy aura once per day that affects herself

only. The auras effect is as the spell cast by a 10th-level cleric,

but it wards the knight against the attacks, spells, and mental

in uence of evil outsiders only, and only evil outsiders can be

blinded if they strike the knight.

Multiclass Note: A paladin who becomes a knight of the

Chalice may continue advancing as a paladin.

Knight of the Chalice Spell List

Knights of the Chalice choose their spells from the follow-

ing list.

1st  Level:  bless  water,  bless  weapon,  detect  chaos,  detect  evil,

divine  favor,  doom,  endure  elements,  magic  weapon,  protection

from evil, remove fear, summon monster I.

KNIGHT PROTECTOR

The few, the proud, the knight protectors are martial char-

acters dedicated to restoring the ideals of knightly chivalry

before  they  fade  forever.  The  protectors  see  moral  decay

everywhere  they  look  in  the  world  around  them,  brought

on  by  a  lapse  in  ethical  behavior.  Like  paladins,  knight

protectors adhere to a rigid code of behavior that embraces

such values as honor, honesty, chivalry, and courage. Unlike

paladins,  the   rst  duty  of  knight  protectors  is  to  this  code

and the ideals for which it stands, rather than to a deity or a

holy order. A protector is expected to display these ideals in

all aspects of his behavior and throughout all his actions and

deeds, however arduous they may be.

Many knight protectors come from backgrounds of honor

and  loyalty,  such  as  other  orders  of  chivalry  or  the  service

of a powerful master. Paladins and ex-paladins are the most

common knight protectors, and clerics of lawful deities (such

as St. Cuthbert or Heironeous) as well as  ghters seeking a

higher  ideal  often   nd  much  to  appreciate  in  the  knight

protectors code of conduct. Members of most other classes,

particularly spellcasters, lack either the interest or the dedica-

tion to pursue this path.

NPC knight protectors are often found wandering alone,

looking  for  worthy  people  to  protect  or  idealistic  lords  to

serve. What little bond or organization exists between knight

protectors is extremely strongwhether a knight protector

was once a baron, a lowly liegeman, or a samurai, each feels a

kinship to his compatriots and a longing for better days.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  knight  protector,  a  character  must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful neutral or lawful good.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the knight protector

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Knight protectors gain

pro ciency with tower shields.

Defensive Stance (Ex): At the start of any turn when a

knight protector is within 5 feet of an ally who has fewer Hit

Dice  than  he  does,  the  knight  protector  can  transfer  up  to

2 points of Armor Class to the ally (making his own Armor

Class worse by the same number). The maximum number of

points  he  can  transfer  increases  by  1  for  every  three  levels

beyond 1st.

Shining Beacon (Su): A knight protector is the physical

and spiritual embodiment of high ideals. All his allies gain a

+4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects when they stand

within 10 feet of the character. If the knight protector is para-

lyzed, unconscious, or otherwise rendered helpless, his allies

lose this bonus.

Best Effort (Ex): The daunting nature of the knight pro-

tectors goals often requires special focus of effort. Beginning

at 2nd level, a knight protector gains a bonus on any one skill

check  he  makes,  once  per  day.  The  character  must  declare

that he is using this ability before he makes the skill check.

This bonus increases by 1 for every three levels beyond 2nd.

Iron Will (Ex): At 2nd level, a knight protector gains Iron

Will as a bonus feat.

Supreme  Cleave  (Ex):  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  a  knight

protector can take a 5-foot step between attacks when using

the Cleave or Great Cleave feat.

No Mercy (Ex): At 6th level, a knight protector gains the

ability to make one extra attack of opportunity per round (as

if he had the Combat Re exes feat and a Dexterity modi er of

+1). At 9th level and higher, the character can make as many

as two extra attacks of opportunity per round. This bene t

stacks with the bene t of the Combat Re exes feat.

Retributive Attack (Su): If an ally of a 10th-level knight

protector is rendered helpless or unconscious, the character

can make a retributive attack against the creature that felled

his ally. When making a retributive attack, the knight pro-

tector adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and

deals an extra 10 points of damage on a successful hit.

A  knight  protector  can  make  a  number  of  retributive

attacks per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum one),

but never more than one per round. He may make more than

one retributive attack against the same foe.

Multiclass  Note:  A  paladin  or  samurai  who  becomes  a

knight  protector  may  continue    advancing  in  his  original

class.

Ex-Knight Protectors

A  knight  protector  who  willingly  and  knowingly  violates

the code for no adequate reason loses all supernatural class

features of the prestige class and may no longer advance in

levels as a knight protector.

THE CODE OF THE KNIGHT PROTECTOR

A knight protector must be of lawful neutral or lawful good align-

ment, and must adhere to the orders code of conduct.

Support: The order supports its own. A knight protector can

expect to receive room and board, as well as a mount with ap-

propriate gear, from the order for as long as he remains in its

ranks and adheres to the Code.

The Code:

Courage and enterprise in obedience to the order.

Defense of any mission unto death.

Respect for all peers and equals; courtesy to all lessers.

Combat is glory; battle is the true test of self-worth; war is the

 owering of the chivalric ideal.

Personal glory above all in battle.

Death before dishonor.

warhorse  (see  page  45  of  the  Players  Handbook)  that  has  +2

Hit  Dice,  a  +4  bonus  to  natural  armor,  +1  Strength,  and

improved evasion. Mathurin has an empathic link with the

MASTER THROWER

Only a master thrower would invent a new style of  ghting

that  involves  cleverly  disarming  herself.  Thats  how  many

more  traditional  weapon  masters  think  of  master  throw-

ers.  Indeed,  many  master  throwers  see  those  who  dabble

in thrown weapons the same way. If a character tosses away

a hand axe, javelin, or dagger, he may end up facing his foe

with bare hands. Unless one is a monk, one should avoid that

situation at all reasonable costs.

Master throwers depend on quick re exes, good planning,

and, of course, deadly aim to survive in a world that values

brute strength over clever tactics. Members of this prestige

class establish a camaraderie that often overshadows align-

ment or cultural differences. This camaraderie wont prevent

two  master  throwers  from   ghting  each  other  if  the  need

arises, but it does give those individuals an incentive to  nd

peacefulor at least nonlethalways of settling their differ-

ences. Some orders have developed sigils or small signs they

can use to identify their members. Common sigils include a

hand gripping a dagger by its point, or a whirling handaxe on

a  eld of blue. Many master throwers make phantom throw-

ing motions with their hands as they enter combat, watching

their opponents to see if they return the sign.

NPC  master  throwers  like  to  frequent  cities  and  towns

where  they  can  demonstrate  their  abilities  for  others  and

pick up new tricks or pointers from specialists with differ-

ent weapons. Since such demonstrations can be made against

nonliving  targets  or  in  sport  hunting,  master  throwers  are

often welcomed at fairs and celebrations, where they use their

abilities to entertain. Some master throwers  nd service in

the city guard or as personal protectors of the very rich.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a master thrower, a character must ful-

 ll all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Sleight of Hand 4 ranks.

Feats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (any

thrown weapon).

Class Skills

The master throwers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft

58

(Int), Jump (Str), Perform (Cha), Profession (Int), Sleight of

Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Tumble (Dex), and Use Rope (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the master thrower

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Master throwers gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Quick  Draw:  At  1st  level,  a  master  thrower  gains  the

Quick Draw feat.

Thrown Weapon Trick (Ex): At 1st level and every two

levels thereafter, a master thrower chooses one of the follow-

ing thrown weapon tricks. Once chosen, the trick is a perma-

nent part of the master throwers repertoire and may not be

exchanged. A master thrower cannot choose the same trick

more than once. Each trick may only be used with a thrown

weapon for which the character has taken Weapon Focus.

Deadeye Shot: The critical multiplier for any speci c type of

thrown weapon increases by one (for example, a hand axe has

a critical multiplier of 4 instead of 3) when this ability is

used. The bene t of this ability does not stack with any other

effect that increases critical multipliers.

Defensive  Throw:  If  a  master  thrower  with  this  ability

succeeds  on  a  Concentration  check  (DC  10  +  number  of

threatening foes) before attempting to attack with a thrown

weapon  while  in  a  threatened  square,  her  thrown  weapon

attacks dont provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round. If

the check fails, her opponents get attacks of opportunity as

normal when she makes her attacks.

Doubletoss: A master thrower with this ability may, as a stan-

dard action, throw two weapons at one or two targets within

30 feet. The character may apply her full Strength bonus to

each weapon (instead of one-half her Strength bonus for the

off-hand weapon). The normal penalties for  ghting with two

weapons apply (see page 160 of the Players Handbook).

Palm  Throw:  When  using  little  thrown  weapons  (darts,

shuriken,  and  daggers;  the  DM  may  allow  other  weapons),

a  master  thrower  with  this  ability  may  throw  two  of  each

weapon with a single attack roll. Damage for each weapon is

resolved separately, but the master thrower does not apply her

Strength bonus to either damage roll.

Sneaky Shot: Just before making a ranged attack, a master

thrower  with  this  ability  can  use  a  move  action  to  make  a

Sleight of Hand  check opposed  by her targets Spot check.

If she wins the opposed check, her opponent is denied his

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against the attack.

Trip  Shot:  A  master  thrower  with  this  ability  may  use  a

thrown weapon to make a trip attempt against an opponent

farther than 5 feet away. The character makes a normal attack

against  the  opponent  with  a  thrown  weapon.  If  the  attack

succeeds, in addition to doing damage as normal, the master

thrower makes a Dexterity check with a +4 bonus opposed

by the opponents Dexterity check or Strength check (which-

ever ability score has the higher modi er). Other modi ers

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   58

9/12/03, 11:26:46 AM

A master thrower

may apply on this opposed check (see page 158 of the Players

Handbook). If the master thrower wins the opposed check, the

opponent is tripped. The bene t of this ability does not stack

with the bene t of the Improved Trip feat.

Tumbling  Toss:  When  wearing

light,  medium,  or  no  armor,  a

master thrower with this ability

can hurl a single thrown weapon

at  any  point  during  a  tumbling

attempt  as  a  standard  action.  If

the result of her Tumble check is

25 or higher, the master thrower

does  not  provoke  an  attack  of

opportunity  for  making  this

attack  regardless  of  how  many

opponents threaten her.

Two  with  One  Blow:  If  a

master thrower with this abil-

ity  uses  a  thrown  weapon  to

attack  two  opponents  adjacent  to

each other, she may take a 4 penalty on the

attack roll and attempt to hit both opponents at

once. The attack may hit either, both, or neither

opponent  depending  on  the  roll  and  the  Armor

Class of each opponent. Damage for each opponent

is resolved separately. If the attack roll results in the

threat of a critical hit, roll to con rm each critical hit

separately.

Weak Spot: A master thrower can gain this abil-

ity  only  after  reaching  5th  level.  When  using  a

thrown  weapon  against  a  target  of  her  size  or

larger,  the  character  can  make  a  ranged  touch

attack instead of a normal attack. If the attack hits,

the  master  thrower  does  not  apply  her  Strength

bonus to the damage.

Evasion (Ex): At 2nd level, a master thrower gains

the evasion ability. If she makes a successful Re ex

saving throw against an attack that normally deals

half damage on a successful save, she instead takes

no damage. Evasion can be used only if the

master thrower is wearing light armor or

no armor. A helpless master thrower (such

as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the

bene t of the ability.

If  the  character  already  has  the  evasion  ability,  he  gains

improved evasion instead. Improved evasion works like eva-

sion, except that while the character still takes no damage on

a successful Re ex saving throw, she takes only half damage

on a failed save.

Snatch Arrows: A master thrower gains the bene t of the

Snatch Arrows feat at 4th level, even if she does not meet the

prerequisites.

Critical Throw (Ex): At 5th level, a master thrower gains

the  Improved  Critical  feat  for  any  thrown  weapon  with

which she has Weapon Focus.

Defensive Throw (Ex): If Lessia succeeds

on a Concentration check (DC 10 + number of

threatening  foes)  before  attempting  to  attack

with a thrown weapon while in a threatened square,

her thrown weapon attacks dont provoke attacks

of opportunity for 1 round.

Sneaky Shot (Ex): Just before making a ranged

attack, Lessia can use a move action to make a Sleight

of  Hand  check  opposed  by  her  targets  Spot  check.  If

she wins the opposed check, her opponent is denied

his  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  against  the

attack.

Weak  Spot  (Ex):  When  using  a  thrown

weapon  against  a  target  of  Medium  size  or

larger,  Lessia  can  make  a  ranged  touch

attack  instead  of  a  normal  attack.  If

the  attack  hits,  she  does  not  apply  her

Strength bonus to the damage.

Evasion (Ex): If Lessia is exposed to any effect

that normally allows her to attempt a Re ex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Gnome  Traits  (Ex):  +1  save  DC  for  illusions,  +2  bonus

on  saves  against  illusions,  +1  bonus  on  attack  rolls  against

kobolds and goblinoids, +4 dodge bonus to AC against giants,

+2 bonus on Listen checks and Craft (alchemy) checks.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Lessia is exposed to any effect

that normally allows her to attempt a Re ex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw and only half damage on a failed save.

Improved  Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Lessia  cannot  be

 anked except by a rogue of at least 13th level.

Trap Sense (Ex): Against attacks by traps, Kurag gets a +2

bonus on Re ex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

MASTER OF THE UNSEEN HAND

Masters  of  the  unseen  hand  delight  in  crushing  their  foes

with  invisible  force,   inging  massive  objects  into  the  sky,

and disarming enemies with a single thought. Their mastery

of the craft of telekinesis makes masters of the unseen hand

potent and versatile combatants.

Originally  a  cabal  of  sorcerers  who  learned  to  push  the

limits  of  their  telekinesis,  the  masters  of  the  unseen  hand

are now a loose-knit group that includes outsiders and other

creatures with the ability to use telekinesis.

Sorcerers are the most likely characters to become masters

of the unseen hand, and some wizards take a level or two in

the class as well. A signi cant minority of the order are crea-

tures with the innate ability to use telekinesis, such as githy-

anki, ghosts, beholders, and even the occasional demon.

Because their abilities are suited to warfare, masters of the

unseen hand are often found in the thick of the  ghting, dis-

arming opponents with telekinesis and using it to hurl them

to the groundor even high into the sky. Some hire them-

selves out as mercenaries, attaching themselves to a group of

mid-level  ghters who want to catch their foes by surprise.

Requirements

To qualify to become a master of the unseen hand, a character

must ful ll all the following criteria.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast the telekinesis spell, or access to teleki-

nesis as a spell-like or supernatural ability.

Class Skills

The  master  of  the  unseen  hands  class  skills  (and  the  key

ability  for  each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),

60

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis),

and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  master  of  the

unseen hand prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Masters of the unseen

hand gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Improved  Caster  Level  (Ex):  At  1st  level,  a  master  of

the unseen hand begins his relentless focus on the power of

telekinesis. He adds his levels in master of the unseen hand

to his caster level (whether from actual spellcasting levels or

determined by the spell-like ability) when using his telekine-

sis ability. For example, a 10th-level sorcerer/3rd-level master

of the unseen hand casts telekinesis as a 13th-level caster, and a

blue slaad who is a 2nd-level master of the unseen hand would

use its telekinesis spell-like ability as a 10th-level caster.

Versatile  Telekinesis  (Ex):  A  master  of  the  unseen

hand learns to combine the three versions of the telekinesis

spell  or  ability,  switching  from  one  to  another  as  he  likes.

For instance, he can use sustained force for 2 rounds, then

switch to combat maneuver, then return to using sustained

force. The spell or spell-like ability ends after the  rst use of

the  violent  thrust  version,  however,  or  if  the  master  of  the

unseen hand is unable to maintain concentration.

Telekinetic Wielder (Ex): A master of the unseen hand

develops  the  ability  to  wield  weapons  with  his  telekinetic

power. By maintaining concentration on the combat maneu-

ver version of telekinesis, a master of the unseen hand of 2nd

level or higher can make a single attack with an unattended

weapon or one he is holding, moving the weapon up to 20 feet

before the attack. Resolve the attack as normal, except that

the weapons movement doesnt provoke attacks of opportu-

nity. The master of the unseen hands base attack bonus on

this attempt is equal to his caster level plus his Intelligence

modi er (if a wizard) or Charisma modi er (if a sorcerer or a

creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability).

Any weapon-related feats the master of the unseen hand has

(such as Weapon Focus and Power Attack) do not apply when

hes telekinetically wielding a weapon.

The weapon wielded can be one the master of the unseen

hand took from a foe on a successful disarm attempt.

Sustained  Concentration  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  a  master

of the unseen hand becomes adept at moving and  ghting

while maintaining his telekinesis ability. It only takes a move

action, not a standard action, to use the sustained force ver-

sion of telekinesis (or simply to maintain concentration so the

ability doesnt end). The master of the unseen hand can even

cast another spell while maintaining concentration on teleki-

nesis, but doing so requires a successful Concentration check

as if the caster were distracted by a nondamaging spell (Con-

centration check DC equal to the save DC of telekinesis). It

still takes a standard action to use the combat maneuver or

violent thrust versions of the ability, however.

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   60

9/12/03, 11:27:37 AM

Full Attack Telekinesis (Ex): At 3rd level, a master of the

unseen hand is as skilled in telekinetic combat as a  ghter

is  with  melee  combat.  When  using  the  combat  maneuver

version  of  telekinesis  or  wielding  a  weapon  telekinetically,

the master of the unseen hand can make a full attack, poten-

tially attacking, bull rushing, disarming, grappling, or trip-

ping more than once per round. Just as with nontelekinetic

attacks, the master of the unseen hand gains an additional

attack for every 5 points of base attack bonus

above +1 (using caster level for base attack

bonus as described in the telekinesis spell

description).

Improved  Violent  Thrust

(Ex):  At  4th  level,  a  master  of  the

unseen hands violent thrust ver-

sion  of  telekinesis  becomes  more

effective. He uses his caster level in

place of his base attack bonus when

making the attack roll, and he uses

his  Intelligence  modi er  (if  a

wizard)  or  Charisma  modi er

(if a sorcerer or a creature with

the  telekinesis  supernatural  or

spell-like ability) as a bonus on

damage  rolls  if  he  hurls  weap-

ons at the target. Finally, using a

violent thrust no longer ends the

telekinesis effect, but the master of

the unseen hand cant make another

violent thrust for 1d4 rounds.

Telekinetic Flight (Ex): A master

of  the  unseen  hand  of  4th  level  or

higher  can  use  the  sustained  force

version  of  telekinesis  to  lift  himself

and  willing  creatures  into  the  air.

With  a  move  action,  the  master

of the unseen hand can move 20

feet  with  perfect  maneuverability

and can move willing creatures as well.

The master of the unseen hand doesnt

have  to  move  all  the  creatures  hes  lift-

ing in the same direction, but any lifted

creatures  plummet  to  the  ground  if  they  move  more  than

40 feet from the master of the unseen hand. The master of

the  unseen  hand  can  lift  one  Medium  or  smaller  creature

(carrying  up  to  its  maximum  load)  per  three  caster  levels.

A  Large  creature  counts  as  two  Medium  creatures,  a  Huge

creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. Unlike

the form of  ight granted by the  y spell, telekinetic  ight

ends immediately and abruptly if disrupted by dispel magic

or a lapse in the master of the unseen hands concentration.

Without  telekinesis  to  support  them,  creatures  fall  to  the

ground immediately, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet

fallen (maximum 20d6).

Fling  Skyward  (Ex):  Rather  than  hurling  a  creature

toward another target, a 5th-level master of the unseen hand

can use the violent thrust version of telekinesis to hurl a crea-

ture  straight  up.  A  target  is  allowed  a  Will  save  (and  spell

resistance)  to  negate  the  effect.  The  master  of  the  unseen

hand can lift a creature into the air a maximum distance of

10 feet per caster level. At the beginning of the characters

next  action,  the  creature  falls  to  the  ground,  taking  1d6

points of damage per 10 feet fallen. Unlike other times when

a master of the unseen hand uses the violent

thrust version of telekinesis,  inging a

foe skyward immediately ends the

telekinesis effect.

Fling  Skyward  (Ex):  Malik  can  use  the  violent  thrust

version  of  telekinesis  to  hurl  a  creature  as  far  as  170  feet

straight up. The target can avoid being  ung if it overcomes

the attempt with spell resistance or if it succeeds on a DC 21

Will save. At the beginning of Maliks next action, it falls to

the ground and take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet

of  distance.  Flinging  a  foe  skyward  immediately  ends  the

telekinesis effect.

telekinetically, Mailk can make up to four attacks with a base

attack bonus of +17/+12/+7/+2.

Improved  Violent  Thrust  (Ex):  Malik  makes  violent

thrust attacks with an attack bonus of +23. If he hurls weap-

ons at the target, each one deals an extra 6 points of damage.

Using a violent thrust doesnt end his telekinesis spell, but he

cant make another violent thrust for 1d4 rounds.

Telekinetic Wielder (Ex): Malik can make a single attack

with an unattended weapon or one he is telekinetically hold-

ing, moving it up to 20 feet before the attack. He has a +23

base attack bonus and a +6 bonus on the damage roll.

Improved Caster Level (Ex): Malik casts telekinesis as a

17th-level caster.

Telekinetic  Flight  (Ex):  Malik  can  make  himself  and

four  other  Medium  creatures   y  at  a  speed  of  20  feet  with

perfect maneuverability as a move action. The lifted creatures

plummet if they move more than 40 feet away from Malik.

Sustained Concentration (Ex): Malik can use the sus-

tained force version of telekinesis as a move action, or simply

maintain concentration as a move action. If he casts another

spell while still concentrating on telekinesis, he must succeed

on a DC 23 Concentration check.

Versatile  Telekinesis  (Ex):  Malik  can  switch  between

the  three  versions  of  the  telekinesis  spell  at  will.  The  spell

ends when he stops concentrating on the spell or when its

duration expires.

MINDSPY

Success in combat relies on anticipating your enemys every

move. A mindspy knows how easy that can be if youre privy

to  your  foes  every  thought.  By  reading  the  minds  of  her

enemies, a mindspy knows exactly what theyre going to do a

fraction of a second before they do it. Eventually she learns to

probe deeper,  nding weak spots in her enemys training.

Because the class relies utterly on detect thoughts, most mind-

spies are creatures who have it as a spell-like or supernatural

ability usable at will, such as couatls, succubi, doppelgangers,

ghaeles, myrmarchs, leonals, mind  ayers, dark nagas, rak-

shasas, and green slaadi. Spellcasters sometimes take levels in

the prestige class if they can cast detect thoughts frequently,

or if they have a helm of telepathy to enable the mindspys class

features.

The  most  often  encountered  mindspies  are  elite  mind

 ayer or doppelgangers. There is rumored to be a secretive

Requirements

To qualify to become a mindspy, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast the detect thoughts spell or to use detect

thoughts as a spell-like ability.

Class Skills

The mindspys class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Intimidate

(Cha), Profession (Wis), and Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the mindspy prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Mindspies  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Anticipate (Su): Because she is reading her foes thoughts,

a  mindspy  knows  where  she  needs  to  block  and  how  she

needs to dodge before an attack from the foe arrives. In addi-

tion, a mindspy can detect weak points in a foes defense by

observing her enemys thoughts. At 1st level, a mindspy can

add  1  point  of  Charisma  bonus  (if  any)  per  mindspy  class

level  as  a  bonus  to  her  Armor  Class  against  attacks  from  a

foe whose surface thoughts she is detecting (if the normal 3

rounds passes and the target fails its Will save) as well as an

insight bonus on attack rolls against any foe whose surface

thoughts she is detecting. If a mindspy is caught  at-footed

or is otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this

insight bonus to her Armor Class.

Combat Telepathy (Su): By reading her opponents sur-

face  thoughts,  a  mindspy  can  anticipate  their  every  move.

She can make a Concentration check (DC 10 + damage taken

during the previous round) at the beginning of her turn. If

the  mindspy  succeeds,  she  can  maintain  concentration  on

detect thoughts as a free action. If the mindspy casts a spell or

uses another spell-like ability, detect thoughts ends.

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   62

9/12/03, 12:35:20 PM

Spherical Detect Thoughts (Su): A mindspy can widen

the  area  of  her  detect  thoughts  spell  or  ability  into  a  sphere

centered on her, rather than a cone. The radius of the sphere

is equal to the length of the cone.

Faster  Mindscan  (Su):  By  2nd  level,  a  mindspy  has

become  adept  at  tuning  into  others  thoughts  quickly.  In

the round when she activates detect thoughts, she detects the

presence or absence of thoughts and the Intelligence score

of  each  thinking  mind  in  the  area.  In  the  next  round,  she

detects the surface thoughts of any one mind in the area.

Multiple Surface Thoughts (Su): A mindspy of 3rd level

or higher can simultaneously detect the surface thoughts of

any two creatures who fail their Will saves. This means that

she gains anticipate bonuses against both of them. Once

per round as a free action, she can choose new minds to

listen in on. At 5th level, a mindspy can simultaneously

detect the surface thoughts of four creatures.

Instant  Mindscan  (Su):  At  4th  level  and  higher,

a mindspy can enter her enemies minds at the speed

of thought. She gains all the information from detect

thoughts  (presence  or  absence  of  minds,  Intelli-

gence scores, and surface thoughts) in the same

round when she activates the spell or  ability.

The mindspys enemies still get Will saves to

keep their surface thoughts secret.

attack rolls against foes whose surface thoughts it is detect-

ing, and the same bonus to Armor Class against attacks by

such foes.

Detect  Thoughts  (Su):  Sanjakilar  can  continuously  use

detect  thoughts  as  the  spell  (caster  level  18th;  Will  DC  16

uses another spell-like ability, detect thoughts ends.

Change  Shape  (Su):  Sanjakilar  can  assume  any  Small

or  Medium  humanoid  form  or  revert  to  its  own  form  as  a

Sanjakilar would revert to its natural form if killed. A true

seeing spell or ability reveals its natural form.

Instant  Mindscan  (Su):  Sanjakilar  gains  all  the  infor-

mation from detect thoughts (presence or absence of minds,

Intelligence  scores,  and  surface  thoughts)  in  the  same

round  when  it  activates  the  ability.

Sanjakilars enemies still get a Will

save to keep their surface thoughts

secret.

Multiple  Surface  Thoughts  (Su):

Sanjakilar  can  simultaneously  detect

within range who fail their Will saves.

It  can  choose  new  minds  to  listen  to

once per round as a free action.

Spherical  Detect  Thoughts  (Su):

Sanjakilar can use detect thoughts within

a 60-foot sphere centered on itself.

circumstance  bonus  on  Bluff  and

Disguise checks.

NATURES WARRIOR

Natures warriors are defenders of the wild, protec-

tors of the natural world . . . and often druids who

have  spent  too  much  time  in  wild  shape  form.

Members of this prestige class share a bond that transcends

race and outside appearance.

When a character gains the ability to naturally shift into

the form of a lower animal, she sometimes gains a perspec-

tive on life that makes her envy this adopted form over her

own. She may simply feel a stronger tie to nature while in

animal  (or  elemental)  form,  or  perhaps  she  longs  for  the

power such forms give her. Certainly she begins to develop

her abilities while in wild forms at the expense of the shape

she was born in.

Many people consider natures warriors to be loners or fanat-

ics, even less a part of the world than the most solitary druid

or ranger. Natures warriors, however, tend to be very commu-

nal.  They  often  communicate  with  each  othersometimes

through animal messengers, or even face to face, when they

can bring themselves to leave their territoriesand they keep

a careful watch on civilization. Natures warriors develop their

animalistic instincts more strongly than the behavior associ-

ated with societal learning, and do have a tendency to come off

as gruff or impatient with those who are not as in tune with

nature as themselves. It is not uncommon for a natures warrior

to spend days or even weeks in a single animal or elemental

form, or to shift from form to form regularly, without return-

ing to whatever humanoid form she started with.

Virtually  all  natures  warriors  begin  as  members  of  the

druid  class,  but  some  members  of  other  prestige  classes  or

creatures with the wild shape ability have adopted this class.

Many more militant druidsthose with levels in  ghter, bar-

barian, or ranger nd this class ideal for their purposes.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the natures warrior

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Natures warriors gain

no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

64

Spells per Day: At every even-numbered level gained in

the natures warrior class, the character gains new spells per

day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting

class  she  belonged  to  before  adding  the  prestige  class.  If

the character did not belong to a divine spellcasting class

before  attaining  2nd  level  in  the  prestige  class,  she  gains

a  druid  spellcasting  level.  In  no  case,  however,  does  she

gain any other bene t a character of that class would have

gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcast-

ing.  If  a  character  had  more  than  one  divine  spellcasting

class before becoming a natures warrior, she must decide to

which class she adds the new level for purposes of determin-

ing spells per day.

Natures Armament (Su): Upon attaining an odd-num-

bered  level  in  this  prestige  class,  a  natures  warrior  may

choose one of the following abilities. These abilities, unless

otherwise noted, are only applicable while the natures war-

rior is in wild shape form.

Armor of the Crocodile: The natures warriors natural armor

bonus  is  improved  by  +1  per  class  level.  This  is  an  actual

improvement, not an enhancement bonus.

Blaze of Power: While in  re elemental form, the natures

warrior is covered in a blaze of power, which functions as a

warm  re shield at a caster level equal to her druid level (if

any) plus her natures warrior level.

Claws of the Grizzly: The natures warrior gains a +3 bonus

on damage when using her natural weapons.

Earths Resilience: The natures warrior gains damage reduc-

tion 3/.

Natures Weapon: The natures warrior gains a +1 enhance-

ment bonus on attack rolls when using her natural weapons,

and her attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose

of overcoming damage reduction.

Robe  of  Clouds:  While  in  air  elemental  form,  the  natures

warrior may as a free action wreathe her body in mist and

clouds for 1 minute per class level (or until she dismisses the

effect). This gives her concealment, though it does not affect

her ability to see or act at all.

Serpents  Coils:  When  in  the  form  of  a  creature  that  nor-

mally  has  the  improved  grab  ability,  the  natures  warrior

gains  a  +4  bonus  on  all  grapple  checks  and  does  damage

equal to 1d8 + her Strength bonus after winning an opposed

grapple check.

Waters Flow: To use this ability, the natures warrior must

be able to use wild shape to take the form of an elemental.

Three times per day as part of a move action, the character

may transform her body into a  owing rush of water. She may

move at her base land speed while in this form but does not

provoke attacks of opportunity while doing so. She may do

nothing but move while in this form. At the end of her move,

she immediately changes back into whatever form she was in

prior to activating this ability.  She may use this ability while

not in wild shape form.

Wild Growth: The natures warrior gains fast healing 1.

Trackless Step (Ex): Beshya leaves no trail in natural sur-

roundings and cannot be tracked.

Trip (Ex) (Dire wolf shape only): If Beshya hits with her

bite attack, she can attempt to trip her opponent (+11 check

modi er) as a free action without making a touch attack or

provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the

opponent cannot react to trip her.

Wild  Empathy  (Ex):  Beshyas  wild  empathy  check  is

1d20+9.

Wild Shape (Su): Beshya can turn herself into any Small,

Medium, or Large animal and back again four times per day.

This  ability  functions  like  the  polymorph  spell,  except  as

noted here. The effect lasts for 6 hours, or until she changes

back. Changing form is a standard action and doesnt provoke

an attack of opportunity.

Wilding (Su): Beshyas druid levels and natures warrior

levels stack to determine wild shape abilities and wild empa-

thy checks.

Woodland  Stride  (Ex):  Beshya  may  move  through  any

sort of undergrowth at her normal speed and without taking

damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns,

briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manip-

ulated still affect her.

OCCULT SLAYER

The occult slayer is driven to confront any arcane or divine

spellcaster who crosses her path. Occult slayers believe that

mortals are too irresponsible to wield magic, and that those

who  dare  to  do  so  must  be  slain.  Spellcasters  who  become

occult slayers are considered to have seen the error of their

waysalthough they may still cast spells, they rely primar-

ily on their battle prowess and their ability to resist magical

effects to defeat their enemies.

The occult slayer comes into her own through exhaustive

training.  Every  regimen  she  performs  is  an  exercise  that

re nes her anger against spellcasters into martial skill. Each

occult slayer forms a preternatural bond with her masterwork

weapon  of  choice,  which  serves  as  the  instrument  of  her

vengeance.

This prestige class is ideal for individuals who have been

victimized by spellcasters and seek acceptable ways to oppose

them.  Most  occult  slayers  begin  their  careers  as   ghters,

although barbarians and rangers often take this path as well.

Monks  and  rogues  have  also  been  known  to  embrace  this

calling, but bards and paladins  nd the occult slayers preoc-

cupation with spellcasters sti ing. Clerics, druids, sorcerers,

and  wizardsthe  primary  targets  of  occult  slayerstend

not to adopt this prestige class, although such turnarounds

are not without precedent.

NPC  occult  slayers  seldom  form  organizations,  because

they have discovered that congregating in one place attracts

spellcasters  intent  on  making  preemptive  strikes  against

them.  Instead,  occult  slayers  discreetly  meet  from  time

to  time  to  exchange  information  about  spellcasting  oppo-

nents they have targeted for matches. Otherwise, the occult

slayer operates alone, traveling between venues in search of

matches  that  involve  spellcasters.  Because  of  the  inherent

discretion  that  occult  slayers  display,  a  candidate  for  this

prestige class must be chosen and trained by another occult

slayer who is willing to share her secrets.

Weapon Bond (Su): Any hit Harlech scores with his com-

posite longbow deals an extra 1d6 points of damage against a

spellcaster or a creature with spell-like abilities.

Animal  Companion  (Ex):  Harlech  has  an  owl  as  an

animal companion. Its statistics are as described on page 277

of the Monster Manual, except that Harlech can handle it as a

free action and share spells if the companion is within 5 feet

Auravision (Su): Harlech can see magical auras within 60

feet as a free action, but can tell only the number of different

auras, not their strength or school.

Blank Thoughts (Ex): Harlech can induce within him-

self  a  state  of  mental  absence,  thereby  becoming  im mune

to  mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,  patterns,

phantasms, and morale effects). He can suppress or resume

this ability as a free action.

checks and on weapon damage rolls.

the attitude of a sentient being. He rolls 1d20+4, or 1d20+1 if

attempting to in uence a magical beast with an Intelligence

score of 1 or 2.

ORDER OF THE BOW INITIATE

When asked, What is Truth?, an initiate of the Order of the

Bow picks up his bow,  res an arrow and, without saying a

word, lets his mastery of the weapon serve as the gauge of the

archers progress along the way. By learning the meditative

art of the Way of the Bow, the archer improves his discipline,

precision,  and  spirituality.  Order  of  the  Bow  initiates  see

their weapons as extensions of their being, and the use of a

bow as a spiritual experience.

Fighters are the most common initiates of the Order of the

Bow.  Rangers,  paladins,  and  even  barbarians  utilize  these

skills and philosophies as well. Some rogues and bards have

been known to enter the order, but they are rare indeed.

NPC initiates are most often encountered teaching others

the ways of archery or wandering the lands looking for true

challenges for their skill.

Class Skills

The Order of the Bow initiates class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Knowledge (reli-

gion) (Int), Ride (Dex), Spot (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are

class  features  of  the

Order of the Bow initi-

ate prestige class.

Weapon and Armor

Proficiency:  Order  of

the  Bow  initiates  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon

or armor.

Ranged  Precision  (Ex):

As a standard action, an ini-

tiate  may  make  a  single

precisely  aimed  attack

with  a  ranged  weapon,  deal-

ing  an  extra  1d8  points  of

damage  if  the  attack  hits.

When  making  a  ranged

precision  attack,  an  initiate

must  be  within  30  feet  of  his

target.  An  initiates  ranged  pre-

cision attack only works against

living creatures with discernible

anatomies. Any creature that is

immune  to  critical  hits

(including  undead,  con-

structs, oozes, plants, and

incorporeal  creatures)  is

not  vulnerable  to  a  ranged

precision  attack,  and  any

item or ability that protects

a  creature  from  critical  hits

(such  as  armor  with  the  forti -

cation  special  ability)  also  protects

a creature from the extra damage.

Unlike with a rogues sneak attack, the initiates target

does not have to be  at-footed or denied its Dexterity bonus,

but if it is, the initiates extra precision damage stacks with

sneak  attack  damage.  Treat  the  initiates  ranged  precision

attack as a sneak attack in all other ways.

The initiates bonus to damage on ranged precision attacks

increases by +1d8 every two levels.

An initiate can only use this ability with a ranged weapon

for which he has taken the Weapon Focus feat.

Close  Combat  Shot  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  an  initiate  can

attack  with  a  ranged  weapon  while  in  a  threatened  square

and not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Greater  Weapon  Focus  (Ex):  At  4th  level,  an  Order  of

the Bow initiate gains the Greater Weapon Focus feat with

a single ranged weapon for which he has taken the Weapon

Focus feat even if he has not attained 8th level as a  ghter.

Sharp-Shooting: At 6th level, an initiate gains the Sharp-

Shooting feat (see Chapter 3 of this book) even if he does not

meet the prerequisites.

Extended Precision (Su): A 10th-level Order of the Bow

initiates  senses  and  feel  for  the  shot  become  so

attuned that he may make ranged precision attacks

(and sneak attacks, if he has the ability) at a range

of up to 60 feet.

Ranged  Precision  (Ex):  As  a  standard  action,  Garrick

may  make  a  single  precisely  aimed  attack  with  a  ranged

weapon, dealing an extra 4d8 points of damage if the attack

hits. When making a ranged precision attack, Garrick must

be within 30 feet of his target. A ranged precision attack only

works  against  living  creatures  with  discernible  anatomies.

Any  creature  that  is  immune  to  critical  hits  (including

undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures)

is not vulnerable to a ranged precision attack.

Close Combat Shot (Ex): Garrick can attack with a ranged

weapon while in a threatened square without provoking an

attack of opportunity.

Half-Elf Traits (Ex): Immunity to magic sleep spells and

effects;  +2  racial  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  enchant-

ment spells or effects; elven blood.

PURPLE DRAGON KNIGHT

The famous Purple Dragons are regarded across the land as

exemplars of disciplined, skilled, loyal soldiers. Their reputa-

tion is deserved partly because of the heroic actions of their

leaders, the Purple Dragon knights.

Purple  Dragon  knights  develop  uncanny  skills  related  to

coordinating and leading soldiers. Most are  ghters, rangers, or

paladins, but a few bards, clerics, and rogues have been known

to become Purple Dragon knights. Sorcerers and wizards tend

to join the War Wizards, an elite brigade of  ghting spellcast-

ers allied with the Purple Dragons, while barbarians are too

undisciplined, and druids and monks lack the commitment

to measure up to the Purple Dragons exacting standards.

In general, NPC Purple Dragon knights are responsible for

leading the Purple Dragons on and off the battle eld. Player

character  knights  either  are  retirees,  special  liaisons  to  the

army,  or  recipients  of  honorary  titles.  A  characters  level  in

this  prestige  class  is  irrelevant  to  his  rank  in  the  military,

although  higher-ranked  knights  tend  to  be  of  higher  level.

It is not necessary to have this prestige class to serve in the

Purple Dragons at large, or even to be an of cer in their ranks.

Likewise,  a  Purple  Dragon  knight  might  serve  her  entire

career on detached duty, away from the unit as a whole.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Purple Dragon

knight prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Purple Dragon knights

gain pro ciency with tower shields.

Heroic Shield (Ex): A Purple Dragon knight can use the

aid another action to give an ally a +4 circumstance bonus to

Armor Class instead of the normal +2.

Rallying  Cry  (Su):  Up  to  three  times  per  day  as  a  free

action,  a  knight  can  utter  a  powerful  shout  that  causes  all

allies  within  60  feet  to  gain  a  +1  morale  bonus  on  their

next attack roll and increases their speed by 5 feet until the

knights next turn. Traditionally, this mind-affecting ability

is used when a formation of soldiers is about to charge.

Inspire  Courage  (Su):  This  ability,  gained  at  2nd  level,

has the same effect as the bard ability of the same name. The

knight makes an inspirational speech, bolstering her allies

against  fear  and  improving  their  combat  abilities.  To  be

affected, an ally must be able to hear the knight speak. The

effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the knight speak and

for 5 rounds thereafter. While speaking, the knight can  ght

but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell comple-

tion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word

(such as wands). Affected allies receive a +2 morale bonus on

saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale

bonus  on  attack  and  weapon  damage  rolls.  At  2nd  level,  a

knight may use this ability once per day; at 4th level, she may

use it twice per day.

Fear  (Su):  Once  per  day  as  a  standard  action,  a  knight

of  3rd  level  or  higher  can  evoke  a  fear  effect  (DC  10  +  the

knights class level + the knights Cha modi er) as the spell

fear,  using  her  class  level  as  the  caster  level.  Her  allies  are

immune to the effect.

Oath of Wrath (Su): Once per day as a free action, a knight

of 4th level or higher can select a single opponent within 60

feet and swear an oath to defeat him. For the duration of the

encounter, the knight has a +2 morale bonus on melee attack

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   70

9/12/03, 12:38:50 PM

rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks

made against the challenged target.

The effect is negated immediately if the knight uses a full-

round action to move away from the challenged opponent.

Final Stand (Su): Once per day, a 5th-level Purple Dragon

knight can inspire his troops to a heroic effort,

temporarily  increasing  their  vitality.  All

allies  within  10  feet  of  the  knight  gain

2d10 temporary hit points. This ability

affects  a  number  of  creatures

equal  to  the  knights  class

level + her Charisma modi er

and lasts an equal number of

rounds.

Multiclass Note: A

paladin who becomes a

Purple Drag on knight may

continue advancing as a

paladin.

wounds per day.

Low-Light  Vision  (Ex):

Ardalis  can  see  twice  as  far

as  a  human  in  starlight,  moonlight,

torchlight,  and  similar  conditions  of  poor  visibility.  She

retains  the  ability  to  distinguish  color  and  detail  under

these conditions.

Oath of Wrath (Su): As a free action, Ardalis can swear

to  defeat  a  single  opponent  within  60  feet.  She  gains  a  +2

saving throws, and skill checks made against the challenged

target. The effect ends if she uses a full-round action to move

away from the challenged opponent.

Rallying Cry (Su): As a free action, Ardalis gives each ally

within 60 feet a +1 morale bonus on its next attack rolls and

increases its speed by 5 feet until her next turn.

RAGE MAGE

At  rst, it seems like a contradictionan arcane spellcaster

that loses herself in a blind fury. Yet, the rage mage makes

for an interesting case, since her approach to magic is based

on the primal passion of magic more than the studious quasi-

scienti c  approach.  The  rage  mage  prestige  class  is  sure  to

enliven any campaign, because it raises fascinating questions

on the true nature of magic and magic use. But dont ask the

rage mage to answer those questions herselfshes not inter-

ested in the why, only the results.

A rage mage taps into the primal essence of magic, using

her  own  natural  anger  and  frenzy  to  channel  the  arcane

power in  ashy,  amboyant ways. Like the barbarian, the rage

mage is often the product of a less civilized society. All rage

mages must have at least some background as a barbarian (or

some other class that grants a rage or frenzy ability), as well

as training as a wizard, sorcerer, orvery rarelya bard.

Rage mage NPCs are usually found working with barbar-

ians. They tend to shy away from traditional spellcasters and

avoid the colleges and guilds where such individuals usually

gather.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a rage mage, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Feat: Combat Casting.

Spells: Able to cast 2nd-level arcane spells.

Special: Rage or frenzy ability.

Class Skills

The rage mages class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Concentration  (Con),  Profession  (Wis),  Spellcraft  (Int),

and Survival (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the rage mage pres-

tige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Rage  mages  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day: At every even-numbered level gained in

the rage mage class, the character gains new spells per day as

if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class

she belonged to before adding the prestige class. In no case,

however, does she gain any other bene t a character of that

class  would  have  gained,  except  for  an  increased  effective

level of spellcasting (but see spell rage, below). If a character

had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming

a rage mage, she must decide to which class she adds the new

level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Spell  Rage  (Ex):  A  rage  mage  can  cast  spells  while  in  a

rage, as long as the spells casting time is no more than 1 full

round. When she casts a spell of the abjuration, conjuration,

evocation,  necromancy,  or  transmutation  school  while  in

a  rage,  the  rage  mage  uses  her  character  level  as  her  caster

level. This ability only works when the rage mage is in a spell

rage.

While in a spell rage, a rage mage becomes reckless and

loses her some of her ability to defend herself. She temporar-

ily takes a 2 penalty to Armor Class. She can attempt Con-

centration checks to avoid having a spell disrupted, but cant

use  any  other  Charisma-,  Dexterity-,  or  Intelligence-based

skills  (except  for  Balance,  Escape  Artist,  Intimidate,  and

Ride) while in a spell rage.

A  t of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the

characters Constitution modi er. A rage mage can end her

rage  voluntarily.  At  the  end  of  the  rage,  the  character  is

fatigued (2 Strength, 2 Dexterity, cant charge or run) for

the duration of the current encounter (unless the rage mage

is 10th level, when this limitation no longer applies). A rage

mage can only  y into a rage once per encounter, and only

a  certain  number  of  times  per  day  (determined  by  level).

Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a rage mage can only

do it during her action, not in response to somebody elses

action.

Overcome Spell Failure (Ex): At 2nd level, a rage mage

learns to ignore some of the restrictive nature of armor. Her

arcane spell failure chance when wearing light or medium

armor decreases by 10%.

Rage (Ex): A rage mage can enter a rage one additional time

per day at 3rd level and another time per day at 8th level.

Angry  Spell  (Ex):  Beginning  at  5th  level,  when  a  rage

mage casts a spell of the abjuration, conjuration, evocation,

necromancy, or transmutation school while raging, the save

DC for the spell increases by +2. At 10th level, this increase

becomes +4.

Spell Fury (Sp): Upon reaching 7th level, a rage mage can

quicken one spell of 4th level or lower (as if she had used the

Quicken  Spell  feat),  but  without  adjusting  the  spells  level

or casting time. She may use this ability once during each

rage.

Tireless Rage (Ex): At 9th level and higher, a rage mage no

longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.

Warrior Cry (Sp): A 10th-level rage mage may scream out

a cry once per day as a free action on her turn and gain the

bene t of the Tensers transformation spell, with one exception:

She does not lose her spellcasting ability for the duration of

this effect. The rage mages caster level for the purpose of this

effect is equal to her character level.

ure chance when wearing light or medium armor decreases

by 10%.

Rage (Ex): +4 to Str, +4 to Con, +2 on Will saves, 2 to AC

for up to 8 rounds.

Spell Fury (Sp): Once per rage, Kalya can quicken a spell of

4th level or lower without adjusting the spells level or casting

time.

Spell Rage (Ex): Kalya can enter spell rage twice per day.

This allows her to cast spells whose casting time is no more

than 1 full round while in a spell rage, using her character

level as her caster level. The spell rage lasts for 6 rounds, or

until she wills it to end. Kalya is fatigued for the rest of the

current encounter when her spell rage ends.

RAVAGER

Feared by many and understood by few, the infamous ravager

is an individual who has dedicated himself to the service of

Erythnul,  deity  of  slaughter.  Living  a  life  of  violence  and

savagery,  the  ravager  seeks  to  spread  this  deitys  malignant

in uence wherever he goes, never resting long in one place,

lest the forces of good and law pursue him.

Ravagers  who  come  from  the  ranks  of   ghters  and

barbarians   nd  that  the  ravagers  offensive  capabilities

en hance their combat skills, while wizard, sorcerer, cleric,

and  druid  ravagers   nd  that  their  ability  to  cause  terror

in  their  foes  is  a  very  useful  defensive  measure.  Ravag-

ers  spend  much  of  their  time  with  others  of  their  kind,

roaming  the  land  in  small,  close-knit  warbands,  striking

unsuspecting communities without warning, and retiring

back  into  the  wilderness  to  plan  their  next  terrible  raid.

Sometimes the clergy of Erythnul commands a lone rav-

ager to undertake some mission or project that obliges the

ravager to join up with other individuals, but such alliances

are usually temporary and must be managed carefully, lest

they lead to quarrels or worse.

NPC ravagers are usually encountered in small warbands

of from two to six individuals, but sometimes a lone ravager

may be encountered when undertaking a special mission.

All ravagers are readily identi ed by the bizarre and fear-

some facial tattoos they wear to mark themselves as Eryth-

nuls instruments.

Hit Die: d10.

or no armor gains a +1 bonus on all grapple checks and

opposed Dexterity or Strength checks. This bonus increases

to +2 at 4th level.

Counter  Grapple  (Ex):  When  grappling  or  pinned,  a

reaping  mauler  of  3rd  level  or  higher  wearing  light  armor

or no armor can attempt either a grapple check or an Escape

Artist check opposed by his opponents grapple check to free

himself as normal. If he fails the check he has chosen, he can

immediately attempt the other check as a free action.

Sleeper Lock (Ex): At 3rd level, a reaping mauler learns

how  to  render  an  opponent  unconscious  with  pressure.  If

the character pins his opponent while grappling and main-

tains  the  pin  for  1  full  round,  the  opponent  must  make  a

Fortitude save (DC 10 + the reaping maulers class level + the

reaping maulers Wis modi er) at the end of the round or fall

RONIN

When a samurai or other noble warrior is exiled from the ser-

vice of his feudal lord, he may become a ronina masterless

warrior cast adrift in the world, but still clinging to the rem-

nants of his former life. Blade in hand, a ronin wanders from

job to job, trying to stay one step ahead of his enemiesand

the shame of his past.

The vast majority of ronin were once samurai; both game

rules and theme tie the two classes together. As with the sam-

urai class presented in Chapter 1 of this book, the ronin pres-

tige class has its roots in feudal Japan, but its an appropriate

choice in any campaign world that includes an Asian-themed

culture. Ronin is Japanese for wave-man, and ronin tend

to be inveterate wanderers. Even if an Asian setting isnt an

important part of your campaign, a ronin character may be a

traveler from a distant land, eager to put his dishonor behind

him and live out his days in a land where no one knows the

code of bushido.

Ronin are often found in the pay of less scrupulous feudal

lords.  Because  they  are  trained  in  the  art  of  war,  they  are

prized as mercenaries. Those who hire a ronin should watch

their employee closely. Almost every ronin has a failure of

honor in his past; most involve a con ict with their former

masters.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become a ronin, a character must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Feats: Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (bastard sword).

Special: Must have  ed or been exiled from the service

of a feudal lord, commonly for disobeying orders, displaying

rudeness  or  cowardice  at  a  crucial  juncture,  or  failing  in  a

crucial task.

Class Skills

The ronins class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff  (Cha),  Craft  (Int),  Disguise  (Cha),  Intimidate  (Cha),

Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nobility and royalty)

(Int), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the ronin prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Ronins gain no pro -

ciency with any weapon or armor.

Infamy:  The  ronins  reputation  for  dishonordeserved

or  notfollows  him  everywhere.  Whenever  someone  in  a

position  of  authority  has  heard  of  the  ronins  past  (usually

through a DC 10 Gather Information or Knowledge [nobility

77

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   77

9/12/03, 12:42:14 PM

and royalty] check), that persons attitude starts one category

worse than usual, and the ronin takes a 4 circumstance pen-

alty on all Charisma-based checks involving that person. The

infamy penalty applies only if the authority  gure knows the

ronins identity, so some ronin adopt pseudonyms or secret

identities.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  If  a  ronin  can  catch  an

opponent  when  she  is  unable  to  defend  herself

effectively  from  his  attack,  he  can  strike  a  vital

spot  for  an  extra  1d6  points  of  damage.  This

extra  damage  increases  by  1d6  points  every

third level (+2d6 at 4th level, +3d6 at 7th

level,  +4d6  at  10th  level).  For  com-

plete  details  on  the  sneak  attack

ability,  see  the  description  of

the  dark  hunter  earlier  in  this

chapter.

Banzai  Charge  (Ex):  The

ronin has cast away the code

of bushido and at least a

measure  of  his  own

honor,  but  his  heart

still  remembers  the

thrill  of  bravery.

When a ronin of 2nd level or higher charges

into battle, he can accept a variable penalty

to  his  Armor  Class  and  take  an  equivalent

bonus  on  the  damage  roll.  The  normal

2  AC  penalty  for  charging  still  applies

and counts toward the bonus, but the ronin

cannot  accept  a  penalty  smaller  than  2  or

larger than his base attack bonus. For example, a

2nd-level ronin making a banzai charge could

take a 8 penalty to AC in exchange for a

+8 bonus on the damage roll.

Bonus  Feat:  The  ronins  experi-

ence  in  battle  has  taught  him  many

tricks  and  techniques.  At  5th  and

9th  level,  a  ronin  may  choose  one

feat  from  the  following  list:  Far  Shot,

Improved  Precise  Shot,  Manyshot,  Mounted

Archery, Mounted Combat, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot,

Rapid  Shot,  Ride-By  Attack,  Shot  on  the  Run,  Spirited

A ronin

Charge, Trample. The ronin must still meet all the prerequi-

sites for the bonus feat.

Former Samurai

Ronins who possess levels of samurai (that is to say, are now

ex-samurai) regain some of their lost class features the more

levels  of  samurai  they  possess;  refer  to  the  accom-

panying table for details. High-level ronins retain

much  of  their  bushido  training,  even  if  fate  has

dealt them a treacherous blow.

Regained Abilities

The ronin regains any kiai smite class feature he once possessed as a samurai, and can use it just as any samurai

can.

As above, plus the ronin regains any staredown class feature (staredown, mass staredown, improved staredown) he

once possessed as a samurai, using it just as he did before he became an ex-samurai.

As above, plus an ex-samurai of this stature immediately gains a ronin level for each level of samurai he trades in. For

example, a character who has thirteen levels of samurai can immediately become a 10th-level ronin with all abilities if

he chooses to lose ten levels of samurai. The character level of the character does not change. However, with the loss

of samurai levels, the character might lose some of the class features granted by the samurai class. Thus, an ex-samurai

of 14th level could become a 4th-level ronin/10th-level samurai, but would lose the improved two swords as one, kiai

smite 3/day, and improved staredown class features.

Banzai  Charge  (Ex):  During  a  charge,  Urashima  can

accept a penalty to his Armor Class and receive an equiva-

lent bonus on the damage roll. The normal 2 AC penalty for

charging still applies and counts toward the bonus; the ronin

can accept a penalty as small as 2 or as large as 16.

Iaijutsu Master (Ex): Urashima is treated as having the

Quick Draw feat when drawing his katana.

Infamy:  Authorities  who  have  heard  of

Urashimas  past  have  attitudes  that  start  one

category  worse  than  normal,  and  the

ronin  takes  a  4  circumstance  pen-

alty  on  Charisma-based  checks

involving that person.

Kiai  Smite  (Ex):  When

Urashima  shouts,  his  next

attack  gains  a  +3  bonus  on

the  attack  and  damage

rolls. If the target of the

attack  has  immunity

to  fear  or  has  an

Intelligence  score

of  2  or  lower,  the

kiai  smite  has  no

effect.

Staredown  (Ex):

Urashima gains a +4

bonus  on  Intimidate

checks  (included  in  the

above  statistics)  and  can

demoralize  an  opponent  (as

described  in  the  Intimidate

skill description, page 76 of the

Players Handbook) within

Possessions:  +1

SPELLSWORD

The dream of melding magic and weaponplay is ful lled in

the person of the spellsword. A student of both arcane rituals

and  martial  techniques,  the  spellsword  gradually  learns  to

cast spells in armor with less chance of failure. Moreover, he

can cast spells through his weapon, bypassing his opponents

defenses.

Despite the classs name, a spellsword can use any weap on

or  even  switch  weapons.  Spellaxe,  spellspear,  and  other

appellations  for  this  prestige  class  are  certainly  possible

but not commonly used. The requirements for this prestige

class  make  it  most  attractive  to  multiclass  wizard/ ghters

or  sorcerer/ ghters,  although  bard/ ghters  can  meet  the

requirements just as easily.

Feared by other martial characters because of his ability

to use spells, and feared by spellcasters because of his ability

to cast those spells while wearing armor, a spellsword often

walks the world alone.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a spellsword, a char-

acter  must  ful ll  all  the  following

criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills:  Knowledge

(arcana) 6 ranks.

Feats:  Proficiency  with

all  simple  and  martial  weap-

ons  and  with  all  armor  (heavy,

medium, and light).

Spells:  Able  to  cast  2nd-level

arcane spells.

Special: Must have

defeated a foe through

force  of  arms  alone,

without  recourse  to

spellcasting.

Class Skills

The  spellswords  class

skills  (and  the  key  abil-

ity  for  each  skill)  are

Climb  (Str),  Con-

centration

(Con),

Knowledge  (Int),

Jump  (Str),  Profes-

(Wis),  and

sion

Spellcraft (Int).

Skill  Points

at Each Level: 2

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the spellsword pres-

tige class.

Spells per Day: At every odd-numbered level, a spell sword

gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an

arcane  spellcasting  class  he  belonged  to  before  adding  the

prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained (improved chance

of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item cre-

ation feats, and so on), save for an increased effective level of

spellcasting.  If  a  character  had  more  than  one  spellcasting

class before becoming a spellsword, he must decide to which

class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells

per day.

Ignore  Spell  Failure  (Ex):  Beginning  at  1st  level,  a

spell swords  hard  work  and  practice  at  merging  spellcraft

with weaponplay starts to pay off. As an extraordinary abil-

ity, he ignores a portion of the arcane spell failure chance

associated  with  using  armor.  This  reduction  starts  at  10%

and gradually increases to 30%, as shown on the class table.

A spellsword subtracts the given percentage value from his

total  spell  failure  chance,  if  any.  For  instance,  a  character

wearing scale mail and carrying a small shield normally has

a spell failure chance of 30%, but this drops to only 20% for

a 1st-level spellsword.

Bonus  Feat:  At  2nd  level,  a  spellsword  advances  his

art,  gaining  a  bonus  feat.  This  bonus  feat  must  be  either  a

metamagic  feat  or  one  drawn  from  the  list  of  bonus  feats

allowed to a  ghter (see Table 51 on page 90 of the Players

Handbook).

Channel Spell (Sp): At 4th level, a spellsword can channel

any spell he can cast into his melee weapon. Using this abil-

ity  requires  a  move  action,  and  the  spellsword  uses  up  the

prepared spell or spell slot just as if he had cast the spell. The

channeled  spell  affects  the  next  target  that  the  spell sword

successfully  attacks  with  his  weapon  (saving  throws  and

spell resistance still apply). Even if the spell normally affects

an area or is a ray, it affects only the target. The spell is dis-

charged from the weapon, which can then hold an other spell.

A spellsword can channel his spells into only one weapon at

a time. Spells channeled into a weapon are lost if not used in

8 hours.

Multiple  Channel  Spell  (Sp):  A  10th-level  spellsword  can

channel  two  spells  into  his  melee  weapon,  using  a  move

action  to  channel  each  one.  Both  channeled  spells  affect

the next target the spellsword successfully attacks with his

weapon, in the order the spells were placed into the weapon.

As with the channel spell class feature, saving throws and spell

resistance apply normally. Each time a spellsword uses mul-

tiple channel spell, two of his  ve channel spell uses per day are

expended.

Channel Spell (Sp): As a move action, Roland can channel a

spell he has prepared into his sword, thus using up the spell

as if it had been cast. The next creature he successfully hits

with the sword is affected by the spell (saving throw and spell

resistance applies). Only the target is affected by the spell,

even if its an area spell.

STONELORD

Dwarves know more secrets about stone than anyone. They

live  and  die  among  the  stones,  and  the  earth  whispers  to

themor at least to select individuals. These special dwarves

are known as stonelords. They use their connection with the

earth to draw from the in nite reserves of power within it to

help them perform amazing feats.

Fighters are the most common stonelords, although dwarf

paladins  and  rangers  adopt  the  mantle  as  well.  Though

uncommon,  dwarf  rogues,  clerics,  and  even  the  occasional

wizard or sorcerer become stonelords.

NPC stonelords work in dwarven communities as protec-

tors and leaders. Occasionally they work in groups, but even

then,  their  varied  backgrounds  and  chosen  powers  make

them all very different.

Hit Die: d8.

involving  immersion  in  sacred  loam,  long  fasting  periods

deep  underground,  and  the  ingestion  of  1,000  gp  worth

Class Skills

The stonelords class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge

dard action to heal her own wounds using a clump of mud.

This ability heals a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + her

Stone  Power:  At  every  even-numbered  level,  a  stone-

lord can choose one ability from the following list of stone

powers.  No  stone  power  can  be  chosen  more  than  once.

Unless otherwise noted, the stonelord uses her class level as

the caster level for these effects (the save DCs are Constitu-

tion-based). Using one of these abilities is a standard action

unless otherwise noted.

Earthgrip (Sp): Once per day, a stonelord with this ability

can use hold monster on any target touching the ground. If

the opponent is airborne or waterborne, the stonelord cannot

affect the creature with the spell.

with this ability (assuming she can cast spells) is considered

maximized  as  if  prepared  with  the  Maximize  Spell  feat,

although the spells level is unaffected. The spells level can-

not be higher than the class level of the stonelord. Using this

ability is a free action.

Earths Endurance (Sp): Once per day, a stonelord with this

ability grants herself a boost to her Constitution score as if

she were affected by a bears endurance spell for 1 hour.

Earths Strength (Sp): Once per day, a stonelord with this

ability grants herself a boost to her Strength score as if she

were affected by a bulls strength spell for 1 hour.

Earth Power (Su): Once per day, all melee attacks made in a

on the attack roll and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage on

a successful hit. Using this ability is a free action.

Earth Shadows (Su): Once per day per class level, a stone-

lord with this ability can create a  gment of a Medium earth

elemental that appears in a  anking position adjacent to the

stonelords opponent for 1 round. This ability allows the stone-

lord  to  make   anking  attacks  (+2  to  hit,  can  make  a  sneak

attack  if  such  ability  is  available)  against  that  opponent

during that round. Using this ability is a free action.

Gravity (Sp): Once per day, a stonelord with this ability can

use a slow effect (as the spell).

Stoneskin (Sp): Once per day, a stonelord with this ability

can give herself the bene t of a stoneskin spell (caster level

equal to the stonelords class level). The character must pro-

vide the material component as if she were actually casting

the spell.

Summon  Earth  Elemental  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  a  stone lord

with  this  ability  can  summon  an  earth  elemental  as  if  she

had cast a summon monster spell. The size of the summoned

earth elemental depends on the stonelords class level, as fol-

lows: 1st3rd, Small; 4th6th, Medium; 7th9th, Large; 10th,

Huge.

TATTOOED MONK

Certain  monastic  orders  bestow  supernatural  or  spell-like

powers  on  their  members  by  inscribing  magic  tattoos  on

their  skin.  These  tattooed  monks  shave  their  heads,  speak

in cryptic riddles and maxims, andin many casestravel

the countryside furthering their quest for enlightenment by

facing and conquering temptation.

The great majority of tattooed monks begin their careers

as monks. A small number of  ghters, druids, and even a few

clerics  adopt  the  tattooed  monk  prestige  class.  In  general,

tattooed monks are drawn almost exclusively from rural or

wild regions, though more civilized individuals who gain

the favor of the order are sometimes allowed to join.

The  ranks  of  the  tattooed  monks  are  divided  between

worldly monksthose who believe that temptation can only

be overcome if it is squarely facedand ascetic monks, who

rarely leave their mountaintop retreats. Player character tat-

tooed monks are assumed to fall into the former category,

but NPCs can be found in both roles. NPC tattooed monk

often  ful ll  roles  as  philosophers  and  mystics,  helping

others   nd  answers  to  esoteric  questions  and  solutions  to

unusual problems.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class

features  of  the  tattooed  monk

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency:

Tattooed  monks  gain  no  profi-

ciency with any weapon or armor.

Monk  Abilities:  A  tattooed

monks  class  levels  stack  with  his

monk  levels  for  determining  his

unarmed damage, AC bonus, and unarmored

speed bonus.

Tattoo (Su or Sp): Tattooed monks gain their powers from

the  magic  tattoos  that  eventually  cover  their  bodies.  A  1st-

level tattooed monk has one tattoo and gains another tattoo

at every odd-numbered level. A tattooed monk can choose his

tattoos from among those described below. Note that three

of the tattoos (centipede, crescent moon, and phoenix) have

minimum class level requirements.

All  tattoos  are  magical,  and  the  abilities  they  bestow  are

supernatural (except for the crescent moon). A tattooed monk

in an antimagic  eld loses all bene ts of his tattoos. Unless the

effect of a tattoo is continuous, activating a tattoo is a move

action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Arrowroot:  A  character  with  this  tattoo  can  heal  wounds

in another character by touch. Each day he can cure a total

number of hit points equal to his Wisdom bonus  his class

level.  A  tattooed  monk  cannot  heal  himself,  but  he  may

divide the curing among multiple recipients, and he doesnt

have to use it all at once.

Bamboo: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character

with this tattoo can add the number of tattoos he possesses

as an enhancement bonus to his Constitution score. This

bene t lasts for 1 round per class level.

Bat: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character

with this tattoo can add the number of tattoos he pos-

sesses as an enhancement bonus to his Dexterity score.

This bene t lasts for 1 round per class level.

Bell ower: Once per day per tattoo he possesses,

a character with this tattoo can add his Charisma

modi er as an enhancement bonus to any of his

ability  scores  (including  Charisma).  This  ben-

e t lasts for 1 round per class level.

Butter y:  Once  per  day  per  tattoo  he

possesses, a character with this tattoo

can add the number of tattoos he pos-

sesses as an enhancement bonus to his

Wisdom score. This bene t lasts for 1

round per class level.

Centipede:  Once  per  week,  a  char-

acter with this tattoo can use a shadow

walk  effect.  This  ability  allows  the  tat-

tooed monk to cross great distances,

but he must end his journey on the

Material  Plane.  A  tattooed  monk

must  be  at  least  5th  level  to  gain

this tattoo.

Chameleon: A character with this

tattoo can use an alter self effect once

per day per tattoo he possesses. This ben-

e t lasts for 1 hour per class level.

Crab: A character with this tattoo

gains damage reduction 2/magic. This

damage  reduction  improves  by  2  for

each additional tattoo he possesses.

A tattooed monk

Crane: A character with this tattoo

gains  a  gradual  immunity  to  bodily  decay.

When a tattooed monk  rst gains this tattoo, he gains immu-

nity  to  nonmagical  diseases.  When  he  gains  his  next  tattoo

(whatever it may be), he acquires immunity to poison as well.

When he gains his next tattoo, he no longer takes ability score

penalties  for  aging,  and  he  cannot  be  magically  aged.  (Any

aging penalties he may already have incurred remain in place.)

Bonuses still accrue, and the tattooed monk still dies of old age

when his time is up.

Chrysanthemum:  Every  hour  that  a  character  with  this

tattoo is in direct sunlight, he heals a number of hit points

equal to his level. A daylight spell does not provoke this fast

healing; the character must be exposed to real sunlight.

Dragon: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character

with this tattoo can use  re breath as if he had drunk an elixir

of  re breath (see page 255 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Dragon y: Once per day, a character with this tattoo gains

a dodge bonus to his AC equal to the number of tattoos he

possesses. This bene t lasts for 1 round per class level.

Falcon: A character with this tattoo is immune to fear (mag-

ical or otherwise). Allies within 10 feet of his gain a morale

bonus on their saving throws against fear effects equal to the

tattooed monks Charisma bonus (if any) plus the number of

tattoos he possesses.

Lion: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character with

this tattoo can smite a foe, gaining a +4 bonus on the attack

roll and a bonus on the damage roll equal to his class level on

a single melee attack. The tattooed monk must declare the

smite before making the attack. A missed attack uses up the

attempt.

Monkey: A character with this tattoo gains a +1 competence

bonus per tattoo he possesses on all Balance, Climb, Escape

Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Open  Lock,  Sleight  of

Hand, and Tumble checks.

Moon, Crescent: Once per day, a character with this tattoo

can use ethereal jaunt as a spell-like ability. A tattooed monk

must be at least 9th level to gain this tattoo.

Moon, Full: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a charac-

ter with this tattoo can gain a +2 luck bonus on a single attack

roll, skill check, or ability check, as he calls on the power of

the full moon. This ability cannot be used during daylight

hours.

Mountain: A character with this tattoo can activate it to take

on the immovability of a mountain for as much as 1 round

per  class  level,  gaining  phenomenal  durability  though  he

cannot move from the spot where he stands. He gains a +4

bonus to his Constitution and Wisdom scores. The increase

in Constitution increases the tattooed monks hit points by

2  points  per  level,  but  these  hit  points  go  away  when  the

abilitys  duration  expires  or  when  the  character  chooses  to

end it (a free action). These extra hit points are not lost  rst

the way temporary hit points are. While using this ability, the

tattooed  monk  takes  a  20  penalty  on  any  Dexterity-based

skill checks. He is immune to bull rush and trip attacks. The

tattooed monk may use this ability once per day per tattoo he

possesses.

Nightingale: A character with this tattoo can heal wounds,

either his own or others. He can heal a number of hit points

of damage equal to twice his current class level each day, and

he can spread this healing out among several uses.

Ocean: A character with this tattoo never needs to eat, sleep,

or drink.

Phoenix: A character with this tattoo gains spell resistance

equal to his class level + 15. A tattooed monk must be at least

7th level to gain this tattoo.

Pine: A character with this tattoo gains the Remain Con-

scious feat.

Scorpion: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character

with this tattoo can force an opponent attacking him to use

his lowest ability score modi er instead of his Strength or

Dexterity score modi er when making his attack roll. The

character can activate this tattoo on his opponents turn, but

he must declare it before the success or failure of the attack is

determined. The tattooed monk must be aware of the attack

and not  at-footed in order to use this ability.

Spider: To use this tattoo, a character must have the Stun-

ning Fist feat. Instead of a stunning  st attack, a character

with  this  tattoo  can  make  an  attack  that  delivers  a  contact

poison.  The  poisons  save  DC  is  equal  to  10  +  the  tattooed

monks  class  level  +  his  Con  modi er.  The  poisons  initial

and secondary damage is 2 points of Constitution damage.

Using this tattoo counts as one of the characters stunning

 st attacks for that day.

Sun: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character with

this tattoo can gain a +2 luck bonus on a single attack roll,

skill  check,  or  ability  check,  as  he  calls  on  the  full  power

of  the  sun.  This  ability  can  only  be  used  during  daylight

hours.

Tiger: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character with

this tattoo can  ght unarmed with a +1 bonus on all attack

rolls and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with a successful

attack. This burst of martial arts ferocity lasts for 1 round per

class level.

Tortoise: Once per day per tattoo he possesses, a character

with this tattoo can use his class level as the number of ranks

in  a  skill  he  does  not  possess  for  the  purpose  of  one  skill

check. For example, a 4th-level tattooed monk with two tat-

toos can make up to two Use Magic Device checks as if he

had 4 ranks in that skill. He adds his Charisma modi er to

the skill check as usual.

Unicorn: A character with this tattoo gains the power of

good  fortune,  usable  once  per  day.  This  ability  allows  the

tattooed monk to reroll one d20 roll that he has just made.

The character must take the result of the reroll, even if its

worse than the original roll. The character must declare the

reroll before the result of the original roll has been deter-

mined.

Wasp:  Once  per  day  per  tattoo  he  possesses,  a  character

with this tattoo can use haste on herself. The bene t lasts for

1 round per class level.

White Mask: A character with this tattoo is immune to detect

thoughts, detect lies, and any attempt to magically discern his

alignment. He gains a +10 bonus on all Bluff checks.

Multiclass Note: A monk who becomes a tattooed monk

may continue advancing as a monk.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Akulya may use a full attack action

or a spe cial monk weapon at his highest base attack bonus,

but this attack and each other attack made in that round take

a  1  penalty  apiece.  This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it

affects attacks of opportunity Akulya might make before his

next action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham,

Akulya can make the extra attack either with that weapon or

unarmed. If armed with two such weapons, he uses one for

his regular attack(s) and the other for the extra attack. In any

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Akulya  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally allows his to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half

damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Lion Tattoo (Su): This tattoo gives Akulya the ability to

smite a foe, gaining a +4 bonus on a single melee attack and a

smite attempt up to four times per day.

spell resistance 22.

except for magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycan-

thropy.

and effects from the enchantment school.

armor +2, gauntlets of ogre power +2, masterwork nunchaku.

While the Red Wizards of Thay are not opposed to blasting

their opponents with deadly spells or shredding the minds

of their enemies with dark magic, there are times when they

need  protectors  who  have  mastered  the  art  of  swordplay.

These protectors are the Thayan knights, familiar with magic

and loyal to none but the tattooed mages.

The Thayan knights act as bodyguards and enforcers for

the Red Wizards (see page 193 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

They  lead  common  Thayan  troops  into  battle  and  help

guard the wizard enclaves. Although they are referred to as

knights, they have no code of conduct, and the only rule that

binds them is that their lives are worth nothing compared to

the safety of the Red Wizards.

Almost  all  Thayan  knights  are   ghters,  although  monks

and rangers have been known to pursue this career. Barbar-

ians are typically too reckless to concentrate on defense, and

the Red Wizards consider other individuals too weak to per-

form the duties of a Thayan knight.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become a Thayan knight, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Race: Human.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills:  Intimidate  2  ranks,  Knowledge  (arcana)  2  ranks,

Knowledge (local Thay) 2 ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, Weapon Focus (longsword).

Special: Sworn allegiance to the Red Wizards of Thay.

Class Skills

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:

Thayan knights gain pro ciency with

tower shields.

Horrors  of  Thay  (Ex):  Because  of

long exposure to the cruelty of her homeland, a Thayan

knight  gains  a  +2  morale  bonus  on  saving  throws  against

fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against

charm effects. At 4th level, these bonuses increase to +4 and

+2, respectively. None of these bonuses apply against attacks

from Red Wizards.

Zulkirs Favor (Su): At 1st level, a Thayan knight under-

goes  a  long  and  painful  tattooing  ritual.  A  magic  tattoo,

placed  either  on  the  back  or  the  forehead,  provides  a  +2

resistance bonus on Re ex saves. The tattoo also marks the

knight  as  someone  loyal  to  the  Red  Wizards.  The  knight

automatically fails any

saving throw against a

mind-affecting  spell  cast

by a Red Wizard. When the tattoo is

visible, the knight gains a +2 morale

bonus on Intimidate checks as an extraordinary ability.

Zulkirs Defender (Ex): A Thayan knight of 2nd level or

higher gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage

rolls against any creature that attacks her or that she has pre-

viously seen attack a Red Wizard.

Fighter  Feat:  At  3rd  level,  a  Thayan  knight  may  choose

any one feat except Weapon Specialization from the  ghter

bonus  feat  list  (see  Table  51,  page  90  of  the  Players  Hand-

book).

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

WORLD-SPECIFIC PRESTIGE CLASSES

Creating prestige classes speci c to your campaign setting is an

excellent way to give depth to the world and  avor to the prestige

class. Virtually all the prestige classes in this book come from

world-speci c backgrounds but the designers made them more

generic to the implicit world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game so

that you could  t them into your chosen campaign setting with

as little dif culty as possible. Prestige classes such as the bear

warrior and the tattooed monk, for example, were originally part

of the Oriental Adventures campaign sourcebook but have been

integrated into the core D&D experience.

The Thayan knight, however, is an example of a world-spe-

ci c prestige class the designers chose not to make generic. It

is a prestige class taken from the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Setting  and  shows  its  roots  clearly.  The  reason  the  designers

chose not to strip out this world  avor is twofold. First, it pro-

vides an excellent example of how a prestige class can re ect

the world and culture it belongs to; second, the Thayan knight

represents a classic fantasy archetypethe warrior-henchman

of a powerful wizardly cabal. Most D&D campaign settings have

cultures or organizations similar to the Red Wizards of Thay,

so even if you do not play in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, you

should have no dif culty customizing the Thayan knight to your

own game setting. To do so, look  rst at the requirements (the

Red Wizards are xenophobic, hence the racial requirement) and

then  work  your  way  down.  While  the  Thayan  knights  special

abilities  have  speci c  names,  you  should  have  no  dif culty

establishing equivalents in your own campaign world.

Final  Stand  (Su):  Once  per  day  as  a  standard  action,  a

Thayan knight of 4th level or higher can inspire her troops.

Allies within 10 feet of the knight gain 2d10 temporary hit

points. This ability affects a number of creatures equal to the

knights class level + the knights Charisma modi er and lasts

the same number of rounds.

Zulkirs  Champion  (Su):  A  5th-level  Thayan  knight

receives a large magic tattoo across her face, signifying her

devotion to the protection of the Red Wizards. Once per day,

she can add a +2 luck bonus on a single saving throw. This

bonus  can  be  taken  after  the  die  is  rolled  and  after  other

modi ers have been applied to the roll. When the tattoo is

visible,  the  knight  gains  a  +4  morale  bonus  on  Intimidate

checks as an extraordinary ability.

WAR CHANTER

The roar of battle, the screams of the dying, the howl of the

warriors cry . . . these are all notes in the music composed by

the war chanter. His music  ows across the battle eld like a

raging torrent, catching friends and foes alike in its wake.

Bards of particularly militant mindsets become war chant-

ers (giving up their spellcasting ability in the process), and

among barbarians, war chanters are often the leaders or elite

warriors of a tribe. The music of a war chanter inspires those

around him and pushes them to greater heights of strength

and deeds of valor.

Fighters  and  barbarians  sometimes  gain  a  few  levels  of

bard in qualifying for this prestige class. Paladins and monks

cannot join because of the alignment requirement, but mem-

bers of both those classes respect the leadership and military

qualities of the war chanter class.

NPC war chanters are usually leaders of small warbands.

It  is  not  unusual  to  see  them  as  chief  lieutenants  in  larger

groups. They function best when surrounded by lesser allies,

but can be encountered on their own as well.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  war  chanter

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: War chanters gain no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Inspire Toughness (Su): A war chanter with 9 or more

ranks in Perform (sing) or Perform (oratory) can use her song

or poetics to impart a kind of berserk resiliency on hher allies

(including himself). To be affected, an ally must be able to

hear the war chanter sing (or speak). The effect lasts for as

long as the ally hears the war chanter sing and for 5 rounds

thereafter. An affected ally receives +2 temporary hit points

for  every  class  level  of  the  war  chanter.  At  6th  level  and

higher, a war chanter also grants affected allies the bene t of

the Diehard feat when using this ability.

War Chanter Music: War chanter music follows the same

rules as bardic music (see page 29 of the Players Handbook). War

chanter levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of deter-

mining how often a character can use war chanter music or

bardic music. War chanter levels do not stack with bard levels

for determining which songs a bard has access to.

Inspire  Recklessness  (Su):  A  War  chanter  of  3rd  level

or higher with 12 or more ranks in any Perform skill can use

her song or poetics to inspire an often dangerous, but very

effective,  ferocity  in  one  of  her  allies  within  60  feet  (or  in

himself). The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the war

chanter sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally (or

the war chanter herself) is inspired to recklessness, gaining

the ability to decrease her Armor Class by a number less than

or equal to her base attack bonus and add the same number to

her melee attack rolls as a morale bonus.

On her action, before making any attack rolls in a round,

the  affected  character  must  choose  to  subtract  a  number

from her Armor Class and add the same number to all melee

attack rolls (this number may be 0). The penalty to Armor

Class and the bonus on attack rolls apply until the characters

next action.

Combine Songs (Su): A war chanter of 5th level or higher

with 12 or more ranks in any Perform skill can combine two

types  of  bardic  music  or  war  chanter  music  to  provide  the

bene ts  of  both  (normal  stacking  rules  for  bonus  types

apply).

Inspire  Awe  (Su):  A  war  chanter  of  7th  level  or  higher

with 15 or more ranks in any Perform skill can inspire uneas-

iness, fear, or even terror in her foes. To be affected, a foe must

be within 60 feet of the war chanter and must be able to hear

the war chanter. Foes get a Will save (DC 10 + war chanters

class level + war chanters Cha modi er) to resist the effect.

The severity of the effect depends on the difference between

the foes Hit Dice and the war chanters Hit Dice (character

level). Subtract the foes HD from the war chanters HD and

consult the following table.

The  effect  lasts  for  as  long  as  the  foe  can  hear  the  war

chanter and 1 round thereafter. If a foes hearing of the war

chanters song is interrupted, the foe needs to make another

saving throw when he hears the war chanters song again.

HD Difference

+10 or more

+1 to +9

0 to 5

6 or less

Effect

Foe is paralyzed with fear

Foe is panicked

Foe is frightened

Foe is shaken

Singing Shout (Su): When a war chanter of 8th level or

higher engages in battle, he often lets out a singing shout as a

standard action. All allies (including herself) within a 60-foot

radius who can hear the war chanter gain a +4 enhancement

bonus to Strength for a number of rounds equal to one-half

the class level of the war chanter.

Inspire  Legion  (Su):  A  10th-level  war  chanter  with  18

or more ranks in any Perform skill can unite her allies and

make them  ght better together. To be affected, an ally must

be within 60 feet of the war chanter and must be able to hear

the war chanter. Only allies who meet these requirements at

the beginning of the song are affected, and an ally whose hear-

ing is interrupted or who moves more than 60 feet away from

the war chanter cannot rejoin the same song. The effect lasts

as long as the affected characters can hear the war chanter and

stay within range.

When  the  war  chanter  begins  singing,  determine  the

best  base  attack  bonus  among  all  the  affected  characters.

All  affected  characters  use  this  base  attack  bonus  or  the

war  chanters  character  level  as  their  base  attack  bonus  for

the duration of the effect. All affected characters gain a +2

competence bonus on damage rolls as well.

9/12/03, 12:46:43 PM

Countersong  (Su):  Firreli  can  counter  magical  effects

that depend on sound by making a Perform check for each

round  of  countersong.  Any  creature  within  30  feet  of  her

who  is  affected  by  a  sonic  or  language-dependent  magical

attack may use Firrelis Perform check result in place of his

or  her  saving  throw  if  desired.  Countersong  lasts  for

10 rounds.

Fascinate (Sp): Firreli can cause up to two crea-

tures  within  90  feet  that  can  see  and  hear  her

to become fascinated with her (sit quietly,

4 penalty on skill checks made as reac-

tions, such as Listen and Spot checks).

Firrelis  Perform  check  result  is  the

opponents Will save DC.

Half-Elf  Traits  (Ex):  Immunity

to magic sleep spells and effects; +2

bonus  on  saving  throws  against

enchantments; elven blood.

Inspire  Awe  (Su):  Foes

within  60  feet  of  Firreli

must  make  a  DC  21  Will

save  or  be  paralyzed

with  fear  if  they  have

3 HD or less, panicked

if they have 4 to 12 HD,

frightened if they have

13 to 18 HD, and shaken

if they have 19 HD or more.

The effect lasts for as long

as the foe can hear Fir-

reli  and  for  1  round

thereafter.

Inspire Competence

(Su):  An  ally  within  30

feet  who  can  see  and  hear

Firreli  gets  a  +2  compe-

tence bonus on skill

checks.

Inspire

Courage

(Su):  Allies

(including

Firrel  who

hear  Firreli

sing receive a +1

against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus  on

attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.

Inspire Recklessness (Su): An ally within 60 feet who

can hear Firreli can decrease his Armor Class by a number

less than or equal to his base attack bonus and take the same

number as a morale bonus on melee attack rolls. The effect

lasts as long as Firreli sings and for 5 rounds thereafter.

Inspire  Toughness  (Su):  Allies  (including  Firreli)  who

hear  Firreli  sing  receive  +14  temporary  hit  points  and  the

A war chanter

bene t of the Diehard feat, both of which last for as long as

Firreli sings and for 5 rounds thereafter.

Low-Light  Vision  (Ex):  Firreli  can  see  twice  as  far  as  a

human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar condi-

tions of poor visibility. She retains the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Suggestion  (Sp):  Firreli  can  make  a

suggestion  (as  the  spell)  to  a  crea-

ture  she  has  already  fascinated.

A  DC  17  Will  save  negates

the effect.

WARSHAPER

Most  martial  characters  rely

on  manufactured  gear  such

as  a  sword  and  a  shield  or

natural  endowments  such  as

teeth  and  claws  to  survive  on

the battle eld. The warshaper

 nds those options sadly lim-

iting,  instead  growing  and

evolving  her  own  weapons

and  armor  to  suit  the  threat

at  hand.  Blessed  with  the

ability  to  change  form

at  a  moments  notice,

warshapers  delight  in

surprising their foes by

growing  massive  claws,

armored  skin,  or  other

unpleasant surprises.

Warshapers  must  have  some  ability

to change their form, and many are shapechangers such as

doppelgangers  and  lycanthropes.  Wizards  and  sorcerers

who know the polymorph spell can take levels in the prestige

class, as can druids who have mastered the wild shape class

feature.

Most  warshapers  can  change  their  outward  appearance

in the blink of an eye, so they dont stand out among the

ranks of their allies. Its not until the soldier youre  ghting

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Special: Must be able to change shape in one of the follow-

ing  ve ways:

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  warshaper

prestige  class.  The  class  features  function  only  when  the

warshaper is in a form other than her own (which for doppel-

ganger and phasm warshapers is most of the time).

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Warshapers  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Morphic  Immunities  (Ex):  A  warshaper  is  adept  at

distributing her forms vital organs around her body to keep

them safe from harm. Warshapers are immune to stunning

and critical hits.

Morphic Weapons (Su): As a move action, a warshaper

can grow natural weapons such as claws or fangs, allowing a

natural attack that deals the appropriate amount of damage

according to the size of the new form (see Table 51 on page

90

296 of the Monster Manual). These morphic weapons need not

be natural weapons that the creature already possesses. For

example, a warshaper polymorphed into an ettin (Large giant)

could grow a claw that deals 1d6 points of damage, or horns

for a gore attack that deals 1d8 points of damage.

If  the  warshapers  form  already  has  a  natural  weapon  of

that type, the weapon deals damage as if it were one category

larger.  For  example,  a  warshaper  who  used  wild  shape  to

become  a  dire  wolf  (Large  animal)  could  grow  its  jaw  and

snout, enabling a bite attack that deals 2d6 points of damage

(as a for Huge animal), not the normal 1d8.

A  warshaper  can  change  morphic  weapons  as  often  as  it

likes, even if it is using a shapechanging technique such as

the polymorph spell or the wild shape class feature that doesnt

allow subsequent changes after the initial transformation.

Morphic Body (Su): At 2nd level and higher, a warshaper

can use its precise control over its form to make itself stron-

ger and heartier. It gains +4 to Strength and +4 to Constitu-

tion.

Morphic Reach (Su): A warshaper of 3rd level or higher

can  suddenly  stretch  its  limbs,  neck,  or  other  appendages

outward, giving it 5 more feet of reach than the creature its

emulating. Unlike most creatures, warshapers dont appear to

have a longer reach until they actually use it.

Morphic Healing (Su): At 4th level, a warshaper becomes

able to change its form where wounds appear, creating smooth

skin where once were wounds. The warshaper gains fast heal-

ing 2, and if it spends a full-round action and succeeds on a

Concentration  check  (DC  equal  to  the  total  damage  it  has

sustained), it heals 10 points of damage.

Flashmorph/Multimorph  (Su):  A  5th-level  warshaper

gains one of two class features. If the warshaper has the abil-

ity  to  change  form  at  will,  such  as  from  the  change  shape

ability, the shapechanger subtype, or a polymorph spell-like

ability,  it  gains  the   ashmorph  class  feature,  allowing  it  to

change form as a move action. If it casts the polymorph spell,

has polymorph as a spell-like ability usable less often than at

will, or has the wild shape class feature, it instead gains the

multimorph class feature. Multimorph allows a warshaper to

change forms multiple times during the duration of the spell,

spell-like ability, or class feature that enables her to change

form. For example, a wizard/warshaper could polymorph into

a troll for 2 minutes, then change into a red dragon for 4 min-

utes,  and  then  spend  the  rest  of  the  spells  duration  in  the

form of a hill giant. Each change requires a standard action,

and only the  rst transformation heals the warshaper. If the

warshaper changes into its natural form, the spell, spell-like

ability, or use of wild shape ends.

A warshaper

Animal  Com-

panion  (Ex):  Koreya  has  a

dire  wolf  as  an  an imal  companion.

Its  statistics  are  as  described  on  page  65  of  the  Monster

Manual, except that Koreya can handle it as a free action and

share spells if the companion is within 5 feet (see page 36 of

the Players Handbook).

Hal  ing  Traits  (Ex):  +2  morale  bonus  on  saves  against

fear;  +1  bonus  on  attack  rolls  with  thrown  weapons  and

slings.

Morphic Body (Su): Koreya gains a +4 bonus to Strength

and a +4 bonus to Constitution when in animal form.

Morphic  Healing  (Su):  In  animal  form,  Koreya  has

fast  healing  2.  She  can  take  a  full-round  action  to  make  a

Concentration check (DC equal to the total damage she has

sustained); a successful check heals 10 points of damage.

Morphic  Immunities  (Ex):  When  in  animal  form,

Koreya is immune to stunning and critical hits.

Morphic Reach (Su): Koreyas reach when in animal form

is 5 feet greater than normal for an animal of that kind.

Morphic  Weapons  (Su):  As  a  move  action,  Koreya  can

grow claws, fangs, or other natural weapons that deal slam,

bite, claw, or gore damage appropri-

ate  for  the  size  of  creature  (see

Table  51  on  page  296  of

the  Monster  Manual).  If  the

animal form she takes already

has  a  natural  weapon  of  that

type,  it  deals  damage  as  if  the

creature  were  one  size  category

larger.

Multimorph  (Su):  During  each

use  of  her  wild  shape  ability  (which

lasts  for  10  hours  or  until  she  changes

back  to  elf  form),  Koreya  can  change

form  as  many  times  as  she  likes,  taking

a  standard  action  to  do  so.  Only  the   rst

change heals Koreya.

Resist Natures Lure (Ex): Koreya has a +4 bonus on

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Trackless Step (Ex): Koreya leaves no trail in natural sur-

roundings and cant be tracked.

Wild Empathy (Ex): Koreya can improve the attitude of

an animal in the same way a Diplomacy check can improve

the attitude of a sentient being. She rolls 1d20+8, or 1d20+4

if attempting to in uence a magical beast with an Intel-

ligence score of 1 or 2.

Wild  Shape  (Su):  Koreya  can  change  into  a  Small,

Medium, or Large animal and back again four times per

day, as per the polymorph spell. Her morphic class features

work only when she is in animal form.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Koreya may move through natu-

ral undergrowth at normal speed and without taking damage

or suffering any other impairment.

Druid  Spells  Prepared  (6/6/6/4/4/3;  save  DC  16  +  spell  level;

she loses access to one 1st-, one 2nd-, and one 5th-level spell

lasses  are  the  templates  from  which  D&D

characters  are  created,  but  its  the  players

choice  of  feats,  skills,  domains,  spells,  and

other supplemental rules that de ne and dif-

ferentiate each PC. This chapter provides many new such

options for the players of martial characters.

FEATS

The  following  collections  of  feats  supplement  those

found in the Players Handbook and other DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS game products. When creating or advancing

a character, you can choose to use these feats in addi-

tion  to  those  presented  elsewhere.  Most  of  the  feats

presented  here  have  prerequisites  that  must  be  met

before  you  can  choose  them.  The  prerequisites  can

be met through options available in this book or the

Players Handbook.

In  keeping  with  the  theme  of  this  book,  these

feats  are  oriented  toward  improving  your  charac-

ters  combat  abilities.  They  are  not,  however,  only

options  for   ghter  characters  but,  rather,  expand  on

the  combat  options  of  all  the  classes.  Many  of  the  feats

here require class features or abilities not available to

a character with levels in the  ghter class only. Look

92

for options that make your characters sneak attack, turn-

ing  ability,  stunning  attacks,  or  other  class  features  and

skills more powerful or versatile.

CHOOSING FEATS

The  DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS  game  gives  you  a  plethora  of

options for customizing your character. When designing or

advancing a  ghter-type character, you depend on feats to dis-

tinguish your character from others, and the  ghter character

class, as well as many  ghter-oriented prestige classes.

You  can  adopt  any  number  of  strategies  when  choos-

ing feats for your  ghter-type character, and it would be

impossible for the designers to anticipate them all. Still,

here are a few suggestions.

Plan Ahead

You  might  not  know  at  character  creation,  or  even  later

on in your characters career, what path you want the PC

to take. Whether you want your character to stay single-

class,  or  experiment  with  multiclassing,  or  even  head

toward  one  of  the  many  prestige  classes  presented  here

or elsewhere isnt a decision you have to make right away.

However,  you  should  always  plan  at  least  a  level  or  two

ahead to take advantage of the choices that are out there.

Look at easy-entry feats (feats that have only one or two

1 A  ghter may select this feat as one of his  ghter bonus feats.

tiate  is  a  devastating  archer,  and  the  frenzied  berserker

takes  barbarian rage to the next level. (All three of these

prestige  classes  are  among  those  described  in  Chapter  2

of this book.)

If youre interested in a speci c character idealeven if

you may change your mind laterlook at prestige classes

that might serve that purpose. Some of them give you the

feats you want as class abilities, while others have require-

ments  that  suggest  feats  you  might  want  to  select.  Even

if you decide, for example, not to be an Order of the Bow

initiate, its hard to argue that its prerequisite featsPoint

Blank  Shot,  Precise  Shot,  Rapid  Shot,  and  Weapon  Focus

(longbow, shortbow, or the composite version of either)

dont  make  good  choices  for  any  sort  of  archery-oriented

character.

Utilize free feats (those that your PC gets regardless of

whether he meets the prerequisites) and bonus feat lists when

you can. If you create a character with many bonus feats on

the lists of classes your character will take, use the feats every

character gets at 1st, 3rd, 6th, and subsequent levels to  ll out

other needs. There are plenty of feats a   ghter might want

that dont appear on his list of bonus feats.

Observe Your DM

Every  Dungeon  Master  has  a  tendency  to  run  a  certain

type of campaign. If your DM likes to theme his campaign

around  particular  types  of  villainssuch  as  marauding

giants, a cabal of evil wizards, or an unholy alliance between

a lich lord and its blackguard henchmenyou should  nd

out which feats (and which class choices) work best in that

campaign.  If  youre  going  to  be   ghting  a  lot  of  giants,  for

example,  worry  less  about  accuracy  than  damage  potential

(giants tend to have low ACs relative to their Challenge Rat-

ings, but lots of hit points).

Also, check how your DM runs combat. Some DMs cant

help but play even the dumbest monsters smart. They avoid

giving player characters attacks of opportunity, for example,

making the selection of the Combat Re exes feat a less satis-

fying choice. On the other hand, feats that allow the player

to take advantage of the higher number of attacks of oppor-

tunity provided by the Combat Re exes featfeats such as

Defensive Throw or Hold the Line may turn an unsatisfying

choice into an advantageous one. This isnt about tricking

your  DM,  but  rather  about  coming  up  with  strategies  that

make the game fun and challenging for both of you.

CLEVER WRESTLING [GENERAL]

You have a better than normal chance to escape or wriggle

free from a big creatures grapple or pin.

Prerequisites: Small or Medium size, Improved Unarmed

Strike.

Bene  t: When your opponent is larger than Medium, you

gain a circumstance bonus on your grapple check to escape

a  grapple  or  pin.  The  size  of  the  bonus  depends  on  your

opponents size, according to the following table.

CLOSE-QUARTERS FIGHTING

[GENERAL]

You are skilled at  ghting at close range and resisting grapple

attempts.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +3.

Bene  t: You gain an attack of opportunity whenever an

enemy attempts to grapple you, even if the enemy has a feat

or special ability that would normally bypass the attack. If

you  deal  damage  with  this  attack,  the  enemy  fails  to  start

the  grapple  unless  it  has  the  Improved  Grapple  feat  or  a

special ability such as improved grab. If the enemy has such

an ability, you may add the damage you deal as a bonus on

your opposed check to resist being grappled. This feat does

not give you extra attacks of opportunity during a round or

allow you to make an attack of opportunity when you would

be denied one for being surprised, helpless, or in a similar

situation.

For example, an ogre attempts to grapple Tordek. Tordek

gains an attack of opportunity, hits, and causes damage. Since

the ogre does not have any sort of grappling special ability or

feat, it fails to start a grapple. Then an ankhega creature

with the improved grab special abilityattempts to grapple

Tordek. He takes an attack of opportunity, hits, and deals 10

points of damage to the creature. Tordek then adds +10 to his

opposed check to resist being grappled.

Normal:  Creatures  with  Improved  Grapple,  improved

grab,  or  similar  feats  or  special  abilities  do  not  provoke

attacks of opportunity when they attempt to start a grapple.

Special: A  ghter may select Close-Quarters Fighting as

one of his  ghter bonus feats.

DASH [GENERAL]

You can move faster than normal.

Bene  t: If you are wearing light armor or no armor and

are carrying a light load, your speed is 5 feet faster.

DEFENSIVE STRIKE [GENERAL]

You can turn a strong defense into a powerful offense.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge.

Bene  t: If an opponent attacks you and misses while you

are using the total defense action, you can attack that oppo-

nent on your next turn with a +4 bonus on your attack roll.

You gain no bonus against an opponent that does not attack

you or against an opponent that attacks and hits you.

Special: A  ghter may select Defensive Strike as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

DEFENSIVE THROW [GENERAL]

You can use your opponents weight, strength, and momen-

tum against her, de ecting her attack and throwing her to

the ground.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Combat Re exes, Dodge, Im proved

Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike.

Bene  t: If the opponent you have chosen to use your Dodge

feat against attacks you and misses, you can make an imme-

diate  trip  attack  against  that  opponent.  This  attempt  counts

against your allowed attacks of opportunity in the round.

DESTRUCTIVE RAGE [GENERAL]

You can shatter barriers and objects when enraged.

Prerequisites: Rage or frenzy ability.

Bene  t: While you are in a rage or frenzy, you gain a +8

bonus on any Strength checks you make to break down doors

or break inanimate, immobile objects.

EARTHS EMBRACE [GENERAL]

You can crush opponents when you grapple them.

Prerequisites:  Str  15,  Improved  Grapple  or  improved

grab, Improved Unarmed Strike.

Bene  t: While grappling, if you pin your opponent, you

deal an extra 1d12 points of damage in each round that you

maintain  the  pin.  You  must  hold  your  opponent  immobile

as  normal  (with  an  opposed  grapple  check),  but  you  must

also  remain  immobile,  giving  opponents  (other  than  the

one  youre  pinning)  a  +4  bonus  on  attack  rolls  against  you

(but you are not helpless). You do not gain this extra damage

against creatures that are immune to critical hits.

Normal: You may deal normal damage to a pinned oppo-

nent by making a successful grapple check.

EAGLE CLAW ATTACK [GENERAL]

Your  superior  insight  allows  you  to  strike  objects  with

impressive force.

Prerequisites:  Wis  13,  Improved  Sunder,  Improved

Unarmed Strike.

Bene  t:  When  you  make  an  unarmed  strike  against  an

object, you may add your Wisdom bonus to the damage dealt

to the object.

EXTEND RAGE [GENERAL]

You are able to maintain your rage longer than most.

Prerequisites: Rage or frenzy ability.

Bene  t: Each of the uses of your rage or frenzy ability lasts

an additional 5 rounds beyond its normal duration.

Its effects stack.

EXTRA

SMITING

Special: You can take this feat multiple times.

Its effects stack.

Bene  t: You gain the ability to make three extra stunning

attacks per day.

EYES IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD

[GENERAL]

Your superior battle sense helps minimize the threat of  ank-

ing attacks.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t: Attackers do not gain the usual +2 bonus on their

attack  rolls  when   anking  you.  This  feat  grants  no  effect

whenever you are attacked without bene t of your Dexterity

modi er  to  Armor  Class,  such  as  when  you  are   at-footed.

You may still be sneak attacked when  anked.

98

FASTER HEALING [GENERAL]

You recover faster than normal.

Prerequisites: Base Fortitude save bonus

+5.

Bene  t:  You  recover  lost

hit  points  and  ability

score  points  faster  than

you  normally  would,

according  to  the

table on the

next page.

Thanks to the Extend Rage feat, this

barbarian is almost invincible.

FAVORED POWER ATTACK [GENERAL]

You  are  able  to  deal  more  damage  against  your  favored

enemies.

Prerequisites: Favored enemy ability, Power Attack, base

attack bonus +4.

Bene  t:  When  you  use  the  Power  Attack  feat  against  a

favored enemy, you may subtract a number from your melee

attack rolls and add twice that number to your melee damage

rolls.  If  you  attack  with  a  weapon  in  two  hands,  add  three

times  the  number.  The  normal  restrictions  of  the  Power

Attack feat apply.

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   98

9/12/03, 3:16:11 PM

FISTS OF IRON [GENERAL]

You  have  learned  the  secrets  of  imbuing  your  unarmed

attacks with extra force.

Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist,

base attack bonus +2.

Bene  t:  Declare  that  you  are  using  this  feat  before  you

make  your  attack  roll  (thus,  a  missed  attack  roll  ruins  the

attempt). You deal an extra 1d6 points of damage when you

make a successful unarmed attack. Each attempt counts as

one of your uses of the Stunning Fist feat for the day.

FLEET OF FOOT [GENERAL]

You run nimbly, able to turn corners without losing momen-

tum.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, Run.

Bene  t:  When  running  or  charging,  you  can  make  a

single direction change of 90 degrees or less. You cant use

this feat in medium or heavy armor, or if youre carrying a

medium or heavier load. If you are charging, you must move

in a straight line for 10 feet (2 squares) after the turn to main-

tain the charge.

Normal: Without this feat you can run or charge only in a

straight line.

FLICK OF THE WRIST [GENERAL]

With a single motion, you can draw a light weapon and make

a devastating attack.

Prerequisites: Dex 17, Sleight of Hand 5 ranks, Quick Draw.

Bene  t:  If  you  draw  a  light  weapon  and  make  a  melee

attack with it in the same round, you catch your opponent

 at-footed (for the purpose of this attack only). You may use

this feat only once per round and once per opponent during

any single combat encounter.

FLYING KICK [GENERAL]

You literally leap into battle, dealing devastating damage.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Jump 4 ranks, Improved Unarmed

Strike, Power Attack.

Bene  t:  When   ghting  unarmed  and  using  the  charge

action,  you  deal  an  extra  1d12  points  of  damage  with  your

unarmed attack.

FREEZING THE LIFEBLOOD [GENERAL]

You can paralyze a humanoid opponent with an unarmed attack.

Prerequisites: Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stun-

ning Fist, base attack bonus +10.

Bene  t: Declare that you are using this feat before you

make your attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the

attempt). Against a humanoid opponent, you can make an

unarmed attack that deals no damage but has a chance of

paralyzing  your  target.  If  your  attack  is  successful,  your

target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2

your character level + your Wis modi er). If the target fails

this  saving  throw,  it  is  paralyzed  for  1d4+1  rounds.  Each

attempt to paralyze an opponent counts as one of your uses

of the Stunning Fist feat for the day. Creatures immune to

stunning cannot be paralyzed in this manner.

Special: A  ghter may select Freezing the Lifeblood as one

of his  ghter bonus feats.

GREATER KIAI SHOUT [GENERAL]

Your kiai shout can panic your opponents.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Kiai Shout, base attack bonus +9.

Bene  t: When you make a kiai shout, your opponents are

panicked for 2d6 rounds unless they succeed on Will saves

(DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modi er). The

kiai  shout  affects  only  opponents  with  fewer  Hit  Dice  or

levels than you have.

GREATER RESILIENCY [GENERAL]

Your extraordinary resilience to damage increases.

Prerequisites:  Damage  reduction  as  a  class  feature  or

innate ability.

Bene  t: Your damage reduction increases by 1. If it would

normally rise thereafter with level, it does so at its previous

rate, adding the +1 normally. For example, a 13th-level barbar-

ian has damage reduction 3/. By taking this feat, he raises

it to 4/. When he reaches 16th level, his damage reduction

becomes 5/ and at 19th level, it becomes 6/. You may not

take this feat more than once. This feat has no effect on the

type  of  weapon  or  damage  that  overcomes  your  damage

reduction. If you have more than one form of damage reduc-

tion, choose which to increase when you take this feat.

GREATER TWO-WEAPON DEFENSE

[GENERAL]

IMPROVED COMBAT EXPERTISE

[GENERAL]

When  ghting with two weapons, your defenses are extraor-

dinarily strong.

Prerequisites: Dex 19, Improved Two-Weapon Defense,  Two-

Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +11.

Bene  t: When wielding two weapons (not including natu-

ral weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +3 shield bonus

to your AC.

When  you  are   ghting  defensively  or  using  the  total

defense action, this shield bonus increases to +6.

Special: A  ghter may select Greater Two-Weapon Defense

as one of his  ghter bonus feats.

You have mastered the art of defense in combat.

Prerequisites:  Int  13,  Combat  Expertise,  base  attack

bonus +6.

Bene  t:  When  you  use  the  Combat  Expertise  feat  to

improve  your  Armor  Class,  the  number  you  subtract  from

your attack roll and add to your AC can be any number that

does not exceed your base attack bonus.

Normal: With Combat Expertise, the number can be no

greater than +5.

Special: A  ghter may select Improved Combat Expertise

as one of his  ghter bonus feats.

You  can  wound  your  opponents  legs,  hampering  their

movement.

Prerequisites: Sneak attack ability, base attack bonus +4.

Bene  t:  If  you  hit  with  a  melee  sneak  attack,  you  may

choose  to  forgo  2d6  points  of  extra  sneak  attack  damage

to  reduce  your  opponents  base  speed  by  half.  This  speed

reduction ends after 24 hours have passed or a successful DC

15  Heal  check  or  the  application  of  any  cure  spell  or  other

magical healing is made. Creatures immune to sneak attack

damage  and  creatures  with  no  legs  or  more  than  four  legs

cant be slowed down with a hamstring attack. It takes two

successful  hamstring  attacks  to  affect  quadrupeds.  Other

speeds ( y, burrow, and so on) arent affected. You may use

this ability once per round.

HOLD THE LINE [GENERAL]

You  are  trained  in  defensive  techniques  against  charging

opponents.

Prerequisites: Combat Re exes, base attack bonus +2.

Bene  t: You may make an attack of opportunity against

a charging opponent who enters an area you threaten. Your

attack of opportunity happens immediately before the charge

attack is resolved.

Normal: You only get an attack of opportunity against a

character that exits a square you threaten.

IMPROVED BUCKLER DEFENSE

[GENERAL]

You  can  attack  with  an  off-hand  weapon  while  retaining  a

bucklers shield bonus to your Armor Class.

Prerequisite: Shield Pro ciency.

Bene  t: When you attack with a weapon in your off hand,

you may still apply your bucklers shield bonus to your Armor

Class.

Normal: Without this feat, a character wielding a buckler

who  attacks  with  an  off-hand  weapon  loses  the  bucklers

shield bonus to AC until his or her next turn.

Special: A  ghter may select Improved Buckler Defense as

one of his  ghter bonus feats.

This feat allows spellcasters to acquire a new familiar from a

nonstandard list, but only when they could normally acquire

a  new  familiar  (see  Familiars,  page  52  of  the  Players  Hand-

book). This feat was originally presented on page 200 of the

Dungeon  Masters  Guide;  the  description  here  provides  new

alternatives  for  arcane  spellcasters  who  want  familiars  to

stand beside them in battle.

Prerequisite:  Ability  to  acquire  a  new  familiar,  compat-

ible alignment, suf ciently high arcane spellcaster level, and

base attack bonus.

Bene  t:  When  choosing  a  familiar,  the  creatures  listed

below  are  also  available  to  the  spellcaster.  The  spellcaster

may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away

on each of the alignment axes (lawful through chaotic, good

through evil). For example, a chaotic good spellcaster could

acquire a neutral familiar. A lawful neutral spellcaster could

acquire a neutral good familiar. The spellcaster must have at

least the arcane spellcaster level and base attack bonus indi-

cated below in order to acquire the familiar.

ties, all familiars grant their masters the Alertness feat, the

bene t  of  an  empathic  link,  and  the  ability  to  share  spells

with the familiar.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If a familiar is exposed to any

effect that normally allows it to attempt a Re ex saving throw

for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful saving

throw and only half damage on a failed save.

ARCHERY

[GENERAL]

You  can  make  ranged

attacks  from  a  mount

almost  as  well  as  you

can from the ground.

Prerequisites:

Ride 1 rank,

Mounted Archery,

Mounted Combat.

Bene  t: The

penalty you take when

using a ranged

weapon if your

mount is taking a double

move is eliminated, and

the penalty for using a

ranged weapon when

your mount is running

is lessened from 4 to 

2. You can attack at any

time during your

mounts move.

Special: A

 ghter may select

Improved

Mounted

his  ghter bonus feats.

You gain a signi cant defensive advan-

tage while  ghting with two weapons.

Prerequisites:  Dex  17,  Two-

Weap on Defense, Two-Weapon Fight-

ing, base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: When

wielding two weap-

ons (not including

natural weapons

or unarmed

strikes), you

gain a +2

shield bonus

to your Armor

Class.

When you are

fighting defen-

sively or using the

this shield bonus

increases to +4.

Special: A  ghter

as one of his fighter

bonus feats.

IMPROVED

WEAPON

FAMILI ARITY

[GENERAL]

You are familiar with all exotic weapons

common to your people.

Prerequisite:  Base  attack

bonus +1.

IMPROVED RAPID SHOT [GENERAL]

You are an expert at  ring weapons with exceptional speed.

Prerequisites: Manyshot, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot.

Bene  t: When using the Rapid Shot feat, you may ignore

the 2 penalty on all your ranged attack rolls.

Special: A  ghter may select Improved Rapid Shot as one

of his  ghter bonus feats.

Bene  t: You can treat all the exotic

weapons associated with your race as martial weapons rather

than as exotic weapons. A weapon is treated as being asso-

ciated  with  a  race  if  the  races  name  appears  as  part  of  the

weapons name, such as the elven thinblade (see Chapter 4 of

this book) or the dwarven urgrosh.

Normal:  Without  this  feat,  you  must  select  the  Exotic

Weapon  Pro ciency  feat  (or  have  the  appropriate  weapon

affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than you

have. An opponent in the affected area can resist the effect

with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level

+ your Cha modi er). You can use the bene t of this feat three

times per day.

MONKEY GRIP [GENERAL]

You are able to use a larger weapon than other people your

size.

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t:  You  can  use  melee  weapons  one  size  category

larger than you are with a 2 penalty on the attack roll, but

the  amount  of  effort  it  takes  you  to  use  the  weapon  does

not change. For instance, a Large longsword (a one-handed

weapon  for  a  Large  creature)  is  considered  a  two-handed

weapon for a Medium creature that does not have this feat.

For a Medium creature that has this feat, it is still considered

a one-handed weapon. You can wield a larger light weapon as

a light weapon, or a larger two-handed weapon in two hands.

You cannot wield a larger weapon in your off hand, and you

cannot use this feat with a double weapon.

Normal:  You  can  use  a  melee  weapon  one  size  category

larger than you are with a 2 penalty on the attack roll, and the

amount of effort it takes to use the weapon increases. A larger

light weapon is considered a one-handed weapon, a larger one-

handed weapon is considered a two-handed weapon, and you

cannot use a larger two-handed weapon at all.

PAIN TOUCH [GENERAL]

You  cause  intense  pain  in  an  opponent  with  a  successful

stunning attack.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, Stunning Fist, base attack bonus +2.

Bene  t: Victims of a successful stunning attack are sub-

ject  to  such  debilitating  pain  that  they  are  nauseated  for  1

round following the round they are stunned. Creatures that

are immune to stunning attacks are also immune to the effect

of this feat, as are any creatures that are more than one size

category larger than the feat user.

PHALANX FIGHTING [GENERAL]

You  are  trained  in   ghting  in  close  formation  with  your

allies.

Prerequisites: Pro ciency with a heavy shield, base attack

bonus +1.

Bene  t: If you are using a heavy shield and a light weapon,

you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. In addition, if you

are within 5 feet of an ally who is also using a heavy shield

and light weapon and who also has this feat, you may form a

shield wall. A shield wall provides an extra +2 bonus to AC

and a +1 bonus on Re ex saves to all eligible characters par-

ticipating in the shield wall. For example, a single character

with  this  feat  gains  a  +1  bonus  to  his  AC.  If  two  or  more

characters who all know this feat are adjacent, they each gain

an extra +2 bonus to AC (for a total of +3) and a +1 bonus on

Re ex saves.

Special: A  ghter may select Phalanx Fighting as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

PIN SHIELD [GENERAL]

You know how to get inside your opponents guard by pin-

ning his shield out of the way.

Prerequisites:  Two-Weapon  Fighting,  base  attack

bonus +4.

Bene  t: This feat can be used only when  ghting against

an opponent who is using a shield and who is your size or one

size category bigger or smaller than you. When making a full

attack action, you may give up all your off-hand attacks. If you

do, you momentarily pin your opponents shield with your

off-hand weapon, and all your remaining attacks during the

round are made with your primary weapon (with the normal

penalties for  ghting with two weapons), and your foe gains

no Armor Class bene t from her shield until the end of your

action. You cannot use this feat if you are  ghting with only

one weapon.

POWER CRITICAL [GENERAL]

Choose one weapon, such as a longsword or a greataxe. With

that weapon, you know how to hit where it hurts.

Prerequisites:  Weapon  Focus  with  weapon,  base  attack

bonus +4.

Bene  t: When using the weapon you selected, you gain a

+4 bonus on the roll to con rm a threat.

Special: A  ghter may select Power Critical as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

You can gain Power Critical multiple times. Each time you

take the feat, it may be with a different weapon or the same

weapon. If you take it with the same weapon, the effects of

the feats stack.

PRONE ATTACK [GENERAL]

You can attack from a prone position without penalty.

Prerequisites:  Dex  15,  Lightning  Re exes,  base  attack

bonus +2.

Bene  t: You can make an attack from the prone position

and take no penalty on your attack roll. If your attack roll is

successful,  you  may  regain  your  feet  immediately  as  a  free

action.  Opponents  gain  no  bonus  on  melee  attacks  against

you while you are prone.

Special: A  ghter may select Prone Attack as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

RANGED DISARM [GENERAL]

You can disarm a foe from a distance.

Prerequisites:  Dex  15,  Point  Blank  Shot,  Precise  Shot,

base attack bonus +5.

Bene  t: Choose one type of ranged weapon with which

you are pro cient. You can make a disarm attempt with this

weapon as long as your target is within 30 feet.

Special: A  ghter may select Ranged Disarm as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

Bene  t: You can throw a melee weapon you are pro cient

with as if it were a ranged weapon. The range increment of

weapons used in conjunction with this feat is 10 feet.

Normal: You cant throw a melee weapon without taking

a 4 penalty unless it has a range increment (such as a hand

axe or a dagger).

WEAKENING TOUCH [GENERAL]

You  can  temporarily  weaken  an  opponent  with  your

unarmed strike.

Prerequisites: Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stun-

ning Fist, base attack bonus +2.

Bene  t:  Declare  that  you  are  using  this  feat  before  you

make  your  attack  roll  (thus,  a  missed  attack  roll  ruins  the

attempt).  You  can  make  an  unarmed  attack  that  deals  no

damage,  but  instead  applies  a  6  penalty  to  the  targets

Strength  score  for  1  minute.  Multiple  weakening  touches

delivered  on  the  same  target  are  not  cumulative.  Each

attempt to deliver a weakening touch counts as one of your

Stunning Fist attacks for the day. Creatures with immunity

to stun effects cannot be affected by this feat.

Special: A  ghter may select Weakening Touch as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

ZEN ARCHERY [GENERAL]

Your  intuition  guides  your  hand  when  you  use  a  ranged

weapon.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t:  You  can  use  your  Wisdom  modi er  instead  of

your Dexterity modi er when making a ranged attack roll.

DIVINE FEATS

In  keeping  with  the  idea  of  expanding  the  options  of  all

classes,  the  feats  in  this  category  share  characteristics  that

make them unavailable to single-class  ghters. First, they all

have as a prerequisite the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 3rd level or higher,

and a member of any prestige class or any creature that has

that ability.

Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to

channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead.

Each use of a divine feat costs a character a minimum of one

turn/rebuke attempt from her number of attempts each day.

If  you  dont  have  any  turn/rebuke  attempts  left,  you  cant

use a divine feat. Turning or rebuking undead is a standard

action (unless you have a special ability that says otherwise).

These feats often take a standard action to activate, but may

require  other  types  of  actions  as  speci ed.  Regardless,  you

may activate only one divine feat (or use the ability to turn

or rebuke undead once) per round, though overlapping dura-

tions may allow you the bene ts of more than one divine feat

at a time.

Third, turning or rebuking undead is a supernatural abil-

ity and a standard action that does not provoke an attack of

opportunity  and  counts  as  an  attack.  Activating  a  divine

feat  is  also  a  supernatural  ability  and  does  not  provoke  an

attack of opportunity unless otherwise speci ed in the feat

description.  Activating  a  divine  feat  is  not  considered  an

attack unless the feats activation could be the direct cause

of damage to a target. Sacred Vengeance, for example, adds

2d6 points of damage to all your melee attacks, but does not

directly deal damage to an opponent upon its activation. It is

not itself an attack.

Paladins in particular should consider these feats. Because

the  paladins  turning  ability  remains  behind  the  clerics

throughout the paladins career, a paladin who chooses one

or  two  divine  feats  has  more  options  than  just  rebuking

undead.

DIVINE CLEANSING [DIVINE]

You  can  channel  energy  to  improve  your  allies  ability  to

resist attacks against their vitality and health.

Prerequisites: Turn or rebuke undead ability.

Bene  t: As a standard action, you can spend one of your

turn or rebuke undead attempts to grant all allies (including

yourself)  within  a  60-foot  burst  a  +2  sacred  bonus  on  For-

titude saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your

Charisma modi er.

DIVINE MIGHT [DIVINE]

You can channel energy to increase the damage you deal in

combat.

Prerequisites:  Str  13,  turn  or  rebuke  undead  ability,

Power Attack.

Bene  t: As a free action, spend one of your turn or rebuke

undead attempts to add your Charisma bonus to your weapon

damage for 1 full round.

DIVINE RESISTANCE [DIVINE]

You can channel energy to temporarily reduce damage you

and your allies take from some sources.

Prerequisites:  Turn  or  rebuke  undead  ability,  Divine

Cleansing.

Bene  t: As a standard action, spend one of your turn or

rebuke undead attempts to imbue all allies within a 60-foot

burst (including yourself) with resistance to cold 5, electric-

ity 5, and  re 5. This resistance does not stack with similar

resistances, such as those granted by spells or special abili-

ties. The protection lasts for a number of rounds equal to your

Charisma modi er.

DIVINE SHIELD [DIVINE]

You can channel energy to make your shield more effective

for either offense or defense.

Prerequisites: Turn or rebuke undead ability, pro ciency

with a shield.

round.

TACTICAL FEATS

Feats with the tactical descriptor allow characters to perform

a number of powerful attacks.

If  youre  playing  a  character  who  has  a  tactical  feat,  its

your  responsibility  to  keep  track  of  the  actions  youre  per-

forming as you set up the maneuver that the feat enables you

to perform. Its also a good idea to brie y mention to the DM

that youre working toward performing a tactical maneuver;

a remark along the lines of I attack the troll, using Combat

Expertise to the maximum, and thats the  rst step in a tacti-

cal maneuver is appropriate.

Some of the tactical feats refer to the  rst round, second

round,  and  so  on.  These  terms  refer  to  the  timing  of  the

maneuver,  not  the  battle  as  a  whole.  You  dont  have  to  use

Combat  Expertise  in  the   rst  round  of  combat  to  begin  a

tactical  maneuver,  for  example;  the  round  in  which  you

use  Combat  Expertise  is  considered  the   rst  round  of  the

maneuver.

CAVALRY CHARGER [TACTICAL]

Fighting from the back of a steed is second nature to you.

Prerequisites: Mounted Combat, Spirited Charge, Tram-

ple, base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: The Cavalry Charger feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers.

Unhorse: To use this maneuver, you must be mounted and

charge  a  mounted  foe.  If  your  charge  attack  hits,  you  may

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: TACTICAL FEATS

Tactical  feats  are  more  complicated  than  most  other  feats,

because they cover multiple situations and often require some

setup on the part of the player character. So why bother?

Tactical feats are a good way to offer bonuses for situations

that dont come up often enough to warrant regular feats. Players

understand that their characters only get a precious few feats over

the course of their careers, and they want to make sure every feat

counts. A  ghter can count on his Weapon Focus feat making a

difference in almost every combat. A feat that requires you to  ght

defensively for several rounds in a row might not matterand

players  probably  wont  choose  such  a  feat  because  they  know

its  too  situational.  However,  by  combining  three  situational

advantages in a single tactical feat, you make the package deal

a more compelling choice. You provide big rewards for unusual

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

situations rather than a smaller reward for a common situation.

A second, related reason to employ tactical feats is to encour-

age a broader range of combat maneuvers. Combat in the D&D

game can sometimes devolve into a ceaseless litany of I try to

hit him again. Tactical feats, on the other hand, often involve

movement, bull rushes, power attacks, and other special activi-

ties. They reward clever play and teamwork as players think stra-

tegically, setting up the situations that grant them big bonuses.

But theres an element of risk involved, because the bad guys

(intentionally or not) often thwart such plans.

If you design your own tactical feats, take care to keep them

somewhat rare in your game. In general, characters shouldnt

have more than two or three tactical feats, because six to nine

special situations are a lot to keep track of. Tactical feats should

be spicethey shouldnt be the main course.

make a free bull rush attempt. If the bull rush attempt suc-

ceeds, you move your foe normally, but his mount remains

where it was.

Leaping Charge: To use this maneuver, you must be mounted

and charge a foe at least one size category smaller than your

mount. Make a Ride check at the conclusion of the move por-

tion of the charge action. Prior to making the roll, determine

the DC of the check: either DC 10 for a chance to deal 2 extra

points of damage or DC 20 for a chance to deal 4 extra points

of damage. If you fail this Ride check, you miss your target

(no attack roll) and if you fail this Ride check by 5 or more,

you  miss  your  target  and  fall  off  your  mount,  landing  in  a

square adjacent to the mounts space.

Fell  Trample:  You  can  make  mounted  overrun  attempts

against more than one foe, resolving each attempt according

to the rules on page 157 and 158 of the Players Handbook. Your

mount  gets  a  hoof  attack  against  each  foe  you  successfully

overrun.

Special: A  ghter may select Cavalry Charger as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

COMBAT BRUTE [TACTICAL]

You employ strength and leverage to great effect in battle.

Prerequisites:  Improved  Sunder,  Power  Attack,  base

attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: The Combat Brute feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers.

Advancing Blows: To use this maneuver, you must make a

successful bull rush attempt against a foe. During the next

round,  all  your  attacks  against  that  foe  gain  a  +1  bonus  on

attack and damage rolls for each square your bull rush moved

that foe. For example, if you pushed an orc back 10 (2 squares)

feet with a bull rush, you would gain a +2 bonus on attack and

damage rolls against that orc on the following round.

Sundering Cleave: To use this maneuver, you must destroy a

foes weapon or shield with a successful sunder attempt (see

page 158 of the Players Handbook). If you do so, you gain an

immediate additional melee attack against the foe. The addi-

tional attack is with the same weapon and at the same attack

bonus as the attack that destroyed the weapon or shield.

Momentum Swing: To use this maneuver, you must charge

a foe in the  rst round, and you must make an attack using

your Power Attack feat in the second round. The penalty you

take  on  your  attack  roll  must  be  5  or  worse.  Your  attacks

during the second round gain a bonus equal to your attack

roll  penalty    1-1/2,  or    3  if  youre  using  a  two-handed

weapon or a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands. For

instance, if you choose to take a 6 penalty on your attack

roll, you can deal an extra 9 points of damage, or an extra 18

points if youre using a two-handed weapon or a one-handed

weapon wielded in two hands.

Special: A  ghter may select Combat Brute as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

ELUSIVE TARGET [TACTICAL]

Trying to land a blow against you can be a maddening experi-

ence.

Prerequisites: Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: The Elusive Target feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers.

Negate Power Attack: To use this maneuver, you must desig-

nate a speci c foe to be affected by your Dodge feat. If that foe

uses the Power Attack feat against you, the foe gains no bonus

on the damage roll but still takes the corresponding penalty

on the attack roll.

Diverting  Defense:  To  use  this  maneuver,  you  must  be

 anked and you must designate one of the  anking attackers

to be affected by your Dodge feat. The  rst attack of the round

from the designated attacker automatically misses you and may

strike  the  other   anking  foe  instead;  the  attacking  creature

makes an attack roll normally, and its ally is considered  at-

footed. If the designated attacker is making a full attack against

you, its second and subsequent attacks function normally.

Cause Overreach: To use this maneuver, you must provoke

an attack of opportunity from a foe by moving out of a threat-

ened square. If the foe misses you, you can make a free trip

attempt against this foe, and the foe does not get a chance to

trip you if your attempt fails.

FORMATION EXPERT [TACTICAL]

You are trained at  ghting in ranks and  les.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t:  The  Formation  Expert  feat  enables  the  use  of

three  tactical  maneuvers.  You  gain  the  bene t  of  the  feat

even if you are  ghting in formation with allies that do not

have this feat.

ready shields. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

Step  into  the  Breach:  To  use  this  maneuver,  you  must  be

within a single move of an ally who falls in combat, and an

ally  must  occupy  every  square  between  you  and  the  fallen

comrade. You can immediately take a single move action (as

if you had readied an action to do so) to move into the square

the fallen ally occupies.

Wall of Polearms: To use this maneuver, you must be wield-

ing a shortspear, longspear, trident, glaive, guisarme, halberd,

square on the opposite side of the foe or you fail the Tumble

check, you remain in the square you are in and have failed to

duck underneath your foe.

Death  from  Below:  To  use  this  maneuver,  you  must  have

successfully used the duck underneath maneuver. You may

make an immediate single attack against the foe you ducked

underneath. That foe is treated as  at-footed, and you gain a

+4 bonus on your attack roll.

Climb Aboard: To use this maneuver, you must move adja-

cent to a foe at least two size categories larger than you. In the

following round, you may make a DC 10

Climb check as a free action to clam-

ber  onto  the  creatures  back  or  limbs

(you  move  into  one  of  the  squares

the creature occupies). The creature

youre standing on takes a

Duck  Underneath:  To  use  this  maneuver,  you  must  have

taken  a  total  defense  action,  then  have  been  attacked  by  a

foe  at  least  two  size  categories  larger  than  you.  You  gain  a

+4 dodge bonus to your Armor Class, which stacks with the

bonus for total defense. If that foe misses you, on your next

turn, as a free action, you may make a DC 15 Tumble check.

If the check succeeds, you move immediately to any unoc-

cupied square on the opposite side of the foe (having success-

111

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   111

9/12/03, 3:22:54 PM

page 77 of the Players Handbook). Make a Jump check as a free

action immediately before your next attack. Prior to making

the roll, determine the DC of the check: either DC 15 for a

chance to deal 2 extra points of damage or DC 25 for a chance

to deal 4 extra points of damage. If you fail this Jump check,

you miss your target, and if you fail this Jump check by 5 or

more, you fall prone in an adjacent square.

Falcons Feathers: To use this maneuver, you must be wearing

a cloak. As a standard action, you can whip the cloak around

you  in  a  distracting  fashion.  Make  an  attempt  to  feint  in

combat (see page 68 of the Players Handbook), using your base

attack bonus instead of your Bluff modi er. If you succeed,

your target is treated as  at-footed for the next melee attack

you make against it.

Hawks  Eye:  To  use  this  maneuver,  you  must  spend  at

least  1  full  round  observing  your  foe.  While  doing  so,  you

can take no other actions. The next melee attack you make

against your foe gains a +2 bonus on the attack and damage

rolls for every round you have just spent observing the foe,

to a maximum bonus of +6 (for 3 consecutive full rounds of

observation).  If  the  target  of  your  observation  attacks  you

while youre observing, or if you dont make the melee attack

within 3 rounds of the end of your observation, you dont get

the bene t of the feat.

rush into battle.

attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: The Shock Trooper feat enables the use of three

square you push your foe back, you may also push that foe one

square to the left or right.

Domino Rush: To use this maneuver, you must make a suc-

cessful bull rush attempt that forces a foe into the same square

as another foe. You may make a free trip attempt against both

foes at the same time, and neither foe gets a chance to trip you

if your attempt fails.

Heedless Charge: To use this maneuver, you must charge and

make the attack at the end of the charge using your Power

Attack feat. The penalty you take on your attack roll must be

5 or worse. In addition to normal charge modi ers (which

give you a 2 penalty to AC and a +2 bonus on the attack roll),

you  can  assign  any  portion  of  the  attack  roll  penalty  from

Power Attack to your Armor Class instead, up to a maximum

equal to your base attack bonus.

Special: A  ghter may select Shock Trooper as one of his

 ghter bonus feats.

5 feet, and you may move 5 feet forward if you wish. This

movement  does  not  provoke  an  attack  of  opportunity  for

either character.

Blinding Sun of Noon: To use this maneuver, you must suc-

cessfully  stun  the  same  foe  with  an  unarmed  attack  two

rounds in a row. In addition to being stunned, that enemy is

confused for 1d4 rounds thereafter.

Flash of Sunset: To use this maneuver, you must move adja-

cent to a foe instantaneously, as with a dimension door spell

or the monks abundant step class feature. If you do so, you

can immediately make a single attack at your highest attack

bonus against that foe.

Effect: Shadowy hound

Duration: 1 minute/level (D) or until destroyed

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You shape the essence of the Plane of Shadow to create a pow-

erful doglike companion that serves you loyally for the dura-

tion of the spell. The hound of doom has the statistics of a dire

wolf (see page 65 of the Monster Manual) with the following

adjustments: It gains a de ection bonus to Armor Class equal

to your Charisma bonus, its hit points when created are equal

to your full normal hit points, and it uses your base attack

bonus instead of its own (adding its +7 bonus from Strength

and 1 penalty from size as normal).

You can command a hound of doom as a move action just as

if it were fully trained to perform all the tricks listed in the

Handle Animal skill (see page 74 of the Players Handbook).

If  a  hound  of  dooms  hit  points  are  reduced  to  0,  it  is

destroyed. A hound of doom is treated as a magical beast for

the purpose of spells and effects, but it can also be dispelled.

You can only have one hound of doom in existence at a time.

If you cast a second hound of doom spell while the  rst is still

active, the  rst hound is instantly dispelled.

Lions Roar

Evocation [Sonic]

Level: Courage 8

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Area: 120-ft.-radius burst centered on you

Duration: Instantaneous or 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial or Will negates (harmless);

see text

Spell Resistance: Yes or Yes (harmless); see text

You emit a titanic roar that deals 1d8 points of sonic damage

per two caster levels to all enemies within the spells area and

stuns them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves

the damage and negates the stunning effect.

In addition, all allies within the spells area gain a +1 morale

bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus tem-

porary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of

1d8+20 temporary hit points at caster level 20th).

Phantom Threat

Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Brd 1, Hexblade 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

118

You  create  the  sensation  in  the  subjects  mind  that  he  is

threatened by more foes than he actually faces. Though the

subject doesnt actually perceive any additional enemies (and

thus doesnt waste any attacks on the phantasm), a creature

affected by this spell is considered  anked, even if not threat-

ened by other creatures. No amount of convincing by others

can help the victim of this spell avoid its effectonly a suc-

cessful saving throw against the spell when initially cast can

help the target.

Valiant Fury

Transmutation

Level: Courage 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The  affected  creature  gains  a  +4  morale  bonus  to  Strength

and Constitution and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves.

In addition, when making a full attack, the affected crea-

ture may make one additional attack with any weapon he is

holding.  The  attack  is  made  using  the  creatures  full  base

attack bonus, plus any modi ers appropriate to the situation.

(This  effect  is  not  cumulative  with  similar  effects,  such  as

that provided by the haste spell, nor does it actually grant an

extra action, so you cant use it to cast a second spell or other-

wise take an extra action in the round.)

GUARDIAN FAMILIARS

Few  arcane  spellcasters  are  top-notch  martial  characters

as well. Obviously, most use spells to compensate for their

weakness  in  a  combat  situation.  Some  arcane  spellcasters

may  also  build  themselves  guardian  familiarsconstruct

companions  that   ght  on  their  behalf.  While  guardian

familiars lack the versatility of other familiars, one of these

creatures  can  be  an  effective  bodyguard  for  an  otherwise

fragile wizard or sorcerer.

ACQUIRING A GUARDIAN FAMILIAR

Getting a guardian familiar is a two-step process. First, a spell-

caster of suf ciently high level (see the table below) must build

the construct in a process similar to wondrous item creation,

expending the gold, experience points, and time described in

each entry below. Then the character must bind the completed

construct to her with the Improved Familiar feat (described

earlier  in  this  chapter  and  also  on  page  200  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide). The various guardian familiars, and the mini-

mum level an arcane spellcaster must be to create one, are as

follows:

Gauntlet guardian

Arcane

Spellcaster Level

9th

11th

Unlike other familiars, guardian familiars retain their own

hit  points  if  theyre  higher  than  one-half  of  the  masters

total. Their effective HD is the masters character level or the

guardian familiars HD, whichever is greater. They lack the

improved evasion and empathic link abilities that most other

familiars possess, and they dont confer the Alertness feat on

their master. They respond to the masters verbal commands,

and  they  understand  any  language  the  master  knew  when

she created the guardian familiar. Because they are mindless

constructs, they dont get smarter as the master attains higher

levels. Guardian familiars never speak.

If a guardian familiar dies, its master does not have to wait

a year and a day to replace it (as is the case with normal

familiars). However, a character cannot start to build

a new guardian familiar if he or she already pos-

sesses one.

Because its usually a familiar, a spark guardian has the same

base attack bonus as its master. A spark guardian applies its

Dexterity modi er, not its Strength modi er, as a bonus on

its melee attack roll.

This copper-colored creature looks like a toy hunting bird, with obviously

mechanical wings and a strangely glowing beak.

Spark  guardians  are  mechanical  birds  that  shoot  sparks  at

anyone who threatens their master.

Spark guardians are the most basic type of guardian famil-

iar.  They  usually  circle

above their master, shoot-

ing sparks out of their beaks

at  enemies.  If  it  isnt  undertak-

ing  a  speci c  task  for  its  master,

a spark guardian  ies nearby, pre-

pared  to  defend  its  master  with  its

spark attack.

A  spark  guardian  is  the  size  of  a

songbird or an owl, but it weighs about

10 pounds.

Combat

Spark  guardians  know  that  theyre  ill-

equipped for melee combat. Instead, they do

their best to remain out of enemies range,

 inging sparks at them from above.

Sparks  (Su):  The  spark  guardians

sparks have a range increment of 100 feet.

Find  Master  (Su):  No  matter  the  dis-

tance, as long as it is on the same plane,

a spark guardian can  nd its master.

Construction

A spark guardian is built from wood,

leather,  and  copper.  The  materials

cost 2,000 gp. The guardians master

may  assemble  the  body  or  hire  some-

one else to do the job. Creating the body

requires  a  DC  16  Profession  (engineer-

ing)  check.  After  the  body  is  sculpted,

the spark guardian is animated through

an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared

laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemists laboratory

and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally

constructing the creatures body, the building and the ritual

can be performed together.

A  spark  guardian  with  more  than  2  Hit  Dice  can  be

created,  but  each  additional  Hit  Die  adds  1,000  gp  to  the

market  price,  and  the  price  increases  by  5,000  gp  if  the

creatures size increases to Medium, modifying the cost to

create accordingly.

Caster  Level:  7th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Construct  (see  page

303  of  the  Monster  Manual),  lightning  bolt,  locate  creature,

Because its usually a familiar, a gauntlet guardian has the

same base attack bonus as its master.

This squat construct has a barrel-shaped chest and relatively spindly legs.

Its forearms are massive pistons ending in oversized, spiked gauntlets.

Gaunlet guardians are created by wizards and sorcerers to be

implacable,  frightening  bodyguards.  They  perform  that  task

very well; they punch anyone who gets in their masters way.

Gauntlet  guardians  can  handle  detailed  tactical  plans,

sentry duty, and similar tasks. Unless ordered not to, a gaunt-

let guardian focuses its attacks on anyone who attacked its

master.

A gauntlet guardian is almost 4 feet tall and weighs more

than 200 pounds.

Combat

Gauntlet guardians arent exactly subtle. They simply move

adjacent  to  their  foes  and  start  pummeling  with  their

immense  sts.

Find Master (Su): No matter the distance, as long as it is

on the same plane, a gauntlet guardian can  nd its master.

Spell Storing (Sp): A gauntlet guardian can store one spell

of 2nd level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It

uses this spell when commanded or when a predetermined

situation arises. Once this spell is used, it can store another

spell (or the same spell).

120

Construction

A  gauntlet  guardian  is

built  from  brass,  stone,  and

steel.  The  materials  cost  3,000  gp.

The guardians master may assemble

the body or hire someone else to do the

job. Creating the body requires a DC 16

Profession  (engineering)  check.  After

the body is sculpted, the gauntlet guard-

ian  is  animated  through  an  extended  magical  ritual  that

requires a specially prepared  laboratory or workroom, similar

to an alchemists laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If

the creator is personally constructing the creatures body, the

building and the ritual can be performed together.

A  gauntlet  guardian  with  more  than  4  Hit  Dice  can  be

created,  but  each  additional  Hit  Die  adds  2,000  gp  to  the

market  price,  and  the  price  increases  by  10,000  gp  if  the

creatures  size  increases  to  Medium,  modifying  the  cost  to

create accordingly.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Construct (see page 303

Because its usually a familiar, a blade guardian has the same

base attack bonus as its master.

This  human-shaped  creature  of  metal  is  covered  in  spikes.  Where  its

hands should be are instead two whirling blades.

When  they  are  created,  blade  guardians  are  forever  tied  to

their  masters  with  a  familiars  bond.  Unlike  the  general

assistance  that  most  familiars  provide,  blade

guardians  exist  only  to  fight  on  their

masters behalf.

A  blade  guardian  is  capable  of  car-

rying  out  complex  tasks  that  involve

combat in some way. If its not carrying

out a speci c command, it stays near its

master,  attacking  anyone  who  attacks

her.

A  blade  guardian  is  some  6  feet  tall

and weighs more than 400 pounds.

Combat

Blade  guardians  are  relentless  combatants,  strik-

ing  at  foes  with  their  whirling  blade-arms  and

rarely straying far from their masters.

Find Master (Su): No matter the distance, as

long as it is on the same plane, a blade guardian can  nd

its master.

Guard (Ex): A blade guardian moves swiftly

to defend its master by its side, blocking blows

and  disrupting  foes.  All  attacks  against  the

master take a 2 penalty if the blade guardian is

adjacent.

Spell Storing (Sp): A blade guardian can

store one spell of 3rd level or lower that is

cast into it by another creature. It uses this

spell  when  commanded  or  when  a  pre-

determined situation arises. Once this

spell is used, it can store another spell

(or the same spell).

Construction

A  blade  guardian  is  built  from  wood,

silver,  stone,  and  steel.  The  materials  cost

4,000 gp. The guardians master may assemble the body or

hire someone to do the job. Creating the body re quires a DC

16 Profession (engineering) check. After the body is sculpted,

the blade guardian is animated through an extended magical

ritual that requires a specially prepared  laboratory or work-

room,  similar  to  an  alchemists  laboratory  and  costing  500

gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the

creatures body, the building and the ritual can be performed

together.

A blade guardian with more than 8 Hit Dice can be cre-

ated, but each additional Hit Die adds 3,000 gp to the market

price, and the price increases by 15,000 gp if the creatures

size increases to Large, modifying the cost to create accord-

ingly.

Caster  Level:  11th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Construct  (see  page

303  of  the  Monster  Manual),  fabricate,  locate  creature,  Tensers

This  category  of  the  Perform  skill  covers  any  sort  of

weapon display, such as twirling a sword or  ipping a dagger

from hand to hand. Despite the skills name, you can use it

121

when unarmed by demonstrating dif cult martial arts tech-

niques or shadow boxing against an imaginary opponent.

Check: Unlike other categories of the Perform skill, your

prowess  with  the  weapon  (indicated  by  your  base  attack

bonus)  is  an  important  factor  in  how  good  your  Perform

(weapon  drill)  skill  is.  Apply  half  your  base  attack  bonus

(rounded  down)  as  a  circumstance  bonus  on  Perform

(weapon drill) checks. Your Charisma modi er also applies,

as with any Perform check. If you arent pro cient with the

weapon youre using, you take the 4 nonpro ciency penalty

on Perform (weapon drill) checks.

Action:  Varies.  If  youre  performing  to  earn  money  in

public, a weapon drill requires at least 4 hours of 20-minute

performances, with breaks in between. If youre demonstrat-

ing your skill or trying to impress the crowd at a gladiator

match (see Chapter 4 of this book), the performance

is a standard action.

Try  Again:  Yes, but as with other uses of the

Perform skill, subsequent attempts after a failure

increase the DC of the Perform check by 2 for

each previous failure.

Special:  The  following  feats  each  grant

a  +2  bonus  on  relevant  Perform  (weapon

drill) checks: Combat Expertise, Greater

Weapon  Focus,  Quick  Draw,  Two-

Weapon  Fighting,  Weapon  Focus,

and Whirlwind Attack.

A  bard  cannot  use  Perform

(weapon drill) checks to perform

his bardic music abilities (inspire

courage, fascinate, and so on).

KNOWLEDGE

Several  categories  of  knowledge

can be useful to a martial character.

Check: In addition to the checks described in the Players

Handbook, the following aspects of the Knowledge skill may

prove useful.

Architecture  and  Engineering:  If  you  have  a  good  vantage

point  to  view  an  enemy  stronghold,  a  DC  20  Knowledge

(architecture and engineering) check reveals a weak aspect

of the defense. For every 5 points by which your check results

exceeds the DC, the DM can give you another strategy tip

for assaulting the fortress. If you have an accurate map of the

stronghold, you gain a +5 circumstance bonus on the check.

History:  With  a  successful  DC  15  Knowledge  (history)

check, you know the basics of how a particular army orga-

nizes itself. For example, a successful check reveals that bug-

bears include a shaman in every 20-soldier platoon, or that elf

generals often ride with the cavalry.

If  youre  standing  on  or  near  a  historic  battle eld,  you

can recall the details of the battle fought there with a DC 20

Knowledge (history) check. You know, for example, that the

dwarves of the Brass Hills defeated the orc hordes by starting

an avalanche on the hills to your left, and that most of the sur-

viving orcs retreated into the lava tubes somewhere ahead.

Local:  A  DC  10  Knowledge  (local)  check  is  suf cient  to

identify  a  military  unit  or  nobles  family  by  its  heraldry,  if

the unit or the family hails from the local area. A Knowledge

(nobility and royalty) check is required to identify the her-

aldry from far-off lands.

Nobility  and  Royalty:  A  Knowledge  (nobility  and  royalty)

check  tells  you  something  about  the  heraldry  of  far-off

lands. A DC 25 check tells you what part of the world (down

to the province or city) a heraldic design comes from. A DC

30 check tells you the name of the military unit or the noble

family.

Action: Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge

check doesnt take an actionyou simply know the answer

or you dont.

Try Again: No. The check represents what you know,

and thinking about a topic a second time doesnt

let you know something that you never

learned in the  rst place.

Synergy:  There  are  no  bonuses

for  skill  synergy  speci c  to  the

Knowledge  checks  described

above,  but  the  Players  Handbook

describes many bonuses that apply to

the Knowledge skill in general.

Untrained:  An  untrained  Knowl-

edge  check  is  simply  an  Intelligence

check. Without actual training, you know

only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).

SLEIGHT OF HAND

If you palm a dagger in combat, you can surprise

your opponent when it suddenly appears in your

hand.

Check: For this technique to work, you must be

armed  with  a  dagger,  must  have  the  Quick  Draw  feat,  and

must  be  holding  nothing  in  your  off  hand.  You  must   ght

the  same  foe  for  at  least  2  consecutive  rounds  to  get  your

opponent used to the idea that you have nothing in your off

hand. At the beginning of your turn in the third round, make

a  Sleight  of  Hand  check  opposed  by  your  opponents  Spot

check. If you succeed, your foe is considered  at-footed for

the next single attack you make with the dagger.

Action: Unlike other uses of the Sleight of Hand skill, its

a free action to put the dagger in your hand because you have

the Quick Draw feat.

Try  Again:  No.  Whether  your  Sleight  of  Hand  check

succeeds or fails, no foe will fall for the same trick from you

twice in the same combat.

Special:  If  you  have  the  Deft  Hands  feat,  you  get  a  +2

bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.

Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2

bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.

ost  fantasy  sagas  are  replete  with  massive

armies  stretching  across  the  horizon,  clash-

ing  in  battles  that  involve  tens  of  thousands

of soldiers. The D&D game is focused on small

groups of characters, but such grand battles can make an

exciting  backdrop  for  adventures.  Low-level  characters

might be foot soldiers, facing off against a horde of orcs

determined to loot and burn more civilized lands. Mid- to

high-level characters could be elite commandos and shock

troops, taking on missions behind enemy lines to capture

or  destroy  key  installations.  Because  the  battle eld  is  a

turbulent  place,  the  characters  can  be  thrust  into  new

situations and new dangers at a moments notice.

Whether you plan to make warfare central to your D&D

game or an occasional diversion, decide what a grand battle

looks like in your campaign.

TWO VIEWS OF

FANTASY WARFARE

The  D&D  game  is  clearly  rooted  in  the  medieval  warfare

tradition. Soldiers wear chainmail or plate armor, and they

wield  weapons  such  as  swords  and  bows.  Knights  gallop

across the battle eld on horses, and catapults bombard castle

walls. Yet, the presence of fantastic creatures and magic sup-

ports  a  more  modern  kind  of  warfare,  in  which   ying

creatures provide air support, soldiers use camou age or

magic to hide themselves from enemies, and spells that

affect a large area can devastate clusters of troops.

Its useful to think of D&D warfare as a continuum

with  historical  medieval  warfare  on  one  end  and

modern  warfare  on  the  other  end.  Before  you  take

your D&D game to the battle eld, decide where on

that continuum you want your battles to be.

HISTORICAL WARFARE

Medieval armies marched in rank and  le for a simple

reason. In a world without radios, accurate maps, and

global  positioning  systems,  marching  in  one  orga-

nized  group  was  the  only  way  to  make  sure  every

soldier made it to the bat tle eld and followed orders

once there. Amid the din of battle, soldiers have to be

able to hear the shouted orders of their commanders,

so they couldnt spread out very much.

Because  historical  armies  marched  in  rows

and columns, obtaining cover and concealment

is  next  to  impossible.  Battle elds  are  often  large

plains, because only in such places can each general stay

in contact with the armys units. Camou age isnt an

issue, so armies wear colorful uniforms and carry  123

620_17664_CompleteWar3.indd   123

9/12/03, 4:12:09 PM

standards identifying their unit to make it easy to tell friend

from foe. Generals send runners with new orders to units, and

because the units are easy to identify and reach, those orders

are likely to reach subordinate commanders. Catapults are the

only artillery weapons, and theyre rare sights except during

castle sieges. Horse-mounted cavalry was a powerful force on

the battle eld, because it could reach the critical ground in a

battle quickly. The high walls and arrow slits of a castle provide

excellent protect for the defending army; a siege against a well-

supplied stronghold can go on for years.

The biggest advantage to historical warfare is that it feels

properly  epic,  with  row  after  row  of  grim-faced  soldiers

marching in lockstep toward the enemy. Castles and knights

are central to battles in the medieval tradition, and unit tac-

tics  respect  the  dif culties  of  communication,  navigation,

and command.

Historical warfare doesnt always interact well with magic

or  monsters.  A  single   reball  can  devastate  large  groups  of

marching troops, and high-CR monsters can wade through

column after column of foot soldiers with impunity. Tradi-

tional castles are hard to defend against enemies who can  y

or teleport.

If you want your D&D battles to include a strong historical

element, use feats such as Hold the Line and Phalanx Fight-

ing to bolster the effectiveness of soldiers in formation. Have

soldiers prepare for spells that affect a large area by thinning

out their ranks with the disperse maneuver (see Historical

Tactics,  below).  Make   ying  creatures  and  monsters  with

magical abilities rare on the battle eld.

Historical Tactics

Soldiers marching in rows and columns commonly employ

the following techniques to increase their effectiveness on

the battle eld.

Arrow Volley: If at least ten archers are in a contiguous

group (each one adjacent to at least one other), they can loose

a high, arcing volley of arrows as a full-round action. Rather

than aiming at a speci c target, they concentrate their arrows

in a speci c area, hoping to hit whatevers there. Because they

 re in such a high arc, they can ignore any concealment and

cover thats not essentially a roof.

The commander of the archers (generally an of cer or vet-

eran soldier) makes a special attack roll using only his base

attack  bonus,  Intelligence  modi er,  and  range  increment

penalty. If the attack hits, arrows land in the target squares,

which must have the same shape as the archers in the group.

For example, if two rows of  ve archers each hit with an arrow

volley, arrows land in a two-square by  ve-square area.

If the arrow volley misses its intended target, it still lands

somewhere. Refer to the diagram on page 158 of the Players

Handbook to determine the misdirection of the attack.

Any creature in a square where an arrow lands must suc-

ceed on a DC 15 Re ex save or take damage from the arrow.

Because each arrow expends much of its energy getting to

the high point in its  ight, an archers Strength bonus doesnt

apply to the damage roll even if the archer is wielding a com-

posite bow.

Set  for  Charge:  A  halberd,  longspear,  spear,  trident,  or

dwarven  urgrosh  can  be  set  against  a  charge  as  a  readied

action. If a charging foe moves into a threatened square, the

soldier who set against the charge makes an attack (with the

charging  foe  taking  a  2  penalty  to  AC)  that  deals  double

damage on a successful hit. If a noncharging foe moves into

a threatened square, the soldier who set against the charge

can still make an attack but wont deal double damage.

A formation can have spears, tridents, halberds, or dwarven

urgroshes in the  rst rank and longspears (which have reach)

in the second row to get double coverage on the squares just

in front of the formation. In such a case, the charging crea-

tures gain a +4 bonus to Armor Class against the longspears

in the second row because the soldiers in the front row give

the charging creatures cover.

Phalanx: A formation of soldiers advancing under a hail of

ranged attacks may raise their shields to protect themselves at

the cost of speed and attack capability. To do this, the soldiers

all take the total defense action (see page 142 of the Players

Handbook). Soldiers on the outer edge of the formation gain

a +4 bonus to Armor Class and ones on the inside gain a +8

bonus (+4 for total defense and +4 for the cover their fellow

soldiers provide them).

Disperse: If soldiers in rank-and- le formation are con-

cerned about spells that affect a large area, they sometimes

advance  at  their  speed  every  round,  then  ready  an  action

in  order  to  disperse  if  they  hear  a  command  to  do  so.  The

commander,  and  sometimes  scouts  deployed  ahead  of  the

formation, can ready an action to give the disperse command

if they see a spellcaster or monster that might be about to use

such a spell.

When  a  formation  disperses,  soldiers  on  its  perimeter

make a single move away from the center of the formation,

and everyone else moves to a space not adjacent to any other

soldier. This dispersal can help to reduce the casualties from

a  reball, ice storm, or other spell that affects a large area.

This tactic is effective, but it comes with a cost: The forma-

tion cant move twice its speed each round. This disadvantage

may expose the formation to more danger, either from ranged

attacks or from melee attacks made by enemies that overtake

the soldiers.

MODERN-INSPIRED WARFARE

Its  not  hard  to  imagine  a  different  means  of  waging  war.

By  replacing  technology  with  magic  and  monsters,  D&D

armies can employ tactics and techniques that wouldnt be

out  of  place  on  the  21st-century  battle eld.  A  band  of  elf

rangers might hug the tree line on the edge of the forest,

seeking  concealment  and  cover  among  the  trees.  Every

squad of soldiers might have a cleric to act as medic, a rogue

sniper, and a sorcerer to provide  re support with lightning

bolts. Dragons can provide combat air patrols. Teleporting

monsters  function  as  paratroopers,  suddenly  appearing

behind enemy lines or seizing important objectives. Whis-

pering  wind  and  message  spells  can  provide  instantaneous

communication between battle eld commanders.

Powerful  monsters  and  magic  rule  the  modern-inspired

battle eld.  Giants  and  other  big  monsters  are  the  D&D

equivalent of tanks: fast, frightening, and built to absorb a lot

of punishment. Low-level foot soldiers tend to dig in, relying

on cover and concealment to protect them. Foot soldiers also

disperse more widely and use ranged attacks more often; even

 fty 1st-level warriors cant bring down a giant in melee, but

they can wear it down with arrows, and if theyre spread out,

the giant wont kill more than a few of them each round.

Castles and other strongholds are harder to defend, espe-

cially against an enemy who can  y, teleport, or use magic to

turn your fortress walls to mud. Thus, underground strong-

holds (dungeons, in other words) are popular, because they

cant be attacked from above, and enemies who dont know

their layouts cant teleport into them.

The  advantage  of  modern-inspired  warfare  is  that  its

familiar to players, and it rewards smart tactics and the tools

that  mid-  to  high-level  characters  have  at  their  disposal.

The Dungeon Master can take material from countless war

movies and real-life battles for adventure ideas. Combat has

a great deal of variety because the warfare embraces fantastic

monsters and powerful spells.

Modern-inspired warfare can be very deadly to low-level

characters  because  the  battle eld  is  rich  with  powerful

monsters and magic. A single  reball that deals 5d6 points

of damage kills almost every 1st-level character, as does a

frost giant marauding through the front lines. A modern-

style  battle  also  lacks  some  of  the  grandeur  of  a  histori-

cal  set-piece  battle.  To  an  observer,  the  modern-inspired

battle eld is a seemingly deserted place; everyone is dug

in or hiding, because standing out in the open makes you

an inviting target.

Modern-Inspired Tactics

Magic,  monsters,  and  high-level  characters  can  combine

in all sorts of clever ways on the battle eld. The following

tactics are representative of warfare in a high-fantasy battle

in the modern style.

Aerial Recon: Giant eagles have a Spot modi er of +15, so

they make excellent scouts, circling the battle eld at great

altitude  to  watch  troop  movements.  A  giant  eagle  can   y

higher than 300 feet still and have a better than even chance

of spotting a Huge creature (or 10 Medium creatures moving

as a unit). Unless the creatures on the ground are speci cally

scanning the sky for the giant eagle, it takes a DC 26 Spot

check to notice the eagle at that height.

Clerical Medics: For half the price of a suit of full plate

armor, a 1st-level cleric can be equipped with a fully charged

wand of cure light wounds. Such a cleric typically prepares bless

(to use before battle) and entropic shield and sanctuary to keep

him safe while he runs, wand in hand, from wounded soldier

to wounded soldier.

Fire Support: A squad of infantry often includes one or

more  spellcasters  who  can  bring  arcane   repower  to  bear

on the battle. A 4th-level sorcerer, for example, can cast four

scorching ray spells and have plenty of mage armor and shield

spells in reserve to protect himself. Equip him with a wand of

magic missile (750 gp) and three scrolls of  reball (375 gp each),

and you have the sorcerous equivalent of a machine gun and

rocket launcherand it costs less to equip the sorcerer than

a typical knight.

Specialized  Troops:  Sahuagin  make  effective  marines;

they can establish a beachhead in enemy territory by swim-

ming ashore at night and slaughtering the coastal guard, and

they can swarm a ship at anchor, attacking the crew or simply

bull rushing them off the deck to be eaten by waiting sharks.

Barghests  can  use  dimension  door  once  per  day  to  instantly

move  up  to  640  feet  and  are  effective  trackers,  so  they  can

function as paratroopers of a sort and seize key objectives in

advance of the main army.

Blitzkrieg: With a speed of 50 feet, winter wolves are as

fast  as  all  but  the  fastest  horses.  They  have  a  strong  melee

attack  and  a  breath  weapon  thats  effective  against  massed

troops, so winter wolves can often punch a hole in a defensive

line that slower troops can then exploit.

Behind  Enemy  Lines:  A  team  of  4th-level  bards  can

easily slip behind enemy lines by using invisibility or alter self

(perhaps in conjunction with Bluff, Disguise, and Diplomacy

checks). Once in the enemy rear, they can use detect thoughts

or  suggestion  to  gather  intelligence  and  an  animal  messenger

spell to report what they have learned back to headquarters.

A MERCENARY CAMPAIGN

Traditional  D&D  campaigns  feature  site-based  adventures

prominently. PCs typically explore a dungeon,  ght the evil

creatures they  nd there, and carry the treasure back to civi-

lization. Its also possible to build an entire campaign around

the PCs as part of a larger military organization. Rather than

exploring dungeons, they  ght the enemy on the battle eld,

undertaking dangerous missions that might mean victory or

defeat for the larger army.

Many  such  campaigns  have  the  characters  as  part  of  a

mercenary  out t  or  guerrilla  organization  rather  than  as

part of the regular army, because its easier to imagine that

a human sorcerer, two dwarf  ghter/rogues, and a half-elf

druid  would  be  assigned  the  same  mission  in  a  military

organization  that  prizes   exibility.  Low-level  characters

begin as foot soldiers, and they become specialists as they

rise  in  level.  Eventually,  they  may  become  an  elite  unit,

earning  the  admiration  of  their  comrades  and  inspiring

fear in the enemy. Some PCs may rise through the ranks to

have an army at their command.

A  mercenary  campaign  is  a  good  choice  if  your  players

enjoy  the  tactical  challenges  that  D&D  combat  offers.  It

promises plenty of action and danger, and the players never

lack  for  a  good   ght.  Players  often  enjoy  planning  their

military operations, then seeing them come to fruition on

the battle eld. The PCs usually know who the bad guys are

and where they can be found. Many players appreciate the

rewards  beyond  better  equipment  and  experience  points,

hoping  to  earn  higher  ranks,  posting  to  better  units,  and

decorations for valor and success.

You  dont  have  to  change  much  about  your  D&D  game;

the games use of the word campaign to describe a series of

related adventures has its roots in wargaming and military

history. Combat is central to the game rules. The Challenge

Rating system works just as well on the battle eld as it does

in the dungeon. Some differences do exist between a merce-

nary campaign and a traditional one, however.

Clarity of Purpose: Many DMs devote a lot of effort to

developing character hooks to draw the PCs into an adven-

ture and convince them to risk danger. In a mercenary cam-

paign, the PCs know that theyre being paid to  ght. In short,

the DM doesnt need to convince the characters to come to

the battle eld, because theyre already there, and they know

what theyre expected to do.

Following Orders: Its easy to start an adventure in a mer-

cenary campaign by simply having a superior of cer show

up and order the PCs into battle. But some players chafe at

following detailed orders because they miss out on planning

the  operation  themselves,  while  others  expect  the  NPC  in

command to direct their every action. Adventures work best

if  the  superior  of cer  simply  identi es  the  objective,  such

as  seize  that  stronghold  or  defend  that  hill,  leaving  the

details of the mission to the PCs. This mission  exibility is

another reason why less formal organizations such as merce-

nary companies are a good choice for PCs.

The  DM  shouldnt  force  characters  to  slavishly  follow

orders.  The  consequences  for  disobeying  an  order  should

match  the  circumstances  and  importance  of  the  order  in

the   rst  place,  unless  the  DM  has  a  particular  reason  for

being  harsh  or  lenient.  Did  the  characters  fail  to  take  the

hill  because  two  of  the  four  PCs  were  gravely  wounded?

Most commanders call it a failed mission and leave it at that.

Did the PCs teleport into the city to shop when they should

have been defending the castle walls? Have the commander

devise a suitable punishment.

War Has Its Own Tempo: When PCs explore a dungeon,

theyre  free  to  leave  when  theyre  wounded,  rest  for  a  few

days, and return on their own schedule. When the characters

undertake a military mission, other unitsand potentially

the whole armymight depend on the characters achieving

their  objective  at  a  certain  time.  The  time  pressure  makes

the PCs job more dif cult, but being on the clock can add

urgency and excitement to the adventure. Time pressure is a

challenge like any other, and the DM should account for it

when planning a military adventure.

Conversely, most wars are interrupted by lulls in the  ght-

ing as the armies re t for their next operation, train new sol-

diers, and wait for a move from the enemy. By including some

downtime during a war, the DM can give PCs time to create

magic items and research spells without feeling like theyre

missing something.

The  Armys  Behind  You:  Because  the  PCs  are  assigned

missions  with  timetables,  they  have  less  freedom  than  they

would in a traditional campaign. Because theyre part of a large

organization, they can rely on a lot more support than a small

band of dungeon delvers has at its disposal. If the PCs mission

is important, smart commanders devote more resources to it.

NPCs are often assigned to assist the PCs. A cleric may act as

a medic, or a ranger as a guide and scout. Perhaps a dragon pro-

vides air support for a mission, or a group of gnome illusion-

ists distracts the enemy before the PCs attack. The characters

might  also  be  given  equipment  or  spells  important  to  their

mission.  Mid-level  PCs  facing  a  vampire  spawn  army  might

be temporarily issued maces of disruption. Low-level characters

asked  to  sneak  into  an  enemy  outpost  might  have  extended

invisibility spells cast on them before they move out.

Even if the characters werent assigned extra help for their

mission, they might be able to get assistance in the middle of

the battle if their plans go awry. If the PCs are pinned down

at the edge of the forest, a whispering wind message back to

headquarters  could  call  for  another  unit  to  bombard  the

enemy with catapult stones.

Rank Matters, to a Point: Its natural that as characters

gain experience and attain levels, their status in the military

improves as well. Promotions can be an effective extra reward

for the successful completion of a mission, and players gen-

erally appreciate the privileges of rankeven simple things

such as being saluted by NPCs.

Issues of rank and authority can make the game less fun if

theyre not handled carefully. Some players of high-level PCs

may resent taking orders from superior of cers who clearly

arent as personally powerful as they are. You can minimize

this problem if the generals identify broad objectives such as

disrupt supplies to the gnoll army and let the PCs  gure out

how to pull it off. Looking at it from the generals perspective,

they have every reason to treat the high-level PCs gingerly, as

long as they get results.

Rank  can  also  become  divisive  if  some  PCs  wind  up  in

command  of  other  PCs.  As  long  as  the  higher-ranking  PC

consults  with  the  other  PCs  and  doesnt  just  pull  rank  on

them,  this  situation  doesnt  need  to  become  a  problem.

However, if one player feels like he can order other players

around whenever he wants, thats a recipe for trouble at the

game table. The easiest way to avoid this problem, of course,

is to keep all the PCs at the same rank. As long as the players

police themselves and dont abuse their authority with other

players, a difference in rank wont be a problem.

NPCs, of course, are fair game. Many players take great glee

in ordering around NPCs and shouting like drill sergeants.

Giving the PCs that authority is an important part of a mer-

cenary campaign, because it emphasizes that everyone in the

militaryPC and NPC alikeis playing by the same rules.

Players are more likely to accept orders when they see NPCs

accepting orders from them.

PCs  Fail  to  Reach  Enemy  Rear:  The  PCs  army  retreats  by

noon, and the enemy army captures or surrounds some units.

The PCs might get orders to attempt a rescue.

PCs  Are  Captured  or  Pinned  Down  in  Enemy  Territory:  The

enemy army advances rapidly, exploiting major gaps in the

lines  of  the  PCs  army.  The  PCs  must  extricate  themselves

from  their  desperate  situation  and  reach  friendly  territory

before the next major assault.

While the list above has PC success paralleling the armys

success,  that  shouldnt  always  be  the  case.  Sometimes  the

PCs army loses a  ght despite the characters best efforts, and

sometimes the army succeeds even if the characters mission

fails.  In  this  case,  the  possible  outcomes  describe  varying

degrees of success or failure. The players shouldnt feel like

the DM is writing the story of the war to match their per-

sonal victories, but they should feel like things would have

been worse but for the PCs presence.

Treasure  or  Gear:  In  a  traditional  dungeon-based  cam-

paign,  characters  get  treasure  by  defeating  monsters  and

use  it  to  buy  equipment  that  makes  them  more  powerful.

A lot less treasure tends to be lying around in a mercenary

campaign. The characters are being paid if theyre mercenar-

ies,  and  they  can  take  some  gear  from  the  bodies  of  fallen

or captured enemies. Because theyre not facing creatures in

their lairs, they may fall behind the character wealth by level

 gures given on Table 51, page 135 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide.

The  DM  can  make  up  for  this  de ciency  by  having  the

army issue the characters more and better gear as they attain

higher levels. Superior equipment can also be supplied for

particularly dangerous missions. In most cases, the DM can

As the players get used to the requisition system, they wont

waste time collecting every last weapon from dead enemies

because they know that they will receive a just reward in the

form of periodic equipment upgrades. Like real soldiers, the

characters may still grab souvenirs and valuable items from

fallen enemies.

MERCENARY MINI-ADVENTURES

The DM can roll or choose from the previous tables to launch

an adventure centered on a mission the PCs must carry out.

Once you have one mission and one or more complications

and  support  units,  you  have  the  seeds  of  your  next  D&D

session.

For example, a DM for 4th-level PCs might roll 04 on the

mission table, 99 and 53 on the complication table, and 84 and

51 on the support table. For that evenings D&D game, the

adventure centers on an assault on a riverbank tower guarded

by gnolls. The DM sketches a map of the tower and populates

it with gnolls and hyenas. Before they move out, characters

are offered support in the form of magical stealth (invisibility

spells, in this case) to sneak up on the tower, but they will

have to deal with the hyenas, which have the scent ability.

The DM uses the two complications in the second part of

the adventure. Once they have taken the tower, the PCs see

bugbear skirmishers about to ambush a friendly patrol across

the river. The PCs have to choose between guarding the tower

and helping their allies. Finally, the DM plans to introduce

waves of gnolls trying to retake the tower (in EL 4 groups).

The characters must hold out long enough for unicorn-riding

elves to relieve them shortly after dawn.

SPORTING COMBAT

Combat  is  ordinarily  a  deadly  business,  but  its  action  and

danger  appeal  to  many  spectators.  Many  fantasy  cultures

have developed sports and diversions that put the warriors

skills  to  use.  Jousts,  gladiatorial  matches,  and  archery  con-

tests  are  perhaps  the  most  common  examples  of  combat-

inspired  sports,  but  in  a  diverse  fantasy  world  there  are

countless others.

Sporting combat is a good way for characters to earn expe-

rience  points  in  nonlethal  (or  at  least  less  lethal)  settings,

and winning a contest can enhance a characters reputation.

A recent winner of a sporting combat generally gets a bonus

(+2 for routine contests and +4 for championship events) to

improve an NPCs attitude if the NPC saw the victory. Many

sporting  combats  come  with  prizes  (cash,  jewelry,  or  art

objects) as well.

Each  type  of  competition  described  below  includes  a

suggested  experience  point  award  for  winning  a  sporting

combat. These awards are appropriate if such events are only

occasional occurrences in your campaign. If your D&D game

relies heavily on nonlethal sporting events, you may want to

develop your own rules for advancing in level. In most cam-

paigns, characters shouldnt be able to attain levels simply by

winning archery contests at the viscounts estate.

JOUSTS

In a traditional joust, two knights on horseback charge each

other with blunted lances, separated by a rail that divides two

parallel  tracks.  When  they  meet  in  the  middle,  they  clash

with  great  momentum  and  force,  then  continue  down  the

track on their side of the rail. They repeat the process until

one knight yields or is knocked from the saddle. A great deal

of pageantry and ritual accompanies most jousts, and colorful

heraldry, dress, or banners often identify knights.

Because the jousters are running full-tilt at one another

with  blunted  weapons,  jousts  function  differently  from

mounted  combat.  Initiative  isnt  necessary;  during  each

pass,  each  knight  simply  makes  a  special  attack  with  the

blunted lance, and the results of both attacks are resolved

simultaneously. Each knight makes an attack roll normally;

if it hits, the knight can also attempt to unhorse the rider

(treat as a trip attack) or make a sunder attempt against the

enemys  weapon  or  shield.  Neither  the  trip  attempt  nor

the  sunder  attempt  provokes  an  attack  of  opportunity.  A

successful  blow  deals  lance  damage  (doubled  because  the

knights  are  both  charging),  but  its  nonlethal  damage.  A

knight  with  the  Ride-By  Attack  feat  gains  a  +4  bonus  on

attack rolls during a joust.

In some versions of a joust, a knight can continue with a

blunted  longsword  if  he  loses  his  lance.  Such  a  longsword

deals  nonlethal  damage  and  can  make  the  free  sunder

attempt described above, but not the trip attack.

The  most  obvious  variation  on  the  traditional  joust  is

simply  to  use  real  lances  and  attack  with  lethal  force.  This

functions  exactly  as  normal  mounted  combat,  except  that

a knight can still make a free trip or sunder attempt if his

attack hits (the momentum of two opposing charges makes

these special attacks possible, not the prowess of the knights).

Another  variant  is  to  use  steeds  other  than  horses,  includ-

ing such exotic choices as worgs, hippogriffs, dire boars, or

pegasi. The githyanki have jousts riding red dragons, and the

dragons themselves attack each other during each pass.

Because  theyre  most  likely  to  have  a  steed  and  ranks  in

Ridenot to mention the diplomatic skills to put the victors

bonus on NPC attitudes to good usepaladin PCs are most

likely to be drawn into a joust. Fighters have the skills and

feats  to  make  good  jousters,  as  do  barbarians  and  rangers,

though  the  latter  two  classes  have  a  hard  time  riding  and

 ghting in heavy armor. Other classes lack the horsemanship

or pro ciency with the lance to make effective jousters, but

they can help a combatant in other ways. Clerics can cast ben-

e cial spells on steed and rider, for example, while a bard can

use music to inspire a knight. Given enough imagination, any

PC can be effective in a joust. The sight of a wizard mounted

on a phantom steed with a glowing Mordenkainens sword  oat-

ing at her side gives pause to even a con dent knight.

2 Special modi ers apply to this check. See the appropriate skill description in the Players Handbook.

3 If you are tripped or disarmed yourself in a failed attempt, the attitude toward you worsens.

4 If you fall prone during a failed attempt, the attitude toward you worsens.

In  more  exotic  gladiatorial  matches,  there  may  be  other

ways to in uence the crowd. In a match featuring gladiators

on horseback, for example, being knocked from the saddle

might worsen the crowds attitude toward you by one step. If

the crowd is composed of mind  ayers, a successful coup de

grace that reveals your opponents brains may improve the

crowds attitude by two steps.

While  one-on-one  gladiator  contests  are  the  most

common, team matches are also popular (and may be more

convenient, because all PCs can participate). One common

variation pits a single Large or Huge creature against a team

of  smaller  gladiators.  Occasionally,  a  gladiatorial  match

includes mounted combat or ranged combat.

Its also commonplace for match organizers to add terrain

elements to make a  ght more memorable or deadly. Some-

times two gladiators  ght atop tall platforms, attempting to

bull  rush  each  other  to  their  doom.  Some  organizers  hide

weapons all over the arena, leading to a mad scramble as the

gladiators arm themselves. Sometimes a maze or stockade is

built inside the arena, although spectators will not likely pay

to attend a gladiator match they cant see.

To award experience for gladiator matches, calculate the

Encounter Level for the match normally, but cut the experi-

ence point award by 25% to 50% if the matchs equipment or

rules make it less lethal than a normal combat. If the match

is deliberately unfair (which usually happens only when the

match serves as punishment), increase the experience point

award for the underdog by up to 25%.

ARCHERY CONTESTS

Whether  they  use  a  bow  in  warfare  or  for  hunting,  good

archers  relish  the  chance  to  test  their  mettle  against  their

peers.  Unlike  jousts  and  gladiatorial  matches,  archery

contests require very little in the way of extra equipment

although the archery tests favored by the nobility sometimes

include elaborate mannequins as targets.

In  the  simplest  form  of  archery  contest,  a  round  target

divided  into  three  concentric  sections  is  placed  150  feet

away. The outermost section of the target is Tiny (AC 7), the

next section in is Diminutive (AC 9), and the inner bulls-

eye is Fine (AC 13). Each archer gets  ve arrows, earning 4

points for every hit in the bullseye, 2 points for every hit

in the outer circle, and 1 point for every arrow that hits the

edge of the target. Compare the attack roll against each of

the three Armor Classes in turn, from the bullseye outward.

If two or more archers are tied with the most points once

everyone has had a turn, the targets are moved to 250 feet

away and the tied archers each shoot  ve arrows again. If

theyre still tied, they each shoot  ve arrows at a target 350

feet away. If theyre still tied after that, contest organizers

typically declare a tie or settle the matter with arrows  red

at moving targets.

Its possiblebut exceedingly dif cultto hit and split an

arrow thats already lodged in the bullseye. Such an arrow has

an AC of 35.

The most common variation is to arrange a moving target;

mounting the target on a wagon or swinging it like a pen-

dulum from a tree limb are two simple ways to increase the

dif culty. Either technique increases the AC of the targets

by 5. Elf archers play a game where one identi es a far-off

Fine target, typically a  uttering leaf or swaying branch. Each

other archer  res an arrow as quickly as possible, rolling ini-

tiative  to  see  who  goes   rst.  The  elves  then  walk  over  and

examine the target, and whoever hit the target  rst or came

the closest if they all missed (the highest attack roll) chooses

the next target. The drow play a similar game, but they use

 eeing goblins as targets.

To award experience for an archery contest, treat it as an

encounter  with  a  creature  of  a  CR  equal  to  the  best  NPC

archer, and cut the award by 50% to account for the lack of

danger. Only the winner earns experience points.

CONJURERS CHESS

This elaborate contest pits two spellcasters against each other

in a test of their ability to summon  ghting creatures from

other planes. It requires that the spellcasters be able to cast

summon monster spells numerous times and that they be able

to communicate with the called creatures. Accordingly, its

the  province  of  mid-  to  high-level  conjurers,  not  an  enter-

tainment for the masses.

The two spellcasters agree to a number of calling rounds

(four  is  typical)  and  a  time  limit  (1  minute  is  common,

although lower-level casters sometimes opt for 30 seconds).

The spellcasters move to opposite corners of the chessboard

(a 10-by-10-square area on the battle grid).

At the start of each of the calling rounds, a referee rolls a

die (usually a d4 or d6) and calls out a number. The two con-

jurers each cast a summon monster spell, choosing a monster

from the list that corresponds to that number. For example, if

the referee rolls a 4, the conjurers can summon any monster

from the summon monster IV list. They need not cast summon

monster  IV,  however;  they  could  cast  summon  monster  V  to

get 1d3 monsters or summon monster VI to get 1d4+1 mon-

sters. Any summoned monster must appear adjacent to the

conjurer  who  summoned  it,  or  as  close  to  that  conjurer  as

possible.

In  subsequent  calling  rounds,  two  things  happen:  The

conjurers  cast  summon  monster  again,  based  on  a  new  die

roll from the referee, and monsters summoned in previous

calling rounds may move one square in any direction. Each

conjurer  is  responsible  for  directing  the  summoned  mon-

sters, and if they ever move more than one square per round

or leave the grid, that conjurer forfeits the contest.

If  opposing  monsters  wind  up  in  the  same  square,  they

 ght at the direction of their summoner. Once the calling

rounds are over, the conjurers continue to direct their crea-

tures until the time limit is reached. At that point, whichever

conjurer has creatures in the most squares of the grid is the

winner.

The  most  common  variation  on  conjurers  chess  is  to

change the die rolled by the referee, the number of calling

rounds, or the time limit. To award experience for a success-

ful game of conjurers chess, base the award on the CR of the

opponent, and reduce the award by 50% to account for the

lack of danger.

The  rst day begins with an archery contest (as described

above). Then contestants run an obstacle course that winds

its  way  around  the  estate,  featuring  walls  to  climb,  pits  to

jump, and narrow beams to cross. Finally, they have a single-

elimination  wrestling  matchyou  lose  if  youre  rendered

unconscious or pinned.

On the second day, the contestants have a single-elimina-

tion jousting tournament in the morning. At noon, they are

sent  out  into  a  nearby  forest  with  orders  to  bring  back  an

elusive albino dire boar for the evenings banquet. After the

banquet is the strangest event of allthe noblewoman says

to each contestant in turn, Impress me. She awards coins at

her sole discretion.

At noon on the  nal day, the contestants gather for the  nal

event: a single-elimination dueling tournament worth twice

the usual number of coins. Characters can have any nonmagi-

cal equipment they like except for ranged weapons. They can

cast spells as long as they dont do so before the duel begins.

Each duel lasts for exactly 1 minute and is fully lethal, but

both duelists have shield other cast on them by NPC clerics

before the  ght begins. You lose the duel if you yield to your

opponent, fall unconscious, or have taken more damage than

your opponent when the minute is up (in the judgment of the

host, who has a keen eye for wounds).

After another banquet, the noblewoman counts the coins

in each alabaster goblet, then declares a winner. The contes-

tant with the most coins gets to keep the cup (worth 1,000 gp,

although its considered unlucky to sell it) and has the right

to be called Champion of the Alabaster Cup.

To award experience for the events in the Alabaster Cup,

treat each days events as a single encounter with an EL equal

to a normal encounter with the signi cant NPC contestants.

As long as a character has more coins at days end than she

started with, he or she earns experience points for that day.

MAGIC ITEMS

The following magic items and special materials supplement

those described in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

ALABASTER CUP

NEW ARMOR SPECIAL ABILITIES

The Alabaster Cup is an example of the multievent sporting

contests that occur over the course of several days at many a

noble villa. Originally designed as a series of tests for would-

be knights of the realm, the Alabaster Cup has evolved into

an  annual  event  that  draws  hopeful  combatants  from  near

and far.

The contest consists of seven events held over three days.

A young noblewomantypically an unmarried daughter of

the noble who hosts the eventsits before a low table with

a dozen alabaster goblets: one for each contestant. After each

event, she drops three platinum coins in the winners cup,

two coins in the runner-ups cup, and one coin in the third-

place contestants cup. Then she takes half the coins out of

the last-place  nishers cup (if that cup has any coins).

Anti-Impact:  Armor  with  the  anti-impact  quality  is

designed to cushion the blow from massive blunt traumas.

Anti-impact  armor  doesnt  give  extra  protection  against

weapon  damage  (beyond  its  AC  bonus),  but  bludgeoning

damage  that  affects  all  or  most  of  the  entire  body  (such  as

constriction and falling damage) is halved.

Faint Abjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

feather fall; Price +2,000 gp.

Axeblock: This armor is magically enhanced to turn away

slashing weapons such as axes and most swords. The wearer

gains damage reduction 5/bludgeoning or piercing.

If  a  single  shield  or  suit  of  armor  has  two  of  the  three

blocking armor qualities (axeblock, hammerblock, and spear-

block), it grants its owner just 5 points of damage reduction

NEW WEAPON SPECIAL

ABILITIES

The  following  weapon  special  abilities

supplement  those  found  in  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide.

Blood Seeking: Weapons with the blood

seeking ability often have strange-looking

sights  on  them.  Ammunition   red  from

blood seeking weapons  ies around cover

if  necessary  to  strike  a  living  creature,

negating  any  bonus  to  Armor  Class  the

target might have due to intervening cover.

The shooter can even  re at a target with full

cover,  but  she  must  know  the  target  is  there,  there  must

be  an  unobstructed  path  for  the  ammunition  to  reach  the

target, and the target still has total concealment (and thus a

50% miss chance). The blood seeking ability doesnt function

against plants, oozes, undead, and constructs.

Moderate  divination;  CL  9th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, arcane eye; Price +1 bonus.

134

De  ecting:  If  youre  wielding  a  de ecting  weapon  of

your size or one size larger, you can try to knock projectiles

aimed at you out of the air. Once per round when you would

normally  be  hit  by  a  ranged  weapon,  you  may  make  a  DC

20 Re ex saving throw (if the ranged weapon has a magical

enhancement  bonus,  the  DC  increases  by  that  amount).  If

you succeed, the ranged weapon or projectile de ects away

harmlessly. You must be aware of the attack and not  at-

footed. Only melee weapons can have this ability.

Faint  transmutation;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms

and Armor, entropic shield; Price +1 bonus.

Disarming: This weapon ability functions dif-

ferently depending on whether its applied to a

melee weapon or a ranged weapon. If applied to

a melee weapon, the disarming ability elimi-

nates the opponents bonuses for both weapon

size  and  two-handed  weapons.  If  applied

to  a  ranged  weapon,  the  disarming  ability

makes possible a disarm attack; you can

shoot a weapon out of someones hand.

The relative weapon sizes dont matter

for a ranged disarm attempt, but the

defender gains a +4 bonus for wielding

a weapon in two hands.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL  11th;

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis;

Price +2 bonus.

Exit  Wound:  Weapons  with  the  exit

wound  ability  propel  their  ammunition

entirely  through  living  targets  they  hit.

This  effect  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of

damage.  The  weapon  or  projectile  con-

tinues  in  a  straight  line  beyond  the

original target. Targets in that path are

attacked  using  the  same  attack  roll  as

the original target; these additional targets

gain  a  +4  bonus  to  AC  for  each  previous

target  in  the  path.  When  an  exit  wound

weapon or projectile hits an object, it stops.

Explosive:  Always  slightly  warm

to the touch, weapons with the explosive ability deal extra

damage to anyone near the intended target. Each successful

hit with an explosive weapon deals 2d4 points of damage to

all targets in a 5-foot burst (Re ex DC 15 half), including the

original  target.  The  explosive  ability  can  be  applied  to  any

melee weapon (though the wielder may be subject to the extra

damage) or ranged weapon. Projectile weapons so enhanced

bestow the explosive ability on their ammunition.

Knockback: Knockback weapons often emit a low, almost

inaudible hum when drawn. Whenever a knockback weapon

hits  its  target,  it  initiates  a  bull  rush  attack  in  addition  to

dealing  normal  damage.  To  resolve  the  bull  rush  attempt,

treat the projectile as a Medium creature with a +8 Strength

bonus. The projectile doesnt provoke an attack of opportu-

nity, and it always tries to push the target as far back as pos-

sible. Only ranged weapons can have the knockback ability,

and they bestow it on their ammunition.

Last  Resort:  A  melee  weapon  (usually  a  dagger)  with

the  last  resort  ability  is  particularly  effective  in  a  grapple.

Its  wielder  doesnt  take  the  4  penalty  for  attacking  with

a  weapon  while  grappling,  and  the  weapon  deals  an  extra

1d6  points  of  damage  in  a  grapple  for  every  size  category

the target is bigger than the wielder. For example, a hal ing

armed  with  a  +1  last  resort  dagger  would  deal  an  extra  2d6

points of damage when being grappled by an ogre.

DESCRIPTIONS

The  following  weapons  supple-

ment those found in Chapter 7

of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Burrowing  Arrow:  This  +1

arrow  sticks  into  its  target  on  a  successful  hit  and  embeds

itself in the wound. A burrowing arrow must be pulled out

before  natural  healing  can  occur,  and  this  removal  deals  a

further 1d8 points of damage. If the target receives magical

healing, the burrowing arrow immediately deals 1d8 points of

damage as the magic forces it out of the wound.

Lance of the Last Rider: Whenever the wielder of this

weapon allows a free bull rush attempt on a successful hit. If

the bull rush attempt succeeds, the enemy rider moves back,

but the enemys mount stays where it is.

Ogliens Final Answer: This +2 spiked chain has a glit-

tering  sheen,  but  most  spellcasters  dont  identify  it  as

magic due to the persistent nondetection effect on it. A DC

NEW WONDROUS ITEMS

The  following  wondrous  items  supplement  those  found  in

Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Bracers  of  Dawn:  These  bejeweled  bracers  have  a  min-

iscule lens-and-dial contraption mounted on the exterior of

one bracer of the pair. When the dial is turned to the left, the

bracers  appear  normal.  When  the  wearer  turns  the  dial  to

the middle position (a move action), a beam of light emerges

from the lens, illuminating the surroundings as a bullseye

lantern. Four times per day, the wearer can turn the dial to

the  right  position  as  a  standard  action  and  aim  the  lens  at

a target, unleashing a beam of searing light that deals

3d8  points  of  damage  to  most  crea-

tures,  6d6  points  of  damage

to undead, and 6d8 points

of damage to creatures

with light sensi-

tivity. The dial

returns  to  the

middle position

after  each  searing

light.  Even  though

only  one  of  the  pair

contains  the  lens-and-

dial  apparatus,  both  brac-

ers must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate evocation, CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, searing

light; Price 26,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Gauntlet  of  the  Dwarven  Forge:  This  iron  gauntlet

extends to the elbow and is always cool to its wearers touch.

When its command word is spoken, a gauntlet of the dwarven

forge  glows  red-hot  for  10  rounds,  illuminating  everything

within 10 feet as if by torchlight. Anyone else touched by the

gauntlet during this time takes 1d6+10 points of  re damage.

The wearer of a gauntlet of the dwarven forge takes half damage

from   re-based  attacks  while  the  gauntlet  is  glowing.  Fire

attacks  that  allow  Re ex  saves  for  half  damage  deal  the

wearer no damage if he makes his save.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  10th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,   re

shield; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.

Gauntlet of Lassitude: This leather glove bound in brass

magically transforms to match the hand shape of its owner,

and thus it can be worn on either hand. With a successful

melee touch attack, the gauntlet of lassitude slows the target for

5 rounds (Will DC 14 negates).

Gauntlet of Utterdeath: This spiked gauntlet of jet-black

steel smells faintly of brimstone. If the wearer succeeds on a

melee touch attack, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude

save or be reduced to a pile of smoldering cinders. If the For-

titude save succeeds, the target instead takes 10d6 points of

damage. A gauntlet of utterdeath is usable three times per day.

Sacred  Scabbard:  This  item  has  a  variable  appearance.

When   rst  found,  there  is  a  25%  chance  it  looks  like  a

dagger sheath, a 25% chance it looks like an axe case, and a

50% chance it looks like some sort of sword sheath. A user

quickly discovers, however, that a sacred scabbard can change

shape to  t whatever dagger, sword, or axe is touched to it,

even making allowances for double weapons. This scabbard

keeps any weapon carried in it clean and sharp. In addition,

up to three times per day, the user may place a weapon in the

scabbard, utter a command word, and invoke bless weapon on

the weapon inside.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, bless

Standard  of  Courage:  For  a  standard  of  courage  to  be

effective, it must be af xed to a two-handed hafted weapon

such as a halberd or a lance. The bearer of the standard and

any allies within 30 feet of the item gain a +4 morale bonus

against fear effects.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, remove fear;

Price 15,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Standard of Heroism: This standard functions as a stan-

dard of courage, except that the standard bearer and any allies

within 30 feet of the item gain a +2 morale bonus on attack

rolls, saves, and skill checks.

Faint  enchantment  and  abjuration;  CL  5th;  Craft  Won-

drous  Item,  heroism,  remove  fear;  Price  40,000  gp;  Weight

Standard  of  No  Retreat:  This  standard  functions  as

a  standard  of  courage,  except  that  it  also  prevents  outward

extradimensional  travel  within  30  feet,  just  as  if  creatures

were subjected to a dimensional anchor spell. Creatures trying

to   ee  from  the  standards  area  must  succeed  on  a  DC  19

Will save, or their attempt to  ee fails. A standard of no retreat

doesnt prevent creatures from using extradimensional travel

to enter the area, just to leave it. Summoned creatures within

the standards area still disappear when the spell that brought

them here ends.

NEW SPECIAL MATERIALS

The following special materials supplement those found in

Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide. Except for double

weapons, a particular object can be made of only one special

material.

Pandemonic Silver: Mined from thin veins of ore on the

plane of Pandemonium, pandemonic silver has all the proper-

ties of alchemical silver (see page 284 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide).  In  addition,  a  thin,  unearthly  scream  issues  forth

from a bladed weapon made of pandemonic silver whenever

its  unsheathed  in  at  least  a  light  breeze.  This  scream  is  a

sonic, mind-affecting compulsion that is a fear effect. Other

than the wielder, those within 30 feet who hear the scream

must  succeed  on  a  Will  save  or  cower  for  1d4  rounds.  The

DC of the Will save depends on the strength of the wind, as

indicated on the table below.

Susalian Chainweave: Made by a technique known only

to  the  greatest  elven  armorsmiths,  susalian  chainweave  is

an  elaborate  system  of  chainmail  links  knitted  together  to

provide additional protection against some blows. When an

attack with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon hits a character

wearing susalian chainweave, the armor stiffens at the point

of contact and disperses the force of the attack. This quality

gives the wearer damage reduction 3/piercing as long as the

susalian chainweave armor is worn.

Thinaun: This dark, glittering steel alloy holds an attrac-

tion to souls recently released from their bodies. Obviously,

this has application for melee weapons. If a thinaun melee

weapon  is  touching  a  creature  when  it  dies,  that  creatures

soul is sucked into the weapon rather than passing on to its

 nal reward. The soul remains in the thinaun weapon until

the weapon is destroyed or another creature dies while touch-

ing the thinaun weapon (the new soul displaces the old one).

Raise dead, resurrection, and similar spells wont bring back a

9/12/03, 4:16:39 PM

creature whose soul is trapped by a thinaun weapon unless

the caster has the weapon in his possession. Because the soul

is nearby, fewer material components are required for such

spells: Reincarnation, raise dead, resurrection, and true resurrec-

tion require half as much of the relevant material component

(unguents or diamonds) to cast if the soul is within a thinaun

weapon.

A  thinaun  weapon  captures  a  soul  from  anyone  killed

while touching the weapon. This means that if the thinaun

weapons wielder dies, her weapon captures her soul.

Only  melee  weapons  made  primarily  of  metal  can  be

crafted as thinaun weapons.

WARRIORS

IN THE CAMPAIGN

This  section  covers  a  wide  range  of  topics  appropriate  to

any  campaign  that  features  (or  even  just  includes)  martial

characters,  including  tips  for  warrior-oriented  campaigns,

exotic and improvised weapons, organizations for warriors,

epic-level warriors, and a warriors interactions with the dei-

ties of the campaigns pantheon.

WARRIOR CAMPAIGNS

For an interesting twist on the traditional DUNGEONS & DRAG-

ONS  experience,  try  putting  away  the  spellbooks  and  holy

symbols  to  play  a  warrior-oriented  campaign.  In  this  type

of campaign, most characters in the party focus on combat-

related classes: barbarian,  ghter, paladin, and ranger, and to

a lesser extent, monk and rogue.

By de nition, a warrior-oriented campaign tends to be low

in magic. This simple term can have a variety of meanings,

depending on the DMs vision of the campaign world. Spell-

casting  may  be  dif cult,  rare,  or  simply  unknown;  magic

items  may  be  rare  or  expensive;  and  anything  other  than

slow, natural healing may be tough to come by.

SPELLCASTING

The simplest way to create a warrior-oriented campaign is to

prohibit  PCs  from  taking  levels  in  a  spellcasting  class,  but

allow for the occasional NPC spellcaster. The key here is to

avoid making the players feel inferior to your NPCs by limit-

ing their exposure to spellcasting characters. If the PCs meet

a spellcaster on every adventure, theyre likely to wonder why

they cant pursue the same options.

Alternatively, the DM may choose to eliminate spellcasters

from his world. In such a world, no characterPC or NPC

can take any levels in a spellcasting class (for this purpose,

de ned as bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard), and even

other  classes  that  would  normally  gain  spells  (paladin  and

ranger) do not gain any spell slots. At the DMs option, he may

choose to grant paladins and rangers alternative class features

to make up for this loss (see the Variant Classes section at the

end of Chapter 1).

When populating a community (see pages 137139 of the

Dungeon  Masters  Guide)  in  a  setting  without  spellcasters,

replace  any  bards  that  might  be  present  with  rogues,  any

druids with rangers (or with barbarians if in a particularly

savage  or  uncivilized  area),  any  sorcerers  with  monks,  and

any  wizards  with   ghters.  Replace  25%  of  the  clerics  with

paladins, and the other 75% with  ghters.

Assuming the DM doesnt simply ban spellcasting classes

to  player  characters,  he  may  instead  limit  the  PCs  access

to  such  classes.  One  method  of  doing  so  is  to  restrict  the

number of class levels that any character may take in a spell-

casting class. For instance, any character might be limited to

no more than half his total character levels in a spellcasting

class (bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard). No character

could begin play as a 1st-level bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or

wizard. In this campaign, paladins and rangers retain their

normal spellcasting abilities.

Another  method  of  limiting  access  to  potent  spells  is  to

treat the spellcasting classes much like prestige classes. Any

character  wishing  to  begin  gaining  levels  as  a  spellcaster

must  rst be at least a 3rd-level character with 3 ranks each

in Spellcraft and an appropriate Knowledge skill (arcana for

bards,  sorcerers,  or  wizards;  religion  for  clerics;  nature  for

druids).  This  requirement  ensures  that  such  characters  are

signi cantly behind the power curve of a traditional single-

classed spellcaster, but have other talents to fall back on in

times of need.

MAGIC ITEMS

Part  and  parcel  of  a  low-magic  world  is  the  scarcity  of

magic  items.  Even  if  spellcasters  are  present  in  the  world,

its  unlikely  that  they  traf c  in  magic  items  to  the  degree

assumed by the Dungeon Masters Guide. Talk to your DM to

determine what exactly low magic means in terms of magic

items, and plan accordingly.

For example, even in a low-magic setting, you may be able

to purchase minor items, such as potions or the occasional

scroll, from the local alchemist or hedge wizard. Particularly

if you dont have a cleric or other healer, a few curing potions

can give you a big edge.

Another  important  issue  is  magic  weapons  and  armor.

While  you  may  be  able  to  survive  with  only  masterwork

equipment  for  a  while,  you  may  eventually  run  into  oppo-

nents resistant to your weapons or the type of damage they

deal. Check with your DM to see if magic weapons even exist

in the campaignsuch items may be rare heirlooms, relics

of  a  bygone  era,  or  treasured  artifacts,  or  they  may  just  be

extraordinarily expensive to create (double, triple, or even 10

times the normal cost to create).

SURVIVING IN A WARRIOR

CAMPAIGN

The   ghters  most  precious  resource  is  his  supply  of  hit

points. In no uncertain terms, a  ghters hit points measure

his ability to continue doing what he does best:  ght. With-

out hit points, it doesnt matter how strong or fast you are,

because you have lost the  ght.

A  wise   ghter  manages  this  resource  carefully,  and  in  a

warrior campaign, this becomes even more important (since

there probably isnt a cleric around when you need one). In

general, managing your hit points comes down to two things:

saving them until needed, and restoring them when lost.

Saving Hit Points

In a typical party, a  ghter can often avoid dealing with the

enemys  minions  because  the  wizard  takes  them  out  with

spells  such  as  sleep  or   reball.  This  tactical  advantage  lets

the  ghter save his precious hit points until he really needs

them  (the  battle  with  the  big  bad  guy).  Without  the  artil-

lery  support  provided  by  spellcasters,  the   ghter  is  likely

to face signi cantly more (and longer) melee combats with

his  enemies,  resulting  in  a  greater  depletion  of  hit  points.

Here are some ways of avoiding or solving that problem in a

 ghter-heavy group.

Stay Alert: While no amount of preparation or feat selec-

tion can ensure that you are never caught  at-footed, every

time you avoid giving up a surprise round or a sneak attack

to a foe, you have gained an edge. Make sure somebody in the

groupsuch as the barbarian or rangerhas a high initia-

tive modi er (Improved Initiative is key) and a good Spot or

Listen modi er.

Keep  Your  Distance:  The  reason  that  1st-level  wizards

prefer  magic  missile  to  shocking  grasp  is  that  the  former  lets

them hit opponents from a long way away. Learn this lesson

well. Most characters in your group should carry a bow, or

failing that, a loaded crossbow, when trudging through the

dungeon. (If you have a big enough group, you can afford to

have at least one character who specializes in ranged combat.)

Assuming you arent ambushed, chances are you will be able

to  get  off  at  least  one  shot  at  your  opponent  before  melee

begins.  While  the  few  points  of  damage  dealt  by  that  shot

may  not  seem  impressive  when  compared  to  your  average

sword- or axe-swing, those may be the few points that keep

the monster from getting another full attack against you later

in the encounter. In fact, in most  ghts, the longer you stay

out of melee range, the better your chances of success. The

exception, of course, is if your opponent has better ranged

attacks than you.

Smaller Fights Are Better: Though a sorcerer may com-

plain about only having two bugbears to incinerate with his

 reball, the fewer opponents faced by a  ghter simultaneously,

the better. In most rounds, you can only damage a very limited

number of opponents (unlike a typical spellcaster), but many

opponents might be able to damage you. Never let an enemy

escape (hes probably going for reinforcements), and never let

an enemy shout a warning. If one of the goblins carries a horn,

take him out  rst. If theres a big drum in the middle of the

guard post, put an arrow through it right away.

Neutralize Spellcasters: A typical  ghters Achilles heel

is  his  tendency  to  fail  Will  and  Re ex  saves.  While  a  failed

Re ex  save  isnt  likely  to  cost  you  the  battleonly  more  of

those precious hit pointsa failed Will save can turn the tide

in a moment. If your enemies include a spellcaster, focus your

efforts  on  him  right  away.  Its  probably  worth  provoking  an

attack of opportunity to charge past the minions of the evil

cleric or necromancer just to get in a position to prevent him

from blasting you with his spells. Failing that, use your bow

or crossbow (see above) to chase him off. A particularly potent

tactic against a spellcaster is to ready an action to attack him

just as he casts a spell (including a 5-foot-step to follow him

if he tries to step back out of melee). While this may cost you

some attacks (since youre potentially giving up a full attack in

exchange for a single readied attack), a hit forces a pretty tough

Concentration check from the spellcaster to succeed in casting

the spell. Most spellcasters, facing this situation, prefer to run

away rather than stay and be pummeled.

Avoid  Unnecessary  Fights:  Just  because  a  half-dozen

orcs  are  standing  between  you  and  the  entrance  to  the

enemys fortress doesnt mean you have to  ght them now, or

ever. Despite the oft-repeated advice never to leave enemies

behind you, if you do your job right, an enemy avoided now

can easily become an enemy avoided forever. Do you really

think those orcs are going to stick around to  ght you after

you have defeated their master and set the castle ablaze? Just

because you can  ght the orcs doesnt mean you should. Even

though the result of the  ght seems a foregone conclusion, all

one of those orcs needs to do is score a key critical hit to make

the  ght much more costly than you had anticipated.

Restoring Hit Points

Despite  the   ghters  best  efforts,  he  must  inevitably  take

some damage. This brings up a big concern for any  ghter-

heavy group: Namely, whos providing the healing? Without

a cleric (or at least a druid), its tough for characters to replen-

ish the hit points they use up in combat. Consider any or all

the  following  options  for  your  warrior-oriented  campaign,

assuming theyre available.

Take  Care  of  Yourself:  Each  character  must  be  much

more self-reliant when it comes to healing. If possible, every

PC should carry around a supply of potions of various cure

spells. If you dont have enough potions to restore you from 0

hit points to full normal hit points (assuming average rolls),

youre taking a serious chance that you wont be around to

see the end of the adventure. Of course, some classes have

an edge in this regard. Both the monk and the paladin have

some limited supernatural healing capabilities, and the pala-

din  and  ranger  have  healing  spells  available  as  they  attain

higher levels.

Use  All  Available  Resources:  An  often-overlooked

option for rangers and paladins is to stock up on wands of

cure  spells.  Since  both  classes  have  cure  light  wounds,  cure

moderate wounds, and cure serious wounds on their spell lists,

they can use wands of these spells without dif culty, even

before they can actually cast the spells. While a wand of cure

light  wounds  isnt  likely  to  save  the  day  in  the  middle  of  a

pitched battle, once the  ghting stops its a cheap way to get

rid of a lot of damage. Assuming average rolls, a wand of cure

light wounds (market price 750 gp) heals about 275 points of

damage before its exhausted. Thats less than 3 gp per hit

point, which is the best deal available. Despite the value of

the cheaper wands, however, consider picking up a wand of

cure serious wounds as soon as you can afford it for quicker

 xes. (Of course, this option may not be available in a low-

magic setting.)

Multiclass:  Multiclass   ghter/clerics,  barbarian/druids,

and the like gain access to spellcasting, scrolls, and wands

just as rangers and paladins do. Even a single level of bard or

rogue allows you to invest heavily in the Use Magic Device

skill, which lets you use the scrolls, wands, or staffs that a

cleric might otherwise wield.

Rest:  When  all  else  fails,  take  time  off  from   ghting.

Every day of rest is another few hit points for the next battle.

Make sure you have at least one character with some ranks

in the Heal skilllong-term care dramatically re duces the

downtime between adventures forced by lost hit points.

WARRIOR ORGANIZATIONS

The six organizations presented here are appropriate for just

about any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. Each one is tied

to  a  speci c  prestige  class  presented  in  Chapter  2  of  this

book,  allowing  you  to  give

those classes a rich

background in

your world.

ISE ZUMI MONASTERY

The tradition of the tattooed monk comes from the Ise Zumi

Monastery, hidden high in the mountains. Here, the order of

tattooed monks trains newcomers in their mysteries while

seeking personal enlightenment.

Most  monks  who  live  at  the  Ise  Zumi  Monastery  are

ascetic in their outlook, preferring quiet solitude to the com-

plex  life  of  the  outside  world.  Though  many  more  worldly

monks have trained here and visit from time to time, such

individuals spend more time away from the monastery than

in residence.

To join the monastery, one must merely be of lawful align-

ment  and  display  a  devotion  to  achieving  enlightenment

while avoiding temptation. Typically, this display of devotion

involves a three-day ritual in which one must deny oneself

temptations appealing to the  ve senses. Those who would

learn the mysteries of the tattooed monk prestige class must

meet  more  stringent  requirements  (see  the  tattooed  monk

prestige class in Chapter 2).

In addition to the obvious bene ts of becoming a tattooed

monk,  the  Ise  Zumi  Monastery  is  a  repository  of  religious

lore from a wide variety of races and cultures. One can only

guess at the ancient secrets that lie deep in the monasterys

basements.

Mesehti Taharqa received his training at the Ise Zumi Mon-

astery but soon found that he could not stomach the ascetic

lifestyle  of  his  mentors.  Instead,  he

struck  out  to  explore  the  world,

reasoning that the more he knew

of  its  temptations,  the  better

prepared  he  would  be  to

resist them.

He

Mesehti  is  quick  to  advise  such  characters  that  the  ascetic

life practiced in the monastery is ill-equipped to handle the

temptations  of  the  outside  world,  and  urges  any  tattooed

monk  PC  to  widen  her  horizons.  He  enjoys  the  company

of other dedicated souls, but feels threatened when he isnt

the center of attention. An incautious PC could easily  nd

Mesehtis attitude shifting from that of friendly advisor to

jealous rival.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Mesehti may use a full attack action

to make one extra attack per round with an unarmed strike

or a spe cial monk weapon at his highest base attack bonus,

but this attack and each other attack made in that round take

a  1  penalty  apiece.  This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it

affects attacks of opportunity Mesehti might make before his

next action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham,

Mesehti can make the extra attack either with that weapon

or unarmed. If armed with two such weapons, he uses one

for his regular attack(s) and the other for the extra attack. In

any case, his damage bonus on the attack with his off hand is

not reduced.

Ki Strike (Su): Mesehtis unarmed strike can deal damage

to a creature with damage reduction as if the blow were made

with a magic weapon.

Lion Tattoo (Su): This tattoo gives Mesehti the ability to

smite a foe, gaining a +4 bonus on a single melee attack and a

+5 bonus on the damage roll if the attack hits. He can make

a smite attempt up to three times per day.

Crab  Tattoo  (Su):  This  tattoo  provides  Mesehti  with

damage reduction 6/magic.

Evasion (Ex): If Mesehti is exposed to any effect that nor-

mally allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half

damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Purity  of  Body  (Ex):  Mesehti  has  immunity  to  all  dis-

eases  except  for  magical  diseases  such  as  mummy  rot  and

lycanthropy.

Slow  Fall  (Ex):  When  within  arms  reach  of  a  wall,

Mesehti can use it to slow his descent while falling. He takes

damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still Mind (Ex): +2 bonus on saving throws against spells

and effects from the enchantment school.

White  Mask  Tattoo  (Su):  Mesehti  is  immune  to  detect

thoughts, detect lies, and any attempt to magically discern his

alignment. He gains a +10 bonus on all Bluff checks (included

in the above statistics).

Possessions: Periapt of Wisdom +4, bracers of armor +2, potion of

THE KNIGHT PROTECTORS

Less an organization than a variety of individuals who share

a code of conduct, the knight protectors are dedicated to the

preservation (and restoration) of the ideals of honor, chivalry,

and courage. The protectors think of themselves as the last

remnants of a formerly great order of knights, but actually

may  come  from  a  variety  of  backgrounds.  Usually,  they

come from defunct orders of chivalry or the service of fallen

lords who aspired to good works but fell short in some way.

Those who take up the mantle of knight protector hope for

the return of better days, and they believe they can hasten

that process and repair societys ills by living their lives as

para gons of their venerable chivalric code.

The knight protectors have no of cial hierarchy or admis-

sion  procedure.  Unlike  most  knightly  orders,  declaring

oneself a knight protector requires no time of service, proof

of  worthiness,  or  oath  of  allegiance,  except  to  the  code  of

conduct  shared  by  others  in  the  order.  The  knights  police

their  own,  however,  and  a  knight  protector  who  does  not

deserve  that  title  eventually   nds  himself  in  con ict  with

more devout members, who look upon such hypocrisy as a

high crime against their ideals. A knight who unwillingly or

unknowingly violates the code, or violates it willingly in the

belief that doing so contributes to an act of greater good, may

redeem himself by undertaking and completing a quest or

other dangerous mission assigned by more senior knights. A

protector who willingly and knowingly violates this code for

no adequate reason is no longer considered one of the order,

and  is  shunned  (if  not  despised  or  even  hunted)  by  other

knight protectors.

Sample Member

Joris  Welker  was  once  a  proud  member  of  a  great  order  of

paladins. Over time, he came to believe that his fellows were

too  slow  to  battle  corruption  or  moral  weakness  in  others,

preferring charity to order. Joris struggled with this dilemma

for  many  months.  When  called  upon  to  serve  a  local  duke

he knew to be morally bankrupt, Joris refused to obey, but

lied to his superiors about the reason. Though they did not

know the truth, his superiors recognized the lie (as well as

the  disrespect  for  authority)  and  banished  Joris  from  their

order. In search of a new code to follow, Joris encountered

a knight protector who taught him the beliefs of the group.

Now, Joris roams the land in search of corruption and moral

decay to  ght against. He allies with PCs with similar goals,

and proudly tells anyone interested about his new fellows and

their mission in life.

ORDER OF THE BOW

The Order of the Bow teaches that ones true character can

be determined through ones archery. Practicing a form of

archery simply called the Way of the Bow, the members of

the order search for truth, patience, and beauty through com-

mitment, diligent practice, and spiritual sincerity. Its origins

are unclear, and some scholars claim it originated among the

elves, but regardless, it has spread to many sentient races.

The Way of the Bow is a spiritual art. By learning it, the

archer learns about himself. By improving in the Way of the

Bow, the archer improves himself.

Even  with  these  shared  goals,  each  follower  of  the  Way

of  the  Bow  sees  archery  in  different  manners.  Some  see

archery as spiritual self-improvement, while others believe

it to be a philosophical art. They may employ it as a religious

ceremony,  practice  it  as  a  way  of  life,  or  simply  see  the  art

of killing by the bow as an important talent in a dangerous

world. As they are wont to say, the Way of the Bow is always

a little more than what you make of it.

Pure  skill  is  not  enough  to  join  this  organization;  only

those truly dedicated to the Way of the Bow can become an

initiate of the order (see the Order of the Bow Initiate pres-

tige class in Chapter 2).

Sample Member

Chanticleer Winterwood had wanted to become an Order of

the Bow Initiate since before he even knew of such a group.

As long as hes been walking, Chanticleer has had a bow in

his  hands,  and  its  as  much  a  part  of  him  as  his   ngers  or

toes. During his adventures in a great human metropolis, he

learned of the order and its teachings, and wasted no time

in proving his worth. Today, aided by his loyal companion

Quilaembril Straylight (male elf cleric 7), Chanticleer wan-

ders the land in search of ways to test his talents against the

forces of evil and tyranny. He can be an enigmatic ally to the

PCs, a mentor to a young archer, or a deadly foe to those who

wrong him.

ing an attack of opportunity.

Ranged  Precision  (Ex):  As  a  standard  action,  Chanti-

cleer may make a single precisely aimed attack with a ranged

weapon, dealing an extra 2d8 points of damage if the attack

hits.  When  making  a  ranged  precision  attack,  Chanticleer

must be within 30 feet of his target. A ranged precision attack

only works against living creatures with discernible anato-

mies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits (including

undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures)

is not vulnerable to a ranged precision attack.

Possessions:  Mithral  chain  shirt,  +1  shock  composite  longbow

ORDER OF THE CHALICE

The Order of the Chalice is a holy order of virtuous knights

sworn  to  a  noble  quest:  the  extermination  of  demonkind.

Held  to  the  highest  standards  of  law,  good,  and  nobility,

the knights of this order are everything one might associate

with the word paladinparagons of virtue, pure of heart,

perfect in valor, cultured and re ned, pious and devoted, and

too often, arrogant and vain.

The Order of the Chalice takes its name from a holy relic

guarded  by  the  orders  highest  leadersan  ornate  silver

cup said to have caught the blood of a solar while it fought

a  demon  prince.  The  chalice  is  rich  in  holy  powers,  or  so

the tales say, but more important, it is a constant source of

inspiration to the knights of the order as they pursue their

dif cult mission.

The order is a devoutly lawful good organization, and its

members  offer  prayers  to  Heironeous  (or  a  similar  lawful

good deity of honor and valor if you dont use Heironeous in

your campaign) at every gathering. However, characters who

hold other lawful good deities as patrons are welcome in the

order, as long as they do not balk at offering prayers to the

orders patron deity as well.

True to its alignment, the Order of the Chalice is rigidly

hierarchical in organization. At its head are the nine Masters

of the Chalice, whose greatest responsibility is safeguarding

the holy chalice itself. Each Master of the Chalice (typically

a  character  of  at  least  10th  level)  has  command  over  nine

Chalice Marshals (usually 7th- to 10th-level characters, each

marshal has authority over nine Chalice Commanders (typi-

cally 5th- to 8th-level characters), and each commander leads

nine Chalice Sergeants (who generally range from 3rd to 6th

level).

Most knights of the order prepare from youth for this high

calling, serving as squires to older, more experienced knights

while  they  learn  about  the  responsibilities  of  knighthood.

After a minimum of  ve years of unquestioning service, the

squire is evaluated by a council of nine senior knights, largely

based on testimony given by the squires knightly master. If

this evaluation is favorable, the squire is elevated to the status

of quester and is now a 1st-level character (usually a paladin,

but occasionally a ranger, cleric, or other class). Player charac-

ters who begin their adventuring careers as members of the

Order of the Chalice are typically of this rank.

It is possible to join the order as a quester without under-

going this time of preparation, but such a character must

meet minimum quali cations similar to (but less stringent

than)  those  required  by  the  knight  of  the  Chalice  pres-

tige  class,  including  a  lawful  good  alignment,  4  ranks  of

Knowledge (religion), 2 ranks of Knowledge (the planes),

and either the ability to cast divine spells (including protec-

tion from evil), the ability to smite evil, or a favored enemy

of evil outsiders.

Most questers aim to qualify as a knight in full standing,

which requires the character to meet the full requirements

necessary to gain levels in the knight of the chalice prestige

class. Once these quali cations are met, the quester returns

to the knightly council and presents evidence of her accom-

plishments.  Assuming  the  council  approves  the  questers

admission  into  the  order,  the  quester  spends  a  night  in

prayer and fasting, then takes the solemn vows of the order

at  daybreak,  becoming  a  knight  in  full  standing.  At  any

point  thereafter,  the  character  may  begin  taking  levels  in

the knight of the chalice prestige class.

In addition to the general principles of paladinhood and

lawful  good  alignment  described  in  the  Players  Handbook,

the  Order  of  the  Chalice  demands  that  its  members  swear

to a stricter code of conduct. Knights of the Chalice must be

chaste and celibate, must never de le their bodies by touch-

ing a corpse, and must always place the extermination of a

demon  above  all  other  priorities.  Failure  to  adhere  to  this

code of conduct can result in censure or even expulsion from

the order.

PURPLE DRAGONS

The Purple Dragons is an army of disciplined, loyal soldiers

dedicated  to  the  service  of  a  noble  king.  They  are  widely

respected for their skill and heroism in battle, and enjoy a

proud tradition dating back many generations.

Membership  in  the  Purple  Dragons  is  open  to  anyone

willing  to  pledge  service  to  the  king.  After  a  minimal

amount of training to ensure the applicants dedication and

aptitude,  the  new  member  receives  his  initial  assignment

based on his skill set. Some are assigned to active duty in the

standing army, while others might be designated as a skir-

misher, a scout, or even part of an independent detachment

of elite soldiers taking part in speci c missions against the

forces of evil.

Most terms of service in the Purple Dragons last a mini-

mum  of   ve  years,  though  many  enjoy  lifetime  careers  in

the  organization.  Particularly  gifted  individuals  may  even

become Purple Dragon knights, who are often responsible

for leading forces of soldiers. (See the prestige class in Chap-

ter 2 for more information.)

Sample Member

Thorvald is a scout and skirmisher with the Purple Dragons.

He aims to become a Purple Dragon knight, and speaks of

his dream with anyone who listens. He knows that he has

the  talents  to  join  the  ranks  of  the  knights,  but  has  yet  to

prove himself to his superiors. If he encountered a PC Purple

Dragon  knight,  he  would  seek  desperately  to  impress  that

individual, perhaps even throwing himself into a situation

above his head.

THE RAVAGERS

Some of the most thoroughly evil and foul acts the world has

ever known can be laid squarely at the feet of the Ravagers,

a tight-knit group of deadly marauders. Fortunately for the

more civilized areas of the world, the total number of indi-

vidual Ravagers remains small. However, these unrepentant

slayers make up in sheer ferocity what they lack in numbers.

Gathering in warbands having as few as three members to as

many as two dozen, they strike without warning, descend-

ing on unsuspecting towns, villages, and hamlets, and some-

times  even  upon  isolated  farmsteads  or  traveling  caravans.

Their violent depredations are made all the more horrible by

the fact that their principal motives seem to be maiming and

killing, rather than theft or kidnapping or some other more

understandable (if equally detestable) reason.

The Ravagers lead a seminomadic existence, establishing

more  or  less  permanent  encampments  hidden  away  in  the

wilderness  and  other  remote  areas,  from  which  they  plan

their savage raids. They occasionally enter towns and cities

in which they know a secret temple dedicated to Erythnul

(or a similar deity of slaughter) can be found, often receiving

supplies and equipment from the local clergy, and sometimes

even special assignments. Those unfortunate enough to come

across a Ravager encampment usually meet the same fate as

the Ravagers intended victims.

The  Ravagers  need  not  recruit  new  members,  for  they

know that the infamy of their deeds inevitably attracts those

who  have  lost  any  reverence  for  life.  Hatred,  malice,  and

bitterness toward all other folk are the core of the Ravagers

beliefs and behaviors. Among their number are found some

of the most irredeemable and vile persons ever to walk under

the sun. Soldiers who betrayed their country and oaths for

pro t,  kidnappers  who  murdered  their  victims  though  the

ransom was paid in full, mass murderers whose crimes are

times to her fellows. She revels in the destruction spread

by  the  Ravagers,  and  would  make  an  excellent  recurring

enemy for good-aligned PCs.

Zyera:  Female  half-orc  ex-monk  4/ ghter  2/ravager  4;

CR  10,  Medium  humanoid;  HD  4d8+8  plus  2d10+4  plus

Endurance, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Stunning Fist.

Cruelest Cut (Ex): If Zyera declares ahe is using cruelest

cut before making an attack, and the attack strikes success-

fully, she deals an extra 1d4 points of temporary Constitution

damage.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Zyera may use a full attack action

to make one extra attack per round with an unarmed strike

or a spe cial monk weapon at her highest base attack bonus,

but this attack and each other attack made in that round take

a  1  penalty  apiece.  This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it

affects attacks of opportunity Zyera might make before her

next action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham,

Zyera can make the extra attack either with that weapon or

unarmed. If armed with two such weapons, she uses one for

her regular attack(s) and the other for the extra attack. In any

case, her damage bonus on the attack with his off hand is not

reduced.

Ki Strike (Su): Zyeras unarmed strike can deal damage to

a creature with damage reduction as if the blow were made

with a magic weapon.

Pain Touch (Su): Zyeras melee touch attack deals 1d8+4

points  of  damage.  She  can  also  use  pain  touch  through  a

melee weapon, dealing 1d4+4 points of damage.

Aura of Fear (Su): Enemies within 10 feet of Zyera take

a 2 morale penalty on all saving throws for as long as they

remain within range.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Zyera  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally  allows  her  to  attempt  a  Re ex  saving  throw  for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Slow Fall (Ex): When within arms reach of a wall, Kyera

can use it to slow her descent while falling. She takes damage

as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still Mind (Ex): +2 bonus on saving throws against spells

and effects from the enchantment school.

Possessions: Bracers of armor +3, 12 +1 shuriken, gauntlets of ogre

power, boots of elvenkind, 21 sp.

DEITIES AND WARRIORS

Unlike  the  typical  divinely  oriented  character,  a  combat-

minded  characters  link  to  his  deity  is  less  based  on  what

powers my deity grants me and more based on to whom I

pay respect and homage for my victories. A  ghter doesnt

worship a deity to gain spells or other special abilities, he wor-

ships  a  deity  because  he  believes  that  such  worship  brings

him good luck in battle or protects him from ill favor.

For this reason, such a characters choice of deity (or dei-

ties) to venerate is simultaneously less important and more

important than the same choice made by a cleric. On one

hand, since the choice isnt likely to affect the characters

capabilities in a  ght, some players might simply blow off

the decision. My  ghter worships whichever deity provides

my healing is a common statement by such a player.

But  that  mentality  ignores  the  great  roleplaying  oppor-

tunities provided by your choice of patron deity. Sure, its

easy for a warrior to say that he doesnt care about deities,

but how believable is that in a world where the powers of

the deities are in plain view for all to see? Its much more

likely that any character would see one or more deities as his

patron(s), paying respect, worshiping, or even sacri cing in

their names.

USING THE DEITIES FROM THE

PLAYERS HANDBOOK

The  following  material  provides  some  insight  into  why  a

 ghter might select a deity from the Players Handbook as his

patron, and what type of  ghters each deity tends to attract.

For the uncommon and rare patron deities, each entry also

includes brief notes on how to tweak that deity to make it

more appealing to warriors (or more appropriate in a warrior-

oriented campaign).

Each  deitys  alignment  is  given  in  parentheses  after  its

name,  but  remember  that  nonclerics  can  revere  any  deity,

regardless of the characters alignment.

Common Fighter Patron Deities

Erythnul (CE) is a popular choice of evil  ghters and barbar-

ians, particularly among the more savage races. As a deity of

slaughter, Erythnul rarely draws worshipers from those  ght-

ers who follow strict martial codes or belong to regimented

armies. A  ghter who reveres Erythnul lives only to deal out

death  and  mayhem,  and  grows  impatient  when  prevented

from doing so for extended periods. Erythnuls worshipers

typically have high Constitution scores, the better to increase

their staying power in a  ght.

Heironeous  (LG)  is  the  best  patron  deity  for  any   ghter

who holds chivalry and valor as high ideals. Paladins obvi-

ously fall into this category, but any good or lawful  ghter

or monk could easily  nd much to respect in the teachings

of  Heironeous.  Such  characters  would  tend  to   ght  at  the

forefront  of  the  battle,  leading  the  charge  against  tyranny

and injustice. They are often proud and outspoken, and may

have  a  high  Charisma  score.  Consider  adding  the  Courage

and Nobility domains (see Chapter 3) to the list of domains

that Heironeous grants access to.

Hextor  (LE)  is  the  evil  mirror  to  Heironeous,  promot-

ing  con ict  and  destruction.  Many  blackguards  worship

Hex tor,  as  do  evil   ghters  and  monks.  These  characters

prefer  to  lead  the   ght  against  freedom  and  good,  prefer-

ring  action  to  subtlety.  They  often  have  high  Charisma

scores. Consider adding the Tyranny domain (see Chapter

3) to the list of domains that Hextor grants access to.

The worship of Kord (CG) attracts those who appreciate

physical prowess and athleticism, including both barbarians

and  ghters. Even warriors who profess not to worship any

deity may subconsciously ask Kord to grant his favor in a con-

test of muscle or stamina. Such characters chafe in settings

where strength cant win the day, often growing impatient

with diplomatic functions or other interactions. In addition

to high Strength scores, worshipers of Kord often have good

Constitution scores.

St. Cuthbert (LN) draws many worshipers who believe in

the authority of law and order, and who share his dedication

to  punishing  transgressors.  Paladins,  monks,  and  law ful

 ghters and rangers all make  ne followers of St. Cuthbert.

His worshipers tend to be single-minded in their approach

to life, and may have a very black-and-white view of things.

Such characters often have high Wisdom scores.

Uncommon Fighter Patron Deities

Ehlonna  (CG)  is  often  worshiped  by  rangers  and  archers,

as well as by elves, gnomes, half-elves, and hal ings. Some

barbarians, particularly those who feel close to the natural

world of the forest, also choose the deity of the woodlands as

a patron deity. Worshipers of Ehlonna are usually good and

tend to be very protective of the woodlands, and may have

high Wisdom scores. Consider adding archery to Ehlonnas

portfolio to make her more appropriate for a warrior-oriented

campaign.

Fharlanghn (N) isnt usually associated with warriors, but

any wandering sellsword must pay at least some homage to

the deity of roads. A  ghter who worships Fharlanghn prob-

ably doesnt like to stay in one place for very long, preferring

the  open  road  even  to  a  comfortable  home.  A   ghter  who

worships Fharlanghn may have a high Dexterity score. Con-

sider adding mercenaries to Fharlanghns portfolio to make

him more appropriate for a warrior-oriented campaign.

Like his rival Ehlonna, Obad-Hai (N) attracts the worship

of rangers, barbarians, and other nature-minded characters.

Those  who  revere  Obad-Hai  live  in  harmony  with  nature

and often have high Wisdom scores, making them more like

their  rivals  than  they  might  care  to  admit.  Some  of  Obad-

Hais more dedicated followers take it upon themselves not

only  to  protect  nature,  but  also  to  seek  retribution  against

those  who  abuse  it.  Consider  adding  retribution  to  Obad-

Hais portfolio and the Fate domain (see Chapter 3) to the list

of domains he grants access to to make him more appropriate

for a warrior-oriented campaign.

Olidammara (CN) is an excellent patron deity for swash-

bucklers  and  other  martial  characters  who  survive  on  wit

and skill as much as physical prowess. Such characters often

have good Charisma or Dexterity scores, and may have levels

of bard or rogue to take better advantage of their strength of

personality. Consider adding dueling to Olidammaras port-

folio  to  make  him  more  appropriate  for  a  warrior-oriented

campaign.

Pelor (NG), as a stalwart adversary of evil, is venerated by

good-aligned martial characters of all classes, from barbar-

ians to paladins. Whats more, since all  ghters need frequent

healing, its a rare  ghter who doesnt know at least one prayer

of thanks to offer the Shining One. Fighters who revere Pelor

tend to be helpful and friendly, particularly to those in need.

They typically have good Wisdom or Charisma scores. Pelors

portfolio includes strength, and is thus perfectly appropriate

for a warrior-oriented campaign. Consider adding the Nobil-

ity domain (see Chapter 3) to the list of domains that Pelor

grants access to.

Rare Fighter Patron Deities

Boccob (N) might well be the most unusual patron deity for

a  ghter, barbarian, or other martial character. As the deity

of  magic  and  knowledge,  Boccob  would  seem  singularly

inappropriate as the deity of a character devoted to combat.

However, a particularly intelligent  ghter might pay re spect

to Boccob the Uncaring, as could a neutral mercenary war-

master. Of course, multiclass  ghters with arcane spellcast-

ing  ability  would  also  have  reason  to  venerate  Boccob.  A

 ghter who worships Boccob may care little about why (or

for whom) he swings his sword, as long as the job keeps him

comfortably supported. Such characters typically have a high

Intelligence score. Consider adding strategy to Boccobs port-

folio and the Planning domain (see Chapter 3) to the list of

domains Boccob grants access to to make him more appropri-

ate for  ghter-oriented campaigns.

Nerull  (NE)  is  typically  associated  with  necromancers

and assassins, but also counts blackguards and other purely

evil martial characters among his  ock. Above all else,  ght-

ers who worship Nerull work to deliver merciless death to

all  who  live.  Such  characters  often  gain  levels  of  rogue  to

enhance  their  murderous  abilities.  Fighters  who  choose

Nerull  as  a  patron  deity  seek  only  to  conquer  and  destroy

their  opponents,  and  often  have  above-average  Wisdom

scores. To increase Nerulls appropriateness for warrior-ori-

ented campaigns, consider adding conquest to his portfolio

and the Fate domain (see Chapter 3) to the list of domains he

grants access to.

Vecna (NE), like Boccob, has far more worshipers among

magic-wielding  characters  than  among  martial  characters.

However,  ghters with secrets to protect may  nd themselves

offering a more than occasional prayer to the Whispered One,

and some go so far as to give this deity their full allegiance.

Fighters  who  worship  Vecna  often  have  good  Intelligence

scores and tend to be quiet, private individuals, rarely trust-

ing anyone with their plots and schemes. Consider adding

domination to Vecnas portfolio and the Planning or Tyranny

domains (or both; see Chapter 3) to the list of domains he

grants access to to make him more appropriate for warrior-

oriented campaigns.

Wee Jas (LN), another deity who oversees magic, doesnt

attract many  ghters to her worship. Those few who select

her as a patron are often strict taskmasters, typically belong-

ing  to  a  disciplined,  hierarchical  organization  (such  as  a

military force). They are obedient to superiors and demand

similar  attitudes  of  those  beneath  them.  They  often  have

high  Charisma  scores.  Consider  adding  discipline  to  the

portfolio of Wee Jas and the Planning or Tyranny domains

(see Chapter 3) to the list of domains she grants access to to

make her more appropriate for a  ghter-oriented campaign.

Race-Specific Deities

Corellon  Larethian  (CG)  is  the  patron  deity  of  most  elf

 ghters and rangers, but typically is revered by only a small

number of nonelves. However, in a more racially integrated

campaign, Corellon could easily become a common choice

of rangers and  ghters of many races, particularly those who

favor the sword or the bow. Fighters who worship Corellon

tend to be self-reliant, and often have high Dexterity scores.

Consider adding swordplay and archery to Corellons port-

folio  to  make  him  more  appropriate  for  racially  integrated

warrior-oriented campaigns.

Among  gnomes,  there  are  few  who  follow  the  path  of

combat to exclusion, and thus Garl Glittergold (NG) doesnt

count  many   ghters  among  his  worshipers.  Much  more

common are  ghters or rangers who also have levels of rogue

or bard, and who tend to appreciate Garls love of wit. In a

racially integrated campaign, nongnomes who share similar

likes  might  well   nd  Garl  an  appropriate  patron.  Fighters

who  worship  Garl  Glittergold  appreciate  a  good  joke  and

may also be accomplished craftsmen, but they never forget

the  lessons  of  vigilance  taught  by  their  patron  deity.  They

frequently  have  high  Intelligence  scores.  Consider  adding

vigilance to Garls portfolio to make him more appropriate

for a racially integrated warrior-oriented campaign.

Gruumsh (CE) draws most of his worshipers from among

orcs and half-orcs, but any  ghter who believes that might

makes  right  can   nd  much  to  appreciate  in  the  one-eyed

deitys  teachings.  Fighters  who  worship  Gruumsh  have  no

mercy for the weak, believing that only those able to defend

their lands and possessions have any right to them. They may

have  high  Charisma  scores,  the  better  to  intimidate  their

enemies  and  lead  followers.  Gruumshs  portfolio  includes

war, and is thus perfectly suited to a martial campaign.

EPIC-LEVEL PRESTIGE-CLASS

CHARACTERS

The  Dungeon  Masters  Guide  has  information  on  advancing

characters  of  the  basic  classes  beyond  20th  level  (see  Epic

Characters,  beginning  on  page  206).  You  can  also  advance

beyond 10th level in a prestige class that already offers ten

levels,  but  only  if  your  character  level  is  already  20th  or

higher.  You  cannot  advance  in  a  prestige  class  with  fewer

than ten levels beyond the maximum level indicated for that

class, regardless of your character level.

When an epic-level character advances beyond

10th level in a prestige class, he follows all the

rules  presented  in  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide. (Many of those rules are repeated or

summarized later in this section, for con-

venience.) In addition, you must create an

epic-level progression for the prestige class,

just  as  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide  presents

epic-level  progressions  for  the  classes

from the Players Handbook. Many, but not

all,  class  features  continue  to  accumulate  after

10th  level.  The  following  guidelines  describe  how  to

create an epic prestige class progression, and are followed by

a sample epic progression for the frenzied berserker prestige

class (presented in Chapter 2 of this book).

Class-related base save bonuses and base attack bonus

dont increase after 20th level. Instead, use Table 618: Epic

Save and Epic Attack Bonuses, page 206 of the Dungeon Mas-

ters Guide, to determine the characters epic bonus on saving

throws and attack rolls.

You continue to gain Hit Dice and skill points as normal

beyond 10th level.

Generally  speaking,  any  class  feature  that  uses  your

class  level  as  part  of  a  mathematical  formula,  such  as  a

loremasters lore check, continues to increase as normal by

class level. However, any prestige class feature that calculates

a save DC using the class level (such as the assassins death

attack) should add only half the characters class levels above

10th. Thus, a 24th-level assassins death attack would have a

save DC of 27 + Int modi er (10 + class level up to 10th + 1/2

class  levels  above  10th).  Without  this  adjustment,  the  save

DC for epic-level character prestige class abilities increase at

a much faster rate than those of normal class abilities.

For spellcasters, your caster level continues to increase

after  10th  level  at  the  same  rate  it  did  during  the   rst  ten

levels of your prestige class. Thus, a 13th-level loremaster adds

13 to his caster level derived from another class to determine

total caster level. However, your spells per day dont increase

after character level 20th.

The  powers  of  familiars,  special  mounts,  and   endish

servants continue to increase as their masters gain levels, if

theyre  based  on  a  formula  that  includes  the  characters

level.

Any  class  features  that  increase  or  accumulate  as  part

of a repeated pattern also continue to increase or

accumulate  after  10th  level  at  the

same  rate.  An  exception  to

this rule is any bonus feat

progression  granted  as  a

class feature. If you get bonus feats

as part of a class feature, these do not increase with epic

levels. Instead, these classes get a new bonus feat progression

(which varies from class to class; see below).

In addition to the class features retained from nonepic

levels, each class gains a bonus feat every two, three, four, or

 ve  levels  beyond  10th.  This  bene t  augments  each  classs

progression  of  class  features,  because  not  all  classes  other-

wise improve class features after 10th level. These bonus feats

are in addition to the feat that every character gets every three

levels.

You  dont  gain  any  new  class  features,  because  there

arent any new class features described for these levels. Class

features  with  a  progression  that  slows  or  stops  before  10th

level and features that have a limited list of options do not

improve as you gain epic levels. Likewise, class features that

are gained only at a single level do not improve.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

EPIC LEVELS AND PRESTIGE CLASSES

The epic rules allow you to go beyond the normal level limit in a

prestige class, but only if it is a ten-level class. Why cant you add

levels to a prestige class with fewer than ten levels?

Its Too Easy: Maxing out a ten-level prestige class takes a lot

of time and effort, detracting signi cantly from your pursuit of

other classes. But after maxing out a prestige class with only  ve

levels, for instance, you havent necessarily taken more than a

short detour from your main class or classes.

levels in a prestige class, those levels represent a smaller fraction

of your characters identity.

Its Hard to Build an Epic Progression: With only a few levels

to guide you, its hard to determine what an appropriate progres-

sion of class features would be for the class. The rate of improve-

ment of a special ability might be too fast to extrapolate over an

in nite number of levels, or there might simply be too few class

features to build a unique epic progression.

That said, if your DM wants to allow a character to gain epic

levels in a prestige class with fewer than ten levels in its pro-

gression, thats okay. Work together with your DM to create an

epic progression for the class (see Behind the Curtain: Build-

ing an Epic Progression on page 210 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide).

Its Not Signi cant Enough: Characters with ten levels in the

blackguard  prestige  class  undoubtedly  think  of  themselves  as

blackguards, regardless of the fact that they also have ten levels

in one or more other classes. If you have taken fewer than ten

Sample Epic Prestige Class Progression:

The Epic Frenzied Berserker

Few mortal beings can surpass the destructive capabilities of

the epic frenzied berserker.

Hit Die: d12.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Additional  Level:  2  +  Int  modi-

 er.

Frenzy: An epic frenzied berserker may enter a frenzy one

additional time per day for every two levels gained after 9th

(6/day at 11th, 7/day at 13th, and so forth).

Inspire Frenzy: An epic frenzied berserker may use this

ability one additional time per day for every two levels gained

after 10th (4/day at 12th, 5/day at 14th, and so on).

Bonus  Feats:  An  epic  frenzied  berserker  gains  a  bonus

feat every three levels beyond 10th (13th, 16th, 19th, and so

on).

EPIC FEATS

The  feats  below  are  only  available  to  epic-level  characters;

that is, characters of at least 21st level. The version of a feat

described here supersedes any previously published version

of that feat.

Armor Skin [Epic]

Your skin becomes like armor.

Bene  t:  You  gain  a  +1  natural  armor  bonus  to  Armor

Class, or your existing natural armor bonus increases by +1.

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its

effects stack.

Combat Archery [Epic]

You can  re a bow in melee safely.

Prerequisites: Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot.

Bene  t: You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when

Your keen intellect allows you to place melee attacks where

they will deal the most damage.

Prerequisites:  Combat  Expertise,  Epic  Prowess,  base

attack bonus +15.

Bene  t: When wielding a melee weapon, add your Intel-

ligence modi er rather than your Strength modi er to the

weapons damage rolls.

Damage Reduction [Epic]

You can shrug off some damage from attacks.

Prerequisites: Con 21.

Bene  t:  You  gain  damage  reduction  3/.  This  bene t

doesnt stack with damage reduction granted by magic items

or  nonpermanent  magical  effects,  but  it  does  stack  with

damage  reduction  granted  by  permanent  magical  effects,

class features, or this feat itself.

Special:  A  character  can  gain  this  feat  multiple  times.

Each time you gain the feat, your damage reduction in creases

dodge bonus to your Armor Class and to the Armor Class of

an adjacent friendly creature. The changes to attack rolls and

Armor Class last until your next action.

The effect of this feat supersedes the effect of the Combat

Expertise feat; you cant use both feats simultaneously to gain

two dodge bonuses.

Epic Prowess [Epic]

You have great skill in combat.

Bene  t: Gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls.

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its

Epic Toughness [Epic]

You are preternaturally tough.

Bene  t: You gain +30 hit points.

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its

Epic Weapon Focus [Epic]

You are especially good at using one chosen type of weapon.

Prerequisite: Greater Weapon Focus and Weapon Focus

with the weapon chosen.

Bene  t: Add a +2 bonus on all attack rolls you make using

the selected weapon. This bonus stacks with other bonuses

on attack rolls, including the bonuses from Weapon Focus

and Greater Weapon Focus.

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its

effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to

and a base attack bonus of +18/+13/+8/+3 could make four

attacks per round with his primary weapon and four attacks

per round with his off-hand weapon, using the sazme set of

base attack bonuses. You still take the normal penalties for

 ghting with two  weapons.

Normal:  Without  this  feat,  you  can  only  make  a  single

attack with an off-hand weapon during a full attack (or two

attacks with an off-hand weapon if you have Improved Two-

Weapon Fighting, or three attacks with an off-hand weapon

if you have Greater Two-Weapon Fighting).

Wield Oversized Weapon [Epic]

You can use larger than normal weapons with ease.

Prerequisites:  Str  25,  Monkey  Grip*,  base  attack

bonus +21.

Bene  t: You can treat any weapon as if it were one size

category smaller than normal and one category lighter for

the purpose of determining the amount of effort it takes to

wield. For instance, a hal ing with this feat could wield a

Medium short sword as a Small light weapon, or a human

could  wield  an  ogres  Large  greatclub  as  a  Medium  two-

handed weapon. The weapon still deals its normal amount

of damage.

Normal: You may only wield weapons of your size with-

out penalty.

New feat described in Chapter 3 of this book.

A WARRIOR

AND HIS WEAPONS

In most cases, a warrior is de ned by his choice of weapons.

A barbarian wielding a greataxe presents a very different test

of skill than a  ghter with twin short swords, a ranger with a

composite longbow, or a paladin with a longsword and shield.

Even a monk, who often doesnt wield a weapon in the truest

sense, is herself a living weapon that presents special chal-

lenges to opponents.

Most   ghters  tend  to  choose  a  limited  group  of  favorite

weapons  at  a  relatively  low  level,  investing  feats  (such  as

Weapon Focus or Exotic Weapon Pro ciency) and gold (in

the  form  of  magical  enhancements)  into  these  weapons.

Before  too  long,  a   ghter  has  made  a  reputation  for   ght-

ing in a certain way, and that style almost certainly re ects

his  weapon  choice.  More  than  most  characters,  the   ghter

chooses a style and generally sticks to it. Its a rare  ghter, for

instance, who sets aside a career of sword-and-shield combat

for a two-handed weapon, but a wizard or druid can change

her  spell  selection  every  day.  On  top  of  that,  most   ghters

cant easily change weapons during a battle, so specializing in

a weapon with a limited niche of usefulness (such as a reach

weapon or a ranged weapon) can put you at a disadvantage

when that isnt the right weapon for the job (such as  ghting

in a cramped dungeon corridor).

All this makes the  ghters choice of weapon an extraor-

dinarily  important  one.  By  8th  level,  most  combat-minded

characters have spent at least two feats on a speci c weapon

(Weapon Focus and Improved Critical), and possibly three or

more. The last thing a  ghter wants to worry about is whether

hes going to  nd out that this weapon hes spent so much

effort mastering isnt the right choice.

So how can you be sure youre making the right choice?

Theres no perfect answer, but there are some guidelines to

consider when picking your weapon.

If You Have It, Flaunt It: If you have a high Strength,

theres no better weapon than a two-handed weapon to deal

out truly massive amounts of damage. This option sacri ces

some  Armor  Class  (since  you  cant  carry  a  shield),  so  you

may need to rely on a good Dexterity (for extra points of AC)

or  a  high  Constitution  (for  more  hit  points).  Similarly,  the

high-Strength  ghter with a composite longbow built to his

speci cations puts the crossbow user to shame.

Hide Your Weaknesses: If you have a low Strength but

a high Dexterity, dont  ght with a big weapon. Instead, use

a light weapon (or better yet, a rapier) with Weapon Finesse

as a cheap way of dramatically improving your attack roll. If

your Dexterity modi er is at least 2 points higher than your

Strength  modi er,  Weapon  Finesse  is  better  than  Weapon

Focus. Sure, youre giving up some damage potential by using

a lighter weapon, but in most situations you would rather be

hitting more often and dealing slightly less dam age than hit-

ting less often and dealing slightly more damage.

A  low-Dexterity  character  may  need  the  extra  bonus  to

Armor Class provided by heavy armor and a shield, putting

two-handed weapons and two-weapon  ghting out of reach.

This  character  should  focus  on  getting  the  biggest  one-

handed weapon he can, such as a bastard sword or a dwarven

waraxe.

Look at Your Feats: Many feats lend themselves to being

used  with  certain  types  of  weapons.  For  instance,  Power

Attack  is  much  more  potent  with  a  two-handed  weapon

than with a one-handed weapon, and is useless with a light

weapon.  A  character  with  Two-Weapon  Fighting  should

wield the same light weapon in both hands to reduce pen-

alties and maximize bonuses from other feats. If you have

Combat Re exes, carry a reach weapon to widen your range

of threatened squares (and thus make more attacks of oppor-

tunity).  Spring  Attack  is  much  more  useful  to  a  character

wielding a single big weapon (such as a bastard sword or a

greataxe) than a character wielding two light weapons, since

you only get to make one attack during any round that you

use  Spring  Attack.  Quick  Draw  lets  you  change  between

weapons easily, allowing you a wider range of options in any

given  ght.

Go with Your Heart: Some fighters insist that a weapon

with a bigger threat range (such as a longsword or, better

yet,  a  scimitar)  is  preferable  to  a  weapon  with  a  bigger

critical  multiplier  (such  as  a  battleaxe  or  a  heavy  pick)

because  its  more  reliable.  On  the  other  hand,  a  triple-

damage critical hit by a raging barbarian with a greataxe

may end the fight before it begins. In the end, the choice

of  wide  threat  range  versus  big  multiplier  depends  a  lot

on whether you prefer to slog along steadily, dealing out

double-damage critical hits on a regular basis, or swing the

fight wildly on the rare occasion of a triple-damage critical

hit. Both are fine choices, but you should pick the one that

suits your temperament.

EXOTIC WEAPONS

As stated above, a  ghters choice of weapon says a great deal

about  his  tactics  and  combat  style.  Those  who  use  exotic

weaponswhether a whip, dire  ail, or one of the weapons

described  belowconsciously  differentiate  themselves

from the rank-and- le sword- and axe-swingers. The  ghter

swinging a spiked chain or lajatang says to his opponents, I

am different from others you have fought, and your previous

experience did not prepare you for what I am capable of doing

to you. Sometimes, thats all the edge you need.

Weapon Familiarity

Some races are associated with speci c exotic weapons, such

as  dwarves  and  the  dwarven  waraxe.  The  Players  Handbook

grants  weapon  familiarity  to  these  races,  allowing  them  to

treat  certain  exotic  weapons  as  martial  weapons.  With  the

limited number of race-speci c exotic weapons in the Players

Handbook, this doesnt give any one race an unfair advantage.

However,  if  you  introduce  more  race-speci c  exotic  weap-

ons,  such  as  the  ones  included  in  this  book,  the  advantage

increases in signi cance.

To  compensate,  consider  limiting  the  number  of  exotic

weapons that a given character of that race can treat as famil-

iar to no more than the number of weapons associated with

the race in the Players Handbook (or in the Monster Manual

for orcs). Thus, a given dwarf  ghter might be able to treat

Gnome tortoise blade

Dwarven buckler-axe

the  dwarven  waraxe  and  the  dwarven  buckler-axe  (a  new

weapon described here) as martial weapons, but would have

to treat the dwarven urgrosh as an exotic weapon. A gnome

ranger could treat the gnome hooked hammer or the gnome

tortoise blade (a new weapon) as a martial weapon, but not

both. An elf  ghter cant treat any exotic weapons as martial

weapons, since elves dont have weapon familiarity with any

exotic weapons according to the Players Handbook. Characters

who wish to master all their races exotic weapons can select

the Improved Weapon Familiarity feat described in Chapter

3 of this book.

If the character must choose which exotic weapons to treat

as martial weapons, this decision should be made the  rst time

the character gains pro ciency in all martial weapons (at 1st

level for a barbarian,  ghter, paladin, or ranger, or the  rst time

a character gains a level in any of those classes or any prestige

class that grants pro ciency in all martial weapons). Once the

decision is made, it cant be changed; however, the DM may

allow characters to change their decisions if new race-speci c

exotic weapons are later introduced to the game.

Even  if  a  character  treats  an  exotic  weapon  as  a  martial

weapon thanks to weapon familiarity, it is still treated as an

exotic weapon for the purpose of qualifying for feats, pres-

tige classes, or other bene ts that require the character to be

skilled in the use of an exotic weapon.

EXOTIC WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS

The weapons on Table 46 are described below, along with

any special options the wielder has for their use.

Blowgun, Greater: Like its smaller cousin (see page 145 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide), the greater blowgun is often used

to deliver poison. The darts it  res are larger than blowgun

needles,  but  smaller  than  a  thrown  dart.  These  darts  deal

damage in addition to delivering poison. A greater blowgun

requires two hands to use or reload. Loading a blowgun is a

move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

A  greater  blowgun  has  a  maximum  range  of   ve  range

increments.

Bolas, Barbed: This weapon is similar to a normal set of

bolas, except that its weighted balls are studded with hooked

barbs and thus deal lethal (not nonlethal) damage. Because

the  barbed  bolas  can  wrap  around  an  enemys  leg  or  other

limb, you can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack

against an opponent. You cant be tripped during your own

trip attempt when using a set of barbed bolas.

For  purposes  of  weapon  pro ciency  and  similar  feats,

barbed  bolas  are  treated  as  if  they  were  bolas.  Thus,  if  you

have Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (bolas), you are also pro -

cient with barbed bolas.

Boomerang: The boomerang is a curved throwing stick

that  returns  to  its  thrower  if  it  misses  its  target.  To  catch

a returning boomerang, the thrower must make an attack

roll  (as  if  he  were  throwing  the  boomerang)  and  hit  AC

10.  Failure  indicates  the  boomerang  lands  in  a  randomly

determined square adjacent to the thrower (if the thrower

is pro cient) or 1d4 squares away in a random direction (if

not pro cient).

Buckler-Axe,  Dwarven:  At   rst  glance  the  dwarven

buckler-axe  appears  similar  to  a  standard  buckler,  but  this

weapon has enlarged bladelike edges at its top and bottom,

allowing the wielder to swing it like an axe. Thus, in addition

to its obvious protective qualities, it proves a capable off-hand

weapon or emergency weapon when disarmed.

A dwarven buckler-axe grants its wielder a +1 shield bonus

to Armor Class. As with any shield, when you attack with a

dwarven buckler-axe, you do not get the shield bonus to your

AC.

The  buckler-axe  also  provides  a  1  armor  check  penalty

and  incurs  a  5%  arcane  spell  failure  chance  for  its  wielder.

Like  a  spiked  shield,  a  buckler-axe  can  be  enhanced  as  a

weapon, as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be

paid for and applied separately.

Dart, Blowgun: A blowgun dart resembles a lightweight,

undersized  arrow.  You  dont  apply  your  Strength  modi er

to damage with a blowgun dart. A blowgun dart cant effec-

tively be used as a melee weapon. Blowgun darts come in a

leather pouch that holds 10 darts. A dart that hits its target is

destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance to be destroyed

or lost.

Greatbow:  You  need  at  least  two  hands  to  use  a  bow,

regardless  of  its  size.  A  greatbow  sized  for  a  Medium

character  is  6  feet  or  more  in  length  when  strung.  A

greatbow  is  too  un wieldy  to  use  while  mounted.  Like

other bows, if you have a penalty for low Strength, apply

it to damage rolls when using a greatbow. If you have a

bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls

when you use a composite greatbow (see below) but not a

regular greatbow.

Greatbow,  Composite:  You  need  at  least  two  hands  to

use  a  bow,  regardless  of  its  size.  A  composite  greatbow  is

too unwieldy to use while mounted. A composite greatbow

sized  for  a  Medium  character  is  6  feet  or  more  in  length

when strung. Composite greatbows follow all of the normal

rules for composite bows, including strength ratings. Each

point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 200 gp to

the cost.

Greatspear: This broad-bladed spear has a long,  at blade,

and is too heavy to wield properly without pro ciency.

Hammer, Double: A double hammer is a double weapon.

You can  ght with it as if  ghting with two weapons, but if

you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated

with   ghting  with  two  weapons  as  if  you  were  attacking

with a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. (See page

160 of the Players Handbook for details on  ghting with two

weapons.)

9/12/03, 4:27:27 PM

Lajatang:  The  lajatang  is  a  staff  with  a  crescent-shaped

blade at each end. A lajatang is a double weapon. You can  ght

with  it  as  if   ghting  with  two  weapons,  but  if  you  do,  you

incur all the normal attack penalties associated with  ghting

with two weapons: a one-handed weapon and a light weapon

(see page 160 of the Players Handbook).

A monk who is pro cient with the lajatang can treat it as a

special monk weapon, as described in the monk class descrip-

tion (page 40 of the Players Handbook). Each end counts as a

separate weapon for the purpose of the  urry of blows ability,

similar to how the quarterstaff works.

Lightblade, Elven: This rapierlike weapon is the size of a

short sword, but weighs only as much as a dagger. Dexterous

elf  ghters and rogues favor it. Its thin,  exible blade slips

easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs of a foe.

Some  elf  nobles  carry  a  lightbladeoften  decorated  with

intricate  ligree and tiny gemstonesas a sign of their sta-

tion, even if they arent pro cient in its use.

Mancatcher: City guards and others who prefer to capture

their  opponents  unharmed  use  the  mancatcher.  A  wielder

who hits a target of its size or one size category smaller than

it with a mancatcher can immediately attempt to grapple (as

a  free  action)  without  provoking  an  attack  of  opportunity.

Any  grapple  check  you  make  using  a  mancatcher  includes

the mancatchers enhancement bonus (if any) and any other

bonuses you might have on attack rolls with the weapon (such

as from the Weapon Focus feat). If you grapple a target with

a mancatcher, you are considered grappling, but unless your

target can reach you, he cant attempt to attack you, damage

you, or pin you. You can escape the grapple automatically by

releasing the target as a standard action.

In addition to the normal options available to a grappler,

the wielder of a mancatcher can attempt to force his target to

the ground (the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack

roll  is  necessary).  The  mancatcher  is  a  reach  weapon  and

cannot be used against adjacent opponents.

Maul:  A  maul  is  too  large  to  use  in  one  hand  without

special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Pro ciency

feat).  A  character  can  use  a  maul  two-handed  as  a  martial

weapon.

Pick, Dire: A dire pick resembles a heavy pick, but with a

longer shaft and a more massive head. A dire pick is too large

to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate

Exotic Weapon Pro ciency feat). A character can use a dire

pick two-handed as a martial weapon.

Poleaxe, Heavy: A heavy poleaxe has reach; you can strike

opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cant use it against an

adjacent foe. Normally, you strike with the heavy poleaxes

axe head, but the spike on the end is useful against charging

opponents. If you use a ready action to set a heavy poleaxe

against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit

against a charging creature.

9/12/03, 4:27:44 PM

Scourge:  This  multitailed,  barbed  whip  is  often  dipped

in a poison delivered via injury. You get a +2 bonus on your

opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent

(including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack

fails) with this weapon.

Thinblade,  Elven:  This  rapierlike  weapon  is  the  size  of

a  longsword,  but  much  lighter.  Dexterous  elf   ghters  and

rogues  favor  it.  Its  thin,   exible  blade  slips  easily  into  the

seams of armor, or between the ribs of an enemy.

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexter-

ity modi er instead of your Strength modi er to attack rolls

with an elven thinblade.

Tortoise Blade, Gnome: This contraption is designed to

be used by a gnome in his or her off hand. It is particularly

useful  in  cramped  tunnels  or  warrens  where  swinging  a

weapon is dif cult or impossible. It looks like a turtle shell

strapped to the wielders wrist, with a daggerlike blade jut-

ting out where the wielders  ngers should be.

A tortoise blade grants a +1 shield bonus to Armor Class.

As with any shield, when you attack with a tortoise blade you

do not get the shield bonus to your AC.

A tortoise blade also provides a 1 armor check penalty and

incurs a 5% arcane spell failure chance for its wielder. Like a

spiked shield, a tortoise blade can be enhanced as a weapon,

as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be paid for

and applied separately.

Warmace: Anyone wielding a warmace takes a 1 penalty

to Armor Class because the weight of the weapon makes it

dif cult to recover quickly from swinging it. A warmace is

too  large  to  use  in  one  hand  without  special  training  (the

appropriate  Exotic  Weapon  Pro ciency  feat).  A  character

can use a warmace two-handed as a martial weapon.

PRIMITIVE

WEAPONS

Many  so-called  exotic

weapons

are  weapons

more  common  to  primitive

cultures,  such  as  Stone  Age

humans.  To  re ect  that  fact,

the  DM  could  allow  primitive

cultures  (or  even  some  of  the  more

savage  races,  such  as  lizardfolk)  to  treat

blowguns  as  simple  weapons  and  any  or  all

the following exotic weapons as martial weap-

ons: bolas, barbed bolas, boomerang, greater blowgun,

and net. As a tradeoff, you could rule that such races treat

bows and crossbows (of all sorts) as exotic weapons. If you

want to play such a character, work out a fair balance with

your DM.

IMPROVISED WEAPONS

As detailed in the Players Handbook, objects not crafted

to  be  used  as  weapons  may  nonetheless  find  use  in

combat.  This  is  most  true  in  the  stereotypical  tavern

brawl,  but  any  time  a  character  cant  or  doesnt  want  to

use a weapon, he needs to know how effective the closest

object is in a fight.

Any creature using an improvised weaponfrom a broken

bottle to a barstoolin a  ght is considered to be nonpro -

cient with it and thus takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls made

with  it.  An  improvised  weapon  scores  a  threat  (a  possible

critical hit) on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage

on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range

increment of 10 feet.

What about  ghting with ladders, wagon wheels, or coils of

rope? In the hands of a determined (or desperate) individual,

these oddly shaped objects offer a wide variety of options in

combat. Of course, you must still deal with the 4 penalty

on attack rolls made with such a weapon, but sometimes you

have to make use of whats available!

Bull  Rush:  If  you  perform  a  bull  rush  while  carrying

a big, sturdy object (such as a bench or table), you add a +2

bonus on your Strength check to push back the defender.

Defense: Objects with lots of surface area (such as

tables) grant you a +2 shield bonus to Armor Class (or a

+4 shield bonus to AC if you use the total defense action), but

require two hands to use.

Disarm:  Any  object  with  a  lot  of  protrusions  (such  as  a

chair  or  a  broken  wagon  wheel)  or  that  can  easily  ensnare

objects (such as a cloak or a ladder) grants the wielder a +2

bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy

(including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such

an attempt fails).

Entangle: Any sheetlike  exible object

The Complete Warrior presents prestige classes, feats,

spells, magic items, and organizations geared for the

martial at heart. This article expands one of these

organizations, the Order of the Chalice, with details of

membership, a fully developed chapter house, and

complete statistics blocks for three NPC members.

ORDER OF THE CHALICE

The Order of the Chalice is the organization to which

all knights of the Chalice (and those aspiring to that

prestige class) belong. Unsurprisingly, its membership

is made up largely of characters with paladin levels.

Members of the Order of the Chalice devote them-

selves entirely to the organizations primary mission:

the complete eradication of demons in the multiverse.

To this end, they seek out and destroy demons wher-

ever they exist on the Material Plane and carry out well-

planned surgical strikes against targets within the Abyss

itself. These stalwart knights have battled demonkind

in every place and every situation, and many have sacri-

ficed their lives to the cause. Nonetheless, the group has

had enough successes that its existence has become a

concern to the demon princes themselves.

The Order of the Chalice considers its hard-won vic-

tories to be the necessary precursors to its inevitable

triumph. The leaders of the order have researched the

Abyss in considerable detail. They believe that if the

demon princes are removed from the Abyssal power

structure, the remaining demons will fall to infighting.

Those groups that do not simply eradicate one another

in the struggle for supremacy will splinter, and the

resulting subgroups will be much easier for members

of the order to confront and vanquish. Thus, the order

has  targeted  the  most  powerful  demons  for  early

extinction.

OVERVIEW AND BRIEF HISTORY

The forces of evil have plagued the multiverse since the

very beginning of time. While villainous outsiders take

many forms and originate in numerous places, demons

have distinguished themselves as the most vile and

troublesome breed. They embody the purest evil, their

chaotic nature causes them to wreak havoc indiscrimi-

nately, their sheer numbers are immense, and they are

physically more powerful than many other beings in

existence. In fact, sages surmise that demons would

quickly overtake the multiverse if they could overcome

their chaotic nature long enough to unite and go on an

organized offensive against the rest of creation.

The Order of the Chalice was founded by nine pal-

adins who had independently encountered numerous

1

demons in their travels. They had found these foul

creatures manipulating the world in various waysdis-

guising themselves as humanoids to influence the lead-

ers of nations, marching armies of their horrid kind

into civilized regions simply to slaughter innocents,

and controlling some of the most evil monsters known

to exist. Ultimately, the paths of these nine champions

of good crossed, and they found common cause as they

related their experiences to one another. Deciding that

the most serious threat to good was the existence of

demons in the multiverse, they began to devise a strat-

egy to fight them on a grand scale.

By consulting the paragons of good, they determined

that demons exist in finite numbers. Knowing that over-

hunting a species can cause it to become extinct, they

reasoned  that  the  same  principle  should  apply  to

demons. Though they knew that evil could never be

completely eradicated, they felt that it should be possible

to remove its front-line troops from the battle.

To that end, they founded the Order of the Chalice,

a fraternal organization dedicated to the destruction of

demons. The name is derived from their most sacred

holy iteman ornate silver cup reputed to have caught

the blood of a solar while it fought a demon prince. The

founders faced two separate challenges: developing

more effective ways of fighting demons, and building

up the numbers of their order. The latter goal proved

somewhat problematical to meet in the early days. Not

every paladin agreed that the destruction of demons

should be the primary concern of paladins everywhere,

and many refused the call to join, though they wel-

comed the existence of such a group. Thus, recruit-

ment, particularly of paladins, became a major focus of

the organization.

Eventually, the orders numbers swelled to the point

where a hierarchical organization become both feasible

and necessary. (See Complete Warrior, page 142, for

details of the organizational structure.) During this

period of growth, members often pursued independent

quests to foil demonic plots and learn strategic infor-

mation about key demonic strongholds. Also during

this time, Order of the Chalice chapter houses began to

appear in numerous major cities to serve as bases of

operation. At a chapter house, the knights could rest

between  excursions,  share  information  they  had

obtained, plan out new operations, and recruit new

members.

The Order of the Chalice has existed for more than

a  century,  and  in  that  time,  the  organization  has

accomplished many of its goals. Its members have

repelled demonic invasions from various locations in

the Material Plane, uncovered demonic plots that

would have caused key kingdoms and nations to fall

under the control of dark overlords, and mounted

numerous successful expeditions into the Abyss to

destroy demons where they live.

THE ORGANIZATION

The Order of the Chalice maintains a presence in most

kingdoms and nations of the Material Plane. Chapter

houses exist in most cities as well as a few outlying

regions where demons are often found. A few chapter

houses exist on other planes as well.

Hierarchy: The Order of the Chalice has a strict

hierarchy headed by nine Masters of the Chalice. Nine

Chalice Marshals report to each of them. See Complete

Warrior, page 142, for additional details of the organiza-

tional structure.

Headquarters: Each of the nine Masters of the

Chalice maintains his own keep, which functions as an

official headquarters of the organization. Each such

keep has full control over the various chapter houses in

its region.

Members: The organization has 7,380 members

when all positions are filled. In addition, more than

3,000  squires  are  affiliated  with  the  organization,

though they have not yet been granted membership.

Religion: The religious views of the membership

vary, although all members must pay homage to Heiro-

neous on some level. Paladins, clerics, and other divine

spellcasters who are dedicated to other deities are

merely required to acknowledge Heironeous as a force

for good and a friend of the order, and to offer prayers

to him as well as to their own gods.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Secrecy: The Order of the Chalice uses some

secrecy. Chapter house locations are known, but many

knights of the Chalice find it necessary to conceal their

identities, especially when infiltrating evil locations.

Symbol: A radiant silver cup.

LEADERSHIP

The leaders of the order are devoted to defending the

chalice itself. Each is the master of a keep, and the chal-

ice is moved around among the nine of them according

to a little-known schedule. Permanent magical portals

that allow only lawful good creatures to pass have been

constructed within each keep so that the chalice can

quickly be relocated should its current home fall to

demonic forces.

The identities of the nine masters are known only to

the Chalice Marshals. Many servants, family members,

2

and others living in the keeps that belong to the mas-

ters are unaware of the role they play in the organiza-

tion, or even that they are affiliated with it. This secrecy

is maintained so that the demonic forces and those

loyal to them cannot easily locate and destroy the com-

mand structure of the organization.

MEMBERSHIP

Many members of the order started out as paladins, but

clerics are well represented in its ranks, and rangers

make up a significant minority. A few wizards who

arent actually members serve in permanent advisory

positions. In addition, squires (new recruits who have

not yet been granted membership) number almost half

the organizations actual membership.

RECRUITING

The order loses approximately 8% of its members every

year to retirement and death in the line of duty, so

active recruitment is necessary to keep the numbers

stable. About half the new recruits are simply individu-

als who, because of their own wish to join, have sought

out the nearest chapter house and presented them-

selves as candidates for membership. If their petitions

are approved, they become squires and work their way

up to full membership in the organization. A small

number of recruits come from populations that mem-

bers of the order have rescued from demonic menaces.

These individuals either feel that they owe the order a

debt of gratitude, or that demonkind deserves payback

for its crimes against them and their loved ones. Most

of these individuals are relatively inexperienced, so

they too begin as squires, though a select few qualify

for full membership upon application. The rest of the

recruits are characters that individual knights of the

Chalice encounter in their travels and convince to join

the organization. Most of these are experienced adven-

turers, and some qualify to become full members upon

joining.

When a member of the organizational hierarchy

falls, a replacement is appointed immediately from the

next lower rank. Chalice Sergeants are drawn from

new members, while Chalice Commanders, Marshals,

and Masters are always drawn from the group one step

beneath them.

MEMBER BENEFITS AND

RESPONSIBILITIES

A common joke within the order holds that the bene-

fits of membership include joining a strict and regi-

mented organization, foreswearing the love of others,

and death in combat with some of the most powerful

creatures known to exist. In truth, other benefits do

exist, most of which revolve around the fraternal struc-

ture of the organization. Those who join the order are

considered members for life unless they denounce the

organization or their behavior proves inconsistent with

its ideals (as is the case with characters who change

alignment). Knights of the Chalice can find a peaceful

place to stay in any chapter house, and both current

and retired members always open their homes to mem-

bers in need of a place to stay.

Furthermore, members can purchase magic items of

better quality than would normally be available in a

given area through the order. The gold piece limit for

any weapon, shield, or armor purchased in a locale

where a chapter house is located increases by 20%. For

example, a small city usually has a 15,000 gp limit. If

the city has a chapter house, however, the limit for

buying  weapons,  shields,  and  armor  is  18,000  gp

instead.  In  addition,  members  enjoy  a  discount

amounting to a 10% reduction in the market value of

most magic items, up to a maximum of 15,000 gp worth

of magic items (base market price) per year. (When

deciding what items are available for sale through the

order in a particular locale, use the base market price,

not the discounted price.) In addition, at the discretion

the local leadership, members can borrow items from

the order or even purchase them on credit. Full repay-

ment of such loans is generally expected within a

month.

The behavioral expectations for a knight of the

Chalice are stricter than the standard paladins code of

conduct. Knights must remain chaste and celibate,

must never touch a corpse, and must embrace the

destruction of demons as their highest duty in all cir-

cumstances. In addition, to ensure the future of the

organization, fund the chapter houses, and pay for the

construction of new magic items, each member must

turn over 15% of the gold piece value of any treasure he

finds to the order.

ENCOUNTERS

PCs may interact with the Order of the Chalice in a

number of different ways. A party of good alignment

may include one or more members of the order. Alter-

natively, characters on the trail of some demonic threat

may enlist the aid of an NPC member of the order or

trade information with order representatives. Finally, if

the characters are evil, the Order of the Chalice may be

the source of many opponents.

ORDER OF THE CHALICE

CHAPTER HOUSE

The orders chapter houses vary in size and layout based

on space constraints, the special needs of the local

chapter, and the number of members that frequent the

house in question. The chapter house described here is

a representative sample that can be inserted into any

major city where the knights of the Chalice are active.

The exterior walls are constructed of sandstone, and

the interior ones are masonry. Carefully fitted squares

of white marble cover the floors. The outside of the

structure is engraved with images depicting warriors in

full plate armor and scenes that show demons being

vanquished. Portcullises protect all entries into the

building. Unless the city is in danger or there are

known enemies of the organization nearby, these are

kept open during the day and manned by Chalice

Sergeants.

ss Exterior Walls: 5 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 300;

AC 2; break DC 50, Climb DC 20.

ss Interior Walls: 6 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 45;

AC 2; break DC 28, Climb DC 20.

ss Portcullis: 2 in. thick; hardness 10; hp 60; AC

2; break DC 24 (28 when locked), Open Lock DC 20.

1. Foyer

The foyer is used as an impromptu ceremonial cham-

ber to welcome distinguished visitors and as a waiting

room for nonmembers who have business with the

organization. Four guards (sample questers; see below)

are on duty here at any given time. The room is well lit

by an ornate crystal chandelier, and the walls are deco-

rated with various symbols, including stylized versions

of the holy symbol of Heironeous. Several overstuffed

couches ensure the comfort of guests until someone

arrives to greet them.

2. Antechamber

Four guards (sample questers; see below) keep a quiet

vigil in this otherwise empty room, monitoring visitors

to area 3.

3. Chapel/Auditorium

This massive chamber serves as both a meeting room

for members and a chapel. In the former capacity, it is

most often used to formulate strategies for dealing with

expected demonic incursions or plan ventures into the

outer planes. Any knights of the Chalice who happen

to be staying in the chapter house usually attend such

meetings,  though  attendance  is  never  mandatory

unless there is a viable demonic threat to either the

order itself or the city.

The symbol of Heironeous (a fist clutching a bolt of

lightning) has been engraved into the walls, and two

great statues of the god stand on opposite sides of the

dais  on  the  north  side  of  the  room.  Members  are

allowed to worship any good-aligned god here, though

they are expected to at least include Heironeous in

their prayers and supplications.

4. Storage

This nondescript room holds the mundane items used

regularly in the chapter house. Cleaning supplies,

candles, flags, suits of armor, nonmagical weapons, con-

tainers, and other odds and ends can be found here, all

organized for easy retrieval.

5. Personal Quarters

Each of these spartan chambers is furnished with a bed

and a chest for personal belongings, but there is little in

the way of decoration. Any knight of the Chalice with a

rank of commander or higher may stay in one of these

rooms upon request, unless all of them are occupied

when he arrives. Occasionally, some notable guest who

has proven her goodwill toward the organization is

offered one of these rooms as well, but only if no

knight claims the space. On rare occasions, a knight

may be asked to give up his chamber for a royal guest,

or for someone who holds a position of power within a

church that supports the cause of the order. Lighan

Afaer, the master of the chapter house (see NPCs,

below), resides within one of these rooms.

6. Common Quarters

Bunk beds stacked two high are the primary furnish-

ings in each of these rooms. Any knights below the

rank of Chalice Commander who are staying in the

chapter house may sleep here. As is standard policy

throughout the organization, there is no charge for a

member to stay in this room for any period of time.

7. Bath

Considering how well groomed the members of this

organization tend to keep themselves, it is no surprise

that this chamber sees a great deal of use. Three bath-

tubs take up the center of the room, and a large stove

against the west wall is used to heat water. Servants are

on duty here at all times.

8. Preparations Room

Clerics and others who are leading religious services

use this room to don ceremonial attire, examine pres-

entation notes, and prepare any holy items needed for

the coming celebration. Occasionally, the room is also

used as a quiet meditation chamber for the preparation

4

5

of divine spells. This chamber is open to any members

wishing  to  use  it,  but  it  may  be  reserved  prior  to

specific events.

9. Servants Quarters

The eight servants (each commoner 4) who work at the

chapter house are housed in this room. Four sets of

bunk beds provide sleeping space, and two sets of draw-

ers hold personal belongings. The servants are here by

choice, and each is paid 2 gp per week. Their workloads

are average, but the knights of the Chalice are more

concerned with their servants well-being than most

other  employers,  and  they  give  the  staff  liberal

amounts of time off to spend with family.

10. Kitchen

Food for the chapter house is prepared in this room by

the servants and then served in area 12. Appetizers and

light meals, which are usually eaten in area 11, are also

prepared here.

Three stoves line the east wall, and the entire

north end of the room serves as a pantry. The food is

as high in quality as that found in some of the finest

inns. The knights dine on roasted meats of all types,

fresh or preserved fruits and vegetables (depending

on the season), meat pies, confections, and bread.

Food is available here at any time of the day or night,

although anyone wishing to eat between dusk and

early morning must allow the servants an hour to

prepare the food.

11. Common Area

This chamber is an informal dining area where the

knights of the Chalice come to relax. It is used prima-

rily for socializing, but light refreshments are always

available. Numerous comfortable chairs are scattered

throughout the room, and tables near the walls are

stocked with light snacks and beverages. A dais in the

northwest corner holds musical instruments and a few

chairs for those who wish to entertain their fellows.

Those who are musically inclined may strum a tune, or

a storyteller may relate the tales of her travels to other

knights. Because knights come and go frequently,

there are always a few members of the order here look-

ing for their friends and swapping tales of their battles

against demons.

12. Dining Room

Three meals a day are served in this formal dining area,

and all who are staying in or visiting the chapter house

are invited to partake. The room is furnished with long

tables  flanked  by  chairs  covered  in  black  leather.

A depiction of the silver chalice that symbolizes the

order is engraved upon the east wall.

13. Library/Laboratory

This room is the knights primary source of informa-

tion regarding demons. The easternmost section is

filled with bookshelves stocked with leather-bound

tomes detailing the various known types of demons,

including their strengths, weaknesses, tactics, and

other information. Before the order sanctions any

expedition against demonkind, the knights thoroughly

research the demon to be challenged so that they can

prepare themselves adequately. Also within this area

are numerous volumes about planar cosmology, with

an emphasis on the outer planes.

The knights alchemical lab is also located here.

Spell components are stored in this area, along with

pickled portions of demonic anatomy, which the mem-

bers  study  to  gain  information  about  their  foes.

(Though knights of the Chalice are not allowed to

touch dead bodies, they can touch the jars that contain

the demonic parts, which are prepared by the orders

consulting arcane spellcasters.)

A lawful good forbiddance effect and a Mordenkainens

private sanctum spell keep intruders from making off

with the demonic parts. Although many of the body

parts stored here came from the corpses of slain crea-

tures, some were hacked from living demons who did

not perish in battle and would very much like to know

where the missing portions of their anatomies might be.

14. Smithy

This area is used to craft weapons and armor. Metal-

working is done by the knights of the Chalice, and

work is rarely given to blacksmiths who are not part

of the organization. When an arcane caster is needed

to enchant a weapon, the knight doing the metalwork

calls  in  one  of  the  orders  consulting  wizards  or

sorcerers.

15. Stables

The knights mounts are stabled in this area. Mounts

are typically brought onto the grounds through the

portcullis in the eastern outer wall, then led into the

stable through a pair of double doors that open from

the building onto the courtyard. Each stall can house

a Large mount, and one stall can accommodate a

Huge mount. The limited space in the stable is avail-

able to the knights on a first-come, first-served basis.

Knights who arrive after every available space has

been taken must make arrangements with other

stables in the city.

6

16. Courtyard

Oak trees, flowers, and other ornamental plants spring

from a carpet of lush grass in each of these outdoor

garden areas within the chapter house walls. The court-

yards are available for knights and visitors alike to

enjoy.

17. Outer Walls

Each of the 15-foot-thick outer walls consists of a 5-

foot-wide walkway flanked by two 5-foot-thick sand-

stone walls. This walkway allows those within the keep

to access the other structures in the chapter house

without exposing themselves to any harm. The walls

are 15 feet tall, and ladderlike footholds carved into the

courtyard side provide access to the roof. The roofs of

the chapter houses three structures are open so that

defenders may walk upon them.

NPCS

The following NPCs are associated with the Order of

the Chalice chapter house presented above. They repre-

sent the usual range of characters that PCs are likely to

encounter when visiting the place. They can be used

within the context of the chapter house itself, or in

other dealings with the Order of the Chalice.

Sample Quester

Trelannor Vaun comes from a long line of good war-

riors who have defended the land from the many forms

of evil that threaten it. As a child, he was highly com-

petitive with his peers, and he strove to be the best at

everything he did. When he grew older, he felt a call-

ing to seek out and destroy evil wherever it might lie.

He found faith in the worship of Heironeous and even-

tually became a paladin of that deity.

As Trelannor advanced, he came to realize that

demons, devils, and other outsiders were working

against all that was good. In some cases, they func-

tioned as subtle forces behind the scenes, but in other

cases, they were direct forces for evil within the world.

About this time, he learned of the Knights of the

Chalice and decided to seek them out. His devotion to

the cause of good and his disdain for evil outsiders

quickly gained him the rank of quester for the order.

Like his fellow questers, he is now working toward full

membership in the Order of the Chalice.

Smite Evil (Su): Twice per day, Trelannor may

attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. He

adds +1 to his attack roll and deals 5 points of addi-

tional damage. If he accidentally smites a creature that

is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the attempt still

uses up one daily use of the ability.

Turn Undead (Su): Trelannor turns undead as a

3rd-level cleric.

Aura of Courage (Su): Trelannor is immune to

fear, magical or otherwise. Each ally within 10 feet of

him gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against

fear effects.

Aura of Good (Ex): Trelannors aura of good is

strong.

Detect Evil (Sp): Trelannor can use detect evil, as

the spell, at will.

Divine  Grace  (Su): Trelannor  applies  his

Charisma bonus to all saving throws. (This modifier is

already figured into the statistics given above.)

Divine Health (Ex): Trelannor is immune to all

diseases, including magical diseases such as mummy

rot and lycanthropy.

Special Mount (Sp): Trelannor has a heavy

warhorse named Akabar as his special mount. He gains

the following benefits from Akabar.

Empathic Link (Su):Trelannor can communicate tele-

pathically with Akabar at a distance of up to 1 mile. He

has the same connection to an item or a place that

Akabar does.

Share Spells: Trelannor may have any spell he casts

on himself also affect Akabar if the latter is within 5

feet at the time. He may also cast a spell with a target of

You on Akabar.

Lay on Hands (Su): Trelannor can heal wounds

(his own or those of others) by touch. Each day, he can

heal 5 hit points of damage. He may choose to divide

his healing among multiple recipients, and he doesnt

have to use it all at once. Alternatively, he can use any

or all of this healing to deal damage to undead crea-

tures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a success-

ful melee touch attack and doesnt provoke an attack of

opportunity.

half damage, Akabar takes no damage on a successful

save and half damage on a failed save.

Sample Chalice Sergeant

When  Edainwa  Benyth  was  a  young  woman,  she

watched summoned demons destroy her family and

most of the small village in which she had been raised.

The knights of the Chalice arrived too late to prevent

the tragedy, but they did gather up the survivors and

bring them back to their chapter house.

Most of the survivors were extremely young, but

Edainwa was almost grown and very much interested

in joining those who made a practice of crusading

against the fiends that had destroyed her family. Imme-

diately motivated to take up a sword, she became a

squire to the knights and, five years later, advanced to

quester.  As she became more skilled in combat and

more committed to the cause of good, Edainwa quickly

gained the necessary requirements for a knight of the

Chalice and was accepted as a full-fledged member of

the organization.

Now, two years after formally joining the knights,

Edainwa has distinguished herself among her peers by

rooting  out  demonic  forces  poised  to  overpower

nearby regions. On one occasion, she even took the

fight into the Abyss when she pursued and rescued a

fellow knight who had been captured by demons.

Edainwa has also recruited several new knights to the

cause. At present, she has the first of what she intends

to be many squires.

Censure Demons (Su): Any demon within 30

feet of Edainwa must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or

be stunned for 1 round if it has 4 or more Hit Dice. A

demon with 3 or fewer HD must succeed on a second

DC 12 Will save or be sent back to its home plane (as

per the dismissal spell). Only one demon is dismissed

per censure; check the lowest Hit Dice demon first.

Smite Evil (Su): Four times per day, Edainwa

may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee

attack. She adds +1 to her attack roll and deals 8 points

of additional damage. If she accidentally smites a crea-

ture that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the

attempt still uses up one daily use of the ability.

Turn Undead (Su): Edainwa turns undead as a

6th-level cleric.

Aura of Courage (Su): Edainwa is immune to

fear, magical or otherwise. Each ally within 10 feet of

her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against

fear effects.

strong.

Courage of Heaven (Su): Edainwa is immune to

fear effects cast or created by evil outsiders.

Detect Evil (Sp): Edainwa can use detect evil, as

the spell, at will.

Divine  Grace  (Su): Edainwa  applies  her

Charisma bonus to all saving throws. (This modifier is

already figured into the statistics given above.)

Divine Health (Ex): Edainwa is immune to all

diseases, including magical diseases such as mummy

rot and lycanthropy.

Fiendslaying (Ex): Edainwa has a +1 bonus on

attack rolls against evil outsiders. On a successful

8

attack, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. She also

has a +1 competence bonus on Intimidate, Listen,

Sense Motive, and Spot checks made against evil out-

siders, and a +1 bonus on Will saving throws and

opposed ability checks against creatures of this type.

Special Mount (Sp):  Edainwa  has  a  heavy

warhorse named Dalsha as her special mount. She

gains the following benefits from Dalsha.

Empathic Link (Su): Edainwa can communicate tele-

pathically with Dalsha at a distance of up to 1 mile.

Edainwa has the same connection to an item or a place

that Dalsha does.

Share Spells: Edainwa may have any spell she casts on

herself also affect Dalsha if the latter is within 5 feet at

the time. Edainwa may also cast a spell with a target of

You on Dalsha.

Lay on Hands (Su): Edainwa can heal wounds (her

own or those of others) by touch. Each day, she can heal 8

hit points of damage. She may choose to divide her heal-

ing among multiple recipients, and she doesnt have to

use it all at once. Alternatively, she can use any or all of

this healing to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay

on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch

attack and doesnt provoke an attack of opportunity.

Remove Disease (Sp): Edainwa can produce a

remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week.

Sample Chalice Marshal

A proven leader within the Order of the Chalice, Lighan

Afaer is the current head of the Crimson Chalice Chap-

ter House, where eighty-one Chalice Sergeants serve

under his command. Lighans experience as a cleric and

his degree of devotion to Heironeous, which surpasses

that of many other knights of the Chalice, have allowed

him to move up through the orders ranks quickly.

Lighan joined the knights of the Chalice because of

his religious beliefs. He knows in his heart that order

and good can conquer evil throughout the entire multi-

verse, and he believes that the existence of demons is

an affront to his god and his beliefs. Based on these

convictions, Lighan not only takes up arms against

demons himself, but he also actively recruits other

brave individuals into the Order of the Chalice.

As a Chalice Marshal, Lighan has the authority to

round up manpower to combat demons on all fronts,

and  indeed  he  has  led  the  charge  against  several

demonic incursions onto the Material Plane. He has

also made several expeditions into the Abyss to fight

demons where their power bases lie. While a few of

these excursions were simple fact-finding missions

designed to discover the landscape of the various

Abyssal layers, Lighan has also launched full assaults

against several minor demon lords, thus weakening the

power structures that exist within the Abyss.

the Chalice 4; CR 15; Medium humanoid; HD 11d8+11

feet of Lighan must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be

stunned for 1 round if it has 8 or more Hit Dice. A

demon with 7 or fewer HD must succeed on a second

DC 14 Will save or be sent back to its home plane (as

per the dismissal spell). Only one demon is dismissed

per censure; check the lowest Hit Dice demon first.

fear effects cast or created by evil outsiders.

Fiendslaying (Ex): Lighan has a +2 bonus on
