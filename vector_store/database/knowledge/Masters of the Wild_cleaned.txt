INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

Feel the green.

Vadania

differently  than  people  who  band  together  in  walled

cities do, these characters nonetheless make formidable

opponents. This book examines the masters of the wild

in detail and provides you with new tools that you can

use to maximize their adventuring potential.

For all its magic, its fearsome dragons, and its powerful

wizards, the world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game

is still predominantly a natural one. Animals, plants, and

weather patterns form the basis of its ecology, and the

strength of nature is never in doubt. The characters who

most closely embrace this wild, natural world are fully

equipped to deal with its down-to-earth realities. These

characters arent consumed in far-flung extraplanar ex-

periments,  worship  of distant  immortal  deities,  or  ab-

stract systems of ethics. They dont withdraw from the

natural world into monasteries or cities. Druids, rangers,

and  barbarians  belong  to their  world  in  a  way  that  no

other  characters  can. The  barbarian fills  his  existence

with a zest for living and possesses indomitable strength.

The ranger combines knowledge of nature with mystical

grace. The druid welcomes into herself all the wonders of

land, sea, and sky.

Despite their power, these masters of the wild are at

heart humble people. Because they adapt to their world

and seek to protect it, fools may consider them weaker

than warlords and rulers who force their wills upon the

land. While barbarians, druids, and rangers approach life

WHAT THIS BOOK IS

AND IS NOT

The material presented herein pertains to the new edi-

tion of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Youll find new

feats, spells, and prestige classes, as well as useful advice

for  getting  the  most  out  of  your  barbarian,  druid,  or

ranger character.

Nothing here supersedes or replaces the rules and in-

formation  presented  in  the  core  rulebooks,  except  as

noted. This  supplement  is  designed  to  mesh  with  the

rules system presented in the Players Handbook, the DUN-

GEON MASTERS Guide, and the Monster Manual.

This book presents options, not restrictions, for play-

ing the D&D game. However, players should ask their

Dungeon Masters (DMs) about incorporating elements

of this book before making changes to their characters.

DMs can also make good use of the new feats, spells, and

prestige classes presented here for designing nonplayer

characters. Use what you wish and change or ignore the

rest. Have at it, and enjoy!

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

This books primary goal is to help you customize your

barbarian, druid, or ranger player character. With the ma-

terial presented here, you can personalize your character

and broaden his or her capabilities.

Chapter 1 discusses the advantages of playing a bar-

barian, druid, or ranger. Here youll find advice on how to

take advantage of your characters class abilities and min-

imize any potential weaknesses. Explanations of, advice

on, and expansions to topics that are already part of the

game, such as choosing favored enemies are also here.

Chapter 2 offers special feats, such as Fast Wild Shape

and  Dragons Toughness,  with  which  to  enhance  your

characters abilities. In addition, there is an extensive dis-

cussion of skills, with notes on new and interesting uses

of class skills for barbarians, druids, and rangers.

Chapter 3 presents items of interest to both spellcast-

ing and nonspellcasting characters.

Chapter  4  offers  advice  on  how  to  play  alongside

animal  companions.  It  also  includes  statistics  for  new

dire animals as well as for members of a new subtype of

animallegendary animals.

Chapter 5 takes your character in exciting new direc-

tions  with  the animal  lord,  the  blighter,  the  frenzied

berserker, and many other prestige classes.

Chapter 6 expands the selection of divine spells avail-

able at all spell levels.

CHAPTER 1:

NATURE(cid:146)S

LORE

Time flows like a river. All our sufferings, these are just pebbles

in the riverbed.

Vadania

This  chapter  examines the roles  of  the  barbarian,  the

ranger, and the druid in the campaign. Such characters

might appear to be loners, cut off from civilization and

stuck in the cycle of nature. Fundamentally, though, the

DUNGEONS &  DRAGONS game  isnt  about  solo  play;  its

about team dynamics in an unpredictable world. Thus,

barbarians, druids, and rangers must somehow find ways

to work harmoniously with other classes, using their par-

ticular talents to advance the groups goals. This section

discusses how to integrate these outsiders into a cam-

paign so that they can use their strengths to the fullest.

THE BARBARIAN

IN PERSPECTIVE

Theres a logic to chaos. Hit 'em with everything. you've got. Hit

em fast, hit 'em hard, hit'em till they stop moving. Thats logic.

Krusk

The barbarians road is  the path to power. Without the

combat tricks ot the lighter, the holy energy of the paladin,

or the lithe grace of the ranger, the barbarian still more than

holds his own in combat. How? Hes tougher and stronger

than everyone else, and that makes all the difference.

Many melee-oriented characters profit from an obvi-

ous versatility. The ranger and the paladin balance their

combat prowess with spellcasting and other special abil-

ities. The rogue has a wide range ot skills, the tighter a se-

lection ot bonus feats, and the monk a palette ot special

abilities. The bard is the very definition ot flexibility. So

why does the barbarian fare so well in comparison with

them? Because he has locus. He wont try to trick or de-

ceive you. He wont try to do anything but overcome you

by force. That devotion to a single methodology makes

the barbarian an unusually effective war machine. After

all, during any given round of combat, the two actions

that most characters perform are attacking and avoiding

the attacks ot others. So why not be good at it?

Of course, a barbarian must be able to take hits at least

as well as he can dish them out. Survivability is ot para-

mount importance to a character who relies primarily on

combat. While its good to have the might to strike down

toes,  its also important to live long enough to see the

next tight. The barbarian has more hit points, on average,

than a character of any other class, and his damage re-

duction ability effectively increases that total. Even rage,

his signature offensive ability, gives him extra hit points

that may allow him to survive an extra round or two of

combat. In addition, the barbarians uncanny dodge abil-

ity  minimizes  his  exposure  to  surprise,  flanking,  and

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

traps.  Finally,  many  high-level  barbarians  don  suits  of

mithral full plate (medium armor) to preserve their fast

movement while gaining the best Armor Class possible.

This same reasoning also explains the popularity of rings

of evasion and cloaks of displacement among barbarian char-

acters. In addition, the barbarians rage, damage reduc-

tion, and uncanny dodge abilities improve as he rises in

level, making him even more formidable.

All that obvious power and toughness can make a bar-

barian  forget  about  some  of  his  other  advantages.  His

class skills are diverse enough to allow for considerable

variation, and it is the  choice  of  skills  more  than  any-

thing else that differentiates one barbarian from another.

One  may  concentrate  his  skill  ranks  in Intimidate  to

become  a  swaggering  warrior;  another  may  choose  to

know the outdoors through Intuit Direction, Swim, and

Wilderness Lore.

Other adventurers tend to view the barbarian as an un-

sophisticated, ignorant, and unintelligent thug. In tact,

more  than  a  few  barbarians  do fit  that  stereotype,  but

plenty of others are cleverit not brilliantwarriors.

They may not be worldly, but neither are they gullible.

Nor are they necessarily violent, except when the situa-

tion calls for judicious use of might.

Race and the Barbarian

Human and humanoid societies exist at all levels of cul-

tural development, from primitive to advanced, so the

barbarian  class  is  open  to  all  races.  Social  restrictions

make some races more likely than others to embrace the

barbarian  way  ot life,  but  concrete  disadvantages  to

adopting the class are few.

Humans: Lacking the fighters bonus feats, a barbar-

ian can profit greatly from the bonus feat and the bonus

skills that the human race offers. Humans are also the

most likely humanoids to descend intoor fail to rise

abovea primitive culture. While that may be a regret-

table trait tor humanity in general, it makes human bar-

barians the  most  common  and  the  most  accepted

members ot that class.

Dwarves:  Barbarians  generally  dont  flourish  in

highly  regimented  societies,  so  its  no surprise  that

dwarves training tor warcratt  tend  to  become  soldiers

(fighters) rather than barbarians. Where the normally or-

derly dwarven society is absent for some reason, dwarven

barbarians can arise. For example, a dwarf who grew up

among primitive humans would be a perfect candidate

for the class, as would one whose keep was overrun and

left in chaos. Dwarves make good barbarians for many

reasons. Not only does the dwarf s +2 bonus to Constitu-

tion  enhance the  barbarians  already high  average hit

points, it also extends his rages. In addition, the barbar-

ians fast movement ability offsets the dwarf s normally

slow movement rate. Finally, the dwarven racial bonus

on saving throws to resist spells fits in nicely with the

distrust of wizardry that some barbarians exhibit.

Elves: Most elven societies do not accept barbarians,

perhaps because elves do not make especially good ones.

The elfs penalty to Constitution devalues the barbarians

natural strengths, and although he is known for his care-

free nature, the typical elf finds the primitive and some-

times  savage  ways  of  the  barbarian  repellent.  A  note-

5

Level Equivalent

Some  monsters  are  innately

more  powerful  than  members

of the common races (human,

elf,  dwarf,  and  so  on).  When

one  of  those  monsters  gains

levels in a class, some number

is added to its class levels to de-

termine  its  effective  level.  The

total of its class levels and this

number  (which  varies  accord-

ing to creature type) is its level

equivalent.

For  example,  a  grimlocks

level  equivalent  is  equal  to  its

class levels +3. This means that

a 1st-level grimlock barbarian is

effectively  a  4th-level  charac-

terin  other  words,  roughly

equal  in  power  to  a  4th-level

player  character  of  one  of  the

common  races.  (What  gives  a

grimlock  this  advantage  is  its

blindsight, coupled with its im-

munity  to  attacks  that  rely  on

the  target  having  a  visual

sense.)

An  ordinary  member  of  a

monster  race  (one  without

class  levels,  such  as  the  grim-

lock  described  in  the Monster

Manual) does  not  have  a  level

equivalent.

In  addition  to  grimlocks,

creatures discussed  in  this

book that have level equivalents

are  lizardfolk,  locathahs,  cen-

taurs,  dryads,  nymphs,  gnolls,

sahuagin, and yuan-ti.

For more on level equivalent,

see Monsters as Races in Chap-

ter  2  of  the DUNGEON MASTERS

Guide.

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

worthy exception is the wild elf (grugach), who takes up

the barbarians path with pleasure, despite his Constitu-

tion penalty.

Gnomes: Gnome barbarians are as rare as

elven ones, though the reasons for this are

primarily  social.  Gnomes  do  not  separate

themselves from the natural world, but they

do tend to prefer sophisticated professions

such  as  alchemy,  engineering,  and  skilled

trades. The average gnome enjoys his own

cleverness  too  much  to  adopt  the  boldly

direct approach of the barbarian. Thats un-

fortunate,  because  the  gnome  doesnt  per-

form poorly in that role. His size bonus to

AC and attacks and his racial Constitution

bonus  offset  his  Strength  penalty  most  of

the time, and the barbarians fast movement

can compensate for the gnomes slow speed.

Half-Elves: Most  barbarians  are  either

humans  or  half-orcs,  but  half-elves  run  a

close  third.  Since  the  half-elf  has  all  the

capriciousness  of  both  his  human  and  his

elven sides, the requirement for a nonlawful

alignment  is  easy  to  meet.  Half-elves  who

find  themselves  cast  aside  by  human  and

elven communities may find the barbarians

path an especially inviting one. Becoming a

barbarian may even lead to a form of accept-

ance for the half-elfalthough tribal soci-

eties are  not  known  for  welcoming  out-

siders,  they  readily  accept  a  strong  sword-

arm in times of trouble.

Half-orcs: Orcs are savages, its true. So,

its no real surprise that many half-orc heroes

are  barbarians.  All  orcs  can  feel  the  battle

rage pounding in their hearts, but only those

who  are  also  barbarians  can  harness  their

blood  frenzy  to  best  effect. The  half-orcs

bonus to Strength, the prime statistic for the

combat-focused,  is  worth  the  sacrifice  of

Charisma  and Intelligence.  (After  all,  how

often  must  the  barbarian  try  to  woo  or

outwit  someone?)  Count  the  number  of

times the fighter swings his sword, and re-

member that not only does the half-orc bar-

barian  typically  do  more  damage  than  the

fighter with each hit, he also hits more often.

If youre looking for the most powerful bar-

barian, and you can live with a bit of social stigma, then

half-orc is the right choice.

Halflings: For the barbarian, high Constitution is usu-

ally better than high Dexterity, so gnome tends to be a

better  choice than  halfling.  Moreover,  primitive  or

savage halfling communities are quite rare. Halflings are

creatures of comfort, and their communities are strong.

While their athleticism and bravery do them credit, and

their racial bonus to Listen checks falls right in line with

the barbarians class skills, the penalty to Strength is too

great a drawback to overlook.

Monsters:  Among the monstrous  races,  grimlocks,

lizardfolk,  locathahs,  and  orcs  are  the  most  likely  to

adopt the barbarian way of life.

6

Grimlocks  are  xenophobic,  subterranean  creatures.

Though  they  are  blind,  they  can  still  sense  their  foes

through  blindsight.  Grimlocks  charge  into  combat

wielding  battleaxes,  and  that  trait  in  itself  seems  bar-

baric.  Grimlocks  are  strong,  tough,  and  formidable

enough  to  make  fine  barbarians. Because  of  the grim-

locks various advantages, his level equivalent is his class

levels +5.

Lizardfolk make ideal barbarians, both because their

societies  tend  to  be  primitive  and  because  their  liveli-

hood  depends  primarily  on  hunting  and  raiding.  Fast

movement provides them with a speed advantage over

members of most other races. Rage greatly enhances a

lizardfolks already above-average Strength and Constitu-

tion  scorcs,  which  can  provide  a  significant  bonus  on

their weapon and natural attacks. Because of these ad-

vantages,  the  lizardfolks  level  equivalent  is his  class

levels +4.

Locathahs are an exotic but reasonable choice for bar-

barian player characters. They tend toward neutrality in

alignment,  and  while  they  dont  trust  outsiders,  they

arent as aggressive as grimlocks. Perhaps thats because

locathahs  are  unusually  intelligent  and  wise  (+2 racial

bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity) for hu-

manoids who favor the barbarian class. Locathahs have a

terrible land speed (10 feet) that even the barbarians fast

movement cant fully compensate for. Because of his ad-

vantageous ability modifiers, formidable natural armor,

and ability to breathe water, however, the locathahs level

equivalent is his class levels +3.

The orc is another common choice for barbarian, and

his +2 racial bonus to Strength is a good selling point for

the class. The DUNGEON MASTERS Guide provides rules for

playing an ore, which is basically a more extreme version

of the half-orc. Many of the same considerations noted

for half-orcs (above) apply to the orc as well.

The Barbarian and Other Classes

Barbarians can be very opinionated, so its not surprising

that they provoke strong reactions from other characters.

In most cases, though, these differences in approach art-

just hooks for good roleplaying.

The barbarian makes an excellent addition to adven-

turing parties in need of more muscle. If youre playing a

barbarian, you may find some good advice in the follow-

ing paragraphs about getting along with your fellow ad-

venturers.

Bards:  Theres  nothing  like  a  good  skald  to inspire

your battle rage or while away the downtime between ad-

ventures with songs and stories. You dont really under-

stand  his  spellcasting,  but  you  can  appreciate  it  more

than that of the wizard or sorcererafter all, the bards

magic can  heal.  Best  of  all,  though,  he  can  help  you

achieve  immortality  by  making  up  songs  and  legends

about your exploits. So what if he tends to get the party

into trouble with his boasting and tomfoolery occasion-

ally? Whats life without a little conflict?

Clerics:  You  can  certainly  appreciate  a  good  healer,

but the typical cleric spends a lot of time talking about

the afterlife and trying to convert others to his faith. You

dont worry all that much about the next lifeyou have

to focus on the here and now if you want to survive. Cler-

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

you  can  ignore  the  impressive  damage  she  can  inflict

when youre helping her flank a foe. Rogues and barbar-

ians often achieve a profound respect for  one another

that eventually deepens into genuine friendship.

Sorcerers: Heres a fellow who can fire off some very

flashy spells, but his power doesnt come from gods, or

even from books, like the wizards does. He says his spell-

casting ability is natural, and maybe thats truehe does

wield his power with an easy grace, as though it were

part of him. As long as hes honest with you about his

abilities and treats you with respect, theres no reason the

two of you cant become close friends. But if he tries to

forge an air of mystery about himself, as some sorcerers

do, hes likely to earn your antipathy instead.

Wizards: You dont understand the wizard, and you

dont trust what you dont understand. How can just read-

ing a book give her such incredible powers? For all you

know, she could be in league with some dark deity, so her

ability to toss around fireballs wont earn her any respect

from  you  until  she  takes  the  time  to  explain  how  she

does it. At that point, maybe you can move beyond your

basic mistrust of the unknown and begin to form a per-

sonal connection with her.

Choosing When to Rage

Sometimes my mind just gets in the way. Sometimes not.

Krusk

The barbarians rage is limited in both duration and fre-

quency, so the question of when to activate it is an im-

portant tactical decision. But the considerations change

as the barbarian gains levels and has more opportunities

to rage.

The low-level barbarian can rage only once or twice

per day, so he must use the ability wisely. One option is

to save his rage for the combat that he guesses to be the

big  showdown  of  the  day.  In  the  typical  dungeon,  its

often obvious when the party is facing or about to face

the toughest villain. In this case, it makes sense to rage as

soon as the battle begins. The faster the enemies can be

eliminated, the less damage they do, and the fewer party

resources  must  be  expended  in  the  battle.  Unless  the

barbarians Constitution score is especially low, his rage

should last long enough to finish even the toughest fight

ot the day.

It sometimes makes sense for a low-level barbarian to

rage when hes low on hit points. The extra hit points that

rage  grants  may  keep him  on  his  feet  long  enough  to

finish off his foe, and a rage opportunity left unused is no

good to an unconscious or dead barbarian. However, this

tactic can be problematical. The bonuses last until the

rage ends. At that point, the barbarian immediately loses

those extra hit pointsand if hes already severely in--

ics  who  follow  nature  deities  (including  nonhuman

deities such as Corellon Larethian) are another matter.

They have their feet on the ground, so to speak, even if

their heads are in the sky, and you welcome their pres-

ence. Its wise not to offend any cleric if you can help it;

you cant deny the power of deities in the world.

Druids: You get along with the druid just fine. She has

healing powers, but she doesnt proselytize the way the

typical cleric does. Maybe thats because both of you are

committed to nature, or because you share many skills,

or because she simply prefers to follow her own path.

Whatever her philosophy, the druid is the sage of your

worldher  knowledge  of  nature  outstrips  even  your

own. Although you may never adore nature the way she

does, you both walk the same trails and drink from the

same springs.

Fighters: You cant help but appreciate the company

of  a  fighter,  since  his  approach  to  life  is  so  much  like

yours. He is a staunch ally in battle and a friendly rival

outside it. The fighter has more options and tricks than

you do in combat, but youre often the more formidable

foe, especially while youre raging. In addition, you have

a wider array of skills than he does, so you have the ad-

vantage over him in wilderness exploration. None of this

hurts your friendship, though. A little competition is a

good thing, after all.

Monks: If you have an opposite number, it has to be

the monk. Your zest for life and focus on reality are dia-

metrically  opposed  to  her  philosophy  of  withdrawal

from  the  world. You  have  no  trouble  expressing  your

opinions, but shes terribly reservedshe must either be

afraid of something or be too stifled to show her feelings.

Other people claim that your approach to life and hers

are  both  valid,  but  you  think  shes  simply  wrong.  You

dont worry much about her choices, though, as long as

she doesnt try to impose them on you.

Paladins: The paladin is a welcome ally in combat, but

off the battlefield, the two of you seldom see eye-to-eye.

You hate restrictions, and she, of course, is rigidly lawful

as well as good. You tend to set aside social niceties and

get right to the heart of a situation; she wastes time with

platitudes and negotiation. Even in combat, the two of

you sometimes differ in your approaches. Whereas the

paladin considers her foes actions in a moral sense and

tries to protect the weak, you simply want to crush your

enemies and to see them driven before you. Neverthe-

less, the two of you can work together quite effectively as

long as your overall goals coincide.

Rangers: In melee, the ranger is your polar opposite.

Light and graceful, he often wields two weapons while

you typically fight with a single large one. Youre might-

ier than he is, but he dabbles in divine spells. Look past

those  superficial  differences,  though,  and  its  obvious

that the two of you have a lot in common. You share more

than a few class skills, including Wilderness Lore. You

both embrace the outdoors, and youre both uncomfort-

able in heavy armor. The ranger is better at tracking foes

than you are, but youre happy to throw in your muscle

against his favored enemies.

Rogues: Some people dislike rogues, but you can see

the advantage of having one around. Without her, youre

likely to bear the brunt of a lot more traps. And not even

7

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

jured or unconscious, he might die from that additional

loss. In fact, a barbarian who uses this tactic frequently is

more likely to end up dead after a fight than

anyone else in his party.

On the Origin

of Things

In history, druids were priests of

Celtic  tribes  in  western  Europe.

Many stories and great legends

describe these figures from our

past.  To  learn  more,  visit  your

bookstore or check a few books

out  of  your  library  and  read

about  the  druids  who  popu-

lated  history.  Good  works  to

start with include Celtic Lore by

Ward Rutherford, The Druids by

Stuart  Piggott,  and Myths and

Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early

Scandinavian and Celtic Reli-

gions by  Hilda  Roderick  Ellis

Davidson.

Keep in mind that the druids

of  the  D&D  game  are  based

more  on  fantasy  and  fiction

than  on  historical  fact.  Here,

druids  are  not  Celtic  priests,

and  they  dont  follow  the  same

beliefs,  obey  the  same  restric-

tions, or participate in the same

rites that real druids did. Druids

in  the  game  have  more  in

common  with  characters  from

Terry  Brookss Shannara series,

Marion  Zimmer  Bradleys The

Mists of Avalon, and  Morgan

Llywelyns The Druid than  with

anyone from Earths past.

As  the  barbarian  gains  levels,  deciding

when to rage becomes easier. The mid-level

barbarian,  who  can  rage  three  or  more

times per day, might want to use the ability

whenever he  faces  spellcasting  enemies.  It

grants him a +2 morale bonus on Will saves

and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves (through

increased  Constitution).  Given  that Will

saves can be something of an Achilles heel

for the  barbarian,  anything  that  minimizes

his chance  of  falling  victim  to  fear  or

mental  domination  is  a  good  thingnot

just  for  him,  but  for  everyone  in  his  party.

The  same  reasoning  applies  when  hes

facing  opponents  who  use  poison  or  a

draining ability  that  requires  a  saving

throwthe barbarian should rage to try to

prevent  any  negative  effects  he  knows  are

coming.  He  might  also  consider  raging  to

gain  the  Strength  bonus  he  needs  to  open

an  especially  stubborn  door  or  overcome  a

physical obstacle,  or  to  gain  the  saving

throw  bonuses  when  he  fears  setting  off  a

troublesome trap.

At  20th  level,  when  he  can  rage  five  or

more  times  per  day,  the  barbarian  should

simply use the ability at the start of every sig-

nificant  encounter.  Against  obviously

weaker foes, he can withhold his power just

as the wizard or spellcaster conserves spells,

but whenever the outcome is worth worry-

ing about, he should rage.

THE DRUID

IN PERSPECTIVE

Nature is by definition uncontrollable. At best you can attempt

a momentary influence, but even that is subject to the whims of

nature.

Vadania

The druids home is more spacious, and possibly more

beautiful,  than  that  of  any  other  character. Tall  oaks,

pines, and elms form the roof over her worlda canopy

more vibrant and interesting than any ceiling fresco. The

grasses and leaves provide her with a floor and a soft bed.

Where are the walls? The druid laughs, for she knows no

wallsno  boundaries  to  her  never-ending  natural

world.

Within her home or outside it, the druid is never with-

out  friends. That  wolf  hiding  in  the  grass,  the  hawk

flying  above,  and  the  mighty  bearthese  make  loyal

traveling companions as well as fearsome opponents for

uninvited guests. Should she need clever scouts to prowl

the bushes or soar through the sky in search of enemies,

or strong warriors to protect her from harm, her friends

can be at her side in a moment. If their aid isnt enough,

8

she  can  become  one  of  natures  creatures  and  either

defeat  her  foes  with  claw  and  tooth  or  take  wing  and

escape. Woe to the cretin who thinks the druid powerless

outside her wood, for even in the darkest dungeon, she is

never without friends, spells, or powers.

Unlike many adventurers, the druid is fully prepared

to go it alone. The fighter, wizard, and rogue depend on

the cleric to heal them, and the cleric depends on the

fighter to keep enemies at bay. The druid, on the other

hand,  can  defeat  her  enemies  with  fiery  spellcasting

nearly as powerful as the sorcerers, take the form of a

tiger or a lion to gain the upper hand in melee, then heal

herself when the battle is done.

Because of this versatility, the druid has much to offer

a group of adventurers. She can take on any role thats re-

quired. Need a healer for the barbarian? Can do. Need a

little more firepower to strike down foes from a distance?

No  problem.  Need  some  spells  to  make  the  party

tougher?  Sure  thing.  How  about  reasonable  combat

skills, allies that can be summoned at a moments notice,

and the ability to bring down the rain or clear away the

clouds? The druid is your choice. With all these options,

hundreds of druids can share the same world and still be

nothing alike. One may concentrate on healing, another

on the creation of magic items, another on animal com-

panions, and yet another on assuming other shapes.

Race and the Druid

Druids  can  emerge  from  any  natural  environment.

Where they are rarest is where cobbled stones and the

noisy advance  of  civilization  have replaced  a  carpet  of

leaves  and  the gentle  song  of  the lark.  Some  races  are

more likely than others to take up the druids path tor

cultural reasons, but in game terms theres no race that

makes for an especially bad druid. Since Wisdom is the

primary ability score tor the class and no race has a bonus

or penalty to this score, no obvious racial choice exists

for druid characters.

Humans: Though humans lack the special abilities of

other races, the bonus skill points and feat they gain at

1st level make them excellent candidates for the druid

class. After all, a druid who knows more of the forests se-

crets (though extra ranks in Wilderness Lore) is by defi-

nition a more powerful druid. The human druid also has

the acceptance of her peers, especially if she is from a

savage or primitive background. The one glaring human

weakness, poor night vision, is problematical for druids,

but they can eventually compensate for it through spells,

magic items, or wild shape.

Dwarves: Dwarven  druids,  as  the  Players  Handbook

notes, are rare. Since dwarves often exhibit fierce loyalty

to clan or keep, placing nature first doesnt come easily

tor most of them. Nor does it help that many dwarves

spend their lives working underground, carving up rock

and stripping precious resources from the earth. Never-

theless, a dwarf who leaves that life behind can be a for-

midable defender of nature, tough beyond measure. The

extra hit points a dwarf gets from her racial Constitution

bonus are invaluable to a druid who spends a lot of time

in battle. The druids ability to take other forms though

wild shape compensates nicely for the dwarfs slow move-

ment rate, and darkvision is a real blessing.

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

Half-Elves: Lost  and  looking  for  her  place  in  the

world, many a half-elf finds solace in serving nature. Per-

haps its a way of accepting her elven half or appeasing

elven kinor perhaps the half-elf whom society has cast

aside finds a certain appeal in the sometimes lonely path

of  the  druid. Whatever  her  reasons  for  taking  up  the

class, the half-elven druid benefits from her elven her-

itage through her improved vision. Half-elves may also

have an easier time getting along in a human-dominated

world than elves do.

Half-orcs: Its unfortunate that so few half-orcs take

up the druidic path. Like their orc parents, many half-

orcs live in wild frontiers, often far away from settled and

well-defended  towns. Those  same  frontiers  are  often

home to druids. Halt-orc characters have two significant

advantages: darkvision and a +2 racial bonus to Strength.

Moreover, although some may mock the half-orc for her

lack of intelligence and her crudeness, a druid can live

without great intelligence and charisma. Like the half-

elf, the half-orc must live with a degree of social stigma,

so she may find a solitary existence in the woods prefer-

able to dealing with those who cant accept her for what

she is. Nature, after all, embraces all living beings and

brings peace to the tormented soul.

Halflings: Halflings make good druids. Their natural

athleticism and sensitive ears are ideal tor outdoor sur-

vival,  and  their  general  good  luck  and  bravery  serve

them well too. The primary reason that so few halflings

take up the sickle and mistletoe is the strength of the

halfling community. Their predilection for comfortable

beds,  fine  food, and  ample  drink  tends  to  discourage

them from choosing more challenging lives in service to

nature. The few who do take up the druids path find that

their size is no impediment to excellence.

Monsters: Among the monstrous races, two stand out

as likely druids: centaurs and lizardfolk. Both races gen-

erally  have  tribal  societies,  and  both  live  in  harmony

with their environments. It is not uncommon in either

culture to find druids in positions of leadership.

A centaur makes an excellent druid because of her +3

racial bonus to Wisdom, her natural familiarity with the

outdoors,  and  her  skill  with horticulture.  Her  level

equivalent  is  her  class  levels  +7,  so  a  1st-level  centaur

druid would be appropriate for a 6th-level party.

Lizardfolk druids are easier to integrate with the aver-

age game than are their centaur counterpartsif noth-

ing else, its easier to take a lizardfolk than a centaur into

a dungeon. Since the lizardfolks level equivalent is her

class levels +4, a 1st-level lizardfolk druid can join a cam-

paign  when  the  average  character  level  is  only  3rd.

Unlike centaurs, lizardtolk druids have no racial adjust-

ment  to their  Wisdom  scorcs,  but  they  do  have  re-

spectable natural  attacks  at  their disposal.  As  aquatic-

creatures, theyre the only druidically inclined race that

can also breathe water.

An enterprising player might also consider the dryad

(class  levels  +4)  and  the  nymph  (class  levels  +12)  as

choices for a druid character. Both have  strong  ties  to

nature, and abilities that benefit from the addition of the

druid class.

9

Elves:  Elves  are  the  archetypal  druids,  with  good

reason. From birth, children of this race learn to love the

woodlands  and  the  natural  world  in  general.  Elven

druids  have  several  racial  advantages,  not  the  least  of

which  is  their  improved  visionlow-light  vision  and

bonuses to Spot and Search checks. Sadly, they must set

aside their racial training in the longsword, rapier, and

bow; a druid who uses any of those weapons loses all her

druid powers for 24 hours. The physical frailty of an elf

(2 penalty to Constitution) is a slight disadvantage, bur

one that most elven druids are willing to accept. Best of

all, an elven druid can return to the woodland home of

her youth and find acceptance and even honor among

her  kind.  Not  many  cultures  are  so  accepting  of  the

druid,  and  in  few  other  settlements  can she  feel  truly

comfortable.

Gnomes: Though many do not realize it, the gnomes

bond with the natural world is nearly as strong as the

elves.  Gnomes  live simply,  in wooded hills  and  warm

burrows. Unlike members of other races, they can con-

verse with burrowing creatures through an innate speak

with animals  ability. Whether  it  is  a  blessing  of  the

deities or a trick the gnomes learned over time, this abil-

ity bonds them with animals in a way that few others un-

derstand.  Add  in  the  gnomes  low-light  vision  and

natural hardiness, and the gnome druid has many of the

dwarf s physical advantages as well as the social accept-

ance  that  the  elf  enjoys. Though  her  small  size  makes

the gnome druid physically weaker than a human, wild

shape allows her to take the form of an animal with great

strength,  such  as  a  bear  or  leopard.  Humble,  playful

people that they are, gnomes make talented and stead-

fast druids.

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

The Druid and Other Classes

The druids defense of the natural world is neither short-

sighted nor provincial. She is, in some sense, a living ex-

tension of natures will. Therefore, when evil threatens

the land, shes likely to enlist in the fight, even if it takes

place far outside her grove. On other occasions, the druid

may  become  involved  in  adventures  out  of  loyalty  to

friends, or out of curiosity about some aspect of nature.

As noted above, the druid has no difficulty fitting into

most adventuring parties. If youre playing a druid, you

may find some good advice in the following paragraphs

about getting along with your fellow adventurers.

Barbarians: Though the barbarian may rush headlong

into combat, your relationship with him tends to be a

good one. Both of you have woodland skills, and while

you may not share the same view of the world, you do tra-

verse the same hills and valleys.

Bards: You can understand the traveling lifestyle of

the  bard,  but  you  dont  envy  it.  Bards  tend  to stir  up

nearly  as  much  trouble  as  rogues  do  in  their  wander-

ings, but bards at least make charming and versatile ad-

venturing companions. Their wide range of skills, their

spellcasting talent, and their combat ability make them

suitable  backups  for  nearly  any  other  character  class.

Add to that their incredible musical effects, and whats

not to like? The bard reminds you that zest for living is

a good thing, and that whatever duties you take on, life

is  a  precious  gift  that  should  be  enjoyed,  not  merely

spent.

Clerics:  You  and  the  cleric  share  many  spells  and

some similar obligations, but you certainly dont share

the same viewpoint on life. Your mind is focused on the

earth, while he  contemplates  the  heavens. This  differ-

ence  does  not  necessarily  make  for  poor  relations;

indeed,  you  and  he  can  develop  a  healthy  respect  for

one  anothers abilities and  come  up with  some highly

useful spell combinations. True friendship is rare, how-

ever, unless the cleric has chosen the Animal, Plant, or

Sun domain.

Fighters: Its always handy to have a fighter around

when  theres  trouble. Through  the  barbarian  may  be

tougher overall, the fighter is incredibly skilled in the art

of war, which means he usually knows a lot of fighting

tricks that can help his group defeat sophisticated and

powerful adversaries. On the other hand, it seems that he

devotes his entire life to combatand what sort of atti-

tude is that? Its that mindsetconcentrating on petty

squabbles  instead  of  more  important  issuesthat  en-

courages ever-increasing conflict in the world. All things

considered,  you  get  along  fine  with  the  fighter  when

your goals coincide with his, but you would rather spend

time with the ranger or the barbarian.

Monks: The monk seeks enlightenment through an

ascetic lifestyle, which ultimately amounts to a denial of

the self. To you, that seems utter folly. While there may

be  other  planes  of  existence  and  a  state  beyond  the

mortal realm, people should live in the presentin this

world. You can sympathize with that lonely figure who

came out of a monastery, but you have trouble embracing

her outlook on life. As long as shes content to let others

pursue their own paths, though, the two of you might be

able to forge a bond of friendship.

Paladins: Your relationship with the paladin is often

strained because the two of you have different outlooks

on life and devote yourselves to different goals. The two

things you have in common are a sense of moral duty

and a desire to protect something in this world. Youre

both champions of your causes, and at those times when

your  interests  overlapwhen  confronted  by  an  over-

whelming evil, for instanceyou can form an alliance

that few foes can withstand. Lasting friendship between

the two of you is rare, however.

Rangers: As might be expected, you and the ranger

get along well. You share an understanding of the natural

world,  and  though  your  means  may  vary,  you  see  the

need  for  each  other. The  one  thing  that  disturbs  you

about the ranger is his vengeful dislike of certain crea-

tures. You can understand the desire to huntthats a

natural instinctbut you dont understand the desire to

eradicate a certain type of being. Though your skills tend

to  overlap,  the  two  of  you  together with  your  animal

companions  can  greatly  increase  the  capabilities  (and

sheer numbers) of an adventuring party.

Rogues:  You  appreciate  rogues  for  their  unique  tal-

ents,  but  your  lifestyle  rarely  brings  you into  contact

with  them.  For  the  most  part,  that  suits  you  just  fine.

The  fact  that  civilized  society  considers  rogues  to  be

miscreants, thieves, and assassins doesnt concern you,

since you care little for societys strictures anyway. But

some  rogues  think  of  life  as  a  game,  and  too  many

others think of nothing but worldly goods. This leaves

you  little  in  common  with  the  partys  rogue,  though

you respect her skills.

Sorcerers: You may not fully understand the sorcerer

or  his  origin,  but  you do respect  innate  gifts. The  sor-

cerer,  through  some  quirk  of  fate  or  bloodline,  has  a

talent for magic, and unlike the wizard, he doesnt clois-

ter his body inside a moldy tower or his mind inside an

equally  moldy  tome.  Most  sorcerers  are  charismatic

people  who  dont hide  from  the  world  or  hold  them-

selves above it. Those attributes make it easy for you to

get along with them.

Wizards: Theres a place for learning and a place for

academic study. Wizards spend far too much time with

their noses in books and not enough time getting exer-

cise  in  the  fresh  air.  But  despite  their typical  lack  of

physical  prowess,  they  often  make  pleasant  compan-

ions and able adventurers, and their spells complement

yours nicely. From your perspective, the only real flaw

in the wizards magic is that she draws her power from

unnatural sources, calling in energy from places not of

this  world. Thus,  while  you  are  wise  enough  to  be-

friend the wizard in your own adventuring group, you

often take some small pleasure in fighting a villainous

wizard.

Rules Update: Using Wild Shape

They tickle and itch, but you get used to feathers. Never quite

get used to the eggs, though.

The druid Kelliana of Blue Tribe

Wild shape is one of the druids most useful and flexible

class features. The following version of this ability super-

sedes the one presented in the Players Handbook.

10

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

Strength of 20. Likewise, she cannot change into a bigger

or more powerful version of a creature (or a smaller or

weaker version).

The druid retains her own Intelligence, Wisdom, and

Charisma  scorcs,  level  and  classes,  hit  points  (despite

any change in her Constitution score), alignment, base

attack  bonus,  and  base  save  bonuses.  (New  Strength,

Dexterity,  and  Constitution  scorcs  may  affect  final

attack and save bonuses.) The druid also retains her own

type  (for  example,  humanoid),  extraordinary  abilities,

and spell-like abilities, but not her supernatural abilities.

She loses her ability to speak while in animal form be-

cause  she  is  limited  to  the  sounds  that  a  normal,  un-

trained  animal  can  make.  (The  normal  sound  a  wild

parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does

not permit speech.)

Though the druid retains any spells she previously car-

ried,  her  new  form  may  not  permit  her  to  use  them.

Unless  the  chosen  form  is  one  with  prehensile  hands

(such as a monkey or an ape) or some other manipulative

appendage, the druid may not be able to manipulate ma-

terial components and focuses for spellseven if those

are not melded into her new form. Likewise, her lack of

a  humanlike  voice  means  she  cannot  cast  spells  with

verbal components or activate command word items. In

the  same  manner,  the  lack  of  appropriate  appendages

may prevent her from using manufactured weapons and

magic items. If the usability of a particular spell or item

is in doubt, the DM makes the decision.

The druid can use this ability more times per day at

6th,  7th,  10th,  14th,  and  18th  level,  as  noted  on Table

38 in the Players Handbook. In addition, she gains the

ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a

Tiny  animal  at  11th  level,  and  a  Huge  animal  at  15th

level. At 12th level and beyond, she can take the form of

a dire animal.

At 16th level, the druid may use wild shape to change

into a Small, Medium-size, or Large elemental (air, earth,

Wild Shape

At 5th level, a druid gains the spell-like ability to turn

herself into a Small or Medium-size animal (but not a

dire animal or a legendary animal) and back again once

per day. The druid may adopt only one animal form per

use of this ability.

The  creatures  available  as  wild  shape forms  include

some giant animals (as described in Appendix I of the

Monster Manual) but not beasts, magical beasts, or any-

thing with a type other than animal. The druid may use

wild shape to become a dog or a giant lizard, for example,

but not an owlbear. The form chosen must be that of an

animal she is familiar with. For example, a druid who has

never been outside a temperate forest could not become

a polar bear.

The druid can freely designate the new forms minor

physical qualities (such as fur, feather, or skin color and

texture) within the normal ranges for an animal of that

kind. The new forms significant physical qualities (such

as height, weight, and gender) are also under her control

but must fall within the norms for the animals species.

The druid is effectively disguised as an average member

of  the new forms species, gaining a +10 bonus on her

Disguise checks as long as she maintains the form.

This change of form never disorients the druid. Upon

changing to an animal form, she regains lost hit points as

if she had rested for a day, though this healing does not

restore temporary ability damage or provide any other

benefits of resting for a day, and changing back does not

heal her further. If slain, the druid reverts to her original

form, though she remains dead.

When  the  change  occurs,  the  druids  equipment,  if

any,  melds  into  her  new  form  and  becomes  nonfunc-

tional. Material components and focuses melded in this

way cannot be used to cast spells. When the druid re-

verts  to  her  true  form,  any  objects  previously  melded

into the animal form reappear in the same locations they

previously were and are once again functional. Any new

items the druid wore in animal form (such as a saddle,

rider, or halter) fall off and land at her feet; any that she

carried in a body part common to both forms (mouth,

hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held

in the same way.

The druid acquires the physical and natural abilities of

the creature whose form she has taken while retaining

her own mind. Physical abilities include size as well as

Strength,  Dexterity,  and  Constitution  scorcs.  Natural

abilities include armor, natural weapons (such as claws,

bite, or gore), sensory abilities (such as low-light vision),

and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence

of wings or gills, number of extremities, and so forth).

Natural abilities also include mundane movement capa-

bilities,  such  as  walking,  swimming,  and  flying  with

wings. The  druid  also  gains  all  the  racial  bonuses  and

feats of the animal form selected. She does not gain any

supernatural or spell-like abilities (such as breath weap-

ons or gaze attacks) of her new form, but does gain all the

forms  extraordinary  abilities.  All  these  alterations  last

until the wild shape ends.

The druids new scorcs and faculties are average ones

for  the  species  into  which  she  has  transformed.  She

cannot,  for  example,  turn  herself  into  a  wolf  with  a

11

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

fire, or water) once per day. She gains all the elementals

special attacks and special qualities when she does so, re-

gardless of ability type (that is, she gains the supernatural

and spell-like abilities of the elemental as well as extraor-

dinary  ones).  She  also  gains  the  elementals  feats  and

racial skill bonuses for as long as she maintains the wild

shape while retaining her own creature type (humanoid

in most cases). At 18th level, she can assume elemental

form three times per day.

Choosing a Wild Shape

Beginning at 5th level, the druid gains the ability to use

wild shape. During her career, a variety of choices present

themselves as she masters larger and smaller forms, and

eventually she can assume the form of a dire animal or an

elemental. The array of options can be downright bewil-

dering.

The primary consideration in selecting an animal form

is  what  you  want  it  for.  Here  are  some  factors  a  druid

should consider when approaching this decision.

Detecting: Because the druid can use the extraordi-

nary abilities of the form chosen, she can gain blindsight

as a dire bat or a porpoise. Most animals have low-light

vision, and a few (such as the  snake and  the  owl) also

have racial Spot or Listen bonuses.

Escaping: The one of the best way to escape a trou-

bling situation through wild shape is to take to wing as a

hawk or an eagle. The fly speeds of those creatures are 80

and 60 feet respectively, and thats usually fast enough to

escape from an advancing army or a land-bound monster.

The owl, despite its popularity, doesnt fly especially fast

(only 40 feet). In a dungeon, or against some airborne

foes,  the  cheetah  or  horse  may  be  a  more  appropriate

choice. A light horse has a respectable land speed of 60

feet; the cheetah moves only 50 feet normally but can

also travel 500 feet in a sprint (see the cheetah entry in

the Monster Manual). Escape doesnt always require fast

movement,  thougha  high-level  druid  can  use wild

shape to take the form of a Tiny animal and use the Hide

skill to avoid enemies.

Fighting: Wild shape can make the druid a formidable

opponent. Until 8th level, when she can use ivild shape to

become a Large animal, her best choices are the wolver-

ine, black bear, or leopard, with three attacks each. Of

these, the black bear offers the highest Strength score

and  the  leopard  the  highest  AC. The  wolverines  rage

ability  grants  it  the  same  Strength  bonus  as  the  black

bear, plus a few additional hit points. The form of a con-

strictor  snake  might  also  prove  very  useful,  especially

against enemy spellcasters.

For an 8th-level druid, the polar bear reigns supreme

with its Strength score of 27. The heavy horse is weaker

in combat but a lot less conspicuous, if thats a concern.

The  only  other  options  worth  considering  are  the  big

catslions and tigerswhose pounce and rake abilities

are a fair trade for the polar bears higher strength. The

tiger is uniformly tougher than the lion, but both can

hold their own in combat. Finally, reach provides a sig-

nificant advantage in a fight, and the druid can gain that

in the form of a Large viper.

At 12th level, the druid can use wild shape to become a

dire animal. As a dire bear with a Strength of 31, she can

do 30 or more points of damage in a single round. The

dire lion is her second-best choice.

When  the  druid  reaches  15th  level,  the  dire  tiger

becomes  available,  but  the  dire  bear  may  still  be  a

better  decision. The  dire  tigers  Huge  size  makes  it

easier  to  hit  than  the  dire  bear,  and  the  addition  of

pounce and rake attacks may not entirely compensate

for that disadvantage.

At  16th  level,  the  druid  gains  a  significant  new

optionelemental form. This allows the druid access to

all the special abilities of the chosen elemental, includ-

ing whirlwind, drench, vortex, push, and burn. Because

of its high Strength score, the earth elemental is proba-

bly  the  best  choice,  though  the  water  elemental has  a

better AC. If AC is not a factor, however, the dire bear is

still a better fighter than any elemental simply because of

its higher strength.

Impressing  Foes:  Bears,  lions,  and  elememals  im-

press the local populace and frighten even veteran mer-

cenaries. A DM may allow a +2 circumstance bonus on

Intimidate checks for a druid using an impressive form.

Impressing Other Animals: The druid usually relies

on her Animal Empathy skill to calm hostile or hungry

animals and reassure them that violence is not necessary.

The druid who takes the time to use wild shape to assume

the target animals form often has an easier time in this

negotiation, even though she doesnt gain the ability to

speak with the creature directly. To represent this advan-

tage,  the  DM  may allow  the  druid  a  +4  circumstance

bonus  on  Animal  Empathy  checks  made  against  an

animal whose form she has assumed.

Scouting: Avian forms are good for scouting, but dont

overlook subterfuge as an option. An old story tells of a

druid who learned all her enemies plans when she as-

sumed the form of a heavy horse and served a day as the

steed for the commander of the evil army. Most people

pay little attention to horses, livestock, or passing frogs,

and the druid can profit from that.

Training Animals: The  training  process  becomes

much easier if the druid can simply assume the animals

form and demonstrate the behavior or action she wants.

The DM may allow the druid a +4 circumstance bonus on

her Handle Animal checks when she uses wild shape in

this fashion.

Traveling: Because of their good fly speeds, birds are

the obvious choices for travel. Should travel by ocean,

sea, or river be an option, the dire shark moves at an im-

pressive speed (90 feet) that even the eagle cannot match.

At 15th level and higher, the druid should seriously con-

sider the form of an air elemental for travel because of its

incredible fly speed (100 feet).

THE RANGER

IN PERSPECTIVE

You could just as easily gel a shark to give up swimming as you

could get a ranger to sfay at home.

Soveliss

Despite his association with the forest, the ranger cannot

be  described  as  rooted. Too  great  an  attachment  to

12

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

choices for favored enemy. Choosing giants first might

well pay off when that first ogre comes charging down

the dungeon corridor.

Elves: The elf is the ranger incarnate. He has bonuses

on  two  skills  for  which  the  ranger  gets  also  favored

enemy bonuses: Listen and Spot. That means a 5th-level

elven ranger gets a +4 bonus on Spot checks against his

first  favored  enemy,  on  top  of  his  skill  ranks  and  any

other bonuses he has. Most fey creatures favor elves, so

the  elven  ranger  can  create  a  strong  network  of  allies

during  his  travels  through  the  forest.  In  addition,  his

need for but 4 hours of meditation and 4 hours of rest

rather than 8 hours of sleep means he is almost always on

watch at night, when his low-light vision and high Spot

bonus are the most useful.

Gnomes: Like the dwarf, the gnome ranger starts out

with solid bonuses against some very common favored

enemies: goblinoids, kobolds, and giants. Like the elf, he

gets a racial bonus on Listen checks. Like the halfling, he

gains  bonuses on attack  rolls and AC for being  Small.

Unlike anyone else, the gnome ranger with an Intelli-

gence score of 10 or higher has both arcane spells and

divine  spells  at  4th  level,  plus  the  best  possible  base

attack bonus. All this makes the ranger class an excellent

fit for the gnome. However, gnome rangers rarely leave

their homelandsa loss to adventuring parties every-

where.

Half-Elves: The half-elf is already an outsider, so the

ranger lifestyle is second nature for him. Nearly every-

thing said above about the elf (racial bonuses on Spot and

Listen checks, low-light vision, and so on) applies to the

half-elf as well, though not always to the same degree. So-

cially, however, the half-elf is a better bridge between the

places, material possessions, and traditions is unhealthy

from his point of view. After all, change is a fundamental

aspect of nature, and it doesnt pay to fight that.

In fact, the ranger is among the most versatile of all

characters. Yes, he wears armor, but its never as clunky as

the paladins. Yes, he casts spells, but he never relies solely

on them for survival as the wizard does. Yes, he moves

like  the  breeze,  but  never  with  the  blatant  fear  of

straight-on confrontation that so many rogues display.

Though the bard claims to be a jack-of-all-trades, it is the

ranger who quietly proves himself the perfect balance of

disciplines.

The rangers versatility makes him more of a generalist

than most other characters, and that can be as much a

hindrance as a boon. He cant deal as much damage with

a  single  blow  as  a  greatsword-wielding  fighter  with

Weapon Specialization or a wizard with a maximized fire-

ball. What he can do is mete out a wild flurry of damage

from multiple sources, then retreat before his opponent

can return the favor. A ranger of moderate level might

unleash  three  unerring  arrows  in  one  round,  switch

weapons and close in the next round, then lay his oppo-

nent low with four blows from his two weapons in the

third  round.  If  that  opponent  is  a  favored  enemy,  the

second and third rounds might not even be necessary.

In many ways, the rangers greatest strength is leader-

ship.  Like  the  rogue,  he  often  scouts  ahead  of  fellow

party members, where he can make the best use of his

Track  feat  and  sense-oriented  class  skills.  Unlike  the

rogue, however, he feels physically outmatched by the

challenges that those talents reveal. As the first to spot an

enemy, he must decide whether to close or sneak back,

and his friends lives may depend on the wisdom of his

decision.

Race and the Ranger

Every  humanoid  race  has  spawned  rangers,  and  each

offers its own set of advantages. As with the druid, no ob-

vious racial choice exists for a ranger.

Humans: Most rangers are human. Dividing a human

rangers initial skill points evenly between Bluff, Listen,

Sense Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore gives the 1st-

level human ranger a +5 bonus on those checks against

favored  enemies,  in  addition  to  any  other  bonuses  he

may have. Moreover, he doesnt have to choose between

Weapon Focus and Alertness to augment his best attrib-

utes;  he  can  get  them  both  right  away.  Of  course,  the

humans biggest advantage is that he is a member of the

dominant race on the planet.

Dwarves: Like  most  of  their  race,  dwarven  rangers

tend to live underground. Such cavers need not worry

much about maintaining relations with fey creatures or

protecting the trees, but that doesnt mean they should

skimp on ranks in the Wilderness Lore skill. Its a neces-

sity  for  tracking  foes,  especially  since  dungeon  floors

count as hard ground (see the Track feat description in

the Players Handbook). The Listen skill is also vital in a

dungeon environment, and the ranger gets a bonus on

Listen  checks  against  favored  enemies. The  dwarven

rangers  racial  combat  bonuses  already  let  him  shine

against  three  categories  of  foes  (orcs,  goblinoids,  and

giants),  so  those  are  excellent  first,  second,  and  third

13

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

natural and the civilized worlds than either the elf or the

human is.

Half-orcs: Though many half-orcs consider barbarian

and fighter to be better class choices, the half-orc ranger

is a true monster against his favored enemies. A racial

bonus to Strength, the best possible attack progression,

and favored enemy bonuses mean that a 10th-level half-

orc ranger with a Strength score of 22 and Weapon Focus

(battleaxe) has a +20 attack bonus against his first favored

enemy, not including the bonus of the magic battleaxe

he has in each hand. A half-orc going this route must try

to  compensate  for his  Intelligence  penalty,  since  the

rangers  strength  lies  not  only  in  combat  but  also  in

skills. Probably the biggest disadvantage for the half-orc

ranger is that few believe he is a friend of the forest. Still,

he has his ways of persuading people.

Halflings: The  Players Handbook  notes  that  halfling

rangers arent encountered often, but thats primarily be-

cause  they  can  choose  when  encounters  occur. The

halflings Strength penalty undercuts his ranger bonuses,

but consider the 9th-level halfling ranger with Weapon

Finesse and a through-the-roof Dexterity score. Hes toss-

ing thrown weapons and wielding pairs of melee weap-

ons, as well as moving silently and hiding better than

anyone else through frequent use of the pass without trace

spell.  In  addition,  his  exceptional  bonus  on  Listen

checks lets him know that his foe is coming long before

he has to decide whether to fight or flee.

Monsters: Members of several monstrous races also

make particularly good rangers. Among these are cen-

taurs,  gnolls,  grimlocks,  sahuagin,  and  yuan-ti  (pure-

blood and halfblood).

All  these  creatures  have  racial  bonuses  to  Strength,

and  each  has  one  or  more advantages all  its  own. The

sahuagins ability to breathe water and its blood frenzy

are  significant  advantages,  though  they  are  effectively

limited to underwater environments. The yuan-ti half-

blood has several interesting optionsscales for a natu-

ral Armor Class bonus, snakes instead of arms for natural

attacks, or even a snake head with a poisonous bite. Add

to this the spell-like abilities and psionic powers that all

yuan-ti have, and either creature is a formidable foe.

The level equivalents of these creatures vary widely.

The gnolls level equivalent is class levels +3, the grim-

locks is class levels +5, the sahuagins is class levels +5,

the centaurs is class levels +7, the yuan-ti purebloods is

class  levels  +12,  and  the yuan-ti  halfbloods  is  class

levels +13.

One  final  note  about  nonhuman  rangers:  All  of  them

can select human as a favored enemy, and they should

strongly  consider  doing  so.  Humans  are  the  most  fre-

quently  encountered  toe  in  almost  every  D&D  game,

so favored enemy bonuses against them come into play

often.

The Ranger and Other Classes

The rangers single-minded pursuit of a favored enemy

often provides the impetus for a quest. For example, if

orcs occupy the hinterlands, its the ore-hunting ranger

who gets a group together to chase them out.

When  selecting  companions  for  his  missions,  the

14

ranger should consider how his skills and attitudes fit

with theirs. If youre playing a ranger, you may find some

good advice in the following paragraphs about getting

along with your fellow adventurers.

Barbarians: You  and  the  barbarian  make  a  terrific

one-two  punch,  since  you  can  both  inflict  tons  of

damage. Working together, you can also avoid nasty sur-

prisesyou watch for foes coming out of the woodwork

and he ignores sneak attacks and avoids traps. A party

with  the  pair  of  you  doesnt  have  as  much  need  for  a

rogue as one not so doubly blessed. The only issue be-

tween  you  and  the  barbarian  is that  you  may  want  to

leave combat long before he does.

Bards: The bard seems like such a dilettante. Both of

you are extraordinarily versatile, but youre versatile with

a  purpose (at  least  in  your  mind).  Nonetheless, youre

both  favorites of elves, so you tend to get along. On  a

good day, youre cool toward him (like you are to every-

one else), and hes superficial toward you (like he is to

everyone else).

Clerics:  Though  you  might  get  along  with  a druid

more  easily,  you  rarely  turn  down  an alliance  with  a

cleric. Of course, the extent of the friendship always de-

pends on his domains. A cleric with Animal, Healing,

Sun, or other domains relating to nature is always a wel-

come companion, but youre less likely to enjoy the com-

pany  of  one  who  specializes  in  Death,  Destruction,  or

Trickeryunless  of  course  youre  an  evil  ranger  who

doesnt care much about the cycle of life.

Druids: You and  the  druid  are  natural  partners,  in

both senses of the term. You appreciate guidance in the

ways of the wild, so youre willing to help out the druid

in return for some of her knowledge. Shes a better divine

spellcaster than you are, but this works for both ot you, if

you plan accordingly. You carry the standby spells such as

protection from elements  so that she can focus on healing

and controlling animals.Though your skills are similar, a

party with both of you benefits from the many animals

and  summoned  allies  you  both  tend  to  have  in  tow,

which can deliver a swarm of attacks against your toes.

Fighters: The fighter is a demonstration of everything

thats wrong with societyhes clanky, monomaniacal,

and graceless. Youre almost as good at fighting as he is

(considering that he gets bonus feats), but you have other

abilities as well. When youre in a parry with him,  the

monsters tend to consider you (with your light armor; as

the lesser of the two threatsat least until you hit four

times in a round.

Monks: The monks ascetic lifestyle is very similar to

the sort of self-exile you embrace. Both of you are nimble

and silent, and you both have the ability to make extra at-

tacks  each  round. Best  of  all,  each  of  you  respects  the

others need for solitude. You and she could live in the

same  woods  tor  years  and  never  say  a  word  to  each

otherexcept the occasional Help! When you do join

forces, you make a powerful combination.

Paladins: It the fighter is rigid and loud, the paladin is

even more so. Even if youre both of good alignment, you

may be so far apart on the law and chaos axis that you

cant have  a  civil  conversation.  Even her warhorse is a

sticking  point,  since  at  any  moment  it  can  command

your mount, and youre not about to stand for that. Still,

the two of you do have one thing in common: If some-

thing goes against your code, youre unshakable in your

fervor to set things right. When you both agree on some-

thing, its not a good idea to get in your way.

Rogues:  You  have  a  lot  in  common  with  the  party

rogue because your skill sets overlap but dont compete.

When the two of you move down a hallway together, you

can back  each  other  up  in  ways  a  paladin  and  wizard

couldnt begin to understand. You may live in different

environments, but you respect each others abilities and

attitudes.

Sorcerers: Sorcerers are what rangers would be if they

were arcane spellcastersfast, focused, and uncluttered

by  tomes  and  universities. You  and  the  sorcerer  work

well together because you can depend on him to do what

you expect and do it well.

Wizards: Wizards can be maddeningly unpredictable.

You want maximum versatility in combat, and so does

shemostly for staying out of melee. But just when you

decide to wade in for two-weapon battery, you discover

that shes targeting the area for a fireball. Still, any arcane

spellcaster is better than none, since shes bound to have

lots of useful spells.

Variant: Urban Rangers

The  Player s  Handbook  describes  rangers  as  forest

denizens  who  can  use  the  natural  camouflage  of  the

woods to advantage. Soveliss, girded in his tree-trunk-

brown studded leather, is ready at

a  moments  notice  to  disappear

among  the  trees. This  is  a  fine

lifestyle  for  the  majority  of

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

rangers, but some prefer to stalk foes through other ter-

rain. The urban ranger is the king of the streets, capable

of tracking a foe through a marketplace or across a castle

parapet.

To play an urban ranger, use the rules from the ranger

class description in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook.

Every  rule  mentioned  there  also  applies  to  an  urban

ranger. With your DMs permission, however, you can

adopt a few modifications designed to make your charac-

ter more effective in the unorthodox urban terrain.

Make  the  following  class  skill  switches:  Animal

Empathy  for  Gather  Information  and  Knowledge

(nature) for Knowledge (local). Saying goodbye to an

exclusive  class  skill  is  hard,  but  you  need  as  many

ranks in Gather Information and Knowledge (local) as

you can get.

Trade the Track feat for the Shadow feat (see Chapter

2). This  gives  you  an  edge  in  following  someone

through city streets. Also, you might want to adopt the

special  use  of  the  Hide  skill  called Tail Someone,  as

described in Chapter 2.

Take an organization or culture rather than a creature

type  as  a  favored  enemy.  For  example,  you  might

choose  the  Knights  of  the Hart, which  would allow

you to use your favored enemy bonuses against elves

and humans who belong to that organization, but not

against other elves and humans. Be sure to make such

a choice in concert with your DM, or you could end up

with a favored enemy you never encounter.

Swap out a few ranger spells for bard spells of equal

level. Here are some trades to consider: delect snares and

pits for detect secret doors, speak with animals for message,

speak  with  plants  for delect  thoughts,  plant  growth  for

phantom  steed,  and  tree  stride for  dimension  door.  You

might want to see if your DM would let you trade for

spells from different class lists as well, though youre

unlikely to get chain lightning out of the deal.

An  urban  ranger  who  wants  to  adopt  a  prestige  class

might consider the watch detective, the foe hunter, or

the bloodhound (see Chapter 5). All those focus on im-

proving the rangers best attributes without advancing

the naturalistic aspect of the class.

Choosing a Favored Enemy

Do unto others as they seek to do unto you.

Soveliss

Over the course of twenty levels, the ranger chooses five

favored enemies. Many factors can come inio play here,

including the players choice of background (I chose my

path  when  orcs devastated  my  homeland),  campaign

environment (Here in the snowy northlands, we live to

fight  the remorhaz),  and  game utility  (What  are  we

going to fight in the near future?).

Once the ranger makes a choice, he cant later change

his mind. That means the player must bet on what kind

of creatures the character is likely to meet most often.

The Dungeon Master can help with this, since he or she

knows whats out there in the campaign world.

Against his favored enemy, a ranger gets a bonus on

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore

checks as well as damage rolls with melee weapons and

with ranged weapons fired from no more than 30 feet

away. (This damage bonus does not apply against crea-

tures immune to critical hits.) The value of the bonus is

+1 when the ranger first designates that creature type as

a favored enemy, and it rises by an additional +1 at 5th,

10th, 15th, and 20th levels. He chooses his first favored

enemy at 1st level, the second at 5th level, the third at

10th, the fourth at 15th, and the fifth at 20th.

Theres  a  tradeoff  involved  in  making  these  choices

Should the rangers first favored enemy be a low-CR or a

high-CR creature? Remember, the first favored enemy

chosen is the one against which he has the highest bonus

throughout  his  career,  and  the last  is  the  one  against

which he  has  the  lowest  bonus.  Is  it  better  to  gain  an

early advantage or to forego the immediate benefit and

work toward the long term? In fact, both are perfectly

valid choices. For example, suppose you choose orcs first.

That gives your ranger a useful bonus against orcs when

hes likely to see them mostwhen hes low level. When

hes 20th level, though, he has a +5 bonus against orcs

(which he may rarely see at that point) and a lower bonus

against  the more  powerful creatures that hes likely to

meet more often. Conversely, if you choose demons as

your rangers first favored enemy, hes not likely to get

much benefit out of his bonus for a long time because he

probably wont meet many demons until he has several

levels under his belt. But when he does meet them, he

immediately has a substantial bonus against them.

Aberrations: This category is a rich choice for favored

enemy. Aberrations include beholders, carrion crawlers

driders,  gibbering  mouthers,  mimics,  mind  flayers

nagas, oryughs, rust monsters, skum, umber hulks, will-

o-wisps, and many others. Of these, skum are the lowest

powered at CR 2. Thus, if you want an early advantage

aberrations  may  not  be  a  good  first  choice.  However

theres a clump of them in the CR 68 range, and even

more beyond that, so this category is a fine choice for a

second, third, or fourth enemy. If you dont mind waiting

a while to reap the benefit, go ahead and take aberrations

as your first choice.

Animals: Animals are among the best choices for tirst

favored enemy. Your ranger should meet a lot of them at

low levels, but hell continue to meet tougher ones as he

advances. Dire animals range all the way up to CR 9 (the

dire shark).

Beasts: This  surprisingly  small  category  of  foes  in-

cludes  odd  creatures  such  as  ankhegs,  griffons, hip-

pogriffs, hydras, owlbears, purple worms, and stirges, as

well  as  dinosaurs,  rocs,  and  sea  lions. The  CRs  in this

grouping range from 1 (stirge) to 12 (purple worm), so

beasts are a good choice for a rangers tirst, second, or

maybe even third favored enemy.

Constructs: These creatures are immune to critical

hits (and  thus  to  the  rangers  favored  enemy  damage

bonus), so this is a suboptimal choice unless youre using

the variant favored enemy rules, below. Bluff and Sense

Motive  are useless against constructs. The  bonuses  on

Spot. Listen, and Wilderness Lore checks still apply, but

since  constructs  frequently just  sit  in  place until  dis-

turbed. these benefits arent much help either.

Dragons: This category is a great choice at any level. A

ranger can meet a wyrmling white dragon right out of

the gate and still be fighting dragons when he reaches

20th level. This is one of the few categories that scales up

as the ranger advances, since dragons advance as well.

16

The bonus is also effective against dragon turtles, half-

dragons,  pseudodragons,  wyverns,  and  anything  else

with the dragon type. Pay special attention to those Bluff

and Sense Motive bonusesoften the best way to deal

with  a  dragon  is  by  skillfully  playing  on  its  desire  for

treasure and fame.

Elementals:  Unless  you  use  the  variant  favored

enemy rules below, your favored enemy damage bonuses

dont work against elementals because they are immune

to critical hits. The other bonuses still apply, but what

good  is  a  Spot  or  Listen  check  against  a  creature  that

anyone can see and hear from a quarter-mile away?

Fey:  This  category  is  an  excellent  choice  for  evil

rangers, but good rangers tend to ally with these crea-

tures rather than fight them. Dryads, nymphs, satyrs, and

sprites fall into this grouping. Nymphs are the toughest

at CR 6, so if youre going to take fey as a favored enemy,

you might want to do so early.

Giants:  Giants  make  great  favored  enemies  for

dwarves and gnomes, who already have racial bonuses

against them. In addition to the six giants, this category

includes ettins, ogres, ogre mages, and trolls. Since your

ranger is likely to meet ogres early in his career, consider

giants  as  a  first  or  second  favored  enemy  choice. That

way, when he meets storm giants later on, hell have a sig-

nificant bonus against them.

Humanoids: This category requires the  choice of a

specific humanoid subtype, but only an evil ranger can

choose his own subtype. Some choices here are better

than others.

Humans: This is easily the best choice in the game for

everyone  except the  nonevil  human  ranger,  who  cant

select  it.  In  almost  any  D&D  game,  player  characters

must fight many human foes. Even a ranger allied with

humans should consider taking this option early.

Dwarves,  Elves,  Gnomes,  Haflings:  All  four  of  these

choices  are  much  more  limited  than  humans.  If  you

think your ranger would be surprised to find a tyrannical

halfling  warlord  trampling  life  and  liberty  across  the

campaign world, avoid these groups.

Orcs:  This  is  an  excellent  choice  for  dwarves  (who

already  get  a  +1  bonus  on  attacks  against  orcs)  and  a

pretty good choice for others as well. Since the bonuses

work against both orcs and half-orcs, this can be a good

option to take early, when your ranger is fighting orcs

and their leaders in abundance. And even though hes

not as likely to meet orcs at higher levels, he may still

have to deal with the occasional orc army or high-level

half-orc NPC.

Gnolls: This is not as versatile a choice as orcs in most

campaigns. The typical ranger is less likely to meet ad-

vanced gnolls than advanced half-orcs as he rises in level.

Goblinoids: This  is  a  fine  choice,  particularly  at  low

levels. A dwarven or gnome ranger already has a +1 racial

bonus on attack rolls against these creatures and is likely

to fight them for living space regularly. This category also

includes bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins (CR 2, 1/4,

and 1/2, respectively). Its a good choice for first favored

enemy, but it isnt too useful later.

Reptilians: This  is  a  surprisingly  good  choice  for  a

gnome ranger, who already has a +1 bonus on attack rolls

against kobolds. Lizardfolk and troglodytes are also rep-

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

tilians.  Again,  this  is  a  good  choice  for  a  first  favored

enemy but less useful thereafter.

Aquatic: Speaking of lizardfolk, this category includes

that race as well as locathah, merfolk, and sahuagin. If

you expect your ranger to go to sea a lot, consider this

option for his first or second favored enemy.

Magical  Beasts: In  a  campaign  with  lots  of  bizarre

creatures,  you  probably  cant  do  better  for  a  favored

enemy than this. The list is enormous, and it includes

most  of  the  traditional  D&D  foes,  such  as  basilisks,

chimeras, cockatrices, displacer beasts, krakens, manti-

cores, phase spiders, remorhazes, ropers, sphinxes, and

the tarrasque. Theres at least one magical beast at every

CR  from  1  to  15,  so  your  ranger  gains  value  from  the

choice at every level. Moreover, he gains bonuses against

all the celestial and fiendish creatures summoned by his

arcane foes. Consider taking magical beasts as a first or

second favored enemy.

Monstrous Humanoids: This category includes such

creatures as centaurs, grim locks, hags, harpies, kuo-toa,

medusas,  minotaurs,  and  yuan-ti.  Since  there  is  little

commonality  about  where  and  when  a  ranger  might

meet these creatures, it is a very versatile option. All the

creatures noted above are CR 7 or lower, so this category

is a decent choice for a second or third favored enemy.

Oozes: These mindless, formless creatures arent sub-

ject to critical hits, so favored enemy damage bonuses

dont work against them unless youre using the variant

rules below. You wont get bonuses on damage rolls, Bluff

checks, or Sense Motive checks, and you probably wont

hear them coming. Still, a high Spot bonus is very help-

ful against a gelatinous cube.

Outsiders: This category is among the few appropriate

choices for a rangers fifth favored enemy, but since you

must choose a specific kind of outsider, you have to guess

what sort your ranger is likely to fight. The list of options

includes nearly all creatures native to planes other than the

Material Plane. Of these, only celestials, demons, devils,

formians, and slaadi have enough CR variation to justify

them as good choices over the long hauland of those,

only demons and devils are commonly encountered foes.

See the variant rules below for another way to approach

rangers favored enemy bonuses against outsiders.

Plants: Theres something quite odd about the concept

of hunting plants. Theyre immune to critical hits and

thus to favored enemy damage bonuses, and Bluff and

Sense Motive checks are generally useless against them.

In addition, most of them dont move enough for your

bonuses  on  Listen  and  Wilderness  Lore  checks  to  be

useful. A Spot bonus might be nice, but you gain much

more  utility  out  of  choosing  another  favored  enemy

unless you use the variant favored enemy rules below.

Shapechangers:  Even  though  only  a  few  creatures

have this type, lycanthropes alone have enough variation

to make this category an excellent choice. A lycanthrope

can have any CR above 1, so a ranger can benefit from

this choice at any time in his career.

Undead: When your ranger runs into skeletons and

zombies  in  his  first  few  adventures,  you  might  be

tempted to choose undead as a favored enemy. Resist the

temptation. All undead are immune to critical hits and

mind-influencing effects, and some are also incorporeal,

17

CHAPTER  1:  NATURES  LORE

so they dont make noise. Thus, favored enemy bonuses

are all but useless against undead unless youre using the

variant rules below.

Vermin: This category is a moderately good choice. A

lot of monstrous spiders and centipedes live out there,

and  even  though  your  ranger  wont  be  bluffing  them,

every bit of extra damage helps.

Variant Favored Enemy Rules

Some favored enemy choices have significantly less util-

ity than othersnamely outsiders and those types that

are immune to critical hits. The variant rules presented

here make these choices more appealing. As with all vari-

ant rules, a player wishing to utilize these must

first get the DMs consent.

Variant Intimidation

Rules

Its an unfortunate fact that the

barbarian,  regardless  of  his

might, can still fail to intimidate

foes who are cowed by the styl-

ish  bard  or  the  magnetic  sor-

cerer.  The  two  optional  rules

presented here are designed to

make the barbarian a bit more

frightening.  These  rules  work

whether the barbarian is raging

or  not,  though  rage  does  in-

crease their effectiveness.

Raging Intimidation:

Intimidation  is  usually  a  func-

allows  the  barbarian  to  apply

his  Strength  modifier  rather

than  his  Charisma  modifier  to

Intimidate  checks.  This  as-

sumes,  of  course,  that  he  ac-

companies such attempts with

appropriate  displays  of  might,

such  as  breaking  objects  or

showing  off  impressive  mus-

cles. A barbarian who is raging

is  even  better  at  intimidation

increased

because  of  his

Strength score.

18

Favoring Subtypes of Outsiders: In this

variant, the ranger can choose a subtype of out-

sider as a favored enemy. The available options

are air, chaotic, earth,  evil,  fire,  good,  lawful,

water, and no subtype. A ranger who chooses

chaotic  outsiders, for example, gains favored

enemy bonuses against chaos beasts, demons,

djinn,  ghaeles  (a  type  of  celestial),  lillends,

slaadi,  and  titans,  whereas  one  who  chooses

outsiders  with  no  subtype  gains  bonuses

against  aasimars,  half-celestials,  half-fiends,

jann,  ravids,  and  tieflings. When  choosing

among  these  options,  consider  your  rangers

alignment and the conditions in which he nor-

mally adventures.

Favoring Subraces of Your Own Race: A

good or neutral ranger cannot select his own

race as a favored enemy, but his enemies can,

which is disconcerting. In this variant, a ranger

can select a subrace of his own race as a favored

enemy. Generally, the  DM  should  allow  this

only  when  it  corresponds  to  deep  divisions

within that race. For example, a high elf could

select drow, but not gray elves. Similarly, hill

dwarves might select derro or duergar, but not

deep  dwarves.  Half-orcs  (especially  if  raised

among humans) could choose orcs. This vari-

ant also allows the ranger to choose others of

his own race who come from a hostile country

as a favored enemy.

Defensive  Favored  Enemy  Bonuses:  A

ranger  using  this  variant  gains  his  favored

enemy bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks

instead of on damage, Bluff checks, and Sense

Motive  checks  against  a  particular  favored

enemy.  Also,  he  can  use  his  favored  enemy

bonus as a dodge bonus as if using the Dodge

feat. (That is, each round he must designate one

favored enemy opponent against whom the AC

bonus applies, and he gains no bonus when flat-

footed.) The ranger retains his other bonuses on

Listen, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks. Once

you choose this option for a particular favored enemy, you

may not reverse the decision. This variant is recommended

for  rangers  who  choose  constructs,  elementals,  oozes,

plants, or undead as favored enemies, though other mem-

bers of the class may find it useful as well.

FEATS

A town criers description of Krusk

The first section of this chapter details new ways of using

some  of  the  skills  listed  in  the  Players  Handbook. The

second section presents a number of new feats designed

with barbarians, druids, and rangers in mindthough,

of course, any character who qualifies can take them.

NEW WAYS TO USE SKILLS

New ways to use the Handle Animal, Hide, and Wilder-

ness  Lore  skills  are  discussed  below,  as  well as variant

rules for using the Intimidate skill.

Handle Animal

Once you have befriended an animal, you might want to

train it before taking it into dangerous adventuring situa-

tions with you. Teaching an animal a trick requires two

months and a successful Handle Animal check (DC 15). If

the creature is your animal companion, a +2 circumstance

bonus applies to the check. This represents the animals

unusual degree of loyalty and willingness to cooperate.

New Tricks

See the Animal Companions sidebar in Chapter 2 of the

DUNGEON MASTERS Guide for the basic list of tricks animals

can learn. Several additional tricks are detailed below.

Armor: The animal is willing to accept the burden of |

armor.

Assist Attack: The animal aids your attack or that of an-

other creature as a standard action. You must designate

both the recipient of the aid and a specific opponent. The

animal makes one attack roll per round it is assisting. If

it hits AC 10, the creature it is aiding gains a +2 circum-

stance bonus on attack rolls against the designated oppo-

nent until the animals next turn.

Assist Defend: The animal aids your defense or that of

another creature as a standard action. You must designate

both the recipient of the aid and a specific opponent. The

animal makes one attack roll per round it is assisting. If

it hits AC 10, the creature it is aiding gains a +2 circum-

stance  bonus  to  AC  against  the  designated  opponent

until the animals next turn.

Assist Track: The animal aids your attempt to track. If its

Wilderness Lore check (DC 10) succeeds, you gain a +2

circumstance  bonus  on Wilderness  Lore  checks made

for tracking.

Calm: This trick lets an animal deal with dungeon en-

vironments. It becomes willing to move through or rest

quietly in darkness, to skirt ledges around pits, and to

climb up slanted passages and staircases. When the situ-

ation requires it, the animal even allows itself to be har-

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

nessed for travel over vertical surfaces.

Hold:  The  animal  initiates  a  grapple  attack  and  at-

tempts to hold a designated enemy in its arms, claws, or

teeth. An animal with the improved grab ability uses that

in the attempt; otherwise, the attack provokes an attack

of opportunity.

Home: The animal returns to a preset location, travel-

ing overland as required.

Hunt: The animal attempts to hunt food for you (and

any others you designate) and bring it back through the

use of Wilderness Lore. While an animal automatically

knows how to hunt for its own needs, this trick causes it

to return with food rather than simply eating its fill of

what it finds.

Subdue: The animal attacks a designated target creature

to subdue it, suffering a 4 penalty on its attack roll. The

attack trick (above) is a prerequisite for this one.

Stalk: The animal follows a designated target, doing its

best to remain undetected, until the target is wounded or

resting, and then attacks.

Steal:  In  this  variation  on  the  fetch  command,  the

animal  grabs  an  object  in  the  possession  of  a  target

creature, wrests it away, and brings it to you. If multi-

ple objects are available, the animal attempts to steal a

random one.

Hide

The Hide skill is as useful in the wild as it is in a city.

Sometimes,  however,  rangers  and  druids  must  adapt

their skills to city situations (see Urban Ranger, in Chap-

ter 1). This section describes how to use the Hide skill to

track someone surreptitiously.

Tail Someone

Since the Hide skill allows for movement, you can use it

as a move-equivalent action or part of a move action if de-

sired. This means you can try to follow someone while

making  periodic Hide checks  to remain  unseen.  How

often you need to make a Hide check depends on the dis-

tance at which you follow. If you stay at least 60 feet away

from your quarry, you can get by with a Hide check once

every 10 minutes, provided that your quarry doesnt sus-

pect youre following and that you do nothing but main-

tain the tail. At distances of less than 60 feet, you must

make a Hide check each round.

Of course, you still need appropriate concealment to

succeed at Hide checks while tailing, but many options

are often available. In a forest, of course, there are plenty of

convenient trees to hide behind. If youre trying to tail

someone  on  a  city  street,  you  can  duck  behind

passersbythough in that case, you wouldnt be hidden

from the people youre using for cover, just from your

quarry. If the street is fairly crowded, using passersby as

concealment imposes no penalty on your Hide check,

though you might still suffer a penalty for your movement

(see the Hide skill description in the Players Handbook).

If you dont have moving people to hide behind, you

can instead move from one hiding place to another as

19

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

you follow your quarry.  Distance is a factor,  though

this option works only as long as your next hiding place

is within 1 foot per Hide rank you possess of your cur-

rent one. (If you have a magic item that helps you hide,

such as a cloak of elevenkind or a robe of blending, add 1 foot

to that limit per point of Hide bonus it provides.) If you

try  to  move  any  greater  distance  than  that  between

hiding  places,  your  quarry  spots  you.  A  movement

penalty may apply to your Hide check if you dash from

one  hiding  place  to  the  next  at  more  than  half  your

normal speed.

Even if you fail a Hide check while tailing someone or

are spotted while moving too great a distance between

hiding places, you can attempt a Bluff check opposed by

your quarrys Sense Motive check to look innocuous. Suc-

cess means your quarry sees you but doesnt realize youre

tailing; failure alerts him or her that youre actually follow-

ing. A modifier may apply to the Sense Motive check, de-

pending on how suspicious your quarry is. The table below

gives Sense Motive modifiers for particular situations.

Wilderness Lore

The  description  of  the Track  feat  in  the Players  Hand-

book notes  that  with  a  successful  Wilderness  Lore

check,  you  can  track  someone  for  a  mile  or  until  the

tracks become hard to follow. But what if youre follow-

ing someone who really knows how to hide a  trail? In

that case, the quarry may make a Wilderness Lore check

to hide his or her trail. This is opposed by your Wilder-

ness Lore  check for tracking. The  DC  modifiers  listed

in  the Track  feat  description  in  the  Players  Handbook

apply to the quarrys check.

FEATS

Feats  provide  characters  with  new  capabilities  or  im-

prove  those  that  the  heroes  already  have. This  section

offers  a  variety  of  new  feats  designed  specifically  for

barbarians,  druids,  and  rangersthough,  of  course,

any  character  who  qualifies  can  take  them.  Many  of

these  new  feats  have  at  least  one  prerequisite,  such  as

a  minimum  ability  score  or  base  attack  bonus.  Aster-

isked  feats  on Table  21  are available  as  fighter  bonus

feats.

Virtual Feats

If  a  character  has  a  class  feature  or  special  ability  that

exactly  duplicates  the  effects  of  a  feat,  then  he  or  she

can  use  that  virtual  feat  as  a  prerequisite  for  other

feats,  as  well  as  prestige  classes,  and  so  forth.  For  ex-

ample, a ranger can fight with two weapons as if he had

the  feats  Ambidexterity  and Two-Weapon  Fighting,  so

he is considered to have those feats for the purpose of

acquiring  the  Greater Two-Weapon  Fighting  feat  de-

tailed in this section. If the character ever loses the vir-

tual prerequisite, he or she also loses access to any feats

or other benefits acquired through its existence. For ex-

ample,  a  ranger  who  wears  armor  heavier  than  light

loses access to the virtual feats noted above, and thereby

to  Greater Two-Weapon  Fighting  as  well.  Acquiring  a

virtual  feat  does  not  give  a  character  access  to  its  pre-

requisites.

Wild Feats

The feats in this new category relate to the wild shape abil-

ity, and all require it as a prerequisite. Any class feature or

ability that has the words wild shape in its name (such as

lesser wild shape, greater wild shape, and undead wild shape;

see Chapter 5) counts as wild shape for meeting prerequi-

sites. Wild feats apply to any version of wild shape.

Animal Control [General]

You  can  channel  the  power  of  nature  to  gain  mastery

over animal creatures.

Prerequisites: Animal Defiance, ability to cast speak

with animals and animal friendship.

Benefit: You can rebuke or command animals as an

evil cleric rebukes undead. To command an animal, you

must  be  able  to  speak  with  it via  a speak with  animals

effect, though you may issue your commands mentally if

desired. The number of times per day that you can use

this ability is equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Your

highest  divine  caster  level  is  the  level  at  which  you

rebuke animals.

Special: Animals you command through this

ability count against the HD limit of animals

you can befriend through animal friendship.

Animal Defiance [General]

You can channel the power of nature to drive

off animals.

Prerequisite: Ability to cast detect animals

or plants.

Blindsight [Wild]

Your senses are as keen as the bats.

Prerequisite: Ability  to  use wild  shape  to  become  a

dire bat.

Benefit: You gain the extraordinary ability blindsight

(as  described  in Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON  MASTERS

GUIDE), which operates regardless ot your form. Like the

dire bat, you emit high-frequency sounds, inaudible to

most  creatures,  as  a  lorm  of  sonar  that  allows you  to

locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. Since this

ability relies on hearing, any circumstance that deprives

you of that sense also negates your blindsight.

Brachiation [General]

You move through trees like a monkey.

Prerequisites: Climb 6 ranks. Jump 6 ranks. Str 13.

Benefit: You move through trees at your normal land

speed by using your arms to swing from one branch to

another. To  allow brachiation,  the  area through  which

you are  moving  must  be  at least  lightly  wooded,  with

trees no farther apart than 15 feet. You may not use this

ability while holding an item in either hand, or while

wearing armor heavier than medium.

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

Create Infusion [Item Creation]

You store a divine spell within a specially prepared herb

(see Chapter 3 for details on infusions).

Prerequisites:  Wilderness  Lore 4  ranks,  spellcaster

level 3rd.

Benefit:  You  create  an  infusion  of  any  divine  spell

available to you. Infusing an herb with a spell takes one

day. When you create an infusion, you set the caster level,

which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question but

not higher than your own level. The base price of an in-

fusion is its spell level times its caster level times 50 gp.

To create an infusion, you must spend 1/25 of this base

price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half

this base price.

Any infusion that storcs a spell with a costly material

component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate

cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price,

you must also expend the material component or pay the

XP when creating the infusion.

Clever Wrestling [General]

You have a better than normal chance to escape or wrig-

gle free from a big creatures grapple or pin.

pends on your opponents size, according to the follow-

ing table.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +5, at least one fa-

vored enemy.

(see Table  314  in  the Players  Handbook) beyond  your

normal  allotment.  Initially,  you  gain  the  standard  +1

bonus on damage and the usual skill checks against this

new favored enemy. When you advance beyond the level

at which you gained Extra Favored Enemy, this bonus in-

creases in the same way other favored enemy bonuses do.

For example, suppose you select goblinoids as your first

favored enemy when you are a 1st-level ranger and mag-

ical beasts as your second when you reach 5th level. Then

you take Extra Favored Enemy as your feat at 6th level

and select aberrations. At this point, you have a +2 bonus

against goblinoids and a +1 bonus against both magical

beasts and aberrations. When you reach 10th level, your

bonuses rise to +3 against goblinoids and +2 against mag-

ical beasts and aberrations.

Favored Critical [General]

You  know  how  to  hit  your  favored  enemies  where  it

hurts.

Prerequisites:  Base attack bonus +5, at least one fa-

vored enemy.

Benefit: Select  one  of  your  favored  enemies  that  is

normally  subject  to  critical  hits. Whenever you  attack

this  type  of  creature,  the  threat  range  of  whatever

weapon you are using is doubled. For example, a long-

sword usually threatens a critical hit on a die roll of 19 or

20 (two numbers). In the hands of a character with Fa-

vored Critical using it against a favored enemy, its threat

range becomes 17 through 20 (four numbers). If it is also

a keen longsword, its threat range becomes 15 through 20

(six  numbers:  2  for  being  a  longsword,  2  for  being

doubled as a keen weapon, and 2 for being doubled again

by Favored Critical).

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each

lime  you  do,  it  applies  to  a  new  favored  enemy. The

effects ot this feat do not stack with those of Improved

Critical.

Flyby Attack [General]

You attack while on the wing.

Prerequisites:  Ability  to  fly,  either  naturally  or

through shapechanging.

Benefit: When flying, you take a move action (includ-

ing a dive) plus another partial action at any point during

that move. You cannot take a second move action during

a round in which you make a flyby attack. You can use

this feat only while you are in a form that allows natural

flight;  it  cannot  be  used  in  conjunction  with  magical

flight (such as a fly spell).

Normal:  Without  this  feat,  you  can  take  a  partial

action either before or after your move.

Giant(cid:146)s Toughness [General]

You are amazingly tough.

Prerequisite: Base Fort save bonus +8.

Benefit: You gain +9 hit points.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.

Greater Resiliency [General]

Your extraordinary resilience to damage increases.

Prerequisite: Damage reduction as a class feature or

innate ability.

Benefit: Your damage reduction increases by +1/. If

it would normally rise thereafter with level, it does so at

its previous rate. For example, a 15th-level barbarian has

damage reduction 2/. By taking this feat, he raises it to

3/. Thereafter, it continues to rise by +1/ at the desig-

nated intervals: to 4/ at 17th level, and to 5/ at 20th

level. You may not take this feat more than once.

Greater Two-Weapon Fighting

[General]

You are a master at fighting two-handed.

Prerequisites: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-

Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity, base attack bonus +15.

Benefit: You  get  a  third  attack  with  your  off-hand

weapon, albeit at a 10 penalty.

Improved Flight [General]

You gain greater maneuverability when flying than you

would normally have.

Prerequisite: Ability  to  fly  (naturally,  magically,  or

through shapechanging).

Benefit: Your maneuverability while flying improves

by one grade. For example, if your normal maneuverabil-

ity is poor, it becomes average.

Improved Swimming [General]

You swim faster than you normally could.

Prerequisite: Swim 6 ranks.

Benefit: You swim at one-half of your land speed as a

move-equivalent action or at three-quarters of your land

speed as a full-round action.

Normal: You swim at one-quarter of your land speed

as a move-equivalent action or at one-half of your land

speed as a full-round action.

Instantaneous Rage [General]

You activate your rage instantly.

Prerequisite: Ability to rage.

Benefit: Your rage begins at any time you wish, even

when its not your turn or when youre surprised. You can

activate your rage in response to anothers action after

learning the result but before it takes effect. Thus, you

can gain the benefits of rage in time to prevent or ame-

liorate an undesirable event. For example, you can gain

the  additional hit  points  that  rage  grants  just  before a

blow that would otherwise cause you to tall unconscious,

23

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

or  better  your  chances  of  making  a  successful  saving

throw against an incoming spell.

Normal: You enter a rage only during your turn.

Intimidating Rage [General]

Your rage engenders fear in your opponents.

Prerequisites: Ability to rage.

Benefit: While you are raging, you designate a single

foe within 30 feet of you who must make a Will save (DC

=  10  +  one-half  your  character  level  +  your  Charisma

modifier) or become shaken for as long as you continue

to rage and the target can see you. (A shaken creature suf-

fers  a  2  morale  penalty  on  attack  rolls,  saves,  and

checks.) A target who makes the save remains immune

to the intimidating effect of your rage for one day. Crea-

tures immune to fear and those with no visual senses are

immune to this effect.

Multiattack [General]

You are adept at using all your natural weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Access to a form that has three or more

natural  weapons,  either  naturally  or  through

shapechanging.

Benefit: Your secondary attacks with natural weapons

suffer only a 2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, your secondary natural at-

tacks suffer a 5 penalty.

Multidexterity [General]

You are skilled at utilizing all your hands in combat.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, access to a form with three or

more arms.

Benefit:  You  ignore  all  penalties  for  using  your  off

hands.  (A  creature  has  one  primary  hand,  and  all  the

others are off hands; for example, a four-armed creature

has one primary hand and three off hands.)

Normal: Without  this  feat,  a  creature  suffers  a  4

penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks

made with an offhand.

Special: This feat is the same as the Ambidexterity feat

for creatures with three or more arms.

Natural Spell [Wild]

You cast spells while in a wild shape.

Prerequisite: Ability to use wild shape, Wis 13.

Benefit: You complete the verbal and somatic com-

ponents  of  spells  while  in  a  wild  shape.  For  example,

while  in  the  form  of  a  hawk,  you  could  substitute

screeches and gestures with your talons for the normal

verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can use

any material components or focuses that you can hold

with  an  appendage  of  your  current  form,  but  you

cannot  make  use  of  any  such  items that  are  melded

within that form. This feat does not permit the use of

magic items while in a form that could not ordinarily

use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while

in a wild shape.

24

Off-Hand Parry [General]

You use your off-hand weapon to defend against melee

attacks.

Prerequisites: Ambidexterity,  Dex 13, Two-Weapon

Fighting, base attack bonus +3, proficiency with weapon

Benefit: When fighting with two weapons and using

the full attack option, you can on your action decide to

attack normally or to sacrifice all your off-hand attacks

for that round in exchange for a +2 dodge bonus to your

AC. If you take this option, you also suffer penalties on

your attacks as if you were fighting with two weapons. If

you are also using a buckler, its AC bonus stacks with

the  dodge  bonus. You  can  use  only  bladed  or  hafted

weapons of a size category smaller than your own with

this fear.

Plant Control [General]

You channel the  power of nature to gain mastery  ovei

plant creatures.

Prerequisites:  Plant  Defiance, ability  to  cast speak

with plants.

Benefit: You  rebuke  or  command  plants  as  an  evil

cleric rebukes undead. To command a plant, you must be

able to speak with it via a speak with plants effect, though

you may issue your commands mentally if desired. The

number of times per day that you can use this ability is

equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Your highest divine

caster level is the level at which you rebuke plants.

Plant Defiance [General]

You channel the power of nature to drive off plant crea-

tures.

Prerequisite: Ability to cast detect animals or plants.

Benefit: You turn (but not destroy) plants as a good

cleric  turns  undead. Treat  immobile  plant creatures as

creatures unable to flee. The  number of times per day

that you can use this ability is equal to 3 + your Charisma

modifier. Your highest divine caster level is the level at

which you turn plants.

Power Critical [General]

Choose one weapon, such as a longsword or a greataxe.

With that weapon, you know how to hit where it hurts.

Prerequisites: Improved Critical with weapon, base

attack bonus +12, proficiency with weapon.

Benefit: Once per day, you can declare a single melee

attack with your chosen kind of weapon to be an auto-

matic threat before you make the attack roll. If the attack

is successful, you roll to confirm the critical, regardless of

whether the actual attack roll was a threat.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each

time you do, it applies to a new kind of weapon. You may

use this ability only once per day per kind of weapon to

which it applies.

Proportionate Wild Shape [Wild]

You use wild shape to become animals of your own size,

even if your wild shape ability would normally exclude

that size category.

Prerequisites: Ability to use wild shape, natural form

neither Small or Medium-size.

Benefit:  You  use  your  wild  shape  ability  to  take  the

form of an animal whose normal size category matches

your own. For example, a cloud giant druid (size Huge)

with this  feat  could  use wild  shape to  become  a  Huge

shark or a giant squid.

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

yourself,  you  automatically  deal  bite  damage  each

round, or if you do not move and take no other action in

combat,  you  deal  double  bite  damage  to  the  snatched

creature.

As  a  free  action,  you  can  drop  a  creature  you  have

snatched,  or  you  can  use  a  standard  action  to  fling  it

aside.  A  flung  creature  travels  10  feet  (and  takes  1d6

points  of  damage)  for  each  size  category  greater  than

Small that you are. If you fling a creature while you are

flying,  it  suffers  cither  flinging  or  falling  damage,

whichever is greater.

Speaking Wild Shape [Wild]

While in wild shape, you can communicate with animals

or elementals of the same kind as your current form.

Prerequisites: Ability to use wild shape, Int 13.

Benefit: While in a wild shape, you operate as if you

were under a continuous speak with animals effect with

respect to animals of the same kind. For example, if you

use wild shape to take the form of a wolf, you can com-

municate with wolves as long as you are in that form.

You  speak  in  growls,  squawks,  chitters,  or  whatever

other  sounds  such  an  animal  would  typically  use  to

communicate with others of its kind, if you are able to

use wild shape to become an elemental, you can also com-

municate with elementals of the same kind as yourself,

using their language. This feat does not enable mental

communication.

Supernatural Blow [General]

Choose  one  favored  enemy  that  is  immune  to  critical

hits. You know how to place blows against this opponent

for best effect.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +7, favored enemy

immune to critical hits.

Benefit:  Whenever  your  attack  roll  against  this  fa-

vored enemy would otherwise be a critical hit, you inflict

+1d6 points of extra damage per damage die that your

weapon would do on a critical hit. In addition, your fa-

vored enemy damage bonus applies to this creature type

normally.

Normal: Creatures that are immune to critical hits are

also immune to the favored enemy damage bonus.

Wingover [General]

You change direction quickly once per round while air-

borne.

Prerequisite: Ability to fly.

Benefit: This feat allows you to turn at an angle of up

to 180 degrees in addition to any other turns you are nor-

mally allowed, regardless of your maneuverability. You

cannot  gain  altitude  during  the  round  you  execute  a

wingover, but you can dive. For more information, see

Tactical Aerial Movement in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide.

Normal: The size of the animal form you can assume

through wild shape is limited by the parameters of the

ability, regardless of your original size.

Remain Conscious [General]

You have a tenacity of will that supports you even when

things look bleak.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +2, Endurance, Iron

Will, Toughness.

Benefit:  After  your  hit  points  are  reduced  to  0  or

below,  you  may  take  one  partial  action  on  your  turn

every round until you reach 10 hit points.

Resist Disease [General]

You have developed a natural resistance to diseases.

Benefit:  You  gain  a  +4  bonus  on  Fortitude  saves

against disease.

Resist Poison [General]

You have built up an immunity to the effects of poisons

by exposing yourself to controlled doses of them.

Benefit:  You  gain  a  +4  bonus  on  Fortitude  saves

against poison.

Resistance to Energy [General]

You  channel  the  power  of  nature  to  resist  a  particular

energy type (fire, cold, electricity, acid, or sonic).

Prerequisites: Base Fort save bonus +8.

Benefit: Choose an energy form. You gain resistance 5

against that type of energy. For example, if you choose

fire, you ignore the first 5 points of fire damage you take

each  round,  regardless  of  whether  that  damage  stems

from a mundane or a magical source.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times. If you

choose  the  same  energy  form  two  or  more  times,  the

effects stack. This resistance does not stack with that pro-

vided by any spell or magic item.

Scent [Wild]

Your olfactory senses are as sharp as the wolf s.

Prerequisites: Ability to use wild shape to become a

wolf. Wis 11.

Benefit: You gain the scent extraordinary ability (air-

breathers type, as described in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide), which operates regardless of your form.

Shadow [General]

You have a better chance than most to trail someone un-

noticed.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Hide and Spot checks.

Snatch [General]

You can grapple more easily with your claws or bite.

Prerequisite:  Access to a form with either claws or

bite as natural weapons.

Benefit: if you hit with a claw or bite attack, you au-

tomatically  attempt  to  start  a  grapple  as  a  free  action

without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you get a

hold with a claw on a creature four or more size cate-

gories smaller than yourself, you squeeze each round for

automatic claw damage. If you get a hold with your bite

on a creature three or more size categories smaller than

Every adventurer depends on equipment. Without arms,

armor, and other equipment, both magical and mundane,

a hero cant defeat enemies, mount a proper defense, or

overcome the obstacles presented by the dungeon and

the outside world. This chapter presents new exotic weap-

ons and new magic items, most of which are designed for

use in the outdoor world. The last section of the chapter

describes a new type of magic item, the infusion.

EXOTIC WEAPONS

The weapons presented below can be useful to characters

in the outdoors. Exotic weapons such as these may be in

common use in distant corners of the campaign world,

and they present interesting options for characters who

learn to use them.

Weapon Descriptions

Ankus: The ankus is a hooked device used to steer ele-

phants. It deals only subdual damage, but because of its

hook, you can also use it to make trip attacks. You can

drop the ankus to avoid being tripped during your own

trip attempt. The ankus has 10-foot reach.

Blowgun: The blowgun is a long tube through which

you  blow air  to  fire  needles.  A  needle  does  1  point  of

damage,  and  it  can  deliver  an  injury  or  contact  type

poison.

Blowgun, Greater: The greater blowgun fires blow-

gun darts, which are slightly smaller than thrown darts.

These dans do 1d4 points of damage in addition to deliv-

ering poisons.

Caber: A caber is a heavy pole that you can throw at

one or more targets grouped closely together. To throw a

caber, you must target a 10-toot-square area and hit AC 15.

Success means that everyone in the target area must make

a Reflex save (DC = your attack roll) or move 5 feet back-

ward. If a creature or object in the target area is incapable

of movement, it takes 2d6 points of damage. The caber is

normally used for breaking up military formations.

Crossbow, Winch: The winch crossbow fires a rope

and pulley attached to a special crossbow bolt. The bolt is

split down the head and center of the shaft, with the split

head  bending  away  from  the  shaft  like  a  two-headed

snake. A thin rope secured to each tip slows the bolt in

flight (hence the reduced range increment). On a success-

ful hit, the bolt snaps apart like a wishbone, taking the at-

tached ropes past the target to wrap around and entangle

it. If the target is a movable object ot your size category or

smaller, you can use the ropes to pull it toward you.

An entangled creature suffers a 2 penalty on attack

rolls and a 4 penalty to Dexterity. It can move only at

half speed and cannot charge or run. If you control the

Reach weapon.

The weapon deals subdual damage rather than normal damage.

CHAPTER 3: TOOLS OF THE TRADE

trailing  rope  by  succeeding  at  an  opposed  Strength

check while holding it, the entangled creature can move

only  within  the limits  that  the  rope  allows.  Casting  a

spell while entangled requires a successful Concentra-

tion check (DC 15).

The entangled creature can escape the ropes with an

Escape Artist check (DC 20), which is a full-round action.

The rope has 5 hit points and can be burst (see Chapter 8

of the Players Handbook) with a Strength check (DC 25,

also a full-round action).

A  winch  crossbows  entangling  effect  is  useful  only

against creatures between Tiny and Large size, inclusive.

The subdual damage can affect any creature.

A  winch  crossbow  requires  two  hands  for  effective

use, regardless  of  the  users  size.  Loading  a  winch

crossbow  is  a  full-round action  that  provokes attacks

of opportunity.

A Medium-size or larger creature can shoot, but not

load, a winch crossbow with one hand at a 4 penalty.

A  Medium-size  or  larger  creature  can  shoot  a  winch

crossbow with each hand at a 6 penalty, plus the usual

4  penalty  for  the  off-hand  attack  (6  primary

hand/10  off  hand). The Two-Weapon  Fighting  feat

does  not  reduce  these  penalties  because  it  represents

skill  with  melee  weapons,  not  ranged  ones. The  Am-

bidexterity feat lets you avoid the 4 off-hand penalty,

bringing the penalties to 6 for both the primary hand

and the offhand.

Nagaika: The nagaika is a leather lash studded with

glass. Unlike the whip, it deals normal damage and can

damage  armored  foes.  Although  you  keep  it  in  your

hand,  treat  it  as  a  projectile  weapon  with  a  maximum

range of 15 feet and no range penalties.

Because the nagaika can wrap around an enemys leg

or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. You can

drop it to avoid being tripped during your own trip at-

tempt. You also gain a 2 bonus on your opposed attack

rolls when using the nagaika to disarm an opponent (in-

cluding  the  roll  to  keep  from  being  disarmed  if  your

attempt tails).

Nagaika,  Mighty:  A  character  who  takes  Exotic

Weapon  Proficiency  (nagaika)  is  also  proficient  with

the mighty nagaika. This weapon is made of exception-

ally strong leather, which allows the user to apply his or

her  Strength  bonus  on  damage  rolls  (within  the

weapons limit).

NEW MAGIC ITEMS

The Wolf represents overconfidence. He is inclined to let his

prey have a head start, only to bound farther and faster than the

prey. But the Wolf ignores the long run. Someday, something

will be faster than the Wolf and will not give him a head start.

The Deck of Ages

This section describes several new magic items of vari-

ous types. Many of these items are especially useful to

characters who spend most of their time outdoors and to

those who deal with animals.

Several of these devices are designed tor use by ani-

mals. An animal can wear only one collar, saddle, bridle,

or other such item at a time.

Armor and Shield Special Abilities

Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least

a +1 enhancement bonus.

Aquatic: Armor and shields with this  enchantment

appear streamlined and possess a greenish glint. A suit ot

armor or shield with this enchantment enables its wearer

to move freely through water without the need tor Swim

checks. Drowning rules still apply unless the item is also

28

enchanted with water breathing.

Caster  Level:  7th; Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, freedom of movement, water breathing; Market Price:

+2 bonus, or +3 bonus with water breathing.

Ease: A suit of armor with this enchantment allows its

wearer to rest comfortably overnight without removing

it, regardless of how heavy it is. The wearer can don ease

armor in only 5 rounds, or remove it in a single round.

Caster  Level:  5th; Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, soften earth and stone; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Wild:  The armor and enhancement  bonuses  of  this

item remain in effect even while the wearer is in wild

shape. Such items meld into the wearers wild shape and

thus cannot be seen in that form.

Caster  Level:  9th; Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, meld into stone; Market Price: +3 bonus.

Specific Armors

The following specific suits of armor are usually precon-

structed with exactly the qualities described here.

Gray Ironwood Suit: When first found, this +2 full plate

of wood that has been permanently rendered into ironwood.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, ironwood; Market Price: 137,650 gp.

Equerrys  Armor:  This  armor  appears  to  be  finely

crafted  +2 full  plale  specifically  cut  for  someone  who

fights from atop a mount. Its wearer gains a +1 compe-

tence bonus on Ride checks. In addition, equerrys armor

grants the wearers mount a +2 enhancement bonus to

Dexterity and increases its speed by +10 feet.

Armor; Market Price: 10,670 gp.

Magic Weapon Special Abilities

A magic weapon with a special ability must have at least

a +1 enhancement bonus.

Exhausting:  A  weapon  with  this  ability  deals  +1d6

points of damage with each successful hit. However, all

the damage it deals (the normal amount for a weapon of

its  kind plus  all  applicable  bonuses)  is  subdual  rather

than normal damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so en-

chanted bestow the exhausting effect upon their ammu-

nition.

Caster  Level:  8th; Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, soften earth and stone; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Hunting:  When  used  by  a  ranger  against  a  favored

enemy, a hunting weapon doubles the wielders favored

enemy bonus on weapon damage rolls.

Caster  Level:  6th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, greater magic fang; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Opposable:  Even  a  creature  that  lacks  the  proper

hands for weapon use can wield an opposable weapon.

This enchantment creates one or more thumblike pro-

jections  on  the weapon. These  artificial  thumbs  fold

around  the  appropriate  limb  of  the  wielder  to  allow

proper  use. To  wield  an  opposable  weapon,  a  creature

must be corporeal, have limbs, have proficiency with the

weapon, and be able to stand without the  limb(s) that

wield the opposable weapon.

Caster  Level:  6th; Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, greater magic fang; Market Price: +1 bonus.

structed with exactly the qualities described here.

Arrow  of  Cure  Light Wounds: When  this  other-

wise normal +1 arrow  strikes  a  target,  it  does  no

effect for the same period to ensure optimum communi-

cation. If the distance between the animal and the helms

wearer  ever  exceeds  one  mile,  the  connection  is  sus-

pended until either the duration expires or the animal is

once again within range. The user can select a different

animal for each use.

Caster  Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous  Item,

speak with animals; Market Price: 7,200 gp; Weight: 2 lb.

Necklace of Favored Enemy Detection: This star-

shaped necklace is made of pure silver. When one of the

lace emits a low hum. By concentrating, the wearer can

detect the direction of the nearest favored enemy within

that range.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites:  Craft Wondrous Item.

detect favored enemy; Market Price: 34,000 gp; Weight: .

Standing Stone: This massive stone obelisk increases

a druids ability to cast a single spell when in contact with

it. The creator chooses a druid spell for the stone to affect

and a specific sacrifice (such as a cow or a pile of gems)

that activates it. Thereafter, any druid can use the meld

into stone spell to merge with the standing stone and dis-

cover  those  two  pieces  of  information.  Once  she  has

done  so,  she  can activate the  standing stone for  herself

only by making the designated sacrifice.

From that point forward, whenever the druid is in con-

tact with the activated stone, she casts that spell as if it

were affected by the feats Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell,

and Extend Spell. Because each standing stone affects only

one  spell,  these  items  are  typically  arranged  in  circles

with no more than 30 feet between any adjacent pair, so

that a druid may move to a new stone to cast a new spell

each round. The caster level and market price (not in-

30

cluding transportation) are determined by the level of

the spell the stone affects, as follows.

Wilding  Clasp:  Appearing  as  a  3-inch-long  gold

chain, this item works only when attached to an amulet,

vest, or similar item. The clasp prevents both itself and

the attached item from melding into the wearers new

form when transforming magic (such as polymorph self or

wild  shape) is  used. The item  is still  worn  in  the  same

manner it previously was and remains available for use in

the new form. For example, a druid with a wilding clasp at-

CHAPTER 3: TOOLS OF THE TRADE

tached  to  her periapt of Wisdom  could  use wild shape  to

become  a  wolf,  but the  periapt  and  the  wilding clasp

would  remain  in  their  normal  forms,  fully  functional.

Some  forms  may  be  harmful  to  certain  items;  for  in-

stance, it would be unwise to take the form of a fire ele-

mental while retaining a functional necklace of fireballs.

Casler Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poly-

morph self or wild shape ability; Market Price: 4,000 gp; Weight: .

Like drinking a potion, eating an infusion provokes at-

tacks of opportunity. A successful attack against the user

forces a Concentration check (DC = 10 + damage dealt). Fail-

ure means the character cannot eat the infusion in that

round. If desired, an attacker may direct the attack of op-

portunity against the infusion rather than the character, de-

stroying the item on a successful hit (see Attack an Object

in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook).

INFUSIONS

This forest is our home. We derive strength from its roots. You

do not, unless we say so.

Vadania

Since sentient beings first walked upon the land, they have

been quick to take advantage of the bounty of life before

them. When human and elven foragers discovered that

earing the leaves of a certain vine could stave off infection,

the science of herbalism was born. Experimentation over

the years, across the continents and oceans, proved that

nature held secret cures for many of the diseases and weak-

nesses that the world knew. This section presents another

use for herbs in the creation of infusionsmagic items

that can be imbued with the power of spells.

What Is an Infusion?

An infusion  is  a  divine  spell  stored  within  a  specially

treated herb. It works like a scroll, except that it is use-ac-

livatedto activate the spell, the user must consume the

herb. This makes infusions ideal for the druid; she can

hide several of them for later consumption, thus gaining

access to spell effects while she is in wild shape and has no

voice or hands to cast spells or use standard items.

Physical Description

Infusions vary widely in appearance, from red berries to

din-covered roots. In general, they are very small and es-

sentially weightless itemsa bag of ten weighs only a

single pound. An infusion is quite delicate, with an AC of

9, 1 hit point, a hardness of 0, and a break DC of 6.

Activation

In addition  to  consumption  of  the herb,  several  other

steps and conditions come into play when activating an

infusion.

Analyze the Chemistry: To determine what spell an in-

tusion contains, a character must analyze its chemistry.

This requires a read magic spell or a successful Spellcraft

check (DC 15 + spell level). Analyzing an infusion does not

activate it unless it is a specially designed cursed infusion.

Of course, it is possible to activate an infusion without

first analyzing its chemistry. In that case, the user simply

doesnt know what spell he or she is about to use.

Activate the Infusion: To attempt to activate an in-

fusion, the user simply eats it. This is a standard action

requiring no  material components  or  focus.  (The  cre-

ator of the infusion provided those.) Some spells (such

as ironwood) are effective only when cast on an item. In

that case, the user must provide the item at the time of

activation or the spell is wasted. An infusion cannot be

administered to an unconscious creature.

To successfully activate an infusion, the

user must meet the following requirements:

Have the spell it contains on his or her

class  list  (see  Chapter  11  of  the Players

Handbook  for spells available to various

classes).

Have  the requisite  ability  score  to  cast

the spell (for example, Wisdom 15 for a

druid casting a 5th-level spell).

Have a caster level at least equal to that

of the infusion.

If  the  user  meets  all  the  above  require-

ments, the spell stored in the infusion takes

effect  immediately  after  consumption.

Otherwise, the infusion acts as an ingestive

poison. The  user  must  make  a  Fortitude

save (DC  10  +  one-half  of  the  infusions

caster  level)  or  become  nauseated.  A

second saving throw at the same DC and

with the  same  consequence  for  failure

must be made 1 minute later.

Optional Rule: Druids

as Alchemists

Druids  tend  to  make  poor  al-

chemists,  since  Alchemy  is  a

cross-class  skill  for  them.  But

while  its  logical  that  most

druids  wouldnt  be  experts  at

creating  alchemists  fire,  their

exposure  to  the  natural  world

and  its  dangers  might  give

them  some  talent  for  crafting

antitoxins and other substances

useful in the wild.

Under  this  optional  rule,

druids  can  use  the  Craft

(herbalism)  skill  instead  of  the

Alchemy  skill  to  create  smoke-

sticks,  tindertwigs,  antitoxins,

and  tanglefoot  bags.  Use  the

DCs  given  in  the  Alchemy  skill

description  and  the  rules  for

making items given in the Craft

skill  description  (see  Chapter  3

of  the  Players Handbook) for

crafting these items.

Determine the Effect: A spell success-

fully activated from an infusion works like

a  spell  prepared  and  cast  in  the  normal

way. The infusions caster level is always the minimum re-

quired for that spell, unless the caster is of a different class

or  specifically  desires  otherwise.  For  example,  a 12th-

level druid might want to create a flame strike infusion at

caster  level  12  rather  than  the  minimum  for  the  spell

(caster level 7) to get the extra level-dependent benefits.

Since infusions are consumed during activation, they

cannot be reused.

Random Generation

You can  randomly  generate  infusions  just  as  you  can

divine  scrolls.  See  Chapter  8  of  the DUNGEON  MASTERS

Guide for details.

Creating Infusions

The process for creating infusions is similar to that for

creating scrolls. The creator needs a supply of prepared

herbs, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost for cre-

ating the infusion25 gp per spell level times the caster

level. The creator must pay the full cost for creating the

infusion regardless of how many times he or she has pre-

viously created the same one.

The creator must have prepared the spell to be infused

and must provide any material components or focuses re-

quired. If casting the spell would reduce the casters XP

total, the creator pays that cost upon beginning the infu-

sion in addition to the XP cost for making the infusion

itself. Likewise, any material components are consumed

31

CHAPTER 3: TOOLS OF THE TRADE

when the process begins, but focuses are not. (A focus

used in creating an infusion can be reused.) The act of in-

fusing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable

for casting until the character has rested and regained

spells. (That is, the spell slot is expended from the cre-

ators currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)

Creating  an  infusion  requires  one  day  per  1,000  gp

value of the completed infusion.

Variant: Doing It Yourself

A character whos at home in the outdoors and has a good

working knowledge of plants may be able to collect and

prepare the components for an infusion personally rather

than paying the local herbalist for them. With a little time

and energy, a character with ranks in Profession (herbal-

ist) and Wilderness Lore can remove the merchant from

the equation and save some money in the process.

Collecting

Different infusions require different herbs. Not surpris-

ingly, the higher the spell level, the more rare and prized

is the herb required for an infusion of it. Thus, not only is

the herb for a heal infusion different from the one for a

cure light wounds infusion, it is also harder to find. Herbs

for  the  highest-level  spells  may  grow  only  in  the  re-

motest locales, so collection may require long journeys.

A character can use Wilderness Lore to forage for an

herb while moving at one-half his or her normal over-

land movement rate through a forested or other natural

area. Make a Wilderness Lore check (DC = 10 + twice the

level of the spell to be infused) at the end ot each day

spent foraging. Success indicates that the character has

found a sufficient quantity of the herb for a single infu-

sion of the desired spell; failure means none was found.

Casting detect animals or plants grants the character a +2

circumstance bonus on that days check.

While  foraging  in  this  fashion,  a  character  can  also

forage for sustenance, as detailed in the Wilderness Lore

skill description in Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook.

Gardening

Though growing herbs for infusions seems like a good

idea, seldom does an adventuring character actually do

so. Maintaining an herb garden requires hours of work

each day in a single locale, and most adventurers cannot

abide this degree of attachment to one place. Still, any

32

character wishing to undertake the challenge of garden-

ing may attempt it according to the following rules.

Once the character has acquired a sample of the de-

sired herb (see Collecting, above), he or she can attempt

to cultivate it. A single character can care for a number of

herbs equal to twice the number of ranks he or she has

acquired in Wilderness Lore. With proper care, an herb

garden produces a harvest twice a year.

To produce an herb crop, the character must make a

Wilderness Lore or Profession (farmer) check for each

week of cultivation, plus an additional Wilderness Lore

check at harvest time. The DC for the weekly cultivation

check is one-half the DC required to find the herb (see

Collecting, above). If this check fails by 5 or more, the

herb withers and dies. Each time it fails by less than 5, a

cumulative 1 penalty is imposed on the final Wilder-

ness Lore check for harvesting the crop, if that last check

is  successful,  the  herbs  harvested  are  sufficient  for  a

number of infusions equal to one-half the check result.

Failure indicates that no usable herbs are produced.

Hiring a gardener to perform this task may be a rea-

sonable option. A skilled gardener earns 1 gp per day, or

about 180 gp per season. (This does not include the cost

of acquiring  the herb for planting,  nor  the  cost  of  the

land for the garden.) The average gardener can cultivate

two herbs per season, each of which produces enough

herbs for 1d4 infusions.

Preparing

Before an herb  can  be  used  in  an  infusion,  it  must  be

properly prepared. Some herbs must be treated or dried;

others must be baked, steamed, or doused with a solution

of oil or seawater. Again, the higher the level of the spell

to be infused, the more difficult and complex the prepa-

ration becomes. Preparing an herb for infusion requires a

Profession (herbalist) check.

To determine how long the preparation takes, first find

the base cost to create the infusion on Table 33 and con-

vert the price to silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp). Then make a

Profession (herbalist) check (DC = 10 + twice the level of

the spell to be infused) representing one weeks worth of

work, if the check succeeds, multiply the check result by

the DC. A total equal to or greater than the base cost for

creation means that the herb is ready to be infused with

the desired spell. A total below that price represents the

progress made that week. Make another check the sub-

sequent week and, if it is successful, add that check result

times the DC to the previous weeks result. As soon as the

sum of these weekly totals equals or exceeds the price of

Table 34: Tailored Infusions

Table 34: Tailored Infusions

CHAPTER 3: TOOLS OF THE TRADE

the item in silver pieces, the preparation is complete.

Failure at any point indicates that the character makes

no progress that week. Failure by 5 or more means the

character ruins the raw materials and must begin again

with a fresh supply of the herb.

Optional Rule: Benefits of Hard Work

Taking the time and trouble to collect or grow each herb,

prepare it, and infuse it with a spell is hard work. By so

doing, however, characters attune themselves to nature

and her bounty. Making an infusion from scratch raises

its caster level by +1. This increase alters neither the cost

of creating the infusion nor the difficulty of using it.

Optional Rule: Tailored Infusions

The  fantasy  world  of  the  DUNGEONS & DRAGONS  game

teems  with  distinctive  and  individual  animals,  beasts,

and plants. Rather than assuming that a certain infusion

uses some nameless herb, reference the spells level and

school on Table 34 to find the name of the herb needed.

CHAPTER 4: ANIMALS

CHAPTER 4:

ANIMALS

The Brine Lords coral castle is surrounded by hungry sharks.

He calls the toothy creatures to his home, then lets them roam

free.  He  doesnt  bother  controlling  them;  something  always

comes by to make the sharks want to stay.

Soveliss

Animals are among natures most potent resources. They

offer  sustenance  with  their  milk, their  eggs, and their

very flesh. Their skins and hides provide clothing and

shelter from the elements. Some can also serve as trans-

portation for characters and goods, or even guard against

predators.

This chapter begins with an expanded discussion of

how to choose, acquire, and care for an animal compan-

ion, as well as what a character can expect from that rela-

tionship. Following this are statistics for several new dire

animals. Finally, a new subtype of animal is presented

the legendary animalalong with statistics for several

creatures of that subtype.

Previous Sources

The  core  rulebooks  of  the

DUNGEONS &  DRAGONS game

offer  plenty  of  material  about

animal  companions.  The  de-

scription  of  the  druid  in  the

Players Handbook lays  out  the

basic  concepts.  The  animal

friendship spell, in Chapter 11 of

the  same  book,  gives  still  more

information.  Finally,  the  side-

bar  on  Animal  Companions

in  Chapter  2  of  the  DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide continues  the

discussion  and  introduces  the

concept  of  training  and  teach-

ing tricks.

ANIMAL COMPANIONS

Druids and rangers have deeper and more complex rela-

tionships  with  animals  than  other  characters  do,  but

even  so,  the  basics  are  unchanged. These  special

guardians of nature are just as likely as any other charac-

ter to consume the bounty of nature in the

form of hunted animalsthats pan of the

cycle of life. Hide armor is popular among

druids, and rangers frequently use horses or

other  creatures  as  mounts  or  beasts  of

burden. The difference is that both the druid

and the ranger have a fundamental respect

for the natural world they live in. Not only

are they committed to studying the outdoors

through  the  Knowledge  (nature)  and

Wilderness Lore skills, but they also main-

tain special relationships with animal com-

panions.

Animal companions are an important part

of a druids (and to a lesser extent, a rangers)

power. The druid lacks some of the clerics

spellcasting versatility and casts fewer spells

per day, but her powerful animal compan-

ions go a long way toward compensating. An

animal  companion  can  serve  as  a  protector,  tracker,

scout, mount, and warriorsometimes all at once. It can

even be a friend capable of offering advice, thanks to the

magic of awaken. Moreover, the Hit Dice of an adventur-

ing  druids  animal  companion  can  equal  her  own,

whereas followers and cohorts almost always have fewer

Hit Dice than their leaders.

tial to do more than 20 points of damage per round. Later,

the dire tiger offers 120 hit points on average, plus even

more  damage  potential  through  its  claw,  bite,  pounce,

grab, and rake attacks. Thus, regardless of their limita-

tions, animal companions are incredibly valuable.

Shopping for an Animal

The 1st-level druid starts out with an animal companion,

but throughout the rest of her adventuring career, she

must do a bit of work to acquire new onesas must the

ranger. The  first  step  is  to  choose  the  desired  kind  of

animal from the options described in the Monster Manual

and in Chapter 1 of this book.

Since having animal companions is a core ability of

the druid and the ranger, the DM shouldnt make it par-

ticularly difficult or challenging to find one. The  sim-

plest  option  is  to  allow  the  character  a  couple  of  days

between adventures to find the desired companion. As

long as he or she searches in a terrain that is home to that

species, it takes only a day or two to find an appropriate

creature. (Of course, its impossible to find a lion in polar

regions or a shark on land.)

To play this out a bit more, have the druid or ranger

make a Wilderness Lore check (DC 10 for most animals)

to discover the creatures regular territory, then use the

Track feat to locate one specimen. The detect animals or

plants spell allows the character to focus the search on a

single species within range. Power sight, a new spell de-

scribed in Chapter 6, can reveal the exact Hit Dice of a

target animal and thus whether or not the character can

befriend it. Assume that with the use of Wilderness Lore

and a detect animals or plants spell, the character has a 30%

chance to locate an animal for each day spent searching

in an appropriate terrain and climate.

If the DM wants to center a campaign around individ-

ual heroes and their quests, the parry could have a good

rime seeking out the lair of the evil sorcerer who has im-

prisoned animals for diabolical purposes, or rescuing a

bear from a frost giants kitchen before it lands on the

supper table. A few such quests could be interesting and

give the animal companion a special place in the party,

but it may not be appropriate to reserve game time for

this sort of activity if the character is changing animal

companions frequently.

Better than Average Animals

Its  simplest  to  assume  that  the  druid  and  the  ranger

always  find  animal  companions  that  are  average  for

their  species,  with  the  ability  scorcs  and  average  hit

points given in the Monster Manual. But some creatures

deviate from this norm, with hit points above or below

the average, or even unusual ability scorcs. Wolves with

18  hit  points  instead  of  13  exist,  and  so  do  lions  with

Strength 25 instead of 21. While it may be simplest to

assume that all animal companions are average, its in a

characters  best  interest  to  seek  out  creatures  that

exceed the norm.

34

The  typical  druid  chooses  a  wolf  as  her  first  animal

companion. The wolf attacks as well as a fighter of com-

parable Hit Dice, plus it can track. Five levels later, the

druid could have a brown bear, which averages a whop-

ping 51 hit points and has three attacks with the poten-

The obvious way to do this is to generate an animals

hit  points  and  ability  scorcs  randomly  whenever  the

character encounters one. Rolling for hit points is easy,

and  generating ability  scorcs  isnt  tough  (see  Ability

Scores  for  Monsters  in  Chapter  2  of  the  DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide). The disadvantage of this method is that it

involves a lot of dice-rolling and could result in day after

day of searching for the picky character.

The  best  solution  is  not  to  reveal an animals  ability

scorcs  or  hit  points.  After  all,  while  it  may  be  easy  to

identify a sick animal, its tough to differentiate between

two  animals  whose  Strength  scorcs  differ  by  2  points.

And no animal is likely to tolerate a barrage of tests de-

signed to determine whether its a worthy companion

before the character has magically befriended it. Intend-

ing to perform such tests after casting animal friendship is

a  violation  of  the spells  parameters,  since  it  functions

only for a caster who has a true heart and actually wishes

to be the animals friend. Only after the character has ad-

ventured with the animal for weeks or months (assume

2d4  weeks as an average)  should  the  DM  consider  re-

vealing its ability scorcs and hit points. At that point, the

character can abandon the animal and begin anew, if de-

sired. However, doing this too often may call the charac-

ters true heart into question.

Two ability scorcs actually have limitations. First, an

animals Intelligence score never exceeds 2 without the

assistance  of  magic.  Most  mammals,  lizards, and birds

have Intelligence 2, while snakes, fish, and lower-order

animals have Intelligence  1.  Second,  only  one  normal

animal (the wolverine) has a Charisma score greater than

7, and no dire animal has a Charisma greater than 11.

The Bond

The bond created by an animal friendship  spell is not a

magical  one.  It  cannot  be  dispelled,  though  dominate

animal or some other magical compulsion could cause

the  animal  to  act  against  the  characters  wishes. The

animal acknowledges the character as its friendsome-

thing like a special denmate or a member of the pack.

The animal may realize that the character isnt really one

of its own, but true conscious thought along those lines

is beyond most animals ability.

As the Animal Companions sidebar in Chapter 2 of the

DUNGEON MASTERS Guide states, a companion is still only

an animal. It cannot understand human speech. Other

than following its friend and performing the tricks it has

been  taught,  it  cannot  respond  to  directions.  An  em-

pathic link exists between the wizard and her familiar

and  between  the  paladin  and  her  mount,  but  not  be-

tween a druid (or a ranger) and an animal companion.

Thus, an animal companion makes a poor scout, since it

has no way to communicate what it seesand even if it

did, its low Intelligence prevents it from knowing what

to look for or how to analyze what it finds.

The animal expects its friend to either provide it with

sustenance  or  give  it  adequate  time  to  find  food  and

water on its own. In addition, though the animal natu-

rally defends its friend, and may even attack his or her

enemies, it doesnt enjoy combat. While the druid and

the ranger can accept that some pain is necessary in the

service of good or the defense of the land, these concepts

are lost on the lion, hawk, or lizard that is being struck,

mauled, or energy drained. The animal expects its friend

to try to keep it safe, so painful fight after painful fight

may cause it to grow weary of the punishment.

CHAPTER 4: ANIMALS

Animal Mood and Attitude

The  player  whose  character  has  befriended  an  animal

usually controls it. As long as that character continues to

fulfill the obligations and duties of friendship, this is a

fine way to run things. Should anything complicate or

challenge that relationship, however, the DM may want

to step in and control the animals reactions.

When a character befriends an animal through animal

friendship, its attitude toward its new friend automatically

becomes helpful (see Chapter 5 of the DUNGEON MASTERS

Guide.) Should the character ever abuse the animal phys-

ically or expose it to adverse situations that strain its loy-

alty,  the  DM  can  adjust  its  attitude

appropriatelyto friendly, indifferent, or

worse as the situation requires. A friendly

animal may or may not aid its friend, and

an  indifferent  one  certainly  wont.  An

animal that has become unfriendly or hos-

tile looks for the first chance to depart or

lash  out  at  the  friend  who  has  clearly

abused  its  trust.  However,  through  role-

playing  and  judicious  use  of  the  Animal

Empathy skill, a character may be able to

repair  such  a  breach  of  trust.  Use Table

54:  Influencing  NPC  Attitude  in  the

DUNGEON MASTERS Guide to determine the

DC for the check.

The  animal  has  no  special  tie  to  its

friends fellow adventurers, so its initial at-

titude toward them is indifferent. It does-

nt  protect  them  unless  ordered,  but

neither  does  it  attack  them  unless  pro-

voked. Roleplaying and the use of Animal

Empathy can adjust the animals attitude

about  other  party  members  in  the  same

manner as described above.

Limitations and Problems

The presence of animal companions in an

adventuring party can present a variety of

problems. Wild animals are generally not

accepted inside a city or within the lords

keep. To  most  peasants,  a  wild  animal  is

something to be feared, driven off, or put

down,  just  like  a  troll  or  a  griffon  would  be.  Only  the

most famous druid or ranger heroes can expect an urban

population  to  accept  wild  creatures  walking  along  the

streetseven in the company of humanoids.

The Best Animal

Companion?

Whats  the  best  animal  to  be-

friend? You should try to main-

tain your maximum allowed Hit

Dice of companions, and when-

ever  possible,  invest  all  those

Hit  Dice  in  a  single  animal.

Unless  you  want  an  animal

companion  just  to  serve  as  a

distraction, it needs the best hit

points  and  attack  bonus  pos-

sible. Most magical beasts and

underground  denizens  can

overpower  an  animal  of  equal

Hit  Dice,  so  you  have  to  work

hard  to  keep  animal  compan-

ions competitive.

That said, some animals tend

to  make  better  companions

than  others.  A  horse  makes

some  sense,  perhaps,  though

its  just  as  easy  to  purchase

one.  In  general,  you  cant  go

wrong  choosing  the  most

combat-effective  animal  you

can get. Depending on the Hit

Dice,  that  means  a  wolf,  lion,

bear, or tigeror a dire version

thereof.

Most characters solve this problem by simply asking

their companions to stay in the wilderness outside town.

An animal companion can accept such a parting of the

ways as long as it remains short (less than a week), or the

characters visits are frequent. Of course, leaving a wild

animal outside town can present another problemthe

creature may think that the domesticated cows, chick-

ens, or horses on the nearby farms are meant for its con-

sumption.

Another tough situation is the dungeon. Most animals

(other than bats, lizards, rats, snakes, toads, and the dire

versions thereof ) are unaccustomed to dwelling under-

ground. Bears, even though they live in caves, are not

truly native to subterranean habitats. Surface-dwelling

35

CHAPTER 4: ANIMALS

animals  are  reluctant  to  proceed  into  confined  spaces

and  tight,  sunless  corridors.  Even  if  they  can  be  con-

vinced to enter the dungeon, most animals have great

difficulty  dealing  with  pits,  steep  inclines,  narrow

crevices,  and  similar  dungeon  challenges.

Without magical levitation or the ability to

fly, a creature such as a dire tiger could easily

get stuck somewhere in the Underdark. Be-

cause  of  this,  some  characters  choose  to

leave their animal companions outside the

dungeon. Alternatively, the calm trick (see

Chapter 2) can enhance a creatures ability to

deal with dungeon environments.

Food and Care

A character with an animal companion must

see to its care and feeding during adventures.

The  obvious  option,  of  course,  is  to  carry

food for it. The biggest problem with doing

this is typically the weight, not the cost. For

an  herbivore,  a  days  worth  of  feed  costs  a

mere 5 cp and weighs 10 pounds; for a carni-

vore,  it  costs  5  sp  and  weighs  10  pounds.

Each day, a Medium-size herbivore or carni-

vore drinks at least a gallon of water, which

weighs about 8 pounds (plus the weight of

the container), and a Large animal drinks at

least 3 gallons a day. Given the typical horses

carrying capacity, it can be a real challenge to

carry more than two weeks  of  food  for  an

animal  companion.  On  extended  trips,  a

druid can rely upon create water and goodberry.

One goodberry  can  provide  sustenance  for

one Medium-size herbivore or carnivore; a

Large  animal  requires  two  per  day,  and  a

Huge  creature  requires  four.  As  a  final

option, a character may be able to convince a

hungry carnivore to eat the flesh of a slain

monsterparticularly a beast, dragon, giant,

humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous hu-

manoid.

Raising a Companion

The realistic way to get a better

than average animal is to raise

it  from  infancy.  An  animal  that

never  goes  hungry  and  gets

ample exercise is likely to grow

up  stronger,  tougher,  and

slightly  more  intelligent  than

the average creature of its kind.

To  reflect  this,  the  DM  may

allow  an  animal  companion

that a character has raised and

trained  from  birth  to  have  2

bonus hit points per Hit Die, an

extra  3  points  for  its  ability

scorcs (distributed as the player

sees fit), and the ability to learn

one additional trick per point of

Intelligence.

Rearing  a  wild  animal  takes

one  year  and  requires  one

Handle Animal check (DC 15 +

HD of animal). No skill check is

required  if  the  creature  has

already become an animal com-

panion to a druid or ranger, but

most adventurers choose to be-

friend  animals  only  after  they

are  old  enough  to  be  helpful.

Paying  someone  to  raise  an

animal may be a more feasible

option  for  adventuring  charac-

ters.  A  professional  trainer

charges 250 gold pieces per Hit

Die of the animal to rear it.

This  method  of  acquiring

animal  companions  requires

more planning than just search-

ing  for  one  does,  but  its  also

useful  for  nonadventuring

druids who arent likely to gain

levels  (and  thus  require  new

animal  companions)  very  fre-

quently.

Another option is to allow the animal to

graze or hunt for itself. It must eat at least

once every third day, just like a human, or

begin to suffer the effects of starvation (see

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide).

Grazing  animals  need  only  grassland  or  a

hayfield; no skill check is required. To forage

for water or to hunt, the animal must make a

Wilderness Lore check (DC 10). Success indicates that it

has  acquired  a  days  worth  of  food  and  water;  failure

means no suitable sustenance was found. If the animal is

foraging in its native terrain and climate, it suffers no

penalties  on  the  check;  otherwise,  a  circumstance

penalty of at least 4 and as much as 8 applies. If the

animal moves at one-half its overland movement rate or

slower, it can hunt while traveling; otherwise, it requires

4 hours per day to hunt.

36

Finally, animals arent prepared for climates other than

their own. Those adapted for the cold, such as bears, per-

form poorly in warm deserts, and cold-blooded animals

such as snakes and lizards suffer in cold regions. When

outside  its  native  environment,  an  animal  must  make

Fortitude  saving  throws  at  regular  intervals  to  avoid

taking subdual damage. The rules for this are the same as

those given for characters in the Heat Dangers and Cold

Dangers sections in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS

Guide, except that the animals Wilderness Lore skill pro-

vides no bonuses on these saves. A character, however,

may provide bonuses to an animal companion with a suc-

cessful Wilderness Lore check, as noted in the Wilder-

ness  Lore  skill  description  in  the  Players  Handbook.

Eventually, though, the character must make a choice:

Take the animal out of the foreign environment, cast a

protection  spell  such  as  endure  elements,  or  watch  the

creature perish.

Breaking the Limits

Often, the  best  way  to  improve  the  abilities  of  animal

companions and overcome some of their limitations is

the use of spells and magic items.

Enhancing Magic:  Magic  fang  and natures  favor  en-

hance an animal companions combat ability. Might of the

oak, persistence of the waves, and speed of the wind each en-

hance one of an animals ability scorcs at the expense of

another. Animal growth improves an animals combat ef-

fectiveness through increased Hit Dice, Strength, Con-

stitution, damage, and hit points. Finally, natures avatar

increases an animals hit points and grants it the benefits

of haste, thus transforming it into a fearsome destructive

machine. The lower-level spells, especially natures favor.

are excellent for use in wands. See Chapter 6 for spell de-

scriptions.

Barding: Horses,  ponies,  riding  lizards,  and  riding

dogs typically accept armor in the form of barding, but

wild creatures simply refuse the burden. With the armor

trick (see Chapter 2), a character can adapt any animal to

the use of armor. Barding is available in all armor types

(including  masterwork  and  magical  versions),  but  it

always costs more than comparable human armor. See

Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook for additional rules on

barding.

Communication: Adopting an animal form through

wild shape or polymorph self doesnt impart the ability to

communicate with that species (at least, not without the

Speaking Wild Shape feat described in Chapter 2). The

speak with animals spell is the one of the best ways to con-

verse with animal companions, but a helm of bonding or a

torc  of  animal  speech (see  Chapter  3  for  magic  item  de-

scriptions) also allows communication. Direct conversa-

tion  lets  the  creature  understand  instructions  beyond

the tricks it has learned, but even so, the animals intelli-

gence places an obvious limit on the interaction.

Loyalty: Most animals have poor Will saving throws.

As friendly and loyal as an animal companion is to its

druid or ranger friend, an enemy can all too easily use

magic to control or dominate it. A druid with forcsight

can either  carry  spells  (such  as  dispel magic  or  calm

animal) to neutralize this threat or equip her companions

with collars of resistance.

More Animals: The obvious way to acquire additional

animal  companions  is  to  gain  class  levels  in  druid  or

ranger, but magic items provide a second option. One

ring of animal friendship adds 12 Hit Dice to the characters

CHAPTER 4: ANIMALS

limit, a second raises that to 24, and a hand of glory allows

the use of a third such ring for a total of 36 additional Hit

Dice of animal companions. At a price of only 9,500 gp

per ring and 7,200 gp for the hand of glory, these items are

cheap for their benefits.

Regardless of the total Hit Dice of animal companions

an  adventuring  character  can  have,  none  of  them  can

exceed  his  or  her  own  Hit  Dice.* That  is,  an  8th-level

druid  wearing  with  a  ring  of  animal  friendship  can  be-

friend two dire lions (8HD creatures), but not a dire tiger

(16HD creature), or any creature with more than 8 Hit

Dice. On the other hand, two dire lions can pack quite a

punch.

This  information  supersedes  that  presented  in  the

animal friendship spell in the Players Handbook.

Abandoning a Companion

Characters  want  to  replace  their  animal  companions

from time to time, and there is no penalty for doing so.

Reasons for making a change aboundfor example, a

druid may not wish to expose comparatively weak ani-

mals to dangers they cannot handle, or she may need to

travel to a region where her existing companions could

not survive.

The real issue is the conditions under which a charac-

ter abandons an animal companion. Leaving it in a for-

eign land, or worse, in the depths of some dungeon, is an

evil act. Even neutral and evil druids should be loath to

betray their companions in this way.

Improving a Companion

Some characters, abhorring the prospect of abandoning a

trusted friend every level or two, seek a way out of this

situation. Long ago, druids developed a magical ritual to

deal with this problem. During this ritual, which takes a

full  day  to  perform  at  a  holy  site  or  natural  glade,  the

druids touch imbues one animal companion with addi-

tional strength. The druid loses 200 XP, as if she had cast

a spell with that XP cost. Only animals with a listing for

advancement  in  their  statistics  can  improve  through

this ritual.

At the end of the ritual, the animals Hit Dice increase

by  +1.  As  a  result,  it  gains  additional  hit  points  and  a

bonus on attack rolls, if the new Hit Dice total warrants

that. The  additional  Hit  Die  may  also  increase  the

animals size (see the rules for advancement in the intro-

duction of the Monster Manual). Since it is an animal, the

companion gains neither feats nor skills as it advances.

Awakened Animals

Awaken is a 5th-level spell available to druids. Because it

grants  humanlike  sentience  and  intelligence  to  an

animal, the creatures type changes to magical beast. This

spell greatly changes the relationship between druid and

animal  companion.  Armed  with  intelligence  and  the

ability  to  speak  at  least  one  language,  the  animal  no

longer needs training to understand the druids wishes.

Thus, the druid gains a source of advice and ready con-

versation in addition to a guard and a servant. Of course,

as a fully sentient creature, an awakened animal develops

its own desires and ambitions.

While normally a creature with such a high intelligence

isnt subject to animal friendship, an animal awakened by a

druid remains her companion as long as she treats it with

respect,  as  discussed  above. The  animal  continues  to

count against the druids Hit Dice limit for animal com-

panions. For a time, the awakened animal can even exceed

the druids level. (For example, an awakened dire bear sud-

denly has 14 HD, but it remains with a 12th-level druid).

Until  the  druid  once  again  exceeds  the  animal  in  Hit

Dice, however, she cannot gain new animal companions.

As  a  general  rule,  an  awakened animal  continues  to

assist the druid, at least as long as she continues to in-

clude  it  among  her  companions. When  she  elects  to

leave that animal behind (by befriending a new one), it

soon departs. The animal remains friendly with the druid

and may assist her from time to time, but it no longer ac-

companies her on adventures.

The dire snake combines all the strength and power of

the constrictor with the venomous bite of a viper. It can

constrict an opponent of up to Large size.

or smaller creature.

Skills: The dire snake receives a +4 racial bonus  on

Hide, Listen, and Spot checks, and a +8 racial bonus on

Balance checks. A dire snake with higher Dexterity than

Strength  can  use  its  Dexterity  modifier  on  Climb

checks.

Dire Horse

Aggressive, wild equines that roam the wilderness, dire

horses resist domestication as much as any wild animal

does. A dire horse can fight while carrying a rider, but

the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds at a

Ride check (DC 10).

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a dire horse is up

to 519 pounds, a medium load is 5201,038 pounds, and

a heavy load is 1,0391,557 pounds. A dire horse can drag

7,785 pounds.

Dire Elk

A  bull  dire  elk  is  an  imposing  and  aggressive  beast

during  the  mating  season.  His  enormous  antlers  can

span up to 12 feet, and he can weigh up to 3 tons. If this

creature believes himself challenged, he tries to drive off

the  interloper  by  bellowing  loudly  and  pawing  the

ground, if that doesnt work, the dire elk charges with his

head lowered to deliver a vicious gore with his oversized

antlers, then follows up with stamping and trampling at-

tacks. Females are not antlered (no gore attack) and are

less aggressive than males, but cow dire elks are still for-

midable when their calves are threatened. In the spring,

the bull sheds his antlers, after which his gore attack is

not  available  until  he  regrows  them  the  following

autumn.

Combat

Trample (Ex): A dire elk can trample Medium-size or

smaller creatures for automatic gore damage. Opponents

who do not make attacks of opportunity against the dire

elk  can  attempt  a  Reflex  save  (DC  23)  to  halve  the

damage.

Skills: A dire elk receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks.

Dire Elephant

These  titanic  herbivorcs  are  somewhat  unpredictable

and  likely  to  attack.  Giants  sometimes  use  them  as

mounts or beasts of burden.

Combat

Trample (Ex): A dire elephant can trample Large or

smaller creatures for automatic gore damage. Opponents

who do not make attacks of opportunity against it can at-

tempt a Reflex save (DC 35) to halve the damage.

Legendary  animals  are  animals  of  incredible  strength,

speed, and power. According to some theories, they have

been  imbued  with  power  beyond  all  other  animals  to

serve as natures defenders. Whatever their origin, leg-

endary animals are extraordinarily rare.

Legendary  animals  represent  another  step  in  the

animal  power  curve.  Although  the  same  size  as  their

normal counterparts, they are significantly more power-

ful than even dire versions of their kind. Thus, they make

appropriate  animal  companions  for  high-level  druids.

Making  this  option  available  ensures  that  a  druids

animal companions remain valuable to her as she con-

tinues to advance.

As the druid gains levels, her spellcasting ability and

overall power improve measurably, but her trusted ser-

vants begin to pale in comparison. Given the limitation

that the total Hit Dice of an adventuring druids animal

companions cannot exceed her own level (except at 1st

level, when she can have 2 HD worth of animal com-

panions),  she  eventually  outdistances  her  animal

friends in terms of power. This is easy to see by consid-

ering  the  challenge  ratings  of  the  available  creatures.

For example, a 1st-level adventuring druid can have a 2-

HD wolf companion (a CR 1 creature), which improves

her  combat  ability  (and  thus  her  overall  survivability)

dramatically.  At  6th  level,  she  can  maintain  a  6-HD

animal  companion,  such  as  a  brown  bear,  which  still

adds significantly to her prowess, though it is only a CR

4  creature.  But  when  she  reaches  16th  level  and  ac-

quires a 16-HD dire tiger as an animal companion, she

has gained only a CR 8 creature. In terms of encounter

levels,  the  addition  of  a  CR  8  creature  to  a  16th-level

character results in a negligible improvement. The dire

tiger is by no means an unworthy companion, but the

druid just isnt getting the bang for her buck that she

did  earlier.  Sadly,  she  also  loses  versatility,  since  the

toughest  animal  companions  are  also  Large,  or  even

Huge.  Fitting  these  oversized  creatures  into  cramped

dungeon corridors is a challenge.

Legendary animals rarely appear except in the com-

pany  of  druids  or  other  high-level  characters.  In  fact,

they are never even created until they are needed. They

are created from normal animals of their kind through

the power of nature (or a deity) whenever a character of

appropriate level needs such a companion. Thus, when a

high-level druid goes out to search for a new animal com-

panion, nature mystically makes one available.

Legendary  animals  are  treated  as  dire  animals  for

the  purpose  of  determining  how  spells  affect  them.

For  instance,  a  legendary  animal  is  allowed  a  saving

throw  to  resist  the  calm  animals  spell, just  as  a  dire

animal would be.

Legendary Eagle

With  its  feathers  of  white  and  yellow,  the  legendary

eagle has a reputation for being an omen of good weather

and good times to come. Like all birds of prey, the leg-

endary  eagle  is  a  carnivore  that  hunts  other  birds  and

small reptiles, snakes, and mammals.

Skills: *A legendary eagle receives a +12 racial bonus

on Spot checks in daylight.

Legendary Ape

This ape appears no different from the common ape in

color and markings, but even the casual observer can tell

that it is stronger, faster, and tougher than others of its

kind.

Combat

Legendary apes are aggressive and territorial.

Rend (Ex): A legendary ape that hits with both claw

attacks latches onto the opponents body and tears the

flesh. This  automatically  deals  an  additional  2d8+15

points of damage.

41

CHAPTER 4: ANIMALS

Legendary Wolf

A fierce-looking wolf with black, white, or gray fur, this

animal  is  generally  not  aggressive  toward  humanoids,

though hunger may make it attack.

Combat

Legendary wolves encountered singly may fight, or they

may retreat to call together the pack. Whenever possible,

legendary wolves hunt in groups.

Trip (Ex): A legendary wolf that hits with a bite attack

can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (see Trip

in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook) without making a

touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the

attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the leg-

endary wolf.

Skills: A legendary wolf receives a +2 racial bonus on

Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks, and a +4 racial

bonus on Hide checks. *It also receives a +8 racial bonus

on Wilderness Lore checks when tracking by scent.

Legendary Snake

A strong constrictor with a potent venomous bite, the

legendary snake is frequently found in lakes, rivers, and

streams. It attacks only when threatened.

Combat

Poison (Ex): Bite, Fort save (DC 25), initial and sec-

ondary damage ids temporary Con.

Improved  Crab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  the  dire

snake must hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can

constrict.

Constrict (Ex): A legendary snake deals 1d8+12 points

of damage with a successful grapple check against Large

or smaller creatures.

Skills: A legendary snake receives a +8 racial bonus on

Hide, Listen, and Spot checks, and a +16 racial bonus on

Balance checks. A legendary snake with higher Dexterity

than Strength can use its Dexterity modifier on Climb

checks.

Legendary Horse

Legendary horses can never be domesticated, only be-

friended. Ancient stories tell of heroes riding these crea-

tures,  but  even  the  tales  have  become  very  rare.  A

legendary horse can fight while carrying a rider, but the

rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds at a

Ride check (DC 10).

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a legendary horse

is  up  to  1,200  pounds,  a  medium  load  is  1,2012,400

pounds, and a heavy load is 2,4013,600 pounds. A leg-

endary horse can drag 18,000 pounds.

Legendary Bear

The  legendary  bear  doesnt  usually  attack  humans  de-

spite  its  great  strength.  Its  diet  consists  primarily  of

plants and fish.

Combat

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the legendary

bear must hit with a claw attack.

Legendary Tiger

The legendary tiger is the fiercest and most dangerous

land predator in the animal kingdom. It measures 810

feet long and weighs up to 600 pounds.

42

Combat

Pounce  (Ex):  If  a  legendary  tiger  leaps  upon  a  foe

during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack

even if it has already taken a move action.

Improved Crab (Ex): To use this ability, the legendary

tiger must first hit with a bite attack. If it succeeds, it has

grabbed its prey and can then rake.

Rake  (Ex):  A  legendary  tiger  can  make  two  attacks

(+29 melee) against a held creature with its hind legs for

2d6+5  points  of  damage  each.  If  the  legendary  tiger

pounces on an opponent, it can also rake.

Skills: A legendary tiger receives a +8 racial bonus on

both  Hide  and  Move  Silently  checks.  *In  areas  of  tall

grasses or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves

to +16.

Legendary Shark

The legendary shark hunts anything it finds in the sea.

Combat

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the legendary

shark must hit with a bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can

try to swallow the foe.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A legendary shark can try to

swallow a grabbed opponent of Large or smaller size by

making a successful grapple check. Once inside the leg-

endary  shark,  the  opponent  takes  2d8+13  points  of

crushing damage plus 1d8+4 points of acid damage per

round from the creatures digestive juices. A swallowed

creature can climb out of the stomach with a successful

grapple  check. This  returns it to  the legendary sharks

mouth,  where  another  successful  grapple  check  is

needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut its

way out by dealing 50 or more points of damage to the

stomach (AC 18) with claws or a Tiny slashing weapon.

Once  that  swallowed  creature  exits,  muscular  action

closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its

own way out.

The  sharks  gullet  holds  up  to  two  Large,  three

Medium-size, four Small, eight Tiny, sixteen Diminutive,

or thirty-two Fine or smaller opponents.

Keen Scent (Ex): A legendary shark notices creatures

by  scent  in  a  180-foot  radius  and  detects  blood  in  the

water at ranges of up to a mile.

ANIMAL LORD

For the animal lord, a humanoid form is simply an ac-

cident  of  birth.  In  spirit,  she  belongs  with  the  wild

pack  of  wolves,  the  running  herd  of  horses,  or  the

dancing school of fish. Her nearly hairless, two-legged

form  is  just  a  hindrance  to  being  one

with her true kind, but it is a hindrance

she can overcome.

Each  animal  lord  forms  a  bond  with

one  group  of  animals.  Apelords,  bear-

lords,  birdlords,  catlords,  equinelords,

marinelords,  snakelords,  and  wolflords

all  exist.  Animals  in  her  selected  group

accept  the  animal  lord  as  a  sister  and  a

leader. They offer her their support, and

she in turn watches over them.

Individual animal lords may approach

their calling in very different ways. Some

are simple defenders of their kind, con-

tent to live as part of the natural cycle of

predator and prey. Others, believing that

natures creatures are meant to guard and

lord,  the  foe  hunter,  and  the

king/queen of the wildhave a

special rule. They each require a

specialization  that  defines  the

characters focus. For example,

a character who becomes a foe

hunter  must  select  a  hated

enemy. This choice defines her

classa  hater  of  goblins

becomes a goblin hunter, for ex-

ample. Similarly, an animal lord

with a bond to cats is a catlord.

A queen of the wild who has fo-

cused on deserts is a queen of

the desert.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

the  burdens  of  the  humanoid  form.  Halflings  and

gnomes  rarely  become  animal  lords  because  of  their

strong community ties, and half-orcs are even less likely

to  do  so  because  of their  typically  rapacious  attitudes.

Though  rangers,  druids,  and  barbarians  are  the  most

likely characters to adopt this class, some arcane spell-

casters (especially bards) choose to become animal lords

late in their adventuring careers.

A character can choose this prestige class more than

once but must select a different group of associated ani-

mals and start at 1st level each time. Levels of different

animal lord classes do not stack when determining level-

based class features.

Eight animal lords are presented here (the DM is free

to create others). The various kinds of animals from the

Monster Manual they are associated with are as follows.

Apelord: ape, baboon, monkey.

Bearlord: black bear, brown bear, polar bear.

Birdlord: eagle, hawk, owl, raven.

Catlord: cat, cheetah, leopard, lion, tiger.

Equinelord:  donkey,  heavy  horse,  heavy  warhorse.

light horse, light warhorse, mule, pony, warpony.

Marinelord: crocodile, giant crocodile, octopus, giant oc-

topus, porpoise, shark (all), squid, giant squid, whale (all).

Snakelord: constrictor, giant constrictor, viper (all).

Wolflord: dog, riding dog, wolf.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To become an animal lord, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria.

Alignment:  Neutral  good,  lawful  neutral,  neutral,

chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.

Skills: Animal Empathy 6 ranks, Wilderness Lore 8

ranks, plus 2 ranks in the appropriate skill from the fol-

lowing  list:  ApelordClimb;  BearlordIntimidate;

BirdlordIntuit  Direction;  CatlordMove  Silently:

EquinelordJump;  Marinelord,Swim;  Snakelord

the following list: Apelord, Skill Focus (Climb); Bearlord,

Power  Attack;  Birdlord,  Improved  Flight;  Catlord.

Weapon  Finesse  (any);  Equinelord,  Run;  Marinelord.

Skill Focus (Swim); Snakelord, Resist Poison; Wolflord.

Expertise.

Class Skills

The animal lords class skills (and the key ability tor each

skill) are Animal Empathy (Cha, exclusive skill), Climb

(Str),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Hide  (Dex),

Intuit Direction (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Jump

(Str),  Listen (Wis),  Spellcraft  (Int),  Spot  (Wis),  Swim

(Str), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the animal lord pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Animal lords gain

no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells:  An animal  lord can  cast  a  small  number  of

divine spells. Her spells are based on Wisdom, so casting

any given spell requires a Wisdom score of at least 10 -

the spells level. The DC tor saving throws against these

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

spells is 10 + spell level + the animal lords Wisdom mod-

ifier. When the table indicates that the animal lord is en-

titled to 0 spells of a given level (such as 0 1st-level spells

at  1st  level),  she  gets  only  those  bonus  spells  that  her

Wisdom score allows. An animal lord prepares and casts

spells just like a druid does, but she must choose them

from the spell list below.

Animal Bond: Beginning at 1st level, the animal lord

develops a bond with animals of her selected group (see

above).  For  instance,  the  bearlord  bonds  with  brown

bears, black bears, and polar bears, and the apelord with

monkeys, baboons, and apes. The marinelords bond ex-

tends to porpoises, whales, and other aquatic mammals

as well as fish. Because of this bond, all animals of the ap-

propriate  kinds  automatically  have  a  friendly  attitude

toward the animal lord.

Animal bond also allows the animal lord to have one or

more  animal  companions  chosen  from  among  her  se-

lected group. This aspect of animal bond is a spell-like

ability  that  functions like  the druids animal  friendship

spell, except that the animal lord can acquire compan-

ions only from among her selected group, and her maxi-

mum Hit Dice of animal companions (whether or not

she adventures) equals twice her animal lord level. The

character can train these animal companions just as the

druid does (see Chapter 4 for details).

Animal Sense (Su): At 1st level, an animal lord can

sense any animals of her selected group within a radius

of miles equal to her animal lord level squared. For ex-

ample, a 6th-level bearlord can sense brown bears, black

bears, and polar bears within thirty-six miles. This ability

does not allow the character to communicate with the

animals she senses.

Animal Speech (Ex): At 2nd level, an animal lord can

converse at will with any animals of her selected group as

though a speak with animals spell were in effect. The crea-

tures responses, of course, are limited by their intelli-

gence and perceptions.

rently using with a number of willing individuals equal

to her animal lord level. This effect is identical to that of

the polymorph  other  spell,  except  that  its  duration  is  1

hour per animal lord level.

Second Totem: At  5th  level,  an  animal  lord  gains  a

benefit related to her selected group from the list below.

efit related to her selected group from the list below.

Animal Lord Spell List

1st  levelalarm,  animal trick*, culm animals,  camou-

flage*, cure lighl wounds, defect animals or plants, pass without

trace, purify food and drink, speak with animals.

2nd  leveladrenaline surge*,  animal  reduction*,  cure

selected animal type as she rises in level.

lord can use it as often as desired. At 7th level, an animal

lord  can  use  this  ability  to  adopt  the dire  form  of  an

animal in her selected group, and at 10th level, she can

use it to adopt the legendary form of an animal in her se-

lected group.

this ability twice per day, and at 8th level, she can use it

to summon 1d3 dire animals of her selected group.

Third Totem: The apelord gains the spell-like ability

to scare by howling, hooting, and beating her chest. The

Will save DC against this ability is 10 + the apelords class

level  +  her  Charisma  modifier.  In  all  other  ways,  this

effect is identical to the scare spell.

Bearlord

First Totem: The bearlord gains a +2 inherent bonus

to Strength.

Second Totem: The bearlord gains Great Fortitude as

a bonus feat.

Third Totem: The bearlord gains damage reduction

2/. It she already has damage reduction, this does not

stack with it.

Birdlord

First Totem: The birdlord gains a +2 inherent bonus to

Dexterity.

Second Totem: The birdlord  gains  a  +8  conditional

bonus on Spot checks made in daylight.

Third Totem:  The birdlord  gains  Improved  Critical

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Catlord

First Totem:  The  catlord  gains  Skill  Focus  (Move

Silently) as a bonus feat.

Second Totem: Once per hour, the catlord can use the

sprint  extraordinary  ability  to  move  at  ten  times  her

normal speed as a charge action.

Third Totem: The catlord gains a +2 inherent bonus to

infidels  and his  tribe.  Usually  visitors  and  conquered

foes serve as sacrifices, though in a pinch a criminal will

do (or even an innocent, though this a risky move).

Though  he  is  often  ruthless,  the  bane  of  infidels  is

nonetheless respected by the  members of his tribe, to

whom he provides healing, guardianship, and unwaver-

ing direction in return for absolute loyalty. Druids are the

most likely characters to embrace this lifestyle, though

clerics, high-level rangers, and adepts can also adopt this

prestige  class. The  tribe  of  a  bane  of  infidels  often  in-

cludes fighters, rangers, barbarians, bards, and sorcerers,

but other classes may not be as welcome.

Second Totem: The  equinelord  gains  a  +2  inherent

bonus to Constitution.

Third Totem:  The  equinelord  gains Trample  as  a

bonus feat.

Marinelord

First Totem: The marinelord gains the extraordinary

ability to breathe water in her normal form. (She cannot,

however, breathe  air  while  in  a  form  that  can  breathe

only water.)

Second Totem:  The  marinelord  gains  Improved

Swimming (see Chapter 2) as a bonus feat.

Third Totem:  The  marinelord  gains  a  +2  inherent

bonus to Wisdom.

Snakelord

First Totem: The snakelord gains Resist Poison (see

Chapter 2) as a bonus feat.

Second Totem: The snakelord gains the extraordinary

ability to produce poison once per day (Fortitude save

DC  10  +  class  level;  initial and  secondary damage 2d6

temporary Constitution). She can produce only one dose

of poison per day. The snakelord is skilled in the use of

poison  and  never  risks  accidentally  poisoning  herself

when applying poison to a blade.

Third Totem:  The  snakelord  gains  a  +2  inherent

bonus to Charisma.

Wolflord

First Totem: The wolflord gains Scent (see Chapter 2)

as a bonus feat.

Second Totem: The wolflord gains a +4 circumstance

bonus  on Wilderness  Lore  checks  made  for  tracking.

This bonus stacks with any modifier provided by Scent.

Third Totem: The wolflord gains a +2 inherent bonus

to Constitution.

BANE OF INFIDELS

The bane of infidels is the leader of a xenophobic tribe.

He wants nothing to do with the outside world because

the way his people do things is the way they have always

done them, and the way they always will. Alone among

his compatriots, the bane of infidels sees the possibilities

of the outside world, but he considers progress danger-

ous. Allowing his people to advance would surely endan-

ger them and imperil his leadership. Since visitors bring

danger of change, they must dieand what better way

than as sacrifices in the name of his tribes religion?

The act of sacrifice empowers and rewards the bane of

Requirements

To become a bane of infidels, a character must fulfill the

following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills:  Intimidate  4  ranks;  Knowledge  (religion)  6

ranks or Knowledge (nature) 6 ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, Leadership.

Spells: Able to cast 3rd-level divine spells.

Class Skills

The bane of infidelss class skills (and the key ability for

each  skill)  are  Animal  Empathy  (Cha),  Concentration

(Con), Craft  (any)  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Handle

Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Intuit Di-

rection (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (re-

ligion) (Int), Profession (any) (Wis), Scry (Int, exclusive

skill), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str),

and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Player's

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the bane of infidens

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A bane of infidels

gains no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each bane of infi-

dels level,  the character gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level

in  a  spellcasting  class  to  which  he  belonged  before

adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any

other benefit a character of that class would have gained

(additional  wild  shape  options, metamagic or item cre-

ation feats, or the like), if the character had more than

one spellcasting class before becoming a bane of infidels,

the player must decide to which class to add each level

for determining spells per day and spells known.

nergumen

nergumen (Sp): Beginning at 1st level, the character

MASTERS Guide) who is an adherent of the same religion

The follower gains a +2 bonus to both Strength and Con-

stitution, as well as a +1 morale bonus on Will saves. In

all other respects, this effect is like barbarian rage. Ener-

gumen is usable once per day per bane of infidels level.

grossly violated the code of conduct that the bane of infi-

dels has established or otherwise acted in a manner op-

posed to the latters purposes and directions in the last 24

hours, the bane of infidels discovers it (no save, but spell re-

sistance applies) and gains a +5 circumstance bonus on his

Diplomacy check when sacrificing that follower. Using

detect loyalty does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Major Sacrifice (Su): This ability, gained at 5th level,

is like sacrifice, except that the bane of infidels can in-

crease his effective caster level for all spells by +4 for 1

hour by sacrificing a sentient creature with 5 or more Hit

Dice. This effect does not stack with that of sacrifice or

mass sacrifice.

duces the same effect as the wall of thorns spell, except as

follows. The thorny briars form a humanoid shape 10 feet

square, with a height equal to 10 feet per bane of infidels

level. Anyone in that area when the wicker man appears

gets  a  Reflex  save  (DC  10  +  bane  of  infidels  level +

Wisdom bonus of bane of infidels) to avoid being caught

in its body at a point halfway up its height. The pyre and

bonfire abilities of the bane of infidels count as magical

fire for purposes of igniting the wicker man and do their

normal damage to everyone trapped inside each round

until the wicker man burns away (per the wall of thorns

spell) or they escape. This ability is usable once per day.

Bonfire e e e e (Sp): This ability, gained at 7th level, functions

24 hours.

imum of +10) for each humanoid sacrificed within 10

rounds. This ability is otherwise like sacrifice. Its effect

otection (Sp): At 2nd level, the bane of infidels

may perform an 8-hour ritual to designate an area with a

radius of up to 5 feet per bane of infidels level as a hearth.

This  area  then  functions  as  a  permanent  zone  of  truth,

though the bane of infidels is immune to that effect. The

character may have only one hearth at a time.

Sacrifice (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, the bane of in-

fidels may sacrifice any humanoid by killing it  with  a

coup de grace in his hearth. This ritual increases his ef-

fective caster level for all spells by +2 for 1 hour. If the

bane  of  infidels  sacrifices  a  follower,  he  must  make  a

Diplomacy check (DC 20). Failure indicates that all his

remaining  followers  desert;  success  means  he  retains

their loyalty. This effect does not stack with the bonuses

gained from major sacrifice or mass sacrifice (see below).

Sacrifice is usable once per day.

BLIGHTER

When a druid turns away from the land, the land turns

away  from  her.  Some  ex-druids  make  peace  with  this

change; others seek to restore the bond. A few, however,

actually embrace their  disconnection  from  nature  and

become forces of destruction. These few, called blighters,

leave their mark wherever they tread.

A blighter gains her spellcasting ability by stripping

the earth of life. A swath of deForested land always marks

her path through the wilderness.

The  vast  majority  of  blighters  are  no-

madic loners constantly in search

of  green  lands  to  destroy.  Some

are grim; others laugh at the de-

struction they wreak. Almost all,

however,  are  friendless  and

mad.  What  puts  them  over  the

edge is the knowledge that nature

gets the last laugh: To gain their

spells,  they  must  seek  out  the

richest Forests of the land, even

if  its  only  to  destroy  them.

Thus,  even  though  theyve

turned away from nature, they

must constantly return to it.

Only  human  ex-druids

seem attracted in any num-

ber  to  the  blighters  path.

Legends say that a few elven

druids  have  also  turned  to

destruction  over  the  millen-

niaa  terrifying  prospect

given  how  much  land  they

could destroy in their long

lifetimes.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To  qualify  as  a  blighter,  a

character  must  fulfill  the

following criteria.

Alignment:  Any  non-

good.

Special: The character must be an ex-druid previously

capable of casting 3rd-level druid spells.

Class Skills

The  blighters  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill) are Animal Empathy (Cha), Concentration (Con),

Craft (any) (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha),

Heal (Wis), Intuit Direction (Wis), Knowledge (nature)

(Int), Profession (herbalist) (Wis), Scry (Int), Spellcraft

(Int), Swim (Str), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter

4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the blighter prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Blighters gain no

weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells  per  Day:  At  each

blighter  level,  the  character

gains spells per day according

to Table  53.  She  does  not,

however, gain any other bene-

fit  that  a  druid  of  that  level

would  have  gained.  She  must

choose her spells from the blighter

spell  list,  below. The blighters  caster

level is equal to her blighter level plus

her druid level.

The  blighter gains ac-

cess to her daily spells

through  deforestation

(see  below),  if  she

goes more than 24

hours  without

deforesting  a

wooded

area,

she  cannot  cast

spells until  she

does so.

The  default  divine

focus for any spell cast

by a blighter is a desic-

cated  sprig  of  holly  or

estation (Sp): Beginning at 1st level, the blighter

can kill all nonsentient plant life within a radius of 50 feet

per blighter level as a full-round action once per day. If a

potentially affected plant is under the control of another

(such as a druids liveoak or a dryads home tree), the con-

troller can make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blighter level +

blighters Wisdom bonus) to keep it alive. Affected plants

immediately cease photosynthesis, root tapping, and all

other methods of sustenance. Like picked flowers, they

appear vibrant for several hours, but within a day, they

turn brown and wither. Except for plants saved by a con-

troller, nothing can grow in a deforested area until it has

a hallow spell cast upon it and it is reseeded.

Deforestation enables the blighter to cast her daily allot-

ment of spells. This ability works in any terrain, but de-

Foresting a sandy desert, ice floe, or other environment

with only sparse vegetation does not empower the char-

acter to cast spells.

Burning Hands (Su): This ability, gained at 2nd level,

functions  like  the  burning  hands spell,  except  that  the

blighter can use it as often as desired, turning it on or off

as a move-equivalent action, and it does 1d4 points of fire

damage per round.

Sustenance (Ex): At 2nd level, the blighter no longer

needs food or water to survive.

are those of undead creatures (specifically skeletons) for-

merly of the animal type. A skeletal animal has the sta-

tistics  of  a  skeleton  of  the  appropriate  animals  size

category (see the skeleton entry in the Monster Manual).

The blighter gains one extra use per day of this ability

for every two additional blighter levels she acquires. In

addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large

skeletal animal  at  5th  level,  an  incorporeal  skeletal

animal (see Incorporeality in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide) at 7th level, and a Huge skeletal animal at

except that it affects only corpses of animal creatures. It

is usable once per day.

nbond (Sp): At 8th level, the blighter can temporarily

separate a bonded animal or magical beast (such as an

animal companion, familiar, or mount) from its master

once per day. The target creature must be within 40 feet

ot both its master and the blighter. It the master fails a

Will save (DC 10 + blighter level + blighters Wisdom

modifier), the bond terminates as if the servitor had died,

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

though this does not cause experience loss in the case of

a familiar. Normally hostile creatures attack their mas-

ters but are otherwise unaffected. The bond returns after

5 rounds per blighter level, restoring all benefits. Alter-

natively, the master can regain the servitor through the

normal methods of acquisition.

Plague (Su): At 10th level, the blighter can spread dis-

ease over a large area. This ability functions like the con-

tagious touch ability, except that no attack roll is required

and it affects all targets the blighter designates within a

20-foot radius. Plague is usable once per day and costs

one daily use of the contagious touch ability.

BLOODHOUND

A bandit king is raiding caravans on the road. An ogre is

pillaging  the  farms  to  the  north.  A  sorcerer  has  kid-

napped the mayors son and hidden him somewhere in

the marsh. And the soldiers of the king cannot seem to

stem the tide. The terrified citizens have only one choice,

and it isnt cheap. They call in a bloodhound.

The bloodhound tracks down wrongdoers and brings

them to whatever justice awaits them. Low-level blood-

hounds depend on their keen senses and careful training

to hunt their targets. As they gain experience, their ob-

sessive determination gives them supernatural abilities

that make them nearly unstoppable.

Most bloodhounds work for money (usually a lot of it),

but some accept jobs for justice, revenge, or enjoyment.

When  a  bloodhound  accepts  a  job,  he  designates  his

target as a mark. Thereafter, he does not abandon the case

until it is finished, which occurs when the mark is appre-

hended or when either the mark or the bloodhound dies.

Though some bloodhounds leave calling cards or even

brands on their marks, most dont kill their targets if they

can help it. They prefer instead to subdue their marks

and  bring  them  in.  For  those  ot  good  alignment,  this

practice satisfies some deeply held belief in the cause of

justice.  For  neutral  and  evil  bloodhounds,  it  ensures  a

steady stream of income from catching the same marks

over and over when they break out of jail.

Rangers and barbarians make the best bloodhounds,

but rogues, bards, druids, and fighters can also excel in

this role. Occasionally a paladin shoulders the mantle,

but  never  for  money.  Most  bloodhounds  are  human,

though elves and half-elves sometimes find this lifestyle

satisfying. Some of the best bloodhounds are humanoids

such as gnolls, hobgoblins, and bugbears.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills

The bloodhounds class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplo-

macy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Forgery (Dex), Gather Infor-

mation (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha),

Intuit Direction (Wis), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently  (Dex),  Open  Lock  (Dex),  Ride  (Dex),  Search

(Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Use

Rope (Dex), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4 of

the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

Requirements

To become a bloodhound, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria.

Class Features

The following are class features of the bloodhound pres-

tige class.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills:  Gather  Information  4  ranks,  Move

Silently 4 ranks, Wilderness Lore 4 ranks.

Feats: Run, Track.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Bloodhounds are

proficient with light armor, shields, and both simple and

martial weapons.

Determination (Ex): At 1st level, the character gains

an insight bonus equal to his bloodhound level on Gather

Information, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks made to

determine the whereabouts of a mark (see below).

Mark  (Ex):  At  1st  level,  the  character  can  target,  or

mark, an individual humanoid foe. To do so, the blood-

hound must focus on a foe who is present and visible, or

on the depiction or description of one who is not, for 10

minutes. Any interruption ruins the attempt and forces

the  bloodhound  to  start  the  process  again.  Once this

study is complete, that target is called a mark, and the

bloodhound receives a variety of advantages against him

or her (see below). A bloodhound may have up to one

mark per two bloodhound levels (rounded up) at once,

but only if all of them are within 30 feet of one another

for the duration of the marking process. For example, a

6th-level bloodhound could mark three bugbears in such

a group, but not a bugbear on one side of the kingdom

and a troll on the other. If a bloodhound chooses a new

mark before apprehending an existing one, the latter is

unmarked,  and  the  bloodhound  loses  XP  equal  to  the

amount he would have gotten for defeating that creature.

The bloodhound can mark an individual once a week.

No Subdual Penalty (Ex): Also at 1st level, the blood-

hound can use a melee weapon that deals normal damage

to  deal  subdual  damage  instead  without  suffering  the

usual 4 penalty on his attack roll.

Dead  or  Alive  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  the  bloodhound

learns to strike for subdual at just the right moment to

50

avoid killing a mark. Immediately after striking a blow

that would reduce a mark from positive to negative hit

points, the bloodhound may convert the normal damage

dealt  by  that  blow  to  subdual  damage  before  it  takes

effect. The  bloodhound  cannot  use  this  ability  while

raging or after 1 round has passed.

Fast Tracking:  At  2nd  level,  the  bloodhound  no

longer suffers a 5 penalty on Wilderness Lore checks

for tracking while moving at normal speed.

Ready and Waiting (Ex): Also at 2nd level, the blood-

hound may, as a free action, designate a particular move-

equivalent,  standard,  or  full-round  action  that  a  mark

who  is  flat-footed  might  perform,  if  the  mark  actually

performs this action within 10 minutes thereafter, the

bloodhound can make an attack of opportunity against

him or her with a drawn weapon, either melee or ranged.

This counts against the bloodhounds attacks of opportu-

nity for that round.

Facekeeping (Ex): At 3rd level, a bloodhound track-

ing a mark can raise his own speed by up to +5 feet per

bloodhound  level,  to  a  maximum  value  equal  to  the

marks speed.

Restlessness  (Ex):  When  the  bloodhound  reaches

3rd level, he gains damage reduction 5/ against subdual

damage from a forced march while in pursuit of a mark.

Improved  Subdual  (Ex):  At  4th  level,  the  blood-

hound uses his Intelligence bonus on the damage roll for

any attack that deals only subdual damage.

Move Like the Wind (Su):  At 4th level, the blood-

hound  ignores  armor  check  penalties  on  his  Move

Silently and Hide checks. In addition, he no longer suf-

fers  the  5  penalty  on  those  checks  when  moving  at

speeds between half and full.

Traceless Track  (Su):  At  5th  level,  the  bloodhound

can track a creature moving under the influence of pass

without trace or a similar effect, though he suffers a 10

circumstance penalty on his Wilderness Lore checks.

Shatter (Su): At 5th level, the bloodhound can destroy

an  object  that  stands  between  himself  and his  mark

when the latter is within 100 feet. This ability functions

like  a  shatter  spell  cast  by  a  sorcerer  of  the  characters

bloodhound level.

Ignore  Scrying  (Ex):  At  6th  level,  the  bloodhound

gains spell resistance equal to 10 + his bloodhound level

against divination spells. This stacks with any other spell

resistance he has that includes spells of that school.

eature e e e e (Sp): Once per day, the bloodhound can

produce an effect identical to that of a locate creature spell

Fracture (Su): At 7th level, the character can use his

shatter ability to destroy weight-equivalent portions of

larger objects, such as doors and walls, regardless of their

construction.

See Invisibility (Su): This ability, gained at 7th level,

functions like a see invisibility spell, except that it is con-

stantly in effect and it reveals only marks.

Subdual  Resistance:  At  8th  level,  the  bloodhound

gains damage reduction 20/+3 against subdual damage.

Ignore Magical Barriers (Ex): At 9th level, the blood-

hound  gains  spell  resistance  equal  to  15  +  his  blood-

hound  level  against  magical  barriers  (wall  of  force,

entangle, prismatic wall, and so forth).

Organization: The Bloodhounds

Eyes... I saw his eyes before he pounced. That was all. He had

no body until he was upon me. if he had meant to kill me, I

would have been as helpless as a babe.

Tordek, on meeting a Bloodhound

The  organization  known  as  the  Bloodhounds  is  dedi-

cated to finding people and bringing them to justice (or

whatever  fate  awaits  them).  Some  Bloodhounds  limit

themselves to tracking down criminals; others are will-

ing to hunt anyone for a client who can pay the price.

The groups leaders dont concern themselves with such

issues, only with maintaining the organizations reputa-

tion as the place to go to find someone.

Membership in the Bloodhounds is by invitation only.

Members report on capable trackers they encounter in

their travels, and from these reports the organizations

leaders select candidates for membership. A member of

the  organization  tracks  each  candidate  surreptitiously

for a while. If the Bloodhound reports that the candidate

had  the  necessary fervor  and  talents, the  leaders  offer

him or her a chance to try out for membership. A candi-

date who actually noticed the Bloodhound following is

almost guaranteed an offer.

To be accepted for membership, the candidate must

track  a  Bloodhound  considerably  more  experienced

than himself. The Bloodhound makes the job difficult

by leaving false trails, telling locals deceitful stories, and

even hiring brigands to ambush the candidate along the

way. The Bloodhound must not assist the candidate in

this task; otherwise the test is void. A candidate who suc-

ceeds in finding the target passes the test and may join

the organization.

Bloodhounds can take any assignments they choose.

Some jobs come directly from clients who contact indi-

vidual  Bloodhounds.  Others  come  through  the

grapevine, since members pass word to each other. Indi-

vidual bloodhounds are fiercely competitive, and should

one succeed where another has failed, the winner gloats

over  the  victory.  In  fact,  Bloodhounds  often  tell  each

other  about  the  assignments  theyve  taken,  in  effect

challenging  their  compatriots  to  beat  them  to  the

quarry.  Members  may  work  together,  but  most  work

alone or with nonmembers so that word spreads of their

personal  fame. Thus,  whenever  several  Bloodhounds

form  a  posse  to  catch  a  particularly  elusive  foe,  word

spreads far and wide.

Despite this rivalry, when a mark is too important to go

free,  a  Bloodhound  can  spread  the  word  of  a  free

bounty  among  the  membership. This  means  that  any

member  who  brings  in  the  mark  can  claim  the  prize.

Members who spread free bounties lose no face in the

organization for doing so.

Bloodhounds resent the concept of giving their earn-

ings  to  anyone.  Thus,  the  organization  does  not

demand  a  piece  of  its  members  earnings.  No  Blood-

hounds guildhalls or strongholds exist because no self-

51

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

respecting  Bloodhound  would  limit  himself  to  one

base of operations.

Since so many of the Bloodhounds marks are human,

ranger Bloodhounds who have taken humans as favored

enemies have an advantage in assignments. Thus, a large

percentage of the membership is nonhuman, and differ-

ing alignments are rarely an impediment to teaming up.

In fact, rumor has it that a good elven Bloodhound and

an evil gnoll Bloodhound regularly work together, since

between them they can function in any society. The gulf

between their alignments is simply not as wide as the

bridge of their common goals.

DEEPWOOD SNIPER

An arrow flies from a high mountain aerie, unerringly

striking a paladins mount. Expecting only a flesh wound,

the  paladin  is  stunned  to  watch  his  companion  of

many  adventures  crumple  to  the  earth. This  unfor-

tunate knight has trespassed into the domain of the

deepwood sniper, and he may not make it out alive.

A  deepwood  sniper  is  patient,  careful,  quiet,  and

deadly accurate. She is a stealthy, long-range terminator

whose arrows sail accurately from much longer ranges

than those of other archers. In addition, she has magical

abilities to help her shafts fly true.

Because  of their  alertness,  dexterity,  patience,  and

affinity for the bow, elves of almost any character class

make excellent deepwood snipers. For a long time, elves

would train only those of their own race in these tech-

niques, but more recently some half-elves, halflings, and

humans have joined the ranks of the deepwood sniper.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify as a deepwood sniper, a character must fulfill

the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills:  Hide  4  ranks,  Move  Silently  4  ranks,  Spot  4

bow or crossbow).

Class Skills

The deepwood snipers class skills (and the key ability tor

each  skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Climb  (Str),  Craft  (bow-

making)  (Int),  Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Intuit  Direction

(Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge

(nature) (Int). Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profes-

sion (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis),

Swim (Str), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4 of

the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the deepwood sniper

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Deepwood snipers

Keen  Arrows  (Ex):  At  1st  level,  all  projectiles  the

deepwood sniper fires behave as if they were keen weap-

ons in addition to any other properties they might pos-

sess. Thus, a normal arrow fired by a deepwood sniper

has a threat range of 1920 instead of 20. This effect does

not stack with any other keen effect.

Range Increment Bonus (Ex): With each level the

deepwood  sniper  gains,  the  range  increments  of  her

projectile weapons increase by +10 feet (added after all

multipliers). Thus,  a  10th-level  deepwood  sniper  who

has the Far Shot feat would have a 280-foot range incre-

ment with a heavy crossbow (120 feet x 1.5 + 100 feet).

Concealment Reduction (Ex): When the deepwood

sniper reaches 2nd level, her miss chance against oppo-

nents with concealment drops by 10%. Thus, she has a

miss chance of 10% rather than 20% against an opponent

with one-half concealment. Her miss chance drops by

an additional 10% per tour deepwood sniper levels she

gains thereafter, but this ability never reduces her miss

chance against any opponent below 0%.

produce an effect identical to that of a magic weapon spell

is usable once per day on projectile weapons only.

Projectile Improved Critical (Ex): When the deep-

wood sniper reaches 2nd level, the critical damage mul-

tipliers  of  all  her  projectile  weapons  increase  by  +1.

Thus, an arrow that normally deals damage 3 on a crit-

ical hit instead does damage 4 in her hands. When she

reaches 7th level, these critical multipliers increase by

an additional +1.

Safe Poison Use (Ex): At 3rd level, a deepwood sniper

can use poison without any chance of poisoning herself

(see Perils of Using Poison in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide).

Take Aim (Ex): A 4th-level deepwood sniper can gain

a +2 bonus on her attack rolls against a stationary target

by aiming carefully. Taking aim is a full-round action, and

if the target moves more than 5 feet during that period,

the bonus is lost. No additional benefit exists for spend-

ing more than 1 round aiming. This bonus increases to

+4 at 8th level.

Consistent Aim (Su): Once per day, a 5th-level deep-

wood sniper can reroll one attack roll that she has just

made  with  a  projectile  weapon.  She  must  keep  that

result, even if it is worse than the original roll. She can

use this ability twice per day at 7th level and three times

per day at 10th level, though each use must relate to a dif-

ferent attack roll.

the unvoiced motto of the exotic weapon mastera stu-

dent of her worlds most unusual and bizarre weapons.

For  the  exotic  weapon  master,  the  intricacies  of  the

shuriken, the siangham, the dire flail, and the hand cross-

bow pose no difficulty at all. These unusual weapons are

her trade, and in her hands, they become instruments of

destruction.

Characters  of  any  race  or  background  can  become

exotic weapon masters; the only real requirement is com-

mitment  and  perseverance.  Nevertheless,  most  are

human, because members of that race have the most ex-

posure to new cultures and thus the most opportunities

to take up exotic weapons.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To  become an exotic weapon  master, a character must

fulfill the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Feats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (any three).

Special: Ability to rage.

Class Skills

The exotic weapon masters class skills (and the key abil-

ity  for  each  skill)  are  Craft  (any) (Int)  and  Profession

(any) (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The  following  are  class  features  of the  exotic  weapon

master prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:  Exotic  weapon

masters gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Partial  Exotic  Proficiency:  At  1st  level,  the  exotic

weapon master can use any exotic weapon with which

she is not already proficient at a 2 penalty instead of a 4

penalty on the attack roll. This penalty is reduced to 1 at

2nd level.

Full Exotic Proficiency: At 3rd level, the exotic weapon

master becomes proficient with all exotic weapons.

Improvised Throwing Weapons:  At 3rd  level,  the

exotic weapon master can use artisans tools to fashion a

usable throwing weapon from any object (rock, branch,

melee weapon, or the like) that she can lift. This process

takes at least 1 hour, or more if conditions are poor. The

range increment for such an improvised weapon is 10

feet. It deals 1d6 points of damage (2 on a critical hit),

and its threat range is 20. The exotic weapon master is au-

tomatically  proficient  with  her  improvised  throwing

weapon; anyone else who wishes to use it must spend an

Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat to avoid the 4 nonprofi-

ciency  penalty.  Most  objects  do  bludgeoning  damage;

sharp items do piercing damage instead.

Exotic Focus: At 4th level, the exotic weapon master

gains  a  +1  bonus  on  her  attack  rolls  when  using  any

exotic weapon. This bonus does not stack with that pro-

vided by the Weapon Focus feat.

Improvised Melee Weapons: Also at 4th level, the

exotic weapon master can use artisans tools to fashion a

usable melee weapon from any object (rock, branch, pro-

jectile weapon, or the like) that she can lift. This process

takes at least 1 hour, or more if conditions are poor. Such

an improvised melee weapon deals 1d6 points of damage

(2 on a critical hit), and its threat range is 20. The exotic

weapon master is automatically proficient with her im-

provised melee weapon; anyone else who wishes to use it

must spend an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat to avoid

the 4 nonproficiency penalty. Most objects do bludg-

eoning damage; sharp items do piercing damage instead.

Long  items  (such  as  ladders)  have  reach  according  to

their length, and items with many protrusions (such as

chairs)  give  the  exotic  weapon  master  a  +2  bonus  on

disarm attempts.

Exotic Specialization: At 5th level, the exotic weap-

on master gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when using

any  exotic  weapon.  (For ranged weapons, this  damage

bonus applies only if the target is within 30 feet.) This

modifier  does  not  stack  with  that  provided  by  the

Weapon Specialization feat.

Greater  Improvised  Weapons:  At  5th  level,

the  exotic  weapon  master  can  make  an  impro-

EYE OF GRUUMSH

Most people think theyve seen the worst that orcs can

breed when an orc barbarian comes raging over a hill-

topat  least  until  they  see  a  one-eyed  orc  barbarian

come raging over a hilltop. This creature may well be an

eye of Gruumsh, an orc so devoted to his evil deity thai

he has disfigured himself in Gruumshs name.

In an epic battle at the dawn of time, the elven deity

Corellon Larethian stabbed out Gruumshs left eye. Filled

with rage and hatred, the orc deity called for followers

loyal enough to serve in his image. Those who heed this

call are known as the eyes of Gruumsh. They sacrifice

their right eyes instead of their left ones so that their im-

paired vision balances that of their deity. Thus, symboli-

cally at least, they can see what he cannot. These living

martyrs to Gruumsh are some of the toughest orcs and

half-orcs in the world.

The  eye  of  Gruumsh  is  a  true  prestige  class  in  the

sense that all orcs respect those who achieve it. If a can-

didate  proves  capable  with  the  brutal  orc  double  axe

and has no moral code to stand in the way of his serv-

ice, only the test remainsto put out his own right eye

in a special ceremony. This is a bloody and painful ritu-

al, the details of which are best left undescribed. If the

candidate  makes  a  sound  during

the  process,  he  fails  the  test.

consequences

for

failure  exist,  except

that  he  can  never

become  an  eye  of

Gruumsh  

and  hes  lost

one eye.

No

54

Barbarians gain the most value from this prestige class,

since it encourages raging as a fighting style. Fighters,

clerics, rangers, and even rogues also heed this calling.

orcs  and  half-orcs  are  the  obvious  candidates  for  the

class,  and  some  orc  tribes  whisper  of  barbarians  from

other  races  who  have  adopted  this  mantle.  Of  course,

these may just be legends meant to inspire young orcs to

jealous rage.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify as an eye of Grummsh, a charac-

ter must fulfill the following criteria.

Race: orc or half-orc. (A character of

another race who grows up among orcs

may also adopt this prestige class if the

DM permits.)

Alignment:  Chaotic  evil,  chaotic

neutral, or neutral evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Feats:  Exotic  Weapon  Profi-

ciency  (orc  double  axe), Weapon

Focus (orc double axe).

Special:  The  character

must be a worshiper of Gru-

umsh  and  must  put  out

his  own  right  eye  in  a

special  ritual.  None  of

the  eye  of  Gruumshs

special abilities  func-

tion if he regains sight

in both eyes.

Class Skills

The eye of Gruumshs class

skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Intimidate (Cha),

Jump (Str), Ride (Dex), and Swim

(Str). See Chapter 4 of the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the eye of Gruumsh

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Eyes of Gruumsh

are proficient with light and medium armor, shields, and

all simple and martial weapons.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Blind-Fight: At 1st level, the eye of Gruumsh gains

Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.

Follow Orders Blindly: At 1st level, the eye of Gru-

umsh may grant a +2 morale bonus on Will saves to any

nongood orcs or half-orcs with HD lower than his charac-

ter level within 30 feet of him. Any recipient who willingly

goes against the eye of Gruumshs directions loses this

bonus immediately. Using this ability is a standard action,

and  the  effect  lasts

for  1  hour  per  eye  of

Gruumsh level.

Rage:  Also  at  1st

level,  the  eye  of  Gru-

umsh  gains  the  abili-

ty  to  rage  as  a  barbar-

ian  of  a  level  equal  to

the  total  of  his  bar-

barian  and  eye  of  Gru-

umsh  levels.  Thus,  a

the character provokes attacks of opportunity as though

he were casting a spell whenever he takes any kind of

attack action.

Gruumshs Constitution bonus) is blinded until he or she

can rinse away the spittle. This attack has no effect on

creatures that dont have eyes or dont depend on vision.

Blinding spittle is usable once per hour at 4th level and

twice per hour at 7th level.

Blindsight  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  the  eye  of  Gruumsh

gains blindsight in a 5-foot radius. This ability is other-

wise identical to the hearing-based version described in

the  introduction  of  the  Monster  Manual.  Its  range in-

creases to 10 feet at 8th level.

Sight of Gruumsh: At 10th level, the eye of Gruumsh

sees the moment of his own death through his missing

eye. This foreknowledge gives him a +2 morale bonus on

all  saving  throws  from  then  on.  (Whether  or  not  the

vision is accurate is irrelevantthe character believes it

to be true.)

Organization: The Eyes Of Gruumsh

The cycle of my fathers people is a simple one. You kill, you get

better at killing, and you kill again. Break the cycle, and you die.

Krusk

Though orcs  revere  eyes of  Gruumsh  for  their  unique

clarity of vision, the average eye of Gruumsh isnt partic-

ularly well qualified to think for an entire tribeeven

though he often assumes leadership of a tribe early in his

career. Thus, he relies on a cleric of Gruumsh for wise

counsel. To discourage any unhealthy confusion among

their followers about who is in charge, both the eye of

Gruumsh  and  the  cleric  encourage  war  against  other

races at every opportunity.

Since  eyes  of  Gruumsh  seek  to  avenge  Corellon

Larethians insult to their deity, most are so obsessed with

the destruction of elves that they attack any elven com-

munity  on  sight.  Inspired by their leaders rage,  other

orcs often throw themselves heedlessly at elven hordes.

Multiple eyes of Gruumsh usually dont work well to-

gether  because  they  commonly  have  competing  ideas

about  which  course  of  action  serves  their  deity  best.

Every few decades or so, however, several eyes of Gru-

umsh  get  the  same  idea  in  their  headsa  crusade!

(After all, a holy crusade involving hundreds of tribes

under the  command  of  dozens  of  eyes  of  Gruumsh  is

just the thing to inspire the younger generation to the

deitys service.) When this occurs, the eyes of Gruumsh

meet  and  declare  truces  between  competing  tribes  by

closing  their  functional  left  eyes  all  at  oncethus

blinding them to their own bickering. Then they go out

and try to eradicate some other species.

FOE HUNTER

The foe hunter has but one purpose in life: to kill crea-

tures  of  the  type  she  hates.  She  is  willing  to  pay  any

price or risk any danger to prevail against this hated foe.

Her blade is anathema to such creatures, and her body

is  more  often  than  not  proof  against  their  attacks.

Though her hatred of this enemy is boundless and un-

ending, it is not unthinking or rash. She lives to put an

end to her hated foe, but she does not throw away her

own life needlessly.

The foe hunters path is open to any creature, good or

evil. Some hunt humans or even celestials; others hunt the

foulest spawn of the underworld. NPC foe hunters can be

fierce allies against formidable enemies or implacable op-

ponents dedicated to killing those the heroes love.

A character can choose this prestige class more than

once but must select a different hated enemy and start

again  at  1st  level  each  time.  Levels  of  different  foe

hunter  classes  do  not  stack  when  determining  level-

based class features.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To become a foe hunter, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Feats: Track, Weapon Focus (any).

Language:  The  language  (if  any)  of  the intended

hated enemy.

Special: The character must have a favored enemy.

Class Skills

The foe hunters class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen

(Wis), Ride (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Wilder-

ness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

class.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Hated Enemy Spell Resistance (Ex): Beginning at

4th level, the foe hunter can avoid the effects of spells

and spell-like abilities that would directly affect her, as

long  as  they  originate  from  her  hated  enemy.  Against

such effects, the foe hunter has spell resistance equal to

15 + her foe hunter class level. This stacks with any other

applicable spell resistance the character may have.

Death Attack (Ex): At 10th level, the foe hunter can

make a death attack against a hated enemy that is denied

its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether or not it actually has

one). This ability functions like the assassins death attack

(see  Assassin  in  Chapter  2  of  the  DUNGEON  MASTERS

Guide), except that the foe hunter need only make a melee

attack that successfully does damage, not a sneak attack.

FORSAKER

Magic is evil. Magic tempts. Magic perverts. Magic cor-

rupts. Anyone who cannot embrace these truths has no

business considering the path of the forsaker.

The forsaker rebels against the magic of the fantastic

world around him. Its not that he doesnt believe in it; he

knows full well that magic is real. He has felt its all too

tangible power burn over his skin or wrest control of his

mind from him. While others may ignore the dangers of

magic and succumb to its siren call of power, the forsak-

er knows better. To him, sorcery is nothing but a crutch

that coddles and weakens its users. By depending upon

his own resources alone, the forsaker becomes stronger,

tougher, smarter, and more nimble than any of his com-

panions. To that end, he treads a lonely path, deliberately

depriving himself of magics benefits and destroying any

magic items he finds.

Forsakers  can  take  up  any  standard  or  philosophy,

though they tend more toward chaos than law. Evil for-

sakers hunt down and kill the most powerful users of

magic that they can find, as if to demonstrate the ultimate

weakness of the wizard and the sorcerer. Good forsakers

commit themselves to expunging evil sorcery from their

world, but they too see themselves as examples of how

mundane strength can conquer foul enchantments.

Though  forsakers  do  their  best  to  resist  all  spells

even beneficial onescast upon them, some eventually

learn to tolerate their companions magic. A few claim

that they are leading by example; others rationalize that

only by consorting with lesser villains can they defeat

greater  ones. Whatever  justification  they  use,  the  al-

liance between forsaker and spellcaster, no matter how

temporary or how necessary, is seldom a peaceful one.

Few  characters  other  than  dwarven  fighters  and

human or half-orc barbarians can appreciate the lifestyle

of  the  forsaker.  Elves,  half-elves,  and  gnomes  are  sur-

rounded by the benefits of magic from birth, so they are

unlikely to choose this path. Dwarves, on the other hand,

are  naturally  suspicious  of  sorcery,  and  many  rural

humans are just as distrustful. Certainly, no spellcaster

should consider this career choice, since it means the vir-

tual end of advantages gained from a former class. Even

paladins  and  rangers  must  think  hard  before  leaving

behind their spells and spell-like abilities. Fighters and

rogues occasionally take up this prestige class, but most

forsakers are barbarians. Some say that only such a prim-

57

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Foe hunters gain

no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Hated  Enemy:  At 1st level,  the  foe  hunter chooses

one creature type that she has already selected as a fa-

vored enemy to be the target of her hatred. This choice

determines what kind of foe hunter she becomesorc

hunter, giant  hunter,  or  the like. The  choice  of  hated

enemy is irreversible.

Rancor (Su): The foe hunter can deliver a powerful

blow to her hated enemy. Once per round, on her action,

she  can  designate  one  of  her  attacks  against  a  hated

enemy as a rancor attack before the attack roll is made. A

successful rancor attack by a 1st-level foe hunter deals

+1d6 points of extra damage. This amount increases by

+1d6 points for every two additional foe hunter levels the

attacker acquires. Should the foe hunter score a critical

hit with a rancor attack, this extra damage is not multi-

plied. The extra damage from a rancor attack applies even

if that hated enemy is immune to critical hits.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, the foe hunter can

deal subdual damage instead of normal damage with a

rancor attack. She cannot, however, do subdual damage

with a weapon that deals normal damage in a rancor at-

tack, even when taking the usual 4 penalty.

Hated  Enemy  Damage  Reduction  (Ex):  At  2nd

level, the foe hunter can shrug off 3 points of damage

from  each  successful  attack  by  her  hated  enemy. This

damage reduction  increases  by  2  points  for  every  two

additional foe hunter levels she has. Damage reduction

can  reduce  damage  to  0,  but  not  below  that.  Hated

enemy damage reduction does not stack with any other

damage reduction the character has.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

itive, focused mind could ever manage to forsake magic

for good.

Hit Die: d12.

Ability Bonus (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, the char

acter  gains  a  +1  inherent  bonus  to  any  desired  ability

score for each forsaker level.

Requirements

To qualify as a forsaker, a character

must fulfill the following

criteria.

Feats:  Great  Forti-

tude, Iron Will, Light-

ning Reflexes.

Special: The charac-

ter  must  once  have

been  the  victim  of  a

magical attack that seri-

ously wounded him or

threatened  his  life.  He

must  also  sell  or  give

away all his magic items

(including magic weap-

ons, armor, and potions)

and renounce  the  use  of

any spellcasting and spell-

like abilities he previously

used.

Class Skills

The forsakers class skills (and

the key ability for each skill) are

Climb  (Str),  Craft  (any)  (Int),

Handle Animal (Wis), Heal (Wis),

Intimidate (Cha), Intuit Direction

(Wis),  Jump  (Str),  Listen  (Wis),

Ride  (Dex),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),

Swim  (Str),  Tumble  (Dex),  and

Wilderness  Lore  (Wis).  See  Chapter  4  of  the  Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the forsaker prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Forsakers gain no

weapon or armor proficiencies.

Fast  Healing  (Ex):  Forsakers  regain  hit  points  at

an exceptionally fast rate. At 1st level, the charac-

ter  regains  1  hit  point  per  round,  to  a  maxi-

mum of 10 hit points per day. The number

of hit points regained per round increas-

es by +1 for every four forsaker levels,

and  the  maximum  restorable  per

day  increases  by  10  for  every

two  forsaker  levels.  Except  as

noted  above,  this  ability

works  like  the  fast  healing

ability  described  in  the  in-

troduction  of  the  Monster

Manual.

Thus,  he  must  at-

against  any  spell  that

allows  one.  For  most

beneficial  spells,  such

displacement  or  neutralize

poison, a  successful  save

negates  the  spells  effects;

for  a  cure  spell,  it  halves  the

benefit.  Any  forsaker  who  unwittingly  uses  a  magic

item  or  casts  a  spell  (while  under  the  influence  of  a

charm person or dominate person spell, for example) loses

all  the  special  abilities  of  the  prestige  class  for  one

week.

Spell Resistance (Ex): At 1st level, the forsaker gains

spell resistance 11. This value increases by +1 with each

forsaker level gained and stacks with any other applica-

ble spell resistance he has.

gains  damage  reduction  3/+1. This  damage  resistance

rises by 2/+1 for every two forsaker levels he gains there-

after. This ability remains in effect only as long as the

forsaker  destroys  the  required  value  of  magic  items

every  24  hours  (see  Magic  Destruction,  below). This

does  not  stack  with  any  other  damage  reduction  he

already has.

Magic Destruction: The forsaker gains access to his

damage  reduction  ability  (see  above)  through  the  de-

struction of magic items, if he goes more than 24 hours

without  destroying  magic  items  whose  market  prices

total at least 100 gp per point of damage reduction, he

loses that ability until he does so.

Tough Defense (Ex): At 3rd level, a forsaker gains a

natural armor bonus equal to his Constitution bonus (if

any).

Natural Weapons (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd  level,  the

forsaker can fight as though he and his weapon were one.

Any  weapon  he  uses  functions  as  if  it  were  a  natural

weapon for overcoming damage reduction (see Damage

Reduction in the introduction of the Monster Manual).

That is, if the forsaker has damage reduction 3/+1, any

weapon he uses functions as if it were a +1 weapon for

overcoming a foes damage reduction.

Slippery  Mind  (Ex):  At  6th  level,  the  forsaker  can

wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise

control  or  compel  him.  if  he  fails  his  saving  throw

against an enchantment effect, he can attempt his saving

throw again 1 round later. He gets only one extra chance

to succeed at his saving throw.

Ex-Forsakers

Forsakers can multiclass normally, as long as they con-

tinue to abide by the strictures of the prestige class. Any

forsaker who willingly violates those strictures by using

magic items or casting spells loses all special abilities of

the prestige class and can progress no further as a for-

saker. If he thereafter remains pure (uses no magic) for a

period of a year and a day, his abilities are reinstated at

their previous levels and he may once again progress in

the prestige class.

FRENZIED BERSERKER

The random madness of the thunderstorm and the un-

predictability of the slaadi come together in the soul of

the frenzied berserker. Unlike most other characters, she

does  not  fight  to  achieve  some  heroic  goal  or  defeat  a

loathsome  villain. Those  are  mere  excusesit  is  the

thrill of combat that draws her. For the frenzied barbar-

ian,  the  insanity  of  battle  is  much  like  an  addictive

drugshe  must  constantly  seek  out  more  conflict  to

feed her craving for battle.

Along the wild borderlands and in the evil kingdoms

of  the  world,  frenzied  berserkers  often  lead  warbands

that include a variety of character typesand even other

frenzied berserkers. Some such groups turn to banditry

and brigandage; others serve as specialized mercenaries.

Whatever their origin, such warbands naturally gravitate

toward situations of instability and conflict, because wars

and  civil  strife  are  their  bread  and  butter.  Indeed,  the

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

coming  of  a  frenzied  berserker  is  the  most  obvious

herald of troubled times.

The frenzied berserkers path is unsuited for most ad-

venturersa  fact  for  which  the  peace-lovers  of  the

world can be thankful. Because of their traditional love

for battle, orc and half-orc barbarians are the ones who

most frequently adopt this prestige class, though human

and dwarven barbarians also find it appealing. It might

seem  that  elves  would  be  good  candidates  because  of

their chaotic nature, but the elven aesthetic and love of

grace are at odds with the frenzied berserkers devalua-

tion  of  the  self.  Spellcasting  characters  and  monks

almost never become frenzied berserkers.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To become a frenzied berserker, a character must fulfill

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Feats: Cleave,  Destructive Rage, Intimidating  Rage,

Power Attack.

Class Skills

The frenzied berserkers class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are  Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump

(Str), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str). See Chapter 4 of the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the frenzied berserker

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Frenzied berserk-

ers gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Frenzy  (Ex):  Beginning  at  1st  level,  the  frenzied

berserker can enter a frenzy during combat. While fren-

zied, she gains a +6 bonus to Strength and a single extra

attack each round at her highest bonus. (This latter effect

is not cumulative with haste.) However, she also suffers a

4 penalty to AC and takes 2 points of subdual damage

per round. A frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to

3 + the frenzied berserkers Constitution modifier. To end

the frenzy before its duration expires, the character may

attempt  a  Will  save  (DC  20)  once  per  round  as  a  free

action.  Success  ends  the  frenzy  immediately;  failure

means it continues. The effects of frenzy stack with those

from rage.

At 1st level, the character can enter a frenzy once per

day. Thereafter, she gains one additional use per day of

this ability for every two frenzied berserker levels she ac-

quires. The character can enter a frenzy as a free action.

Even though this takes no time, she can do it only during

her action, not in response to anothers action. In addi-

tion, if she suffers damage from an attack, spell, trap, or

any other source, she automatically enters a frenzy at the

start of her next action, as long as she still has at least one

daily usage of the ability left. To avoid entering a frenzy

in response to damage, the character must make a suc-

cessful Will  save  (DC  10  +  points  of  damage  suffered

since her last action) at the start of her next action.

While frenzied, the character cannot use skills or abil-

ities that  require  patience  or  concentration  (such  as

Move Silently), nor can she cast spells, drink potions, ac-

tivate magic items, or read scrolls. She can use any feat

she has except Expertise, item creation feats, metamagic

feats, and Skill Focus in a skill that requires patience or

concentration. She can, however, use her special ability

to inspire frenzy (see below) normally.

During  a  frenzy,  the  frenzied  berserker  must  attack

those  she  perceives  as  foes  to  the  best  of  her  ability.

Should she run out of enemies before her frenzy expires,

her rampage continues. She must then attack the near-

est  creature (determine  randomly  if  several  potential

toes  are equidistant)  and  fight  that  opponent  without

regard to friendship, innocence, or health (the targets or

her own).

When a frenzy ends, the frenzied berserker is fatigued

(2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity, unable to charge

or run) for the duration ot the encounter, or until she

enters  another  frenzy,  whichever  comes  first.  At  10th

level, she is no longer fatigued alter a frenzy, though she

still suffers the subdual damage tor each round it lasts.

Starting  at 8th level, the characters  frenzy bonus to

Strength becomes  +10 instead ot +6.

Remain  Conscious:  The  frenzied  berserker  gains

Remain Conscious as a bonus feat.

Supreme Cleave: At 2nd level, the frenzied berserker

can take a 5-toot step between attacks when using the

Cleave or Great Cleave  feat.  She is still limited to  one

such adjustment per round, so she cannot use this abil-

ity during a round in which she has already taken a 5-

foot step.

Deathless  Frenzy  (Ex):  At  4th  level,  the  frenzied

berserker can scorn death and unconsciousness while in

a frenzy. Should her hit points to fall to 0 or below be-

cause of hit point loss, she continues to fight normally

until her  frenzy  ends. At  that point, the  effects  of  her

wounds  apply  normally. This  ability  does  not  prevent

death from spell effects such as slay living or disintegrate.

Improved Power Attack: Beginning at 5th level, the

frenzied berserker gains a +3 bonus on her melee damage

rolls for every 2 penalty she takes on her melee attack

rolls when using the Power Attack feat.

Inspire Frenzy (Su): Beginning at 6th level, the fren-

zied berserker can inspire frenzy in her allies while she

herself is frenzied. When she uses this ability, all allies

within 10 feet of her gain the benefits and the disadvan-

tages  of  frenzy  as  it  they  had  that  ability  themselves.

Those who do not wish to be affected can make a Will

save  (DC  10  +  frenzied  berserker  level  +  frenzied

berserkers Charisma modifier) to resist the effect. The

frenzy  of  affected allies  lasts  for  a  number  of  rounds

equal to 3 + the frenzied berserkers Constitution modi-

fier, regardless of whether they remain within 10 feet of

her.

The frenzied berserker gains one additional use of this

ability  per  day  for  every  two  additional  frenzied

berserker levels she acquires, though the ability is still

usable only once per encounter.

Supreme Power Attack: At 10th level, the frenzied

berserker gains a +2 bonus on her melee damage rolls for

every  1  penalty  she  takes  on  her  melee  attack  rolls

when using the Power Attack feat. This effect does not

Stack with that of Improved Power Attack.

GEOMANCER

The cleric reaches  out  to  a  higher  power. The  wizard

trusts only in eldritch tomes. The druid looks to nature

for her spells. To the geomancer. however, all magic is the

same.

Geomancy  is  the  art  of channeling  magical  energy

from many sources through the land itself A geomancer

may research like a wizard, pray like a cleric, or sing like

a bard, but he casts spells as only a geomancer can. In the

area he calls home (be it high on a mountain, deep in 3

Forest, or even beneath an ocean) he weaves ley lines

powerful  connections  to  the  land  itself. The  spells  he

casts through these connections with the earth are re-

flections of his own strength ot will. As the geomancer

progresses,  however,  the  effort  of  gathering  mag:c

through the earth takes a physical toll on him. making

him more and more like the land and its creatures.

Only characters with more than one spellcasting class

can  become  geomancers. The  most  popular  combina-

tions are druid sorcerer and druid wizard. Clerics with

arcane spellcasting ability  can  also qualify,  those  with

access to the Plant or Animal domain are the most likely

to consider this path. A bard or a ranger who picks up a

second, more focused spellcasting class can also adopt

this lifestyle.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To quality as a geomancer, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria.

60

Skills:  Knowledge  (arcana)  6  ranks,  Knowledge

(nature) 6 ranks.

Spells: Ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells and 2nd-

level divine spells.

Class Skills

The geomancers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Alchemy (Int), Animal Empathy (Cha), Con-

centration  (Con),  Craft  (any)  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),

Handle Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Intuit  Direction

(Wis),  Knowledge  (arcana),  Knowledge  (nature),  Scry

(Int), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Wilderness Lore

(Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill de-

scriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the geomancer pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Geomancers gain

no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each geomancer

level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a

spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding

the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other

benefit a character of thai class would have gained (addi-

tional wild  shape options,  metamagic  or  item creation

feats, or the like). Since the character had more than one

spellcasting  class  before  becoming  a  geomancer,  the

player must decide to which class to add each geomancer

level for determining spells per day and spells known.

Spell Versatility: At 1st level, the geomancer learns to

blend divine and arcane magic. He still acquires and pre-

pares his spells in the normal manner tor his individual

spellcasting classes. When he casts  them,  however,  he

can mix or match spellcasting parameters from any of his

classes to gain the maximum possible advantage for any

spell with a spell level equal to or less than his spell ver-

satility score. Thus, as a 4th-level geomancer, he can cast

any of his 3rd-level or lower sorcerer/wizard spells with

no  chance  of  arcane  spell  failure  from  armor.  (The

druidic prohibition against metal armor still applies to

druid/geomancers, however, since  this  stricture stems

from a spiritual oath rather than a practical limitation.)

The geomancer may use his Wisdom bonus to set the

save DC tor arcane spells, or his Charisma or Intelligence

bonus  (whichever  he  would  normally  use  tor  arcane

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

spells; to set the save DC tor divine spells. If a spell re-

quires either an arcane material component or a divine

focus, he may use either. A cleric/geomancer who also

has levels of wizard, sorcerer, or bard can spontaneously

convert  any  prepared  arcane  or divine  spell  (except  a

domain spell) of an appropriate level into a cure or inflict

spell of equal or lower level, though he must be capable

of casting the latter as a cleric.

Drift: The character slowly becomes closer to nature.

At each geomancer level, choose a drift from the appro-

priate stage (see Drift, below).

Ley  Lines:  At  2nd  level,  the  geomancer  learns  to

create magical connections with a specific type of ter-

rain. Choose one of the following terrain types: aquatic,

desert, Forest, hills, marsh, mountains, or plains. In that

terrain,  the  geomancers  effective  caster  level  for all

spells increases by +1. At 6th level and again at 10th level,

the character may either choose a new terrain in which

to  receive  the  benefit (at  +1),  or  increase  his  effective

caster  level  in  a  previously  chosen  terrain  by  an  addi-

tional +1.

Drift

Drift  is  a  gradual  devolution  into  some  other  natural

form. Those who experience this phenomenon gain at-

tributes  of  animals  and  plants  as  time  goes  by.  Geo-

mancers experience drift at every level. As a variant rule,

high-level druids who spend all their lives away from civ-

ilization  may  also  experience  drift  at  the  Dungeon

Masters discretionperhaps once every ten years.

Drift is divided into stages. You must choose one drift

from stage 1 the first time you experience the phenome-

non. Your second drift must also be from stage 1. There-

after, you may choose from a higher stage only after you

have acquired at least two drifts from the previous stage.

For example, a stage 4 drift may be chosen only after you

have at least two stage 1 drifts, two stage 2 drifts, and two

stage  3  drifts. You  may,  however,  choose  drifts  from

stages below your maximum whenever you wish. For ex-

ample, you if you have two stage 1 drifts, you may choose

a third stage 1 rather than a stage 2, if desired.

Stage 1 drifts have no game effect. Each drift of stage 2

and  beyond  grants  a  permanent  extraordinary  ability.

rolls, except in the case of poison and acid.

HEXER

Do not meet the gaze of the shaman with the evil eye,

warn  townsfolk  who  have  crossed  paths  with  a  hexer.

Unfortunately,  the  typical  intrepid  adventurer  rarely

hears such advice in time. The hexer profits by this igno-

rance, surprising his victims with the power of his gaze.

Many hexers inflict curses that follow their victims like

a plague. The more powerful practitioners can engender

fear, cause magical slumber, or enthrall their victims as

slaves with a mere glance.

Hexers are unknown among civilized peoples; they are

found only among tribes of goblins, ogres, and orcs. Prior

to  pursuing  the  path  of  the hexer,  most  of  them were

adepts  who  served  as  witch  doctors  for  their  tribes.

Hexers often assume leadership of their tribes as well

who would dare to gainsay them, after all?

Most  hexers  are  villainous,  evil  cretins  lacking  any

code  of  morality,  and  the  vast  majority  of  them  hate

humans, elves, dwarves, and other civilized races. Neu-

tral hexers are no less dangerous, especially when some-

thing threatens the welfare of their tribes.

Requirements

To become a hexer, a character must fulfill the following

criteria.

Race/Type: Monstrous humanoid, giant, goblinoid, or

other primitive humanoid, such as orc or gnoll.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills:  Knowledge  (arcana)  10  ranks,  Spellcraft  8

ranks, Wilderness Lore 10 ranks.

Spellcasting: Able to cast lightning bolt as a divine

spell.

Class Skills

The hexers class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Alchemy  (Int),  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (any)

(Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Knowledge

(any) (Int), Profession (any) (Wis), Scry (Int, exclusive

skill)  Spellcraft  (Int),  and  Wilderness  Lore  (Wis).  See

Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The  following  are  class  features  of  the  hexer  prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:  Hexers  gain  no

weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each hexer level,

the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spell-

casting  class  to  which  he  belonged  before  adding  the

prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other ben-

efit  a  character  of  that  class  would  have  gained  (addi-

tional  wild  shape options,  metamagic  or  item  creation

feats,  or  the  like),  if  the  character  had  more  than  one

spellcasting  class  before  becoming  a  hexer,  the  player

must decide to which class to add each hexer level for de-

termining spells per day and spells known.

HHHHHex ex ex ex ex (Sp): At 1st level, the hexer gains a gaze attack. He

can use this ability once per day at 1st level and twice

per day at 2nd level. Thereafter, he gains one additional

use per day of this ability for every two hexer levels he

acquires.

Activating this power is a standard action, and it lasts

for  a  number  of  rounds  equal  to  the  characters hexer

level. Each round, the hexers gaze attack automatically

works against one creature within 30 feet that is look-

ing at (attacking or interacting with) him. Targets who

avert their eyes have a 50% chance of avoiding the gaze,

but  the  hexer  gains  one-half  concealment  (20%  miss

chance)  relative  to  those  who  successfully  avoid  tine

gaze. Targets can also close their eyes or turn away en-

tirely;  doing  so  prevents  the  hex from  affecting  them

but  grants  the  gazer  total  concealment  (50%  miss

chance) relative to them.

An  affected  target  must  make  a Will  save  (DC  10  +

hexer level + hexers Wisdom modifier) or suffer a 4 en-

hancement penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability

checks,  and  skill  checks. These  effects  are  permanent

until removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, mir-

acle, remove curse, or wish spell. This is an enchantment

effect and cannot be dispelled.

A  hex  does  not  affect  undead  creatures  or  extend

beyond the plane that the hexer occupies. The hexer is

subject to the effects of his own reflected gaze and is al-

lowed a saving throw against them.

Bonus Spell: At 2nd level, the hexer adds a new spell

of his choice to his spell list. This spell must come from

the wizard/sorcerer spell list and must be of a spell level

that the hexer can cast. He can prepare this new spell at

the same spell level as it appeared on the wizard/sorcerer

list. He gains one additional bonus spell for every two

hexer levels he has.

icken Hex ex ex ex ex (Sp): At 3rd level, the hexer can use his gaze

icken H

icken H

SSSSSicken H

icken H

attack to inflict a debilitating illness. This ability func-

tions like the hex ability (above), except that the target

must  make  a  Fortitude  save  instead  of  a Will  save  to

resist, and the effect is as described below. A sicken hex re-

quires one daily use of the characters hex ability.

A target who fails the save is overcome with pain and

fever,  which  causes  him  or  her  to  move  at  one-half

normal speed, lose any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class,

and  suffer  a  2  circumstance  penalty  on  attack rolls.

These effects are permanent until removed with a break

enchantment,  limited wish,  miracle,  remove  curse,  or  wish

spell. A sicken hex is a necromancy effect that cannot be

dispelled.

FFFFFear Hear Hear Hear Hear Hex ex ex ex ex (Sp): At 5th level, the hexer can use his gaze

attack to engender fear. This ability functions like the hex

ability (above), except that target is affected as if by a fear

spell. A fear hex is a mind-influencing, compulsion, en-

chantment  effect,  and  it  requires  one daily  use  of  the

characters hex ability.

SSSSSleep H

leep Hleep Hex ex ex ex ex (Sp): At 7th level, the hexer can use his gaze

leep Hleep H

to generate a sleep effect. This ability functions like the

hex ability (above), except that duration is 10 minutes  

the characters hexer level and the target is affected as if

64

by a sleep spell. A sleep hex is a mind-influencing, compul-

sion, enchantment effect, and it requires one daily use of

the characters hex ability.

CharCharCharCharCharm  Hm  Hm  Hm  Hm  Hexexexexex (Sp): At 9th level, the hexer can use his

gaze attack to generate a charm monster effect. This ability

functions like the hex ability (above), except that dura-

tion is 1 day per hexer level and the target is affected as if

by a charm monster spell. (Should the hexer fall victim to

his own reflected gaze attack, he is affected as if by a hold

monster spell.) A charm hex is a mind-influencing, charm,

enchantment effect, and it requires one daily use of the

characters hex ability.

KING/QUEEN OF THE WILD

Few are brave enough to climb the highest mountains

and tread the deepest deserts. But where natures fury is

at its height, there youll find the kings and queens of the

wild, undaunted by the challenges before themthat is,

if youre strong enough to look for them there.

When choosing this prestige class, you must specify

one of the following eight terrain types: desert, Forest,

hills,  marsh,  mountain,  plains,  sea,  skies,  or  under-

ground. Other terrain types are not harsh enough to en-

gender this kind of survivalism.

Anyone with a tie to nature and sufficient hardiness

can become a king or queen of the wild. Rangers, bar-

barians,  and  druids  tend  to  be  the  most  comfortable

with  this  lifestyle.  However,  many  adventurers  have

clashed  with  snow  wizards  and  desert  sorcerers  who

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

have  augmented  their  powers  by  adopting  this  pres-

tige class.

A character can choose this prestige class more than

once  but  must  select  a  different  terrain  type  and  start

again  at  1st  level  each  time.  Levels  of  different  king/

queen of the wild classes do not stack for determining

level-based class features.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To become a king or queen of the wild, a character must

fulfill the following criteria.

Base Fortitude Save Bonus: +4.

Skills: Hide 4 ranks, Intuit Direction 4 ranks, Wilder-

ness Lore 8 ranks, terrain-dependent prerequisite skill

(see below) 4 ranks.

Feats: Endurance, Track.

Special: The character must choose a terrain type (see

below) and live in or near such an area.

Class Skills

The  king/queen  of  the  wilds  class  skills  (and  the  key

ability  for  each  skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Climb  (Str),

Craft  (any)  (Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Hide  (Dex),

Intuit Direction (Wis), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Ride (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Use

Rope (Dex), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4

of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the king/queen of the

wild prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Kings and queens

of the wild gain proficiency with simple weapons and

light armor.

Terrain Skill Bonuses: At 1st level, a king or queen

of  the  wild  gains  a  +2  insight  bonus  on  both Wilder-

ness Lore checks and checks made with his or her ter-

rain-dependent  prerequisite  skill  while  in  the  chosen

terrain.

Endure  Elements  (Ex): The  king  or  queen  of  the

wild can ignore some damage from the element associ-

ated  with  the  chosen  terrain  type  (see Terrain-Depen-

dent  Features,  below)  as  though  under  a  permanent

endure elements effect. At 2nd level, the character ignores

the first 5 points of damage from that element. (The ter-

rain elements correspond to the five energy types: acid,

cold, electricity, fire, and sonic.) This amount increases

by an additional +5 at 5th, 8th, and 10th level.

Terrain Movement (Ex): At 2nd level, if the

chosen terrain is land-based, the king or queen

of the wild can move overland through it as if it were

plains. A king of the sea or a queen of the marsh

swims along the surface of water at one-half his or

her land speed.

Attack  Native  Creatures  (Ex): The  king  or

queen  of  the  wild  gains  a  competence  bonus

on attack rolls against any creature that has the

characters  chosen  terrain  listed  in  the  Cli-

mate/Terrain  section  of  its  statistics.  (In  the

OOZEMASTER

Seeping out of every crack and crevice in the dungeon is

some foul, monochromatic substance that adventurers

wish wasnt there. Just when they get around the yellow

mold, green slime drips from the ceiling. Quite often,

such  abominations  well  up  naturally,  but

occasionally  they  are  placed  by  a

more  deliberate  handthat  of

the oozemaster.

The  oozemaster  is  not  a

class  for  stable  individu-

als.  It  involves  relating

one-on-one

with

things  that  relate  to

nothing  at  all.  Un-

like

animal

the

lords  kindred  crea-

tures,  the  oozemas-

ters  charges  have

nothing  to  say.  No

one  has  yet  devel-

oped  a  speak  with

ooze  spellor  if  .,

someone  has,  the

oozes  havent  re-

sponded.  Given  that

oozemasters  exude

everything  but  confi-

dence,  most  of  them

have

few  sentient

friends and even few-

er guests. Thus, they

tend  to  gibber  and

talk

them-

to

selves a lot.

Characters  of  any

class

spellcasting

can  become  oozemasters,

though  the  class  tends  to  be

most  appealing  to  druids,  wiz-

ards, andoddlybards (who usually end up taking an-

other direction before this one gets too creepy). Assassins,

already masters of poison, find the benefits of this pres-

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

tige class highly compatible with their line of work. Cler-

ics, however, had better think about what their followers

might say before taking this path. A cleric of Vecnas fol-

lowers might think him clever for becoming an oozemas-

ter, while followers of a cleric of Pelor might seek a new

spiritual leader. Racially, half-orcs and gnomes are more

suited  to  this  class  than  elves  and  half-elves,  most  of

whom  consider  themselves  too  refined  for  this

basest of prestige classes. The drow, of course,

are exceptions, since it was they

who created this class in the first

place.  Certainly,  the  first  ooze-

master was a dark elf, though how

this magic got out of the subter-

ranean  depths  is  a  mystery  best

left unprobed.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify as an oozemas-

ter,  a  character  must  ful-

fill the following criteria.

Skills: Alchemy 4 ranks,

Swim 4 ranks.

Feats: Great Fortitude.

Spellcasting: Able  to  cast

3rd-level  arcane  or  divine

spells.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Class Features

The following are class features of the oozemaster pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Oozemasters gain

no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  At  2nd  level  and

every  other  oozemaster  level  thereafter,  the  character

gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable)

as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to

which he belonged before adding the prestige class. He

does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of

that class would have gained (additional wild shape op-

tions, metamagic or item creation feats, or the like). If the

character had more than one spellcasting class before be-

coming an oozemaster, the player must decide to which

class to add each oozemaster level for determining spells

per day and spells known.

Minor Oozy Touch (Su): At 1st level, the oozemasters

hands can secrete a specific kind of ooze. Choose one

kind of oozy touch from the table below. The character

may, as a full attack action, make a melee touch attack

that has the effect listed for that kind of ooze on the table

below. The oozemaster can use this ability as often as de-

sired. At 3rd level, he may choose one additional oozy

minor oozy touch.

In addition, the oozemaster is immune to the effects of

that  particular  kind  of  ooze, even  in  the  form  of  oozy

touch attacks from another oozemaster. Thus, an ooze-

master with brown mold oozy touch is immune to the

effects of all brown mold. This ability confers no special

resistance to similar effects that do not stem from the

characters selected kind of ooze, so the aforementioned

oozemaster is still subject to cold subdual damage from

other sourcessuch as cold weather.

age to flesh only

Phosphorescent fungus Touched area emits a soft violet glow as

a light spell until the fungus is wiped

off

OOOOOozy Gozy Gozy Gozy Gozy Globloblobloblob (Sp): The oozemaster can throw a glob ot the

same  material  as  any  oozy  touch  gained  at  a  previous

level, with a range increment of 10 feet. This is treated as

a grenadelike weapon. He can throw one oozy glob per

round. (A character attacks with a grenadelike weapon as

a ranged touch attack. Direct hits deal direct hit damage

as noted on the table above. All creatures within 5 feet

suffer  1  point  of  the  appropriate splash  damage.  See

Grenadelike Weapon Attacks in Chapter 8 of the Players

Handbook for more details.) This ability is usable once per

day at 2nd level. Thereafter, the oozemaster gains one ad-

ditional use per day of this ability for every two ooze-

master levels he acquires.

Slithery  Face  (Su):  At  2nd  level,  the  oozemaster

learns to manipulate his facial features, gaining a compe-

68

tence bonus equal to his oozemaster level on Disguise

checks.

Malleability  (Su):  At  4th  level,  the oozemaster  can

compress his body enough to squeeze through an inch-

wide crack. He cannot expand inside a space that offers

any resistance, such as an occupied suit of armor.

Major Oozy Touch (Su): At 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the

oozemaster chooses a kind of major oozy touch from the

table  below,  or  from  the  choices  in  the  Minor  Oozy

Touch Options table above. This ability is otherwise iden-

tical to minor oozy touch (above).

Indiscernible Anatomy (Su): At 6th level, the ooze-

masters anatomy becomes difficult to discern. Treat all

critical hits and sneak attacks against him as though he

were wearing armor with the light fortification power.

lime

lime

SSSSSlime

lime

slime wave (see Chapter 6) once per day as the spell cast

by a 13th-level druid.

One with the Ooze: At 10th level, the oozemaster is

as slimy as the creatures he favors. His type changes to

ooze tor determining what effects and items can affect

him. He gains the Blindsight feat (hearing-based version,

see Chapter 2) and becomes immune to flanking, poison,

sleep,  paralysis,  stunning,  and  all  mind-influencing

effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and

morale effects). In addition, he is immune to polymorph

other, but he retains any shapechanging ability he previ-

ously possessed.

See Complete Adventurer

SHIFTER

The shifter has no form that she calls her own. Instead,

she clothes herself in whatever shape is most expedient

at the time. While others base their identities largely on

their external forms, the shifter actually comes closer to

her true self through all her transformations. Of neces-

sity, her sense ot self is based not on her outward form,

but on her soul, which is truly the only constant about

her. It is the inner strength of that soul that enables her

to take on any shape and remain herself within.

At first, the shifter can risk only humanoid forms and

familiar animal shapes. As she grows more comfortable

with her  own  true  shapelessness,  however,  she  can

assume more  outlandish forms. Eventually, she knows

herself so well that she feels just as comfortable in the

shape ot a completely different creature type as she does

in  her  own.  At  that  point,  her  pasteven  her  race

becomes irrelevant, since external form no longer mat-

ters to her.

The  shifters  path  is  ideal  for  a  spellcaster  of  any  race

who has experienced shapeshifting and yearns for more

of it. Such a character can be a great force for either good

or ill in the world; an evil shifter in particular poses a ter-

rible threat, for she can appear anywhere, in any form.

The same opponents may face her again and again, in one

shape  after  another,  never  realizing  that  they  actually

face a single, formless enemy.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To become a shifter, a character must fulfill the following

criteria.

Feats: Alertness, Endurance.

Spells: Able to cast 3rd-level spells.

Special: Alternate Formmust either know polymorph

self or have a natural alternate form, alter self, polymorph

self, shapechange, or wild shape ability.

Class Skills

The shifters class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Animal Empathy (Cha, exclusive skill), Climb (Str),

Concentration (Con), Craft (any) (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),

Disguise (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowl-

edge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str),

and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The  following are  class  features  of the  shifter  prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:  Shifters  gain  no

weapon or armor proficiencies.

hape (Sp): Beginning at 1st level, the

hape

shifter can take the form of another creature. Greater wild

shape works  like wild  shape,  with  the  following  excep-

tions. As she rises in level, the shifter gains the ability to

assume  the  forms  of  creatures  with  types  other  than

animal (see Table 515 for details), though she cannot

choose a form that normally has more Hit Dice than she

herself does. She can designate at the time of the change

which pieces of her equipment meld into her new form

and which do not. Nonmelded equipment alters its size

to match that of her new form, but retains its functional-

ity. The  shifter  cannot,  however,  use  any  equipment

unless she has either an appropriate appendage or a mag-

ical  means  of  compensating  for  the  lack  of  one.  Any

piece of equipment that is separated from her reverts to

its original form.

At 1st level, the shifter is limited to humanoid forms of

Small and Medium-size. Thereafter, she can use greater

wild shape two more times per day for every two shifter

levels she gains, and her range of available creature sizes

and types increases as shown on Table 515. When she

gains the ability to adopt an undead shape at 5th level,

she may become incorporeal if she chooses the form

of a creature with that subtype.

If  the  shifter  already  has  the  wild  shape ability

from another class, she may convert her uses per

day of wild shape to uses per day of greater wild shape

on a one-for-one basis. She may also mix and match

the benefits of the two abilities as desired to gain the

maximum advantage for any daily use. Thus, a Drd8/

shifter1 has up to four uses per day of greater wild shape,

and  she  could  use  the  ability  to  become  a  Large  hu-

manoid (because an 8th-level druid can become a Large

69

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

creature and a 1st-level shifter can adopt the form of a hu-

manoid). In the same manner, a Drd8/Shifter2 could be-

come a Large monstrous humanoid if she wished.

Supernatural  Ease:  At  6th  level,  the  characters

greater  wild  shape ability  becomes  supernatural  rather

than spell-like. It still requires a standard action and can

be suppressed in an antimagic field, but its use no longer

provokes  attacks  of  opportunity  and  never  requires  a

Concentration check.

Evershifting  Form:  At  10th  level,  the  shifter  has

reached  the  pinnacle  of  her  shapechanging  abilities.

From this point on, she can use greater wild shape once per

round, as a move-equivalent action, as many times per

day as she wishes. Her type changes to shapechanger for

determining what effects and items can affect her, and

she gains darkvision (60 feet), which remains in effect re-

gardless of her form.

In addition, the shifter no longer suffers ability penal-

ties for aging and is not subject to magical aging, though

any  aging  penalties  she  may  already  have  suffered

remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still

dies of old age when her time is up.

See Complete Adventurer

TAMER OF BEASTS

The ability to bond with animals opens up a new way of

life  for  some  druids  and  rangers.  By  exploring  and

strengthening  their  bonds  with  their  animal  compan-

ions, they can improve not only the creatures lives, but

their own as well.

Though a character who follows this path is called a

tamer of beasts, this is perhaps a misnomer, since he does

not truly master, tame, or domesticate his companions.

Rather, through his magic and his overwhelming con-

cern  for  his  charges,  he  can  make  them  tougher  and

more intelligent. Ultimately, he can even converse with

them as equals.

This class appeals primarily to rangers and druids. A

member of another class may feel some longing for the

path of the tamer, but without first developing a deep re-

lationship with an animal, it is impossible to embrace this

prestige class. Tamers of beasts have been known among

all races. Elves, half-elves, and gnomes are the most likely

to take up this path because of their affinity for nature,

and dwarves are the least likely. The philosophy of a tamer

of beasts is compatible with any alignment.

Unlike  most  druids,  tamers  of  beasts  usually  reside

close to civilization. Some NPC tamers of beasts conceal

their  special  relationships  with  animals  and  beasts  by

finding employment in a common circus or zoo. More

typically, however, tamers of beasts adopt creatures that

are  threatened  by growing  populations  of  humanoids,

protecting and shielding them from harm. If these crea-

tures have suffered greatly at the hands of humanoids,

tamers of beasts may also try to exact retribution.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To become a tamer of beasts, a character must fulfill the

following criteria.

Skills: Animal Empathy 10 ranks.

Feats: Skill Focus (Animal Empathy).

Spells: Able to cast animal friendship.

Class Skills

The tamer of beastss class skills (and the key ability for

each  skill)  are  Animal  Empathy  (Cha,  exclusive  skill),

Class Features

The  following are  class  features of the  tamer  of  beasts

prestige class. All modifications and bonuses granted to

the tamers animal companions are immediately negated

upon their release or the death of the tamer.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Tamers of beasts

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 3rd, 6th, and 9th

level, the tamer of beasts gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level

in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding

the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other

benefit a character of that class would have gained (addi-

tional wild shape options, metamagic or item creation feats,

or the like). If the character had more than one spellcast-

ing class before becoming a tamer of beasts, the player

must decide to which class to add each tamer of beasts

level for determining spells per day and spells known.

Animal Mastery: Beginning at 1st level, the tamer of

beasts can have animal companions whose Hit Dice total

no more than the sum of twice his tamer of beasts level

plus twice his caster level for animal friendship.  For ex-

ample, a Drd7/tamer of beasts3 can have up to 20 Hit Dice

of animal companions. No individual animal companion

can have more Hit Dice than the tamer of beasts does.

Intelligence: Through constant exposure to the tamer

of beasts, his animal companions become more intelli-

gent than the average for their species. When the tamer

of beasts is 1st level, the Intelligence score of each of his

companions rises to 4, and the creatures type changes to

magical beast. This minimum Intelligence score rises by

2 points for every two lamer of beasts levels the character

gains thereafter. This improved Intelligence may allow

the  companion  to follow  more  complex  instructions

than it could before. Also, the tamer of beasts can teach

each companion three tricks per point of Intelligence it

has (see the Animal Companions sidebar in Chapter 2 of

the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide and Chapter 2 of this book

for more information on training animals).

Empathic Link (Su): At 2nd level, the tamer of beasts

gains an empathic link that allows him to communicate

telepathically with his companions to a maximum dis-

tance of one mile. The tamer of beasts and the compan-

ion can understand one another as if a speak with animals

effect were  in  force.  Of  course, intelligence  is  still  a

factor in the content of such conversations, and misun-

derstandings on that basis are still possible.

Blood Bond: At 3rd level, each of the tamer of beasts

companions gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, checks,

and saves  after witnessing  any  threat  or  harm to  the

tamer. This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate

and apparent.

Natural  Armor:  Also  when  the  tamer  of  beasts

reaches 3rd level, each of his companions gains a +2 en-

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

hancement bonus to its natural armor. This bonus rises

to +4 at 6th level and +6 at 9th level.

Animal Senses (Su): At 4th level, the tamer of beasts

can  hear  through  any  designated  companions  ears  or

smell through its nose. At 7th level, he can see through a

companions  eyes. The  tamer  can  activate  his  animal

senses as a standard action, and he does not lose the abil-

ity to sense events around him by doing so.

Speak with Master (Ex): Also at 4th level, the tamer

of beasts gains the ability to communicate verbally with

his companions in a language of his own. Creatures other

than his companions cannot understand this communi-

cation without magical aid.

astery y y y y (Sp): At 5th level, the tamer of beasts can

use the animal friendship spell to affect beasts in addition

to animals, regardless of the targets Intelligence score.

Beast companions count against the tamers total allowed

Hit Dice of companions just as animals do.

Share  Saving Throws:  When the  tamer  of  beasts

reaches 6th level, his companions can use either his base

saves  or their  own,  mixing  and  matching  to  gain  the

highest value for each.

Share  Spells:  At  7th  level,  the  tamer  of  beasts  may

have any spell he casts on himself also affect one com-

panion of his choice within 5 feet of him. A spell with a

duration  other  than  instantaneous  stops  affecting the

companion if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and the

effect  is  not  reinstated  even  if  that  companion  again

comes within 5 feet of the character before the spells du-

ration expires. Additionally, the tamer may cast a spell

with a target of You on a companion (as if the spell had

a  range  of touch)  instead  of  on  himself. The  tamer  of

beasts and the companion can share even spells that do

not normally affect creatures of the companions type.

fewer Hit Dice than that particular companion has. Each

companion can  use  this  ability  once  per day  per  two

levels of the tamer, and the ability functions just like the

spell ami ma mi (for purposes of this spell, the companion

can make itself understood).

double their own Hit Dice against the tamers total al-

lowed Hit Dice of companions. For example, a cockatrice

with 5 Hit Dice accounts for 10 Hit Dice of companions.

Inspire Greatness (Su): At 10th level, the tamer of

beasts can grant extra lighting ability to all his compan-

ions within 30 feet. An inspired companion gains +2 Hit

Dice (d10s that grant temporary hit points), a +2 compe-

tence bonus on attacks, and a +1 competence bonus on

Fortitude  saves.  Apply  the  companions Constitution

modifier, if any, to each bonus Hit Die. These extra Hit

Dice  count  as regular  Hit  Dice  for  determining  the

effects of spells such as sleep. The tamer of beasts can in-

spire his companions once per day, and the effects last for

5  rounds. This  is  a  supernatural,  mind-affecting,  en-

chantment ability.

See Complete Adventurer

TEMPEST

The tempest is the point of calm within a whirling bar-

rier  of  deadly  blades.  Poets  use  colorful  terms  such  as

dancer to describe the movement of a tempest and her

two blades, but mastery of this fighting style is not about

dancing. Nor is it about impressing anyoneleast of all

poets. The tempest focuses on learning the ultimate se-

crets of two-weapon fighting for a single purposethe

destruction of her enemies.

Typically  hardy  individualists,  tempests  rarely  learn

their skills through any sort of formal training. Instead,

they master their an though constant application of its

disciplines and experimentation on their foes. Similarly,

no  matter  how  famous  tempests  become,  its  rare  for

them to take on students. Their art, they say, is one that

can be learned but never taught.

This  prestige  class  is  open  to  all  classes  and  races.

Though  tempests  are  rare,  every  humanoid  race  has

boasted at least a few. Elves make for nimble, clever tem-

pests whose dexterity works to their advantage. Dwarves,

perhaps because they favor heavy armor and heavy weap-

ons, are the least likely characters to become tempests.

Even members of the smaller races can find the tempests

path appealing.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify as a tempest, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +9.

Feats: Ambidexterity, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack.

Two-Weapon  Fighting,  and  Weapon  Finesse  (any)  or

Weapon Focus (any).

Class Skills

The  tempests  class  skills  (and  the  key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen

(Wis), Ride (Dex), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chap-

ter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the tempest prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Tempests gain no

weapon or armor proficiencies.

Improved Two-Weapon Fighting: Beginning at 1st

level, a tempest can fight with two weapons as if she had

the  Improved Two-Weapon  Fighting  feat  when  she  is

wearing light armor or no armor. She loses this ability

when fighting in medium or heavy armor, or when using

a double weapon (such as a two-bladed sword).

Off-Hand Parry: At 2nd level, the tempest gains Off-

Hand Parry as a bonus feat. As she gains tempest levels,

her AC bonus from this feat increases, rising to +4 at 4th

level and to +6 at 6th level.

Greater Two-Weapon Fighting: At 5th level, a tem-

pest can fight with two weapons as if she had the Greater

Two-Weapon  Fighting  feat  when  she  is  wearing  light

armor or no armor. She loses this ability when fighting in

medium or heavy armor, or when using a double weapon

(such as a two-bladed sword).

Absolute Ambidexterity: Beginning at 8th level, the

tempests attack penalties for fighting with two weapons

lessen  by  2  when  she  is  wearing  light  armor  or  no

armor. Thus, if she tights with a light weapon in her oft

hand,  she  suffers  no  penalties  on  her  attack  rolls  for

fighting with two weapons. (If the off-hand weapon is

not  light,  she  suffers  a  2  penalty  on  attack  rolls  with

both her primary hand and her offhand.)

Supreme Two-Weapon  Fighting:  At  10th  level,  a

tempest  gains  an  additional  attack  with  her  off-hand

weapon when she is wearing light armor or no armor. In

addition to the three attacks she already has each round

with her off-hand weapon (for Improved Two-Weapon

Fighting and Greater Two-Weapon Fighting) at penalties

of 0, 5, and 10, respectively,  she is also entitled to a

fourth attack with her off-hand weapon at a 15 penalty

(see Table  82: Two-Weapon  Fighting  Penalties  in  the

Players  Handbook). She  loses  this  special  ability  when

fighting  in  medium  or  heavy  armor,  or  when  using  a

double weapon (such as a two-bladed sword).

VERDANT LORD

Saying the verdant lord has a green thumb is like calling

a red dragon a creature with a slight affinity for fire. The

verdant lord is the final defender of the Forest. He has left

behind  the  druids  search  for  global  understanding  of

natures secrets to focus all his energies on the worlds

plant life.

Elven and half-elven druids are the most likely charac-

ters to embrace the role of the verdant lord. Druids of

other races, rangers, and the occasional priest of Obad-

Hai or Ehlonna have also been known to adopt this

prestige  class.  Its  almost  impossible  for  characters  

without such ties to become verdant lords because they

have neither the interest in nor the required understand-

ing of seeds, saplings, and trees.

Since most verdant lords have little use for civilization,

they tend to be loners, watching the years pass by from

their  groves.  Adventuring  verdant  lords  are  rare,  but

those who do exist are marvelous to behold. They tend to

take their  gardens  with  them,  often  bringing  several

plant creatures, such as animated trees and treants, along

on  adventures.  Verdant  lords  tend  to  be  sott-spoken,

easygoing individualsright up until someone lights a

torch and threatens living plants.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify as a verdant lord, a character must fulfill the

following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Skills: Profession (herbalist) 8 ranks, Wilderness Lore

8 ranks.

Feats: Plant Control, Plant Defiance.

Spells: Able to cast control plants.

Class Skills

The verdant lords class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Animal Empathy (Cha), Climb (Sir), Concen-

tration  (Con),  Craft (any) (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Dis-

guise  (Cha),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Hide

(Dex), Intuit Direction (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int),

Listen (Wis), Scry (Int), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Sir), and

Wilderness  Lore  (Wis).  See  Chapter  4  of  the  Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Verdant lords gain

no weapon or armor proficiencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each verdant lord

level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a

spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the

prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other ben-

efit a character of that class would have gained (additional

wild shape options, metamagic or item creation feats, or

the like). If the character had more than one spellcasting

class  before  becoming  a  verdant  lord, the  player  must

decide to which class to add each verdant lord level for de-

termining spells per day and spells known.

Create Infusion: At 1st level, the verdant lord gains

Create Infusion as a bonus feat.

Expert Infusion: At 2nd level, the character can au-

tomatically identify the spell contained in an infusion

and the caster level of that spell (see Infusions in Chap-

ter  3).  He  also  gains  a  bonus  equal  to  his  verdant  lord

level on both Profession (herbalist) checks and Wilder-

ness Lore checks related to plants, including the use of

this skill to forage for herbs.

Sun Sustenance (Ex): Also at 2nd level, the verdant

lord gains the ability to draw energy from the sun. As

long as he spends at least 4 hours of the day outdoors, he

can draw sustenance from the sun itself, and thus he re-

quires  no  food  that  day.  He  still  thirsts,  however,  and

needs the standard amount of water to survive.

Spontaneity: Beginning at 3rd level, the verdant lord

can  channel  stored  spell  energy  into  certain  healing

spells that he hasnt prepared ahead of time. This works

like the clerics spontaneous casting ability, with the fol-

lowing exceptions. He can lose a prepared spell to cast

any regenerate spell of the same level or lower (a regenerate

spell is any one with regenerate in its name; these spells

are presented in Chapter 6). For example, a verdant lord

who has  prepared faerie  fire (a 1st-level  spell)  may  lose

that spell to cast regenerate light wounds (also a 1st-level

spell) instead. Domain spells, if the character has access

to them, cannot be converted into regenerate spells.

Plant Facility: At 4th level, the verdant lord can rebuke

or command plants with Plant Control as if he were three

levels higher than the actual caster level he uses to deter-

mine the benefits of that feat. This means that he can also

command 3 additional HD of plant creatures.

Fast Healing: At 5th level, the verdant lord gains Fast

Healing as a bonus feat.

tive  appendages,  the  verdant  lord  can  cast  spells  nor-

mally while in treant wild shape.

nimate TTTTTrrrrree ee ee ee ee (Sp): At 8th level, a verdant lord can ani-

nimate

AAAAAnimate

nimate

nimate

mate a tree within 180 feet of him once per day. It takes a

full round for a tree to uproot itself; thereafter it has a

speed of 30 feet and fights as a treant with respect to at-

tacks and damage. The animated tree gains a number of

bonus  Hit  Dice  equal  to  the  number  of  verdant  lord

levels the  character  possesses. Though  its  Intelligence

score is only 2 while animated, the tree automatically un-

derstands the verdant lords commands. The charactercan

return  the  animated  tree  to  its  normal  state  at  will,

and it automatically returns to its normal state if it dies or

if the verdant lord who animated it is incapacitated or

moves out of range. Once the tree returns to its normal

state by any means, the verdant lord cannot animate an-

other tree for 24 hours.

Gaeas Embrace: At 10th level, the verdant lord per-

manently becomes a plant creature, though all forms of

wild shape that the character could previously use remain

available to him. His type changes to plant, and as a result

he  gains  low-light  vision,  is  immune  to  poison,  sleep,

paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing, and is not sub-

ject to critical hits or mind-influencing effects (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns, or morale effects). He

no longer suffers penalties for aging and cannot be mag-

ically aged. Any aging penalties he may already have suf-

fered, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and

the verdant lord still dies of old age when his time is up.

Organized Druids:

The Order of the Verdant Grove

You cannot decide to be pure, novice.

An elder of the Order, to a young Vadania

The Order of the Verdant Grove is a loose organization of

about one hundred seventy druids and verdant lords who

share certain interests and are committed to gaining and

disseminating information about nature. The organiza-

tion  doesnt  have much of a hierarchy,  and the  typical

member also owes allegiance to some other druid circle

in his or her local area. Many druids have heard of the

Order of the Verdant Grove, but they often assume it is

the name of some regional druid circle.

An  applicant  for  membership  must  be  invited  and

sponsored by a current member, and all available mem-

bers periodically vote on whether to admit the current

applicants. Once accepted, the new member (called an

initiate) undergoes a rite of acceptance during which he

or she receives a hoop earring bearing a green orb. Not

only does this allow members to identify one another,

but it is also a pearl of power (1st-level). The initiate is ex-

pected to make a donation that covers the cost of creat-

ing this talisman.

What makes the order different from other organiza-

tions is that its members intentionally spread themselves

out over the world. A few are just as tied to a single sacred

grove  or  woodland  as  any  other  druid  or  verdant  lord

would be, but most are travelers. They may be active ad-

venturers out to address wrongs in the world or scholars

in search of information that they can share with fellow

members.

In this sense, the Order of the Verdant Grove is the

closest thing druids have to a ring of spies. Of course,

most of the information that its members acquire and

disseminate within the organization would bore a typical

spy to tears. They share information about their explo-

rations of distant lands, discoveries of new creatures (an-

imals and beasts), and of previously unknown wonders

of the natural world. They also share knowledge of new-

spells and magic items that have come into use. Mem-

bers of the Order of the Verdant Grove are encouraged to

share whatever information they discover, but they are

74

required to report on new druid communities, standing

stones, or druid circles that they find. The Order of the

Verdant Grove must occasionally act as a messenger serv-

ice  between  independent  druid  circles  in  times  of  re-

gional or greater crisis, so its important for its members

to know where the druids of the world can be found.

The origins of the order hearken back to a day when a

druid circle broke apart following a war against a wizard

cabal and its demonic servants. Many members of the

original  group  became  verdant lordsperhaps  from a

desire  to form a  deeper  and more  personal  bond  with

nature after being dragged into a fight against outsiders.

Thus, they tended to be somewhat reclusive. Now ver-

dant lords  have  become  rare, and they  are  found  only

among  the  older  members  of  the  organization. The

druids and the verdant lords in the order do not com-

petethey  share  too  much  to  become  embroiled  in

petty rivalries.

WATCH DETECTIVE

When thieves and murderers strike in the night, citizens

always wonder whether anyone can track down the per-

petrators and set things straight. When the watch detec-

tive is on the case, they can rest easy.

The watch detective specializes in solving mysteries.

Using a battery of clue-ferreting skills and abilities, he

evaluates  and  discards  possibilities  until  only  one  re-

mainsthe truth. The Rule of Evidence to which he as-

cribes (see sidebar) restrains him from using his gifts to

gain the truth through unfair means, demanding that he

focus only on tangible facts as proof. Of course, once the

watch  detective  solves  the  mystery,  its  likely  that  the

guilty party wont want to be brought to justice. Thus, its

also important for the watch detective to know the tech-

niques of combat.

Fighters  and  warriors  make  up  the  bulk  of  any  city

watch force, but watch detectives often begin their ca-

reers  as  rangers  or  rogues. The  vast  majority  of  the

rangers who opt for this prestige class are urban rangers

(see  Chapter  1). Wizards,  sorcerers,  clerics,  and  bards

make especially good watch detectives when they can

qualify for the class, though they may find that the Rule

of  Evidence  hampers  their  ability  to  get  at  the  truth.

Elves find this lifestyle especially gratifying because it

celebrates the mind in a not-too-subtle show of intellec-

tual superiority. Gnomes and halflings have the inquisi-

tive  streak  necessary  for  this  career,  and  they  have

established many an effective city watch force in lands

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

where their size would otherwise be a detriment.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features

The  following  are  class  features  of  the

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:

Watch detectives are proficient with light

armor and simple weapons.

City Watch Training: At 1st level, the

watch detective gains a +2 insight bonus

Spot checks.

Expertise: At 2nd level, the character

The Rule of Evidence

Proof, not suspicion, is the only

evidence  that  matters.  A  sus-

pect may not be charged with a

crime until unimpeachable evi-

dence of his or her involvement

has  been  uncovered,  or  a  con-

fession has been obtained.

Unnecessary  violence  in  the

apprehension  of  a  suspected

criminal  is  not  permitted.  A

suspect  should  be  brought  to

justice rather than killed when-

ever possible.

Seizure of a suspects goods

is  not  permitted,  unless  such

constitute  evidence  to  be  used

in  prosecuting  that  suspect  or

another.

Evidence gained by detection

magic, psionic powers, or other

magical or supernatural means

must  be  backed  up  with  either

physical proof or uncoerced con-

fession. Only concrete forms of

evidence satisfy all members of

a community.

Interrogation  of  a  suspect  is

not permitted unless he or she

consents  or  is  charged  with  a

crime.

Detention  of  a  person  sus-

pected of a crime is not permit-

ted unless a specific charge has

been made.

Protection  of  the  innocent

takes  precedence  over  appre-

hension  of  a  suspected  crimi-

nal.

A  watch  detective  may  not

knowingly commit crimes.

Violation of these codes may

result  in  the  release  of  a  sus-

pect and/or the dismissal of the

watch detective.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Obsessive  Specialty:

When  the  watch  detective

reaches  2nd  level,  he  ob -

sessively  seeks  knowledge

about  a  particular  topic.

Choose  one  Knowledge

skill  for  his  specialty. The

character  thereafter  gains

a  bonus  equal  to  his  watch

detective

level  on  all

Knowledge  checks  of  this

sort.

Profile  (Ex):  Also  at

2nd  level,  the  watch  de-

tective  may  compose  an

image  of  someone  ac-

cused  of  a  crime.  By  mak-

ing  a  successful  Gather  In-

formation  check  (DC  15)

when  talking  with  a  wit-

ness  to  a  crime,  the

watch  detective  can

gain a roughly accu-

rate  mental  pic-

ture  of  the  per-

petrator,

even

if  the  witness  did

not  see  him  or  her.

The  character  may,

if  desired,

commit  this  image  to

paper  using  the  Craft

(painting)  skill.  Either  a  verbal  or  a  visual  de-

piction grants a +2 insight bonus on any further Gather

Information checks made when dealing with witnesses

to that crime or persons acquainted with the perpetrator.

Cooperative Interrogation: At 3rd level, when the

watch detective succeeds in a Bluff check against some-

one, he automatically grants any one other person a +4

circumstance  bonus  on  one  Intimidate  check  against

that same target for 1 round. When the watch detective

succeeds in an Intimidate check, he can give a similar +4

circumstance bonus on someone elses Bluff check. (Two

watch inspectors can support each other with this ma-

neuver for many rounds.)

try

to

Superior Disarming: At 3rd level, the watch detec-

tive is always considered armed when making a disarm

attempt, and he gains a +4 bonus on any attack roll made

to disarm an opponent.

ugurugury y y y y (Sp): The watch detective may ask for

ugurugur

eductive Ae Ae Ae Ae Augur

eductiv

DDDDDeductiv

eductiv

eductiv

a hint to a mystery, puzzle, or trap. As a standard action, the

player makes an assertion that can be true or untrue (such

as The half-orc did it or If I pull the red lever, the door

will open). The DM makes a secret percentile roll (chance

of success = 70% + 1% per watch inspector level), if the roll

is successful, the Dungeon Master gives the player a cor-

rect true or untrue answer to the assertion, though no

reason need be given for why the response is correct. If

the roll fails, the DM provides no information. The Dun-

geon Master is always free to determine that the watch de-

tective doesnt have enough information to make an edu-

cated guess, but in this case the attempt doesnt count

76

against  the  allowed  uses  per

day  of  the ability. The  watch

detective can use this ability

once  per  day  at  4th  level.

Thereafter, he gains one extra

use  per  day  for  every  three

additional  watch  detective

levels gained.

Skill  Synergy:  At  4th

level,  the  watch  detective

may  choose  one  of  the  fol-

lowing  skill  combinations:

Bluff-Gather  Information,

Bluff-Diplomacy,  Climb -

Move  Silently,  Diplomacy-

Gather  Information,  Dis-

guise -Gather  Information,

Gather  Information-Sense

Motive, Hide-Move Silently,

Listen-Read  Lips,  Listen-

Spot,  Sense  Motive-Spot,

Spot-Disable  Device,

Spot- Open  Lock,  or

Spot-Search.  If  he  has

at  least  5  ranks  in

both  of  the  selected

skills,  he  gains  a  +2

synergy  bonus  on

checks involving both.

No  Subdual  Penalty

(Ex):  At  5th  level,  the  watch

detective  can  deal  subdual  damage

that  deals  normal  damage

with  a  weapon

without suffering a 4 penalty on the attack.

Sense Secret Doors (Ex): A 5th-level or higher watch

detective who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or

concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it

as if he were actively looking for it. An elven watch de-

tective  gains  a  +2  insight  bonus  on  any  Search  check

made to find a secret or concealed door.

bject

bject (Sp): At 6th level, the watch detective can

produce an effect identical to that of a locate object spell

cast by a sorcerer of his watch detective level.

Improved Subdual (Ex): At 7th level, the watch de-

tective adds his Intelligence bonus on the subdual dam-

age he deals whenever he makes an attack that can cause

subdual damage only.

Forensics (Su): With a successful Search check (DC

20), an 8th-level or higher watch detective can discern

the  cause  of death  of  any  corpse  he  examines.  Given

time, he may take 20 on this roll. Success indicates that

he knows what killed the person, the size and approxi-

mate strength of any attacker responsible, and any other

key information the DM wishes to impart.

Instant Knowledge (Su): Once per day, a 10th-level

20). He may not take 10 or take 20 on this check. If suc-

cessful, he gains a +10 insight bonus on one Knowledge

check of any category. If he has no ranks in that particu-

lar Knowledge skill, he may make the check untrained.

WINDRIDER

The  windrider  is  a  specialist  in  mounted  combat,  but

hers is no ordinary mount. The creature she rides is at

least unusual and often raresometimes even bizarre.

Although an experienced windrider can ride anything

that runs, swims, or flies, the typical member of this pres-

tige class settles on one particular kind of mount as a per-

sonal favorite.

Some windriders are no more than swaggering, arro-

gant adventurers looking for a good fight. Perhaps their

pride  is  justified,  considering  the  creatures  theyve

turned into mounts. Many, however, are just as happy to

sit back and tell stories of how they got their mounts and

the adventures theyve had since, no matter who buys the

ale. The typical windrider cheerfully shares her knowl-

edge about her various mounts with those who seek to

ride similar creatures.

Since the skills they develop vary as widely as the abil-

ities and natures of their mounts, windriders are a very

independent bunch. Thus, they rarely form or belong to

close-knit groups. Even a paladin windrider tends to be

something of a knight-errant.

All races have produced windriders, though the class

is particularly popular with humans and giants. Rangers,

paladins, fighters, and barbarians all make excellent win-

driders because they can easily accumulate the prerequi-

sites.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To become a windrider, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Handle Animal 8 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 6

ranks, Ride 8 ranks.

Feats: Mounted Combat.

Special: Must have a mount.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Class Skills

The windriders class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Balance (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (any)

(Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal

(Wis), Jump (Str), Knowledge (nature), Profession (any)

(Wis), and Ride (Dex). See Chapter 4 of the Players Hand-

book for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the windrider prestige

class. For the abilities described below, a mount is a crea-

ture that fits the criteria in the Whats a Mount? section

below.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:  Windriders  are

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types

of armor, and shields.

Spells per Day: A windrider can cast a small number

of divine spells. Her spells are based on Wisdom, so cast-

ing any given spell requires a Wisdom score of at least 10

+ the spells level. The DC for saving throws against these

spells is 10 + spell level + the windriders Wisdom modi-

fier. When the table indicates that the windrider is enti-

tled to 0 spells of a given level (such as 0 1st-level spells

at  1st  level),  she  gets  only  those  bonus  spells  that  her

Wisdom  score  allows.  A  windrider  prepares  and  casts

spells just like a druid does, but she must choose them

from the spell list, below.

Appraise Mount (Ex): At 1st level, a windrider can

compare two mounts of the same kind and tell at a glance

which one is superior (stronger, faster, more intelligent,

better stamina, and so on). If desired, the windrider can

also conduct a point-by-point comparison of two mounts.

By spending 1 round examining both, she can determine

which has the higher score in any single ability of her

choice. After a second round of study, a windrider famil-

iar with that kind of creature can also determine whether

each mounts score in that ability is average, above aver-

age, or below average for the species. After a third round

of study, the windrider can tell how extreme that ability

score  isthat  is, whether  the  modifier  it  generates  is

more than 4 points higher or lower than the average tor

that species. The appraise mount ability never produces a

numerical  rating;  DMs  must  describe  the  windriders

findings.

CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Chosen  Mount: The  windrider  may  designate  any

one  mount  she  has  previously  ridden  as  her  chosen

mount. This creature may not be a bonded companion

(such as a familiar, paladins mount, or animal compan-

ion)  to  anyone  else  at  the  time,  and  if  its  Intelligence

score is 3 or higher, it must also agree to this relation-

ship. The windrider can use any means desired to obtain

this agreementthe Diplomacy skill, bribery, or even

magical persuasionbut the creature must be willing.

The windrider must spend a minimum of three days

training her chosen mount before any benefits accrue.

Thereafter, the creature gains the advantages listed on

Table 521 based on the windriders level. The creature

retains  its  own  type  and  gains  no  abilities  other  than

those listed, though it is considered a bonded compan-

ion for the unbond ability (see the blighter prestige class

earlier in this chapter).

The  windrider  may  have  only  one  chosen  mount  at  a

time, and either party may sever this relationship at any

time without penalty. Once it ends, the mount loses the

benefits it gained according to Table 521. If the chosen

mount is a paladins warhorse, the rules in the Paladins

Mount sidebar in the Players Handbook supersede those

given here.

Empathic Link (Su): The windrider has an empathic

link with her chosen mount. This ability works like the

empathic link that a paladin has with her mount (see Pal-

adin in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook).

Mount Proficiency: At 1st level, the windrider gains

a +2 competence bonus on any check to avoid being un-

seated while riding her chosen mount. In addition, she

can ride any mount with 4 Hit Dice or less at the full ben-

efit of her Ride skill, suffering neither the 2 penalty for

riding similar mounts nor the 5 penalty for riding dis-

similar mounts. The Hit Dice of the mounts to which this

latter benefit applies increase with windrider level: 8 Hit

Dice at 4th level, 12 Hit Dice at 6th level, 16 Hit Dice at

8th level, and any mount at 10th level.

Mount Assistance (Ex): At 2nd level, the windrider

can assist any mount  she is riding in one of two ways

per use of the ability. First, she can use the cooperation

and aid another rules (Chapter 4 and Chapter 8 respec-

tively  of  the  Players  Handbook)  to  provide  a  +4  bonus

(double the usual amount) to her mounts Armor Class

or on any single attack roll or any skill or ability check

the mount attempts. Alternatively, she can provide her

mount  a  +10  competence  bonus  to  speed  for  1  full

round. Mount assistance is usable once per round and

requires a standard action.

Mount Feat: At 2nd level, a windrider can grant her

chosen mount one bonus feat from the Mount Feats list,

below. This  feat  does  not  count  against  the  creatures

normal feat capacity, though it must still meet all prereq-

uisites for it, as noted in the appropriate feat description

in  this  book  or  Chapter  5  of  the  Players  Handbook. To

grant a bonus feat, the windrider must spend one month

training the mount. The windrider can bestow a second

bonus feat on the same mount at 5th level, and a third at

9th level. These additional bonus feats require the same

training time as the first. The windrider can train only

Ex-Windriders

A windrider who intentionally mistreats any mount she

has ridden loses all windrider prestige class abilities, and

her chosen mount immediately terminates that relation-

ship. Until she atones (see the atonement spell descrip-

tion  in  the  Players  Handbook),  creatures  of  the  same

species as her last chosen mount treat her with enmity,

which  manifests  as  a  4  racial  penalty  on  interactions

with creatures of the same species as that mount and a 2

racial penalty on interactions with any other creature ca-

pable of serving her as a mount.

What(cid:146)s a Mount?

You cant just hop on and ride any creature, even if you

have the Ride skill for that creature type. A mount must

have all the following characteristics.

Be able and willing to carry its rider in a typical fash-

ion. (A camel trained with the Handle Animal skill to

bear a rider is able and willing. A tiger

might be able but not willing. A giant

might be willing but not truly able. An

intelligent creature  whose  alignment

differs  significantly  from  yours  is

unlikely to be willing.)

Be at least one size category larger than

you. Also, a flying mount can carry no

more than its maximum light load aloft.

(This  is  a  change  from  the  Monster

Manual, which says that a flying crea-

tures  carrying  capacity  is  equal  to  its

medium load limit.)

Have a CR no higher than your charac-

ter level 3. If the mount can fly, its CR

can be no higher than your character

level 4.

Other Mount Feats

The DM might decide to make

additional  feats  available  to

mounts. The feats given in the

windrider class description are

from  the  core  books  and  this

book.  You  might  consider  the

following as well:

From Sword and Fist: Blind-

sight 5-foot Radius, Close Quar-

ters  Fighting,  Dirty  Fighting,

Dual Strike, Improved Overrun,

Power Lunge.

From Defenders of the Faith:

Extra Smiting.

From Song and Silence: Dash,

Fleet of Foot.

Any animal or beast can be trained to bear

a rider with the Handle Animal skill, as

described  in  the  appropriate  skill  description  in  the

Players Handbook. In addition, the windrider can use this

skill to train a creature of any other type that has an In-

telligence score of 2 or below to bear a rider. The category

of  the task and its Handle  Animal DC are as given on

Table 522.

Any creature not of the animal type counts as a beast for

this  check,  regardless  of  its  actual  type.  Any  of  these

forms of training requires two months, as noted in the

skill description.

Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher

needs no Handle Animal check to learn how to bear a

rider. If it is willing to serve as a mount, it can determine

for  itself  how  it  must  move  to  manage  the  additional

weight,  how  to  interpret  its  riders  directional  com-

mands, and so forth. It does, however, require at least one

week of training with a rider before it can perform as a

mount.

CHAPTER 6:

SPELLS

What is natural magic? What makes draids stand above those

mired in civilized trinket-worship? Certainly natural magic is

the ability to bend the universe to serve your will, but even a

mason  can  force  stone  to  serve  his  needs.  Certainly  natural

magic is the power to do whal others cannot, bul any aristocrat

will tell you he can do what other men cannot. No, natural

magic is more than this. If is the command of the ineffable, of

the earth, of the spirit, and of the elementsthe command of all

this through a focused mind and soul.

A druid is a healer with mastery over weather, plants, and

animals. The  water  you  drink,  the  food  on  your  table,

even  the air  you  breatheall  these  are  subject  to  the

druids power. A neophyte druid can find the lost mem-

bers of a herd (detect animals or plants), repair damaged

pots  and  clothes  (mending),  and  soothe  a  wild  animal

(calm animals). Yet, unlike the typical good cleric, she is

more than just a civil servant. Before long, she can repel

her enemies with spells such as heat metal, produce flame,

and summon natures ally.

As a druid grows in power, her mastery of the natural

world increases. She can speak with, and soon control, ani-

mals and even plants. Foes foolish enough to cross her path

may find themselves poisoned, diseased, or plagued with

swarms  of  insects.  Meanwhile,  she  can  walk  bravely

through the harshest of environments and easily resist mag-

ical attacks of cold and fire. Then, at 7th level, the druid

gains something that the cleric never does. With reincarnate,

the druid can offer anyone a new lease on life. Even the aged

can be reborn into a young body through her power.

A druid at the height of her career knows little in the

way of limitation. She can cure any ill (heal), alter the cli-

mate (control weather), and slay her foes in their tracks

just by pointing (finger of death). The very earth trembles

beneath her feet (earthquake). At this point, her divine

spells  are  the  most  concrete  manifestation  of  natures

power in the world.

This chapter includes more than fifty new spells for

druids and rangers to cast. A few of these are also avail-

able to other spellcasters.

those listed in the Animal Companions sidebar in Chap-

this book. The animal retains no knowledge of the trick

after performing it.

You reduce the target animals size by one category. For

example, a Large tiger affected by this spell becomes a

Medium-size  tiger. This  decrease  in  size  allows  the

animal to fit better into tight spaces, such as the typical

dungeon  room  or  subterranean  passage.  The  size

change also has a number  of  other  effects,  as  given in

A  begun  is  a  small  nature  servant  created  by  a  druid.

Like  a  homunculus,  it  is  an  extension  of  its  creator,

sharing the same alignment and link to nature. A bogun

does not fight particularly well, but it can perform any

simple action, such as attacking, carrying a message, or

opening a door or window. For the most part, a bogun

simply carries out its creators instructions. Because it is

self-aware and somewhat willful, however, its behavior

is not entirely predictable. On rare occasions (5% of the

time), the  bogun  may  refuse  to  perform  a  particular

task.  In  that  case,  the  creator  must  make  a  Diplomacy

check (DC  11)  to  convince  the  creature  to  cooperate.

Success  means  the  bogun  performs  the  task  as  re-

quested; failure indicates that it either does exactly the

opposite  or  refuses  to  do  anything  at  all  tor  one  day

(DMs option as to which).

A  bogun  cannot  speak,  but  the  process  of  creating

one links  it  telepathically  with  its  creator.  It  knows

what  its  creator  knows  and  can  convey  to  him  or  her

everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 500 yards.

A  bogun  never  travels  beyond  this  range  willingly,

though it can be removed forcibly. In that case, it does

everything  in  its  power  to

regain  contact  with  its  creator.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

An  attack  that  destroys  a  bogun  also  deals  its  creator

2d10 points of damage. If the creator is slain, the bogun

also  dies,  and  its  body  collapses  into a heap of rotting

vegetation.

A  bogun  looks  like  a  vaguely  humanoid  mound  of

compost. The creator determines its precise features, but

the typical bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a

wingspan of about 2 feet. Its skin is covered with nettles

and branches.

COMBAT

A  bogun  attacks  by  brushing  against  opponents  with

harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison.

Poison (Ex): Nettles, Fort save (DC 11); initial and sec-

ondary  damage  1d6  temporary  Dex. The  creator  of  a

bogun is immune to its poison.

Construct Traits:  Immune  to  mind-influencing

effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. Not subject to

critical  hits,  subdual  damage, ability  damage,  energy

drain,  or  death  from  massive  damage.  Although  it  is

made of vegetable matter, a bogun is not a plant and is

therefore is not subject to spells that affect only plants.

CONSTRUCTION

Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural

materials available in any torcst. Thus, there is no gold

piece cost for its creation. All materials used become per-

manent parts of the bogun.

The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the

Craft Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before cast-

ing  any  spells,  a  physical  form  must  be  woven  out  of

living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the mag-

ical energy. A bit of the creators own body, such as a few

strands of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorpo-

rated into this crude mannequin. The creator may assem-

ble  the  body  personally  or  hire  someone  else  to  do  it.

Creating the mannequin requires a Craft (basketweaving

or weaving) check (DC 12).

Once the body is finished, the creator must animate

it  through  an  extended  magical ritual  that requires  a

week to complete. The creator must labor for at least 8

hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any

interruption from another sentient creature undoes the

magic. If the creator is personally weaving the creatures

body,  that  process  and  the  ritual  can  be  performed

together.

When not actively working on the ritual, the creator

must  rest and can  perform  no  other  activities  except

eating, sleeping, or talking. Missing even one day causes

the  process  to  fail.  At  that  point,  the  ritual  must  be

started anew, though the previously crafted body and the

grove can be reused.

On the final day of the ritual, the creator must person-

ally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These

spells  can  come  from  outside  sources,  such  as  scrolls,

rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers.

are immune to both aspects of this spell.

Blight

Necromancy

Level: Clr 5, Drd 4

Components: V S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: See text

Area or Target: See text

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell has two versions. To cast either version, you

must touch a plant and breathe on it.

Blight  Area:  When  you  center  this  spell  on  a  single

normal plant, all normal plants within a 100-foot spread

(including the one on which the spell was centered) im-

mediately die. Flowers wilt, leaves fall to the ground, and

foliage withers. This spell has no effect on the  soil,  so

new  growth  can  replace  the  dead  plants. This  effect

allows no saving throw.

Blight Plant Creature: When targeted on a single mobile

or intelligent  plant,  such  as  a  shambling  mound  or  a

treant, this spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster

level, to a maximum of 15d6. The plant receives a Forti-

tude save for halt damage.

Bloodhound

Divination

Level: Rgr 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1hour/level

84

If you fail a Wilderness Lore check to track a creature

while this spell (unctions, you can immediately attempt

another roll against the same DC to establish the trail. It

the reroll fails, you must search tor the trail for 30 min-

utes (if outdoors) or 5 minutes (if indoors) before trying

again.

Body of the Sun

Transmutation [Fire]

Level: Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 5 ft.

Area: 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

Duration: 1 round/level

By drawing on the power of the sun, you cause your body

to emanate fire. This fire extends 5 feet in all directions

from your body, illuminating the area and doing 1d4+1

points of fire damage (Reflex save for half) to any crea-

ture it touches except you.

Bottle of Smoke

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Drd 4, Rgr 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Effect: One smoky, horselike creature

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You use a tire source to create a plume of smoke, which

you  capture  in  a  special  bottle  youre  holding.  It the

bottle is thereafter opened before the spell duration ex-

pires,  the  smoke  emerges  to  form  a  vaguely  horselike

creature  made  of  wisps  of  smoke.  It  makes  no  sound,

and anything that touches it simply passes through it.

To mount this smoke horse, the would-be rider must

make a successful Ride check (DC 10) while holding the

bottle in one hand. Anyone attempting to mount with-

out  the  bottle  simply  passes  through  the  horses  form

Letting go of the bottle after mounting causes the rider

to fall through the horses smoky form; he or she cannot

thereafter remount without the intact bottle in hand. It

the bottle is broken, the spell ends immediately and the

rider (if mounted.) falls to the ground.

The  smoke  horse  has  a  speed  of  20  feet  per caster

level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can send smoke bil-

lowing  out  behind  it  at  the  riders  behest,  leaving

behind a bank of smoke 5 feet wide and 20 feet high as

it  moves.  A  wind  that  is  at  least  severe (31+  mph,  or

magical wind of any kind, disperses the horse (and any

smoke it has produced; instantly. Otherwise, the bank

of  smoke lasts  10  minutes, starting on the turn  it was

laid down. Starting or stopping the smoke trail is a free

action. The mount and the smoke trail it produces give

one-half  concealment  (.20%  miss  chance)  to  anyone

behind them.

The mount is immune to all damage and other attacks

because material objects and spells simply pass through

it. It cannot attack.

The rider can return the  smoke  horse  to  the bottle,

and thus pause the spell, at any time by simply uncork-

ing it (a move-equivalent action) and stoppering it again

(another  move-equivalent  action)  in  the  next  round

after the horse is inside. If the bottle is reopened later,

the spell reactivates with its remaining duration intact.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

An entangled creature can try to break free and move

at half normal speed by using a full-round action to make

a  Strength  check  or  Escape  Artist  check  (DC  20).  A

nonentangled creature can move through the area at half

speed,  taking  damage  as  described  above.  Each  round

nonentangled creatures remain in the area, the plants at-

tempt to entangle them.

The plants provide one-quarter cover for every 5 feet

of substance between a creature in the area and an oppo-

nentone-half for 10 feet of briar web, three-quarters for

15 feet, and total cover for 20 feet or more.

The DM may alter the effects of the spell somewhat,

based on the nature of the available plants.

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject retains his or her form, but appears to be com-

posed of water. While underwater, the subject functions

as if affected by blur, freedom of movement, and water breath-

ing and doesnt suffer subdual damage from water pres-

sure or hypothermia for the duration of the spell. Outside

(or even partially outside) of water, the subject gains none

of these advantages except water breathing. He or she may

leave and reenter water without ending the spell.

Components: V, S, DF

Regardless of how much duration

remains  unused,  the  spell  ceases  functioning  one  day

after it is cast. If dispelled at any time while the bottle is

corked, the spell ends.

Area: Plants in a 40-tt.-radius spread

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

This spell causes grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees to

grow  thorns  and  then  wrap, twist,  and  entwine  about

creatures in the area, holding them fast. Creatures that

stand still are entangled but experience no other effects

and  take  no  damage.  A  creature  attempting  an  action

(attack, cast a spell with a somatic component, move, or

the like) takes thorn damage of 1d4 points +1 additional

point per caster level and must make a successful Reflex

save  or  be  entangled  (2  penalty  on  attack  rolls,  4

penalty  to  effective  Dexterity,  and unable  to  move).

Anyone trying to cast a spell within the area must also

make  a  Concentration  check  (DC  15  + spell  level  +

damage taken) or lose the spell.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

allow  each  subject  to  move  straight  up  or  down  at  a

speed of up to 30 feet or laterally with a fly speed of 60

feet  (perfect),  as  desired.  (Lateral  movement  is  pos-

sible  only  for  a  subject  who  is  already  at  least  90  feet

off  the  ground.) To  touch  the  earth  again,  a  subject

must use a standard action to shake off the cloudstuff,

which  ends  the  spell  for  that  creature.  You  may  dis-

miss the spell, but only for all subjects at oncean act

that  can  have  significant  consequences  for  subjects

already in the air.

from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever,

mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (see Dis-

ease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide for de-

scriptions).  Any  living  creature  you  hit  with  a  melee

touch  attack  during  the  spells  duration  is  affected  as

though by the contagion spell, immediately contracting

the disease you have selected unless it makes a successful

Fortitude save. You cannot infect more than one creature

per round.

Countermoon

Abjuration

Level: Drd 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + S ft./2 levels)

Target: One lycanthrope

Duration: 12 hours

Saving Throw: Will negates (D)

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell stops a lycanthrope from changing form, pre-

venting both voluntary shapechanging via the alternate

form ability and involuntary shapechanging because of

lycanthropy. The subject retains whatever form he or she

had when the spell was cast for the duration; even death

does not cause reversion to normal form until the spell

ends. Natural lycanthropes gain a +4 competence bonus

on the saving throw against this spell.

Material Component: Hair, scale, or other castoff from

the creature to be affected.

Creeping Cold

Transmutation [Cold]

Level: Drd 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

86

Duration: 3 rounds

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You turn the subjects sweat to ice, creating blisters as the

ice forms on and inside the skin. The spell deals 1d6 cu-

mulative points of cold damage per round it is in effect

(that is, 1d6 on the 1st round, 2d6 on the second, and 3d6

on the third). Only one save is allowed against the spell;

if successful, it halves the damage each round.

Focus: A small glass or pottery vessel worth at least 25

gp filled with ice, snow, or water.

Darkseed

Transmutation

Level: Drd 0

Components: V, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft.+ 5 ft/2 levels)

Target: One normal plant or plant creature

Duration: 1 day

Saving Throw: Reflex negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

If  the  target  fails  its  Reflex  save,  it  takes  1  point  of

damage when the spell is cast and another every hour

while it is in effect. Hardness is ignored for damage from

darkseed. It would take weeks to kill a large tree with suc-

cessive applications of this spell, but a small plant would

die in a matter of hours. Darkseed does not affect plant

creatures with Wisdom and Charisma scorcs.

Dawn

Abjuration

Level: Drd 0, Rgr 1

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: All creatures within a 15-ft.-radius burst centered

on you

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

All sleeping creatures in the area awaken. Those who are

unconscious  because  of  subdual  damage  wake  up  and

become staggered (see Subdual Damage in Chapter 8 of

the Players Handbook). This  spell  does  not  affect  dying

creatures.

Daze Animal

Enchantment [Compulsion, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Drd 0

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Components: V, S

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target:  One Medium-size  or  smaller  animal  with  less

than 5 HD

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This enchantment clouds the target animals mind. The

subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special advan-

tage against it, but it cannot move or attack.

Decomposition

Necromancy

Level: Drd 2

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 50 ft.

Area: All enemies within a 50-ft.-radius emanation cen-

tered on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

Whenever an enemy within the area suffers normal (not

subdual) damage, that wound festers for an additional 1

point of damage per round thereafter for the duration of

the spell. A successful Heal check (DC 15) or the appli-

cation of any cure spell or other healing magic (heal, heal-

ing circle, and so on) stops the festering. Only one wound

festers at a time; additional wounds suffered while the

first is still festering are not subject to this effect. Once

festering  has  been  stopped,  however,  any  new  wound

suffered while the subject is within the area (before the

spell expires) begins the process anew.

For example, a subject who takes 6 points of damage

from an attack while within the area of a decomposition

spell suffers 1 point of damage from festering the next

round, and another 1 point on the round after that. On

the  following  round,  that  subject  receives  4  points  of

healing  from  a cure  light  wounds  spell,  so  the  festering

stops  and  the  subject  takes  no  festering  damage  that

round. The next round, the subject remains within the

emanation  and  takes  another  3  points  of  damage  in

battle. The festering begins again, inflicting 1 point of

festering damage on the next round.

Detect Favored Enemy

Divination

Level: Rgr 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: Quarter circle emanating from you to the extreme

of the range

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  can  sense  the  presence  of  a  favored  enemy. The

amount of information revealed depends on how long

you study a particular area.

1st Round: Presence or absence of a favored enemy in

the area.

2nd Round: Types of favored enemies in the area and

the number of each type.

3rd  Round: The  location  and  HD  of  each  individual

present, as though revealed by a power sight effect.

Note: Each round you  can  turn  to  detect  things  in  a

new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3

feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Druid Grove

Transmutation

Level: Drd 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: At least 10 minutes (see text)

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft/2 levels)

Target: One or more trees

Duration: 1 day/level or until discharged

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

By casting druid grove, you reshape a living tree so that it

can contain a spell. Thereafter, you can access this stored

spell at any rime, as if the tree were a very large, immo-

bile scroll.

In  conjunction  with  druid  grove,  you  can  cast  druid

spells  totaling  no  more  than  one-third  of  your  caster

level (rounded down, maximum 6th). Instead of taking

effect, these companion spells are stored in trees within

the area. Each tree can hold only one spell. Druid grove

and  the  companion  spells  must  all  be  cast  during  the

same uninterrupted ritual. The 10-minute casting time

noted above is the minimum for the entire ritual, if any

of the companion spells take longer than 10 minutes to

cast, use the actual total casting time instead.

By touching the tree that contains a companion spell

(a standard action), you can activate that spell instanta-

neously. You must make any decisions about its effect

(such  as  targeting  and  direction)  upon  touching  the

tree.

You may have only one druid grove in effect at a time. If

you cast a second druid grove before the first expires or is

fully discharged, the first is dispelled.

A tree affected by druid grove detects as magical, but the

detection process does not harm the tree in any way.

Embrace the Wild

Transmutation

Level: Drd 3, Rgr 3

Components: V, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 minutes/level

This spell allows you to adopt the nature and some abili-

ties of a wild animal. You retain your own form, but you

gain the natural and extraordinary senses of the creature

you choose, as well as its skill ranks (though these do not

stack with any ranks you already have in the same skills),

for the duration of the spell. Thus, depending on your

choice of animal, you could gain blindsight, scent, and

ranks in Listen, Spot, or other skills. Embrace the wild does

not grant you the animals natural attacks, methods of lo-

comotion,  feats,  or  nonsensory  extraordinary  abilities,

such as trample or improved grab.

Focus: Hide, skin, or feathers of the selected animal, or

an item or component of its lair. You must have obtained

the focus from the animal yourself.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

Epidemic

Necromancy

Level: Drd 9

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Feathers

Transmutation

Level: Drd 4

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One willing creatures/level

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Upon  casting  this  spell,  you  must  choose  one  disease

from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever,

mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (see Dis-

ease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide for de-

scriptions). The touched creature contracts the disease

you have selected immediately (no incubation period)

unless it makes a successful Fortitude save.

Unlike a creature affected by contagion, the subject of

an epidemic spell becomes a powerful vector for spreading

the disease. As long as the subject is afflicted with the

disease, any living creature (except the caster) within 30

feet of him or her must make a Fortitude save or imme-

diately contract the disease, regardless of its usual incu-

bation  period  or  method  of  transmission.  Anyone

infected  in  this  manner  also  becomes  a  vector  for  the

disease and can spread it in the same manner.

The save DC drops by 1 each day after the spell is cast,

regardless of when any particular creature contracted it.

A creature that makes a successful Fortitude save against

this particular epidemic cannot contract that disease by

any means for one day. Thereafter, coming within 30 feet

of an infected creature requires another save, with the

same consequences for failure or success.

You are immune to any infection that originates from

your own casting.

False Bravado

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Drd 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One humanoid

Duration: 3 rounds + the subjects Constitution modifier

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

False bravado causes the subject to grow overconfident,

believing that he or she has gained the full effects of a

barbarians rage (Constitution and Strength bonuses as

well  as  improved Will  saves).  In  fact,  however, the af-

fected  creature  incurs  all  the  penalties  of  a  barbarians

rage but gains none of its advantages. The subject suffers

a 2 penalty to AC and cannot use skills or abilities that

require  patience  and  concentration,  such  as  moving

silently or casting spells. At the end of the spells dura-

tion, the  creature  is  fatigued  (2  penalties  to  Strength

and Dexterity, unable to charge or run) for the rest of that

encounter.

Focus:  A small  mirror with a sigil of bravery painted

upon it, worth at least 25 gp.

This spell functions like polymorph other, except that you

polymorph each subject into a feathered animal of Small

size or smaller (your choice of species, but all subjects

take the same form). Any subject may choose to resume

his or her normal form (as a full-round action); doing so

ends the spell for that individual alone. Otherwise, all

subjects remain in the bird form until the spell expires or

you dismiss it, restoring all affected creatures to normal

form.

Fire Eyes

Transmutation

Level: Drd 0

Components: V, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Fire  eyes  grants  the  subject  the  ability  to  see  through

normal  smoke,  fire,  and  fog  as  if  they  werent  there.

While  the spell functions, other creatures do not gain

concealment from these effects with respect to the sub-

ject. This spell does not enable a subject to see through

magical fog, such as obscuring mist and fog cloud.

Forestfold

Transmutation

Level: Drd 4, Rgr 3

This spell grants you a +20 competence bonus on Hide

and  Move Silently  checks.  It  is  otherwise  the  same  as

camouflage.

Greater Call Lightning

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Drd 6

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 10 minutes, +1 action per bolt called

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Effect: See text

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Reflex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is similar to call lightning, except that you may

call down bolts every 5 minutes. To cast greater call light-

ning, you must be in a stormy areaa rain shower, a tor-

nado  (including  a  whirlwind  formed  by  a  djinn or air

88

elemental of 7 HD or more), clouds and wind, or even

hot and cloudy conditions will do. While you are in such

an area, you can call down one bolt of lightning every 5

minutes. You  need  not  do  so  immediately  upon  cast-

ingother actions, even spellcasting, can be performed

at  any  time  during  the  spells  duration.  However, you

must use a standard action to concentrate on the spell

when you call each bolt.

Each  bolt  of  lightning  flashes  down  in  a  vertical

stroke,  striking  any  target  point  you  designate  that  is

within range (measured from your position at the time).

It takes the shortest possible unobstructed path between

a nearby cloud and the target point. Any creature within

a 10-foot radius of the bolts path or the point where it

strikes is affected. Each bolt deals 1d10 points of electri-

cal damage per caster level (maximum 15d10).

Greater call lightning is usable only outdoors; it does not

function indoors, underground, or underwater. The spell

ends if you leave the stormy area.

Greater Creeping Cold

Transmutation [Cold]

Level: Drd 7

Duration: See text

This spell is the same as creeping cold, but it adds a fourth

round to the duration, during which it deals 4d6 points

of damage, if the caster is at least 15th level, it adds a fifth

round at 5d6 points of damage. If the caster is at least

20th level, it adds a sixth round at 6d6 points of damage.

Green Blockade

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Drd 2

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: 20-ft.-long, 1-ft.-thick wall of vegetation

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You raise a barrier of plant life before you. Any creature

trying to pass through this blockade must succeed at a

Strength check (DC 15) to do so; success ends its move-

ment on the other side of the wall. Fire burns away the

blockade in 1 round, or creatures with appropriate im-

plements can chop through it in 1 minute.

Hawkeye

Transmutation

Level: Drd 1, Rgr 1

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 minutes/level

This spell gives you the ability to see accurately at long

distances. Your range increment for projectile weapons

increases by 50%, and you gain a +5 competence bonus

on all Spot checks.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

Invulnerability to Elements

Abjuration

Level: Drd 9

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

As  protection  from  all  elements, but  the  target  creature

becomes immune to damage from acid, cold, electricity,

fire, and sonic damage while the spell is in effect.

Kiss of Death

Necromancy

Level: Drd 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (see text)

Your teeth and tongue become coated with a fast-acting,

virulent  poison.  Each  round,  you  may  make  a  melee

touch attack to deliver the poison via a kiss. The poison

deals 1d10 points of temporary Constitution damage im-

mediately and another 1d10 points of temporary Consti-

tution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage

can  be  negated  by  a  Fortitude  save  (DC  10  +  one-half

caster  level  +  casters  Wisdom  modifier).  If  you  fail  to

overcome a creatures spell resistance, both primary and

secondary damage are negated, but only for that attack, if

you use this attack against that creature again while the

spell is in effect, you can try again to overcome its spell

resistance.

Languor

Transmutation

Level: Drd 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Ray

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell causes creatures it hits to become weak and

slow. A subject who fails a Will save is slowed as the spell

and  suffers  a  cumulative  enhancement  penalty  to

Strength equal to 1d61 per two caster levels (minimum

additional penalty of 0, maximum of 10) each round. If

the subjects Strength drops below 1, it is helpless. This

spell does not counter haste nor it is countered by it, but

a hasted creature can be brought to normal speed by lan-

guor, and a creature affected by languor can be brought to

normal speed by haste.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

Last Breath

Necromancy

Level: Drd 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Dead creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

With this spell, you can return a dead creature to 0 hit

points,  provided  it  died  within  the  last  round.  You

suffer 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die of the creature

affected, and your spell resistance cannot overcome this

damage.

The subjects soul must be free and willing to return

(see Bringing Back the Dead in Chapter 10 of the Players

Handbook), if the subjects soul is not willing to return,

the spell does not work; therefore, a subject who wants to

return receives no saving throw.

Last breath cures enough damage to bring the subjects

current hit points to 0. Any ability scores damaged to 0 or

below are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease

are  cured,  but  magical  diseases  and  curses  are  not

undone. The  spell  closes  mortal  wounds  and  repairs

lethal damage of most kinds, but missing body parts are

still missing when the creature returns to life. None of

the dead creatures equipment or possessions are affected

in any way by this spell.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject

loses one level when it returns to life, just as if it had lost

a  level  to  an  energy-draining  creature. This  level  loss

cannot be repaired by any spell. A subject who was pre-

viously 1st level loses 1 point of Constitution instead. A

character  who  died  with  spells  prepared  has  a  50%

chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in

addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting

creature that doesnt prepare spells (such as a sorcerer)

has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as

if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing

spell slots for losing a level.

Last  breath has  no  effect  on  a  creature  that  has  been

dead for more than 1 round. A creature that died from a

death  effect  cant  be  raised  by  this  spell,  nor  can  con-

structs,  elementals,  outsiders,  and  undead  creatures,

last breath cannot bring back a creature who has died of

old age.

Lookingglass

Transmutation

Level: Drd 9

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 hour

Target: A reflective surface at least as big as a Medium-

size creature

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

When you cast this spell, you create one end of a path be-

tween  two  natural  mirrored  surfaces,  such  as  pools  of

water or clear lakes. If you cast a second lookingglass spell

on a similar surface before the duration of the first ex-

pires, you can look through it as if you were using clair-

voyance.  Within  1  minute/level  of  casting  the  second

lookingglass, you and up to one other creature/level may

step through as if affected by teleport without error. This

spell doesnt provide any ability to survive in the location

of either lookingglass, so if you cast it the first spell on a

lake, your allies had better be able to swim. If the spell

duration of the first lookingglass spell elapses before you

can  complete  the  path  with  a  second  casting,  the  first

spell is useless.

Mandragora

Effect: All creatures in a 15-ft. radius

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

With this spell, you can trigger the insightful and bale-

ful magic of a mandrake root. When you pull it from its

dark  container,  you  and  all  other  creatures  within  15

feet  must  make  a Will  save  against  its  scream. Those

who  succeed  gain  a  true  seeing  effect;  those  who  fail

behave as though affected by confusion. Both effects last

until the spell ends.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One animal or tree/three levels, no two of which

may be more than 30 ft. apart

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: See text

like  sentience.  All awakened  creatures  must  be  ot  the

same  kind. To  succeed,  you  must  make  a  successful

Will  save (DC  10  +  the  HD  of  the  highest-HD  target,

or  the  HD  the  highest  target  tree  has  once awakened,

whichever  is  greater).  Failure  indicates  that  the  spell

fails for all targets.

The awakened animal  or  tree  is  friendly  toward  you.

You have no special empathy or connection with it, but it

serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you commu-

nicate your desires to it.

An  awakened tree  has  characteristics  as  if  it  were  an

animated  object  (see  the Monster  Manual),  except  that

its  Intelligence, Wisdom,  and  Charisma  scores  are  all

3d6. Awakened  plants  gain  the  ability  to  move  their

limbs,  roots,  vines,  creepers,  and  so  forth,  and  they

have  senses  similar  to  a  humans. An  awakened animal

has  3d6  Intelligence,  a  +1d3  bonus  to  Charisma,  and

+2 HD.

An awakened  tree or animal can speak one language

that  you  know,  plus  one  additional  language  that  you

know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

XP Cost: 250 XP per creature awakened.

beasts  with  Intelligence  1  or  2,  no  two

of which can be more than 30 ft.

apart

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (see

text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell soothes and quiets the

subjects,  rendering  them  docile

and  harmless.  Animals  trained  to

attack  or  guard,  dire  animals,  leg-

endary  animals,  beasts,  and  magical

beasts  are  entitled  to  saving  throws

against  this  effect;  normal  animals  are

not. (A druid could calm a normal bear

or wolf with little  trouble,  but  its more

difficult to affect a winter wolf, a bulette,

or a trained guard dog.)

The subjects remain where they are and do

not attack or flee. They are not helpless, so

they defend themselves normally if attacked.

Any threat (fire, a hungry predator, or an immi-

nent attack, for example) breaks the spell on the

threatened creatures.

Mass Trance

Enchantment [Compulsion, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Drd 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2, no two of which may be

more than 30 ft. apart

Duration: Concentration

Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chant-

ing) compel the subjects to do nothing but watch you.

Animals  trained  to  attack  or  guard,  dire  animals,  leg-

endary animals, beasts, and magical beasts are entitled to

saving throws; normal animals are not. An affected crea-

ture can be struck (with a +2 bonus on the attack roll, as

if it were stunned), but such an action breaks the spell on

that creature.

Miasma

Evocation

Level: Drd 4

Components: V; S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 it./level)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 5 rounds/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

By  filling  the  subjects  mouth  and  throat  with  un-

breathable  gas,  you  prevent  him  or  her  from  doing

much more than coughing and spitting. The subject can

hold his or her breath for 2 rounds per point of Consti-

tution  but  must  make  a  Constitution  check  (DC  10

+1 per previous success) each round there-

after  to  continue  doing  so.  Failure  on

any  such  check  (or  voluntary  re -

sumption  of  breathing)  causes  the

subject  to  fall  unconscious  (0  hp).

On  the  next  round,  the  subject  drops

to  1  hit  points  and  is  dying;  on  the

third  round,  he  or  she  suffocates  (see  Suf-

focation  in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide).

Power Sight

Divination

Level:. Drd 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target or Area: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You determine the number of Hit Dice (including those

from class levels) a creature currently has. if the creature

has both monster Hit Dice and class levels, power sight re-

veals  only  the  total.  You  cannot  determine  what  class

levels a  creature  has, and negative  levels do not  count

against its HD. For example, both a 10-HD creature and a

10th-level character with 4 negative levels appear as 10-

HD creatures.

Protection from All Elements

Abjuration

Level: Drd 6

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level or until discharged

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

92

The subject becomes invulnerable to acid, cold, electric-

ity, fire, and sonic damage. The spell absorbs damage the

subject would otherwise take from all the above energy

types, regardless of whether the source of damage is nat-

ural or magical. This protection also extends to the sub-

jects equipment. When the spell has absorbed a total of

12 points of damage per caster level dealt by any combi-

nation of the above energy types, it is discharged.

Protection  from all elements  absorbs  only  damage. The

subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as

drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from

lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.

The eftects ot this spell do not stack with those of pro-

tection from elements, endure elements, or resist elements. It a

creature is warded by protection from all elements and any

of these other spells, protection from all elements absorbs

damage until it is discharged.

Regenerate Circle

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Drd 6

This  spell  is  the  same  as regenerate ring,  except that  it

grants fast healing at the rate of 3 hit points per round.

Regenerate Critical Wounds

Conjuration (Healing)

This spell is the  same  as  regenerate  light  wounds,  except

that it grants fast healing at the rate of 4 hit points per

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Clr 1, Drd 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creature touched

Duration: 10 rounds + 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

With a touch ot your hand, you boost the subjects life

energy, granting him or her the fast healing ability for

the duration  of the  spell. This healing  applies  only  to

damage sustained during the spells duration, not to that

from previous injuries. The subject heals 1 hit point per

round of such damage until the spell ends and is auto-

matically stabilized it he or she begins dying from hit

point loss during that time. Regenerate light wounds does

not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suf-

focation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or attach

lost body parts.

The effects ot multiple regenerate spells do not stack,

only the highest-level effect applies. Applying a second

regenerate spell of equal level extends the first spells du-

ration by the full duration of the second spell.

Regenerate Moderate Wounds

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Clr 3, Drd 2

This spell is the  same  as regenerate light wounds,  except

that it grants fast healing at the rate of 2 hit points per

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 20 ft.

Target: One creature/two levels, no two of which can be

more than 30 ft. apart

Duration: 10 rounds + 1 round/two levels

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  invoke  healing  energy  over  a  group  of  creatures,

granting each the fast healing ability for the duration of

the spell. This healing applies only to damage sustained

during the spells duration, not to that from previous in-

juries. Each subject heals 1 hit point per round of such

damage until the spell ends and is automatically stabi-

lized if he or she begins dying from hit point loss during

that time. Regenerate ring does not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a

creature to regrow or attach lost body parts.

The effects of multiple regenerate spells do not stack;

only the highest-level effect applies. Applying a second

regenerate spell of equal level extends the first spells du-

ration by the full duration of the second spell.

Regenerate Serious Wounds

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Clr 5, Drd 4

This  spell  is  the  same  as  regenerate

light wounds, except  that  it

your hands

Duration: Instantaneous

Spell Resistance: Yes

You fire a hail of hot sand from your fingers, dealing 1d6

points of subdual damage to creatures in the arc. (See the

illustration in the burning hands spell description in the

Slime Wave

Conjuration (Summoning)

Level: Clr 7, Drd 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 15-ft.-radius spread

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Reflex negates

Spell Resistance: No

You create a wave of green slime that begins at the range

you choose and violently spreads to the limit of the area.

The wave splashes and splatters as it passes; some slime

clings to any wall or ceiling. Each creature in the area

that  fails  its  Reflex  save  is  covered  with  one  patch  of

green slime for every 5 feet of its face.

Green  slime  devours  flesh  and  organic  materials  on

contact, and even dissolves metal. A patch of green slime

deals 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage per

round  while  it  devours  flesh.  Against  wood  or  metal,

green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignor-

ing the hardness of metal but not that of wood. It does

not harm stone.

On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped

off  a  creature  (most  likely  destroying  the  scraping

device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut

away (applying damage to the victim as well). Extreme

cold or heat, sunlight, or a remove disease spell destroys

Speak with Anything

Divination

Level: Drd 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level

This  spell  grants  you  the  effects  of speak  with  animals,

speak with plants, and tongues, enabling you to communi-

cate  with  any  living  creature,  including  unintelligent

ones such as normal plants. You can ask questions of and

receive answers from any creatures, although the spell

doesnt  make  them  any  more  friendly  or  cooperative

than normal. You can make yourself understood as far as

your voice carries.

You also  gain the  ability  to  speak  with  stone,  metal,

earth,  water,  or  any  other  solid  or  semisolid  object  or

terrain  feature  as  though  under  the  influence  of stone

tell. Any such object or terrain feature can relate to you

who or what has touched it, as well as what is covered

or  concealed  behind  or  under  it,  providing  complete

descriptions  as  requested.  However,  an  objects  per-

spective,  perception,  and  knowledge  may  prevent  it

from  providing  the  details  you  are  looking  for  (DMs

discretion).

This spell does not include a speak with dead effect, so

you cannot access the past memories of dead creatures.

Though you understand every creature and object, you

may speak only one language (or rough equivalent) at a

time.

Speed of the Wind

Transmutation

Components: V, S

Thunderswarm

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Drd 9

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: Pattern of lightning spreads similar to a fireball (see

text)

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None or Reflex half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Like  the  arcane  spell  meteor  swarm,  thunderswarm

evokes blasts similar to those of the spell fireball, except

that this spell creates balls of lightning. When you cast

it,  either  four  large  (2-foot-diameter)  spheres  or  eight

small  (1-foot-diameter)  spheres  spring  from  your  out-

stretched hand and streak in a straight line to the spot

you  designate.  Each  sphere  leaves  a  trail  of  sparks

behind it.

Any creature in the straight-line path of these spheres

is struck by each one and takes a total of 16d6 points of

electricity damage (no save). The spheres dissipate after

dealing this damage.

If the spheres reach their destination, each bursts like

an electrical fireball in a spread. The patterns of their del-

onation and damage dealt to creatures in the area depend

on  the  size  of  the  spheres,  as  follows.  (See  the  meteor

swarm spell description in the Player's Handbook for de-

tails on the patterns.)

Large  Spheres:  Each  large  sphere  has  a  15-foot-radius

spread and deals 4d8 points of electricity damage. The

four spheres explode with their points of origin forming

either  a  large  diamond  or  a  large  box  pattern  (your

choice)  around  the  spells  central  point  of  origin. The

blasts are 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, cre-

ating overlapping areas of the spells effect and exposing

the center to all four blasts.

Small  Spheres:  Each  small  sphere  has  a  7  1/2-foot-

radius spread and deals 2d6 points of electricity damage.

These spheres explode with their points of origin form-

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

ing  either  a  box-within-a-diamond  pattern  or  a  dia-

mond-within-a-box  pattern  around  the  spells  central

point of origin. Each of the patterns outer sides meas-

ures 20 feet long. All four areas overlap in the center of

the pattern, and two or three areas overlap in various pe-

ripheral sections.

A creature caught in one of the blasts may attempt a

Reflex save for half damage. Creatures struck by multiple

blasts must save against each blast separately. Any crea-

ture that fails a save is stunned for 1d4 rounds in addition

to taking full damage.

True Reincarnate

Transmutation

Level: Drd 9

Components: V, S, DF, XP

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Dead creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell is the same as reincarnate, except that the druid

can reincarnate a creature that has been dead up to 10

years per caster level. True reincarnate can even bring back

a subject whose body has been wholly destroyed, pro-

vided that you unambiguously identify that creature in

some fashion (reciting the deceaseds time and place of

birth or death is the most common method).

Upon completion of this spell, the subject has a new

body,  and  all  physical  ills  and  afflictions  are  repaired.

Refer to the description and the table for the reincarnate

spell (in the Players Handbook) to determine the subjects

new  incarnation. When rolling  to  determine  the  new

form, roll twice; the returning creature can select from

either of the two forms indicated.

The subject suffers neither loss of level (or Constitu-

tion point) nor loss of any prepared spells or spell slots.

You can reincarnate someone killed by a death effect

or someone who has been turned into an undead crea-

ture and then destroyed, as well as someone killed by hit

point loss.

XP Cost: 1,000 XP.

Waterball

Evocation

Level: Drd 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reflex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

A waterball is a spherical burst of water that looks like a

blue fireball. As with a fireball, you point your finger and

determine the range (distance and height) at which the

96

waterball is to burst. A blue, pea-sized bead streaks from

the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material

body  or  solid  barrier  prior  to  attaining  the  prescribed

range,  blossoms  into  the  waterball  at  that  point.  (An

early  impact  results  in  an  early  detonation.)  If  you  at-

tempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such

as  an  arrow  slit,  you  must  hit  the  opening  with  a

ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier

and  detonates  prematurely.  (See  the  fireball  spell  de-

scription in the Players Handbook for details of the blast

pattern.)

When  it  detonates, the walerball  deals  1d6  points  of

subdual damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). An af-

fected creature can make a Reflex save for half damage.

Since the damage is subdual rather than energy, it is sub-

ject to damage resistance.

Objects take no damage unless they have a hardness of

0,  in  which  case  they  take  full  damage.  If  the  damage

caused  to  an  interposing  barrier  shatters  or  breaks

through it, the waterball may continue beyond it if the

area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any

other spell effect does.

Material  Component:  A  full  waterskin  that  you  burst

when casting the spell.

Wood Wose

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Drd 1

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One nature servant

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

A wood wose is a translucent, green nature spirit that you

can  command  to  perform  simple  natural  tasks.  It  can

build a campfire, gather herbs, feed an animal compan-

ion, catch a fish, or perform any other simple task that

doesnt involve knowledge of technology. It cannot, for

example, open a latched chest, since it doesnt know how

a latch works.

The wose can perform only one activity at a time, but

it repeats the same activity if told to do so. Thus, if you

commanded it to gather leaves, it would continue to do

so while you turned your attention elsewhere, as long as

you remained within range.

The wose has an effective Strength score of 2, so it can

lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds. It can trigger traps,

but the 20 pounds of force it can exert is not enough to

activate most pressure plates. Its speed is 15 feet in any

direction, even up.

A wood wose cannot attack in any way; it is never al-

lowed an attack roll or a saving throw. It cannot be killed,

but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area

attacks.  If  you  attempt  to  send  the  wose  beyond  the

spells range (measured from your current position), it

ceases to exist.

A Druids Grove

A Web Enhancement for Masters of the Wild

No self-respecting druid would ever live in a city. The

wide-open expanse of nature is her only dwelling

place. But although she is at ease anywhere in the out-

doors, the typical druid has one special place she calls

home. This article details a typical druids grove, along

with all those who live there.

WHAT DOES A DRUIDS

GROVE CONTAIN?

To support a druid and her companions, a grove site

must have several features. First, there must be a place

for the druid to sleep. This can be a natural shelter, such

as a cave, or one built from natural materials, such as a

sod hut or tree house.

berries, tree fruit, and a diverse population of animals.

Though some druids choose to be vegetarians, most do

include meat in their diets. After all, the druid lives off

the land and accepts her part in the food chain, like any

other creature. In addition, most druids maintain at

least one herb garden, and many also cultivate a patch

of vegetables.

The next vital feature is a system of protection for the

druid and her charges, both plant and animal. This

often takes the form of natural barriers, such as briar

hedges or dense forest. Magical protections often come

into play as well, but druids rarely set traps in their

home areas unless they can be sure animals will not

blunder into them and come to harm.

Warmth is another vital issue. If the climate where the

druid lives is temperate or cooler, she requires a good

source of firewood, coal, or other fuel. As with her

other activities, she always harvests firewood in a

manner that ensures that the forest can renew itself.

She clears brush and fallen limbs from the forest floor

and thins the trees to help ensure the forests viability.

Many druids also possess the magic to make warmth

without fire, and they use this ability to avoid overhar-

vesting wood. In addition, druids use natural materials

to make warm clothing and blankets. Each generally

has a cache of tools stashed away for sewing hides and

weaving cloth from plant fibers or animal hair.

Druids like to be prepared for emergencies, so most

keep a supply of important magical and nonmagical

items secreted about their grovesin hollow trees,

under stones, and in unused animal lairs. Stashed magi-

cal items usually include goodberries and infusions of

useful spells (see Masters of the Wild, Chapter 3). Other

useful items include small amounts of money (in case

they need to visit a town), tools for starting a fire, a

knife, torches, extra weapons, and skins of fresh water

and food.

A typical druidic grove features some means for scry-

ingmost often a pool of still, mirrorlike water. A

large, highly polished rock also might make a good

scrying device. In a pinch, a druid can use the create

water spell to produce still water for scrying in a large

container or natural crevice.

A druid usually maintains one or more animal com-

panions at all times. These creatures live with her in her

grove and travel with her as she wishes, though they

must also roam through the area at large to forage for

food. Thus, a reasonably convenient means of egress

from the druids grove must also be made available for

them. Higher-level druids occasionally grant human-

like intelligence to plant or animal creatures through

the awaken spell as well. Though awakened animals are

not required to stay in their native areas, many choose

to do so, either out of love for the land or friendship for

the druid.

A druids grove also supports populations of the types

of animals, feys, and natural creatures that normally

would live in such an area. Druids make an effort not to

disturb the natural environment too much, so they

rarely interfere with these local populations unless the

creatures are nonnative and somehow harmful to the

environment.

SAMPLE DRUIDS GROVE

This is the grove of Thyme, a 12th-level half-elf druid.

An asterisk (*) indicates a new spell or magic item from

Masters of the Wild. See Chapter 3 for magic items or

Chapter 6 for spells.

Thymes grove lies deep in the heart of a temperate

forest. Mature hardwood trees form the bulk of the tree

canopy that shields her activities from view by flying

creatures, though scattered pines and other conifers

also grow throughout the area. Low-growth plants

include berry bushes of several kinds, evergreens, dog-

wood, sumac, and wild flowering plants.

Thymes primary living area is at the base of a cliff. She

has trained natural briars to surround the area on the

other three sides. These thorn bushes rise to a height of

approximately 10 feet, blocking vision and access, and

they average 5 feet in thickness. Though she herself

needs no path through these briarsbecause she can

use her woodland stride ability to passThyme main-

tains a hidden opening through the bushes (Search DC

20) for her wolf and tiger companions. However, this

opening is only 4 1/2 feet tall. It permits access for the

wolf and for the tiger if he lowers his head, but anyone

of human height attempting to use it must stoop or

crawl. Otherwise, the wall counts as thick undergrowth

for the purpose of movement. In addition, any creature

trying to force its way through the briars takes 5 points

of damage per round of movement, minus 1 point for

each point of its AC (Dexterity and dodge bonuses to

AC do not count for this calculation). Chopping away at

the briars creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 5

minutes of work, and normal fire can burn a hole com-

pletely through the thorns in 10 minutes. Of course,

any attempt to harm the barrier draws Thymes ire.

Thyme also maintains an underground tunnel that

connects her living area with the forest beyond the

briars. This tunnel permits passage by Tiny or smaller

creatures  only.  She  adopts  badger  form  when  she

wishes to use it. Normally, Thyme enters and exits her

living area either on the wing (while in the form of a

bird) or via the bushes.

A clear spring erupts from a spot about halfway up the

cliff and runs over the rocks to form a pool at the

bottom. This serves as the druids source of fresh water.

Thyme maintains two shelters within this spacea sod

hut beside the pool and a tree house in one of the outer-

most trees. In front of the hut are her herb garden and

her vegetable garden. Beyond the cultivated areas grow

berry bushes and an orchard of fruit trees. During the

day there is a 10% chance that a wood wose* that Thyme

has conjured with the spell of the same name (see Mas-

ters of the Wild, page 96) is working in the gardens or

caring  for  the  orchard.  A  treant  also  lives  in  the

orchard, and Thyme trusts it to keep watch over the

area when she is absent.

d  Treant: 68 hp (see MONSTER MANUAL entry).

Inside the hut is a bed built from fallen tree branches

and a small area for food preparation, including a fire

pit in the ground. On a nearby table rest a few cooking

pots and wooden dishes. A small loom stands in one

corner of the chamber. A bogun (10 hp, see beget bogun*

spell, Masters of the Wild, page 82) stays in the hut at all

times, doing chores. Under a rock outside the hut are

infusions of regenerate serious wounds, mass calm, and

natures favor. Within the hut are secreted a sack of good-

berries, a pack of adventuring equipment, a polished

rock for scrying, and infusions of briar web*, call light-

ning, camouflage*, magic fang, produce flame, scrying, speed

of the wind*, and wood shape.

On the other side of the hut stands an enormous oak

tree, with a trunk at least 10 feet in diameter. Legend

2

has it that this 200-year-old tree was once the home of

the famous druid Elandra, reputed to be a dryad. Light-

ning has split the tree more than once over the years, so

its branches sprout at odd angles, and new growth has

emerged from deep gashes.

Beyond the pool on the other side of the hut stands a

copse of fir trees on which Thyme has used the spell

druid grove* to store spells in trees as if they were living

scrolls. Each tree contains one of the following spells:

hawkeye*, power sight*, and regenerate moderate wounds*.

Thymes animal companions, a pair of hawks (hp 5, 4),

a tiger (hp 48), a wolf (hp 11), and two badgers (hp 5, 6)

roam the druids living area and the rest of the forest at

will. The tiger and wolf find shelter in caves along the

cliff side; the hawks nest in small trees growing from

clefts in the cliff. The badgers lair near the spot where

the path through the briar hedge emerges into the

grove. The  creatures  attack  intruders  (other  than

Thymes wolf and tiger companions) who disturb them,

making enough noise to alert Thyme and her other

companions.

THYME

Thyme enjoys the company of animals and makes full

use of her wild shape ability. She often roams the woods

beyond her personal grove in the form of an animal.

She has not traveled far beyond the forests in her own

part of the world, so she is limited to the forms of ani-

mals native to temperate climates.

The druid has tailored her feat selection to help her

make better use of her wild shapes. Multiattack gives her

an effective bonus on secondary attacks while she is in

animal form (2 instead of 5 penalty), and Natural

Spell lets her cast spells while in animal form. She keeps

caches of extra spell components stashed around her

grove and in selected spots outside it to ensure that she

has access to as many spells as possible while in wild

shape. (Spell components carried on the druids person

meld into the new form and become unusable while she

is in wild shape.) She also carries a +1 opposable scimitar*,

which she can use while in wild shape so long as she

does not allow it to meld with her new form. (This

means she must put the weapon down before assuming

wild shape and pick it up again after the change.) She

sometimes does not bother to keep the scimitar avail-

able when assuming the form of a bear or other creature

with very effective natural attacks, and she never does it

when assuming the form of a creature (such as a badger)

that is too small to make effective use of the weapon.

Below are full statistics for Thyme in her normal form

and abbreviated statistics for her in several of her

favorite wild shapes. She keeps her base humanoid type,

even though her form is that of an animal. While she is

in her wild shapes she still has access to all the spells

listed for her normal form (assuming she can get to

any stashed material components required) because of

her Natural Spell feat. She likewise still keeps the spe-

cial qualities listed for her normal form; these are

explained in detail only in the description of her

normal form. Possessions not listed in each wild shape

statistics block have melded into her animal form and

are not functional.

Masters of the Wild FAQ

1

9/6/02

The sidebar on page 31 in Masters of the Wild talks about

the  Craft  (herbalism)  skill.  Is  this  a  new  skill  that  is

separate from Profession (herbalist)?

It(cid:146)s not exactly new, but it is not the Profession (herbalist)

skill.  You  use  the  Craft  (herbalism)  skill  to  make  your  own

herbal infusions.

The  chart  showing  the  benefits  of  the  Faster  Healing

feat  on  page  23  of  Masters  of  the  Wild  seems  to  indicate

that  you  are  penalized  for  taking  this  feat  when  healing

ability  score  points  with  long  term  care  and  a  successful

Heal check (3 points per day versus 4 points per day). Is

that right?

The  last  number  in  the  1st  column  (with  Faster  Healing)

should be a 3. The last number in the 2nd column (Complete

Bed Rest) should be a 5.

Does  the  Shadow  feat  from  Masters  of  the  Wild  apply

for all Hide and Spot checks, or does it apply only when

following someone?

The feat applies to any Hide or Spot check.

If you use an infusion to hold a spell with a long casting

time,  will  the  infusion  take  an  equally  long  time  to  take

effect?

No.  An  infusion  takes  effect  immediately  when  imbibed

(which  requires  a  standard  action),  regardless  of  the  spell(cid:146)s

casting time.

The infusion rules include a variant that allows you to

save  some  money  if  you  grow or  collect your own  herbs.

Exactly how much money can you save?

If  you  use  your  own  herbs  in  an  infusion,  you  save  the

entire  monetary  cost  of  the  infusion  (25  gp  per  spell  level

times the caster level of the spell); see page 31 of Masters of

the Wild. You still have to pay the infusion(cid:146)s XP cost.

Is  it  possible  to  share  the  malleability  power  with  a

familiar, special mount, or animal companion?

If the familiar, special mount, or animal companion has the

share  spells  ability,  you  can  share  spells,  spell-like  abilities,

or  supernatural  abilities  with  them,  provided  the  effect  you

share  has  you  as  a  target.  Malleability  has  you  as  a  target.

Note  that  a  familiar,  special  mount,  or  animal  companion

must stay within 5 feet of you at all times to share the effect.

See  Chapter  1  of  Tome  and  Blood  for  a  discussion  of  the

share spells ability.

My  6th-level  ranger  wants  to  advance  her  2  Hit  Die

wolf.  Does  she  have  access  to  the  rules  for  improving

animal  companions  in  Chapter  4  of  Masters  of  the  Wild,

or are those only for druids?

The  material  in  Chapter  4  applies  equally  to  rangers(cid:146)

animal companions.

In  Masters  of  the  Wild,  the  animal  lord(cid:146)s  animal  bond

ability  says  the  ability  functions  as  the  druid(cid:146)s  animal

friendship spell, except that the companions must be from

their  selected  group  and  the  maximum  Hit  Dice  of

companions (whether or not she adventures) equals twice

her animal lord level. The tamer of beasts animal mastery

ability says the tamer can have animal companions whose

Hit Dice total no more than the sum of twice his tamer of

beasts  level  plus  twice  his  caster  level  for  animal

friendship.  It  says  the  Hit  Dice  are  twice  the  level,  but  it

does  not  say  (cid:147)whether  or  not  she  adventures.(cid:148)  For  the

tamer of beasts, are the Hit Dice of companions restricted

to half the normal total for an adventuring character, or

is that restriction lifted as with animal lords?

The  restriction  is  not  lifted  for  tamers  of  beasts  who  are

adventurers.

The  requirements  for  the  snakelord  prestige  class  in

Masters of the Wild include the Resist Poison feat, yet the

snakelord  gains  this  as  her  first  totem.  Is  this  an  error?

Or  perhaps  there  is  no  error  and  the  bonuses  stack  to  a

+8  bonus  on  Fortitude  saves  against  poison  once  the

snakelord reaches 2nd level and obtains her first totem?

The Resist Poison prerequisite for the snakelord is correct.

The  correct  first  totem  power  is  Clever  Wrestling  (even  if

you don(cid:146)t have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat).

What(cid:146)s  going  on  with  the  bloodhound(cid:146)s  pacekeeping

power (from Masters of the Wild)? Is this supposed to be

for  shadowing  or  tracking?  For  shadowing,  it  makes

sense.  For  tracking,  it  doesn(cid:146)t.  If  I(cid:146)m  an  elf,  why  can(cid:146)t  I

go  faster  than  the  halfling  I(cid:146)m  tracking?  Pacekeeping

implies  that  my  speed,  which  is  normally  30,  would  be

limited to 20 while tracking a halfling.

Pacekeeping  allows  you  to  increase  your  speed.  If  you(cid:146)re

already  faster  than  your  mark,  you  don(cid:146)t  have  to  use  the

power. Pacekeeping is for tracking, but if you have a mark in

sight and want to tail the mark (see Song and Silence for rules

on  tailing  someone),  a  bloodhound  can  use  pacekeeping  to

keep up, too.

When  an  exotic  weapon  master  uses  her  improvised

weapon  abilities,  what  size  are  weapons  created  by  the

character? It doesn(cid:146)t say anywhere.

It  depends  on  the  size  of  the  object  used  to  make  the

improvised weapon. In general, an improvised weapon is big

enough for the character to use in one or two hands. Note that

the character gets 1 1/2 times her Strength bonus on damage

when  wielding  the  improvised  weapon  in  two  hands.  The

damage values given in the class description are for weapons

made by Medium-size characters; improvised weapons made

by  larger  or  smaller  creatures  deal  damage  as  listed  in  the

chart below. At 5th level, an exotic weapon master gains the

greater improvised weapon ability, and the damage she deals

with improvised weapons increases. The increased damage is

also listed below.

The  ability  bonuses  granted  by  the  forsaker  prestige

class  are  listed  as  inherent  bonuses.  The  DUNGEON

MASTER(cid:146)s Guide says that an inherent bonus has a limit of

+5  to  any  single  ability  score.  However  this  is  talking

about  magic  items,  so  we  were  wondering  whether  the

forsaker ability bonus stacks with other inherent bonuses

and if it is limited to +5 for any one ability.

The forsaker(cid:146)s ability bonuses are indeed inherent bonuses

just as the class description says, and they follow all the rules

for inherent bonuses listed in the DUNGEON MASTER(cid:146)s Guide;

that  is,  they  do  not  stack  with  other  inherent  bonuses,  and

they are limited to +5 for any single ability score.

The  description  of  the  foe  hunter  prestige  class(cid:146)s  rancor

ability  seems  to  imply  that  it  works  only  with  melee

weapons,  not  projectile  weapons.  Usually,  damage  bonuses

for projectile weapons explicitly list a range limit of 30 feet.

However, there is nothing in the description of the ability that

specifically limits it to melee weapons, nor is there any range

limit specified.

Rancor  applies  to  any  attack  the  foe  hunter  makes,

provided the attack requires an attack roll and deals damage.

There is no range limit.

The  forsaker  from  Masters  of  the  Wild  has  a  damage

reduction ability that is based on the destruction of magic

items  within  a  24  hour  period.  Can  you  store  up  magic

destruction?  Say,  for  instance,  that  my  character  has

damage reduction 7/+3 (so he must destroy 700 gp worth

of  magic  each  day  to  activate  the  damage  reduction).  If

the  character  has  in  his  possession  a  magic  item  worth

1,400  gp,  is  he  now  good  for  two  days  when  destroying

that item?

No, 24 hours is the limit, no matter how much magic you

destroy.

All characters in the D&D game get to raise an ability

score by +1 every four levels (at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and

20th level according to the Player(cid:146)s Handbook). Does this

stack  with  the  forsaker(cid:146)s  +1  ability  score  bonus  at  every

level  of  its  10-level  progression?  Exactly  how  big  is  the

forsaker(cid:146)s ability bonus? Does the forsaker get +1 to add

once at each forsaker level? Or does the forsaker get +1 to

add  at  first  level,  +2  to  add  at  second  level,  on  up  to  a

whopping  +10  at  10th  level?  If  it(cid:146)s  the  former,  do  these

bonuses stack with each other?

A  forsaker  character  can  improve  one  ability  score  for

every 4 character levels, just as any other character can. This

is not an ability score bonus(cid:151)the ability just gets bigger (as

such,  this  increase  stacks  with  anything).  The  forsaker(cid:146)s

ability  bonus  is  a  +1  inherent  bonus  that  the  character  adds

once at each forsaker level. That is +1 at first level, +1 again

at 2nd level, and so on.

Inherent  bonuses,  like all  other bonuses  in  the  game,  do  not

stack  with  each  other.  In  the  case  of  the  forsaker,  however,

the  ability  bonus  class  feature  allows  the  forsaker  to  add

either  a  +1  inherent  bonus  to  an  ability  score  that  does  not

have  an  inherent  bonus  already  or  to  make  an  existing

inherent  bonus  one  point  bigger  (note  that  if  the  character

gained  an  inherent  bonus  to  an  ability  score  from  a  spell  or

magic  item  before  becoming  a  forsaker,  that  bonus  is  lost

upon  becoming  a  forsaker).  No  ability  score  can  have  an

inherent bonus larger than +5, even when the inherent bonus

came from the forsaker class ability.

The  barbarian  gets  damage  reduction  starting  at  11th

level and then every three levels after that. Does this stack

with the damage reduction class feature of the forsaker?

Two  or  more  kinds  of  damage  reduction  do  not  stack.

However, a creature with multiple damage reduction qualities

gets the benefit of the best one for any given attack against it.

For  example,  an  11th-level  barbarian/9th-level  forsaker  has

damage reduction of 1/(cid:150) and 9/+4. If struck by a weapon with

a  +3  magic  bonus  or  less,  the  character  gets  9  points  of

damage  reduction.  If  struck  by  a  weapon  with  a  +4  magic

bonus  or  more,  the  character  still  gets  1  point  of  damage

reduction.

Both  the  forsaker  and  the  foe  hunter  prestige  classes

have stackable spell resistance. Does this stack with spell

resistance  from  a  magic  item?  What  about  racial  spell

resistance? Suppose I have a drow ranger 7/foe hunter 4.

Is his SR equal to 41 (22 racial + 19 foe hunter; assuming

that the +1/level racial bonus also stacks with the +1/level

foe  hunter  bonus)?  What  happens  if  I  add  magic  armor

that grants SR 11? Is my SR now 52?

A  foe  hunter  or  forsaker(cid:146)s  SR  stacks  with  SR  from  most

other  sources;  however,  don(cid:146)t  count  a  character  level  twice

when calculating the character(cid:146)s total SR, and don(cid:146)t stack two

SRs  with  each  other,  only  with  the  prestige  class  bonus.  If

you  have  two  or  more  SRs  that  don(cid:146)t  stack,  use  the  best

combination.

The sample character has the following:

Foe hunter SR 19 (base 15 + 4 for foe hunter levels);

Armor SR 11;

Drow SR 22 (base 11 + 11 class levels);

Add the armor to the foe hunter;

(SR 30).

Do not add the drow SR because it already takes level into

account,  and  in  any  case,  you  wouldn(cid:146)t  stack  armor  SR  and

drow SR because those two SRs don(cid:146)t stack. Note that in this

case, the SR of 30 applies only against effects that come from

a  hated  enemy.  Magic  from  other  sources  has  to  overcome

the character(cid:146)s drow SR of 22.

When  you  use  the  rage  class  ability,  you  become

fatigued  for  as  long  as  you  raged.  When  you  use  the

frenzied berserker(cid:146)s frenzy class ability (from Masters of

the  Wild),  you  become  fatigued  for  the  rest  of  the

encounter,  or  until  you  enter  a  frenzy  again,  whichever

comes first. In either case, both rage and frenzy make you

fatigued.  Page  84  of  the  DUNGEON  MASTER(cid:146)s  Guide  says

you become exhausted if you are already fatigued and you

become  fatigued  again.  The  penalties  for  exhaustion  are

pretty steep: You move at 1/2 speed and have a (cid:150)6 penalty

to both Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete

rest, you are moved up from exhausted to fatigued. After

8  hours  of  complete  rest,  you are  no  longer  fatigued.  So,

after  a  rage/frenzy  combo,  a  frenzied  berserker  is  darn

near  useless  for  9  hours.  Better  save  that  for  the  last

battle of the day. What, exactly, is the point of being able

to  rage  multiple  times  per  day  if  it  wipes  you  out  for  so

long?

A  barbarian  is  fatigued  only  for  the  rest  of  the  encounter

after  raging  (a  barbarian  can  rage  again  while  fatigued,  but

the fatigue penalties stack with the rage bonuses). A frenzied

berserker  is  fatigued  for  the  rest  of  the  encounter  after  a

frenzy, or until entering a new frenzy. In either case, it does

not  take  8  hours  to  recover  from  the  fatigue  that  a  rage  or

frenzy causes. Both abilities have specific rules that override

the general rule from the DUNGEON MASTER(cid:146)s Guide, which is

written  to  cover  environmental  effects,  running,  and  other

cases of prolonged stress on the body(cid:151)not rage and frenzy.

The  geomancer  prestige  class  has  a  power  called  spell

versatility,  which  allows  you  to  mix  and  match  the

qualities  of  arcane  and  divine  magic  to  get  the  greatest

possible  advantage.  If  I  have  a  character  that  has  an

Intelligence  of  18,  a  Wisdom  of  12,  5  levels  in  wizard,  3

levels  in  cleric,  and  4  levels  in  geomancer  (with  3  levels

adding  to  cleric  and  1  to  wizard),  could  I  substitute  my

Intelligence for my Wisdom when determining whether I

can  cast  a  certain  divine  spell?  The  Wisdom  score  of  12

would  let  me  cast  only  2nd-level  divine  spells,  but

substituting the Intelligence score of 18 would allow me to

cast  up  to  8th-level  divine  spells.  Is  this  possible?  Since

clerics  don(cid:146)t  use  spellbooks,  can  I  prepare  any  wizard

spell  without  a  spellbook?  What  if  I  have  sorcerer  levels

and my Wisdom score is higher than my Charisma? Can

I  use  Wisdom  to  determine  what  sorcerer  spells  I  can

cast?

Spell  versatility  applies  when  casting  spells,  not  when

preparing them or when accessing daily spell slots for classes

that  do  not  prepare  spells.  The  example  character  could

ignore  arcane  spell  failure  chances  for  armor  thanks  to  her

cleric levels, even when casting wizard spells. Likewise, the

example  character  can  use  her  Intelligence  of  18  to  set  the

saving throw DC for any spell she casts -- even a cleric spell.

When  preparing  cleric  spells,  the  example  character  is

limited to 0-level spells, 1st-level spells, and 2nd-level spells,

thanks  to  her  Wisdom  of  12.  The  character  can  fill  her

higher-level  cleric  spell  slots  with  lower-level  spells,  just  as

any spellcaster can.

A  geomancer/wizard  still  needs  her  spellbooks  to  prepare

wizard  spells,  no  matter  what  other  classes  she  has.  A

geomancer/cleric  still  needs  daily  prayer  to  prepare  cleric

spells.

A  geomancer/sorcerer  is  still  limited  by  Charisma  when

determining what spells can go into her sorcerer spell slots. A

geomancer/wizard/sorcerer  with  an  Intelligence  score  of  18

and  a  Charisma  score  of  11  can  cast  only  cantrips  and  1st-

levels spells as a sorcerer. As noted earlier, the character can

fill  her  higher-level  sorcerer  spell  slots  with  lower-level

spells.

When  an  oozemaster  character  uses  his  malleability

power, can the oozemaster bring his equipment with him?

Yes. Malleability is similar to the druid(cid:146)s wildshape power

or  the  polymorph  self  spell  when  it  comes  to  equipment.

Anything the oozemaster holds, carries, or wears is subsumed

into the ooze form (and becomes nonfunctional).

What

is  an  oozemaster(cid:146)s  speed  when  using  the

malleability  power?  How  long  does  it  take  to  squeeze

through  an  inch-wide  crack?  What  actions  can  you  take

when using this power? Are your senses affected?

You  move  at  your  normal  speed  when  using

the

malleability power. Cracks at least 1 inch wide do not block

your movement. You slip through them as easily as a human

walks down a corridor 10 feet wide.

The malleability power does not affect your senses.

When using the malleability power, you cannot speak and

cannot  wield  tools,  weapons,  or  manipulate  small  objects

such  as  spell  components,  nor  can  you  wear  anything.  The

limitations  rule  out  many  actions,  such  as  fighting  with  a

weapon, casting a spell with a verbal or material component,

and  the  like.  The  character  can  use  most  move  actions  and

might  very  well  find  clever  ways  to  take  other  actions.  For

example,  the  correct  feats  might  allow  you  to  cast  some

spells.  Also,  the  character  can  attempt  to  bull  rush  or  trip

foes.

Does  an  oozemaster  provoke  an  attack  of  opportunity

while going into or out of the malleable state?

No.  Malleability

the

malleability  description  on  page  68  of  Masters of  the  Wild).

opportunity (see Table 8(cid:150)1 in the Player(cid:146)s Handbook).

Does  a  shifter  who  is  also  a  druid  get  any  additional

animal companions as she gains shifter levels?

The shifter has no spellcasting ability, thus its spells don(cid:146)t

get  any  better  with  shifter  levels.  A  druid  who  adds  shifter

levels doesn(cid:146)t get any more animal companions.

Does a shifter(cid:146)s character type ever change at any time

before  the  character  reaches  10th  level  in  the  shifter

class? If so, do I gain the abilities that go with the types I

assume?  For  example,  if  I  have  the  power  to  assume

undead forms, does my type change to undead if I change

into  a  ghoul?  If  so,  do  I  then  become  subject  to  undead

turning  or  to  damage  from  healing  spells?  If  I  can  turn

into  plants  and  I  turn  into  a  shambling  mound,  do  I

become  immune  to  critical  hits?  Can  I  assume  the

abilities of a racial subtype?

The  shifter(cid:146)s  greater  wildshape  ability  does  not  change

your  type.  The  shifter  gains  the  natural  and  extraordinary

powers of the assumed form, but not powers that stem from

the form(cid:146)s type. A shifter in an undead form is not an undead

creature and cannot be turned or harmed by healing spells. A

shifter in plant form is still subject to critical hits. The greater

wildshape  power  also  does  not  allow  you  to  gain  abilities

associated with a subtype.

What abilities do you gain through the shifter(cid:146)s greater

wildshape  power?  For  example,  do  you  gain  the  average

ability  scores  of  the  assumed  form,  or  do  you  just  apply

the  racial  modifiers  of  the  new  form  to  your  own

statistics?

Just  as  with  the  wildshape  power  or  the  polymorph  self

spell,  you  keep  your  mental  ability  scores  (Intelligence,

Wisdom,  and  Charisma),  and  you  gain  the  average  physical

Masters of the Wild FAQ

scores  (Strength,  Dexterity,  and  Constitution)  of  the  shape

you assume. Racial adjustments become irrelevant (yours no

longer apply, and the shape(cid:146)s average scores already include

any racial adjustments for the shape).

As  noted  in  the  previous  question,  you  gain  the  assumed

form(cid:146)s  extraordinary  and  natural  abilities.  Extraordinary

abilities  are  noted  as  such  in  the  Monster  Manual  entry  for

the form. Natural abilities are those that are not marked with

another  designator  (typical  natural  abilities

include  a

creature(cid:146)s  various  modes  of  movement,  method  of

respiration, and assorted abilities that are too trivial to appear

in the creature description). You do not gain any spell-like or

supernatural abilities of the assumed form. Also, as noted in

the  previous  answer,  you  do  not  gain  any  abilities  (good  or

bad) from the assumed form(cid:146)s type.

Can you ever mimic a specific person with the shifter(cid:146)s

greater  wildshape  ability,  or  do  you  always  look  like  the

same  creature  when  you  assume  a  specific  form?  For

example,  say  you  assume  the  form  of  an  elf.  Are  you

identifiable as yourself? Do you look like some random elf

(and  do  you  always  look  like  that  elf  when  in  elf  form)?

Or can you control your appearance?

As with the polymorph self spell and the wildshape ability,

minor aspects of your appearance are under your control, and

you  can  even  attempt  to  disguise  yourself  as  a  particular

creature.

Both  the  wildshape  and  greater  wildshape  powers

require you to be familiar with the form you assume. Just

how  familiar  is  (cid:147)familiar(cid:148)  for  the  purposes  of  shifting?

Would  fighting  a  creature  qualify?  Would  just  seeing  it

once work, or does familiarity require active study?

Any  encounter  in  which  you  fight  or  have  a  similar

complex  interaction  with  the  creature  would  qualify,  as

would studying the creature for a day.

A  1st-  or  2nd-level  shifter  has  the  ability  to  turn  only

into humanoid and monstrous humanoid forms. If I took

the  form  of  an  orc,  do  I  gain  an  orc(cid:146)s  standard

equipment, or am I naked?

As with the polymorph self spell, your equipment morphs

to  resemble  a  typical  orc(cid:146)s  equipment;  this  is  true  whenever

you assume an equipment-using form (see the polymorph self

spell  description  for  a  list  of  equipment-using  forms).  Note

that  equipment  altered  this  way  remains  functional.  It  is  not

melded into your new form and rendered nonfunctional.

Shifters  have  the  greater  wildshape  ability,  which  allows

them  to  choose  which  bits  of  their  equipment  morph  along

with  their  forms  and  which  meld  into  their  assumed  forms.

So, you can assume the form of an orc in his birthday suit if

you like. If you do, all your equipment is melded into the orc

form  and  becomes  nonfunctional.  You  also  can  opt  to  have

some  or  all  of your  equipment  resemble  an  orc(cid:146)s  equipment

(in which case it remains functional), or you can have some

or all of your equipment not change with your orc form at all,

which  probably  means  you  wind  up  looking  like  a  very

wealthy orc.

The  description  for  the  shifter(cid:146)s  greater  wildshape

power  says  equipment  separated  from  the  character

reverts to its normal form, but what about body parts? Is

there  a  point  where  poisons  can  be  emulated  (as  per  the

shapechange spell)? If separated body parts don(cid:146)t change,

how long do they stay changed?

When  a  character  uses  wildshape  or  greater  wildshape,

portions of his body that become separated from the character

retain  their  current  forms(cid:151)they  do  not  revert  as  equipment

does.  (Note  that  this  is  not  the  case  with  polymorph  spells,

but  it  is  the  case  with  shapechange.)  This  allows  the

wildshaped  or  shapechanged  character  to  use  extraordinary

abilities such as poison if the assumed form has them.

A separated body part retains its assumed form at least as

long  as  the  character  retains  that  form,  but  it  radiates

Transmutation magic. Dispel magic or an antimagic field can

force  the  part  back  into  its  normal  form.  (Use  the  shifter  or

druid(cid:146)s class level to determine how strong the part(cid:146)s magical

aura is or how difficult the effect is to dispel; use the normal

rules for detecting or dispelling spell effects if a shapechange

spell  was  involved.)  If  the  separated  body  part  has  become

part  of  another  creature  (for  example,  another  creature  has

eaten the part or the part was injected into another creature)

the part melds into the creature(cid:146)s form and the transmutation

effect ends without any additional harm to the creature.

Separated  body  parts  change  along  with  the  character  if

they  remain  within  5  feet  of  the  character.  If  separated  by

more than 5 feet, they retain their forms indefinitely (though

the effect can be ended as noted above). Note that a character

using wild shape or greater wild shape returns to her original

form if killed.

Does a character have to be able to cast a spell to meet

the shifter(cid:146)s alternate form requirement?

You can meet the requirement with any spell from the list

on  page  69  of  Masters  of  the  Wild.  You  also  meet  the

requirement  if  you  have  a  spell-like  ability  or  supernatural

ability that mimics one of the spells on that list.

If  you  have  levels  in  both  druid  and  in  the  tamer  of

beasts  prestige  class,  do  the  animal  companions  you  get

from  being  a  druid  gain  the  special  abilities  from  the

tamer  of  beasts  prestige  class?  Also,  how  many  animal

companions  can  a  druid  10/tamer  of  beasts  5  have?  Can

they be beasts? What if the tamer of beasts has a familiar

or special mount?

The  number  of  animal  or  beast  companions  a  tamer  of

beasts character can have is a function of both the character(cid:146)s

tamer  of  beasts  level  and  the  character(cid:146)s  animal  friendship

caster level. So, the character(cid:146)s druid (or ranger) levels have a

direct  effect  on  how  many  companions  the  character  can

have;  the  maximum  total  Hit  Dice  of  the  character(cid:146)s  animal

companions is twice her tamer of beasts level plus twice her

animal  friendship  caster  level.  Anything  that  increases  the

character(cid:146)s  animal  friendship  caster  level  also  increases  the

total number of Hit Dice worth of companions the character

can have. This can include the spellcasting improvements the

tamer of beasts receives at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. If the class

that  received  the  improvement  also  allows  casting  animal

friendship,  then  use  the  increased  caster  level  to  determine

the number of animals or beasts the character can befriend.

The example character can befriend a maximum of 30 HD

worth of animals and beasts.

damage per patch each round. I assume then that a 5-foot

Constitution  damage  per  round.  I  also  assume  a  10-foot

by  10-foot  creature  would  take  2d6  points  of  temporary

Constitution  damage  per  round.  So,  how would  the  spell

affect a 5-foot by 10-foot creature? Also, does a creature

Face  for  creatures  is  measured  in  5-foot  squares,  and  (cid:147)5

feet  of  face(cid:148)  in  the  spell  description  also  refers  to  5-foot

squares. A creature with a 5-foot by 5-foot face indeed takes

1d6  points  of  temporary  Constitution  damage  per  round.  A

creature  with  a  5-foot  by  10-foot  face  covers  two  5-foot

squares  and  takes  2d6  points  of  Constitution  damage  per

round. A creature with a 10-foot by 10-foot face covers four

5-foot squares and takes 4d6 points of temporary Constitution

damage per round.

A  creature  hit  by  a  slime  wave  spell  takes  temporary

slime is removed.

no  matter  how  the  tamer  of  beasts  got  the  companion.  Note

that  a  tamer  of  beasts  cannot  have  an  animal  or  beast

companion with more Hit Dice than the tamer of beasts has.

The  example  character  could  not  have  a  single  companion

with  more  than  15  Hit  Dice.  If  a  character  already  has  a

companion with 16 or more Hit Dice when entering the tamer

of beasts class, the creature must be dismissed. Familiars and

special  mounts  are  not  (cid:147)companions(cid:148)  and  do  not  count

toward  the  character(cid:146)s  total  Hit  Dice  limit  for  animal

companions  or  the  Hit  Dice limit  for  any  single companion.

They do not receive any companion benefits from the tamer

of beasts class.

for  companions,  so  don(cid:146)t  all

The  class  skill  list  for  the  tamer  of  beasts  includes

Handle  Animal  and  Animal  Empathy,  both  of which  are

much  more  difficult  to  use  on  magical  beasts  than  on

animals. When a tamer of beasts(cid:146)s animal companions get

smarter  and  become  magical  beasts  (also  a  tamer  of

beasts(cid:146)s class feature), these two skills become harder for

the  character  to  use.  Furthermore,  the  tamer(cid:146)s  empathic

link power becomes impossible to use on the companions,

since  it  works  like  the  speak  with  animals  spell  and  thus

does  not  work  on  the  companions  anymore.  On  top  of

that,  magical  beasts  befriended  via  the  9th-level  magical

beast power count as double their Hit Dice for the tamer(cid:146)s

the  smarter

quota

companions  count  double?  Why  do  the  more  intelligent

animal companions become magical beasts?

This happens for the same reason that an awakened animal

becomes a magical beast. Animals have Intelligence scores of

1  or  2,  ergo,  no  creature  with  an  Intelligence  score  of  3  or

higher can be an animal.

While  it  is  true  that  a  tamer  of  beasts(cid:146)s  smarter  animal

companions  become  more  difficult  to  influence  through

Handle Animal and Animal Empathy, the tamer of beasts will

no longer need these skills to interact with those companions.

Thanks  to  the  companions(cid:146)  increased  Intelligence  scores,

they  understand  and  respond  to  the  character  as  readily  as

most  characters  do.  In  fact,  because  they  have  Intelligence

scores  above  3,  they  actually  understand  at  least  one

language,  usually  Common  (see  page  10  in  the  Monster

Manual).

The  tamer  of  beasts(cid:146)s  empathic  link  power  works  for  any

of the character(cid:146)s companions(cid:151)even when those companions

are no longer animals. The power(cid:146)s parameters are otherwise

like  a  speak  with  animals  spell  cast  by  a  character  of  the

tamer of beasts(cid:146)s class level.

Only  magical  beasts  tamed  through  the  9th-level  magical

beast mastery power counts double Hit Dice against the tamer

of  beasts(cid:146)s  limit  on  companions;  a  creature  that  becomes  a

magical  beast  as  the  result  of  becoming  a  companion  to  a

tamer of beasts does not count double.

Each round the spell lasts, roll 1d6(cid:150)1 for every 2 levels the

caster  has.  For  example,  if  the  caster  is  10th  level,  roll  5d6

and subtract 1 from each die. Total the result and apply that
