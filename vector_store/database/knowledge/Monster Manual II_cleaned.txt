INTRODUCTION

This book contains entries for more than 250 creatures,

both hostile and benign, for use in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS

adventures. These creatures offer a wide range of challenges

for player characters.

This introduction explains how to read a creatures

write-up. All the information necessary to run the creature

is presented in an easy-to-read format.

Entries for creatures are presented alphabetically by

name. Some creatures, such as demons, are pre-

sented in groups, with the individual vari-

eties ordered from weakest to strongest

within the entry.

The appendix describes a number of

different creatures that are created by

adding a template to an existing crea-

ture. An example of this is the tauric

creature, which adds the tauric tem-

plate to a range of eligible creatures.

At the end of the book is a

list of the monsters organ-

ized by Challenge Rating. This

makes  it  easy  for  the  Dungeon

Master to tailor encounters to the party

level of the player characters (see Challenge

Rating, later in the introduction).

Each monster entry is organized in the

same general format, as described below. The

information is presented in a condensed

form. For complete information on the

characteristics of monsters, consult

the Players Handbook or the Dungeon Masters Guide.

MAIN STATISTICS BLOCK

This text contains basic game information on the creature,

organized as follows.

NAME

This is the name by which the creature is generally known.

The descriptive text (following the main statistics block and

the secondary statistics block) may give other names.

Creature Sizes

SIZE AND TYPE

This line begins with the creatures size (Huge, for exam-

ple). The eight size categories are briefly described in the

Creature Sizes table below.

Size modifiers apply to the creatures Armor Class (AC) and

attack bonus, its Hide checks, and its grapple checks. A crea-

tures size also determines how far it can reach to make a

melee attack and how much space it occupies in a fight

(see Face/Reach, below, and also Big and Little Crea-

tures in Combat, in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook).

The size and type line continues with the crea-

tures type (giant, for example). Type deter-

mines how magic affects a creature. For

example, the hold animal spell affects

only creatures of the animal type.

Type also determines many of the

creatures characteristics and abilities,

as described in the next section.

Type Characteristics

The Typical Creature Statistics by

Type table, beginning on the

following page, provides a variety

of statistics that vary according to crea-

ture type and size. The first three columns give

suggested ranges of values for physical ability

scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The

next two columns give the minimum and maximum num-

ber of Hit Dice the creature may have. A  in the maximum

column means that there is no upper limit to the Hit Dice a

creature may have at a given size. The final four columns give

the suggested base damage for four common natural attack

forms (slam, bite, claw, and gore). This information provides a

useful guideline for creating your own monsters.

A creatures type also determines its Hit Die size, base

attack bonus, good saving throws, number of skill points,

and number of feats, as well as certain other characteristics.

These characteristics are detailed in the type descriptions

that follow the table.

feats often use the term extra Hit Dice (abbreviated

EHD). To determine a monsters EHD, subtract the mini-

mum Hit Dice value for that monsters size and type (as

given on the Typical Creature Statistics by Type table) from

its actual Hit Dice, as given in its entry.

If a formula specifies Int bonus, use the creatures Intel-

ligence modifier only if it is a positive number; otherwise

use +0. If a formula specifies Int modifier, use the creatures

Intelligence modifier, whether it is bonus or a penalty.

Each monster is proficient with any weapons, armor, or

shield mentioned in its entry, as well as with all armor that

is lighter than what it wears. Creatures not specified as

wearing armor or carrying shields are not proficient with

those items, but some creatures have additional weapon

proficiencies by virtue of their type, as given below.

Aberration: An aberration has a bizarre anatomy,

strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of

the three.

Skill Points: (2  Int score) + (2  EHD).

Feats: Int bonus + 1 per 4 EHD.

Example: Catoblepas.

Notes: Unless otherwise noted, an aberration has dark-

immediately destroyed. Since it was never alive, a construct

cannot be raised or resurrected.

A construct cannot heal damage, though it can be healed

through repair in the same way an object can. The fast heal-

ing special quality works for those constructs that have it,

despite their lack of Constitution.

Dragon: A dragon is a reptilian creature, usually winged,

vision with a range of 60 feet.

A construct is immune to mind-affecting effects (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects),

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to criti-

cal hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or

energy drain. A construct is not at risk of death from massive

damage (see Injury and Death in Chapter 8 of the Players

Handbook), but when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it is

Hit Die: d12.

and stunning. Since it has no clear front or back, it is not

subject to critical hits or flanking. Unless otherwise noted,

an elemental has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. A slain

elemental cannot be raised or resurrected, although a wish

or miracle spell can restore it to life.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:39 PM  Page 9

Humanoids are usually Small or Medium-size, with few or

no supernatural or extraordinary abilities. A humanoid is

proficient with all simple weapons.

Hit Die: d8.

Base Attack Bonus: As cleric (3/4 HD, rounded down).

Good Saving Throw: Usually Reflex, but varies by specific

creature.

Skill Points: 6 + Int modifier + EHD.

Feats: 1 + 1 per 4 EHD.

Example Goblin (see Monster Manual).

Notes: Every humanoid has a type modifier (see the next

section), often the name of a race or racial type. For

instance,  goblins  and  bugbears  are  both  of  the  type

humanoid (goblinoid).

Magical Beast: A creature of this type is similar to a beast

but can have an Intelligence score higher than 2. Magical

beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary abilities.

Hit Die: d10.

Base Attack Bonus: As fighter (equal to HD).

Good Saving Throws: Fortitude and Reflex.

Skill Points: (2  Int score) + EHD.

Feats: 1 + Int bonus + 1 per 4 EHD.

Example: Corollax.

simple weapons. Unless otherwise noted, it has darkvision

with a range of 60 feet.

Ooze: An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature.

Hit Die: d10.

Base Attack Bonus: As cleric (3/4 HD, rounded down).

Good Saving Throws: None.

Skill Points: None.

Feats: None.

Example: Flesh jelly.

Notes: An ooze is immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, and polymorphing. Since it has no clear front or back,

it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. An ooze has no

Intelligence score and is therefore immune to all mind-

affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, pat-

terns, and morale effects).

Oozes are blind but have the blindsight special quality. A

creature of this type has no natural armor bonus, but it is

nevertheless difficult to kill because its body is composed

primarily of simple protoplasm. This phenomenon is

reflected by bonus hit points (in addition to those from Hit

Dice and Constitution score) that an ooze receives, accord-

ing to the creatures size, as shown on the table below.

Outsider: An outsider is a nonelemental creature that

comes from another dimension, reality, or plane, has an

ancestor from such a place, or undergoes a change that

makes it similar to  such creatures.

Hit Die: d8.

Base Attack Bonus: As fighter (equal to HD).

Good Saving Throws: Fortitude, Reflex, Will.

Skill Points: (8 + Int modifier)  HD.

Feats: 1 + 1 per 4 HD.

Example: Abyssal ravager.

Notes: An outsider is proficient with all simple weapons.

If its Intelligence score is 6 or higher, it is also proficient

with all martial weapons. A slain outsider cannot be raised

or resurrected, although a wish or miracle spell can restore it

to life. Unless otherwise noted, outsiders have darkvision

with a range of 60 feet.

Plant: This type encompasses all vegetable creatures,

including both normal plants and plant creatures.

Hit Die: d8.

Base Attack Bonus: As cleric (3/4 HD, rounded down).

Good Saving Throw: Fortitude.

Skill Points: None.

Feats: None.

Example: Greenvise.

Notes: A plant is immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, and polymorphing and is not subject to critical hits

or mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phan-

tasms, patterns, and morale effects). Unless otherwise

noted, a creature of this type has low-light vision.

Shapechanger: This type of creature has a stable body

but can assume other forms.

Hit Die: d8.

Base Attack Bonus: As cleric (3/4 HD, rounded down).

Good Saving Throws: Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.

Skill Points: (2  Int score) + EHD.

Good Saving Throw: Will.

Skill Points: (3  Int score) + (2  EHD).

Feats: 1 + Int bonus + 1 per 4 EHD.

Example: Banshee.

Notes:  An  undead  has  no  Constitution  score.  It  is

immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless

it also works on objects. The creature is not subject to crit-

ical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or

energy drain.

An  undead  with  no  Intelligence  score  cannot  heal

damage, though it can be healed. (An intelligent undead

heals damage normally, despite its lack of Constitution.)

Negative energy (such as an inflict spell) heals any undead

creature. The fast healing special quality works for those

undead that have it regardless of their lack of Constitution.

An undead is not at risk of death from massive damage

(see Injury and Death in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook),

but when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it is destroyed. It

cannot be raised, and although resurrection can affect it, such

attempts almost always fail because most undead are

unwilling to be brought back to life (see Bringing Back the

Dead in Chapter 10 of the Players Handbook).

An undead spellcaster uses its Constitution modifier (+0)

or  its  Charisma  modifier,  whichever  is  higher,  when

making Concentration checks. Unless otherwise noted, an

undead has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

Vermin: This type includes insects, arachnids, arthro-

pods, worms, and similar invertebrates.

Hit Die: d8.

Base Attack Bonus: As cleric (3/4 HD, rounded down).

Good Saving Throw: Fortitude.

Skill Points: 10 to 15.

Feats: None.

Example: Leechwalker.

Notes: A vermin has no Intelligence score and is therefore

immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compul-

sions, phantasms, patterns and morale effects). Unless oth-

erwise noted, it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. A

poisonous vermin of at least Medium-size gets a bonus to

the save DC for its poison based on its size, as shown on the

accompanying table.

Type Modifiers

Type modifiers appear as parenthetical notes following

the creature type. This notation indicates that the creature

is associated with an environment (aquatic, for example),

10

a subtype of creature (goblinoid), a form of energy (fire), a

state of being (incorporeal), or the like.

A type modifier can identify a subtype within a larger

type, such as undead (incorporeal), or link creatures that

share characteristics, such as humanoid (goblinoid), or con-

nect members of different types that share an attribute. For

example, frost salamanders and immoths belong to the

magical beast and elemental types, respectively, but both

are also of the cold subtype.

Some common type modifiers that affect a creatures abil-

ities are described below.

Cold: A cold creature is immune to cold damage. It takes

double damage from fire unless a saving throw for half

damage is allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a

success or double damage on a failure.

Fire: A fire creature is immune to fire damage. It takes

double damage from cold unless a saving throw for half

damage is allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a

success or double damage on a failure.

Incorporeal: An incorporeal creature has no physical

body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1

or better magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and super-

natural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms.

Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50%

chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except

force effects, such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost

touch weapons). An incorporeal creature has no natural

armor bonus, but it does have a deflection bonus equal to its

Charisma modifier (minimum +1, even if the creatures

Charisma score would not normally provide a bonus).

An incorporeal creature can pass through solid objects, but

not force effects, at will. Its attacks pass through (ignore) natu-

ral armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses

and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against

them. An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be

heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be. It has no

Strength score, so it uses either its Strength modifier (+0) or its

Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher, for its melee attacks.

HIT DICE

This line gives the number and size of Hit Dice the creature

has, plus any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note pro-

vides the average hit points for a typical specimen. A crea-

tures Hit Dice total is also its level for the purpose of deter-

mining how spells affect it, its rate of natural healing, and

its maximum ranks in a skill.

INITIATIVE

This line gives the creatures modifier to initiative rolls. This

value is the sum of the creatures Dexterity modifier and +4

for the Improved Initiative feat, if applicable.

SPEED

Unless stated otherwise, the first entry on this line gives the

creatures tactical speed on land (the amount of distance it can

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:39 PM  Page 11

cover in one move action). If the creature has other modes

of movement, these are given after the main entry. Unless

otherwise noted, modes of movement are natural, not magical.

The other possible modes of movement are detailed below.

Burrow: The creature can tunnel through dirt, but not

through rock unless the descriptive text says otherwise. A

creature cannot run while burrowing.

Climb: A creature with a climb speed has Climb as a class

skill and gains a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks (included

in the creatures Climb modifier). The creature must make a

Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher

than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 (see Checks with-

out Rolls in Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook), even if

rushed or threatened. The creature moves at the given

speed while climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb

(see Climb in Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook), it moves at

double the given climb speed (or its normal land speed,

whichever is lower) and makes a single Climb check at a 5

penalty. A creature cannot run while climbing. It retains its

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing,

and an opponent gets no special bonus on his or her attacks

against it while it climbs.

Fly: The creature can fly at the given speed if carrying

no more than a light load (see Carrying Capacity, in Chap-

ter 9 of the Players Handbook, and Strength, below). All fly

speeds include a parenthetical note indicating maneuver-

ability, as follows.

Perfect:  The  creature  can  perform  almost  any  aerial

maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a

human does over smooth ground.

Good: The creature is very agile in the air and can fly as

well as a housefly or hummingbird, but it cannot change

direction as readily as those with perfect maneuverability.

Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird.

Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.

Clumsy: The creature can barely fly at all.

Creatures that fly can make dive attacks. This type of

attack works just like a charge, but the diving creature must

move a minimum of 30 feet. It can make only claw attacks,

but these deal double damage. A creature can use the run

action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.

For more information, see Tactical Aerial Movement in

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

Swim: A creature with a swim speed can move through

water at the given speed without making Swim checks. It gains

a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check (included in its Swim

modifier) to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

The creature always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or

threatened when swimming. A creature can use the run

action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

ARMOR CLASS

The Armor Class line gives the creatures AC for normal

combat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modi-

fiers contributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural

armor). The creatures AC against touch attacks and its AC

when flat-footed are also provided.

The amount of a creatures natural armor bonus corre-

sponds to the material that covers its body. The skin of a crea-

ture such as a human, dwarf, or elf provides no natural armor

bonus. A creature with thick skin or fur has a natural armor

bonus ranging from +1 (the grimalkin, for instance) to +3

(the blood ape). A creature with an exceptionally tough hide

has a natural armor bonus of +4 (the loxo) or higher. Some

creatures, such as the hook horror, have a high natural armor

bonus (+10 in this case) because of a strong, rigid exoskele-

ton. With other creatures, such as the vaporighu, a high nat-

ural armor bonus (+11, in this case) indicates a malleable,

amorphous body that is difficult to strike effectively.

The scales of a dragon provide it with a natural armor

bonus that usually starts out at +5 or +6 for a wyrmling and

can be as high as +38 or +39 for a great wyrm. See the

dragon entries in this book for more details.

Attacks

This line gives all the creatures physical attacks, whether

with natural or manufactured weapons. If the creature is

capable of multiple attacks (either more than one attack

with a certain attack form, or more than one attack using

different attack forms), all its attack bonuses are given here.

The given attack bonuses include all applicable modifiers.

Attack Routine: Many creatures can attack in more than

one way or with different combinations of weapons. In

such a case, the creatures Attacks entry gives an attack rou-

tine for each mode of attack. Multiple attack routines in an

Attacks entry are separated by commas.

For example, the entry for the chaos roc reads 2 claws

+41 melee and bite +36 melee, or 2 wings +41 melee. The

claw attacks and the bite are one attack routine, and the two

wing attacks are another attack routine. A creature with

multiple attack routines cannot use more than one of those

routines in a given round.

An attack routine can include an attack with a manufac-

tured weapon as well as a natural weapon attack.

Natural Weapons: These include teeth, claws, tentacles,

and the like. The entry gives the number of attacks along

with the type of weapon (2 claws, for example), attack

bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The first list-

ing is for the creatures primary weapon, and it includes an

attack bonus that incorporates applicable modifiers for size,

Strength, Dexterity, the Weapon Focus feat, and anything

else that affects this value.

The remaining weapons mentioned (if any) are secondary.

Each of these attacks has a 5 penalty on the attack roll, no

matter how many secondary attacks there are. Creatures with

the Multiattack feat (see the Creature Feats sidebar, later in

the introduction) take only a 2 penalty on secondary attacks.

All of the foregoing assumes that the creature makes a

full attack (see Attack Actions in Chapter 8 of the Players

Handbook) and employs all its natural weapons. If a creature

instead chooses the attack option (and thus makes only a

single attack), it uses its primary attack bonus.

Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a

critical hit on a natural attack roll of 20.

Manufactured Weapons: Creatures that use swords, bows,

spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters do.

Sometimes a creature may follow up a manufactured

weapon attack with one or more of its natural weapon attacks.

All natural attacks used in combination with a weapon attack

are secondary attacks, regardless of whether they were pri-

mary or secondary in the creatures natural attack sequence.

DAMAGE

This line provides the damage each of the creatures

attacks deals.

Natural Weapons: A creatures primary attack damage

includes its full Strength modifier (1 1/2  its Strength

bonus if it is the creatures sole attack, or 1  its Strength

bonus if it has multiple natural weapons or multiple attacks

with the same natural weapon). Secondary attacks add only

1/2  the creatures Strength bonus. If any attacks also cause

some special effect other than normal hit point damage

(poison, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or the like), that

information is given here. Unless otherwise noted, a creature

deals double damage with a natural weapon on a critical hit.

Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do (see

Weapon Qualities in Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook).

The most common of these are summarized below.

Bite: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing pierc-

ing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.

Claw or Rake: The creature rips with a sharp appendage,

dealing piercing and slashing damage.

Gore: The creature spears the opponent with an antler,

horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.

Slam or Tail Slap: The creature batters opponents with an

appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.

Sting: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing

damage. Stingers are usually poisoned.

Manufactured Weapons: Creatures that use swords,

bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters

do. Regardless of how many hands (or other appendages

capable of wielding a weapon) a creature may have, only one

of them is primary. The rest count as off hands. The damage

bonus for a melee weapon attack depends on the hand or

hands that wield the weapons, as shown on the table below.

Apply the given multiplier to the creatures Strength bonus (if

it has one) and add the result to the damage rolled.

wielded with more than two hands; in such a case, the addi-

tional damage bonus would apply for each off hand used.)

A Strength penalty applies to the damage of any weapon

at 1  its value, regardless of which hand or how many

hands are used to wield it. This penalty does not accumulate

when an additional hand is used to grasp a weapon.

If a monster has the superior two-weapon fighting or supe-

rior multiweapon fighting special quality, all of its hands are

considered primary for the purpose of damage bonuses.

FACE/REACH

This line describes how much space the creature needs to

fight effectively and how close it has to be to threaten an

opponent. This information is written in the format x ft. by

y ft./z ft. The numbers before the slash show the creatures

fighting space (width first, length second). The number

after the slash is the monsters natural reach.

If the creature has exceptional reach because of a weapon,

tentacle, or the like, the extended reach and its source are

noted in parentheses. A natural weapon that provides

exceptional reach (such as the cloud rays tail or the moon-

calf s tentacle rake) may be used against foes that are adja-

cent to the creature.

A creatures Face/Reach entry depends on its size and

gatherer fills a 20-foot-square area, while a Gargantuan fiendwurm

fills a space 40 feet long and 10 feet wide. (If the fiendwurm coiled

itself into a circle, it would take up a 20-foot-by-20-foot space.)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Many creatures have unusual abilities, which can include spe-

cial attack forms, resistance or vulnerability to certain types of

damage, and enhanced senses, among others. A monster

entry breaks these abilities into Special Attacks and Special

Qualities. The latter category includes defenses, vulnerabili-

ties, and other special abilities that are not modes of attack.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:40 PM  Page 13

A special ability can be designated as extraordinary, spell-

like, or supernatural, or it may have no designator (in which

case the ability is considered natural). The designators are

defined below.

Extraordinary (Ex): Extraordinary abilities are non-

magical, dont go away in an antimagic field, and are not

subject to any effect that disrupts magic. Using an extraor-

dinary ability is a free action unless otherwise noted.

Spell-Like (Sp): Spell-like abilities are magical and work

just like spells, though they are not spells and thus have no

verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components. These

effects go away in an antimagic field and are subject to spell

resistance. There is usually a limit on the number of times a

spell-like ability can be used, but one that is designated as

always active or at will has no usage limit.

A creature with spell-like abilities has an effective caster

level, which sets the difficulty of dispelling that creatures

spell-like abilities and defines any level-dependent vari-

ables (such as range and duration) that might apply. The

creatures effective caster level never affects which spell-

like abilities it can have; sometimes the given caster level is

lower than the level a spellcasting character would have to

be in order to cast the spell of the same name. Likewise, its

not necessary for a creature to have levels in a particular

spellcasting class in order to use a spell-like ability that

resembles one of that classs spells. The saving throw (if any)

to resist or negate the effect of a spell-like ability has a DC

of 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or dupli-

cates (the lowest possible level, where this differs by class) +

the creatures Charisma modifier.

Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless other-

wise noted, and doing so while threatened provokes an

attack of opportunity. A spell-like ability can be disrupted

just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to

counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled, but they can

be used defensively just as spells can (see the Concentra-

tion skill description in Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook).

Supernatural: Supernatural abilities are magical and go

away in an antimagic field but are not subject to spell resist-

ance. Using a supernatural ability is a standard action

unless otherwise noted. Such an ability may have a use

limit or be usable at will, just like a spell-like ability. How-

ever, supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of oppor-

tunity and never require Concentration checks.

SPECIAL ATTACKS

This line identifies the creatures special attacks. (If it has

none, this line is absent.) Details of the most common types

of special attacks are given below. Where specific values are

given for save DCs against special attacks, they are for a

creature with the HD and ability scores given in the main

statistics block. Additional information can be found in the

creatures descriptive text.

Ability Score Loss (Su): Some attacks reduce the

opponents score in one or more abilities. This loss can be

permanent or temporary (see Ability Score Loss in Chapter

3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide).

Ability Drain: This effect permanently reduces a living

opponents ability score when the creature hits with a melee

attack. The creatures descriptive text gives the affected abil-

ity and the number of ability score points drained. If an

attack that causes ability drain scores a critical hit, it drains

twice the given amount. (If the damage is expressed as a die

range, roll double the usual number of dice.) A draining

creature heals 5 points of damage it has taken (10 on a criti-

cal hit) whenever it drains an ability score, no matter how

many points it drains. If the amount of healing is more than

the damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as

temporary hit points, which last a maximum of 1 hour.

Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save with a

DC of 10 + 1/2 draining creatures HD + draining creatures

Charisma modifier. If no saving throw is mentioned, none

is allowed.

Ability Damage: This attack temporarily reduces an

opponents ability score. The creatures descriptive text

gives the ability and the amount of damage. If an attack that

causes ability damage scores a critical hit, it deals twice the

given amount. (If the damage is expressed as a die range,

roll double the usual number of dice.) Temporary ability

damage heals naturally at the rate of 1 point per day for each

affected ability.

Breath Weapon (Su): A breath weapon attack usually

deals damage and is often based on some type of energy

(such as fire). It allows a Reflex save for half damage with a

DC of 10 + 1/2 breathing creatures HD + breathing crea-

tures Constitution modifier. A creature is immune to its

own breath weapon and to the breath weapons of others of

its kind unless otherwise noted.

Constrict (Ex): This special attack crushes an opponent,

dealing bludgeoning damage, after the creature makes a

successful grapple check (see Grapple in Chapter 8 of the

Players Handbook). The amount of damage is given in the

creatures entry. If the creature also has the improved grab

ability (see below), it deals constrict damage in addition to

the damage dealt by the weapon it used to grab.

Energy Drain (Su): This attack saps a living opponents

vital energy and happens automatically when the creatures

melee or ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain

bestows one or more negative levels (the descriptive text

specifies how many). See Energy Drain in Chapter 3 of the

DUNGEON MASTERS Guide  for  details.  If  an  attack  that

includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice

the given amount. For each negative level bestowed on an

opponent, the draining creature heals 5 points of damage it

has taken. If the amount of healing is more than the damage

the creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit

points, which last a maximum of 1 hour.

The affected opponent takes a 1 penalty on all skill and

ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses 1

effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die

roll or a calculation) for each negative level. A spellcaster

loses one spell slot of the highest level he or she can cast

and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss

persists until the negative level is removed.

If they are not removed with a spell, such as restoration,

negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed. At that

time, the afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save

with a DC of 10 + 1/2 draining creatures HD + draining

creatures Charisma modifier. On a success, the negative

level goes away with no harm to the opponent. On a failure,

the negative level goes away, but the opponents level (or

HD) is also reduced by one. A separate saving throw is

required for each negative level.

Fear (Su or Sp): There are several types of attacks that

magically induce fear in an opponent.

Fear Aura (Su): This ability either operates continuously

or can be used at will. In either case, using it is a free action.

A fear aura can immobilize an opponent (for example, the

moonbeasts aura) or function similarly to the fear spell (for

example, the aura of a malebranche). Other specific effects

are also possible.

If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save with

a DC of 10 + 1/2 fearsome creatures HD + fearsome crea-

tures Charisma modifier.

Frightful Presence (Ex): This ability makes a creatures

very presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect automati-

cally when the creature performs some sort of dramatic

action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents

within range that witness the action may become panicked,

frightened, or shaken (see Condition Summary in Chapter

3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide).

Actions required to trigger the ability are given in the

creatures descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, but

the entry gives any exceptions. The duration is usually

5d6 rounds.

This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice

and/or levels than the creature has. An affected opponent

can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 frightful creatures HD + frightful creatures Charisma

modifier). An opponent that succeeds at the saving throw is

immune to that creatures frightful presence for 24 hours.

Gaze (Su): A gaze attack takes effect when opponents

look at the creatures eyes (see Gaze Attacks in Chapter 3 of

the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide). The attack can have almost

any sort of effect: petrification, death, energy drain, charm,

fear, and so on. The typical range is 30 feet. Most gaze

attacks operate continuously as long as the creature is con-

scious and has its eyes open.

The type of saving throw against a gaze attack varies, but

it is usually a Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing

creatures HD + gazing creatures Charisma modifier). A

successful saving throw negates the effect.

Every opponent within range of a gaze attack must

attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of its

turn in the initiative order. An opponent is vulnerable only

if looking directly at the creature. An opponent can avoid

having to make the saving throw by not looking at the crea-

ture, which can be done by averting ones eyes or by using a

barrier to sight.

Averting Ones Eyes: The opponent avoids looking at the

creatures face and instead looks at its body, watches its

shadow, tracks it in a reflective surface, or the like. Each

round, the opponent has a 50% chance to avoid needing to

make a saving throw against the gaze attack. The creature

with the gaze attack, however, gains one-half concealment

against that opponent.

Barrier to Sight: An opponent that cannot see the creature

at all cannot be affected by its gaze attack. This can be

accomplished by turning ones back on the creature, shut-

ting ones eyes, or wearing a blindfold or head covering that

prevents sight. The creature with the gaze attack gains total

concealment against the opponent.

A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack

action by choosing a target within range. That opponent

must attempt a saving throw unless successful at avoiding

the gaze as described above. Thus, it is possible for an oppo-

nent to have to save against a creatures gaze attack twice

during the same round, once before the opponents action

and once during the creatures turn.

Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. Unless other-

wise noted, a creature is immune to its own gaze attack and

to those of others of its own kind.

Improved Grab (Ex): If the creature hits with a melee

weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (see Grapple in Chapter 8 of

the Players Handbook). No initial touch attack is required, and

a Tiny or Small creature does not have a special size penalty;

instead it uses its regular size modifier for attacks. Unless

otherwise noted, improved grab works only against oppo-

nents at least one size category smaller than the creature.

The creature can conduct the grapple normally, or it can

simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab

attack to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it

takes a 20 penalty on grapple checks until its next turn (at

which point it can choose to continue taking the 20

penalty, or decide not to continue taking it), but it is also not

considered grappled during that time. The creature does not

lose its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, it still threatens an

area, and it can use its remaining attacks normally.

Unlike a regular grapple, a successful hold does not deal

any additional damage beyond that dealt by the weapon in

the initial round, unless otherwise noted (for example, the

constrict ability deals its damage the same round). If the

creature does have an ability that allows extra damage, each

successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds

deals the damage given for the attack that established the

hold. Otherwise, it deals damage from all applicable special

attacks  as  well  (the  amount  is  given  in  the  creatures

descriptive text).

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:40 PM  Page 15

Whenever a creature gets a hold after an improved grab

attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. If it chooses to take a

20 penalty on its grapple check, it can move (possibly

carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the

latters weight.

Poison (Ex): A poison attack deals its initial damage, usu-

ally in the form of ability damage, to the opponent on a

failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another

saving throw is required 1 minute later (regardless of the

first saves result) to avoid the poisons secondary damage.

The creatures descriptive text provides the details.

The Fortitude save against poison has a DC of 10 + 1/2

poisoning creatures HD + poisoning creatures Constitu-

tion modifier. A successful save avoids the damage.

Psionics (Sp): Psionic abilities are generated with the

power of a creatures mind. As a general rule, psionics are

treated as spell-like abilities; the use of one is a standard

action, and it can be used a certain number of times per day

(or at will), as specified in the creatures descriptive text.

If your campaign uses the Psionics Handbook, substitute the

psionic power of the same name for each of these abilities.

With the Psionics Handbook its also possible for the psionic

creatures in this book (the braxat, the gem dragons, and the

thri-kreen) to be fully fleshed out with psionic attack and

defense  modes  and  class  equivalents  for  manifesting

powers, which are provided for each psionic creature in the

Attack/Defense Modes paragraph of the psionics entry. Par-

enthetical  notes  elsewhere  in  each  psionic  creatures

descriptive text indicate other adjustments that need to be

made when the Psionics Handbook is used.

Ray (Su or Sp): A ray behaves like a ranged attack (see

Aiming a Spell in Chapter 10 of the Players Handbook). It

requires a ranged touch attack roll, ignoring armor and

shield (the opponents touch AC applies) and using the

creatures ranged attack bonus. Ray attacks are always made

as if at short range (no range increment penalty applies).

The creatures descriptive text specifies the maximum

range, effects, and any applicable saving throw.

Spells: Some creatures can cast arcane or divine spells

just as members of a spellcasting class can (and can activate

magic items accordingly). These creatures are subject to the

same spellcasting rules as characters are. Spells per day and

spells known are given for a creature with the ability scores

noted in the main statistics block.

A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class

unless its entries says so, and it does not gain any class abil-

ities or features. For example, a creature that casts arcane

spells as a sorcerer cannot acquire a familiar. Unless other-

wise noted, a creature with access to cleric spells that does

not actually have levels as a cleric must prepare the spells in

the normal manner and receives no extra slots for domain

spells, though it may be able to choose spells from particu-

lar domains. In any case, such a creature does not have

access to a domains granted powers.

Swallow Whole (Ex): If the creature begins its turn with

an opponent held in its mouth (see Improved Grab, above),

it can attempt a new grapple check, as though attempting to

pin the opponent. If it succeeds, it swallows its prey and the

opponent takes bite damage.

Being swallowed has various additional consequences,

depending on the creature doing the swallowing, but a

swallowed creature is considered grappled, while the crea-

ture that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature

can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing

weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free

is noted in the creature description), or it can just try to

escape the grapple. If the swallowed creature chooses the

latter course, success puts it back in the attackers mouth,

where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

The creatures descriptive text specifies what size oppo-

nents it can swallow. The creatures stomach or gullet can

hold either one or two opponents of the largest size cate-

gory it can swallow, or a certain number of creatures of

smaller size, as specified in the creatures descriptive text.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, the creature can trample opponents at least one

size category smaller than itself, unless otherwise noted.

The creature merely has to move over the opponents. The

trample deals bludgeoning damage (the descriptive text

gives the amount).

A trampled opponent may attempt an attack of oppor-

tunity with a 4 penalty on the attack roll. An opponent

that chooses not to make an attack of opportunity may

instead attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The save

DC is 10 + 1/2 trampling creatures HD + trampling crea-

tures Strength modifier.

SPECIAL QUALITIES

This line identifies the creatures special qualities. (If it has

no special qualities, this line is absent.) Details of the most

common special qualities are given below. Additional infor-

mation can be found in the creatures descriptive text.

Blindsight (Ex): Using nonvisual senses, such as sensi-

tivity to vibrations, scent, acute hearing, or echolocation,

the creature maneuvers and fights normally without vision.

Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though the creature

still cant discern ethereal beings. The abilitys range is spec-

ified in the creatures descriptive text. The creature usually

does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice crea-

tures within range of its blindsight ability.

Damage Reduction (Su): Most weapons (natural or man-

ufactured) that hit the creature deal less damage than they

ordinarily do. (The creatures wounds heal immediately, or the

hit turns into a glancing blow; in either case, the opponent

knows the attack was ineffective.) The creature takes normal

damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells,

spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A magic weapon

or a creature with its own damage reduction (DR) can some-

times damage the creature normally, as noted below.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:40 PM  Page 16

The creatures entry indicates the amount of damage

ignored (usually 5 to 25 points) and the type of weapon that

overcomes the ability. For example, the boggles entry reads

DR 5/+1. Each time a foe hits a boggle with a weapon, the

damage dealt by that attack is reduced by 5 points (to a min-

imum of 0). However, a +1 weapon deals full damage.

Any weapon more powerful than the type given in the

creatures DR statistic also overcomes the ability. (See

Table 313: Damage Reduction Rankings in the DUNGEON

MASTERS Guide.) For example, a boggle (DR 5/+1) takes

normal damage from weapons with +2 or better bonuses

from magic, but not from nonmagical weapons. Non-

magical enhancement bonuses (such as those of master-

work or adamantine weapons) do not enable a weapon to

overcome damage reduction.

For purposes of harming other creatures with damage

reduction, a creatures natural weapons count as the type

that overcomes its own innate damage reduction. However,

damage reduction from spells, such as stoneskin, does not

confer this ability. The amount of damage reduction is irrel-

evant. For example, a bronze serpent (DR 10/+1) deals full

damage to a boggle, as if the bronze serpents bite attack

were made with a +1 weapon.

Darkvision (Ex): This ability enables a creature to see in

lightless conditions, out to a range specified in the crea-

tures descriptive text. Darkvision is black and white only

(no colors can be detected), and it does not allow a creature

to see something it could not see in lighted conditions,

such as an invisible creature. A creature with darkvision is

vulnerable to gaze attacks, just as a creature without dark-

vision would be in lighted conditions.

Fast Healing (Ex): The creature regains hit points at an

exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more hit points per

round, as given in the entry. (For example, an ethereal dop-

pelganger has fast healing 8.) Fast healing is like natural

healing (see Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook), except that

it does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or

suffocation. Fast healing only works on a creature that is

alive. Unless otherwise noted, the ability does not allow lost

body parts to be reattached.

Immunity: Many creatures are immune to various

harmful effects. For example, creatures with fire immunity

take no damage from fire.

In  some  cases,  an  attack  can  deal  several  kinds  of

damage at once, and in these cases the immunity might

negate all, some, or none of the damage. Some attacks

combine smaller amounts of damage in discrete parts. For

example, an ice storm spell deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning

damage plus 2d6 points of cold damage. A creature that

has cold immunity suffers only the bludgeoning damage

from an ice storm spell. A creature that is immune to bludg-

eoning damage suffers only the cold damage from an ice

storm spell.

Other forms of attack deal multiple kinds of damage

simultaneously. For example, a creatures bite attack deals

piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage, but that

damage is not divided into separate parts. In these cases, a

creature vulnerable to any one of the types of damage

delivered takes the attacks full damage. For example, a

creature immune to slashing damage still suffers full

damage from a bite.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): This ability is possessed by crea-

tures whose eyes are extraordinarily sensitive to light, so

that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. See

Table 97: Light Sources and the Vision and Light section

in Chapter 9 of the Players Handbook; also see Low-Light

Vision in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Regeneration (Ex): Creatures with this ability are diffi-

cult to kill. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as sub-

dual damageand the creature automatically heals this

subdual damage at a fixed rate per round, as given in the

entry. (For example, an elemental weird has regeneration

10.) Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal

normal damage to the creature. The creatures descriptive

text contains these details.

A creature with regeneration that has been rendered

unconscious through subdual damage can be killed with a

coup de grace (see Helpless Defenders in Chapter 8 of the

Players Handbook) if the type of attack used for the coup de

grace deals normal damage to the creature.

Attack forms that dont deal hit point damage (for example,

a disintegrate effect and most poisons) ignore regeneration.

Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from star-

vation, thirst, or suffocation.

Body Part Regeneration: Some creatures have a special form

of regeneration that enables them to regrow lost portions of

their bodies or reattach severed limbs or body parts; details

are given in the creatures entry. (For instance, both the

darktentacles and the grell have tentacle regeneration.)

Resistance to Energy (Ex): The creature disregards

some amount of damage of the given type each round (com-

monly acid, cold, fire, or electricity). The entry indicates the

amount and type of damage ignored. For example, a gem

dragon has fire resistance 30, so it disregards the first 30

points of fire damage dealt to it each round.

Scent (Ex): This ability allows the creature to detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by

sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify

familiar odors just as humans can identify familiar sights

with their eyes.

A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents

within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind,

the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15

feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be

detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering

scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be

detected at triple normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location is not

revealedonly its presence somewhere within range. The

creature can take a partial action to note the direction of

the scent. If it moves to within 5 feet of the source, the crea-

ture can pinpoint that source.

A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by

smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track.

The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind

of  surface  holds  the  scent).  This  DC  increases  or

decreases depending on how strong the quarrys odor is,

the number of creatures in the tracked group, and the age

of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC

increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for

the Track feat (see Chapter 4 of the Player s Handbook).

Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface

conditions and poor visibility.

Spell Resistance (Ex): The creature can avoid the

effects of spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items that

directly affect it. The entry includes a numerical rating. To

determine if a spell or spell-like ability works, the spell-

caster makes a caster level check (roll 1d20 + caster level).

If the result equals or exceeds the creatures spell resist-

ance (SR) rating, the spell works normally, although the

creature is still allowed a saving throw (if applicable). See

Spell Resistance in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS

Guide for details.

Turn Resistance (Ex): The creature (usually an undead)

is less easily affected by clerics or paladins (see Turn and

Rebuke Undead in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook) than

it would be otherwise. When resolving a turn, rebuke, com-

mand, or bolster attempt, add the given bonus to the crea-

tures Hit Dice total. For example, a spawn of Kyuss has turn

resistance +2 and 4 HD. Attempts to turn, rebuke, com-

mand, or bolster treat the spawn as if it had 6 HD, though it

is a 4-HD creature for any other purpose.

SAVES

This line gives the creatures Fortitude, Reflex, and Will

save modifiers, which take into account its type, ability

score modifiers, and any special qualities.

ABILITIES

This line lists all six of the creatures ability scores, in order:

Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. These values are average for

the creatures kind. Most abilities work as described in

Chapter 1 of the Players Handbook, with the exceptions

noted below.

Strength: Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than char-

acters can. To determine a quadrupeds carrying capacity,

use Table 91: Carrying Capacity in the Players Handbook,

multiplying by the appropriate modifier for the creatures

size: Fine 1/4, Diminutive 1/2, Tiny 3/4, Small 1, Medium

1 1/2, Large 3, Huge 6, Gargantuan 12, and Colossal 24.

Intelligence: A creature can speak all the languages

mentioned in its descriptive text, plus one additional lan-

guage per point of Intelligence bonus. Any creature with an

Intelligence score of 3 or higher understands at least one

language (Common, unless otherwise noted).

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores.

Such a creature does not have an ability score of 0it lacks

the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0.

Other details of nonabilities are as follows.

Strength: Any creature that can physically manipulate

objects has at least 1 point of Strength.

A creature with no Strength score cant exert force, usu-

ally because it has no physical body (a banshee, for exam-

ple) or because it doesnt move (a shrieker; see Monster

Manual). The creature automatically fails Strength checks.

If it can attack, it applies its Dexterity modifier to its base

attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.

Dexterity: Any creature that can move has at least 1 point

of Dexterity.

A creature with no Dexterity score (a shrieker, for exam-

ple; see Monster Manual) cant move. If it can act (such as by

casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modifier to initia-

tive checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature

fails all Reflex saves and Dexterity checks.

Constitution: Any living creature has at least 1 point of

Constitution.

A creature with no Constitution score has no body (a ban-

shee,  for  example)  or  no  metabolism  (a  golem).  It  is

immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless

the effect works on objects. For example, a runic guardian is

unaffected by any type of poison but is susceptible to a dis-

integrate spell. The creature is also immune to ability

damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and it always fails

Constitution checks.

A creature with no Constitution score cannot heal damage

on its own, though it can be healed by external means (a spell

or an application of the Heal skill, for example). Negative

energy (such as an inflict spell) can heal undead creatures.

Constructs can be repaired in the same way an object can be

(see the creatures description for details). The regeneration

and fast healing special qualities work regardless of a crea-

tures Constitution score (or lack of one).

Intelligence: Any creature that can think, learn, or remem-

ber has at least 1 point of Intelligence.

A creature with no Intelligence score operates on simple

instincts or programmed instructions. It is immune to all

mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns and morale effects) and automatically fails Intelli-

gence checks.

Wisdom: Any creature that can perceive its environment

in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.

Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a crea-

ture.  Anything  without  a  Wisdom  score  also  has  no

Charisma score, and vice versa.

Charisma: Any creature capable of telling the difference

between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1

point of Charisma.

Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a crea-

ture. Anything without a Charisma score also has no

Wisdom score, and vice versa.

CREATURE FEATS

Some of the creatures in this book possess feats that are not mentioned

in the Players Handbook. These creature feats are described below.

ABILITY FOCUS [General]

One of the creatures special attacks is more potent than normal.

Benefit: The  Difficulty  Class  for  all  saving  throws  against  the

selected special attack increases by +2.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack.

Each time it is taken, it applies to a different special attack.

FLYBY ATTACK [General]

The creature can attack on the wing.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including

a dive) and another partial action at any point during the move. The

creature  cannot  take  a  second  move  action  during  a  round  when  it

makes a flyby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a partial action either

before or after its move.

HOVER [General]

The creature can halt its forward motion while flying, regardless of

its maneuverability.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: While  hovering,  the  creature  can  attack  with  all  its  natural

weapons, except for wing attacks. Some creatures may be able to make

additional attacks while hovering, as noted in the creatures descriptive

text. If the creature has a breath weapon, it can use the breath weapon

instead of making physical attacks.

If a creature hovers close to the ground in an area with lots of loose

debris,  the  draft  from  its  wings  creates  a  hemispherical  cloud  with  a

radius specified in the creatures descriptive text. The winds so gener-

ated  can  snuff  torches,  small  campfires,  exposed  lanterns,  and  other

small,  open  flames  of  nonmagical  origin.  The  cloud  obscures  vision,

and creatures caught within it are blinded while inside and for 1 round

after  emerging.  Each  creature  caught  in  the  cloud  must  succeed  at  a

Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creatures HD) to cast a spell.

Normal: A creature without this feat cannot halt its forward motion

without falling. A creature with average, poor, or clumsy maneuverability

can slow its flying movement to only half of its fly speed. (See Tactical

Aerial Movement in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.)

MULTIATTACK [General]

The creature is adept at using all its natural weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Three or more natural weapons.

Benefit: Each  of  the  creatures  secondary  attacks  with  natural

weapons takes only a 2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, each of the creatures secondary natural

attacks takes a 5 penalty.

MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING [General]

A creature with three or more hands can fight with a weapon in each

hand. It can make one extra attack per round with each extra weapon.

Prerequisite: Three or more hands.

Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by 2.

Normal: A creature without this feat takes a 6 penalty on attacks

made with its primary hand and a 10 penalty on attacks made with its

off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.)

See Attacking with Two Weapons, page 124 in the Players Handbook.

Special: This  feat  replaces  the  Two-Weapon  Fighting  feat  for  crea-

tures with more than two arms.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [General]

The creature can use a spell-like ability with a moments thought.

Benefit: Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does

not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another

actionincluding the use of another spell-like abilityin the same round

that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one

quickened spell-like ability per round. A spell-like ability that duplicates a

spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.

Each of a creatures spell-like abilities can be quickened only once per

day, and the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage

limit for any ability. Thus, if a demon chooses to quicken its darkness abil-

ity, it cannot use quickened darkness again the same day, though it could

use its darkness ability again normally (since it can use darkness at will), or

it could quicken another of its spell-like abilities, such as desecrate.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard

action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken,

the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities one additional

time per day.

SNATCH [General]

The creature can grapple more easily with its claws or bite.

Prerequisite: Claws or bite as a natural weapon attack.

Benefit: A  creature  with  this  feat  that  hits  with  a  claw  or  bite  attack

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. If it gets a hold with a claw on a creature four or more size

categories smaller than itself, it squeezes each round for automatic claw

damage. If it gets a hold with its bite on a creature three or more size cate-

gories smaller than itself, it automatically deals bite damage each round,

or if it does not move and takes no other action in combat, it deals double

bite  damage.  The  snatched  creature  gets  no  saving  throw  against  the

creatures breath weapon (if any).

The creature can drop a foe it has snatched as a free action or use a

standard  action  to  fling  it  aside.  The  feet  traveled  and  the  damage

taken by a flung foe are specified in the creatures descriptive text. If

the foe is flung while the creature is flying, the foe takes the specified

amount of damage or falling damage, whichever is greater.

Normal: Without  this  feat,  the  creature  must  conduct  grapple

attempts according to Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook.

MULTIDEXTERITY [General]

The creature is adept at using all its hands in combat.

WINGOVER [General]

The creature can change direction quickly while flying.

Prerequisite: Dex 15, three or more arms.

Benefit: The creature ignores all penalties for using an off hand.

Normal: Without this feat, a creature using an off hand takes a 4

penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks. A  creature  has

one primary hand, and all the others are off hands; for example, a four-

armed creature has one primary hand and three off hands.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: This  feat  allows  a  flying  creature  to  turn  up  to  180  degrees

once per round regardless of its maneuverability, in addition to any other

turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot gain altitude during the

round when it executes a wingover, but it can dive.

Special: This feat replaces the Ambidexterity feat for creatures with

Normal: A creature without this feat that has average, poor, or clumsy

maneuverability is limited to a turn of 90 degrees or 45 degrees. (See

more than two arms.

SKILLS

This line gives the creatures skills along with each skills mod-

ifier, which includes adjustments for ability scores, size, syn-

ergy bonuses, armor check penalties, magic items, feats, or

racial traits unless otherwise noted in the descriptive text. All

of a creatures skills were purchased as class skills unless the

creature has a character class. Any skill not mentioned in the

creatures entry is treated as a cross-class skill unless the crea-

ture has a character class, in which case it can purchase the

skill as any other member of that class can. A creatures type

and Intelligence score determine the number of skill points it

has (see Type Descriptions, earlier in the introduction).

The Skills section of the creatures descriptive text

recaps racial and other bonuses for the sake of clarity;

these bonuses should not be added to the creatures skill

modifiers unless otherwise noted. An asterisk (*) beside

the relevant score and in the Skills section indicates a con-

ditional adjustment.

FEATS

This line identifies the creatures feats. The creatures

descriptive text may contain additional information if a feat

works differently from the way it is described in this book

or in Chapter 5 of the Players Handbook. Some creatures also

receive bonus feats, designated by (B) following the feat

name in the statistics block. A creature need not meet the

prerequisites for a bonus feat.

Most creatures use the same feats that are available to

characters, but some have access to special feats. See the

Creature Feats sidebar for descriptions of these feats.

SECONDARY

STATISTICS BLOCK

This section includes information that the DM needs for

campaign purposes but not (usually) during an encounter.

In many cases when the main statistics block includes

information for several related creatures and the secondary

information for all those creatures is identical, the second-

ary statistics block appears only once.

CLIMATE/TERRAIN

This entry describes the locales where the creature is most

often found.

Cold: Arctic and subarctic climes. Any area that has

winter conditions for the greater portion of the year is cold.

Temperate: Any area that has alternating warm and cold

seasons is temperate.

Warm: Tropical and subtropical climes. Any area that

has summer conditions for the greater portion of the year

is warm.

Aquatic: Fresh or salt water.

Desert: Any dry area with sparse vegetation.

Forest: Any area covered with trees.

Hill: Any area with rugged but not mountainous terrain.

Marsh: Low, flat, waterlogged areas; includes swamps.

Mountains: Rugged terrain, higher than hills.

Plains: Any fairly flat area that is not a desert, swamp, or

forest.

Underground: A subterranean area.

ORGANIZATION

This line describes the kinds of groups the creature might

form. A range of numbers in parentheses indicates how

many combat-ready adults are in each type of group.

Many groups also have a number of noncombatants,

expressed as a percentage of the fighting population. Non-

combatants can include young, the infirm, slaves, or other

individuals who are not inclined to fight. A creatures Soci-

ety entry may include more details on noncombatants.

CHALLENGE RATING

This is the average level of a party of four adventurers for

which a single creature would be an encounter of moderate

difficulty. Assume a party of four fresh characters (full hit

points, full spells, and equipment appropriate to their

levels). Given reasonable luck, the party should be able to

win the encounter with some damage but no casualties. For

more information about Challenge Ratings, see Chapter 4

and Chapter 7 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

TREASURE

This entry reflects how much wealth the creature owns and

refers to Table 74: Treasure in the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide.

In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair

and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent crea-

tures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items)

tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.

Note: The random dungeon generation tables in Chapter

4 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide provide their own treasure

information. Use that information instead of the monsters

Treasure line whenever you refer to those tables.

Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures

can have varying amounts of each, as follows.

Standard:  Roll  once  under  each  type  of  treasures

column on the appropriate row for the creatures Challenge

Rating (for groups of creatures, use the Encounter Level for

the encounter instead).

Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple

standard treasure; in these cases, roll under each treasure

column two, three, or four times.

None: The creature collects no treasure of its own.

Nonstandard: Some creatures have quirks or habits that

affect the types of treasure they collect. These creatures use

the same treasure tables, but with special adjustments.

Fractional Coins: Roll on the Coins column, using the row

for the creatures Challenge Rating, but divide the result

as indicated.

% Goods or Items: The creature has goods or items only

some of the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll

d%. On a result that indicates treasure, make a normal roll

on the Goods column or the Items column (which may still

result in no goods or items).

Dice (that is, a 3-HD creature should be able to advance

up to 9 HD).

Double Goods or Items: Roll twice on the Goods or Items

Size Increases

column.

Parenthetical Notes: Some entries for goods or items

include notes that limit the types of treasure collected.

When a note includes the word no, it means the crea-

ture does not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a random

roll generates such a result, treat the result as nothing

instead. For example, if a creatures items entry reads no

flammables, and a random roll generates a scroll, the crea-

ture instead has no item at all (the scroll burned up, or the

creature left it behind).

When a note includes the word only, the creature

goes out of its way to collect treasure of the indicated

type. If an entry for Goods or Items indicates gems only,

roll on the Goods or Items column and treat any art

result as gems instead.

It sometimes will be necessary to reroll until the right

sort of item appears. For example, if a creatures items

entry reads nonflammables only, roll normally on the

Goods or Items column. If you get a flammable item, reroll

on the same table until you get a nonflammable one. If the

table you rolled on contains only flammable items, back up

a step and reroll until you get to a table that can give you an

appropriate item.

ALIGNMENT

This line gives the alignment that the creature is most

likely to have. Every alignment line includes a qualifier

that indicates how broadly that alignment applies to that

kind of creature.

Always: The creature is born with the given alignment.

The creature may have a hereditary predisposition to the

alignment or come from a plane that predetermines it. It is

possible for such individuals to change alignment, but such

individuals are either unique or one-in-a-million exceptions.

Usually: The majority of these creatures have the given

alignment. This may be due to strong cultural influences, or

it may be a legacy of their origin. For example, most elves

inherited their chaotic good alignment from their creator,

the deity Corellon Larethian.

Often: The creature tends toward the listed alignment,

by either nature or nurture, but not strongly. A plurality

(40% to 50%) of individuals have the given alignment, but

exceptions are common.

ADVANCEMENT

This book describes only the weakest and most common

version of each creature. The Advancement line of a crea-

tures entry shows how tough the creature can get, in

terms of extra Hit Dice. (This is not an absolute limit, but

exceptions are extremely rare.) In general, a creature

should be able to gain up to three times its original Hit

Creatures may become larger as they gain Hit Dice.

A size increase can affect a creatures physical ability

scores, natural armor, Armor Class, attack bonus, and

damage, as indicated on the following tables.

and Armor Class.

Repeat the adjustment if the creature moves up more than one size

category. For example, if a Medium-size creature with two claw attacks

dealing 1d4 points of damage each advances from Medium-size to

Huge, the damage dealt by each of its claw attacks increases to 1d8.

Skills and Feats

To determine the number of skill points and feats an

advanced creature has, use the formulas given for its type

in the Type Descriptions section of the introduction. The

only difference is that if you need to calculate its extra Hit

Dice for those formulas, use the minimum Hit Dice for its

old size rather than its new size from the Typical Creature

Statistics by Type table. (Doing this prevents the advanced

creature from having fewer skill points and feats than it did

when it was smaller.)

Other Improvements

As its Hit Dice increase, the creatures attack bonuses and

saving throw modifiers might improve, and it could gain

more feats and skills, depending on its type.

Saving throw bonuses are given in Table 31: Base Save

and Base Attack Bonuses in the Players Handbook. A good

saving throw uses the higher of the given values.

Note that if the creature acquires a character class, it

improves according to its class, not its type.

Creatures with Character Classes

If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:40 PM  Page 21

for multiclassing given in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook.

The creatures character level equals the number of class

levels it has, plus the total Hit Dice for its kind, if greater

than 1. For example, an ogre normally has 4 HD. If it picks

up one level in the barbarian class, it becomes a 5th-level

character: 1st-level barbarian/4th-level ogre (its monster

class) and adds 1d12 (for its barbarian Hit Die) to its hit

point total. A creature with 1 or fewer HD trades out its crea-

ture Hit Die for its first level of a character class. Thus, it uses

only its character level (see Monsters as Races in Chapter 2

of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide for details). In this case, the

creature retains all its racial benefits and adjustments (such

as racial bonuses to the use of skills) but gains no feats or

skill points for its monster class. Additional Hit Dice from a

character class never affect a creatures size.

A creatures monster class is always its favored class, and

the creature never suffers XP penalties for having it.

Effective Character Level: Some of the creatures in this

book are capable of having levels in a class, and when they do,

they are significantly more powerful than the races described

in the Players Handbook. This difference in power is expressed

as the creatures level adjustment (a positive number). This

number and the creatures Hit Dice are added to the creatures

class level to determine its effective character level, or ECL.

For instance, an avolakia PC has a level adjustment of +5

and 10 HD; thus, a 1st-level avolakia sorcerer has an ECL of

16, and it is the equivalent of a 16th-level character. The

creature would be a good fit in a party whose other mem-

bers were at or about 16th level, but it would be too power-

ful for a party of lower-level characters.

DESCRIPTIVE TEXT

The descriptive text opens with a short narrative about the

monster: what it does, what it looks like, and what is most

noteworthy about it. The following sections of the text

describe how the creature fights and give details on special

attacks, special qualities, skills, and feats.

Notes

New size due to 13 HD.

Constitution from 14 to 18 for becoming Large.

Dexterity from 10 to 8 due to size increase.

No change.

Natural armor improves, but Dexterity and size

penalties apply.

Base attack bonus for a 13-HD outsider is +13.

Adjustments are +7 (for Strength 24), 1 (for Large

size), and +1 (for Weapon Focus) for a primary

attack bonus of +20.

Each d8 becomes 2d6, Strength 24 provides bonus

of +7 to damage.

Reach increases due to Large size.

The save DC against the creatures kiss of death

attack rises from 15 to 20 (+3 for half of its additional

Hit Dice rounded down, and +2 because its

Constitution modifier rose from +2 to +4).

SR rises by 1 for each additional point of CR.

At 13 HD, good saves have a base +8 bonus; all

saves adjusted for ability scores.

Strength increases by 8, Constitution increases by 4,

Dexterity decreases by 2.

Adding 7 HD raises skill max ranks to 16 and

adds 63 skill points.

Advancing this creature to 13 HD adds two feats.

Challenge Rating rises by 2, since the dune stalkers

Hit Dice have been doubled (see Tougher Monsters

in Chapter 4 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide).

Abeils are insectlike humanoids known for their industri-

ousness and their complex social structure. They are com-

monly referred to as bee people. Their society has an

expansionist philosophya fact that troubles those whose

lands they intrude upon. Rather than resorting to war, abeils

prefer to overcome rivals through superior resourcefulness

and industry.

An abeil looks like a cross between an elf and a bee. A

vassal or queen stands more than 7 feet high and has slender

but sinewy legs and arms. A soldier is at least 10 feet tall and

considerably more muscular than either of the other two

varieties. An abeils hands and feet have four digits each. Its

body is covered with bristly fur, colored in alternating bands

of black and yellow. The creatures head and facial features

resemble those of an elf, except that the abeil has black,

22

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:41 PM  Page 23

faceted eyes and long antennae. Like a bee, an abeil has

translucent wings.

Abeils speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan.

COMBAT

All abeils prefer to fight from the sky, making ranged

attacks and sonic assaults upon their foes below. If forced to

fight on the ground, they coordinate their attacks to make

the best use of their ranged weapons (and spells, for those

capable of casting them). In melee, they prefer to swarm

around particularly tough opponents and sting them with

their enfeebling poison.

Abeils fight to the death

because they believe that

cowardice on the battlefield

could doom the hive. They

rarely wear armor because it

impedes their ability to fly.

Drone (Su): As a full-round

action, an abeil can beat its

wings to create a droning

buzz in a 60-foot spread.

Each creature in the area

must make a Will save (see

below  for  DCs)  or  fall

asleep as the sleep spell. There is

no Hit Dice limit for this effect.

Abeils are immune to their

own drone attacks as well as

those of other abeils.

Improved Grab (Ex): If

an abeil hits a single target

that is at least one size category

smaller than itself with both

claws, it deals normal dam-

age and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action

without provoking an

attack of opportunity (see below

for grapple bonuses). If it gets a hold, it

automatically hits with its sting. Thereafter, the abeil has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

its claws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the abeil is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals damage from both claws

and the sting.

Hive Mind (Ex): All abeils within 25 miles of their queen

are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particu-

lar danger, they all are. If one in a particular group is not

flat-footed, none of them are. No abeil in such a group is

considered flanked unless they all are.

VASSAL

Vassals are the backbone of abeil society. It is they who

provide the menial labor for the hive. They gather pollen,

maintain the hive-city, and obey their queens every com-

mand. Vassals produce the necessary goods for the abeil

society, provide both mundane and specialized services,

and advance the culture and techology of their hive city. A

few even choose to leave behind their mundane tasks and

pursue more individualistic paths, such as philosophy, art,

religion, and politics. These abeils form an elite conclave

called the vassal court that reports directly to the queen

and serves as her council.

Combat

Unless ordered to attack, vassals flee combat to

notify the hive of the threat. When armed for

battle, they fight with light flails.

Drone (Su): Will save DC 9.

A

Improved Grab (Ex): A

vassals grapple bonus is +1.

Poison  (Ex):  A  vassal

delivers its poison (Fortitude

save DC 10) with each success-

ful sting attack. The initial and

secondary damage is the same

(1d4 points of Strength damage).

SOLDIER

These creatures account for

fully a third of an abeil hive-

citys  population. The  sol-

diers are the queens army

the  first  and  last  line  of

defense  for  their  hive.  They  are

trained to respond swiftly to any

danger.  Soldiers  consider  most

nearby civilizations to be threats

and treat uninvited visitors with

grave suspicion.

Combat

MC

Abeil soldiers are often called storm-

wings because of the thunderous noise they make in battle.

They prefer to meet a threat by using their stormwing

attacks and bows first, then meleeing with ranseurs and

stingers as needed.

Drone (Su): Will save DC 14.

Improved Grab (Ex): A soldiers grapple bonus is +16.

Poison (Ex): A soldier delivers its poison (Fortitude save

DC 16) with each successful sting attack. The initial and sec-

ondary damage is the same (2d4 points of Strength damage).

Stormwing (Su): As a full-round action, a soldier in flight

can hover and deliver a destructive sonic attack with its

wings. The attack deals 6d6 points of damage to all (except

other abeils) within a 40-foot burst (Reflex save DC 16 for

half damage). Once the soldier uses this ability, it must wait

1d4 rounds before using it again.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:41 PM  Page 24

Special Enemy (Ex): An abeil soldier may select a type of

creature as a special enemy. This ability is similar to the rangers

favored enemy ability, and the soldier may choose from the

same list (see the Ranger entry in Chapter 3 of the Players

Handbook). Each soldier may select only one special enemy.

The soldier receives a +3 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense

Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks when using

these skills against its special enemy. Likewise, a soldier

gets this same bonus on weapon damage rolls against crea-

tures of the selected type.

QUEEN

At the pinnacle of any abeil society is the queen, who rules

with absolute power. All the abeils in her realm live and die

at her command. Though she was born to rule, the typical

queen routinely seeks the advice of her court before com-

mitting to any major decisions.

The queen selects a mate from her vassal court and per-

sonally rears future queens. Each hive-city maintains 15

juvenile queens in addition to the reigning queen. Each

such young queen has the same statistics as a vassal.

Combat

An abeil queen can cast powerful spells when threatened,

and her poison is more virulent than that of any other abeil.

However, she is rarely in combat because she depends pri-

marily on her soldiers to protect her.

Drone (Su): Will save DC 21.

Improved Grab (Ex): A queens grapple bonus is +18.

Poison (Ex): A queen delivers her poison (Fortitude save

DC 20) with each successful sting attack. The initial and sec-

ondary damage is the same (1d2 points of Strength drain).

Spells: An abeil queen can cast divine spells as a 16th-

level druid (spells/day 6/7/6/6/5/5/3/3/2; save DC 15 +

spell level).

ABEIL SOCIETY

The hive-city is the central hub of the abeils busy society.

Vassals buzz here and there, ensuring that vital city services

continue, while patrols of soldiers vigilantly keep the peace

and protect the hive against outside threats.

Abeils are highly imperialistic, though they are not so

much concerned with conquering other races as they are

with setting up new hive-cities. Nevertheless, this goal puts

them  into  conflict  with  nearly  every  other  race  they

encounter, since socieities in their path must fight for space

and resources or be pushed out by the abeil civilization.

When a hive-city becomes too large, one of the young

queens is given a substance called royal jelly, which converts

her into a full-fledged queen. She then takes twenty vassals

and five soldiers and leaves to set up a new hive-city at a pre-

viously scouted location.

ABEIL CHARACTERS

Although abeil society is extremely rigid, there is enough

freedom within a hive to allow an individual abeil its own

choice of profession. Even so, relatively few abeils desire to

progress as characters. For those that do, the favored class is

druid for queens or vassals and ranger for soldiers.

An abeil PCs effective character level (ECL) is its class

level plus the appropriate modifier: vassal +3, soldier +11,

queen +21. For example, a 1st-level vassal druid has an ECL

of 4 and is the equivalent of a 4th-level character.

Spreading fires throughout towns, fields and forests, ash rats

constitute a deadly menace to any civilized society. These

little nomadic horrors are naturally drawn to large sources

of flame; in fact, they get their nourishment from heat in a

way that not even the sages understand. These creatures are

so hot that they ignite any combustibles they touch.

An ash rat is a 2-foot-long rodent with orange eyes. It has

the general shape of a rat, and its fur is black, gray, or brown.

Its oversized front teeth are a dull yellow color. An ash rats

exact appearance is difficult for most onlookers to discern

because it exudes a perpetual cloud of sooty smoke that

hides it from view.

COMBAT

An ash rat normally flees from combat if possible. When

cornered, it fights defensively, spitting fire at those who

threaten it. Its heated body is painful to the touch, which

prevents prudent foes from closing.

Flame Spit (Su): Once per round, an ash rat can spit

flames at one target up to 10 feet away. This attack deals 1d4

points of fire damage.

At first glance, an asperi appears to be nothing more than an

unusually beautiful horse. An individual asperi can be

white, gray, or dun-colored, with a graceful, flowing mane of

silver, white, or light gray. A secondary mane of the same

shade as the first extends from the creatures front shoulders

down along the backs of its front legs.

Unlike typical horses, asperis are intelligent magical

beasts. They live in the permanent cold of remote mountain

peaks, where they gallop across the glaciers and through the

frigid skies. By catching prevailing winds and flying with

them, asperis can move even faster through the skies than

their normal flying speed permits. Their ability to ride the

wind in this way has earned them the common name of

wind steeds.

The typical asperi belongs to a herd with up to twenty

members, but it spends much of its time roaming the skies

alone or with just one or two chosen companions. Hip-

pogriffs and griffons, the mortal enemies of the asperis, are

almost never encountered in mountains where wind steeds

live, since the far more intelligent asperis take pains to drive

them off or kill them. Asperis also dislike rocs, but they get

along well with pegasi. Lasting friendships between asperis

and pegasi are rare, however, because the winged horses

seldom venture into the cold mountain heights where the

wind steeds live.

If captured when very young and raised with respect and

consideration, an asperi can be trained as a steed. Any poten-

tial rider must realize that an asperi mount is not a mere

animal; it is an intelligent, sentient being with opinions

Heat (Ex): An ash

rats body heat deals 1d2 points

of  fire  damage  to  each  creature

(except another ash rat) that touches it. Any

flammable item in contact with an ash rat must make

a successful Reflex save (DC 10) or catch fire (see Catching on

Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide). When an

ash rat dies, its body burns away completely in 1 round.

Fire Heal (Ex): Fire and heat heal an ash rats wounds.

For every round that the creature is exposed to flame or

heat intense enough to deal at least 1 point of damage, the

creature instead gains the benefit of a cure minor wounds

spell (1 hit point healed). Two or more ash rats touching

each other provide enough heat for fire healing.

Fire Subtype (Ex): An ash rat is immune to fire damage

but takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for

half damage is allowed. In that case, the creature takes half

damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Smoky Hide (Ex): An ash rat continually sheds smoke

from its body. This smoky haze is so thick that it grants the

creature one-half concealment (20% miss chance) and

makes hiding easier (see Skills, below). Though it is difficult

to see the ash rat because of the smoke rising from its body,

the smoke itself is visible, provided that the area has suffi-

cient light by which to see it.

Skills: An ash rat uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its

Strength modifier for Climb checks. *In smoky or foggy

areas, an ash rat gains a +8 bonus on Hide checks.

and ideas of its own, and it demands to be treated as such.

Under no circumstances will an asperi tolerate a rider who

is chaotic or evil. A paladin might convince an adult wind

steed to serve as a permanent mount, but full-grown asperis

usually agree to bear riders only in the short term, since they

value their independence.

Asperis with 5 or more HD are very

rare. Such creatures have iridescent

hides that glisten like snow and

rainbow-hued manes and tails.

ride the wind, it gains bonus movement (+1 ft. to fly speed

for each 1 mph of the prevailing wind) when moving with

winds faster than 20 mph. Adverse winds do not slow the

creature down, but they provide no bonus movement.

An asperi carrying a rider gallops through the air so

smoothly that the rider can cast spells

without making Concentration checks,

provided that the asperi does not

attack  or  perform  any  sudden

aerial maneuvers.

COMBAT

Asperis are inoffensive

creatures by nature. Given

their  great  speed,  their

usual response to danger

is simply to fly away.

Like most horses, how-

ever, they can fight

ferociously  when

aroused. In com-

bat, they usually

kick  and  slash

with their front

hooves and bite

with their power-

ful jaws.

Asperis prefer

to fight from the air,

which gives them a

significant advantage

against opponents on the

ground, under the right condi-

tions. Near their mountain homes, asperis

always look for opportunities to attack intruders

when the latter are at the edges of cliffs or maneuvering on

narrow ledges. The wind steeds use combinations of

charges, bull rushes, flyby attacks, and trip attacks (all

while airborne) to force their enemies over precipices or

into glacial crevasses. They usually prefer to use their

speed and maneuverability to avoid combat until condi-

tions are in their favor.

Cold Subtype (Ex): An asperi is immune to cold damage

but takes double damage from fire unless a saving throw for

half damage is allowed. In that case, the creature takes half

damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Dodge Arrows (Ex): A flying asperi gains a +2 dodge

bonus to AC against any missile attack during any turn in

which it takes a move action. If it has a rider, he or she

also gains the bonus. The bonus lasts until the asperis

next turn.

Feather Fall (Sp): An asperi can use feather fall up to four

times per day. Caster level 4th.

Ride the Wind (Su): This ability is similar to the effect

of the air walk spell in most respects. When an asperi uses

26

Telepathy (Su): An

asperi can communicate

with any creature that

has an Intelligence score

of at least 1 through a

form of telepathy. This

communication has

a  range  of  60  feet,

and its complexity

is limited by the Intelli-

gence score of the other

creature.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex):

Because of its preternatu-

ral alertness, an asperi re-

tains its Dexterity bonus to

AC even when flat-footed,

and  it  cannot  be  flanked.

Wind Immunity (Ex):

Winds, either natural or magi-

cal, have no effect on an asperi

unless it chooses to ride them for

additional  movement  (see  Ride  the

Wind, above). This benefit applies equally to

mountain gales, magical windstorms, elemental whirl-

winds, and other similar effects.

TRAINING AN ASPERI

Young asperis are worth 7,000 gp per head. They mature at

the same rate as horses do. A professional trainer charges

2,000 gp to rear an asperi or to train it as a mount.

Training an asperi requires a successful Handle Animal

check (DC 22 for a young asperi, DC 29 for an adult) and the

willing cooperation of the creature. An asperi can fight

while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless

he or she succeeds at a Ride check.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for an asperi is up to 150

pounds; a medium load, 151300 pounds; and a heavy load,

301450 pounds. Unlike most flying mounts, an asperi can

fly with a medium or heavy load, thanks to its ride the

wind ability.

An automaton is a crea-

ture built for labor or

war. Although the

construct is super-

ficially similar to

a  golem,  an  au-

tomaton is actu-

ally  quite  differ-

ent.  It  is  built  with

clockwork parts and animated

by means of powerful shadow

magic. While the shadow

consciousness of an autom-

aton sometimes makes it

difficult for the creature to

interact  with  the  physical

world, it nevertheless can be a

fearsome opponent.

COMBAT

Like golems, automatons

are  mindless  but  tenacious

combatants. Since they are

emotionless in combat, they

are not easily provoked. Automa-

tons  dont  use  weapons,  even  if

ordered  to  do  so.  Instead,  they  always

strike  with  their  limbs,  which  are  formidable

weapons in themselves.

An automaton follows the orders of its creator. The crea-

ture can be commanded directly by its creator if the latter

is within 60 feet and both visible and audible to the

automaton. If uncommanded, an automaton follows its

last instruction to the best of its ability, though it returns

any attacks directed at it. Typically, the creator gives an

automaton a simple set of instructions (such as Remain

in this area and attack all creatures that enter, or Attack

all bipedal creatures you see, or Ring a gong and

attack, or the like) to govern its actions in his or

her absence.

Construct Traits: An

automaton is immune to

mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep, paralysis,

stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic ef-

fects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on

objects. The creature is

not subject to critical hits,

subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, en-

ergy drain, or death from

massive  damage.  It

cannot  heal  itself

but  can  be  healed

through  repair.  It

cannot be raised or

resurrected.  An  au-

tomaton  has  dark-

vision (60-foot range).

Unreliable (Ex): The

shadow consciousness of

an automaton is only quasi-

real, like the consciousness of a

creation such as a simulacrum. The creature is thus some-

times slow to react to the changing environment around it.

At the beginning of each round in which an automaton

attempts to act, roll 1d20. On a result of 11 or better, it acts

normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

PULVERIZER

The pulverizer automaton was originally intended as a

mining machine. Its sonic shriek was designed to weaken

stone, and its wedges to finish the job of breaking it up.

Thanks to its blindsight ability, this construct is particularly

effective underground.

A pulverizer looks something like a four-legged, metal

lobster with spiked wedges instead of claws. Instead of a

head, it has a round opening at the top of its body from

which it emits its sonic attacks.

Combat

When attacking, a lone pulverizer usually looses its sonic

shriek, then moves in to use its slam attacks against any

foes who are still moving. Teams of these creatures pose a

formidable threat on the battlefield, since one or more can

hang back and shriek every round while the others close

with foes.

Sonic Shriek (Ex): Once per round as a standard action, a

pulverizer can loose a cone of sonic energy 30 feet long.

Everything within the cone takes 1d8 points of sonic

damage. In addition, every creature within the cone that

fails a Fortitude save (DC 13) is stunned for 1 round. (This

value incorporates a +5 racial bonus to the save DC.)

Blindsight (Ex): A pulverizer is blind, but it maneuvers

and fights as well as a sighted creature by using sonar, like

that of a bat. This ability enables it to discern objects and crea-

tures within 40 feet. The pulverizer usually does not need to

make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range

of its blindsight. A silence spell negates this ability.

HAMMERER

The hammerer automaton is a roughly human-shaped,

bipedal war machine adapted from another automaton that

was designed for construction and heavy lifting. One of

the creatures two arms ends in a massive claw or pincer,

the other in an even more massive hammer.

Combat

Hammerers are not built for fancy tactical maneuvers, but

they are still fearsome opponents. On the battlefield, com-

manders simply point teams of these constructs at the

enemy and let them go.

The powerful hammer-arm that gives the hammerer its

name is a nasty piece of businessheavy, solid, and deadly.

The pincer-arm is used mainly for lifting things. The con-

struct can attack with only one arm at a time, and although

it can slam with either arm, it favors the hammer-arm for all

its attacks.

The avolakia is a nauseating creature that combines the

worst aspects of a worm, an octopus, and an insect. It has

exceptional intelligence and is incredibly wise and glib.

Avolakias are experts at infiltrating humanoid societies for a

variety of nefarious purposes.

An avolakia stands 10 feet tall. Its wormlike body is

pallid and gray, shimmering with a pale yellow slime. The

creature supports itself and moves about on a set of six

suckered tentacles, each of which is tipped with a multi-

faceted yellow eye. Its head consists of a fleshy sheath

that houses a set of three cruelly hooked mandibles. Eight

long, spidery arms tipped with tiny insectoid claws that

almost look like human hands protrude from a set of

ridges about halfway up the creatures body. An avolakia

reeks of mold and decay.

Although they can digest dead or living flesh, avolakias

find both disgusting and resort to such sustenance only

under dire circumstances. They prefer to eat undead flesh

fresh off a zombies flank is best.

Avolakias speak their own language (a guttural, slobber-

ing tongue). Many of them also understand Undercommon

and other languages, though they do not have the vocal

apparatus to speak them. With its polymorph self spell-like

ability, however, an avolakia can assume a form that is capa-

ble of speaking any language it desires. This ability also

enhances its disguise capabilities and aids it in laying

ambushes for unwary opponents.

COMBAT

An avolakia prefers to cast spells or use its spell-like abilities

from a distance while its undead minions close to melee

with the enemy. If forced into melee, an avolakia uses its

poisonous bite and flails with its eight claws. Occasionally,

the creature may choose to use poison against one or more

foes, then assume humanoid form and use its suggestion abil-

ity to bend them to its will.

Poison (Ex): An avolakia delivers its poison (For-

titude save DC 18) with each successful bite attack.

The initial damage is 1d6 points of Wisdom dam-

age, and the secondary damage is 2d6

points of Wisdom damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willchill

touch,  cause  fear,  detect  magic,  disrupt

undead, gentle repose, ghoul touch, halt

undead,  mage  hand,  polymorph  self

(humanoid form only), read magic, spec-

tral hand; 3/dayanimate dead, create

undead, enervation, vampiric touch. Caster

level 14th; save DC 16 + spell level.

Suggestion (Sp): When in hu-

manoid form, an avolakia has a

melodious and hypnotic voice. By

speaking soothingly to any one

creature in range that under-

stands its spoken words, the

avolakia can create an effect

identical to that of a quickened

suggestion spell (caster level 10th;

Will save DC 19). An opponent

in eye contact with the creature

while it makes its suggestion

takes a 2 penalty on the saving

throw. The avolakia can use this

ability a number of times per day

equal to its Charisma modifier

(usually six times per day).

Defensive Aura (Sp): An avolakia has a +6 deflec-

tion bonus to Armor Class. This ability is always in effect.

Fire Resistance (Ex): The slime that an avolakia con-

stantly exudes grants it fire resistance 10. It also helps the

creature escape more easily (see Skills, below).

Immunities (Su): Because of its close association with

undead, the avolakia has developed immunity to cold, dis-

ease, energy drain, and paralysis.

Regeneration (Ex): An avolakia takes normal damage

from acid, fire, and electricity.

Skills: Because of the slime it constantly exudes, an avo-

lakia gains a +10 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.

AVOLAKIA SOCIETY

Avolakias band together in small tribes deep in the recesses of

the earth. They delight in creating and modifying undead of

all sorts, which they use for both food and defense. Avolakia

clerics make good use of the create greater undead spell to create

mummies, spectres, vampires, and ghosts. They often arm

these greater undead with magic weapons, armor, and won-

drous items to aid them in defending the avolakias territory.

The majority of avolakias have taken to worshiping Kyuss, a

little-known quasi-deity. Despite the fact that their deitys

divine status does not enable him to grant spells, many

avolakia clerics are quite powerful, drawing their spells

from some unknown source.

So eager are the avolakias to ele-

vate Kyuss to full deity status

that they actively recruit new wor-

shipers for his cult. The creatures typically

establish settlements beneath the communi-

ties of surface races, then use their polymorph self

and suggestion abilities to infiltrate their

target areas. Often a group of avolakias

infiltrates a local religious institution and

attempts to assume control of the funerary

rites for the community. Should the

avolakias succeed, they have access to

plenty of corpses that they can use to

create more undead. In addition, the

disguised avolakias are in a perfect

position to corrupt selected members of

the community and slowly indoctrinate

them into the cult of Kyuss.

Avolakias also interact with various

Underdark races. Some, such as the

drow, they infiltrate in much the

same way as they do surface races.

With  others,  such  as  mind

flayers, they openly propose

alliances for the two groups mu-

tual benefit. A typical agreement between

mind flayers and avolakias stipulates that

both groups hunt down and capture

intelligent beings. The mind flayers

consume the unfortunate victims brains,

then hand the bodies over to the avolakias, who use them to

create undead. But such alliances tend to fall apart eventually,

either when the mind flayers enslave captives for long periods

before consuming their brains, or when the avolakias kill a

few mind flayers to make more powerful undead creatures.

AVOLAKIA CHARACTERS

An avolakias favored class is sorcerer, but avolakia clerics are

also quite common, and tribal leaders are always clerics of

Kyuss. Avolakia spellcasters of any sort tend to focus on

necromantic magic. Though they may choose from any of

Kyusss domains (Death, Evil, Magic, or Trickery), the major-

ity choose Death and Evil.

An avolakia PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to

its class level + 15; thus, a 1st-level avolakia sorcerer has an

ECL of 16 and is the equivalent of a 16th-level character.

(Medium-size)

A banshee is the spirit of a strong-

willed,  selfish  individual  of  a

humanoid race. Because of its

rage at the loss of its own life, it

delights in bringing death to any

living creature it encounters.

This creature appears as a translu-

cent image of the form it held in life.

With the passage of time, the ban-

shees image tends to become blurred

and indistinct, though the creature

remains recognizable as a humanoid.

The very presence of a banshee creates a

pall over the landscape. Its ability to stunt

the growth of plants combined with its deadly wail

eventually reduces the surrounding territory to blasted heath

and wasteland. Largely for this reason, many cultures con-

sider a sudden blight upon the land to be an omen of death.

A banshee speaks the languages that it knew in life.

COMBAT

Banshees hate all living things with an unholy fury, and they

readily attack anyone foolish enough to trespasses within

their territories. A banshee typically uses its horrific appear-

ance to drive off less powerful foes, then employs its howling

wail one or more times to damage any who remain. Finally, it

finishes off the intruders with its Charisma drain in melee. If

overmatched, the creature flees into the earth, usually to a

gravelike lair that it maintains beneath the surface.

Charisma Drain (Su): An individual struck by a ban-

shee must make a Fortitude save (DC 26) or permanently

lose 1d4 points of Charisma (or 2d4 points on a critical hit).

The banshee heals 5 points of damage (10 on a critical hit)

whenever it drains Charisma, gaining any excess as tempo-

rary hit points.

Horrific Appearance (Su): Any living creature within 60

feet that views a banshee must make a successful Fortitude

save (DC 26) or permanently lose 1d4 points of Strength, 1d4

points of Dexterity, and 1d4 points of Constitution. A creature

that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected

by the same banshees horrific appearance for 24 hours.

Wail (Su): During the night, a banshee can loose a

deadly wail. This attack can slay up to eighteen living

creatures within a 30-foot spread centered on the ban-

shee, or within a 60-foot cone extending from the

banshee, at the creatures option. A successful For-

titude save (DC 26) negates the effect. Once a

banshee wails, it must wait 1d4 rounds before it

can do so again, and it can wail no more than

three times per day.

Detect Living (Sp): This ability functions like

the commune with nature spell, except that it

detects only living creatures and the range is

one-half mile. The banshee can use detect living

up to three times per day.

Incorporeal Subtype: A banshee can be

harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1

or better magic weapons, spells, spell-like

abilities, and supernatural abilities. The crea-

ture has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force

effects or attacks made with ghost

touch weapons. A banshee can pass

through solid objects, but not

force effects, at will. Its attacks

ignore natural armor, armor,

and shields, but deflection bonuses

and force effects work normally against

them. A banshee always moves silently and cannot

be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Stunt Plants (Su): Once per day, a banshee can stunt all

normal plants within a one-half mile radius. This ability

otherwise functions like the stunt version of a diminish

plants spell (caster level 18th).

Undead Traits: A banshee is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not subject

to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. A banshee

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Immunities (Ex): A bladeling takes no damage from acid,

and it is immune to rust attacks despite its metallic hide.

Outsider Traits: A bladeling has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

BLADELING SOCIETY

Most bladelings live in the city of Zoronor, on Ocanthus,

the fourth layer of Acheron. Some, however, wander the

other layers of Acheron or even the other planes.

Bladelings are superstitious and xenophobic creatures, so

its no surprise that they abhor intrusions into their home

territory. (Of course, as residents of Ocanthusa place of

flying storms of bladesthey rarely have visitors.) Their

society is prone to internal strife, but they immediately

band together against external dangers. Bladelings that

travel the planes are reasonably amiable toward strangers,

perhaps because they have picked up a degree of tolerance

for other beings through constant contact. Even so, they

tend not to trust anyone they do not know.

BLADELING CHARACTERS

A bladelings favored class is fighter. Leaders are often

cleric/fighters, and the race is known for its assassins as

well. Bladeling clerics usually worship Hextor.

A bladeling PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to

its class level + 1; thus, a 1st-level bladeling fighter has an

ECL of 2 and is the equivalent of a 2nd-level character.

Bladelings are xenophobic beings of humanoid shape.

Though they hail from Acheron, most scholars believe

that the race emigrated there from another plane, possibly

the Nine Hells of Baator, the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, or

even some unknown metal-based plane.

A bladeling has skin of a dull metallic hue, spotted with

patches of metallic spines. Its eyes gleam like shards of

purple ice, and its blood is black and oily.

Bladelings speak Common, and those with high enough

Intelligence scores to know an additional language usually

speak Infernal as well.

COMBAT

Bladelings are quick to jump into battle, relying on their

tough skins and natural agility to see them through any

fight. They are also brave, so they usually focus their attacks

on the most dangerous combatants they see.

Razor Storm (Ex): Once per day, a bladeling can expel

shrapnellike bits of its skin in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6

points of piercing damage to any creature in the area. A

Reflex save (DC 10) halves the damage. After this attack, the

bladelings natural armor bonus drops to +2 for 24 hours.

HD (Huge)

Blood apes are peaceful diurnal

foragers with a unique defense

mechanism. The alpha male

(or leader) of a troop or patrol

has the magical ability to make

himself and other members of

the group larger. Their Huge

forms  (see  Growth,

below) allow them to

deal more damage in

combat, but the ability

to return to Large size

means  that  they  re-

quire substantially less

food than Huge crea-

tures would. Sages and

scholars suggest that

this ability is a residual

effect of exceptionally strong growth and form-altering

magic practiced on the ancestors of the current blood apes

millennia ago.

A blood ape resembles a red-furred mountain gorilla. Its

body is compact but muscular, and its sinewy arms end in

humanlike hands. The alpha male is typically the largest ape

in a group. Unlike the rest of the group, he has silvery fur

and a balding head.

Blood apes are exceptionally territorial, and they fight to

the death to protect their young and their land from

intruders. Patrols occasionally forage far from the colonys

lair in search of new feeding grounds.

COMBAT

The alpha male in any group of blood apes begins using his

growth ability on the other males at the first sign of intrud-

ers. After receiving the benefit of this power, all the males

pair up to attack specific opponents. Blood apes give no

warning and make no display before attacking. The alpha

male uses his growth ability on himself last, then enters

melee. If females and young are present, they beat a hasty

retreat while the males fight.

Growth (Sp): The alpha male in every group of blood

apes can use this power up to eight times per day. It func-

tions like an animal growth

spell  (caster  level  9th),

except that it works only

on adult male blood apes.

The  following  changes

apply to all subject blood

apes as long as the effect of

growth lasts: SZ Huge; HD

Improved Grab (Ex): If

a blood ape hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size

category smaller than itself

with a claw attack, it deals

normal  damage  and  at-

tempts to start a grapple as

a free action without pro-

voking an attack of oppor-

tunity (grapple bonus +13,

or +25 if under growth ef-

fect). If it hits with both

claws, it can also rend in the

same round. Once it has a

hold, the blood ape has the option to conduct the grapple

normally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the blood ape is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals claw damage.

Rend (Ex): If a blood ape hits with both claws, it latches

onto the opponents body and tears the flesh. This attack

automatically deals an additional 2d4+7 points of damage

(or 2d4+13 if under a growth effect; see above).

BLOOD APE SOCIETY

One-third of the noncombatants in any colony are infants

and youths, and the balance are adult females. The females

have the same statistics as the males, but without the growth,

improved grab, and rend abilities. The young have no

combat ability.

The alpha male of a colony is the only one permitted to

mate with the females of that group. As a colony grows

larger, the younger males eventually break off and attempt

to form their own colonies by stealing a few females. A

male who succeeds immediately gains the growth ability,

and over a period of six months he develops the character-

istic silver fur and bald head of an alpha male.

Boggles are clever, gibbering scavengers

that behave much like some species of

monkeys. They do not value treasure, but

they do like to collect bright, shiny objects

such as coins, precious gems, and jewelry, as well

as bits of polished junk. In addition, they can often be

tempted with food and sweets.

A boggle is a 3-foot-tall, hairless humanoid with a rubbery

hide. It has a large, bulbous, bald head, huge ears, and dis-

proportionate body parts, though the exact details vary from

one individual to another. For example, a boggles nose

might be large and crooked, broad and flat, or nonexistent

except for nostril slits. Arms, legs, hands, feet, torso, and

abdomen vary from spindly to oversized but are almost

always misshapen. Skin color may be any shade from dark

gray to blackish-blue. A boggle can stretch and compress its

body and limbs to a remarkable degree, which accounts for

its impressive reach.

Boggles have their own rudimentary language of grunts

and whistles.

COMBAT

Boggles are a cowardly lot. They taunt, bluster, and scold in

their gibbering language, but always from a distance. If

they know intruders are approaching, they often use their

grease ability to make a section of floor slippery ahead of

time, so that they can easily steal baubles from anyone who

falls. When forced to fight, a boggle prefers to climb a wall

and leap down on prey from above, so that it can bring its

hind claws to bear for rending.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a boggle

hits an opponent of up to one size cate-

gory  larger  than  itself  with  a  claw

attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +5). If it hits

with both claws, it can also rend in the

same round. The boggle has the option to

conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use its claw to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the boggle

is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it

makes during successive rounds auto-

matically deals claw damage.

Dimension Door (Sp): A boggle can use

dimension door up to six times per day.

Caster level 7th.

Grease (Su): At will, a boggle can

secrete an oily, viscous, nonflammable

substance from its skin. This ability

functions like the spell grease except

that the range is touch, the dura-

tion is 1 round per Hit Die of

the boggle (4 rounds for the

typical  creature),  and  the

Reflex save DC is 12. Typi-

cally, a boggle uses this abil-

ity to grease a section of floor

or wall, though it can use the ability in any of the ways that

the spell can be used. This oily fluid also makes the boggle

tougher  to  hold  onto  (see  Skills,  below).  Boggles  are

immune to the effects of this substance.

Rend (Ex): If a boggle hits a single target with both claws,

it latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh. This

attack deals 2d4 points of damage.

Scent (Ex): A boggle can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: Because of its perpetually oily skin, a boggle gains

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always neutral (same as the

creator)

Advancement: 36 HD (Tiny)

A bogun is a small nature servant created by a

druid. Like a homunculus, it is an extension of

its creator. Thus, it has the same

alignment and link to nature

that its master has.

A  bogun  looks  like  a

vaguely humanoid mound

of compost. The creator

determines  its  precise

features, but the typical

version  stands  about  18

inches tall and has a wing-

span of about 2 feet. Its skin is

covered with nettles and branches.

Insect carapaces, feathers, scales,

and other forest detritus may also

be part of its form.

A bogun does not fight particularly

well, but it can perform any simple action, such as

attacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or window.

34

For the most part, the creature simply carries out its cre-

ators instructions. Because it is self-aware and somewhat

willful, however, its behavior is not entirely predictable.

On rare occasions (5% of the time), a bogun may refuse to

perform a particular task. In that case, the creator must

make a Diplomacy check (DC 11) to convince the creature

to cooperate. Success means the bogun performs the task

as requested; failure indicates that it either does exactly

the opposite or refuses to do anything at all for 24 hours

(DMs option).

A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one

links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its cre-

ator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees

and hears, up to a range of 1,500 feet. A bogun never travels

beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed

forcibly. In such a case, it does everything in its power to

regain contact with its creator.

Any attack that destroys a bogun deals its creator 2d10

points of damage. If the creator is slain, the bogun also dies,

and its body collapses into a heap of rotting vegetation.

COMBAT

A bogun has very little offensive capability, since its pri-

mary purpose is to carry out small tasks. Nevertheless, it is

capable of attacking, either on

the command of its creator or

in self-defense.

A  bogun  usually  tries  to  flee

from combat. If it is prevented from

escaping, it attacks by raking oppo-

nents with its poisonous nettles.

Poison (Ex): A boguns

nettles deliver an irritating

poison (Fortitude save DC 11)

with each successful attack. The

initial and secondary damage is

the same (1d6 points of Dexter-

ity  damage). The  creator  of  a

bogun is immune to its poison.

Construct Traits: A bogun is

immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, necromantic

effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works

on objects. The creature is not

subject to critical hits, subdual

damage, ability damage, ability

drain,  energy  drain,  or  death

from massive damage. Although

it is made of vegetable matter, a

bogun is not a plant and is there-

fore not subject to spells that

affect only plants or plant creatures. It

cannot heal itself but can be healed through

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:42 PM  Page 35

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A bogun has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

CONSTRUCTION

Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural mate-

rials available in any forest. Thus, there is no gold piece cost

for its creation. All materials used become permanent parts

of the bogun.

The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the

Craft Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before casting

any spells, the creator must weave a physical form out of

living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical

energy. A bit of the creators own body, such as a few strands

of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into

this crude mannequin. The creator may assemble the body

personally or hire someone else to do it. Creating the man-

nequin requires a Craft (basketweaving) or Craft (weaving)

check (DC 12).

Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it

through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to

complete. He or she must labor for at least 8 hours each day

in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from

another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is

personally weaving the creatures body, that process and the

ritual can be performed together.

When not actively working on the ritual, the creator

must rest and can perform no other activities except

eating, sleeping, or talking. Missing even one day causes

the process to fail. At that point, the ritual must be started

anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove

can be reused.

On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally

cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun (see below).

These spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls,

rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers.

A bone naga was once a living dark naga. After its death, it

was transformed into a skeletal undead creature by another

dark naga through a horrific ritual.

A bone naga looks like a 12-foot-long, serpentine

skeleton. Its skull bears an eerie resemblance to that of a

human, except that the bone naga sports long fangs that

can deliver a debilitating poison. A cold, cruel light

burns in the creatures eye sockets, giving it an air of

unspeakable hatred and malice. Its tail ends in a vicious

bone stinger which, like its teeth, delivers poison with

every hit.

Though it despises its servitude, a bone naga unswerv-

ingly obeys its creator, attacking even other nagas if so

commanded. Should its master die, a bone naga becomes

free-willed and can choose its own destiny.

COMBAT

Bone nagas under the control of masters are given explicit

instructions on how to deal with enemies. Beyond that,

these highly intelligent undead can make their own deci-

sions about methods for defeating particular foes.

A bone naga typically uses its mind-reading abilities to

determine its foes strengths and weaknesses before join-

ing combat. It often begins by trying to intimidate its

enemies with telepathic taunts. Thereafter, it resorts to

spellcasting to soften up the more powerful-looking

opponents before entering melee. A bone naga is likely to

focus its melee attacks on living opponents rather than

undead or constructs, since the living are susceptible to

its poison.

Poison (Ex): A bone naga delivers its poison via success-

ful bite or sting attacks. The poison from its bite (Fortitude

save DC 17) has the same initial and secondary damage (1d4

points of Strength damage). The poison from its sting (Forti-

tude save DC 17) is more virulent; its initial damage is 1d4

points of Constitution drain, and the secondary damage is

1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Spells: A bone naga casts spells as a 14th-level sorcerer

(spells known 9/5/5/4/4/3/2/1; spells/day 6/7/7/7/6/

6/5/3; save DC 13 + spell level).

Detect Thoughts (Su): A bone naga can continuously

detect the thoughts of those around it. This ability functions

like a detect thoughts spell (caster level 9th; Will save DC 15),

and it is always active.

Guarded Thoughts (Ex): Because of their ability to

shield their thoughts, bone nagas are immune to any form

of mind-reading.

Immunities (Ex): Bone nagas are immune to cold. Also,

because they lack flesh or internal organs, they take only

half damage from piercing weapons.

Telepathy (Su): A bone naga can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 250 feet that has a language.

Undead Traits:  A  bone  naga  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It

is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. A bone naga cannot be raised, and resurrection

works only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-

Bone oozes slide along underground, scavenging for bones.

These disgusting creatures are called rolling graveyards

because of all the bones suspended in their bodies.

A bone ooze appears as an immense, undulating mass of

goo the color of bleached bone. Jagged, bony protrusions jut

from the monsters mass here and there, and more bones in

various stages of digestion are suspended within its translu-

cent body. A bone ooze normally maintains a roughly spher-

ical shape, measuring more than 30 feet in diameter and

weighing more than 40,000 pounds, though it can alter its

shape to flow through a space as small as 5 feet by 5 feet.

Because the bones it contains give its amorphous shape

firmer support than the typical ooze has, it takes 1 round for

a bone ooze to squeeze through an opening too small for its

normal dimensions.

COMBAT

A bone ooze attacks by slamming opponents or by

rolling over them. It tries to engulf opponents

whenever possible, so that it can use its bone

meld.  A  bone  oozes  attacks  also  cause

bleeding wounds.

Ability Drain (Ex): A successful slam

attack from a bone ooze absorbs some of

the victims bone structure. Any melee hit

deals 1d6 Strength drain, 1d6 Dexterity

drain, and 1d6 Constitution drain. On a

critical hit, it drains twice that amount

from each affected score. A bone ooze

heals 5 points of damage it has taken (10

on a critical hit) whenever it drains abilities.

If the amount of healing is more than the damage the

creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit

points for 1 hour.

Bone Meld (Ex): Once per round, a bone ooze can attempt

to absorb the skeleton of an engulfed creature into its own

mass, pulling the bones out through the flesh. The victim

must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 35) or die. After

1d3 rounds, the bone ooze leaves behind the fleshy parts of

the victim and any treasure he or she carried.

Engulf (Ex): A bone ooze can simply bowl over Huge or

smaller creatures as a standard action. This attack affects as

many opponents as the creatures body can cover. Each

target can make either an attack of opportunity against the

bone ooze or a Reflex save (DC 35) to avoid being engulfed.

A successful saving throw indicates that the target has been

pushed back or aside (targets choice) as the ooze moves for-

ward. A bone ooze cannot make a slam attack during a

round in which it attempts to engulf, but each creature

engulfed is considered grappled and trapped within the

bone oozes body. Such a creature takes automatic slam, abil-

ity drain, and wounding damage upon being engulfed and

each succeeding round that it remains trapped. In the next

round after engulfing, the bone ooze can attempt a bone

meld attack.

Wounding (Ex): Because of the bone shards the crea-

tures body contains, a bone oozes slam or engulf attack

causes a wound that bleeds for 5 points of damage per round

thereafter, in addition to the attacks normal damage. Multi-

ple wounds from the creature result

in cumulative bleeding

loss (two wounds

10

for

JJ

points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be

stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 15) or the

application of a cure spell or some other healing spell (heal,

healing circle, or the like).

Blindsight (Ex): A bone ooze is blind, but blindsight

allows it to maneuver and fight as well as a sighted creature.

Through this ability, it can discern objects and creatures

within 60 feet. The bone ooze usually does not need to make

Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of

its blindsight.

Ooze Traits: A bone ooze is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.

It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

Braxats are violent, nocturnal hunters that

stalk mountainous and desert regions. These

dangerous, evil humanoids prey exclusively

on intelligent beings, whom they take

great pleasure in torturing, killing,

and eating. Their taste for humanoid

flesh can take them deep into civi-

lized lands, where prey is plentiful

and easy to catch.

A braxat is a hulking, bipedal, lizard-

like humanoid that towers over many giants

at its full adult height of 15 feet. Its features are a

B

X

T

37

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:42 PM  Page 38

combination of those of a rhinoceros and a spiny beetle. The

top of its head and its back are lined with thick, horn-

covered plates, and a single, massive horn juts up from

between its nostrils.

Braxats respect neither law nor authority, and they fear no

one. Their awesome strength, psionic abilities, and damage

reduction make them nearly unstoppable, and it is not

uncommon for a single band of them to wipe out several

humanoid settlements in the course of a year.

Occasionally a few survivors from braxat raids band

together and try to hunt the creatures down, but rarely do

they succeed in exacting vengeance. Experienced adven-

turers have been known to hunt braxats for sport,

pitting their experience and cleverness

against the creatures raw cunning and

psionic abilities. As such hunters

have discovered to their dismay,

braxats are quite proficient at pro-

tecting  themselves  with

deadly traps and ambushes.

Most such hunts end in vic-

tory for the braxats, but

now and then one is suc-

cessful,  yielding  a  few

braxat-horn trophies to

the hunters. These horns

have  no  value  in  them-

selves,  but  artists  some-

times carve intricate sculp-

tures on them and sell them

as art objects.

Braxats speak Giant, and a few

of  the  more  civilized  ones

make the effort to learn Com-

mon as well.

COMBAT

Braxats relish the hunt.

They delight in their vic-

tims fear and like to prolong the agony

of their prey by stalking it for long periods, using their

telepathy to create false hopes, and then crushing those

hopes with new ambushes. Alternatively, braxats may send

their victims telepathic taunts, detailing the grisly fate that

awaits them after capture.

In combat, braxats are cruel and cunning. They prefer to

soften up opponents with mind blasts and psionic assaults

before closing in for the kill. They usually save their breath

weapons for particularly stubborn foes. Once the oppo-

nents are damaged, the braxats wade into combat with

their greatclubs.

Breath Weapon (Su): A braxat can breathe a 30-foot-long

cone of cold for 3d8 points of cold damage (Reflex save DC

20 half ). Once it has used its breath weapon, the creature

must wait 1d4 rounds before it can do so again.

Mind Blast (Sp): This mind-numbing blast extends from

the braxat in a 30-foot-long cone. Anyone caught in the area

must succeed at a Will save (DC 15) or be stunned for 3d4

rounds. (When using the Psionics Handbook, replace this abil-

ity with the mind blast attack mode, as noted below.)

Psionics (Sp): At willdimension door, mind blank. Caster

(or manifester) level 8th; save DC 10 + spell level.

Attack/Defense Modes: mind thrust, mind blast/thought shield,

empty mind.

Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): At willblink; 1/day

confusion, feeblemind. Caster level 8th; save DC

10 + spell level.

Telepathy (Su): A braxat can

communicate telepathically with

any creature within one mile that

has a language.

BRAXAT SOCIETY

Braxats live in a tribal society in

which males and females have

equal social status and access

to leadership positions. Each

tribal leader must prove his or

her worthiness annually in a

ritual combat with a single

challenger who has earned

the right of contest through

successful  raiding  over  the

past year.

Young braxats are trained to

fight  from  the  time  they  can

stand. Deadly combat between

young  braxats  over  potential

mates, lairs, or treasure is encour-

aged to ensure that only the

strongest and cleverest sur-

vive to reproduce.

Once  a  young  braxat  is

deemed worthy to join a warband,

that group becomes his or her second family. Switching to

a different warband occurs only rarelyusually when

most  of  a  band  has  been  killed  in  battle.  Aggression

between bandmates is strictly forbidden, since coopera-

tion is vital to a successful hunt. Killing a bandmate is

punishable  by  the  immediate  execution  of  both  the

offender and his or her family.

BRAXAT CHARACTERS

Because of the braxats affinity for hunting, its favored

class is ranger, although some braxats prefer to take levels

in barbarian or fighter. Evil druid braxats are rare, but not

unknown.

A braxat PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to its

class level + 16. Thus, a 1st-level braxat ranger has an ECL of

17 and is the equivalent of a 17th-level character.

The breathdrinker is a dreadful elemental that feeds on air

extracted from the lungs of living creatures. How it actu-

ally derives sustenance from such a source is unknown,

but the cruel monster seems to take great delight in steal-

ing the breath of its helpless victims.

The breathdrinker is normally invisible, except when

attacking. When it does become visible, it roughly mimics

the  form  of  its  chosen  victim,  appearing  as  a  misty,

translucent duplicate. Its eyes resemble tiny, red spheres

of light.

Most breathdrinkers reside on the Elemental Plane of

Air. Occasionally, a breathdrinker summoned to the Mate-

rial Plane by a spellcaster for a specific task (most often the

slaying of a specific target) decides to stay on after com-

pleting the assignment. A creature that chooses this course

nearly always does so because it enjoyed its task and wishes

to continue bringing death and destruction.

Breathdrinkers speak Common and Auran.

COMBAT

A breathdrinker lurks invisibly most of the time, waiting

for prey to wander near. It normally selects a single crea-

ture as a victim, then spends some time stalking and

watching its quarry before deciding on the best method

of approach. Often, it simply waits for its chosen prey to

fall asleep before attempting to steal its breath. Alterna-

tively, it may first attempt to render the creature helpless

with its gaze attack, then follow up with its steal breath

attack. The breathdrinker is single-minded to a fault

once it selects a victim, it does not rest until it has fully

H



fed from that creatures lungs. Unless the breathdrinker

is killed, it persists with its breath-stealing attacks until

its chosen victim dies, then flees to digest its meal (a

process that usually takes several days) before setting out

to hunt again.

If  attacked  by  creatures  other  than  the  one  it  has

selected, the breathdrinker usually defends itself with a

wind scythea plane of pressurized air that it forms from

its own body. The creature does not use this attack against

its chosen victim, preferring to kill that creature entirely

through breath-stealing.

Fear Gaze (Su): Anyone within 30 feet of a breath-

drinker who meets the creatures glowing red eyes must

succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 16) or be paralyzed

with fear for 1d4 rounds.

Steal Breath (Su): As a full-round action, a breath-

drinker can attempt to suck the air from the lungs of any

helpless creature within reach. The target must make a

successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 17) or take 1d6

points of Constitution damage. The target dies when his or

her Constitution score reaches 0. The breathdrinker heals

5 points of damage for each point of Constitution the

target loses, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. So

long as the target remains helpless, the breathdrinker con-

tinues to use this attack against that creature every round

until it dies.

Air Mastery (Ex): Any airborne creature takes a 1

penalty on attack and damage rolls made against a breath-

drinker.

Elemental Traits (Ex): The breathdrinker is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to

critical hits or flanking, and it cannot be raised or resur-

rected. The creature also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Invisibility (Su): A breathdrinker can make itself

invisible at will as a free action. This ability functions like

an invisibility spell (caster level 8th), except that it lasts

until the breathdrinker ends the effect, either by choice or

by attacking.

First  seen  in

tropical  lands,

bronze  serpents

are golemlike guardians that resemble the

serpent gods whose temples they once

protected. Over the course of centuries,

the secret of the creatures con-

struction  has  spread  far

and wide, so now they

may appear anywhere.

A bronze serpent is a

20-foot-long snake built

of articulated bronze rings.

Its eyes glow blue-white, and its

powerful jaws are equipped with impressive fangs that drip

fat electrical sparks instead of venom.

A bronze serpent cannot speak, but it can understand

simple instructions in its creators language.

COMBAT

A bronze serpent usually concentrates its initial attacks on

the creatures that appear most vulnerable to its shocking

bite. Once it hits with that attack, it wraps its body around

the opponent, then continues biting while it constricts.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a

bronze serpent can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing

2d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a bronze serpent hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity (grapple bonus +27). If it gets a hold, it can

also constrict in the same round. Thereafter, the creature

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the bronze serpent is not considered grappled).

In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals bite and

constrict damage.

Shocking Bite (Su): A bronze serpents bite deals

1d8+16 points of electricity damage in addition to the

normal bite damage. The creature receives a +3 bonus on

attack rolls against any opponent that is made out of

metal, wearing metal armor, or carrying a a significant

amount of metal.

Construct Traits: A bronze serpent is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The creature

is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. It

cannot heal itself but can be healed through repair or

through its electric healing ability. It cannot be raised or res-

urrected. A bronze serpent has darkvision (60-foot range).

Electric Healing (Ex): Because of the bronze serpents

electrical affinity, any electricity attack directed at it cures 1

point of damage for each 3 points of damage it would other-

wise deal. The creature gets no saving throw against electric-

ity effects.

CONSTRUCTION

A bronze serpents body is constructed from 1,000 pounds

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:43 PM  Page 41

of bronze. The creator must be at least 16th level and able to

cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 4,000 XP

from the creator and requires the spells geas/quest, limited

wish, polymorph any object, and shocking grasp.

The serpent costs 200,000 gp to create, including 1,500 gp

for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful

Craft (armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check

(DC 25).

The catoblepas is a bizarre, loathsome creature that inhab-

its dismal swamps and marshes. It is thought to be the

result of a magical experiment gone terribly

wrong. Though it hunts for meat only occa-

sionally, the creatures

deadly nature is

legendary.

The body of a

catoblepas  re-

sembles that of

a bloated buffalo, and its

legs are stumpy, like those of

a pygmy elephant or a hippo-

potamus.  Its  muscular  tail,

which it can move with blind-

ing speed, ends in a chitinous

knob. The head is perched upon

a long, weak neck that can barely sup-

port its weight, so the creature tends to

hold its head very low to the ground. The face looks like

that of a warthog, but uglier.

Catoblepases mate for life, and when more than one is

encountered, the group is either a mated pair or (10%

chance) a family consisting of a mated pair with a single off-

spring. The juvenile catoblepas in such a group has 3d8+15

HD (28 hp) and does not fight, nor does it have any of the

adult creatures special attacks.

Catoblepases do not collect treasure. Any valuables in

their vicinity are there because previous victims dropped

them. The creatures lair is usually an area that offers both

shelter and firm ground, hidden by by tall reeds or marsh

grasses that the catolepas is canny enough not to consume.

An adult catoblepas has little to fear from other marsh

denizens, but its young are vulnerable to predators.

COMBAT

Normally, the catoblepas is a meandering grazer, wandering

the marsh in search of the most succulent grasses and

weeds. But once a month, usually under the light of a full

moon, it hunts for meat to round out its diet of reeds and

grasses. Usually it dines on easy prey such as fish, marsh

birds, eels, rats, large amphibians, snakes, and other marsh

animals during this period, but it is willing to hunt larger

creatures if necessary.

The creature makes full use of its reach when attacking

with its tail, and it never tries to engage more than one

enemy at a time. It usually reserves its death ray attack

for self-defense. A pair of catoblepases try to flank a

single target and slay it before moving on to another.

Death Ray (Su): The catoblepas can project a thin,

green ray up to 160 feet from its bloodshot eyes. Any

living creature struck by this ray must make a Fortitude

save (DC 18) or die instantly. Even on a success, the target

takes 5d6 points of damage. After striking one target, the

ray dissipates, and the attack cannot be used again for

1d4 rounds.

Stun (Ex): Any living creature struck by the catoblepass

tail must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or be stunned

for 1 round. (A stunned character can-

not act and loses any Dexterity bonus

to Armor Class. An

attacker  gets  a  +2  bonus  on

attack rolls against a stunned opponent.)

Success indicates that the target takes only the normal

damage for the attack.

LGW

Scent (Ex): A catoblepas can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

CELESTIAL

The Outer Planes that celestials call home foster a variety

of good creatures. The goodness of celestials is of a quality

and intensity that makes many a paladin feel diminished

and inadequate.

resistance 20. In addition, a celestial has low-light vision and

a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison.

Outsider Traits: A celestial has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised

or resurrected.

Evil creatures in gen-

eral and fiends in par-

ticular  are  anath-

ema to celestials.

They  may  not

spend  all  their

waking hours root-

ing out tanarri and

baatezu from every

corner of the multi-

verse, but when con-

fronted by fiends

of  any  sort,  they

seldom back down.

Celestials are often

involved  in  pro-

longed wars against

fiends of various

types,  and  ar-

mies  of  celes-

tials occasion-

ally  take  the

battle to their

e n e m i e s .

Though ce-

lestials  are

generally peace-

loving creatures, they

are also terrible foes.

All celestials have comely looks, though their actual

appearances vary widely. Guardinals, the type presented here,

tend to have both humanoid and animal characteristics.

Celestials speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic.

COMBAT

Most celestials are armed with a variety of nonlethal

attacks and special abilities, which they reserve primarily

for those rare occasions when they must fight or subdue

good beings. Against creatures of evil or beings who have

somehow aroused their wrath, celestials are willing to

unleash the full measure of their lethal, otherworldly pow-

ers. Most celestials have excellent skills in melee as well,

and they do not hesitate to take on their foes hand-to-

hand. For creatures that dislike killing, they are exception-

ally good at it.

All celestials have the following characteristics.

Celestial Traits: A celestial can speak with any creature

that has a language as though using a tongues spell (caster

level 14th; always active). It is immune to electricity and

petrification attacks, and it has acid resistance 20 and cold

GUARDINALS

The guardinals are

the people of Ely-

sium,  just  as  de-

mons (tanarri) are

the  people  of  the

Abyss. Most guardi-

nals resemble beauti-

ful,  muscular  humans

with noticeable animal-

like traits.

Guardinals arent

numerous. In Ely-

sium, they tend to

live in small groups,

watching their home

plane  for  any  sign  of

trouble while roaming its

breathtaking land-

scape  in  nomadic

bands. They live sim-

ply, taking only what

they require from

the land.

Guardinals

have  no  toler-

ance for evil or

injustice. Most of those that leave Elysium do so to seek out

and address such wrongs. Thus, it is rare to find a guardinal

roaming the planes for pleasure.

CERVIDAL

The most common of the guardinals of Elysium are the

satyrlike cervidals. Their home, Amoria, is the uppermost

layer of that plane. Cervidals take their guardianship of

Amoria serioiusly and are rarely found elsewhere except in

times of great need.

A cervidals body is slim, muscular, and covered with

short, dark red fur. Aside from its regal bearing, the crea-

tures most striking feature is the pair of long, curved horns

atop its head. A cervidal has hooves instead of feet, but its

hands are like a humans, except that the backs are protected

by hard plates of horn. This allows it to use its hands as

punching weapons to deliver effective slam attacks.

Cervidals are peaceful and slow to anger, but in times of

need they form the bulk of any guardinal army. One on one,

a cervidal is a match for any comparable baatezu or tanarri,

but cervidals seldom have the luxury of fighting an equal

number of opponents.

Combat

A cervidals horns are its favored weapon. It usually begins a

fight by charging. Thereafter, it uses its slam and butt attacks

to advantage in melee.

Charge (Ex): A cervidal can lower its head and charge an

opponent, striking with its deadly horns. In addition to the

normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this tactic allows

the cervidal to make a single butt attack that deals 1d8+6

points of damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willbless, command, detect

poison, light; 1/dayhold person, magic missile, suggestion.

Caster level 9th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Horn Powers (Su): A cervidal can deliver any of several

effects by a touch of its horns. The horns can negate any

poison or disease (as the spells neutralize poison and remove dis-

ease) in the creature touched, dispel an illusion (as a targeted

dispel magic spell, except that it affects only spells of the Illu-

sion school and is automatically successful), or dismiss (as a

dismissal spell) a summoned, conjured, or extraplanar creature.

Each of these horn powers can be used at will as a standard

action. Except as noted, all these abilities function as the cor-

responding spells. Caster level 20th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Skills: Because of its powerful legs, a cervidal gains a +8

racial bonus on Jump checks.

LUPINAL

As the name implies, lupinals are half-human, half-wolf

creatures. They are constantly on the prowl for evil intru-

sions into their territory, be it Elysium or a piece of the

Material Plane that they have made their own. Lupinals are

more likely than cervidals to make their homes outside

Elysium and assist other beings in repelling evil incursions.

Perhaps because of their pack-based society, lupinals are

more lawful than other natives of Elysium. In group activi-

ties, they operate in close cooperation and perfect harmony.

Even solitary lupinals are rarely more than an hour away

from allies (or even closer, via ethereal jaunt).

At first glance, a lupinal might be mistaken for a were-

wolf, with its long muzzle, fur, and backward-bending

canine legs. But where lycanthropes are savage and animal-

like, lupinals are intelligent, regal, and poisedthough they

are quick to anger and ferocious when aroused.

Combat

Lupinals are exceptionally skilled in combat. They use pack

tactics (such as surrounding opponents, chasing down ene-

mies, and the aid another action) with great skill. Their

approach often involves ambush, deception, and misdirec-

tion as well.

Fear Aura (Ex): When a lupinal howls, every creature

within 600 feet (except other celestials) who can hear it must

make a Will saving throw (DC 16). On a failure, a creature

with 7 or fewer Hit Dice becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds;

one with 8 or more Hit Dice becomes shaken for 4d6

Creations of the diabolical kytons (see the Monster Manual),

chain  golems  serve  as  bodyguards  for  devils  and  as

guardians of unholy places. Occasionally, one of these

creatures is selected to carry out a special mission. When a

chain golem appears on the Material Plane, it is usually

delivering or retrieving a message or an item of particular

interest to its kyton master.

The body of a chain golem is composed entirely of shift-

ing  chains  that  vary  in  size  and  shape,  ranging  from

extremely thin and razor-sharp to thick and mounted with

barbs,  spikes,  and  blades.  A  chain  golem  clanks  and

screeches continually as its chains slide around its body.

Because it has a mostly humanoid shape, it is often mistaken

for a kyton.

A chain golem always obeys its masters commands to

the letter, sacrificing itself in the execution of its duties if

necessary. Should a chain golems master die, the creature

immediately becomes the servant of another kyton.

COMBAT

A chain golem typically uses its long reach to grab at foes

and knock them to the ground. Then it activates its vicious

chain barrier to shred the fallen creatures flesh.

Chain Barrier (Ex): As a full-round action, a chain

golem can surround itself with a whirling, slicing shield

of chains, similar in effect to a

blade barrier spell. Any-

one adjacent to

a chain barrier

must make a

successful

Reflex save

(DC 17) or

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:43 PM  Page 44

rounds. Success leaves the creature unaffected. Once a crea-

ture has either been affected by this ability or made a suc-

cessful save, it cannot be affected by that lupinals howl

again for 24 hours.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a lupinal hits an opponent that

is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite

attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +14). The creature has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the lupinal is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals bite damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblink, blur, change self, dark-

ness, ethereal jaunt; 3/daycone of cold, cure light wounds, fly,

magic missile. Caster level 8th; save DC 12 + spell level.

Trip (Ex): A lupinal that hits with a bite attack can

attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (see Trip in

Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook) without making a touch

attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt

fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the lupinal.

Dodge Missiles (Ex): This ability operates like the

Deflect Arrows feat, except that the lupinal can dodge any

missile and it need not have its hands free. (The creature is

dodging, not deflecting.) This ability is usable three times

per round.

Scent (Ex): A lupinal can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

take 7d6 points of damage. Any creature or object entering

or passing through such a barrier automatically takes that

amount of damage. The chain barrier moves with the

golem and serves as one-half cover for it (+4 bonus to AC).

Maintaining the barrier once it has been activated is a

standard action.

Wounding (Ex): A wound resulting from a chain golems

chain rake attack bleeds for an additional 2 points of damage

per round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks

result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 4 points

of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be

stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 10) or the

application of a cure spell or some other healing spell (heal,

healing circle, or the like).

Construct Traits: A chain golem is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The

creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, abil-

ity damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from mas-

sive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A chain golem has

darkvision (60-foot range).

Magic Immunity (Ex): A chain golem is immune to

all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects

except as follows. An electricity

effect slows it (as the slow

spell) for 2 rounds (no

saving throw). A fire

effect breaks any slow

effect  on  the  chain

golem and cures 1 point

of damage for each 2 points

of damage it would otherwise

deal. A chain golem gets no saving

throw against fire effects.

Resistance to

Ranged At-

tacks (Su): A

chain golem gains a

+2  resistance  bonus  on  saving  throws

against  ranged  spells  or  ranged  magical

attacks that specifically target it (except

ranged touch attacks).

AW

CONSTRUCTION

Kytons are the only beings known to be capable of creating

chain golems, and they go to great lengths to keep the

method of construction a secret from all other creatures

including other devils. Should another creature either

develop or acquire the method of chain golem creation, the

kytons would spare no effort to assassinate that individual

before he or she could spread the knowledge further.

Almost too

big to be be-

lieved, chaos

rocs  are  im-

mense  birds  of

prey known for carry-

ing  off  large  animals

(such as cattle, horses, or

even  elephants).  These

enormous birds lair

in huge nests

made  from

whole trees.

They  pre-

fer to dwell

high in the

mountains,

far from other

large creatures such

as rocs, dragons, and even other chaos rocs. This tactic

ensures that the food supply in any one area is not compro-

mised too severely. Each chaos roc usually hunts within a

radius of about 10 miles around its own nest.

A chaos roc resembles a large eagle covered from head to

tail with brilliant, shimmering plumage in rainbow hues.

The creature measures 90 feet long from beak to tail, and its

wingspan can be as wide as 240 feet.

COMBAT

Chaos rocs prefer to attack on the wing, using their prismatic

spray ability to blind prey before attempting to snatch it up.

45

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:43 PM  Page 46

Any additional damage done by the spray effect simply

makes the snatch attempt easier.

Prismatic Spray (Su): A chaos roc can emit a spray of col-

ored light from its eyes at will. The effect is like that of the

spell (caster level 20th; save DC 27), except that the range is

105 feet, and only the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue,

and indigo are present (roll 1d6 instead of 1d8 on the table

given for prismatic spray in the Players Handbook).

Swallow  Whole  (Ex): A  chaos  roc  can  swallow  a

snatched opponent that is Huge or smaller by making a suc-

cessful grapple check (grapple bonus +65). Once inside the

roc, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning

damage and 1d8 points of acid damage per round from the

birds gizzard. A successful grapple check allows the swal-

lowed creature to climb out of the gizzard and return to the

rocs beak, where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can

try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or

slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the

gizzard (AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough

to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits,

muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed

opponent must cut its own way out. A chaos rocs gizzard

can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or

smaller creatures.

Feats: A creature that is flung by a chaos roc after being

snatched travels 100 feet and takes 10d6 points of damage. If

the chaos roc is flying, the creature takes this damage or the

appropriate falling damage, whichever is greater.

Cloaked apes inhabit the deep forests of tropical and sub-

tropical lands, where they glide through the treetops in

search of food. These diurnal foragers subsist primarily on a

diet of fruit and nuts, though they do occasionally eat small

animals that they manage to ambush from above.

The cloaked ape is named for the flaps of skin that

stretch from its wrists to its ankles. When not extended for

gliding through the treetops, these skin flaps resemble the

folds of a cloak.

COMBAT

Cloaked apes are territorial, but they rarely attack unless

they significantly outnumber the intruders. Otherwise they

stay in the treetops, hooting and hurling loose branches and

half-eaten fruit, berries, and nuts at their foes.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a cloaked ape hits an opponent

that is its own size or smaller with both claw attacks, it deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus

+4). The creature has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its claws to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the cloaked ape is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check

it makes during successive rounds automatically deals

damage for two claw attacks.

Fast Healing (Ex): A

cloaked ape regains lost

hit points at the rate of 3

per round. Fast healing does

not restore hit points lost from

starvation, thirst, or suffoca-

tion,  and  it  does  not

allow the cloaked ape

to regrow or reattach

lost body parts.

Scent (Ex): A cloaked

ape  can  detect  ap-

proaching enemies,

sniff out hid-

den foes, and

track by sense

of smell.

Clockwork horrors are intelligent, arachnidlike con-

structs that live as a hierarchical collective. They exist

solely to strip entire worlds of worked and raw metals,

which they use to produce more horrors. These activities

take clockwork horrors into areas where metal can be

found, from underground mines to civilized areas where

processed metal is often readily available. Clockwork hor-

rors ignore nonmechanical creatures unless such beings

47

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:43 PM  Page 48

pose a threat or obviously possess metal. The horrors

searches are methodical and efficient, resulting in the

destruction of nearly everything in their path. An

army of horrors can devastate an entire nation in a

matter of weeks.

A  clockwork  horror  ap-

pears  as  a  four-legged,

mechanical arachnid

with a body about

2 feet in diame-

ter.  It  is  made  of  a

base  metal  (such

as iron) overlaid

with  a  thin  pa-

tina of precious

or semiprecious

metal.  A  large

gem  is  embedded

in the creatures

brow.  A  single

razor saw is situ-

ated near the front

of its head where

a mouth would

normally be lo-

cated. The more

powerful  clock-

work  horrors  are

more  fantastically  de-

signed and decorated than the

lesser ones. Servant clockwork horrors with overlays of less

precious metals are known to exist, but these serve the hier-

archy primarily as laborers.

Clockwork horrors communicate in their own language

of mechanical sounds. The linked mind that they share

allows for instant communication among individual horrors

within 10 miles of each other.

Logic indicates that since the horrors are mechanical

beings, someone or something must have created them.

What happened to that being is unknown. Some sages theo-

rize that the adamantine horror rebelled against and slew its

creator, then devised the other types of clockwork horrors

to serve as its armies.

COMBAT

Clockwork horrors attack their foes with calculated, mer-

ciless precision. Lesser horrors unswervingly follow the

orders of their superiors, fighting to the death if so com-

manded. In battle, clockwork horrors swarm around foes

and whittle away at them while calling for reinforce-

ments. A clockwork horrors weaponry is a part of its

being, so it cannot be disarmed. When it dies, the gem in

its brow disintegrates, and its body fuses into a mass of

melted metal.

All clockwork horrors share the following qualities.

Construct Traits: A clockwork horror is immune to

mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any

effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it

also works on objects. The crea-

ture  is  not  subject  to  critical

hits,  subdual  damage,  ability

damage, ability drain, en-

ergy  drain,  or  death

from massive damage.

It  cannot  heal  it-

self  but  can  be

healed through

repair.  It  cannot  be

raised or resurrected.

A  clockwork  hor-

ror has darkvision

(60-foot range).

Linked Mind (Ex):

All clockwork horrors

within  10  miles  of  a

gold, platinum, or

adamantine horror

are in constant com-

munication.  If  one  is

aware of a particular dan-

ger, they all are. If one in a par-

ticular group is not flat-footed,

none of them are. No clockwork horror

in such a group is considered flanked un-

less they all are.

Spell Vulnerability (Ex): A clockwork horror is suscep-

tible to the shatter spell, which blinds it for 1d4+1 rounds.

ELECTRUM HORROR

Electrum horrors are the shock troops of the clockwork

horror collective. They are sent in to scout out areas, assess

potential resistance, and overcome any opposition.

Combat

Electrum horrors advance into combat in precise battle

lines, with the individual horrors spaced about 10 feet apart.

They open fire with volleys of pressure darts. Upon closing

with the enemy, some continue firing darts at perceived

spellcasters or opponents using ranged weapons, while

others slice away at nearby foes with their razor-sharp saws.

After a battle, additional electrum horrors scavenge the

area, retrieving fallen companions and any abandoned

weapons for smelting down and making new horrors.

GOLD HORROR

Gold  horrors  are  the  commanders  of  the  clockwork

horror armies. They supervise the electrums and other

lesser horrors, ensuring that the orders of their superiors

are obeyed.

Gold horrors fight from behind a line of electrum guards,

shooting lightning bolts at their foes. In melee, a gold horror

strikes at an enemys weapon to destroy it. Against magic

Lightning Bolt (Sp): Once every 2 rounds, the monster can

generate a lightning bolt 5 feet wide and 40 feet long that

deals 6d6 points of damage. A successful Reflex save (DC 13)

halves the damage.

PLATINUM HORROR

Platinum horrors are the generals and governors of all the

lesser clockwork horrors. It is they who identify targets,

devise strategies, and decide how best to deploy other hor-

rors to achieve their goals.

Against magic weapons and items, a platinum horrors razor

saw functions as a +3 weapon.

Lightning Bolt (Sp): A platinum horrors lightning bolt abil-

ity produces more powerful lightning bolts than the gold

horror can emit. Once every 2 rounds, the platinum horror

can fire a lightning bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet long, dealing

12d6 points of electricity damage. A successful Reflex save

(DC 15) halves the damage.

ADAMANTINE

An adamantine horror is the supreme leader of the entire

clockwork horror collective. Only one is believed to

exist.

The adamantine horror directs the harvesting of metal

and the creation of new horrors. It alone decides which

new horrors to make; thus it controls the composition of the

collective. The adamantine horror holds the secret of ani-

mating a newly built horror body.

The adamantine horrors motives in its aggressive cam-

paign to grow the collective are unknown. Some sages

speculate that it strives to destroy rival cultures; others

claim it has acquired a living things drive to reproduce.

Whatever its motives, the creature is a master at destroy-

ing other civilizations.

Combat

An adamantine horror devastates foes with its spell-like

Cloud rays are among the most majestic of all flying crea-

tures. They do not truly fly; instead, they levitate while pro-

pelling themselves with their wing-flaps.

A cloud ray has an enormous, flattened, triangular body

that resembles that of an aquatic ray, but on an immensely

larger scale. Its vast body is mottled in shades of dark blue

and gray, with similar, lighter colors underneath. Along

each side of its body is a long, wing-shaped piece of muscu-

lar tissue, which it uses for maneuvering and propulsion.

Its abdomen tapers into a long, agile tail, called a zip, which

is covered with bony spines.

With the possible exception of dragons, cloud rays have

no known predators. They typically prey on rocs, pegasi,

manticores, hippogriffs, griffons, and other large flying crea-

tures. Cloud rays do not deliberately seek out human prey,

but they have been known to devour whole villages when

the opportunities presented themselves.

COMBAT

Most often, a cloud ray attacks simply because it is hungry. It

dives on its prey and tries to snatch it up in its 20-foot-wide

mouth, then flies off to swallow it.

In melee, a cloud ray can use its Snatch feat, or it can slap a

foe with its tail. When it does the latter, the tail moves so fast

that it creates a thundrous sound, like the crack of a whip.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A cloud ray can swallow a snatched

opponent that is Huge or smaller by making a successful

grapple check (grapple bonus +61). The cloud ray, however,

has no appreciable stomach. Instead it has a long throat, the

whole length of which is equipped with teeth for grinding

the effect cannot be dispelled and it does not discharge after

absorbing a certain amount of damage.

Telekinesis (Su): Lacking any sort of hands or paws, the

cloud ray instead uses telekinesis to manipulate objects.

This ability works like the telekinesis spell (caster level 5th),

so the creature can lift or throw 125 pounds.

Skills: Thanks to its coloration, a cloud ray has a +16 racial

bonus on Hide checks. *When it tires of drifting through

the sky, it settles to the ground for rest. Through a combina-

tion of telekinesis and moving its great wing-flaps, it covers

itself with dust, dirt, rocks, logs, uprooted bushes, and what-

ever else is nearby. While it is thus camouflaged, its Hide

modifier rises to +32. The ray may rest on the ground thus

covered for a few hours or a few weeks.

Feats: A creature that is flung by a cloud ray after being

snatched travels 100 feet and takes 10d6 points of damage. If

the cloud ray is flying, the creature takes this damage or the

appropriate falling damage, whichever is greater.

Corollaxes are mischievous and curious insectivores that

dwell in dense jungles in tropical and subtropical climates.

They typically nest in large colonies that span several

closely placed trees.

These colorful creatures are very curious and quite social.

They can provide the unknowing traveler with a great deal

of companionship and amusementat least until startled.

At that point, their natural defensive reaction erupts, and

chaos usually ensues.

A corollax has a gray-black, curved beak and black eyes.

Its plumage varies in color, but a typical males feathers are

and tearing food. Its throat empties directly into its intestines,

so the ray must chew its food thoroughly to ensure proper

digestion. Once inside the rays throat, the opponent takes

3d10+22 points of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing

damage per round from its teeth and muscular contractions.

A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to

climb out of the throat and return to the rays mouth, where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alter-

natively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with

either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at

least 25 points of damage to the throat (AC 20) in this way

creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a

single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the

hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own

way out. A cloud rays throat can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32

Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.

Levitate (Ex): The cloud ray controls its altitude by gen-

erating and manipulating lighter-than-air gases inside its

body. This ability enables it to ascend 20 feet per round or,

by neutralizing the levitating gases and letting gravity take

its course, descend as much as 500 feet per round. In spite

of its immense bulk, the ray can pull out of such a dive

instantly simply by levitating again.

Protection from Arrows (Su): This ability allows a cloud

ray to resist most ranged attacks. It works like a protection

from arrows spell (DR 10/+2 against projectiles), except that

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:44 PM  Page 51

a mixture of bright red, orange, and yellow, and a females

are either brown or gray.

TRAINING A COROLLAX

A corollax can be trained with a successful Handle Animal

check (DC 23) to accept a particular creature (not necessar-

ily the one who made the check) as a member of its flock.

Any bird so trained does not use its color spray attack

against the designated individual.

These birds are also natural mimics. With a successful

Handle Animal check (DC 23), a corollax can be trained to

repeat a particular phrase. Each bird is capable of remember-

ing up to nine different phrases, though each phrase requires

a separate Handle Animal check. The birds dont seem to com-

prehend what they say, however, and many humanoids later

come to regret teaching the precocious mimics to talkpar-

ticularly when they cant get the creatures to shut up.

COROLLAX COMPANIONS

Because it is a social creature, a corollax can sometimes be per-

suaded to accept humanoid companionship on a long-term

basis. If a character offers food and makes a successful Handle

Animal check (DC 25 if

the  character  has  not

previously frightened or

abused the bird, or DC

30 otherwise), the corollax

considers the character a

desirable companion and

accompanies him or her

willingly in all travels. A

corollax adopted in this

manner refuses to leave

the characters side so

long as food, grooming,

and lots of attention are pro-

vided. A well-treated corollax

makes every effort to rejoin its com-

panion if forcibly separated, and the

companion receives a +2 circumstance

bonus on all subsequent Handle Animal

checks involving the bird. If the corollax is mis-

treated, it leaves and attempts to find its own way home.

COMBAT

Corollaxes are not aggressive and do not attack unless

someone attacks or harasses them first. If disturbed, a

corollax screeches and flies about, unleashing its color

spray attack. If forced into melee, the bird combines both

claws into a single attack.

Color Spray (Su): Once per round, a corollax can unleash

a vivid cone of clashing colors. This ability works like a color

spray spell (caster level 1st; save DC 13). The creature is

immune to its own color spray attack and to those of others

of its kind.

A corpse gatherer is an animated grave-

yard empowered by a mean intelli-

gence and a greed for more bodies.

It exists only to increase its own

size and power by devouring

more dead bodies. It seeks

corpses  everywhere,  from

cemeteries to battlefields to

scenes  of  natural  disasters.

A corpse gatherer appears

roughly  humanoid,  but  its

immense body is made up of

corpses, tombstones, and

grave earth. From a dis-

tance, the creature resembles

a  hulking  giant  made  of

earth and stones, but upon

closer inspection, a viewer can detect the occasional dead

hand, head, or other appendage protruding from its form.

These creatures are thought to spawn from the burial of

a sentient undead creature (such as a vampire) in uncon-

secrated ground. The lingering taint of undeath somehow

permeates the earth, causing the entire graveyard

corpses, tombstones, and allto coalesce into a ravening

undead monster.

Corpse gatherers feast upon dead flesh, but they are

more than willing to create fresh corpses by slaying living

creatures. A single corpse gatherer has been known to

destroy several entire villages to sate its unceasing hunger.

Though corpse gatherers are not themselves evil, their

undead taint extends to any living prey they devour. The

soul of a creature consumed by a corpse gatherer is trapped

within the latters body along with its corpse. Thus, the soul

cannot escape (so the creature cannot be raised or resur-

rected) until the corpse gatherer itself is destroyed.

COMBAT

A corpse gatherer fights by attempting to pound its oppo-

nents into mush. From time to time, it also grabs troublesome

opponents and stuffs them into its porous body (see Swallow

Whole, below). Those so absorbed are grasped and held fast

by the hands of the corpses that make up the gatherer.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a corpse gath-

erer hits an opponent its own size

or smaller with a slam attack, it

deals normal damage and at-

tempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +39). If it gets a hold, it

can try to swallow the oppo-

nent in the next round. Alter-

natively, the corpse gatherer has

the option to conduct the grap-

ple normally, or simply use its

hand to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but

the corpse gatherer is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case,

its next successful grapple check

deals  automatic  slam  damage.

Ingest  Corpses  (Su): The

corpse gatherer increases its hit

points  by  adding  bodies  to  its

form. It gains 5 hit points for every

corpse of a swallowed creature

that it absorbs. The corpse gath-

erer  can  exceed  its  normal  hit

points in this manner, gaining any

excess as temporary hit points. Opponents

the creature has swallowed are not subject to inges-

tion until the round after they die.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A corpse gatherer can swallow a

grabbed opponent that is at least one size category smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +39). The creature need not use its mouth to swallow;

it can merely stuff the opponent into any convenient por-

tion of its porous body. Once inside the gatherer, the oppo-

nent takes 1d12+12 points of bludgeoning damage per round

from the roiling corpses, gravestones, and other objects

inside the creatures body. A successful grapple check allows

the swallowed creature to extract itself from the hands of

the corpses inside the gatherer and return to the surface of

the gatherers body, where another successful grapple check

is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can

try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or

slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the

corpse gatherer (AC 20) in this way creates an opening large

enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature

exits, the other nearby corpses close the hole; thus, another

swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargan-

tuan corpse gatherer can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-

size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.

Desanctifying Aura (Su): A corpse gatherer projects a

continual field of negative energy in a 100-foot-radius ema-

nation. The area within this field is under the effect of a

double-strength desecrate spell (caster level 15th), as if the

corpse gatherer were a permanent feature dedi-

cated to its own deity. Each turn-

ing attempt within this area has

a 6 profane penalty. Further,

each undead creature in the area

(including the corpse gatherer) is

entitled to a +2 profane bonus on

its attack rolls, damage rolls and

saving throws, as well as +2 hit

points per HD. This aura lasts for 24

hours after the corpse gatherer has

passed through.

Soul Binding (Su): Creatures

slain and ingested by a corpse gath-

erer are affected as if by a soul bind

spell, so they cannot be restored to

life. Destroying the corpse gatherer

negates this effect. Corpses that

the creature devours without

having slain them itself are not

subject to soul binding.

Undead Traits: A corpse

gatherer  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paraly-

sis,  stunning,  disease,  death  effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works

on objects. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual

damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death

from massive damage. A corpse gatherer cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. The creature has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

Zombie-Spawn (Su): Upon reaching 0 hit points, the

corpse gatherer falls apart into its component corpses. The

creatures animating force remains among the corpses that

formerly composed its body, converting them into zombies.

Upon its death, a corpse gatherer generates as many zombies

as it has Hit Dice (that is, a 30-HD corpse-gatherer becomes

thirty zombies). Unless circumstances dictate otherwise,

these are all Medium-size zombies. They function normally as

long as they remain in the desanctified area of the dead corpse

gatherer, but outside its effect they revert to normal corpses.

A  crimson  death  is  a

vaporous  creature  that

lives in marshes, on moors,

or any place that is subject to

frequent, thick fogs. To con-

ceal its presence from the

general populace, a crimson

death  usually  carries  the

bodies of its victims back to its

lair, which is a charnel-house

piled with the corpses and treasure

of its victims.

A crimson death resembles a

knot of fog with a vaguely hu-

manoid shape, including arms and a

torso. Its lower body trails off into

indistinct vapor. The creatures eyes glow

white, but it has no other facial features. After it

has fed, the blood of its victims stains its misty

body red.

COMBAT

A crimson deaths attack consists of extending a vaporous ten-

dril and wrapping it around its opponent. The creature prefers

to attack from ambush, and it avoids physically powerful tar-

gets that might easily break free of its grasp.

Blood Drain (Ex): A crimson death drains blood, dealing

1d4 points of Constitution damage immediately upon seizing

an opponent with a tendril. Each round thereafter that the

opponent remains seized, the creature automatically deals

an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The crim-

son death craves blood, so it usually presses its attack until it

can deal at least 12 points of Constitution damage.

Seize (Ex): When a crimson death makes a successful

incorporeal touch attack, one of its tendrils wraps around

the opponent. The two creatures are not considered grap-

pled, but the opponent can break free with a successful

Escape Artist or grapple check (grapple bonus +11). Upon

seizing an opponent, the crimson death begins draining

blood (see above).

Incorporeal Subtype: A crimson death can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abili-

ties. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch weapons. A crimson death

can pass through solid objects, but not

force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore

natural armor, armor, and shields, but

deflection bonuses and force effects

work  normally  against  them.  A

crimson  death  always  moves

silently  and  cannot  be  heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt

wish to be.

Lift (Sp): As a free action,

a crimson death can teleki-

netically lift another creature

or an object weighing up to

300 pounds. This ability works

like the telekinesis spell (sustained

force version, caster level 12th),

except that it works only on an

opponent already seized by a ten-

dril of the crimson death. Against a

struggling opponent, use of this abil-

ity requires a successful grapple

check (grapple bonus +11).

Undead Traits: A crimson death

is immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and

any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not

subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. A crimson death cannot be raised, and resurrec-

tion works only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision

(60-foot range).

JJ

Skills: *A crimson deaths misty form makes it difficult to

spot in fog. Before feeding, the creature receives a +8 bonus

on Hide checks in smoky or foggy areas. After it has fed, the

bonus drops to +4 because of its red coloration.

The darktentacles is a justly feared swamp

monster. Both intelligent and malicious,

it often leaves treasure from previ-

ous victims scattered about

to attract new prey. The

creature can flatten its

squishy body across

the ground so as to

be inconspicuous,

and it usually hides

in or near water.

A darktentacles

resembles an octo-

pus  with  thirty-six

tentacles, each of which

can be up to 20 feet long.

Instead of suction cups, each of its

tentacles is lined with eyes. The creature uses some tentacles

for  movement  and  others  for  combat,  striking  with

whichever tentacles are convenient.

This creature is capable of wielding weapons in its ten-

tacles, and it often does so. It has no innate sense for

magic items, but it tends to select the most effective

weapons at its disposal. Because it hides so well, many

characters have no idea that a darktentacles is present

until abandoned weapons fly up from the ground and begin

attacking them.

A darktentacles speaks Common and Aquan.

COMBAT

When creatures approach, a darktentacles typically uses its

charm monster and hold monster powers first, concentrating

these attacks on foes who seem to be physically powerful.

Thereafter, it attacks anyone who comes within reach of its

tentacles. If the darktentacles manages to grab someone, it

uses its wall of force ability to keep any other opponents from

lending the victim assistance.

A darktentacles can use only three tentacles at once

against a Small or Medium-size opponent. Against a larger

foe, it can use three additional tentacles for each extra 5 feet

of face the opponent has, provided that it has the reach.

Against a Tiny or smaller opponent, the creature can use

only one tentacle. It can use a maximum of three tentacles

against all foes in any single 5-foot by 5-foot area.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a dark-

tentacles can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 2d6+6

points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a darktentacles hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +30; includes a +16 racial bonus

on grapple checks). If it gets a

hold, it can also constrict in

the same round. There-

after, the darktentacles

has the option to con-

duct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its

tentacle  to  hold  the

opponent (20 penalty

on grapple check, but

the darktentacles is

not considered grap-

pled). In either case,

each successful grapple

check it makes during

successive rounds auto-

matically deals slam and

constrict damage.

Spell-Like Abilities:

5/dayhold  monster;  3/daycharm

monster; 1/daywall of force. Caster level 10th; save DC 11 +

spell level.

Enhanced Multiweapon Fighting (Ex): This ability

lessens the penalty for off-hand weapon use by 2 for both

primary and off hands. Combined with the Multidexter-

ity and Multiweapon Fighting feats, this ability effec-

tively negates all attack penalties for using one or more

light off-hand weapons.

Tentacle Regeneration (Ex): Foes can attack the tenta-

cles of a darktentacles, but only when those appendages

are actually holding an opponent. A tentacle has an AC of

19 (touch 12) and can withstand 20 points of damage. The

loss of a tentacle does not harm the creature (that is, the

damage does not apply against its hit point total), and it

regrows the limb within a day.

Tremorsense (Ex): A darktentacles can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

Weapon Use (Ex): A darktentacles of Large size can

wield a melee weapon of up to Huge size in each tentacle. It

is proficient with all simple and martial melee weapons.

Skills: A darktentacles receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks.

These powerful undead often lead undead armies assembled

by necromancers, liches, demons, devils, or any other evil

beings intent on inflicting pain and destruction on the

living. Deathbringers care not whom they serve; they care

only about inflicting widespread destruction.

A deathbringer is a hulking brute of humanoid shape. It

has waxy gray skin and a bald head with no external ears. Its

lips and eyelids appear to have been sewn shut with blue

thread. The creature wears banded mail and wields two

wickedly spiked heavy flails.

Deathbringers speak Common and either Abyssal or

Infernal.

COMBAT

A deathbringer uses little subtlety in battle, but when-

ever it can make a full attack, it attempts to trip its oppo-

nent. If tripped during its own attempt, it drops its flail

and attacks with its armored fists. When severely dam-

aged, a deathbringer uses its negative burst power, cen-

tered on itself. This heals both the deathbringer and any

undead compatriots it has in the area while also harming

its opponents.

Greater Dispelling (Sp): A deathbringer can produce a

greater dispelling effect at will. Caster level 20th.

Negative Burst (Su): A deathbringer can release a

silent burst of negative energy at a range of up to 100 feet.

The burst has a 20-foot radius and deals 1d8+10 points of

negative energy damage to each living creature

in the area (Will DC 23 half ). Since undead

are  powered  by  negative  energy,  this

effect heals the deathbringer and any

other  undead  within  the  area  of  as

much damage as it would otherwise

deal. Once a deathbringer

releases a negative burst,

it must wait 1d4 rounds

before  it  can  do  so  again.

Trample (Ex): As a stan-

dard  action  during  its  turn

each round, a deathbringer

can trample opponents at

least  one  size  category

smaller than itself. This at-

tack deals 2d4+7 points of

bludgeoning damage. A tram-

pled opponent can attempt either an

attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a

Reflex save (DC 30) for half damage.

Undead Traits: A deathbringer is

immune to mind-affecting effects, poi-

son,  sleep,  paralysis,  stunning,  disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and

any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not

subject to critical hits, subdual damage,

Tanarri Traits: Tanarri can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Except as noted in the specific descriptions, a tanarri is

immune to electricity and poison, and it has acid resist-

ance 20, cold resistance 20, and fire resistance 20.

Summon Tanar ri (Sp): All tanarri can summon other

tanarri to their aid. This ability functions like a summon

monster spell of the appropriate level, except that it has only

a limited chance of success. Roll d% and compare the result

with the creatures chance of success. On a failure, no tanarri

answer the summons. Summoned tanarri automatically

return whence they came after 1 hour. A tanarri that has

just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability

for 1 hour. Most tanarri do not use their summon ability

lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned

creatures. In general, they use it only when necessary to

save their own lives.

ABYSSAL MAW

An abyssal maw is a disgusting creature consisting mainly

of teeth. Its appetite is legendary; one maw has been

known to consume the better part of a centaur in less than

a minute.

An abyssal maw looks like a huge, toothy mouth perched

on a few stubby appendages. Its hide is a dull brown shade.

Combat

Abyssal maws serve as shock troops in evil armies. Since

they lack ranged attacks, they usually rush into melee

combat as soon as possible, where

their gnashing teeth do

the rest.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:44 PM  Page 56

ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from

massive damage. A deathbringer cannot be raised, and res-

urrection works only if it is willing. The creature has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

DEMON

In the countless, nearly infinite realms of the Abyss,

demons grow numerous and varied. Though all embrace

the path of evil, the tanarri stand as the supreme villains

within the Abyssal hierarchy of iniquity. These creatures

are constantly in conflict with every force of good in the

universe, as well as with the lawful evil devils and baatezu

of the Nine Hells.

The abyssal maw, abyssal skulker, and abyssal ravager are

vicious but servile demons that can be found in the service

of more powerful demons, or of evil mortals who treat with

such  beings.  All  three  creatures  speak  Abyssal  and

Common, though abyssal maws and abyssal ravagers speak

none too clearly, thanks to their low Intelligence scores and

toothy maws.

The jovoc, palrethee, jarilith, and kelvezu appear wher-

ever their demonic masters see fit to make use of them, be

it the hidden reaches of their personal domains or out

among mortals on the Material Plane. The zovvut, though

not a tanarri itself, serves under and alongside those crea-

tures. All five of these demons speak Abyssal, Celestial,

and Draconic.

COMBAT

Demons are ferocity personi-

fied.  They  are  willing  to

attack any creatureseven

other  demonsjust  for

the sheer fun of it. De-

mons enjoy terrifying

their victims before

slaying  them,  and

they  often  devour

the slain. Many de-

mons can create dark-

ness,  so  they  fre-

quently blanket their

enemies with it be-

fore  joining  battle.

All  demons  have

the following abili-

ties  in  common.

Outsider Traits:

A  demon  has  dark-

vision (60-foot range).

It cannot be raised or

resurrected.

In addition, all tanarri have

the following abilities in common.

Rend Fallen (Ex): An abyssal maw loves to tear into its

downed foes. It automatically deals an additional 2d8+4

points of damage to any foe it drops with a melee attack.

ABYSSAL SKULKER

This demon is small but mean. Gangs of abyssal skulkers

usually stalk ahead of evil armies and raiding parties to seek

out and eliminate enemy scouts and pickets.

An abyssal skulker resembles a hairless ape with large

hands and feet. Knobs of horn run along the crown of its

head and down its spine. Although capable of walking

upright, it habitually creeps about on all fours, keeping its

body close to the ground.

Combat

Abyssal skulkers love to sneak up on their prey, then charge

as a group. Their victims rarely have time to sound an alarm.

ABYSSAL RAVAGER

The abyssal ravager is a grotesque hybridpart demon,

part hyena, and all nasty. Although its exact origins are

unclear, scholars agree that it is likely the result of demonic

lust, which has no bounds and results in all manner of

bizarre crossbreeds.

An abyssal ravager has baleful eyes and elongated jaws

full  of  overlarge  teeth.  Patches  of  scaly  hide  show

through its coarse, shaggy fur, and a row of curving spines

juts from its backbone. Its long, warty tail is equipped

with a vicious stinger. A full-grown specimen of either

gender stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, measures

nearly 10 feet from snout to base of tail, and weighs almost

2,000 pounds.

Combat

These demons are notoriously bad-tempered and aggressive.

They tend to attack anything they see or smell, striking it

repeatedly with their stingers.

Despite their formidable-looking teeth, abyssal ravagers

do not use bite attacks. Their weak jaws are useful only for

tearing apart prey that has already succumbed to their poi-

sonous stings.

Poison (Ex): An abyssal ravager delivers its poison (Forti-

tude save DC 14) with each successful sting attack. The ini-

tial  and  secondary  damage  is  the  same  (2d6  points  of

Strength damage).

Scent (Ex): An abyssal ravager can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

JOVOC

Combat

These vicious little black-hearted fiends were born to

create strife. Their ability to inflict the damage they take

on others makes them invaluable in the front lines of

tanarri armies. A unit of jovocs can absorb repeated blows

and spells from the enemy and still survive to exact a pun-

ishing revenge.

A jovoc is a 4-foot-tall, bloated, hairless creature of

humanoid shape. It resembles the bruised and battered

corpse of a gnome left too long to decay in the heat of

summer, and the stench that emanates from its rough skin

lends credence to this impression. Its skin is dark blue or

black, and its eyes are vacant, black pools. Each of the crea-

tures long arms ends in a three-fingered hand with long

red fingernails, forever stained the color of blood.

Jovocs are not especially intelligent, but they are quick and

experienced ambushers who know how to use their small

size to best effect. Years of training and experience have

taught them how to take advantage of their aura of retribu-

tion and fast healing abilities. They often adopt a hit-and-run

strategy, jumping into a group of enemies to do as much

damage as possible, then dashing off for a few rounds to heal.

Alternatively, jovocs fighting in pairs or trios can utilize

their favorite tactic. Lurking just beyond the reach of their

enemies (preferably concealed by darkness, a wall, or some

other barrier), they begin to attack one another, automati-

cally hitting with each swing. These attacks deal full damage

not only on the jovocs, but also on anyone caught within

their aura of retribution. After allowing a round or two for

58

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:45 PM  Page 59

their fast healing ability to close their wounds, the creatures

begin to claw and bite one another again.

Aura of Retribution (Su): This effect is always active in

a 30-foot spread centered on the jovoc. Whenever the crea-

ture takes damage from any source, every nontanarri

within the area immediately takes an equal amount of

damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 15) halves

the damage. (For example, if an opponent deals 12 points of

damage to a jovoc, that opponent and every other non-

tanarri within 30 feet also immediately take 12 points of

damage each, or 6 points with a successful Fortitude save.)

Regardless of the source of the damage to the jovoc, the

damage dealt to nontanarri by this effect is not subject to

negation or reduction because of resistance, immunity,

damage reduction, spell resistance, or the like.

Fast Healing (Ex): A jovoc regains lost hit points at the

rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit points

lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not

allow the jovoc to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day, a jovoc can attempt to

summon another jovoc with a 25% chance of success.

PALRETHEE

demons who yearned to rule the Abyss as balors. Despite

their great malice and their sadism, these lost souls failed in

some unknown trial by fire, and now they burn for all eter-

nity. Many balors use palrethees as sergeants or messengers,

taking great pleasure in reinforcing the ambitious demons

subservient positions. This connection between the two

kinds of tanarri has lent credence to the bards tales about

the palrethees origin.

A palrethee is a tall, emaciated creature of humanoid shape

with blood-red or blue skin and bony, white, vestigial wings.

The entire length of its body is sheathed in fire. The creature

can alter the color and appearance of its flames at will, making

them appear translucent and ghostly, or the red-orange shade

of a fiery forge, or even blue-white and delicate. No matter

how the flames look, their effects remain unchanged.

Combat

Palrethees have all the necessary combat abilities to enjoy

the din of battle, but these arrogant fiends often believe

themselves to be above the petty assignments they receive.

Desperate to acquire magic, mortal souls, or some other cur-

rency with which they can gain power, they try to make

bargains, use humans as tools, or trick unwary mortals into

According to legend, palrethees were once ambitious

doing their bidding.

When forced into combat, a pal-

rethee  usually  employs  its  fear

spell-like ability first to scatter as

many  opponents  as  possible,

then wades into melee with its

flaming longsword.

Demonic Burn (Ex): Any

creature hit by a palrethees

slam attack must succeed

at a Reflex save (DC 17)

or catch fire. The flame

burns  for  1d4  rounds

(see Catching on Fire  in

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide). A burn-

ing creature can take

a move-equivalent

action to put out

the flame.

many regions of the Abyss as well as on the Material Plane,

doing the bidding of anyone powerful enough to intimi-

date them into obedience.

Zovvuts are often used by demonic agents in conjunction

with more combative demonsthe latter keep enemies at

bay while the zovvuts gaze attacks annihilate them. Zovvuts

resent any creature with the power to command them and,

like any demons, they constantly seek to undermine and

betray authority.

A zovvut is a muscular, pale-skinned, hairless creature of

humanoid shape. Its arms end in sharp, barbed claws that

are well designed for rending flesh. Foul, feathered wings

stretch upward from the zovvuts shoulders. A third eye is

set into the center of its forehead.

ZOVVUT

Combat

Zovvuts are the spawn of some terrible demon prince.

The first of them were created during horrible blood rites

centuries ago. Rumors link zovvuts to that master of

demons and necromancy known as Orcus, though the

secret of the creatures creation has become widely known

among the lords of the Abyss. Now zovvuts can be found in

Zovvuts are not afraid of combat. Though weaker than many

other demons in terms of combat ability, they rely on their

gaze attack to bring their foes to submission.

Draining Gaze (Su): Any living creature within 30 feet

of a zovvut that meets its glowing red eyes must succeed at a

Will saving throw (DC 17) or gain one negative level. For

60

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:45 PM  Page 61

each negative level bestowed, the zovvut heals 5

points of damage. If the amount of healing is more

than the damage the creature has taken, it gains

any excess as temporary hit points. If the nega-

tive level has not been removed (with a spell

such as restoration) before 24 hours have

passed, the afflicted opponent must suc-

ceed at a Fortitude save (DC 17) to remove

it. Failure means the opponents level (or

HD) is reduced by one.

audience/clairvoyance, darkness, desecrate,

detect good, detect thoughts, doom, sug-

gestion, teleport without error (self

Create Spawn (Su): Any

humanoid slain by the zov-

vuts  gaze  attack  (negative

levels equal to current Hit Dice,

or drained below 1st level)

becomes a wight in 1d4

rounds. This creature is

under the command

of the zovvut that killed

it, and it remains enslaved

until  either  it  or  the  zovvut  dies.  A

spawn does not possess any of the abilities it had in life.

JARILITH

Jariliths, the elite hunting beasts of the Abyss, are terrifying

feline creatures conjured up from the nightmares of a thou-

sand generations of mortals. They prefer demonic flesh and

are comfortable hunting their favorite prey in desert, jungle,

waste, or forest. Jariliths are notoriously difficult to control,

so even the most powerful balor must tread carefully around

them. They sense weakness, and to them nearly any other

creature seems weak.

A jarilith resembles a slightly larger than average male lion,

complete with a glorious mane. Long teeth extend from its

jaws, and its claws are longer still. The creatures blood-red

coat reveals its origin, but it strikes so fast that the only clue

most victims get to its presence is a slight reek of brimstone.

Jariliths do not speak, but they understand Abyssal. They

communicate silently with one another through telepathy.

Combat

A jarilith is a direct, uncompromising foe in battle. Nor-

mally, it relies on its Power Attack feat and its augmented

critical ability to deal horrendous amounts of damage to its

foes. Though they often do not need the advantage, jariliths

prefer to ambush their opponents.

Frightful Presence (Ex): When a jarilith charges or

attacks, it inspires terror in all creatures within 30 feet that

have fewer Hit Dice or levels than it has. Each potentially

affected opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or

become shakena condition that lasts until the oppo-

nent is out of range. A successful save leaves that

opponent immune to that jariliths frightful pres-

ence for 24 hours.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a jarilith hits an

opponent that is at least one size category

smaller than itself with a bite attack, it deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If

it gets a hold, it can attempt to

rake in the same round. There-

after, the jarilith has the op-

tion to conduct the grapple

normally, or simply use its

jaws to hold the opponent

(20  penalty  on  grapple

check,  but  the  jarilith  is

not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful

grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automati-

cally  deals  bite  damage  and

allows another rake attempt.

Pounce (Ex): If a jarilith charges,

it can make a full attack (including a rake

attempt, see below) even though it has moved.

Rake (Ex): On any round that a jarilith has a hold on an

opponent (see Improved Grab, above), it can make two rake

attacks (+21 melee) with its hind legs for 2d6+6 points of

damage each. The jarilith can also attempt to rake when it

pounces on an opponent.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willclairaudience/clairvoyance,

darkness, detect good, detect thoughts, doom. Caster level 12th;

save DC 12 + spell level.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A jarilith threatens a critical

hit on a natural attack roll of 1820. On a successful critical

hit with a bite, claw, or rake attack, it deals triple damage.

Scent (Ex): A jarilith can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Summon Tanar ri (Sp): Once  per  day,  a  jarilith  can

attempt to summon another jarilith with a 35% chance of

success.

Skills: A jarilith receives a +4 racial bonus on Balance,

Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or

heavy undergrowth, its Hide bonus improves to +12.

KELVEZU

Mariliths act as generals in tanarri armies, and balors are the

mighty aristocrats of the Abyssal hierarchy. Both find

the services of kelvezusthe infiltrators and assassins of the

demonic realmquite useful. Kelvezus rarely lead troops;

instead, they surgically remove specific opponents (such as

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:45 PM  Page 62

devils, competing demons, or obstinate mortals) in accor-

dance with the orders of more powerful demons.

The kelvezu is remarkable among the higher ranks of

demonkind because of its sizeit stands barely 5 feet tall.

Because of its size and its humanoid shape, it can be mis-

taken for a human if it uses a touch of disguise to hide its

rosy red skin.

Combat

Kelvezus strike from stealth, relying not only on their invisi-

bility, but also on their gift for hiding and sneaking. Like their

mortal counterparts, these assassins try to dispatch their tar-

gets quickly. If they cannot, they retreat and strike again when

conditions are favorable. Every kelvezu carries a +1 scimitar of

greater wounding (see below) that resembles a serpents tail and

a +1 dagger of wounding that resembles a serpents tooth.

Poison (Ex): A kelvezu continually coats its weapons

with an injury poison (Fortitude save DC 19) produced from

its fingertips. The initial and secondary damage is the same

(1d6 points of Constitution damage). Kelvezu poison is

highly perishable, becoming inert 1 minute after the crea-

ture stops applying it.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Any time the kelvezus target is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when it is flanked by the

kelvezu, the latter deals an additional +8d6 points of damage

on a successful melee attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdeeper darkness, desecrate,

detect good, detect law, greater dispelling, improved invisibility

(self only), read magic, suggestion, teleport without error (self

plus 50 pounds of objects only), tongues (self only), unhallow.

Caster level 18th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Enhanced Detection (Su): In addition to its regular

senses, a kelvezu perceives foes through detect magic and see

invisibility effects (caster level 18th) that are always active.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally

allows a Reflex save for half damage, a kelvezu takes no

damage on a successful saving throw.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day, a kelvezu can attempt

to summon another kelvezu with a 25% chance of success.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A kelvezu retains its Dexterity

bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked.

Skills: A kelvezu receives a +8 racial bonus on Hide and

Move Silently checks.

New Melee Weapon Special Ability

Greater Wounding: A wound inflicted by a weapon of

greater wounding bleeds for 2 points of damage per round

thereafter, in addition to the normal damage the weapon

deals. Multiple wounds from the weapon result in cumulative

bleeding loss (two wounds deal 4 points of damage per round,

and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a successful

Heal check (DC 15) or the application of a cure spell or some

other healing spell (heal, healing circle, and so on).

Desmodus are massive, batlike humanoids who live in cav-

erns deep underground. They are omnivorous and usually

not dangerous unless attacked. Until recently, most sages

thought them to be extinct, wiped out in an ancient war

against the drow.

An adult desmodu stands 8 to 9 feet tall. Its body is cov-

ered with reddish-black or reddish-brown fur. The crea-

ture has long arms, short legs, and a head like that of a bat.

A membrane of leathery, black skin stretches from each

wrist to the corresponding ankle. A desmodus hands and

feet are long and narrow, with stubby, curving digits

ending in retractable claws. The fingers and toes, along

with the heel and palms, are equipped with cilia that give

the creature a very sure grip.

A desmodu is bipedal. Normally it walks upright with a

rolling gait, but it can also can get down on all fours and

gallop along at twice its base speed. The typical desmodu

wears armor and a harness for carrying tools and weapons,

but very little else.

Desmodus speak Undercommon and Terran in addition

to a language of their own. This language, called Desmodu,

includes both ultrasonic and subsonic utterances, so non-

desmodus cannot speak it. Desmodus have deep, rich voices,

though their speech includes the occasional sharp squeak

or bass rumble when they are using a language

other than their native tongue.

COMBAT

Desmodus use their sonic abilities to

give themselves bonuses and their

foes penalties. Their favorite melee

weapon is the notbora, an exotic

double  weapon  of  their

own invention.

These creatures of-

ten rush into melee

on  all  fours,  using

smokesticks to blind

foes. They follow up

by using the Quick

Draw feat to draw

their  notboras

and attack as they

stand up. Desmo-

dus also are fond

of dropping down

on opponents from

the ceiling of a cavern,

and they make full use

of their superior reach

in melee. Once battle is

joined, they jump and tumble

to bypass the foes front line and attack opposing spell-

casters or set up flanking attacks.

Screech (Su): Once per day, a desmodu can produce a

screech that can literally tear items apart. The creature can

choose one of two effects.

Ray: A ray deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to any crea-

ture or object it strikes. This attack has a range of 30 feet.

Spread: A sonic concussion causes every creature (except

other desmodus) within a 30-foot spread centered on the

desmodu to be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Forti-

tude save (DC 20) negates the effect.

Sonic Abilities (Su): At will, a desmodu can emit sub-

sonic vibrations, choosing one of two effects. It takes a

standard action to invoke an effect or to concentrate to

maintain it.

Despair: Each foe in a 30-foot spread centered on the

desmodu takes a 2 morale penalty on saving throws, attack

rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls

for as long as the desmodu concentrates and for 1d4 rounds

thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 16) negates this

sonic, mind-affecting effect.

Hope: Every ally in a 30-foot spread centered on the

desmodu gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack

rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls

for as long as the desmodu concentrates and for 1d4

rounds thereafter.

Wounding (Ex): A desmodus saliva con-

tains an anticoagulant that causes bite wounds

the creature inflicts to bleed freely. A wound

resulting from a desmodus bite attack bleeds for

an additional 1 point of damage per round

thereafter. Multiple wounds from such

attacks result in cumulative bleed-

ing loss (two wounds for 2 points

of damage per round, and so on).

The bleeding stops on its own

after 1 minute. Alterna-

tively, it can be stopped

by  a  successful  Heal

check  (DC  15)  or  the

application of a cure spell

or some other healing

spell (heal, healing circle,

or the like).

Blindsight  (Ex): A

desmodu emits high-fre-

quency sounds, inaudible

to  most  other  creatures,

that  bounce  off  nearby

objects and creatures. This

ability enables it to dis-

cern objects and crea-

tures within 120 feet. The

desmodu usually does not need

to make Spot or Listen checks to

notice creatures within range of its blindsight. A

silence spell negates this ability and forces the desmodu to

rely on its vision (which is as good as a humans).

Gallop (Ex): A desmodu can get down on all fours and

gallop along like an ape at a speed of 40 feet, provided that

its hands are free.

Speak with Bats (Sp): This ability functions like a speak with

animals spell (caster level 1st), except that it only works on

bats and is usable at will.

Skills: A desmodu receives a +4 racial bonus on Spot and

Listen checks, which is lost if its blindsight is negated. The

creature also gets a +2 racial bonus on grapple checks. When

wearing light armor or no armor, the creature gains a +2

bonus on Balance and Jump checks. All these racial bonuses

are included in the statistics above. When a desmodu has its

hands free and deliberately jumps down from a height, sub-

tract 10 feet from the distance fallen to determine damage.

If it makes a successful Jump check (DC 15), reduce the

effective distance fallen by another 10 feet.

DESMODU SOCIETY

Desmodus live in small, independent family groups that

gather in loosely organized colonies or enclaves to pool

resources and create a communal defense. They eschew

complex social organizations, and individual families live

as they please. Each family group includes several genera-

tions, with the eldest generation acting as the ruling body

to settle all issues.

The  oldest  and  most  experienced  desmodus  in  an

enclave form a council to settle disputes between families

and make recommendations about handling external

affairs. Desmodus of the same age from different families

frequently adopt each other as siblings. These adopted sib-

lings are called age-mates, and they always refer to each

other as though they were blood kin. The extended family

ties that desmodus form in this manner can be both varied

and complex, and they are usually not clear to anyone

except other desmodus.

Desmodus live in large caverns festooned with stalactites

and stalagmites. They tunnel into the ceilings to create

living spaces, keeping the entrances concealed among the

stalactites. They use the cavern floor to grow fungi, herd

lizards, and conduct any other activities that might be diffi-

cult to perform on the ceiling. Desmodus breed a variety of

bats to serve as steeds and guardians.

A desmodu settlement includes noncombatants

(mostly children) equal to 20% of the fighting

population. The society is egalitarian, so

both males and females can be found

filling almost every role.

Desmodus enjoy a simple life-

style. They understand the value of

weapons and tools, but they keep

neither  money  nor  valuables.

They  conduct  trade  through

barter, and the only distinction

they recognize as a status symbol

is the number of bats and lizards

a family owns.

Breeding, keeping, and train-

ing  bats  is  a  favorite  activity

among the desmodus. They con-

sider it a mark of distinction

to breed a new and useful

type of bat, and thus count-

less varieties of bats exist

within desmodu caverns. Three of the

types  that  are  of  value  in  combat  are

detailed in the Desmodu Bats entry (see

below), but there are many others as well.

Desmodu artisans produce a wide variety of ingenious

and high-quality goods. Some of these devices that may be

of interest to adventurers are described in the Desmodu

Items section, below. These creatures also produce all

manner of mundane items, including toys, household

goods, and musical instruments. All desmodus appreciate

good music and items that can produce or enhance sound.

Their own music, however, is mostly inaudible to others

because of its ultrasonic and subsonic components.

The chief desmodu deity is Vesperian, who is the creator

and protector of the race. Typically there is a shrine dedi-

cated to him in every enclave, and many dwellings also

boast private altars to Vesperian.

DESMODU ITEMS

Desmodus have created a number of specialized items for

their own use. Some of these items are detailed below.

Breathing Mask: This mask covers the users face. It is

fitted with goggles and a bag of an alchemical substance that

allows the wearer to breathe for up to 4 hours. With the

mask on, the wearer can ignore the effects of noxious fumes

and inhaled toxins. The mask even enables the wearer to sur-

vive underwater or in an airless environment.

The item consists of a masterwork leather mask with gog-

gles (cost 50 gp), and the alchemical air supply, which costs

950 gp and can be manufactured with a successful Alchemy

check (DC 20). A partially used air supply cannot be com-

bined with another partially used one to get a fresh supply,

but it can be discarded and replaced with a new supply.

Cost: 1,000 gp; Weight: 5 lb.

Cable: This  100-foot-long  metal

cord is thinner, stronger, and lighter

than even silk rope. It is too thin for

most creatures to climb it easily (Climb

DC 20), but desmodus using a cable

can climb at their normal climb speed.

The cable has a snap ring at each end

so that it can be quickly attached to or

detached from a piton, spike, grappling

hook,  or  other  item  without  a  Use

Rope check.

The cable has 10 hit points and hard-

ness 5. It can be burst with a successful

Strength check (DC 32). Its stiffness

imposes a 2 circumstance penalty on

Use Rope checks.

Cost: 50 gp; Weight: 4 lb.

Cablespool: This gadget carries 100

feet of cable in an enclosed reel. The

reel is spring-wound and can pull in all

100 feet of cable in 1 round (pulling

with an effective Strength score of 16). It

can be set to reel or unreel the cable automat-

ically as the user climbs, or to act as a brake, allowing the

user to jump down 100 feet without harm.

Cost: 125 gp (175 with cable); Weight: 2 lb. (6 lb. with cable).

Harness: Desmodus cannot wear belts because of the

flaps of skin attached to their flanks. Instead, they wear

harnesses that loop over their shoulders and between their

legs. Straps crisscross the front and back of the desmodus

body to keep the harness from slipping off.

Each desmodu harness is fitted with rings, hooks, and ties

for carrying weapons and equipment. A reinforced hook

hangs near the waist for carrying a cablespool.

Cost: 20 gp; Weight: 2 lb.

Frostfire: This sticky, adhesive substance drains away

heat when exposed to air or moisture. A flask of frostfire

can be thrown as a grenadelike weapon with a range incre-

ment of 10 feet, and a direct hit deals 1d6 points of cold

damage. The target can then attempt to scrape off or wash

away the frostfire, if desired. If this does not occur, the

target takes an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on

the round following the direct hit. Removing frostfire by

scraping requires a successful Reflex saving throw (DC

15). Alternatively, the substance can be removed auto-

matically by dousing it with at least 1 pint of an alco-

holic or acidic solution (such as wine or vinegar).

Either method requires a full-round action.

Cost: 40 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Kinship Badge: This item resembles an exqui-

site cymbal or flattened bell, measuring 3 or 4

inches across. When struck, it emits a single

musical note. It also resonates and produces a

distinctive ultrasonic tone when a desmodus

echolocation sounds strike it. Desmodus usually

exchange kinship badges with their age-mates and

use them to identify each other in battle.

Cost: 5 gp; Weight: .

Notbora: This Huge exotic double weapon looks like a

big quarterstaff with a crook at one end. A notbora has a

hinge in the middle so that it can be folded for storage. The

wielder can unfold the weapon and lock the hinge by

pressing a hidden catch (a free action when drawing the

notbora). The notboras straight end is actually a sheath

that can be removed to reveal a blade. The hooked end can

be used to make trip attacks. A wielder who is tripped

during his or her own trip attempt can drop the notbora to

avoid being tripped.

Each end of the notbora deals 2d6 points of damage. The

hooked end is a blunt weapon that deals double damage on

a critical hit and threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of

20. With the sheath in place, the straight end functions the

same way. With the sheath removed, the straight end is a

slashing weapon that deals double damage on a critical hit

and threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 or 20.

Cost: 20 gp; Weight: 2 lb.

DESMODU CHARACTERS

Desmodus sometimes become barbarians or rogues, but

their favored class is fighter. A desmodu fighter usually

leads a colonys council of elders, and fighters also lead most

warbands, in those rare cases when the desmodus join to

attack a common enemy. Wizards and clerics are unknown

in the race. Some desmodu sorcerers and bards exist, but

most desmodu spellcasters are adepts.

Because of its many special abilities, a desmodu PCs

effective character level (ECL) is equal to its class level +

14. Thus, a 1st-level desmodu fighter has an ECL of 15 and

is the equivalent of a 15th-level character.

DESMODU BAT

The desmodus love bats. They breed and maintain bats

of all shapes and sizes as companions, guards, and

draft animals. Three unique kinds of desmodu-bred

bats are described here.

COMBAT

Like other bats, these creatures fight on the wing,

swooping down to bite their foes.

Blindsight (Ex): A bat emits high-frequency

sounds, inaudible to most other creatures,

that bounce off nearby objects and crea-

tures. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 120 feet. The

bat usually does not need to make Spot or

Listen checks to notice creatures within

range of its blindsight. A silence spell

negates this ability and forces the bat to

rely on its weak vision, which has a range

of 10 feet.

RGM

Immunities: The bats the desmodus breed

are immune to the despair and stunning screech abilities

of desmodus.

HUNTING BAT

The desmodus breed these bats as hunting animals, in the

same way that humans breed hunting dogs. When hunting

for meat animals underground, a desmodu releases one or

more hunting bats. When the bat discovers prey, it calls

ultrasonically to its master, then begins chasing its quarry.

A hunting bat has a body like that of an ordinary bat and a

head that resembles a wolf s. Its fur is usually black or gray.

Combat

When a hunting bat swoops down on its prey, it first

attempts to trip its opponent. Whether or not this tactic suc-

ceeds, the bat follows up the attempt with bite attacks. The

bat then picks up any prey that it has downed in its jaws and

returns with it to its master.

Trip (Ex): A hunting bat that hits with a bite attack can

attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without

making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportu-

nity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip

the bat.

GUARD BAT

A guard bat is nearly identical to a

dire bat, except that the former is

more  agile,  has  even  keener

senses, and has a particularly

dangerous bite. The desmodus

use these creatures primarily as sentries.

A guard bat looks like a very large

bleeds for an additional 1 point of damage per round there-

after. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in cumula-

tive bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage per

round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a suc-

cessful Heal check (DC 15) or the application of a cure spell

or some other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).

feet. Except for its size, it looks like a normal bat.

In battle, a group of guard bats typically picks out a single

target and swoops in to bite. Then each guard bat uses its

Spring Attack feat to bite and fly out of reach before the foe

can respond.

Wounding (Ex): A guard bats saliva contains an anti-

coagulant that causes bite wounds the creature inflicts to

Devils are fiends from the plane of Baator, a lawful evil

realm. The most numerous devils are the baatezu, who are

infamous for their strength, evil temperament, and ruth-

lessly efficient organization. These creatures are constantly

in conflict with every force of good in the universe, as well

as with the chaotic evil demons and tanarri of the Abyss.

Baatezu have a rigid caste system, in which authority

derives not only from power but also from station. These

creatures occupy themselves with extending their influence

throughout the planes, primarily by corrupting mortals.

Baatezu who further this agenda are usually rewarded with

improved stations.

Most baatezu have a Gothic gargoyle look. They are

grotesque and unsightly by human standards, corrupted

physically by the evil they embrace. A few have an infernal

sort of beauty in their natural forms, but these are rare.

The advespa, amnizu, and malebranche are vicious

devils usually found in the service of more powerful

baatezu, or of evil mortals who treat with such beings.

These baatezu appear wherever their infernal masters send

them, though the amnizus in particular are rarely deployed

on other planes.

Unless otherwise noted, devils speak Infernal, Celestial,

and Draconic.

COMBAT

Devils enjoy bullying those weaker than themselves, and

they often attack good creatures just to gain a trophy or

three. Some devils are surrounded by fear auras, which they

use to break up powerful groups so that they can defeat

opponents piecemeal.

The baatezu tend to use their illusion abilities to delude

and confuse foes as much as possible in combat. One of their

favorite tricks is to create illusory reinforcements, so that

enemies can never be entirely sure whether a threat is only

a figment or a group of real devils that has been summoned

to join the fray.

All devils share the fol-

lowing traits.

Outsider Traits: A devil has darkvision (60-foot range). It

cannot be raised or resurrected.

In addition, all baatezu have the following abilities in

common unless otherwise stated.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Most baatezu can summon other

baatezu to their aid. This ability functions like a summon

monster spell of the appropriate level, except that it has only

a limited chance of success. Roll d% and compare the result

with the creatures listed chance of success. On a failure, no

baatezu answer the summons. Summoned creatures auto-

matically return whence they came after 1 hour. A baatezu

that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon

ability for 1 hour. Most baatezu do not use their summon

ability lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the sum-

moned creatures. In general, they use it only when neces-

sary to gain victory or to save their own lives.

Baatezu Traits: Unless otherwise noted, a baatezu can

communicate telepathically with any creature within 100

feet that has a language. In addition, it can see perfectly in

darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness

spell. A baatezu is immune to fire and poison, and it has acid

resistance 20 and cold resistance 20.

ADVESPA

Advespas are female, wasplike devils that patrol the skies

above the infernal planes. They are often found under

the command of some more powerful baatezu.

An advespa appears as a huge, heavy-

bodied wasp with a female face. It has small,

antennalike horns, protruding humanoid

features, dripping mandibles,

a chitinous hide, and a

pair of dark, resilient, insect

wings. Its lower abdomen termi-

nates  in  a  barbed,  poisonous  stinger,

which may be brought up over the creatures

head in the manner of a scorpions tail.

The most common advespa is en-

tirely black; in fact, it looks as if it

had been carved from obsidian or

some other dark stone. The more

powerful advespas (those with

higher  stations  and  slightly

higher Charisma scores) have

striations  of  yellow,  red,  and

orange, and they tend to be smaller

than the common advespas. These

colorful  advespas

usually  serve

as the leaders of

squads and swarms.

Combat

An advespa usually attacks from above, seeking to

pounce upon and grapple an opponent. If it succeeds,

L

I

V

E

D

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:46 PM  Page 69

it stings with its poisonous tail until its foe succumbs, then

flies off with its helpless prey.

Improved Grab (Ex): If an advespa hits an opponent that

is at least one size category smaller than itself with both

claws, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +13). If it gets a hold, it automatically hits

with its sting. Thereafter, the advespa has the option to con-

duct the grapple normally, or simply use its claws to hold

the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the advespa

is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful

grapple check it makes during successive rounds automati-

cally deals damage from both claws and the sting.

Poison (Ex): The advespa injects a dose of poison (Forti-

tude save DC 15) with each successful sting attack. The ini-

tial  and  secondary  damage  is  the  same  (1d4  points  of

Strength damage).

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daychange self, command, produce

flame, pyrotechnics. Caster level 4th; save DC 10 + spell level.

Regeneration (Ex): An advespa takes normal damage

from acid, and also from holy weapons and blessed weapons

of at least +1 enhancement.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day, an advespa can

attempt to summon 1d2 additional advespas with a 30%

chance of success.

AMNIZU

Amnizus are short, stocky, winged devils that serve as

guardians at the gates of the Nine Hells of Baator. The typi-

cal amnizu has one or more squads of advespas at its disposal

at all times.

An amnizu has an oversized, elongated head, small pig-

like eyes, a pug nose, and a large, fang-filled mouth. Its

wings are large and batlike.

Amnizus speak Infernal and Common.

Combat

An amnizus task is not so much to keep interlopers out of

the infernal domains as it is to ensure that, once they enter,

they never escape. To that end, the creature usually softens

up opponents with quickened fireballs and the attacks of its

advespa troops before attempting to use its feeblemind

touch to capture and detain its foes.

Feeblemind Touch (Su): The touch of an amnizu dupli-

cates the effect of a feeblemind spell (caster level 14th; Will

save DC 14).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willmajor image; 3/day

fireball; 1/daysequester. Caster level 14th; save DC 10 +

spell level.

Regeneration (Ex): An amnizu takes normal damage

from acid, and also from holy weapons and blessed weapons

of at least +1 enhancement.

Secure Intelligence (Ex): An amnizu is immune to

any effect that would drain, damage, or otherwise reduce

its Intelligence score.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day, an amnizu may

summon 1d3 advespas or 1 amnizu with a 50% chance of

success.

MALEBRANCHE

Malebranches are huge, hulking devils with wickedly

curving horns. These creatures usually serve other, more

intelligent members of the infernal hierarchy as warriors,

enforcers, punishers, and occasionally as mounts. Within

the Nine Hells of Baator, malebranches are usually armed

with immense masterwork tridents wrought from cold

iron. These aggressive baatezu tend to bully creatures

smaller than themselves and grovel before those that are

more powerful.

A malebranche is a massive, winged devil of humanoid

shape with an underslung jaw and huge, slightly curved

horns. Its feral eyes glow with flickering shades of red.

Malebranches speak only Infernal, but they underestand

Commonparticularly orders and curses in that language.

Combat

Malebranches are heavy hittersthe brute force among the

baatezuand they utilize their great strength to the best of

their ability. A malebranche usually charges into combat on

silent wings, hoping to catch its opponents flat-footed with

a gore attack. Then the creature wreaks havoc with its

masterwork iron trident.

Charge (Ex): A malebranche typically begins a battle

with a flying charge at an opponent on the ground. In

addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge,

this tactic allows the malebranche to make a single gore

attack (+24 melee) that deals 6d6+15 points of damage.

The creature can also charge while moving on the ground,

if it wishes.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a malebranche hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +34). The creature has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

claw to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the malebranche is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals claw damage.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a malebranche can pro-

duce a fear effect. This ability functions like a fear spell

(caster level 12th; save DC 18), except that it affects all crea-

tures within a 15-foot radius around the malebranche. Any

creature that makes a successful saving throw against the

effect cannot be affected again by that malebranches fear

aura for 24 hours. All baatezu are immune to the male-

branches fear aura.

Regeneration  (Ex): A  malebranche  takes  normal

damage from acid, and also from holy and blessed weapons

of at least +3 enhancement.

DINOSAUR

Dinosaurs, or terrible lizards, are ancient reptilian beasts

that may be related to dragons. Among the traits that the

typical predatory dinosaur shares with many dragons are

sharp teeth, a savage disposition, a well-developed sense

of territory, and a ruthless drive to hunt. The herbivo-

rous dinosaurs are not usually aggressive unless wounded

or defending their young, but they may attack if startled

or harassed.

Dinosaurs most often live in rugged or isolated areas that

humanoids seldom visit: remote mountain valleys, inacces-

sible plateaus, tropical islands, and the densest jungles. They

may also populate a campaigns lost lands.

COMBAT

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The

swift carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until

they can get close enough to charge. The great herbivores

frequently overrun and trample their opponents.

Scent (Ex): A dinosaur can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

CRYPTOCLIDUS

Cryptoclidus is a plesiosaur, a 10-foot-long aquatic reptile

much like elasmosaurus (see the Monster Manual). Its neck

isnt as long, proportionately, as that of elasmosaurus, but

the two creatures have similar ovoid bodies. Cryptoclidus

propels itself through the water by flapping four paddle-

like fins. Its tail is also finned.

Combat

Cryptoclidus normally hunts fish, darting its neck into trav-

eling schools and snapping up prey with its sharp little

teeth. However, it is capable of traveling on the surface of

the water and occasionally seeks larger prey.

Improved Grab (Ex): If cryptoclidus hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +10). If it gets a hold, it can try

to swallow the opponent. Alternatively, the cryptoclidus has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but cryptoclidus is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals bite damage.

Swallow Whole (Ex): Cryptoclidus can swallow a grabbed

opponent that is at least two size categories smaller than itself

by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +10).

Once inside the gullet, the opponent takes 1d8+4 points of

bludgeoning damage plus 1d6+2 points of acid damage per

round from the dinosaurs digestive juices. A successful grap-

ple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the

gullet and return to the mouth, where another successful

grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed

creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light

piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of

damage to the digestive tract (AC 20) in this way creates an

opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swal-

lowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus,

another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A

Large cryptocliduss gullet can hold 1 Small, 4 Tiny, or 16

Diminutive or smaller opponents.

ALLOSAURUS

Allosaurus is a big flesh-eating dinosaur that inhabits

warm areas. It eats both mammals and

smaller dinosaurs.

Allosaurus  is  36  feet  long  and

weighs 1 1/2 tons. A long tail bal-

ances its big head, S-shaped bulldog

neck,  and  bulky

body. It has power-

ful  hind  limbs

with  clawed  feet

and short, strong,

three-fingered fore-

limbs  with  digits

ending in impressive

claws. The top of its head

has bony ridges and bumps, and its jaws hold

serrated, bladelike teeth.

Combat

Allosaurus eats everything it can catch. If its prey is too big

to swallow whole, the dinosaur latches on with its powerful

jaws and begins raking until the creature is dead.

Improved Grab (Ex): If allosaurus hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +22). If it gets a hold, it can

attempt to rake in the same round, and the next round it

can try to swallow the opponent. Alternatively, allosaurus

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but allosaurus is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals bite damage and

allows another rake attempt.

Rake (Ex): On any round that allosaurus has a hold on an

opponent (see Improved Grab, above), it can make two rake

attacks (+12 melee) with its hind legs for 2d8+3 points of

damage each. Allosaurus can also attempt to rake when it

pounces on an opponent.

Swallow Whole (Ex): Allosaurus can swallow a grabbed

opponent that is at least two size categories smaller than

itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus

+22). Once inside the gullet, the opponent takes 2d8+12

points of bludgeoning damage and 1d8 points of acid

damage per round from the dinosaurs digestive juices. A

successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to

climb out of the gullet and return to the mouth, where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free.

Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way

out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing

weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the diges-

tive tract (AC 20) in this way creates

an  opening  large  enough  to

permit escape. Once a single

swallowed creature exits,

muscular action closes the

hole; thus, another swal-

lowed opponent must cut

its own way out. A Huge

allosauruss  gullet  can

hold 1 Medium-size, 4

Small,  16 Tiny,  or

64  Diminutive  or

smaller opponents.

Trample (Ex): As

a  standard  action

during its turn each

round,  allosaurus  can

trample opponents at least one

size category smaller than itself. This attack

deals 5d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled

opponent can attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4

penalty or a Reflex save (DC 22) for half damage.

ANKYLOSAURUS

Ankylosaurus is a heavily armored, quadrupedal herbivore.

It is a versatile plant-eater, equally at home among temper-

ate forests, humid marshes, and dry grasslands. These

creatues sometimes travel in herds for added protection

from larger predators.

The typical ankylosaurus is 25 to 35 feet in length, 4 1/2 feet

tall, and 7 to 8 feet wide. A bony, armored shell covered with

spikes protects its back and sides, giving the dinosaur the

appearance of some infernally armored siege machine. This

carapace protects the dinosaur from most attacksindeed,

those who have wounded an ankylosaurus and lived to tell the

tale swear that the only way to harm the beast is to strike it on

its underbelly. Its wide, flat, armored head protects a tiny

brain. Its four legs are quite muscular, and it can rear up on the

hind pair to reach the tender leaves of some of its favorite

plants. Its heavy tail is tipped with a massive club, which the

ankylosaurus can swing with devastating force and accuracy.

This can cause even the most determined predator to think

twice before attempting to make a meal of ankylosaurus.

Combat

Ankylosaurus rarely attacks unless it or its herd is threat-

ened. Though it is slow to action, once this dinosaur views

another creature as an enemy, it fights until either it or its

attacker is dead. In battle, it stands put, swinging its tail at

any creature that comes within reach. If it takes 80 or

more points of damage or finds

itself cornered, it attempts to

flee, trampling any creatures in

its path.

opponent can at-

alty or a Reflex save (DC

QUETZALCOATLUS

Technically  not  a  dinosaur,

quetzalcoatlus  is  a  massive

flying reptile. This fearsome predator

glides through the skies searching for

meals. Although it is not averse to eating

carrion, it prefers fresh meat or fish.

Quetzalcoatlus has a long neck and

head, and a relatively large brain.

Its  wings are flaps of skin ex-

tended and controlled by its fore-

limbs and specially evolved fingers.

Combat

When  hunting  over

water, it flies low and

scoops fish and aquatic

reptiles from just below

the waters surface. It also at-

tacks small land creatures when it

can find them. Vulnerable to other

predators while it is on the ground,

quetzalcoatlus  prefers  to  swoop

down, snatch its prey in its

jaws, and then struggle to regain altitude while swallowing

its catch.

Swallow Whole (Ex): Quetzalcoatlus can swallow a

snatched opponent that is at least two size categories

smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check

(grapple bonus +23). Once inside the dinosaur, the oppo-

nent takes 1d8+4 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d4

points of acid damage per round from its gizzard. A suc-

cessful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to

climb out of the gizzard and return to the beak, where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free.

Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out

with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon.

Dealing at least 15 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15)

in this way creates an opening large enough to permit

escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular

action closes the hole;

thus, another swal-

lowed opponent

must cut its own

way out. A Huge

quetzalcoatluss

gizzard can hold 1

Medium-size, 4 Small,

16 Tiny, or 64 Diminu-

tive or smaller opponents.

Feats: A creature that

is flung by quetzal-

coatlus after being

snatched travels 100

feet and takes 10d6 points of damage. If

quetzalcoatlus is flying, the creature takes

this damage or the appropriate falling

damage, whichever is greater.

SPINOSAURUS

Spinosaurus is the largest bipedal predatory dinosaur, tow-

ering over even tyrannosaurus. It has longer arms than the

latter, and it occasionally moves about on all fours. Spin-

osaurus also has a large, saillike, ribbed fin on its back. The

purpose of this appendage is unclear, but spinosaurus has a

relatively flexible spine, so when it arches its back, the sail

spreads. Spinosaurus has a large head

with sharp, straight, nonserrated

teeth set into a powerful, croco-

dilelike lower jaw.

Combat

Though capable of running

down prey, spinosaurus pre-

fers to freeze opponents in

their places with an unearthly,

soul-searing bellow. When it

must chase prey, it tramples

smaller creatures and grabs

larger ones with its powerful

jaws while tearing with its claws.

Frightful  Presence  (Ex):

When a spinosaurus bellows (a

standard action), it inspires terror

in all creatures within 30

feet  that  have  fewer  Hit

Dice or levels than it has. Each

potentially affected opponent must

succeed at a Will save (DC 20) or

become shaken for 5d6 rounds.

A successful save leaves that

opponent immune to that spin-

osauruss frightful pres-

ence for 24 hours.

SEISMOSAURUS

Seismosaurus is the largest known of the dinosaurs. It feeds

on plants, often defoliating several square miles of terrain

within the course of a few weeks.

Seismosaurus is an immense four-legged dinosaur with a

small head, a bulky body, and a long neck and tail. Its nos-

trils are located high up on its head.

Combat

Seismosaurus is simply too big to have natural enemiesit

dwarfs even the likes of allosaurus and tyrannosaurus (see

the Monster Manual). Seismosaurus is more likely to inad-

vertently step on an opponent than to intentionally use its

tail slap attack.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, seismosaurus can trample opponents at least one size

category smaller than itself. This attack deals 10d10+22

points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can

attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a

Reflex save (DC 41) for half damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If spinosaurus

hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller

than itself with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +40). If it gets a

hold, it can try to swallow the opponent in the next round.

Alternatively, spinosaurus has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the oppo-

nent (20 penalty on grapple check, but spinosaurus is not

considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Swallow  Whole  (Ex): Spinosaurus  can  swallow  a

grabbed opponent that is at least two size categories smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +40). Once inside the gullet, the opponent takes

2d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8+4 points of

acid damage per round from the dinosaurs digestive juices.

A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to

climb out of the gullet and return to the mouth, where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free.

Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out

with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon.

Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the digestive tract

(AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to

permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, mus-

cular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed oppo-

nent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan spinosauruss

gullet can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium-size, 32 Small, or 128

Tiny or smaller opponents.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, spinosaurus can trample opponents at least one size

category smaller than itself. This attack deals 2d8+19 points

of  bludgeoning  damage.  A  trampled  opponent  can

attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or

a Reflex save (DC 33) for half damage.

Skills: Spinosaurus receives

a  +2  racial  bonus  on

Listen  and  Spot

checks.

DIRE ANIMAL

Dire animals are larger, tougher, and meaner ver-

sions of normal animals. They tend to have a feral,

prehistoric look.

COMBAT

Dire animals are fierce fighters that prefer melee combat.

They are territorial, attacking anything that enters their ter-

ritory or threatens their lairs.

Saving Throws: A dire animal has all good saves.

DIRE TOAD

These amphibians are generally shy and nonagressive. They

usually arent dangerous to humanoids.

Combat

Swallow  Whole  (Ex): A  dire  toad  can  swallow  a

grabbed opponent that is at least one size category smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +3). Once inside the toad, the opponent takes 1d6

points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 points of acid

damage per round from the dire toads stomach. A success-

ful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb

out of the stomach and return to the toads mouth, where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free.

Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way

out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing

weapon.  Dealing  at

least  10  points  of

damage to the gizzard

(AC 13) in this way creates

an  opening  large  enough  to

permit escape. Once a single swal-

lowed  creature  exits,  muscular  action

closes the hole; thus, another swallowed oppo-

nent must cut its own way out. A Medium-

size dire toads stomach can hold 2 Small

or 8 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Skills: A dire toad receives a +4 racial

bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks,

and a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks.

DIRE HAWK

This bird of prey is capable of taking down pigs,

sheep, and even the occasional small horse. The dire

hawk prefers high, remote nesting spots.

A typical dire hawk is about 5 feet long and has a wing-

span of about 11 feet. The upper part of its beak has a bony

protrusion, and several long feathers trail gracefully from

its lower body and tail.

Skills: *A dire hawk receives a +8 racial bonus on Spot

checks in daylight.

DIRE SNAKE

Though dire toads are not prone to fighting, they do bite if

disturbed. A dire toads tongue attack has a range of 10 feet

with no range increment.

Poison (Ex): A dire toad delivers its poison (Fortitude save

DC 14) with each successful bite attack. The initial and second-

ary damage is the same (1d6 points of Constitution damage).

Improved Grab (Ex): If a dire toad hits an opponent that

is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite

attack or a tongue attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +3). If it gets a hold,

it can try to swallow the opponent. Alternatively, the dire

toad has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but the dire toad is not considered grappled).

In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals bite damage.

The dire snake combines the strength and power of a con-

strictor with the venomous bite of a viper.

The dire snake looks like an enormous viper with dull

green or brown scales and long fangs. Its head has two bony

protrusions similar to horns placed just behind the eyes.

Combat

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a dire

snake can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing 1d8+10

points of bludgeoning damage.

Poison (Ex): A dire snake delivers its poison (Fortitude

save DC 16) with each successful bite attack. The initial

and secondary damage is the same (1d6 points of Constitu-

tion damage).

Improved Grab (Ex): If a dire snake hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

opportunity (grapple bonus +20). If it gets a hold, it can

also constrict in the same round. Thereafter, the

dire snake has the option to conduct the grapple

normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the op-

ponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the

dire snake is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals bite and con-

strict damage.

Scent (Ex): A dire snake can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A dire snake receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide,

Listen, and Spot checks, and a +8

DIRE HORSE

These  aggressive,  wild

equines roam the wilder-

ness in herds. Dire horses

resist domestication as much

as any wild animal does.

A dire horse looks like a

large version of a normal

horse except for the

bony  plates

on either side

of its head. A dire horses hooves often

have jagged edges, and its mane tends to

be shaggy.

Combat

A dire horse usually lashes out with

its hooves and follows up with a

bite  attack.  It  can  fight

while carrying a rider, but

the rider cannot also attack

unless he or she succeeds at a

Ride check (DC 10).

Carrying Capacity:

A  light  load  for  a  dire

horse is up to 519 pounds; a

medium  load  is  5201,038

pounds; and a heavy load is

1,0391,557  pounds.  A  dire

horse  can  drag  7,785  pounds.

than males, but a cow dire elk is still formidable when her

calves are threatened.

A dire elk has dark-colored, shaggy hair covering its body.

The bulls enormous antlers can span up to 12 feet, and he

can weigh up to 3 tons. In the spring, he sheds his antlers, so

his gore attack is not available until he regrows them the fol-

lowing autumn. A female is not antlered, so she never has

access to a gore attack.

Combat

If a bull dire elk believes himself challenged, he tries to

drive off the interloper by bellowing loudly and pawing the

ground. If that doesnt work, he charges with his head low-

ered to deliver a vicious gore with his oversized antlers, then

follows up with trample attacks.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a dire elk can trample opponents at least one size cat-

egory smaller than itself. This attack deals 2d8+10 points of

bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex

save (DC 23) for half damage.

Scent (Ex): A dire elk can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A dire elk receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

DIRE ELEPHANT

These titanic herbivores are somewhat unpredictable and

moody. Giants sometimes use dire elephants as mounts or

beasts of burden.

A dire elephant is a much larger version of a normal ele-

phant, with bony plates armoring its spine and huge, vicious

tusks. Its eyes are small and mean.

Combat

A dire elephant attacks by slamming opponents with its

massive trunk, then stamping them into the ground.

When there are several opponents, it usually attempts to

trample them.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a dire elephant can trample opponents at least one

size category smaller than itself. This attack deals 4d6+22

points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can

attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a

Reflex save (DC 35) for half damage.

Scent (Ex): A dire elephant can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

DRAGON, GEM

Gem dragons are a subcategory of dragons that spend much

of their time on the Inner Planes. All are psionically power-

ful, although to most observers their psychic talents are

indistinguishable from sorcery. Gem dragons tend to be

aloof, solitary, and self-centered.

All dragons become more powerful as they age. They

range in length from several feet upon hatching to more

than 100 feet after attaining the status of great wyrm.

Living primarily on the Inner Planes, gem dragons have

developed unusual diets. While they enjoy variety in their

meals, they can survive indefinitely by consuming elemen-

tal matter. The gem dragons are not native to the Inner

Planes, and all kinds of gem dragons can be found on all the

planes, but they do have favored environments.

Like all dragons, gem dragons are incredibly covetous.

They hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gather-

ing as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible.

Those with large hoards become slightly paranoid, ventur-

ing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to

get food. For dragons, there is never enough treasure: Its

pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons

like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and

mounds to fit their bodies. By the time a dragon matures to

the great wyrm stage, hundreds of gems and coins are

embedded in its hide.

All dragons speak Draconic.

COMBAT

At its younger ages, a dragon attacks with its powerful

claws and bite. As it grows older and larger, it acquires

other attack forms as well (see Dragon Attacks, below). In

addition, it can use a breath weapon, and it may also have

access to various special abilities specific to its kind (see

individual descriptions).

A dragon usually prefers to fight on the wing, staying

out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with

ranged attacks. Older, more intelligent dragons are adept

at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dan-

gerous foes firstor avoiding them while it picks off

weaker enemies.

The table below describes the physical attacks a dragon

gains as it grows larger. The last two rows of the table give

the attack modifiers and damage modifiers for each attack.

The dragon gets its full attack bonus for its bite, which is

always its primary attack. Claw, wing, and tail slap attacks

are all secondary, so these are made at a 5 penalty. Crush

and tail sweep are special attacks that do not require attack

rolls (see below). To determine the damage bonus for each

attack, multiply the value given in the last row by the

dragons Str bonus.

Bite: A dragon can also use its bite to snatch opponents

(see the Snatch feat description in the introduction).

Claw: A dragon can also use its claws to snatch opponents

(see the Snatch feat description in the introduction).

Wing: A dragon can slam opponents with its wings, even

when flying.

Tail Slap: A dragon can slap one opponent each round

with its tail.

Crush: A flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size

can land on opponents three or more size categories smaller

than itself as a standard action, using its whole body to crush

them. (Of course, it can still attempt normal overrun or

grapple attacks against larger opponents.) A crush attack

affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragons body

(see Dragon Face and Reach Table, above). Each creature in

the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2

dragons HD + dragons Constitution modifier) or be pinned,

automatically taking the listed amount of bludgeoning

damage. Thereafter, if the dragon chooses to maintain the

D

G

N

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:46 PM  Page 78

pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. While pinned, the

opponent takes crush damage each round.

Tail Sweep: A dragon of at least Gargantuan size can

sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects

creatures four or more size categories smaller than the

dragon within a half-circle (diameter 30 feet for a Gargan-

tuan dragon or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), centered on

the dragons rear. Each affected creature that fails a Reflex

save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragons HD + dragons Constitution

modifier) takes the listed damage; a successful save halves

the damage.

Grappling: Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though

their crush attacks and the Snatch feat (see the introduc-

tion) use normal grapple rules.

If grappled by a creature the same size category as itself or

larger, a dragon can return the attack with its bite and all four

legs (the rear legs deal claw damage). If snatched or crushed

by a larger dragon, a dragon can respond only with grapple

attacks to try winning free, or with bite or breath weapon

attacks. If grappled by a creature smaller than itself, the

dragon can respond with any of its physical attacks other

than a tail sweep.

A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grap-

pling, as well as its spell-like or supernatural abilities, pro-

vided it succeeds at a Concentration check.

Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard

action. Once a dragon breathes, it must wait 1d4 rounds to do

so again. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the

dragons mouth and extends in a direction of its choice, with

an area as noted below. If the breath weapon deals damage,

each creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save

(DC 10 + 1/2 dragons HD + dragons Charisma modifier; see

individual entries for specific DCs) to take half damage.

Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same

DCs, but the types vary as noted in the variety descriptions.

Breath weapons come in two basic shapes: line and cone.

The areas vary with the dragons size, as shown on the

table below.

A line is always 5 feet high and 5 feet wide.

*A cone is as high and wide as its length.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon

can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes

effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges,

or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet  the

dragons age category are subject to the effect if they have

fewer HD than the dragon.

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save

(DC 10 + 1/2 dragons HD + dragons Charisma modifier)

remains immune to that dragons frightful presence for 24

hours. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice

becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds; one with 5 or more Hit

Dice becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the

frightful presence of other dragons.

Special Abilities: A gem dragons special abilities depend

on its age and kind. It gains the abilities given for its age cat-

egory plus all previous ones. The save DC is 10 + dragons

Charisma modifier + spell level.

Psionics (Sp): All gem dragons have psionic abilities, as

given in their descriptive text. (When using the Psionics

Handbook, treat a gem dragons spell resistance as power

resistance.)

Blindsight (Ex): A dragon can ascertain its surroundings

by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by

noticing vibration and other environmental clues). This

ability enables it to discern objects and creatures within a

range of 30 feet  the dragons age category. The dragon usu-

ally does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice

creatures within range of its blindsight.

Immunities (Ex): All dragons are immune to sleep and

paralysis effects. Each kind of dragon is immune to one or

two additional forms of attack no matter what its age, as

given in its description.

Keen Senses (Ex): A dragon sees four times as well as a

human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal

light. It also has darkvision with a range of 100 feet  the

dragons age category.

Skills: Every dragon starts with 6 skill points per Hit Die,

plus bonus points equal to its Intelligence modifier  HD.

The following skills are class skills for all dragons: Bluff,

Concentration, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Knowledge (any),

Listen, Scry, Spot, and Search. Dragons cannot gain skills

that are exclusive to a class.

Feats: Each dragon has one feat, plus an additional feat per

4 HD. Dragons favor Alertness, Cleave (claw or tail slap attacks

only), Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Sunder, and Weapon

Focus (claw or bite). They can also choose from the following

feats, all of which are described in the Creature Feats sidebar in

the introduction of this book: Ability Focus, Flyby Attack,

Hover, Quicken Spell-Like Ability, Snatch, and Wingover.

Hover: If a dragon hovers close to the ground in an area

with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a

hemispherical cloud with a radius of 30 feet  the dragons

age category.

Snatch: A creature that is flung by a gem dragon after

being snatched travels 10 feet and takes 1d6 points of

damage per age category. If the dragon is flying, the creature

takes  this  damage  or  the  appropriate  falling  damage,

whichever is greater.

Planar Travel (Su): Gem dragons have the innate ability

to pass instantly between the Material Plane and the Inner

Planes, where they often make their homes.

Resistances (Ex): Unless otherwise noted in an individ-

resistance 30.

Movement: Each gem dragon has a swim speed and

a burrow speed, in addition to being able to fly. Only the

topaz dragon can breathe underwater, so the others are

limited to surface areasalthough older dragons

can hold their breath for very long periods.

as  intermediaries  between  warring  dragons,  or  even

humanoid civilizations.

An amethyst dragon has lavender skin and scales that

are shaped like naturally formed mineral crystals. When it

first hatches, its scales are a light, translucent purple shade.

As it grows older, they gradually darken and take on a crys-

talline quality.

Most ame-

thyst dragons live in

hollowed-out spaces on the Elemental Plane of Earth.

These caverns can consist of many passages and chambers

resplendent with crystals of all colors.

Combat

Younger amethyst dragons avoid combat by flying away if pos-

sible. Older ones use their special abilities, such as invisibility,

to improve their chances of catching a target flat-footed. Even

adults flee if it is obvious after the first few rounds of combat

that they cannot overpower their opposition.

If an amethyst dragon is fighting to protect its lair or its

young, however, it seldom flees a battle. A younger one uses

its spell-like abilities, breath weapon, feats that are usable

when flying, and any magic items it owns, while an older

and larger one uses grapple, snatch, and crush attacks to

even the odds.

Breath Weapon (Su): An amethyst dragon has one

breath weapon, a line of concussive force. It can choose to

deal subdual damage instead of normal damage.

Explosive Gem (Sp): Once per day, an amethyst dragon can

spit a violet, crystalline lozenge up to 75 feet away with pin-

point accuracy. The gem explodes on impact, dealing bludg-

eoning damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius. A target

that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw (DC 17 +

dragons age category) takes half damage.

Amethyst Telekinesis (Sp): Once

per day, an amethyst great wyrm

can use a telekinesis effect. With

this ability, it can lift up to 10 tons

or hurl a Large or smaller

creature against another

object. The impact deals

20d6 points of damage to

a Large creature, 15d6 to

a Medium-size one, 10d6

to a Small one, 5d6 to a

Tiny one, or 1d6 to a Diminu-

tive or Fine creature.

Force Resistant (Ex):

An amethyst dragon gains

a +4 bonus on saving throws

against force-based effects

such as magic missile.

Stomp (Su): By stamping its

foot, an amethyst dragon precipitates a shock wave that trav-

els along the ground, toppling creatures and loose objects

within 20 feet. The area is conelike and extends beneath the

surface of the ground. (Any creatures above the surface are

not affected.) Any creature standing in the area that fails its

80

Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragons Hit Dice + dragons

Strength modifier) is thrown to the ground and takes 1d4

points of subdual damage. This ability is usable three times

per day. (When using the Psionics Handbook, replace this abil-

ity with the psionic power stomp.)

Body Equilibrium (Sp): Once per day, the dragon can

adjust its body equilibrium to correspond with any solid or

liquid. Thus, it can walk on water, quick-

sand, or even a spiders web with-

out sinking or breaking through.

(This does not confer any resistance

to particularly sticky webs.) Move-

ment is at normal speed, but run-

ning on a fragile, mushy, or liquid

surface requires a Dexterity check

(DC 10 or more, depending on

the  surface)  to  avoid  breaking

through. Falling damage is

halved while this power is

in effect. Body equilibrium

lasts 1 minute per age cate-

gory. (When using the Psionics

Handbook, replace this ability

with the psionic power

body equilibrium.)

Psionics (Sp): 1/day

invisibility, suggestion. Caster

(or  manifester) level varies by age; save DC 10 +

dragons Charisma modifier + spell (or power) level.

Attack/Defense Modes: ego whip/mental barrier. An amethyst

dragon manifests powers, and gains additional attack and

defense modes, as if it were a psion with Psychokinesis as

its primary discipline.

Crystal dragons are the friendliest of the gem dragons.

They are always curious about the world, so they enthusias-

tically converse with willing visitors.

A wyrmling crystal dragons scales are glossy white. As it

ages, its scales become translucent. Moonlight and starlight

cause them to luminesce, and full sunlight lends them a daz-

zling brilliance.

Crystal dragons prefer the Elemental Plane of Air, but

they sometimes build incredible ice palaces atop high, cold

mountain peaks on the Material Plane, where they can

watch the stars and create sculptures out of ice and snow.

White dragons and crystal dragons sometimes come into

conflict. Crystal dragons have been known to make off

with white dragon eggs, possibly to foster the white wyrm-

lings and help them grow into friendlier dragons than they

would otherwise become. Such white dragons are extremely

rare, and the introduction of such creatures into a cam-

paign is the purview of the DM. Crystal dragons tend to

bear great enmity toward any local giants, since the latter

occasionally join forces with white dragons to hunt for crys-

tal dragon lairs or wyrmlings.

Combat

A crystal dragon rarely instigates a fight without cause. If a

visitor is intriguing or seems friendly, the dragon attempts a

conversation; otherwise it tries to avoid a meeting. If visitors

dare to attack, however, a crystal dragon does not hesitate to

respond in kind. It often uses its breath weapon first to

weaken and blind foes, then takes to the air to make use of

its psionic abilities and any other ranged attacks it has.

Breath Weapon (Su): A crystal dragons breath weapon

is a cone of brilliant light. A target who fails his or her

Reflex saving throw takes the indicated damage and is

blinded for 1d4 rounds.

Emerald dragons are inquisitive, particularly about local his-

tory and customs. Often, their knowledge of particular areas

surpasses that of the best sage. However, these dragons are

also rather paranoid, so developing even a passing acquain-

tance with one can be quite difficult.

The scales of a wyrmling emerald dragon are translu-

cent and sea-green. As it ages, its scales harden and take

on every shade of green from deep emerald to mint, and

they scintillate in even the dimmest light. An emerald

dragons pupils fade as it ages, so by

the time it becomes a great wyrm,

its eyes are featureless, glow-

ing, green orbs.

The  typical  emerald

dragon  likes  to  settle

near an area that is at

least partly inhabited

by civilized beings

(of any type), but

not so near that

its presence becomes

generally known.

On  the  Material

Plane, such dragons

make their lairs in the cones

of extinct (or seldom active)

volcanoes. While on the Inner

Planes,  these  dragons  still

watch their favored Ma-

terial Plane spots.

Emerald dragons nurture their wyrmlings, so any given

lair of a young adult or older dragon is likely to include at

least one wyrmling.

Combat

Emerald dragons are quite distrustful of visitors, and their

lairs bristle with hidden traps and both magic and mun-

dane alarms. Should these measures fail to deter visitors,

an emerald dragon first hides (with improved invisibility, if

available), but reveals its presence if its treasure or its

hatchlings are discovered.

When attacking, an emerald dragon prefers to blind its

opponents with fog cloud, and then charge (or if it is flying,

snatch up its opponents). These dragons are the least re-

luctant of all the gem dragons to engage foes in melee

before thoroughly softening them up from a distance.

Against seafaring opponents, an emerald dragon usually

either conjures up a storm or uses its tail to smash all the ves-

sels it can reach (first the masts, then the hulls). If the crea-

ture is inclined toward leniency, it might merely becalm the

ships, leave them fogbound, or snap some of their masts

before allowing them to limp to safety. Alternatively, an

emerald dragon might simply herd the nearly helpless ships

to a location of its choice, thoroughly examine the crew and

cargo, then either loot the vessel or hold the ship and its

contents for ransom.

Breath Weapon (Su): An emerald dragon breathes a

cone of keening sonic energy. In addition to making a

Reflex saving throw against sonic damage, each creature

within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (same DC)

or be deafened for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per age cate-

gory of the dragon.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willlegend lore; 3/dayfog

cloud, improved invisibility, sculpt sound. (When using the

Psionics Handbook, replace legend lore with the object reading

psionic power, replace sculpt sound with the control sound

psionic power, and replace improved invisibility with the aug-

mented invisibility psionic power.) Caster level varies with

age; save DC 10 + dragons Charisma modifier + spell level.

Psionics (Sp): 3/daynondetection, clairaudience/clairvoy-

ance. Caster (or manifester) level varies by age; save DC 10 +

dragons Charisma modifier + spell (or power) level.

Attack/Defense Modes: id insinuation, psychic crush/thought

shield, tower of iron will. An emerald dragon manifests

powers, and gains additional attack and defense modes, as if

it were a psion with Clairsentience as its primary discipline.

Shield of Prudence (Sp): A great wyrm emerald dragon can

extend its awareness a few fractions of a second into the

future. This ability gives it a +6 insight bonus to AC for 6

hours. If it is caught flat-footed, it still gains a +4 insight

bonus to AC. Shield of prudence is usable three times per day.

(When using the Psionics Handbook, replace this with the

shield of prudence psionic power.)

Sapphire  dragons  are

quite territorial, particu-

larly when it comes to

other  dragons  that  en-

croach on their territories,

either on the Elemental

Plane of Earth, or in the

areas of the Material Plane

that they call their own.

Sapphire dragons

tend  to  be  anti-

social  toward  all

beings, but they view the

evil races of the Underdark as particular enemies and some-

times come into direct conflict with them over under-

ground territory. These dragons dont go in for small talk

unless the discussion revolves around military strategy, a

Sapphire Dragons by Age

subject on which they consider themselves experts, if not

geniuses. In fact, a sapphire dragon may forgive visitors

their presence if they offer it a game of strategy. Of course, it

is never wise to let the dragon lose.

A sapphire dragons scales range from light to dark blue in

color, and they scintillate in any light, creating a cascade of

ghostly glints on the walls of the caverns in which these

creatures often lair. Unlike the scales of other gem dragons,

those of a sapphire dragon do not change as the creature

ages. Its pupils fade with time, however, so by the time it

becomes a great wyrm, its eyes are featureless, glowing, sap-

phire orbs.

Sapphire dragons love the Elemental Plane of Earth, but

they also like to lair in deep, dry, rocky caverns on the Mate-

rial Plane. The typical sapphire dragon uses move earth and

stone shape to hide the entrance to its lair. Inside, it spreads

out its treasures through several

chambers, arranging them in

a somewhat decorative

manner. Drow, illithid,

and aboleth trophies are

often prominently dis-

played to remind the dragon

of its past victories over its

enemies. A sapphire dragon

often  allows  Large  mon-

strous spiders to roam its

lair,  but  only  as  a  handy

source of food. To keep such

creatures close, the dragon

also  frequently  allows

their

favorite  prey

species to inhabit por-

tions of its lair.

Combat

A sapphire dragon uses

its spider climb and tele-

port abilities to confuse its opponents and try to catch them

flat-footed. It also uses its skate ability to enhance its own

movement or push heavy objects down slopes at its enemies.

It enjoys panicking creatures with its breath weapon, then

using its skate ability to facilitate their departure.

Breath Weapon (Su): A sapphire dragon breathes a cone

of nearly inaudible sonic energy. In addition to making a

Reflex saving throw against sonic damage, each creature

within the cone must succeed at a Will save (same DC) or

become panicked for 1d4 rounds.

Spider Climb (Ex): A sapphire dragon can climb on

stone surfaces as though using the spider climb spell. This

ability is always active.

Sense Psychoportation (Su): The dragon can sense the

use of any power or spell that enhances movement or allows

instant transit from one place to another. This ability is

always active, and it functions at a range of 100 feet + 10 feet

per caster level of the detected power or spell. The dragon

does not need a line of sight; it is instantly aware of the dis-

tance and direction to the detected power. (When using the

Psionics Handbook, replace this ability with the sense psy-

choportation psionic power.)

Skate (Sp): This  ability  allows  the  sapphire  dragon,

another willing creature, or an unattended object to slide

along any solid surface with no friction. An intelligent crea-

ture can control its movement by thought alone, skating,

turning, or stopping as desired. The subjects base speed is its

normal speed + 15 feet. The subject can move up or down

inclines that he or she could otherwise walk on, but skating

upward reduces speed to normal, while skating downward

adds 30 feet (instead of 15) to the skaters speed. An object

under the influence of the skate effect can be dragged across

the ground as if it weighed only one-tenth its normal

weight. This ability is usable three times per day. (When

using the Psionics Handbook, replace this ability with the skate

psionic power.)

Spell-Like Abilities: 2/daystone shape; 1/daymove

earth, wall of stone. Caster level varies by age; save DC 10 +

dragons Charisma modifier + spell level.

Psionics (Sp): 1/dayteleport. Caster (or manifester)

level varies by age; save DC 10 + dragons Charisma mod-

ifier + spell (or power) level.

Attack/Defense Modes: id insinuation, ego whip/thought shield,

empty mind. A sapphire dragon manifests powers, and gains

additional attack and defense modes, as if it were a psion

with Psychoportation as its primary discipline.

Skills: A sapphire dragon has the Climb skill for free at 1

rank per Hit Die.

and bronze dragons often come into conflict. Duels between

the two are always furious and deadly.

Combat

Topaz dragons generally dislike intruders, but they prefer to

begin any potential confrontation with conversation. They

quickly attack intruders who prove either hostile or boring.

When outdoors, a topaz dragon prefers to express its dis-

pleasure first through its wind and weather control abilities,

then with physical attacks. Indoors, it usually leads off with

its breath weapon.

Breath Weapon (Su): A topaz dragon breathes a cone of

dehydration that looks like a watery blast. When directed

against an aqueous liquid (water or a liquid composed

mainly of water), this effect evaporates one cubic foot of

water per hit point of damage dealt. Each creature within

the cone takes the indicated damage, or half that amount

with a successful Reflex save.

Water Breathing (Ex): Topaz dragons breathe water as

readily as air.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daycontrol winds, fog cloud;

1/daycontrol weather. Caster level varies by age; save DC

10 + dragons Charisma modifier + spell level. (When

using the Psionics Handbook, replace control winds with the

control air psionic power.)

Psionics (Sp): 3/dayshapechange; 2/dayfeather fall.

Caster (or manifester) level varies by age; save DC 10 + dragons

Charisma modifier + spell (or power) level.

Attack/Defense Modes: mind thrust, ego whip/thought shield,

mental barrier. A topaz dragon manifests powers, and gains

additional attack and defense modes, as if it were a psion

with Psychometabolism as its primary discipline.

Skills: A topaz dragon has the Swim skill for free at 1 rank

per Hit Die.

A dread guard appears to be an armored undead, still bear-

ing the weapons and shield it carried in life. In fact, it is an

animated suit of armor, little different from a golem. Those

who create dread guards usually do so to obtain guardians

for their strongholdsguardians that can never be bribed

and rarely fooled.

A dread guard obeys simple commands from its creator,

but these are limited to one or two rudimentary concepts.

Typical orders include Stay in this room and attack anyone

but me who enters, and Kill each person who opens this

chest until I tell you otherwise.

A dread guard never speaks, but it understands com-

mands in its creators language.

COMBAT

Dread guards attack mindlessly with their weapons. They

are unsubtle and straightforward in combat.

Construct Traits: A dread guard is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works

on objects. The creature is

not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage,

ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or

death from massive dam-

age. It cannot heal itself

but  can  be  healed

through  repair.  It

cannot be raised or

resurrected. A dread

guard has darkvision

(60-foot range).

CONSTRUCTION

A dread guard may be constructed from any suit of master-

work heavy armor, and a Medium-size one may wield any

Medium-size or Large martial weapon. A Large dread guard

may wield any Large or Huge martial weapon.

The cost of creating a dread guard is 40,000 gp. This amount

includes the cost of a masterwork suit of heavy armor and,

if desired, a masterwork shield. Construction requires a

martial weapon, but it need not be a masterwork

weapon. Assembling the body requires a success-

ful Craft (armorsmithing) check (DC 25).

The creator must be at least 15th level

and able to cast arcane spells. Completing

the ritual drains 800 XP from the creator and

requires the fabricate, geas/quest, and polymorph

any object spells.

Dune stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of

Earth, though they are also frequently found on the Gray

Waste of Hades. These monsters revel in evil and take their

only joy from spreading its blight. They despise the Material

Plane and avoid it as much as possible. Even so, they are

sometimes summoned there by evil characters to kill targets

or carry out other quests.

A dune stalker appears humanoid. It stands approximately

7 feet tall, but it would be taller if stretched out or forced to

stand erect. Its head is triangular, and the neck attaches near

the top of the head, causing its leering, toothy face and

E

L

A

S

pointed chin

to  hang  below  its

shoulders. The dune stalkers gangly body is hairless, and its

red, dusty, abrasive skin has no pores. The combination of

short legs, long arms, and stooped posture causes its hands to

drag on the ground. Its fingers and toes (four on each limb)

are long and bony. The creature has massive shoulders and an

enormous chest, which tapers to a narrow waist and hips.

A dune stalker that has been assigned a mission by its

summoner pursues the literal fulfillment of its instructions

to the exclusion of all else. It resents its time on the Material

Plane and wants to make its stay there as short as possible.

Occasionally, a summoners instructions are phrased in such

a way that the dune stalker cannot actually carry them out.

In this case, it is trapped on the Material Plane, where it

takes out its frustration by killing all creatures it finds.

Despite their sonic abilities, dune stalkers do not speak,

though they understand Common and Terran.

COMBAT

A dune stalkers preferred tactic is to hide in a rocky area

and attack from ambush. When possible, it tries to gain

higher ground on its opponents by climbing up on a rock or a

structure to conceal itself.

It often begins an assault by using its shout ability to dis-

orient a group of opponents, then leaping into combat to

deliver its kiss of death. Against foes within its reach, a dune

stalker usually prefers to deliver a kiss of death against just

one target rather than a shout against the whole group. The

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:48 PM  Page 89

preferred target is the one it seeks to slay, or the one that

presents the greatest danger, or the one that appears to have

the strongest good alignment. (Given the dune stalkers

demented psychology, this last could be just about anyone,

but paladins usually stand out.)

Kiss of Death (Su): The kiss of death is a sonic and death

effect delivered with the dune stalkers face pressed directly

against the victims. If the dune stalker makes a successful

melee touch attack (+9 melee), the opponent must attempt a

Fortitude saving throw (DC 15). Success leaves the oppo-

nent stunned for 1 round; failure sets up lethal vibrations in

the opponents body that result in instant death. This ability

is usable at will.

Shout (Sp): Three times per day, the dune stalker can

create an effect identical to that of a shout spell (caster level

6th; Fort save DC 14), except that the actual sound produced

resembles a loud, rasping cough.

Improved Tracking (Ex): A consummate tracker, the

dune stalker tracks as well as an invisible stalker does. Like

that creature, it uses Spot checks rather than Wilderness

Lore checks to follow its quarrys trail.

Jump (Ex): A dune stalker can produce a jump effect

(caster level 6th) at will.

Outsider Traits: A dune stalker has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Skills: A dune stalker gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimi-

date checks.

An effigy is an envious undead that hates living creatures

and lusts after the life energy they possess. It seeks to possess

a living creature and take over its life, but it cannot maintain

its usurped body for long. Eventually the fires of its own raw

hatred literally immolate the body it has possessed.

An effigy appears as a translucent humanoid shape com-

posed of multicolored flame. Its eyes glow white within the

flickering fires of its insubstantial body, but it has no other

discernible facial features.

COMBAT

An effigy seeks to join its undead force with the body of a

living host, which it then burns out from within. It need not

be joined with a body to attack, but it often keeps its most

recent bodys ashes animated within its fiery heart.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature struck by an

effigys incorporeal touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude

saving throw (DC 26) or gain two negative levels. For each

negative level bestowed, the effigy heals 5 points of damage.

If the amount of healing is more than the damage the crea-

ture has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. If

the negative level has not been

removed (with a spell such as

restoration) before 24

hours have passed,

the afflicted oppo-

nent must suc-

ceed at a Forti-

tude save (DC

26) to remove it.

VR

89

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:48 PM  Page 90

Failure means the opponents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced

by one.

Infuse (Su): When an effigy hits a humanoid or mon-

strous humanoid that is no more than two size categories

larger than itself with its incorporeal touch attack, the

opponent must make a successful Will save (DC 26) or

become infused with the effigys spirit. The effects of infu-

sion on the opponent are similar to those of a magic jar spell,

except as noted here. Upon infusion, the effigy gains con-

trol of the infused creature. While infused, it uses the

bodys physical ability scores but its own mental ability

scores. It also uses whatever attack forms the subject has

available. Such attacks still do 2d6 points of additional fire

damage, but they do not bestow negative levels.

An infused effigy automatically deals fire damage and

inflicts energy drain on its host body each round. The sub-

ject dies upon reaching 10 hit points or dropping below 1st

level. At that point, the body becomes a flaming corpse.

Each round after infusion occurs, the subject must

make an opposed Wisdom check against the effigy. Suc-

cess casts the effigy out, forcing it to retreat 30 feet. There-

after, it may not attempt to infuse the same target again

for 1 round per point of difference between the check

results. A failed save leaves the effigy in control of the

body. If an effigy is turned while infused in a host, it aban-

dons the body to flee.

Fire Subtype (Ex): An effigy is immune to fire damage

but takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for

half damage is allowed. In that case, it takes half damage on

a success and double damage on a failure.

Incorporeal Subtype: An effigy can be harmed only by

other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons,

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The

creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a cor-

poreal source, except for force effects or attacks made with

ghost touch weapons. An effigy can pass through solid

objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natu-

ral armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and

force effects work normally against them. An effigy always

moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it

doesnt wish to be.

Undead Traits: An effigy is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to criti-

cal hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. An effigy

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

ELEMENTAL WEIRD

Weirds are cryptic beings of elemental force who are power-

ful in the art of divination. They are oracles, soothsayers, and

seers of knowledge past, present, and future. Each weird is

composed of material from one of the four elements (air,

earth, fire, or water) and has special knowledge of the par-

ticular aspect of fate with which its element is associated

(see below). These creatures dwell in remote or hidden loca-

tions on the Material Planea fact that makes travel diffi-

cult for those seeking their counsel.

The upper body of a weird always resembles that of a

beautiful female humanoid. The lower half may be either

humanoid or a serpentine column. A weird rises from a pool

of the appropriate element, which it can never leave.

A weird can divine information that could change the very

course of history. It has its finger on the pulse of fate and

knows exactly where possible courses of action might lead.

Like most seers, an elemental weird never provides a clear,

concise prophecy. Some of the message may seem forthright,

but some is always confusing or just difficult to decipher

because the listener does not have enough information to

understand the weirds meaning. Though its messages can be

misinterpreted, a weirds warnings and advice are never

wrong. Its counsel is seldom free, however, so anyone

beseeching a weird had best bring offerings or be prepared to

undertake a quest of vital importance to the creature.

A weird can communicate with any creature that has a

language.

COMBAT

Elemental weirds do not fight if they can avoid it. If they

must fight, they begin by summoning elementals to defend

them. If any other elementals are present (regardless of

type), the weird attempts to gain control of them and turn

them against its foes. Meanwhile, the weird remains in the

center of its pool, using divination magic to foresee possible

consequences of the battle and acting accordingly.

If forced into melee, a weird uses its reach to lash out at

nearby foes. If seriously threatened, a weird retreats back to

its plane of origin.

Elemental Command (Su): A weird can attempt to

gain control over any elemental within 100 feet regardless

of the latters elemental type. The elemental must make a

successful Will save (DC 23) or succumb to the weirds

control. An elemental that saves against this attack is

immune to that weirds elemental command ability for 24

hours. There is no limit to the number of elementals that a

weird can control.

Once under the weirds control, an elemental serves the

weird until either it or the weird dies, until the weird dis-

misses it, or until the duration for its summoning expires.

It obeys the weird explicitly, even if ordered to attack the

being who originally summoned it. The weird does not

need to concentrate to maintain control over any elemen-

tal it commands.

Elemental Pool (Su): Each weird dwells within a large

pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the

purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a

flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for

possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow

within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth

91

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:48 PM  Page 92

to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist

as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same ele-

ment; for example, a water weirds pool might be situated at

the bottom of an ocean or lake.

The base of the pool contains a portal to the weirds native

plane. Three times per day, the weird can summon forth 2d4

huge elementals, 1d2 greater elementals, or 1 elder elemen-

tal through this portal. Any nonelemental creature entering

a pool without the weirds permission must succeed at a

Fortitude save (DC 20) each round or be irrevocably trans-

formed into the elemental material of the pool. Creatures

granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to

transformation. However, creatures allowed to

enter a pool must still provide their own protection

from the elemental material, as well as the means

to breathe and move within that enviroment. Oth-

erwise, they suffer the effects given in the indi-

vidual entry.

hair appears windblown. The lower half of the creatures

body is a tendril of mist that trails back into its pool.

Spells: An air weird can cast arcane spells and divine

spells from the Air and Travel domains as an 18th-level sor-

cerer  (spells  known  9/5/5/4/4/4/3/3/2/1;  spells/day

6/8/8/7/7/7/7/6/5/3; save DC 16 + spell level).

Air Mastery (Ex): An air weird gains a +1 bonus on

attack and damage rolls if its foe is airborne.

Air Pool: An air weirds pool is filled with billowing, gust-

ing vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without

the ability to fly cannot move through it,

except by falling. An air weirds pool may

be affixed to any vertical or horizontal sur-

face, and it may be right side up or upside

down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example).

Breathsense (Ex): An air weird can auto-

matically sense the location of any

breathing creature within 60 feet.

A weird is physically tied to

its pool and cannot leave except

to return to its native plane

through the portal. A weird

may rise up to a height of

10 feet above the surface

of its pool, but the lower

part of its body must always

remain in contact with the

elemental  material.  Once  a

weird exits the pool for its native

plane, the portal closes, and the

pool loses its special effects.

Elemental Traits (Ex): An ele-

mental weird is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not

subject to critical hits or flanking, and

it cannot be raised or resurrected.

The creature also has darkvision

(60-foot range).

Prescience (Su): At will and as

JJ

a free action, a weird can duplicate the

effect of any of the following divination

spells: analyze dweomer, clairaudience/clairvoyance, contact other

plane, detect thoughts, discern location, find the path, foresight,

greater scrying, legend lore, locate creature, locate object, tongues,

true seeing, vision. Caster level 18th; save DC 16 + spell level.

AIR WEIRD

Air weirds are elemental spirits that offer direction and

guidance to those traveling into unknown areas. They can

point out paths not considered, reveal unknown doors into

new worlds, and describe what may be needed to survive

such journeys. An air weirds pool is often found outside, in

an open-air place such as a windy plain or on a mountaintop.

An air weird appears as a ghostly, translucent woman

composed of flowing vapors. Its eyes are deep blue, and its

EARTH WEIRD

Earth weirds are foretellers of death and

doom. They can pronounce an individuals

impending fate or warn of a coming apocalypse.

They are also prognosticators

of wealth and fortune, fore-

seeing who shall succeed or

fail in the pursuit of material posses-

sions. An earth weirds pool is often situated at the

base of a mountain or deep underground.

An earth weirds upper body resembles that of a

beautiful human woman. The creature has sparkling

gemstones for eyes and hair the brown color of

earth, streaked with veins of gold and silver. The

lower body is a shifting column of stone and dirt

that connects to the earth pool.

Spells: An earth weird can cast

arcane  spells  and  divine

spells from the Earth and

Destruction domains as an

18th-level sorcerer (spells known

9/5/5/4/4/4/3/3/2/1; spells/day 6/8/8/7/7/7/7/6/5/3;

save DC 16 + spell level).

Earth Mastery (Ex): An earth weird gains a +1 bonus on

attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching the ground.

Earth Pool: This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks,

and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird)

takes 4d8 points of damage per round from the ever-grinding

earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if

they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (unable

to move) if they cannot burrow. An earth weirds pool may be

affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in

a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern).

Tremorsense (Ex): An earth weird can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  2:48 PM  Page 93

FIRE WEIRD

Fire weirds are the diviners of hope. They shed light when

all is dark and illuminate lore that has been long lost and

nearly forgotten. They guide the long-suffering and igno-

rant to new peace and prosperity.

The beautiful, feminine half of a fire weird is a humanoid

form composed of flickering flames and wreathed with

smoke. The lower half of the body snakes away in a fiery trail

into the hazy, flame-filled pool.

Burn (Ex): Any creature that is hit by the fire weirds slam

attack (or that hits the

fire weird with a natural

weapon or an unarmed

attack) must succeed at a

Reflex save (DC 20) or

catch fire (see Catching

on Fire in Chapter 3 of

the DUNGEON MASTERS

Guide). The fire burns for

1d4 rounds.

Spells: A fire weird

can cast arcane spells and

divine spells from the

Fire and Sun domains as

(spells known 9/5/5/4/

4/4/3/3/2/1; spells/day

Fire Pool: This pool

contains  a  torrent  of

dancing flames that burn

and smoke continually.

Unprotected flammable

materials  within  a  fire

pool catch on fire imme-

diately, and any creature

within  the  pool  takes

3d10 points of fire dam-

age per round. Creatures

without the ability to fly

cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire

weirds pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal sur-

face, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such

as on the floor of a cavern).

Fire Subtype (Ex): A fire weird is immune to fire

damage but takes double damage from cold unless a

saving throw for half damage is allowed. In that case, the

creature takes half damage on a success and double dam-

age on a failure.

WATER WEIRD

Water weirds are soothsayers that bring words of healing

to the wounded. They offer curative knowledge for suf-

fering lands and new options for people who seek a

better way. When there is little hope for life, water weirds

offer a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against

all odds.

A water weird appears as a translucent, blue humanoid

woman composed entirely of water. Its feet remain below

the surface of its pool at all times.

Drench (Ex): A water weirds touch puts out torches,

campfires, and other open flames of its own size category or

smaller, as long as they are nonmagical.

Spells: A water weird can cast arcane spells and divine

spells from the Water and

Healing  domains  as  an

18th-level sorcerer (spells

known 9/5/5/4/4/4/3/3/

2/1; spells/day 6/8/8/7/

Water Mastery (Ex): A

water  weird  gains  a  +1

bonus on attack and dam-

age rolls if its opponent is

touching water.

Water Pool: This pool

is  filled  with  bubbling,

swirling water. Any crea-

ture within it that cannot

breathe water immediately

begins to drown (see The

Drowning Rule in Chapter

3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide). Any creature with-

out the ability to swim can-

not move through a water

pool, except by falling. A

water weirds pool may be

affixed only to a horizontal

surface, and it may appear

only in a right side up posi-

tion (such as on the floor

of a cavern).

WEIRD SOCIETY

All weirds, regardless of their elemental subtypes, are con-

nected to each other in fundamental ways. They share a

unique, secret bond that is evidenced in their level of coop-

eration. A weird that cannot provide the desired knowledge

to a supplicant usually guides him or her to another weird

for better counsel. Weirds of different elements often place

their pools close to one another to broaden the range of div-

ination services available to supplicants in an area.

Weirds are strongly linked to the Material Plane. They

have all chosen to leave their native planes and serve as

diviners for the humanoid races. Though they are bound to

their pools, weirds can interact with other races though

mortal agents that specialize in divination magic.

These panicky, harmless-looking beetles are native to the

Ethereal Plane. A wide variety of ethereal predators eat ether

scarabs, so the latter have developed the ability to flee across

planar boundaries. They often appear on the Material Plane

next to buildings or other large objects near which they

have made their lairs on the Ethereal Plane.

An ether scarab has six tentaclelike legs and a hard,

amethyst-veined, chitinous shell marked by

swirling, colorful pat-

terns. It sports

two pairs of

DR

94

vicious-looking mandibles, which it uses to tear through

planar boundaries.

COMBAT

The timid ether scarab almost always runs from trouble. If

forced into battle, it bites with its mandibles. Ether scarabs

do not enjoy the gravity of the Material Plane, so they return

to their home plane as soon as it is safe to do so.

Wounding (Ex): A wound resulting from an ether scarabs

bite attack bleeds for an additional 1 point of damage per

round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in

cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage

per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a

successful Heal check (DC 10) or the application of a cure spell

or some other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).

Death Burst (Ex): An ether scarab that dies on the Mater-

ial Plane explodes harmlessly, causing a planar rip (see above)

between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. This hole

in the planar fabric lasts 1d4+1 rounds.

Outsider Traits: An ether scarab has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Planar Rip (Su): By ripping at the planar fabric with its

mandibles, an ether scarab can create a two-way portal

between its own plane and another (usually the Material).

This hole between the planes appears tiny, but it can accom-

modate any Large or smaller creature traveling in either

direction. A planar rip closes in 1d4+1 rounds.

Ethereal doppelgangers live on the Ethereal Plane, in

buildings that serve as combination showrooms, vaults,

prisons, and shops. Ethereal doppelgangers are fond of

magic items, and they frequently visit the Material Plane

to acquire new ones for their collections. During their

stays there, they usually disguise themselves as members

of some other race. An ethereal doppelganger often inter-

acts with or joins an adventuring party that it believes can

lead it to, or near, a magic item it desires.

In its natural form, an ethereal doppelganger appears as a

gangly humanoid with slick skin and white eyes that have

no pupils. While traveling on the Material Plane, it usually

takes the form of an attractive member of the same race as

the group it has joined.

An ethereal doppelganger speaks Common, Infernal,

and at least one elemental language (Auran, Aquan, Ignan,

or Terran).

COMBAT

When it plans an extended stay on the

Material Plane, an ethereal doppel-

ganger uses its brain lock ability to

render a chosen subject helpless,

then takes that creature back to its

floating home on the Ethereal Plane.

In its sanctum, the doppelganger

makes the subject comfortable and

offers a deal. If the subject allows the

doppelganger  to  assume  his  or  her

identity and acquire the desired item,

the doppelganger will ensure the sub-

jects  comfort  in  the  interim  and

return him or her unharmed to any

desired location on the Material

Plane afterward. If the subject

refuses, the doppelganger wipes

any memory of itself from the

subjects mind, returns the crea-

ture to the Material Plane, and

tries  again  with  a  new  subject.

Should the subject agree to the deal

and then attempt to escape, the doppel-

ganger sells him or her into extraplanar slavery. But if the

subject accepts the agreement and complies with its terms,

the doppelganger is as good as its word.

Assume Identity (Su): An ethereal doppelganger can

absorb another creatures mind, memories, and personal-

ity. This process requires 1 hour of unbroken physical con-

tact per level or Hit Die of the subject. The target may

attempt a Will save (DC 22); if that is successful, the

process is negated and the ethereal doppelganger must

begin again. A willing creature can choose to waive the

saving throw.

After consuming the target creatures identity, the ethe-

real doppelganger can assume its form with 100% accuracy.

The doppelganger possesses the other creatures memories,

plus its alignment and all of its abilities, except for cleric

spells of 2nd level or higher, a paladins special abilities, and

other powers granted by deities. (This does not deprive the

subject of those memories or abilities; it only duplicates

them in the ethereal doppelganger.) The doppelganger

retains its own damage resistance, darkvision, fast healing,

and spell resistance in its new form.

If an ethereal doppelganger commits an act that runs

counter to its new identitys alignment, it is immediately

forced back into its natural form for 1d10 rounds. It still

retains the basic memories of the assumed identity, though

not the deeper memories. If the subject dies before the con-

tract is complete, the ethereal doppelganger immediately

reverts to its natural form and loses all of that subjects mem-

ories and abilities.

Brain Lock (Su): As a standard

action, an ethereal doppelganger

can lock away the higher mind of an

opponent up to 300 feet away, pro-

vided both are on the same plane

and the doppelganger has line of

sight to its subject. A successful

Will  save  (DC  22)  negates  the

attempt; failure leaves the subject

mentally paralyzed. A brain-locked

creature is not stunned, so attack-

ers get no special advantage against

it. Furthermore, it can still defend

itself  against  attacks  (its  Dexterity

bonus to AC, if any, still applies), but it

cannot move or initiate any actions. A

brain lock can negate various forms of

special movement and cause harm to

the creature thereby. For example, a

brain-locked flying creature falls

because it cannot flap its wings,

and a brain-locked swimming crea-

ture may drown because it can no

longer move its limbs. The effect

lasts  20  rounds,  but  it  can  be  dis-

missed earlier.

Mind Wipe (Su): With any successful melee touch

attack, an ethereal doppelganger can wipe all memory of its

existence from an opponents mind (no saving throw).

Fast Healing (Ex): An ethereal doppelganger regains lost

hit points at the rate of 3 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow the ethereal doppelganger to regrow or

reattach lost body parts.

Plane Shift (Sp): An ethereal doppelganger can use plane

shift (caster level 20th; Will save DC 17) at will.

Ethereal slayers are carnivorous predators that lie in

ambush on the Ethereal Plane, waiting for unwitting crea-

tures to enter. They typically

wait in spots

that have significant cross-planar traffic, such as beside

Material Plane buildings that are rich in magical auras. If

several attempts have already been made to access a par-

ticular Material Plane location via ethereal travel, there is

a good chance that a slayer has taken notice and gravitated

to that spot.

A spiny, chitinous shell armors an ethereal slayers body,

and four mandibles surround its drooling mouth. It has

two thick, birdlike legs and two arms that end in wicked,

four-foot claws, like those of a praying mantis.

COMBAT

Ethereal slayers are ambush predators. They use their detect

magic ability to locate strong magical auras, then wait near

them for creatures to travel past on the Ethereal Plane.

When a creature appears nearby, the slayer uses its dimen-

sional anchor ability to fix its prey on the Ethereal Plane,

then attacks with its claws. Should its opponent manage to

flee to the Material Plane, the slayer uses its plane shift abil-

ity to pursue.

Detect Magic (Su): An ethereal slayer can produce a

detect magic effect (caster level 9th) at will.

Dimensional Anchor (Su): An ethereal slayer can pro-

duce a dimensional anchor effect (caster level 9th) at will.

Outsider Traits: An ethereal slayer has darkvision (60-

foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Plane Shift (Su): Twice per day, an ethereal slayer can

produce a plane shift effect (caster level 9th; self only; save

DC 14).

The famine spirit, also called a ravenous ghoul, is a corpo-

real undead motivated entirely by hunger. It seeks to con-

sume in death all that it was denied in life. It eats every-

thing and anything that a living being could, but its

hunger is never sated. A famine spirit can consume the

comestibles  of  a  Mordenkainens  magnificent  mansion

(caster level 14th) in a mere 5 hours and still be hungry

for more. In a day, it can consume as many as one hun-

dred humans.

A famine spirit appears as an obscenely obese human-

oid or monstrous humanoid with a mouth full of

razor-sharp teeth. Should the need present itself, a

famine spirit can unhinge its jaw to swallow objects

too large for it to consume normally.

Undead are among the few creatures that a famine

spirit does not eat, so it may attract groups of ghouls and

ghasts that serve it and feast in its wake.

COMBAT

Famine spirits ignore most other living things, turning on

them only if they get in the way of its feasting, or if there

is nothing else to consume. It fights primarily with its

jaws, attempting to bite off the heads of any opponents.

Aura of Pain (Su): The famine spirit radiates a continual

symbol of pain effect (save DC 28) as a 60-foot-radius emana-

tion. A creature that fails its save is affected while within

the area and for 10 minutes after leaving it. A successful

save makes a creature immune to that famine spirits aura of

pain for 24 hours.

Vorpal Bite (Ex): The bite of a famine spirit severs the

head of a Large or smaller opponent on a critical hit.

Create Spawn (Su): A famine spirit rarely leaves corpses

in its wake, but sometimes it is forced to flee and leave slain

opponents behind. Each of these corpses rises in 1d3 days as

a famine spirit, unless a protection from evil spell is cast upon

it before that time.

Ethereal Jaunt (Su): Three times per day, a famine spirit

can produce an ethereal jaunt effect (caster level 20th). It uses

this ability primarily to enter storehouses or to deal with

ethereal interlopers.

See Invisibility (Su): A famine spirit can see invisible

objects and beings as if under the effect of a see invisibility

spell. This ability is always active.

Undead Traits: A famine spirit is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It

is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. A famine spirit cannot be raised, and resurrection

works only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-

foot range).

FELLDRAKE

The small, wingless dragons known as felldrakes trace their

origin to Bahamut the Platinum Dragon. After helping a

group of powerful elf wizards turn back a demonic invasion,

Bahamut created the felldrakes to guard the elves against fu-

ture incursions. All felldrakes have the blood of Bahamut in

their veins and are fierce, loyal, and good at heart.

Felldrakes speak Draconic and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Felldrakes are impulsive attackers. Aggressive and eager to

fight, they seek to close with opponents immediately.

Dragon Traits: Felldrakes are immune to sleep and paral-

ysis effects. They have darkvision (60-foot range) and low-

light vision.

CRESTED FELLDRAKE

Elves often employ crested felldrakes as guards for settle-

ments and in border patrols.

A crested felldrake looks like a small, wingless dragon

with powerful hind legs and a bright crest on its head.

Combat

When crested felldrakes fight in a group, some charge into

battle and try to pin down the enemy, while their comrades

move to encircle the foe.

SPITTING FELLDRAKE

Combat

Because of its snaky body, a spitting felldrake can squeeze

through small spaces. Thus, it is ideal for the underground

expeditions so contrary to elven nature.

The spitting felldrake is slightly

larger than its crested cousin. Its

body is long and sinuous, like

that of a snake.

Horned felldrakes usually charge foes first, then use their

horns in melee.

Combat

A spitting felldrake usually

pauses to spit acid before

closing to melee. It can spit

acid  up  to  30  feet  as  a

ranged touch attack with

no range increment.

HORNED FELLDRAKE

Horned felldrakes are often

used to protect important in-

dividuals or cities.

This creature is larger than

the  other  felldrakes.  Its  head

sports several horns, which it uses to

impale foes.

A fiendwurm is the result of demonic magic applied to an

ordinary earthworm. This tormented monster is constantly

wracked with unbearable pain from the planar portal embed-

ded in its belly. Eating relieves the creatures pain for a short

while, so it attempts to swallow any creature it encounters.

Its tortured existence keeps it constantly on the hunt.

A fiendwurm is a 40-foot-long, serpentine creature with a

mottled gray and pink hide. Its huge maw is filled with long,

snakelike fangs. The creature is never at rest; its intense pain

causes it to writhe and squirm constantly.

Fiendwurms are in such terrible agony that they are

unable to communicate at all.

COMBAT

A fiendwurm immediately lunges to bite and swallow any

living creature it chances upon. If it seems to be overmatched,

it uses its demonic belch ability to summon aid. A fiend-

wurm does not stop attacking until it is slain.

Death Rift (Su): Upon its death, a fiendwurms portal

implodes. Every creature within 5 feet of the fiendwurm

that fails a Reflex save (DC 31) is drawn into the collapsing

portal and transported to the Abyss. The implosion destroys

the fiendwurms body along with the portal. Thus, any crea-

tures transported to the Abyss via a death rift must find

another means of returning to their original planes.

Demonic Belch (Su): Three times per day, a fiendwurm

can use its connection with the Abyss to bring 1d4 demons

to its aid. It expels these crea-

tures  from  its  mouth

with a great belching

sound. The demons arrive

unharmed, but the fiendwurms

pain  may  cause  it  to  attack

them  thereafter,  if  they

seem to be easier prey than

the opponents, or if there

are no other creatures

left to eat. Roll d%

to determine the

kind  of  demons

that  arrive:  0150

jovocs, 5175 quasits,

76100 vrocks. These

demons  cannot  use

their summoning abili-

ties for one hour after being snatched out of the

Abyss. Once a fiendwurm uses this ability, it must wait 1d4

rounds before using it again.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a fiendwurm hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite

attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +49). If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow

the opponent in the next round. Alternatively, the fiend-

wurm has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but the fiendwurm is not considered grap-

pled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals bite damage.

Swallow  Whole  (Ex): A  fiendwurm  can  swallow  a

grabbed opponent that is at least two size categories smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +49). Once inside the fiendwurm, the opponent takes

2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d8 points of acid

damage per round from the creatures gizzard. A successful

grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of

the gizzard and return to the fiendwurms mouth, where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alter-

natively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with

either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing

at least 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20) in this way

creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a

single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the

hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own

way out. A Gargantuan fiendwurms gizzard can hold 2 Huge,

8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.

Acidic Hide (Ex): A fiendwurm produces a highly

caustic mucus that coats its entire body. Touching its hide

deals 3d6 points of acid damage to an organic creature or

object, 5d8 points of acid damage to a metallic creature or

object, or 1d10 points of acid damage to a stony creature

(such as an earth elemental) or object. A gallon or more of

water is needed to wash off the mucus.

Portal (Su): Lining the lowest part of the fiendwurms

gizzard is a portal to the Abyss that is activated by the pres-

ence of a living creature. A swallowed creature must make

a Reflex save (DC 31) each round to avoid falling into or

being squeezed through the portal. The Abyssal side of the

portal is stationary, but the other side moves with the

fiendwurm. If this portal is permanently closed, the fiend-

wurm instantly dies but does not implode.

Tremorsense (Ex): A fiendwurm can automatically

sense the location of anything within 120 feet that is in

contact with the ground.

FIHYR

Fihyrs are the collected fears of humanity made corporeal.

These creatures were once thought to be related to behold-

ers, but in fact there is no connection between the two kinds

of monsters aside from a superficial resemblance.

As the remnants of hundreds of peoples nightmares swirl

through the ether, they somehow combine with leftover magi-

cal power and coalesce into these physical monsters. A few

random dream images arent enough; it takes the strong emo-

tional energy of a mass of people under duress to spawn a fihyr.

The right combination of conditions is most often found in

cities that are under siege, or being terrorized by monsters, or

suffering from famine, civil war, or some other mass trauma.

Great fihyrs are larger, more intelligent, and much more

dangerous than the smaller variety. A great fihyr forms

when a number of small fihyrs combine.

All fihyrs have the same general appearance; the two kinds

differ mainly in size. A fihyr is a roughly spherical blob of soft

tissue and pulsating gray matter, much like a gigantic brain

with a partial layer of skin stretched over it. The body of a

fihyr is about 2 feet in diameter; that of a great fihyr is closer

to 7 feet. Two large tentacles hang below the body and serve as

the creatures legs. A mass of much smaller, constantly

writhing and twining tentacles projects from its body; these

help it maintain its balance. Numerous mouths and eyes are

placed at random along the front side of the creatures body.

The eyes are a startling gold color with horizontal black

pupils, and the mouths are lined with needle-sharp teeth. The

mottled skin of a fihyr runs the full spectrum of colors, but

GREAT FIHYR

Great fihyrs begin any conflict by using their emotion control

ability to generate negative emotions on which they can feed.

Once they decide to become visible, they immediately attack

so as to use their frightful presence ability.

Great fihyrs are unaffected by sunlight, but they despise

it. Thus, they prefer to lay low during the day in dark,

secluded spots, such as caves, dungeons, abandoned build-

ings, and the like.

Frightful Presence (Ex): Any creature that witnesses a

great fihyr attacking becomes panicked if it fails a Will save

(DC 20).

Emotion Control (Sp): At will, the great fihyr can produce

an effect like that of an emotion spell (despair, fear, or hate

only; caster level 16th; Will save DC 16), except that its

range is 260 feet, its radius is 15 feet, and it lasts as long as

the creature concentrates on it. The great fihyr can use this

ability and remain invisible.

Invisibility (Ex): A great fihyr can become invisible at

will. This effect is like that of the invisibility spell, except

that the creature can remain invisible as long as it

wishes, even while using its emotion control ability. Nor-

mally, a great fihyr is visible only immediately after

delivering a melee attack.

always in dull, sickly shades. An oily sheen covers the surface

of the creatures body.

Fihyrs rarely survive beyond the night of their formation,

and they never leave the troubled area that spawned them.

Great fihyrs, on the other hand, survive until slain. They

have been known to wander for hundreds of miles, from

one tormented spot to another, feeding on the fear and

despair of the inhabitants.

COMBAT

Both kinds of fihyrs attack by biting. The real purpose of a

fihyrs bite is not to deal damage, but to spread fear in others.

FIHYR

Fihyrs never hesitate to attack, but they prefer to do so in

front of as many witnesses as possible, to make use of their

frightful presence ability.

Frightful Presence (Ex): Any creature that witnesses a

fihyr attacking becomes panicked if it fails a Will save

(DC 10).

Vulnerable to Sunlight (Ex): Fihyrs die instantly when

exposed to sunlight, hissing and bubbling away into acrid

smoke. They have no fear of sunlight, however, and they dont

seek shelter to wait out the day. Magical sunlight can destroy a

fihyr if it penetrates the creatures spell resistance, though if

the fihyr succeeds at any allowed saving throw, it avoids the

instant death effect.

Firbolgs are reclusive giants who tend to avoid contact with

humanoid races and even other kinds of giants. Unlike

some of the more brutish giantkin, firbolgs do not depend

heavily on raiding for subsistence, nor do they rely solely on

force to resolve problems.

A firbolg looks like a 10-foot-tall human and weighs

more than 800 pounds. Its skin is a fleshy pink color, and

it can have hair of almost any shade, although blond and

red are the most common.A firbolg of either gender

wears its hair long, and the typical male sports a great,

thick beard.

Firbolgs speak Giant and Common.

COMBAT

Firbolgs are both cautious and crafty. They

have learned to distrust and fear the civi-

lized races, such as humans and

elves. If possible, they avoid

encounters with human-

oids altogether, either by

hiding or by deception.

If  forced  to  fight,  firbolgs

employ effective combat strategy,

using the terrain and situation to best

effect. They always operate as a team, not

as a collection of individuals.

Rock Throwing (Ex): An adult firbolg

receives a +1 racial bonus on attack

rolls when throwing rocks. It can

throw  rocks  weighing  40  to  50

pounds each (Small objects) up to

five  range  increments  (range

increment 130 feet).

Spell-Like  Abilities:

1/dayalter self, detect magic,

feeblemind, know  direction.

Caster level 13th; save

DC 12 + spell level.

Trample (Ex): As a stan-

dard  action  during  its  turn

each round, a firbolg can trample

opponents at least one size category smaller than itself.

This attack deals 2d8+19 points of bludgeoning damage.

A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack of

opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 29) for

half damage.

Fast Healing (Ex): A firbolg regains lost hit points at the

rate of 3 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit points

lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not

allow the firbolg to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Rock Catching (Ex): A firbolg can catch Small, Medium-

size, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once

per round, a firbolg that would normally be hit by a rock

can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is

15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium-size one, and 25 for a

102

Large one. (If the projectile has a bonus on attack rolls

because of magic, the DC increases by that amount.) The fir-

bolg must be ready for and aware of the attack.

FIRBOLG SOCIETY

Firbolgs usually live in well-fortified colonies, either in the

depths of the forest or in cavern complexes dug into hill-

sides. All firbolg settlements are protected by guard towers.

These creatures live primarily by hunting and gathering, but

each colony also practices simple agriculture.

FIRBOLG CHARACTERS

A troop of firbolgs usually has a

druid as its leader. Any other

ranked members have levels in

the barbarian class. A firbolgs

favored class is druid.

A firbolg PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level + 18. Thus, a

1st-level firbolg druid has an ECL of 19 and

is the equivalent of a 19th-level character.

Fire bats are native to the Elemental Plane of Fire, but unlike

fire elementals, they are not composed solely of elemental

material. They can fly through the flames and magma of the

Elemental Plane of Fire as easily as normal bats fly through

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:24 PM  Page 103

the air. They propel themselves by expelling heated gases

from tubes within their bodies, flapping their wings only to

steer during flight.

A fire bat cannot enter water or

any other nonflammable liquid. A

body of water is an impassible bar-

rier  unless  the  fire  bat  can

step, jump or fly over it.

Fire  bats  feed  on  living

creatures, attaching to targets and

devouring flesh until they are sated.

A sated fire bat has a 25% chance of

splitting into two hungry fire bats

during the next 24 hours.

A fire bats body is about

2 feet long, and its wing-

span is about 4 feet. The

creature burns continu-

ously with an unbear-

ably  hot,  red  flame,

which makes it look larger

than it really is. Until it is

slain and its body cools, its

impossible to tell that it is

not just swirling fire in the

shape of a large bat.

Fire elementals get along well

with fire bats, but salamanders,

efreet, and most other crea-

tures  of  fire  prey  on  them.

Such a check on their population is vital, since they not

only regenerate but also multiply very quickly where food

is plentiful. Without natural predators, they could over-

run the entire Elemental Plane of Fire within weeks.

COMBAT

In combat, fire bats display a level of cunning that belies

their limited intelligence, dividing their attacks evenly

among all the possible targets. Once a fire bat is sated (see

devour, below), it breaks off and leaves the fight. When

one-fourth of the swarm is sated or slain, all the remain-

ing fire bats break off and flee, only to shadow their prey

and attack again when the time is right. They repeat this

pattern until the whole swarm has fed.

Attach (Ex): If a fire bat hits with its bite attack, it latches

onto the opponents body. An attached fire bat is effectively

grappling its prey. The fire bat loses its Dexterity bonus to

AC (giving it an AC of 13) but holds on with great tenacity,

dealing 1d6 points of fire damage each round it remains

attached. An attached fire bat can be struck with a weapon

or grappled itself. To remove an attached fire bat through

grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin (see Grapple

in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook) against the fire bat.

Each grapple attempt subjects the opponent to the fire

bats burn attack.

Burn  (Ex):

Any  creature

that  is  hit  by  a

fire bats bite at-

tack (or that hits

the fire bat with a

natural weapon or an

unarmed attack) must suc-

ceed at a Reflex save (DC 12)

or catch fire (see Catching

on Fire in Chapter 3 of the

DUNGEON MASTERS Guide). The

fire burns for 1d4 rounds.

Immersing a fire bat in at least

10  gallons  of  water  extin-

guishes its flames and pre-

vents it from flying but does

not otherwise harm the crea-

ture.  The  fire  bats  flames

reignite after 10 rounds.

Devour (Ex): Once it is attached, a fire bat devours the

opponents flesh, automatically dealing 1d61 points of bite

damage  and  1d6  points  of  fire  damage  each  round  it

remains attached. After dealing 6 points of damage, the

fire bat is sated; on the next round it detaches and flies

away to digest the meal.

Blindsight (Ex): A fire bat emits high-frequency

sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that bounce off

nearby objects and creatures. This ability enables it to

discern objects and creatures within 120 feet. The fire

bat usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks

to notice creatures within range of its blindsight. A silence

spell negates this ability and forces the fire bat to rely on its

weak vision (which has a maximum range of 10 feet).

JJ

Elemental Traits (Ex): A fire bat is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to critical hits

or flanking, and it cannot be raised or resurrected. The crea-

ture also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Fire Subtype (Ex): A fire bat is immune to fire damage

but takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw

for half damage is allowed. In that case, the creature takes

half damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Regeneration (Ex): Cold attacks deal normal damage to a

fire bat.

Skills: A fire bat receives a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Lis-

ten checks. *These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.

FIRE BAT FAMILIARS

If your campaign uses the Improved Familiar feat from

Tome and Blood: A Guide Book to Wizards and Sorcerers, a fire

bat is an appropriate improved familiar for a 15th-level or

higher arcane spellcaster of the fire subtype. Like other

improved familiars, a fire bat familiar provides no special

benefits to its master beyond the standard familiar bene-

fits (see Familiars in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook).

A flesh jelly is a nauseating mound of stinking flesh that

gorges itself on any creatures unfortunate enough to cross

its path. These ravenous oozes are usually found in tropi-

cal regions.

A flesh jelly is a blob of soft, fleshy tissue surrounded by a

filthy membrane composed of skin, hair, and fur. When it

moves, a few of the loose bones inside it press against the

outer membrane, causing its disgusting body to bulge out

here and there. The creature has no eyes, ears, or mouth.

COMBAT

Driven by its raging hunger, a flesh

jelly simply rolls over its foes, absorb-

ing  them  into  its  body  mass.

When facing a group, it usually

concentrates on engulfing

one  target,  then  defends

itself  by  lashing  out  at

other opponents with its

fleshy pseudopods while

attempting  to  absorb

its meal.

Absorb (Ex):

A  flesh  jelly

feeds by absorb-

ing other crea-

tures into its

bulk. Any crea-

ture  engulfed  by

the monster must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be

absorbed into its mass and die. A successful save prevents

absorption that round. Each absorbed creature heals a flesh

jelly of 2d6 points of damage. A flesh jelly expels the

absorbed creatures personal belongings from its body 1d3

rounds after absorption. Nothing short of a wish or similar

magic can restore a creature that has been absorbed.

Disease (Ex): Any creature engulfed by a flesh jelly or hit

by its slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 25)

or contract filth fever. The incubation period is 1d3 days,

and the disease deals 1d3 points of Dexterity damage and

1d3 points of Constitution damage (see Disease in Chapter 3

of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Engulf (Ex): A flesh jelly can simply bowl over creatures

up to one size category smaller than itself as a standard

action. This attack affects as many opponents as the flesh

jellys body can cover. Each target can make either an attack

of opportunity against the flesh jelly or a Reflex save (DC

30) to avoid being engulfed. A successful saving throw indi-

cates that the target has been pushed back or aside (targets

choice) as the ooze moves forward. An engulfed creature is

considered grappled and trapped within the flesh jellys

body. A flesh jelly cannot make a slam attack during a round

in which it attempts to engulf, but each engulfed creature

takes automatic slam damage and must save against disease

(see above) on that round and every round thereafter that it

remains trapped. On any round after engulfing a creature,

the flesh jelly can attempt to absorb it.

Blindsight (Ex): A flesh jelly is blind, but its entire body

is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent

and vibration. This ability enables it to discern objects and

creatures within 60 feet. The flesh jelly usually does not

need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures

within range of its blindsight.

Horrid Stench (Ex): Any corporeal creature with 10 or

fewer Hit Dice that comes within 50 feet of a flesh

jelly  must  make  a

Fortitude  saving

throw (DC 25) or be

nauseated for the next

2d6 rounds. Another

save is required at the

end  of  that  time  if

the creature is still

within range. A sin-

gle successful save

against this effect

renders  the  crea-

ture  immune  to

that  flesh  jellys

horrid  stench  for

24 hours. A nause-

ated creature cannot

attack,  cast  spells,

concentrate on spells,

or do anything else requiring attention. The only action per-

mitted is a single move or move-equivalent action.

Ooze Traits: A flesh jelly is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.

It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

Fomorians are grossly

deformed behemoths

that live in mountain caves,

abandoned mines, or other

subterranean areas. They rarely

modify their homes for com-

fort  or  convenience;  they

simply  adapt  to  their  sur-

roundings. Their territories are

commonly marked by the partially

consumed bodies of their victims.

Each fomorian has a different set of

physical deformities. These can include

a misplaced or misshapen limb, a mis-

placed facial feature, a hunchback, a

bulging body part, drooping

flesh,  flapping  ears,  a

huge snout, large feet

on  short  legs,  and

many others. Patches

of hair as tough as wire

are scattered over its pale white

skin, and large warts and other growths dot its thick hide.

Unlike other giants, fomorians can survive on relatively

little food, considering the size of their bodies. They eat

almost any organic matter they come across, from molds

and lichens to humanoid prey, which is their favorite.

Common).

COMBAT

Fomorians usually try to sneak up on opponents and hit as

hard as they can. If they bother to keep captured oppo-

nents alive after combat, it is only for the entertainment

they gain from crude torture before eating their fallen

foes. Fomorians do not throw or catch rocks as other

giants do.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a fomorian can trample opponents at least one size

category smaller than itself. This attack deals 2d10+18 points

of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex

save (DC 29) for half damage.

Fast  Healing  (Ex):  A

fomorian  regains  lost  hit

points at the rate of 5 per

round. Fast healing does

not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst, or suf-

focation, and it does not allow the

fomorian to regrow or reattach lost

body parts.

Scent (Ex): A fomorian can

detect approaching enemies, sniff

out hidden foes, and track by sense

of smell.

Skills: A fomorian has a +10 racial

bonus on Move Silently checks.

FOMORIAN SOCIETY

Depravity and wickedness rule

fomorian society. The strongest

and cruelest rules over all the

others  within  reach,  and

women and children are treated

as slaves in every household. Acts of

violence, sometimes resulting in per-

manent injury or death, are common

among fomorians. Anyone who can

completely dominate a fomorian can

use the creature as an ally, but such

an alliance lasts only as long

as the fomorian fears the

dominant being.

FOMORIAN

CHARACTERS

A fomorians favored class is barbarian. Gang leaders are

either druids or barbarian/druids.

A fomorian PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to

its class level + 17. Thus, a 1st-level fomorian barbarian has

an ECL of 18 and is the equivalent of a 18th-level character.

penalty on grapple check, but the forest sloth is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A forest sloth can swallow a crea-

ture that is at least two size categories smaller than itself by

making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +21),

provided that the opponent is already in its mouth at the

start of its turn. Once inside the sloth, the opponent takes

2d4+7 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 points of

acid damage per round from the sloths gullet. A successful

grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of

the gullet and return to the sloths mouth, where another

successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively,

a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either

claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least

25 points of damage to the gullet (AC 20) in this way creates

an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single

swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole;

thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way

out. A Large forest sloths gullet can hold 2 Small, 8 Tiny, or

32 Diminutive or smaller creatures.

Scent (Ex): A forest sloth can detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden

foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: *A forest sloth receives a

+4  racial  bonus  on  Climb,  Move

Silently, and Spot checks when in

forested areas.

The territorial forest sloth is a nocturnal hunter that roams

tropical forests and jungles. This creature is not the slow-

moving beast its name implies; in fact, it possesses light-

ning-fast reflexes and can travel as quickly over land as it

does through trees. It is particularly fond of halfling flesh.

Standing 8 feet tall, a forest sloth is a sinewy beast with a

large, toothy mouth. Its tremendous jaws support a row of

oversized, needle-sharp front teeth. Each of a forest sloths

limbs ends in three toes tipped with huge, curved claws. Its

fur color ranges from olive to brown.

Forest sloths communicate with each

other using screeches and grunts.

COMBAT

The forest sloth typically attacks by

leaping on prey with a frenzy of bite and

claw attacks. Families of forest sloths

often hunt together, using one as a scout

to lure prey into the trees where the rest of

the group waits in ambush.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a forest sloth

hits an opponent that is at least one size cat-

egory smaller than itself with both claw attacks, it deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +21). If it gets a hold, it transfers

the opponent to its mouth as a free action and

automatically hits with its bite attack in the

same round. It can then try to swallow its prey

in the next round. Alternatively, the forest sloth

has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (20

teeth. It might also try bull rushing an enemy backward into

a pool of freezing water.

Cold Aura (Ex): A frost salamander emanates such

intense cold that each creature within 20 feet takes 1d8

points of cold damage per round (no saving throw). Magical

effects that shield against cold work against this aura, but

normal measures (such as heavy furs or insulation) do not.

Cold Subtype (Ex): A frost salamander is immune to cold

damage but takes double damage from fire unless a saving

throw for half damage is allowed. In that case, the creature

takes half damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Frost salamanders can be found in many

Galeb duhrs are among the oddest crea-

tures that an adventurer can encounter, but

they are seldom dangerous. They live only in the moun-

tains and seldom, if ever, venture onto other terrain. It is

not known whether galeb duhrs can reproduce on the

107

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:24 PM  Page 108

Material Plane, or whether the ones found there have all

come from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

To all appearances a galeb duhr is a living boulder with

two  dark,  brooding  eyes,  a  mouth,  and  rough-hewn

appendages that serve as hands and feet. The typical galeb

duhr stands about 4 feet tall,

though advanced versions

can reach heights of up

to 16 feet.

When sitting perfectly still (an activity that occupies

much of its time), a galeb duhr is nearly indistinguishable

from the surrounding stoneso much so that many trav-

elers walk right past one without realizing it. Galeb duhrs

do love to sing, however, and occasionally their deep, res-

onant, slow, and often palpably sad songs reveal their pres-

ence. The frequency of much of their singing falls below

the range of human hearing, but the subsonic tones can be

felt through the ground for many miles and tend to make

horses nervous.

As one might imagine, galeb duhrs are slow-moving,

slow to anger, slow to action, and always take the long view.

They have no known enemies except time. Now and then

reckless monsters or adventurers attack them, hoping to

acquire either gems or information about where to find

rich veins of gold or other precious ore. Such attempts are

generally doomed before they even begin. Galeb duhrs do

know all there is to know about their mountain homes,

both aboveground and below, but forcing them to give up

those details is difficult in the extreme.

To further complicate matters, galeb duhrs are quite terri-

torial, even to the point of feeling protective about rocks and

boulders, in much the same way that a treant feels respon-

sible for the forest in which it lives. Anyone damaging,

destroying, or even mining the mountains near a galeb

duhrs home often discovers some very staunch opposition.

COMBAT

Galeb duhrs are usually solitary creatures, though they

occasionally live with a few of their own kind. When

approached, a galeb duhr can easily make it itself unno-

ticed. When irritated into combat, however, it attacks

with its slams.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate objects (stone

Elemental Traits (Ex): A galeb duhr is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject

to critical hits or flanking, and it cannot be raised or

resurrected. The creature also has darkvision (60-

foot range).

Freeze (Ex): A galeb duhr can hold itself

so still that it appears to be a boulder. An

observer must succeed at a Spot check

(DC 30) to notice that it is really alive.

Tremorsense (Ex): A galeb duhr

can automatically sense the loca-

tion of anything within 300 feet

that is in contact with the ground.

GIANT

Giants are humanoid-shaped beings of great size

with even greater strength. They accomplish

much through sheer determination and brute

force, and in fact most rely on their might to

solve problems. Giants can inflict tremen-

dous  damage  on  those  who  anger  or

oppose them, but they can also put their

strength to good use in aiding their allies.

Many  giants  subsist  by  hunting  or

taking  what  they  want  from  smaller,

weaker beings. A few are not so cruel,

raising what crops and livestock they

need to survive.

All giants speak Giant. A giant with an

Intelligence  score  of  at  least  10  also

speaks Common.

COMBAT

Giants  relish  melee  combat.  They  favor  massive

weapons, especially two-handed ones, and wield them

with impressive skill. They possess enough cunning to

soften up a foe with ranged attacks before closing, if they

can. A giants favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.

Rock Throwing (Ex): An adult giant is an accom-

plished rock thrower, so he or she receives a +1 racial

bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant of at

least Huge size can hurl rocks weighing 60 to 80 pounds

each (Medium-size objects) up to five range increments.

The size of the range increment varies with the giants

kind (see individual entries). A Colossal giant can hurl

rocks weighing 160 to 200 pounds (Huge objects).

Rock Catching (Ex): A giant of at least Huge size can

catch Small, Medium-size, Large, or Huge rocks (or projec-

tiles of similar shape). A Colossal giant can catch rocks of up

to Colossal size. Once per round, a giant that would nor-

mally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a

free action. The DC to catch a rock is based on the rocks size

(see table below). If the projectile has a bonus on attack rolls

because of magic, the DC increases by that amount. The

giant must be ready for and aware of the attack.

GIANT SOCIETY

Solitary giants are usually young adults striking out on their

own. Gangs are usually made up of young adults who hunt

or raid (or both) together. Giant bands typically consist of

young adults and their mates, servants, or guards. About a

third of the giants in a band or tribe are children.

AW

A gambol is a baboonlike primate that stands 9 feet tall

and weighs more than 1,000 pounds. Its purple skin is cov-

ered with dense, silky, blue hair. A gambol has elongated

jaws and a hairless, doglike muzzle.

COMBAT

Gambols tumble into combat, clawing and biting their foes.

They take advantage of their reach to grapple and trip

advancing foes. Their constant maneuvering makes them

difficult targets for foes attacking from a distance.

Fear Aura (Su): When a gambol howls, every creature

within a 100-foot radius must succeed at a Will save (DC 13)

or become panicked for 1d6+1 rounds. Whether or not the

save is successful, the creature is then immune to that

gambols howl for 24 hours. The howl is a sonic, mind-affect-

ing fear effect.

Great Leap (Ex): A gambol gains a +25 bonus on Jump

checks. Maximum distance restrictions do not apply to

its jumps.

Evasion (Ex): A gambol that makes a successful Reflex

saving throw against an effect that would normally deal half

damage instead avoids damage altogether.

Haste (Su): A gambol can take an extra partial action each

round. This ability is always active.

Masterful Dodge (Ex): As a free action once per

round, a gambol can dodge one ranged weapon attack,

one reach melee weapon attack, or one spell that requires

an attack roll by making a successful Reflex save (DC 20).

An attack using a weapon with an enhancement bonus

increases the save DC by the amount of the bonus, and a

spell adds its spell level to the save DC. To use this abil-

ity, the gambol must be aware of the attack and not be

flat-footed.

Giant children can be formidable opponents in their own

right. When a group of giants includes children, roll d% for

each child to determine his or her maturity level: 0125

infant (no combat ability); 2650 juvenile (two size categories

smaller than an adult, 8 fewer Hit Dice, 8 to Strength and

Constitution scores, and 1 rank in each skill that an adult

has); 51100 adolescent (one size category smaller than an

adult, 4 fewer Hit Dice, 4 to Strength and Constitution

scores, and 2, 3, or 4 ranks in each skill that an adult has).

Giant children can throw rocks if they meet the minimum

size requirement. Except as noted, giant children are identi-

cal with adults of the same kind.

FOREST GIANT

Forest giants are among the tallest specimens of giantkind,

and they can live to be up to 200 years old. They are powerful

hunters that pose a threat to all animals that dwell in the woods.

An adult forest giant stands 18 feet tall but weighs only

3,000 pounds. The lanky, muscular body resembles that of a

wood elf but appears much sturdier. The creature has deep,

earth-yellow skin and pale green hair that is usually wild

and unkempt. The typical clothing for either gender is made

of fur or leather, and each forest giant also wears some bone

jewelry, particularly necklaces and earrings.

A forest giants bag contains everything needed to survive in

the wilderness, including tools to make and repair weapons,

2d4 rocks, 1d4+4 mundane items, and the giants personal

wealth. These items tend to be parts of things it killed for food,

such as scraps of fur and hide, dried insects, and bones.

Combat

Forest giants target opponents from afar with their poisoned

arrows. Though they are not averse to attacking with their

clubs, their poison-tipped, ranged weapons often end a

battle quickly with few casualties for the giants. Forest

giants use their natural camouflage abilities to hide among

the trees and wait in ambush for the next creature that

crosses their path. Their thrown rocks have a range incre-

ment of 120 feet.

Poison (Ex): Forest giants coat their arrows with poison

(Fortitude save DC 22). The initial and secondary damage is

the same (unconsciousness for 4d4 rounds).

Skills: A forest giant has a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks. * In wooded areas, this bonus rises to +8.

Forest Giant Society

Forest giants live solely in wooded areas regardless of the

climate. These ravenous meat-eaters hunt nearly any kind

primitive woodland beings who enjoy the same hunting

lifestyle as they do.

takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for

half damage is allowed. In that case, the giant takes half

damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Skills: A sun giant has a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Forest Giant Characters

A forest giants favored class is ranger. Many groups of forest

giants include both druids and rangers.

A forest giant PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal

to its class level + 16. Thus, a 1st-level forest giant ranger has

an ECL of 17 and is the equivalent of a 17th-level character.

SUN GIANT

Sun giants are cruel nomads who eke out a living raising

livestock under the bleakest of conditions. Most are grim

and brutal, caring little for the trappings of civilization. De-

spite their harsh existence, they are long-lived beings, often

reaching 400 years or more in age.

A sun giants skin is parched and wrinkled from years of

living in harsh, desertlike conditions. Hair that is soft and

black in childhood becomes dry, ashen, and brittle with

the passing of time. Only the creatures eyes seem un-

affected by the desertthey sparkle a bright blue color.

The typical sun giant stands 16 feet tall and weighs 7,000

pounds. The usual garb for either gender is a loose, light-

colored robe that covers the legs, body, and arms, plus a

cloth burnoose looped around the head and face to protect

the skin from the burning sun. A sun giant never wears

shoes, either for walking or riding.

A sun giants bag contains 1d2 rocks, 1d6+4 mundane

items, and the giants personal wealth. Personal pos-

sessions usually include simple things such as sand

sculptures, coins, and prized gifts from esteemed sun

giant leaders.

Combat

Sun giants use their natural camouflage ability to hide amid

the sand dunes, where they lie in wait for enemies with

spears at the ready. They rarely throw rocks, but when they

do, the range increment is 120 feet. In melee, sun giants

prefer to pound opponents with their fists. During times of

war, they fight mounted, seated upon Gargantuan steeds

that they raise and train them-

selves. When weaponless, a sun

giant uses its spell-like abilities

to keep foes at bay.

Spell-Like  Abilities: At

In desert areas, this bonus rises to +8.

Sun Giant Society

Sun giants dwell in the desert, but they never set up perma-

nent homes there because they enjoy the freedom that comes

with living in tents. They almost always ride rather than trav-

eling on foot. They prefer living mounts such as rocs and

giant lizards, but when such creatures are scarce, they are

quite willing to have their clerics animate dead mounts.

As herders, sun giants see all land as theirs for the taking,

so they graze their animals anywhere food is available. This

destructive practice often strips fields bare and turns the

land barren, earning sun giants few friends in the desert.

Sun Giant Characters

Most groups of sun giants include clerics with access to any

two of the following domains: Destruction, Fire, Sun, Travel,

and War. A sun giants favored class is ranger.

A sun giant PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to

its class level + 16. Thus, a 1st-level sun giant ranger has an

ECL of 17 and is the equivalent of a 17th-level character.

OCEAN GIANT

The noble ocean giants are deep-sea dwellers who delight

in the tossing waves and the rich life of the underwater

world. These usually peaceful creatures are nevertheless

quick  to  anger

when  anyone

finds fault with

their ways. Ocean

giants frequently

live  to  be  600

years old.

The  barrel-

though the landform ability (see below) provides an alter-

nate form in which the tail is replaced by legs. An ocean

giant of either gender measures 16 feet in length and weighs

more than 4,000 pounds. On land, the typical ocean giant

wears light clothing that is unlikely to impede swimming

should that become necessary. Underwater, clothing is

spurned except for a belt pouch to carry personal effects.

An ocean giants bag contains 1d2 rocks, 1d6+4 mundane

items, and the giants personal wealth. These items tend to

be sea-related items such as navigation instruments, sea

shells, pearls, and treasure found on sunken ships.

Combat

Whether fighting on the surface or underwater, an ocean

giant usually wields a massive trident. On land, ocean giants

prefer to keep their foes at a distance. They hurl rocks (range

increment 120 feet) at closing enemies and even ships that

are not welcome in their territory. In close combat on land,

or when unarmed, they hammer opponents with their fists

and slap with their tails.

Amphibious (Ex): Although ocean giants have gills for

breathing underwater, they can also breathe air and can sur-

vive indefinitely on land.

Blunt Weapon Immunity (Ex): An ocean giant takes no

damage from bludgeoning weapons.

Cold Subtype (Ex): An ocean giant is immune to cold

damage but takes double damage from fire unless a saving

throw for half damage is allowed. In that case, the giant takes

half damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Landform (Su): This ability allows an ocean giant to

assume the form of a Huge humanoid-shaped giant or return

to its natural form at will. An ocean giant in landform is able

to walk on land, but it has no tail attack. A change wrought by

landform cannot be dispelled, nor does the ocean giant revert

to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell, however,

reveals the ocean giants natural shape if it is in landform.

Ocean Giant Society

Ocean giants live in magnificent, underwater mansions situ-

ated near barrier reefs. They live off the sea, hunting large sea

creatures and harvesting aquatic plants and shellfish. Elderly

ocean giants often raise domestic animals on deserted islands

to supplement their clans diet. Many young ocean giants

desire to travel the seas aboard sailing ships, so they sign up

to become sailors. Of course, their incredible size limits

them to only the largest vessels. Merfolk and aquatic storm

giants view ocean giants as plunderers of the seas wealth, so

relations between them are strained at best.

Ocean Giant Characters

An ocean giants favored class is sorcerer, but

many also choose to become clerics. An ocean

giant cleric can choose two of the following

domains: Luck, Protection, and Water.

An ocean giant PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level + 23; thus, a 1st-

level ocean giant sorcerer has an ECL of 24 and

is the equivalent of a 24th-level character.

MOUNTAIN GIANT

Among the largest giants in existence, moun-

tain giants are primitive creatures given to

cruelty and capriciousness. They take great

pleasure in flinging boulders down upon

passing smaller creatures, trying to hit

them as they flee. Mountain giants often live

to be 100 years old.

A mountain giant resembles a titanic hill giant, standing

more than 40 feet tall and weighing nearly 50,000 pounds.

Greasy, jet-black hair frames a face with bulbous features

and a skin tone that can be any shade from tan to reddish

brown. The typical mountain giant wears only minimal

clothingusually a breechcloth and a shirt made of

rough animal hide that barely covers a large

pot belly.

A mountain giants bag contains 3d4 rocks,

1d4+2 mundane items, and the giants personal

wealth. These items tend to be humanoid

artifacts that the mountain giant con-

siders playthings, such as broken

wagons, small huts, and furniture,

including tables and beds.

Combat

Mountain giants attack in a straight-

forward manner, stepping forth to

overrun opponents whenever pos-

sible. They also enjoy picking up foes

and hurling them against a moun-

tainside. Many an armed foe has

foiled a mountain giants initial

grab attempt only to be scooped up

by the monsters other hand.

In melee, mountain giants use their

height to smash their clubs down on the heads

of their foes. A mountain giant that feels seriously threat-

ened often uses its summon giants ability to engage its foes

with other opponents, then steps back to hurl boulders.

Against groups of smaller foes, mountain giants prefer

their trample or crush attacks.

Crush (Ex): A mountain giant that jumps at least

20 feet into the air (or jumps down from a height of at

least 20 feet) can land on opponents two or more

size categories smaller than itself as a

standard action, using its whole

body  to  crush  them.  A  crush

attack affects as many creatures as

can  fit  under  the  giants  body.

(This  is  normally  a  40-foot

square, but the giant can instead

opt to come down on its seat and

cover a 40-foot by 60-foot area.) Each

creature in the affected area

must  succeed  at  a  Reflex

save  (DC  38)  or  be  pinned,

automatically taking 2d6+24

points of bludgeoning damage.

Thereafter, if the giant chooses

to maintain the pin, treat it as a

normal grapple attack. While

pinned,  the  opponent  takes

crush damage each round.

Fling (Ex): A mountain giant that sucessfully grapples a foe

two or more size categories smaller than itself can hurl the

creature as a standard action. A flung creature travels up to 120

feet and takes 12d6 points of damage. A creature that is flung

off a mountain takes this amount of damage or the appropriate

falling damage, whichever is greater. The giant also can throw

the flung creature as though it were a boulder. In this case,

the flung creature takes 12d6+16 points of damage, and any

opponent it strikes takes 4d8+16 points of damage.

Grapple (Ex): If a mountain giant hits

an opponent that is at least one size cat-

egory smaller than itself with a slam

(used as a melee touch attack), it

deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple (grapple bonus +54). If it

gets a hold, it can fling the opponent in

the next round. Alternatively, the moun-

tain giant has the option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use

one hand to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the

mountain  giant  is  not  considered

grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful  grapple  check  it  makes

during successive rounds automati-

cally deals slam damage.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action

during its turn each round, a mountain

giant can trample opponents at least

one size category smaller than itself. This attack

G

T

113

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:25 PM  Page 114

deals 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled

opponent can attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4

penalty or a Reflex save (DC 41) for half damage.

Scent (Ex): A mountain giant can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Summon Giants (Sp): Once per day, a mountain giant can

attempt to summon 1d8+1 ogres, 1d6+1 trolls, or 1d4+1 hill

giants with a 25% chance of success.

Skills and Feats: A mountain giant has EHD as though it

were a Huge creature.

Mountain Giant Society

Mountain giants live largely solitary lives in desolate moun-

tain ranges and volcanic peaks. Though most of them resent

intruders, some like to keep a few dwarves and humans as

pets. When more than one mountain giant is encountered,

it is usually a mated pair with children.

Mountain Giant Characters

A mountain giants favored class is barbarian, though the

cleric class is also popular among the race. Mountain giant

clerics can choose any two of the following domains: Earth,

Strength, and Trickery.

A mountain giant PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level + 25. Thus, a 1st-level

mountain giant barbarian has an ECL of 26 and is

the equivalent of a 26th-level character.

Glimmerskins are thrill-seeking parasites from the Positive

Energy Plane. These creatures travel to the Material Plane

solely to engage in mortal combat.

Since a glimmerskin lacks a material form, it cannot

engage an opponent in physical melee unaided. To circum-

vent this difficulty, it solicits a willing host to harbor it. In

exchange for this service, the glimmerskin temporarily

grants the host augmented fighting skills and abilities.

A glimmerskin appears as a vaguely humanoid-shaped

being made of pulsing white light. Despite its alien appear-

ance, it possesses a recognizably intelligent, elflike face.

When bonded with a host, a glimmerskin cosmetically

alters its shape to one more appropriate for battle, usually

appearing as a full suit of radiant armor or a glowing, hooded

robe. A glimmerskin envelops only its hosts body; it cannot

cover the latters shield or drawn weapons.

When on the Material Plane, glimmerskins usually seek

out large-scale battles, since these offer a greater variety of

potential hosts. The creature is not concerned with align-

ment, nor is it interested in its hosts intentions, nor does it

care whether its host lives or diesit desires only combat.

A glimmerskin can remain away from the Pos-

itive Energy Plane for a number of hours equal

to half its Constitution score. Each round that

it exceeds this limit, it must make a Fortitude

save (DC 20) or die from energy dispersion.

This danger keeps most glimmerskins

from making frequent trips to the

Material Plane.

Some enterprising adventurers who are

familiar with the planes and aware of the

glimmerskins limited time frames arrange

one-time bondings between glimmer-

skins and willing hosts. This often occurs

during times of war and similar unrest, but

bondings also occur between glimmerskins

and adventurers seeking some extra power for

an upcoming confrontation. Whoever arranges

such a bonding first determines what physical

challenges the host expects to meet, then apprises

the glimmerskin of the offer and selects a time and

place for the bonding. The host usually pays the

arranger a stipend (or finders fee)

ahead of time for this service.

Combat

Glimmerskins revel in combat, but

they  cannot  actually  control  their

hosts. Instead, they communicate their wishes telepathi-

cally, acting as combat advisors. A host who ignores a glim-

merskins requests risks termination of the bond, since the

monster is quite willing to abandon a host in favor of a

more accommodating or interesting one. Before abandon-

ing a host, a glimmerskin usually contacts its next prospect

via telepathy to arrange a transfer. If badly wounded, a

glimmerskin escapes to the Positive Energy Plane rather

than continuing to fight.

Energy Touch (Su): The positively energized touch of a

glimmerskin heals a target of 5 points of damage per round

or grants 5 additional temporary hit points per round to a

creature already at full hit points. These temporary hit

points fade 1d6 rounds after the creature ceases physical

contact with the glimmerskin. However, this benefit has an

unfortunate side effect. For each round that its hit points

(including temporary ones) exceed its normal hit point

total, the target creature must make a successful Fortitude

save (DC 19) or explode in a 20-foot burst of radiant energy.

Each creature caught in the blast (including the target) takes

damage equal to 2d6 points + the number of excess hit

points the target had at the time. A Reflex save (DC 19)

reduces the damage by half. A glimmerskins host automati-

cally benefits from the additional hit points but is allowed

no saving throw to reduce the damage from the blast. Glim-

merskins rarely inform their hosts of this side effect.

Heroic Bond (Su): A glimmerskin bonds by enveloping

its host. A bonded host gains a +4 bonus on melee attack

rolls, a +2 armor bonus to AC, access to the glimmerskins

feats (with the prerequisite Strength score of at least 13),

and any class features the glimmerskin may have. Addition-

ally, a host who can turn undead gains a +5 bonus on the roll

to determine Hit Dice affected. In exchange, the host shares

half of any earned experience points with the glimmerskin.

Spells that protect against Positive Energy Plane effects pre-

vent a glimmerskin from bonding to a host.

Incorporeal Subtype: A glimmerskin can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abili-

ties. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch weapons. A glimmerskin can pass

through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its

attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflec-

tion bonuses and force effects work normally against them.

A glimmerskin always moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Outsider Traits: A glimmerskin has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Plane Shift (Sp): A glimmerskin can use plane shift at will

(caster level 12th; Will save DC 18).

Telepathy (Su): A glimmerskin can communicate telepath-

ically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Feats: A glimmerskins feats become usable only when

the creature is bonded with a host who has a Strength score

of at least 13.

GLIMMERSKIN CHARACTERS

A glimmerskins favored class is fighter.

A glimmerskin PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal

to its class level + 15. Thus, a 1st-level glimmerskin fighter has

an ECL of 16 and is the equivalent of a 16th-level character.

GOLEM

Golems are magically created constructs of great power.

Constructing one involves the use of mighty magic and ele-

mental forces. The animating force for a golem is a spirit

from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creation

binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects

it to the will of the golems creator.

Golems have no language of their own, but they can

understand simple instructions from their creators.

COMBAT

Golems are tenacious in combat. Since they are mindless,

they can do nothing in the absence of orders from their cre-

ators. They always follow instructions explicitly and are

incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in

combat and cannot be provoked.

If a golems creator is within 60 feet of it and both visible

and audible to it, he or she can command the creature directly.

An uncommanded golem usually follows its last instruction

to the best of its ability, though it returns any attacks made

against it. The creator can give the golem a simple program

(such as Remain in an area and attack all creatures [or crea-

tures of a specific type] that enter, or Ring a gong and

attack, or the like) to govern its actions in his or her absence.

Since golems do not need to breathe and are immune to

most forms of energy, they can press an attack against an

opponent almost anywhere, from the bottom of the sea to

the frigid top of the tallest mountain.

Construct Traits: A golem is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects. The creature is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. It cannot

heal itself but can be healed through repair. It cannot be

raised or resurrected. A golem has darkvision (60-foot range).

Magic Immunity (Ex): Golems completely resist most

magical and supernatural effects, except as noted below.

CONSTRUCTION

The cost given for each golem includes the price of the

physical body, plus all the materials and spell components

that are consumed during the process or become a perma-

nent part of the golem.

The first task is carving or assembling the golems physi-

cal body. The creator can do this personally or hire someone

else to do the job. The builder must have the requisite skill,

which varies with the golem. The real work of creation

involves extended magical rituals requiring two months to

complete. Understanding the rituals requires a character of

the appropriate level with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor

and Craft Wondrous Item feats. The creator must labor for at

least 8 hours each day in a specially prepared laboratory or

workroom. This chamber is similar to an alchemists labora-

tory and costs 500 gp to establish.

When not working on the rituals, the creator must rest

and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping,

or talking. If personally constructing the golems body, the

creator can perform the building and the rituals together.

Missing a day of rituals means the process fails and must be

started again. Any money spent is lost, but XP are not. The

golems body can be reused, as can the laboratory.

Completing the ritual drains the appropriate XP from the

creator and requires casting any spells on the final day. The

creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come

from outside sources, such as scrolls.

STAINED GLASS GOLEM

Beautiful stained glass windows not only indicate the

wealth of a temple or stronghold, they may also be the sites

guardians. These beautiful constructs are built to harmonize

with a structures decor so that their presence is not obvious

to any except intruders.

Stained glass golems are flat, two-dimensional replicas

of living beings. When they move, they produce a tinkling

sound like that made by delicate crystal wind chimes.

When moving through a lighted area, they flash and

flicker as the light striking them breaks down into its

component hues. Stained glass golems never communi-

cate in any way.

Combat

Stained glass golems attack by slashing with their arms,

which are as sharp as broken glass.

Keen (Su): A stained glass golems rake attack threatens a

critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1920.

Magic Immunity (Ex): A stained glass golem is immune

to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects,

except as follows. A shatter spell affects it normally. A mend-

ing spell heals 2d6 points of damage the golem has taken.

Sonic attacks affect it normally.

Skills: *A stained glass golem receives a +20 competence

bonus on Hide checks when standing motionless in a

window frame.

Construction

A  stained  glass  golems  body  is  constructed  from  50

pounds of glass shards and costs 10,000 gp to create.

Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (glass-

making) check (DC 25).

The creator must be 16th level and able to cast arcane

spells. Completing the ritual drains 200 XP from the creator

and requires the geas/quest, limited wish, and polymorph any

object spells.

Construction

A brass golems body is constructed from 1,000 pounds of

brass and costs 200,000 gp to create. (This amount includes

1,500 gp for the body and 32,320 gp

for the +3 wounding greataxe.)

Assembling the body requires

one successful Craft

( a r m o r s m i t h i n g )

check (DC 25) and

one successful Craft

check (DC 25).

The creator must

Completing the rit-

ual drains 4,000 XP

maze, Mordenkainens

sword, and polymorph any object spells.

DRAGONFLESH GOLEM

Dragonflesh golems, sometimes called drolems, are built

from parts of dragons. These creatures can remember more

complex commands than most golems can, but because they

cannot think, they obey commands to the letter rather than

evaluating the intent. Drolems have been known to kill

their creators because a complex or incautiously worded

command allowed such an option for fulfillment.

True dragons hate dragonflesh golems and attack them on

sight. Once a dragon has slain a drolem, it hunts down the

creator as well, to exact retribution for the atrocities com-

mitted against dragonkind in creating such a creature.

The dragonflesh golem is a hideous patchwork of rotting,

mismatched dragon parts rudely stitched together. Despite its

appearance, a dragonflesh golem is a construct, not an undead.

Combat

A drolem lacks the breath weapons and the spellcasting abil-

ities of true dragons. It usually prefers to land in the midst of

a group of opponents and lash out in all directions with its

teeth, claws, wings, and tail.

Frightful  Presence  (Ex): When  a  drolem  charges,

attacks, or flies overhead, it inspires terror in all creatures

within 30 feet that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than it has.

Each potentially affected opponent must succeed at a Will

save (DC 28) or become shaken for 5d6 rounds. A successful

save leaves that opponent immune to that drolems frightful

presence for 24 hours.

Blindsight (Ex): A drolem can ascertain its surroundings

by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by

noticing vibrations and other environmental clues). This abil-

ity enables it to discern objects and creatures within 150 feet.

BRASS GOLEM

A brass golem exists to fulfill one goal, set at the time of its

creation. It waits with absolute patience until activated,

then it becomes a terrible instrument of destruction. If its

goal becomes unattainablefor example, if it was created

to guard a temple that no longer existsthe brass golem

loses its enchantment entirely and becomes nothing more

than a statue.

A brass golem is most often forged to resemble a mino-

taur. Until activated, it appears as a large, brass statue armed

with a gleaming greataxe.

Combat

A brass golem fights primarily with its greataxe.

Maze (Sp): Once per day, a brass golem can target a maze

effect (caster level 16th) against a single quarry. The golem

is immune to the effects of its own maze ability and that of

others of its kind, and it can freely enter its own maze to

track a target.

Magic Immunity (Ex): A brass golem is immune to all

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as

follows. An electricity effect slows it (as the slow spell) for 3

rounds, with no saving throw. A fire effect breaks any slow

effect on the golem and cures 1 point of damage for each 3

points of damage it would otherwise deal. (For example, a

brass golem hit by a fireball cast by a 5th-level wizard gains

back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18.) The golem does

not get a saving throw against fire effects.

Skills: *A brass golem is a relentless tracker. It gains a +20

competence bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for the pur-

pose of tracking a foe designated by its creator, or in con-

nection with any other goal set by its creator. When track-

ing a foe through its own maze, the creature gains a +20

insight bonus on Wilderness Lore checks.

The gravecrawler, sometimes called the ancestor worm, is

an intelligent, sluglike undead with the power to turn flesh

(dead or living) to stone. Gravecrawlers can be found in

wilderness areas, but they are most often found in cemeter-

ies, boneyards, and necropoli. There they slowly turn the

surrounding dead bodies to a brittle stone that cannot be

animated even by the animate dead spell.

A gravecralwer resembles a bloated, pale, segmented

worm about 3 feet in length. Its face looks like that of a

human or humanoid, except that it has no eyesnot even

vestigial ones.

Gravecrawlers can communicate with the spirits of the

dead they consume, and as such they often become reposi-

tories of local lore, history, and gossip. Because of this fact,

some societies view gravecrawlers as beneficial creatures.

Even those who consider them benefactors, however, tend

to give their lairs a wide berth, since the presence of these

creatures has a grievous effects on the living. Gravecrawlers

are frequently sought out by those who seek hidden knowl-

edge and lost bits of history, but they are hated both by

necromancers and by corpse-devouring creatures such as

the ghoul and the corpse gatherer.

COMBAT

Gravecrawlers would rather be venerated than fought. If seri-

ously threatened, they usually try to flee below ground. Occa-

sionally, a gravecrawler may try

to ambush

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:25 PM  Page 118

The drolem usually does not need to make Spot or Listen

checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.

Magic Immunity (Ex): A drolem is immune to all spells,

spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows.

Fire- and cold-based effects slow the monster (as the slow spell)

for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. An electricity effect

breaks any slow effect on the drolem and cures 1 point of

damage for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal.

For example, a drolem hit by a lightning bolt cast by a 5th-level

wizard gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18. The

drolem does not get a saving throw against electricity effects.

Construction

A drolems body is constructed from either an entire dragon

corpse, or enough parts of dragon corpses to assemble a

whole dragon.

The drolem costs 200,000 gp to create. Assembling the

body requires one successful Knowledge (nature) check and

one successful Heal check (both DC 25).

The creator must be 16th level and able to cast arcane

spells. Completing the ritual drains 4,000 XP from the cre-

ator and requires the geas/quest, limited wish, and polymorph

any object spells.

its opponents, erupting from the ground to expose a whole

group of intruders to its calcifying aura, then following up

with its debilitating bite. Gravecrawlers tend to be more for-

giving if propitiated with fresh bodies and uncalcified bones.

Calcifying Aura (Su): The presence of a gravecrawler is

enough to cause flesh (living or dead) to harden and calcify,

turning slowly into stone. This effect is a 30-foot-radius emana-

tion centered on the gravecrawler, and it is always active. Every

creature within the area must make a Fortitude save (DC 22)

each round or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage. (Unlike

the drain from its bite, the loss from the gravecrawlers calcify-

ing aura is restored at the rate of 1 point per day.) A character

brought to a Constitution score of 0 in this manner turns com-

pletely to stone. A gravecrawler is immune to its own calcify-

ing aura and to those of others of its kind.

Constitution Drain (Su): Any creature bitten by a grave-

crawler must make a Fortitude save (DC 22) or permanently

lose 1d4 points of Constitution (or twice that amount on a

critical hit). The gravecrawler heals 5 points of damage (10

on a critical hit) whenever it drains Constitution, gaining

any excess as temporary hit points. A creature affected by

this Constitution drain finds parts of its flesh turned to

hard, brittle stone. At 0 Constitution, the target becomes a

stone statue. A gravecrawler is immune to its own Constitu-

tion drain and to those of others of its kind.

Burrow (Ex): Gravecrawlers can move through stone,

dirt, and earth, leaving no indication of their passage. A move

earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing grave-

crawler flings the creature back 30 feet and stuns it for 1

round, unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 22).

Speak with Dead (Su): At will, a gravecrawler can produce

an effect like that of a speak with dead spell (caster level 20th),

except that it can be used to communicate with only

one corpse per week. This ability does not allow

communication with calcified remains.

Tremorsense (Ex): A gravecrawler can

automatically sense the location of anything

within 60 feet that is in contact with the

ground.

Turn  Resistance  (Ex): A  grave-

crawler is treated as an undead with 31

Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, rebuke,

command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A gravecrawler is immune

to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death ef-

fects,  necromantic  effects,  and  any

effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not

subject to critical hits, subdual damage,

ability damage, ability drain, energy drain,

or death from massive damage. A grave-

crawler cannot be raised, and resurrection

works only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision

(60-foot range).

A gravorg is a carnivorous predator that lairs underground.

These monsters are only rarely encountered in the wilder-

ness; they tend to move from cave to cave or dungeon to dun-

geon in search of prey. The sound of armor and flesh repeat-

edly striking stone often means that a gravorg has found

another victim. The beast is so voracious that

the remnants of such an encounter

may  be  nothing  more

than piles of bones and

equipment  strewn

haphazardly over

a dungeon

A gravorg is a 10-foot-long, four-legged animal that

vaguely resembles a sloth. Its fur is a mixture of white, gray,

and black hairs. This coloration makes it look like a lump of

stone when motionless.

COMBAT

A gravorg uses reverse gravity to bounce its prey off ceilings

or other overhangs, then dismisses the effect to drop the

opponents back to the floor. Only when its victims appear

unconscious or dead does a gravorg come out of hiding and

begin to feed.

A gravorg caught outdoors uses its reverse gravity ability to

throw predators in the air repeatedly until the latter either

flee or become disabled. The monster uses its claws and

teeth almost entirely for tearing open its prey rather than

for self-defense.

Reverse Gravity (Sp): At will, a gravorg can produce

range is 200 feet and it affects an area of up

to five 10-foot cubes. The monster simply

stacks the cubes to reach a ceiling or

other  overhang,  then  uses  any

remaining area to disrupt the preys

Greenvises are ambulatory vegetable horrors that stalk the

fringes of some humanoid settlements. These carnivorous

plants are not boldthey prefer to ambush lone prey that

happens to come too near. Greenvises rest at night and

actively hunt during daylight hours, repositioning them-

selves throughout the day if prey in a particular hunting

area proves scarce.

A greenvise is a larger, sturdier version of the venus fly-

trap, with a thick, green, trunklike stem and four sturdy

tendrils that hang down like vines. When the creature

opens its mouth, a mottled pink maw lined with toothlike

thorns is revealed; when closed, the mouth structure

resembles an ordinary leafy bush. A greenvise has small,

tendrillike roots that it uses to move.

COMBAT

After setting itself up in an appropri-

ate location, a greenvise lies in wait for

prey to pass. It lunges at the first living

creature it senses, using all its ten-

drils to grab the prey and transfer it

to its maw. An extremely hun-

gry or seriously hurt green-

vise releases a death fog to

weaken its opponents and ob-

scure their vision. Although

multiple greenvises are

sometimes  found  to-

gether, they do not share

their prey and thus do

not assist each other in

combat  unless  many

potential  victims  are

present.

RGM

Death  Fog  (Su):

Twice per day, a green-

vise can emit an acidic

fog that functions like

an  acid  fog spell,

except as follows.

The  death  fogs

area  is  a  40-foot-

high  spread  with  a

60-foot  radius.  Within  this  area,  all

sight, including darkvision, is limited to

5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-

half concealment (attacks against it have a

20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total con-

cealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cant use

sight to locate the target). Any creature attempting to

move through the death fog progresses at one -tenth

normal speed, and each of its melee attack and melee

damage rolls incurs a 2 circumstance penalty. A death

fog prevents effective ranged weapon attacks, except for

magic rays and the like.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:26 PM  Page 121

In addition to obscuring sight, a death fog is highly

acidic. Each round, the fog deals 3d8 points of acid damage

to every creature and object within it (no saving throw). A

severe  wind  (31+  mph)  disperses  these  vapors  in  1d2

rounds; otherwise, the effect lasts for 3d6+1 rounds. The

greenvise is not impeded by its own death fog, so it can

move and fight within the fog freely.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a greenvise hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If it gets a hold, it can

transfer the opponent to its maw with another successful

grapple check, dealing automatic bite damage, then try to

swallow in the next round. Alternatively, the greenvise

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use its tendrils or maw to hold the opponent (20 penalty

on grapple check, but the greenvise is not considered

grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it

makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam

or bite damage, as appropriate.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A greenvise can swallow a single

creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself

by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +26),

provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see

Improved Grab, above). Once inside the greenvise, the

opponent takes 2d6+9 points of bludgeoning damage

and 2d4 points of acid damage per round from the

plants stomach. A successful grapple check allows

the swallowed creature to climb out of the stom-

ach  and  return  to  the  greenvises  maw,

where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swal-

lowed creature can try to cut its way out

with either claws or a light piercing or

slashing weapon. Dealing at least

20 points of damage to the stom-

ach (AC 18) in this way creates an

opening large enough to permit escape.

Once a single swallowed creature exits,

muscular action closes the hole; thus, another

swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A

greenvises stomach can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium-size,

16 Small, or 64 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Plant Traits (Ex): A greenvise is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymor-

phing. It is not subject to critical hits or mind-

affecting effects. The creature also has low-

light vision.

Woodsense (Ex): A greenvise can automati-

cally sense the location of anything within

60 feet that is in contact with vegeta-

tion, even objects or creatures that are

not in contact with the same vege-

tation as it is.

These horrible, misshapen creatures resemble giant, float-

ing brains with tentacles. They inhabit dungeons, under-

ground passages, remote caves, and other places

where light never reaches. Humanoids of all

kinds are their favorite prey.

This vicious predator has a large, bul-

bous body composed of wrinkled, light

gray flesh that seems to float in the air

of its own volition. Ten long, spiny ten-

tacles  hang  from  the  bottom  of  its

body, twisting in the air like ropes. A

grell has a sharp beak that it uses for tear-

ing the flesh of its prey, but no other visible

facial features.

COMBAT

A grell prefers to wait in ambush for

potential prey. When a suitable target

passes, the monster attempts to para-

lyze it with its tentacles, then escape to

its lair with its helpless prey. Grells are

cunning enough to avoid direct con-

frontations with large groups, since

they are aware of the dangers that foes

capable of teamwork can present.

A grell occasionally shadows a

group that is too large to attack

directly, following along incon-

spicuously and using its Hide skill

to stay out of sight. When a member

of the target group lags behind, or

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:26 PM  Page 122

the group is distracted by some other hazard, the grell

attacks a straggler and tries to drag away its meal unnoticed.

Grells also sometimes lurk near dangerous areas, such as pit

traps, quicksand, or the lairs of other monsters, hoping to

prey upon trapped, helpless, or wounded creatures.

In melee combat, a grell can attack as many foes as it can

reach, using as many of its tentacles as it wishes against any

single opponent. It uses its bite only against paralyzed prey

or as a last resort.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a grell hits an opponent that is

at least one size category smaller than itself with a tentacle

attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +20, including a +16 racial

bonus on grapple checks). If it gets a hold, it has the option

to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use a single ten-

tacle to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the grell is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals tentacle damage.

Paralysis (Ex): A grells tentacles are lined with small

spiny barbs, much like a squids. (This is clearly a classic

case of convergent evolution, since the two creatures are

completely unrelated.) Any creature hit by a grells tenta-

cle must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for

4 rounds.

Blindsight (Ex): A grell is blind, but it maneuvers and

fights as well as a sighted creature by using scent

and vibration to ascertain its surroundings.

This ability enables it to discern objects and

creatures within 60 feet. The grell usually

does  not  need  to  make  Spot  or  Listen

checks to notice creatures within range of

its blindsight.

Flight (Ex): A grells body is unusually

buoyant. The creature continuously produces

an effect like that of the fly spell, which it can use

to move at a speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuver-

ability). This buoyancy also grants the grell a per-

manent feather fall effect with personal range.

Immunities (Ex): A grell is immune to elec-

tricity and paralysis effects.

Tentacle Regeneration (Ex): Foes can

attack a grells tentacles, but only when those

appendages are actually holding an oppo-

nent. A tentacle has an AC of 19 (touch 12)

and can withstand 10 points of damage.

The loss of a tentacle does not harm the

creature (that is, the damage does not

apply against its hit point total), and it

regrows the limb within a day.

Skills: A grell gains a +2 racial

bonus  on  Hide  and  Move

Silently checks.

(Large)

Prized pets and dedicated guard animals, the shapeshifting

grimalkins are found among many civilized societies. Most

of these unusual creatures are domesticated, so it is rare to

see one in the wild.

The mutable nature of the grimalkin allows it to take on

a wide variety of animal forms, though its preferred form

is its natural onethat

of  an  oversized,  blue -

gray housecat. When it

is feeling playful, a gri-

malkin performs for its

master by changing into

amusing  or  beguiling

forms. It adopts a more

threatening form when

defending itself from

an attack.

A  grimalkin  bonds

with  one  master  and

remains his or her loyal

companion for life. Its

personality is extremely

malleable, and over time

the grimalkin takes on a

disposition  similar  to

that of its owner.

Grimalkins  speak

Common.  They  are

chatty  creatures  that

never  know  when  to

keep quiet.

COMBAT

A  grimalkin  changes  its  shape  each  round

during a battle to confuse its foes. This makes it

very difficult to adopt any sort of strategy for

fighting it. A grimalkin fights to the death

when defending its master, though it is

quite willing to flee a battle that is going

badly for it while it is alone.

Empathy (Ex): A grimalkin can detect

the surface emotions of any creature within

50 feet that it can see. It can sense basic

needs, drives, and emotions, but not thoughts.

A successful Will save (DC 13) allows a target

to avoid being sensed in this way by that

grimalkin for 24 hours thereafter.

Polymorph (Su): As a free action, a

grimalkin can produce an effect like

that of a polymorph self spell, except as

follows. The creature may take the

form of any Medium-size or smaller

animal, beast, or vermin, but it does not

regain hit points when changing forms.

Skills: A grimalkin has a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently

checks and a +2 racial bonus on Climb and Jump checks.

These larger, more temperamental cousins of the elephant

roam subarctic and arctic lands. The great strength and

endurance of these tremendous herbivores make them

highly desirable to giants, who capture and tame them for

use as mounts and beasts of burden.

Suspicious and

unfriendly by nature, grizzly

mastodons are highly protective of their young and their

feeding grounds. They never hesitate to drive away intrud-

ers, stomping underfoot any who are unwise enough to per-

sist. Grizzly mastodons are among the most aggressive crea-

tures alive when it comes to defending their territories

from other groups of mastodons or large herbivores and

protecting their mates and offspring from predators of all

kinds. More than one hungry creature that thought to

make a meal of a young grizzly mastodon has learned a

harsh lesson at the sharp tusks and stomping feet of several

furious adults.

A grizzly mastodon is a shaggy, elephantine creature cov-

ered in gray, brown, or black fur. It is called grizzly because

of the sprinkling of gray hairs throughout its coat, like that

of a grizzly bear. Unlike an elephant, a grizzly mastodon has

two pairs of ivory tusks. The typical adult specimen is 20

feet tall and weighs 22,000 pounds.

COMBAT

In combat, grizzly mastodons gore with their four tusks,

then trample opponents underfoot. They prefer to attack in

groups, but they show no fear even when overmatched if the

safety of their young is at stake.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, a grizzly mastodon

can trample opponents at least one size category smaller

than itself. This attack deals 4d8+18 points of bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack

of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 29) for

half damage.

Scent (Ex): A grizzly mastodon can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

A  durzagon  is  the  result  of

secret crossbreeding between

a devil and an unsuspecting

duergar.  From  time  to  time,

powerful devils disguised as

gray dwarves infiltrate duergar

society,  seeking  out  the  best

mates  to  bear  durzagon  chil-

dren. Most duergar are unaware

that they have attracted the atten-

tion of diabolical forces. The birth

of a half-fiend durzagon is cause

for much celebration in the infer-

nal realms.

A durzagon is slightly taller

and leaner than a gray dwarf, usu-

ally reaching a height of about 5 feet.

The half-fiend is bald but sports a wiry,

gray beard tinged with red streaks. Its

rust-colored skin radiates a palpable

heat, and its fingers end in wickedly

sharp claws.

Durzagons speak Dwarf and

Undercommon. Those who

learn of their diabolic ances-

try also speak Infernal.

124

Though durzagons relish physical combat, they usually

prefer to use spell-like abilities from behind the protection

of duergar guards. In melee, durzagons show no fear; they

would rather fight to the death than submit to an enemy.

Beard (Ex): If a durzagon hits a single opponent with

both claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard as well.

Poison (Ex): A durzagons poison (Fortitude save DC 14) is

a sulfuric fluid delivered with each successful beard attack.

The initial damage is 1d4 points of Strength damage, and the

secondary damage is 1d2 points of Strength drain.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daydarkness, 1/daydesecrate,

enlarge (self only), invisibility, unholy blight. Caster level 10th;

save DC 9 + spell level.

Duergar Traits: A durzagon gains a +1 bonus on attack

rolls against orcs and goblinoids, a +2 bonus on Will saves

against spells and spell-like abilities, and a +4 dodge bo-

nus against giants. It also has stonecunning (+2 racial bonus

on checks to notice unusual stonework; intuit depth).

Immunities (Ex): A durzagon is immune to paralysis,

phantasms, and poisons.

Light Sensitivity: Exposure to bright light (such as sun-

light or a daylight spell) imposes a 2 circumstance penalty

on a durzagons attack rolls.

Outsider Traits: A durzagon cannot be raised or resur-

rected.

Skills: A durzagon gains a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently

checks and a +1 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

DURZAGON SOCIETY

Durzagons almost always hold leadership positions in duer-

gar society, and a large duergar city may have several

durzagon residents. The gray dwarves revere these

creatures as powerful leaders. Dur-

zagons go to great lengths to keep

the knowledge of their powers a

secret  from  their  enemies  and

their allies.

DURZAGON

CHARACTERS

A  durzagons  favored  class  is

cleric. Like duergar, most

durzagons worship the cruel

dwarven deity, Laduguer.

Durzagon clerics can choose

two of the following domains:

Evil, Law, Magic, and Protection.

A durzagon PCs effective

character level (ECL) is equal to

its class level + 7; thus, a 1st-

level  durzagon  cleric  has  an

ECL of 8 and is the equivalent of

a 8th-level character.

ial Plane. They are masterful

power brokers, manipulat-

ing  people  and  events  in

subtle ways. Hellfire wyrms

can steer rulers to fight in

unjust  wars,  or  support

unholy  alliances,  or  even

commit despotic acts against

their people.

A  hellfire  wyrm  is  a

diabolic-looking, winged

dragon with vicious bone

spikes jutting from its head

and shoulders. Smoke rises

continually from its scales,

and its eyes burn an intense

yellow. The monsters scales

shift  in  color  to  give  the

appearance of flowing molten

lava, and they stink of brimstone.

Hellfire wyrms entrench themselves

in regional politics by using their knowl-

edge, wealth, and persuasive abilities to force

through their foul agendas. The typical wyrm does not limit

its actions to any one kingdom, and it often has a different

identity for each realm it visits. It takes great pains to hide

its draconic form, usually assuming the shape of a charis-

matic tiefling when dealing with humanoids and assassi-

nating anyone who learns its true identity. Hellfire wyrms

retreat to secret lairs when not actively scheming.

A hellfire wyrm speaks Draconic, Infernal, and Common,

as well as the languages of any nearby humanoid races.

COMBAT

Utterly fearless and almost unstoppable in battle, hellfire

wyrms are expert tacticians. They keep to the air, slinging mind-

affecting spells and withering breath attacks at their enemies.

Breath Weapon (Su): A hellfire wyrm can breathe a 50-

foot cone of infernal flame that deals 14d10 points of

damage. Each creature caught in the area can attempt a

Reflex save (DC 29) to take half damage. One-half of the

damage from this attack derives from infernal power and is

therefore not subject to reduction by protective elemental

magic. Once the wyrm breathes, it must wait 1d4 rounds

before using its breath weapon again.

Crush (Ex): A flying hellfire wyrm can land on opponents

three or more size categories smaller than itself as a standard

action, using its whole body to crush them. A crush attack

affects as many creatures as can fit under the wyrms body.

Each creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save

(DC 29) or be pinned, automatically taking 2d8+13 points of

bludgeoning damage. Thereafter, if the wyrm chooses to main-

tain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack

(grapple bonus +40). While pinned, the op-

ponent takes crush damage each round.

Frightful Presence (Ex): When a

hellfire wyrm charges, attacks, or flies

overhead, it in-

spires terror in

all creatures within 240 feet

that have fewer Hit Dice or levels

than it has. Each potentially af-

fected opponent must attempt

a Will save (DC 30). On a

failure, a creature with 4 or

fewer  Hit  Dice  becomes  pan-

icked for 4d6 rounds, and one

with 5 or more Hit Dice becomes

shaken for 4d6 rounds. A success-

ful save leaves that opponent

immune to that hellfire wyrms

frightful presence for 24 hours.

Dragons ignore the frightful pres-

ence effect of a hellfire wyrm.

without error, true seeing (divine version), unholy aura, unhallow,

wall of fire. Caster level 20th; save DC 19 + spell level.

Fiendish Form (Su): At will, a hellfire wyrm can produce

an effect like that of a shapechange spell, except that only the

normal form of any tiefling or devil may be assumed.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A hellfire wyrm is immune to fire

damage but takes double damage from cold unless a saving

throw for half damage is allowed. In that case, it takes half

damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Immunities: A hellfire wyrm is immune to sleep and

paralysis effects.

Infernal Aura (Su): Any creature within 5 feet of a hell-

fire wyrm automatically takes 5d4 points of fire damage per

round. It can suppress this aura as a free action.

Keen Senses (Ex): A hellfire wyrm sees four times as

well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in

normal light. It also has darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day, a hellfire wyrm may

summon a single barbazu, cornugon, or gelugon with a

100% chance of success. This ability functions like a summon

monster spell of the appropriate level. A summoned devil

automatically  returns  whence  it  came  after  1  hour.  A

baatezu that has just been summoned cannot use its own

summon ability for 1 hour.

Feats: A creature that is flung by a hellfire wyrm after being

snatched travels 100 feet and takes 10d6 points of damage. If

the hellfire wyrm is flying, the creature takes this damage or

the appropriate falling damage, whichever is greater.

Sly hunters of cavernous subterranean areas, hook horrors

are territorial monsters that distrust intruders and fiercely

protect their hunting grounds. Underground areas where

hook horrors dwell echo with the constant clacking and

scraping sounds of their hooks against stone, as they wend

their way across cliffsides and cavern walls.

A hook horror stands about 9 feet tall and weighs approx-

imately 400 pounds. Its long, powerfully built arms and legs

end in wickedly curved hooks. Its head resembles a vul-

tures, with a monstrous beak. Its torso is shaped like a

beetles body and covered with a rough, stonelike exoskele-

ton, studded with sharp, bony protuberances.

Hook horrors normally live in extended family groups or

clans, each of which is ruled by the eldest female. The eldest

male usually leads the clans hunters and warriors. The clan

stores its eggs communally, in a central, well-defended area

of its home system of caverns or warrens.

Hook horrors are omnivores, consuming lichens, fungi,

plants, and any animals they can catch. Meat is their pre-

ferred  food,  and  drow  is  rumored  to  be  one  of  their

favorite meals.

Hook horrors speak Undercommon.

COMBAT

Hook horrors attack in groups, using their climbing skills to

ambush foes from above. They fight cooperatively and work

together against the largest and best armed opponents.

Hook horrors use their arm hooks to trip foes. If a battle

goes poorly, they retreat by

scaling walls.

Improved Grab

(Ex): If a hook hor-

ror  hits  an  oppo-

nent that is at least

one size category

smaller than itself

with  both  claw

attacks,  it  deals

normal  damage

and attempts to

start  a  grapple

as a free action

without provok-

ing an attack of

opportunity (grap-

ple bonus +18). If it

gets  a  hold,  it  auto-

matically hits with its

rending bite attack on

the same round. (This

replaces its normal

bite attack for that

round.)  There-

after, the hook

horror has the

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:26 PM  Page 127

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

claws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the hook horror is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes during suc-

cessive rounds automatically deals damage for both claw

attacks and a rending bite.

Power Sunder (Ex): A hook horror attempting to

strike a foes weapon or shield does not incur an attack

of opportunity. On a successful power sunder

attack, a hook horror deals double damage.

Rending Bite (Ex): A hook horror can

automatically bite a grabbed foe for

3d6+10 points of damage.

Blindsight (Ex): A hook horror

emits high-frequency sounds, in-

audible to most other creatures, that

bounce off nearby objects and crea-

tures. This ability enables it to dis-

cern objects and creatures within 60 feet. The hook

horror usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks

to notice creatures within range of its blindsight. A silence

spell negates this ability and forces the hook horror to rely

on its weak vision, which has a range of 10 feet.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Exposure to bright light

(such as sunlight or a daylight spell) imposes a 2

penalty on a hook horrors attack rolls.

Skills: *A hook horror receives a +8 racial bonus

on Hide checks when in subterranean areas.

Immoths originate from the coldest regions of the Elemen-

tal Planes of Air and Water, although their thirst for

knowledge takes them to many other planes of

existence. They tend to dwell in forbid-

ding, freezing regions. Though they are

solitary creatures, immoths maintain

contact with others of

their kind, sharing

secrets and coming

to each others aid

when  necessary.

An immoth ap-

pears  as  a  gleam-

ing, 8-foot-tall giant

carved  from  dense,

translucent  ice.  It  re-

sembles a bearded, hulk-

ing dwarf with icy talons

and a large, crystalline tail.

The creature covers itself

with gemlike nuggets of

enchanted ice called

ice runes.

Immoths seem to

be highly curious

about all forms of

humanoid  life,  as

well as arcane and divine

magic, but they generally take a great interest in all

things. They barter with intelligent beings for informa-

tion but show no compunction about taking what they

want by force if more peaceful methods fail. These relent-

less gatherers of knowledge and secrets hide their infor-

mation in icy libraries.

One legend that planar travelers tell speaks of why the

immoths seek out information. The tale goes that long

ago, a powerful, mad sorcerer tried to recruit elementals to

serve him. When they refused, he punished them with a

vile curse: They must seek out and collect the words of his

curse and return them to their planar homea place

referred to in the tale as the Mountain of Ultimate Winter.

According to the story, this place was so cold that spoken

words froze in the air and fell to the ground. The cursed

elementals  who  lived  there  took  on  new  forms  and

became the creatures now known as immoths. They then

began traveling the planes to find the sorcerers words.

This tale bolsters the widely held theory that immoths

believe words themselves to have power. (Certainly, the

verbal components of spells lend some credence to the

idea.) Though the true reasons for their diligent search for

knowledge are unknown, it is clear that the monsters

prize words for their own sake, not merely the knowledge

those words convey.

Immoths eat any sort of living creatures, feeding on the

life essence rather than the actual fleshthough they

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:26 PM  Page 128

nonetheless consume the latter. It is not known how, or

even whether, immoths reproduce.

Immoths speak Aquan, Auran, and Common.

COMBAT

Before  wading  into  battle,  an  immoth  casts  spells

designed to bolster its physical and defensive capabilities.

In melee, it immobilizes as many foes as possible with its

tail poison and uses rune magic to overcome any serious

threats. Most immoths prefer runes that inflict pain or

can debilitate opponents. When seriously threatened,

these monsters flee by walking up the near-

est icy cliff. Then, from on high, they cast

damaging  spells  to  deter

foes from following.

Ice Runes (Sp): Any spell

an  immoth  has  prepared

can be inscribed on an ice

nugget. The  creature  can

trigger the spell contained

in such an ice rune as a free

action. An ice rune remains

magical until triggered by

the immoth. Each im-

moth has at least 3d4+2

ice runes embedded on

its body. Some wonder

whether  this  ability

lends credence to the

story about frozen words

in the Mountain of Ulti-

mate Winter.

Poison (Ex): An immoth

delivers its freezing venom

(Fortitude save DC 19) with

each successful tail attack.

The initial damage is paraly-

sis (1d6+2 rounds), and the

secondary damage is 1 point

of  Intelligence  drain  per

round of paralysis.

Spells:  An  immoth  can

cast arcane spells as a 12th-level sorcerer (spells/day 6/8/7/

7/7/6/3; spells known 9/5/5/4/3/2/1; save DC 15 + spell

level). It cannot cast spells with the fire descriptor.

Cold Subtype (Ex): An immoth is immune to cold

damage but takes double damage from fire unless a saving

throw for half damage is allowed. In that case, the crea-

ture takes half damage on a success and double damage on

a failure.

Elemental Traits (Ex): An immoth is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to critical hits

or flanking, and it cannot be raised or resurrected. The crea-

ture also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Icewalking (Ex): This ability works like the spider climb

128

spell, except that it applies to all icy surfaces and it is

always active.

Immunities (Ex): Because of its dense crystalline body,

an immoth takes only half damage from piercing and slash-

ing weapons.

IXITXACHITL

An ixitxachitl is an aquatic creature very similar to a ray

indeed, many adventurers have mistaken one for the other.

The greatest difference between rays and ixitxachitls is

that the former are simple, inoffensive creatures and the

latter are intelligent, organized, and evil.

Ixitxachitls  create  lairs  by

hollowing  out  coral  reefs  to

form bewildering mazes. From

these strongholds, they wage

war  on  sahuagins,  locathahs,

merfolk, coastal humans, and

any other intelligent crea-

tures  that  encroach  on

their territory. They tend

to  treat  their  homes  as

badly as they do their enemies,

however, stripping them clean

of  all  plant  and  animal  life

before moving on to new, un-

spoiled reefs.

Ixitxachitls  are  universally

despised by all undersea races

for  their  rapacious  life-

style, their aggression,

and their habit of enslav-

ing captives. A large ixitxa-

chitl settlement often contains

twice as many slaves as it does

ixitxachitls. Anything that can

survive underwater can be found

captive in an ixitxachitl maze,

including nixies, gargoyles, and

even humans or elves who are

wearing magic items that allow

underwater breathing.

LGW

AVERAGE IXITXACHITL

Like a manta ray, an average ixitxachitl has a plain brown or

black topside with a lighter-colored underside and a long

tail. But this is where the resemblance ends. An ixitxa-

chitls large mouth is filled with triangular, razor-sharp

teeth, and its eyes are intelligent and cruel.

Combat

Individually, ixitxachitls are quite weak. They seldom attack

unless they have overwhelming numbers or the opportu-

nity to spring an ambush. They have been known to conceal

VAMPIRIC IXITXACHITL

Vampiric ixitxachitls are not undead, though they do

share several traits with vampires, such as long canine

teeth and the ability to drain energy. Vampiric ixitxachitls

are immune to turning attempts and do not possess the

standard undead traits. One of these monsters usually

leads any group of average ixitxachitls.

Combat

If the negative level has not been removed (with a spell such as

restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent

must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 12) to remove it. (The

vampiric ixitxachitl uses its Constitution modifier instead of

its Charisma modifier to determine the save DC.) Failure

means the opponents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Fast Healing (Ex): A vampiric ixitxachitl regains lost

hit points at the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow the vampiric ixitxachitl to regrow or

reattach lost body parts.

Vampiric ixitxachitls prefer to hang back, hidden, and

allow their underlings to enter combat while they size up

the opposition, If the fight is going well, they join in, look-

ing for easy targets. If the outcome seems doubtful, they

try to support their underlings in strikes against the most

dangerous-looking foe.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by a vampiric

ixitxachitls bite attack gains one negative level. For each nega-

tive level bestowed, the vampiric ixitxachitl heals 5 points of

damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage the

creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

IXITXACHITL SOCIETY

Though they are occasionally encountered in rivers that

empty into the sea, most ixitxachitls live in shallow ocean

depths or coral reefs. Once they have selected a site for their

lair, they have their slaves carve out a lair for them. Any group

of ixitxachitls is led by a single powerful individual (usually a

cleric or a vampiric ixitxachitl) that rules by intimidation.

IXITXACHITL CHARACTERS

Some ixitxachitls are accomplished clerics, generally serv-

and Evil domains), but occasionally following Erythnul

specifically. An ixitxachitls favored class is cleric.

An average ixitxachitl PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level + 2. Thus, a 1st-level ixitxa-

chitl cleric has an ECL of 3 and is the equivalent of a 3rd-

level character. A vampiric ixitxachitl PCs effective

character level (ECL) is equal to its class level + 5. Thus,

a 1st-level vampiric ixitxachitl cleric has an ECL of 6 and

is the equivalent of a 6th-level character.

The jahi is an incorporeal undead made of unfulfilled

desires. It attacks by magically dominating its prey.

The jahi appears as a ghostly image of a serpentine, scaled

worm with three elongated faces. Normally, it is found

wrapped around the throat or chest of a creature it has

selected to be its chosen one.

A jahi prefers to work behind the mask of its chosen one,

letting the blame for any excesses fall upon the latter. Once

it has a chosen one, the monster begins to accumulate a

I

H

A

J

130

group of dominated follow-

ers, who form the nucleus

of a debauched cult dedi-

cated to the jahis worship.

The creature feeds off the

Charisma of these followers,

all the while encouraging

them to greater heights of

hedonistic excess.

COMBAT

Jahis are sometimes en-

countered alone, but more

often they have numerous

enslaved individuals nearby.

If encountered alone, the

monster selects the individ-

ual with the most pleasing

appearance  as  its  chosen

one. If it can successfully

dominate that opponent,

it drains his or her Cha-

risma and replaces it with

its own.

Charisma Damage (Su):

Any creature hit by a jahis

incorporeal  touch  attack

takes 1d4 points of Charis-

ma damage (or twice that

amount  on  a  critical  hit).

The jahi heals 5 points of damage (or 10 on a critical hit)

whenever it deals Charisma damage.

Charisma Drain (Su): Each day, a jahis chosen one (if

any) must make a Fortitude save (DC 26) or permanently

lose 1d3 points of Charisma. The jahi heals 5 points of

damage whenever it drains Charisma, gaining any excess as

temporary hit points.

Dominate Person (Sp): Up to four times per day, a jahi

can use dominate person (caster level 20th; save DC 20).

Incorporeal Subtype: A jahi can be harmed only by

other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons,

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The

creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a cor-

poreal source, except for force effects or attacks made with

ghost touch weapons. A jahi can pass through solid objects,

but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural

armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and

force effects work normally against them. A jahi always

moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it

doesnt wish to be.

Invest Charisma (Ex): After draining all the Charisma

from its chosen one, a jahi can automatically adhere to

that creature (usually by wrapping around its throat or

chest) and replace the lost Charisma with its own. While

so invested, the creature uses the jahis Charisma for all

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:27 PM  Page 131

Charisma-based checks. This investment lasts as long as the

jahi and the chosen one are in physical contact. If seriously

threatened, or if it decides to select another chosen one, the

jahi detaches, removing the investment of its Charisma.

At that point, the chosen ones Charisma score falls to 0

and he or she becomes unconscious until at least 1 point of

Charisma has been regained.

Undead Traits: A jahi is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A jahi

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Jermlaines, sometimes called jinxkin or banemidges, are

tiny humanoid-shaped beings with foul dispositions and

evil designs. They are remarkably adept at hiding and

sneaking, so they are the enemies of all who venture

underground.

A jermlaine appears to be a shaggy humanoid about 1 foot

tall. Its eyes are tiny and beady, and its hair is sparse and

filthy. It either dresses in dirty rags and scraps of hide or

simply goes naked. Its skin is baggy, wrinkled, and always

crusted with filth.

Jermlaines speech amounts to high-pitched chitters

and squeaks that are easily mistaken for the noises pro-

duced by rats or bats. (Indeed, rats are among the few

living creatures that will have anything to do with them.)

A few jermlaines can speak Common, Dwarf, Gnome,

Goblin, or Orc, but seldom can any individual speak more

than one of those languages.

COMBAT

Jermlaines attack only from ambush. If an ambush is impos-

sible, they hide and wait until it is feasible. They always try

to single out injured, ill, or sleeping foes as their first targets.

Jermlaines enjoy sneaking into camps and vandalizing or

stealing equipment, so long as they stand a good chance of

getting away without combat.

Rather than confront an enemy, jermlaines prefer to dig

pits or build net-dropping traps and other

devices that can capture prey

without a fight. Once an en-

emy is caught in a pit or a

net,  jermlaines  swarm

over him, pummeling to

cause  subdual  damage

until the target is knocked

out. They have also been

known to pour acid or

flaming  oil  over

trapped foes that

too

appeared

dangerous to ap-

proach directly,

even while trapped.

Speak with Rats

(Sp): At will, a jerm-

laine can produce an

effect like that of a speak

with animals spell (caster

level 3rd), except that it

enables communica-

tion only with rats

and  dire  rats.

A juggernaut is a stony behemoth that serves as a weapon of

war. Whether deployed to soften up the enemy prior to an

invasion or used for defensive purposes, a juggernaut com-

bines sheer size and magical abilities into a potent, nearly

unstoppable force.

A juggernaut appears

as a squat, square or round

stone building situated

atop wide stone rollers.

Six sturdy stone arms jut

from its sides, three on

the  right  and  three  on

the left. A juggernaut is

often  decorated  with

frightening stone carv-

ings and horrific painted

icons, making it a terrible

sight to behold. Occa-

sionally a juggernaut is

constructed  with  an

interior  hiding  space

that can accommodate

up to two Medium-size

creatures safely.

COMBAT

A juggernaut attacks by

rolling slowly forward,

crushing all in its path

to dust. Those who avoid

this attack find them-

selves  targeted  by  the

132

constructs powerful fists, which try to force them under its

rollers. A juggernaut targets escaping foes with spell-like

abilities that hinder or block movement, and then changes

direction to roll over immobile creatures. It stops only when

changing direction or when blocked by some insurmount-

able obstacle. A juggernaut uses wall of force not only to block

fleeing opponents, but also to make bridges over rivers and

chasms so that it can pursue escaping targets.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a juggernaut hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +31). If it gets a hold, it can

attempt to thrust the opponent under its rollers in the next

round, dealing automatic squash damage. Alternatively, the

juggernaut has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use its hand to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but the juggernaut is not considered grap-

pled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals slam damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willforcecage, grease, hold mon-

ster, magic missile, slow, wall of force, web. Caster level 18th; save

DC 13 + spell level.

Squash (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a juggernaut can literally roll over opponents at least

one  size  category  smaller  than  itself. This  attack  deals

10d10+20 points of bludgeoning damage. A squashed oppo-

nent  can  attempt  either  an

attack of opportunity at a 4

penalty or a Reflex save (DC

29) for half damage. A suc-

cessful saving throw indi-

cates that the target has

been pushed back or aside

(targets choice) as the jug-

gernaut moves forward.

All-Around  Vision

(Ex): A juggernaut can see

in all directions at once.

Because of this ability, it

gains a +4 racial bonus on

Search and Spot checks,

and it cannot be flanked.

Construct Traits: A

juggernaut is immune to

mind-affecting effects,

poison,  sleep,  paralysis,

stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic ef-

fects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on

objects. The creature is

not subject to critical hits,

subdual damage, ability

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:27 PM  Page 133

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A juggernaut has

darkvision (60-foot range).

Fast Healing (Ex): A juggernaut regains lost hit points at

the rate of 10 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does

not allow the juggernaut to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Immunities (Ex): A juggernaut is immune to acid, elec-

tricity, and fire.

CONSTRUCTION

Since a juggernaut is constructed from

massive blocks of granite and other dense

stone, a typical specimen weighs at least

50,000 pounds. It costs 70,000 gp to create,

including 5,000 gp for the body. Assembling

the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting)

or Profession (mason) check (DC 18). The creator

must be 18th level and able to cast arcane spells. Com-

pleting the ritual drains 2,000 XP from the creator and

requires the bulls strength, geas/quest, limited wish, poly-

morph any object, forcecage, grease, hold monster,

magic missile, slow, wall of force, and web spells.

Villagers often tell stories of the julajimus to their children.

At some point in such a tale, the main character, a child,

takes in a cute animal as a pet despite repeated warnings

from his or her parents that there isnt enough food or space

for the creature. The story ends with the rebellious child

hiding the creature, only to have it turn into a julajimus one

night and eat the child alive. In fact, the name julajimus is

derived from an ancient phrase julaji molus, or eater of

children. Ancient texts hint that the cult of an evil god cre-

ated the first julajimuses from human prisoners.

A julajimus stands a bit more than 18 feet tall and

looks somewhat like a massive baboon. Its arms are

long and muscular, with four fully articulated joints

each. The monster has dark blue or black fur cov-

ering its body, plus a long, blue, reptilian

tail. The mouth of a julajimus is dispro-

portionally large for the head and filled

with  razor-sharp  teeth  the  size  of

scimitar blades.

Julajimuses are territorial, gath-

ering in pairs only once per decade

to mate. The presence of a jula-

jimus in an area has a strange

effect on nearby wild-

life, causing animals to

become more aggres-

sive  than  normal. The

monster is not afraid of

civilization,  and  the

lights of a village

at  night  can  at-

tract a curious

julajimus  to

i n v e s t i g a t e .

Julajimuses

speak Common.

COMBAT

The julajimus enjoys the sensation of gnawing on living

creatures, so it always attacks with its bite first, then follows

up with slashes from its two claws. Despite its size, the jula-

jimus is fast and can easily outrun most prey.

Fear Aura (Su): A julajimus radiates a fear aura that can

chill the blood of the bravest warrior. Any living creature

within 20 feet of the monster must make a Will save (DC 20)

or become frightened. Anyone who saves successfully is

immune to this ability for 24 hours. Each round, a fright-

ened subject gets a new saving throw at the same DC. This is

a mind-affecting fear effect.

Roar (Su): Three times per day, a julajimus can loose an ear-

splitting roar that can be heard for miles. Every creature within

60 feet must make a Fortitude save (DC 23) or become deaf-

ened for 3d6 hours and take 6d6 points of subdual damage.

Stunning (Su): If a julajimus successfully scores a critical

hit with its claws, the opponent must make a Fortitude save

133

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:27 PM  Page 134

(DC 23) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds by the force of the

blow. A stunned creature is unable to act and loses any posi-

tive Dexterity bonus to AC. Furthermore, any attacker gains

a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it.

Enchantment Immunity (Ex): A julajimus is immune

to all spells of the Enchantment school.

Polymorph Self (Su): At will, a julajimus can produce an

effect like that of the polymorph self spell, except that the

only forms it can assume are those of small, cuddly animals

(such as a rabbit, chipmunk, or kitten), and reverting to its

true form is a free action. This ability helps the julajimus

lull its victim into a false sense of security before it shifts

into its natural form to attack.

Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex): A julajimus becomes

paralyzed when exposed to sunlight. Each round, it can

make a Fortitude save (DC 20) to resist the paralysis.

Once paralyzed, it is helpless, although its damage reduc-

tion and fire resistance still make it difficult to kill. The

paralysis lasts for 1d4 rounds after the exposure to sun-

light ends.

Skills: *A julajimus receives a +10 on Disguise checks

when using its polymorph self ability.

Many generations ago, the koprus built a large and mysteri-

ous civilization under the sea. For unknown reasons their

society declined, becoming ever more decrepit and degen-

erate, until now almost none of its former glory remains.

JE

A kopru resembles no known creature, but it combines

several familiar features into one monstrous whole. Its body

is vaguely eellike but ends in three long, flexible, barbed

tails. Its chest is nearly human, and the hands on its two

arms end in vicious webbed claws. Its head grows directly

from its trunk, like a fishs, and has large, unblinking eyes.

The mouth is surrounded by four tentaclesan oddity that

has led some scholars to propose that the koprus may some-

how be related to mind flayers.

Koprus speak Common and Aquan.

COMBAT

Out of the water, a kopru is nearly helpless. On land, it

cannot attack with its claws because it needs its arms to drag

itself across the ground or prop its body up. A kopru in

water, however, is a ferocious opponent in melee combat.

Along with its claws and teeth, it lashes out with its tails, all

three of which strike as one.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a kopru

can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing 3d6+3 points of

bludgeoning damage.

Dominate Person (Su): Once per day, a kopru can pro-

duce an effect like that of a dominate person spell (caster level

10th; Will save DC 14), except that the range is 180 feet and

the duration is eight days.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a kopru hits an opponent that is its

own size or smaller with a tail attack, it deals normal damage

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:27 PM  Page 135

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +17, includ-

ing a +7 racial bonus on grapple checks). If it gets a hold, it also

constricts in the same round. Thereafter, the kopru has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tails

to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the

kopru is not considered grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check it makes during successive rounds auto-

matically deals tail and constrict damage.

KOPRU SOCIETY

Kopru society is matriarchal and savage. The monsters live

in underwater caves, often near the sites of their ancient,

ruined cities. But these reminders of their former glory only

serve to increase their bitterness.

Damage: Tentacle rake 1d8+4 plus

Though it has a head, it possessses no recognizable facial fea-

tures. Its body is slick, as if coated with a thin layer of clear

slime, and it has an impossibly bloated stomach.

COMBAT

Leechwalkers are incapable of sizing up prey, so they fearlessly

go straight for the kill, regardless of their opponents capabili-

ties. They usually try to grab their foes, hoping to drain blood

through the thousands of mouths that make up their hides.

Blood Drink (Ex): A leechwalker can drink the blood

from a grabbed victim with a successful grapple check. This

attack deals 2d4 points of Constitution drain.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a leechwalker hits an opponent

that is its own size or smaller with a tentacle rake attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +13). If it gets a hold, it can use its blood drink ability in

the same round. Thereafter, the leechwalker has the option to

conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tentacle to

hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the

leechwalker is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds auto-

matically deals tentacle rake

and blood drink damage.

The leechwalker is a thirsty vermin that can drain a creature

of all its blood in a matter of moments. It usually lurks in

swamps or damp underground areas.

A leechwalker appears to be a massive, 6-foot-tall human-

oid covered with thousands of dark, writhing leeches.

Wounding (Ex): A wound

resulting  from  a  leech-

walkers tentacle rake attack

bleeds for an additional 3

points  of  damage  per

round thereafter. Multi-

ple wounds from such

attacks result in cumula-

tive bleeding loss (two

wounds for 6 points of

damage per round, and

so on). The bleeding can

be stopped only by a suc-

cessful Heal check (DC

10) or the application of

a cure spell or some other

healing  spell  (heal, healing

circle, or the like).

All-Around Vision (Ex):

A leechwalker can see in all

directions at once. Because of

this ability, it gains a +4 racial bonus

MC

on Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be flanked.

Immunities: Because of the verminous covering of its

body, a leechwalker takes half damage from bludgeoning

weapons.  It  is  not  subject  to  subdual  damage,  ability

damage, ability drain, or death from massive damage.

Vermin Traits: A leechwalker is immune to all mind-

affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,

and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).

LEGENDARY ANIMALS

Throughout the world, legends describe extraordinary ani-

mals of incredible strength, speed, and power. Such an animal

may have saved a village, fended off a pack of predators to pro-

tect the young, aided some legendary hero on a divine quest,

or guided a lost child to safety. These are legendary animals.

According to some theories, such creatures have been

imbued with power beyond that of all other animals

so that they can serve as natures defenders. In fact,

they do not exist at all until a need for them

arises. Legendary animals are cre-

ated from normal animals of their

kind through the power of nature

(or a deity) whenever a character

of appropriate level needs such a

companion. Thus, they are rarely

encountered outside the presence

of  a  high-level  druid  or  some

other advanced character.

COMBAT

Legendary animals are no larger

than normal animals of the same

kind, but they are considerably

more dangerous in combat.

Saving Throws: A legendary

animal has all good saves.

LEGENDARY EAGLE

With its feathers of bright white

and brilliant yellow, the legendary

eagle is considered an omen of good

weather and good times to come.

Combat

Like all birds of prey, the legendary eagle is a carnivore

that hunts other birds, as well as small reptiles, snakes, and

mammals. It attacks from the air with its claws and beak.

Skills: *A legendary eagle receives a +12 racial bonus on

Spot checks made in daylight.

LEGENDARY APE

This ape appears little different from the common gorilla in

its markings, but even the casual observer can tell that it is

stronger, faster, and tougher than others of its kind.

Combat

Legendary apes are aggressive and territorial. They drop on

opponents from trees to rend flesh with their powerful

claws and teeth.

Rend (Ex): If a legendary ape hits a single target with

both claws, it latches onto the opponents body and tears the

flesh. This attack deals 2d8+15 points of damage.

Scent (Ex): A legendary ape can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

LEGENDARY WOLF

A fierce-looking wolf with black, white, or gray fur, this

animal is generally not aggressive toward humanoids,

though extreme hunger may make it attack.

Combat

A legendary wolf encountered singly may fight, or may

retreat to assemble the pack. Whenever possible, legendary

wolves live, move, and hunt in packs.

Trip (Ex): A legendary wolf that hits

with a bite attack can attempt to trip the

opponent as a free action (see Trip in

Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook) with-

out making a touch attack or provoking

an attack of opportunity. If the attempt

fails, the opponent cannot react to

trip the legendary wolf.

Scent (Ex): A legendary wolf

can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track

by sense of smell.

Skills: A legendary wolf

receives a +2 racial bonus on

Listen, Move Silently, and Spot

checks, and a +4 racial bonus

on Hide checks. *It also receives

a +8 racial bonus on Wilderness

Lore checks when tracking by

scent.

JE

LEGENDARY SNAKE

A strong constrictor with a potent

venomous bite, the legendary snake is

found in underwater lakes, rivers, and streams. It

attacks only when threatened.

Combat

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a leg-

endary snake can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing

1d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a legendary snake hits a Large or

smaller opponent with a bite attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +24). If it

gets a hold, it can constrict in the same round. Thereafter,

the legendary snake has the option to conduct the grapple

normally, or simply use its coils to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the legendary snake is not

considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite and constrict damage.

Poison (Ex): A legendary snake delivers its poison (For-

titude save DC 25) with each successful bite attack. The ini-

tial and secondary damage is the same (1d8 points of Con-

stitution damage).

The legendary bear doesnt usually attack humans. Its diet

consists primarily of plants and fish.

Combat

Improved  Grab  (Ex): If  a  legendary  bear  hits  a

Medium-size or smaller opponent with a claw attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +32). Thereafter, the legendary bear has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

its claw to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the legendary bear is not considered grap-

pled). In either case, each successful grapple check it

makes during successive rounds automatically deals

claw damage.

LEGENDARY TIGER

The legendary tiger is the fiercest and most dangerous land

predator in the animal kingdom. It measures 810 feet long

and weighs up to 600 pounds.

Combat

A legendary tiger prefers to attack from ambush, pouncing

on its prey.

Improved  Grab  (Ex): If  a  legendary  tiger  hits  a

Medium-size or smaller opponent with a bite attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +34). If it gets a hold, it can attempt to rake

in the same round. Thereafter, the legendary tiger has the

138

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:28 PM  Page 139

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the legendary tiger is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals bite damage.

Pounce (Ex): If a legendary tiger charges, it can make a

full attack (including a rake attempt, see below) even

though it has moved.

Rake (Ex): In any round that a legendary tiger has a hold

on an opponent (see Improved Grab, above), it can make

two rake attacks (+29 melee) with its hind legs for 2d6+5

points of damage each. The legendary tiger can also attempt

to rake when it pounces on an opponent.

Scent (Ex): A legendary tiger can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A legendary tiger receives a +8 racial bonus on

both Hide and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grasses

or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +16.

LEGENDARY SHARK

The legendary shark hunts anything it finds in the sea.

Combat

Improved Grab (Ex): If a legendary shark hits a Large or

smaller opponent with a bite attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +39). If it

gets a hold, it can try to swallow in the next round. Alter-

natively, the legendary shark has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use its mouth to hold the oppo-

nent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the legendary

shark is not considered grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check it makes during successive rounds

automatically deals bite damage.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A legendary shark can swallow a

Large or smaller creature by making a successful grapple

check (grapple bonus +39), provided it already has that

opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once

inside the legendary shark, the opponent

takes 2d8+13 points of bludgeoning

damage plus 1d8+4 points of acid

damage per round from the sharks

stomach. A successful grapple check

allows the swallowed creature to

climb out of the stomach and return

to  the  legendary  sharks  mouth,

where another successful grapple

check is needed to get free. Alterna-

tively, a swallowed creature can try to

cut its way out with either claws or a light

piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at

least 50 points of damage to the stom-

ach (AC 18) in this way creates an opening

large enough to permit escape. Once a single

swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole;

thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

A legendary sharks stomach can hold up to 2 Large, 8

Medium-size, 32 Small, or 128 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Keen Scent (Ex): A legendary shark notices creatures by

scent in a 180-foot radius and detects blood in the water at a

range of up to 1 mile.

The leviathan is an immense sea creature that takes up resi-

dence in a stretch of water, usually a very deep strait, and ter-

rorizes shipping through that zone for years. It sinks some

ships and lets others pass without interference, according to

its own unfathomable whims. Decades

may pass without a sighting; then, for no apparent reason, the

attacks resume, usually in a new location. Whether this is the

same beast awakened from hibernation, the same beast some-

how reborn, or an entirely new creature is unknown.

The leviathan is an immense whale of almost unimagin-

able proportions. Some have seen its head, others have seen

its tail, but those who have seen enough of the monster to

determine its actual size and appearance are dead.

Wherever the leviathan goes, other sea predators follow,

because a sinking ship produces a rich feeding ground for

sharks, barracudas, many varieties of giant fish, dark rays, and

even sahuagin and locathah. Although the leviathan itself has

no interest in treasure, the sea bed beneath its hunting ground

becomes a graveyard for the contents of sunken ships. Many

of these hulks are laden with treasure and valuable cargo.

COMBAT

Obviously, a creature such as the leviathan has no natural ene-

mies. Everything in the ocean is its prey, but ships seem to be

the only things that catch its attention. Once it breaches or

swamps a ship, the leviathan circles back and begins scooping

the bodies of both the living and the dead into its 20-foot-

wide mouth. Its tactics imply a level of anger and a desire to

spread destruction that contradict its low Intelligence score.

Gulp (Ex): A leviathan can swallow a Huge or smaller

creature by making a successful bite attack. The monsters

interior contains a mass of surging water. Each swallowed

creature must make a Swim check (DC 15) every round.

Success means the swallowed creature takes 1d3 points of

subdual damage but can attack the leviathan from inside

with any weapon other than a bow or crossbow. Failure

means the swallowed creature takes 1d6 points of subdual

damage and must immediately make a second Swim check

(DC 15) to avoid going underwater and starting to drown.

Anyone attacking the leviathan from the inside hits auto-

matically. If the leviathan takes 50 points of damage from

the inside, it disgorges the entire contents of its stomach.

Ramming (Ex): Once every 12 rounds, a leviathan can

move at up to 720 feet and ram a Large or smaller creature or

any sort of ship. To ram, the leviathan must end its movement

in the targets space. If the target is a ship, the creature always

precedes this attack with a long surface approach so everyone

aboard can see whats coming. This attack deals 8d6+22 points

of damage. If the target is a creature, it can attempt either an

attack of opportunity or a Reflex save (DC 31) for half damage.

Upon ramming a ship, the leviathan can make a Strength

check to breach its hull, which causes it to sink in 1d10 min-

utes. The break DC varies with the type of vessel rammed, as

follows: rowboat DC 20, keelboat DC 23, sailing ship or long-

ship DC 25, warship DC 27, or galley DC 30. (See Chapter 5 of

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for information about ships.)

Regardless of the check result, every creature aboard must

attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC 15). Success means the crea-

ture takes 1d10 points of damage from being thrown about by

the impact; failure means the creature is hurled overboard.

Swamping (Ex): Once every 12 rounds, a leviathan can

create waves up to 40 feet high by rising from the water

and then slamming its enormous tail flukes or head against

the surface. This causes any sailing vessel within 300 feet

to capsize if the character steering it fails a Profession

(sailor) check (DC 15). A modifier applies to this check

based on the type of ship, as follows: rowboat 2, warship +0,

galley or keelboat +3, sailing ship +5, longship +7. Any crea-

ture flung into the water by a capsizing ship must succeed at

a Swim check (DC 15) or immediately begin drowning.

LINNORM

Linnorms are truly primeval creatures thought to be offshoots

of dragons. No young ones have been sighted for centuries, so

it is possible that these monsters are dying out. At any rate, by

dragon accounting, the youngest known linnorms are ancient,

and the more powerful individuals are even older than that.

A linnorm is easily distinguished from its more numer-

ous draconic cousins by its lack of wings and rear legs. A

linnorm has an immense, serpentine body, and it moves

through a combination of walking with its forelegs and

snakelike slithering.

No good or lawful linnorms are known to exist; these

creatures are universally hateful, spiteful, and cruel. None

of the three varieties is known for keeping its word or for

honoring bargains. About the best that can be said of lin-

norms is that not all of them are avaricious.

Linnorms speak Draconic and Abyssal.

COMBAT

Linnorms rely on their breath weapons and prodigious

strength in battle. They are also brilliant tacticians and

strategists, so they usually delay attacking until conditions

are to their advantage. Once battle is joined, they quickly

single out the most dangerous foes for swift elimination.

Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard

action. Once a linnorm breathes, it must wait 1d4 rounds

before using a breath weapon again, no matter how many

kinds it has. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at

the linnorms mouth and extends in a direction of its choice,

with an area as noted in the description. At the time of use,

the linnorm can choose to shape its breath weapon into

either a line or a cone. The exact dimensions vary with the

variety of linnorm (see the individual descriptions), but

lines are always 5 feet high and 5 feet wide, and cones are as

high and wide as they are long. If the breath weapon deals

damage, each creature caught in the area can attempt a

Reflex save (see individual descriptions for DCs) to take half

damage. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the

same DC, but the types vary as noted.

Crush (Ex): A flying linnorm can land on opponents three

or more size categories smaller than itself as a standard action.

A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the lin-

norms body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed

weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking the given amount

of bludgeoning damage. Thereafter, if the linnorm chooses to

maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. While

pinned, the opponent takes crush damage each round.

Tail Sweep: A linnorm can sweep with its tail as a stan-

dard action. The sweep affects creatures four or more size

categories smaller than the linnorm within a 20-foot-radius

half-circle centered on the linnorms rear. Each affected

creature that fails a Reflex save (DC equal to that for the lin-

norms breath weapon) takes the given amount of damage; a

successful save halves the damage.

Blindsight (Ex): A linnorm can ascertain its surround-

ings by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but

also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues).

This ability enables it to discern objects and creatures

within 120 feet. A linnorm usually does not need to make

Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of

its blindsight.

Immunities: A linnorm is immune to sleep and paralysis

effects.

Keen Senses (Ex): A linnorm sees four times as well a

human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal

light. It also has darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

The body of a gray linnorm is long, sleek, and very

snakelike. It never uses its two arms to drag or support

itself; instead it moves entirely as a snake, keeping the front

portion of its body raised upright at all times. Its scales form

a subtle pattern of variegated gray.

A gray linnorm lays claim to all that it can see, so it always

seeks out a natural cave in a high place with a commanding

view. By extension, any other creature it sees is a trespasser,

and it never tolerates trespassers in its territory. As soon as it

spots intruders, it moves to attack, usually via either magi-

cal flight or wind walking. A gray linnorm does not pause

to study its foes or lay a careful trap; instead, it relies on

speed, terror, and overwhelming offense.

damage is 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and the sec-

ondary damage is 2d6 points of Constitution damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willfly, protection from arrows;

3/daycontagion, meld into stone, shapechange, wind walk.

Caster level 17th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Spells: A gray linnorm can cast divine spells as a 17th-

level cleric. It has access to spells from the Destruction

and Evil domains (spells/day 6/6/6/6/6/4/4/3/2/1; save

DC 14 + spell level).

Feats: A creature that is flung by a gray linnorm after being

snatched travels 70 feet and takes 7d6 points of damage. If the

gray linnorm is flying, the creature takes this damage or the

appropriate falling damage, whichever is greater.

A gray linnorm casts as many spells as possible while closing

in on enemies, but it prefers fighting tooth and claw to

standing off and pelting foes with magic. On the other

hand, it prefers casting spells to taking a beating, so it always

errs on the side of survival. In dire straits, a gray linnorm

typically uses meld into stone to hide, and then wind walk or

some other spell to leave the area.

Acid Breath (Su): A gray linnorm can breathe caustic

slime in either a 50-foot cone or a 100-foot line. This attack

deals 6d8 points of acid damage, or half that amount on a

successful Reflex save (DC 21). On a failed save, the slime

also eats away the targets nonmagical metal weapons and

armor, making them useless in 1d6+5 rounds.

Poison (Ex): The tip of a gray linnorms tail carries a ven-

omous stinger that delivers its poison (Fortitude save DC

21) with each successful tail slap attack. The initial

The dread linnorm is the largest of the linnorms. These crea-

tures are aggressively territorial, defending their vast lairs

vigorously against intruders.

A dread linnorm can grow to an immense length. Two

shaggy, draconic heads, each at the end of its own long, ser-

pentine neck, top its mammoth body. A dread linnorms

scales are primarily charcoal black, but they shimmer and

flicker from black to gray as if lit from within.

This creature prefers to lair in a cave located in some

remote, desolate place. Few natural caverns are big enough

to house a dread linnorm comfortably, so it usually devotes

considerable energy over the course of several centuries to

excavating its home. Eventually, its lair becomes a tremen-

dous subterranean labyrinth of twisting corridors, plung-

ing shafts, lakes, hot springs, and fabulous natural grottoes,

which  can  stretch

for  miles  below

the  surface.  In-

vaders could wan-

without

the monster. The

creature also fits

out its lair with

deadly  traps  to

capture, bewilder,

or  kill  intruders.

These obstacles are

often built around nat-

ural perils, such as scald-

ing  geysers,  and  some-

times they include triggers

for  hazards,  such  as  massive

rockfalls that can seal passages.

Treasure is not as important to a dread

linnorm as it is to a dragon. A typical dread lin-

norm accumulates immense wealth over its long life but

142

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:28 PM  Page 143

cares little for it. Most of its treasure lies forgotten wherever

it was dropped after a brief examination. Given the exten-

siveness of the creatures lair and the casual way it leaves

valuables strewn about, it might seem easy to sneak in,

scoop up a few bags of gold and silver, and slip away unseen.

In fact, however, such an act unfailingly brings severe retri-

bution. A dread linnorm doesnt care whether a thief stole a

sack of gems, an ancient magic rod, or a bucket of rocks; it

cares only that the sanctity of its lair was violated and its

possessions stolen. Should this occur, it does all in its

power to recover the stolen items and punish the thieves.

Failing that, it vents its rage on its surroundings, laying

waste to the countryside, leveling villages, burning crops,

and devouring livestock.

Dread linnorms are always surly and uncommunicative.

Combat

A dread linnorm relies primarily on its twin breath weapons

and its spells in combat. Once its opponents are severely

damaged, it switches to melee attacks.

Breath Weapon (Su): As a standard action, a dread lin-

norm can breathe either with one head or with both heads

simultaneously.  It  can  produce  two  different  breath

weapons, cold or fire, each as either a 70-foot cone or a 140-

foot line. Each head can use a different breath weapon,

shape its breath weapon differently, or both. Whatever the

shape, the cold breath deals 12d6 points of cold damage and

the fire breath deals 12d6 points of fire damage. A successful

Reflex save (DC 30) halves the damage from either attack. A

creature caught in both breath weapons is affected by both

and must save against each one separately.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature bitten by either

head of a dread linnorm gains one negative level. For each

negative level bestowed, the dread linnorm heals 5 points of

damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage

the creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit

points. If the negative level has not been removed (with a

spell such as restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the

afflicted opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 25)

to remove it. Failure means the opponents level (or Hit

CORPSE TEARER

This hideous beast is generally considered to be the worst of

a  very  bad  lot.  Characters  who  are  lucky  enough  to

encounter the creature in one of its rare, agreeable moods

discover that it is knowledgeable about many ancient, magi-

cal mysteries. Whatever its initial mood, however, no meet-

ing with it is likely to end without bloodshed unless the

intruders pay a staggering dutyand even that is no guar-

antee of safety.

A corpse tearers immense body is only a little shorter

than that of a dread linnorm, but it usually keeps itself in

a compact shape. Its scales are covered with slime, fungus,

moss, lichen, and tufts of branching cilia. When it is lying

still, a corpse tearer resembles an enormous, ancient,

fallen tree.

Corpse tearers adjust easily to any climate or terrain, but

they always make their homes beneath ancient burial

grounds. Their lairs are usually guarded by their undead

servantseverything from skeletons to very powerful

undead such as vampires and banshees. These creatures are

often the remains of adventurers who came looking for

treasure, or just unlucky travelers who wandered too near

the creatures territory. When not on guard duty, these

undead tunnel into the ancient graves above the corpse

tearers lair in search of more gold, gems, and other treas-

ures to increase its hoard.

Combat

A corpse tearer seldom fights in its lair becuase it prefers

that intruders never find its home. Instead, when a threat

draws near, it sends out undead minions to delay the

strangers and learn their weaknesses. Then, when it feels

that it has enough information about its foes, it takes to the

sky and attacks with its breath weapons and spells, crushing

or clawing paralyzed characters as the opportunity arises. It

falls back on teeth and claws only as a last resort.

Breath Weapon (Su): As a standard action, a corpse

tearer can breathe either paralysis or disease, each as

either a 60-foot cone or a 120-foot line. The paralysis

breath forces each living creature caught in its area to suc-

ceed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 32) or be paralyzed

for 1d6+12 rounds. Every living creature caught in the

area of the corpse tearers disease breath must succeed at a

Fortitude save (DC 32) or contract linnorm fever. The

incubation period is 12 hours, and the disease deals 1d6

points of Strength damage and 1d3 points of Constitution

damage  (see  Disease  in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide).

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by a corpse

tearers claw gains one negative level. For each negative

level bestowed, the corpse tearer heals 5 points of damage.

If the amount of healing is more than the damage the crea-

ture has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

If the negative level has not been removed (with a spell

such  as  restoration)  before  24  hours  have  passed,  the

Loxos are usually peaceful creatures, but they defend their

territories and families with great tenacity. They are among

the most dangerous of all desert dwellers to those who incur

their wrath.

A loxo appears to be a humanoid elephant. Its skin is

bluish-gray, wrinkled, and covered with rough, sparse

hair. It has thick, round limbs, flat feet, short, stubby fin-

gers, and large ears. Its most striking feature is the pair of

trunks that grow from its face, framed by large tusks.

Each trunk is about 2 feet long and has three fingerlike

digits at the end. The typical loxo prefers simple, rustic

clothing, particularly cut from cloth patterned with cir-

cles or diamonds.

Loxos speak their own language and Common.

COMBAT

Loxos prefer melee to ranged combat, and they use thrown

weapons only when they cant close with enemies. If a herd

is threatened, the adult male loxos charge intruders while

the females move the young to a defensible location. Once

the young are secure, the males make a fighting retreat

toward the females, so that they too can join the melee.

Berserk Rage (Ex): A loxo that sees a clan member

killed or incapacitated enters a berserk rage. For 6 rounds,

the  loxo  gains  a  +4  bonus  to  Strength,  a  +4  bonus  to

Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but

144

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:28 PM  Page 145

takes a 2 penalty to Armor Class. The following changes

are in effect as long as the berserk rage lasts: HD 5d10+15

(37 hp); AC 12, touch 8, flat-footed 11; Atk +10 melee

(2d8+9,  Huge  morningstar)  and  +5  melee  (2d6+3,  2

slams), or +10 melee (1d6+6, 2 slams), or +5 melee (1d8+6,

Large javelin); SA trample 1d8+9 (DC 18); SV Fort +4, Ref

+5, Will +6; Str 23, Con 17; Climb +8. After the berserk

rage ends, the loxo is fatigued (2 penalty to Strength, 2

penalty to Constitution, cant charge or run) until the end

of the encounter.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a loxo can trample Medium-size or smaller oppo-

nents. This attack deals 1d8+6 points of bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an

attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC

16) for half damage.

LOXO SOCIETY

Loxo herds are seminomadic. They move about, grazing

and harvesting fruits and nuts from groves of trees they

have planted. When they reach a grove or a good area for

grazing, they build temporary huts to serve as shelter

until its time to move on. Loxos need massive amounts of

grass and other vegetable material to fuel their big bodies.

When not eating, these creatures create rustic works of

art, which they barter for items

or tools they need.

Loxo herds are divided

into clans, and all members

of a clan wear the same

pattern of clothing. Each

herd has a chief (called

a lox-fithik, or herd-

lieutenant), who is a

ranger, and a tunnuk,

who has at least two

levels of wizard.

LOXO

CHARACTERS

A loxos preferred char-

acter class is ranger. Loxo

rangers choose favored

enemies from among the

most common threats to

their territories and habitats.

A loxo PCs effective

character level (ECL) is

equal to its class level + 7; thus,

a 1st-level loxo ranger has an

ECL of 8 and is the equivalent

of an 8th-level character.

A marrash (plural marrashi) is a plague bearer that spreads

disease through combat.

H

Physically, a marrash resembles a winged

gnoll, except that it has birdlike talons on its

hands and feet and double-jointed, bird-

like legs. It stands about 5 feet tall and

has a 10-foot wingspan. Occasionally

wizards or sorcerers summon mar-

rashi to the Material Plane to act

as guards, assassins, or instru-

ments of terror or revenge.

Every marrash carries a

longbow and a quiver of

arrows. About a third

of its arrows are vec-

tors for disease; the

rest are normal except

for onea magic tak-

lif arrow. Any creature

hit by this arrow con-

tracts a disease similar

to the marrash variant

of  filth  fever  (see  Disease,

below), except that the spirit

of a new marrash is generated

within the victims body. When the

infected creature dies, the marrash

spirit devours its soul over the next 1d6

days. Upon completing that process, the

newborn marrash rises in the victims reconstituted corpse,

which assumes the form of a marrash.

Like most outer-planar beings, marrashi are not willing

servants for summoners. A marrash bound to serve a mortal

tries to use its taklif arrow on its master without the latters

knowledge, in the hope that the newborn marrash will

release its parent from bondage.

Marrashi speak Common and Infernal.

COMBAT

Marrashi consider themselves weak and vulnerable on the

ground, so they take to the air whenever possible.

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by a marrashs disease

arrow must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or contract a

more virulent outer-planar version of filth fever. The incu-

bation period is 1d3 days, and the disease deals 1d3 points of

Dexterity damage and 1d3 points of Constitution damage

(see Disease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Each day thereafter that the disease lasts, the infected crea-

ture must also succeed at a second Fortitude save (DC 14), or

1  point  each  of  that  days  Dexterity  and  Constitution

damage becomes Constitution drain instead.

Double Bowfire (Ex): In battle, a flying marrash grips

its longbow with its taloned feet and draws the string with

both hands. This unusual technique allows it to fire two

arrows nearly simultaneously at its highest attack bonus

as a full attack action.

Taklif Arrow: Any creature hit by a taklif arrow must suc-

ceed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or contract a dis-

ease similar to the marrash variant of filth

fever (see Disease, above). The incuba-

tion period is 1 day, and the disease deals 1d3

points of Dexterity damage and 1d3 points

of Constitution damage (see Dis-

ease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide). However, a crea-

ture that fails any Fortitude saving

throw after its initial infec-

tion dies instantly, and nei-

ther raise dead nor resurrec-

tion can restore it to life.

The corpse rises as a new

marrash 1d6 days later.

Protection from Arrows (Sp):

A marrash can use protection

from arrows, as the spell, at

will. Caster level 10th.

Outsider Traits: A mar-

rash has darkvision (60-

foot range). It cannot be

raised or resurrected.

Scent  (Ex): A  marrash

can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes,

and track by sense of smell.

These dreadful, pitiful creatures were once humans,

dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings.

Through indescribable tortures, they

were transformed into the hideous

creatures known as meenlocks.

Now they themselves carry

on  their  forebears  grisly

work, kidnapping travelers

and adventurers and inflicting

the same nightmarish metamor-

phosis upon them.

A meenlock is a grotesque,

twisted parody of a human-

oid creature. It stands about

2 feet tall, but its body is

stooped and deformed, caus-

ing  it  to  drag  the  hooked

claws that serve as its hands

on the ground. Its hide is

covered with shaggy spines

and painful ulcers.

Meenlocks shun the light,

so they excavate lairs deep

beneath remote forests. They

often  create  vast  laby-

rinths of tunnels that con-

nect subterranean caverns,

so that they can travel great dis-

tances without venturing

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:28 PM  Page 147

aboveground. The entrances to meenlock lairs are expertly

camouflaged and sealed with flat stones. If the creatures

discover that one of their entrances has been tampered

with, they track down and capture the intruders to protect

their secrets.

Meenlocks communicate entirely through telepathy.

They can also grunt and click, but these sounds dont con-

stitute a language. Occasionally the creatures act as if

they are talking in order to conceal their telepathy ability

from enemies.

COMBAT

Meenlocks fight if forced to do so, but they are weak com-

batants. They prefer to pick off members of a group one at a

time over a long period. The first attack they usually launch

against their selected target is a slow mental assault (see

Rend Mind, below). Some meenlocks have been known to

stalk and harass their victims in this way for days.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a meenlock can produce

a fear effect in a 30-foot-radius burst, centered on itself. Any

creature within the area that fails a Will save (DC 14)

becomes catatonic from fear for 1d4+4 rounds. During this

time, it rolls into a ball, hugs its knees, or simply stands in

place, shivering and staring. Any creature that makes a

saving throw against the effect cannot be affected again by

that meenlocks fear aura for 24 hours.

Meenlock Transformation (Su): Meenlocks drag their

victims to their lairs and bind them to prevent their escape

before starting the transformation. (A captured creature may

be able to escape from its bonds and fight its way clear, but

the odds are against it, especially since the height of the

mazelike tunnels in a meenlock lair forces a Medium-size

creature to crawl on hands and knees.) Then three or more of

them gather around to touch each helpless humanoid or

monstrous humanoid. After 1d6 hours of such physical con-

tact with the meenlocks, all of the subjects ability scores fall

to 1 (except for any already at 0), reducing him or her to a

drooling, helpless state (no saving throw). A heal or greater

restoration spell at this point restores

the creature to normal. In another

1d6 hours, the transformation is

complete;  the  subject  be-

comes forever a meenlock,

losing  all  of  its  previous

classes and abilities. At this

point, only a wish or miracle

spell can restore the victim.

Paralysis (Ex): Any crea-

ture hit by a meenlocks claw

must  make  a  Fortitude  save

(DC 14) or be paralyzed for 3d6

rounds. The meenlocks use this

time to bind the paralyzed crea-

ture. Once bound, a typical human

can be carried by three meenlocks.

Rend Mind (Su): A meenlock can project thoughts and

suggestions into the mind of a single creature within 300 feet.

These thoughts are usually geared to cause paranoiaimages

of stalking monsters or peering eyes, and the sensation of

being followed, watched, or sized up. The target of this mind-

affecting phantasm must make a successful Will save (DC 14)

or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Once a meenlock uses

this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again.

Dimension Door (Su): Once every 2 rounds, a meenlock

can produce an effect like that of a dimension door spell,

except that the range is only 60 feet and no additional

weight can be transported.

Telepathy (Ex): A meenlock can communicate through

telepathy with any other creature that has a language. This

communication has a range of 300 feet.

One of the largest predators in the world, a megalodon

defers to dragons and little else. Large enough to devour

an entire whale, the megalodon gives even hardened

sailors nightmares.

A megalodon is normally 55 to 65 feet long, and it weighs

between 10 to 60 tons. Rumors of individual megalodons

reaching a length of 80 to 90 feet cannot be confirmed.

COMBAT

Megalodons  attack  anything  they  perceive  to  be

edibleincluding each other. They can leap as high as

40 feet out of the water to snap at low-flying rocs

and small dragons. They bite with their powerful

jaws and can swallow smaller creatures.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a megalodon

hits an opponent that is at least one size

category smaller than itself with a bite

attack, it deals normal damage and at-

tempts to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity (grapple bonus +40). If it gets a

hold, it can try to swallow on the next

round. Alternatively, the megalodon has

the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its jaws to hold the

opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the megalodon is not considered grap-

pled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automat-

ically deals bite damage.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A megalodon can swallow a

single creature that is at least one size category smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grap-

ple bonus +40), provided it already has that opponent

in its mouth (see Improved Grab, above). Once

inside the megalodon, the opponent takes 2d8+10

points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8+4 points of

acid damage per round from the megalodons gullet.

A successful grapple check allows the swal-

lowed creature to climb out of the gullet and

return  to  the  monsters  maw,  where

another successful grapple check is needed

to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed crea-

ture can try to cut its way out with either

claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing

at least 25 points of damage to the gullet (AC 20) in this

way creates an opening large enough to permit escape.

Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action

closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must

cut its own way out. A Gargantuan megalodons gullet can

hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or

smaller opponents.

Keen Scent (Ex): A megalodon notices creatures by

scent within a 180-foot radius and detects blood in the

water at a range of up to one mile.

True terrors of the desert, megapedes constantly hunt the

dunes and sandy plains for food. The desert offers little

refuge to creatures fleeing these enormous predators.

A megapede looks like an enormous cen-

tipede with a long, segmented body and hun-

dreds of pairs of legs. Its tough, bulbous

body is covered with dense orange and

brown bristles. The creatures tremendous

mandibles twitch involuntarily when it

senses prey. A megapede can grow to

more than 100 feet in length.

COMBAT

Megapedes lie in wait just under the

sandy surface of the desert, lunging at

creatures who wander too near. In a

fight,  a  megapede  usually  rends  its

enemy with five vicious claw attacks

per round. It reserves its poison-

ous bite for foes that prove espe-

cially daunting.

Poison  (Ex):  A  megapede

delivers its poison (Fortitude save

DC 44) with each successful bite attack. The initial and sec-

ondary damage is the same (2d6 points of Constitution

damage and 1d4 points of Dexterity drain).

Tremorsense (Ex): A megapede can automatically

sense the location of anything within 120 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

Vermin Traits: A megapede is immune to all mind-affect-

ing effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns and

morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).

The moonbeast is a ferocious, tenacious, and thoroughly

horrifying adversary. Simply seeing one can send strong

adventurers fleeing for their lives, and actually fighting one is

a challenge beyond the capabilities of all but the most power-

ful heroes. Unfortunately, because of the monsters ties to cer-

tain magic devices, some adventurers find themselves inad-

vertently (and often fatally) entangled with a moonbeast.

Since moonbeasts are active only at night and are usually

invisible, eyewitness descriptions of them tend to be hazy. In

reality, a moonbeasts body is a roughly cylindrical mass of

squishy flesh, usually between 20 and 30 feet tall. Its height is

variable; even a single beast sometimes changes in size from

one appearance to the next. A moonbeast has no discernible

head, no front or back, and no top or bottomit is equally

comfortable in any orientation. Its trunk is encircled at each

end by a ring of tentacles. Each ring has a number of tenta-

cles equal to 1 + 1/2 the moonbeasts Hit Dice, rounded

down. (Advanced moonbeasts may have more tentacles, and

thus more tentacle rake attacks, than the standard 18-HD

variety.) These tentacles are lined with barbs and hooks to

catch objects or prey, and they also serve as the moonbeasts

means of locomotion. To move, the creature grabs fixed

objects with its tentacles and drags itself forward. Its body is

covered with a slick, oily substance. Four rings, each consist-

ing of eight flexible, retractable, 1-foot-long eyestalks are

placed above and below each ring of tentacles.

In spite of its immense size, a moonbeast can squeeze its

soft body through an opening as small as a 5-by-5-foot

square. Wherever it passes, it leaves a telltale trail of glis-

tening slime. Moonbeasts are invisible most of the time, but

their horrid smell and the noises they make almost con-

stantly give away their presence to observant creatures.

COMBAT

A moonbeast uses its improved invisibility ability to remain

invisible even in combat. In battle, a moonbeast prefers to

strike, grab, and constrict. It can use as many as seven of its

tentacles against a single target.

Bite (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a moonbeast

can attempt to bite a grabbed opponent (+21 melee), dealing

4d8+5 points of slashing damage on a successful hit. A

moonbeast cannot use its bite attack against a creature it has

not already grabbed.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a moon-

beast can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 3d10+15 points

of bludgeoning damage.

Fear Aura (Su): A moonbeast continually emanates a fear

effect in a 60-foot-radius, centered on itself. Any creature

within the area that fails a Will save (DC 23) is paralyzed

with fear for 2d6 rounds. A new saving throw is required

each time a potentially affected creature comes within range

of the moonbeast.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a moonbeast hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a ten-

tacle rake attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +31). If it gets a hold, it automat-

ically constricts and can attempt to bite the grabbed oppo-

nent in the same round. Thereafter, the moonbeast has the

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:29 PM  Page 150

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use a

single tentacle to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the moonbeast is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals tentacle rake and

constrict damage and allows another bite attempt.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdispel magic, fog cloud, improved

invisibility, lightning bolt; 1/daychain lightning, cloudkill, disin-

tegrate, Evards black tentacles, fireball, ice storm, mirror image,

summon monster VI. Caster level 18th; save DC 14 + spell level.

All-Around Vision (Ex): A moonbeast can see in all

directions at once. Because of this ability, it gains a +4 racial

bonus on Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be flanked.

MOONSTONES

In general, moonbeasts want nothing to do with the world.

They are content to hide in their remote lairs, dreaming of

their native homes (wherever those may be) and venturing out

only occasionally to catch a meal. But each of these creatures is

inseparably linked to a item called a moonstonea rare and

unusual gem that resembles a pearl. Magic items and very

expensive pieces of jewelry occasionally contain moonstones.

Once in a creatures possession, a moonstone slowly and

insidiously works its way into its owners psyche. After 1d6+3

weeks, the owner must succeed at a Will save (DC 30) or

become so attached to the item containing the moonstone

that he or she would refuse to relinquish it under any cir-

cumstances. In the course of

a campaign, this obsession

can go unrecognized for quite

a long time, and the owner may

not be consciously aware of it

until a situation arises that would

require separation from the item.

At some point, however, the

moonbeast that is linked to that

moonstone awakens, leaves its

lair, and begins tracking down

the gem. Its ultimate goal is to

recover  the  moonstone,  slay  the

owner, and then return to its lair.

Oddly, the monster seems to care

nothing  for  the  moonstone

itself;  it  desires  only  that  ab-

solutely no one else possess it.

In  fact,  the  moonbeast  is

quite likely to abandon the

recovered moonstone item

somewhere  during  its

return  trip. The  object

may then lie forgotten

for years before another

unlucky adventurer dis-

covers it anew and begins the

horrid  cycle  all  over  again.

Mooncalves are otherworldly mon-

strosities that, according to rumor,

flew down to earth from the dark side

of  the  moon. When  these  creatures

come to ground, they never venture

farther down than mountaintops, the

tips of tall hills, and other high,

lonely, desolate places.

A mooncalf combines

the body of an immense

cephalopod with the wings

of a bat. It has six short

tentacle -arms that it uses

for  close  combat  and  two

long tentacles that it uses

to attack at a distance be-

cause  of  their  30-foot

reach. The creatures beak-

like mouth is located where

the tentacles meet.

Mooncalves do not speak, but they

can communicate telepathically with

any other creature within a 100-foot radius

that has a language.

COMBAT

Mooncalves prefer to fly high above their targets, striking at

foes from a distance with their spell-like abilities. In melee,

they may grab and crush opponents with their tentacles, or

drag foes into their slavering beaks, or command the ele-

ments to electrocute an enemy.

Bite (Ex): With each successful grapple check, a moon-

calf automatically hits a grabbed opponent with its bite

attack, dealing 2d8+6 points of slashing damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a mooncalf hits an opponent

that is its own size or smaller with a tentacle rake attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +23). If it gets a hold, it automatically hits

with its bite attack on the same round. Thereafter, the

mooncalf has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its tentacle to hold the oppo-

nent  (20  penalty  on  grapple  check,  but  the

mooncalf is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals ten-

tacle rake and bite damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/daycall lightning, con-

trol weather, control winds, dominate animal, greater

magic fang, protection from elements, quench, resist

elements. Caster level 9th; save DC 10 + spell level.

Blindsight (Ex): A mooncalf can ascertain its sur-

roundings by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and

scent, but also by noticing vibration and other envi-

ronmental clues). This ability enables it to dis-

cern objects and creatures within 100 feet. The

mooncalf usually does not need to make Spot or

Listen checks to notice creatures within range of

its blindsight.

Keen Senses (Ex): A mooncalf sees four times

as well a human in low-light conditions and twice

as well in normal light. It also has darkvision (100-

foot range).

Moonrats are indis-

tinguishable

from

normal rats except in

moonlight. Lunar light

has  an  insidious  ef-

fect  on  these  crea-

tures, making them

smarter, stronger, and

more ferocious than

any rat ought to be.

On nights when the

moon shines, moon-

rats pour out of their

darkened  lairs  to

soak up the pallid

rays  and  spread

terror through-

out  human-

oid  settle-

ments.

COMBAT

Moonrats fight just

like normal rats do,

biting  and  tearing

with their teeth. Under

the  influence  of  lunar

light, moonrats also gain the

ability to organize, converse with one

another, formulate complex plans, and

operate complicated devices. Their leaders

remember things done and learned nights or even months

before. When the moons light is at its peak, moonrats are

capable of making and acting on long-range plans that may

require dozens of full-moon nights to complete. These

schemes  are  often  so  subtle  and  involved  that  casual

observers do not connect incidents relating to a long-range

moonrat plan until it is too late to stop it.

Lunar Mind (Ex): A lunar modifier applies to a moon-

rats Strength and Intelligence scores while under the

influence of moonlight. The size of this modifier depends

on the amount of moonlight that reaches the moonrat,

according to the table below. On a clear night, the moon-

light equivalent is the same as the actual phase of the

moon. On a night when clouds or heavy mist obscure the

moon, the moonlight equivalent is one or two steps (DMs

choice) lower on the table than the actual moon phase. On

worlds with multiple moons, either choose only one moon

151

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:29 PM  Page 152

to influence the moonrats, or estimate the moonlight

equivalent of both moons on any given night, using the

new moon and full moon entries as the minimum and

maximum values, respectively, for that world.

For every 2 points of Strength increase, a moonrat gains a +1

bonus on attack and damage rolls. The effect of the Intelli-

gence boost is open to considerable DM interpretation. Use

the Intelligence scores for the following creatures as bench-

marks to determine the moonrats increased intellectual

capacity: Int 3 (minimum for a human), Int 6 (average for a

gargoyle), Int 8 (average for a centaur or gnoll), Int 9 (aver-

age for an orc), Int 10 (average for a goblin). No extra skill

points are gained for a lunar Intelligence boost.

Scent (Ex): A moonrat can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Because of its extraordinary

sense of smell, a moonrat retains its Dexterity bonus to AC

even when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked.

Skills: A moonrat receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide and

Move Silently checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance

checks. It uses its Dexterity modifier for Climb checks.

Few creatures of the deep enjoy reputations for cruelty and

hatred as extensive as that of the morkoth.

The top half of a morkoth resembles a deep-sea fish

with bulging eyes, protruding teeth and a saillike fin

along its back. Its lower body resembles that of an octo-

pus in that it has eight tentacles, but the creature also

sports limbs like the legs of a crustacean. Occasionally a

morkoth has a squidlike beak instead of a mouth, but the

typical version just has a maw like that of a fish.

A morkoth lives a solitary existence, spending most of its

days inside a maze of tunnels constructed of rock or coral at

the bottom of the sea. The outer part of a morkoths lair usually

consists of six tunnels, all spiraling outward, crisscrossing and

interconnecting with one another in a bewildering pattern.

The creatures actual home is at the center of this maze.

A morkoth uses a variety of lures to draw prey into its

clutches. It may dangle treasure as a prize, but its hypnosis

ability is the most powerful lure at its disposal. Once in a

morkoths clutches, a victim doesnt usually survive for long,

since these creatures are interested in capturing only food,

not slaves or captives. A morkoth has little interest in trea-

sure except as a lure for prospective victims.

COMBAT

A morkoths bite is its only offensive weapon. Normally it

uses its hypnosis ability to lure a passing creature through its

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:29 PM  Page 153

maze, then devours its prey alive. The morkoth is a cautious

monster, so it chooses its victims carefully. Typically, it

tries to lure the last in a group of passing creatures into its

tunnel, hoping that the others wont notice that ones

absence until it is too late.

Hypnosis (Su): Any creature passing within 20 feet of

the entrance to a morkoths lair must make a successful

Will saving throw (DC 14) or be hypnotized. A hypno-

tized creature moves unerringly through the maze at its

usual speed. Once in center of the lair, the affected crea-

ture floats quietly in a trance, waiting to be devoured at

the morkoths leisure. A hypnotized creature is helpless

against the morkoths attacks but may attempt a new

saving throw at the same DC each round that the morkoth

attacks it.

A morkoth can hypnotize any number of creatures at one

time. When it is outside its lair, this ability has a range of 20

feet. Hypnosis is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Spell Reflection (Su): The morkoth has a special type of

spell resistance that causes the effect of any spell, spell-like

ability, or magic item that it successfully resists (even those

that affect areas) to bounce off and reflect back at the caster.

If the caster of a spell or the user of a spell-like ability or

magic item fails a caster level check (DC 15), he or she

becomes either the spells target or the point of origin for

the spells effect, as appropriate. If the morkoth is the sub-

ject of a dispel magic spell that is not reflected, its spell

reflection ability is suppressed for 1 round.

MORKOTH TUNNELS

A creature that has successfully resisted the morkoths hyp-

nosis ability might try to rescue a friend who was drawn

into the tunnels. The passages of a morkoths lair are so

narrow that only one Medium-size character can swim

through any 5-foot section at a time. An ambitious DM

could map out the mazelike tunnel system and allow the

characters to try to work their way through it.

Alternatively, the DM could handle penetration of the lair

abstractly as follows: Roll 2d6 to determine the number of

intersections  between  the  tunnels  entrance  and  the

morkoths lair, allowing 10 to 40 feet between intersections.

At each intersection, have the lead character make an Intuit

Direction check (DC 15) to discern the correct path. Each

correct choice brings the group one intersection closer to

the lair; each incorrect choice adds 1d6 intersections to the

route and an equal number of rounds to the time needed to

complete the trip.

It is always possible to navigate any labyrinth by simply

choosing one wall and following wherever it goes. A crea-

ture using this method can eventually find the morkoths

chamber without error, but this route is usually not the

shortest possible path. Roll 1d6+6 for the number of inter-

sections the rescuers must traverse using this method.

Mudmaws wait just below the surface of the water in

swamps, slow rivers, and lakes for potential prey to come

down to the water and drink. In this state, this carnivorous

ambush predator resembles a floating loga fact that many

an unwary adventurer has discovered.

This fearsome swamp predator resembles a crocodile

with a rubbery green tentacle growing from each corner

of its mouth. Its immense maw is filled with needle -

sharp teeth.

Mudmaws are intensely territorial; they have been

known to attack even other mudmaws that intrude on the

areas they claim. If some disaster makes more meat avail-

able than any one of them could eat, they allow others of

their kind to share the bounty and then leave again. If two

mudmaws are encountered, they are peacefully courting

and preparing to mate.

COMBAT

A mudmaw typically tries to grab creatures two or more size

categories smaller than itself with its tentacles and drag

them under the water to drown. Against larger creatures

within 40 feet, it uses slow, then lunges from the water at a

full charge, trampling its prey before grabbing it and return-

ing to the water. A mudmaw doesnt attack if it cant reach its

prey with its tentacles or with a single 40-foot charge. Larger

creatures, or those that prove to be a threat, find pursuing

the monster difficult because it uses soften earth and stone to

turn the edge of the water into a quagmire, then swims away

or uses water walk to cross it.

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex

save (DC 18) for half damage.

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: *A mudmaw receives a +20 bonus on Hide checks

MC

MYCONID

These intelligent, mobile mushroms are among the more

unusual creatures that live deep below ground. Myconids

(also called fungus ones) are gentle, quiet, shy, and thoughtful.

They always view outsiders with distrust because they assume

that all strangers are destructive and violent. To ensure that

they can live in peace, they usually make their homes far from

the more commonly traveled subterranean paths.

A myconid can be from 2 to 12 feet tall. The primary phys-

ical characteristics that distinguish it from other giant toad-

stools are its limbsthe lower half of its trunk is split in

half to form two legs, and two arms depend from just below

its cap. It also has two eyes in the cap, which are perfectly

concealed when it closes them. Its hands seem to have

random numbers of fingers and thumbs. Occasionally, an

individual with more than two arms or legs pops up.

A myconid has a life span of about twenty-four years.

When first spawned, an infant resembles a giant toadstool.

At the age of four, it reaches adulthood and becomes mobile.

Thereafter, its appearance changes very little as it ages.

COMBAT

The fungus ones hide from strangers and fight only as a last

resort. When forced into combat, a myconid releases spores

as a ranged attack or uses its slams in melee.

Spores (Ex): As a standard action, a my-

conid can release a cloud of spores. These

spores come in several different varieties, as

described below. As it enters each new stage of

life (increasing its Hit Dice by 1), a myconid

gains a new variety of spore but does not lose

access to the previous varieties. Each type of spore

can be used a number of times per day equal

to the myconids Hit Dice. A 3-HD

myconid, for example, has the

first three spores (distress, repro-

duction, and rapport), and it can use each

variety three times per day. Spores can be

released either in a 120-foot spread or as a

40-foot ray against a single target, as

noted in the individual spore descriptions.

Distress:  These  spores  alert  all  other

myconids within the area that danger is

near. They are released in a 120-foot spread.

Reproduction: These spores eventu-

ally germinate into new infant my-

conids. They are released as a 120-foot

spread and have no detrimental effects

on nonmyconids.

Rapport: Myconids do not speak, but

these spores enable them to establish

telepathic communication with each other

and with outsiders. A successful Fortitude saving

throw (DC varies; see individual descriptions) negates the

effect, but it is harmless. Rapport lasts for 30 to 60 minutes

with outsiders, but for 8 hours with other myconids. Rapport

spores can be released as either a 120-foot spread or a 40-foot

ray. Regardless of the release area, the communication range

is 120 feet once rapport is established.

Pacification: These spores are released as a 40-foot ray. The

target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC varies; see

individual descriptions) or become passive for 1 minute.

Being passive is similar to being dazed, except that the target

can take partial actions that dont involve attacking. This is a

mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Hallucination: These spores are released as a 40-foot ray.

The target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC varies;

see individual descriptions) or suffer powerful hallucina-

tions that duplicate the effects of a confusion spell for 1 hour.

Animation: Only the myconid sovereign has access to these

spores. When released over a dead body, animation spores

begin a process that covers the corpse with purple fungus.

After 1d4 days, the corpse reanimates as a servant. A servant

has all the characteristics of a zombie of the same size, except

that it retains its previous creature type and it cannot be

turned or otherwise affected as an undead. Over the course of

1d6 weeks, a myconid-animated corpse slowly decays. At the

end of that period it simply disintegrates into dust.

Plant Traits (Ex): A myconid is immune to poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to

critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature also has

low-light vision.

Skills and Feats: A myconid gains skills and feats as

though it were a fey. A myconid of any kind has EHD as

though it were a Tiny plant.

JUNIOR WORKERS

These youngsters are four to eight years old. They assist

their elders with daily chores and serve as a circles first line

Combat

Junior workers are ineffective fighters. They release their

spores at the first sign of danger and hide or retreat if threat-

ened. If forced to fight, they tend to rush a single opponent

as a group. Because a junior worker has a reach of 0 feet, it

must enter an opponents space to make melee attacks.

Spores (Ex): Junior workers have access only to distress

spores.

AVERAGE WORKER

These myconids are eight to twelve years old. They are the

backbone of the community, and they can perform a wide

variety of tasks.

Combat

Average workers are fairly proficient fighters. If alerted to

danger, they usually try to hide and then either attack from

ambush or wait until more capable myconids arrive on the

scene. If such reinforcements are available, the average workers

use the aid another action to assist their superiors in combat.

Spores (Ex): Average workers have access to both distress

quite willing to communicate rather than take aggressive

action. If forced to fight, they try to eliminate the most for-

midable-looking foes first. If more capable myconids join

the battle, elder workers use much the same tactics that

average workers do.

duction, and rapport spores (save DC 12 where applicable).

CIRCLE LEADER

These myconids are twenty

to twenty-four years old. As

the name suggests, they lead

and administer their circles.

Combat

Circle  leaders  join  battle

only if doing so seems nec-

essary to keep their under-

lings  from  being  slaugh-

tered. In combat, they use

their hallucination spores at

the first opportunity. Like

other myconids, they prefer

to avoid melee combat alto-

gether  but  can  use  their

slams if they must.

Spores (Ex): Circle lead-

ers have access to distress, reproduction, rapport, pacification,

and hallucination spores (save DC 15 where applicable).

SOVEREIGN

A myconid sovereign is usually at least twenty-four years

old. It rules over a tribe, advised by the oldest of the circle

leaders. Sovereigns in neighboring areas try to ensure regu-

lar communication between their tribes, and they occasion-

ally meet to discuss issues that affect multiple tribes.

Combat

Sovereigns use the same tactics as circle leaders, except that

they also usually have a few myconid-animated zombies, or

servants, to order into combat. If they join combat at all,

sovereigns tend to advance on the enemy behind a rank of

servants or circle leaders or both.

Spores (Ex): A myconid sovereign has access to distress,

reproduction, rapport, pacification, hallucination, and ani-

mation spores (save DC 15 where applicable).

Potion Making (Su): Though it is not a spellcaster, a

myconid sovereign can create various potions that mimic

cleric and druid spells. It can duplicate the following

effects, each once per day (but only for the purpose of

brewing potions): bulls strength, cure light wounds, cure mod-

erate wounds, cure serious wounds, delay poison, endurance,

endure elements, greater magic fang, invisibility to animals, lesser

restoration, magic fang, negative energy protection, neutralize

poison, protection from elements, remove blindness/deafness,

remove disease, remove paralysis, resist elements. Caster level

6th; save DC 12 + spell level.

MYCONID SOCIETY

A circle of myconids contains equal numbers of 1-HD, 2-

HD, 3-HD, 4-HD, and 5-HD individuals. Each day is rigidly

structured into 8 hours of rest, 8 hours of work (tending

fungus farms), and 8 hours of melding into a transcenden-

tal, hallucinogenic, group-mind state. A melding can be

broken only by myconid distress spores.

Myconids grow fungus for food. A tribe usually main-

tains several fungus farms, which the workers tend with an

almost religious zeal. These creatures know everything

there is to know about fungus, including the optimum con-

ditions for growing each type, and how large a crop a given

area might be expected to produce. Myconids also know

how to make various items from fungus. Most of these,

however, are useful only to myconids.

Myconid tribes consist of several circles living in close

proximity. The circles in a tribe usually arrange themselves

so that the distress spores from neighboring circles can

reach at least one member of another circle in the tribe.

A myconid encountered away from its circle is perform-

ing some mission for its superiors. Such missions usually

consist of keeping a lookout for intruders or scavenging

for refuse to fertilize the fungus beds. Should a wandering

myconid chance upon a humanoid body suitable for anima-

tion, it takes that back to its circle.

The sovereign is the only 6-HD myconid in a tribe. This

creature organizes the circles, watches over the tribe, pro-

tects it from outside influences, animates guardians, and

brews potions. When it dies, the oldest surviving circle

leader in that tribe becomes the new sovereign.

Though needlefolk superficially resemble humanoids,

they are in fact mobile plants. Because they lack roots,

needlefolk must take in water and nutrients through a

structure that resembles a mouth.

Under most circumstances a needlefolks movements are

slow  and  stately. When

faced with danger, how-

ever, it can be nearly as quick and agile as a human.

A needlefolk is a green, hairless bipedal creature whose body

is covered with short, stiff bristles (actually needlelike thorns).

In human terms, its body is quite thin, even emaciated-looking.

Its arms end in hands that sport vicious-looking claws (actu-

ally large, sturdy thorns). The coloration of the small leaves

that cover the monsters body mirrors that of the foliage

around them: green in spring and summer, red and yellow in

autumn, and brown in winter. Needlefolk are deciduous, so

they drop their leaves and become dormant through the cold

season. A dormant needlefolk resembles a tree with two

branches and a faint outline of a face in the bark atop its body.

Needlefolk have no appreciable society or culture. They

live in the forest with no more social organization than trees

or shrubs would have. Their dietary needs are all satisfied by

absorbing light and by eating dirt, decaying leaves, and the

occasional small, dead forest animal. They reproduce by

seeds, which each needlefolk produces in the autumn. The

seed pods are brown and covered with spiny thorns. Because

they fall close to the parent plant, groves of needlefolk tend

to spring up wherever one has chosen to spend a season.

The only thing that excites needlefolk is elvesthey hate

elves passionately. Needlefolk can sense the presence of an

elf within 1,500 feet, and they always move to attack when

one is detected. However, the monsters do possess enough

intelligence and cunning not to commit suicide if they can see

that the odds are strongly against them. If badly outnumbered,

a needlefolk may shadow the target elves until it can

see that enough additional needlefolk have gathered

in the area to shift the balance against the enemies.

Needlefolk speak Sylvan.

COMBAT

Needlefolk are not tremendous fighters at

close range; their preferred weapon

is  the  small  needles  that  cover  their

bodies.  Each  round,  a  needlefolk  can

launch a cluster of needles from its body

(range increment 20 feet, maximum range

200 feet). The precise number of needles

launched doesnt matter; either they all hit a

single target as a cluster and deal 1d12+1

points of damage, or they all miss. If forced into

melee, a needlefolk attacks with its claws.

Groups of needlefolk attack as individuals,

without  any sort of plan or direction. Each one is

cunning enough to determine where its own

attacks might be best targeted, but it cares

nothing for what the rest of its kind do in a fight.

Plant Traits (Ex): Needlefolk are immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. They are not

subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The

creatures also have low-light vision.

Skills: *A needlefolks coloration and needles give

it excellent camouflage in the forest. While there,

it has a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks when station-

ary. This bonus drops to +8 if it moves at up to half-speed.

NEOGI

Neogis are vicious, spiderlike scavengers, raiders, and slavers.

They fit right into any setting where creepy creatures abound.

A neogis eight-legged body is covered with stiff hair,

which makes it look something like a giant wolf spider.

Instead of a spiders head, however, the neogi has a long,

flexible neck that extends upward and backward, then turns

toward the front again in a large S-curve. Atop that sleek

neck sits a small, narrow head, like that of an eel. Its jaws are

lined with tiny, needle-sharp teeth, and small, black eyes are

pushed well forward on the face. An occasional individual

has a narrow beard growing from the front edge of its chin.

The typical neogi dyes its naturally tan fur in one of many

different hues and patterns. Some of these patterns signify

family or rank; others are just for decoration. A neogi usu-

ally wears simple articles of decorative clothing and a belt

or bandoleer with pouches for carrying its valuables.

Neogi lairs are usually laced with pits, chasms, narrow

bridges, and precarious ledges. With their excellent balance

and jumping skills and their ability to dash around enemies,

neogis can move through these hazardous areas more

quickly and safely than most attackers can.

All neogis speak Common and Undercommon, and a

large number of them also speak Terran.

neogis let large numbers of spawn loose on the outskirts of

their community and leave them to fend for themselves.

COMBAT

Combat

The tactics of these monsters vary according to the kind of

neogi involved. No neogi is particularly brave, but all of

them are ruthless. They all share the following abilities.

Poison (Ex): Neogi poison is exceptionally virulent, con-

sidering that the creature itself is so frail. A neogi delivers

its poison (Fortitude save DC 14 for all neogis) with each

successful bite attack. The initial and secondary damage is

the same (1d4 points of Wisdom damage).

Immune  to  Mind-Affecting  Effects: Neogis  are

immune to all mind-affecting effects.

Neogi spawn usually prey on each other, but if they notice

other prey, they charge toward it. In combat, they swarm

over a single creature, biting until it succumbs to their

poison. Thereafter, these little horrors devour their prey.

ADULT NEOGI

Adult neogis are the backbone of the community. They

spend most of their time trying to acquire as much wealth

and power as possible.

Skills: A neogi uses its Dexterity score instead of its

Combat

Strength score for Climb and Jump checks.

SPAWN

These foul and dangerous pests usually are found only in the

vicinity of a great old master. Sometimes, however, adult

Adult neogis are not tremendous fighters, and they know it.

Wherever possible, they have their umber hulk slaves (see

Neogi Society, below) fight for them while they linger

nearby looking for opportunities to use their enslave ability.

Adult neogis often try to make foes more vulnerable to

N

I

159

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:30 PM  Page 160

enslavement by using their poison first, usually delivered

via a crossbow bolt (see below). These creatures are nimble

and difficult to corner.

Poison (Ex): As a standard action, an adult neogi can coat

a weapon with poison from its fangs. The poison remains

active for 1 minute after application and functions as it does

when delivered by means of a bite.

Enslave (Su): Three times a day, a neogi can attempt to en-

slave any one living creature within 30 feet. This ability func-

tions similarly to a dominate monster spell (caster level 16th;

Will save DC 15). An enslaved creature obeys the neogis tele-

pathic commands to the letter. The subject can attempt a new

Will save (DC 15) every 24 hours to break free. Otherwise,

the neogis control is broken only by the death of

either the neogi or the enslaved creature,

or by a remove curse or dispel magic effect,

or if the neogi travels more than 1 mile

from the enslaved creature.

This ability is not needed for neogis

to subdue or control their umber hulk

slaves (see Neogi Society, below).

GREAT OLD MASTER

A neogi that has grown old and

senile is used as an incubator for

infant neogi. In preparation for

this event, adult neogis exude

a fluid and inject it into the

subject. This fluid causes

the subjects body to swell

into a 10-foot-diameter, bloated sack.

Upon becoming a great old master, a neogi

loses its intellect, memories, feats, magical abilities, and most

skills. Its type changes to vermin. When the transformation is

complete, adult neogis lay their eggs in the great old masters

abdomen. Thereafter, the adult neogis provide the great old

master with foodusually alive but immobilizedto sustain

it and nourish the embryos that are devouring their host from

the inside out. Eventually, twenty to forty neogi spawn chew

their way out of the dying master. Most of these are in turn

eaten by their voracious, newborn brothers and sisters, but a

few survive to become the next generation of adult neogis.

MC

affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,

and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).

NEOGI SOCIETY

Theres nothing to admire about neogi culture. These creatures

are vicious murderers, plunderers, and slavers.

Perhaps they kill to eat and enslave what-

ever is left over, or maybe they fill their

chain gangs with slaves and eat whatever

is left over. Either way, their rapacity has

made them the enemies of every thinking

race in the world. Only the mind flayers are

known to have dealings with neogis, usu-

ally over the buying and selling of slaves.

Of  all  the  races  that  neogis  enslave,

umber hulks are their favorites. Every neogi

possesses at least one umber hulk, raised

from birth to a life of slavery and condi-

tioned to accept that situation as the natu-

ral order. These umber hulk slaves take

orders from any neogi without question or

thought. Umber hulk guards keep less com-

pliant slaves (those under the effect of the

neogis enalave ability) under con-

trol  and  also  act  as  soldiers  in

neogi  armies  and  slave  raids.

In  the  neogis  worldview,

ownership is what fuels the uni-

verse. Everything belongs to the

neogis as a wholeif not now, then

it did in the past or it will in the

future. Even a neogi can be owned as a slave by another neogi,

and the slaves can own property and slaves, and those slaves

can own property and other slaves, and so on.

NEOGI CHARACTERS

Many neogis become wizards or sorcerers. A neogis favored

class is sorcerer.

A neogi PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to its

class level + 8. Thus, a 1st-level neogi sorcerer has an ECL

of 9 and is the equivalent of a 9th-level character.

Combat

A great old master can do little in combat except lurch

about, biting and spewing forth spawn.

Spit Spawn (Ex): As a standard action, a great old master

can spit out 2d4 spawn, which can attack the moment they

land. The great old master can place the spawn anywhere

within a range of 100 feet, but no two spawn can land more

than 30 feet apart.

Also, when a great old master takes damage, it can release

2d4 spawn. This version of the spit spawn ability is usable

once per round as a free action.

Nethersight mastiffs are fierce predators native to arctic and

subarctic areas of the Material Plane. These imposing, mus-

cular canines have a taste for ethereal flesh, and they pursue

it zealously, often passing over easier Material Plane prey in

favor of a hunt on the Ethereal Plane.

A nethersight mastiff resembles a tremendous dire wolf

with a black, shaggy coat and huge paws. It has a broad head

with a short, wide muzzle, and its teeth glow with a pearly

blue light. The typical nethersight mastiff is 8 feet in length

and weighs 700 pounds.

Nethersight mastiffs speak Common.

COMBAT

Nethersight mastiffs are bold, aggressive carnivores that

usually hunt in large packs, surrounding their prey to prevent

escape, and then closing in for the kill. Because ethereal

prey is more difficult to catch than Material Plane creatures,

mastiffs always attack quickly and

hold on with their jaws.

Improved Grab (Ex):

If a nethersight mastiff hits

an opponent that is at

least one size category

smaller than itself

with a bite attack, it

deals normal dam-

age and attempts to

start a grapple as a

free action with-

out  provoking

an  attack  of

opportunity

(grapple bonus +18). If it gets a hold on an ethereal creature,

it can attempt a wrenching attack on the next round. Alter-

natively, the nethersight mastiff has the option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the

opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the nether-

sight mastiff is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals bite damage.

Wrenching Attack (Su): A nethersight mastiff can

wrench a grabbed ethereal opponent onto the Material

Plane by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus

+18). A wrenched opponent is then trapped on the Material

Plane unless it has the means to return to the Ethereal Plane.

Ethereal Bite (Su): A nethersight mastiff s teeth have

abilities similar to those of a ghost touch weapon, allowing it

to bite ethereal creatures and negating the usual miss

chance on any attack against an incorporeal creature.

Scent (Ex): A nethersight mastiff can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

True Seeing (Su): This ability functions like the true seeing

spell (caster level 16th), except that it is continuously active.

Skills: *A nethersight mastiff receives a +5 racial bonus

on Spot checks when hunting creatures that are on the

Ethereal Plane.

of a nightmare beast must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or

suffer from horrid, vivid nightmares of being stalked and

killed by monsters, demons, cruel enemies, or whatever else

it fears. The effect is otherwise the same as that of a nightmare

spell (caster level 15th; Will save DC 17), except that a dispel

evil spell cast on a victim does not stun the nightmare beast. A

remove curse or a successful dispel magic negates the effect.

Once a creature has either been affected by this ability or

made a successful save, it cannot be affected by that night-

mare beasts nightmare power again for 24 hours.

Spell-Like Abilities: 2/daychain lightning, cloudkill,

dimension door (1,000 ft. range), disintegrate, dispel magic, fireball,

heat metal, incendiary cloud, lightning bolt, monster summoning V,

wall of fire. Caster level 10th; save DC 10 + spell level.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a nightmare beast can trample opponents at least one

size category smaller than itself by making a running jump

from up to 35 feet away. This attack deals 4d6+13 points of

bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex

save (DC 26) for half damage.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A nightmare beast threat-

ens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1920 with any

of its natural weapons.

Nimblewrights are rapier-wielding constructs that disguise

themselves as living humanoids. They often serve as hired

bodyguards, but many are employed to infiltrate organiza-

tions and secret societies or spy on individuals. Unlike most

constructs, a nimblewright is created with intelligence and

A nightmare beast stands at least 20 feet tall

on its four legs. Each of its digits is tipped with a 3-foot-long

claw. Its jaws are filled with 1-foot-long teeth and flanked by

curved tusks the size of cavalry lances. A nightmare beasts

thick, tough hide is typically dark gray with dark blue, purple,

or brown splotches in between patches of bony material. Its

red eyes, each the size of a mans head, glow in the dark.

The nightmare beast prefers to lair in a remote cave. It

spends most of its time in search of food, and it tends to

hunt in one area until the food supply is exhausted. At that

point, it usually hibernates for up to one year, then awakens

again in a ravenous state.

This monster has no interest in treasure, nor does it often

bring any prey back to its lair, unless the kill is so large that it

cannot be consumed all at once. A nightmare beast often inad-

vertently eats treasures along with their owners, so occasion-

ally items of value turn up in the creatures lair at a later time.

Nightmare beasts speak Abyssal.

Combat

Few monsters aside from dragons are as dangerous as a

nightmare beast. The creature attacks anything that looks

like food with its teeth, tusks, and claws, dealing massive

amounts of damage by means of its augmented critical abil-

ity. And in spite of all that damage potential, its most dan-

gerous weapons are its spell-like abilities.

Nightmares (Su): Perhaps the nightmare beasts most

powerful weapon is the one from which its name is derived.

Every intelligent creature that falls asleep within 10 miles

Construct Traits: A nimblewright is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The crea-

ture is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage,

ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death

from massive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be

healed through repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected.

A nimblewright has darkvision (60-foot range).

Vulnerabilities: A cold effect slows a nimble-

wright for 3 rounds, and a fire effect stuns it for 1 round.

CONSTRUCTION

A nimblewrights body is a hollow humanoid shell made of

flexible precious metal alloys weighing 500 pounds. It costs

35,000 gp to create, which includes 15,000 gp for the body.

Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting)

or Profession (mason) check (DC 16). The creator must be

18th level and able to cast arcane spells. Completing the

ritual drains 1,600 XP from the creator and requires the

geas/quest, haste, limited wish, and polymorph any object spells.

a distinct personality

that allows for intuitive

thinking and responsiveness.

Like a golem, a nimblewright is a

powerful creation that combines awe-

some magic with elemental forces. Its animat-

ing force is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Water. The

process of creating a nimblewright binds the unwilling spirit

to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the creator.

An undisguised nimblewright appears as a nondescript,

steel-colored, mechanical human. When disguised, it wears

clothes and uses spells to hide its true nature. In this way, it

can appear as almost any Medium-size humanoid it wishes

to become.

Nimblewrights speak Common, Elven, and Dwarven.

COMBAT

A nimblewright is an extremely dexterous combatant. In

battle, it brings to bear all of its special fighting skills to deprive

opponents of their weapons before running them through. If a

nimblewright has ample warning of a fight, it enhances its

combat skills with cats grace and haste before joining melee.

The monster fights with two rapiers that are actually parts

of its body. These rapiers are treated as natural weapons.

When not in use, the weapons fold into its forearms. A

nimblewright can fully deploy both rapiers as a free action.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willalter self, cats grace, entropic

shield, feather fall, haste. Caster level 10th; save DC 14 +

spell level.

Tripping Thrust (Ex): A nimblewrights rapier-hand

attacks are powerful enough to push over creatures its own

size or smaller. An opponent who is the target of a successful

critical hit from a nimblewright must make a Reflex save

(DC 19) or be knocked prone as if tripped.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A nimblewright threatens a crit-

ical hit on a natural attack roll of 1220. On a successful criti-

cal hit, its foe is subject to a tripping thrust attack (see above).

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:30 PM  Page 164

Ocean striders live to protect the seas and oceans from those

who sail upon them. These immense fey consider them-

selves defenders of natural waterways, and they dislike

anyone who would plunder the depths for personal gain.

An ocean strider resembles a 20-foot-tall cross between an

elf and a killer whale. Like an orca, it has a mouth full of

pointed teeth, rubbery skin, black and white markings on its

body, and a stubby, fluked tail. Like an elf, it has two arms,

two legs, and a humanoid face. The typical ocean strider

wears mithral scale mail and carries a masterwork falchion

or trident sized for its convenient use.

Because of its water walk ability, an ocean strider can

move at its land speed over the surface of the ocean as

well as the bottom. Its name is derived from the

majestic picture it makes striding over the wave

tops, its weapon raised in defiance.

Once an ocean strider claims a particular

stretch of water, it considers all creatures

not native to those waters, or to the

skies above, to be intruders. It

begins  by  approaching  ships

that enter its realm and order-

ing them to turn back or face

destruction. Usually, an ocean

strider is content to allow ships

crews to reverse course, or even to

negotiate if they wish. Those who

promise to travel carefully, without

dumping their trash overboard or

killing more fish than they can eat,

can sometimes negotiate safe

passage with an ocean strider.

Only when an intruder attempts to

sail  past  without  parleying  or

attacks  does  the  ocean  strider

become  openly  aggressive.  But

woe to those who behave properly

only until they believe themselves

out of danger, because ocean strid-

ers have been known to follow

ships for many miles if they have doubts about a crews com-

mitment to proper use of the oceans gifts. Many a ships cap-

tain has tried to persuade an ocean strider to reveal the limits

of its demesne, but these canny sea-dwellers prefer to not to

let intruders know the true extent of their ability to observe

and punish wrongdoers.

Ocean striders speak Common, Elven, and Aquan.

COMBAT

In battle, an ocean strider first uses its powerful spell-like abil-

ities to confuse, disorient, and soften up opponents. Then it

uses the Spring Attack feat to enter combat with its weapon.

Frightful Presence (Ex): The mere presence of an ocean

strider inspires terror in all creatures within 100 feet of it that

have fewer Hit Dice or levels than it has. Each potentially

affected opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC 32) or

become shakena condition that lasts until the opponent is

out of range. A successful save leaves that opponent immune

to that ocean striders frightful presence for 24 hours.

Ramming (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, an ocean strider can swim at up to quadruple speed

(240 feet) and ram a waterborne target (such as a ship or

another creature). To ram, the ocean strider

must end its movement in the targets space.

This attack deals 2d8+6 points of damage. If the

target is a creature, it can attempt either an attack of

opportunity or a Reflex save (DC 29) for half damage.

Upon ramming a ship, the ocean strider can make a

Strength check to breach its hull, which causes the ship

to sink in 1d10 minutes. The break DC varies

with the type of vessel rammed, as follows:

rowboat DC 20, keelboat DC 23, sailing

ship or longship DC 25, warship DC 27,

or galley DC 30. (See Chapter 5 of the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for information

about ships.) Regardless of the check result,

every creature aboard must attempt a

Reflex saving throw (DC 15). Success

means the creature takes 1d10 points of

damage from being thrown about by

the impact; failure means the crea-

ture is hurled overboard.

Spell-Like Abilities: 6/day

control  water,  fog  cloud,  ice

storm, obscuring mist; 5/day

acid fog, cone of cold, elemental swarm

(water only), horrid wilting, summon

natures ally IX (water or aquatic

creatures only). Caster level 20th;

save DC 17 + spell level.

Water Breathing (Ex): An

ocean strider has gills as well as

lungs, so it can breathe water as

well as it can air.

Water Walk (Su): An ocean

strider continuously produces an effect like

that of a water walk spell (caster level 20th).

OCEAN STRIDER CHARACTERS

An ocean striders preferred class is ranger, though many

choose to become clerics. Ocean strider clerics worship

Deep Sashelas and may choose any two of the following

domains: Chaos, Protection, and Water. Claims by sea cap-

tains that they have encountered shadowdancer ocean strid-

ers remain unconfirmed.

An ocean strider PCs effective character level (ECL) is

equal to its class level + 35. Thus, a 1st-level ocean strider

ranger has an ECL of 36 and is the equivalent of a 36th-

level character.

ORCWORT

An orcwort is a walking, blood-

thirsty terror that prefers to

make  its  home  on  the

fringe of a populated area.

This giant plant wanders

by night until it finds an

appropriate spot to settle,

then  sinks  some  of  its

roots  into  the  ground,

making it seem that an

immense tree has grown

up in the spot overnight.

Over the course of the next

week, the orcwort produces

five  to  twenty  pods  that,

when mature, break open to

release mobile fruits called

wortlings. The parent plant

then  sends  out  its  wort-

lings  in  hunting  parties  to

bring  back  warm-blooded

sustenanceusually live-

stock and humanoids.

An orcwort is capable of

devouring the entire pop-

ulation of a small village

in a single feeding. Once

it has stripped an area of

warm-blooded animal life, it moves on in search

of other population centers.

COMBAT

Both the orcwort and its wortlings

are  effective  combatants.  They

share the following qualities.

Partial Immunity to Pierc-

ing (Ex): Piercing weapons deal

only half damage to orcworts

and wortlings. The minimum

damage  per  hit  with  such  a

weapon is 1 point.

Plant Traits (Ex): An orcwort

or wortling is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and poly-

morphing. It is not subject to criti-

cal hits or mind-affecting effects.

Woodsense (Ex): An orcwort or

wortling can automatically sense the

location of anything within 60 feet

that is in contact with vegetation,

even objects or creatures that are

not in contact with the same

vegetation as itself.

Skills and Feats: Orcworts

and wortlings gain skills and

feats as though they were fey.

WORTLING

ORCWORT

Wortlings are the mature fruits of the orcwort plant. When

one of the orcworts pods ripens, it falls to the ground and

breaks open to release a wortling.

When first hatched, a wortling resembles a small,

wrinkled, purple orc. Its body seems portly, and its arms

and legs are somewhat lumpy compared with those of a

real humanoid. Although its face resembles that of a

humanoid, a wortling is blind and cannot speak, hear, or

smellits apparent sensory organs are merely blobs of

plant tissue with no actual function.

A hungry orcwort dispatches up to twenty of its ripe

wortlings at a time to hunt food and bring it back. The

wortlings navigate terrain using their woodsense. When on

the prowl, wortlings seek out Medium-size or smaller prey

because such creatures are easier to transport back to the

parent plant than larger creatures.

The average life span of a wortling is 1d4+1 days. If any

wortlings are left alive when the parent plant is ready to

move on, the orcwort commands them to arrange them-

selves well apart from each other at the extreme range of

its telepathy and root themselves. If left undisturbed for

one year, each of these wortlings grows into a new orc-

wort, which pulls up its roots and begins looking for food.

During its maturation period, a rooted wortling is immo-

bile and helpless.

Combat

Wortlings use very simple tacticsoverwhelm, subdue,

and return with the food. In melee, they prefer to gang up

on one foe rather than attack separate enemies. They fight

with a great sense of urgency, and when they do manage to

bring down a foe, a few of them immediately carry off their

prize to feed the orcwort, leaving any remaining wortlings

to continue the hunt. They never willingly enter areas with-

out natural vegetation because they are effectively blind in

such places.

Poison (Ex): A wortling delivers its poison (Fortitude

save DC 11) with each successful claw attack. The initial

damage is sleep for 1 minute, and the secondary damage is

sleep for 1d10 minutes. Both of these sleep effects work only

against living creatures but otherwise function as the spell

of the same name.

Swarming (Ex): Wortlings can swarm over and around

each other with ease, so up to three of them can occupy the

same 5-foot-by-5-foot space. They are likewise adept at

attacking as a group; for every wortling that is grappling a

foe (grapple bonus +0), every wortling gets a +1 competence

bonus on attack rolls against that foe.

Plantmind (Ex): All wortlings within fifteen miles of

their orcwort parent are in constant communication. If

one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a

particular group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No

wortling in such a group is considered flanked unless they

all are.

An orcwort looks like a gigantic, woody pitcher plant

draped in thick creeper vines. It is crowned with a canopy

of bramblelike branches and green, bushy foliage. Dor-

mant wortling pods hang from the orcworts branches,

resembling round, oversized prunes.

Combat

In combat, an orcwort reaches out with its vines to entwine

nearby prey. It then uses other tendrils to pick out choice

victims one at a time and drop them into its open maw. An

orcwort recalls any wortling raiding parties it has sent out

whenever it is under attack.

Entangling Roots (Ex): As a free action, an orcwort can

twist its roots around all creatures within 15 feet of it, hold-

ing them fast. This effect otherwise functions like an entan-

gle spell (caster level 10th; save DC 24).

Improved Grab (Ex): If an orcwort hits a Gargantuan or

smaller opponent with a slam attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +54). If it

gets a hold, it can transfer the opponent to its maw in the

next round. Alternatively, the orcwort has the option to

conduct the grapple normally, or simply use one tendril to

hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the

orcwort is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals slam damage.

Paralysis (Ex): An orcwort secretes digestive juices that

can paralyze creatures in contact with it. Any creature swal-

lowed by an orcwort must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC

35) or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds.

Swallow Whole (Ex): An orcwort can swallow a Huge

or smaller creature by making a successful grapple check

(grapple bonus +54), provided it already has that opponent

in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the

orcworts pitcher, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of acid

damage per round and is subject to the paralyzing effect of

its digestive juices (see Paralysis, above). A successful grap-

ple check allows a swallowed creature to climb out of the

pitcher (assuming it is not paralyzed) and return to the orc-

worts maw, where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can

try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or

slashing weapon. Dealing at least 20 points of damage to

the pitcher (AC 18) in this way creates an opening large

enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature

exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swal-

lowed opponent must cut its own way out. The orcworts

pitcher can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128

Small or smaller creatures.

Telepathy (Su): An orcwort can communicate telepathi-

cally with any of its wortlings within fifteen miles.

Ormyrrs  are  intelli-

gent, seminomadic

creatures that live

in small settlements

along muddy river

banks  and  lake

shores. For the

most part, they

keep  to  themselves,

except while hunting or feeding their passion for acquiring

magic items.

An ormyrr has an enormous, grublike body that can meas-

ure as much as 25 feet long. At the top of the body is a froglike

head that appears impossibly large and heavy. Below the head,

four short but powerful arms extend out from the body. Thick,

bony ridges above the eyes and a wide mouth filled with ser-

rated teeth complete the beasts monstrous appearance.

Hunting parties of ormyrrs can roam as far as 40 miles

from their homes. They travel by river as much as possible

during their forays, then come ashore for the actual hunt.

Ormyrrs have no magical ability at all, but magic fasci-

nates them; in fact, their goal as a race is to develop a unique

ormyrr magic. They covet magic and magic items, and the

chance to take possession of a magic item, scroll, or book is

the one thing that can make one of these normally reason-

able creatures lie, steal, or attack without provocation.

Needless to say, this tendency can draw them into conflict

with adventurers. Since they are innately lawful, however,

those seeking to recover magic items that ormyrrs have

stolen can sometimes get farther by appealing to the crea-

tures sense of right and wrong than by attacking, hurling

accusations, or trying to steal the items back.

Ormyrrs speak Common.

COMBAT

Most often, ormyrrs fight with weapons rather than with

their claws. The typical ormyrr possesses at least one

magic weapon, usually with a +1 or +2 enhancement

bonus, and fights with more than one weapon at once to

take advantage of its enhanced multiweapon fighting spe-

cial quality.

A preferred tactic among ormyrrs is to hide along a river

bank and ambush enemies with a hail of hurled stones, sling

stones, axes, and nets. If the situation looks

promising, the ormyrrs close in with

drawn  weapons.  If  not,  they

simply slip into the river and

swim away from danger.

Constrict (Ex): With a suc-

cessful grapple check, an ormyrr

can crush a grabbed opponent,

dealing  1d8+12

points of bludg-

eoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex):

If an ormyrr hits an opponent

that is at least one size category

smaller than itself with two claw

attacks, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple

as a free action without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus

+23). If it gets a hold, it also constricts on the same round.

Thereafter, the ormyrr has the option to conduct the grap-

ple normally, or simply use its claws to hold the opponent

(20 penalty on grapple check, but the ormyrr is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check

it makes during successive rounds automatically deals

damage for two claw attacks.

Enhanced Multiweapon Fighting (Ex): This ability

lessens the penalty for off-hand weapon use by 2 for both

primary and off hands. Thus, when combined with the

creatures Multidexterity and Multiweapon Fighting feats,

it allows the use of one or more light off-hand weapons with

no penalty on the attack rolls.

Weapon Use (Ex): An ormyrr is proficient with all

simple and martial weapons.

Phase wasps are 18-inch-long insects that can see and attack

invisible and ethereal creatures (in the latter case, without cross-

ing the planar boundary). They rarely attack creatures three or

more size categories larger than themselves unless provoked.

Like ordinary wasps, these creatures live in large colonies.

Each colony builds a nest about 10 feet in diameter

out of paper that its members

have made from chewed-up wood or paper and their own

saliva. Because such a nest requires a tremendous amount of

paper, many wizards and libraries offer bounties for the

destruction of nearby phase wasp nests.

Though they do not speak, phase wasps utilize an elabo-

rate signaling system to communicate within their hives.

Their signal language seems to be based on a system of

subtle smells, body postures, and flight patterns.

COMBAT

Normally, phase wasps attack only to defend themselves or

their nests. They converge on intruders in swarms, fire

their magic missiles, and then swoop in to sting until they

can use their missiles again.

Magic Missile (Sp): A phase wasp can produce an effect

that functions like a magic missile spell (caster level 3rd).

Once it has used this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before

it can do so again.

See Invisibility (Sp): A phase wasp produces an effect like

that of a see invisibility spell (caster level 3rd), except that is

always active.

The phoenix, or firebird, is a creature of tremendous power

and potent omen. Many intelligent races look upon it as a

god, or at least as a gods messenger.

Physically, a phoenix resembles an immense bird of prey.

It measures between 10 and 15 feet from beak to tail, but its

wingspan can be as wide as 40 feet. By far its most striking

feature, however, is its plumage. All of its feathers are the

colors of fireprimarily scarlet, crimson, and orange. In

flight or at rest, a phoenix looks like a bird made of flame.

When a phoenix reaches the end of its natural life, or

when it finds itself in an extreme, life-threatening situation,

it immolates itself with intense fire. After its death,

a new phoenix arises from the ashes.

Because of its traditional associ-

ation with renewal and rebirth,

most  cultures  ascribe  some

symbolic  meaning  to  the

sighting of a phoenix. Some

consider it a positive omen

a sign of the gods favor and a

promise of renewed life and

increased  prosperity  in

the coming years. Others

(usually  those  with  a

darker outlook on life) see

the firebird as a sign of

approaching death and

destructionan ordeal

that only the strongest

will survive. Whatever

meaning a particular cul-

ture associates with this crea-

ture, theres no doubt that it is

on the side of good. A phoenix doesnt

involve itself in worldly affairs or join

in mundane conflicts, but neither does

it shy away from attacking evil.

COMBAT

In battle, a phoenix usually begins by shrieking to soften up

its enemies before joining melee with its claws and beak. It

has no fear of fighting to the death, since its immolation

ability ensures its later rebirth.

Shriek (Ex): Once per minute, a phoenix can utter a war

shriek that forces every opponent within 30 feet to succeed

at a Will save (DC 22) or be slowed (as the slow spell) for 1

round. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.

Spell-Like Abilities: Always activedetect evil, detect magic,

protection from evil; at willblindness, blink, blur, color spray, cure

light wounds, dancing lights, find the path, find traps, fire seeds (using

drops of its own blood rather than holly berries as a material

component; no acorn grenades), heal, invisibility, misdirection,

of fire. Caster level 20th; save DC 15 + spell level.

After 10 rounds of ritual and preparationdismissal, dispel

evil, dispel magic. Caster level 40th; save DC 15 + spell level.

Defensive Aura (Sp): A phoenix has a +5 deflection bonus

to Armor Class. This ability is always in effect.

Immolation (Su): When it knows that death is near, a

phoenix immolates itself as a full-round action. This pro-

duces a cloud of flame in a 20-foot-high, 15-foot-radius

spread. Each creature in the area takes 40d6 points of

damage (Reflex DC 22 half ). Half of this damage is fire;

the rest results directly from divine power and is therefore

not subject to reduction by protection from elements (fire), fire

shield (chill shield), or similar

magic. This action kills the

original phoenix and pro-

duces a new one, fully

grown and unharmed,

from the ashes. This new

bird arrives at the end of

the round.

Planar Travel (Su): A

phoenix can enter and

exit the Astral Plane or

the Ethereal Plane at will

and  navigate  through

these planes without er-

ror or risk.

Spell-Like Metamagic

(Ex): A phoenix can apply

any one of its metamagic

feats (Empower Spell, En-

large Spell, Extend Spell,

Heighten Spell, Maximize

Spell) to a spell-like ability

by using that ability as a full-

round action.

Telepathy (Su): A phoenix can

communicate telepathically with any

nonavian creature within 60 feet. It can

also speak normally with any avians.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A phoenix retains its Dexterity

bonus  to  AC  even  when  flat-footed,  and  it  cannot  be

flanked. Even if it fails a Spot check, it still knows that some-

thing is in the area; it merely lacks any details as to its exact

location or description.

PLANETOUCHED

Planetouched is a term used to describe a creature that can

trace its bloodline back to an outsider. The effects of an out-

siders bloodline can manifest in its descendants for many

generations. Though not as dramatically altered as half-

fiends or half-celestials, the planetouched still have some

special qualities because of their unusual ancestors.

The planetouched discussed here are exceedingly rare.

Chaonds are humans with slaadi blood, while zenythris are

descended from mysterious beings of law whose identity is

only guessed at.

169

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:31 PM  Page 170

There are no typical chaonds and zenythris. These crea-

tures neither form their own cultures nor belong to homog-

enous societies. Instead, they adopt the standards and the

beliefs of the cultures they are born into.

CHAOND

Infused with primal forces, cha-

onds are living embodiments of the

force  of  chaos  in  the  universe.

Though their slaadi ancestry may be

several generations removed, these

beings still fit only marginally into civi-

lized societies.

A chaond resembles a

human but seems much

cruder,  both  in  form

and in temperament. Its

brutish appearance is

usually marked by wild,

unkempt hair, blocky

facial  features,  and  a

stocky torso and limbs.

Its true nonhuman nature is given away by the slow, shift-

ing colors of its eyes, hair, or skin. The typical chaond has a

gravelly voice that tends to come out like a croak

when the creature is excited.

Most chaonds are chaotically aligned, which

has earned them a reputation as wily and whimsi-

cal beings. They often exist on the fringe of a

society because they refuse to succumb to the

rule of law. Chaonds wishing to explore their

primal sides usually take on professions that

involve adventuring in the natural wilder-

ness or harnessing elemental forces.

Chaonds speak Common.

Combat

Considering their heritage, it should be no

surprise that most chaonds fight dirty, with

little regard for rules or fairness. They often

conceal small, poisoned weapons on

their persons. But while chaonds

enjoy a good brawl, there are

few issues that they con-

sider worthy of a fight to

the death.

ZENYTHRI

Zenythris are often viewed as contemplative beings who

strive for personal perfection in every action they take. Many

feel the need to impose their own brand of order on the

world about them. Some even travel to lawless regions for

the express purpose of creating order there. From a zenythris

viewpoint, such exercises serve to illuminate the underlying

purpose and structure that lies dormant in all things.

A zenythri appears as a perfect version of a human. Its

skin is flawlessly smooth, and its muscles are well defined

and taut. Even its hair falls effortlessly into place around its

handsomely chiseled face. A zenythri could almost blend

unnoticed among humans were it not for the slightly blue

or purple tint of its skin and hair.

Most zenythris feel compelled to contribute to the soci-

eties in which they dwell. As such, they actively work

toward positions of responsibility, which often bring with

them significant social status. Zenythris are natural leaders

and consummate strategists, and they gladly accept leader-

ship roles. These planetouched seem to have no interest in

good or evil so long as they accomplish their goals. Such

a disposition lends itself as readily to tyrannical

methods as benign ones.

Zenythris  speak  Common.  A  zenythri  that

acquires additional languages speaks them perfectly,

without any sort of accent.

Combat

Zenythris fight instinctively, sizing up oppo-

nents for strengths and weaknesses during

melee. They relish in executing difficult

combat moves and work hard to develop

complex fighting styles.

True Strike (Sp): Once per day, a zenythri can

use true strike (caster level 1st or the zenythris

character level, whichever is higher).

Skills: A zenythri receives a +2 racial

bonus on Balance and Intuit Direc-

tion checks.

Zenythri Characters

A zenythris favored class is monk.

A zenythri PCs effective char-

acter level (ECL) is equal to its

PSURLON

Psurlons are wormlike creatures with formidable mental

powers. The resemblance between psurlons and worms is

likely more than coincidence; perhaps the monsters were

magically created from earthworms, or an earthworm is a

radically degenerate form of psurlon.

A psurlon has a long, tubular, pinkish body marked with

faint rings, just like an earthworms. It also has two arms and

two legs, each of which also looks like a giant earthworm. The

psurlons head is little more than a blunt end to its tubular

body. Its only facial feature is a circular maw filled with gnash-

ing teeth that serves as a mouth. It has visual organs (for dark-

vision) spaced evenly around the head. The typical psurlon

wears a decorative or utilitarian belt fitted with straps and

hooks to carry items, but no other clothing or armor.

Psurlons often choose to live solitary lives, or to live only

with their mates. Sometimes, however, psurlons form small

communities called clusters for the purpose of claiming ter-

ritory or working toward a common cause.

Psurlons speak Undercommon.

COMBAT

Psurlons never use melee weapons. They can fight with

their bare claws and teeth, but this does not make them

very formidable opponents in phys-

ical combat. The real danger a

psurlon presents is in its ability

to cloud, numb, and control the

minds of others.

Blindsight (Ex): A psurlon

can ascertain its surroundings by

sensing sound, scent, heat, and vibra-

tion. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 60 feet. The

psurlon usually does not need to make

Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures

within range of its blindsight.

Immunities (Ex): Psurlons are immune to

sleep, charm, and hold effects.

Telepathy (Su): A psurlon can communicate

telepathically with any creature within 250 feet

that has a language.

AVERAGE PSURLON

Average psurlons perform all day-to-

day tasks related to keep-

ing a cluster running

smoothly. Of all psur-

lons, it is these that most

often strike out to live

on their own.

Also called sword spirits, rage-

winds are the embodied wrath

of dead warriors who perished

in useless battles. They are usu-

ally found in the most volatile

and violent of the Outer Planes,

but a few sometimes escape to

wander the Material Plane as

well. On rare occasions, ragewinds

Though longswords are specified in the statistics given

above, a ragewind may incorporate and utilize any sort of

melee weapon, as long as each is at least one size category

smaller than the monster. Some of these weapons may have

magical properties, at the DMs option. No matter how

many weapons are incorporated into the ragewinds form, it

can bring no more than six of them to bear at a time.

A ragewind attacks with the weapons that are held aloft

in its swirling winds. Each of these weapons functions

independently, as though wielded by a different individ-

ual. The ragewind delights in disarming its opponents

and using their own weapons against them. If over-

matched, it uses its invisibility to escape.

Blade Fury (Su): Three times per day, a ragewind can

expand itself outward into a 15-foot-radius spread, filling

that entire space with its whirling weapons. This attack

deals 20d6 points of slashing damage to every

creature within that area (Reflex DC

26  half ).  Immediately  after  this

attack, the ragewind reverts to its

normal size and shape. Once it has

used its blade fury attack, it must

wait 1d4+1 rounds before it can do

so again. A ragewind cannot bene-

fit from both blade fury and

whirlwind at the same time.

Whirlwind (Su): A rage-

wind can intensify the swirling

air that composes its usual form

to the strength of a whirlwind as

a free action. When it does so,

it transforms into a whirling

mass of air and weapons 5 feet

wide and 20 feet high. Each crea-

ture that is at least two size cate-

gories  smaller  than  the  rage-

wind  and  in  contact  with  it

must succeed at a Reflex save (DC

26) or take 3d6 points of damage.

Whether or not this save is suc-

cessful,  an  affected  creature

must immediately make a second

Reflex save against the same DC. Failure

indicates that the affected creature is picked up by

the winds and takes an additional 1d8

points of damage that round and each

round thereafter that it remains sus-

pended in the winds. (The ragewind may

also direct weapon attacks at creatures

caught within its whirlwind if desired,

though it gains no special bonuses for

doing so.) A flying creature may leave the

whirlwind with a successful Reflex save,

though  it  still  takes  damage  for  the

round in which it does so.

A ragewind may also cause its whirl-

wind to touch the ground, kicking up a

swirling cloud of debris with a 10-foot

radius. This cloud obscures all vision,

including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.

Creatures at a distance of 5 feet have

one-half concealment, and those

farther away have total conceal-

ment. A creature caught in this

dust  cloud  must  succeed  at  a

Concentration check (DC 20) to cast a spell.

Invisibility (Su): At will, a ragewind can suppress its

whirlwind to become invisible. This ability otherwise func-

tions like the invisibility spell (caster level 20th).

See Invisibility (Su): This ability functions like the see invis-

ibility spell (caster level 20th), except that it is always active.

Superior Multiweapon Fighting (Ex): A ragewind fights

with six weapons at once. Because the creature is an amal-

gam of many dead warriors, a separate intelligence controls

each weapon. Thus, the ragewind has no penalty on attack

rolls for attacking with multiple weapons, and the number

of attacks and the damage bonus for each weapon are calcu-

lated as though the weapon were held in a primary hand.

Undead Traits: A ragewind is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A rage-

wind cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is

willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Weapon Proficiency: A ragewind is proficient with all

simple and martial weapons.

RAGGAMOFFYN

Raggamoffyns are mysterious constructs composed of ani-

mated scraps and bits of cloth, metal, or other refuse from

civilized societiesparticularly those where magic is

common. Raggamoffyns tend to cluster together, operating

as much in secret as possible, taking control of selected

hosts to further their agendas.

Unlike other constructs, a raggamoffyn is not the result

of any deliberate act of creation. Rather, it is formed when

leftover magical energy interacts

with inanimate objects. The exact

process is not well understood, but

it  always  results  in  one  of  four

types of raggamoffyn.

A raggamoffyn appears as an ani-

mated, ragtag assortment of odds

and ends, roughly humanoid in shape.

The four types differ both in the kinds of

refuse that form their bodies and the powers

they possess.

COMBAT

Above all, a raggamoffyn seeks to acquire a host that it can

dominate. The creatures refrain from harming potential hosts

as long as possible, so they work quickly by rushing in with

touch attacks. A foe that is successfully dominated is

wrapped by the raggamoffyn, which then uses its host to

defend  itself  and  other  raggamoffyns.  Raggamoffyns

unleash their full melee attack capabilities against foes that

are resistant to their mind controlling powers, fearing right-

fully that an escaped foe will warn others of the ragga-

moffyns existence.

Control Host (Su): A raggamoffyn can attempt to take

control of any creature it has wrapped (see below). This abil-

ity functions like the dominate monster spell (caster level

18th; save DC varies; see individual descriptions). As a free

action, the monster may relinquish control over its host by

physically and mentally disengaging itself from the latters

body. Use the captured one template (see the appendix) for a

creature under the control of a raggamoffyn.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a raggamoffyn hits an opponent

that is its own size or smaller with a slam attack, it deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus varies; see

individual descriptions). If it gets a hold, it can attempt to wrap

(see below) in the next round. Alternatively, the raggamoffyn

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

its appendage to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the raggamoffyn is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals slam damage.

Wrap (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a raggamoffyn

can wrap itself around any foe it has already grabbed with

another successful grapple check. The monster forms a

skintight layer around the wrapped creature, covering it from

head to toe but leaving enough space for the creature to

breathe through its mouth and nose. Attacks on such a target

deal half their damage to the monster and half to the wrapped

creature. An affected creature can extract itself by making a

successful grapple check. Once it has wrapped a creature, the

raggamoffyn can attempt to control it on its next action.

Construct Traits: A raggamoffyn is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The creature

is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A raggamoffyn has

darkvision (60-foot range).

TATTERDEMANIMAL

Tatterdemanimals are the least powerful of the ragga-

moffyns. They often lurk around rubbish mounds and other

places where refuse is heaped.

A tatterdemanimal appears as a swirling heap of small,

dirty, tattered rags and other scraps of cloth.

Combat

Tatterdemanimals often take animals as hosts because they

are the easier to capture.

Control Host (Su): The tatterdemanimals control host

ability has a Will save DC of 12.

takes no damage from bludgeoning weapons.

COMMON

Scholars theorize that common raggamoffyns form from

enchanted gloves, robes, hats, and other magic clothing that

was lost or discarded by its owners. They are usually found

near cemeteries and places where magical battles have

recently transpired.

A common raggamoffyn looks like a suit of mismatched

clothing with no wearer. The clothing appears to be in good

repair, and it would probably still be usable if it could be sep-

arated from the construct.

Combat

A common raggamoffyn directs its host creature in combat.

It suffocates the host when it has either lost control over the

creature or has no further use for it.

Control Host (Su): The common raggamoffyns control

host ability has a Will save DC of 14.

Guttersnipes are content to lie in wait for suitable hosts.

They save their glitterdust ability to dazzle foes when they

need to escape.

Control Host (Su): The guttersnipes control host ability

has a Will save DC of 17.

Glitterdust (Sp): Once per day, a guttersnipe can use glitter-

dust (caster level 5th; save DC 15).

Improved Grab (Ex): A guttersnipes grapple bonus is +7.

Immunities (Ex): Guttersnipes are immune to spell

effects that produce light or darkness.

SHRAPNYL

Shrapnyls are the only raggamoffyns made entirely of metal.

They lurk near battlegrounds as well as forges.

A shrapnyl consists of bits of metal in every size. Its

appearance can vary greatlyone might consist of swords,

shields, and cooking gear, while another could contain a

helm, coins, chains, and keys.

Improved Grab (Ex): A common raggamoffyns grapple

COMBAT

bonus is +4.

Suffocate (Ex): A common raggamoffyn can asphyxiate a

wrapped creature by drawing the air from its lungs. This

attack automatically deals 1d4 points of damage per round.

GUTTERSNIPE

Guttersnipes are most prevalent around settlements of

dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. They form from worn-out

and discarded adventuring and construction gear.

A guttersnipe appears as a whirling mound of frayed rope,

worn leather pieces, strings, belts, and swatches of cloth.

Within this mass of material is a core made of small gems,

bits of glass, and glitter.

Shrapnyls are the most aggressive of the raggamoffyns. They

do not hesitate to use their cloud of steel attack when faced

with an overwhelming situation.

Cloud of Steel (Ex): Once per day, a shrapnyl can

explode into a deadly cloud of flying, sharp debris. Every

creature within a 10-foot spread centered on the shrapnyl

takes 4d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 16 half ). This attack

instantly frees a creature wrapped by the shrapnyl from its

control, and the wrapped creature takes no damage from

that cloud of steel attack.

Control Host (Su): A shrapnyls control host ability has a

Will save DC of 19.

Improved Grab (Ex): A shrapnyls grapple bonus is +17.

Vulnerability to Shatter: The shatter spell deals 3d6 points

of damage to a shrapnyl.

Rampagers (sometimes called

so-ut, their goblin name) are

vicious, nocturnal predators

that live only to destroy and

kill. Oddly, their armor, weap-

onry, and aggressiveness go far

beyond the levels necessary to

bring down food. In fact, ram-

pagers enjoy killing, and they

usually kill far more than they

can eat. In fact, as long as prey

is available, a rampager doesnt

even stop killing long enough

to feed.

A  rampager  stands  taller

than a man (8 to 10 feet high). Its

body, a solid knot of muscle, is cov-

ered with an extremely tough, scaly

hide. The monster has no head as such;

its face juts out from the forward

edge of its body. Two bone-white

eyes peer out from the scaly mass

above the gaping, fang-filled mouth. From behind the face

jut two muscular arms, each of which ends in two long,

hooked claws. The four thick, stumplike legs are similar to

those of an elephant, and a triangular, muscular tail drags

behind the monster. A rampager has very poor hearing,

but its scent ability makes up for that lack.

Something about metal drives a rampager mad. It attacks

creatures wearing metal armor before anyone or anything

else. Once all such targets are dead, it turns its attention to

those wielding metal weapons. After all the metal nearby

is demolished, the rampager starts on the largest struc-

tures in the area, ignoring even creatures that are attack-

ing it in favor of demolishing a building (though it does

defend itself once it has lost more than half of its original

hit points). Only after all nearby built-up structures have

been leveled does it finally turn against unarmored heroes

or townspeople.

Acid (Ex): The acid that coats a rampagers claws not

only deals extra damage on successful attacks, it also dis-

solves an opponents armor and clothing, making those

items useless in 1 round unless the wearer succeeds at a

Reflex save (DC 22). Success indicates that the affected

equipment can be saved by washing it within 1 minute.

Washing requires a full-round action

and at least 1 pint of water.

Armor Damage (Ex): A ram-

pagers teeth can catch and tear

an opponents armor. If the oppo-

nent has both armor and a shield,

roll 1d6: A roll of 14 affects the

armor and a roll of 56 affects

the shield. Make a grapple check

(grapple bonus +19) whenever

the  rampager  hits  with  a  bite

attack, adding to the opponents

roll any bonus for the armor or

shield because of magic. If the

rampager  wins,  the  affected

armor  or  shield  is  torn  away

and ruined.

Fear Aura (Ex): Each crea-

ture that is the target of a ram-

pagers attack or is within 30 feet

of such a target must succeed at a

Will  saving  throw  (DC  17)  or

become shaken. A shaken creature

that is still within 30 feet of the

rampager on its next turn must

make a second Will saving throw

(DC 17) to avoid becoming fright-

ened (same penalties as shaken;

must flee until beyond the 30-foot

radius of the effect).

Poison (Ex): A rampagers acidic saliva acts as a weak

poison (Fortitude DC 22) with each successful bite attack.

The initial damage is 1 point of Strength damage, and the

secondary damage is 1d4 points of Strength damage.

Scent (Ex): A rampager can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

The reason stealer is a relentless, subterranean killer

that murders other creatures to steal their intelli-

gence. Reason stealers live below ground but

make their way to the surface to hunt.

In its normal form, a reason stealer is a

4-foot-diameter puddle of grainy, brown-

ish-yellow slime. If it has recently fed

upon a creature possessing some

form of intelligence, it can roughly

mimic its victims shape. Such

an assumed form is misshapen

and blobby, and it only vaguely

resembles the creature that the

reason stealer killed.

A reason stealer doesnt speak

any language. When

it steals a creatures

mind, it randomly

mumbles words in that

creatures language.

COMBAT

A reason stealer lashes out at prey with a sticky pseudo-

pod. Upon delivering the death blow to a foe with its

pseudopod, it steals the opponents intellect. Once a

reason stealer gains a modicum of sentience, it becomes a

far deadlier opponent because it can use all the skills,

feats, and spells it has absorbed from its prey. Sentient

reason stealers ceaselessly search for new prey because

they are desperate to avoid returning to their previous

mindless state.

178

Devour Mind (Su): A reason stealer transfers an oppo-

nents Intelligence score to itself upon dealing it a killing

blow with a slam attack. This process also heals the mon-

ster of 5 points of damage per point of Intelligence gained.

Upon devouring a mind, the reason stealer has access to

any of the dead opponents other ability scores, skill ranks,

base attack bonus, and base save bonuses, and it can use

any of these characteristics that are higher than its own. It

also gains the use of the opponents feats and any prepared

arcane spells. The reason stealer understands that it must

remove spell components from a victims body to cast

spells. All these acquired features last for 24 hours. If a

reason stealer devours the mind of a victim while it still

has the abilities of a previous one, it uses the higher of the

two (the new victims or its current value) for ability scores,

base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and skill ranks. It

also gains any feats and spells possessed by the new victim

that it did not already have.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a reason stealer hits an oppo-

nent that is its own size or smaller with a slam attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +9, including a +4 racial bonus on grapple

attacks from the sticky substance that covers its pseudo-

pod). If it gets a hold, it has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use its pseudopod to

hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the reason stealer is not considered

grappled). In either case, each successful

grapple check it makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals slam

damage.

Blindsight (Ex): A reason

stealer is blind, but its entire

body is a primitive sensory

organ that can ascertain prey

by  scent  and  vibration.

This ability enables it

to  discern

objects and

creatures with-

in 60 feet. A

reason stealer usu-

ally does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice

creatures within range of its blindsight.

Grotesque Form (Su): A reason stealer that has devoured

the mind of a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or

higher can shape its body into a bizarre reflection of that

creature. If the reason stealer has abilities gained from

more than one creature, it assumes a form similar to the

last one it killed. A reason stealer with a humanoid form can

wield weapons, using the fighting skills of any victims it

devoured. It always retains one pseudopod with which to

attack. A reason stealer can maintain a grotesque form as

long as it has an Intelligence score.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:32 PM  Page 179

Ooze Traits: A  reason  stealer  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and poly-

morphing. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

Red sundews are vicious, migratory predators

that roam forested areas hunting for

unwary  prey.  Unlike  many

carnivorous plants, the red

sundew is highly nomadic,

so it rarely remains

in one geographic

area  for  long.

Though they are

found primarily in

coastal forests and

hot jungles, red sun-

dews  can  also  in-

habit cooler wood-

lands far from these

wet areas.

A  red  sundew

measures almost

20 feet high and

10 feet across. Its

body looks like a wide mound of tangled,

ropy rags in red, green, and rust colors. These

rags are actually ropelike vines coated with a sweet-

smelling goo, which gives the plant a slick, wet appearance.

Underneath the mass of vines, a red sundew has a single

stem that measures about 12 feet high and 5 feet across. This

stem is supported by two leglike appendages.

A red sundew begins digesting its prey during combat,

smearing the sticky acid that coats its entire body over its

COMBAT

Red sundews are aggressive hunters. They attack with

their tentacles, wrapping them firmly around prey to pre-

vent escape while the sticky acid that coats their tentacles

begins the digestion process. Multiple red sundews often

travel together and combine their efforts while hunting.

These carnivorous plants flee when more than half their

number has been slain.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a red sundew hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +28). If it gets a

hold, it has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use its tentacle to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the red sundew is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals slam damage.

Sticky Acid (Ex): A red sundew is coated with a thick,

acidic goo. Any creature or object that makes physical

contact with the monster is smeared with this sticky

acid, which deals 1d6 points of acid damage per

round until removed. Thus, any successful hit

from or against the red sundew automat-

ically deals acid damage to the oppo-

nent or the opponents weapon,

depending upon the point of

contact. Sticky acid remains

on a creature or object for

1d4+1 rounds. It can-

not be scraped off, but

it can be washed off

with a full-round ac-

tion and at least 1

gallon  of  water.

Immunities

(Ex): Red sun-

dews  are  im-

mune  to  fire

and acid.

Plant Traits

(Ex): A  red  sundew  is

immune to poison, sleep, paral-

ysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to critical

hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature also has low-

light vision.

Woodsense (Ex): A red sundew can automatically sense

the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact

with vegetation, even objects or creatures that are not in

contact with the same vegetation as itself.

Many centuries ago, hidden cults of various dark gods

created large statues in the images of their lead-

ers. The faces of these statues were left blank,

except for the symbols of their deities, to indi-

cate each gods mastery over its followers.

These statues were placed at honored locations

in temples where they presided over countless

sacrifices.

A dark deity that was especially pleased with a

particular cult cell sometimes sent the tiniest

shred of its power across the dimensions to

infuse that cults statue, granting it minimal

sentience. Over the years, these divinely

powered constructs went insane,

becoming  rogue  eidolons  con-

sumed  with  murderous  rage.

Most of them destroyed the cults

over which they presided, down to

the last member, then went on to find

other victims.

A rogue eidolon is typically 12 to 14 feet

tall and usually has a humanoid shape. It is

always constructed of purple stone (often

magically treated to achieve that dis-

tinctive color), and its hands are pitch

black. Its face is blank except for a

crude symbol or rune (the symbol of

an evil deity) carved into the otherwise

featureless visage. This symbol leaks a

thick,  viscous  fluid  that  looks  like

blood and has a sharp, metallic odor.

Drops of this disgusting fluid evapo-

rate within minutes of falling to the

ground, leaving vivid red stains where

they fell. Beyond that, one rogue eidolon differs wildly

from the next in appearance, though most are badly weath-

ered and possess monstrous deformities, such as horns, a

hunched back, tumorous lumps, or misshapen limbs.

COMBAT

A rogue eidolon usually attacks any living creature it

encounters, but the nature of its insanity makes it com-

pletely unpredictable. Occasionally a rogue eidolon simply

ignores intruders, perhaps believing them to be loyal cult

members or simply animals unworthy of its attention. At

other times, it may attack and even pursue the same group,

believing its members to be infidels and enemies.

The monster attacks by smashing victims with its stony

fists. Tactics mean little to it, and its attacks are so single-

minded that it often ignores easier targets once it has

selected a victim.

Blood Spray (Su): As a free action, a rogue eidolon can

spew a gout of thick blood from the seeping symbol in its

face at a single target within 30 feet. Any creature struck

by  this  blood  must  make  a  Will  save  (DC  15)  or  be

afflicted with a terrible madness that causes it to see all its

friends as hated enemies. An affected creature immedi-

ately attacks its closest ally, using the best tactics

and items at its disposal. This murderous frenzy

prevents spellcasting but not the activation of

magic items that require spell completion, and it

lasts for 3d6 rounds. Once a rogue eidolon has used

its blood spray, it must wait 1d4 rounds before it can do

so again.

Confusion (Sp):  Any  creature  struck  by  a

rogue eidolon must make a Will save (DC 15) or

become confused. This condition is permanent;

only a greater restoration, limited wish, miracle, or

wish spell can restore the subject to

normal. The effect is otherwise

identical with that of a confusion

spell (caster level 10th).

Construct Traits: A rogue eido-

lon is immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and

any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects.

The creature is not subject to criti-

cal  hits,  subdual  damage,  ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain,

or  death  from  massive  damage.  It

cannot heal itself but can be healed

through repair. It cannot be raised or

resurrected. A rogue eidolon has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

Rukarazylls are consummate deceivers and

tricksters. When summoned to the Material

Plane (usually from the Elemental Plane

of  Earth),  they  delight  in

masquerading as charismatic

men or women. In such guises,

they often attempt to convince

locals to establish cults dedicated

to apparently benign (but

altogether fabricated)

minor  deities.  Over

time,  the  rukarazyll

slowly perverts the fol-

lowers  of  such  cults  to

the worship of an evil deity.

When it doesnt have the time

or  resources  to  seed  cults,  a

rukarazyll contents itself

with  selling  cursed

items that it

passes off as

beneficial, or posing

as a priest and inflicting

diseases on those seeking healing, or pursuing other

underhanded and cruel tricks.

In its true form, a rukarazyll is a loathsome creature. Its

body is a bulbous mass of seething fungoid matter, stud-

ded with eyes and gasping orifices that leak stinking,

black drool. It has six long, hook-studded tendrils that

extrude from various random points on its body. Three of

these tendrils serve as legs; the other three serve as hands.

Extending from the top of the body is a long scaly tenta-

cle, atop which sits a head that resembles a rams skull,

complete with horns. Great fangs stud the rukarazylls lip-

less mouth, from which bubbling acidic froth constantly

dribbles. Writhing nests of pale fungal filaments fill its

eye sockets, and more of these filaments grow out of other

random spots all over its body. The monsters natural voice

is thick and gurgling, as if its throat were partially clogged

with mud, but it can disguise its voice as well as its body

when it adopts another form.

COMBAT

The rukarazyll is physically weak, but it makes up for its

lack of strength with speed and accuracy granted by the

unholy energy it channels. It enjoys melee combat so

much that it often forgoes its spell-like abilities if a chance

to fight presents itself.

Combat with a rukarazyll is both disorienting and terrify-

ing. As a full attack action, the monster can strike with three

of its tendrils and bite with its acidic jaws. It takes full

advantage of its feats, using Expertise to best

effect and Improved Trip and Improved

Disarm as opportunities arise. It also relies

on  its  Tumble  skill  to  avoid  drawing

attacks of opportunity as it weaves about.

Fungus (Su): Any living creature struck

by a rukarazylls melee attack must make a

Fortitude saving throw (DC

20) or become infested

with the fecund fun-

gus that grows on the

monsters body. Infes-

tation requires 1 round for a

Small or smaller creature or

1d4 rounds for a Medium-

size creature. Each size cat-

egory larger than Medium-

size adds an extra 1d4 rounds

to the infestation

time. An affected

creature can free

itself of the fungus

before  infestation  is

complete with either a

remove disease spell or

by taking 10 points of fire

DR

or cold damage.

Once infestation is complete, the fibrous white fila-

ments begin to seethe and twist in the hosts body, actively

trying to resist any actions the host attempts. Because of

this, the host incurs a 2 penalty on all attack rolls, Dex-

terity-based skill checks, and Reflex saving throws. In

addition, the fungus continues to grow in the hosts body

(albeit at a much slower rate), dealing 1 point of Charisma

drain per day. A host whose Charisma reaches 0 becomes

unconscious, and within 1 hour his or her body trans-

forms into an immobile heap of fungus that lives for 3d6

weeks before perishing. Any creature that comes into con-

tact with one of these transformed bodies must make a

successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 20) or become

infested, with the same onset time and effects as infesta-

tion from the rukarazyll itself. A remove disease spell given

after infestation is complete destroys the fungus but does

not restore lost Charisma.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willalter self, blur, cats grace,

darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect magic, entangle, mirror

image, plant growth, protection from good, snare, telekinesis, tele-

port without error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), unde-

tectable alignment; 3/daypolymorph self, unhallow, unholy

blight; 1/daycommand plants, contagion, heal, wall of thorns.

Caster level 12th; save DC 14 + spell level.

Spit Ooze (Su): Once every 10 minutes, a rukarazyll

can expel a Medium-size gray ooze (see the Monster

Manual) from its mouth as a grenadelike weapon

with a 10-foot range increment. If it hits a target,

the gray ooze can immediately attempt to use

its improved grab ability and constrict if it gets

a hold. If the attack misses, determine miss

distance and direction normally. The ooze then

moves to attack in the next round. Gray oozes

created in this manner live only 2d4 rounds, dis-

solving into pools of gray goo when that dura-

tion expires.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that

normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, a

rukarazyll takes no damage on a successful save.

Outsider Traits: A rukarazyll has darkvision (60-

foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Profane Alacrity (Su): A rukarazyll is infused with

an unholy energy that grants it improved reflexes and

speed. This energy gives the monster a +3 profane

bonus to AC and allows it to take 10 on Balance,

Escape Artist, and Tumble checks in any circum-

stance. Once per hour, a rukarazyll can call upon its

profane alacrity ability to gain a temporary boost to its

movement, doubling both its speed and the profane

bonus to its AC for 1 minute. Afterward, the ruka-

razylls profane energy is depleted for 1 hour. During

this period, it has no profane bonus to AC and can-

not take 10 on Balance, Escape Artist, or Tumble

checks except in circumstances that would ordinar-

ily allow it.

Runic guardians are constructs similar to shield guardians

(see the Monster Manual), but with far superior physical

and magical capabilities. Runic guardians are espe-

cially popular among dwarves and giants, though

spellcasters of all races find them useful.

A runic guardian is a massive, human-shaped

figure made of stone, steel, and lead. Its hands and

arms are constructed of hollow stone and filled with

lead for a more deadly punch. Carved, magic runes

inlaid with precious metals adorn its head, limbs and

torso. Whenever a runic guardian casts a spell, these

runes flare up into a variety of brilliant colors.

A runic guardian serves one master that is desig-

nated at the time of its creation, and no other. The

construct is keyed to a specific, unique piece of jew-

elry (normally a ring or amulet) worn by its master

and made at the time of its creation. The master can

use this piece of jewelry to call the runic guardian to

his or her side from any distance, or even from

another plane. A runic guardian knows whether

or not the bearer of its jewelry is really its

master, and it slays any pretenders outright.

COMBAT

In battle, a runic guardian protects its master by

casting predetermined defensive spells upon him

or her, then pounding away at foes with its leaden fists.

Runic guardians equipped with offensive spells use them

only  when  directly  commanded  to  do  so.  A  runic

guardian is instantly aware of its masters death, whether

or not it was present at the time. When the masters death

occurs, the construct immediately goes on a rampage,

attacking all creatures within sight. Possession of its jew-

elry in such a circumstance gains the bearer neither con-

trol over the construct nor safety from its attacks. The

runic guardian does not stop until destroyed.

Runic Spells (Sp): A runic guardian can hold up to six

spells. These spells must be cast into its body when it is cre-

ated. One spell can be placed on the runic guardians head,

one on each limb, and one on its torso. The table below

gives the maximum level of spell that each of its body parts

can hold. Alternatively, the entire guardian can accommo-

date a single inscribed spell of 6th or 7th level, but this

covers its whole body.

Each arm

Each leg

Torso

Each of these spells

is usable once per

day as a spell-like

ability.  The  runic

guardian discharges

a  spell  either  when

directly commanded to do so

or when a predetermined sit-

uation arises.

Stunning Strike (Ex): Any

creature hit by a runic guard-

ians slam attack must make a suc-

cessful Fortitude saving throw

(DC 25) or be stunned (unable to

act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC,

and  an  attacker  gets  a  +2  bonus  on

attack rolls against it) for 1 round, in addi-

tion to taking the normal damage from the blow.

Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal crea-

tures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot

be stunned.

Construct Traits: A runic guardian is immune to

mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and

any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also

works on objects. The creature is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. It cannot

heal itself but can be healed through repair. It cannot be

raised or resurrected. A runic guardian has darkvision

(60-foot range).

Fast Healing (Ex): A runic guardian regains lost hit

points at the rate of 10 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow the runic guardian to regrow or reat-

tach lost body parts.

Find Master (Su): No matter the distance, a runic

guardian can find the piece of jewelry that connects it

with its master, and it teleports to that spot when called.

(Should the master call the construct and then remove

the jewelry, the runic guardian finds only the jewelry

upon its arrival.) This ability functions even across planar

boundaries.

Guard (Ex): The runic guardian blocks blows, granting

its master a +4 deflection bonus to AC. This power functions

only when the runic guardian is within 5 feet of its master.

Shield Master (Sp): A runic guardians master, when in

possession of the keyed piece of jewelry, can activate this

defensive ability when within 150 feet of the construct.

Shield master transfers three-fourths of the damage that

would  otherwise  be  dealt  to  the  master  to  the  runic

guardian instead. This ability otherwise functions like the

shield other spell (caster level 25th), except that it

provides no AC or saving throw bonuses.

Teleport without Er-

ror (Sp): Once  per

day, a runic guardian

can use teleport with-

out error (caster level

18th). It normally uses

this ability to answer a call

from  its  master,  teleporting

unerringly to his or her side.

CONSTRUCTION

The process for creating a runic

guardian is nearly identical with

that for creating a shield guardian.

A runic guardian costs 200,000 gp to

create. This price includes the con-

structs physical body, the keyed piece of

jewelry, and all the materials and spell com-

ponents that are consumed or become a per-

manent part of the guardian.

Creating the body requires a successful Profes-

sion (engineer) or Craft (sculpting) check (DC 20).

The creation of the keyed jewelry item requires a suc-

cessful Craft (metalworking) check (DC 15). This

jewelry is always made of the same metals and other

materials as the guardians runes.

After the body and jewelry are constructed, the

creature must be animated through magical rites that

require one month to complete. The creator must be at

least 16th level and have the Craft Wondrous Item feat.

The creator must cast any spells he or she wishes to

place on the runic guardian personally at this time,

though they may come from an outside source such as

a scroll. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours per

day in a specially prepared workroom or laboratory that

costs 2,000 gp to establish.

creatures, or it is in danger of dying, does a shadow spider

return to its larder and begin eating. Shadow spiders never

clean up their traps, so adventurers occasionally get fore-

warning of one from the dropped items (belongings of past

victims) that litter the area.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a shadow spider hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with two claw attacks, it deals normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +29). If it gets a hold,

it has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use two claws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the shadow spider is not considered grappled).

In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals damage for

two claw attacks.

Paralysis (Ex): A shadow spiders teeth are coated

with a paralyzing fluid. Any creature hit by its bite must

make a successful Fortitude save (DC 21) or be paralyzed

for 4 rounds.

Silk Slick (Su): As a full-round action, a shadow spider

can spray a layer of spider silk over any solid surface. It can

cover up to 100 square feet with this substance, which dries

and evaporates in 13 rounds. The slick silk functions in all

other respects like a grease spell (caster level 13th; Reflex

save DC 21).

Shadow Walk (Sp): At will, a shadow spider can use shadow

walk (caster level 10th; Will save DC 16).

Skills: *A shadow spider gets a +20 circumstance bonus

on Hide checks when in shadows.

Shadow spiders are carnivorous ambush predators from the

Plane of Shadow that prefer to hunt on the Material Plane.

They possess frightening intelligence and cunning.

A shadow spider is a huge, shadowy arachnid. It has a

5-foot-diameter body and stands roughly 2 1/2 feet tall.

Its eight eyes are such a deep red color that they ap-

pear black.

A shadow spider maintains a larder (actually a

pocket in the Plane of Shadow) stacked with the

desiccated corpses of its prey. The monster never

carries treasure; it simply leaves its victims pos-

sessions on the corpses. When its larder becomes

overfilled, the shadow spider abandons it and

finds a new one to fill with food.

Shadow spiders speak Common.

COMBAT

A shadow spider prepares elaborate traps

for its victims in dungeons and caverns.

It uses its silk slick ability to make a slope

or stair slippery, then waits in the shad-

ows at the bottom. When a creature falls,

the shadow spider steps out of the shad-

ows and attempts to grab its prey with its

four foreclaws. If successful, the monster

uses shadow walk to carry the victim to its

larder in the Plane of Shadow. Once there,

the shadow spider paralyzes and abandons

that creature, then returns to its trap for

more prey. Only when there are no more

by diving underwater. For a stranger, and particularly a

male, earning the trust of a sirine is nearly impossible.

These creatures trust no one except other sirines, though

in time of need they do accept any offered aid. Such assis-

tance does not earn the giver any more of a sirines com-

pany than would otherwise have been bestowed, how-

ever, nor does the creature feel obligated to reward its

benefactor in any way. Occasionally a sirine bestows

a gift, usually a small gem, seashell, or other trin-

ket, on an admirer who has been particularly

charming company.

COMBAT

Sirines are not especially tough in a stand-

up  fight,  but  they  excel  at  evading  and

escaping  from  enemies. They  rarely  let

themselves get drawn into battle unless

their homes are threatened. Instead,

they use their spell-like abilities and

special attacks to slip away, or use a com-

bination of singing and Intelligence

drain to incapacitate foes and then

dump them far away where they can

cause no harm.

Approxmiately one-third

of all sirines are proficient

with bows, javelins, or slings.

About one in ten sirines has

a magic weapon, usually a javelin of lightning.

Charming Song (Sp): At will, a sirine can sing a special

song that functions like a charm person spell (caster level

2nd; save DC 14), except that it lasts for 11 hours and affects

every creature that hears it.

Intelligence Damage (Su): Any creature hit by a sirines

touch attack takes 1d4 points of Intelligence damage (or

2d4 points on a critical hit).

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayfog cloud, improved invisibil-

ity, polymorph self. Caster level 11th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Deflection (Su): A sirine is surrounded by an aura that

grants it a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus.

Soothing Touch (Su): A sirine, if it desires, can use its

touch to restore 1d6 points of Intelligence damage caused

by any sirine.

Skills: A sirine receives a +8 racial bonus on Perform

checks.

Sirines are playful, gregarious creatures that love to sing,

swim, dance, and laugh. They frequently draw strangers into

their games and parties, but they rarely grant such visitors

more than a few hours of their time.

A sirine appears to be a normal human woman in most

respects, although its skin often has a noticeable yellow or

green tinge. The hair can be any normal, human hair color,

or it can be lustrous silver or dark green. A sirine wears only

lightweight clothing while on land and often nothing at all

while in the water. The typical sirine carries a short sword or

dagger at all times.

Although sirines are always happy to have fun with

strangers, they are extremely reclusive about their commu-

nities. They take care to seek camaraderie only when away

from their homes, and then only for a short while. Any crea-

ture that follows a sirine home, or stumbles upon that loca-

tion accidentally, is likely to come under attack.

After a few hours, most sirines have had enough of the

companionship of other creatures, so they slip away, usually

Spawn of Kyuss are disgusting undead

creatures created by Kyuss, a powerful

evil cleric turned demigod. Com-

pletely  mad,  the  spawn  of  Kyuss

wander  caverns,  crypts,  and  some-

times the open countryside search-

ing for victims.

A spawn of Kyuss looks like a

well-rotted zombie. Only once

the monster is within 20 feet

do the writhing, green worms

crawling in and out of its skull ori-

fices become apparent. A spawn of

Kyuss is usually clad in rotted cloth-

ing,  though  a  rare  few  wear

decaying pieces of armor.

A cleric of 16th level or higher

may  use  a  create  greater  undead

spell to create new spawn of Kyuss.

This process requires maggots from the

corpse of a diseased creature in addition to the normal

material components.

Spawn of Kyuss split into multiple smaller groups when

creating their own spawn, and it is rare to encounter more

than three of them together. Occasionally a larger creature

falls under the curse of a spawn of Kyuss and follows it as a

normal zombie (see below).

186

Unlike zombies, spawn of Kyuss are not limited to partial

actions, and they are intelligent enough to pretend that they

have restricted movement until ready to attack. They nor-

mally use their fear auras to scatter victims, then gang up on

individuals until they have caught all opponents.

Create Spawn (Su): Once per round as a free action, a

spawn of Kyuss can transfer a worm from its own body to

that of an opponent. It can do this whenever it hits with a

slam attack, but it can also make the transfer by means of a

successful melee touch attack or a ranged touch attack, hurl-

ing a worm at a foe from a distance of up to 10 feet.

Each worm is a Fine vermin with AC 10 and 1 hit point.

It can be killed with normal damage or by the touch of

silver. On the spawns next action, the worm burrows into

its hosts flesh. (A creature with a natural armor bonus of +5

or higher is immune to this burrowing effect.) The worm

makes its way toward the hosts brain, dealing 1 point of

damage per round for 1d4+1 rounds. At the end of that

period, it reaches the brain. While the worm is inside a

victim, a remove curse or remove disease effect destroys it,

and a dispel evil or neutralize poison effect delays its

progress for 10d6 minutes. A successful Heal check (DC

20) extracts the worm and kills it.

Once the worm reaches the brain, it deals 1d2 points

of Intelligence damage per round until it either is

killed (by remove curse or remove

disease)  or  slays  its  host

(death occurs at 0 Intelli-

gence). A Small, Medium-

size, or Large creature slain

by a worm rises as a new spawn

of Kyuss 1d6+4 rounds later;

a Tiny or smaller creature

quickly  putrefies;  and  a

Huge or larger creature be-

comes a normal zombie of the

appropriate size. Newly created

spawn are not under the control

of their parent, but they usually

follow  whatever  spawn  of

Kyuss created them.

BS

Fear Aura (Su): A spawn of Kyuss contin-

uously radiates a fear effect. This ability func-

tions like a fear spell (caster level 7th; Will

save DC 14), except that it affects all creatures within a

40-foot radius. Any creature that makes a successful saving

throw against the effect cannot be affected again by the fear

aura of that spawn of Kyuss for 24 hours.

Kyusss Gift (Su): Any creature hit by a spawn of

Kyusss slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC

12) or contract this supernatural disease. The incubation

period is 1 day, and the disease deals 1d6 points of Consti-

tution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (see

Disease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:33 PM  Page 187

These effects manifest as rotting flesh and dementia. An

affected creature gets only half the benefits of natural

and magical healing, though a cure disease effect removes

the affliction.

Curative Transformation (Ex): Any remove curse or

remove disease effect, or a more powerful version of either

of these effects, transforms a spawn of Kyuss into a nor-

mal zombie.

Fast Healing (Ex): A spawn of Kyuss regains lost hit

points at the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow the spawn of Kyuss

to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A spawn

of Kyuss is treated as an undead

with 6 Hit Dice for the pur-

pose  of  turn,  rebuke,  com-

These creatures are enigmatic in the extreme. Outside of

the fact that they covet magic items, little is known about

them. Most encounters with spell weavers

occur when they attempt to purloin magic

items from other creatures.

A spell weaver is a scrawny, hair-

less, six-armed creaure about 5 feet

tall. It is humanoid in shape, with a

vaguely birdlike face and large, dark

eyes. A long neck allows it to twist

and turn its face in any direction.

Usually only one spell weaver is

encountered at a time, but occasion-

ally these monsters organize them-

selves into a raiding party to seize a

particular  item.  Such  a  raid  is

extremely well planned and is usually

the result of months of investiga-

tion conducted through a combi-

nation  of  scrying  and  simple

spyingan activity made easier by

the spell weavers invisibility power.

Spell weavers do not communicate

with anyone except their own kind.

This means, of course, that no one has

ever had a meaningful conversation

with  a  spell  weaver,  so  nothing  is

known about the background, motiva-

tions, or society of these creatures other

than what their actions reveal. Occasion-

ally, for reasons that no one else under-

stands, a spell weaver leaves a written

note where a humanoid can find it.

Such messages are invariably ram-

bling and often completely incoherent,

so  they  usually  raise  more  questions

than they answer.

Spell weavers do not speak, but they can

communicate with one another telepathi-

cally across a distance of 1,000 miles.

COMBAT

A spell weaver is pathetically weak in melee but powerful in

magic. Its ability to cast multiple spells simultaneously

makes it a dangerous opponent indeed. A spell weaver usu-

ally remains invisible until it is ready to attack, then uses

plane shift to escape, hopefully in possession of the magic

item for which it came.

Spell-Like Abilities: Always activesee invisiblity; at

willdetect magic, invisibility; 1/dayplane shift. Caster

level equals spell weavers effective sorcerer level; save DC

13 + spell level.

Spells: A spell weaver casts spells as a sorcerer two levels

higher than its Hit Dice. (That is, a spell weaver with 10 Hit

Dice casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer; spells known

9/5/5/4/3/2/1; spells/day 6/7/7/7/6/5/3; save DC 13 +

spell level, or 15 + spell level for Abjuration and Evocation

spells.) A spell weaver prefers combinations of spells that

focus on attacks, defense, and transportation.

Chromatic Disk: A spell weaver is never without its

chromatic disk. This 6-inch-diameter indestructible disk

glows with colors that slowly shift through the spectrum.

This object stores ten additional spell levels of energy

that the creature can tap and use as it wishesthe spell

weaver could, for example, cast two extra 5th-level spells

in a day, or three 3rd-level spells and one 1st-level spell,

or any other combination of extra spell levels that adds

up to ten, so long as no single spell is higher than 5th

level. (For this purpose, two 0-level spells are equivalent

to one 1st-level spell.) To tap this spell energy, a spell

weaver must hold the chromatic disk in at least one of its

hands. The disk automatically recharges itself to full

power every night, at midnight. A spell powered by the

disk is cast as though the caster had the Spell Focus feat

for the spell in question.

Only a spell weaver can utilize a chromatic disk. Should

any other creature pick one up and try to tap its energy (by

employing the Use Magic Device skill, for instance), it

explodes, dealing 4d10 points of damage to everything

within a 30-foot radius.

time. Casting a spell occupies a number of the spell weavers

arms equal to the spells level (maximum 6th). A spell

weaver can cast more than one spell simultaneously, as

long as the sum of the spell levels is six or less. It could, for

example, cast one 6th-level spell, one 4th-level and one 2nd-

level spell, one 3rd-level and three 1st-level spells, six 1st-

level spells, or any combination of spells whose levels add

up to six or less. (A single 0-level spell occupies one arm.)

Telepathy (Su): Spell weavers can communicate with

each other telepathically at a range of up to 1,000 miles.

Spellgaunts  feast  upon  the  arcane

energy stored within magic items and

creatures that use spells, draining the

magic from them in the process.

A spellgaunt appears as a bizarre,

elongated arachnid. Its spindly legs

are 10 feet long, and its flat, golden

body is covered with hairy, chiti-

nous plates. The monster has tre-

mendous, saw-edged fangs that

end  in  fine,  razor-sharp  points.

Sparkling saliva drips continuously

from its maw.

COMBAT

A spellgaunt senses magic items and attacks any creature

that carries one. It usually tries to immobilize foes with its

force web first, then moves in to feed, drinking up the

strongest magic first. Foes that evade its webs are bitten and

clawed. If outnumbered, a spellgaunt moves quickly to

snatch any visibly displayed magic items, then flees to its

lair to feed in peace.

Disjunctive Bite (Su): A magic item bitten by a spell-

gaunt (see Attacking an Object in Chapter 8 of the Players

Handbook) must make a successful Will save (DC 23) or

instantly become a nonmagical object. A spellgaunt feeding

on an artifact has a 33% chance of destroying the item. If it

destroys the item, it must make a successful Fortitude save

(DC 25) or die instantly from an overwhelming ingestion of

magical energy.

A spellcaster or a creature with supernatural or spell-like

abilities that is bitten by a spellgaunt must make a Fortitude

save (DC 23) or lose the ability to cast spells or use its magi-

cal abilities for 1d2 rounds.

Enhanced Bite (Ex): A spellgaunts fangs function as

+4 weapons.

Force Web (Su): A spellgaunt can spray flexible strands

of sticky, invisible force at a single Medium-size or smaller

target up to 20 feet away. A successful Reflex save (DC 23)

lets the target avoid the webs; failure means the creature is

stuck and entangled (2 penalty on attack rolls and 4

penalty to Dexterity). A force web is immune to damage of

all kinds from most spells, including dispel magic. However,

disintegrate immediately destroys a force web, and it is also

vulnerable to the effects of a sphere of annihilation or a rod of

cancellation. Since force webs extend into the Ethereal

Plane, they also affect ethereal creatures. A force web dis-

solves after 1d4 hours.

Snatch Item (Ex): A spellgaunt can take an openly dis-

played magic item away from an opponent with a successful

disarm attempt, whether or not the item is actually a

weapon. It cannot remove armor or other items that are

attached at multiple locations, but it can snatch forcefully

enough to break a single strap or other such attachment

the strap holding a wand to an opponents belt, for example.

Detect Magic (Su): A spellgaunt can see magical auras

in its line of sight to a range of 120 feet. It immediately

senses the aura strength of each magic item and magical

effect it detects.

Quick Leap (Ex): A spellgaunt can make a standing jump

as a free action.

Skills: A spellgaunt receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks, a +6 racial bonus on Jump checks, and a +12 racial

bonus on Spot checks.

A spirit of the land is a powerful force of nature that lies dor-

mant until the area it guards is threatened. Each inhabits a

particular geographical area, existing as a living part of the

land. A spirit of the land usually assumes dominion over a

small valley, a river, a desert, or some other bounded geo-

graphical feature. These creatures dwell in all regions of the

world, and more than one can exist within the same area,

each concerned with a particular aspect of the terrain.

In its natural form, a spirit of the land is an invisible and

intangible force. It appears as a shapeless mist to creatures

that can see invisible things. When it wishes to manifest a

physical form, a spirit of the land can assume the shape of a

humanoid, animal, or elemental of its own size composed of

one particular elementair, earth, fire, or water.

Spirits of the land are always aware of what transpires in

their territories, and they punish all who would ravage or

defile them. They get along well with druids as well as with

races that respect the land.

Spirits of the land speak Common, Elven, Dwarven, and

most goblinoid languages. They can also communicate tele-

pathically with speakers of other languages.

COMBAT

In combat, a spirit of the land prefers to strike invisibly,

using its command over weather, nature, and the elements

to destroy its enemies. Opponents may find themselves

confronted by an earthquake, followed by a rain of lightning

bolts accompanied by hurricane-force winds. A spirit attacks

relentlessly, coordinating its actions to keep foes off balance

while remaining unseen. To fight in melee, a spirit of the land

must manifest an elemental form. In this shape, it usually

focuses on destroying one foe before moving on to the next.

All-Around Vision (Ex): A spirit of

the land is a part of all the terrain that

surrounds it, so it sees from all direc-

tions at once. Because of this ability, it

gains a +4 racial bonus on Search and Spot

checks, and it cannot be flanked, regardless

of its form.

Elemental  Manifestation  (Su):

Once per day, a spirit of the land can

assume a form composed of elemental

material (air, earth, fire, or water), so long as

that element exists in some form on its ter-

rain. In elemental form, a spirit of the

land is no longer invisible or incorporeal.

It gains the element-specific qualities

noted in the appropriate manifestation sec-

tion below and loses the benefits of

the incorporeal subtype. Should a

spirit  of  the  lands  elemental

manifestation be destroyed, the

monster dissipates but is

not slain. A dissipated

telepathically with any creature within 5 miles that has a

language.

Feats: *A spirit of the land has access to the feats marked

with an asterisk only while it is manifested.

AIR MANIFESTATION

To manifest as air, a spirit of the land must have a

windy valley, breezy seashore, or the like in its ter-

rain. In this form, it gains the following abilities.

Air Mastery (Ex): Any airborne creature takes a 1

penalty on attack and damage rolls made against a

spirit of the land manifested as air.

Flight (Ex): A spirit of the land manifested

as air is naturally buoyant. At will as a free

action, it can produce an effect like that of

the fly spell (caster level 5th), except that the

effect applies only to itself. This ability gives

it a fly speed of 120 feet (perfect).

EARTH MANIFESTATION

An earth manifestation simply requires any

type of land. In this form, a spirit of the land

gains the following ability.

Earth Mastery (Ex): A spirit of the land

manifested as earth gains a +1 bonus on

attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching

the ground.

FIRE MANIFESTATION

A fire manifestation re-

quires a volcanic region,

hot spring, or the like

on  the  spirit  of  the

lands terrain. In this form, it gains

the following abilities.

MD

While a spirit of the land is manifested, the following

changes to its statistics are in effect: AC 19, touch 9, flat-footed

18; Atk +14 melee (2d8+6, 2 slams); SQ DR 30/+3; Str 23.

Incorporeal Subtype: In its incorporeal form, a spirit of

the land can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures,

+1 or better magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and

supernatural abilities. The creature has a 50% chance to

ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force

effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. An incor-

poreal spirit of the land can pass through solid objects, but

not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor,

armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects

work normally against them. An incorporeal spirit of the

land always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen

checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Natural Invisibility (Su): An incorporeal spirit of the

land remains invisible even when it attacks. This ability is

Burn (Ex): Any creature that is hit by the slam attack of a

spirit of the land manifested as fire, or that hits the monster

with a natural weapon or an unarmed attack, must succeed

at a Reflex save (DC 30) or catch on fire. The fire burns for

1d4 rounds.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A spirit of the land manifested as fire

is immune to fire damage but takes double damage from

cold unless a saving throw for half damage is allowed. In

that case, the creature takes half damage on a success and

double damage on a failure.

WATER MANIFESTATION

To manifest as water, a spirit of the land must have a river,

lake, pond, or other waterway in its terrain. In this form, it

gains the following abilities.

The stone spike is a cousin of the earth elemental. Dwarf

spellcasters often summon and bind stone spikes to serve as

guards and to assist

with tunnel construction. They are slow but untiring fight-

ers and workers.

A stone spike resembles a roughly sculpted column of

stone with four or more crystal-tipped arms. Sharp, stony

protrusions cover its body.

Stone spikes seem to like dwarves, and they usually serve

such masters without complaint. Sages speculate that the

monsters think of dwarves as kindred spiritshard-working,

rugged, and indomitable.

Stone spikes speak Terran and Dwarven.

COMBAT

Stone spikes lack the coordination to employ more than two

of their arms at once. These creatures prefer to plod resolutely

forward in combat, battering any foe that comes within reach.

Elemental Traits (Ex): A stone spike is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to crit-

ical hits or flanking, and it cannot be raised or resurrected.

The creature also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Swamplight lynxes are sleek, nocturnal hunters that prowl

marshes and wet lowlands. They are fond of humanoid

prey, and they especially enjoy the taste of elven flesh.

A swamplight lynx is a sturdy animal, 9 to 10 feet long,

with a sleek, lithe, feline body. It has large paws, a small

head, and a short tail. Its coat can be any shade from dark

yellow to olive, and this coloration allows it to blend in

easily with its swampy surroundings.

A  swamplight

lynx  cannot  speak,

but it can be trained

to understand any

one language.

COMBAT

Swamplight lynxes

are  cunning  foes,

whether  stalking

their prey over long

distances or waiting

patiently in ambush.

They often use their

light ability to sur-

prise, distract and

confuse their prey

before  pouncing

with  bared  claws.

Swamplight  lynxes

are solitary animals,

but they do engage in

cooperative  hunting.

Pounce (Ex): If a swamplight lynx charges, it can make a

full attack (including a rake attempt; see below) even

though it has moved.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a swamplight lynx hits an op-

ponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity (grapple bonus +19). If it gets a hold, it

can also rake on the same round. Thereafter, it has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grap-

ple check, but the swamplight lynx is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Rake (Ex): On any round

that a swamplight lynx has

a  hold  on  an  opponent  (see

Improved Grab, above), it can make

two rake attacks (+14 melee) with its hind

legs for 1d3+2 points of damage each. The

swamplight lynx can also attempt to rake

when it pounces on an opponent.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblur, daze, faerie fire,

light.  Caster level 6th; save DC 12 + spell level.

Marsh Move (Ex): Swamplight lynxes take no move-

ment penalties for moving in marshes or mud.

Skills: *A swamplight lynx receives a +4 bonus on Hide

checks when in marshlands.

Sylphs are native to the Elemental Plane of Air, but

they have a liking for the scenery of the Material

Plane. They often maintain homes high in the

mountains, but since they love to travel, they

are rarely found near their homes.

A sylph appears as a small, beautiful woman

with translucent, brightly colored wings. The

typical sylph prefers filmy clothing and brightly

colored jewelry.

Sylphs always become invisible at the approach of

strangers and remain so until they know whether

there is any danger. The mere presence of danger,

however, doesnt necessarily cause them to flee; they

are so naturally curious that they may linger in dan-

gerous situations just to watch. They are generally

friendly, especially to human males.

Sylphs speak Auran and Common.

COMBAT

Sylphs seldom engage in physical combat and

usually do not carry any weapons. They depend

on their spells and special abilities to protect

themselves. When  threatened,  they  often

summon elementals to defend them.

Though it resembles a massive storm, a tempest is actually

an intelligent, living creature related to both elementals and

genies. All four elements coexist within its form: air in the

wind, earth in the whirling sand and dirt, fire in the heat of

the lightning, and water in the rain.

Tempests are uncommunicative for the most part. Very rarely,

one of them may know a few dozen words in Common. Other

A tempest is seldom in a good mood, so most encounters

with these creatures end in a battle.

Burn (Ex): Anyone hit by a tempests slam attack must

succeed at a Reflex save (DC 31) or catch fire. The flame

burns for 1d4 rounds. A burning creature can take a move-

equivalent action to put out the fire. Any creature hitting a

tempest with a natural weapon or unarmed attack takes fire

damage as though hit by its slam attack and also catches fire

unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.

Drench (Ex): The tempests touch puts out torches,

campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of

nonmagical origin if these are of Huge size or smaller. The

creature can dispel magical fire it touches as if by dispel magic

(caster level equal to tempests HD).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willchill touch, gust of wind, light-

ning bolt, wind wall. Caster level 9th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Whirlwind (Su): A tempest can transform itself into a

whirlwind (or vortex if underwater) once every 10 minutes

and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it

has. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet

wide at the top, and between 10 and 50 feet tall (tempests

choice). In this form, it can move through the air (or water,

as a vortex) or along a surface at its fly speed.

Any creature one or more size categories smaller than

the tempest that comes into contact with the whirlwind

must make a successful Reflex save (DC 31) or take 4d6

points of damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex

save (DC 31) or be picked up bodily and held suspended

in the powerful winds, automatically taking 4d6 points of

damage per round. A creature that can fly is allowed a

Reflex save at the same DC each round to escape the

whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if

the save is successful. The tempest can eject any carried

creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever

it happens to be.

If the whirlwinds base touches the ground, it creates a

swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the

tempest and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwinds

height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision,

beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half conceal-

ment, while those farther away have total concealment.

Anyone caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentra-

tion check (DC 31) to cast a spell.

Defensive Aura (Sp): A tempest has a +10 deflection bonus

to Armor Class. This ability is always in effect.

Elemental Mastery (Ex): A tempest gains a +1 bonus on

attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are in contact

with any of the four elements (air, earth, fire, or water).

Elemental Traits (Ex): A tempest is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to critical hits or

flanking, and it cannot be raised or resurrected. The creature

also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Fire Subtype (Ex): A tempest is immune to fire damage

but takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for

half damage is allowed. In that case, the creature takes half

damage on a success and double damage on a failure.

Teratomorphs lurk in the watery

depths of the sea and in under-

ground caverns. Normally,

they spend most of their

time  floating  on  under-

water currents, but some-

times these currents

wash them ashore.

Occasionally  they

come ashore of their own

volition to search for food.

194

A teratomorph is a shapeless horror the size of a cottage. Its

body consists primarily of thick, translucent, iridescent slime

coating coils of opaque tissue that shift and move, as though

constantly in a state of flux. Beneath its slimy hide, bursts of

energy occasionally flash, lighting portions of its form

momentarily. Sections of the ooze periodically emit beams of

light or crackling energy, while other sections fade into

smoke or vanish altogether.

A teratomorph gains nutrients by infesting living creatures

with the force of chaos. The very act of transforming another

creature with its entropic touch sustains and nurtures the

oozes growth. But a creature does not have to come in contact

with a teratomorph to experience its entropic effects. In fact,

the monsters very presence can unravel reality and tear holes

in the fabric between planes. Unlucky creatures that pass too

close to a teratomorph sometimes find themselves trans-

ported to other planes with no means of returning.

Powerful spellcasters have long sought ways to harness

the powers of the teratomorph. Unfortunately, portions of

the ooze that are separated from the main body do not last

long, dissolving into nothingness after only a few hours. The

otherworldly matter that makes up the body of a terato-

morph remains unstable until enough of it is concentrated

in one place that its mass defeats the internal forces working

to tear it apart. This effect probably explains why terato-

morphs smaller than Gargantuan are never encountered.

When such a creature reaches 84 Hit Dice, it immediately

splits into smaller oozes, each with 28 Hit Dice.

COMBAT

The teratomorph is a mindless creature. When it isnt eating,

it is on the move looking for something to eat. It surges

forth to attack any Small or larger creature that passes

within range of its blindsight, but it ignores crea-

tures smaller than this.

A teratomorph attacks by extruding a

massive wave of chaotic protoplasm to smash

its  prey.  Not  only  does

this attack deal extensive

bludgeoning damage, it

also infuses the creature

touched  with  raw  chaos.

Entropic Touch (Su):

The entropic energy that

surges through a terato-

morphs  shapeless  body

causes horrible transforma-

tions in living creatures that

come into contact with it. If a

creature struck by a terato-

morphs slam attack fails a Forti-

tude saving throw (DC 29),

its body transforms in

some way, causing one

of the following effects:

Result

Physical Mutation. The touch of the teratomorph trans-

forms the opponents anatomy, resulting in 1d6 points of

Strength drain or Dexterity drain (50% chance for each).

Tissue Annihilation. The touch of the ooze causes tiny

portions of the opponents anatomy to vanish, resulting in

2d4 points of Constitution drain.

Transformation. The opponent undergoes a transformation

as though affected by a polymorph any object spell (caster

level 20th). This painful process deals 5d20 points of sub-

dual damage. The DM can randomly determine the

subjects new form or choose a particular form.

Bonding. The ooze sticks to the target and automatically

succeeds at a grapple check. Each round thereafter, the

teratomorph can attempt a new grapple check (grapple

bonus +44) to deal 4d6+16 points of bludgeoning damage.

The opponent must succeed at a new Fortitude saving

throw (DC 29) each round that the teratomorph deals

damage to avoid further effects from the entropic touch. (If

this result comes up more than once, roll again.)

Absorption. The opponent is entirely absorbed by the ooze.

An absorbed creature dies instantly and leaves behind no

trace of a body, so only a miracle, true resurrection, or wish

spell can restore it to life. Absorbing a creature grants the

ooze a new permanent Hit Die.

Portalwake (Su): The presence of a teratomorph places

tremendous strain on the borders between the planes, caus-

ing tears and rips to appear nearby. Each round, one creature

within a 120-foot radius of the teratomorph, chosen at

random, must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 19) or be

moved to a random plane as though by a plane shift spell.

Warp Reality (Su): The potent chaotic energy that surges

through and out of a teratomorphs body can have amazing

effects on the surrounding terrain. When the monster is at

rest, this energy is calm, but when the monster moves or

attacks, the energy lashes out in a 120-foot emanation.

These ripples of chaos cause the surrounding terrain to

warp and writhe, imposing a 4 circumstance penalty on

attack rolls and Dexterity checks for all creatures in the area

except the teratomorph.

Every round that this reality warp persists, there is a 10%

chance that the chaotic energy manifests in a more dra-

matic manner. Such chaos manifestations duplicate spell

effects. Roll 1d20 and refer to the appropriate line on the

following table to determine the spells effects produced.

All these effects function as the spells of the same names

(caster level 20th; save DC 10 + spell level), except that they

affect all the appropriate targets (except the teratomorph)

within the warp reality area and last for 1 round.

Blindsight (Ex): A teratomorph is blind, but its entire

body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by

scent and vibration. This ability enables it to discern objects

and creatures within 240 feet. A teratomorph usually does

not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures

within range of its blindsight.

Detect Law (Su): A teratomorph has a continual detect

law ability (as the spell) with a range of 20 feet.

Dimensional Instability (Su): Each time an opponent

strikes a teratomorph with a weapon, there is a chance that

the portion of the creatures body struck simply doesnt

exist at that instant. Any melee or ranged attack directed at

the teratomorph has a 20% miss chance that cannot be

avoided with spells such as true seeing or true strike. Dimen-

sional anchor negates this ability, reducing the miss chance

to 0% for the duration of the effect.

Immunities (Ex): A teratomorph is immune to light-

ning, acid, and all spells with the chaotic descriptor.

Ooze Traits: A teratomorph is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.

It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

Thri-kreen, often called mantis warriors, are intelligent

humanoids with insectlike features. They prefer deserts

and savannas, where they maintain a nomadic lifestyle

as hunters.

A thri-kreen looks like a bipedal praying mantis. Of the

six limbs protruding from its midsection, two are used for

walking, and each of the other four ends in a four-fingered

hand. A sandy yellow exoskeleton covers an adult thri-kreens

body. Two compound eyes, two antennae, and a complicated

jaw structure that includes a pair of wicked mandibles give

its head an insectlike appearance. The typical thri-kreen

wears a harness, belt, and slings for holding its equipment,

but no clothing or armor.

Thri-kreen are at home in arid, open landscapes where

they can easily blend in with the windblown dunes and

bare rock. Permanent thri-kreen communities are almost

nonexistent; instead, packs of thri-kreen range widely

over their own territories, foraging and hunting for daily

sustenance. On rare occasions, two or more packs

may come together to join their strength against

especially dangerous intruders.

Thri-kreen speak a language made up of clicks

and snaps of their mandibles. Most thri-kreen

whose packs roam near humanoid civilizations

also speak Common.

COMBAT

While hunting, thri-kreen use their natural

camouflage to sneak up on potential prey. Thri-

kreen can close to combat (and flee from it) more

quickly than most of their foes because of

their speed and their ability to leap. They

can use the gythka and chatkcha

(exotic weapons that are unique to

mantis warriors), but they prefer

to attack with their claws and their

poisoned bites.

Poison (Ex): A thri-kreen delivers its

poison (Fortitude save DC 11) with a suc-

cessful bite attack. The initial and

secondary  damage  is  the  same

(paralysis for 2d6 minutes). A thri-

kreen produces enough poison for

one bite per day.

Psionics (Sp): *When using

the Psionics Handbook, apply

the following psionic abili-

ties to a thri-kreen. At will

chameleon, know direction; 1/day

displacement, lesser metaphysical weapon. Manifester level

10th; save DC 8 + power level.

Attack/Defense Modes: ego whip, mind thrust/thought shield,

empty mind. A thri-kreen manifests powers, and gains

additional attack and defense modes, as if it were a psychic

warrior or a psion with Psychometabolism as its primary

discipline. (A psionic thri-kreen characters favored class

is psychic warrior, though a few choose monk or psion

with the primary discipline of Psychometabolism.)

Immunity to Sleep (Ex): Since thri-kreen do not sleep,

they are immune to magic sleep effects. A thri-kreen spellcaster

still requires 8 hours of rest before preparing spells.

competence bonus on all Jump checks, and its maximum

jumping distance is not limited by height.

Skills: *The exoskeleton of a thri-kreen blends in well

with desert terrain, granting it a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks in sandy or arid settings.

THRI-KREEN CHARACTERS

A thri-kreen characters preferred class is ranger, but a

few prefer the path of the cleric or druid. A thri-kreen

character begins play with Hit Dice 2d8, which gives it a

+2 base attack bonus; base saves Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +3;

Deflect Arrows, Exotic Weapon Proficiency [gythka], and

Exotic Weapon Proficiency [chatkcha] as bonus feats; one

additional feat of choice; and skill points equal to twice

its Intelligence score. Its class skills as a thri-kreen are

Balance, Climb, Hide, Jump, Listen, and Spot. Many

thri-kreen also qualify for the monstrous feats Multi-

attack, Multidexterity, and Multiweapon Fighting

and choose these in preference over other feats.

A nonpsionic thri-kreen PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level + 3. Thus, a 1st-level non-

psionic thri-kreen ranger has an ECL of 4 and is the

equivalent of a 4th-level character.

A psionic thri-kreen PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level +5. Thus, a 1st-level psionic

thri-kreen ranger has an ECL of 6 and is the

equivalent of a 6th-level character.

THRI-KREEN EQUIPMENT

Thri-kreen warriors have invented two exotic

weapons that are unique to their racethe gythka

and the chatkcha. These are described below.

Gythka: This Large exotic melee double

weapon is a polearm with a blade at each end.

The wielder can fight with it as if fighting with

two weapons, but doing so incurs all the

normal attack penalties associated with

fighting  with  two  weapons,  as  if  the

wielder had a one-handed weapon and

a light weapon (see Attacking with

Two Weapons  in  Chapter  8  of  the

Players Handbook). A thri-kreen who has the Multi-

weapon Fighting feat can wield two gythkas at once as

double weapons because of its four arms.

Each end of a gythka deals 2d6 points of damage. Each

end is a slashing weapon that deals double damage on a crit-

ical hit and threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of 20.

Cost: 60 gp; Weight: 25 lb.

Chatkcha: This Medium-size exotic ranged weapon is a

crystalline throwing wedge. Its sheer weight makes it

unwieldy in the hands of those not proficient with it.

A chatkcha deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and has a

range increment of 20 feet. It deals double damage on a crit-

ical hit and threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of 20.

Leap (Ex): A thri-kreen is a natural jumper. It gains a +30

Cost: 1 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

selves in nor-

they  look

But  these

m o n s t e r s

have a spe-

cial taste for

blood,  and

they  greatly

prefer  that  to

making  food

through photosynthe-

sis. Indeed, a twig blight

that lives underground must subsist on blood, since it gets

no sunlight.

A twig blight normally stands about 3 1/2 feet tall. Its leaf-

less branches interlock to create a humanoid shape.

Sages believe that the first twig blights grew from seeds

of the Gulthias Tree, which sprouted from a wooden stake

used to slay an ancient vampire. Instead of producing fruit,

twig blights reproduce through their root systems, like

aspen trees.

Twig blights speak Sylvan.

COMBAT

Twig blights usually huddle together in a group, trying to

blend in with an areas natural vegetation (or with piles of

debris or firewood) until suitable prey comes along. They

particularly enjoy lurking near campsites or waterholes,

where they can often catch prey unawares.

Poison (Ex): A twig blight delivers its poison (Fortitude

save DC 11) with each successful claw attack. The initial

damage is 1 point of Strength damage; there is no second-

ary damage.

Plant Traits (Ex): A twig blight is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature

also has low-light vision.

Skills and Feats: A twig blight gains skills and feats as a fey.

Vaporighus are native to the plane of Gehenna. In all respects

they are petty, sadistic, and voracious. The only force that

motivates them is the gnawing pain of hunger that they can

never satiate.

A vaporighu is a hideous, bloated, waddling blob of hairy

flesh, vaguely humanoid in shape. Its skin is the color of

throw (DC 15) or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. An

opponent who succeeds at the saving throw is immune to

that vaporighus fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affect-

ing fear effect.

Poison Breath (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a vaporighu

can exhale poison breath as a standard action. This creates a

15-foot cone of toxic and corrosive green vapor. Every crea-

ture in the area takes 1d10 points of acid damage (no saving

throw). The vapor is poisonous (Fortitude save DC 18). The

primary damage is paralysis (3d6 rounds); the secondary

damage is 3d6 Con. The vapor lingers for 2d6 rounds, deal-

ing acid damage and requiring a new saving throw each

round a creature remains within it or touches it. Vaporighus

are immune to their own poison breath and to that of others

of their kind.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate objects, enlarge, fly,

light, mislead, produce flame, sleep. Caster level 10th; save DC

10 + spell level.

Outsider Traits: A vaporighu has darkvision (60-

foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Summon Night Hag (Sp): Once per day, a

vaporighu can summon one night hag. This

ability functions like a summon monster VII

spell (caster level 10th).

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Because of its unusual talent for

detecting prey, a vaporighu retains its Dexterity bonus to AC

(if any) even when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked.

gangrenous rot and

drips with poisonous slime.

Long, tangled, and matted fur hangs in shaggy layers from

its forearms, back, belly, and stumplike legs, and its head is

topped with a pair of small horns. Where its mottled skin

is visible, veins of pulsing bile can be seen just beneath the

surface. Its breath comes and goes in enormous, wheezing

gurgles, punctuated by an occasional explosion of mucus.

A vaporighu reeks of all the decay and sulphurous stench

of Gehenna.

Vaporighus seem to perform no specific function in

Gehenna other than to waylay whatever is unfortunate

enough to cross their paths. They often pick out likely

hiding places near portals or the rare watering holes in

Gehenna and wait for victims to approach.

Vaporighus speak Abyssal and Infernal, but they usually

do not communicate.

COMBAT

Vaporighus are tenacious opponents. They fight without

subtlety or art, and they fight to the death.

Corrosive Slime (Ex): Vaporighus constantly exude a

mucuslike slime that contains a corrosive substance. A vapor-

ighus slam attack leaves behind a smear of slime. An oppo-

nents armor and clothing dissolve and become useless in 1

round unless the wearer succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 18).

Any weapon that strikes a vaporighu dissolves in 1 round

unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 18). Even on

a failed save, armor, clothing, or weapons can be saved by

washing, which requires a full-round action and at least 1 pint

of water or weak acid (such as wine) per item.

Fear Aura (Su): Anyone (except other vaporighus) who

sees a vaporighu within 30 feet must make a Will saving

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:34 PM  Page 199

opportunity (grapple bonus +30). If it gets a hold, it can

try to swallow in the next round. Alternatively, the wind-

ghost has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but the windghost is not considered grap-

pled). In either case, each successful grapple check it

makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willantimagic

field, dispel magic, spell turning. Caster

level 16th; save DC 14 + spell level.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A wind-

ghost can swallow a single creature

that is at least two size categories

smaller than itself by making a successful

grapple check (grapple bonus +30), provided it already has

that opponent in its mouth (see Improved Grab, above).

Once inside the windghost, the opponent takes 1d8+4

points of bludgeoning damage and 1d6+2 points of acid

damage per round from the monsters stomach. A successful

grapple check allows the swallowed

creature to climb out of the stomach

and return to the windghosts mouth,

where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed

creature can try to cut its way out with

either claws or a light piercing or slashing

weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the stomach

(AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to

permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, mus-

cular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed oppo-

nent must cut its own way out. A Huge windghosts stomach

can hold 1 Medium-size, 4 Small, 16 Tiny, or 64 Diminutive

or smaller opponents.

JJ

Windsong (Su): Two or more windghosts within 90 feet

of each other can emit a harmonizing sonic drone that

throws off the equilibrium of any creature that hears it. The

sound causes any creature within 120 feet (except wind-

ghosts ) that fails a Will save (DC 23) to take a 6 circum-

stance penalty on Concentration checks, a 8 enhancement

penalty to Dexterity, and move at half normal speed. These

penalties remain as long as the windghosts continue to sing.

A successful save renders a creature immune to that particu-

lar pair of windghosts windsong for 24 hours. Windghosts

can end a windsong at will.

Fast Healing (Ex): A windghost regains lost hit points at

the rate of 3 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit points

lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not

allow the windghost to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Flight (Ex): A windghost is naturally buoyant and can fly

(as the spell) as a free action at a speed of 30 feet.

Immunities (Ex): Windghosts are immune to air and

mind-affecting effects.

True Seeing (Su): A windghost sees all things as if

affected by true seeing (arcane version).

Mysterious observers that float casually through the skies,

windghosts are unfathomable creatures that inspire curi-

ousity, puzzlement, and sometimes fear.

The body of a windghost is conical. From top to base, it

measures 24 feet. At its base is a gaping, circular mouth, 8

feet across and lined with rows of teeth. Its body tapers up

to a rounded cap. A windghosts rough and mottled hide is

purplish gray in color, and it has milk-white eyes. The

windghost has two 20-foot tentacles dangling from either

side of its base. These appendages primarily serve to carry

items. A windghosts body and eyes sparkle with ripples of

blue and violet light. This light is strong enough to illumi-

nate the creatures form but makes it apppear ghostly, hence

its name.

Windghosts may appear frightening, but they are not

aggressive creatures. Nonetheless, their unexpected arrivals

and strange appearance often lead to unprovoked attacks

from frightened ground-dwellers.

Windghosts speak Auran.

COMBAT

Windghosts never attack without provocation. When

threatened, they surround themselves with magical protec-

tions before swooping down to physically attack. If facing

overpowering opponents, windghosts flee, flying straight

up until they are out of sight.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a windghost hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

The wyste (pronounced wist) is

an alien creature much like a giant

worm that inhabits fetid pools of

alien slime.

A  typical  specimen  is  2  feet  in

diameter and 25 feet long. A wystes

skin is translucent, showing strange, twisted

strands of pulsing organs underneath. The crea-

ture has no face, just a large sucker hole fringed by long,

claw-tipped tentacles. The tentacles allow the wyste to

feed and defend itself, and they also serve as sensory organs.

So far as is known, a wyste operates only by instinct and

lives to feed.

COMBAT

A wyste lunges up to 15 feet out of its slimy pools to attack

creatures that approach. Wystes in an area often attack as a

group; others nearby might be attracted by the commotion,

too. When a wyste kills a victim, it drags its prey away to be

consumed at leisure.

Bite (Ex): When a wyste grapples an opponent, its tenta-

cles draw the victim to its toothed sucker hole. On the

round after the wyste grabs, it makes a regular attack with

its bite (in lieu of any claw attacks), gaining a +4 bonus on

the attack roll (+11 melee). If the bite attack misses, the

wyste drops the character, who falls prone in front of the

creature. If the bite attack is successful, the victim takes

1d6+9 points of damage. The wyste can then deal bite

damage automatically every round. The victim can escape

by winning an opposed grapple check against the wyste,

making a successful Escape Artist check against the wystes

grapple check result, or by killing the wyste.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a wyste hits a Large or smaller

opponent with one or more tentacle attacks, it deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action with-

out provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +17,

plus a +2 bonus for each tentacle that hit beyond the first).

The wyste can make only one grapple attack per round, no

matter how many tentacles it devotes to the effort. If it gets

a hold, it has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

simply use its tentacles to hold the opponent (20 penalty

on grapple check, but the wyste is not considered grappled).

In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals damage for all

the tentacles used to hold the opponent.

Blindsight (Ex): A wyste is blind, but its tentacles are sen-

sory organs that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration. This

ability enables it to discern objects and creatures within 120

feet. A wyste usually does not need to make Spot or Listen

checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.

Challenge Rating: 4

Treasure: Standard plus staff (see below)

Alignment: Usually neutral evil

Advancement: By character class

Yak folk are humanoid yaks who walk about on their hind

legs, dress in fine clothing, and dabble in magic. They are

slightly smaller than minotaurs, but aside from a vague

resemblance they have little in common with those crea-

tures. Their shaggy fur is generally well groomed, and their

horns are often decorated with tassels or silver tips. Jewelry

is common, and they wear fine clothing of wool and silk. All

adult yak folk carry staffs that are often magical, and

most also arm themselves with falchions.

Yak folk live among remote mountain peaks and

valleys, inaccessible to all but the hardiest travelers

and explorers.

Yak folk speak Common.

COMBAT

Most yak folk use their falchions or staffs,

magical or otherwise, in combat.

Body Meld (Sp): Once per day a yak

folk can merge its body with that of a

humanoid or giant of Small to Large

size. Except where noted here, this

power functions like a magic jar

spell  heightened  to  9th

level  (caster  level  20th;

Will save DC 21 negates).

To use this ability, the yak

folk must touch the intended target

for 20 minutes without interruption (yak

folk usually restrain their victims while

using this ability). At the end of this

period, the target must make a Will save

to remain conscious. On a failed save, the

hosts mind becomes unconscious, and the

yak folk assumes control. There is no magic

jar per sethe yak folk physically merges

its body with the victims body without the

use of an intermediate vessel. Body meld lasts

until dispelled or dismissed.

The process works only on humans, elves, dwarves, half-

orcs, and any creature of the giant type. The yak folk shares

all the victims knowledge, memories, skills, feats, and

extraordinary abilities, but none of its spell-like or super-

natural abilities. The yak folk retains all of its own super-

natural and spell-like abilities. The merging does not shed

a magical aura (so a detect magic spell does not reveal it),

but a true seeing spell reveals the victims dual nature.

If the host body is slain, the yak folk dies with it. Separat-

ing the two bodies takes half as long as melding (10 min-

utes). The host regains consciousness 1d6 minutes after the

separation is complete.

Only characters who know the victim personally have

any chance to realize that something is wrong, by making a

Spot check opposed by the yak folks Disguise check (which

in this case represents how well the yak folk impersonates

its host).

Command Genie (Su): Once per day, a yak folk can

summon and command a janni of evil alignment, but it can

never have more than one janni under its control at one time.

The janni is a slave bound to serve until the second sunrise

after the summoning. The yak folk are greatly disliked by all

genies, but for reasons lost in antiquity, no genie can attack a

yak folk. Genies sometimes work to thwart the yak folks

plans or disrupt their lives in other, indirect ways, but even

this is done cautiously because the genies know that if they

antagonize the yak folk too much, the lives of enslaved jann

will only become worse and their tasks more onerous.

Use Staff (Ex): A yak folk can use

any magic staff. This ability is similar to

the Use Magic Device skill except that

it applies only to magic staffs and the

yak folk does not require a skill check.

The chance that any particular yak folk pos-

sesses a magic staff is equal to its Hit Dice  5%.

YAK FOLK SOCIETY

Yak folk settle in secluded mountain valleys,

creating realms that are sheltered from the

worst of natures abusehavens of green-

ery and life in the midst of barren, snow-

covered peaks. In these seemingly idyllic

hideaways, the yak folk rule over their human,

elf, or dwarf subjects with iron fists.

The yak folk, for all their learning

and culture, are enormously evil over-

lords. They care for their hapless subjects only to

the extent that a live serf is better than a dead one,

and keeping a serf alive is easier than working

oneself.

Outsiders stumbling into an enclave of yak folk

are usually surprised and pleased to find what

appears to be a utopia hidden in the mountains,

and the yak folk do all in their power to foster that image

until the strangers can be disarmed and enslaved.

Their cities consist of several thousand yak folk plus five

or six times as many enslaved minions. A city is surrounded

by smaller enclaves and tribal outposts.

YAK FOLK CHARACTERS

A yak folks favored class is sorcerer. Most yak folk leaders

are sorcerers or sorcerer/clerics. Yak folk clerics tend to ven-

erate chaotic and evil gods and often have access to the Evil

and Trickery domains.

A yak folk PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to

its class level + 7. Thus, a 1st-level yak folk sorcerer has an

ECL of 8 and is the equivalent of an 8th-level character.

YUGOLOTH

Possibly the greediest, most selfish beings in the Outer

Planes, yugoloths reign supreme among the evil outsiders

of the plane of Gehenna.

Yugoloths often act as mercenaries for demons, devils, and

other planar powers. They are enthusiastic bodyguards and sol-

diers because they take such glee in hurting others, but they

turn on their masters if the enemy makes them a better offer.

They also make good torturers, because they delight in misery.

The yugoloths are led by a yugoloth of surpassing power

known as the General of Gehenna, who rules with an iron

fistexactly as far as his reach extends. There is no widespread

or organized opposition to his rule, but yugoloths outside his

immediate sphere of influence have little hesitation about

acting independently. The General rules from the Crawling

City, a great metropolis supported by thousands of grafted-

together legs that slowly wanders the volcanic Gehennan land-

scape.

Whatever their form, yugoloths tend to have the smell of

brimstone around them. In their native form, they leave a

faint trail of ash unless they consciously choose not to.

Yugoloths speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal.

COMBAT

In general, yugoloths are focused combatants. They choose

one opponent out of a group and attack until it falls, then

move on to the next foe. They fight at a frantic pace, using

their best attacks and spell-like abilities right away, even if

theyre not sure what theyre facing.

All yugoloths have the following special abilities in common.

Outsider Traits: A yugoloth has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Summon Yugoloth (Sp): Most yugoloths can summon

others of their kind as though casting a summon monster

spell, but they have only a limited chance of success. Roll

d%: On a failure, no yugoloths answer the summons. Sum-

moned creatures remain for 1 hour, then return whence

they came. A yugoloth that is itself summoned cannot use

its own summon ability for 1 hour.

Yugoloth Traits: A yugoloth is immune to poison and

acid. It has cold, fire, and electricity resistance 20. Yugoloths

can communicate telepathically with any creature within

100 feet that has a language.

MARRAENOLOTH

The marraenoloths serve a specialized function, possibly the

most specialized of any of the yugoloths. They are the ferrymen

on the River Styx, somberly poling their ghastly crafts along

that sepulchral river and through all the horrid planes it visits.

These pallid humanoids are little more than skeletons

clothed in rotted robes and grave wrappings. Only their

red-glowing eyes show signs of life. Like all natives of

Gehenna, they are pitiless and mercenary. They can speak

any language, but they communicate with other mar-

raenoloths telepathically.

Only by remaining scrupulously neutral in their deal-

ings with all others do the marraenoloths retain the ability

to move freely throughout the evil-aligned Outer Planes.

They can move away from the River Styx, but

their skiffs cannot, and a marraenoloth seldom goes any-

where its boat cant take it.

Marraenoloths never carry cargo, only passengers. Pay-

ment must be made in advance and must be at least 100 gp

per passenger. Although marraenoloths seldom, if ever, get

lost on the labyrinthine channels of the Styx, there is a 15%

chance on any chartered journey that the boatman delivers

the passengers into an ambush, arranged and paid for by a

third party. Each additional 100 gp paid per passenger

reduces the chance by 5%.

Fear Gaze (Su): When a marraenoloth stares at a crea-

ture, the latter must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15)

or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting

fear effect.

downright surly.

the one it uses to wield a weapon. The weapon may be a

magic item but is never a specific weapon or one with a spe-

cial ability. A yagnoloth that possessed such a weapon would

be assassinated in short order by its underlings.

Arcanaloths can speak and write any language.

Combat

Combat

Arcanaloths are weak in melee, but they are powerful spell-

casters. In addition to all the usual powers of yugoloths,

arcanaloths have the following special abilities.

Partial Immunity to Spells: Mind-affecting spells have

no effect on arcanaloths.

Poison  (Ex):  An  arcanaloths  claws  are  coated  with

poison. It delivers this poison (Fortitude save DC 16) with

each successful claw attack. The initial and secondary

damage is the same (1 point of Strength damage).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdarkness, fly, heat metal,

invisibility (self only), magic missile, shapechange, telekinesis,

warp wood; 1/dayfear, major image. Caster level 12th; save

DC 13 + spell level.

Spells: An arcanaloth can cast arcane spells as a 12th-level

sorcerer (spells known 9/5/5/4/3/2/1; spells/day 6/7/7/

7/6/5/3; save DC 13 + spell level, or 15 + spell level for Abju-

ration spells).

Summon Yugoloth (Sp): Once per day, an arcanaloth can

summon another arcanaloth with a 40% chance of success.

YAGNOLOTH

In the simplistic feudal hierarchy of Gehenna, yagnoloths

are minor lords. Each rules over a territory, with vassal

yugoloths at its beck and call. The rationale behind this

arrangement is not clear, since yagnoloths are neither

stronger nor brighter than many of their subjects. What-

ever the reason, the ruling powers of Gehenna enforce the

existing order, and the yagnoloths profit from it.

In fact, the yagnoloths squeeze every advantage possible

from their positions, up to and including sanctioning exe-

cutions of yugoloths that are considerably more physically

and magically powerful than themselves, but lower in the

hierarchy. Such actions are little different from what any

yugoloth would do if given the opportunity. Nonetheless,

the fact that the yagnoloths authority exceeds their per-

sonal power has earned them a special sort of resentment.

No other yugoloth can pass up an opportunity to betray its

yagnoloth overlordfor the right price.

As a secondary effect of their despised status, yagnoloths

cannot summon other yugoloths.

A yagnoloth is humanoid and stands 10 to 15 feet tall. Its

hide is red and scaly; its head is small and skeletal and

topped by ears resembling bats wings. A yagnoloths favored

arm is enormous, thickly knotted with muscles, and long

enough to drag on the ground. It uses this arm for its claw

attack. The other arm appears small in comparison and is

about the size of a normal human arm. This arm is always

A yagnoloth always attacks with both arms in melee. It wields

a greataxe or greatsword with its smaller arm, but that arm is

fairly weak (Str 10) and the yagnoloth does not receive any

Strength bonus when using it.

Breath Weapon (Su): As a standard action, a yagnoloth

can exhale a cloud of acid every 1d4 rounds. This cloud

affects a single 5-foot cone for 1 round. A character in that

space must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 19); failure

means the character takes 2d6 points of acid damage and is

stunned for an equal number of rounds.

Energy Drain (Su): The truly horrific power of the yag-

noloth is its ability to drain life force. The victim must be

unconscious or stunned. The yagnoloth places its head

against the victims flesh. For each full round the yagnoloth

remains in contact, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels. The

Fortitude save DC to remove each negative level is 18.

Shocking Grasp (Sp): A yagnoloth can use this ability three

times per day, causing 1d8+10 points of electricity damage

each time. Caster level 10th.

Stunning Blow (Ex): Any character struck by a yag-

noloths massive arm must make a Fortitude saving (DC 25)

to avoid being stunned for a number of rounds equal to the

points of damage dealt by the blow.

Muscular Arm (Ex): A yagnaloths larger arm functions

as a primary natural weapon, even when it is used to make

secondary attacks. This ability negates any secondary attack

penalty and allows the yagnaloth its full Strength bonus

with its claw, whether the attack is primary or secondary.

APPENDIX: TEMPLATES

A templated creature is created by adding a template to an

existing creature. The following rules set out the procedures

for building a templated creature, such as a death knight.

Sometimes a template changes a creatures type. In such

a case, the creature gains the vulnerabilities and immuni-

ties of the new type. All other characteristics, including

Hit Die size, base attack bonus, base saves, feats, and skills,

remain unchanged unless otherwise indicated in the tem-

plate description.

The ability score adjustments associated with a template

cannot reduce any of a creatures ability scores below 1,

unless otherwise noted.

CAPTURED ONE

A captured one is a living creature that is under the control

of a raggamoffyn. The raggamoffyn has access to its hosts

memories and draws on its hosts experiences. The captured

Captured ones speak Common and what-

ever languages the base creature speaks.

CREATING A CAPTURED ONE

Captured one is a template that

can be added to a giant, humanoid,

monstrous humanoid, animal, beast,

or vermin (hereafter known as

the base creature) that is the

same size as or smaller than

the  dominating  ragga-

moffyn.  The  creatures

type changes to construct.

Both the raggamoffyns and

the base creatures statistics

and special abilities are modified

as noted here.

Hit  Dice: A  captured

one maintains separate hit

point totals for each of its

two parts.

Initiative:  Same  as

raggamoffyn.

Abilities: A captured one uses the Constitution, Intelli-

gence, and Charisma scores of the base creature and the

Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom scores of the raggamoffyn.

Special Attacks: The raggamoffyn gains control over all

special attacks that the base creature possesses, including

spells and spell-like abilities. The raggamoffyns wrap and

improved grab special attacks are unavailable while it con-

trols the host.

Special Qualities: Both the raggamoffyn and the base

creature retain any special qualities they had previously.

Construct Traits: A captured one is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects. The creature is not subject

to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. The raggamoffyn

portion cannot heal itself but can be healed through repair; the

base creature portion heals normally. It cannot be raised or

resurrected. A captured one has darkvision (60-foot range).

Senses (Ex): The raggamoffyn sees and hears everything

that the base creature is able to.

Shared Damage (Ex): An attack on a captured one deals half

its damage to the raggamoffyn and half to the dominated

creature.

Saves: A captured one uses the raggamoffyns base Forti-

tude, Reflex, and Will saves.

nent heals normally. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A cap-

tured one bugbear has darkvision (60-foot range).

Senses: Both components of the captured one bugbear

see and hear everything the bugbear can.

bear deals half its damage (rounded down) to the ragga-

moffyn and half (rounded up) to the bugbear.

CHIMERIC CREATURE

Chimeric creatures are hybrids that combine the traits of a

monstrous goat and a chromatic dragon with those of a third

creature, which must be an animal, beast, or vermin.

A chimeric creature has at least three heads. The goat head

sits to the right of the other heads. It has glowing amber eyes

and long ochre horns. The scaly dragon head sits to the left

and has black eyes. The dragon scales of a chimeric creature

may be black, blue, green, red, or white. The central head of a

chimeric creature is the head of the third creature. A chimeric

creature has the hindquarters of a black goat, the wings of a

dragon, and the forequarters of the third creature. The Monster

Manual describes one chimeric creature, the chimera.

Chimeric creatures speak Draconic.

CREATING A CHIMERIC CREATURE

Chimeric is a template that can be added to any Medium-

size, Large, or Huge animal, beast, or vermin (referred to

hereafter as the base creature). The creatures type changes to

magical beast. It uses all the base creatures statistics and

special abilities except as noted

here. Adding the chimeric tem-

plate  to  a  lion  results  in  a

chimera as described in the

Monster Manual. (That mon-

ster is considered to already have

the  chimeric  template.)

Hit Dice: Increased to

d10.  Use  the  base  crea-

tures Hit Dice or 9 Hit Dice,

whichever is higher.

Speed: Same as base crea-

ture, but chimeric creatures

gain wings and can fly at a speed

of 50 feet (poor).

AC: Base creatures natural armor

bonus improves by +6.

Attacks  and  Damage:  A

chimeric creature retains all

the attacks of the base creature

and also gains a bite attack for

2d6 points of damage from its

dragon head and a butt attack

for 1d8 points of damage from

its goat head.

206

Whichever natural weapon has the highest base damage

becomes its primary attack. If two natural weapons have the

same base damage, the one that also delivers a special attack

(such as poison) is primary. If a tie still exists, choose one of

the tied attacks to be primary for that creature.

Special Attacks: A chimeric creature retains all the spe-

cial attacks of the base creature and also gains a breath

weapon based on its dragon variety.

Breath Weapon (Su): Every 1d4 rounds, a chimeric crea-

tures dragon head can use a breath weapon that deals 3d8

points of damage. Anyone in the area can make a Reflex save

for half (DC 10 + 1/2 chimeric creatures Hit Dice + chimeric

creaures Constitution modifier). Use all rules for dragon

breath (see the Dragon entry in this book), except as speci-

fied in the table below.

To determine the head color and breath weapon ran-

domly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.

Skills: A chimeric creatures three heads give it a +2 racial

bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Feats: A chimeric creature gains Multi-

had 9 or more Hit Dice; other-

wise 1018 (same size category);

Sample Chimeric Creature

Here is a sample chimeric crea-

ture using an ankheg as the base

creature and a white dragon head.

Skills: Climb +11, Listen +9, Spot +3

Feats: Multiattack (B)

Climate/Terrain: Temperate and warm forest, plains, and

underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, or cluster (34)

Challenge Rating: 9

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always chaotic evil

Advancement: 1018 HD (Large); 1927 HD (Huge)

Acid (Ex): Acidic enzymes drip from the mouth of the

ankheg head each round it maintains a hold on a grabbed

creature. The acid automatically deals 1d4 points of acid

damage each round.

Breath Weapon (Su): A chimeric ankhegs dragon head

can emit a 20-foot cone of cold that deals 3d8 points of cold

damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).

Improved Grab (Ex): If a chimeric ankheg hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with

its ankheg bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +17). If it gets a hold, it

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use its jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the chimeric ankheg is not considered grappled).

In either case, each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals bite and acid

damage. If the chimeric ankheg is damaged after grabbing

its prey, it retreats backward down its tunnel at its burrow

speed, dragging the victim with it.

Scent (Ex): A chimeric ankheg can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Spit Acid (Ex): A chimeric ankheg can spit a line of acid 5

feet high, 5 feet wide, and 30 feet long. Any creature hit by this

attack takes 4d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).

One such attack depletes the chimeric ankhegs acid supply

for 6 hours. It cannot spit acid or deal acid damage with its bite

during this time. Chimeric ankhegs do not use this ability

unless they are desperate or frustrated. They most often spit

acid when reduced to fewer than half of their hit points or

when they have not successfully grabbed an opponent.

Tremorsense (Ex): A chimeric ankheg can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

DEATH KNIGHT

Gods of death create death knights. They are martial cham-

pions of evil. These horrible undead are most commonly

raised from the ranks of blackguards, fighters, rangers, and

barbarians; but a paladin who falls from grace near the

moment of death may also become a death knight. Paladins

who become death knights are subject to the same modifi-

cations as are presented for the blackguard in Chapter 2 of

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

A death knights physical form is that of its decayed body.

The face is a blackened skull covered with patches of rotting

flesh, with two pinpoints of orange light in the eye sockets.

The voice of a death knight is chilling, seeming to echo

from deep within. Death knights were powerful people in

life, and so they often wear expensive or magic clothing and

armor. They are quite fond of wearing flowing capes to mark

them as figures of importance.

Death knights speak the languages they knew in life.

CREATING A DEATH KNIGHT

Death knight is a template that can be added to any evil

humanoid creature of 6th level or higher (referred to here-

after as the character). The characters type changes to

undead. It uses all the characters statistics and special abili-

ties except as noted here.

Hit Dice: All the characters Hit Dice (current and future)

become d12s.

Speed: Same as the character.

AC: The death knight has +5 natural armor, or the charac-

ters natural armor, whichever is better.

Attacks: Death knights usually fight with martial

weapons, but if disarmed they will use a touch attack.

Damage: The death knights touch attack uses negative

energy to deal damage equal to 1d8 + the death knights

Charisma bonus to living creatures. Each successful touch

attack also deals 1 point of Constitution damage. A Will save

(DC 10 + 1/2 death knights HD + death knights Charisma

modifier) reduces the damage by half and negates the Consti-

tution damage. Characters with natural attacks can use their

natural weaponry or use the touch attack, as they prefer.

Special Attacks: A death knight retains all the characters

special attacks and gains those described below.

Abyssal Blast (Su): Once per day, a death knight can unleash

a blast of eldritch fire. The blast fills a 20-foot-radius spread

anywhere within a range of 400 feet + 40 feet per HD of the

death knight. The blast deals 1d6 points of damage per HD of

the death knight (maximum 20d6). Half of the damage is

fire damage, but the rest results directly from divine power

and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection

from elements (fire), fire shield (chill shield), or similar magic. A

Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 death knights HD + death knights

Charisma modifier) reduces the damage by half.

Fear Aura (Su): Death knights are shrouded in a dreadful

aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD within 15

feet of a death knight must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 death knights HD + death knights Charisma modifier)

or be affected as though by a fear spell cast by a sorcerer of

the death knights level.

Undead Followers: A death knight attracts lesser undead

creatures that happen to exist within a 200-mile radius. It may

have up to twice its levels in Hit Dice of followers. The fol-

lowers arrive monthly in the following increments: 1d6

ghouls, 1d4 ghasts, 1d12 medium skeletons, 1d4 wights, or

1d8 medium zombies once per week. These creatures remain

in the service of the death knight until destroyed. These crea-

tures are in addition to any undead creatures the death knight

might be able to command or rebuke as a class ability.

Spells: A death knight can cast any spells it could while

alive, unless alignment restrictions prohibit the casting of a

particular spell.

Special Qualities: A death knight retains all the char-

acters special qualities and gains those described below.

Damage Reduction (Su): A death knights undead body is

tough, giving the creature damage reduction 15/+1.

Immunities (Ex): Death knights are immune to cold, elec-

tricity, and polymorph in addition to those immunities

possessed by undead (see undead traits, below).

Spell Resistance (Su): A death knight gains spell resist-

ance 20 +1 per characters level beyond 10th.

Summon Mount (Su): A death knight

has the ability to summon a mount, typi-

cally a nightmare, though it may be of

any  other  species  normally

used as a mount. The mount

may have no more Hit Dice than

half the death knights levels. If the

mount is lost or killed, the death knight

may summon another one after a year

and a day.

Turn Immunity (Ex): A death knight

cannot be turned. It can be banished

with holy word, however, just as if it were

an evil outsider. (The banished death

knight returns to the plane of

the evil god it serves.)

Undead  Traits: A  death

knight is immune to mind-

affecting  effects,  poison,

sleep,  paralysis,  stunning,

disease, death effects, necro-

mantic  effects,  and  any

effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on

objects. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, abil-

ity damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from mas-

sive damage. A death knight cannot be raised, and resurrec-

tion works only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision

(60-foot range).

Saves: Same as character.

Abilities: A death knight gains +4 to Strength and +2 to

both Wisdom and Charisma. Being undead, it has no Con-

stitution score.

Skills: Same as character.

Feats: Same as character.

Climate/ Terrain: Any land and underground.

Organization: Solitary or troupe (see undead followers,

above).

Challenge Rating: Same as character +3.

Treasure: Double standard.

Alignment: Same as character (always evil).

Advancement: Death knights continue to advance in

level as per their original class.

DEATH KNIGHT CHARACTERS

A death knight PCs effective character level (ECL) is

equal to the creatures character level +5; thus, a 7th-level

fighter/3rd-level blackguard death knight has an ECL of

15 and is the equivalent of a 15th-level character.

A character with the ability to spontaneously cast cure

spells who becomes a death knight loses that ability, but gains

the ability to spontaneously cast inflict spells.

Here is a sample death knight that

uses a human fighter/blackguard as

the character.

HALF-GOLEM

Half-golems are the results of good-intentioned actions taken

too far. While the application of a poultice infused with cura-

tive herbs or the casting of a spell can save the life of an

injured or diseased person, only powerful magic can replace a

missing limb. Such magic is often beyond the reach of the

ordinary person working in a quarry or a mill, or scything a

field of grain, who suffers the loss of one or more limbs.

Arcane artisans applied their knowledge of golem con-

struction to come up with a way to restore such a person to

wholeness. While the initial results were promising, there

was a limit to the effectiveness of the techniquemany

people who received one or more new limbs through this

process proved unable to withstand the trauma of the trans-

formation and became permanently evil as a result. Indi-

viduals of evil intent now exploit this limitation, purposely

creating ravening, unholy crosses between living beings

and golems.

CONSTRUCTION

There are two steps to making a half-golem. The first is con-

structing the limbs, and the second is attaching the limbs.

Molding a limb from clay, preparing one made of flesh,

carving it from stone, or forging it from iron requires an

appropriate skill (see the specific half-golem descriptions

for details) and can be done by anyone. Infusing a formed

limb with magic requires the Craft Wondrous Item and

Craft Magic Arms and Armor feats. It takes one month to

complete the magical rituals. The creator must labor for at

least 8 hours each day in a specially prepared laboratory or

workroom. The chamber is similar to an alchemists labora-

tory and costs 500 gp to establish.

When not working on the rituals, the creator must rest

and can perform no other activities, just as if he or she were

creating a golem. As with a golem, if the creator is personally

constructing the limbs, he or she can perform the building

and the rituals together.

Once created, the limbs are treated as spell completion

items. Any character capable of casting the appropriate

level of spell (see specific descriptions) can attach a limb.

All thats left to do is perform the final gestures and speak

the words needed to imbue the limb with magic. All the

limbs to be attached to a particular body must be of the

same typeits not possible, for instance, to attach a limb

made of iron to a half-golem that already has a new limb

made of stone. Any such attempt automatically fails, leav-

ing the second type of limb unattached.

The Danger

Each time a limb is attached to his or her body, the recipient

makes a Will save. The DC of the save varies according to the

number of new limbs the character has received.

First new limb

Second new limb

Third new limb

Fourth new limb

Fifth new limb

A character who succeeds at all the saves he or she is required

to make takes on the attributes of a half-golem as described

belowexcept that the character retains his or her align-

ment, gains a +4 bonus to Constitution, and does not change

type or gain construct traits. As soon as the character fails one

of these required saves, he or she becomes a half-golem of

neutral evil alignment. The character then has no Constitu-

tion score and the characters type changes to construct,

granting him or her construct traits. A neutral evil half-golem

retains the memories and knowledge of its former life, but its

personality becomes murderous and cruel. It demonstrates

the hatred of flesh creatures common to elementals, and it

seeks methods appropriate to its class to slaughter as many

flesh creatures as possible.

Skills: Same as character, modified by new ability modi-

fiers. The drop in Intelligence does not retroactively remove

skill points spent.

CREATING A HALF-GOLEM

Half-golem is a template that can be added to any animal,

beast, giant, humanoid creature, magical beast, or monstrous

humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). There is no

minimum level or Hit Dice requirement to become a half-

golem. The characters type changes

to construct once a Will save is

failed. Each half-golem takes on the

characteristics of a particular type of

golem (flesh, clay, stone, or iron) as

described later in this section.

A half-golems abilities are prima-

rily those of the character, with the

following exceptions.

Hit Dice: Same as character.

Initiative: Same as character 1,

to account for the half-golems

reduced Dexterity (see Abilities,

below).

Speed: Same as character, but a

half-golem cannot run.

AC: A half-golem replaces any

natural armor bonus it may have

had  with  a  new  natural  armor

bonus that varies according to

its type (see the table below).

The change to Dexterity (see

Abilities, below) also affects

the half-golems Armor Class.

Attacks: Same as character.

Damage: Same as character.

Face/Reach: Same as character.

Special Attacks: Same as char-

acter (and see the table below).

Special Qualities: Same as character; plus construct

traits (upon a failed Will save), damage resistance (see table

below), and others by type (see table below).

Saves: A half-golem gains a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude

saves; otherwise same as character.

Abilities: Half-golems have 2 Dex, +4 Con (or no Con

upon  a  failed  Will  save),  6  Int,  +0  Wis,  and  6  Cha.

Strength varies by type (see the table below). The number of

limbs attached does not alter a half-golems Strength score.

Common Half-Golems

Feats: Same as character.

Climate/Terrain: Same as character.

Organization: Solitary, pair, or squad (520).

Challenge Rating: Same as character +3.

Treasure: Standard.

Alignment: Same as character (if all Will saves succeed)

or always neutral evil (if any Will save fails).

Advancement: By character class.

COMBAT

A half-golem fights as the character

from  which  it  is  created.  Half-

golems are usually straightfor-

ward, unsubtle combatants that

rely on their great strength to

win  the  day.  They  rarely  use

teamwork  or  cooperation,

even when banded together.

Construct Traits: A half-

golem  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and

any effect that requires a Forti-

tude save unless it also works on

objects. The creature is not subject

to critical hits, subdual damage,

ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from mas-

sive damage. It cannot heal itself

but can be healed through repair. It cannot be

raised or resurrected. A half-golem has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

Magic Immunity (Ex): Half-golems completely

resist all magical and supernatural effects, except as noted in

the appropriate golem descriptions (see Monster Manual).

HALF-GOLEM CHARACTERS

Half-golem characters are shunned by society, so they either

seek revenge against the world around them or retreat from

it. Those who seek revenge generally become fighters or

rogues. Those who retreat from it become barbarians,

rangers, or druids. A rare few become, or remain, evil clerics.

SAMPLE HALF-GOLEMS

FLESH HALF-GOLEM

Examples of four half-golems, each using a 1st-level half-orc

fighter who has failed a Will save (see The Danger) as the

character, are provided here.

A half-golem looks like a bizarre and horrifying melding

of a golem and the character it once was. The materials of its

golem limbs twine and crawl across its flesh, like ivy growing

across a building or tree. In many cases, a half-golems flesh

is horribly scarred and has the pale gray color of death. Half-

golems speak whatever languages they spoke before their

transformations, but their voices are harsh and strangled.

A flesh half-golem is a tortured soul whose replacement

limbs were stolen from the dead. Flesh golems replace-

ment limbs are rudely stitched to their bodies and may

have different skin color or texture from the rest of the

characters skin.

Berserk (Ex): A flesh half-golem that takes damage in

combat flies into a berserk rage the following round,

attacking wildly until either it or its opponent is dead. It

gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and 2 AC. A flesh half-

golem cannot end its berserk state voluntarily. If the flesh

half-golem is a barbarian, the bonuses and the penalty are

cumulative with the barbarian rage class feature.

Construction

The pieces of a flesh golem must come from corpses of the

same size and type as the recipient (for instance, a Medium-

size humanoid character can not use Small animal limbs). The

limbs must not have decayed significantly. Construction of

the limb requires a successful Craft (leatherworking) or

Heal check (DC 20). The rituals cost 10,000 gp and 200 XP

and require bulls strength and geas/quest. Attaching the limb

requires the ability to cast 6th-level arcane spells.

CLAY HALF-GOLEM

A clay half-golem has a grotesquely dis-

torted musculature, such as an over-

large chest, arms attached by thick

knots of muscle at the shoulder,

stubby fingers, or arms that hang

almost to the ground. Its features

often  appear  partially  melted.

Typically it drips bits of clay, and

its  slimy  replacement  flesh

coats its weapons.

Berserk (Ex): A clay half-

golem that takes damage in

combat  flies  into  a  berserk

rage  the  following  round,

attacking wildly until either it

or its opponent is dead. It gains +4

Strength, +4 Constitution, and 2

AC. A clay half-golem cannot end its

berserk state voluntarily. If the

clay half-golem is a barbarian, the

bonuses and the penalty are cumulative

with the barbarian rage class feature.

Wound  (Ex): The  damage  a

clay half-golem deals doesnt

heal naturally. Only a spell of 6th level or higher with

the healing descriptor (such as heal) can repair it.

Haste (Su): After it has engaged in at least 1 round of

combat on a given day, a clay half-golem can use haste upon

itself once during that day as a free action. The effect lasts 3

rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.

Immunity to Slashing and Piercing (Ex): Slashing and

piercing weapons, whether normal or magical, deal no

damage to a clay half-golem.

STONE HALF-GOLEM

A stone half-golem drags thick limbs of roughly chiseled

stone, stylized to suit its creator. For example, one might

appear armored, have a particular symbol carved on it, or

have designs worked into it. The limbs may be of different

types of stone.

Slow (Su): A stone golem can use slow as a free action

once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a

duration of 7 rounds, requiring a successful Will save (DC

13) to negate. The ability is otherwise the same as the spell.

Construction

A stone limb must be chiseled from a single block of stone

weighing at least 300 pounds. The carving requires a suc-

cessful Craft (stoneworking) check (DC 20). The ritu-

als cost 16,000 gp and 320 XP

and require geas/quest and stone

to  flesh. Attaching  the  limb

requires the ability to cast

6th-level arcane spells.

IRON HALF-GOLEM

The  limbs  of  an  iron  half-

golem appear bolted or riveted to the

flesh. Irregular and haphazard iron

plates join flesh and metal limbs.

The limbs can be fashioned in any

manner, just like those of a stone

half-golem, although they usually

appear armored. They are much

smoother than those of a stone

half-golem.

Breath Weapon (Su): As a

free action, an iron half-golem

can emit a cloud of poisonous

gas from its limbs in a 10-foot

cone directly in front of it. The

cloud lasts 1 round, and the limbs

can  emit  another  cloud  every

1d4+1 rounds. The initial damage

is 1d4 points of Constitution damage, and the secondary

damage is death. A Fortitude save (DC 10+ 1/2 the iron half-

golems Hit Dice + the iron half-golems Constitution modi-

fier) negates both effects.

Rust Vulnerability (Ex): An iron half-golem is affected

by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting

grasp spell.

Construction

Construction

A clay limb must be sculpted from a single block of clay

weighing at least 100 pounds. The sculpting requires a suc-

cessful Craft (sculpting) or Profession (mason) check (DC

20). The rituals cost 12,000 gp and 240 XP and require ani-

mate objects and geas/quest. Attaching the limb requires the

ability to cast 6th-level divine spells.

An iron limb is sculpted from 500 pounds of pure iron. The

sculpting requires a successful Craft (armorsmithing) or

Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 20). The rituals cost

20,000 gp and 400 XP and require cloudkill and geas/quest.

Attaching the limb requires the ability to cast 6th-level

arcane spells.

MONSTER OF LEGEND

A monster of legend is a creature chosen by a god to per-

form an appointed task. The creature is imbued with

divine abilities and great strength to better accomplish its

goal. A monster of legend is a unique creature and consid-

ered to be an archetype for creatures of the same kind.

These divinely enhanced creatures are often set to guard

artifacts or planar portals.

Monsters of legend are highly dangerous creatures. They

are stronger, tougher, and fiercer than their normally

encountered kin. Most have potent attack forms and special

qualities that mark them as having been touched by divine

forces.  Monsters  of  legend  are  rarely  encountered  by

chance. They leave their lairs only

when on divine missions or when

exacting revenge on those who

threaten their divine missions.

CREATING A MONSTER

OF LEGEND

Monster of legend

is  a  template  that

can be added to any

animal, beast, magi-

cal  beast,  or  mon-

strous humanoid (hereafter

referred to as the base creature). The

creatures type changes to outsider,

though  the  monster  of  legends

home plane is the Material Plane.

It has all the base creatures attrib-

utes except as noted here.

Hit Dice: All the base crea-

tures Hit Dice increase to d8s

(if smaller than d8, other-

wise same as base creature).

Speed:  Same  as  base

creature.

AC: Base creatures natu-

ral armor bonus improves

by +5.

Attacks: Same as base creature.

Damage: Same as base creature or as indicated on the

MC

table below, whichever is greater.

Special Attacks: A monster of legend retains the base

creatures extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abili-

ties. In addition, it gains one of the following special attacks.

Breath Weapon (Su): Every 1d4 rounds, the monster of

legend can use a breath weapon (15-foot cone, 3d6 damage).

Choose one of the following energy types: acid, fire, light-

ning, or cold. A target can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2

monster of legends Hit Dice + monster of legends Consti-

tution modifier) for half damage.

Frightful Presence (Ex): When a monster of legend makes a

loud sound (a roar, growl, or other sound appropriate to its

form), it inspires terror in all creatures within 20 feet that

have fewer Hit Dice or levels than it has. Each potentially

affected opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2

monster of legends Hit Dice

+ monster of legends Cha-

risma modifier) or become

shakena condition that

lasts until the opponent is

out of range. A successful

save leaves that opponent

immune to that monster

of  legends  frightful

presence for 24 hours.

Poison (Ex): A mon-

ster of legend delivers

its poison  with each suc-

cessful bite attack. A target

that succeeds at a Fortitude save

(DC  10  +  1/2  the  monster  of

legends Hit Dice + the monster

of legends Constitution modi-

fier)  does  not  take  poison

damage from that particular

attack. The initial and second-

ary damage is the same: 1d6

points of Strength damage.

Raging  Blood  (Su):

Choose whether the mon-

ster  of  legend  has  acid,

fire, or electricity in its

blood. Each time damage

is dealt to the creature with

a piercing or slashing attack, its blood sprays outward in a 5-

foot cone, dealing 1d4 points of damage of the selected

energy type to all within range (no saving throw). A mon-

ster of legend is not harmed by its own blood.

Spells: The monster of legend casts divine spells from the

cleric list and from the Protection, Strength, and War

domains as a 5th-level cleric (save DC 10 + spell level + the

monster of legends Wisdom modifier). It does not gain

extra domain spell slots for these domains as a cleric would.

Special Qualities: A monster of legend retains the base

creatures extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities.

In addition, it gains two of the following special qualities.

Damage Reduction (Su): 10/+1.

Enhanced Attributes (Ex): The save DC for each of the mon-

ster of legends special attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities

increases by +4.

Fast Healing (Ex): A monster of legend regains lost hit

points at the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow the monster of legend to regrow or

reattach lost body parts.

Greater Damage (Ex): Damage dice for the creatures natural

attacks are increased by one die type, as indicated on the

table below.

Immunities (Ex): The creature is immune to two of the fol-

lowing effects: acid, electricity, fear, poison, polymorphing,

or mind-affecting effects.

Reflective Hide (Su): The creature has a silvery sheen to its

skin and is permanently protected by a spell turning effect.

Regrow Limbs (Ex): If the creature loses a limb, head, or

body part, a new one grows in 1 round. A monster of legend

with this ability cannot be slain by a vorpal weapons head-

severing ability.

See in Darkness (Su): The creature can see perfectly in dark-

ness of any kind, even that created by deeper darkness spells.

Spell Resistance (Su): The creature has spell resistance

equal to 10 + 1/2 monster of legends Hit Dice.

Subtype (Ex): The creature has one of the following sub-

types: cold or fire.

Saves: Each of the base creatures base saves increases

by +3.

Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str

+10, Dex +6, Con +10, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4.

Skills: A monster of legend has skill points as the base

creature, adjusted for its increased Intelligence score. Its

class skills are as the base creature.

Multiattack as bonus feats.

Climate/Terrain: Same as base creature.

Organization: Same as base creature.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +2.

Treasure: Same as base creature.

Alignment: Same as base creature.

Advancement: Same as base creature.

Breath Weapon (Su): Every 1d4 rounds, the minotaur of

legend can breathe a 15-foot cone of fire that deals 3d6

points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half ).

Charge (Ex): A minotaur of legend typically begins a

battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to

bring  its  mighty  horns  into  play.  In  addition  to  the

normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the

creature to make a single gore attack that deals 4d6+13

points of damage.

Immunities (Ex): A minotaur of legend is immune to

acid and mind-affecting effects.

Natural Cunning (Ex): Although a minotaur of legend is

it from ever becoming lost, and enables it to track enemies.

Further, the creature is never caught flat-footed.

Outsider Traits: A minotaur of legend has darkvision

(60-foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

SPELLSTITCHED

Spellstitched creatures are undead creatures that have been

powerfully enhanced and fortified by arcane means. The

undead gain the ability to cast spells, can resist being turned,

and become more difficult to attack in melee. The process

benefits undead with intelligence far more than it helps

those that are mindless, since intelligent undead can dis-

charge their spells tactically.

The outward sign that an undead creature has been spell-

stitched is its rune-covered body. The runes are carved into

the bones of skeletal undead or tattooed on the rotting flesh

of other corporeal undead. These runes may not be immedi-

ately noticeable to an observer, appearing to be cracks in

bones or wrinkles in the skin.

Spellstitched creatures can be created only by a wizard or

sorcerer of sufficient level to cast the spells to be imbued in

the undeads body. The process for creating a spellstitched

creature requires the expenditure of 1,000 gp for carving or

tattooing materials as well as 500 XP for every point of

Wisdom that the undead creature possesses. Undead

that are spellcasters can spellstitch themselves.

CREATING A SPELLSTITCHED CREATURE

Spellstitched is a template that can be added to any

corporeal undead (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

The template uses all the base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Special Attacks: A spellstitched creature retains all the

special attacks of the base creature and gains the following

special attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: A spellstitched creature with a Wisdom

score of 10 or higher can be imbued with spell-like abilities.

All spells selected must be from the schools of Conjuration,

Evocation, or Necromancy. These abilities are used as if the

spells were cast by a sorcerer of the same level as the number

of Hit Dice the spellstitched creature possesses.

Spells Known is the number of different spells the creature

has access to as spell-like abilities. A creature with a Wisdom

score higher than 10 gains the spells from the row on the

table corresponding to its Wisdom score, and the spells

from all the rows above that row.

Times/Day is the number of times per day that the crea-

ture can use spell-like abilities of a given level. The creator

of the creature must decide how to allocate the spells

known. Once this determination has been made for a par-

ticular ability, it cannot be changed. For instance, the

sample spellstitched creature has magic missile and obscuring

:

mist as its 1st-level spell-

like abilities. It can use magic

missile three times per day and obscuring

mist once per day. The creator cannot later change either the

spells or the times per day each can be used.

Special Qualities: A spellstitched creature retains all the

special qualities of the base creature and gains the following

special qualities.

Damage Reduction: A spellstitched creature with 13 HD

has no damage reduction. One with 47 HD has DR 5/+1;

one with 811 HD has DR 5/+2; and one with 12 or more

HD has DR 10/+3.

Spell Resistance: A spellstitched creature has spell resist-

ance equal to 15 + base creatures Charisma bonus.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A spellstitched creature has +2 turn

resistance. This value is added to the base creatures turn

resistance (if any).

If the base creature already has one or more of these spe-

cial qualities, use the better value.

Saves: Same as base creature +2.

Abilities: Same as base creature.

tude save (DC 15) or be para-

lyzed  for  1d6+4  minutes.

Even elves are vulnerable to

this paralysis.

Stench  (Ex):  The  stink  of

death  and  corruption  sur-

rounding these creatures is

sickening.  Each  creature

within 10 feet must succeed

at a Fortitude save (DC 15)

or be wracked with nausea,

taking  a  2  circumstance

penalty on all attack rolls,

Create Spawn (Su): Humanoid victims of a spellstitched

ghast that are not devoured by the creature rise as ghasts

(not spellstiched ghasts) in 1d4 days.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A spellstitched ghast is treated as

an undead with 8 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, rebuke,

command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A spellstitched ghast is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A spell-

stitched ghast cannot be raised, and resurrection works only

if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

TAURIC

A tauric creature is a hybrid being possessing the head, arms,

and upper torso of a humanoid, and the legs and lower body

of an animal, beast, or vermin. Some are created as the result

of magical experiments or as divine punishment for failing

their deities. Tauric creatures of the same kind form a unique

race with its own culture, language, and religion. Tauric crea-

tures are not to be confused with two-legged humanoid/crea-

ture hybrids such as the minotaur or the satyr, which have dif-

ferent traits from their apparent component creatures.

Tauric creatures speak the languages of both of their com-

ponent creatures, as well as any language they have devel-

oped as a people.

CREATING A TAURIC

CREATURE

Tauric is a template that combines

two creatures into one hybrid crea-

ture. The template can be added to

any Small or Medium-size corpo-

real humanoid (referred to here-

after as the base humanoid) and

any Medium-size or Large cor-

poreal animal, beast, or vermin

with at least four legs (referred

to hereafter as the base crea-

ture). A tauric creatures type

changes to monstrous human-

oid. It otherwise uses all the base

creatures attributes and special

abilities except as noted below.

Size: Same as base creature.

Hit Dice: Add the base humanoids

and base creatures Hit Dice to get

the tauric creatures Hit Dice, each

of which changes to a d8. A hu-

manoid that normally has a class

instead of 1 Hit Die counts as a 1-

HD creature.

620_88268 MonsterManual2.qxd  7/29/02  3:36 PM  Page 217

AC: A tauric creature has the natural armor bonus of

the base creature or the base humanoid, whichever is better.

Attacks and Damage: A tauric creature retains the natural

weapons and base damage of the base humanoid and the base

creature, provided that the tauric creatures physical form is

capable of delivering those attacks. The absence of the base

creatures head always results in the loss of the base creatures

bite attack. If the creature loses its primary attack in this fash-

ion, all of its remaining natural attacks are still secondary. A

tauric creature has the base attack bonus of a monstrous

humanoid of the tauric creatures total nonclass Hit Dice.

Special Attacks: A tauric creature retains the special

attacks of the base humanoid and the base creature, provided

that the tauric creature is capable of delivering the attack.

The absence of the base creatures head always results in the

loss of the base creatures breath weapon or gaze attack.

Special Qualities: A tauric creature retains the special

qualities of the base humanoid and the base creature.

Saves: For each saving throw, use the base save for either

the base creature or the base humanoid, whichever is higher.

Abilities: A tauric creature uses the base humanoids

Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, and it uses the

base creatures Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.

Skills: A tauric creature gains skill points as a monstrous

humanoid of its nonclass Hit Dice. Treat skills from both

the base creatures list and the base humanoids list as class

skills. If the creature has a class, it gains skill points for class

levels normally.

Feats: A tauric creature gains feats as a monstrous

humanoid of its nonclass Hit Dice. It favors the feats of the

base creature and the base humanoid.

Climate/Terrain: Same as either base humanoid or base

creature, whichever is more restrictive.

Organization: Same as either base humanoid or base

creature, whichever uses the smaller number ranges.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +1.

Treasure: Same as base humanoid.

Alignment: Same as base humanoid.

Advancement: By character class of base humanoid.

Face/Reach: 5 ft. by 10 ft./5 ft.

Special Attacks: Pounce, rake 1d6+2

Special Qualities: Darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, scent

Saves: Fort +11, Ref +8, Will +2

Abilities: Str 18, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10

Skills: Intimidate +5, Jump +13, Listen +13, Move Silently

Feats: Alertness, Great Fortitude

Climate/Terrain: Temperate and warm hills and mountains

Organization: Solitary, pair, or pride (610)

Challenge Rating: 5

Treasure: Standard

Alignment: Usually lawful evil

Advancement: By character class

Pounce (Ex): If a tauric hobgoblin-griffon charges, it can

make a full attack (including a rake attempt; see below) even

though it has moved.

Rake (Ex): A tauric hobgoblin-griffon that pounces on an

opponent can make two rake attacks (+10 melee) with its

hind legs for 1d6+2 points of damage each.

Skills: A tauric hobgoblin-griffon receives a +4 racial

TITANIC

Titanic creatures are created as the result of powerful transfor-

mation magic as well as forces of nature gone awry. Because of

a titanic creatures limited intelligence, it is incapable of per-

ceiving itself as a Gargantuan being and has difficulty interact-

ing with its much smaller surroundings. The transformation

usually leaves a titanic creature confused or bewildered.

Except for their size, titanic creatures look identical to

the smaller creatures they were. Titanic creatures tower

over most living things, ranging between 32 and 64 feet

in height (or length). They weigh anywhere from 32,000

to more than 200,000 pounds.

WARBEAST

The warbeast is a creature born and raised to serve as a

riders mount. Bred for exceptional strength, aggression, and

surefootedness, these creatures are powerfully built, strong-

willed, and openly belligerent.

CREATING A WARBEAST

Warbeast is a template that can be added to any Medium-

size or larger animal, beast, or vermin (referred to hereafter

as the base creature). A warbeast uses all the base creatures

attributes and special abilities except as noted here.

The Monster Manual describes a few war creatures that

have qualities similar to those of a warbeast but differ from

standard creatures of a given kind. These creatures are con-

sidered to already have a separate war template and cannot

have the warbeast template added. For example, one can-

not apply the warbeast template to a heavy warhorse.

Hit Dice: Same as base crea-

ture +1.

Speed: Same as base creature

+10 feet.

AC: Same as base creature.

Attacks: Same as base creature (mod-

ified as appropriate for added Hit Die

and Strength increase).

Damage: Same

as base creature

(modified  as

appropriate for

Strength increase).

Special  Qualities:  A

warbeast retains the special

qualities of the base crea-

ture and gains the follow-

ing special quality.

Combative Mount (Ex): A rider on a trained warbeast

mount gets a +2 circumstance bonus on all Ride checks. A

trained warbeast is proficient with light, medium, and heavy

armor. A vermin warbeast, being mindless and therefore

untrainable, cannot have this ability.

Saves: Same as base creature (modified as appropriate for

the added Hit Die and ability score increases).

Abilities: Increase from base creature as follows: Str +3,

Dex +0, Con +3, Int +0, Wis +2, Cha +0.

Skills: A warbeast receives a +1 racial bonus on Listen and

Spot checks.

Climate/Terrain: Same as base creature.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +1.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Same as base creature.

Advancement: Same as base creature.

TRAINING A WARBEAST

A warbeast can be reared and trained just as the base crea-

ture can. If the base creature is a domestic animal, the crea-

ture need not be specially reared, but it must be trained for

two months (Handle Animal DC 20) to develop its abilities.

A warbeast based on a wild animal must be reared for one

year (Handle Animal DC 15 + HD of the warbeast), then trained

for 2 months (Handle Animal DC 20 + HD of the warbeast).

A warbeast based on a beast must be reared for one year

(Handle Animal DC 20 + HD of the warbeast), then trained

for 2 months (Handle Animal DC 25 + HD of the warbeast).

A warbeast based on a vermin, being mindless, is untrainable.

A trained warbeast is capable of carrying a rider into battle,

and it gains the combative mount special quality (see above).

Market Price: The market price of a warbeast is a

function of its Hit Dice: 50

gp/HD for a warbeast

of 3 HD or less, or 100

gp + 75 gp/HD for one

of 4 HD or more.

This enormous boar has a black-bristled hide marked by

hundreds of old scars. Its eyes are wild and bloodshot, and

its tusks are more than three feet long, gleaming like pol-

ished ivory and sharper than many swords.

COMBAT

A razor boar attacks intruders on its territory without prov-

ocation or warning. If attacking more than one target, it

tramples one and slashes the other with its tusks and fore-

hooves. The creature is swift for its size, and the thickness

of its hide allows it to shrug off many blows. Razor boars

have been known to recover from seemingly mortal

wounds, track down their attackers, and exact revenge.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a razor boar can trample

opponents at least one size

category  smaller  than

itself.  This  attack  deals

2d6+12 points of bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent

can attempt either an attack of

opportunity at a 4 penalty

or a Reflex save (DC 25)

for half damage.

Vorpal Tusks (Ex):

On a successful critical

hit against a creature of

up  to  one  size  category

larger  than  itself,  the

razor boars gore attack

severs the opponents head

(if it has one) from its body.

THE OPEN GAMING LICENSE

It  has  been  nearly  two  years  since  the  Open  Gaming  License  was

released,  in  conjunction  with  a  substantial  portion  of  the  core

DUNGEONS &  DRAGONS game  material  in  the  form  of  the  System

Reference Document. Since then, many publishers have had a chance

to  use  the  material  developed  by  Wizards  of  the  Coast  in  their  own

products to bring you a variety of d20 System compatible releases.

Now,  its  time  for  Wizards  of  the  Coast  to  take  its  first  step  into  the

same  realm.  Weve  decided  to  use  some  of  the  best  new  content

created  by  another  publisherthe  razor  boar  and  scorpionfolk,  the

creatures  described  on  this  page  and  the  facing  pageas  a  supple-

ment to the monsters in Monster Manual II.

designers of the monsters so we could ensure they got proper credit

here, and were thankful for their help and support.

Weve  printed  these  two  descriptions  at  the  end  of  the  book,  in  a

special  layout,  to  make  it  clear  that  only  these  two  monsters  are

considered Open Game Content. The rest of the material in this book

is still closed content, and cant be used in other products. You can see

the System Reference Document and a number of interesting and help-

ful d20 System materials at www.wizards.com/d20. The full text of the

Open Gaming License appears on page 222 of this book.

How did these monsters come to be here? One of the very first d20

publishers, Necromancer Games (and its publisher, Sword & Sorcery

Studios) came out with The Creature Collection, a compendium of vari-

ous  kinds  of  monsters  found  in  the  companys  Scarred  Lands

campaign world. As an example of the good work to be found in that

collection, weve adopted these two creatures and decided to include

them  in  an  official  DUNGEONS &  DRAGONS product.  The  folks  at

Necromancer were kind enough to give us a little background on the

pqqqqrs

Over the long term we hope to use more and more material created

by the independent pool of d20 System designers and publishers, just

as they are using the Open Content material created by Wizards of the

Coast. Instead of reinventing the wheel, were all able to partake of the

shared design resources that operate under the Open Gaming License.

As we continue to add Open Game Content to the pool of available

material via the System Reference Document, we hope to help the d20

System evolve and constantly become more fun to play, easier to work

with,  and  the  centerpiece  of  a  rewarding  hobby.  It  is  our  pleasure  to

share those objectives with all the other publishers who have joined us

in this great Open Gaming adventure!

affected by the loss of their heads, most creatures die when

their heads are cut off.

Fast Healing (Ex): A razor boar regains lost hit points at

the rate of 10 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does

not allow the razor boar to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Scent (Ex): A razor boar can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Scorpionfolk are nomadic crea-

tures forced into desolate re-

gions by other races.

From the waist up, a scorpion-

folk appears to be a four-armed

humanoid covered with black

armor. From the waist down, it

looks like an enormous scorpion. One pair of arms ends in

vicious claws, while the other pair ends in humanoid hands. A

scorpionfolk has waxy, gray skin, and its eyes are entirely black.

Scorpionfolk speak Common and Terran.

COMBAT

Scorpionfolk use major image to create illusions of small

oases or wells, luring travelers into traps. They then charge

their opponents, attacking with their lances. Any who sur-

vive the charge are trampled and attacked with stingers,

claws, and any melee weapons carried by the creatures. In

addition to their claws and sting, scorpionfolk may use fal-

chions, spears, scimitars, short bows, or crossbows.

Poison (Ex): A scorpionfolk delivers its poison (Fortitude

save DC 17) with each successful sting attack. The initial and

secondary damage is 1d4 points of Dexterity damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/daymajor image; 2/daymirror

image. Caster level 10th; save DC 12 + spell level.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a scorpionfolk can trample opponents at least one

size category smaller than itself. This attack deals 1d8+6

points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can

attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a

Reflex save (DC 20) for half damage.

SCORPIONFOLK SOCIETY

Scorpionfolk are nomads that live austerely and move fre-

quently. They carry their belongings with them, and use

tents for shelter.

Companies and patrols are usually younger individuals

out hunting or scouting in

force. Scorpionfolk tribes tend

to include more experienced

and less expendableindividuals.

Scorpionfolk survive through a com-

bination of hunting, foraging, and raiding.

They sometimes barter with creatures power-

ful enough to withstand their attacks.

SCORPIONFOLK

CHARACTERS

A scorpionfolk characters preferred class is

ranger, with some few taking levels

of barbarian. Scorpionfolk rarely

become druids, preferring levels

of  cleric  instead.  Reports  of

scorpionfolk sorcerers have not

been confirmed.

A scorpionfolk PCs effective

character level (ECL) is equal to its

class level + 16. Thus, a 1st-level

scorpionfolk ranger has an ECL of

17 and is the equivalent of a 17th-

level character.
