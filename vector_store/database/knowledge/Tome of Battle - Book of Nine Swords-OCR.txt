A QUICK PRIMER

lome of&tdt:TIl(Book ofNilit S\l\lrJ, describes a system ofspecial

combat "spells"k nown as the Sublime Way,the Nine Disciplines,

or blade magic. Here are some of the saliemrcrrns and facts you

will need 10 be familiar wirh as you peruSe'this book.

M artial Adept: A character with one or more levels in

rh e crusader. swordsage. or warblede class is k now n as a

martial adept.

M aneuver: A maneuver is a spe ci fic, one-s ho t effect that a

martialadept ini tiates. In th is way, a maneuve r is func tio na lly

similar 10 a spell. H owever, a martial ade pt usually doesn't

use up or expend maneuvers Juring the course of a day of

adventuri ng th e way a spellcaster does. He hegins each new

encoumerwnh all the-maneuvers he' readied for the day avai]

able to him. When a martial adept initiates a maneuver, it is

temporarily expended until he chooses lO perform a special

action required 10 recover his expended maneuvers.The type

of action necessary varies for each martial adept class.

The three hasic lypt'Sof maneuvers are boosts. counters,

and strikes. In addition, martial adepts can learn special

abi lilies known as srances (wh ic h are describe-d later in

Ibis introduction).

BOIHI: A boost augments a us er s abilities, usually attacks,

in some mannet, For example. a martial adept who studies

the Desert Wind di scipline can wreathe his wf'apon in flame

10 deal extta fire damage on a successful h il.

Coullter. A cou nt er is an immediate action that allows a

ma rllal adepi to foil an opponent's atlacks, For example. the

Stlting Sun discipline teac hes its adhere nts to avoid a foe's

charge by stepping aside .

Slnke: A Strike is a special alt.:k tha t draws on 3 discipline's

teachings 10 invoke a special effec t. The Stone Drago n dis

crpline, for example, teac h es us adherents to slam into rheir

ene-mies with crushing blows .

~ I ani al Discipline: A martialdiscipline isafamily or school

ofnunt'\n~ thatsharesoee common phiJosopln'or effi.a. Nire

manial disciplines exist, eac h ccnsisring offifreen to twe nty

maneuvers and stances.The- rune disciplines are called Desert

""ind, DevotedSpirit, Diamond ~lind, Iron Heart, Sernng Sun,

Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon. Tiger Claw . and While Raven.

Most martial adepts don't have- access 10 all rhe disciplines.

~taneu v('rs Know n : The collec tion ofmaneuvers a rnarnal

adep l has learned . You can think of lh is as th e ma rtial adept's

spellbook or spellltsr.A ma rtial adept's class and level deter

mine thl' nu mb cr an d level of man euvers she knows.

M aneuvers Read ied: Most mar tla] ade pts cannot keep all

maneuvers they know ~ady at all rtmes.At the begtnotog of

each Jay, a martial adept chooses sornecf th e maneuvers she

know'S as her tread ied" mane uvers (the numberls determined

by her class and level ).These are rhe maneuvers she can iniri

are. A martial adept can change her readied maneuvers at any

lime, bUI doing this requires 5 mi nutes of rest, mednanon.

prayer,or rhe performance ofvarious practice routines. The

specific details depend on the mar tial adept's class,

Stance: A stance is a special type of maneuver. Each stance is

apercular fighting poo;e that gramsa marrul3deprspecial ben

efitsand options. For example, rbe TigerClaw discipline teaches

SUllCes lhat alJo..,., the user to unlock herIeral,animalisric nature.

unlike other maneuver'S, most stances can remain in effl"C"t for

an indefinite time. All stances acharacter knows are available to

her at all times. A character can adcp r a stance, or-change from

one stance to another, as a swift action.

Key skill: Every mart ial maneuver is lied ro a skill, such

as Balance, Concentration, or Ju mp. Som etimes key skills

come in ro play in the initiatio n ofa maneuver. bur mos tly Ihey

represe nt the ideals aro und wh ich rbcir res pecnve disciphnes

ate centere-d.

Initi ate; A marttal adepr uses a martial maneuver bvtnitiat

ing u. So instead ofcasting a spell or ma nifesting a power. a

character initiates a maneuver.

In it iat or Level: Some maneuvers have effects that vary

with rhe level of the character i n itialing them. lnmaror

level is functionally equivalent to caster level or manifesrer

leo.'C'l-ils simply the relevant class 11"\'('1 of rbe m artial adept

who initiates rbe power.

C rusad er: The crusader is one of rbe three martial adept

srmdard classes described in Chapter 1, Crusadersare warriors

who use rbeu-devonon and zea] to powC'r martial maneuvers.

Swo rdsage: The swcrdsage is another of [be martial

adept standard classes from Chapter 1. Swordsages are blade

wizards -mystic swordfighters who can accomplish aston

ishing feals of mania I prowess. They know more m artial

maneuvers than other martial adepls, and Ihey have access

to the most martial disciplines.

W arb lad e:The th ird o( l he man iaI adep t slandard classes

dcscribl,J in Chapter I is the \\'arblade. These pu re warr iors

are ascetic champions who use marlial ma neuvers in place of

the fears c r rage that a fighrer or barbarian would empl oy.

O nce warblades have becom e an establis he d pa rt of a

campaign wo rld, they find th ei r niches on th e ba ttlefield,

in rhe roya l court, an d in th e twin arenas of public opinion

and public en ter tai nmen t. Wirh rheir crowd-pleasi ng mar

ti al ma neuvers, warblades make exce-llent gladia tors. and

th ei r Ih irs t for glory oflen leads them !O rhe p ublic ga mes.

However, war blades are equa lly like ly to become enmeshed

in rbe webs of court in trigue, playing cardinals off Juke's

and tnfenus off dauphins in a game that rh ey fin d nearly as

rewardingand exciting as swordplay, Whereas a rogue m ight

lament rhe loss of his riches and a cleric his loss of faith, a

wa rb lade feels no deficiency more kee nly th an the loss ofthe

public's admiration.

RECOVERING EXPENDED

MANEUVERS

You begin each e ncou n te r with all your readied maneu

vers unexpend ...d . \'(fhe n you In iria re a maneuver,

it is

expended-you can ne r use it agai n until you recover it.

You can recover expe nded maneuvers in two ways: through

speci al ac tio ns or at the end of an encou n ter. You never

expe nd a sta nce.

Specia l Actton: 11051 mart ial adep ts can refresh some or

all ofrhel r expended maneuvers in th e course of a banle by

raking a spe cia l act ion 10 do so. The type of specia l actlcn

req uired depends on a marti al adep t's cu ss (Dr fear) selection,

as su mmarized below.

Crusilder.A cr usader recovers expe nded maneuvers when

ever no more wit h held ma neuvers can be gran ted [ 0 hi m

(the rou nd in wh ich his last withh eld mane uver is g ranted

doesn't count).

SworJmgr: A swordsage can recover one expe nded maneu

ver o f his choice as a full-rou nd actio n.

U'llrbla'/e: A warblade ca n recover all of h is expe nded

maneuvers as a swift act ion, followed by making a mele-e

au ack or using a standard action ro do noth ing else in the

rou nd. Ifhe ininares a man euver or changes his stance du ring

:I rou nd , he C:II1t recover h is expended ma neuvers.

Multidll SSMat filll Adept: A characte r wi th lWO or more

martial ade pt classes keeps rrack ofhis readi ed man euvers,

exp end ed maneuvers, and recovery of expended maneuvers

separately for each class.

Clhlra(/er ll'itrl lheM'lrtr,11 Shl,ly ftat:Acharacter who kno ws

at rhe end of an encounter (see bel ow).

MARTIAL POWERS AND MAGIC

In gen eral, marti al maneuvers and stances that create supcr

natural effects are tran sparent 10 magic or psion ics. However,

martia l maneuve rs rarely Imcracr with spells or powers. O nce

a ma neuver is initiated, the effect last s on ly for you r turn

unless orherwtsc noted, giv ing all opponent litd e oppOrtu

nily to coun ter it.

Ex t r uo rdin a r y or Supcrn ar ura l Ab il itie s : ~ Iarti:ll

maneuvers and stances an' never spells or spe ll-like abilities.

Un less the descr ipti on of th e speci fic man eu ver or stance

says o therwise. trea t it as an ex traordina ry abil it y. Thu ..,

these abtltues work JU S[ fi ne in an lIntimagicfidd or a dead

mag ic zone. A maneuver or sta nce can't be d ispelled or

cou nrcrspc llcd, and init iati ng one does not pro voke attacks

ofopportu nity.

If a maneuver is overtly magical or otherwise uses a super

natural power source, iI is noted asa supernatural ability in Its

description. In this case, the maneuver obeys all the sta ndard

ru les for supernatura l abi lilies.

Derecr tng Ma rtial Man eu ver s: Most mane uvers don't

crea te persisrent or long-last ing effects , and rhe results are

obv ious ro an y observer. However, idem ifyi ng a speci fic

rnaneu ver, sta nce, or d iscip li ne requires th e Ma rtial Lore

skill (sec pagl' 28).

~ t u hip le Effect s: Mart ial maneuvers and stances usually

work as described in Cha pter 4, no matter h ow many other

powe rs, spe lls, or magical effects happen to be operating in

th e same area or on the same su bject. Wheneve r a maneuver

Drsta nce has a specific effec t on other man euver s, powers, or

spells, its descriprion explains the effecr. Most martial adepts

can use on ly on e sta nce at a time, but some hig h-leve l adepts

might be able to use two stances at on ce.

Stack ing Effect s: Man euvers or stances rh ar provide

bon uses or pe nalt ies on att ack rolls , da mage rolls, saving

th rows, an d othe r arrribu res do not stack with each other

unless spe cifica lly noted within their descr iptions.

MANEUVER AND

The various mart ial maneuve rs available to prac lirion ers of

the Sublime Way are described in Chapter 4: Maneuvers and

Stanc es. The description of each power follows a standard

form at, which is explained below.

NAME

This entry ts the name by whic h the maneuver is generally

kn own. However. it's fairly common for variou s schools or

rrad tuons of the Sublime Way to bestow their ow n names

on maneuver s. f or example, th e swooping d ragon st rt ke

maneuver might be k no w n as th e dra gon's po unce, the

gen tle reminder, or somethi ng as esoteric as Liam fall ing

down the mountain .

MARTIAL DISCIPLINE

Each maneuver belongs to one of ni ne mart ial d iscip lin es.

The man euvers in a d isciplin e are loosely linked by commo n

effect s, ph ilosophi es. or fun crtons. Th e second li n e of a

maneuve r or stance descript ion provides the name of the

relevant discipline, along with irs type (see below),

jus tlike man euver names. the names of martial disciplines

vary widel y from one locale to anot her. In facr. the rerm disci

plin e is nor universally u sed. Disciplines might he known as

schools, traditions, philosophies, regimens, teac hings, pmb s.

or srvles. For example. the Desert \'..;'i nd discipline might be

know n in some areas as the Creen Naga sty le or th e Wakeful

Dre amer ph ilosophy.

Each di scipline is tied to a sk ill th at rnig b t be used in the

execution of so me of its maneuver s. In addition, various

weapons lend th emselves ro tbe phtlcscpbvcr maneuvers of

different disci pli nes.

The nine disci plines include the follow ing.

D ESERTWlND

Speed and mobil ity are the hallmarks of th e Desert Win d

d iscipli ne. Desert Wind maneuvers often in volve blinding

flurries of blows, quick charge's. and agile footwork. Some

maneuvers from this school. however, draw power from

the supernatura l essence of the desert and allow an .;adt'pt

pracriricner to scour his foes with fire.

Theke}' skill for Desert Wind maneuvers isTumble. Weap

ons assocta red with Desert Wind include the scimitar. light

m ace, light pick, falchion , and speu.

DEVOTED SPIRIT

Faith , piety , and purity ofbed)' and mind ate' the wellsprings

ofa warner's true power. Devoted Spirit maneuvers harness

a pract ino n...is spiritual strength and her zealous devolion to

3 cause. This d iscipline includes ene-rgies banefu l to a crea

tUR!opposed 10 the Devoted Spirit student's cause, abilities

[hat ca n keep an adep t fighr ing long aftera mote mundane

war rior would fall to h is enemies, and strikes infused with

vengefu l. fana tical power.

Intim id ate is th e key skill for Devoted Spirit. Devot ed

Spirit assoc iated weapons include the falchion. grearclub,

longsword, and maul.

DIAMOND MIND

True qui ckness lies in th e mind, not the bod y. A stude n t of

the Diam ond Mind disc ipline seeks to hone h is perceptions

lind di scipli ne h is thought s so that he can act in slivers of

ti me so n arrow th at othe rs ca n not eve n pe rceive them . A

corollar y of this speed of th ought and act ion is rhe co ncept

of the mind as the battlegrou nd. An en emy defeate d in

h is mind must in evitably be defeated in th e rea lm of rhe

physical as wel l.

Concentrati on is rbe key ski ll for Dia mond Mt nd . The

rapi er. sborrspear, bas tard sword (kata na), and trident are

th e associated weapons for Diamond Mi nd.

IRON HEART

Absolut e- m3slery of the sword is the g001of the Iron H eart

discipline. Through unending practice and study. the Iron

Heart adept ach ieves superhuman skill with her we3pons.

Iron H eart ma neuvers are dernonstranons of uncanny mar

rial ski ll-weaving palIerns of steel that dizzy. confuse. and

ulumalr ly kill with no recourse.

Th e key skill for Iron Hean is B313nce, since J perfect

understa nd ing of motion is essennal ro maneuvers in

sword and two-bladed swo rd are the associ ated weapon s

Stance: A sta nce is ne t a m an euver, but a

specific fighn ng m et hod that you m aintain fro m

you gai n some benefit from it. A swcrdsage initia te

You ca n initiate a stance as a swift action, When yo u

enter a stance. you im media tely gain its ben efit. You

continue to gain the be ne fit of a typical stance as long

as you remain in it. Some stances give you a be nefit on ly

when you meer certain condi tions. For example, a

stance might grant a bon us when you move , when you

remain in th e same spot, or if you eu ack a stun ned

or flat-footed opponent.

You can u se a sing le swift action 10 en d on ...

any reason. If you later recover, you mu st use an other

swift action to initiate your stance once again.

Stances are considered maneuvers for the purpose

of fulfi ll in g p rerequisites for learning higher-level

maneuver s, orqualifying for pre stige classes or feats .

For example, if 2 Stone Dragon maneuver req uires you

to know one Sto ne Dragon maneuver, an d you know

[DESCRIpTOR]

Some maneuvers have descrtprors I hal further defi ne rbem

These des criptors appear on the same line 3S the discipline

of the maneuver.

The descript ors Ih al ca n app ly 10 maneuvers are cold. elec

Iric ily, ev il, fear. fire. force, good, mind-affecting, teleport.

and sonic. Most of these de scri ptors have no gam e effec t by

them selves. bUllhey govern how a maneuver in teracts with

orher maneuvers. powers, spells, or abilmes.

LEVEL

This entry gives the martial adept class or classes tha i have

accessto this maneuver:crusader,swordsage.cewarblade.The

line also gives the maneuver's level within that class.

You can learn any maneuver you like by c hoosing the

Marlial Study fe31, regardless of class. Howeve r, you must

still meer rhe prerequisite of the maneuver;

PREREQUISITE

In addition to meeting rbeclass and I~I requirements before

you can learn a maneuver, you must rnee r a ce rtain se r of

requirements 10 be able to choose rhar maneuver as one you

know, Stances are considered maneuvers for rhe purpose of

rneeri ng a prerequ isite [0 learn a new maneuver.

You ca n't learn a maneuver unless you gai n a level in a

mamal adep r class. a level in a prestige class th ai g ran l~

maneuvers known, or you lake the Marti al Study feat.

Mane uve rs Known: Some or th e more powerfu l maa eu

vers require you 10 learn one or more other maneuvers in the

same discipline before they can be selected.

INITIATION ACTIO N

This en try descr ibes the tvpe of action you must expend

[ 0 ac tivate a mart ial ma neuver, In some cases, you initiate

a ma neuver, and it s effect laslS for t he res t of you r ru rn

(or beyon d), In othe r cases, man euvers las t only as long

as rhc act ion required 10 in iriate them (t swift act ion, I

immediate acti on, 1 move action, 1 stan dar d acuon. or 1

full -rou nd acti on).

Sw i fl Action : A swifl action consumes a very small

amount of time, but rep resen ts a larger expenditure of effort

and energy t han a free ac tion, You can perform one swi ft

actio n per t urn without affecti ng your ability to perfo r m

0 1her ac tio ns. In rh at regard, a swift action is like a free

action. However, you can perform onlya single swift action

per tur n. regardless of what other actions you take. YOIl can

take a swift action any time }"Ou would norma lly be allowed

to rake a free action .

Cast ing a quickened spell or manifesting a quic kene d

power is a swift acnon, so }"OU can't initiate a maneuver wuh

an ininanon action of 1 swift action in the same roun d th at

you cast a qu ickened spell or use a quickened power,

Immedlare Action: Much like a swift action, an irnme

dia re ecucn consumes a very sm all amount of time , but

represen ts a larger expenditure of effort rhan 3 free action.

However, un like a swift action, an im med iate action can be

perfor med .1.1 any time-s- even if It's n OI you r rum. U Sing

an immed iate action on your rum is the "arne as using a

swlf acucn , and COUIU S as your sw irl act fon for the rum.

You cunne r USl" another immediate actfc n or a swift action

unnl after you r nex t turn if you have used an immediate

act ion when il is not currently you r turn (t'ffecrively, using

an immediate act ion before your turn is eq utvalem 10 us ing

your swi ft actio n for rbe coming turn),

You canno t use an im mediate action if you are curre ntly

Ilar-footed.

RAN GE

A maneuver's range indicates how far fro m you it can reach .

~hny ma neuvers are treated as Personal-range effects.

because you initlare [he maneuver 10 give yourself a specia l

bonus or c.apability for the round.

Standard nngt's include (b ut art' nOI lim ited to) th e

Personal; The maneuver affects only you ( bul might g lve

you an unusual pcwer er abilit y tha i affects others for rhe rest

of you r lurn).

Touch; You must [ouch a crea tu re or object to affect tr. A

maneu vers might affect any crea tu re you move adjace nt to

during the co urse of your tum. See the spe-cific maneuver

descripti ons for derails.

Range Ex p res sed in Feet : Some man euvers have no

standard ran ge category, ju st a range expressed in feet.

TARGETING A MANEUVER

You might hav e to make som e c hoice about whom your

maneuver is to affect or whe re ir will origina te. This entr y

describes the maneuver 's Iarget or target s, it s effect. or its

area. as app ropriate.

Target or Target s: Most maneuvers affect a specific creature

or object (or more th an one creatu re or objec t) that you de sig

na te as your Iarget or targets. You must be able to see or touch

the target, and you must specifically choose th at targe t.

Some m aneuver s ca n be initiated only on Willing largelS.

You ca n declare yoursel f a willing Iarge r :lt any time (even

ifyou're I le r-focred or ir isn 't your t urn). Unconscious char

acters are always considered willing, but a character who

is co nscious bUI im mobi li zed or helpless is not auroman

cally w ill ing.

Some man euvers targe t you (b ur they might confer an

unusual ab ility 10 affect other creatures for the rest of your

Burst: A burst affects whatever Ircatches in its area, includ

ing crea tu res you can't SC'e. It can't affec r creat ure s [hat have

burst is a s phere.

Emwrhl tlon: An emanauon functio ns like a burst. except

Ihallhe effect conti nues to radiate from th e poi nt of ori gin

Srrrwd:A spread effecr spreads ou t like a burst. bu t ca n IUm

corners. You select rhe point oforigin.and rhe effec t spreads

OUI a given distance in all di rectio ns.

Effecl: Some maneuvers create something rather than

;tl"fecli ng things rhatare already present.. Youmust design ate

rbe location where these things are toappea r. either byseeing

it or defining it . Range determines how faraway an effec t

can appe-ar.

Line of Effec l : Maneuvers Ihu affec t a ta rget c eber

unblocked pa th thai indicates what an effl."ct can affect. A

solid barrier cancels a line of effec t, bur line of effeer is

no t blocked by fog , d ar k ne ss, and ot her factors that limit

normal sight.

You must have a clear line of effeetto an}" larger that you

initiate a ma neuver against, or to any space in which you wish

10 crea re an t'ffecl 3t range (if you r man eu ver 3110ws that). A

burst or eman at ion affec ts on ly an area. creature. or objects

D URATION

A ma neuver's duration rells you how long its effecrlasrs .

End of Turn : The man euv er 's effecr lasrs until the end of

One-Round Durations: Some durations are measured as

1 round. You gain the capa bility [0 pe rform wh ateve r s pecial

effect or att ack the m aneu ver permits on your rum. Immedi

3[ely before your action in th e rou nd afte r you initiated the

SAVING THROW

Somet im es, a man euver with a special effec t or supernatu ral

SPELL RESISTANCE

Un li ke s pe ll descr iption s or power descriptions, m art ial

maneuvers do n't have a spell resistance or power resis tance

DESCRIPTIVE TEXT

Th is por rion of th e m aneuver descript ion explains wha t the

maneu ver does and how it works. It begi ns wit h a sentence or

IWO ofirallcized "read-aloud" text that gives players an image

of how the maneuver does what it does. If one ofth e previcus

lin es in the man euver descript ion included "see text," rhts

sectio n is where you fin d the explanation .

LEARNING MANEUVERS

First, the martial adept requires a safe place to me di tate

and practice. This effort wtllrake a number o f days eq ual to

3" rhe maneuver's level, so ifth e adept is devisi ng a zrh-level

maneuver, the research will require 21 days.The adep t pays 50

X P p..r day of stu dy, which r" presents an in te nse regimen of

medit at ion, fastin g, and practice designed to focus the mind

and spirit on the task at hanJ.

A martial adept can'r create a new m aneuver of a hi gher

level th an th e adept is capable of learni ng.

Ar rhe end of the requisite tim e for stu dy and pract ice, the

martial adept attem pts a Martial Lore check (DC 25 ..(2 x th e

m an eu ver's level ).

If th e chec k succeeds, the character learns th e maneuve r

rhe next tim e she has an opportuni ty fO learn a new m ane u

ver rhroug h level advancement or feat selection. If rhe check

fai ls, th e new maneuver is not yet perfected. an d sh e m ust

go throug h the stu dy and pracrtce rim e agai n if she wants

to kee p trying (alt hough she rega ins the XP she has spent

rh us far).

A OM shou ld work wi th the player before the attempt 10

develop a ne w m an euver hegins, and give her gu idan ce o n

the param eter s unde r whic h a ne w maneuver or dis cipli ne

mig h t be acceptable (see Crea ting New Spells, DMG 35).

Martial adepts iniriare mar tial mane uvers and sta nces. These

m aneuvers are manifesta tions of supreme marti al sk ill,

focus, and cla rity. They 3150tap into a su blime universal

energy or ki; by performing a maneuver to perfect io n, a

mart ial ade pt can ac h ieve amazing feats of ma rtia l and

at h letic prowess.

Mart ial adepts do nor have"spe llbooks,"bu r they do ready a

select ion oftheir maneuvers ahead of lime. Unlike ch aracters

wh o pre pare spells, martial adepts ca n quick ly choose a new

selection of readied maneuvers wt rh a brief pause 10 exercise,

SPECIAL ABILITIES

The Inco rporeal s ubtype was upd ated in Monster Monuo llll for

one with sh adow ma neuve r.

Inco rpo re-al Sub type: Some creatures are inco rpo rea l by

nature, whde e th ers (such as t he se that become ghosts) can

creature-s o magIc weapo ns or creatures that strike as magic

It IS Immune to all nc nm agical attack forms. Eve n whe n hit by

spells, Includ ing touc h spells, o r ma gic wea pon s, II has a 50%

chance to Ignore a ny damage from a co rpore al source (exce pt

An Incorporeal creature's attacks pass thr ough (.gno re)

are made normOilly (no miss chance).

Any eq uipme nt worn o r ca rried by an inco rpore4l1 creature is

also Incorporeal .1S long as it rema ins in the creature-'s po sse s

Slon. An ob lect that t he crea lure relinqu ishes loses Its ,nco rpo

An incorporeal creature can e nter or pass throug h so lid ob

An ncorporeal creature cannot pOIss through a force effect.

ADVANCING MARTIAL

Mos t of [he prestige classes presented In rhts chapter offl'r

some amount of continuing progression to a charac ter's

existing maneuvers known and maneuvers readied. Mutial

abilities acqui red through progression in a prestige cbs

simply add to the character's exif,ung martial maneuvers.

If you haw marual m.aneuvers irom 3 fear. rather than

from a class, things work a link ditTerentiy. The prestige

eLlSS grants vou new maneuvers as normal. You simply 3Jd

them to rh.. ma n..uvers YOU k now because offears you have.

You also inuiare and recover these man..uvers in the same

ma nner as you initiate and recover other ones. Lateron. you

might take levelsin the crusader, swordsage,orwarblade class.

Maneuvers you had prior to entering one of those classes

conn nue to Iu ncnon as they did previously. Track their use

and recovery separately from those granted by the martial

adept class levels.

MARTIAL ADEPTS

If you have levels in a marual adepr standard class (crusader,

swcrdsege. or warblade), you renin th e same method for

readying and recovering maneuvers that you pr ev iously

used. If you have levels in tWOor more marna]adeprstandard

cla sses (for example. you arc a mu It tclass swcrdsage/war

blad e). you must dec ide to which of your existi ng martial

adep t classes the new m aneuvers known or maneuvers

read ied apply.

Maneuvers Kn own: When you gain add itiona l mancu

vers know n. rhese simply add 10 the maneuvers known of

on e mart ial adep t standard class you already possess. You

might b.. able to pick new maneuvers from only a hand ful

ofdisciplines.

M an euvers Read ied : when indicated. you gain the ability

10 ready one or more additional martial maneuvers. If you

h ave more than one martial maneuver progression, you m ust

choose whic h progression the additional readied maneuver

slot app lies to. If you choose to add the maneuver readied (0

a marn a] ma neuver progression derived from crusader class

levels, you also gain one additional man euver granted at the

beginning of the encounter for each addt rional maneuver

you can ready.

Stances Kn ow n : If a class grants new stances known, you

can select stances from the disciplines available based on the

prest ige class.

Recove ry : You retain the same recovery method or merh

cds you already use. If you have levels rn more (ban one

martral ade pt class, you choose which recovery method you

ill use based on which adept class the new maneuver you

are Il',lrntng llrrhl's It > O I1Ct'lhlS choice IS made, It ca nno t

be ch anged.

NONMARTIAL ADEPTS

Ifvoudo not have any lewis in a martia l adeprstandard cuss

(crusader, swordssge, or warblade) before gaining levels In a

prestige class that improves your martial mane uver progres

sion. some special rules apply.

Ma neuve rs Known:The number ofmaneuvers you kncs

is dellrmimJ by the number of times you select the ~Iart l.al

Study feat. plus the number of new maneuvers known you

gain from your prestige class advancemens.

Man euvers Re adie-d: The number of maneuvers you

no ready is equal to the number of maneuvers you have

learned bymeans ofthe Mutial Study feat, plus the number

of new maneuvers readied you gain from your prestige class

advancement. Ifthe number ofmaneuvers you know exceeds

the number you are permuted to ready, you must choo..e

which maneuvers 10 ready and which to leave unreadied,

just like a standard manlal adept. You can change you r

selection of readied maneuvers with 5 minutes of exeret-e

and meduanon.

Sta nc es Know n: If a class grants new stances k nown, \'OU

can select stances from the disciplines available based on the

prestige class.

Recovery: You cannot recover expended ma neuvers inan

encounter if you do not have levels in a martial adept class, so

each ofyuu r readied maneuvers is usable once per encounter.

You ca n recover your expended maneuvers ou tside combat

wilh 5 minutes ofexercise and meditation.

If you gain access to a prestige class by laking th e Marml

Study feat, and that class has its own progression of man ..u

vers known, those new maneuvers can be used only onc e per

encoun ter. You retai n the recovery method you previou sly

had . If you then took mar tial adept levels, you cou ld recove r

ma neuvers you gained as a resu lt ofth ose levels as a mem ber

of lha l class. but the maneuvers from your previous levels

wou ld still be usable only once per e ncounter.

P LAYING A BLOODCLAW MASTER

Like the tiger, you are aloof and proud, but quick to act

when a snuario n demands it. Some mistake your demeanor

for arrogance. bu t you know your altitude is more ltke ~

tienee. You see k 10 learn the det ails around a circumstance

before offering your input. When you speak, you

do so sagely,wi th con fidence, even ifyou

aren't cer tai n rhar you are actually

co rrect . It is more important

that othe rs believe you are

right. that you aft' infa l

lible. Your patience is net

infinite, however, and

you are always eager to

spring into action. Norh

ing bothers you more

than spending a long pe

riod of time in a small,

STOPPING A RETURNING WEA PON

It might seem logical to ready an action to grab a weap on that

flies abo ut th e battle field or somehow str ike it from the air, but

a thrown weapon is no more vulnerable to such ta ctics than an

arrow. Although a feat such as Deflect Arrows remains usef.rl

protection, a thrown weapon with the returning special ability

must be treated like <lny other thrown weapo n. On ce thrown, it is

In rap id constant motion and neve r hover s o r hangs in the air.

However, some of the tact ics that work against arrows ca n be

ifecnve against a bloodstorm blade 's thrown weapon attacks.

For example, a creature co uld ready an action to close a door

between itself and a bloodstorm blade when the blade th rows

a weapon . If the readied action was cont ingent on the weapon

being thrown, the clos ed door would provide total cover against

the attack. If the readied action was cont ingent on the weapon

passing through the open door, the weapon would attack the

bloodstorm blade's intended la rget, b UI would be prevented

from retu rning and fall to the floor after making its attack

(whether su ccessful or not) . since line of effect no longer exists

between the weapon and its wielder,

an ack a foeas you moveand still readvvo ur weapon before the

enemy closes [ 0 melee range. You can also use Iighming rico

che r after laking down a foe in melee, using a ranged arrack

to soflen up an enemy you have nor }"el engaged. Using blood

wind ricochet and eye of the storm. you become a dead ly

ranged anacker wirh ample defenses against your enem ies'

ranged am cks. The blood rain stan ce combines well with

blood wind ricochet, but it rruly co mes tnro its own when

combined with a blood storm mike. ,\ dopt rhe blood rain

stance and use blood storm as soon as most ofyour enemies

ace within range. Afler striki ng every en emy on the field of

battle, you ca n maintain th e blood rain stance to co nnnue

dealing damage 10 rbem while you focus your me-let' attacks

on a single target.

vou migh t find yourself dogged by githyanki blademasters

intent on expunging all knowledge of rhls hidd en tradi tion

combat you make full use of your abilities regardless of who

of a single melee weapon. Fears such as Weapon Focu s and

NOl long ago. a secre t soci t'[y or swcrd -cuh of gilhyanki

\varblades had sole possession of the bloodsrorm techniques.

Devored 10 stu dy and maste ry of [he Iron Heart di scipline,

the githy.anki developed the signature abilities of th e style

over the course of gen eranons. Nalurally, the gubvanki saw

no reason to shut' th eir secret knowledge with anyone, and

thosewho pr ied too much about il found themselve s facing

irs lethal practitioners.

The n, about fcnv yean: ago, the secret gOi OUt. Some say a

member belrayed the sword-cult by teaching the blocds torm

style to an outsider. Others say a brave hu man warbladc stole

scripts detaili ng the maneuvers and learn ed me art from

The on ly no ngtrh organization of mar tial adept s openly

renowned hum an warblade named Treyana di vrada shonly

afTer the secrets of rhe style got out, the Guild isa loose associa

tion of mercen aries and sellswords bound together by some

simple, nonb inding vows. Blocd storm Guild members rarely

serve ernploversas a group, and instead tend to hire themselves

out as specialists. enforcers. and bodyguards. Guild members

in the same region often frequ ent rbe same tavern s, arm ing

gro und s, and tnining arenas. and they might pass news of

polential employmenr to one another. The guild has no true

hierarchy of leadership, ahhough more jun ior members

O rros the Blccdyhanded. sentinel of the Northern Reach

Th e Stone Dragon discipline tr aces its roots back to an

anci ent order ofdwarves that used rhe power ofthe earth to

enhance their combat srylc. A deepstone se ntinel immerses

hi m sel f in these ancient teachi ngs to link himself ro t he

power of stone. Most deepsrcne sentinels use this power

in rbe defense of their fellow dwarves, though some take

a mort" active approach balding the enemies oftheir people.

In combat. a deepstone sentinel is a living mountain. a stony

redoubt that provides shelter 10 his allies while crashing like

an avalanche upon his ene m ies. The ground shift s and churns

under his feel. One moment he stands atop a small. earthen

mou nd rhar blocks his eeemtes-c-rbe next he summons an

active, as a full-round actio n you can end rhe Stone Dragon

stance you initiated to gain the benefit of this abiluv . When

you do so , the hill you created With mountain fortress stance

suddenly sinks, sendinga ny foes standing in squares adjacent

to you crashing to the ground. In addition, you tum ble down

the crumbling hill lik e a living avalanche.

When you use this abili lY, all crea rures w ithin the area of

difficuh terrain created by your mountain fortress stance must

make DC 15 Balance checks or fall prone.The bon us for stabil

you know. You must otherwise follow all the no rmal rules

for entering and maintaining a stance.

Stone Cu rse (Su): From 41h level on , you can strike an

opponenl and channel rhe leaden welghr ofthe earth in ro its

arms and legs. For a brief moment, it labors in vain, unable

to move under the crushing burden you impose.

As an immediate' act ion, you can force' an oppan..n t you

within 60 feel ofyou. Th e pill ar oc cupies one square and is 5

and your strong connection to elemental eart h, ~'ou ca n

awaken rhe slumbering wrath ofSlone to send your enem ies

a dwarf's rac ial abili ry) does not he lp a creature avoid being

PLAYING A DEEPSTONE SENTINEL

A dcep srone sent inel embodies many classic dwarf traits. As a

sentine l, you are quiet. slow 10 ,:mger, taciturn, and blum. You

prefer to let your enemies come 10 you , rather th an charge

forward and expose your posi tion. A steady, reliable advance

works much better than a wi ld, risky gambit. Like the eart h

benea th your feel, you are reliable, steady, and en duri ng. O the r

warriors might rely on flashy gambits and fluid tact ics, but

you have little use for such stratagems. You are rhe roc k thai

endures, the im penet rable wall ofdefense t ha t wi ths tan ds rhe

enemy's assau lt. When it is lime to attack, you unleash you r

fury 10 an avalancheofsteel Until then, you lei your foes waste

rheir efforts against your sturdy armor and thick shield.

COMBAT

A deeps tone sentinel is, in essence, a mobile defensive posi

tion. O nce you enter mountain fortress Stance, you form a

useful barrier against enemies wbo seek to ski rt aro u nd you

and attack your allies. Once' you gain the indcm uable redoub t

ability, you can combine mountain fortress stance with .lI

stance from the Stone Dn:gon discipline. such as roo ts 01

DEEPSTONE SENTINELS

IN THE GAME

Deepstone se ntine ls are relatively easy to add into th e game

of particula r martial disciplines and other abilities by

adopting specific shapes usmg Its change shape ability.

When changing into one of these shapes, the rakshas;l

retains its claw and bile snacks and automatically

adopts the stance listed for the shape. Hthe rakshasa

cannot maintain the stance for some reason, it reverts

to its natural form and loses access to the martial

maneuvers the styfe shape grants. A nauyan rakshasa

can use only one maneuver per turn. Thus. if it uses a

strike man euver on Its turn, it cannot then use a coun ter

against an opponent while waiting for its turn to come

up again. In any of these shapes. a nailyan raksha sa has

the backward hands typical of the rakshasa race.

bUI when push comes 10 shove, it ade pts a style shape 10 banle

foes. A nairyan raksbasa adepts the style shape most useful

Finally, the elu sive adversary form comes inro play when a

naityan rakshasa needs 10 de flect enemy attacks or whe n it

desires escape from the bait le.
