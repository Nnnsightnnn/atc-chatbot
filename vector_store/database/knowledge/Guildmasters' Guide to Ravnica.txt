WELCOME TO  RAVNICA

ROM THE BACK OF HER SOARING ROC, A  SKY

knight surveys the spire-studded cityscape below.

As the morningfogdissipates under the chill au

tumn sun, the city spreads out as far as she can see:

lofty cathedrals. squat courthouses, towering apartments,

sprawling tenements, cobblestone plazas, and broken ruins

where once-majestic buildings have crumbled to rubble.

She imagines the teeming masses below her: humans, elves,

vedalken, minotaurs. goblins, /oxodons, and other peoples.

as some of them rise to greet the morning and others retire

after a hard night of work or play. They are the reason she

is here: sworn to protect them, she leads a flight of roe riders

toward the fires raging in  Precinct Three. Soldiers on the

ground will put out the flames,  while it's her job to deal with

their source: the dragon she can just make out. clinging to

the spire of a distant tower. Standing in her stirrups and

raising her sword, she turns her mount toward the dragon,

read)' to battle once again/or the sake of Ravnica.

Ravnica is a whole new world for your DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS campaign to explore. A vast, sprawling city

that covers the whole of the known world, Ravnica

teems with intrigue and adventure, driven by the con

tlicts among the ten powerful guilds that rule the city.

Ravnica originally appeared as a setting for the

MAGIC:  TuE GATHERING trading card game. It has been

the subject of eight card sets: 2005- 6's Ravnica: City of

Guilds, Guildpact, and Dissension; 2012-13's Return to

Ravnica, Gatecrash, and Dragon's Maze; and 2018-19's

Guilds of Ravnica and Ravnica Allegiance. Among fans

of MAGIC,  Ravnica is one of the most popular settings, in

part because the world's ten guilds strongly support the

way players build MAGIC decks.

As it turns out, Ravnica's ten guilds also provide a

great framework for a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS cam

paign. They offer character archetypes, competing

factions that player characters can join, and abundant

opportunities to develop and drive a campaign driven by

the guilds' schemes and interactions.

This book, then, is your point of entry into Ravnica

as a setting for your D&D campaign. It guides you

through the process of creating characters and adven

tures set here.

Chapter 1 is all  about building characters. It offers

new race and class options, reflecting the unique char

acter of Ravnica as a MAGIC setting, and the creatures

and characters seen on MAGIC cards. You can also use

this material in any other D&D setting.

Race and class are only the skeleton of a character,

though, and chapter 2 is aimed at helping you add flesh

to those bones in order to make a character who is an

integrated part of Ravnica's tapestry of guilds. The

ten guilds are detailed in chapter 2, and each section

includes a background that reflects a character's mem

bership in the guild. This chapter also describes oppor

tunities for characters to advance in rank and position

within their guilds by acquiring renown.

The focus of chapter 3 is on  the city itself- and par

ticularly on the Tenth Distr ict, which is the heart of

Ravnica. The important precincts and neighborhoods

of the district are described in broad overview, allowing

you, as DM, plenty of leeway for developing the specifics

of places and NPCs.

Chapter 4 is all about adventures in Ravnica, expand

ing on the material in the Dungeon Master's Guide with

hundreds of seeds that can grow into full-fledged adven

tures in the fertile ground of a DM's imagination. This

chapter also includes a short starting adventure you can

use to launch a Ravnica campaign.

Chapter 5 includes magic items and other treasures

for use as rewards in a Ravnica campaign. Many of

these magic items are D&D interpretations of specific

MAGIC artifact cards-not literal translations of their

mechanics from one rules system to the other, but game

elements inspired by the flavor and abilities of the cards.

Chapter 6 presents new monsters and NPCs, again

reflecting the creatures seen on MAGIC cards as well

as the nature of each guild. The guildmaster of each

guild is detailed in  this chapter, as are a variety of

guild members.

C ITY OF  GUILDS

In all their fantastic diversity, the cosmopolitan citizens

of Ravnica go about their daily business in bustling mar

kets and shadowy back alleys. Shambling pack animals

(mammals, reptiles, insects, and bizarre hybrids alike)

carry their loads through the streets, while untamed

wild things lurk in verdant greenbelts, rubble-strewn

ruins, and sewers. And interwoven throughout it all, ten

guilds vie for power, wealth, and influence:

Azorius S enate. The Azorius Senate functions as the

government of Ravnica, built on the three columns of

a legislative, a judicial, and an executive branch under

the leadership of lsperia, the sphinx Supreme Judge.

Boros Legion. Led by the angel Aurelia, the Boros Le

gion pursues the cause of justice, not merely law en

forcement. Boros serves as Ravnica's standing army.

House Dimir. House Dimir is in the business of infor

mation, operating an espionage organization behind a

facade of messengers, investigators, and archivists. Its

enigmatic leader, Lazav, wears many faces.

Golgari Swar m . An elf lich named Jarad guides the

Golgari Swarm's masses as they lurk in  the undercity,

where they process the city's waste and see to the new

life that emerges from death a nd decay.

GruuJ Clans. Raging against civilization and its defile

ment of the natural world. the loose alliance of the

Gruul Clans is led by the cyclops Borborygmos.

Izzet Le ague. Led by the dragon Niv-Mizzet, the Izzet

League is a guild of scientists and engineers who

build and sustain Ravnica's infrastructure while con

ducting wild experiments in  magic-efforts that usu

ally involve barely controlled elemental energy.

Orzh ov Syndicate. A s inister combination of church,

bank, and organized crime syndicate, the Orzhov Syn

dicate is controlled by the Obzedat, a cabal of ancient

spirits often called the Ghost Council.

Cult of Rakdos. The demonic Cult of Rakdos is the

jester in Ravnica's culture, using satire and perfor

mance to skewer the powerful and embolden the

weak. But it is a cruel and bloodthirsty jester, in the

manner of its demonic leader, and it s upplements par

ody and levity with blood a nd fire.

Selesnya Conclave. The Selesnya Conclave is led by

Trostani, three dryads who are fused  together with

one another and with Mat'Selesnya. a manifestation of

the soul of the world. The guild seeks to bring nature

and the city into balance.

Simic Combine. Under the leadership of Prime

Speaker Zegana, the biomancers of the Simic Com

bine apply magic to the life sciences. Striving to create

a harmonious future where creatures of all kinds are

perfectly adapted to their ever-changing environment,

the Simic magically hasten the process of evolution

a nd  adaptation of life .

These ten guilds stand as the foundation of power on

Ravnica. Each maintains a distinctive identity and civic

function, a diverse collection of creatures, and a sub

culture of its own. The guilds' history is a web of wars,

intrigue, and political machinations stretching over the

millennia during which they have vied for control of the

world. Their roles were established thousands of years

ago in a magical treaty called the Guildpact, which not

only assigned each guild a function, but also enforced an

uneasy peace among them.

HISTORY OF RAVNICA

More than ten thousand years ago, a war tore across the

world of Ravnica. Ten armies battled for control of the

world in a conflict that ended with the creation of a mag

ical contract of immense power known as the Guildpact.

The leaders of each of the ten armies-ancient beings

known as paruns- were the s ignatories to the Guild

pact, and they became the first guildmasters of Ravnica.

The text of the Guildpact spelled out specific roles for

each guild within the infrastructure of Ravnica, allow

ing the city to grow while the guilds coexisted in  relative

peace. But the true power of the Guildpact was the

strength of its magically binding force, which absolutely

prevented large-scale violence among the guilds.

For ten millennia, the city grew and flourished  under

this structure as the guilds evolved into unique and

powerful forces, often venturing far from their origi

nal  purpose.

The signing of the Guildpact marked the beginning

of the modern Ravnican calendar. Years prior to that

THE  GUILDPACT

During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC,

commemorating a monumental a nniversary of the

Gu ildpact's signing, the pact was broken, the ancie nt

balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into

chaos. It didn't take long for wealthy power-mongers to

begin seizing control of elements in the city, turning the

guilds to their service instead of the other way around.

Eventually,  the ten-thousand-year-old guild culture

and division of duties reasserted itself. The ten guilds

regained their dominant positions, but without the

magically binding force of the Guildpact to maintain the

balance among them.

Years later, in 10,075 ZC, the lzzet guildmaster dis

covered that Azor, found er of the Azorius Senate, had

created a contingency plan that would take effect if the

magic of the Guildpact were ever broken. An intricate

network of ley lines sprawling across the districts of

Ravnica, called the Implicit Maze. offered a test to the

guilds: if they could cooperate to solve the maze, they

would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power

was eventually bestowed- incarnated, actually-in the

person ofjace Beleren, who became the Living Guild

pact. His word became the binding law ofRavnica. Any

law he verbally confirmed became magically unbreak

able, and the responsibility of keeping the guilds in bal

ance fell  to him.

A  PRECARIOUS  PEACE

jace is a Planeswalker, with the ability to travel from

world to world, and his attention never remains focused

on  Ravnica for long. Thanks to his involvement with

other Planeswalkers, he spends extended periods of

time away from Ravnica. During his absences, Ravnica

has to fend  for  itself, and that means that the guilds re

turn to their old habits of fightin g with each other over

the smallest scraps of influence that could tilt the bal

ance of power in  their favor.

These conflicts erupt in a variety of forms. Sometimes

guilds clash violently in the streets: Boros forces try to

quell Gruul riots, Azorius arresters raid a Rakdos mur

der show, or Selesnya forces come together to repel a

Golgari incursion. More often, sinister plots unfold in se

cret, through infiltration, sabotage. theft, and deception.

Schemes are hidden beneath layers of other schemes,

making the intention behind them nearly impossible to

discover. The guildmasters are often the source of these

plots, but sometimes subordinates attack other guilds to

gain more influence within their own. In  the absence of

the Guildpact, some people believe that it's only a matter

of time until these schemes and skirmishes escalate

into all-out war on a scale that Ravnica hasn't known for

ten millennia.

With  the precarious peace always hanging in the

balance, opportun ities abound for adventurers to serve

their guilds or advance their own agendas. Whether

delving into the dungeons of the undercity, pursuing

assassins through the bustling streets, negotiating ac

cords among the rich and powerful, or sniffing out cor

ruption in the halls of law, the characters in a Ravnica

campaign have a world of adventure to explore.

LIFE IN THE BIG CITY

Ravnica is a vast city, covering the entirety of the world

in many layers of construction, from deep sewers and

catacombs to sky-raking spires. No single map can en

compass the tremendous scope of its sprawl, and its bor

ders (if it has any) are unknown. except possibly to those

who live near the edges.

The story of Ravnica focuses on its core. Sometimes

called the city proper. this core is divided into ten dis

tricts, each of which is a huge urban environment in its

own right. The districts are named in simple numerical

order from  the First to the Tenth. No correlation exists

between the ten guilds and the ten districts; all ten

guilds are active in all  ten districts. The Tenth District,

in particular, is a hotbed of activity where all the guilds

maintain their primary headquarters. It is the focus of

chapter 3.

A huge avenue called  the Transguild Promenade runs

through all  ten districts, making it the most notable

landmark for navigation through the city's heart. Lined

with markets, small  parks, and colonnades, the Prom

enade is a commercial thoroughfare used to transport

loads of cargo. On celebration days, it becomes the city's

most popular parade route. Even when guild conflicts

run hot, Ravnicans respect the sanctity of the Prome

nade as neutral ground.

Beyond the core are an uncounted number of other

districts, which originated as outlying cities that gradu

ally melded into the expanding metropolis. Well-known

districts outside the core include the Smelting District,

I rbitov (the mausoleum district), and ]ezeru (the lake

district).

Districts, whether in the city proper or beyond it, are

the fundamental configurations that define Ravnica.

They are informally divided into various quarters, neigh

borhoods, and the like. Some of these areas extend

across district boundaries. Deadbridge, for example,

existed as a well-defined neighborhood before Ravnica

City was formally divided into ten districts, and that di

vision was made without consideration of Deadbridge's

informally acknowledged boundaries. Part of Dead

bridge, known as Deadbridge Chasm, occupies much

of the Tenth District's Precinct Six, but it extends out

into the neighboring area. Similar neighborhoods, both

within and outside the city proper, include the Steam

bath Quarter. the Wrights' Quarter, and Mahovna, the

Haven of Moss.

GUILD  INSIGN I A

Members of Ravnica's  guilds typically carry guild insignia

with them, though in some cases  (notably House  Dimir)

the insignia might be carefully hidden. A replacement

insignia costs S gp and is available only to members of

the guild. Any character can use the insignia of their guild

as  a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the

Player's Handbook.

CURRENCY:  ZIBS  AND  ZINOS _ _

This book uses standard D&D coinage, as detailed in

the Player's Handbook, but in Ravnica, citizens refer to

their money as zibs and zinos, with 100 zibs to 1 zino.

There is  no central mint, as coins are created by the

Azorius, the Boros. and the Orzhov. The Ravnica Cur

rency table s ummarizes the various guilds' coinage and

its value.

RAVNICA  CURRENCY

These things are shared by the city's diverse peoples,

who enjoy a  life adorned by a variety of species, gender

identities, and sexual orientations.

Well-established systems undergird society, largely

through the efforts of the guilds. The Azorius Senate

crafts, codifies, and enforces a comprehensive (some

would say oppressive) set of laws. The banks of the

Orzhov Syndicate offer secure vaults and complicated

financial arrangements. The lzzet League maintains the

city's infrastructure, and the Golgari Swarm ensures

that waste is disposed of (or recycled). House Dimir cou

riers deliver messages and parcels across the city, and

the Simic Combine addresses issues of public health.

Ravnica lacks any large-scale agriculture operations,

its citizens depending on food  produced in Selesnya

gardens and underground Golgari rot farms. Few parts

of Ravn ica cou Id  be considered wilderness; the rubble

belts, areas where the city has decayed and been re

claimed by natural forces, are the only truly wild areas.

COMFORTS  OF  CIVILIZATION

A mixture of technological advancement and sophisti

cated magic offers amenities to the people of Ravnica

that would be extraordinary to folk in  most D&D worlds,

except one like Eberron. The nicer neighborhoods of the

city enjoy central heating and plumbing (thanks to the

work of the Jzzet League), elevators, and spacious apar t

ments. Even poorer neighborhoods boast clean and

smooth roads and sturdy construction. No one needs

to go hungry in Ravnica, because the Golgari Swarm

provides a bare minimum of sustenance to anyone who

can't afford better food, though it is best not to think too

much about where the thick gruel comes from. (In prac

tical terms, even a character who can't afford more than

a wretched lifes tyle doesn't need to go hungry.)

The citizens of Ravnica enjoy plenty of leisure time,

and the city offers an abundance of ways to fill  it.

Ravnica features restaurants with extensive collections

of fine wines, cafes serving coffee and tea, street ven

dors offering portable meals, and bakeries that sell a

wide variety of breads and pastries. Travelers can stay

in luxury hotels or simple hostels, or they can rely on

their personal or guild-related contacts to find housing.

Diversions and entertainments abound, including rau

cous street-side theater (including the circus-like spec

tacles of the Cult of Rakdos), operas and symphonies,

illegal fight clubs, spor ting events held in vast arenas,

throwaway popular novels. and great works of literature.

CHAPTER 1:  CHARACTER CREATION

HE PLAYER'S HANDBOOK DESCRIBES A STEP

by-step process of character creation. When

you create a character for a Ravnica cam

paign, you'll go through the same steps, with

the added step of choosing a guild.

Creating a character begins with imagining the per

son you want to play. The ten guilds of Ravnica provide a

way to jump-start your imagination and steer you toward

certain character archetypes that can guide the rest of

the decisions you make for your character.

CHOOSING A  GUILD

Chapter 2 describes the ten guilds of Ravnica in detail.

How do you decide what guild you want your character

to belong to? You can choose one of these approaches:

Look at the questionnaire, "What's Important to Me?",

in this chapter. Let its questions and your choice of an

swers direct you to a guild that appeals to you or that

sounds like a fun character to play.

Read the guild descriptions in chapter 2 and choose

one that appeals to you.

Read the descriptions of races and classes in this

chapter. Guild members hip recommendations

a re provided for each race and class, should one

catch your eye.

If you have access to MAGIC: THE GATHERING  cards

from a Ravnica set, find a card that appeals to you and

build that character.

If you're a  MAGIC player and you already have a  favor

ite guild, create a character from that guild.

To reflect your character's membership in a guild,

you can choose the background included in the guild's

description instead of a background from the Player's

Handbook or some other source. Also make a note of

your contacts.

GUlLDLESS  CHARACTERS

You can play a character who isn't a member of a guild.

Choose one of the character backgrounds in the Player's

Handbook or another source instead of one of the guild

backgrounds in chapter 2. Your guildless character can

be of any class, race, and alignment. At the DM's option,

you  might have contacts within guilds, or the DM can

invent contacts for you  that aren't associated with the

guilds of Ravnica in any way.

ff yo u want your character to join a guild at a later

time,  the same guidelines apply as if the person were

changing guilds, as described in  chapter 2.

R ACE AND  CLASS

Each guild description  in chapter 2 provides suggested

races and classes for characters belonging to that guild.

Some races have strong traditions that direct them to-

z

ward cer tain guilds, but exceptions exist. If you choose a

class or a race that's not typical for your guild, you might

have trouble finding a role in  the guild- or, more accu

rately, your superiors might have trouble figuring out

what to do with you-but that challenge can be an inte r

esting facet of your character's development. An atypical

choice can also motivate your character to adventure

independently from the guild.

This chapter describes new races you can choose

from: centaurs, goblins, loxodons, minotaurs, Simic hy

brids, and vedalken. It also presents two new subclass

options: the cleric's Order Domain and the druid's Circle

of Spores. Every subclass in the Player's Handbook also

receives a mention in  this chapter, indicating the guilds

where characters of those subclasses might find a home.

Once you've chosen your race and class and recorded

the benefits you get from them, you can proceed with the

remaining steps of character creation as described in

the Player's Handbook.

BUI LDING A  P ARTY

It's possible to put together a diverse party of D&D

characters drawn from a single guild. The guild de

scriptions in chapter 2 offer s uggestions for what such a

party might look like. Conversely, your party can include

members of different guilds united  by alliances or com

mon  principles. Or they could be childhood friends who

ended up in different guilds, or just a haphazard collec

tion of individuals thrown together by unforeseen cir

cumstances. The Party Makeup table in this section of

fers suggestions for how you  might compose your party.

The tables of contacts in chapter 2 can also help you

create connections among the characters in your party.

Those tables describe family relationships, current and

former romantic connections, random acquainta nces,

past rivals, and many other ties that form among peo

ple in different guilds. Let these tables inspire you as

you  think about the circumstances that bring your

party together.

Although conflicts among the guilds drive much of

the action in a Ravnica campaign, it's important not to

let that tension cause too much friction in a party of ad

venturers. The D&D game relies on cooperation a mong

the players, so it's helpful  for the player characters to

find common ground that unites them despite their dif

ferences in guild affiliation, ideals, and agendas. Even

though some guild leaders (especially the villainous

ones) might talk about exterminating or dominating

other guilds, many guild members have family, lov-

ers, friends, and acquaintances among other guilds.

Those positive associations can bind an adventuring

party together.

The DM can also use the Common Cause table in this

section to find a way to bring together characters who

don't know or trust each other.

RACES

The people of Ravnica include members of many differ

ent races. Aside from  humans, elves, and a smattering

of half-elves, the races from  the Player's Handbook

are unknown on Ravnica, unless they're visiting from

other worlds.

This chapter provides information about the following

common races of Ravnica, as well as racial tra its for all

of them but humans and elves:

Humans on Ravnica are like those found on other D&D

worlds: adaptable, ambitious, and wildly diverse.

Elves, in  their three common subraces, are strongly as

sociated with nature.

12

CHAPTt R  1  Cl!AR.\CTFR  GRE.\TIOX

Centaurs, the quintessential merging of human and

horse, savor freedom and champion nature's cause.

Goblins are small, fierce, stealthy, and some

times comical.

Loxodons resemble humanoid elephants with powerful

bodies, stoic natures, and serene wisdom.

Minotaurs on Ravnica are sophisticated tacticians as

well as strong and fierce warriors .

Simic hybrids are the results of the Simic Combine's

Guardian Project, which magically infuses the adap

tive qualities of certain animal species into human,

elf, or vedalken volunteers.

Vedalken are tall, blue-skinned, and ingenious, with in

satiable curiosity and a penchant for  invention.

HUMAN

Humans are a scant majority among the peoples of

Ravnica, dominating some guilds and barely repre

sented in others. As on other worlds, they a re inno

vators, achievers, and pioneers whose daring and

adaptability make them capable of great things-and

great falls.

Not one of the paruns of the ten guilds was human,

although the Ghost Council of the Orzhov Syndicate is

of human origin. Likewise, no current guild master is

human. But humans are lieutenants, advisors, and s trat

egists in  many guilds. Their ambition and drive propel

them toward the top, but the sheer might of beings s uch

as ancient dragons, sphinxes, and demons keeps hu

mans one rung down from  the pinnacle of power.

The humans of Ravnica are no less physically diverse

than those of other worlds. Simi larly, they are varied in

their inclinations: they alone are found in every guild.

HUMAN N AM ES

One particular human tongue has triumphed over all

others to become Ravnica's Common language, and its

phonemes and traditions shape the names of most of

Ravnica's humans. Humans sometimes borrow names

from other races, but they have a rich pool of traditional

names to draw from .

elves, and they tend to have angular features and pale

skin that often verges toward greenish hues.

Wood Elves. The wood elves of Ravnica, called the

Silhana, are strongly associated with the Selesnya

Conclave. Most guild less elves can also trace their an

cestry to the Silhana. Their coloration covers the whole

human range, and sometimes extends to green- or cop

per-colored hair.

Dark Elves. The word "drow" isn't used on Ravnica,

but the Devkarin elves are sometimes called the elves

of shadow. They are closely connected to the Golgari

Swarm, and because they generally live underground,

they share other dark elves' sensitivity to sunlight. Un

like the drow of other worlds, their coloration is much

the same as that of wood elves, though their bair is usu

ally dark brown or black.

ELF  NAMES

If the tradition of using child names for young elves,

as described in the Player's Handbook, was ever prac

ticed on Ravnica, it has long since died out. Some

traditional Elvish names remain in use, often modified

by the influence of human names. Most elves don't use

family names.

Male Names: Alcarus, Aramin, Beryan, Carrie, Ezoc,

Gurras, Jmmeral,jarad, Laucian. Mihas, Mandor, Mo

lander, Peren, Suniel, Theren. Varis

Female Names: Arin, Bethrynna, Cevraya, Dainya.

Drusilia, Elga, Emmara, Fonn, Ielenya, Iveta, Karissa,

Kirce, Meriele, Nayine, Niszka. Svania, Veszka, Yeva

The use of family names seems to be a peculiarly hu

man custom. Family names are passed down to children

from either parent, and sometimes children use the

family names of both their parents. For example, Micyl

Savod Zunich was the son of Fonn Zunich and Jarad

Vod Savo. When other races use family names, they are

usually derived from some connection (not necessarily a

blood tie) to a human family.

ELF

The elves of Ravnica are as much at home in the mar

kets of Ivy Lane and the inns of Oak Street as their kin

on other worlds are in ancient forests and fey castles.

They scale the spires of cathedrals and meditate in gar

dens and greenbelts. They are part of the city, contribut

ing to its vibrant life and sprawling growth while ensur

ing it never strays too far from its roots in the earth.

Elves are associated with the principles and magic of

nature. growth, and stability. Striving to live in harmony

with both nature and the community of Ravnica, they

are drawn to guilds that share those ideals, particularly

Selesnya, Golgari, and Simic. The Gruul Clans revere

nature but set themselves in opposition to civilization,

so they don't hold much appeal for the typical elf.

Ravnica's elves don't share the unearthly, haunting

presence of the ir kin on other worlds, perhaps because

of the extent to which the city has rubbed off on them.

They can easily be mistaken for human from certain

angles. particularly if their long, pointed ears and their

delicate facial  features aren't apparent.

ELF SUBRACES

As on other D&D worlds, Ravnica's elves can be catego

rized as high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, though

there is little physical difference among the three sub

races here. Elves share the traits described in the Play

er's Handbook for their race and subrace.

High Elves. The high elves of Ravnica have been

subsumed into the Simic Combine and have lost their

original tribal name. They are more slender than other

CENTAUR

In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where open road'.

seems like a contradiction and "open plain" is sheer

nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of

wide spaces and the freedom  to travel. As much as

they can, centaurs run-in wide plazas, spacious

parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race

the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming

behind them, until the next wall looms in  their path

and brings them to a stop.

NATURE'S  CAVALRY

Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to  the waist,

of muscular humans, displaying all the human

variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are

slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and

squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they

have the bodies of small  horses, with a similar

range of coloration- from various s hades of chest

nut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped

patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their

tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long,

flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough.

spiky styles.

The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to

human torsos in s ize, and their lower equine bodies

average about 4  feet tall al the withers . Though they

are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse,

they fill  similar roles as cavalry warriors. messen

gers, outriders, and scouts.

AFFINITY FOR NATURE

Centau rs have an affinity for the natural world. Among

the guilds  that s hare that affinity, centaurs favor the

rubblebelts of the Gr uul Clans and the wide plazas of

the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the

Golgari and the laboratories of the S imic.

Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of

a foal is a lways cause for festivities. At the same time,

they reve re the traditions of the past, and among both

the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory

and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the

legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship

with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse

like bodies, and delight io the feeling of running along

side herds and packs of other beasts.

CLANS  AND  COMMUNITY

Centaurs sense the intercon nectedness of the natura l

world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as

microcosms of that greater connection. Among the

Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya

centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communi

ties as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history

and tradition a lso means that centaurs are more likely

than most othe r Ravnicans to join the same guild that

their parents did.

CENTAUR NAMES

Centaurs' given names are passed down through family

lines. The name bestowed on a new foal is typically the

name of the most recently deceased fami ly member

of the same gender, keeping a live the memory- and,

the centaurs believe, some shard of the s pirit- of the

departed. Centaurs don't use fami ly names, but they

wear symbols that represent their family membership.

These symbols  might include graphical re presentations

of plants or animals. printed mottoes. braids and beads

worn in the hai r and tail. or even specific patterns of

woven fabric.

Size. Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with

their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers.

Your size is Medium.

Speed.  Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

Fey. Your creature type is fey,  rather than humanoid.

Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a

target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the

same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a

bonus action, making one attack against the ta rget with

your hooves.

Hooves. Your hooves are natural melee weapons,

which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit

with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to  ld4 +

your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning dam

age normal for an unarmed strike.

Equine Build. You count as one size larger when de

termining your carrying capacity and the weight you can

push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is

especially difficult for you because of you r equine legs.

When you make such a climb, each foot of movement

costs you 4 extra feet,  instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

Survivor. You  have proficiency in one of the following

skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Na

ture, or Survival.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common

and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya

Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural

phenomena and spiritual forces.

GOBLIN

Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter,

or snarling in a fury,  goblins are wretched and inconse

quential- at least in the eyes of most of Ravnica's other

folk.  ln their own minds, though, they are content to lurk

in  the shadows only until they fully come into their own

and receive the recognition they believe they deserve.

They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility,

crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has en

abled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures

larger and more powerful than they are.

SMALL AND WIRY

Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in warty green

or red skin, goblins have huge noses and ears. Their

wiry bodies are surprisingly strong. and their mouths

are full  of sharp, crooked teeth.

Most goblins are bald, either by heredity or by choice,

but a few  boast shocks of red or black hair. Their arms

and legs are elongated in proportion to their small bod

ies, and their fingers and toes are also long and slender.

Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their toes ex

posed for climbing.

UNFETTERED EMOT ION

Creatures of raw impulse, goblins are found among

guilds that value that quality, particularly the Tzzet

(where they typically serve as attendants for  research

ers), the Gruul (in camps that form hapless buffers

between the clans and civilized regions), the Rakdos

(putting their love of explosions to good use), and occa-

lb

CllAr I l!R  1  I CHAR \CH R  <'REA TIOI-<

sionally the Boros (if they discover a well of discipline

and courage within themselves, or find  themselves

unable to resist the shininess of Boros weapons and ar

mor). Many goblins are guildless and make their way as

members of street gangs.

Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, goblins have

an inclination toward destruction, which can take a play

ful  form  but is often anything but. Some goblins clobber

things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to

blow things up.

Goblins have an outrageous sense of humor, usually

expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious

among them find  pleasure in the misfortune of others

and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they're amused.

They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just

to confuse and befuddle others.

GOBLIN  NA MES

The Goblin  language is fond  of certain sounds, and gob

lin names tend to repeat those sounds to form what can

sound like nonsense words. A goblin's name gives no

indication of gender.

Goblin Names: Azzinax. Babolax, Blixanix, Crixizix,

Dazzaz, Estrix, Finizix,Juzba, Kaluzax. Lyzaxa,

Mizzix, Myznar, Nixispix, Paxizaz, Ravixiz, Stixil,

Sunnix, Tozinox, Uxivozi, Vazozav, Wexiny. Zizzix

GOBLIN TR.A ITS

Your goblin character has the following racial traits.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score

increases by 2, and your Constitution score in

creases by  1.

Age. Goblins reach adulthood around age 8. They

age noticeably faster than humans, and though few gob

lins live to old age, the most cautious rarely live longer

than 60 years.

Alignment. Most of the goblins of Ravnica are chaotic,

with  no inclination toward good or evil.

Size. Goblins are between 3 and 4 feet  tall and weigh

between 40 and 80 pounds. Your size is Small.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision. You can see in dim ligh t within 60 feet

of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it

were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only

shades of gray.

Fury of the Small. When you damage a creature with

an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than

yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra

damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your

level. Once you  use this trait, you can't use it again until

you finish a short or long rest.

Nimble Escape. You  can take the Disengage or Hide

action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

Languages. You  can speak, read, and write Common

and Goblin. In Ravnica, Goblin is a simplistic language

with a limited vocabulary and fluid  rules of grammar,

unsuited for any sophisticated conversation.

LOXODON

The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often

oases of calm in  the busy streets of Ravnica. They

hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or

sit in perfect stillness. 1f provoked to action, loxodons

are true terrors- bellowing with rage, trumpeting and

flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty,

and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to

their guilds.

LUMBERING  GIA NTS

Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing

over 7 feet tall. They have the heads- trunks, tusks,

ears, and faces-of elephants, and hulking bipedal bod

ies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands

has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed,

oval-shaped feet of elephants.

Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful

appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of

smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy

objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and

liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.

G I FT ED  STONEWO RKERS

Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unri

valed intuition about their craft. Although they make

nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so

ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to

impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya,

it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild's magnifi

cent, cathedral-like arboretum structures.

RELENTLESSLY LOYAL

Loxodons believe in the value of community and life,

and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave.

Some find fulfillment in the cause of order by joining the

Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.

Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a

responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have

joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any ca

pacity, loxodons devote themselves to  maintaining that

bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing

to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They

expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from  the

other members of their communities and can be severe

in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.

The pr imary difference between loxodons who join

different guilds is their sense of the size of the commu

nity they belong to.  For loxodons in  the Selesnya Con

clave, their community is the world and all living beings

in it-everything valuable, meant to live in harmony. and

interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community pri

marily means a society of different peoples who need ad

herence to law and order so they can function  together.

For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means

the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority

over those of any other group.

LOXODON  NAMES

A loxodon's name includes subtle tones, produced in a

loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status,

fami ly connection, and community role. S ince most

non-loxodons can't distinguish these underlying tones,

let alone produce them. loxodons often translate them

into titles. such as Hierarch. Revered, Grandmother,

Healer, or Saint when interacting with other races.

LOXODON TRAITS

Your loxodon character has the following racial traits.

Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in

creases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by  1.

Age. Loxodons physically mature at the same rate

as humans, but they live about 450 years. They highly

value the weight of wisdom and experience and are con

sidered young until they reach the age of 60.

Alignment. Most loxodons are lawful, believing in

the value of a peaceful,  ordered life. They also tend

toward good.

Size. Loxodons s tand between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their

massive bodies weigh between 300 and 400 pounds.

Your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Loxodon S erenity. You have advantage on saving

Trunk. You can grasp things with your trunk, and you

can use it as a snorkel.  lt has a reach of 5 feet, and it can

lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature;

open or close a door or a container; grapple someone;

or make an unarmed strike. Your OM  might allow other

simple tasks to be added to that list of options.

Your trunk can't wield weapons or shields or do any

thing that requires manual precision, s uch as using

tools or magic items or performing the somatic compo

nents of a spell.

Keen Smell. Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you

have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom

involve smell.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common

M I N OTAUR

The minotaurs of Ravnica are strong in body. dedica

tion, and courage. They are at home on the battlefield,

willing to  fight for  their various causes. They combine a

burning fury in battle with keen tactics that make them

excellent commanders as well as valuable shock troops.

HORNS AND  HOOVES

Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads re

sembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from

about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three

times that length. They often orname nt their horns with

metal rings or sheathe them in  metal to protect them

from damage.

Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks

and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on

their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven

hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but

minotaurs of the Ordruun clan (and some others) have

their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony;

they find the heavy armor of the Boros legion much

more comfortable without a long tail in the way.

STRENGTH AND ZEAL

Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found

among the Gruu l Clans, but the minotaurs of the

Ordruun fam ily line, long associated with the Boros

Legion, a re much better known and respected. Boros

minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the

fury of the pack.

Minotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence.

but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are pas

sionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and

they laugh loud and long at good jokes.

FAMILY AND  GUILD

Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes

perhaps they were once thought of as gods-who estab-

1 ished the minotaurs' place in  the world. Every minotaur

in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes.

11\

llAPTER  I  CH \R \<  I ER GRE \TION

those associated with the Cult of Rakdos or the Gruul

Clans tend toward chaotic alignments.

Size. Minotaurs average over 6  feet in height, a nd they

have stocky builds. Your size is  Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is  30 feet.

Horns. Your horns are natura l melee weapons, whic h

you can  use to make unarmed strikes. If you  hit with

t hem, you deal piercing damage equal to ld6 +your

Strength modifier. instead of the bludgeoning damage

normal for an unarmed strike.

Goring Rush. Immediately after you use the  Das h

action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you

can make one melee attack with your horns as a  bo

nus action.

Hammering Horns. Immediately after you  hit a c rea

ture with a  melee attack as part of the Attack action

on your turn, you can use a  bonus action  to atte mpt

to shove that target with your ho rns. The target mus t

be no more than one size larger than you and within

5  feet of you.  Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving

throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bo

nus+ your Stre ngth modifie r, you push it up to 10 feet

away from you.

Imposing Presence. You  have proficiency in one

of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or

Persuasion.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common

and Minotaur.

The Ordruun line is  the most prominent. with thou

sands of members descended from an ancient hero who

is s aid to have  taught minotaurs the a rts  of war. Other

important family li nes include the Kharran line (primar

ily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa

line (found scattered among th e Gruul Clans), and the

Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the  Gruul,

with a significant number in the Rakdos as well).

Since each family line has so many members, mi

notaurs don't usually find  it helpful to connect the

name of the line  to their personal na mes; even though

Commander Grozdan of the Boros  Legion's Kame n

Fortress is  a  prominent membe r of the Ordruun line, he

would never call  himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a

human would.

MINOTAUR NAMES

The legends that recount the deeds of ancient minotaur

heroes are full of other names as well: those of the

retainers, allies, love rs, servants, e ne mies, and others

who played roles, however small, in the lives of the  he

roes. Almost every minotaur name is  drawn from that

long list of minor characters  of legend, so that those  folk

are never forgotten.

Male Names: Alovnek, Brogmir, Brozhdar, Dornik,

MINOTAUR TRAITS

Your minotaur character has th e  fo llowing racial traits.

These traits are also suitable  for minotaurs in othe r

D&D wo rlds where these people have avoided the de

SIM IC  H YBRID TRAITS

Your hybrid character has the following racial traits.

A bility S core Incr ease. Your Constitution score in

creases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice

increases by 1.

Age. Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves,

or vedalken. They age at a slightly accelerated rate, so

their maximum life spans are probably reduced some

what. The Guardian Project has not been operating long

enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.

A lignment. Most hybrids share the generally neutral

outlook of the Simic Combine. They are more interested

in scientific research and the standing of their guild

than in moral or eth ical questions. Those who leave the

Combine, however. often do so because their philosoph

ical outlook and alignment are more in line with a differ

ent guild's.

S ize. Your size is Medium , within the normal range of

your humanoid base race.

Sp eed.  Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Dark vision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet

of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it

were dim light. You can't discern color  in darkness, only

shades of gray.

Languages. You can speak , read, and write Common

and your choice of Elvish or Vedalken.

Animal Enhancement. Your body has been altered to

incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose

one animal enhancement now and a second enhance

ment at 5th level.

At 1st level, choose one of the fol lowing options:

M anta Glide. You have ray-like fin s that you can use as

wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you

fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to

100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage,

and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1

foot you descend.

Nim b le Climber. You have a climbing speed equal to

your walking speed.

Underwater Adaptation . You can breathe air and wa

ter, and you have a swimming speed equal to your

walking speed.

At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new

characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn't

take at 1st level , or one of the following options:

Gr appling Appendages. You have two special append

ages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether

they're both claws or tentacles. As an action , you can

use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one

is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make

an  unarmed strike. If you hit wi th it, the target takes

bludgeoning damage equal to l d6 +your Strength

modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal

for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you

can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These

appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and

can't wield weapons, magic items. or other specialized

equipment.

Carapace. Your skin in places is covered by a thick

shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wear

ing heavy armor.

SI MIC  H YBRID

The S imic Combine uses magic to fuse different life

forms together. In recent years, the Simic Combine has

extended this research to humanoid subjects, magically

transferring the traits of various animals into humans,

elves, and vedalken. The goal of the Guardian Project is

to build a Simic army of soldiers perfectly adapted to a

variety of combat situations. These hyper-evolved spec

imens are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes

refer to themselves as guardians.

EXTENSIVE ADAPTAT ION

A hybrid's biological enhancements can change its ap

pearance drastically, though most hybrids retain their

basic physical form. AJI are augmented with character

istics of animals, mostly aquatic, reptilian, or amphibian

creatures. These include crab claws, squid tentacles,

wings or fins like those of manta rays, translucent

or camouflaged skin, or shark-like maws filled with

sharp teeth.

Hybrids are the product of Simic magic. It's not im

possible for a hybrid to leave the Simic Combine and

join another guild, but the S imic would consider the in

dividual a deserter. And the new guild might never  fully

welcome a hybrid who could easily be a Simic spy.

SIMJC  HYBRID NAMES

A hybrid usually bears the name given by their human,

elf, or vedalken parents. Some hybrids assume a new

name after their transformation- a name chosen per

sonally or by those who transformed them.

Acid Spit. As an action, you can spray acid from glands

in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you

can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10

acid damage unless it succeeds on a  Dexterity saving

throw against a  DC equal to 8 +your Constitution

modifier+ your proficiency bonus. This damage in

creases by ldlO when you  reach 11th level (3dl0) and

17th level (4d 10). You can use this trait a number of

times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of

once), and you  regain all expended uses of it when you

finish a long rest.

VEDALKEN

Nothing is perfect. Vedalken not only believe this fact,

they rejoice in it.  Every imperfection is a chance for  im

provement, and progress is an endless march toward a

state of perfection that can never be reached. This view

point leads vedalken to pursue their work with delighted

enthusiasm, never deterred by setbacks and excited by

every opportunity for improvement.

Vedalken are tall and slender, standing almost a head

taller than humans on average but weighing about the

same. Their hairless skin comes in a range of shades of

blue. Their eyes are darker shades of blue or violet. They

lack external ears, their noses are broad and fiat, and

they are partially amphibious.

COOL RATIO NA LTTY

Despite being talkative, vedalken keep thei r personal

lives private. and they tend to engage more with ideas

than with people. They form close friendships based on

mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their

interactions dwell on their thoughts about those issues

rather than their feelings about them.

To membe rs of other races, vedalken often seem cold,

even emotionless. That assessment isn't fair- they feel

emotion every bit as intensely as other folk do, but they

are skilled at not displaying it.  Cool  rationality guides

their actions, they make and follow careful plans, and

they are patient enough to do nothing when the ideal

outcome relies on such inaction.

R EASO NING TOWARD  PERFECTION

Their curious intellects and rational minds incline

vedalken toward membership in the Azorius Senate, the

Simic Combine, and (less often) the  lzzet League . What

ever their guild affiliation, they put their intelligence to

use in crafting and improving things, whether those

things are laws,  procedures, or magical sciences.

Vedalken believe that the path toward the impossible

goal of perfection  is paved with bricks of ed ucation,

careful  deliberation, and controlled experimentation.

Some vedalken direct their energy toward perfecting

themselves, whether by means of Simic bioengineering

or through extensive study, a nd others concentrate on

perfecting society through the careful drafting and ap

plication of laws.

VEDALKEN  NAMES

Vedalken are given  names at birth, but usua lly choose

new names for themselves as part of their transition into

adulthood. They rarely use family names.

Male Names: Aglar, Bellin, DaHid, Firellan, Kavin.

CLASSES  BY  GUILD

Your character can have any class that appears in  the

Player's Handbook (or other sources, with your DM's

permission). Certain classes and subclasses are espe

cially appropriate for particular guilds. reflecting the

traditions and training of those guilds. This section can

help you choose a guild if you already know what class

you want to play.

BARBARIAN

If you want to play a barbarian, your most likely

guild home is the Gruul Ciaos, but you could also put

your rage to work in  the wild spectacles of the Cult

ofRakdos.

SUBCLASS  OPTIONS

Two classes receive subclass options in this section: the

cleric and the druid.

At 1st level, a cleric chooses a Divine Domain. This

book adds the Order Domain to the options available to

the cleric making that choice.

At 2nd level, a druid chooses a Druid Circle. This

book adds the Circle of Spores to the options available

to the druid making that choice.

CLE RIC:  ORDER DOMAI N

The Order Domain  represents discipline, as well as

devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedi

ence to the laws governing it.  On Ravnica, the domain

is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to

maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndi

cate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain.

On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain

include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Weejas,

Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anu bis, Forseti,

and Asmodeus.

The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all

else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing

influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order

are typically concerned with how things are done, rather

than whether an action's results are just. Following the

law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it

benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.

Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the

law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so

to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an

intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge

order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

DIVINE STRIKE

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon

strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns

when you  hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can

cause the attack to deal an extra ld8 psychic damage to

the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage

increases to 2d8.

ORDER'S WRATH

Starting at J 7th level, enemies you designate for de

struction wilt under the combined efforts of you and

your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a

creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until

the start of your next turn. The next time one of your

allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target

also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You

can curse a creatu re in this way only once per turn.

DRUID:  CIRCLE  OF  SPORES

Druids of the Circle of Spores find  beauty in decay. They

see within mold and other fungi the ability to trans-

form  lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat

strange, life.

These druids believe that life and death are parts of a

grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back

again. Death isn't the end of life,  but instead a change of

state that sees life shift into a new form .

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with

the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing

inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to

be a companion to life and death. But these druids be

lieve that the natural cycle is healthiest when each seg

ment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to

replace all  life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing

to a final  rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

BONUS  PROFICIENC IES

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain profi

ciency with heavy armor. You also gain proficiency in the

Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice).

VOICE OF AUTHORITY

Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the power of law to

drive an ally to attack. If you cast a spell with a spell slot

of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell,

that ally can use their reaction  immediately after the

spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of

your choice that you can see.

If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the

ally who can make the attack.

CHANNEL DIVINITY:  ORDER'S  DEMAND

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity

to exert an intimidating presence over others.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each

creature of your choice that can see or hear you within

30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw

or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or

until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can

also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what

they are holding when they fail  the saving th row.

EMBODIMENT OF THE  LAW

At 6th level, you  become remarkably adept at channeling

magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using

a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the

spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting,

provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action.

HALO OF SPORES

Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible.

necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash

them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see

moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn

there, you can use your reaction to deal  ld4 necrotic

damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Consti

tution saving throw against your spell save DC. The ne

crotic damage increases to  ld6 at 6th level,  ld8 at 10th

level, and  ldlO at 14th level.

SYMBIOTIC  ENTITY

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into

your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your

Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather

than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4

temporary hit points for each level you have in  this

class. While this feature is active, you gain the follow

ing benefits:

When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll  the

damage die a second time and add it to the total.

Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra ld6 poison

damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for  10 minutes. until you lose all

these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild

Shape again.

RULE TIP:  TEMPORARY HIT  POINTS  DON'T STACK

If you  have temporary hit points and receive more of them,

you  don't add them together, unless a rule says you can.

Instead. you decide which temporary hit  points to keep.

For more information on temporary hit points, see chapter

9 of the Player's Handbook.

FUNGAL INFESTATION

At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a

corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is

Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use

your reaction to animate it, causing ic to stand up imme

diately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the zombie

stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for

1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after

yours. lt obeys your mental commands, and the only

action it can take is the Attack action, making one me

lee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to

your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you re

gain all expended uses of it when you  finish a long rest.

SPREADING SPORES

At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with

deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic

Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet

away. where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute.

The spores disappear early if you use this feature again,

if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbi

otic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts

its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores

damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution

saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can

take this damage no more than once per turn.

While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your

Halo of Spores reaction.

FUNGAL BODY

At 14th level, the fungal spores in your body alter you:

you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned,

and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit

instead, unless you're incapacitated.

CHAPTER 2:  GUILDS  OF RAVNICA

HE TEN GUILDS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF

Ravnica, making up the foundation of its

society. They are voluntary associations led

by guildmasters, but that's the extent of their

resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found on

most DUNGEONS & DRAGONS worlds. They include many

different kinds of organizations:

A government body, the Azorius Senate

A military force, the Boros Legion

An espionage network, House Dimir

An association of raiders, the Gruul Clans

Two scientific research institutions, the lzzet League

and the Simic Combine

An organized crime family.  the Orzhov Syndicate

Raucous performance troupes collectively known as

the Cult of Rakdos, which bends to the whims of a

powerful demon

Two widely divergent groups devoted to nature, the

Golgari Swarm and the Selesnya Conclave

Citizens of Ravnica aren't born into guilds. An individ

ual can choose to belong to any guild-or no guild. Some

guilds, such as Selesnya and Boros, actively recruit new

members, while others simply accept those who seek

membership. People within a family might join different

guilds, which can lead to strong connections between

the guilds in question or to painfu l animosity in families

whose members follow different paths.

Even though citizens can choose their guild associa

tions, long-standing traditions steer certain individuals

toward a particular guild. For example, it would be

highly unusual for a Devkarin elf (a dark elf) to join any

guild other than the Golgari, and the Ordruun line of

minotaurs has provided the Boros armies with gener

ations of offspring. Members of certain races are also

drawn to specific guilds, as noted in the description of

each of guild.

G UILD  M EMBERSHIP

You establish your character's membership in a guild by

choosing that guild's background from among those de

tailed in this chapter. This book assumes that you  have

chosen a guild and that you maintain your association

with it throughout your life. As a  result, your choice of

guild can play a more significant role than most back

grounds do in shaping what your character does now,

not just what you accomplished in the past.

The backgrounds associated with guilds in  this chap

ter work like those in the Player's Handbook, giving

you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested

characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and

flaws). Each guild entry also provides personal contacts;

suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a

list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a

member of a spellcasting class.

GUILD  SPELLS

The spellcasters of Ravnica's guilds have a style of

magic specific to their guild. A guild's description in

cludes a list of guild spells that epitomize the type of

magic the guild favors. The Boros Legion, for example,

tends to prefer using spells of fire magic and holy light,

and its guild spell list reflects that emphasis.

If you play a character who has the Spellcasting or the

Pact Magic class feature, your guild spells are added to

the spell list for your class, thereby expanding the spell

options available to you.

BONDS AND  CONTACT S

As a benefit of your guild membership, you have con

tacts both inside and outside the guild. Contacts are

useful resources in the urban environment of Ravnica,

where a friendly face can be more valuable than gold.

As stated in  the Player's Handbook, bonds represent

your connections to people, places, and events in the

world. Contacts are people you  have a connection to, but

they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if

they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against

your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their

existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in

comparison, are simply people you know. They might be

THE GUILDLESS

The guilds might be considered the heart and soul of

Ravn ica, but they aren't all that makes up the city.  Many

citizens choose not to join a guild-some because they

can't be  bothered, and others because they have philo

sophical  objections to the very  idea of guilds. The so-called

guildless are especially common in  areas that might be

considered rural:  places farther from the heart of the city

and the larger exurban districts.  But even in  the city's

heart, some guildless citizens actively oppose the influ

ence of the guilds.  blaming the world's strife and suffering

on an elite hierarchy that seeks to take control, consolidate

wealth, and fragment a populace against itself.

The numbers of the guildless include people engaged in

a wide variety of trades and  services that aren't managed

and regulated by the guilds,  from  baking to cartography.

University professors, guides, traders, and bartenders

might be guildless. Criminal gangs set themselves  up as

rivals to the Orzhov, and even military forces  operate inde

pendent of guild control, serving as neighborhood police

forces  or mercenaries for hire.

About half of Ravnica's  population  is guild less. That

proportion is  higher for some races than others: nearly

all  elves, for example,  belong to the Golgari,  Selesnya,

or Simic guilds, but a majority of goblins are guildless.

Loxodons tend to have a strong sense of community,  so

they readily join guilds. And when they don't, they join

groups of another sort, such as mercenary companies

or cults. Simic hybrids are all  created within  the Simic

Combine, so it's rare for them not to be part of it.

CHt\f'TFR 2  GUil D~ 01  RAV:-\ICA

29

friends,  rivals, or even family members, but their rela

tionship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.

Although the tables of contacts in this chapter de

scribe nonplayer characters who are members of guilds

(your own and others), you are likely to acquire guildless

contacts as well. NPCs such as goblin gang leaders,

minotaur bartenders. and vedalken tailors all go about

their lives in the shadow of the guilds but divorced from

those groups' intrigue and politics.

STARTING CONTACTS

Your character starts the game with three contacts: an

ally in their guild, a rival  in  their guild, a nd an ally or

rival in another guild. (House Dimir is an exception.)

Tables in each guild section help you determine who

these contacts are- facts that you can build on  by work

ing with your OM  to add some details. The table entries

for contacts are written in  the first person, where "I" is

your character.

You'll roll twice on the Contacts table for your guild,

unless you're in  House Oimir (as explained in that

guild's section). Your first roll gives you an ally. Your sec

ond roll gives you a rival, who might be friendly, jealous,

or antagonistic. (It's possible for these to be the same

person; a single person might be generally friendly to

ward you and simultaneously jealous of your success,

for example.) Then you'll roll once on the table of con

tacts from other guilds. That contact could be either an

ally or a rival, or you  might instead gain a third contact

from your own guild.

R ENOWN

As you advance the goals of your guild through your ad

ventures, you become an increasingly important part of

the guild's activities. You might rise through the ranks,

eventually taking up a position at the right hand of the

guildmaster- or even becoming the master yourself!

Your status in your guild  is measured by your re nown

score. As you increase that score, you gain the opportu

nity to advance in the ranks of the guild.

When you join a guild as a starting character, your

renown score with that gu ild is 1. Your renown score

increases by  1 when you do something to advance

the guild's  interests, assuming that other members of

the guild are aware of what you've done. Each guild's

description in this chapter includes a discussion of its

goals and your role in pursuing those goals, which your

DM will use to judge whether you earn an increase in

your renown score.

The various ranks within the guilds describe the

range of tasks you  might perform, from testing experi

mental Izzet weaponry to leading a squad of Boros sol

diers into battle. When you're assigned a mission that in

volves an adventure- leaving behind your guild holdings

and putting yourself in danger- and you complete that

mission, your renown score with that guild increases by

2. Chapter 4 includes information for  the DM about mis

sions appropriate for your guild.

Other tasks that don't involve adventuring can also im

prove your renown score. You can use the time between

adventures to improve your renown within your guild by

performing these tasks, as well as by socializing with

prominent people in the guild. After doing so for a  total

number of days equal to your current renown score mul

tiplied by 10, your renown score increases by 1.

At your DM's discretion, you might also have a re

nown score in a guild you don't belong to. You can't

ever formally advance in  rank within another guild, but

a high renown score can earn you additional contacts.

favors, and other benefits. This option can be useful

in an intrigue-heavy campaign where the adventurers

spend a lot of time trying to influence the leaders of vari

ous guilds.

BENEFITS OF RENOWN

As you gain renown in a guild, you gain certain benefits.

Most benefits are guild-specific, but there are general

benefits that apply no matter which guild you belong to:

Renown 3 or  Higher. When you have a renown score of

at least 3 with your own guild, you are an established

and respected member of the guild. Other members

of the guild have a friend ly attitude toward you by

default. (Individual members of the guild  might have

reasons to dislike you despite you r renown.) They pro

vide you with lodging and food  in dire circumstances

and pay for your funeral if needed. If you are accused

of a crime, your guild offers legal support, as long as

a good case can be made for your innocence or the

crime was justifiable.

Renown 5 or Higher. When your renown score with

any guild reaches 5, you gain an additional contact

within the guild. This contact might be a character you

met during your adventures or someone who seeks

you out because of your fame. Your DM will assign

you a contact or have you roll on the Contacts table for

the appropriate guild.

Some guilds- notably Azorius, Orzhov, and Boros

have well-defined hierarchies that characters can as

cend through as they improve their renown scores.

Other guilds have positions of honor that characters

can apply for if their renown score is high enough. Not

every member of the Selesnya Conclave aspires to be a

sagittar (an archer assigned to guard an important guild

location), but any character who meets the prerequisites

can apply for the position. Ultimately, the DM decides

whether a character qualifies for such a role, with acer

tain renown score as a minimum requirement.

Several guilds provide a salary among the benefits

of renown within the guild. The salary is described as

sufficient to maintain a lifestyle of a certain level. If you

earn a salary, you can live at the specified lifestyle with

out paying the normal daily expenditure. See chapter 5

of the Player's Handbook for more information on life

style expenses.

A prominent position in a guild often allows you to

call on the services of lower-ranking members to assist

you in your work. When you do, they are assumed to be

loyal followers who help you to the best of their ability.

Some of them are assigned to help you for the duration

of a single task or mission, while others are under your

permanent command, staffing a laboratory, workshop,

or garrison where you are in charge. Depending on their

role, they might help you in dangerous situations (like

combat) or fl ee from them. You  might assign them to

perform tasks in your absence, which could includ e un

de rtaking research. looking for witnesses to a c rime, or

carrying out a small-scale raid, for example, depending

on their role and capabilities. You carry the respons i

bility for th eir lives and welfare, ul timately, and if th e

guild decides that you are abus ing your authority and

mistreating the members beneath you. you mig ht lose

renown. lose your rank or status in the guild, or even be

cast out of the guild.

LOSI NG  R ENOWN

If you commit a serious offense against you r guild or its

members, you  might lose renown within the guild. The

extent of the loss depends on the in fra ction and is left

to the DM's discretion. A character's renown score with

a guild can never drop below 0. If you r renown score

drops below the threshold for a rank or privilege you

have attained, you  lose that benefit. Even  if you  regain

the lost renown, you might find  it more difficult to again

secure a position or rank you  have previously lost.

STYLES  OF MEMBERSHIP

As you're playing a characte r associated with one of the

guilds, think about your character's relationship with

the guild. Guild members can be grouped into four cat

egories, depending on their motivations and priorities:

loyalists, opportunists, rebels, and anomalies. Which

one of these descriptions best fits your characte r?

Loyalists join a guild because they firmly believe in

the guild's ideals and want to advance its goals. Their

membership in the guild is a badge of identity for them.

They're typi cally of the races and classes most strongly

associated with the guild, and thei r personality traits

and ideals fall  in  line with the suggestions in  this chap

ter. An  idealistic human or a  minotaur paladin in  the

Boros Legion  is an example of a loyalist.

Opportunis ts join a guild based on what they can

gain from becoming members. Every guild offers its

members something-whether concrete benefits such as

opportunities for wealth or more subtle, intangible re

wa rds such as social status- and getting that something

is the primary motivation for this type of character. Op

portunists often pay lip service to the ideals and goals of

the guild,  looking out for themselves first and the guild

second (at best). A selfis h human fighter who uses mem

bership in the Boros Legion as an excuse to bully and

steal from others would be a n opportunist.

Rebels love the guilds they're in but don't conform to

gu ild expectations. They might be good-hearted idealists

trying to bend a shady guild towa rd  nobler pursuits, or

th ey might be selfish egotists hoping to direct the guild's

actions toward promoting their own interests. Most re b

els are typica l members of the guild in terms of race and

class, but they vary from type when it  comes to p erson

alities and ideals. A Boros legionnaire with  tyrannical

tendencies who th inks the Boros should enforce justice

with an iron  fist  would be a rebel.

Anomalies a re individua ls who join guilds contrary

to a ll  expectations. Their race or class (or both) is out

side the norm for their guild, but their personalities

and ideals fall  perfectly in  line; that's why they joined.

A vedalken paladin in the Boros Legion, or an Ordruun

minotaur in  the Orzhov Syndicate, would fall  into

this category.

MEM BERSHI P  A N D  I NDEPENDENCE

Some adventurers do exactly what th ey're told, spending

their careers doing the bidding of their guild s uperiors.

Most adventuring characters, though, prefer more inde

pendence. You can roll  a d6 or choose from the options

in  the table below to establis h a reason for the freedom

enjoyed by your character.

d6  Reason for Independence

I've been  around long enough that my guild lets me

do what I want.

I've been chosen for special assignments because I' m

just that good.

I've been  singled out for special assignments because

somebody up the ranks hates me.

CHANGING  GUILDS

If events  in your character's adventuring career war

rant it, you can abandon membership in one guild and

join a different one. Once you leave a guild, you can

ra rely go back.

Your DM decides what req uirements you must meet to

join a new guild. Some guilds welcome new recruits and

ma ke the process as simple as possible, while others

requi re a demonstration of loyalty.

When you change guilds, you  lose a ll  the privileges of

membership in your original guild, including the back

ground feature granted to you by your original guild and

any rank or position you  have achieved  in  that guild.

You a lso lose access to your old guild spells, unless they

are already on you r class's spell list, among your spells

known. or in you r spellbook. Except in exceptional cir

cumstances, your renown score with your original guild

becomes 0.

Your old guild expects you to return your guild insig

nia, and your new guild gives you one to replace it.

You  gain the privileges of membership in your new

guild. These include the background feature granted by

you r new guild, a lthough you r DM might decide that it

takes you a while to gain the full  benefit. For example,

a character who leaves another guild to join the Gruul

Clans doesn't immediately know th e ways of the rubble

belts, but has to gain that familiarity over time. You  a lso

gain access to you r new guild spells.

Your new guild doesn't give you any benefits that

assume prior knowledge or experience, including profi

ciencies. starti ng equipme nt (except your guild insignia),

and contacts.

CHAPTER

Ull OS  OJ  RA\  NJCA

11

The j elenn Column writes and enacts the laws of

Ravnica, involving the efforts not just of the designated

legislators but also a network of bureaucrats: aides, writ

ers, researchers, lobbyists, clerks, and so on.

The Lyev Column enforces the law as Ravnica's

police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev

Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, and

lawmages. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the

work of managing surveillance and precognition. Most

adventuring characters, by their nature and because of

their capabilities, are associated with the active work

of the Lyev Column rather than the behind-the-scenes

activity of the other columns.

GOALS  OF  T H E A ZORIUS

The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of

society. They want to protect the people of Ravnica and

foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's

values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates.

Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the

highest virtue is a society built on stability and order,

and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured

to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the

expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a

benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check,

but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force

that stifles freedom and expression.

In the absence of the Living Guildpact, the Azorius are

uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among

the guilds. As a group, they are convinced that the sys

tem can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the

reality that the one person who is meant to hold their

world together never seems to be around. The Azorius

Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing

frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wield

ing an ever-growing amount of influence.

The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican

society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civiliza

tion can be saved only through the guidance of a strong,

safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius,

the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time

to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the

people and preserve the force of law.

The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as

their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the

Gruul Clans and imposed a variety of creatively written

laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public

places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical

seem out of place: her cape spilled elegant!Y from her of

ficer 's armor, her sword shone like a decorative piece one

would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals

displayed her district-spanning rank.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Bringing order from chaos- that is the mission of the

Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted

and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble,

transforming Ravnica into a field of rubble where the

Gruul and the Rakdos do whatever they please. The

Azorius carry tnis weighty responsibility with stoic

pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investi

gation, and enforcement with steely determination.

The first guild master of the Azorius Senate was a

sphinx named Azor.  He was the author of the original

Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate con

tingency plan that resulted in the creation of the Living

Guildpact. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on

his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.

INSIDE THE  SENATE

The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches,

called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a

capital). The capitals of the three columns form the

Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, Supreme

Judge Isperia, an ancient and wise sphinx.

The Sova Column consists of judges and the exten

sive legal apparatus surrounding them. It is tasked with

adjudicating and arbitrating the effects of the law. The

column employs legal aides, pages, librarians, experts

on precedent, advocates for  the accused, public prosecu

tors, and judges.

shows of the Rakdos (in part because the Azorius are

frequently ridiculed by Rakdos performers) and attempt

to curb them with new decrees about public perfor

mances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge

their way around the system, the Azorius routinely cre

ate new laws  to support or countermand old ones.

A ZORIUS  CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually lawful, often neutral

Suggested Races : Human, vedalken

Suggested Classes: Bard, cleric, fighter. paladin, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the

Azorius Senate if one or more of the following state

ments are true:

You're drawn to the idea of a hard-bitten police officer

trying to impose order on a chaotic world.

You like the idea of using magic to control enemies.

You like playing enchanter wizards, clerics of law, or

unbending paladins.

j OINING THE AZORIUS  SENATE

As a recruit to the Azorius Senate, you were quickly

immersed in the law. You might have clerked for a judge

or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of

law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to

patrol the streets and enforce the law. As your training

comes to an end and your adventuring career begins,

you must decide whether to focus on law enforcement

or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of

the senate.

LAW ENFORCEMENT

Most Azorius adventurers belong to the gu ild's police

force. They are soldiers or spellcasters who patrol the

city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping

them in  progress. If you want to pursue a career in law

enforcement, choose the path of the Iawmage,  the pre

cognitive mage, or the arrester.

Lawmages. As a spellcaster in  the Azorius Senate,

you use your magic to compel or restrain malefactors

and scofflaws (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the

School of Enchantment). You might also use your magic

to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders

from  harm (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the

School of Abjuration or as a cleric of the Order Domain,

which is described in chapter 1). In any case, you're

called a lawmage, and you can aspire to the title of jus

ticiar and then deputy as your standing within the guild

increases.

Precognitive Mages. If you are a spellcaster with

some ability to glimpse the future (perhaps a wizard

specialized in the School of Divination or a cleric of the

Knowledge Domain), you can use this ability to try to

prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive

mage. These mages occupy a small  niche on the periph

ery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureau

cratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance

through the same ranks as lawmages.

Arresters. As a martial character, you can serve as an

arrester in the Azorius Senate. You  might be a fighter (of

any martial archetype) or a paladin who has sworn the

Oath of Vengeance, for example. Arresters maintain the

peace by removing threats-both actual and potential

identified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and

occasionally alerts from the precognitive mages. As you

gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted

to the rank of officer or imperator.

BUREAUCRACY

Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure,

but it is possible to immerse yourself in the life of a civil

servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventur

ous life. You  might be a mild-mannered judge's clerk or

scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events

beyond your control, or you might moonlight as a vigi

lante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold.

Or you  could serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.

Elocutors. As a skilled orator and diplomat (perhaps

a bard of the College of Lore), you can put your talents

to use in the guild as an elocutor. The Azorius are

known for their measured, patient speech, and the elo

cutors are the primary voice through which the senate

communicates with the other guilds and the people of

Ravnica. Thus, you  might serve as an emissary from  the

Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or ter

ritorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like.

You might have the task of securing the support of key

senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty.

Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the

rank of scribe or emissary.

BACKGROUND: AZORIUS

FUNCTIONARY

The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the

only thing standing in  the way of disaster is the founda

tion of law and order- as embodied in  the Azorius Sen

ate. You're a proud member of the Azorius guild, which

both enacts and enforces the laws that make Ravnican

society function smoothly and safely.

Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Intimidation

Languages: Two of your choice

Equipment: An Azorius insignia, a scroll containing the

text of a law important to you, a bottle of blue ink, a

pen, a set of fine clothes. and a belt pouch containing

10 gp (Azorius-minted 1-zino coins)

FEATURE:  LEGAL AUTHORITY

You have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica,

and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and

even fear in the populace. People mind  their manners in

your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they as

sume you  have the right to be wherever you are. Show

ing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with

anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more

problems than it solves when you're dealing with incor

rigible lawbreakers). lf you abuse this privilege, though,

you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and

even be stripped of your position.

The Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy, and

people in a variety of positions throughout the guild

can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the

guild's role in making and enforcing laws for the entire

city, your place in the Azorius can easily bring you into

contact with members of other guilds, for good or ill.

How Do I FIT IN?

As a member of the Azorius  Senate, you are probably

engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your

background involved the legislative or judicial aspects

of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges'

clerks find  little reason to venture beyond the Azo

rius guildhalls. but soldiers and lawmages patrol the

streets daily.

An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a  force for order,

c harged with fighting crime on the streets-and in  the

hal Is of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts,

putting a  stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir

spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you

take your orders from a  precognitive mage (or you are

one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic

visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try

to prevent.

AN AZORIUS PARTY

An adventuring party made up entirely of Azorius mem

bers could  be a  specialized team dedicated to law en

forcement. A soldier (a  fighter or paladin) and a  lawmage

(wizard) would form the core of the party, supported

by a  precognitive mage (cleric) who helps direct their

missions. An elocutor (bard) could  round out the party,

serving as the group's negotiator and spokesperson.

R AN K  AN D  R ENOWN

By gaining renown as a  member of the Azorius Senate,

you can advance within the guild. Promotion through

the ranks requires the approval of a  superior officer.

Advancement is a  reward for services rendered to the

guild, rather than an automatic consequence of in

creased re nown.

R ANK 1:  O FFICIAL

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in  the Azorius Senate

Your specific title depends on your role in  the guild:

If you are a Jawmage or a  precognitive mage, you

assume the title of justiciar.

If you are an arrester. you become an officer.

If you are a  bureaucrat (including an elocutor). you

become a scribe.

THREE CAPITA L S

The heads of the three columns of the Azorius Senate are

called arbiters or capitals.

The arbiter of the Sova Column  (the judiciary) is Leonos

II, a wise and kind  human judge and lawmage who takes

pains to consider all  perspectives before issuing a judg

ment-even the perspectives of the spirits of the dead,

with whom he can communicate.  He  is  patient and utterly

loyal to the guild.

The )elenn Column  (the legislature)  is  led  by a vedalken

lawmage named Uzana, renowned for a nearly perfect

memory. She has memorized every statute of Azorius law,

and much of her speech is  quotations from  those statutes.

The hussar commander Agmand Sarvis the arbiter of

the Lyev Column, the senate's law enforcement branch.

Despite the fact that he has never been in  combat, he has

earned a reputation as a brilliant military strategist. His

tactical genius is  unquestioned, but his lack of battle expe

rience did cause some controversy among the soldiers and

lawmages of the Lyev Column when  he was appointed to

be its head.

As an Azorius official. you can call  on recruits (use

the soldie r  stat block in chapter 6) to perform mundane

tasks and errands for you,  but they will  not accompany

you into dangerous circumstances.

No Azorius official lives in poverty. Between adven

tures, you earn a salary that supports you at a modest

lifestyle.

RANK 2 : AUTHORITY

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown  10 or higher in  the

Azorius Senate

Your new title depends on your previous role as an offi

cial in the Azorius Senate:

If you are a justiciar, you become a deputy with a

specific title. such as Deputy of Acquittals. Deputy of

Indictment, Deputy of Deposition. Deputy of Arraign

ment, or Deputy of Arbitration.

If you are an officer, you become an imperator.

If you are a scribe, you become an emissary.

You are recognized as an authority in your field. You

gain an Azorius charm (described in chapter  5) at the

start of each mission you undertake on the guild's be

half. At the start of any such mission, you can secure

the assistance of a squad of ld4 arresters (use the sol

d ier stat block in chapter 6) plus one lawm a ge  (also in

chapter 6). These individuals remain with you until the

mission ends.

Between adventures, you earn enough money pur

suing your duties to support yourself at a comfortable

lifestyle.

RANK 3:  MINIST ER, jUDCE ,  OR SENATOR

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the

Azorius Senate

Your new title depends on your broader interests as they

relate to one of the three columns of the Azorius Senate,

not on the titles you bore as an official and an authority:

If your interests lie in law enforcement, you become

a  minister within the Lyev Column. You  receive a

3G

<'llAl'l f  R  2  Gt.II DS  Of  RA\  'Iii  A

specific title, such as Minister of Impediments or Min

ister of Fallacies.

If your interests concern the judiciary, you  become a

judge within the Sova Column.

If you want a position on the legislative body of the

jelenn Column, you become a senator.

Regardless of your specific title, you can secure the

aid of up to 3d4 s oldiers and one or two lawmages (see

chapter 6 fo r these stat blocks) whenever you set out on

a guild-approved mission.

Between adventures, your responsibilities to the

guild-including supervising arresters, judging legal

cases, or writing laws- earns you enough money to sup

port yourself at a wealthy lifestyle.

RANK 4 : ARBITER

Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the

Azorius Senate

As an a rbiter (or capital), you serve as the head of your

column. Only Isperia, the Supreme judge, can appoint

you  to this position, and only if one of the three existing

arbiters leaves her service.

As an arbiter, all the resources of your column are at

your disposal, and you have the ear of lsperia as a mem

ber of her advisory Triumvirate. You also keep the salary

you earned as a minister, judge, or senator, sustaining a

wealthy lifestyle between adventures.

ENEMI ES  AND ALLIES

As fa r as the Azorius a re concerned, every other guild

in Ravnica is hastening along the road to anarchy. Even

other guilds that are inclined toward order (such as the

Boros, Orzhov, and Selesnya) are ignoring or exploit

ing the law.

You participate in  missions to thwart the criminals of

other guilds, from overzealous Boros vigilantes to insid

ious Golgari assassins. Dimir spies, Orzhov extortion

ists, and bloodthirsty Rakdos performers keep Azor ius

peacekeepers busy enough, without the added compli

cations of reckless Izzet and Simic experiments putting

the citizenry in danger.

Of course, whenever the members of another guild

decide to operate within the law, they are potential allies

for  the Azorius. Even some members of the Cult of Rak

dos can be pragmatic enough to stifle their impu lses for

a time in order to join forces against a common enemy.

TH E A ZORIU S V I EW  O N  O THER GUI LDS

Because of its authoritari an,  overreaching grasp, the

Azorius Senate 's  relation ships with other guilds are rarely

positive. Azorius members tend to view members of other

guilds as dangerous threats to order, while other guild

members see the Azorius as rigid and tyrannical.

Boros. "Their vigilantism is tremendously dangerous with

out a hand to control it."

Dimir. "A perenn ial  thorn in our side. Though they were

once our greatest  foes,  not even the masters of espio

nage can hide from our watchful eyes."

Golgari. "Their underground structures break numerous

building regu lations, but at least they fulfi ll thei r duties

as garbage collectors."

Gruul. "The Gruul are dangerous anarchists with no inter

est in furtheri ng the development of civilization. They

serve no useful purpose."

lzzet. "Eccentri c and occasionally explosive, but generally

harmless,  for now. In their paranoia they have enlarged

their weapon stockpiles,  but they lack the clarity of vision

to put them to use."

Orzhov. "Their brazen exploitation of our laws wi ll  be thei r

downfall. They are an insidious threat that could tear

soci ety apart from the inside."

Rakdos. "An absolute blight on Ravnica. They are clowns

who know nothing of cu lture and exist only to torment

the function ing m em bers of society."

Selesnya. "The Conclave plays  by the rules and keeps to

itself.  Until its members  become too numerous, they are

of little threat to us."

Simic. "The Simic experiment with  matters that disobey

the laws of nature and the laws of Ravnica. We  must not

let them gain influence."

form the bulk of the legion's angelic warriors.

From the pers pective of the average Boros soldier,

mortal soldiers gain admission into the presence of the

Wherever criminals exploit others, petty tyrants make

grabs for power, or violence erupts and leaves devas

tation in its wake,  Boros soldiers are there fighting to

make things right.

The Boros Legion  is defined by the tension between

its goal of establis hing order and harmony and the fiery

zeal that drives many of its members. The guild stands

for  peace and justice, which can be established only

through the rule of law. Its moral stance is fundamen

tally good, as it strives to protect the innocent and pow

erless from oppression and exploitation. At the same

time, members of the legion are passionate about their

pursuit of justice, spurred by their righteous wrath into

action against evil a nd injustice. lronicaJly, this means

that individual members sometimes break the rules they

are charged with enforcing, cleaving to the spirit of the

law when the letter no longer serves justice.

massive-shouldered plate armor led a battalion of soldiers,

the symbol of the Boros Legion emblazoned on white cloth

draped over their armor. Their soldiers were a variety of

races. including humans, a minotaur with a permanent

scowl on her face,  an impatient-looking goblin. and even

some kind of humanoid.fire elemental. whose Boros armor

floated in protective positions over its animate flame.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Clad in shining armor and fueled by righteous zeal, the

soldiers of the Boros Legion take up steel against the

corruption and lawlessness that gnaw at the soul of

Ravnica. Combining the force of law with the military

strength to back it up,  the Boros work to forge Ravnica

into a just society, a safe and hea lthy community for

all.  From garrisons throughout the sprawling city, dis

ciplined, stalwart soldiers a re dispatched to stand fi rm

against Cruul ra ids, Dimir infiltration, Golgari corrup

tion, and the subtle influence of more nefarious foes.

The archangel  Razia was the original guild.master of

the Boros Legion, which was established to serve as

Ravnica's standing army. Razia served as its guildmas

ter for almost ten  thousand years. Legend says that all

the other a ngels of Ravnica were created in the image of

this semidivine figure, and her death was devastating to

the guild. Aurelia, the current angelic guildmaster, is the

third to hold that title.

I N SIDE T H E  L EGION

Angels occupy the highest tier of the Boros hierarchy,

from the guildmaster Aurelia down to the hosts of

holy warriors and advisors in leadership roles. Their

opinions and advice a re deeply respected in the guild,

though the angels aren't above engaging in the machi

nations of mortal politics. The angels include the wise,

for weeks or months at a time, the legion is in a height

ened state of vigilance. In this time of uncertainty, the

Boros are on constant alert for military threats. They

work to maintain their fortifications to ensure that they

aren't overrun by Gruul marauders. Construction pro

ceeds on  new strongholds near Gruul territories, but in

general the Boros prepare for a military threat the same

way they always have- by fielding the stronger army.

The angels are also bracing for a subtler threat:  the

danger of infiltration by House Dimir. The Boros are

becoming increasingly aware of the possibility that their

guild could be undermined from within. Security at

garrison buildings is vigilant, with angels watching the

entrances at all times for spies.

BOROS  CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually good, often lawful

Suggested Races: Human, goblin, minotaur

Suggested Classes: Cleric,  fighter, paladin,

ranger, wi zard

Consider  the Boros Legion for your character if one or

more of the following sentences ring true:

You are drawn to the ideal of the knight in

shining armor.

You like playing clerics, paladins, or

disciplined fighters.

Smiting foes with holy radiance fills you with

righteous joy.

You want to protect the innocent and fight for justice.

JOINING THE BOROS  LEGION

As a new recruit to the Boros L egion, you were sent to

the prestigious Horizon Military Academy for training.

Your life ther e was tempered in the forge of B oros dis

cipline, devotion, and zeal. Your training regimen was

deliberately harsh, to weed out the uncommitted. You

lasted to the end. and now you begin your adventuring

career ready to put everything you have learned to use

in the legion's service.  Depending on whether you fo.

cused on martial training, studied magic, or pursued

both courses, your path will look somewhat different.

MARTIAL TRAINING

The bulk of the Boros Legion consists of human, mi

notaur, and goblin soldiers. If you  ar e a fighter, ranger,

or even a barbarian, you'll fit right in among the ranks,

with a promising career path ahead of you- promo

tion through the ranks, with opportunities for special

assignments.

Another option is to join the swiftblades, the vanguard

of the Boros L egion. They specialize in assault and

occupation, and their squads often function as com

mandos or guerrillas. They pick off enemy archers and

mages, softening the enemy's front lines before the rest

of the legion marches in.

MAGICAL STUDY

If you are spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in

the School of Evocation or a cleric of the Light Domain),

you can find a place as a combat mage in the Boros

Legion, called an embermage. These mages use spells

of fire and light to clear the way for  the legion's com-

bat troops.

If you  prefer healing magic over the explosive magic

of the embermages (perhaps as a cleric of the Life or the

Light Domain), you can become a medic. These combat

healers are an essential part of Boros operations, using

a combination of magic and mundane medicine to close

wounds and restore strength.

MILITARY MAGIC

If you are a paladin who swears the Oath of Devotion,

a fighter of the Eldritch Knight archetype, or a cleric of

the War Domain, you can combine the martial training

of a soldier with magic and call yourself a firefist. Fueled

by a  healthy dose of righteous zeal, firefists command a

great deal of respect in the Boros Legion.

BACKGROUND:  BOROS  LEGIONNAIRE

As a  member of the Boros Legion, your life is devoted

to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of

establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica.

You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of

the angels, moved  by the plight of the downtrodden, and

devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic

in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed

in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the per

suasion of a charismatic recruiter's lofty promises, or

were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action.

Skill Proficien cies: Athletics, Intimidation

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set

Languages: Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin,

or Minotaur

Equipment: A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel's

wing, a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souve-

nir from a famous battle), a set of common clothes,

and a belt pouch containing 2 gp (Boros-minted

1-zino coins)

FEATURE:  LEGION STATION

You have an established place in the hierarchy of the

Boros Legion. You can requisition simple equipment for

temporary use, and you can gain access to any Boros

garrison in  Ravnica, where you can rest in safety and

receive the attention of medics. You are also paid a sal

ary of 1 gp (a Boros-minted 1-zino coin) per week, which

(combined with free lodging in your garrison) enables

you to maintain a poor lifestyle between adventures.

CHAPfl' R 2  I  GUILDS OF  RA\ NICA

.p

How Do I FIT IN?

As a  member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the

orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels

tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do,

to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of

independence, it's  either because you have proven your

self capable of working without close supervision or be

cause you're a  rebellious sort who is willing to disobey

orders now and face the consequences later.

As a soldier on the street, you a re  tasked with bring

ing dangerous threats  like  the Rakdos and the Gru ul

in line. You  might contend with Rakdos performances

gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying

neighborhoods, s hipments of rot-infested vegetation

from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among

the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry

about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, over

zealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at

the expense of justice. Izzet experiments leveling city

blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laborato

ries and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.

A  BOROS  PARTY

An adventuring party drawn entirely from the ranks of

the Boros Legion would be a small military strike force,

probably focused on combat but also strong on social in

teraction. One or two soldiers (fighters), a  medic (cleric),

and an embermage (wizard) would form the core of

Tajic is a firefist who carries the exalted title of Blade of

the Legion,  putting him just below the angels in  rank.  He

maintains close communication with Aurelia, though re

cent events in  the city have set them at odds. Tajic believes

that the Boros can trust only the Boros.  He is convinced

that any effort at peace among the guilds is doomed to

failure without the Guildpact. The Boros, he  argues, would

be better off spending their energy to make themselves

stronger so they can uphold the fragile  balance that exists

now-and protect the innocent when the balance tilts.

Aurelia feels that his negative attitude runs the risk of poi

soning the hearts of the other Boros and undermining any

peace efforts.  For the most part, in deference to the angel,

Tajic keeps his views  to himself.

that strike  force. A firefist (paladin) would be a strong

addition, or might replace a  fighter or a cleric. A lightly

armored swiftblade (ranger) could help the group in situ

ations involving s tealth or exploration.

RANK AND RENOWN

By gaining renown as a  member of the Boros Legion.

you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks

within the guild. Promotion always requires the ap

proval of a superior officer. It is a  reward for services

rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic conse

quence of increased renown.

In addition, certain positions become available to you

when both your renown and your character level reach

certain thresholds.

12

f!lt,\l'IFl<'l

f,Ullll'>OI  R~\'Jll..\

RANK 2:  BRIGADIER

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the

Boros Legion

As a brigadier, you are responsible for missions and

strategies that you can't execute entirely on your own

or with the aid of a handfu l of soldiers. After receiving

goals handed down from the captain above you, it's

your job to figure out the tactics needed to accomplish

those goals.

You lead a brigade that consists of six squads, each

made up of fou r soldiers commanded by a sergeant (use

the soldier stat block in chapter 6 to represent them).

If you are also a skyknight, at least one of these squads

is made up of other skyknights, which are s oldiers

mounted on Skyjek roes (see chapter 6 for these stat

blocks). You can assign these squads to tasks of your

choosing with in the area of the city where you have au

thority. You can also lead these soldiers into battle your

self, or bring one squad a nd its sergeant with you on a

guild mission.

At this rank, you gain a Boros charm (described in

chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on

the guild's behalf.  You continue to receive a salary suffi

cient to maintain a modest lifestyle, but your quarters in

the garrison are more spacious.

RANK 1:  SERGEANT

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Boros Legion

At this rank, you gain some authority over lower-rank

ing soldiers. When you undertake a mission on the

guild's behalf that requires military strength, a squad of

ld4 soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) accompa

nies and assists you  for the du ration of the mission.

Your salary at this rank is enough to maintain a mod

est lifestyle, including private quarters in the garrison.

SKYKNIGHT (SPECIAL RoLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher in the Boros Legion,

5th level or higher

Skyknights mounted on Skyjek roes patrol the skies

above Ravnica-a regular reminder of the Boros and

their concern for justice. If you meet the prerequisites,

you can become a skyknight, assuming no official ob

jects. You are assigned a Skyjek roe (see chapter 6 for

the stat block) to use as a mount when carrying out your

guild responsibilities. Using the roe for personal mat

ters is a significant violation of regulations.

WOJEK (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher in the Boros Legion,

5th level or higher

If you  meet the prerequisites, you can apply to join the

elite soldiers of the Wojek League. This special order

serves as a combination of military police and military

intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence

within the guild. Its members scout the activities of

other guilds to assess their military strength and predict

potential threats, and they sometimes activate squads

to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The

Wojeks also help the angels root out spies and leaks

within the legion. Secondarily, the Wojek League is

responsible for policing the ranks of the legion. When

members get carried away by their zeal and break the

law or abuse their authority, the Wojeks take on the

tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing

the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the

legion disappear (involuntarily or otherwise),

Wojek agents are typically the ones called

to investigate.

You can be both a skyknight and a

member of the Wojek League, gain

ing the title of S kyjek.

SUNHOME GUARD  (SPECIAL R OLE)

Prerequisite: Renown JO or higher in the Boros Legion.

7th level or higher

Members of the Sun home Guard are responsible for

the defense of Sun home, the Boros guildhall in  the

Tenth District. Only those who have proven themselves

in combat are selected to join this force. If you are ac

cepted into the S u nhome Guard, your missions will  be

primarily defensive in nature. You  might receive orders

to find new ways to fortify the guildhall or to detect Di

mir agents and other spies who try to gain access. Of

course, given these chaotic times, you could end up de

fending Sunhome from an all-out attack by the Gruul or

some other enemy force.

RANK 3:  CAPTAIN

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the

Boros Legion

As a captain in the Boros Legion, you gain command of

a small garrison and the responsibility for maintaining

order and protecting people in part of a city district. You

have four brigades unde r your command. As described

for rank 3, each brigade has six squads of five soldiers

(including a sergeant) reporting to them. One additional

squad of 2d4 soldiers is your personal retinue.

You  regularly receive communications from warleader

angels who coordinate the efforts of the smaller garri

sons. They keep you informed of the goals and concerns

of the legion's mortal and angelic leaders and can help

you address them. You are then responsible for giving

orders to your brigadiers, and you must answer to your

commander for the troops' success or failure in achiev

ing the guild's strategic goals.

As a captain. your salary allows you to maintain a

comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

RANK 4:  COMMANDER

Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the

Boros Legion

As a commander, you assume the leadership of one

of the major garrisons of the Boros Legion: Kamen

Fortress, Horizon Military Academy, or the great flying

garrison called Parhelion Il, which moves from  place to

place to deploy reinforcements to Boros troops around

Ravnica. lf you are already a  member of the Sunhome

Guard, you could instead be placed in command of

that elite force, leading all the  non-angelic forces

ofSunhome.

In this role, you are advised- and ordered around- by

angels. You are in regular communication with Guild

master Aurelia, who places you in charge of a major

guild in itiative. You  might be tasked with improving

recruitment, developing a  plan for dealing with Dimir in

filtration, or collaborating with the Izzet to develop new

weaponry for Boros soldiers.

You continue to draw a salary sufficient to maintain a

comfortable lifestyle.

THE  BOROS VIEW ON  OTHER GUI LDS

The Boros are committed to justice and order, and they are

convinced that virtually every other guild is just as com

mitted to undermining both. Therefore, the Boros rely only

on their comrades for support and view everyone else with

suspicion or disdain.

Azorius. "Legalism. Arrogance.  Hot air. The law  in  their

hands is a bludgeon, and they use it to seize more power

than they deserve."

Dimir. "Snakes lurking in  the shadows. They should be

rooted out so they can shrivel in  the light."

Golgari. "lfthey limited themselves to their intended pur

pose, repulsive as it is, they could be allowed to survive.

But they are growing into a dangerous menace, and we

need to Au sh them out of the sewers while we still can."

Gruul. "They are lost in  violence and savagery. Only occa

sionally can their energy be channeled in  directions that

benefit the greater good."

lzzet. "They don't understand the concept of limits. If they

kept their spellcraft under control,  they could truly ben

efit society."

Orzhov. "The Orzhov care only about the Orzhov.  lfit

were up to them, all  of Ravnica would  follow an orderly

process designed to funnel wealth into their grasp-

ing hands.''

Rakdos. "They make destruction into a spectacle, but

they're more than blood and fire. They're termites gnaw

ing away at the heart and soul of Ravnica."

Selesnya. "I  almost envy the naivete that leads them to re

treat into their little communes and  pretend they've built

a just society."

Simic. "They have stepped out of their place, with all

their experiments, their tinkering with the nature of life.

They're a waste, a drain on  Ravnica, and a danger to the

public good."

ENEMIES AND ALLIES

In general, the Boros find some common ground with

other guilds that value order and structure: Azorius,

Selensya, and (to a lesser extent) Orzhov. The Rakdos,

Gruul, and Jzzet might share the zeal and energy of

the Boros, but they represent the more chaotic aspect

of those qualities, which threatens the stability of

all Ravnica.

The legion is dedicated to combating the influence of

Oimir spies and infiltrators, containing the brutal chaos

of the Rakdos. and halting the schemes of the Golgari.

But any guild can become an enemy of Boros if its aims

and activities lead to crime, chaos, injustice, or harm to

the innocent citizens of Ravnica. Even the Azorius can

become so obsessive in creating and enforcing laws that

they overreach the bounds of justice.

Conversely, any guild can offer you allies in your quest

for justice. Distasteful as they might be, even the Gruul

and the Rakdos can play a  part in curtailing threats to

the city that also impede their own incerests.

HOUSE  DIMIR

A VAMPIRE APPEARED OUT OF THE DARKNESS, AS Q.UIET

as a breeze.  He was stripped to the waist despite the chill

underground. and his eyes reflected light like a cat's.  He

floated effortlessly down from  the upper reaches of the

chamber. and alighted on the chamberfloor near the

two of them.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

House Dimir is Ravnica's dark secret: behind a facade

of respectable messengers and reporters lurks an

association of spies and assassins whose existence is

barely suspected by the populace at large. Secrecy is

both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defense,

and much of the guild's work is hidden even  from other

members. Oimir agents leave no trace of their covert

activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their

crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any

evidence of th eir completed assignments.

The first guild master of House Dimir was a vampire

named Szadek, whose organization agreed to serve as

Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians.

But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering

information to build a vast spy network, and before long,

the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its

overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the

shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its exis

tence. An immortal entity, Szadek ruled the guild for ten

thousand years until he was arrested and kHled in the

turmoil of the Decamillennial Celebration.

INSIDE THE  HOUSE

House Dimir has a clandestine aspect hidden from all

but its most important members. The guild master, La

zav. and his direct contacts guide and manipulate the

covert operations of the guild. Members of House Dimir

ultimately receive their orders from this source without

having any idea of who issued the order or why. Mes

sages to agents are funneled through thought strands

(see '"Spell: Encode Thoughts" later in this section) and

telepathic couriers.

By design, you don't have much interaction with other

members of your guild. You  might never meet your pri

mary guild contact face to face,  instead receiving assign

ments and sending reports by way of secret message

drops and codes.

GOALS  OF THE  D IMIR

House Dimir is all about secrets and misinformation,

even where its own members are concerned. Any given

Dimir agent knows of no more than a handful of alley

way contacts and dossier drop spots. One agent knows

another only by a code name, or receives communica

tions only at a particular meeting spot at a specific place

and time.  Every self-proclaim ed expert with an opinion

on the matter has a theory about the guild's intentions,

and all those guesses about Dimir's motivations and

pursuits contradict each  other, frustrating any attempt

to get to the truth of things. The public face of Dimir

remains inscrutable, which some interpret as the best

evidence that the guild's true plans mean something

dire for the Ravnican populace.

To House  Oimir, knowledge is power. The guild

hungers to learn everything it doesn't already know,

especially the weaknesses of its adversaries, and to ex

ploit those weaknesses for its own gain. Conversely, the

house holds its own secrets tightly, because it doesn't

want its enemies to turn the tables. The Dimir lurk in

the shadows, methodically gathering the knowledge

they need to remake Ravnica to their advantage.

House Dimir's progress toward its goals depends on

a web woven  from meticulously gathered intelligence.

Unpredictable behavior by other guilds can destabilize

that web. When the Boros take sudden. forceful action

inspired by an unexpected burst of zeal, the Dimir can

be caught off guard. The Selesnya behave predictably on

the whole, but the members of the conclave are so nu

merous that it can be hard for the Oimir to keep track of

their activities. Of all the other guilds, the Izzet and the

Gruul concern the Dimir the most; thei r erratic methods

of decision-making, combined with their unflinching

approach to danger, can quickly undermine any Dimir

strategy designed to contain them.

DIMIR CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually neutral, sometimes evil

Suggested Races: Half-elf,  human

Suggested Classes: Monk, rogue, wizard

If the following sentences describe you, you might enjoy

playing a character who belongs to House Dimir:

You love subterfuge, intrigue, and deception.

You like to play rogues, spies, and assassins.

The idea of stealing thoughts instead of treasure bas a

special appeal to you.

You want to deceive your fellow players without neces

sarily betraying them.

j OINING  HOUSE  DI MIR

You  began your career in  House Dimir as part of the

legion of shopkeepers, librarians, couriers, and traders

who maintain the deception that the guild has become

civil and tame. Without any exposure to the guild's more

covert activities, you helped to discredit those who be

lieve that the Dimir are plotting to control the city, paint

ing them as delusional conspiracy theorists. But at some

point your gifts were recognized and you were invited

into the deeper mysteries of the guild. Your training fo

cused on stealth, espionage, and infiltration. As a Dimir

spy, you might bring a variety of talents to your work.

In your guild role, you engage in surveillance, theft,

sabotage, infiltration, and other kinds of espionage. You

work in a pocket or sleeper cell. unaware of the identi

ties of most other agents or the guild's leadership. You

might be a  rogue of the Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trick

ster archetype, a monk of the Way of Shadow, or even a

cleric of the Trickery Domain.

If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized

in the School of Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion),

you have the s kills  needed to join the ranks of the most

feared spellcasters on Ravnica: House Dimir"s mind

mages. Your basic work and role is  the same as any

other spy's, but you can learn to pu ll  thoughts and mem

ories from  a person's mind, use a target's own thoughts

against them, attack your foes'  psyches directly to create

delusions, or scour enemy minds clean.

BACKGROUND:  DIMIR OPERATIVE

You're a spy. Secrets and misinformation are your stock

in trade. You s kulk in  the shadows, infiltrate other

guilds. and steal the most precious secrets, whether

they're written in locked journals or hidden away in

someone's mind. Even you might not be aware of all the

reasons behind the missions you carry out. Sometimes

a mission's sole purpose is to conceal the motivatjon be

hind another strike performed in a different part of the

city, or simply to spread fear.

As part of your covert work for  House Dimir, you

maintain a false identity as a member of another guild.

You can choose your secondary guild or roll to deter

mine it randomly. This secondary guild membership

determines a portion of your starting equipment and is

also where most of your contacts come from. You infil

FEATU RE:  FALSE IDENTITY

You have more than one identity. The one you wear most

of the time makes you appear to be a  member of a guild

other than House Dimir. You have documentation, es

tablished acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to

assume that persona and fit into the secondary gwld.

Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and

blend into the guild less masses of the city.

Conside r why you're embedded in the secondary guild.

Create a story with your OM , inspired by rolling on the

following table or choosing a reason that suits you.

My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think

I'm following in their footsteps.

I've  been assigned to track this guild's activities.

I've been assigned to get close to an individual  in  this

guild and learn their secrets.

I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from

the ranks of this guild.

I was a member of this guild before the Dimir

recruited me.

I don't like what this guild stands for and want to

destroy it from within.

I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this

guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.

I chose this guild at random or on a lark.

SPELL:  ENCODE THOUGHTS

Enchantment cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: S

Duration: Up to 8  hours

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a

memory, an idea, or a message from your

mind and transform it into a tangible string

of glowing energy called a thought strand,

which persists for  the duration or until you

cast this spell again. The thought strand

appears in an unoccupied space within 5

feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid

object that can be held and carried like a

ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while concentrating

on a spell or an ability that allows you  to

read or manipulate the thoughts of others

(such as detect thoughts or modify memory),

you can transform the thoughts or memo

ries you  read, rather than your own, into a

thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand

allows you to instantly receive whatever memory.

idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting

detect thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)

SUGGESTED  CHARACTERISTICS

R ANK  AND  RENOWN

As you gain renown within House Dimir, you will be re

warded with missions of increasing importance. No for

mal ranks exist for you to progress through. but certain

thresholds of renown indicate improvements in your

standing within the guild. Perhaps most important. ac

cording to the philosophy of House Dimir. higher stand

ing brings greater knowledge of the inner workings of

Ravnica and the guild.

At the start of your career, your orders include step-by

step instructions  or they consist of just a single task.

You receive these instructions from your guild contact.

INDEPENDENT AGENT

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in House Dimir

As an independent agent, you have considerable latitude

in the way you choose to implement your mission goals.

You acquire a spies' murmur (described in chapter

5)-a magic device that allows you to communicate

telepathically with other Dimir agents who wear similar

items. If this item is lost or destroyed, it's up to you to

secure a r eplacement.

CONTACTS

As an agent of House Dimir working undercover, you

have limited contacts within your guild. Your relation

ships within your secondary guild, in the guise of your

false identity, are usually more extensive.

Roll once on the Dimir Contacts table, giving you an

ally who serves as your contact in Dimir. Then roll twice

on the table for your secondary guild. The first roll gives

you an ally there, and the second roll gives you a rival.

How Do I FIT  IN?

As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's

network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mi nd mages

that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the

surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a

network of cou riers, investigators, media reporters, and

archivists, dealing in information and spreading news.

But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret

symbols. run es. and signals to su rreptitiously communi

cate with other Dimir agents, often in plai n sight.

Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your

true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless iden

tity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within

that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission

for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect

information about a person, or recruit another spy from

the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching

point for your r eal mission. Perhaps. for example, you

were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gain

ing access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.

A  D IMIR  PARTY

House Dimir might send an adventuring party on mis

sions focused on stealth and subterfuge. Such a team

might be made up mostly of rogues and perhaps monks,

with a mind mage (wizard) providing magical support.

Potions help to offset the group's lack of heal ing ability.

COLLECTOR OF  SECRETS

Prerequisite: Renown JO or higher in House Dimir

By the time you reach this level of renown in House

Dimir, you are amassing a significant collection of se

crets about the people and places around you. You know

the location of a hidden safe house where you can take

shelter in case of dire need. At the DM's discretion, you

might also know (or be able to find out) a secret about a

person or group who lives or operates in a neighborhood

you're familiar with. The secret is typically a person's

flaw or details about a dark episode in a group's past.

Whatever it is. the secret is a weakness that can be used

to manipulate the person or group to assist you or your

associates.

In addition, you gain a Dimir charm (described in

chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on

the guild's behalf.

INNER  CIRCLE

Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in House Dimir

At this level of renown, you are responsible for coordi

nating the activities of several other Dimir agents. You

still receive orders from  the usual source, but you're

given broad goals and wide latitude in how to carry

them out, including delegating specific tasks to other

Dimir agents of lesser renown. You are also increasingly

trusted with important secrets.

GUILDMASTER'S  CONFIDANT

Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in House Dimir

Few members of House Dimir ever encounter Lazav,

and those who do are often unaware that they are deal

ing with the guildmaster. You  have been admitted to his

circle of confidants. He has entrusted you with a wide

network of Dimir agents under your command, but you

also bear tremendous responsibility for the success of

the missions they undertake.

ENEMIES AND ALLIES

It's hard for a guild built on stealth and secrecy to main

tain a positive relationship with any other guild. ALI

guilds are monitored with suspicion, and they assessed

for their current and prospective levels of threat, as

well as for their usefulness to House Dimir's schemes.

Each cell may foster its own relationships with the other

guilds, but it ultimately defers to Oimir's enigmatic lead

ers to steer overarching strategy.

Your missions might put you at odds with any other

guild by calling on you to infiltrate that guild and gain

insight into its plans, steal proprietary information from

its guildhall, or subvert its leadership. For instance, you

could be tasked to steal the transcript of an Azorius in

terrogation, the memories of Golgari spy, or the contents

of an Orzhov ledger.

You  might cooperate with members of other guilds,

openly or in disguise, insofar as their goals don't conflict

with yours. Sometimes, the easiest way to assassinate

one of your enemies is to put the forces of law on their

trai 1, so joining forces with the Azorius and Boros, for

example, can be a beneficial arrangement for everyone

concerned.

THE  DIMIR VIEW  ON  OTHER GUILDS

To  House Dimir, every other guild is a potential source of

information, its members all  potential foils and patsies.

Azorius. "They can't be allowed  to monopolize the flow of

knowledge. Clog their networks with  misinformation. To

stop someone from  discerning the truth, drown them in

plausible untruths."

Boros. "Not inherently dangerous. The true danger is

that they'll drag down all we've worked for while chas

ing some romantic crusade. Continue to direct their

righteous fury toward our strongest enemy-until the

Boros threaten to become the strongest."

Golgari. "We once appreciated them for their ability to

make a corpse disappear, but we found  that too many

of our victims rose up to face  us again.  Now we  use the

city's fear of the swarm to  keep them  in  their place. The

more the Golgari try to rise from  the mire of their repu

tation,  the more we  make  them wallow  in  it."

Gruul. "They've always  been convenient scapegoats, but

their recent aggressiveness threatens to become a larger

problem. We must thin  their numbers-selectively and

without confrontation. Catch them alone in the dark, and

take them out one by one."

lzzet. "Even an  overloaded, sizzled clock is still right twice

a day. When lzzet experiments succeed, they can have

unpredictable consequences for active missions. Their

activities must be monitored at all  times."

Orzhov. "We're amused at how well  they've used their hi

erarchy to mask the corruption of their organization, but

their need for the public's trust gives  us an edge. They

can be manipulated by playing on their fear of the people

discovering their ruse."

Rakdos. "They've turned pointless activity into an art form,

but their performances nevertheless make very useful

distractions. Let them be bright and loud, drawing all

attention, while we slip quietly through the dark."

Selesnya. "Strength without guile is  perhaps the most

dangerous kind. One can't bluff the player who can't

conceive of bluffing. Currently, the covert war plays to

our strengths; we must ensure that the conclave never

becomes conscious of the advantages they possess."

Simic. "They are never short of intriguing surprises, so

we  know they are gearing up for something. Keep eyes

inside their organization to see what their efforts are

leading to-but don't be tempted to partake of their

enhancements."

GOLGARI  SWARM

A  S!vlALL CROWD OF PALE  ELVES AND HUMANS STEPPED

into the light.  Bits of bone and detritus woven into their

matted hair clicked lightly. Their chitinous armor swarmed

with tiny,  riotous insects that moved in and out of the sheen

of moss growing on their shoulders-a bed for sprouting

fungi.  Whether it was the Golgari themselves who had made

the chittering sound or their bugs.  Ra/ could not be sure.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The teeming masses that compose the Golgari Swarm

see themselves as pragmatic above all else, uncowed by

the simple fact  that death is part of the cycle of life. They

believe the idea of life and death as opposing forces to

be nothing more than naive sentimentality. They know

everything crumbles and rots in the end, and then new

life springs from  that rot. Time inevitably passes, bring

ing both destruction and new creation to all things.

The original mandate of the Golgari Swarm under

the leaders hip of Svogthir, its Devkarin founder, was to

maintain Ravnica's agriculture and manage its waste.

But Svogthir's interest in  necromancy, and his eventual

transformation into a lich, shaped the course of the

guild's activities and gave birth to its philosophy of em

bracing death as part of nature's cycle.

I N SIDE  T H E  SWARM

The leadership of the Golgari has undergone several

major changes, but the nature of the swarm makes it

easily adaptable to the churn of continuous cycles. Being

alive isn't a prerequisite for leaders hip, as demonstrated

by the ru le of the current guild master, the elf lichJarad

Yod Savo. Assassination is seen as a  perfectly valid

means of effecting political change, which is how Jarad's

s ister, Savra, took control of the guild before him. Var

ious groups of people and monsters coexist within the

swarm, their relative power waxing and waning with the

years, and through it all,  the guild goes on.

The three most important power groups within the

Golgari are the Devkarin elves, the medusas (also

called gorgons in  Ravnica), and the insectile kraul.

Jarad is an undead representative of the Devkarin, so

the elves claim a privileged position within the guild for

the moment.

Members of the Golgari Swarm live in the shadow

of Jarad and the leaders of the individual factions. The

machinations among elves, medusas, kraul, and other

creatures rarely bring any significant improvement to

the lives of the swarm's countless members, but often

cause dis ruption and occasiona lly disaster. Most guild

members believe it's best to keep their heads down and

stay out of the political conflict and to avoid attracting

the disfavor of the Och ran, the guild's order of assas

sins. More adventurous members might enjoy intrigue

and politics, or might unwittingly become tangled up in

the schemes of the guild's leaders.

Jarad maintains a council of shamans and rogues to

serve as a combination of advisory parliament and spy

agency. These high chancellors rarely convene pub

licly, preferring to disperse themselves throughout the

swarm to keep information flowing from  the nucleus to

every part of the organism.

GOALS  OF THE GOLGAR I

The Golgari Swarm celebrates the growth and vibrancy

of the natural world,  but gives equa l attention to nature's

facets of destruction, decay, and death. It finds allies and

agents in the form of fungi , oozes, insects, diseases, and

D ARK  ELVES  OF THE  G O LGARI

Also called the elves of shadow, the Devkarin are one of

the three branches of Ravnica's elf race.  Like other elves,

the Devkarin are adept spellcasters, counting most of the

Golgari's shamans among their number.

After being cast out of the nascent Selesnya Conclave

millennia ago, the Devkarin found  a home amid the cor

rupted and overgrown places of Ravnica, and the Devkarin

necromancer Svogthir became the founder of the Golgari

Swarm. Since then, the Devkarin  have  been a major influ

ence in  the guild, even during the times when they didn't

hold absolute power.  Regardless of who rules the guild, the

Devkarin follow the guidance of a high  priest, called the

matka. The  matka's spiritual  leadership usually aligns with

the guildmaster's temporal commands, but during times

when the guild is ruled by a non-elf faction,  the matka can

be a significant dissenting voice.

other unsavory aspects of nature, and it uses the power

of nature actively toward the goal of advancing its own

place in  the world. But the Golgari have also learned

patience from  nature; they are content to work from the

shadows, harnessing the energy that comes from decay

while the civilization of Ravnica slowly erodes and de

stroys itself.

The teeming hordes of the Golgari Swarm believe it

is  finally their time to s hine. They have dwelled under

the streets and  under the sway of the other guilds for too

long. They are convinced that Ravnica's institutions are

now on the verge of collapse and that the absence of the

Living Guildpact proves it. However, the Golgari are nei

ther surprised nor panicked by this, for they believe that

all  things eve ntually rot and die, and from  this decay,

new life blooms. As such, the Golgari see the looming

interguild conflict as a necessary final push to bring

about a new era- their era.

The Golgari are preparing for upheaval. They have

sealed many of the passages leading into the underc ity,

making their territory seem like an impregnable subter

ranean fortress. Within it, the Golgari domain retains

its grandeur, a mysterious and wondrous kingdom. The

rare visitors who stumble into it are awed by its beauty

and its aura of ancient power. Palatial architecture fills

cavernous sewer chambers, and luminescent spores

float through the air to shed a n otherworldJy light on the

moss-covered masonry. Ente ring Golgari territory feels

like stepping into a secret world of dangerous beauty.

GOLGARI  CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually neutral, often evil

Suggested Races: Human, elf (dark)

Suggested Classes: Druid, fighter, ranger, rogue. wizard

The Golgari Swarm might suit your character if one or

more of the following statements are true:

You're drawn to the darker side of nature or the

greener s ide of necromancy.

You are drawn to sinister, creepy, or grim characters.

You like e lves and druids but want to explore an

unusual direction.

JOINING THE  GOLGARI  SWARM

Similar to a swarm of insects, the Golgari collectively

behave more like a single organism than a scattering of

individuals. New members aren't recruited or initiated

into the Golgari Swarm; you have been absorbed and

incorporated, and the biological system of the swarm

funneled you to where your talents a re most needed

to contribute to the health of the guild. Your position

within the guild is defined by your capabilities.

You  might act as a shaman of the Golgari if you are a

spellcaster- perhaps a wizard s pecialized in the School

of Necromancy, a druid of the Circle of the Land, or a

druid of the Circle of Spores (described in chapter 1). In

this revered position, you  teach and advise other mem

bers of the swarm , keeping them attuned to the natural

cycle of death and regrowth. You might manipulate that

natural cycle by wielding the magic of death, snuffing

52

(  llAPrt R  2  I t.LJll OS  or  RA\'Nlt:\

out life and reanimating the dead. Or you  might wield

your magic to spread fungal rot and noxious gases, pre

paring parts of the city for annexation.

If you aren't adept at magic, the swarm still needs

you. Golgari warriors both defend the guild's territory

and, when necessary, take offensive action. If you are a

fighter (typically of the Champion archetype), you can

serve as a shock trooper, perhaps fighting alongside

kraul and trolls on behalf of the swarm. If you are a

ranger (likely of the Beast Master archetype) or a rogue

(of the Thief or Assassin archetype), you are more of a

skirmisher. Golgari rangers favor insects and reptiles as

compan ions.

BACKGROUND:  GOLGARIAGENT

You are a member of a teeming horde-one small part of

a sprawling organism.Just as you are part of the swarm,

the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending

cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your

life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark

places of the city where the messy parts of existence

are on display. There is little squeamishness among the

Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a

fierce affirmation of the cycle.

S kill Proficiencies : Nature, Survival

Tool Proficiencies : Poisoner's kit

Lan guages : Choose one of Elvish, Giant, or Kraut

Equipment: A Golgari insignia, a poisoner's kit, a pet

FEATURE:  UND ERCIT Y  PATHS

You know hidden, underground pathways that you can

use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as you

move through the city. When you aren't in combat, you

and companions you lead can travel between any two lo

cations in the city twice as fast as your speed would nor

mally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by

dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world,

so your journey isn't guaranteed to be safe.

How Do I  FIT IN?

As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized

instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you

have such, come from the guild master by way of his

chancellors. who carry his messages throughout the

guild. The swarm relies on you  to advance the greater

good by protecting some part, however small, of its

teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean

you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of

your purpose and function, too, and youll be replaced

even  as your body provides nutrients to further the

swarm's growth.

A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari

involves crawling through dungeon-like environments

the sewer s and ancient vaults of the undercity-in

search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes

you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost

in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times,

you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fun

gus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers,

or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill th e

swarm's coffers.

You might gain enough renown to become a member

of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning

thievery, assassination, or the protection of important

figures in your guild. You might steal something be

cause the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring

harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline.

Golgari Swarm. The creature is  not obligated to help

you, but it holds you  in enough esteem to at least con

sider it- in exchange for  the promise of a favor in return.

In addition, you receive a Golgari charm (described in

chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on

the guild's behalf.

0CHRAN  (SPECIAL R OLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Golgari

Swarm

Having achieved considerable renown within the guild,

you can choose to become a member of the Och ran. The

Ochran often serve as stealthy bodyguards, lurking out

of sight until some danger threatens their wards. The

Och ran are also sent out as assassins or burglars to

further the gui ld's goals.

ADVISOR

Prerequisite: Renown 2S or higher in the Golgari

Swaim

Although you aren't yet one of Jarad's personal counsel

ors, your value to the guild is clear. The high chancellors

regularly call on you to perform tasks for the guild and

to share your insights. You can be sure that anything

you say to a  high chancellor will pass quickly to the ears

of the guild master.

HIGH  CHANCELLOR

Prerequisite: Renown SO or higher in the Golgari

Swarm

Jarad seeks out the most powerful, effective, and loyal

members of the Golgari Swarm to serve as his high

chancellors. At this point, you certainly qualify. The

amorphous nature of Jarad's council means that you

don't need to wait for a vacancy to open up; Jarad sum

mons you  to his presence, and you are expected to

appear and accept the new position offered to you.

As a high chancellor, you advise Jarad in his

decision-making, keep him informed of happenings

throughout the guild, and convey his instructions to the

various parts of the gu ild's "body."

MATKA  (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown SO or higher in the Golgari

Swarm, elf(dark), spellcasting ability

You are e ligible to fill  the role of matka, the high priest

of the Golgari elves. You can attain this position only if

the previous matka has died or stepped down. Becom

ing matka requires you  to claim the position and main

tain your title against any challengers. It isn't unusual

for competing claims among would-be matkas to be

resolved by combat ... or assassination.

As matka, your status among the Devkarin is compa

rable to that of the guild master's. Even high chancellors

who are Devkarin attempt to balance their loyalty to

Jarad with their loyalty to you.

You cou ld be assigned to kill an outspoken and active

enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros

captain whose raids into the undercity have approached

dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you

could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guild master Ja

rad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the

undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's

notice if things go wrong.

The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accel

erate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent

to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari

want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhab

itants of such a territory to abandon it. You  might also

contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters

encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.

A  GoLGARI PARTY

An adventuring party drawn from  the teeming ranks of

the Golgari Swarm might focus on traversing the under

city or on stealthy missions in  the streets above. A pair

of shamans (a druid and a wizard) would form  the core

leadership of the group, supported by a warrior (fighter

or ranger) and a stealthy member of the Och ran (rogue).

R ANK AND  RENOWN

Every member of the Golgari Swarm has its place, and

every role is important to the proper functioning of the

guild. Aside from a few leadership positions, the swarm

doesn't consider different functions to be more or less

important than others. The idea of progressing up the

ranks is foreign to the Golgari way of thinking. That

said, your renown within the Golgari is a direct measure

of the guildmaster's knowledge of you, his confidence in

your abilities, and his interest in your activities.

At the start of your career with the Golgari, the guild

master and his chancellors have no way to distinguish

you from the masses of others who perform a similar

fun ction.  If you receive instructions from  the high chan

cellors, the orders are directed toward you as part of a

larger group: for example, "Reclaimers, keep your eyes

open for an lzzet keyrune believed to be lost in this sec

tor of the sewers."

AC ENT

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Golgari Swarm

You have distinguished yourself from the mass of your

peers. Guild master Jarad might not know your name,

but he knows that a member of your group is reliable

and effective, and his high chancellors s ingle you out for

specific missions. The guild provides you with supplies

you need to complete those missions (within reason).

MONSTROUS  FAVORS

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Golgari

Swarm

When you  reach this level of renown in the Golgari

Swarm, Jarad knows your name and appreciates that

you can be relied on to help fulfill  the guild's objectives.

Thanks to this prominence, you can get away with beg

ging a favor from  the guild's more monstrous members.

You can ask an undercity medusa, a troll, or a kraul

death priest to help you with a task that benefits the

E N EMIE S  AND A LLIE S

The Golgari Swarm shares a general philosophical

approach with the other nature-oriented guilds-Simic,

Gruul, and Selesnya- in its concern for the forces of life

and growth. Under the right circumstances, a member

of the Golgari can work well with agents of those organi

zations. But the Golgari's emphasis on death as part of

the life cycle is foreign to those other guilds.

The Golgari prefer to erode their enemies' strength

through a process of attrition rather than by launching

frontal attacks. 1 f you are called on to take direct action

against another guild, it is probably a matter of self-pres

ervation against a guild that is threatening the life and

livelihood of the Golgari. You  might oppose the Azorius

as they attempt to extend their jurisdiction into the

undercity or strike back at the Boros to dissuade them

from launching more attacks into Golgari territory. Oc

casionally, you  might be assigned to assault the enemies

of the Golgari more directly, especially if you are a mem

ber of the Och ran. If the death of a particular person or

the theft of a key treasure will contribute to the decline

and downfall of an enemy guild, even the typically pa

tient Golgari will try to seize that opportunity.

You  might ally with members of another guild if

they are working- even unwittingly-toward goals you

share. The Gruul, for example, are adept at hastening

the decay of both humanoid populations and physical

structures, even if they remain unaware of their full role

in the natural cycle. If some event threatens to upset the

balance of nature, such as a necromantic blight that kills

all growth or a magical wildfire rampaging through the

city, you  might join other nature-oriented guilds in an

attempt to curtail it and preserve the balance.

To the Golgari, the other guilds of Ravnica are shortsighted

and inevitably doomed to collapse.

Azorius. "Such hubris! As  if all  their laws could shore up

this crumbling society. Their regulations and institutions

are just detritus in  the making."

Boros. "The Boros speak a language we will  never un

derstand. Their militant dedication to empty concepts

like 'justice' and 'righteousness' is  both confusing and

disturbing."

Oimir. "They collect information like trinkets, so how can

they ever grasp the deeper truths we possess?  But their

presence in  the undercity is an all-too-real threat to our

dominion beneath the streets."

Gru ul. "The clans serve as effective instruments of the

natural cycle, though  in  their anger, they are blind to the

extent of the role they play."

lzzet. "Perplexing. They are attracted to whatever flashes

brightest and booms loudest. Their fascination  with their

toys will  only hasten their own end."

Orzhov. "They flout the natural order and use their

knowledge of death to resist its pull. While their bodies

rot, their spirits persist, clinging to the fiction  of mate

rial wealth."

Rakdos. "They understand the inevitability of death but

seek to hasten its arrival for their petty ends. What the

demon destroys, we  nurse back to life again."

Selesnya. "Their reverence for nature is the mark ofim

maturity and naivete. They fear death, so they can't

understand life. They can be dangerous when they

fervently cling to their narrow-minded and inadequate

view of life."

Simic. "They seek patterns in the natural world, which is

commendable enough, but they  believe the search will

lead them to find  perfection through all  of its flaws. They

strive to move forward  but fail to see that the path they

tread is cyclical.''

INSIDE THE  CLANS

As a collection of disparate clans, the Gruul have no sin

gle leader and no headquarters. But the Gruul respect

strength and are willing to follow a strong individual

who points them in a direction they want to go anyway.

For seve ral decades, that pos ition has been held by the

mighty cyclops Borborygmos, chief of the Burning Tree

clan. His nihilistic anger inspires the rest of the Gruul,

so when he calls on the other clans to join a  raid, they

usually agree. Even the fractious Gruul can see the ben

efit of banding together. The clans sometimes gather at

Skarrg, a ruined palace in the rubblebelt adjoining the

Tenth District. Here are descriptions of the clans:

Burning Tree Clan. The Burning Tree clan is the most

fea rsome of the Gruul Clans, as well as the largest

and most diverse, with branches in several districts of

Ravnica. The fear and awe inspired by Borborygmos

unifies its diverse members hip. The Ravnican popu

lace regards the symbol of the Burning Tree clan as

the symbol for the entire Gruul guild.

Ghor Ciao. The Ghor clan is led by an ettin named Ru

ric Thar (or, perhaps more properly, Ruric and Thar,

since the heads claim separate names). Of all the

clans, the Ghor carry out the most frequent and s av

age assaults on Ravnica's citizenry. The clan is known

for its audacity in forging e ncampments close to heav

ily populated districts.

S cab Clan. Members of the Scab clan display scars and

body modifications, which they view as expressions of

the powerful rage they harbor within themselves. The

clan has grown in influence by engulfing or destroying

several smaller clans in recent years, but the leader of

the Scabs, a corpulent giant known as Narbulg Nine

Fingers, has not gone so far as to challenge the Burn

ing Tree clan.

S lizt Clan. The Slizt clan is a clutch of sly, skittish war

riors, consisting largely of reptilian humanoids called

viashino (use the lizardfolk stat block in  the Monster

Manual to represent them), along with a few wily hu

mans. This clan survives in the rubblebelts by taking

up hiding places in  high ground and ambushing its

enemies with ranged attacks from above. Other Gruul

regard the Slizt as skulkers and cowards, but nonethe

less all are cautious when entering areas with elevated

ruins. The home ground of the Slizt clan is the Husk,

an area at the center of a vast rubblebelt featuring

many large, ancient structures that have remained

standing for generations.

GRUUL CLANS

Doug Beyer. Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The Gruul Clans are a wild people in a civilized land,

a loose affi liation of bands that squat on the fringes of

Ravnican society. They shun the centers of civilization.

which they see as a source of oppression and weakness,

and  instead haunt Ravnica's alleyways, abandoned

zones, and ruins. They want to see the edifice of civi

lization  torn down so the world can revert to the pure

wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover

everything. Then the true order of nature can be re

stored- an unbridled and brutal state in which only the

strong survive and the strongest rule.

In a world covered with city streets and towering

buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place. the

most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and

start fresh. Constant ritualistic warfare reverberates

a mong the clans, every skirmish reinforcing their doc

trine of the survival of the fittest. They frequently send

sorties into civilized areas to secure goods-and to

wreak havoc.

The first leader of the Gruul was Cisarzim, a cyclops

who was purportedly the ancestor of Borborygmos, the

current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of

Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers

of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as

remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world.

The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven

the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.

ITCHING  FOR  A  FI G HT

Gruul goblins live in  colonies scattered at the edges of

Gruul territory and civilized neighborhoods. They fight

fiercely when threatened, punctuating thei r attacks with

hisses and growls. When  battle fury takes hold of a Gruul

raiding group,  it typically starts with the goblins, and after

the battle, the surviving goblins are still froth ing at the

mouth and looking for someone to hit.

Grave l Hide Cla n. The Gravel Hide clan believes that

resilience is the truest measure of strength. Though

a relatively new group, its members have already

earned a reputation (almost certainly exaggerated) for

shrugging off devastating attacks. The clan's leader,

a hot-tempered goblin named Skorik Boulder Tooth,

adorns himself with the shattered remnants of weap

ons that he has rent to bits with his own jaws.

Zhur-Taa Clan. The Zhur-Taa clan advocates an ex

treme interpretation of the Old Ways. Central to this

view is its belief in the imminent awakening of an

ancient boar god-Ilharg, the Raze-Boar-who will

lay waste to the overcivilized world. Led by a centaur

druid called Nikya of the Old Ways, the Zhur-Taa pile

up skulls as offerings to this god, and their druids per

form guttural chants before and during battle that are

said to be in the language of the old gods.

Zhur-Taa druids are adept at summoning and train

ing beasts as war-companions and mounts, and the

clan's warriors wade into battle alongside giant boars,

other beasts, and even wurms or hydras.

Bolrac Clan. The most selective of all the Gruul Clans,

the Bolrac clan denies membership to the smaller

races. Its members are all enormous, lumbering

brutes, primarily cyclopes, ogres, and giants. The

clan's leadersh ip changes frequently- sometimes

daily, since battles for supremacy are as common as

meals. The Bolrac clan specializes in bringing down

massive structures using mauls and battering rams.

The only thing the Bolrac love more than destroying

something smaller than them is toppling, overrun

ning, and destroying something larger than them.

Trogs . Some wandering hermits, known as trogs, find

even the company of a clan to be too suffocating,

so they spend their days alone in the wild  places of

Ravnica. These individuals are fierce,  independent

warriors who traverse the rubblebelts as apex preda

tors . Trogs are notoriously short-tempered and impa

tient around others. Occasionally, they heed the call of

the guildmaster to join in  riots or festivals,  but more

often they conduct their own ceremonies and celebra

tions in private.

GOALS  OF THE GRUUL

So far as any philosophy can be said to underlie the

Gruul way of life, it is about living in the now, with little

concern for forethought, planning, or speculation. Im

pulse drives the actions of the Gruul Clans. They want

to live their lives unimpeded, and they lash out when

something tries to stand in  their way. Emotion and

impulsiveness drive them as they seek to do what they

want, take what they want, and smash what they want.

GRUUL CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually chaotic, often neutral

Suggested Races: Human, centaur, goblin, minotaur

Suggested  Classes: Barbarian, cleric, druid,

fighter, ranger

You  might enjoy playing a character who belongs to

the Gruul Clans if one or more of the following sen

tences are true:

You enjoy playing rage-mad barbarians and sav

age druids.

You want to throw off the shackles of civilization and

indulge your inner beast.

You like being a force of chaos who keeps things

moving in your adventures.

j OINING THE  GRUU~ 9 LA NS

You might have been born and raised among the Gruul,

like many of the guild's  members. Or you could be an

outcast, a refugee, or a fugitive from civi lized society,

shunned for your violent ways or for fleeing the hand

of justice. As long as you are strong enough to survive

among the Gruul, you are welcome. no matter what se

crets haunt your past.

The Gruul "guild" is actually a collection of different,

independent clans loosely united under one powerful

leader. When you decide to join the Gruul, you join a

specific clan, not the guild as a whole. You can roll a d8

The rites of becoming Gruul, whether you  have come

from outside the guild or are marking your entrance into

adulthood, center around being buried alive. When you

enter the shallow grave, the person you were before is

dead. Your past wrongs and errors are forgotten, but so

are your past accomplishments. No matter how well you

proved yourself in battle before, when you  rise from  the

earth you are untested. The clan leaders recognize you

only when you earn glory in battle as a Gruul.

Most of the Gruu1 find  their place among the fierce

warriors of their clans. If you are a fighter, ranger, or

barbarian, this is your natural role. Gruul fighters tend

to adopt the Champion archetype, Gruul rangers usually

adopt the Hunter or the Beast Master archetype, and

Gruul barbarians follow either the Path of the Totem

Warrior or the Path of the Berserker. Whatever your

class, as a Gruul warrior you are devoted to tearing

down the edifices of civilization, both physical and

institutional. You  lash out at a system that you believe is

the root of corruption and weakness.

If you are spellcaster, such as a druid (usually of the

Circle of the Moon) or a cleric of the Tempest Domain,

you might adopt a more spiritual role in your clan. You

practice what the Gruul call the Old Ways, a discipline

that predates the foundation of civilization on Ravnica,

to channel the primal energy that stilJ pulses through

the wild places of the world.

BAC KGROUND:GRUUL ANARCH

The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis,

but you are a native of the wild areas that stiJI exist-the

abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown

parks, and the crumbling ruins. You a re part of a savage

society that clings desperately to the Old Ways- attuned

to nature, full  of primal rage, and given s hort shrift by

a world consumed with continuing civilization's march

of progress.

Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Athletics

Tool Proficiencies: 1-lerbalism kit

Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Giant,

FEATURE:  RUBBLEBELT R EFUGE

You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that

most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms

rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in

decades, and the vast. sprawling rubblebelts of broken

terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can

find  a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or

rest in these areas. In addition, you can find  food a nd

fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five

other people each day.

How Do I  FIT IN?

In service of a s imple goal, you have a simple part

to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. F latten buildings

and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in

your own way.

You will frequently be summoned to par ticipate in a

raid your clan is launching against the city or against a

group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send

you on a special mission, though it would almost cer

tain ly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group

CllAPHR 2  I Gldl OS  OJ  RAVNICA

of Gruu 1 warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the

settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an

item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison.

Sometimes your objective might be more esoteric.

With prophecies of the return of llharg the Raze-Boar

spreading like wildfire among the GruuJ druids, you

might be asked to carry out some task that the druids

believe will speed his coming. Such a task might in

volve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or

collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze

Boar's honor.

A  GRUUL PARTY

A group of Gruul adventurers can serve as a raiding

party to pursue the goals of one clan or the guild as

a whole. The combination of anarchs and berserkers

(fighters, rangers, and barbarians) with druids of the

Old Ways (druids or clerics) creates a powerful mix of

muscle and magic. S uch a party lacks the capacity for

s ubtlety or stealth, but Gruul missions rarely require

such abilities. (A  ranger can provide them, in the rare

case whe re they are necessary.)

RA NK AND  RE NOWN

Renown among the Gruul could also be called glory

when you  prove yourself in battle, you earn the respect

of your fellows. With glory comes acceptance of your

leadership and warriors willing to follow you into battle.

The Gruul have no formal  holders of titles aside from

the chieftains of clans and the guildmaster, but relative

status within one's clan is still important.

With several battles under your belt, you have demon

strated service to your clan and earned the recognition

of your peers. You have the right to tattoo your body to

commemorate your triumphs in battle and demonstrate

your loyalty to the Gruul. You don"t yet have authority

over others, but when you go into battle with your clan,

your fellow warriors fight  near you, acknowledging your

prowess. Your clan chieftain knows your name and

might decide to single you out, offering you an oppor

tunity to prove yourself by per forming a special task.

Depending on the nature of the task, the chieftain might

send ld4 a na rchs (see chapter 6 for the stat block)

along to help you.

BEAST- FRIEND

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in your clan

When you  reach th is level of renown, you develop a

rapport with the beasts that haunt the rubblebelts .

When you a re in a rubblebelt area, you can summon one

beast to be you r mount: a batterboar (a giant boar as

described in the Monster Manual), a ceratok (using the

stat block of a rhinoceros), or a raktusk (equivalent to a

giant elk). It doesn't fight for you  unless you  have magic

or another ability that can control a beast.

In addition, when you carry out a raid on the guild's

behalf, a druid of your clan gives you a Gruul charm (de

scribed in chapter 5) at the start of the raid.

CELEBRATED

Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in your clan

You are a hero in your clan, and your reputation extends

to other clans as well. You can count on the aid of your

clan in most situations. Your clan's druids cast spells

for you, and you  lead a warband that consists of 3d4

anarchs (see chapter 6 for the stat block) plus three

berserkers or ogr es (see the Monster Manual for their

stat blocks).

Your chiefta in  keeps an eye on you, aware that you're

a potential challenger for leaders hip of the clan.

CHIEFTAfN

Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in your clan

You can now rightfully challenge your chieftain in single

combat for leadership of the clan or take the warriors

loyal to you and form a new clan.

ENEMIES AND ALLIES

By standing in opposition to the civilized ways of the

other guiJds, the Gruul Clans have made it  practically

impossible to establish alliances with those guilds.

S imilar to the Golgari, Selesnya, and S imic,  the Gruul

respect nature and maintain a close relationship with

animals-in the Gruul's case, the monstrous beasts that

stalk the rubble a nd ruins. But the Gr uul would just as

soon smash the sewers, gardens, and laboratories of

those other guilds than cooperate with them in an effort

to establish nature as a larger presence within the city.

Because they see all of the remaining guilds as cogs

in the vast machine of civilization, the Gruul tailor their

tactics toward breaking the machine, rather than direct

ing their attacks at any particular guild. Any guild can

be the target of Gruul aggression, as the opportunity

arises. The fiercest assaults often come against the

guilds that take it upon themselves to combat the Gruu l,

primarily the Boros and Azorius.

In certain circumstances, such as when some night

marish horror rears its head in the heart of a rubblebelt,

you and your clan could accept the help of members of

another guild in putting an end to the danger. Or, when

the schemes of other guilds pit one clan against another,

there might be some benefit to you and your clan in co

operating with those efforts. But your truest allies are

other members of your clan.

Since every other guild participates to some extent in  the

establishment and sustenance of the civilization that the

Gruul despise, the Gruul look down on all  other guilds as

soft, corrupt, or downright abhorrent.

Azorius. "Civilization is a disease, and the Azorius are its

plague bearers. Once they are destroyed,  Ravnica will

reclaim  its primal essence."

Boros. "Puppets who are all  too eager to kneel at the feet

of their angel handlers."

Dimir. "Skulkers, whisperers, and back-stabbers! They are

an infestation of roaches.  If they  remain in  the shadows,

they will  be crushed beneath the rubble of a city that we

bri ng down on thei r heads.  If they face  us in open battle,

well, then we'll have a good laugh."

Golgari. "Hermits and under-dwellers. They see that civili

zation  must be brought to its knees,  but they just want

to replace it with another of their design."

lzzet. "Like us, they  respect the powerful. But they seek it

in  their gadgets and try to contain it in jars."

Orzhov. "The schemers of the Orzhov are the festering

wound on a limb  that must be hacked away. They amass

thei r power by preying on the weak, so how powerful

can they  be?"

Rakdos. "The guild  of fools. They waste their potential on

acts of mockery while the real work of razing the city

remains undone."

Selesnya. "The Selesnya would coddle a wolf, teach it to

fetch sticks, and call it a dog. We  prefer to starve the

wolf, let it hunt for its food,  and make it a stronger wolf."

Simic. "The Simic enjoy twisting nature, but they will  not

enjoy  it when nature twists back."

teleported far from the workshop. This sort of adjust

ment is par for the course in lzzet experiments: the "fid

dle and find out'' method is favored over any process of

systematic scientific research.

The lzzet League is one of the few guilds whose

founder, the dragon Niv-Mizzet,  remains its guildmaster,

just as the guild continues to fulfill its original mission

(even as its experiments go far beyond the guild's origi

nal mandate).

INSIDE THE LEAGUE

Niv-Mizzet, the original and current guildmaster of

the lzzet League, is a fifteen-thousand-year-old, vain.

temperamental, super-intelligent dragon. As he directs

experiments throughout the guild, he values results

over success, accepting and even anticipating that Izzet

experiments will end in gloriously unpredictable ways.

However, the dragon rarely concerns himself with the

day-to-day running of the guild, preferring to craft long

range plans and let underlings implement the details.

Overseeing the daily operations of the guild is the

purview of the Izmundi, a board of directors that assem

bles teams from among the rank and file of the Izzet

League to carry out research according to Niv-Mizzet's

directions. The Izmagnus is a smaller board with five  to

seven members (some members' identities remain se

cret) who serve as Niv-Mizzet's closest advisors.

IN THE  NAME OF MAGICAL SCIENCE!

lzzet laboratories buzz with creative and often destructive

energy, as countless researchers go about their business

pushing the boundaries of knowledge.  But the lure of dis

covery is anything but monolithic across the lzzet League.

Hu mans, who make up the majority of the guild's

mages, are fueled  by limitless curiosity and sustained by

their ability to approach any problem from a multitude of

different angles.

Goblins embody the lzzet's unrestrained enthusiasm for

their endeavors. They epitomize the recklessness of lzzet

mages, and some participate as subjects in hazardous ex

periments-even ones of their own devising.  More often,

they thrive in their role as attendants to researchers.

Vedalken tend to be more focused, organized, and as

tute compared to their lzzet compatriots, and thus they

often serve as leaders of projects in the guild's laborato

ries. Some vedalken are so obsessive about their work that

they like to see to every detail themselves, rather than del

egating any task to underlings or assistants. This attitude

can irritate and alienate their guild mates-and put the

vedalken in harm's way when an  experiment goes awry.

lZZET LEAGUE

THE lZZET MAGES WEREN'T HARD TO FIND. AFTER A

couple of days of observation, }ace heard an explosion and

saw a startled flight of birds from across the district. The

plume of blue smoke was a telltale sign of one of the Izzet's

pyrotechnic experiments.face tracked the source of the

blast and spied two mages, a human and a goblin, outfit

ted with alchemical gadgetry and mizzium gauntlets. They

emerged from a disused tunnel.  leaving behind charred

bricks and a haze of smoke, and their instruments crackled

with energy. From whatjace had gathered.  this was the

lzzet style of research: keep adding energy until something

blows up.  then observe the results.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The lzzet are obsessive experimenters, combining

a  keen creative intellect with a short attention span.

The original mandate of the I zzet guild was to provide

solutions for public works projects (sewers. boilers,

and roadways). but their increasingly far-fetched experi

ments satisfy only their insatiable curiosity. Sometimes

their experiments yield useful technological advance

ments; other times they produce unintended mana gey

sers, spatial rifts, arcane portals, or huge explosions

all of which can be useful in their own way.

The league's most grandiose experiments typically

concern public works projects and elemental experi

mentation. These efforts use a methodology that relies

on  unexpected outcomes: all results are informative,

even if they completely defy expectations. For example,

an experiment that begins as the creation of a "hyper

mana focusing lens~ might be renamed a "scram-range

teleportal" once the researchers discover more prop

erties of what they have fashioned. Then, after a few

goblin volunteers vanish inside it, the apparatus gains

the designation of "universal refuse disintegrator"- until

the goblin volunteers are discovered alive, having been

CllAPTER2  C.UILDSOFRA\NICA

The Izzet League is organized into units designated as

laboratories that specialize in certain fields of research.

Though they all  operate under the general guidance of

the lzmundi, each laboratory is typically left alone to

conduct its research. New fields of study emerge all the

time, but the more established laboratories-each pop

ulated by hundreds of mages and their attendants-in

clude the following:

The Laboratory of Pyrology has a prominent facility in

the guildhall, Nivix. Its emphasis is on heat, fire, and

explosion.

The Laboratory of Storms and Electricity focuses on

controlling the weather as well as containing and con

ducting electrical energy. Its headquarters is in a spire

atop Nivix, known as the Lightning Rod.

Research into smelting and forging, most often using

the magical metal known as mizzium, is conducted at

the Laboratory of Metallurgy, which bas a small out

post in the Tenth District's Smelting Quarter.

The magical science of transmuting one substance to

another is the study of the Laboratory of Alchemy.

The Laboratory of Orie ntation, concerned with telepor

tation and spatial recombination, has multiple work

shops that seem to appear and disappear at random.

The Laboratory ofMimeography studies means of

duplication.

The Laboratory of Continuism emphasizes the study of

temporal manipulation.

Research into counter-magic and redirection takes

place in the Laboratory of Arcane Geometry, which

has a small presence in  Prism University in the

Tenth District.

The Laboratory of Gravitationa l Invers ion conducts

research on means of flight and maintains a workshop

near Augustin Station in the Tenth District.

The Laboratory of Plasma-Dermatology places em

phasis on the combining of opposing elements, with

the purpose of creating creatures called weirds.

Izzet laboratories function in a constant state of high

energy that propels researchers from one experiment

to the next. Some grand-scale experiments draw on the

resources of an entire laboratory, while others are a lone

visionary's labor of love.

G OA LS  OF THE  l ZZET

The lzzet League thirsts for knowledge, cherishes intel

lect. and speculates about the secrets of the multiverse.

It brings to its scientific pursuits a flaming passion that

turns its search for knowledge into an insatiable hunger,

makes its cold intellect brilliantly fruitful, and widens

its speculation into a search for connections between

wildly disparate objects or concepts. It is manic in its ex

pressions of creative energy, shifting from careful anal

ysis to intuitive leap seemingly for no reason, always

thinking outside the proverbial box. As the Izzet see it,

unpredictable action, far from being antithetical to me

thodical research, has experimental value. In the words

of one researcher, "The only action worth taking is one

with an unknown outcome."

As Ravnica descends into increasing turmoil, the

lzzet have further intensified their frenetic research,

though now their efforts are mainly directed toward one

< 11,\l'I ~ R  2  GUI LO$ Of  R \\':-0 !(,,\

65

outcome: the development of super-weapons. The suspi

cion that festers in  the mind of the Izzet guild master, the

ancient dragon Niv-Mizzet, urges him to push his guild's

research toward increasingly dangerous and volatile ex

perimentation.

For the rest of the guild members, the search for

bigger and better weapons is mainly an opportunity to

engage in all sorts of wild research while abandoning

all outward pretense of safety or reason. Much of the

guild's laboratory space has been converted into testing

grounds that are capable of withstanding great dis

charges of magical energy.

lZZET CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually chaotic, often neutral

Suggested Races: Human, goblin, vedalken

Suggested Classes: Fighter, sorcerer, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the

Izzet League fo r any of the following reasons:

You  like to make things happen and don't care about

the consequences.

You're drawn to wild magic and dangerous explosions.

You want to be an innovative genius.

You  relish the madcap high jinks of goblins.

JOINI NG T HE  lZZET LEAGUE __

Most lzzet recruits begin their careers as attendants.

In the service of a more powerful mage, a crew of up

to forty attendants engages in tasks such as recording

and organizing information (sometimes under danger

ous circumstances), acquiring rare items or elements

(usually under dangerous circumstances), or completing

experiments (always under dangerous circumstances).

Goblins relish this sort of work, while other folk seek

promotion into a new position as quickly as possible.

If you  are a spellcaster, such as a sorcerer or a wizard,

the easiest way up and out of your position is by proving

your s kill with magic. Most lzzet sorcerers get their

magic from the Wild  Magic origin, but a few claim a

Draconic Bloodline.  lzzet wizards tend to specialize in

the School of Conjuration, Evocation. or Transmutation.

As a n Izzet spellcaster, you are probably connected to

a particular laboratory, either one described in the "In

side the lzzet" section or a less prominent one focused

on a narrower topic. You could be an independent re

searcher, a functionary devoted to carrying out errands

for the guild's leadership, or a coordinator charged with

synchronizing the efforts of different laboratories.

Even though the work of the Izzet League is largely

focused on magic and research, if you are a more

martial-minded character you still have a role to play in

the guild. Fighters with the Eldritch Knight archetype

often serve as guards, protecting laboratories and the

inventions contained within them, or you can aspire

to the elite role of scorchbringer (which comes with a

flame-throwing magic device called a pyroconverger, de

scribed in chapter 5).

B ACKGROUND:  l ZZET ENGINEER

Armed with an inventive intellect, a love of magical

technology, and an unquenchable energy, you are an

enthusiastic participant in the research work of the

lzzet League. Though you're likely to begin your career

as a mere attendant, you can aspire to become a skilled

mage or alchemist, a laboratory supervisor, or even a

flamethrower-wielding scorchbringer tasked with de

fending lzzet laboratories. The Izzet are obsessive, bril

liant, inspired, and an unpredictable force of chaos in

Ravnica, and you epitomize all of those qualities.

Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, lnvestigation

Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Goblin,

orVedalken

Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools

Equipment: An Izzet insignia, one set of artisan's tools,

the charred and twisted remains of a failed experi

ment, a hammer, a block and tackle, a set of common

clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius

1-zino coins)

FEATURE:  URBAN  INFRASTRUCTURE

The popular conception of the Izzet League is based

on  mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and ex

plosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate,

but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of

construction and architecture- primarily in crafting the

infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running

water, levitating platforms, and other magical and tech

nological wonders.

You have a basic knowledge of the structure of build

ings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also

find  blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the

details of its construction. Such blueprints might pro

vide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses,

or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't

unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you

in  trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from

the repercussions.

IZZET  GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on  the lzzet Guild Spells table are

added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you

Your spells tend to be loud, flashy,  or explosive, even

when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you

open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be

outlined by harmless. showy sparkles.

If you  use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form

of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets,

glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attach

ing it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in

chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.

The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters

because of its unpredictable nature.

SPELL:  CHAOS  BOLT

1st-level evoe<1tion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V,  S

Duration: l nstantaneous

You  hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy

at one creature in  range. Make a ranged spell attack

against the target. On a hit,  the target takes 2d8 + l d6

damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled

on that die determines the attack's damage type, as

shown below.

If you roll  the same number on both d8s, the chaotic

energy leaps from the target to a different creature of

your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll

against the new target, and make a new damage roll,

which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by this casting of

the spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

a spell s lot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes

ld6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level

above 1st.

SUGGESTED  CHARACTERISTICS

Members of the Izzet League embody some combination

of chaotic, frenetic energy with intellectual curiosity, in

varying proportions. Some are committed to academic

pursuits, and others just like explosions.

How Do  I  FIT IN?

Whatever your role in the lzzet League, you are ex

pected to contribute to its research in some way.

That contribution might involve participating in  tests,

whether as an assistant, a researcher, or a subject. You

might be one of the soldiers who protects a  laboratory,

or a laborer responsible for lifting heavy pieces of equip

ment into place. Everyone's contribution matters, even if

the Izzet know that some matter more than others.

AN I ZZET P A RTY

A party made  up entirely of lzzet members might be

a mage (wizard or sorcerer) accompanied by guards

(fighters) and attendants (any class). The structure of the

guild generally assumes that the mage is in charge of

steering the group, but it's possible for any of the other

characters to be the true brains of the operation. This

party lacks healing ability, but alchemist-crafted healing

potions can help sustain the party in the absence of a

dedicated healer.

RA N K  AND  R ENOW N

Renown within the lzzet League brings with it more

responsibility in your chosen field of study, as well as an

increasing ability to choose the activities that interest

you. This greater responsibility and independence is

reflected in a progression of ranks, from that of a mere

attendant to a coveted position on the Izmagnus.

RANK l: R ESEARCHER

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the lzzet League,

Spellcasting or Pact Magic  class feature

When you  have advanced the guild's interests and s ur

vived a few magical experiments, you graduate into a

position where you can conduct experiments yourself.

Only a spellcaster can craft and operate the laboratory

equipment involved in lzzet experiments.

As a researcher, you can request equipment for use in

your experiments and during adventu res. You can se

cure the aid of ld4 barely competent attendants to assist

you. Your attendants use the commoner stat block in

the Monster Manual.

When you achieve this rank, you can help create your

own mizzium apparatus (described in chapter 5). To

do so, you must spend  10 days of downtime in an Jzzet

workshop, assisting a more experienced researcher in

the construction of the device. The apparatus is given

to you at the end of this time. If your apparatus is lost or

destroyed, you can create a replacement by spending 50

gp and another 10 days of downtime.

SCORCHBRINGER  (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Izzet League

Scorchbringers are soldiers assigned to protect lzzet

laboratories. As a scorchbringer, you are given a pyro

converger (described in chapter 5) and are expected to

use it in the defense of lzzet property.  If your pyrocon

verger is lost or destroyed, you can get a replacement

for 50 gp.

RANK 2:  SUPERVISOR

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Izzet League

Whether you're an accomplished researcher, a commit

ted soldier, or even a ded icated (and skilled) attendant,

you are eligible for promotion to a supervisor position.

As a supervisor, you oversee your former peers . Your

role is primarily to translate the instructions of the di

rector above you into concrete tasks that the people who

report to you can accomplish.

If your director sends you on a mission outside the lab

oratory, you receive an Izzet charm (described in chapter

5) at the start of that mission.

As a supervisor, you earn a salary sufficient to main

tain a modest lifestyle.

INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER  (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the

Izzet League, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

Not every researcher chooses to advance through the

ranks of management to become a supervisor. As an in

dependent researcher, you can use the resources of your

laboratory to conduct any kind of experiment. Assisting

you in your research are 2d6 competent attendants (use

the commoner stat block in the Monster Manual, and

give them proficiency in the Arcana skill).

In addition, you can create your own Izzet charm (de

scribed in chapter 5), given 5 days of work and access to

your laboratory. When you do so, any other charms you

have created vanish.

RANK 3:  DIRECTOR

Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Izzet League

You oversee a laboratory and all its personnel. In addi

tion, as a director, you are eligible to join the Izmundi,

the Tzzet board of directors, as a representative of your

laboratory. You must have the approval of Niv-Mizzet,

and a position on this board usually becomes available

only if a vacancy opens up. If you assemble your own

laboratory, you can be added to the board as an addi

tional member.

It's up to the Izmundi to assemble the correct team

to carry out the guildmaster's directives. The Izmundi

decides which laboratory should have primary responsi

bility for any given project, and the director of that labo

ratory is responsible for assigning people to the team.

Within the bounds of Niv-Mizzet's directives, you

have wide latitude in directing the activities of your

laboratory. That means you can steer the researchers of

your laboratory toward the creation of particular items

or effects.

Between adventures, you can maintain yourself at a

comfortable lifestyle as a member of the Izmundi.

RANK 4: ADVISOR

Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the

Izzet League

As one of the most famous members of the guild, you

are eligible to join the ranks of the Izmagnus. The deci

sion to include you  on  this board is solely Niv-Mizzet's.

The number of members on the board isn't fixed, so you

don't need to wait for a vacancy.

As a member of the Izmagnus, you  have the ear of the

dragon guild master. You can never be fu lly aware of the

scope of his plans, but you  know more about them than

anyone aside from  the other members of the board. The

guildmaster listens to your opinion, even though you're

not an ancient dragon with thousands of years of accu

mulated knowledge and wisdom. Ultimately, Niv-Mizzet

tells you what to do- and you (along with your peers) tell

the rest of the guild how to do it.

As a member of the Izmagnus, you can maintain your

self at a wealthy lifestyle between adventures.

ENEMIES AND ALLIES

The Izzet have difficulty relating to the concerns of other

guilds. The closest affinity they feel for another guild is

their respect for the scientific minds of the Simic- but

from the Izzet viewpoint, the Simic efforts lack passion.

Conversely,  the Izzet can appreciate the passion of the

Boros, Gruul, and Rakdos, but they don't agree with the

goals those passions are directed toward.

The Izzet have a reputation for unprovoked aggres

sion, spurred by the ambition of Niv-Mizzet. From your

perspective as a guild member, the ancient dragon has

a good reason for everything he does. If you are sent

to test a new weapon against a suspected Dimir safe

house, a Gruul camp, or a deceptively peaceful Selesnya

enclave, those must s urely be dangerous foes of the

Jzzet. You are also bound to oppose the Dimir when they

steal the secrets of your laboratory's research, the Gruul

when they smash the delicate equipment that supports

your life's work, and the Boros and the Azorius if they

decide that your work presents a danger to the city or

breaks some obscure law.

Sometimes members of other guilds can help advance

your research, intentionally or otherwise. The Izzet are

intelligent enough to recognize their weaknesses, and

adventuresome souls from other guilds can offset those

weaknesses. The healing spells of Boros clerics can be

an invaluable aid, and if a cyclops isn't available to lend

its brute strength to your work, a  Boros minotaur or a

Selesnya centaur can fill  the need nicely.

THE  IZZET V I EW ON  OTHER GUILDS

To the lively intellect of the lzzet, the members of Ravnica's

other gu ilds seem slow, dull, and utterly lacking in the

spirit of scientific inqu iry and experimentation.

Azorius. "The Azorius create regulations for everything,

including freedom . What du ll, shackled lives  they lead."

Boros. "All too often when we're on the verge of setting off

a  little explosion or a spell that tears a hole in  reality,  the

Boros show up to spoil  the fun."

Dimir. "The less we see of the Dimir,  the more we know

they are monitoring us."

Golgari.  "They keep to themselves and clean up our

messes. As  long as they stay out of sight, it's hard to

view them as a threat."

Gruul. "They're even better at wrecking our laboratories

than we are!"

Orzhov. "Progress mea ns taking risks.  But when you gam

ble with the Orzhov, you always wager more than coin."

Rakdos. "Steer clear of these senseless riot-fiends. Their

enthusiasm is best appreciated from  a distance."

Selesnya. "These zealots run with beasts and worship fig

ments of the past. They wou ld be wiser to embrace the

wonders of the future."

Simic. "The Simic are inventive,  but their creations are

bereft of soul and fire. They tinker with life  but lack the

ins piration to breathe t rue spirit into their inventions."

symbol. Small.  ugly. gray-skinned servant creatures at

Doug Beyer,  Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Wealth is power, and you absolutely can take it with you

if you're an undying spirit living in decadent luxury on

the ruling council of the Orzhov Syndicate. Built on the

crushed dreams and broken bodies of citizens deeply

indebted to the syndicate's banks and loan sharks,

Orzhov's elaborate hierarchy of syndics, priests, and

oligarchs exists for the single purpose of funneling

wealth to the top. Beneath the twin facades of religious

hierarchy and banking operation, Orzhov is an orga

nized crime syndicate with its fingers in businesses

across the city.

The Orzhov's original function was  both religious

and financial, with the two functions closely  related.

As Ravnica's dominant church, the Orzhov continues

to preach an oppressive message that equates sin with

debt and promises forgiveness to those who make tithes

and donations. As Ravnica's principal bank, it stores

and secures the riches of the city, collecting inte rest

at high rates to expand its own wealth. Its members

truly believe that their work is necessary to the proper

functioning of Ravnica. Although most other Ravnicans

see the Orzhov for  the corrupt organization it is,  many

people are still dazzled by the syndicate's promises of

wealth. prestige, and longevity.

The Ghost Council, also called the Obzedat, that leads

the Orzhov founded the guild and signed the Guildpact,

but it isn't clear which members of the original Obz.edat

might have faded  from existence since then and which

current members have joined since.

INSIDE THE  SYNDICATE

The Orzhov are ruled by the iron-fisted Obzedat, a coun

cil consisting of the oldest and most powerful undead

oligarchs. A vast hierarchy stretches out beneath them,

so most of your interactions with the leadership of the

guild are with people (or spirits) who occupy the rank

just above yours. This hierarchy has corruption in  it

at every level, and at any time your superiors might be

passing instructions down from on high or just using

you to pursue their own agendas of greed and ambition.

Orzhov churches and basilicas are scattered across

the city, each one led by a ministrant with a staff of

knights and syndics. These sites are centers of com

merce clothed in the trappings of religion, where lowly

borrowers come to seek atonement for their sins - atone

ment that is given in the form of debt and obligation.

Orzhov attorneys and advokists maintain offices near

New Prahv and other Azorius courts. Despite their prox

imity to law enforcement, these offices are centers of op

eration for Orzhov protection rackets and other criminal

activities.

G OALS  OF TH E  0RZH OV

The Orzhov Syndicate is dedicated to  the quest for

power.  It sees the value in an organized, structured,

law-abiding community, because it is adept at exploiting

laws and s tructures for its own gain. It sees itself.  in a

perfect world, as the arbiter and enforcer of a social or

der that keeps everyone in their place and the Orzhov in

the highest place.

Increasing tensions in Ravnica have led to an atmo

sphere of instability, and to counter this, the Orzhov

Syndicate promises the trappings of a stable, ordered

life amid the chaos-for a price. The Orzhov believe that

adherence to hierarchy is the key to success, and they

find  great comfort in the rigid structure of their guild.

To boost their declining profits in a vacillating econ

omy. the Orzhov have begun offering protection ser

vices, promising to shield their "customers" from  both

physical ha rm and fiscal  disaster. These operations

amount to racketeering, bringing with  them the under

lying threat that those who refuse to pay for protection

become targets of the Orzhov's thugs and enforcers.

The Azorius are the greatest threat to Orzhov's opera

tions. In  times past, the Orzhov danced along the edges

of the law and presented an appearance of legality, but

the combination of an ever-expanding legal code and the

guild's move into racketeering and other explicitly illegal

71

activities has made it vulnerable to Azorius enforce

ment. So far, the Azorius have demonstrated more inter

est in cracking down on the chaotic activity of the Gruul

and the Rakdos, but Azorius arresters also routinely

shut down Orzhov protection rackets and take enforc

ers into custody. To make matters worse, the Azorius

Senate's increasing use of precognitive magic is proving

difficult for the Orzhov to work around.

So far, the syndicate's most effective tactic has been

to increase the layers of separation between the day-to

day criminal operations of the guild and the leadership,

ensuring that no matter how many street-level thugs and

syndics are apprehended to fill  the Azorius prisons, the

guild's leadership remains intact. Contact between the

oligarchs and lower-ranking members of the guild is

increasingly rare in this situation, and even the pontiffs

find it ever more difficult to arrange a hearing with their

superiors.

ORZHOV  CHARACT E RS

Alignment: Usually lawful, often evil

Suggested Races: Human

Suggested Classes: Cleric, fighter, rogue, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs

to the Orzhov Syndicate if any of the following sen

tences are true:

You want to move through the corrupt underbelly

of society and make respectable people squirm in

your presence.

You enjoy playing fearsome or decadent characters.

You want to strive for wealth, lavish beauty, or both.

j OINING THE  0 RZHOV SYNDI CATE

At the beginning of your association with the Orzhov,

you are regarded as a borrower. Whether you are the

wealthy scion of an oligarch fami ly or a penniless citi

zen deep in debt to the guild, your status is functionally

equivalent: you owe everything you  have, even your life,

to the Orzhov. Your only hope of improving your status

is through your service to the guild. As you acquire re

nown, you can rise above this debased position in the

guild hierarchy. Choose one of three parallel tracks of

advancement, depending on your capabilities: advokist,

enforcer, or priest.

ADVOKIST

If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in

the School of Abjuration, Divination, or Enchantment),

you can aspire to be an advokist- one of the syndicate's

lawyers, with duties that include overseeing contracts,

representing clients in Azorius courts, and prosecuting

those who fail to pay their debts. Some clerics of the Or

der Domain also choose to pursue this path.

Many advokists draw on the power of law magic to en

force regulations and contracts to the advantage of the

guild. They use their magic to draw out the truth from

debtors and those who dare to break their contracts

with the guild, to ensure that petitioners approach with

the proper humility, and to punish those who offend

them or violate their contracts. Some advokists (partic-

ularly specialists in the School of Abjuration) also deal

in encrypting texts, warding vaults and secret meeting

rooms, fortifying structures, and cloaking important

personages in magical protections.

ENFORCER

Enforcers guard Orzhov property and protect the guild's

bureaucrats, administrators, and aristocrats. You  might

be the muscle who collects protection money and debt

payments from the syndicate's clients, or an assassin

(euphemistically called a euthanist) who brings speedy

ends to lives deemed to have gone on too long. Most

Orzhov enforcers are fighters. Rogue enforcers typically

emulate the Thief or Assassin archetype.

PRIEST

ff you are cleric (most likely of the Order Domain), you

can aspire to serve an important function in the Orzhov

Syndicate, which continues to maintain the outward

appearance of a religious institution. Once you earn a

position of respect in the syndicate, you will hear confes

sions and dole out penance (which is always of a finan

cial nature). Your "calling" centers on collecting mone

tary tithes and offerings in  a wide range of forms. Your

spellcasting ability comes from the collective power of

the spirits that rule the guild, not from a god.

You might even be a most unusual priest for the syndi

cate-one who thinks the guild's wealth should be used

to ease the suffering of the downtrodden. You might

also believe in  the inspiration and delight that beautiful

pageantry can offer to the world. If you seek to distribute

wealth and share beauty, rather than hoard them, you

must do so discreetly to avoid  the ire of the Obzedat.

BACKGROUND: 0 RZHOV

REPRESENTATIVE

The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of

membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild's

endeavors channel wealth from  Ravoican society into

the ranks of the Orzhov- and concentrates the spoils

at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that sys

tem, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of

the money that passes through your hands on its way

up, so that you can work your way into a more promi

nent position.

Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family.

your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until

you have proven your value.

Skill Proficien cies : Intimidation, Religion

Langu ages: Two of your choice

Equipment: An Orzhov insignia, a foot-long chain made

of ten gold coins, vestments, a set of fine clothes,

and a belt pouch containing 1 pp (an Orzhov-minted

10-zino coin)

FEATURE:  LEVERAGE

You can exert leverage over one or more individuals

below you in the guild's hierarchy and demand their

help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a

message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short

carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a

bloody mess you left in an alley. The OM decides if your

demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates

available to fulfill  them. As your status in the guild  im

proves, you gain influence over more people, including

ones in greater positions of power.

wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between

those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance

How Do I  FIT I N?

The structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you

are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the

ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is

defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you

decide for you.

For most of your career, you can expect to engage in

some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the

guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to

enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority

to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean

doing various e rrands for your superiors, from  bearing

messages to carrying out assassinations.

AN 0RZHOV PARTY

An Orzhov adventuring party might be assembled in one

of two ways. If its primary purpose is the application of

brute force, some number of hulking enforcers (fighters)

form the core of the ground, perhaps supported by a

7~

CllJ\l'llR2IGUILD~OlRAVNl<A

stealthy "euthanist" (rogue} and a knight (paladin). A

priest (cleric) could provide additional magical support.

If the group is more focused on the political schem

ing of the Orzhov, involving the use of persuasion and

coercion rather than outright force, a priest (cleric) and

an advokist (wizard) will probably lead the group, ac

companied by more sophisticated bodyguards (fighters

or rogues).

RANK A N D  R ENOWN

The Orzhov adhere to a very strict power structure. Po

s itions open only at the bottom of the organization, and

rising through the ranks requires utmost devotion. With

increasing rank comes a greater degree of leverage over

those who occupy the ranks below you.

R ANK 1:  SYNDIC

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Orzhov

Syndicate

Syndics are low-ranking functionaries. At this level of

the hierarchy, you can expect deference from  borrowers,

who will perform small favors that require no significant

risk, effort. or cost. The bulk of your work for  the guild,

in turn, involves doing favors for those above you.

As a priest of this rank, you can perform minor tasks

in an Orzhov church: collecting tithes at the door, sched

uling appointments for the senior priests, keeping led

gers, and the like. As an advokist, you copy documents,

research legal precedent, depose witnesses, and other

wise assist more senior guild members. As an enforcer,

you Hex your muscle to collect minor debts that are of

little importance to the guild as a whole.

RANK 2:  KNIGHT

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the

Orzhov Syndicate

Each knight carries a title that expresses a quality

of character, such as Knight of Penance or Knight of

Despair. As a knight, you  have authority over syndics,

and you are trusted- so far as anyone in the Orzhov

Syndicate trusts anyone else- to transport large sums of

money. You also have access to sufficient funds to main

tain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

As a priest of this rank, you  hear confessions and

collect penance, lead rites (and take offerings), perform

ceremonies, and offer counsel to your superiors when

asked. As an advokist, you  represent clients in court,

draw up contracts, and put your magic to use in a variety

of ways. As an enforcer, you are entrusted with collect

ing larger sums and interacting with powerful clients.

When you're sent on a mission that poses a potential

threat, your superior bestows on you an Orzhov charm

(described in chapter 5). In addition, you have the au

thority to demand service from borrowers, including

indentured spirits (see chapter 6 for the stat block).

But that's an authority you must use sparingly, since

their service counts as credit to their debt, and it's in the

guild's interest to keep borrowers in debt.

RANK 3:  M I NISTRANT

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the

Orzhov Syndicate

The rank of ministrant is the highest position anyone

can hope to attain without being born into the guild.

As a ministrant, you study finance, while managing the

z

z

GllM'TER 2  I GUILDS OF  RAVNWI\

75

syndics and knights  under your control. Between adven

tures, you can now ma intain a wealthy lifestyle.

You are given a servitor tbrull (see chapter 6 for the

stat block) that is yours to command. If it is killed, your

pontiff gives you a new one at their djscretion, possi-

bly up to  ld4 weeks later. You also have a staff of 2d4

knights and 4d8 syndics under your command. You can

order them only to carry out tasks that contribute to the

work your pontiff assigns to you. The duty of protecting

you from physical harm is a lways appropriate service for

your knights, however. Your knights can be knights or

priests , and your syndics are either nobles or acolytes

(stat blocks for them appear in the Monster Manual).

RANK 4: PONTIFF

Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the

Orzhov Syndicate, Orzhov birth

As a pontiff, you are one of the executive managers in

charge of enacting the will of the Ghost Council. For

that purpose, you  have a staff of 2d6 ministrants (use

the mage or priest stat blocks from the Monster Manual

to represent them), with their attendant knights and

syndics as described for rank 3. You have access to 2d4

servitor thrulls a nd winged tbrulls (see chapter 6 for

these stat blocks) at any given time, to carry messages

and perform menial tasks for you. You also gain the

occasional privilege of speaking with members of the

Obzedat. Between adventures. you can maintain an aris

tocratic lifestyle.

ENEMIES AND ALLIES

A syndicate built on a foundation of exploitation and

extortion can't rely on alliances. The Orzhov appreciate

certain aspects of other guilds' work and missions, but

they treat other guilds as resources to be plundered. In

general, the Orzhov view guilds that promote order and

stability (Azorius, Boros, and Selesnya) more kindly

than guilds that sow chaos and destruction (such as Gol

gari and Rakdos).

Sometimes adherence to order can get in the way of

an efficient c ri me operation, though. and that's when the

Orzhov part ways with the other law-and-order guilds

especially the Azorius. Any guild that obstructs the Or

zhov from amassing more wealth is an enemy, whether

the disruption comes from horning in on Orzhov opera

tions or enforcing laws against racketeering.

The best way to secure individual allies from other

guilds is to make them owe you something. Borrowers

seldom make friendly or especially loyal allies, but they

can be  useful  pawns. You  might form a genuine alliance

with members of other guilds if you s hare a common en

emy:  the overreaching Azorius or Boros, the spies of the

Dimir or assassins of the Golgari, or the rampages and

excesses of the Gruul and  Rakdos. Alternatively, you

might team up with members of a chaotic guild to bring

down an opponent that is causing too much trouble for

Orzhov operations.

TH E 0RZHOV VIEW  ON  OTHER GU I LDS

In the eyes of the Orzhov Syndicate, the other guilds pri

marily represent either opportunities for exploitation or

dangerous threats to its way of life.

Azorius. "Their new laws challenge everything we know

Ravnica  stands for. If they will not protect the people,

then we will do it for them."

Boros. "Though their structure is reasonable, they are

naive in their outlook on justice. What glory i s there in

risking one's life when  work continues in th e afterlife?"

Dim ir. " It's hard to begrudge them their love of secrets.

As  long as they stay out of our business, we will

leave them  be."

Golgari.  "Admirably resourceful and elegant,  but tragically

unhygienic. The swarm ers may persist, as  long as they

don't try to force their aesthetic sensibilities on us."

Gruul.  "They know nothing of order and dignity, and there

fore they serve little purpose as  an  organization."

l zzet. "Combative and obnoxious. Their allegiance lies with

no one, and their naivete isn't worth our time."

Rakdos.  "A necessary source of creativity and satire. Wit

is a dangerous weapon, and their critiques speak to the

people more than fear and surveillance ever will."

Selesnya. "The Selesnya  are idealistic fools. Looking

toward nature ignores the problems at hand in the civi

lized world."

Simic. "Their preoccupation with life disregards the might

that death can provide."

I

CULT OF  RAKDOS

jACE WALKED INTO THE RA.Koos CLUB,  PUSHING INTO

a wall of scents and sounds. The ceilings were surprisingly

high inside, draped with banners and spiked chains. An

impish creature hooted as it dangled from a high wire while

a man in leather chaps swallowed orbs of fire and breathed

them back out through his snaggly teeth. Scarred. black

sca led drakes fought viciously in cages that swung from the

ceiling,  and the stink of sweat and singed flesh wafted from

adjoining alcoves. Against the wall stood an enormous sen

try, somewhere along the spectrum between rotund man

and compact giant, dressed in what looked like the motley

of a harlequin jester crossed with barbed wire.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica : The Secretist

Tomorrow is an illusion; everything is ridiculous. Mem

bers of the Cult of Rakdos have witnessed the grandiose

speeches and self-important plans of other guilds and

concluded that their rivals take themselves far too seri

ously. Since death comes for everyone, and since order

tends inevitably toward chaos, the Rakdos believe that

unrestrained, moment-to-moment hedonism is the only

sane way to live. Of course, few other Ravnicans would

describe the Rakdos as sane.

The CuJt of Rakdos bears the name of the demon lord

who founded  it. As laid out in the Guildpact, the guild

was intended to fill  roles concerning entertainment,

mining, and manual labor. Some argue that any effort

to give a demonic cult a respectable role in society was

doomed to failure, but the cult remains part of Ravnica's

social fabric nevertheless. The Guildpact prohibits the

cult's extermination, and its entertainments-even as

dark and destructive as they are- hold broad appeal.

From rowdy mobs who love to see the Rakdos skewer

the powerful elites to decadent socialites who come to

the Rakdos for illicit amusements, most ofRavnica's

people don't really want the Rakdos to go away, as much

as they might publicly protest otherwise.

I N SIDE THE  CULT

As one of Ravoica's original guild founders, the demon

Rakdos has been part of Ravnica for millennia. Mem

bers of other guilds know Rakdos through his reputa

tion  for capricious cruelty and megalomania, but those

who join the guild idolize him for  his magnetic presence,

which inspires art and encourages utter wantonness.

Because Rakdos finds destruction entertaining, his cult

ists incorporate deadly acts into their performances in

hopes of catching his eye and earning his favor.

Stages for Rakdos performances appear on streets

and plazas throughout Ravnica every night, and they're

gone by morning-carried to and fro on the backs of

giants. Permanent establis hments that cater to dark de

s ires are tucked away in  the seediest neighborhoods of

the city, such as the Smelting Quarter in  Precinct Six of

the Tenth District.

The Cult of Rakdos is centered on a demon lord who ex

emplifies the concepts of chaos and evil. At its worst, the

cult is driven by a lust for power, extreme selfishness,

and a lack of compassion. Cultists take delight in caus

ing pain to others to make sure they know their place,

which is subservient to the powerfu l adherents of this

self-centered philosophy.

The cult's chaotic nature  fu els its passion, impuls ive

ness, and obsession with freedom. A guild of unbridled

hedonism, it does what it wants, driven by base desires

and a strong streak of cruelty.

The Cult of Rakdos was originally recognized as a

guild as part of an effort to channel the impulses of

demons, giants, ogres, and humans into an acceptable

direction. That effort has never been completely suc

cessful.  Now, as tension builds in  Ravnica and severa l

guilds attempt to crack down on chaos and criminal

activity, the Rakdos cult reacts to this building pressure

with increasing viole nce.

The Cult of Rakdos already serves a megalomania

cal demon of chaos, so its  members have no interest

in seeing any other ambitious figure achieve supreme

rulership over Ravnica. They fear that any other guild

might gain enough power to overwhelm all the others

and impose its own values on everyone. For this rea

son, they focus their efforts on subverting other guilds'

schemes, by undermining popular and powerful leaders

t11Al'TIR2  <,UllDSOfR\\1'01<,A

77

and interfering-often violently- with any effort to build

a centralized concentration of authority.

The Azorius Senate currently stands as the greatest

threat to the Rakdos way of life. The cult targets Azorius

senators and arresters for ridicule, harassment, and

occasionally assassination. The Boros Legion's zeal

ous pursuit of order and jus tice poses a similar threat.

Although Boros's attention is focused on the Gruul at

the moment, Rakdos cultists are well aware that any

sufficiently disruptive performance with a high enough

body count could bring the wrath of the legion down on

their heads. The overreaching of the Azorius and the

self-righteous wrath of the Boros engender true fear in

the anarchic Rakdos cultists, and the Rakdos respond

to fear with bloodshed.

R A KDOS  CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually chaotic, often evil

Suggested Races: Human, gobli n

Suggested Classes : Barbarian, bard, fighter, warlock

You might enjoy playing a Rakdos character if any of the

following sentences describe you:

You enjoy mayhem.

You like playing showy, dramatic characters who are

often the center of attention.

You're drawn to bards or warlocks.

The idea of finding a heroic way to participate in a

demonic cu lt sounds like a fun chaJlenge.

j OINING THE  CULT OF  R AKDO S

The Cult of Rakdos attracts misfits and malcontents,

who can't abide the civilized norms of Ravnica, as well

as wayward souls eager to idolize an ancient demon lord

and partake in riots. However, what Ravnicans like most

about the guild is that it has evolved into a roving circus

that attracts hedonistic, anything-goes performers who

really know how to put on a show.

By the time you  start your adventuring career, you no

doubt have a gr eat act ready to go, and you're champing

at the spike-studded bit to get out there and show the

world what you've got.  But you  must earn a place on  the

stage or in the ring, and that means first doing your part

backstage to keep the show running. "Backstage" can

also mean "out in the city," carrying out a variety of er

rands for people who have more pull than you. And with

the Rakdos, such errands tend to look more like adven

tures than like shopping trips.

What does your chosen form of performance look

like? What skills do you aspire to learn? Spikewheel

acrobats, lampooners, fire jugglers, puppeteers,  pain

artists, noise musicians, and hellbeast riders form the

heart of the cult's bizarre entertainments, putting on

shows in guild-owned dark speakeasies and on portable

stages in  the streets. Performers called uncagers tend

and unleash-the variety of beasts and horrors used in

Rakdos shows.

Other Rakdos performers are spellcasters of spec

tacular sort, using expressive, free-wheeling, and

dangerous magic. These mages find  inspiration in the

responses expressed by witnesses of their magic. They

can be equally gratified by howls of laughter or howls of

horror- any attention, in  their minds, is good attention.

Most Rakdos performers are fighters of the Champion

or Eldritch Knight archetype, barbarians of the Path

of the Berserker, or rogues of the Thief or Assassin

archetype. Spellcasting performers are often bards of

the College of Valor or warlocks of the fiend {the demon

lord Rakdos).

BACKGROUND:  RAKDOS  CULTIST

You're an entertainer at heart. a performer with a Hair

for the dramatic and a love of the spotlight. You've spent

years honing your craft, mastering a demanding set

of skills so you can perform them with panache and

make them look easy. The wild applause, the screams of

the crowds, the mayhem and terror spreading into the

streets-this is what you  live for.

You're also a member of a cult devoted to an ancient

demon who delights in violence and chaos. It just so

happens that Rakdos loves a good show, and your high

est aspiration is to please the Defiler, the Lord of Riots,

with your own performance.

S kill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance

Languages: Choose either Abyssal or Giant

Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument

Equipment: A Rakdos insignia, a musical instrument

(one of your choice), a costume, a hooded lantern

made of wrought iron, a  10-foot length of chain with

sharply spiked links, a tinderbox,  10 torches, a set

of common clothes, a belt pouch containing 10 gp (a

mix of Azorius and Boros 1-zino coins), and a bottle of

sweet, red juice

A  FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC

Rakdos performance styles typically fuse standard cir

cus-style acrobatics with fire,  wrought-iron spikes and

hooks, and monsters. You can roll a d8 or choose from

FEATURE:  FEARSOME  REPUTATION

People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rak

dos, and they're careful not to draw your anger or

ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses,

such as refusing to pay for food  at a restaurant or break

ing down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities

witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you

to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.

How Do I FrT IN?

The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on

the part of its  members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and

it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder

before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your

role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disrup

tive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild

mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.

You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents

used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your perfor

mance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a

script. In fact, if you go th rough a performance without

doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly

not trying hard enough.

CllAl'TER 2  GUil.OS OF RA\  NICA

81

A  RAK DOS  PARTY

A Rakdos adventuring party could operate as a perfor

mance troupe, performing a variety of activities under

the cover of its nighttime shows. The master of cere

monies (bard) is the public face of the troupe, with a

number of performers (fighters, barbarians. rogues, or

warlocks) doing their own unique acts. A blood witch

(warlock) might take the place of a s pellcasting per

fo rmer or assume the role of the mas ter of ceremonies.

R ANK AN D  RENOWN

The anarchic nature of the Cult of Rakdos- aside from

the absolute rulership of Rakdos himself- makes rank

a meaningless concept to the members of the guild.

Nevertheless, renown matters: perfor mers who are well

known within the guild also tend to be well known out

side the guild, which means larger audiences. Renown

in  the Cult of Rakdos is the difference between being a

bit player in  someone else's performance and being the

ringmaster of your own show.

EXTRA

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

You  have proven yourself both useful and talented and

have earned a place on stage. It's a small place, and a

dangerous one- bit players like you a re as likely to suf

fer injury or death during a Rakdos performance as au

dience members are. But that's the thrill of live theater!

8:1

<  llAI  I H\ 2  I <.Ull OS  01  R \\NI~\

SrnEsHow ACT

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

You  have gained a reputation both within the Cult of

Rakdos and (to some extent) outside it, though you are

still a long way from achieving top billing. You might

stage performances in back alleys and abandoned ware

houses, with a handful of other performers helping to

bring your vision to life.

When you go on an adventure, you can call on  ld4

helpers- a mix of cackle rs (see chapter 6 for the stat

block), s tage hands, or extras- to help you complete it.

Use the stat blocks of cultists and thugs from the Mon

ster Manual for the stage hands and extras, respectively.

Your status also means that you can venture into the

depths of Rix Maadi, the lair of Rakdos, to petition for

a Rakdos charm (described in chapter 5). Rakdos can

grant a charm with barely a thought, but your station in

the guild doesn't guarantee safe passage to and from  the

demon's presence.

BLOOD WITCH (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos,

the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

The aggressive tormentors known as blood witches

are the closest thing the Cult of Rakdos has to ranking

officials. You can't personally mobilize large numbers of

guild members, but individual  performers, ogres, giants,

and even demons are quick to obey your commands as

long as they don't contradict the ethos of the guild or the

will of Rakdos himself.

When you become a blood witch, you are assigned

to torment a particular enemy of the guild. This enemy

can be an individual, a family, an organization, or even

an abstract concept. Examples of blood witches include

the judge of the judges, who targets the Azorius guild

master; the Tormentor of the Wojek, who confounds

Boros military intelligence efforts; and the Disintegra

tor of Law and Order, who undermines all efforts to

uphold law.

STAR PERFORMER

Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

At last, you have the opportunity to display your genius

to the masses. When you perform, you're the star of the

show, the climax of a night of revelry. The rest of the

guild regards you with admiration and more than a little

envy. since crowds pack whatever venues you choose

for your shows. Rakdos himself might even come to

watch. You can count on the support of your ringmaster,

and you can call on the aid of other performers in your

troupe- just be careful not to turn your back on the ones

who would kill in return for a moment in your spotlight.

You can bring 2d4 Rakdos performers and  ld4 Ra k

dos lampoon ers (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks)

with you when you're going on stage or heading out to

riot on the streets.

RINGMA STER

Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

The show is yours to command. You determine what

performers take center stage and when, and you design

the exciting and bloody final act of the show-meaning

that you decide who lives and who dies. You might adopt

an ominous or overwrought title, such as Choreogra

pher of Flame or the Dramaturge. A troupe of 3d10 +

20 Rakdos p erformers is at your service, and you can

call on 2d4 blood witches to aid you with their magic

(see chapter 6 for these stat blocks). You're probably also

considered a s ignificant public enemy by the Azorius,

but they can't arrest you if they can't catch you.

ENEMIES AND ALLIES

A cult of demon worshipers doesn't make a lot of

friends. Ideologically, the Rakdos have the most in

common with the Gruul and the Golgari; all three

guilds have a desire to topple the structures of power in

Ravnica. Of course, the guilds disagree about what (or

who) should replace the existing structures.

Making the powerful look ridiculous lies at the heart

of the Rakdos performance philosophy. The bulk of the

guild's aggression is directed toward guilds that have

power and abuse it or guilds that make blatant bids for

power. That's particularly true when powerful guilds

especially the Azorius- try to use their power to sup

press the Rakdos.

Making the ridic ulous powerful is the fl ip side of the

Rakdos philosophy. Usually, this means elevating the

status of the Rakdos-and yourself- at the expense of

others, but circumstances might lead you to cooperate

with members of other guilds in pursuit of a common

goal. For example, a power struggle in another guild can

be an opportunity for you  to install a sympathetic (or in

effectual) leader in that guild.  Beyond that, other chaotic

guilds have grudges against the law-enforcing guilds

and would be happy to join your efforts to strike a blow

against them.

THE R A KOOS VIEW ON  O T HER GU I LDS

The Cult of Rakdos serves a demon lord who is  feared,

if not respected, by  most citizens of Ravnica.  Its cultists

express their zeal th rough riotous, bloody,  and deadly  per

formances and revels. To other guilds, they are a fearsome

threat to the city. To the Rakdos, the other guilds invest too

much effort in  a vain search for meaning and might.

Azorius. "Insufferable killjoys, and every artist's eternal

enemy.  Everyone thinks we are the guild of ultimate evil,

but we're not the ones who want to  monitor, legislate,

and control your every move."

Boros. "We  love a parade, but their demonstrations always

come across as stiff. They're the deserving straight man

for our every punch line."

Dimir. "They crave secrets, but there's nothing they can

get by eavesdropping that we won't freely scream at the

top of our lungs. They lurk in  the shadows trying to look

mysterious, practically inviting our mischief."

Golgari. "We know they're tired  of being the downtrodden,

misunderstood misfits. If they're truly ready to anger

the powers that be rather than lick boot soles, we invite

them to run away and join our circus."

Gru ul.  "Our well-meaning cousins in chaos! We want to

take society down a peg, and they want to raze civiliza

tion to the dirt. That's practically common ground!"

lzzet. "Every performance benefits from  prop masters and

pyrotechnicians. They can be usefu l backstage, but they

lack  the charisma for the spotlight."

Orzhov. "The more the Orzhov try to coerce free  people

to act against their desires, the easier it is  for  Rakdos to

gain recruits."

Seles nya. "Such crowds! They would scarcely notice if they

were  missing a few  by night's end. They'd  make the per

feet audience, if only they had a better appreciation for

bleeding-edge art."

Simic.  "Imaginative creators who  nevertheless fail  to

appreciate the meaning of their living creations-nor

do they appreciate the tragic irony of not knowing how

funny that is."

CHo\Pfl::R2  GUILDSOFRA\NIC.\

in a similar way. The original mission of the conclave

involved conservation and charity, but its focus has long

been on expanding its community, in which all members

are cared for and nature is preserved in harmony with

civilization.

INSIDE THE  CONCLAVE

The Selesnya Conclave is organized into enclaves called

vernadi, which are communes built around central

trees. The vernadi are smaller versions of the guildhall,

the great city-tree Vitu-Ghazi. A dryad, called a voda,

is called forth  from  that central tree to be the leader of

the community, connecting the vernadi and its devotees

to the Worldsoul and uniting them with the will of the

entire conclave.

A voda is accessible to all the guild members in her

care. You  have regular contact with your voda. who

knows your name and has a good idea of your interests,

goals, and strengths. And since your voda is mystically

linked to the guildmaster, Trostani, through communion

with the Worldsoul, it's safe to assume that Trostani

knows who you are as well.

In addition to the voda, military and religious leaders

in each vernadi regularly communicate with its mem

bers. Ordinary members of the conclave spend a few

hours every day training with a military instructor and

studying with a religious teacher.

GOALS  OF T HE  S ELE SNYA

Despite the growing tensions that now grip the world,

in the long view of the Selesnya Conclave, not much

has changed. Ravnica is troubled, but Ravnica has

always been troubled. The Living Guildpact is absent,

but the Guildpact comes and goes. The Worldsoul has

not changed, nor has the will of Mat'Selesnya: the con

clave's main goal is to grow, as it has always been. fts

strength lies in its numbers.

The conclave clings to the ideal of a peaceful collec

tive in which individual desires are subordinate to the

good of the whole group. The guild wants to see this

beloved community grow, flourish, and thrive in peace.

But as much as it values peace within the community,

it displays incredible ferocity when that harmony is

threatened.

Selesnya's vision is centered on the idea of harmony

between civilization and nature. To advance the cause

of civilized society, the conclave believes in the need

for an ordered structure that orients the group toward

<C z

r

SELESNYA  CONCLAVE

SELESNYA TROOPS POURED INTO THE STREETS,

emptying the nature temples,  wildlife preserves, and other

green spaces controlled by the conclave.  The centaurs'

hooves clattered on the cobblestones and the wolf-rid-

ers bounded over stone bridges. Human and elf infantry

flooded through the arteries of the district. streaming past

intersections and flowing around buildings. Criffons and

their riders swooped down out of a blanket of low clouds,

strafing past the spires. Emmara rode on the shoulder of

a massive creature made of a snarl of marble, wood, and

vines, her hand resting on its great head. Two more of the

nature behemoths strode ahead of her. swinging their limbs

in slow motion, indenting the streets with their footfalls as

the other Selesnya troops ran between their legs.  Below her,

Captain Calomir led the Selesnya army. He rode his white

war rhino,  driving the Selesnya ranks forward, guiding

them through the streets toward the Rakdos horde.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly

fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are

a harmonious union of nature and civilization. The

members of the conclave dream of embracing all of

Ravnica in their peaceful union. In the meantime, they

are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition

and destructive impulses of the other guilds and fight to

defend their way of life.

At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is

the Worldsoul, called Mat'Selesnya, which its devotees

believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the

signing of the original Guildpact, Mat'Selesnya was

embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's

first guild master.  The current guildmaster, Trostani

three dryads fused  together with Mat'Selesnya into a

single being- is said  to embody the will of the Worldsoul

8.j

CllAPnR2  c;u11uso1  k\\Sl<A

the pursuit of the common good. At the same time, the

guild's connection with the natural world gives the con

clave a fervent appreciation for the interconnectedness

of all things. Selesnya doesn't tolerate selfishness or

ambition, instead urging its members to put the needs of

others ahead of their own desires and to use the power

of nature- including nature's wrath- to drive away those

whose selfishness threatens the coherence of the group.

The greatest danger that Selesnya faces lies in the

ambitions of other guilds, which are flourishing in  the

absence of the Guildpact. Selesnya's way of curbing this

grasping selfishness has always been to outnumber the

other guilds. Its members aren't naive; they fully  realize

that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence.

And they aim to be prepared for that violence when

it erupts.

'For my seedlings to survive," Mat'Selesnya says, "we

must grow an army capable of overwhelming such ambi

tions." Some of that army is literally grown, in the case

of plant creatures and elementals. A great many mem

bers grow up in  the guild from childhood and learn their

martial skills at the guild's training grounds. And still

more join the guild through recruitment- especially in

these troubling times. when rumors of war and a sense

of imminent doom make Selesnya's message of harmo

nious community sound ever more appealing.

SELESNYA CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually good, often neutral

Suggested Races: Human. centaur, elf(wood), half

elf, loxodon

Suggested Classes: Bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk,

paladin, ranger, warlock

You might enjoy playing a Selesnya Conclave character

if one or more of the fo111owing statements are true:

You like the idea of being part of a huge, peaceful

community.

You  like playing druids, rangers, or spiritual monks.

You  believe in victory through respectful teamwork,

overwhelm ing numbers, or both.

You  want a spi ritual connection to something bigger

than just your character.

JOI N I NG  T H E  SEL ESNYA  C O N CLAVE

New initiates come to the Selesnya Conclave as chil

dren, to be brought up by the guild's members, or as

recruits drawn from  the guild less or the membership

of other guilds. Regardless of the path you  took to get

here, you start out in  the role of initiate. As an initiate,

you must subsume your desires to the needs of the

guild while finding a way (under the guidance of your

enclave's leader) to put your talents to use in service to

Mat'Selesnya. This effort isn't so much a process of car

rying out orders, but of gradually discerning the will of

the Worldsoul and finding your place in it.

ln your search for communion with the Worldsoul,

you are part of a worldwide community, but you are also

part of a smaller local community- an enclave called a

vernadi, which is led by a dryad called a voda. Your role

in the conclave is specifically oriented toward your ver-

nadi, at least at the start of your career. Your voda helps

you  in your process of discerning the will of Mat'Sele

snya and your place in relation to it.

The Selesnya Conclave is both a community of wor

shipers and a militia, and thus its leadership includes

both military and religious figures.

M I LITARY  ROLES

Selesnya looks from  the outside like a peaceful commu

nity, but it is also an army. If you  are a fighter, a ranger,

or a paladin (usually having sworn the Oath of the An

cients), your place in the guild is a military one. Unlike

in the Boros Legion, though, the conclave's milicary

ranks aren't highly structured; each enclave has its own

forces, with a single commander and one other layer of

command (at most) above the troops. A variety of special

military roles become available to you as you prove your

self useful to your vernadi and the conclave. You might

aspire to be a votary standing watch over the temple

gardens, a sagittar archer, a pegasus-riding equenaut, or

a wolf-riding Ledev guardian.

RELI GIOUS  R OLES

If you are a druid (perhaps of the Circle of the Land),

a cleric (of the Life or the Nature Domain), a warlock

with the Archfey (Mat'Selesnya) as a patron. or a devout

monk (who might follow the Way of the Open Hand), you

might be drawn to a role of religious leadership. These

leaders mediate the relationship between the members

CBAPl~R2  OUllOSOFRA\~IC"A

85

of the conclave and the voice of Mat'Selesnya. A number

of special roles will be available to you as you establish

your place. You  might hope to carry the message of the

conclave out into the world as an evangel, and great reli

gious leaders are honored with the title of hierarch.

BACKGROUND:  SELESNYA INITIATE

members cultivate contacts throughout the guild. The

guild also engages in energetic recruitment to draw con

H ow D o  I  FIT  IN?

Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugat

ing the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also

celebrates the diversity of individuals, in  the same sense

that a field  that produces different crops is healthier

than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies

to your s kills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts

are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild

rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put

your talents to work in your unique way.

That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that

you are part of a larger community. That includes the

whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start

with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader).

The dryads want to know what you're doing and what

purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions

or even expel you from the guild- if they determine that

you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.

A  SELESNYA PARTY

An adventuring party is a community in itself. a symbi

otic group in which each individual contributes to the

success of the whole. A fighter, a ranger, or a paladin

provides a starting point of martial might. A druid or a

cleric offers support and healing. A bard or a warlock

gives add itional spell support. A monk, a bard, or a

ranger can add some measure of stealth and skill spe

cialties. Such a group is well equipped to help Selesnya

grow-and to smite the guild's enemies.

RANK AN D  R ENOWN

The Selesnya Conclave doesn't classify its members in a

rigid hierarchy, because doing that would encourage in

dividuals to seek to rise above the rest of the community

and put their desires above the good of the whole. Thus,

aside from  the leadership of Trostani over the whole

guild, and each voda over her vernadi, the members of

the conclave are distinguished mainly by the diverse

roles they fill  instead of by rank or status.

Indeed, many Selesnya initiates never leave that ba

sic role. They have discerned their purpose, and it is

to live a proper life in support of the conclave, without

pursuing any kind of prestigious role. But if you achieve

greater renown in  the guild, a variety of special roles be

come available to you.

88

Cll \l'I f.R  2  GUILDS Ot  RA\ "Ill A

Regardless of renown and role, members of the con

clave don't earn salaries. The guild cares for its own,

however, and every member can live in a veroadi at the

equivalent of a modest lifestyle.

EVANGEL (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the S elesnya

Conclave

Evangels extend their hands to potential converts and

welcome new initiates into the life of the Selesnya Con

clave. They include fervent preachers who speak the will

of the Worldsoul in  the promenades a nd marketplaces,

humble missionaries who serve among the poor in the

darkest districts of the city, and even centaur warriors

who evangelize in Gruul territories where words of war

speak louder than prayers of peace.

When you become an evangel, you gain one additional

contact from a guild other than the Selesnya Conclave,

which can be someone you have met in your adventures

or chosen from the Non-Selesnya Contacts table earlier

in this section. In your new role, you belong to a vernadi

and can expect help and support from that community,

but you spend your time away from it, operating with

a great deal of independence. When you  return to your

vernadi, you teach and train new initiates.

VOTARY (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya

Conclave, proficiency with martial weapons

Votaries are soldiers who protect the vernadi gardens

in the area immediately around its central tree. As a

votary, you are usually assigned to guard duty, but your

voda might also assign you to special missions that re

quire strength of arms.

While you are in the garden you're sworn to protect,

the plants obey your word, allowing you to transform the

foliage into ld6 awa kened shrubs or 1 awakened tree

(both described in the Monster Manual) for as long as

a threat to the garden persists. These awakened plants

won't leave the garden.

SAGITTAR (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the S elesnya

Conclave. proficiency with the longbow

Sagittars are archers who defend key guild locatfons,

including the guildhall at Vitu-Ghazi. Their range and

accuracy a re so great that a common saying has arisen

among Ravnicans: "Sagittars aim their bows using

maps." If a conclave mission would benefit from the sup

port of disciplined archers, Trostani herself might call

on sagittars to render aid.

As a sagittar, you never have to want for arrows; the

guild provides arrows to you at no cost.

SELESNYA  CHARM

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the S elesnya

Conclave

You can request that the voda of your vernadi bestow a

Selesnya charm (described in chapter 5) on you before

you  undertake any mission on  the guild's behalf.

EQUENAUT (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya

Conclave, proficiency in Animal Handling

Equenauts are knights who ride pegasi and serve as

warriors and scouts. In addition to surveilling en-

emy forces and terrain, they are a lso on the lookout

for places where a new vernadi can take root. As an

equenaut, you are sometimes called on to take part in

military activity, but you a re free to pursue your vision of

how to serve Mat'Selesnya- from  the back of your pega

sus mount (see the stat block in the Monster Manual).

Your mount effectively belongs to you, entrusted to

your care. If it comes to harm through your negligence

or mistreatment, you might be punished-perhaps to the

extent of losing your position as an equenaut.

HIERARCH  (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya

Conclave, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

The ranks of the Selesnya clergy aren't hierarchical,

yet you are honored with the title of hierarch. Hierarchs

lead rites that invoke the blessing of Mat'Selesnya.

bringing Selesnya's initiates into closer communion

with the Worldsoul and with each other. They are as

sisted in these rites by less experienced clergy.

As a hierarch, you can call on the aid of ld4 acolytes

(see the stat block in the Monster Manual), even leading

them on  missions.

You  have an important voice in decision-making for

your vernadi, and you are expected to offer advice and

opinions to your voda when requested.

Your position within the guild and your vernadi gives

you access to superior food and lodging, the equivalent

of a comfortable lifestyle.

LEDEV GUARDIAN  (SPECIAL RoLE)

Prerequisite: R enown 25 or higher in the Selesnya

Conclave,  10th level or higher

The Ledev guardians are knights who were originally

protectors of Ravnica's roadways but now serve the

Selesnya as champions. Their ranks include a number

of centaurs. The humanoids among them ride dire

wolves, which they raise from  pups to forge close bonds

between rider and mount. If you  have a dire wolf mount,

it effectively belongs to you (see the Monster Manual for

the stat block).

DIGNITARY (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: R enown 50 or higher in the Selesnya

Conclave

Chosen by Trostani herself, dignitaries act as emissar

ies in dealing with other guilds. As a dignitary, you  must

be available when Trostani has need of your service,

but you have great latitude to pursue your vision of the

guild's goals. You can call on  lOdlO Selesnya initiates

to support you in your missions for Trostani, and 8d10

initiates for a mission of your own devising. These initi

ates are acolytes, scouts (both described in the Monster

Manual), or soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block).

Your position gives you access to the best food and

lodging, the equivalent of a wealthy lifestyle.

ENEMIES  AND ALLIES

The Selesnya philosophy is one that embraces all of

Ravnica. Everyone is a potential ally, until the moment

they demonstrate their hostility to the conclave or the

will of the Worldsoul. The Selesnya have di fficulty with

the riotous R akdos, the sinister D i m ir, and the chaotic

Izzet, but their focus on ordered community and ver dant

nature gives them some amount of common gr ound

with every other guild.

Any guild can become an enemy of the conclave,

though, if its guildmaster's ambitions- or rogue agents

within the guild-upset the balance of power on

Ravnica. From the other side, many other guilds see

the Selesnya as a quiet threat and seek to diminish its

strength before its numbers grow out of contr ol, so as a

member of the conclave you are duty-bound to oppose

their operations of sabotage. The wanton plunder of

Ravnica's natural resources can also provoke the Sele

snya to take action.

When member s of other guilds pursue noble aims

promoting peace, strengthening community, and oppos

ing other guilds' efforts to expand- they act as allies of

the conclave and thus your allies. Furthermore, they are

potential recruits into the fold, since they have demon

strated their sympathy for Selesnya's goals and their

value to the commun ity.

T HE S ELESN YA VIEW O N  O T H ER  G U ILDS

In the Selesnya vision of a perfect Ravnica, the guilds

would be abolished and all  people would live in harmony

with nature and each other. Until such a vision comes to

pass, the conclave judges the other guilds against that

standard of perfection.

Azorius. "Al l thei r laws are meant to create a sem blance of

the unity that binds us already.  If they would only be still

and listen to the voice of Mat'Selesnya."

Boros. "Sooner or later they will  tire of their fighting,  and

when they do, the gentle embrace of the Selesnya will  be

waiting for them."

Oimir. "Just as they hide from  the light and cling to the

shadows, they hide from  life and cling to secrets. They

see everything as a scheme, everyone a tool, instead of

recognizing the power of unity and  mutual growth."

Colgari. "They wallow in filth  and rot, too preoccu pied with

death to appreciate the bliss of life's con nections."

Cruul. "They are a desperate echo of what they shou ld be,

reaching blindly toward something greater. Such a waste.

And a smelly, unreasonable, destructive one at that."

lzzet. "The path to unity doesn't lie in the oppressive

control of a massive ego like the dragon's. The lzzet can

tinker and meddle all they like,  but they are doomed

to failure."

Orzhov. "An  endless stream of grasping hands, reaching

for  more and more, pursuing their individual ambitions

at all  costs-even from  beyond the grave."

Rakdos. "They laugh at tragedy and wallow in pain. Even

tually,  they will  submit to Mat'Selesnya.  Until  then, they

must be contained."

Simic. "They chart a twisted course of wa rping and  man

gling life and  nature. Yes,  we must grow and adapt, but

nature will  take its own time in completing that task."



SIMIC  COMBINE

THE SIMIC REPRESENTATIVE WAS A STERN-LOOKING

mage whose parentage appeared to be part!Y human and

part/y aquatic, possib!Y merfolk: he rode astride a creature

that seemed the offspring of a giant,  blue-carapaced crab

and an irate squid. The Simic squad was rounded out by a

host of mages clad in scale armor, and improbable hybrid

fusions of scaled, finned,  and shelled creatures.

Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The secrets of life are revealed in the laboratories of

the Simic, and their research notes plumb and catalog

nature's wonders. Their original mission was to oversee

issues of public health, but the Simic came to beUeve

that complete health-of individuals and of society as a

whole-depends on the mutual adaptation of nature and

civilization to one another. T hus, biological experimen

tation has always been among its primary concerns.

Historically, the guild's approach to its mission has

been one of incremental progress toward a utopian ideal

of thriving biology, and it remains more aloof from poli

tics than other guilds. Its fundamental mission remains

unchanged by the current political instability, and the

isolation of its laboratories protects most Simic guild

members from immediate harm.

Little is known about the combine's founder, except

that this individual's first or family name was Simic.

INSIDE THE  COMBINE

Vast sinkholes called zonots are the primary geographic

divisions among the Simic. Each zonot pierces layer

upon layer of crumbled city as it descends deep below

the surface and connects to ancient, long-forgotten

ocean waters. A zonot is a distinct Simic habitat with its

own culture and ecosystem, as well as a leader called

a Speaker. The Speakers of all  nine zonots form the

Speakers' Chamber, and they elect a Prime Speaker

from among them to serve as the Simic guildmaster.

Zegana, the current Prime Speaker, is the Speaker of

Zonot One, which is located in a remote, sparsely inhab

ited part of Ravnica far from the political activity of the

Tenth District.

The Simic guildhall, Zameck, is located in Zonot

Seven within Precinct Five of Ravnica's Tenth District.

A huge chamber just below the street serves as the

gathering place for all the Speakers, as well as a loca

tion where non-Simic visitors can meet with the Prime

Speaker or other combine emissaries.

GOALS  OF THE S!MIC

Two philosophical principles, in tension with each

other, combine to give the Simic Combine its unique

approach to science and nature. In traditional Simic

thought, these principles are called the Holdfast and the

Upwelling.

The Holdfast principle, named for the biological mech

anism that keeps kelp and sponges anchored to the sea

floor, advises members of the Simic Combine never to

stray so far from nature that they become "adrift." It es

pouses the idea that nature left undisturbed will evolve

toward adaptive traits and increased strength. Nature

will flourish and grow, and every creature will find its

proper niche in the ecosystem where it can thrive.

The Upwelling principle, named for the phenomenon

of nutrient-rich water rising to the ocean surface, advo

cates that the new and enlivened should  replace the old

and depleted in an unending cycle, bringing constant re

freshment and renewal. This principle accounts for  the

combine's analytical bent and its emphasis on knowl

edge as a means of transformation. Learning the secrets

of the universe lets you shape the world as you desire.

The Upwelling encourages every creature to discover its

full  potential.

The Holdfast encourages the Simic to promote nature;

the Upwelling urges them to perfect nature. The end

result is the same: a hastened system of evolution that

brings out the best in every creature's nature. But differ

ent factions within the Simic Combine interpret these

principles in their own ways.

The leadership of the Simic Combine represents the

traditional philosophy of the Utopians. Their vision is of

an ideal world in which nature and civilization exist in

balance, in which natural life adapts to life in the midst

CHAPTER 2  I GUlLDS  OF RAVNICA

91

of modern civilization and the civilized world adapts

to accommodate these creatures. Utopians generally

interpret the Holdfast principle as being about staying

rooted in nature, and the Upwelling as concerned with

slow, predictable, cyclical improvement. So they remain

hidden in  their subaquatic laboratories, pursuing their

research while isolated from the volatile interrelation

ships among the other guilds. Prime Speaker Zegana

encourages that isolationist attitude.

At the same time, a growing faction within the Simic

believes that an a ll-out war among the guilds is inevi

table, given the growing unrest in  the city. These mem

bers, the Adaptationists, believe that the guilds exist in

a fragi le ecosystem in which the slightest imbalance can

have cascading effects. With an absent Living Guild

pact failing to maintain the balance, only catastrophe

can result. The Simic must change in order to survive,

and slow, small steps in pursuit of an ideal vision aren't

enough. The future of the guild is in imminent danger,

and the Simic need to focus on survival. Adaptationists

tend to interpret the Holdfast as being about defense

and security, and the Upwelling as a call for sudden, dis

ruptive growth.

As befits members of a guild of scientists, the Adap

tationists' preparations for war include the creation of

soldiers that are magically and biologically adapted.

The Guardian Project has yielded hybrids that combine

human, elf, or vedalken stock with the characteristics of

crabs, fish, jellyfish, and a variety of other creatures to

give them natural armor and weapons, gills, venomous

stings, and other combat-focused adaptations.

CHAPrl:.R 2  ClllLUS  Of RAVNICA

SIMIC  CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually neutral

Suggested Races : Human, elf (high), Simic

hybrid, vedalken

Su ggested Class es: Druid, fighter, monk, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the

Simic Combine if one or more of the following state

ments are true:

You are drawn to the image of the mad scientist

tinkering with the fundamental forces of life.

You like playing curious wizards, druids, or mutants.

Prying into secrets and mysteries inspires your

curiosity.

You want to make the world a better place

through research.

JOINING THE SIMIC  COMBINE

Many paths lead people to the Simic Combine, all

of them guided by the notion that tomorrow can be

made better than today. All of the guild's efforts strive

to achieve a utopian future that they believe is within

reach. When you join the Simic, choose one of the fol

lowing roles for your character.

SCIENTIST

If you are a spellcaster such as a wizard or a druid, you

can find a natural home among the Simic as a scientist,

magically manipulating the fo rces of life and nature

to shift the world toward the guild's utopian ideal.

Most Simic wizards specialize in the School of Trans

mutation, using their magic to alter living creatures

or alter the natural environment. Simic druids often

choose the Circle of the Land, putting similar magic to

the guild's service. Those who focus on  manipulating

<

life forms are known as biomancers, while those who

focus on water, weather, and atmospheric conditions are

called terraformers, but you can choose your own path

of research.

GUA RD IAN

If you  are playing a Simic hybrid, you  in itially became

involved in Simic research as a test subject in the

Guardian Project. You  volunteered to participate, but it's

possible there was some pressure on you, or you viewed

it as the only way to be accepted in  the guild. Your

biological modifications make you ideally suited to spe

cific tasks, and you  might come to operate as a spy, an

infiltrator, or brute muscle. Good class options include

fighter or rogue (of any archetype), or a monk of the Way

of the Open Hand.

D EE PSAGE

You  might instead choose an ascetic, contemplative life

as a deepsage (perhaps as a wizard or monk). You would

devote yourself to meditating on the philosophical prin

ciples of the Holdfast and the Upwelling, a pair of com

plementary ideas that describe the Simic approach to

nature and the city. Deepsages inscribe short philosoph

ical riddles, bordering on paradoxes, into shel1s, exo

s keletons, and stones, and Simic guild members reflect

on these sayings to advance their understanding of the

combine's role in the world.  Deepsage wizards typically

specialize in  the School of Conjuration, and deepsage

monks follow the Way of the Four Elements (focusing on

air and water over the other two elements).

B ACKGROU ND:  SIMI C  SCIENTI ST

Imagine a perfect world: one in which nature and civi

lization exist in harmony, adapted to each other; one in

which life is shaped to match its environment and the

environment is shaped to match life. That's the world

you have been trying to grow in  the laboratories of the

Simic Combine. Nature is all about adaptation, evolu

tion, and balance- but for it to keep up with the pace of

advancing civilization, nature needs some help from  bio

mancers and terraformers. If, along the way, you  happen

to create super-soldiers and mutant monsters that can

bolster the combine's defenses against the schemes and

ambitions of the other guilds, so much the better.

GLADES AND  PROJECTS

As a Simic researcher, you are part of a clade-a diverse

FEATURE:  RESEARCH ER

When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scien

tific fact, if you don't know that information, you know

where and from  whom you can obtain it. Usually, this in

formation comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes

from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an inde

pendent scholar or other learned person or creature.

Knowing where the information can be found doesn't

automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to

offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people

to reveal their secrets.

Your OM might rule that the knowledge you seek

is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it

simply can't be found.  Unearthing the deepest secrets

of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a

whole campaign.

creatures. Blue-green eddies of magical energy some

times accompany your spellcasting, forming spirals that

reflect the mathematical perfection of nature.

SUGGESTED  CHARACTERISTICS

The bizarre science of the Simic Combine attracts a

certain type of personality and encompasses a set of be

liefs about the nature of life. Simic members' bonds and

flaws derive from their scientific research-including

their creation of new life forms, which they can become

very attached to.

The fluid  nature of clades, whose rosters span different

laboratories and change as researchers discover new in

terests, creates abundant connections among the Simic.

The guild members live in watery sinkholes called

zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much con

tact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic

members are former members of other guilds.

How Do I FIT IN?

As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with

the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and

tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open

conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that

the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of

defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots

or shielding S imic research from Azorius intrusion. It

could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to main

tain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at

undermining another guild's grab for power.

Self-improvement is also a n important part of your

mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more

capable- whether learning a new s pell or adopting a

new hybridizing mutation- gives the Simic a stronger

weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to

survive, and that means individual members of the guild

must grow and adapt as well.

A  S I MIC  PA RTY

An adventuring party drawn from the ranks of the Simic

is typically formed around the nucleus of one or two

mages, perhaps a biomancer (wizard) or a terraformer

(druid). They might be accompanied by a soldier (proba

bly a S imic hybrid fighter) and a deepsage (monk).

RANK AND  RENOWN

Tiers of respons ibility and importance-functional

ranks- create a hierarchy among the scientists of the

Simic Combine. A scientist's course of advancement is

the path of increasing responsibility within a clade or

project. Guardians and deepsages have more limited op

portunities for advancement, though they still gain the

benefits of high renown scores.

R ANK 1: TECH NIC IA N

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Simic Combine,

Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

As a technician, you can begin performing experiments,

following the instructions of a researcher as you operate

instruments, care for experimental subjects, extract

samples of bodily fluids, and run errands up and down

the zonot and out into the city. Such errands can bring

you  into contact with members of other guilds and lead

to adventures.

1 f you have any kind of pet, familiar, mount, or animal

companion, you  can add one random adaptation to it

from the Minor Adaptations table (see the krasis section

in chapter 6). Doing so requires ld6 days of work (8

hours per day) for each creature, and the work must be

done in  a Simic facility.

Cl! \1'11  R"  <l  l l  D~ nF RA\ 'llCA

95

RANK 2:  RESEARCHER

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown JO or higher in the

Simic Combine

After doing your time as a technician, you are eligible

to lead your own experiments. You must be associated

with a clade or a project, and must work on experiments

related to its  primary focus under the general guidance

of the clade or project leader. Project leaders are more

hands-on, ensuring that your research contributes to

reaching the immediate objective. Clade leaders check

in from time to time, but they give you wide latitude to

pursue your own experiments under the general aegis of

the clade's interests.

If your research requires it, your project leader or

clade leader can equip you with a Simic charm (de

scribed in chapter 5) before you undertake a mission or

an experiment. In addition, you can call on a category

1 krasis (see chapter 6 for  the stat block) to assist you

on any mission authorized by the guild. You choose the

krasis's two adaptations.

LUMINARY (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Simic

Combine

As a guardian, deepsage, or other non-scientist within

the Simic, you don't progress through ranks, but as a

luminary you might be entrusted with the leadership of

guerrilla or espionage missions, with other Simic hybrid

agents under your command. Or you might be respected

as a wise and enlightened teacher.

ff your work for the guild requires it, a project leader.

clade leader, or other superior can equip you with a

Simic charm (described in chapter 5) before you under

take a mission or an experiment on  the guild's behalf.

In  addition, when you're on guild business, you can

call on the following Simic hybrid agents to assist you:

one hybrid brute or hybrid flier, up to two hybrid poi

soners or hybrid shockers, or ld4 hybrid spies (see

chapter 6 for these stat blocks).

RANK 3:  PROJECT LEADER

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the

Simic Combine

A proven researcher, you are eligible to oversee your

own project, directing the efforts of other researchers

toward the solution of some problem facing the guild.

The Speaker of your zonot gives you laboratory space,

and you have a staff of 3d12 researchers (which use the

stat blocks of commoners or merfolk from  the Monster

Manual). You can have this staff work on projects for

you, which can include the creation of a category 2 kra

sis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) with adaptations of

your choosing, which you can then bring outside the lab

oratory on important business, ideally under carefully

controlled conditions.

Hosting the work of a successful and important

project reflects well on  the Speaker of a zonot, so your

Speaker keeps a close eye on your work. On the positive

9G

CHAl'l~R'.! I  GUiii!::>  Of  KA\NICA

side, you can count on access to the considerable re

sources of the zonot as long as your research is going

well. On the other hand, you can expect your Speaker to

try to meddle in your work to ensure that your efforts re

main relevant to the overall goals of the Simic Combine.

RANK4:CLADELEADER

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 50 or higher in the

Simic Combine

As a famous researcher or a successful project leader,

you stand ready to take on a supervisory role for an en

tire clade. New clades rarely form, so you must wait for

your clade leader to retire (one way or another) before a

position exists for you to fill,  except in truly exceptional

circumstances. Similar to a project leader, you are re

sponsible for directing the efforts of researchers explor

ing a wide variety of projects related to the focus of your

clade. Unless an experiment turns out to be especially

interesting, these efforts can carry on without your su

pervision. If you need to, you can enlist the aid of Sd 12

researchers (which use the stat blocks of commoners

or merfolk from the Monster Manual), and you can

also request the support of hybrids, krasis, or any other

creature associated with the Simic Combine (see the list

in chapter 6) from  the Speaker of any zonot where the

members of your clade live and work.

Because most clades span multiple zonots, you

have status equal to the Speakers of the zonots. You

have no voice on the Speakers' Chamber, unless you

can persuade one or more of its members to speak on

your behalf.

SPEAKER (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Simic

Combine

You are eligible to become the Speaker of a zonot. The

selection of a new Speaker (in the event of an existing

Speaker's retiring, dying, or otherwise leaving the po

s ition) takes place through a combination of popular

election and the input of the other eight Speakers, with

the current Prime Speaker having the final word. If you

emerge as the victor after this rigorous process, you as

sume the leadership of your zonot and are empowered

to bring its concerns before the Speakers' Chamber.

You are a political leader rather than a scientific one,

so you have authority over other members of the com

bine only if they live and work in your zonot. If a clade

has a laboratory in your zonot, you have the right (and

responsibility) to supervise its activities to ensure com

pliance with laws and regulations, but not to interfere

in its research beyond that point. And if the clade leader

lives in a different zonot, you have no authority whatso

ever over that person.

ENEMI ES  AND ALLIES

The Simic Combine has an affinity for guilds that care

for  the forces of nature, and as such it has worked along

side the Selesnya, Gruul, and Golgari in the past. To a

lesser extent, the combine also has a rappor t with the

other scientific guild, the Izzet. But overall, the Simic

attitude toward other guilds is one of healthy caution

bolstered by a general tendency toward isolation.

Any guild could break the peace and send the entire

world spiraling into war, so all the guilds are potential

enemies-particularly if they direct their aggression at

the Simic Combine. The Golgari Swarm has launched

a direct attack against Zonot Four (located in the Sixth

District), and they could expand that attack to other

zonots at any time. Azorius arresters are prying into all

the zonots, looking for evidence of wrongdoing. Thus,

the Simic efforts at preparing for war are in danger, and

the need for those efforts to be brought to fruition could

arise at any time.

Your most obvious allies are those who seek to re

strain the ambition of other guilds and maintain the

balance of power. At various times, that category could

include members of any other guild, particularly the

Selesnya Conclave. Everyone (with the possible excep

tion of the chaotic Rakdos and Gruul) has an occasional

interest in maintaining the status quo, no matter how

revolutionary that notion might seem at other times.

THE StMIC V I EW  ON  OTHER GUILDS

The most insular members of the Simic Combine avoid

interacting with other guilds entirely.  No one but another

Simic scientist could ever fu lly grasp or appreciate the

work of the guild, and too many of the other guilds react

with  fear to what they don't understand.

Azori us. "An  absurd and inelegant construct, forever

trapped in a maze of their own  making. They would

outlaw evolution if they could. And  if any of them truly

seek utopia, the rest are far too busy shuffling papers to

notice. Avoid their attention at all  costs."

Boros. "They style themselves  the agents of'justice.'

But the law is  no better excuse for aggression than

any other.''

Dimir. "We  need not compete.  Let them be, and they will

let us be-but observe them closely."

Golgari. "Less an organization than an infestation. They

are nea rly as adaptable as we  are, and they seem intent

on competition.  More  than any other guild, they  pres

sure us to improve."

Gruul.  "The Gruul  conceive of nature only in terms of

savagery and privation. But their ways are no less a

response to civilization than our own. They will  survive,

barely,  and perhaps one day they will understand."

lzzet. "The lzzet have s pent ten thousand yea rs mi micking

the appearance of research, producing more pyrotech

nics than progress. Surely that is a performance to rival

the Ra kdos."

Orzhov. "They hoard their treasure throughout thei r point

less lives and lengthy afterlives. With such riches, we

could swiftly bring about a future  in which gold is as

irrelevant as death."

Rakdos. "Camouflage, mimicry,  resilience, and versatility.

If the guilds were species, we would count the Rakdos

among the most impressive.  But they aren't, and  that

makes the Rakdos  fa r more erratic-and dangerous.''

Selesnya. "Like us, they seek a synthesis between 'natural'

and 'artificial'  systems. Unlike  us,  they wish  to achieve it

by unconditional surrender. They are adequate partners

in  stable times, but in  the present climate they have little

to offer."

CHAPTER  2  I GUILDS  OF  RAVNICA

97

CHAPTE R  3: THE TENTH  DISTRICT

HE TENTH DISTRICT IS A SPRAWLING PLACE.

To be governed effectively, it is broken into six

precincts, each the size of a small city. This

chapter describes the various features you

can find in those wondrous places.

T H E  Six  PRECINCTS

Each precinct, as well  as its distinct personality, is

explored in its own section later in this chapter. Here

are brief descriptions of each of them to help orient you

before your tour:

P r ecinct One. This is the hub of the wealthy and

powerful, where courtly games and espionage play

out among visitors gawking at the impressive archi

tecture. The precinct is also known as the Guild

pact Precinct.

Precinct Two. Many professionals live here in clean and

orderly neighborhoods, in the shadow of New Prahv,

while mob bosses coerce residents in order to enrich

themselves and influence local politics.

Precin ct Three. In the Greenbelt, nature has en

croached into the urban environment to varying de

grees, and folk here provide bountiful sustenance and

domesticated beasts for  most of the district.

Precinct Four. Constantly in a state of tu rmoil, the

scarred streets of Precinct Four are a proving ground

for soldiers and marauders alike. Visitors here had

best be spoiling for a fight.

Precinct Five. Precinct Five is where the learned folk

of the Tenth District gather to discuss theory or to

put their knowledge to practical use in the precinct's

many schools, libraries, and laboratories.

Precinct Six. In the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Pre

cinct S ix, the working folk eke out a living by toiling at

warehouses, docks, and factories controlled by callous

employers. When night comes, the residents hide in

doors to avoid becoming prey to creatures that stalk

the darkness.

PEOPLE AND  RUMORS

Each precinct's section includes two tables that can help

you, as DM, improvise as characters explore that part

of the city.

When a character wants to talk to a person on the

street, you can roll on the People on the Street table for

the precinct. Unless otherwise noted, these NPCs can

be of any race. They might use the Monster Manual stat

blocks for commoners, guards, or other creatures, at

your discretion.

Whenever characters are gathering information or

talking with contacts in a precinct, you can use the Ru

mors table for  the precinct to add some flavor to their

interactions or to generate adventure hooks.

MAJOR TRADE WAYS

Two major avenues run across the whole Tenth District,

crossing precinct lines.

Tin Street is the longest thoroughfare in the city, a vi

tal center of trade, and a bub of activity day and night. l n

addition to its shopping attractions, Tin Street is also a

popular spot for nightlife, with its many restaurants and

theaters. Much of the street runs through the western

part of Precinct Four, and other parts are claimed by

goblin gangs. The prominent presence of Boros soldiers

along the length of Tin Street helps the popu lace feel

safer, but the threat of rubblebelt raiders and goblin

thieves remains.

The Tr ansguild Promenade makes its way across the

district from the edge of the rubblebelt in Precinct Four

to the southern gates of Precinct One. The Promenade's

northern reach is heavily patrolled by Boros soldiers,

and caravans coming from the north employ heavily

armed escorts to ensure their safe passage through the

ruined areas. Markets and parks line the avenue as it

winds through Precinct One, and parades clog the street

on festive holidays.

BENEATH THE  STREETS

Even though most Ravnicans think the city begins at

ground level and stretches upward, the part of the city

that lies beneath the streets impacts the lives of every

one. Immediately underground are the city works, such

as the sewers and the transit system. Below the complex

network of tunnels and passages that make up the city

works lies the undercity-a realm populated by crea

tures that shun the surface world.

CITY WORKS

The Izzet League is responsible for constructing and

maintaining public works, including sewers and other

pipe systems. Many members of the Golgari Swarm

live or work here, farming fungus and scavenging for

valuable trinkets in  the muck. Orzhov crypts and vaults,

Dimir hideouts, and Simic laboratories can also be

found in the city works.

MI LL ENN I AL  PLATFORM

Anchored by enormous chains at the juncture of Precincts

One, Three, and  Fou r, the Millenn ial  Pla tform is a floating

observation deck that affords the best overhead view of the

Tenth  District. The most exclusive restau rant in  the district

is located here.  Every citizen is given a token that can be

redeemed for one ai rship ride to the platform anytime

during the comi ng yea r, but those who want to dine at the

Millennial  Restau rant might have to make a  reservation

months in  advance.

what transpired, beyond what is necessary. Most as

sume that the place lies somewhere within Nightveil,

but it could lie anywhere in the undercity.

KOROZDA

Also called the Maze of Decay, Korozda is an arched

subterranean cathedral surrounded by fungal hedge

rows and moss-encrusted ruins. In its center is a great

amphitheater where the most important issues are

brought to the Golgari's attention. Penvar, the Hanging

Keep, is a castle fixed  upside down on the ceiling above

the entrance to Korozda. Its soldiers, predominantly the

insectoid kraul, prevent any unauthorized visitors to the

Golgari stronghold.

Rrx MAADI

Known as the Dungeon Palace, this is the guildhall of

the Cult of Rakdos, and the lava-filled lair of the demon

himself. An  immense, crumbling, red stone staircase

called the Demon's Vestibule begins the journey from

the Smelting District down into the depths, treating trav

elers to terrifying images depicted on banners as they

descend. Farther down, the temperature rises and the

passage eventually opens up into the Festival Grounds,

where the bloodiest performances of the Rakdos and

their torturous equipment are on display.

THE UNDERSEA

Rivers, lakes, and oceans run deep below the surface of

Ravnica. Several of them connect to the Simic habitats

known as zonots. They are also used as thoroughfares

by aquatic races and monsters.

SEWERS

A vast, winding sewer network runs under the Tenth

District, lit by continual flame spells. Some of the tun

nels are simply storm sewers, meant to carry rainwater

(and the debris it washes from  the streets) into great cis

terns, where it is purified and sent into the pipes in the

plumbing system that serves Ravnica's nicer neighbor

hoods. Others carry waste and refuse out of those neigh

borhoods, depositing it in different cisterns or dumping

it into the subterranean oceans of the undercity.

PIPE TuNNELS

Around the sewer system, smaller tunnel networks

carry steam, distilled magical energy, and water to

various places throughout the city. These passages are

large enough for a humanoid to walk through but are

often quite uncomfortable, filled with impure air and

stifling heat.

TRANSIT TuNNELS

Magically charged tracks line the floors of tube-like tun

nels that send vehicular constructs to major locations

in the Tenth District and beyond. The tunnels open

into small stations that have staircases leading up to

the su rface.

CRYPTS

Ancient resting places lie in secret chambers below the

surface of Ravnica. Many of them have been magically

warded to prevent unauthorized entry. Some of these

sites are homes for  restless undead or gathering places

for thieves, smugglers, and other criminals.

UNDERCITY

Deep below the Tenth District Jjes a vast, thriving com

munity of folk who have no desire or choice to live under

the sky.  Here, the Dimir. Golgari, Rakdos, and Simic

hold sway in the caverns, causeways, and bodies of wa

ter that grace the darkest depths.

NIGHTVEIL

The sprawling residence of many of the House Dimir

elite, parts of Nightveil overlap the Tenth District in

the undercily. An extensive system of natural caverns

houses high-walled mansions and sunken crypts that

have a grand, sinister motif. Patrolling specters and

other incorporeal undead make it difficult for the

unwelcome to enter.

Du SK MANTLE

The Dimir guildhall is protected by memory wards

(glyphs of warding that store modify memory

spells) to ensure that few know of its existence.

Those who are called there never remember

102

PRECINCT ONE

The grandeur of Precinct One is the heart of Ravnica's

civilization, and visitors gawk at the impressive architec

ture and rub shoulders with the rich and powerful. Im

maculately maintained avenues and manicured gardens

create an impression of order, civility, and high culture.

During the day, the streets are filled with tourists, gov

ernment officials, diplomats, and wealthy merchants and

financiers. At night, most of Precinct One is quiet, with a

few lit carriages drawn by constructs and well-groomed

beasts making their way to exclusive nightclubs and

restaurants.

The people who live in  this precinct are accustomed to

having high-quality goods and spending a lot of leisure

time in social engagements. Neighbors are polite and

affable toward others of their station, but gossip is quite

common and  accepted.

AFFILIATED  GUILDS

All the guilds have interests here. Lawyers, bureaucrats,

and soldiers of the Azorius Senate are found throughout

the precinct The Orzhov Syndicate runs  many of the

clubs and restaurants here, and this is the location of

both its guildhall, Orzhova, and its monumental Vizkopa

Bank. The Selesnya Conclave helps to maintain the

grounds around the plaza and is often involved as dip

lomatic envoys for meetings and negotiations that take

place here.

NEIGHBORHOODS  AND  LANDMARKS

Precinct One has few permanent residents, except for

the very wealthy and some government officials who

live in well-appointed apartments. Buildings here are of

modern construction and well maintained.

T ENTH  DISTRICT PLAZA

A popular place for  meetings, recreation, shopping, and

simply being seen, Tenth District Plaza is a beautiful

oasis of calm and cleanliness. Kept perpetually clean

through magic and constantly patrolled by Azorius ar

resters, the plaza is considered neutral ground for every

guild, gang, and faction  in the city. Drawing a weapon

within the confines of the plaza is met with a swift re

sponse from  the arresters and marks the offender as a

person who can't be trusted.

CHAMBER OF THE GUILDPACT

The long promenade of Plaza Avenue connects the

south end of Tenth District Plaza to the great meeting

hall of the guilds. The Chamber of the Guildpact is

accessible by a grand staircase leading up into a cav

ernous hall where visitors and dignitaries from all over

Ravnica meet. The Living Guildpact has an office here,

but he is seldom present. In  his absence, various func

tionaries who occupy the upper levels of the chamber try

to carry out his work of adjudicating disputes between

guilds and maintaining a semblance of peace.

PLAZA EAST

This neighborhood is home to many government offi

cials, and it offers temporary housing for diplomats.

Stately homes intermingle with more modest apart

ments. Transportation by carr iage between Plaza East

and Tenth District Plaza is readily available, especially

in the morning and evening.

PLAZA WEST

The best nightclubs and restaurants, most of which

are run by the Orzhov, are in this neighborhood. There

are few  permanent residents in Plaza West, aside from

the very rich who reside in  spacious, luxurious, multi

level  homes.

PLAZA SOUTH

Derogatorily known as Downside by the nobles and

elite, this neighborhood is the hub of commerce in

Precinct One and has more permanent residents than

the other neighborhoods . Specialty s hops catering to

tourists a nd the wealthy line the route of the Transguild

Promenade as it runs through the a rea. The residents

here tend to be well-to-do merchants and crafters, mak

ing their living off visitors and a few rich clients.

0RZHOVA

The Orzhov Syndicate's lavish guildhall, also known as

the Church of Deals, is on the western edge of Tenth

District Plaza. The towering spires and stained glass

windows house the grand gatherings of the guild and

also serve as the quarters for its most elite members,

including the ghosts of the Obzedat. Below the cathedral

lies the mausoleum, glittering with opulence and serv

ing as a resting place and a gathering point for secret

meetings fa r from prying eyes and the Guildpact.

VIZKOPA  BANK

The Orzhov-controlled main bank of Ravnica, and also

the place whe re the Orzhov mint their coins, Vizkopa

Bank is a giant, opulent s tructure guarded by gargoyles.

S pirits in  debt to the Orzhov float within its halls and

around the outside of the building.

GOODS AND  SERVICES

There are few genera l s hops in Precinct One, but luxury

items, grooming supplies, a nd fine clothing are available

in  boutiques in the a rea. Even practical items, such as

backpacks and lanterns. are expensive and of the high

est quality, bearing artisan's flourishes. Standard adven

turing gear, including weapons and armor, is difficult

to procure.

Meals and lodging suitable for a wealthy or aristo

cratic lifestyle are readily available in Plaza West, and

comfortable accommodations are the norm for the offi

cials in Plaza East and the merchants in Plaza South.

Poorer people, including anyone who maintains a life

style as expensive as modest. might be seen as uncouth

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who don't main

"I  hear that Nolson has purses and handbags in his

LAW AND  CRIME

The privileged and wealthy people who live in Precinct

One believe that the purpose of law enforcement is to

serve them and keep them protected from the more

unsavory elements of the city. Government officials here

are more practical in their view of the law, recogniz-

ing that Precinct One is the entry point into the Tenth

for many visitors and thus it must keep up the best of

appearances. Azorius law enforcement officers are

ever-present here, with at least one arrester assigned

to patrol each street in Precinct One. It is illegal to

brandish a weapon here, and people who walk around

with unconcealed weapons (even sheathed ones) draw

attention. Minor crimes are reported as soon as they are

witnessed or discovered. Due to enhanced monitoring

by precognitive mages, the typical response time to

any crime is ld6 minutes, and the squad consists of an

Azorius lawmage and three soldiers (see chapter 6 for

these stat blocks).

Very little street-level illicit activity takes place within

Precinct One due to Azorius's constant surveillance.

Private rooms in exclusive establishments are, however,

sometimes used by the Orzhov and other wealthy crim

inals to conduct high-end black market transactions

away from the eyes of law enforcement.

PRECINCT Two

Small houses, modest apartments, and commercial

shops are sprinkled throughout Precinct Two, a place

that law enforcement officers, lawyers, retired soldiers,

and well-off working families call  home. Corner shops

cater to everyday needs, and many establishments are

run by ex-soldiers. Streets are kept tidy, and buildings

are maintained to be serviceable. Under the precinct's

urbane veneer, tension simmers between law officers

and the opportunistic crime families who call this pre

cinct home.

The folk who live in  this precinct believe in perform

ing civic duties, conforming to your role, and maintain

ing strong friendships and fami ly ties. Good neighbors

show respect to one another and enjoy competing

among themselves to achieve greater successes.

AFFILIATED  GUI LD S

New Prahv, the Azorius Senate guildhall, is located

at the eastern end of the precinct, and many resi

dents work there. Some active officers and retired

soldiers from the Boros Legion make their homes in

this precinct. The Orzhov Syndicate has a presence

here through its connections to many of the small

businesses.

NEIGHBORHOOD S  A N D  L A NDM A RKS

Most of Precinct Two is occupied by small commercial

centers and rows of simple houses. It is populous but

not stiflingly so.

NEWPRAHV

The tallest structure in the Tenth District, the austere

New Prahv consists of three towering columns, remind-

ing everyone of the omnipresence of the Azorius Senate.

Each column serves as the headquarters for one of the

three branches of the senate. Inside, spacious chambers

on  the lower floors give way to a host of offices upstairs

where day-to-day assignments arc issued and the strat

egy of maintaining law is continually honed.

WHITESTO N E

Whitestone is an orderly neighborhood on  the northern

side of the precinct, named for its rows of alabaster

stone houses. It was built up by the Azorius to serve as a

housing zone for many who work in  New Prahv. To meet

the demands of construction, many residents of this

section of the city had to be relocated to the much more

densely populated Griffin Heights.

GRIFFIN  HEIGHTS

Two-story houses are nestled in  the rolling hills of this

neighborhood in the southern section of the precinct.

Griffin Heights is rife with corruption, and less scru

pulous government officials exchange information and

money with the Orzhov in business establishments here.

The locals are fiercely loyal  to the Orzhov knights who

watch over them, dutifully paying their protection fees.

AUGU STIN STATION

The main airship station for  the Tenth District, Au

gustin Station is located at the western end of Griffin

Heights. Travelers from a ll over Ravnica are carried in

various forms of air travel: from gondolas hung from

giant balloons to compartments strapped to the backs

of enormous floating beasts bred by the Simic Combine.

Augustin Station has twenty platforms, with flights ar

riving and leaving at all hours. The most popular ftight

is to the Millennial Platform, a journey that costs 5 sp

per passenger. Other flights carry passengers to smaller

STATUE OF AG RUS  Kos

A ten-foot-tall granite statue of a Boros Legion soldier

stands in a small park in Whitestone, surrounded by

weather worn tables. During the Decamillennial Cele

bration seventy-six years ago, Agrus Kos became a hero

by foiling various schemes to undermine the Guildpact.

His statue has become a social gathering point for war

veterans, mob contacts, and spies who tal k as they play

var ious strategy games.

Goons A N D  SERV ICES

Most any sort of merchandise can be acquired from

some shop in Precinct Two. For mer soldiers and

ex-adventu rers r un many of the businesses here, and

weapons and armor are commonly available i n Gr i ffi n

Heights. Meals and lodging are often of modest or com

fortable quality i n this precinct, which has lots of board

i ng houses instead of inns. Corner tavern s are frequent

and serve as the centers of neighborhood society.

The people who live in Precinct Two aren't fond of

people who don't fit in with them, and that includes

those of both higher and lower means. People who don't

maintain at least a modest lifestyle are viewed as lazy

and undesirable, and those who aspire to a wealthy or

aristocratic lifestyle are seen as ar rogant snobs. At the

DM's discretion, adventurers in either category could

have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interact

i ng with residents of Precinct Two.

LAW A N D  CRIME

Many citizens in Precinct Two work for  the Azorius, but

others feel stifled by the guild's i ntr usive presence under

the shadow of New Prahv. Most residents respect or der,

but some rely more on  Orzhov protection than on Azo

rius law. Almost everyone here knows someone who is

trained  in the use of weapons. T he typical response to a

repor ted cri me is about 2d6 mi nutes, and the squad con

sists of two Azorius soldier s (see chapter 6 for the stat

block) or 1 d6 Orzhov thugs (from the Monster Manual).

The organized cri me elements of the neighborhoods

are locked in a power struggle agai nst law enforcement

officials. This conflict rarely manifests i n open violence,

but often antagonists "disappear" or "have an accident."

Overt violent crimes someti mes involve ex-soldiers who

have been psychologically scarred by past battles.

PRECINCT THREE

Ample parks, busy stables, and large gardens combine

to create a vibrant environment in Precinct Three. Nat

ural and urban life intermingle throughout the precinct,

and the people who reside here view it as a respite from

most other places in the Tenth District. Folk here tend

to live simply, and generations of families have dwelt in

the same s tructures for  hundreds of years. During the

day, the gardens, s mall pastures, and stables are tended

by young and old. Evenings are given over to commu

nal gatherings, sometimes featuring performances by

trained beasts or storytelling.

The people of Precinct Three are comfortable with liv

ing around nature. They have no problems with pets or

beastly companions sharing their space as well as resid

ing in  multifamily structures. Good neighbors help tend

to plants, animals, and children whenever necessary.

A F FI LI ATE D  GU I LD S

The Selesnya Conclave's influence on this area is

strong, and its guildha ll, the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi,

stands at the northern edge of the precinct. Members of

the Gruul Clans sometimes venture into the northern

part of the precinct, rarely with peaceful intentions.

N EI GHBORHOOD S AN D  L ANDM A RKS

Precinct Three is  made up of old stone structures

partially reclaimed by nature, standing alongside

well-preserved wooden buildings that have been en

hanced by Selesnya magic.

VITU - GHAZI

The Selesnya guildhall, a towering tree that also serves

as a cathedral to Mat'Selesnya, is the epicenter of S e

lesnya culture and law.  Members of the conclave from

across Ravn ica make pilgrimages to Vitu-Ghazi in

hopes of finding a spiritua l connection with the heart of

the guild. All  who come without ill  intent in their heart

are welcome to visit the public a reas of the tree.

THE CANOPY

The northern neighborhood of the precinct is covered in

tall trees, all  of which are overshadowed by Vitu-Ghazi.

To accommodate a growing population, buildings are

situated around the trees and on the larger branches,

making use of a network of ladders and rope walkways.

THE GREAT CONCOURSE

A network of elevated roadways links many of the most

important Selesnya communities near Vitu-Ghazi. The

polished white stone of the roadways gleams in the sun,

and the pathways are topped with lush trees, grasses,

and flowers. On high  holy days, its central hub, called

the Great Concourse, serves as a gathering place for

throngs of Selesnya devotees. On most other days,

the Concourse is a teeming marketplace where goods

transported across the city on the great roadways are

bought and sold.

CONCORDANCE

Once known as the Old City, the eastern neighborhood

of Concordance is the oldest section of the precinct.

"We shou ld  go find  that loxodon priest and see if

she's still having visions.  I'll  bet we can get her

Many buildings in this area were once Orzhov struc

tures, but they have been reclaimed by moss, shrubs,

and other growth that make them blend in with the

homes, parks, and the Selesnya vernadi that fill  the rest

of the neighborhood. The Great Concourse runs over

head through most of the neighborhood.

BEAST H AVEN

The western neighborhood has many small pastures

and stables, some of which a re on open, multilevel

structures. The area is filled with the s ights, sounds,

and smells of beasts of many sorts. Here, beasts are

trained for labor and sold to customers from  across

the city.  Every so often, a beast escapes captivity and

rampages through the neighborhood, but the tough

residents are usually able to bring any disruption under

control quickly.

GOODS AND  SERVICES

The bounty of nature is plentiful in Precinct Three,

which serves as the main source of food  for the Tenth

District. The finest steeds and livestock are raised here,

as well as many war beasts (although they're often

trained in Precinct Four). Unlike in  most other pre

cincts, barter is an acceptable form of transaction here,

and some vendors outright reject payment in  coin of any

kind. Manufactured goods are relatively hard to find, ex

cept in large markets such as the Great Concourse.

Meals and lodging are widely varied, from squalid to

comfortable, depending on the neighborhood. In gen

eral, the neighborhoods in Concordance tend toward

the more expensive end of that scale, and those in

Beast Haven more toward the other end. The residents

of P recinct Three don't put much stock in personal ap

pearance, and they're slow to pass judgment on anyone

based on visible standards of wealth. The truly wretched

sometimes evoke pity and sometimes scorn. and the

very wealthy are generally disliked.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain a

wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle could  have disadvantage

on  Charisma checks when interacting with residents of

Precinct Three.

LAW A N D  CRIME

Most of Precinct Three is policed by its residents, occa

sionally supplemented by Boros troops when a serious

th reat rears  its head. Each block elects a watch captain,

who receives weapon training from Selesnya soldiers.

The captain can call on additional citizens for support in

case of a crisis. The typical response to a reported crime

takes about ld8 minutes, and the squad consists of a

watch captain (a s cout) with two gu ards or two wolves.

In Concordance, it's either a knight or a Selesnya dru id

with a topiary guardian (awakened tree). See the Mon

ster Manual for these creatures' stat blocks.

Crime usua lly takes one of two forms in Precinct

Three. Some residents engage in outright banditry, but

they typically target visitors or go outside the precinct

to do their dirty work. More common are incidents of

livestock theft, which sometimes lead to outbreaks of vi

olence between neighbors, particularly in  Beast Haven.

PRECINCT FOUR

Few days or nights pass quietly in Precinct Four. The

frequent din of battle as Boros soldiers guard against

Gruul marauders, the strange sounds of volatile magic

emanating from Izzet experiments, a nd the occasional

explos ive flare-ups of goblin gang wa rs keep the precinct

a dynamic and dangerous place. Its buildings include

rams hackle tenements damaged by conflict, impregna

ble fortresses and laboratories, a nd  bustling markets

filled with merchants ready to defend themselves and

their wares.

The people of Precinct Four are a lways ready for

a fight.  Being able to defend oneself a nd adapting to

change are the most important qualities in this precinct.

Good neighbors are your battle mates when you're fight

ing for your home or your life.

AFFILIATED  GUILD S

The Boros Legion's guildhall fortress, Sunhome, is lo

cated here, and that guild is the heart of the precinct's

defense against the savage forces that come from  the

northern rubblebelt. The Izzet League often likes to

test its latest experiments in this precinct. Its guildhall,

Nivix, !Owers over the south end. The Gruul Clans fre

quently raid into the rest of the precinct from the rubble

belt in the north. The Cult of Rakdos delights in sowing

mayhem here, stoking the fires of conflict and gathering

ins piration for future performances.

NE IGHBORHOOD S  AN D  L AN DMARKS

Precinct Four is home to a wide range of folk. most of

whom are used to fighting for a living. Transients. sol

diers. goblin gang members, and hardy merchants call

this precinct home.

SUN HOME

The seat of the Boros Legion's power, the guildhall

known as Sunhome is an imposing structure that

serves as a fortress, barracks, and spiritual center. It

is widely believed to be impregnable and serves as a

reminder to attackers from  the north of the stre ngth of

Boros resolve.

One of the tallest towers in  Ravnica. this impressive

structure crackles with the wild  power of the Izzet and

RED W ASTES

The rubblebelt to the north is a wasteland filled with

ruins. gutted buildings, and debris-ridden streets. Aside

from  the Gruul Clans, the only citizens who live in the

neighborhood are the ones too stubborn to move away.

The Gruul share the space with ferocious beasts, ele

mentals, and other monsters.

THE BULWARK

The neighborhood between Sunhome and Nivix is filled

with reinforced structures that serve as low-rent apart

ments and shops. Those who live in  the BuJwark are

mainly workers or professionals who see opportunity in

supporting the Boros garrison.

SKARRG

The Gruul Clans periodically converge on the gutted,

cratered remains of a huge palace in the Red Wastes

where a great bonfire perpetually burns. Skarrg is the

closest thing the Gruul have to a guildhall-a place

where their clans can come together, roast giant boars,

boast of their exploits, and form something akin to ca

maraderie before they go their separate, violent ways.

It's not neutral ground, though-old grudges frequently

boil over into combat. Outsiders are never welcome.

Goons AND  SERVICES

Precinct Four has a wide variation in available goods,

depending on  the neighborhood. There is little or no

commerce in the Red Wastes, except for what can be

bartered with Gruul clansfolk or scavenged. The Bul

wark carries many basic goods and services, with weap

ons and armor plentiful due to the constant threat of

conflict and the nearby foundries in District Six. On Tin

Street, almost anything is available for a bit of searching

and the right price.

The precinct offers a wide range of food  and lodging,

appropriate for lifestyles from squalid  to wealthy. The

more affluent folk of the precinct are careful not to Haunt

their wealth, lest they make themselves targets for raid

ers from the Red Wastes.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain

either a squalid or aristocratic lifestyle could have dis

advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with

residents of Precinct Four.

LAW AND  CRIME

Much of Precinct Four is a war zone, and mundane

methods of law enforcement a ren't always effective

in  such an environment. No one takes the constant

patrolling of the Boros Legion as a guarantee of their

safety, and almost all  folk  know how to fight to some

degree. Typical threats include giant monsters, unstable

elementals, and Gruul raiding parties, and a curfew

system is often instituted when a neighborhood is beset

by one of these dangers. The only area that is usually

safe from  external threats is Tin Street. Petty crimes

aren't given  much attention, since the soldiers are pri

marily concerned with curbing violence and mayhem.

The typical response to a reported crime or a dangerous

threat is ld8 minutes, and the squad consists of a Boros

Legion knight (from the Monster Manual) leading 4d4

s oldiers (see chapter 6  for the stat block).

The Red Wastes is a lawless region mostly beyond the

reach of Boros patrols and Azorius laws. In other parts

of the precinct, goblin gangs shake down locals when

ever possible and s kirmish against each other over turf.

The Shattergang Brothers are a notorious goblin gang

that haunts Tin Street in this precinct, dealing in weap

ons and explosives.

P RECI NCT FIVE

As the home of prestigious universities, ancient librar

ies, and hidden laboratories, Precinct Five is the hub of

information and learning in the Tenth District. People

of all ages flock  to this precinct to spend time learning,

whether by poring over texts and scrolls or finding a

mentor who will guide a student. It's also the place to

find  information brokers, who sell specialized or secret

knowledge available nowhere else. Multilevel buildings

set next to each other with little regard for planning

give way to an occasional square or open campus where

socially minded residents congregate during daytime

hours. At night, many continue their studies while oth

ers tinker with their latest creations or intellectual en

deavors. Taverns and pubs tend to be more urbane than

in other parts of the district and often feature poetry

readings, storytelling, and musical performances.

People who live in Precinct Five have a zeal for learn

ing and tend to be inquisitive. Getting into a heated

debate or touting a recent s uccess to your neighbors is

part of showing your worth. Good neighbors keep their

projects and research hidden until a result can be dis

played; it is considered uncouth to allow others to view a

work in  progress.

..

AFFILIATED  GUILDS

Zonot Seven, the home of the Simic Combine's guild

hall, is located on the western edge of the precinct.

The lzzet League maintains a network of laborato

ries and workshops close to Nivix (in Precinct Four).

House Dimir agents are seen and unseen all around

the district, and they secretly run the Ismeri Library.

Some members of the Azorius Senate who prefer to

study disciplines aside from the law make their homes

he re as well.

NEIGHBORHOODS AND  LANDMARKS

Life for residents in  Precinct Five is spent mostly in

doors, or in  the case of the Simic, underwater. The pre

cinct's occupants- including significant populations of

students, instructors, researchers, scribes, and univer

s ity staff- are crowded into dormitories and apartments

squeezed in among laboratories, libraries, and magical

machinery.

ZONOT SEVEN

The Simic Combine's watery habitat is made up of huge

sinkholes filled with the overflow from a subterranean

ocean. Zonot Seven is the only zonoc within Ravnica

City proper, and it contains Zameck, the Simic guildhall.

ln contrast to the rest of the precinct, the zonot is a bus

tling place, with activity at all hours. A huge chamber

just below the street surface serves as a gathering place

for all the Simic s peakers, as well as a place where

visitors can meet with Prime Speaker Zegana or other

Simic emissa ries. A Simic researcher might invite a

land-dwelling colleague to visit the habitat, but such an

occurrence isn't common. Canals lead from here farther

into the preci nct and to Precinct Six.

THE BLISTERCOILS

A series of gigantic waterwheels, built and operated by

the lzzet League, turns just outside Zonot Seven in the

north end of the precinct. The system generates magical

energy to power public works, Simic laboratories, and,

of course, lzzet workshops. Few outside the lzzet realize

that the amount of e nergy generated in the Blistercoils

far exceeds what is actually used. with the excess stored

in underground batteries that could explode if they be

came overloaded.

Blistercoils is also the name of the neighborhood near

the waterwheels, which largely consists of workshops

and private laboratories.

HIGHTOWER

The weste rn end of the precinct is packed with educa

tional institutions of all sorts, from  grand universities

that cover a broad span of disciplines to specialized

schools that instruct students in subjects ranging from

theoretical metaphysics to fine arts. The neighborhood

takes its name from  the fact that most of these schools

boast at least one ta ll  s pire among their structures.

Stude nts and staff live both on and off the various cam

puses, and several cozy pubs and small lecture halls are

busy from afternoons through late in the night.

PRISM  UNIVERSITY

A crystal-paned center of learning that concentrates on

magical theory and application, Prism University draws

potential wizards and other would-be mages who want

to learn about all forms of magic, in contrast to the s pe

cialized and practical applications of magic espoused by

the guilds. Even  though the school maintains a formal

state of neutrality, ifs an open secret that many guilds

have infiltrated the university and planted agents to woo

prospective members. Partly as a result of this influ

ence, many grad uates of the university do go on to join

a guild, finding a way to apply their broad experience

to s upport the narrower focus of the guild. (A  player

character spellcaster might well  be a graduate of the

university, which could explain the character 's ability

to use magic that wouldn't normally be taught within

their guild.)

lSMERI  LIBRARY

One of the greatest libraries on all Ravnica, the Ismeri

Library is open to all citizens at all hours. Hundreds of

thousands of books covering every conceivable subject

are found  here. The place is also one of the centers of

Dimir communication. Secret messages are hidden

within its books by a variety of methods both magi-

cal and mundane. Dimir agents might have to gather

message fragments hidden within several different

docume nts, for example, to find  their next assignments

or targets . Intricate codes and magical wards protect

other secrets .

Go ons AN D  SERV I CE S

Specialty items that a re commonly used by scribes,

researchers, and inventors can be found in many small

shops in the precinct, usually run by a tinker or aca

demic. Precinct Five also has the best apothecaries, al

chemists, and magic-mongers in the Tenth District. On

the other hand, mundane adventuring gear, weapons,

and armor are harder to find.

Information is an especially valuable commodity in

Precinct Five.  In addition to holding booksellers, the

precinct is home to a variety of people who make a living

(or at least a s izable s ide income) selling information, in

cluding private investigators, rumormongers, and spies.

Meals and lodging of modest to wealthy quality are

available here. Older and more experienced people

high-ranking Simic researchers or established schol

ars- tend to maintain lifestyles toward the more expen

sive end of that scale.

The poor are pitied and the most affluent are envied,

so adventurers who maintain an aristocratic, poor,

squalid, or wretched lifestyle, at the DM's discretion,

cou ld have disadvantage on Charisma checks when in

teracting with residents of Precinct Five.

LAW AND  CRIME

Much of the crime in Precinct Five is of a sort that is

hard to detect: blackmail. espionage, identity theft (of

the literal kind, perpetrated by shapechangers), and the

like. Most of the precinct's residents spend their time

absorbed in study, unaware that such activities might be

happening under their noses. Only rarely does violence

break out, and Azorius arreste rs try hard to keep the

incident quiet and maintain public calm.

The typical response to a reported crime here is ldl2

minutes, and the force consists of two Azorius arresters

(use the veteran stat block in  the Monster Manual).

PRECINCT SIX

Large warehouses, major thoroughfares, and nonde

script worker tenements make the utilitarian Precinct

Six a hub of activity for shipping, storage, and other mer

cantile concerns in the Tenth  District. Wide cobblestone

streets allow for the passage of beasts and constructs

that transport raw goods from  points beyond the Tenth

and for the sh ipping of manufactured materials back to

those locations. The demands of commerce keep the

area constantly active, and the inconspicuous nature

of the warehouses makes them popular as rendezvous

points for all sorts of transactions, legal and illicit. At

night, lurking undead and the horrors of the undercity,

coming up from Deadbridge Chasm, keep wary citizens

indoors, while a few  people who deal in sinister magic

seek the monsters out for nefarious purposes.

People who live in this working-class precinct are of

ten  practical-minded and thus tolerant of some degree of

illicit activity. Being a good neighbor means keeping to

yourself, unless you live in the Smelting Quarter, where

the atmosphere is much more raucous.

AFF I LIATED  GUILDS

The Orzhov Syndicate owns many of the warehouses in

the precinct and controls much of the commerce around

Tin Street. Members of the Golgari Swarm often crawl

around the edges of Deadbridge Chasm, which is an

opening to their sprawling subterranean network. The

Boros Legion rents many of the warehouses to store

manufactured goods from  the Smelting Quarter, and

Kamen Fortress houses a garrison to protect Boros

interests. The Cult of Rakdos operates a number of

pain clubs throughout the precinct, especially around

Tin Street, and Rakdos street performances are more

common in  Precinct Six than anywhere else in the

Tenth District.

NEI G HBORH OOD S  AND  LAN DMA RKS

Precinct Six is home to many working-class folk, most

packed into modest apartments near their place of work.

It's also home to more than its share of monsters, most

of which are active at night.

SMELTING QUARTER

The heart of the manufacturing industry in the Tenth

District is at the north end of the precinct. The Smelting

Quarter is smoky. hot, and filled with activity day and

night. Goblins often make their homes near the factories

on Foundry Street, preferring the constant activity to

sleepier neighborhoods. Standing south and east of the

quarter, Kamen Fortress is a  Boros garrison dedicated

to keeping watch on Rakdos activity. Clashes between

the Boros Legion, the goblins. and the Cult of Rakdos

are common throughout this part of the precinct.

GORE HOUSE

A Rakdos club called the Gore House, run by a viashino

(lizard folk)  named Nyoser, occupies a defunct factory in

the south end of the Smelting Quarter- and a lso houses

the main entrance to the Demon's Vestibule, the stair

way down to  Rix Maadi.

IL')

PRECINCT Six

MEDORI  PARK

The western part of the precinct, Medori Park, is named

after an Orzhov pontiff who converted a city park into

a warehouse lot many years ago. This neighborhood is

particularly rife with undead at night, both corporeal

and incorporeal. Some serve dark masters and often

guard valuables, while others pursue their own evil

urges. The Orzhov Syndicate owns many large ware

houses here, and the Boros Legion maintains facilities

to store a variety of equipment used by their soldiers,

including valuable weapons and armor. The most im

portant facilities are heavily guarded-often by angels,

whether Boros or Orzhov.

D EADBRIDGE  CHASM

A gaping opening in  the ground dominates the precinct

and is lined with mossy stairs and fungal blooms. Dead

bridge Chasm serves as an entrance to the Golgari's

undercity realm and their guildhall, Korozda. The area

smells of decomposition, an odor that grows particularly

intense on hot days. Many kraul make their homes in

the walls that line the cavernous descent, and Devkarin

elves come up to the surface through this passage to

trade on Tin Street.

WAYPORT

The neighborhood of Wayport rises like a pillar from the

midst of Deadbridge Chasm, and a number of bridges,

large and small, connect it to the surrounding city of

multiple vertical levels. Many goods traded with other

districts are funneled along Tin Street, often pausing

in Wayport's warehouses along the way. But only the

wealthiest merchants can afford storage space here.

B ENZER'S B RIDGE

This wide bridge is a main thoroughfare for cargo

traveling to and from districts beyond the Tenth. A

small market is located here, complete with shops and

restaurants, all of which close after dark. Secret pain

clubs, hidden below the market in dark rooms inside the

bridge itself, come alive after sunset.

Goons AND  S ERVICES

Trade goods can easily be acquired in Precinct S ix,

along with manufactured items such as artisan's tools.

Weapons, armor, and mounts are rarely on sale here.

Fences deal in stolen and otherwise illicit goods. On

Tin Street, which runs along the eastern side of the pre

cinct, most anything can be had for the right price.

Meals and lodging of poor to modest quality meet

the needs of the laborers, dock hands, and street per

formers of Precinct Six for a price they can afford. The

wealthy are viewed as outsiders, and the truly impover

ished are generally shunned.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain a

lifestyle less expensive than poor o r more expensive

than modest could have disadvantage on Charisma

checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Six.

LAW AND  CRIME

The folk of Precinct Six are pragmatic, not overly con

cerned with the welfare of others, and thus often willing

to disregard minor crimes. Arresters from the Azorius

Senate can often be found on patrol in and around the

warehouses. Soldiers from  the Boros Legion are com

mon near the warehouses and in the Smelting Quarter.

The typical response time to a reported crime in  these

areas is 2d 10 minutes, and the squad consists of two Bo

ros soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block). At night or

in the Smelting Quarter, a response to an attack might

instead consist of ld4 Boros soldiers  led  by a sergeant

(use the knight stat block in the Monster Manual).

Precinct Six is a hotbed for  illicit activity, particularly

organized crime. Goblin gangs haunt the Smelting

Quarter, most notably a large gang that claims Foundry

Street, led by a goblin named Krenko. Vicious turf wars

sometimes erupt in that area. Violent crimes occur with

regularity all over the precinct, with most of the bodies

ending up in Deadbridge Chasm. Night-lurking mon

sters are a particular problem in the precinct as well,

often attacking and disappearing before help can arrive.

CHAPTER 4:  CREATING ADVENTURES

HIS CHAPTER PROVIDES A TOOLBOX TO HELP

the Dungeon Master create adventures featur

ing the guilds of Ravnica. The tensions among

the guilds, a constant current of animosity,

provide a solid foundation for building adventures.

"Krenko's Way," a sample adventure at the end of this

chapter, can be used to launch a Ravnica campaign.

The tables and advice in this chapter expand  on  the

material in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Monsters and nonplayer characters mentioned on the

tables can be found either in the Monster Manual or in

chapter 6 of this book. When a creature's name appears

in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the crea

ture's stat block in the Monster Manual. If the stat block

appears elsewhere, the text tells you so.

GUI LD - B ASED ADVEN TURES

Each guild gets a section in this chapter to help you craft

adventures inspired by that guild. In a guild's section,

four basic seeds for creating adventures are provided:

guild locations, guild villains, character objectives, and

adventure hooks.

GUILD  LO CAT IONS

Each guild's entry in this chapter includes a map of an

iconic location associated with the guild. Any of these

sites can serve as the location for an adventure.

T he description of each guild location includes a table

that lists possible goals for an adventure based there.

You can choose an adventure goal, or roll one randomly,

from the table in the description of the site you've cho

sen. If none of those goals inspires you, choose a goal

or roll one randomly from the Guild Location Goals

table instead.

suggestions for how you might lead your players from

one adventure location to another.

GU I LD  V I LLA I N S

Player characters might belong to any guild, and their

adversaries might as well. The guild entries in this chap

ter offer examples of the kinds of villains and villainous

schemes that might be connected to each guild.

Certain kinds of goals and schemes are common to

villains in every guild. Some generic villainous schemes

appear on the Guild Villains table. You can also use the

Villain's Scheme and Villain's Methods tables in chapter

4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to flesh out a villain's

activities, and a guild's section in this chapter points to

specific parts of those tables that characterize how vil

lains from that guild enact their plans.

CHAPTER  4  I CRl.ArTNG  ADVENTURES

CHARACTER O BJECTIVES --------

The impetus for adventuring might come from within

the player characters' own guilds, rather than from ex

ternal guilds . Each guild e ntry in this chapter provides

some examples of missions that the guild might send

its members on. These missions can also serve as side

quests that a character is asked to fulfill  while engaged

in a larger task that involves the whole party.

A DV ENTUR E  H OOKS

Each guild section includes a table of adventure hooks

events that might drive adventures but don't necessarily

involve specific locations or villains. They offer a general

description of circumstances that can lead to adventure.

CHOOSING A  GUILD

Here a re the main ways to approach the choice of guild

for your adventure:

Choose a guild that has an aesthetic or a story that ex

cites you and that will lead to the sort of villain or type

of adventure you want to build. The following section,

"Adventure Types,'' shows how different guilds are

natural fits for certain types of adventure.

Pick a guild that fits your players' tastes. The introduc

tion to the Dungeon Master's Guide offers some guid

ance for crafting adventures to please different kinds

of players. The guild or guilds your players choose will

also help you  understand your players' desires. It's a

QUICK  BUILD

To  make a simple location-based adventu re quickly, follow

these steps:

1. Choose a guild (or use the Guilds table in chapter l

if you  want to choose randomly). The adventure will

take place in that guild's location, as described in

th is chapter.

2.  Determine the adventure goal us ing the table associated

with  that location.

3. Use creatures associated with the guild (shown on the

tables in  chapter 6)  to populate the location.

Optionally,  you can use the Location Connections ta

ble in  this chapter to link the location you're using to a

second location. You  can either select a location based

on the result of that table or determine the second loca

tion randomly.

12 j

CH/\rTEI< .i I  CREATING  ADVENTIJRES

safe bet that a player who creates a Rakdos character

is looking for mayhem and combat, while a Dimir

player is more interested in intrigue and sabotage.

Armed with that understanding, you can better craft

an adventure experience aimed at your players.

Go with a guild that easily provides a villain to face. A

few guilds make very straightforward villains: Gruul,

Rakdos, Dimir, and Golgari.

Let a die decide the guild, using the Random Guilds

table in  this book's introduction.

The guild you choose will provide a potential location,

villain, mission, or adventure hook, as well as point you

toward the type of adventure you're going to run.

ADVENT URE TYPES

Certain guilds lend themselves to particular types of

adventures better than others, as shown below. If you're

interested in running an intrigue adventure, where the

heroes must unravel twisted plots within plots, you'll

want to choose a different guild from what you would se

lect if you want to run a dungeon delve that will  take the

adventurers into the labyrinthine undercity.

DUNGEON DELVE

Beneath the urban environment ofRavnica is an entirely

different city- the dark, dank undercity, where vermin

and horrors lurk and the Golgari Swarm maintains

its elegant courts. Indeed, thousands of years of devel

opment have buried countless layers of construction

beneath the current surface streets, making the under

city much larger than the surface city, though much of

it is inaccessible. But if a sinkhole or other catastrophe

opens long-sealed vaults and exposes them to the sur

face again, who knows what horrors might be revealed?

PLOTS AND INTRIGUE

Every guild has its internal politics, making it easy for

characters to get caught up in intrigue- particularly

within their own guilds. Certain guilds are more likely

to involve themselves in the politics of other guilds,

which makes them particularly good villains for in

trigue-based adventures.

DISASTER

When a cyclonic rift sweeps through the streets, an

uncontrolled wurm crashes through buildings, or a

laboratory experiment goes haywire, heroes might be

called upon to s helter the innocent. stop the disaster at

Of course, the adventurers need not be virtuous or

law-abiding themselves: the Orzhov are more apt to send

their own enforcers after thieves than they are to turn to

the forces of law for assistance.

GUILD  VERSUS  GUILD

Interguild conA ict is such a fundamental aspect of life

on Ravnica that the player characters' guild member

s hip is a n easy starting point for choosing an adventu re

vi llai n. If you choose a villain from a gu ild that's already

in conflict with one or more guilds that the characters

belong to, it's easy to craft villainous goals that are at

odds with the characters' goals.

If a ll  the player characters  belong to a s ingle guild,

choosing almost any other guild will provide oppor tu

nities for conflict. The natural state of the relationship

between any two guilds is tension at best, and open

warfare at wors t. All  it takes is a villain willing to upset

the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their

own motivations should easily bring them into conflict

with the villain. A party's own guild could even provide

a villain, given  the amount of scheming and intrigue that

exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue,

members of the same guild at odds with one another, or

even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in con

flict with their own guild.

If the characters come from different guilds, a com

mon enemy provides a good reason for  them to work

together. Any guild that isn't represented by one of the

characters is a fine choice for a villain.

INVOLVING T HE

CHARACTERS

Once you've chosen an adventure seed-a villain, a

mission, or a general hook- you need to figure out what

gets the player characters involved  in the adventure. T he

a nswer could be as s imple as a guildmaster or other

authority send ing them on a mission, but it's generally

good to hook the characters in personally. What motiva

tion do they have to thwart the villain?

T he best answers to this question stem either from

the advent urers' personalities, ideals, a nd histories, or

from their gui ld affiliations. The characters might have

a common reason to fight the villain (especially if they

all belong to the same guild or have been adventuring

together for a while), or they might all oppose the villain

for different reasons.

For example, say your villain is a group of Gruul an

archs raiding in a densely populated area. A Boros char

acter might be assigned to protect innocent bystanders,

or might just happen to be in the area and leap to the

defense of the innocents. An  lzzet character might be

trying to make sure that an Iziet laboratory in the area

isn't damaged or its secrets looted. A Dimir spy might

leap at the opportunity to steal some lzzet secrets when

the laboratory comes under attack.

The Cross Purposes table can help you involve the

characters in an adventure by suggesting ways that a

villain's activities might directly conflict with the player

characters' goals or interests.

R ANDO M  NO N PLAYE R C HARACTERS

Any time you need an  NPC  for an adventure-for example,

if the player characters are sent on a  mission to rescue a

member of their guild-you can use the contacts tables in

chapter 2 to help flesh out the NPC.  If you don't know the

NPC's guild affiliation, you  can rol l on the Random Guilds

table in  this book's  introd uction to determine the guild.

Then you can choose an appropriate stat block in  chapter

6 to represent the NPC's game statistics.

ALLIES AND  RIVALS

A friendly contact can act as a patron, sending a char

acter on a mission or a side quest either as a formal

assignment or as a favor.  Friendly contacts also have

a knack for getting into perilous situations from which

they need to be rescued, which can sometimes force

characters into making difficult choices between saving

friendly nonplayer characters and capturing villainous

ones. In extraordinary circumstances, a friend ly contact

might even join the adventuring party for a short time.

Contacts who have a more antagonistic relationship

with a character can hinder the adventuring party's

efforts in a variety of ways. They might appear at incon

venient times to delay the party, or catch the group in

the midst of some illegal activity. They might leak infor

mation to the adventure's villain, subtly aid the villain's

efforts, or even become villains themselves.

Contacts can complicate things even more when they

interact with multiple player characters or with each

other. Consider what might happen when two people

who are friendly contacts for two different characters

are bitter enemies of each other, or when a single NPC

is a good friend of one character and a rival of another.

The characters might have to navigate those complex

relationships in order to achieve their goals.

COMPLICATIONS

An adventure that pits player characters against a single

guild is relatively straightforward, but adding another

guild can make an adventure even more interesting.

The involvement of a second guild can be as simple as

the appearance of a bumbling innocent who needs the

characters' protection, or as complex as a second villain

who pursues an entirely separate scheme. The Second

ary Guild Role table presents a range of options.

SECONDARY  GUI LD  ROLE

Secondary Guild  Role

A rival pursues the same goal as the adventurers,

but is doing it "wrong."

One or more members of another guild are caught

between the vil lain and the adventurers.

A g roup of NPC adventurers from  another guild

Someone is manipulating the villain for their own

purposes.

A known rival or enemy meddles in the adventure,

hoping the adventurers will  fail.

Adventures involving the Azorius Senate naturally re

find  themselves on the wrong side of the law might

be forced to confront well-meaning Azorius arresters

as enemies, even if the characters are innocent of any

wrongdoing. Lawful characters might also assist the

Azorius in  maintaining law and order on the mean

streets of Ravnica.

A RRESTER S TATIO N

Map 4.1  depicts an arrester station, which serves as the

ARRESTER STATION ADVENTURES

Characters might be drawn to the arrester station

because of prisoners held there, information or items

stored there, or crimes occurring there. The Arrester

Station Adventures table presents some possibilities.

ARRESTER  STATI O N  ADVE NTURES

Direct access to the prison area from outside the

lead up from the plaza. The stairs end at a balcony that

is guarded at all times by archers behind arrow slits.

A narrow hall leads through several locked doors to

the cells- the general population on one side, where

prisoners are a llowed to mingle to some extent, and a

high-security area on the other side, featuring smaller

cells keeping prisoners in complete isolation.

The opposite end of the station is a headquarters for a

local detachment of arresters. The main level includes

two meeting rooms, an office for the commander, and

a break room. The upper level provides working space

where arresters can interview suspects and complete

paperwork, as well as space for storing evidence. The

lower level includes a morgue and a large area where

the whole local force can be assembled.

ARRESTER  STATION MAP

Two separate buildings make up this station, separated

Wide, impressive stairs lead to the main courthouse

entrance, which opens into a large waiting room. All the

doors leading out of the waiting room a re kept locked,

so they can be opened only from the other side. To ei

ther side of the waiting room are private meeting rooms,

which lead back to an extensive area of offices for the

large staff that keeps the place running.

The twin courtrooms include bench seats for specta

tors and witnesses. The judges preside from platforms

that hover in midair, with shallow pools of water below.

The accused are seated on  balconies that overlook the

same pools. Doors at the back of these balconies lead to

a central hallway that ends at a staircase that ascends to

the prison level.

AZORIUS AS  CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

The Azorius become villains when they abuse the power

of the law. A local magistrate might imprison innocent

people, or the senate might pass oppressive legislation,

thereby drawing the ire of the Boros and the Selesnya,

who care about the folk who get caught in the cross

hairs. Arresters might decide to crack down on unsafe

Izzet laboratory practices, illegal Rakdos performances,

or the Gruul presence in the city. Self-righteous prison

wardens or precinct captains might abuse their au

thority in the name of the law, and corrupt bureaucrats

might use their positions to garner favors for themselves

and their relatives.

Low-level characters might suffer harassment at

the hands of overzealous arresters. As the campaign

progresses, they might be able to identify a particular

imperator who is driving this heightened aggression,

who then becomes something of a nemesis for them. As

they gain experience. this imperator continues to be a

thorn in  their side and advances through the ranks of

the senate as well, becoming a minister and eventually

the arbiter who dictates law enforcement policy for the

entire guild. Along the way, this villain uses every avail

able means to hinder the characters, probably veering

into covert illegal activities (evil  means for a good end).

The climax of the campaign might involve a violent con

frontation with this arbiter and a group of arresters, or

a tense verbal argument adjudicated by Supreme Judge

Isperia herself.

AZORIUS  CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are members of the Azorius Senate

might be sent on missions of law enforcement by their

B OROS  LEGION

Adventures involving the Boros Legion might have a

military bent, focusing on small-scale conflict between

groups of Boros soldiers and bands of rioters or raiders.

The legion is generally a prominent force for  law and

good in Ravnica, which makes it an appropriate home

guild for noble-minded player characters. Its holy bent

also makes villains drawn from its ranks particularly

dangerous and perhaps tragic.

military presence. They range from  towering fortresses

to small bunkers like the one shown in map 4.2.

in pursuit of their own private visions of justice. And

because the lower echelons of the guild are taught to

follow orders without question, even the villains among

the Boros can command companies of soldiers to help

them carry out their schemes.

Boros villains are inclined to engage in activity that

involves pursuing one's passion, acquiring power, or

exacting retribution. The Boros make good campaign

antagonists if the adventurers represent the forces of

chaos that the legion opposes- Rakdos revelers, Gruul

raiders, Golgari corrupters, or Dimir spies.

You could structure a campaign around the legion's

slow progress in taking over the authority of the Azo

rius Senate and imposing a sort of martial law on the

city. A campaign of this sort is particularly effective if

the characters initially work alongside the Boros, es

pecially if one or more characters belong to the legion.

They might help Boros soldiers drive off Gruul raiders

or uproot Dimir spies- clearly fighting against evil on

the side of the good and just. As time goes on, though,

their Boros allies might start taking their war against

evil too far. Innocent citizens get caught in the cross

fire, most punishment is cruel and excessive, and any

resistance is met with overwhelming force , to "set an

example" fo r anyone else who might consider opposing

the legion. A Boros ally (or even a close friend) of the

characters might become fully caught up in this fervor.

Perhaps the characters can talk some sense into their

old friend, but the resolution of the campaign might

force them to take more extreme measures to curb the

legion's excesses.

BOROS  CHARACTER GOALS

The Boros Legion sends individuals or small parties

on small-scale military missions, usually to help quell

riots or protect bystanders from dangerous situations.

Trusted characters might also be involved in internal

Masters of misdirection, infiltration. and espionage, Oi

mir spies and assassins pursue their objectives behind

layers of deception. Oimir agents make ideal villains for

adventures involving intrigue and mystery in  the shad

SAFE  HOUSE

House Dimir maintains safe houses throughout

Ravnica, many of them tucked away in the undercity,

for guild members who need to elude the ready reach of

the law. These sites are protected by magical wards that

confuse and misdirect all who approach- in parcicular,

spells that make intruders forget where they are or what

they're doing there.

A safe house can also be used to hold prisoners for

interrogation, with its protections equally effective in

preventing escape and in deterring intruders. Often, a

s ingle site serves both purposes.

Map 4.3 presents the floor plan of a typical Dimir

safe house.

SAFE  HOUSE ADVENTURES

The first task in almost any mission involving a Dimir

safe house is to find  the place. Most people who have

been to a safe house or its environs have no memory of

the event, thanks to Dimir mind magic.

The Safe House Adventures table offers some reasons

why characters might need to visit such a location. In

addition, you could use any other guild's sample location

as the site for a location-based adventure. with a simple

mission: uncover a Dimir spy in that location.

After stumbling into the safe house accidentally,

SAFE  H OUS E  WARDS

You  can make a Dimir safe house hard to find  and hard to

get into by using some of these options:

The safe house is  underground and accessible only

through a maze of tunnels and crevices.

The area surrounding the house is  protected  by a guards

and wards spell.  Navigating the ancient underground

corri dors or the modern al leyways  above ground

becomes more complicated when intersections are

clouded  by fog, doors are hidden and magically locked,

and magical compulsions drive visitors away.

A glyph of warding might cast fear, phantasmal force,  or

crown of madness on a character who triggers it-or sim

ply explode in a blast of cold energy.

Dimir agents might use alarm spells to ensure that they

know when intruders are approaching the safe house.

SAFE  HOUSE MAP

This safe house is a domed building encased in a stone

exoskeleton characteristic of Dimir construction. The

ground level is a comfortable living space that features

accommodations for at least five  people. It has five  bed

rooms, abundant storage space, a central lounge, a  rec

reation space, a dining room, a kitchen, and a pantry.

A secret door in the back of a shared closet leads to a

spiral staircase that descends to the basement, which

contains three small holding cells. A watch post at the

end of the hall allows a guard to keep an eye on the cells

and anyone coming down the stairs. An interrogation

Dr MIR A S  C A MPAIGN V I LLAINS

Dimir villains favor schemes involving captivity and

coercion, defamation, impersonation and disguise, mur

der, politics, t heft, and torture. Perhaps the most insidi

ous technique employed by the Oimir is the erasing and

modifying of me mories.

Because their tendrils  reach into every other guild,

Dimir villa ins could turn out to be the link between

plots that initially seem to be unconnected. Even when

individual missions might be straightforward dungeon

c rawls or  battles in the streets, the campaign revolves

around the mystery of determining the true villain.

At low and middle levels, the characters might find

themselves engaged in important but apparently unre

lated tasks. They might kill or drive off a monster that

is lairing in an abandoned arrester station (unwittingly

clearing the way for a  Dimir agent to be placed in the

station). They might help the Boros capture  a danger

ous Rakdos ringleader (who is  actually a  Dimir agent

working to destabilize Azorius influence). They migh t

unmask a  Dimir spy within one of their own guilds (who

is an internal rival of the Dimir villain).

As the characters advance in level, they might come

to realize that a  powerful and ambitious Azorius  figure

is going too far in spying on the populace, despite that

g uild's great success in  using precognitive mages to

arrest evildoers-especially Oimir spies. Ultimately, the

Azorius villain is revealed to be a  high-ranking Dimir

agent, a confidant of Lazav or even Lazav himself, who

is  trying to take over the Azorius Senate and turn it into

a s urve illance and espionage o rganization  unde r the vil

The Golgari are a strange underground aristocracy

in a city that mostly lacks a noble class; they are like

The rest of the structure is built down from there, with

the main, elegant halls and parlors on the second level.

Notably, a wide hallway on this level connects with a

passage leading to other areas of the undercity. A couple

of areas on this floor have crumbled with the weight of

the ages, but the place retains its stately grandeur.

GOLGA RI  AS  CAMPAIGN  VILLAINS

Given their affinity for death, necromancy, and decay,

the Golgari make excellent villains. Because they con

sider life and death as equal parts of the natural cycle,

they have no qualms about subjecting entire neighbor

hoods to poisonous gas or strangling vines to achieve

their various goals. When a Golgari assassin goes on

a killing spree, when a patch of their vegetative growth

begins "reclaiming" an area that isn't yet abandoned, or

when their fungus-bearing zombies emerge from the un

dercity to haunt the city streets, heroes are duty bound

to act against the threat.

The Golgari possess a combination of ambition and

ruthlessness that makes them extremely dangerous

adversaries. The tension among the various factions of

the swarm (the elves, the medusas, the krauJ, and the

rising erstwhile) adds an element of instability to the

1";!8  CJl\l'lf.Rf

lkl'\TIS<,\l>VENTUIHS

'

NOERCITV  MAN SION

mix. But perhaps the Golgari Swarm's most dangerous

quality is the widespread confidence among its mem

bers that it will survive any catastrophe that might befall

the surface world. This certainty means Golgari villains

will stop at nothing in an attempt to provoke such an

event- triggering a virulent plague, causing explosive

plant growth, or inciting the other guilds into open war,

for example. Over the course of a campaign, a group

of adventurers might foil Golgari pla ns to accomplish

a ll these things, or the characters might be constantly

struggling against one ongoing disaster.

For example, the characters might spend the early

part of the campaign resolving disputes between guilds,

unaware that the Golgari are actually the instigators of

those conflicts. Perhaps incidental to these missions,

they also face a spore druid who is in the early stages

of testing a terrible plague. Then, as the campaign

reaches higher levels, the plague breaks out again, this

time spreading rapidly. The crisis heightens tensions

among the other guilds, especially when food sources

are th reatened. At the climax of the campaign, the

heroes must defuse conflict among the guilds while

finding a way to get at the druid at the cause of it all,

who is locked in an undercity mansion waiting out the

Characters who a re members of the Golgari Swarm

might be sent on missions into the undercity, particu

la rly jobs that involve retrieval or salvage. T he secretive

agents of the Ochran are more likely to pursue goals

that call for theft or even assassination, while shamans

could participate in the swarm's work of "reclamation"

in surface neighborhoods. The Golgari Assignments

table reflects this range of possibilities. An assignment

can also serve as a side quest for Golgari adventurers

to undertake while pursuing a larger goal with a mixed

guild party.

GRUUL CLANS

An adventure involving the Gruul Clans typically re

volves around combat. The Gruul provide characters

with opportunities to fight  huge monsters and vicious

berserkers. The Gruul bring chaos and destruction with

them wherever they go, so they can easily disrupt and

complicate adventures involving any other guild. Any

time an adventure needs an injection of brutal viole nce,

the Gruul are a good tool for the purpose.

RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT

The Gruul have no interest in the buildings, streets, and

markets of Ravnica, except as targets for their raids.

The encampment shown in map 4.5 represents a tem

porary shelter in the ruins. the sort of place the Gruul

might call home for a time.

RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT ADVENT URES

Many Gruul adventures begin with a raid into a settled

part of the city. Adve nture rs might be able to follow the

raiders back ~o their camp- for the sake of revenge, in

an effort to retrieve something, or perhaps in chains.

RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT MAP

Built in a plaza su rrounded by crumbling ruins, this

camp offers some defe nsive advantages to its Gruul resi

dents. An old tower is the one intact structure the Gruul

use, because it offers a good vantage point over the sur

rounding area. A sluiceway provides potable water, and

a handful of scraggly trees are a reminder of nature's

potential to grow and flourish even among the ruins.

Otherwise, the camp is little more than a handful of

tents around a bonfire. A trash pit serves as a means of

waste disposal, a few makeshift cages can hold prison

ers, and a partially enclosed a rea to one side has been

converted into a pen for the beasts used by the Gruul.

GRUUL VILLAINS

The Gruul are straightforward villains, employing di

rect action and violence to tear down civilized society.

They aren't schemers, and they have little patience for

political maneuvering. Their cunning is that of a hunter

stalking its prey, and the threat they pose is rampant, ag

lZZET LEAGUE

Adventures involving the lzzet League typically concern

magical mishaps, dangerous inventions, and feats of

engineering (for good or ill).  Player characters might be

called upon to help clean up in the aflermath of a mag

ical disaster, contain the damage, or rein in an ongoing

danger. Or they could test or steal or destroy Izzet inven

tions, perhaps inadvertently causing magical catastro

phes in  the process.

EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP

The fundamental responsibility of the Izzet League is

building and maintaining Ravnica's infrastructure, and

the guild's work is responsible for many of the magical

technological conveniences that make life in the city

relatively safe and comfortable, from paved roadways

to running water. Under the leadership of the draconic

genius  Niv-Mizzet,  the Izzet have continued to  innovate,

taking their work far beyond the essential needs of in

frastructure and into the realm of wild invention. As a

result, the workshops and laboratories of the Izzet are

prone to magical mishaps, with results that range from

personal injury to district-wide destruction. It is perhaps

best for  Ravnica as a whole that most of lzzet's work

takes place in small workshops scattered throughout

the city, rather than being concentrated in one place

(with  the guildhall ofNivix being the notable exception).

Using the Gruul Clans as the main antagonists in a cam

return of an ancient god, llharg the Raze-Boar.

At low levels, characters could be drawn into seem

ingly coincidental clashes with  the Gruul. perhaps as

minor events in  adventures that involve other guilds.

Only later does a pattern emerge: the raids correspond

with certain astronomical events, the movements of

wurms, or another sign that the druids of the Old Ways

consider significant. As the adventurers' power grows,

so does that of the Gruul druids behind the trouble, and

soon the druids are actually instigating natural disas

ters- earthquakes and mighty storms, for example. As

the campaign reaches its climax, the Gruul Clans all

come together to perform an enormous ritual meant to

summon the Raze-Boar and bring an end to civilization

on Ravnica- and the adventurers must stop it.

EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP MA P

An Izzet workshop is a chaotic place, buzzing with en

ergy and activity. A mana generator in the basement fu

e ls a ll  the experimentation and construction above. The

generator draws power from the city infrastructure, and

ultimately from the Blistercoils, but the construction

depicted in map 4.6 is designed to amplify and focus the

magical energy. The machinery is fragile, so visitors are

strongly discouraged from entering the basement.

Some parts of the generator extend up to the ground

floor and the laboratory mezzanine above it, with por

tions of those floors open to the basement or covered

only by metal grates. The ground level is typically clut

tered with devices attached to the generator below, as

well as cast-off pieces of such devices, awaiting new

homes in new inventions. The laboratory mezzanine

includes three spaces where projects can be developed

in isolation, with thick walls providing some shielding

from potentially explosive results. Additional equipment

related to the generator system is housed in a tower and

on the workshop's roof, culminating in a storm siphon

that can harness and channel atmospheric energy (in

cluding lightning).

The Bizarre Magical Effects table provides sugges

tions for the sor t of events that might result from a failed

(or successful!) lzzet experiment, which can add spice to

any Izzet adventure.

l ZZET  V ILLAINS

The behavior that members of the Izzet League dis

play most often is careless disregard for safety, which

causes frequent upheavals on both small and large

scales. The true villains among the lzzet, though, aren't

just accident-prone but also committed to widespread

destruction. Out of madness or despair, they might

plot the destruction of precincts or districts. Hungry

for profit and power, they develop weapons capable of

destroying large groups of people and commit crimes to

get the resources they need to complete their research.

The Izzet Villains table includes examples of villains

as well as those who have less sinister intentions.

0RZHOV SYNDICATE

The Orzhov Syndicate is a sprawling network of orga

nized crime that operates behind a  facade of legitimate

banking, robed in the trappings of religion. Adventures

involving the Orzhov often include some combination

of fighting their criminal activities, interacting with

their wealth, and dealing with the haunting spirits and

sinister monsters that make up a significant part of the

guild's leadership.

GRAND  B ASI LICA

Combining the guild's interests in organized crime,

banking, and religion, Orzhov properties are ornate

basilicas as grand as any cathedral, though the business

conducted within them is driven by greed and lust for

power rather than altruistic motives. Each location in

cludes a grand space used not for purposes of worship,

but to ensure that petitioners feel small and abased be

fore the Orzhov oligarchs. Its lower level contains vaults

to store the ill-gotten riches of its leaders. as well as

crypts that hold the corpses of family members whose

spirits might still be active above.

GRAND  BASILICA ADVENTURES

An adventure in an Orzhov basilica, like the one

shown in map 4.7, can feel like the action  in a gangster

movie. a bank heist, or the exploration of a haunted

house. The Grand Basilica Adventures table provides

some examples.

0RZHOV BASILICA MAP

The Orzhov basilica is a huge church with the primary

function of intimidating those who come to confess,

atone, borrow, or pay. The nave features lofty archways,

towering statues of proud oligarchs, and a huge central

statue that depicts the Ghost Council surrounded by

supplicants. A pair of tall doors behind the statue leads

to an sanctuary where minor treasures- worth more

than most citizens will ever see in their lives, but less

than the true treasures hidden in the vaults-are put

on display to encourage devotion. Another statue of a

patron oligarch (usually the basilica's founder) stands at

the end of this room, flanked by spiral staircases leading

up into the spire and down to the crypts. The stairs are

secured behind ornate wrought iron gates.

The three levels of the spire hold luxurious apart

ments whe re living oligarchs dwell. The doors can be

locked from the outside, making them also suitable for

holding valuable prisoners.

The crypts and vaults below the basilica hold the

bones of ancient oligarchs and their most cherished

treasures. Some crypts contain just bones, others just

valuables, and some hold both. A security station keeps

watch on the entire level, and the guards there are typ

ically the only ones who have keys to open the metal

portcullises that obstruct the hallway.

cate's efforts to gain control of the adventurers. Recog

nizing the characters as powerful agents for change, one

or more pontiffs scheme to make s ure that the syndicate

can di rect that force toward goals of their choosing. In

typical O rzhov fashion, that generally means trying to

force the characters into debt, either to the Orzhov in

general or to an individual pontiff.

At low levels , the Orzhov might be nothing more than

a gentle force behind the scenes. If the adventurers need

help, an Orzhov agent mig ht appear and offer it.  [f they

commit crimes, the Orzhov find  out about it. The charac

Orzhov ministrants can provide healing and other cleri

call in favo rs in exchange for the help they have previ

Security, privacy, and terror are the priorities of this

are showered in blood or drawn into the show. Several

private booths surround the backstage area, with doors

that include shuttered windows to enable those inside to

keep an eye on the s how or carry out private business.

CULT OF RAKDOS

On most worlds. a cull dedicated to an ancient demon

lord would be an obvious villain, to be rooted out and ex

terminated at all costs. On Ravnica, though, the status

of the Cult of Rakdos isn't so clear-cut. lt is a guild like

the others. and its existence is mandated by the Guild

pact, so exterminating it and its founder would violate

the fundamental social order of the world. Although

the ranks of Rakdos include outright villains who crave

blood and mayhem. most of its members are performers

who just want to put on a good show. Not every per

formance ends in violence, and even when a riot does

break out, it's not always easy to pin the blame on the

entertainers.

Nonetheless, the Cult ofRakdos has more than its

share of truly villainous members, and the guild pro

vides ample opportunity for adventurers to fight against

R A KDOS VI L LAINS

Rakdos villains range in power from demented cultists

to sadistic demons. Most of them are driven by a desire

for unfettered mayhem. A hunger for a certain form of

immortality (being an artist who is remembered forever)

often feeds that desire, and insofar as Rakdos can be

considered the "god" of his cult, objectives related to

magic- carrying out his wishes, offering him sacrifices,

and rousing him into action- are also significant ob

jectives for some cultists. Driven as they are by selfish

impulse and emotion, Rakdos villains also sometimes

pursue schemes related  to passion, power, or revenge.

Specific examples appear on the Rakdos Villains table.

A coven of blood witches  (see chapter 6 for the stat

members of other guilds against their own allies.

Word spreads that a retiring performer wants to go

out with a bang, and their final  performance prom

ises to be explosive.

Mocking the absence of the Guildpact, a Rakdos

troupe takes over the Chamber of the Guildpact

and performs its satire before a captive audience.

A demon captures people and  makes a game of

Villain

A skilled puppeteer uses skeletal marionettes

to recreate historical acts of violence between

guilds-which are inexplicably repeated in  the real

world within the next few days.

A ringmaster has discovered  magic that fills  the

whole audience with  blood lust and sends them

rampaging through the streets.

A hypnotist is  programming audience members to

go into a mu rderous rage when a triggering event

occurs.

A crazed blood witch  (see chapter 6 for the stat

block)  hopes to rouse Rakdos by driving captured

sacrificial victims into his lair.

RAKDOS  AS  CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

You could build a campaign around the Cult ofRakdos's

efforts to stir its demonic patron into action against the

other guilds. The campaign might unfold amid steadily

increasing violence, escalating to episodes of wide

spread rioting and rampaging demons.

At lower levels, the adventurers might encounter

incidental violence spilling over from Rakdos venues:

a brawl outside a nightclub, overenthusiastic devils

spreading fires around a street stage, or the "acciden

tal" death of a few performers at the climax of their act.

As the campaign progresses, the characters might be

drawn into combating the efforts of blood witches who

are trying to exterminate the cult's most active enemies.

152

Cl!t\PTl::R  I  1  CR~o\llNl. AUHNIURIS

The more they foil  the cult's efforts, the more the char

acters themselves become targets of both ridicu le and

violent action.

At the campaign's climax, the adventurers might have

to interrupt a  ritual performed in Rakdos's lair in order

to prevent him from rampaging through the city-or if

they are too late to do that, they might have w  fight the

ancient demon lord himself.

RAKDO S  CH A RACTER  GOALS

Characters who are members of the Cult of Rakdos are

expected to be self-motivated and rarely take orders

from anyone other than Rakdos himself. The Rakdos

Assignments table includes some suggestions for adven

tures or side quests  that Rakdos characters might un

dertake on their own initiative, or perhaps at the r equest

of a  ringmaste r or a  fe llow performer.

SELESNYA  CONCLAVE

The Selesnya Conclave is most likely to be involved in

adventures as a  force for good, since many of its mem

bers are healers, diplomats, and mediators. It is a  nat

ural home for player characters-especially clerics and

druids- so it might serve as a  patron. Nonetheless, the

guild has  a  militaristic bent, and like nature itself it isn't

beyond corruption.

VERNADI  CENTER

The  basic unit of the Conclave's organization is the ver

nadi- a  community centered on a  large  tree and led by

the voda of th e e nclave, a dryad whose spirit is linked to

that tree. From the outside, a  vernadi might resemble a

peace ful  commune, and thus seem to be an easy target

for theft or assau lt.  But its temple gardens a re  protected

by sold ie rs  and archers, and eve n  the seemingly serene

initiates have som e  military training.

VERN A DI  CENTER A DVENTURES

Though a  vernadi lacks  the defensive  fortifications of,

for example, a  Boros garrison, it is still a difficult place

to attack or infiltrate . Because of the sheer numbers of

initiates that might be  ins ide, stealth is probably a  better

tactic than frontal assault. The Vernadi Center Adven

V ERNA DI  C E NTE R MAP

The temple s hown in map 4.9 is at the heart of the ver

nadi, built in and around a large tree. A circle of white

marble with several archways surrounds the base of

the tree, encompassing both a decorative garden where

meetings are held and a vegetable garden that provides

food  for the vernadi. The meeting garden includes

benches and a fountain of fresh water. Two small build

ings at ground level offer rustic accommodations for

members of the vernadi or guests.

Gracefully curving ramps sweep around the trunk

of the tree, leading to various other small buildings.

Several of these are open to the air.  offering sheltered

places for gatherings or quiet contemplation. Others are

apartments where leaders of the vernadi live.  Near the

top of the tree is a large, round  temple space.

S ELESNYA V I LLAI NS

True evil is rare among the members of Selesnya, with

misplaced religious zeal being the impetus that most

commonly pushes its members into acts of villainy.

SELES NYA  AS  C AMPAIGN V I LLAINS

You could structure a campaign around the efforts of the

Selesnya Conclave to finally bring a ll of Ravnica into its

welcoming embrace.

At lower levels, Selesnya might be an ally to the player

characte rs, offering support in the form of healing and

other magic. By the time the characters reach middle

leve ls, Selesnya emerges as a threat: perhaps it becomes

clear that several vernadi are us ing magical charms

(or other forms of coercion) to win converts, and the

conclave might even try to coerce the player characters

to join.  EventuaJly, their strategy evolves towa rd extor

tion and conquest, as they unleash wurms and similar

powerful beasts to threaten those who refuse to convert,

and they use the might of their armies to eliminate other

guilds and bring whole precincts under their control.

The climax of the campaign might involve the heroes

leading or coordinating the efforts of all  nine other

gu ilds to unite against the Selesnya th reat.

SELESNYA CHARACTER GOALS

SIMIC  COMBINE

Adventures that involve the Simic Combine delve into

the world of weird magical science. The Simic breed the

hybrids known as krasis, and those creations can break

free of their controllers and rampage through the city

streets. The Simic also infuse sapient races with animal

features, creating hybrids with adaptations designed for

combat and espionage.

GROWTH  CHAMBER

Although most Simic research is concentrated in the

nine zonots distributed all over Ravnica, mages affil

iated with the guild construct laboratories in various

other locations, particularly when they are seeking a

particular combination of environmental factors such

as air and water temperature, humidity, and ambient

light. Growth chambers like  the one depicted in map

4.10, built for the creation and incubation of krasis and

hybrids, could be located anywhere, from deep in the

undercity to the top of a tall spire.

GROWTH  CHAMBER ADVENTURES

Adventures in a growth chamber often involve dealing

GROWTH  CHAMBER MAP

This structure is attached to the side of some other

structure, much as a coral affixes itself to a solid sur

face. It might be built on the inside wall of a zonot or a

chasm, or it could abut another building at street level.

The chamber consists of a series of overlapping domes

with large, green-tinted windows.

The main entrance leads into a lobby with three deco

rative pools and three functional growth pods showcas

ing the most innocuous research being done here. The

pods are glass and metal devices filled with greenish,

vaguely glowing liquid, designed to allow life forms to

gestate and grow until they are ready to emerge. The

pods might be growing homunculi or category 1 krasis,

but it would be highly unusual for the Simic to display

the maturation of a hybrid soldier in s uch a public way.

Four smaller growth pods to one side serve the same

function. On the other s ide, a meeting room (containing

one more growth pod) offers a place for researchers to

meet with outsiders.

The first level above the main floor is dedicated to

living, cooking, and eating space for the researchers

and others who live here. A single large room acts as a

barracks for the scientists, with folding screens offering

some degree of privacy.

The other levels of the chamber are entirely dedicated

SIMlC AS  CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Many Simic researchers are driven by the belief that

the guild must adapt to the prospect of imminent war

among the guilds. Thus, villains among their number

are often those who seek to provoke the war they have

foreseen, or those who go to extraordinary, unethical, or

illegal lengths to conduct their work.

Jn the early stages of the campaign, the adventurers

might face Simic-related th reats such as rogue hybr ids

and ra mpaging krasis, which seem to be unrelated to

each other a nd  more or less accidenta l. As the campaign

progresses, it becomes clea r that these Simic creatures

a re part of a military build-up. The wrath of the othe r

guilds turns towa rd the combine, but this conflict is ex

actly what the guild has been preparing for.  Ultimately,  it

falls to the cha racters to either prevent the wa r, disable

KRENKO'S WAY

"Krenko's Way" is a short adventure for a party of four

to six 1st-level adventurers, who might advance to 2nd

level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in  the Tenth

District of Ravnica and serves as an introductory ad

venture to the setting. A balance of character classes

is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of

challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of

the guilds.

STORY OVERVIEW

Krenko is the boss of a notorious goblin mob, and he

has made his fortune and built his reputation by mostly

staying out of the guilds' way. He has managed to cause

no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District,

GUILOLESS VILLAINS

Not every villain in a Ravnica campaign is a member of a

guild, and not every scheme originates in the guildhalls.

As you build your own adventures in Ravnica, you can use

the suggestions in the Dungeon Master's Guide for creating

villains to craft a guildless villain, one who prefers the

independence of operating outside the guild structure or

even seeks to undermine that structure entirely. More of

ten than  not, though, the guilds turn out to be involved in

the schemes of even minor villains.

but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A

cunning opportunist, Krenko has spent years consoli

dating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang.

He cultivated connections among the ruthless and

powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem.

At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war

with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that

often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that Krenko

killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a

weapons drop went bad.

The remaining two brothers, Rikkig and Gardagig,

attempted to kill  Krenko in  retaliation for the death of

their kin. Before they could do the deed, Krenko was

apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into

Sawtooth Prison- near the legion's headquarters of

Sun home- to spend the rest of his life behind bars.

But someone as well connected as Krenko has ways of

shortening his own sentence.

Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to

Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of

the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate.

During the transfer, agents of a  former associate of

Krenko's created a distraction, and he was able to slip

away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his

next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal

enterprise.

and are desperate to make him pay.

RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

T his adventure requires the fifth edition D&D rulebooks

(Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and

Monster Manual). You should read the entire adventure

before attempting to run it.  If you'd prefer to play, you

shouldn't read any farther.

Text that appears in a box like this is  meant to be read

aloud or paraphrased for the players when their charac

ters first arrive at a location o r unde r a specific circum

stance, as desc ribed in the text.

The Monster Manual contains statistics for many of

the creatures found in this adventure. When a creature's

name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing

you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual.

If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text

tells you so.

ADVENTURE SUMMARY

The adventure begins at Sawtooth Prison as the party

is summoned by Nassius Ven, an official from the

Chamber of the Guildpact. He explains that Krenke has

escaped during a prison transfer, and it's urgent that the

characters locate him and bring him back to justice as

soon as possible and with discretion.

The characters can retrace the route of the transfer,

interview the guards for more information, and use

their contacts in the city to find  out more about Krenko.

If they are indiscreet in their investigation, they could

attract the attention of the Shattergang Brothers, a

rival gang intent on  murdering Krenke. Members of

that gang will trail the party throughout the city in an

attempt to find  the goblin mob boss's location.

Eventually, the adventurers find Krenko's hide-

out: a warehouse near a canal. A final show

down with the goblin mob boss, his retinue,

and possible Shattergang interlopers ensues.

Then it's merely a matter of delivering

Krenko back to Nassius before more trou

ble breaks out.

KRENKo' s  PATRON

Krenke arranged a deal with a faction

while in prison. During his transfer, mem

bers of that faction struck down his escort

and freed him.

At the beginning of the adventure, you can

roll a patron from the table below, or you can

STARTING THE ADVENTURE

Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase

the following introductory text:

Life in the Tenth  District is  never dull. A hub of constant

activity, it always offers a new opportunity, a new chal

lenge, a new intrigue. It is a place where a promising

adventurer like you can find your path to glory,  riches,

or power through your allegiance to your guild. But first

you'll need a job that wi ll help you  prove your worth.

Today is  your lucky day. This afternoon, you  received  a

brief note from one of your contacts: "I heard today from

someone who is looking for help finding something.

Seems  serious. Might be a good opportunity for you.

Meet outside Sawtooth Prison at dusk."

At the appointed time, you  find yourself gathered with

other like-minded individuals outside the front door to

the functional and unremarkable Sawtooth Prison.

Have the players introduce their characters to each

other, if they aren't acquainted already. This might also

be a time for  the characters to identify or discover per

sonal connections that might link them, s uch  as com

mon acquaintances or contacts, a shared background,

or living in the same neighborhood. Once the characters

have had a chance to get to know one another, read:

Light rain begins to patter on the cobblestones as  the

sun sets behind the spires and towers of the city. You  see

a male vedalken  in well-tailored clothes approach your

group from around the side of the prison. His deep blue

face bears a gentle but concerned expression.  He raises

his hand to hail you and speaks in a low tone as  his eyes

take in your group and the nearby environs.  "Are you here

to help us  find  something?"

This is Nassius Ven, a vedalken noble and a proctor

from the office of the Guildpact. While the Azorius

and Boros help maintain the law and keep the peace,

the office of the Guildpact tries to helps quell disputes

between the guilds while the Living Guildpact is away.

Nassius is here to hire the characters to track down

Krenko because he suspects the involvement of one

or more guilds in  the goblin boss's escape but doesn't

know who is involved.

ROLEPLAYING  NASSIUS VEN

After receiving affirmative answers from the party,

Nassius hands the characters a dossier from Sawtooth

Prison with an image of a smug, tough-looking male

goblin on it. Nassius offers up the following information,

which can be conveyed through conversation with him:

was apprehended to answer for a long list of crimes,

including murder. He allegedly incited a  riot that led to

the deaths of a guard and two inmates at this prison

a week ago. The warden decided enough was enough

and put through his transfer."

"Krenko has made a lot of enemies, but the Shatter

gang Brothers are his biggest threat. They're a rival

goblin gang specia lizing in illicit  weapons, and they

want Krenko dead in reprisal for the murder of one of

their lieutenants. The dead lieutenant also happens to

be the youngest of the three siblings that run the gang.

They'll tear apart the neighborhood to find  him once

they know he has escaped."

"Normally, we'd let the Azorius deal with this situa

tion, but we suspect that Krenko might have bad help

from one of the other guilds when he escaped. We are

enlisting others to investigate that connection, as it

could point to a bigger problem."

"We need you to track down Krenko and bring him

back alive. Then we can interrogate him and keep him

off the streets for good."

"I am prepared to give you ten  zinos right now to cover

any expenses you might incur during your investiga

tion. Upon delivery of the criminal, you'll  receive one

hundred zinos and my gratitude, which I will convey

to your guild leaders. Under no circumstances should

you attempt to question Krenko yourselves."

If he is asked, Nassius provides the guards' account of

the circumstances of his escape (see "Krenko's Patron").

The guards have already been thoroughly questioned,

and Krenko's trail has gone cold. Nassius is eager  to get

the characters started as soon as possible to prevent the

Shattergang Brothers from learning of Krenko's escape.

Nassius asks the party to bring Krenke to an old

Selesnya granary that was damaged in a Gruul raid

at the edge of the district. There, he'll take Kren ko

into custody.

Nassius is evasive about any questions regarding why

Krenke shouldn't be interrogated or why the characters

should bring him to the granary. His eyes dart back and

forth when confronted with these sorts of questions. A

character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight)

check knows that Nassius isn't being completely forth

right. Even if pressed, Nassius doesn't offer up any other

information beyond the mission objectives.

THE SEARCH  FOR KRENKO

Once Nassius has departed, the characters can get to

work. They can conduct their investigation however they

choose, but time is of the essence since eventually word

on the street gets back to the Shattergang Brothers and

they start another turf war to flush Krenke out.

T'IMELINE  OF EVENTS

Here's a timeline of what has happened since Krenke

escaped and what happens in the future, absent inter

ference. As soon as the adventurers get involved, events

might change drastically, but the following timeline can

still help you determine how the various NPCs involved

in the story will react to the player characters' actions.

Early Morning, Day 1: Krenko escapes.

Late Morning, Day 1: Krenke meets with his gang and

prepares a disguise for  himself.

Noon, Day 1: Krenko and his gang secu re an abandoned

warehouse as a temporary hideout for the mob boss.

Sunset, Day 1: The adventurers receive the mission.

Late Evening, Day 1: Krenke places a weapons order

with Falish, a human arms dealer.

Noon, Day 2: Additional enforcers from Krenko's gang

arrive at Krenko's hideout.

Sunset, Day 2: The Shattergang Brothers hear about

Krenko's escape and mobilize to find  him. Falish

leaves a cache of weapons at a drop point on Foundry

Street, and a goblin carries the weapons back to

Krenko's hideout.

Late Evening, Day 2: Explosions rock Foundry Street

as the Shattergang Brothers start violently coerc-

ing citizens who are known to have dealings with

Krenko. The Lyev Column (Azorius law enforcement)

is dispatched to Foundry Street to investigate the

disturbance.

Predawn, Day 3: The Shattergang Brothers find  out

Krenko's location, and a great explosion goes off

there, leveling the building and killing many goblins

(Krenke survives).

Noon, Day 3: The Foundry Street vicinity is subject to

terrible goblin gang violence. The Boros Legion is

called in to pacify the area.

THE DOSSIER

The adventurers can find the following information in

the Sawtooth Prison dossier:

Krenke has been a goblin mob boss for several years.

His turf was around Foundry Street. He has been a

person of interest in numerous crimes befitting a mob

ster but managed to evade the law-until recently.

Krenko was brought into custody by Gideon Jura, a

freelancer working with the Boros Legion at the time.

Krenke was found guilty of murdering Dargig, one of

the Shattergang Brothers, and of assault with a deadly

weapon against Gideon Jura.

The weapon on his person at the time of arrest was a

magic shiv (a prison knife). Reportedly, it could punch

through force barriers. It isn't known how Krenko ob

tained the weapon.

Krenko's notable associates include the mysterious

Mr. Taz (no other information provided) and a rene

gade Izzet weapons inventor named Falish (female

human, seen around Tin Street). Both are also per

sons of interest to the Azorius.

HITTING THE  STREETS

The characters can take several approaches to investi

gating Krenko's whereabouts: meeting with contacts,

sussing out rumors, or visiting important locations.

MEET WITH  CONTACTS

ff a character has an appropriate contact to press for

information, they can reach out to that contact for as

sistance. It takes 1 hour to arrange a meeting with the

contact and  ld6 hours for the contact to find one previ

ously unknown piece of information, unless that contact

would have the information on hand.

GAT H ER  R U MORS

Characters can go to public gathering places to attempt

to obtain information. After ld6 hours, a character

sifting through rumors makes a DC 15 Charisma (Per

suasion) check. On a success, they find  out one previ

ously unknown piece of information from among those

given below:

Krenko's absence has hurt his gang's reputation.

Other gangs have been encroaching on his territory,

and it's only a matter of time before there's another

power struggle played out in  the streets.

Tin Street is a bustling center of trade and the terri

tory of the Shattergang Brothers. They have become

emboldened since Krenko was put away and are

readying for war to take out his gang once and fo r all.

Foundry Street is where you'll find  manufacturing fa

cilities for the Tenth District, and it's  Krenko's gang's

turf. His enforcers are still squabbling over who

should lead. For now, they all have an uneasy truce

with each other.

Some goblins were pulling up a sewer grate at a very

early hour west of the plaza. They didn't look like

maintenance workers and threatened anyone that

came too close. The approximate location of this inci

dent is obtained.

<.JllAPTER  -1-

<.JRfAfl1'0  \OVENTURES

163

Three locations important to the adventure are men

tioned in the information above: the sewers. Foundry

Street, and Tin Street. Each site is described in detail

below. The travel time (on foot) between any two of

these locations is 30 minutes to  1 hour.

T H E  SEWERS A T  P LAZA WEST

Cha racters heading west of the plaza on a tip they re

ceived  earlier might look for a sewer grate that is out of

place. lt takes 1 hour and a successful DC  10 Wisdom

(Perception) check to find a grate with scrapes from a

crowbar on  it. Alternatively, the characters can interview

residents in  the area, in which case it takes half an hour

and a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to

find  the location of the grate.

The grate can be pulled up with a successful  DC 15

Strength check. Once the grate is opened, read:

A circular ma intenance shaft plunges down into the

darkness. An  iron ladder is  bolted to one side of the

shaft. The pungent smell of the sewers wafts up to your

nose. A faint light is visible at the bottom, illuminating

refuse-filled water.

There is no light source in  the shaft, which continues

down 50 feet  until it ends in a folding ladder with a dan

gling cord. When unfolded, the ladder reaches another

20 feet to the sewer tunnel floor.  When the characters

descend to th e floor,  read:

You  stand shin-deep in sewer water,  in  a dimly lit tunnel.

There's a raised walkway on either side that gets you out

of the smelly, muck-filled water. Small lamps housing

magical flames shed dim light. The walls are covered in

moss and lichen.

T he tunnel is dimly lit by small continual flame  bea

cons positioned every 30 feet or so on alternating sides

of the 20-foot-high tunnel.  The sewer tunnel is 30 feet

wide and continues in both directions. The tunnel has

a raised walkway 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall along both

sides. The main passage is flowing with  I-foot-deep wa

ter and smelly refuse.

Krenko and three other goblins came this way,  head

ing to his new hideout. The characters can spot signs of

grimy boot prints made by Small creatures on one of the

walkways by succeeding on  a DC  10 Wisdom (Percep

tion) check. After find ing the prints, they can continue to

track them through the sewer tunnels by succeeding on

a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check.  For every day since

the goblins came through here, add 5 to the DC of the

check. It takes 2 hours to navigate the twisting tunnels

at normal walking speed. The tunnels are near Golgari

territory.  but above the undercity.

For each hour the party spends in the sewers, roll a

d20. On a  15 or higher,  the party has an encounter de

termined by rolling on the Sewer Encounters table.

The tracks end at another maintenance shaft in  the

ceiling of the tunnel. A cord dangles down from the

shaft; pulling on it releases a folding ladder that can

easily be climbed. The shaft terminates in a grate,

which can be pushed aside with a successful DC 15

Strength check.

The characters emerge in an alley beside an old ware

house on a canal dock near Foundry Street, in Precinct

Six of the Tenth District. The tracks continue up to the

warehouse.

TI N  S T REET

This bustling market area is busy with the flow of mer

chants, entertainers, shoppers, and revelers.  During

daytime hours, Tin Street is a prime destination for

shopping and dining. At  night, theaters and taverns

come al ive.

Tin Street is one of the two avenues that traverse the

entire Tenth District (see chapter 3). Where it passes

through Precinct Six, the Shattergang Brothers have

claimed much of it as their turf. They keep a keen eye

out for Azorius arresters, rival gang members, and any

one who asks too many questions.

Tin Street is also the home of Falish, a renegade Izzet

arms dealer who,  for the right price, supplies criminals

with weapons and explosives.

SHATTERGANG  E AVES DROPPI NG

If a check to gather rumors fails by 5 or more, or the

characters are otherwise indiscreet while investigat-

ing around Tin Street, word gets to the Shattergang

Brothers that someone has been asking about Krenko.

They send an unremarkably dressed, beady-eyed goblin

named Erko to tail the characters (about 60 feet) and

sneak up to eavesdrop on conversations. If a character's

passive Wisdom (Perception) score equals or exceeds

the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check, that character no

tices that they're being followed or observed.

If Erko notices the party has seen him, he tries to run

away,  back to one of his gang's hideouts. As he makes

his way down the busy market of Tin Street, you can

conduct this scene as a chase, using the chase rules and

the Urban Chase Complications table in chapter 8 of the

Dungeon Master's Guide.

In addition to his weapons, Erko carries a Oask of

alchemist's fire,  which he hurls at the first creature that

threatens him. See chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook

for  rules on using alchemist's fire.

lf a character interrogates Erko and succeeds on

a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, the goblin

reveals that he works for the Shattergang Brothers,

and they have an interest in knowing what goes on in

their turf. He doesn't reveal their hideout under any

circumstances.

IfErko tails the adventurers long enough to discover

Krenko's location, the Shattergang Brothers arrive at

Krenko's hideout in force 2 hours later.

FINDING FALISH

The renegade Izzet arms dealer Palish lives and works

on Tin Street. Characters can ask around the neighbor

hood to discover the location of her secret shop, but the

information doesn't come easy.

Taverns. Falish is a regular at the Millstone, a seedy

tavern that caters to the rough and rowdy. The tavern's

owner and barkeep is Wyroon, a male minotaur with a

cracked horn and a surly disposition. He was drummed

out of the Boros Legion for  insubordination a few years

ago. His starting attitude is indifferent, but if a character

succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, he'll

tell the characters that Palish comes down some nights

for a drink or two. Falish stops by early in  the evening of

Day 2, without her flamethrower.

Merchants. Very few  merchants on Tin Street know

Falish, except for a female goblin a lchemist named

Noggra, who runs an apothecary shop called Noggra's

Remedies. Noggra often patches up injured gang mem

bers after their scuffles, and occasionally hides them

from the law. She sometimes sells Falish alchemical

substances to enhance her weapons. Her starting atti

tude toward the party is indifferent. If a character asks

her about Falish and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma

(Intimidation or Persuasion) check, she gives up  Falish's

location. A character who offers Noggra 10 gp or more

makes this check with advantage.

Street Talk. Characters can simply ask around the

neighborhood to try to find  Falish. lf so, use the rules for

gathering rumors under "Hitting the Streets."

FALISH'S WORKSHOP

Once the characters determine Falish's location and

travel there, read:

Following the directions to Falish's shop, you  find your

self in an alley  behind a restaurant.  Near the back door to

the establishment is a smaller,  padlocked iron door that

looks as  if it came from  a vault.

The doo r has a padlock that requires a successful DC

15 Dexterity check to pick with thieves' tools, or a suc

cessful DC 20 Strength check to force open. Once it is

open, read:

Beyond the door, you see a na rrow staircase that leads

twenty feet down to a green-tinged copper door, with a

closed sliding peephole in its center.

This copper door is locked and requires a successful

DC  15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to open. It can

also be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength

check. The door is trapped with a glyph of warding spell

that triggers when a character attempts to pick the lock

or force open the door. The triggered glyph casts sleep

at 3rd level, affecting 9d8 hit points of creatures. A

character who searches the door for traps can detect the

glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence(lnvestiga

tion) check.

When the characters enter the room, read:

The fl ickering glow of lanterns reveals a haphazard room

that is thi rty  feet long and twenty feet wide,  packed with

equipment, tools, and materials. Hanging from  the wall

are all manner of weapons.  Boxes and small crates are

stuffed under tables that overflow with flasks.  A work

bench is  piled high with tools. There's a small living area

with a bed and a large iron stove  in  the back of the room.

This room serves as a laboratory, showroom, and liv

ing quarters for Palish, a human scorchbringer guard

(see chapter 6 for the stat block). She deals in alchemi

cally treated weapons and explosives. A renegade who

was expelled from the lzzet League, Palish maintains

contacts within the guild, who provide her with the

Cll\PrER  l  I <.REATING  \DVl::NTURES

165

materials she uses to upgrade weapons. She sells her

wares to many of the gangs in the Tenth District.

If characters trigger the glyph trap on the door, Palish

grabs her gear and heads out through a secret door in

the back of her living quarters as quickly as possible,

closing the door behind her. The secret door opens into

a tunnel that leads down into the sewers. When closed,

the secret door can be found with a successful DC 15

Wisdom (Perception) check.

If the characters surprise Falish or manage to sneak

in, she realizes she has no quick escape and is willing

to cooperate to a certain extent to get the characters out

of her home. In exchange for freedom, she reveals the

following information:

Krenko contacted her to deliver some weapons, explo

sives, and any magic items she had to a drop point on

Foundry Street, outside the Smokehouse Inn. She's

supposed to make the drop at sunset on  the day after

Krenko's escape.

Krenko is planning on  using the weapons to launch

a preemptive attack on the Shattergang Brothers to

reassert that he's back in power.

Krenko is probably hiding somewhere near the drop

point. Falish knows that Krenko and his rescuers

were spotted entering a sewer grate west of the plaza.

Treasure.  Falish has one of each weapon in the

Player's Handbook with a price of no more than 25 gp

hanging from  the walls of her quarters. On her work ta

bles are three flasks of alchemist's fire, one vial of acid,

alchemist's supplies, tinker's tools, a set of thieves' tools,

and most of the components needed to assemble two

bombs. Under one of the tables is a small, locked strong

box requiring thieves' tools and a successful DC  15 Dex

terity check to open. Inside the strongbox are 200 zinos

(gp), 3 strips of mizzium (a durable magical metal), and

an eversmoking bottle.

FOUNDRY STREET

Foundry Street is where a lot of the manufacturing hap

pens in  the Tenth District. Workers toil day and night to

make goods that Ravnicans buy in the market, and to

supply the Boros Legion with armor and weapons.

Goblins are common in this part of the city, and it is

Krenko's gang's turf. Most of the gang members now

know that Krenko has escaped, and the bickering be

tween his enforcers has subsided with Krenko back on

the streets.

Most of the folk  who live around Foundry Street know

to report any Azorius presence or nosy outsiders to a

goblin gang member that serves as the block captain. If

the characters conduct their investigation here, Kren

ko's gang learns about it within half an hour and sends

out a crew Lo deal with the situation.

WELCOMING PARTY

Krenko's goblin gang approaches the characters. Their

starting attitude is  hostile, and they hurl insults and try

to get the characters to leave their turf. If the adventur

ers don't comply, the goblins fight  them. If more than

half the goblins are defeated, the remaining gang mem

bers try to escape.

The gang that approaches the groups consists of six

goblin gang members (see the stat block). A character

who interrogates a captured goblin and succeeds on a

DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check learns Krenko's

location. Alternatively, a character who offers the goblins

a bribe of 10 gp or more and succeeds on a DC 20 Cha

risma (Persuasion) check can get the same information.

SHATTERGANG's  RESPONSE

Late in the evening on Day 2, the Shattergang Brothers

blow up three of Krenko's safe houses along Foundry

Street. The explosions attract the Azorius Senate, which

sends twenty soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block)

to secure the area and question bystanders.

Characters who are causing trouble with the locals

around Foundry Street during this time might be de

tained at the Foundry Street arrester station for ques

tioning. Characters are detained for ld4 hours unless

one of them succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persua

sion) check, which shortens the time to 10  minutes.

. ..

KRENKO'S HIDEOUT

The characters  can locate Krenko's hideout either by

interrogating members of his gang, following the tracks

from the sewer, or following a goblin back from the drop

point where Falish leaves Krenko's weapons. Once they

have found  the warehouse, read:

A large, soot-stained wooden  building with a  faded

symbol of the Boros  Legion  sits at the edge of a canal,

its timbers cracked and singed. A closed bay door faces

north toward the water, and a wooden t rack runs from

the building al l the way to the edge of a pier. A similar

bay door faces south toward the ma in street. On the alley

sides of the building are two doors-a doub le door on

the west side, and a single door on the east side.

This old warehouse used to store equipment finished

from the nearby foundries for the Boros Legion's use. It

was badly burned in a gang war a few years ago and has

since been abandoned by the Boros. Krenko's gang has

used it occasionally as a secret meeting spot, and now

Krenko is using it as his hideout.

The warehouse is 40 feet tall, 60 feet wide, and 120

feet long. It has no windows, but the outer walls are

brittle and fire-damaged; a number of small holes, 1 or 2

feet in diameter, have opened up in various places. Deal

ing 5 damage to a section of the wall creates an opening

that a Medium or smaller creature can walk through.

KRENKo's  GANG

All members of Kren ko's gang are goblin gang mem

bers (see the stat block). Each goblin carries a whistle

(worn on a rope around its neck), which it can blow as

an action to sound the alarm. A goblin might carry an-

LOOKOUTS

A goblin (see "Krenko's Gang" for  modified statistics) is

posted outside each door. If a guard sees one or more

characters approaching the warehouse, it signals the

other guards by blowing a whistle around its neck. It

remains vigilant but doesn't signal the others if the char

acters are visible on the street but don't make their way

to the warehouse. The goblins don't use a light source at

night, relying on their darkvision.

Characters might take the time to observe the look

outs from afar. The rooftops of nearby buildings make

excellent vantage points. The buildings across the

main street are 50 feet away; those in the alleys are 20

feet away.

CHANGING OF T HE  GUARD

Every 4 hours, new goblins from Krenko's gang arrive

to relieve the lookouts. During this time, they're usually

distracted as they chat among themselves for  ldlO min

utes. While they're distracted, characters have advan

tage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide or move

quietly in the area.

DAY 2 ARRIVALS

At noon on the second day,  four more goblins arrive.

Two position themselves inside on the catwalk, and two

walk the warehouse floor.

DAY3  CHAOS

In the small hours of the third day, the Shattergang

Brothers finally manage to discover Krenko's where

abouts and send a team of ten goblins to toss bombs at

the warehouse and its occupants.

In addition to their normal gear, these goblins each

carry one bomb. As an action, a goblin can light a bomb

and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away.  Each creature

within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dex

terity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) fire damage.

Any survivors ofKrenko's gang flee the warehouse

and scatter into the city after this assault.

WAREHOUSE  LOCATIONS

The following locations are keyed to map 4.11, which

shows the interior of the warehouse.

O F FIC E

This room is unlit. If the characters  have darkvision or a

light source, describe the room as follows:

This room is twenty feet square and has a ten -foot-high

ceiling.  It  appears to be an office and makeshift living

quarters. A heavy wooden table stands in the center of

the room,  ringed  by six chairs. Under it is an iron box. To

the south is a cot covered in blankets. Beside it is a sack

full  of clothes and the remains of several  meals served

on fine dinnerware. A door sits in  the middle of the wall

to the east, with a  large window beside it offering a view

of the warehouse beyond.

Krenko (see below) is holed up here- with two

gob lin bosses that serve as his enforcers-planning

a preemptive strike on the Shattergang Brothers. In

addition to his weapons, Krenko carries a vial of acid, a

flask of alchemist's fire, a bag of caltrops, a vial of basic

poison, and the key to the iron strongbox (see "Trea

R EACTIONS

Redirect Attack. When a creature Krenko can see targets him

with an attack,  Krenko chooses another goblin within  5 feet of

him. The two goblins swap places, and the chosen goblin be

comes the target instead.

TREASURE

The iron strongbox under a desk contains funds Krenko

was gathering to pay off Falish. It is locked and can be

opened with the key in Krenko's possession, or with

thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

Inside the box are 350 zinos (gp), two gold rings inset

with small  rubies (worth 50 gp each), and a potion of

giant strength (hill).

CATWAL K

A 3-foot-wide wooden catwalk is attached to the inside

walls of the warehouse 20 feet above the floor.  A creaky,

charred, narrow, wrap-around wooden staircase near

the center of the east wall leads up to it.

Two goblin gang members (see the stat block) patrol

the catwalk at all  times, rotating in a s imilar way to the

lookouts outside.

W EAKENED  STAIRCASE

One of the steps of the catwalk staircase is ready to col

lapse. This fragil e board is located 10 feet off the ground

and can be spotted by anyone on the stairs who has a

passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher. A

creature that weighs more than 100 pounds that steps

on the board must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving

throw or fall  10 feet to the ground below. The gap that

the collapsing board creates can be easily avoided by

other creatures walking up the stairs.

If one side of the catwalk takes 10 or more damage,

that side collapses. Creatures on the walkway when this

happens fall  20 feet to the warehouse floor below.

MAIN FLOOR ---

The warehouse is lit inside by lanterns placed on  hooks

located 5 feet up on the wall every 30 feet or so, below

the catwalk. The goblins keep this area brightly lit, since

their darkvision only extends for 60 feet. When the char

acters enter, read:

The glowing lantern light reveals a warehouse charred by

a fire . To the north and south are large,  iron-reinforced

bay doors, operated from  the ground by chains and  pul

leys. The western wall  has a square room in  the center

that fills  a twenty-foot-by-twenty-foot section of the ware

house floor. The room has a door and window on the

side facing the center of the warehouse floor.

A catwalk encircles the interior twenty feet above the

floor. Stairs lead  up to it near the center of the eastern

wa ll.  Dozens of large boxes and crates are scatte red

around the wa rehouse, their integrity in  question due

to fire damage. A pair of wooden  rails runs throu gh the

center of the room. On the rai ls sits a giant wooden

wheeled cart. Towering over the cart is a ten -foot-high,

soot-stained  iron statue. It looks vaguely humanoid, with

claw-like appen dages at the ends of its arms. In place of

its head is  a cavity containing a  seat with a series of le

vers all  around it.

Dealing 20 damage or more to a bay door creates

a hole that a Medium or smaller creature can walk

through. A character can use an action to open a bay

door using its pulley system.

Charred and cracked wooden containers are scat

tered around the room. Nothing of value remains in

any of them.

Resting on the rails that run through the center of the

room is a  Large cart. The north and south walls of the

cart can be lowe red to create ramps leading up to the

cart's bed.

Near the cart is a loading rig (see the stat block) cov

ered in soot and currently inactive. A seat cavity built

into the top the rig contains a series of small plates and

levers. A creature in  the seat can attempt a DC 10 In

telligence (Arcana) check to figure out how to press the

plates in the correct sequence to activate or deactivate

the rig.  Pressing the plates requires an action. Once the

rig is activated, a creature in the seat can pilot it using

the levers. The rig moves as its controller directs it, and

the controller can use an action to direct the rig to take

the Dash, Disengage. or Dodge action, or the Multiat

tack or Slam actions as given in its stat block.

A creature with tinker's tools can try to repair damage

to the rig. After spending 1 hour making repairs, the

creature makes a  DC  l 5 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If

the check succeeds, the rig regains ld6 hit points.

CONFRONTING KRENKO

Krenko tries to escape if he is reduced to half his hit

points or fewer, ordering his goblin enforcers cover him

as he makes his getaway. He runs to the loading rig on

the warehouse floor and activates it in an effort to fight

his way out and flee . If he can get outside, he makes his

way to the dock and jumps into the canal to swim away.

If Krenko is captured, he tries to convince the adven

turers that bringing him to justice isn't in the best inter

est of the city. He might make any or all of the following

arguments in his defense:

Without his leadership, the goblin gangs have been

thrown into chaos, and the only thing keeping the

Shattergang Brothers from blowing things up is his

gang- with him leading it.

He is emphatic that his killing ofDargig was an act

of self-defense and that he was framed by the Boros

Legion, which he suspects is in  league with the Shat

tergang Brothers. Characters who succeed on a DC 16

Wisdom (Insight) check sense he's lying, as he s ubtly

looks past them while making his plea.

Krenko is willing to offer the party a deal. He'll give

them everything in his office strongbox if they tell

Nassius they didn't find him.

Krenko warns the party that Nassius isn't all he ap

pears to be. Krenko suspects that Nassius is in some

one's pocket but doesn't know who that someone is.

Krenko doesn't offer up any information on the allies

that aided him in his escape, but he identifies them if

pressed. He also remains tight-lipped on the subject of

Mr. Taz, offering only the fol lowing if a character makes

a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check: "Mr.

Taz gave me a nice shiv as a present for a job once, and

I'd love to get my mitts on another one someday.

THE HANDOFF

When the characters reach the meeting point that Nas

sius specified, read the followi ng:

As  the rain  intensifies into a downpour, you head to the

outskirts of the Tenth District. You're directed to the old

granary that Nassius picked as  the rendezvous point. The

wet, crumbling clay building sits out in an  untended fie ld

and  is overgrown with all  manner of vegetation, almost

completely reclaimed by the wild. Nassius steps out of

the entryway into the field, holding a small  purse and

flanked by two heavily armed guards.

Nassius has asked for Azorius assistance but has also

brought two human veterans wearing no obvious guild

identifiers to help take Krenke into custody. Six Azorius

soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) are hidden in

various spots between 50 and 100 feet of the front of the

granary, ready to subdue characters who make a wrong

move, or to take down Krenko if he tries to flee.

Nassius wants the characters to complete the ex

change without a fuss and head home. He asks them if

they questioned Krenko, and to recount what the goblin

said to them. Krenko attempts to call out Nassius as a

liar and a corrupt official, but Nassius's veterans move to

gag Krenko to stop him from talking.

Nassius doesn't answer any questions about where

he's taking Krenko, nor does he address the veracity of

any claims of corruption. He remarks that he serves the

office of the Guildpact, and he's taking Krenke in for the

good of the city. The Shattergang Brothers might still

take over the turf of Krenko's gang, but probably without

a destructive gang war.

N Assrus's PATRON

Krenko was right about one thing: Nassius Ven has

been using his position to keep himself wealthy and pro

tected. A patron approached Nassius and made a deal to

have Krenko delivered to them instead of to his rightful

place in his new cell at Udzec.  Nassius was assured

that Krenko would eventually make his way back to the

prison alive,  but the patron wanted to have a few words

with him first.

To determine whom Nassius Ven cut a deal with, you

can roll to determine a patron from the table below, or

you can choose one. If the patron is a guild, you should

select a guild that isn't represented by an adventurer in

the party. The patron might influence future dealings

with both Nassius Ven and Krenko.

THE END?

The characters earn 1 renown in their guild if they de

liver Krenko to Nassius.

In addition to the adventure seeds in the first part of

this chapter, you can build on the events of this adven

ture to chart a course for the party's next adventures.

Consider these questions:

Who were Krenko's and Nassius's allies? How might

they respond to the characters' actions?

What's the balance of power between Kren ko's gang

and the Shattergang Brothers? Is either gang likely to

take revenge on  the characters for what they did? Or

did the characters earn the gratitude of either gang?

How might Nassius, Krenko, Falish, and other NPCs

interact with the adventurers in the future? Could one

of them ask for the characters' help with a new crisis,

or turn into a dangerous antagonist?

Did the characters use any of their contacts to gather

information? Might those individuals' involvement

cause them trouble that could involve the adventurers?

CHAPTER 4  I  CR.EATING ADVl::NTURES

CHAPTER 5:  TREASURES

HOSE WHO A.RE  BOLD OR CUNNING ENOUGH

can find treasures aplenty to reward their

exploits in Ravnica. Coins change hands in

back alleys, chests of riches are laden onto

beasts of burden, and fine objects of art stand on d isplay

in museums and galleries. Obscene wealth lies secreted

away in Orzhov vaults, the Azorius Senate's payroll is a

bureaucratic tangle, and House Dimir greases countless

palms with an apparently endless fortune. And items of

magic lure adventurers and thieves with the promise of

greater power.

COINS IN TREASURE

When you use the treasure tables in chapter 7 of the

Dungeon Master's Guide, you can change the type of

coinage found if you'd like to associate the coins with a

particular guild. For more information about coinage in

Ravnica, see the "Currency: Zibs and Zinos" section in

this book's introduction.

Copper pieces encountered in treasure are either

standard Azorius zibs or Orzhov alms-coins. A pouch

of alms-coins might belong to someone who has been

impoverished- or someone who makes a habit of rob

bing from the poor. A chest full  of alms-coins could be

an Orzhov lockbox used to hold  the coins before they are

distributed to the poor.

Silver coins minted by the Azorius Senate are worth

25 cp, so they might be found  in smaller numbers than

the standard s ilver pieces mentioned on the treasure ta

bles. They are common currency, so they're found in the

coin purses of virtually everyone in Ravnica. A hoard of

s ilver coins might be amassed by a miser or stored in a

bank vau lt (or stolen from such places).

Electrum pieces found  in  treasure are Azorius 50-zib

coins. These coins are more common than electrum

pieces are on most other D&D worlds, and they serve

a function very similar to the silver 25-zib coins. You

might reflect this fact by turning some s ilver pieces

found as treasure into electrum pieces.

Gold coins in treasure translate directly to 1-zino

coins, which could be the standard coins of Azorius

mint or Boros coins (which might have been used as the

weekly pay of a soldier in the Legion). A treasure might

include Boros 5-zino coins, representing the salary of

an officer or a payment made from  the Legion to an

other guild.

Platinum pieces found  in treasure are Orzhov 10-zino

coins. They might have originally belonged to an Orzhov

pontiff. Perhaps they were withdrawn from an account

in an Orzhov bank-which suggests someone wealthy

and powerful, possibly with criminal connections. A

significant treasure find  might include a stash of Orzhov

100-zino coins (one-tenth the number of platinum pieces

found on  the treasure table), which almost certainly be

longs to a powerful Orzhov scion who wants it back.

GUILD  C HAR MS

A guild charm is a magical effect placed on an otherwise

mundane item. Charms are often given to favored mem

bers of the guild- those whose renown scores with their

guilds have reached 10 or higher-or those entrusted

with important missions. A charm typically manifests as

the gui ld's symbol emblazoned on an item that is worn

or carried by the chosen creature.

A guild charm can be used only a certain number of

times before it vanishes, and only by the creature upon

which it was bestowed. If you use a charm to cast a

spell, you can do so without expending a spell slot or

providing any components. The spell's save DC is 15, its

attack bonus is +7, and the spellcasting ability modifier

for any spell effects is +4.

A charm can't be used in the area created by an anti

magic field spell or a similar effect. The guild master of

the charm's guild can revoke the charm as an action, but

otherwise the charm can't be removed from  the object

on which it was placed by anything short of divine inter

vention or a  wish spell.

The charms associated with each guild are de

scribed below.

AZORIUS  CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the hold per

son (3rd-level version), command, or counterspell spell.

DIMIR CHARM

When you activate this charm, you  can cast the blink or

sleep (3rd-level version) spell. Alternatively, when you

take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible

turn or until you attack or cast a spell. The charm van

ishes after you activate it.

of vitality or conjure animals spell. Alternatively, as an

action, you can give up to three creatures of your choice

within 30 feet of you  resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,

and slashing damage until the end of your next turn.

The charm vanishes after you activate it.

SIMIC  CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the enhance

ability (3rd-level version), enlarge/reduce, or gaseous

form  spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

MAGIC  ITEMS

Magic items are abundant on Ravnica. Izzet workshops

and foundries create a plethora of wild and often dan

gerous items, and spellcasters from every guild craft

items for their own use and that of their guild mates.

More powerful items are created in grand experiments

or by angelic blessings, or they find  their way out of hid

den vaults and ancient underground ruins.

GUILDS AND  MAGIC  ITEMS

Each of Ravnica's guilds has an affinity for certain

magic items. This section identifies the magic items

most likely to be created, used, or valued by each guild.

The lists include the magic items in this book (referred

to as GGR) and in  the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG)

that are particularly appropriate for  the guilds.

The gui ld lists are by no means comprehensive; the

guilds are happy to use whatever resources become

available to them, magical or otherwise. But the items

shown here are particularly prized and even coveted by

the guilds. Word of the discovery of a holy avenger, for

example, can mobilize a whole Boros garrison to search

for  it and claim it for  the legion's use. And if such an

item is stolen from  the Boros, the legion will go to equal

lengths to reclaim it and punish the thieves.

Some items created on Ravnica are prized by all the

guilds; they are listed on the General Items table.

lZZET ITEMS

The Izzet League is the most prolific creator of magic

items in Ravnica. Its inventions can be unpredictable

and downright dangerous, but they can also be useful

tools, weapons, and implements of magical manipula

tion . Izzet researchers are prone to giving their magic

items special names, so what one person might call a

staff of thunder and lightning might be an electrosonic

field manipulator to its Izzet wielder.

possession of magic items as a mark of status, whether

those items are ostentatiously on display or hidden

away in  a vault. Items that the guild creates are often

extremely ornate; Orzhov-made  wings of flying, for ex

every feather looks like colorful stained glass. Items that

magically increase the wearer's imposing presence and

MAGIC  ITEM  DESCRIPTIONS

This section presents an assortment of magic items in

alphabetical order. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for

the rules on magic items.

GUILD  K EYRUNE

Wondrous item, rarity by keyrune (requires attunement

by a member of the relevant guild)

Associated with a particular guild, a guild keyrune is a

ceremonial, s tylized key, about 1 foot long,  made from

carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of

authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places

in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's

discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon

attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.

Whe n you use an action to speak the item's command

word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccu

pied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms

into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the crea

ture, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the Monster

Manual for the creature's stat block- the name of which

is given in bold in  the keyrune's description- unless

you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.

The creature is  friendly to you, your companions, and

other members of your guild (unless those guild mem

bers are hos tile to you). It understands your languages

and obeys your spoken commands. If you  issue no com

mands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves

to avoid danger.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each key

rune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to

its keyrune form.  It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points

or if you use an action to speak the command word

again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its

keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours

have passed.

Azorius Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from

white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of

prey. It can become a giant ea gle for up to  1 hour. While

the transformed eagle is within l  mile of you, you can

communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you

can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears

until the start of your next turn, and you gain the bene

fit of its keen s ight. During this time, you are deaf and

blind with regard to your own senses.

Boros Keyrune (Rare). Carved from  red sandstone

with white granite elements to resemble a  member of

the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a vete ran

(human) for up to 8  hours. In addition to fighting on

your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical ad

vice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the

transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily

recognize that it is an artificial human.

Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare). This keyrune, carved

from  black stone accented with steel, resembles a styl

ized horror. On command, it transforms into an inte llect

devourer that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with

six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours.

During that time, it pursues only a single mission you

give it- usually an assignment to take over someone's

body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time

or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission

is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its suc

cess, and reverts to its keyrune form.

Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare). Made from deep green

jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insecti le

shape. It can transform into a giant scorpion for up to

6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can

communicate with you telepathically while it is within

60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to

describing the passage of potential prey.

Gruul Keyrune (Rare). This crude keyrune is cobbled

together from  bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and an

imal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On com

mand, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned

creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same

statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for  1 hour.

Izzet Keyrun e (Rare). Formed of carved and pol

ished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of

cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head,

suggesting the jagged elemental form of the galvanice

weird (see chapter 6 for the s tat block) that it can be

come for a duration of 3 hours. In  this form, it will serve

you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a

test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other

way that its capabilities allow.

Orzhov Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from

white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped

like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On

command, the keyrune transforms into a winged thrull

(see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you

don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family,  it serves you

grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and man

nerisms while carrying out your orders.

Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon). This dark granite

keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with

the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When acti

vated, it transforms into a ca ckler (see chapter 6 for the

stat block) for up to 1 hour.

Selesnya Keyrune (Rare). Carved from wh ite a nd

green marble in  the shape of a wolf's head, this key

rune transforms into a dire wolf. The wolf persists for

8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish

and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is

within 1 mile of you. you can communicate with each

other telepathically.

Simic Keyrune (Uncommon). This keyrune is as

sembled from coral, mother-of-pearl, and chrome and

adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of

Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of

a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a

category 1 krasis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that

has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The

transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.

GUILD SIGNET

Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)

This ring, adorned with the symbol of a guild, allows

you  to cast one spell closely associated with that guild,

as shown in  the Guild Signet Spells table. A guild sig-

178

< llAl'llR

I REASURES

net is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose

renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a rewa rd  for

performing special services for  the guild. Aside from its

magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of the

guild's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 expended

charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend

1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).

ILLUSIO NIST'S BRACERS

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a

spel /caster)

A powerful illusionist of House Dimir originally devel

oped these bracers. which enabled her to create multiple

minor illusions at once. The bracers' power, though,

extends far beyond illusions.

While wearing the bracers. whenever you cast a can

trip, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to cast

that cantrip a second time.

MIZZI UM

Mizzium is  a magic-infused steel alloy used by the lzzet

League in  a tremendous variety of ways, from  providing

the physical structure of weirds to crafting the tools used

in other manufacturing.  Runic markings help to chan

nel and control the elemental energy that flows through

the metal.

The magical properties of the metal are difficult to de

fine succinctly. It is  as hard as adamantine, except when

it is  transformed into a gaseous suspension. It has a high

melting point, except when it is  found  in  liquid form  at

cool autumn temperatures.  lzzet chemisters can readily

explain that mizzium  helps to maxi mize metasteam  po

tentials, realize fractional  element-binding, and transduce

local weird-field  radicals, but no one understands what any

of that means.

MIZZIUM APPARATUS

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a

sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)

Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the

mages of the Izzet League engage in it. As protection

against the risk of an experiment going awry, they have

developed a device to help channel and control their

magic. This apparatus is a collection of leather straps,

flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates, bracers,

and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy

called mizzium, all assembled into a harness. The item

weighs 8 pounds.

While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you

can use it as an arcane focus.  In addition, you can

attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have

prepared. The spell you choose must be on your class's

spell list and of a level for which you  have a spell slot,

and you must provide the spell's components.

You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but

before resolving it you must make an Intelligence (Ar

cana) check. The DC is 10 +twice the level of the spell

slot you expend to cast the spell.

On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal,

using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability mod

ifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from

the one you  intended. Randomly determine the spell you

cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot

you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the

table for 5th-level spells.

If you  try to cast a cantrip you don't know,  the DC for

the Intelligence (Arcana) check is 10, and on a failed

check, there is no effect.

MIZZIUM ARMOR

Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), rare

This suit of armor is reinforced with a magically en

hanced metal alloy called mizzium, which is made in

Izzet foundries. While you're wearing the ar mor, any

critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.  Jn addi

tion, when you are subjected to a magical effect that

allows you to make a Strength or Constitution saving

throw to take only half damage, you instead take no

damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

MIZZIUM  MORTAR

Wondrous item, rare

This short tube, about 2 feet long and 6 inches in diame

ter, is made from  mizzium, a magically enhanced metal

metal can be seen at the other end as long as the mortar

has at least 1 charge remaining.

The mortar has 4 charges for the following properties.

fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on

a successful one.

Each time you use the pyroconverger, roll a dlO and

add the number of times you have used it since your last

long rest. If the total is l 1 or higher, the pyroconverger

malfunctions: you  take 4d6 fire damage, and you can't

use the pyroconverger again until you  finish a long rest.

RAKDOS  RITEKNIFE

Weapon (dagger),  legendary (requires attunement)

You gain a +l bonus to attack and damage rolls made

mental state. A cr eature that can see you and makes a

successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can discern

whether you are happy, sad, angry, disgusted, surprised,

or afraid, as well as the main source of that emotion.

For example, you might communicate fear caused by

a monster you just saw around the corner, grief at the

loss of a friend, or happiness derived from pride in your

performance in combat. A dark elf has advantage on

this check.

PARIAH'S  SHIELD

Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)

Soldiers of the Boros Legion consider it an  honor to

bear this shield, even  knowing that it might be the last

honor they receive. The front of the shield is sculpted to

depict a grieving human face.

You gain a +l  bonus to AC for every two allies within 5

feet of you (up to a maximum of +3) while you wield this

shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal

bonus to AC.

When a creature you can  see within 5 feet of you

takes damage, you can use your reaction to take

that damage, instead of the creature tak-

ing it. When you do so, the damage type

changes to  force.

CHAPTER 6:  FRIENDS AND  FOES

AVNICA IS HOME TO A GREAT VARIETY OF

creatures, including some that are unknown

on other worlds in  DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.

This chapter provides stat blocks fo r many

of these creatures, and it concludes with a collection

of nonplayer characters who fi ll  the ranks of Ravni

ca's guilds.

Some of the stat blocks in this book have a special

feature: guild spells. If a stat block says its creature is a

spellcaster of a particular guild- an Izzet spellcaster, for

instance- that creature's spell list includes one or more

spells  from  that gu ild's spell  list. See chapter 2 for the

guilds' lists.

C REATURES  BY  GUILD

This section is a  list of creatures in this chapter and in

the Monster Manual that are associated with each guild.

Each guild's entry includes a brief discussion of the

monsters from the Monster Manual that could be found

among the guild's members, a nd it includes a table

s howing monsters sorted by challenge rating.

Most of these monsters are in this book (GGR) or the

Monster Manual (MM),  but some of the monsters from

Volos Guide to Monsters (VGM) and Mordenkainens

Tome of Foes (MTF) are also mentioned.

AZORIUS  CREATURES

Most creatures associated with the Azorius Senate are

humanoids (largely humans and vedalken) and various

others that serve as familiars. pets, and mounts. Owls

are popular familiars, since they are viewed as symbols

of wisdom and sound judgment. Sphinxes and archons

are the rare non humanoids that play a significant role in

the leadership a nd operation of the guild.

Azori us lawmages craft one-eyed homunculi  to per

form menial  tasks in Azorius buildings. These homun

culi use the statistics of a regula r homunculus except

that they are wingless and have no flying speed.

S PH INXESOF j UDGMENT

Azorius sphinxes, known as sphinxes of judgment, wield

hieromancy- the power of law magic- with the force of

a judge's gavel  to imprison criminals and compel  truth

from  them. A sphinx of judgment is a gynosphinx, as

described in the Monster Manual, but it is an Azorius

spellcaster with the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will):  friends,  mage hand, message

1st level (4 s lots): command, ensnaring strike, shield

2nd level (3 s lots): calm emotions, hold person,

suggestion

3rd level (3 slots): clairvoyance, counterspe/1,

dispel magic

4th level (3 slots): banishment, divination

5th level (1  slot): dominate person

BOROS  CREATURES

The Boros Legion employs many different creatures to

swell the ranks of its soldiery. These creatures might

serve as companions, guardians, or mounts.

FLAME-K IN

Flame-kin (which  use the azer stat block in the Monster

Manual) are elemental soldiers magically created and

animated to serve the legion as scouts and shock troops.

Fanatical and inflexible, they are relics of a time when

the guild was more concerned with zealotry than jus

Alongside human and vampire spies and assassins, a va

GOLGA RI  CREATURES

The Devkarin e lves (drow), deadly medusas, and insec

tile krau t are the th ree most important power groups

among the Golgari S warm, vying for control over a

teeming horde of lesser (or at least less ambitious)

creatures.

ERSTWHILE

A significant shift in the Golgari balance of power be

gan when the kraut death priest Mazirek discovered an

ancient mausoleum compound. Deep in the undercity,

beneath the layers of civilization that had built up over

millennia, Mazirek found a hidden network of vaults

called Umerilek, an enormous structure that would

have dominated a city block. Inside were hundreds of

well-preserved corpses suffused with a latent necroman

tic power that Mazirek activated, bringing the corpses

back to a shambling semblance of life. This new race of

undead is called the Erstwhile (equivalent to the wight

in the Monster Manual).

In their time, the Erstwhile were aristocratic elves

of immense wealth and opulence. They still wear their

stately attire, despite its moldering condition, and they

lend an air of high culture to the undercity court of

the Golgari.

FUNGUS

Golgari territory is filled with creatures composed

of fungus and detritus from the guild's rot farms.

Shriekers serve as sentries in Gotgari tunnels, and vio

let fungus sprouts from  the corpses of intruders. Amor

phous masses of dead and decaying matter can develop

into shambling mounds in the spore-saturated environ

ment of the undercity.

Some Golgari creatures are symbiotic fusions of

fungus and living creatures. Golgari trolls are hulking

sewer dwellers with fungus adorning their bodies like

manes, acting as extra layers for  their already tough

hide and facilitating their regeneration.

INSECTS  AND ARACHNIDS

Beetles, centipedes, spiders, and countless other insects

and arachnids infest Golgari warrens. These creatures,

often associated with decay and rebirth, are prized by

the guild. Giant bugs serve as beasts of burden, compan

ions, steeds, a nd guardians. Among the largest of these

is the Deadbridge goliath beetle (equivalent to the tricer

atops in  the Monster Manual).

Piranha beetles {best represented as a swarm of in

sects, from  the Monster Manual) burrow through the

soft earth and gather into swarms to overtake their vic

tims and strip the Resh  from  them. Skein spiders (as gi

ant spiders, from the Monster Manual) are an important

part of Golgari reclamation work: fungus grows rapidly

along the silken spiderwebs, expanding to engulf archi

tecture and hasten the Golgari annexation process.

ZOMBIES

The guild encourages the use and exploration of necro

mancy. Fungus covers the bodies of most of the undead

that serve the guild, the majority of which are fungus

drudges (equivalent to zombies in the Monster Man

ua/)- mindless servants animated by the fungus that

infests their bodies.

GRUUL CREATURES

Many dangerous creatures haunt the rubblebelts and

other places the Gruul Clans inhabit.

BEASTS

Gruu I territory is full  of beasts of all sizes. Herds of gi

ant boars (see the Monster Manual) called batterboars

roam the rubblcbelts; each batterboar can grow to be

the size of a mammoth (as in the Monster Manual), and

the passage of a herd can shake the ground and topple

buildings. Maaka (use the saber-toothed tiger stat block

from the Monster Manual) are territorial cats, about 15

feet long, with six eyes. They typically keep to the rub

blebelts, though from time to time they are spotted amid

tended groves and gardens.

Any beast described in this book or in the Monster

Manual can roam the rubblebelts. The Gruul can bring

out the fury in these beasts. turning them into rage

beasts. Ragebeasts often have the Reckless and Siege

Monster traits:

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the ragebeast can gain advan

tage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn,

but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its

next turn.

lZZET CREATURES

Izzet laboratories are staffed with attendants (common

ers) and chemisters (mages). Pixies and sprites (called

ratchet faeries) find employment among the lzzet work

ing on projects that are too small for other races.

The lzzet League employs elementals formed from the

combination of two or more elemental forces, including

mephits of the smoke, steam. ice, and magma varieties.

Siege Monster. The ragebeast deals double damage to objects

and  structures.

ELEMENTALS

Gruu l shamans channel primal energies to summon

raging fire  elementals that blaze ahead of marauding

Gruu l bands. Or they transform the rubble and detritus

of civilization into earth elementals, twisted through

with choking vines. that literally give new life to the ruin

of the city. These elementals are intensely destructive,

but they last only as long as the magic used to summon

them persists.

GIANTS

Nearly all the Gruul Clans include hill giants. stone gi

ants, cyclopes. ogres, ettins, and fomorians among their

number, and one clan- the Bolrac clan- is composed

entirely of such brutes.

HYDRAS

Once a hydra chooses a lair and declares the surround

ing land its territory, it's almost impossible to drive the

creature out. The Gruul revere these multiheaded pred

ators as vestiges of the ancient times before the guilds

took over the world. They don't kill  hydras for trophies,

but pulling a spine from a hydra's neck is a mark of great

bravery among the Gruul.

The Selesnya Conclave uses its close connection to

nature to enlist a variety of creatures to its cause.

These supporters of the conclave take their rightful

place in  the natural order alongside its more human

like members.

ELEMENTALS

Elementals rise to the guild's defense when the Se

lesnya Conclave is drawn into conflict. Most of these

elementals are made from  the roots and branches of

trees, making them equivalent to awakened shrubs or

awakened trees. Earth elementals incorporate building

materials in their forms to serve as armor and weapons.

SIMIC  CREATURE S

Simic scientists a re interested in the ways that all life

forms adapt to their changing environments, but they

have a particular fascination with the la rgest creatures.

In a world covered with urban construction, most of

these creatures soar above the city or glide deep below

it in subterranean oceans accessible only through the

S imic zonots.

B ENTHIDS

Simic scientists use the term "benthid" to refer to the

leviathans of the deep. These creatures vary greatly in

size and morphology, so they might be represented by

the statistics for a giant octopus, plesiosaurus, killer

whale, giant shark, dragon turtle, or krakeo.

ME RFO L K

Ravnica's merfolk are unique to the Simic. They

emerged from  the depths of the plane's long-buried

oceans less than a century ago and immediately took on

leadership positions  in  the guild. They claim a deep con

nection to Ravnica's primal oceans, which are almost

untouched by civilization. They have the statistics of the

merfolk in  the Monster Manual, except that they speak

Common and Merfolk, and their legs give them a walk

ing speed of 30 feet.

GUILDLESS  CREATUR ES

A monster that doesn't appear on the tables in this sec

tion can show up in Ravnica. Other categories of crea

tures that exist in the world include the following:

Un dercity Denizens. Creatures that don't have clear

guild connections, such as carrion crawlers and

otyughs, creep and s link through the undercity.

Undead. Orzhov spirits and Golgari zombies are not

the extent of undead in Ravnica. Wherever people

die, there's a chance of them returning as revenants,

ghosts. or other forms of undead.

The Guildless. The nonplayer characters presented in

the Monster Manual and other sources can represent

aoy of the ordinary citizens of Ravnica, whether they

are connected to guilds or not. Commoners go about

their daily business, bandits prey on the weak, and

cultists lurk in shadowed shri nes. either hidden from

the guilds or beneath their notice.

Ordinary An imals . Virtually any of the creatures that

appear in appendix A of the Monster Manual could

show up in Ravnica . Many such creatures are con

fin ed to small greenbelts or the ruined rubblebelts,

but others thrive in the urban environment, including

birds. scavengers. and sewer dwellers .

ANGELS

Ravnican angels are physical manifestations of the

principles of justice and righteousness. Created in the

image of the founder of the Boros Legion, Razia, they

originally all served in the legion, but individual angels

embody different approaches to ideals of justice, duty,

law, and order. This diversity has caused some angels to

leave the Boros Legion; they might join other guilds or

remain independent, protecting the guildless.

Angels from Ravnica appear similar to human women

with two large feathered wings. Present-day angels have

the full  range of human height, weight, and coloration.

Some a re crowned or surrounded by a glowing nimbus

oflight, and others have hair like living flame.

Immortal Nature. Angels don't require air, food,

dri nk, or s leep.

BOROS ANGELS

Angels of the Boros Legion view themselves as the

embodiments of what their creator intended. They are

fierce warriors devoted to justice and dedicated to pro

tecting the weak against evil and oppression. They are

commanders, advisors, strategists, and soldiers. Their

presence in battle inspires the mortal soldiers of the le

gion with righteous zeal.

Most Boros soldiers assume that angels a re paragons

of goodness, wisdom, and mercy. The reality is that an

gels aren't immune to the temptations of corruption, and

the necessities of political machination can compromise

the best of them.

Warleaders. The wisest, most visionary angels are

responsible for forming and implementing the military

strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal,

their plans might span centuries, and they have been

known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost

for a more significant victory many years later. These

warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as

presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance

is similar to other Boros angels.

BATTLEFORCE ANGEL

Battleforce angels are the radiant hosts that soar into

combat, bathed in the light of Boros zeal. They lead

companies of mortal soldiers from above or fly ahead of

roe-mounted skyknights. They don't shy away from  the

blood, pain, and confusion of combat; rather, they im

merse themselves in the shifting tides of battle. Only by

wading into the battle can they fulfill their responsibility

to carry out the commands of the warleaders by adapt

ing their tactics to the shifting situation on the ground.

CHAPTER  6  I  FRIENDS  \);0 roi::s

FIREMANE  NEVENA

Chastised  by Aurelia after leading a successful assault

against a grou p of guildless  rebels, Nevena has distahced

herself from  the Boros  Legion's leadership and .inde

pendently pursues her own  vision of justice and punish

ment.  Nevena's willful  independence is a source of tension

among the firemanes as well  as in  the upper echelons of

the legion's leadership.  How much should a firemane be

free to pursue her own agenda, given that her agenda is

righteous and just?  For now, Aurelia  has decided to let

Nevena have an  unprecedented degree of freedom, but

if she betrays any hint of corruption, she will  quickly be

brought back under dose scrutiny.

fIREMANE ANGEL

Firemane angels are holy champions and paragons of

war who specialize in single combat. They are powerful

warriors who seek out the mightiest foes in any conflict,

trusting lesser soldiers to handle lesser opponents.

Like many other Boros angels, firemanes typically

have red hair. In the heat of battle, a firemane's hair can

ignite, transforming into a mane of flames cascading

over its shoulders and down its back.

0RZHOV ANGELS

Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption

and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate,

since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to

their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even im

mortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's

heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause

of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the

weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the an

gel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power.

Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners,

commanders, or power brokers, but more often they

carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart

from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.

It)!

D EAT H PACT  ANGEL

Death pact angels dwell in the grandest of Orzhov cathe

drals, where they surround themselves with wealth a nd

wretched vassals that a re utterly in their thrall.

Gift Givers. Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact

angel attracts  petitioners who beg the an gel for bless

ings: wealth, prestige,  health, revenge, and the like.

Imagining itself generous a nd  merciful, the angel us u

a lly tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using

its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extort

ing favors from other members of the guild. True to the

spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow

these gifts out of kind ness, but for the sake of gaining

fanatical followers who owe it life debts .

Debt and Indenture. T hose who receive favors from a

deathpact a ngel incur a debt that they carry with fervent

devotion. They regu larly bring trinkets and offerings

to the angel, no longer asking or expecting a nything in

return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for

their angelic patron. Even afte r death, these debtors

continue to serve the angel a nd the Orzhov Syndicate as

indentured spirits (described late r in  this chapter).

DEBTS  PAID

A deathpact angel can  give an indentured  spirit  a clause

to esca pe its bound servitude: if the angel ever dies, the

indentured  spirit can  sacrifice its undead  exi stence to

restore th e an gel  to life.  Upon seeing the angel drop to 0

hit  points,  an indentured  spirit ca n destroy itself, its  debt

discharged as it dissipates,  after which the angel returns to

life with 1 hit point.

ARCHON  OF THE

TRIUMVIRATE

Archons are enigmatic, supernatural embodiments of

the harshest aspects of law and order. They espouse

a rigid sense of justice and deal ruthless punish-

ment to those who break the law. This nature often

aligns them with the Azorius Senate, and they are

commonly seen circling above the Azorius guildhall

astride their winged felidar mounts, soaring alongside

griffon-mounted hussars.

An archon appears as an armored humanoid figure,

nearly always mounted. Its face is usually shadowed

beneath a large hood; those who have seen beneath the

hood describe a face of celestial beauty with a stern ex

pression and blank white eyes.

Eternal Riders . The bond between an archon and

its winged felidar mount is so close that the two are

sometimes considered a single being, acting with a

single mind. If an archon is ever thrown from its saddle,

it can magically return to its place astride its mount in

an instant.

Immortal Nature. An archon doesn't require food,

drink, or sleep.

laws that creature has broken  in the last 24  hours.

Innate Spellcasting.  The archon's innate spellcasting ability

is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks).

The archon can  innately cast the following spells, requiring no

material components:

At will: calm emotions, command, compelled duel

Mount. If the arch on isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action

to magically teleport onto the creature serving as its mount,

provided the archon and  its mount are on the same plane of

existence. When it teleports, the archon appears astride the

mount along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying.

While mounted and  not incapacitated, the archon can't be

surprised, and both it and its mount gain advantage on Dexter

ity saving throws.  If the archon  is reduced to 0 hit points while

riding its mount, the mount is reduced to 0 hit points as well.

ARCLIGHT PHOENIX

An arclight phoenix is variously said to be a byproduct

of a lightning strike on an aviary, a mishap in a n effort

to create a translocation device, or a successful attempt

to create an elemental creature in the form of a ma

jestic bird.

Whatever its origin, an arclight phoenix looks like a

bird of prey formed entirely of electrical energy. Light

ning fans out behind it as it bolts from place to place

through the sky, making up in speed what it lacks in

grace and majesty. It seems happiest during natural

thunderstorms, as it darts among the clouds, gliding

alongside thunderbolts.

Elemental Nature. An arclight phoenix doesn't

require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Flyby. The arclight phoenix doesn't provoke an opportunity at

tack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

Grounded Lightning. The first time on a turn that the arclight

phoenix touches the ground, it takes  11  (2d10) force damage.

Illumination. The arclight phoenix sheds bright light in a 1 S

foot radius and dim light for an  additional  15 feet.

Lightning Form. The arclight phoenix can move through a

space as  narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature

that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while

within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8)  lightning damage. In addition,

the arclight phoenix can  enter a hostile creature's space and

stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn,

that creature takes 9 (2d8)  lightning damage.

Crackling Death. When the arclight phoenix dies, it explodes.

Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18  Dexterity

saving throw, taking 36  (8d8)  lightning damage on a failed

save,  or half as much damage on a successful one. The explo

sion destroys the phoenix but leaves behind a Tiny, warm egg

with a mizzium shell.

The egg contains the embryo of a new arclight phoenix. It

hatches when it is in the area of a spell that deals lightning

damage, or if a creature touches the egg and expends spell

slots whose combined levels equal 13 or more. When it

hatches, the egg releases  a new arclight phoenix that appears

in the egg's space.

Arclight Touch.  Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach S ft.,

must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 27

CONCLAVE DRYAD

The lush forests that once grew on Ravnica are gone,

but the dryads remain, striving to bring the sprawling

city and the verdant green of nature into harmony.

Dryads believe that their efforts are the will of Mat'Sele

snya, the soul of the world, and they spread their teach

ings through every Selesnya enclave.

Thanks to their attunement to Mat'Selesnya, dryads

serve as visionaries and spiritual intermediaries for the

Selesnya Conclave. They hold positions of great respect

as spiritual leaders, and also share their vision of har

monious construction as architects, working with stone

masons and woodshapers to create Selesnya enclaves.

Summoned Mount. When leading its guild into battle,

a dryad rides a magically summoned creature woven of

within  1 mile of the mount, the dryad can communicate with  it

telepathically.

Suppress Magic (Recharge 5-6). The dryad targets o ne magic

item it can see within 120 feet of it. If the magic item isn't an

artifact, its magical properties are suppressed for 10 minutes,

until  the dryad is  incapacitated or dies, or un til the dryad uses

a bonus action to end the effect.

D EMONS

just as angels arc incarnations of the ideals of justice,

demons embody depraved impulses: selfish ness, cruelty,

hatred, greed, and lust for  power. Demons a re strongly

associated with the Cult of Rakdos; in  fact, the demons

of Ravnica might have been created by Rakdos in the

same way that angels were created by the Boros Le

gion's founde r. As a demon lord who has chosen to live

in Ravnica , Rakdos claims authority over all the demons

of this world- even if some of them, ambitious and head

s trong as demons are. rebel against his authority.

Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts

of terror in plain sight under the auspices of the Cult of

Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic perfor

mances that leave the audience members blood-soaked

but ecstatic. They incite mob riots  th.at raze entire city

blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself,

who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged.

Demonic "Devils.'' The creatures called "devils" in

Ravnica are minor demons akin to quasits. While the

larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust

and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical

and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult. Their mischie

vous antics cause disorde r and destruction out of pro

portion to the demons' small size.

Diabolic Demons. Many of the demons of Ravnica are

monstrous, winged creatures of human-like form. They

are best represented by the statistics of the nalfeshnee,

the shadow demon, or the vrock in the Monster Manual.

Demons associated with the Cult of Rakdos often have

fiery attacks that make them similar to barbed devils or

horned devils, except that they are demons. (They are

chaotic evil, they speak Abyssal and not Infernal, and

they lack Devil's Sight.)

CACKLER

Cacklers are s mall, jabbering jesters that spice up

Rakdos performances with their chaotic antics. Their

incessant cackling can ins pire uncontrollable laughter

by making everything- even the most horrifying spec

tacles- seem hilarious . Some cacklers excel at vocal

mimicry and pe rform as impressionists; others put their

sadistic bent to use by lurking in shadows and terrifying

passe rsby.  Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers

in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon

public figures.

MASTER O F  CRUELTIES

draws every eye to the demon and commands an audi

the demon performs, onlookers are drawn more and

more into the blood lust. Audiences clamor for more vio

compelled to partake in the indiscriminate killing.

Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius Senate

and form  bonds with high-ranking justiciars and min

GIANTS

Giants use their tremendous size and strength to ad

vance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros

L egion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning

soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul

Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.

BLOODFRAY G IANT

Giants in the Cult of Rakd os act as enforcers, bouncers,

and sometimes even pillars, holding the mobile plat

forms that serve as stages for Rakdos performances.

Like other members of the cult, giants thrill lo the vio

lence of those shows. Though they can seem entranced

by the horror unfolding on the stage. they react quickly

and brutally to any interruption of the performance.

GUARDIAN  G IANT

Most of the giants in the Boros L egion come from a sin

gle clan,  the Skorskal , that has long been at odds with

the Gruul Clans. These giants are guard s and gatekeep

ers, well represented in the Sun home Guard, as well as

powerful muscle supporting Boros missions.

Giants of the Skorskal clan are often assigned to

protect Boros garrisons and forts throughout Ravnica.

They are excellent sentinels. keen-eyed and vigilant, and

ser ve as living walls to protect smaller soldiers fighting

alongside them. Skorskal giants look much like enor

small heads.

ORZHOV GIANT

A few giants j oin the ranks of t he Or zhov Syndicate and

serve as guards, executioners, and thugs- t he muscle

of the gu ild. The presence of Orzhov giants in markets

and streets serves as an effective reminder for busi ness

owners to keep their payments up to date.

SUNDER SHAMAN

Gruul sunder shamans are angry giants that channel

their  rage into brutal attacks that deal overwhelming

damage to foes and structures alike.

These shamans sometimes lead hill giants and stone

giants that also live among t he Gr uul Clans. T hey are

occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and

ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban

development that encroaches on the wilds where they

once lived- not least because they have so much diffi

culty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in

destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage,

they w al k through buildings, trample people underfoot,

and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They of

ten armor themselves with pieces of bu ild ings and wield

columns or other architectural elements as clubs.

HORRORS

Terrifying evils stalk, Hy,  and scuttle in the dark corners

of Ravnica, from  the depths of the undercity to the black

est parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures

are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the

dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people.

All a re evil creatures with dim reason and preternatu

ral cunning.

At least three guilds have been known to compel

horrors into service. For House Oimir, horrors spread

fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassi

nations or kidnappings against well-protected targets.

For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are s imply one more

weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring

creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari

S warm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the

guild's territory.

House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The

Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari

Swarm uses skittering horrors.

H OR RORS  AND  MA DNESS

Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified.

You can represent this reality by using the madness

rules in  the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the

flying  horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow hor

ror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening

Presence, note that fact. At the e nd of the encounter,

have each character who failed at least one of those

saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On

a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a

character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon

Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how

many of the saving throws that character failed during

the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table.

CUSTOMIZING A  HORROR

Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly

in other characteristics. A particular horror's form

might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish,

insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror,

choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror,

or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Fea

tures table and once on the Secondary Features table

(or choose an option from each table). Add those fea

tures to the base creature.

PRIMARY  FEATURES

Avoidance. If the horror is  subjected to an effect that al

lows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage,

it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving

throw, and only  half damage if it fa ils.

no material components:

3/day: darkness

1/day each:fear (shadow horror and skittering horror

only), phantasmal killer (skittering  horror only)

Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from

a melee attack,  it can use its reaction to emit psychic

energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in  that area

takes 3 (1 d6)  psychic damage  (flying horror),  7 (2d6)

psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10  (3d6)  psychic

damage (skittering horror).

I N DEN T U R ED  SPIRIT

Those who die with unpaid debts to the Orzhov Syndi

cate don't get a repri eve. Instead, their spi rits serve the

syndicate until they have worked off their obligation.

Sometimes that means existing as an indentured spirit

for years or even millennia.

An indentured spirit is an incorporeal being draped

in ghostly black robes and a hood that hides whatever

face it might have. Chains are hung around its chest and

arms as a perpetual marker of its servitude.

0RZHOV SPI RITS

For the members of the Orzhov Syndicate, life as a spirit

after death can be a gift, or it can mean everlasting servi

tude. The process of separating the soul from  the body is

often willingly undergone by the heads of the oldest and

most respected families  of the Orzhov oligarchy, resulting

in  pampered spirits that think they can spend the rest

of eternity enjoying the spoils of their decadence. These

spirits begin their undead existence as ghosts and use the

ghost stat block in  the Monster Manual. Over time, how

ever, they tend to shed the nuances of their personalities

and become caricatures of their living selves, often turning

into specters,  as described in  the Monster Manual.

lZZET WEIRDS

Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments

intended to combine two opposing elemental types in

the hope of creating elementals that were more stable

than the norm and easier to control. As commonly

happens with lzzet experi ments, the outcome was the

exact opposite. Weirds a re even wilder a nd  more un pre

dictable tha n elementals of either of their component

elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian

creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of

their creators.

Eleme.ntal Nature. An lzzet weird doesn't require air,

food, drink, or sleep.

BLISTERCOIL WEIRD

A blistercoil  weird is an a nthropomorphic brute formed

from water and molten rock. It absorbs energy from

magical fi re, causing its oozelike body to increase in

size. During one disastrous experiment, Izzet research

ers observed a blistercoil weird expanding to fi ll a six

story works hop before it released all its excess energy in

an enormous explosion and returned to its origina l s ize.

the weird must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28

(8d6)  fire damage on a failed  save, or half as much damage on

a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in

the area that aren't being worn or carried. The weird's size then

becomes Medium.

Form of Fire and Water. The weird can  move through a space

as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  In  addition, the

weird  can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The

fi rst time the weird enters another creature's space on a turn,

that creature takes 5 (ldlO) fire damage and catches fire; until

someone takes an action to douse th e fi re, the burning creature

takes S (ldl 0)  fire damage at the star t of each of its turns.

Heated Body. A creature that touches the weird or hits it

with a melee attack while within S feet of it takes 5 (1 dlO)

fire damage.

Illumination. The weird sheds bright light in  a 30-foot rad ius

and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

ACTION S

Slam.  Melee  Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach  S ft.,  one target.

Hit:  7 (ld8 + 3)  bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage,

Amplify Lightning. Whenever a spell that deals lightning dam

age includes one or more fluxchargers  in its area, the spell

deals an extra 9 (2d8}  lightning damage.

ACTIONS

Arc  Lightning twice.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one tar

Arc Lightning.  Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 30 ft.,  one

target.  Hit: 16 (3d10}  lightning damage, and  lightning jumps

from  the target to one creature of the fluxcharger's choice that

it can see within 30 feet of the target. That second creature

must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13

(3d8) lightning damage. Hit or Miss: The fluxcharger takes  S

(ldlO)  force damage after resolving the attack.

FLUXCHARGE R

In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily

controlled, Izzet magcs tried binding elemental light

ning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the mag

ical alloy mizzium. The experiment was partly success

ful:  the resulting weird , a Auxcharger, doesn't explode

like some other weirds do, but it is more intelligent and

more headstrong than other weirds.

A ftuxcharger's mizzium frame is suggestive of an an

gel. A faceplate is meant to give it some personality, but

most people find its solemn expression and unblinking

stare more unnerving than relatable.

until the start of the weird's next turn.

GALVANICE WEIRD

GaJvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird

technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerfu l

stupidity, as guardians and laborers in lzzet workshops.

They combine a rigid body of elemental ice with a core

of lightning that animates them. If a galvanice weird

is destroyed, the ice shatters and lightning crackles

outward in a dangerous explosion. Still, most Izzet re

searchers find  that their usefulness outweighs this risk.

KRA SIS

In the deep sinkholes that serve as

laboratories and guildhalls for  the

Simic Combine,  biomancers employ

a combination of magic and scientific

method to create novel life forms. They coax new

morphologies from existing creatures or combine

traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the

creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique

creatures that can't reproduce. A few  multiply and be

come part of the guild's standard menagerie.

C REATI NG A  KRASIS

To create a krasis, choose the appropriate stat block:

category 1 (Medium), category 2 (Large), or category 3

(Huge). Then roll once on the Major Adaptations table

and once on the Minor Adaptations table (or choose

an option from each table) to determine its additional

characteristics. The potency of some adaptations varies

based on the category of the krasis, as indicated in  the

descriptions of those adaptations.

Just a few examples of krasis are the battering kra

sis (a fusion of hammerhead shark and a powerfully

built beast), the crocanura (a crocodile-frog), the

drakewing krasis (a lizard-drake), the teratosuchus (a

crocodile-crab), the shambleshark (a shark-crab), and

the sharktocrab (an improved shambleshark that in

cludes octopus elements as well).

NIGHTVEIL SPECTER

The Nightveil specters of Ravnica are hooded, undead

guardians that ride flying creatures called gloamwings.

They are fearsome agents of House Dimir, protecting

the territory and interests of that guild- particularly the

ighrveil, from which the specters get

neighborhood of

their name. Their work can include driving off people

who accidentally wander  too close to a secret rooftop

meeting, killing those who knowingly infiltrate Dimir

property,  and track ing those who have stolen guild

secr ets, then wiping those secrets from their victims'

minds to ensure that they are never shared.

Limite d Sentience. A Nightveil specter is created

when  the mind magic of House  Dimir erases a person's

identity, leaving a mind so broken it can no longer live.

Thus. Nightveil specters have no memory of their previ

ous lives, and they are just clever enough to follow their

orders with some amount of creativity. They pursue

their assigned tasks with fearless determination.

Gloamwing Mount. If a gloamwing is killed, its spec

ter becomes fixated on destroying those responsible. lf

the specter survives,  it can create a new gloamwing over

th e course of a month, during whi ch time the specter is

incapacitated.

A gloamwing's head is almost ratlike, with prominent

teeth, and its leathery skin is stretched tight over its

skull. where its eyes are empty sockets.  Its body is mot

tled with bony plates, and great wings stretch from its

shoulder s.

Undead Nature. A Nightveil specter and its gloam

wing mount don't require air. food, drink, or sleep.

N1vrx CYCLOPS

Cyclopes li ke those described in the Monster Manual

are found primarily among the Gruul Clans. They are

forces of nature, and even though they have occasionally

been recruited into the Boros Legion, they can never

truly be tamed.

Cyclopes serve the Izzet league as workshop guard

ians, personal protectors, and heavy laborers. Tbey

wear mizzium armor plating to minimize injuries from

laboratory mishaps, piston gauntlets to i ncrease thei r

strength for lifting and punching, and telescopic helmets

to minimize the shortcomings of their monocular  vision.

They are sometimes called monoclons or Nivix cyclo

pes, after the name of the Tzzet guildhall.

SKYJEK Roe

The aerial forces of the Boros L egion-skyknights who

fly alongside the angels- take to the air mounted on

Skyjek roes. These avians are named for the skyknights

who are also part of the Wojek L eague, called Skyj ek s.

From the backs of their roes, these mounted soldier s

carry out reconnaissance missions, bombard enemies

on the ground, and engage flying foes.

The shape of a Skyjek roe's body makes it relatively

easy to saddle and ride, and it is typically equipped with

armor plating on its head and chest.

Skyjek roes are headstrong and impulsive, but their

bravery makes them ideal mounts for the Boros knights.

WtNGD  T ... RULL

THRULLS

When the Orzhov Syndicate rips a

soul from its body to create a spirit, the

cast-off remains go to the fleshmages, who

use their necromantic magic to liquefy the

corpse and transform it into something useful.

These creations become thrulls, obedient slaves that

serve in  a variety of menial roles: laborers, messen

gers, beasts of burden, and even fashion accessories

for the elite. Whatever tasks they perform, they wear

faceplates forged from devalued coinage to conceal

their ghastly features.

Construct Nature. A thrull doesn't require air, food,

drink, or sleep.

SERVITOR TuRU LL

The most wretched of thrulls are the servitors, small

and slender, that serve as playthings for their Orzhov

masters. They run trivial errands, transport small items,

caper and dance, and keep their masters' expensive

robes from trailing on  the dirty street. They are utterly

loyal, lacking any concept of thinking for  themselves.

WIN GED THRULL

Winged thruUs are at once the most intelligent of Or

zhov thrulls (which isn't saying much), as well as the

smallest, most unobtrusive, and most mobile. They act

as messengers and spies for their Orzhov masters and

tend to mimic the mannerisms and movements of the

oligarchs they serve.

UNDERCITY MEDUSA

The medusas of Ravnica, often called gorgons, are a

monstrous race of creatures that appear superficially

similar to human women. In place of hair, a gorgon has

a writhing mass of black, serpentine cables, and its

hands are scaly claws.

The gaze of a medusa's glowing eyes causes  living

tissue to petrify. The transformation is ra pid, leaving

the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position

of abject fea r or agony- a fine trophy for the medusa's

macabre collection. The medusa must exe rt its will to

effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or

friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless.

This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of

power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with

their small numbers . Medusas command a significant

share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at

least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of

the entire guild at the moment.

Not all gorgons are so ambitious ; some prefer to sim

ply stalk the endless shadows of the undercity like hun

gry predators.

LUDMILLA, THE TUNNEL VIPER

Ludmi lla is the last surviving member of the Sisters of

Stone Death, the trio of power-hungry medusas who slew

Svogthir, the original gui ld master of the Golgari Swarm.

Ludmi ll a no longer has the collective power of her medusa

sisters, so she's  been forced  to lurk in  Ravnica's under

city, surrounded by hundreds of her petrified victims.

She d reams of one day reclaiming control of the Golgari

Swarm, or at least causing pain to its current guildmaster,

Jarad Vod  Savo  (whose own sister displaced the medusas

from their position).

Surprise Attack. During the first round of combat, the medusa

has advantage on attack rolls aga inst any creature that is sur

prised, and it deals an extra 10  (3d6) damage each time it hits

such a creature with an attack.

A CTIONS

Multiattack.  The med usa makes two claw attacks. It can also

use  Petrifying Gaze before or after making these attacks.

Claw. Melee  Weapon  Attack: +7 to hit,  reach 5 ft.,  one target.

Hit:  13  (2d8 + 4)  slashing damage.

Pet rifying Gaze. The medusa fixes  its gaze on one creature

with in 60 feet of it that it can see and that can see its eyes. The

ta rget must  make a  DC 14 Constitution saving throw.  If the

saving th row fa ils by 5 o r more, the creature is  instantly petri

fied . Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to

stone and is  restrained. The restrained creature must repeat

the saving throw at the end of its  next turn , becoming petrified

on a fa ilure o r ending the effect on a success. The petrification

lasts until the creature is  freed  by a greater restoration spell  or

similar magic.

VAMPIRES

Creatures of the  night, vampires are ageless undead

beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are

fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind

a facade of sophistication and sensuality.  Those who

sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious

than those who tear out their victims' throats with their

fangs; they just hide it better.

The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Mon

ster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and

abilities that those other vampires boast, but a lso lack

the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they

have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood

that s ustains their undead existence.

BLOOD  DRI NKER VAMP I RE

Plenty of blood dri nkers haunt Ravn ica's alleys and sew

ers, preying on those who are foolis h enough to leave

the relative safety of the crowds.

Orzhov Vampires. Vampires thrive in the Orzhov

Syndicate, where they can collect tithes and payments

from their debtors in  the form of blood. Their undead

nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the

oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of experienc

ing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast

to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities,

which a re almost uniformly cruel.

Blood Bond. Consuming a creature's blood creates

a sort of empathic bond that a llows the blood drinker

vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.

Multiattack. The vam pire  makes three melee attac ks,  only one

of which can be a bite attack.

Bite. Melee  Weapon  Attack: +7 to hit, reach  S ft.,  one willing

creature, or a creature that is grappled  by the vampi re,  incapac

itated, or restrained.  Hit:  7 (l d6 + 4)  piercing damage plus  7

(2d6)  necrotic damage.  If the target is  humanoid, it  must suc

ceed on a DC  15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the

vampire for  l  minute. While charmed in this way,  the target is

infatuated with the vampire.

The target's hit  point maximum  is  reduced by an amount

equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit

points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the tar

get fi nishes a long rest. The target dies  if its hit point maximum

is  red uced to 0.

Rapier.  Melee  Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach  S ft., one ta rget.

Hit: 8 (ld8 + 4)  piercing damage.

Unarmed Strike.  Melee  Weapon  Attack: +6 to hit, reach S ft.,

can also grapple the target  (escape DC 14)  if it is a creature and

the vampi re has a hand free.

RE ACTION S

Parry. The vam pire  adds  3 to  its AC against one melee attack

that would  hit it. To do so, the vampire must see t he attacker

and be wielding a melee weapon.

Innate Spe//casting (Psionics).  The vampire's innate spellcast

ing ability is  Intelligence  (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast

the following spells, requiring no components:

At will:  message

3/day each: charm person, hold person, mirror image, sleep

l/day each: gaseous form,  major image

Shadow Stealth. While in dim  light or darkness, the vampire

can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in  sunlight, the vampire has dis

advantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom  (Perception)

checks that rely on sight.

Multiattack. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which

can be a bite attack.

Bite.  Melee  Weapon  Attack: +6 to hit, reach  5 ft., one willing

creature, or a creature that is  grappled by the vampire, incapac

itated, or restrained. Hit:  7 (ld6 + 4)  piercing damage plus  7

(2d6)  necrotic damage.

The target's hit point maximum is  reduced by an amount

equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit

points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the tar

get finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum

is reduced to 0.

Unarmed Strike.  Melee  Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach  5 ft.,

one target.  Hit: 8 (ld8 + 4)  bludgeoning damage. The vampire

can also grapple the target  (escape DC 13)  if it is a creature and

the vampire has a hand free.

Mind Siphon  (Recharge 5-6). The vampire targets a creature

it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14

Intelligence saving throw, with disadvantage if the vampire

has previously consumed the target's blood. On a fa iled save,

the target takes 28 (8d6)  psychic damage, and the vampire

discerns the target's surface emotions and thoughts. On a

successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the

vampire discerns the target's general emotional state but not

its thoughts.

MIND  DRINKER V A MPIRE

When vampires join House Dimir, they can learn to si

phon mental energy and memories along with the blood

of their victims. They also study the magic favored by

Dimir mind mages, giving them a powerful combination

of abilities ideal for espionage and infiltration.

Szadek's Heirs. The founder of House Dimir, Szadek,

was the first of the so-called mind drinkers. His secrets

are passed on only to other members of his guild, and

mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies

of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits

mind drinkers from  feeding on others of their kind.

CeJJ Leaders. Thanks to their particular gifts. mind

drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of

covert Dimir operatives. They rarely trust their own

agents, thoug h, and often follow their cell members to

make sure those members carry out missions as or

dered. T he most suspicious vampi res might even siphon

thoughts from their subordinates to detect any hint

of betrayal.

WURM

Wurms are huge creatures that re

semble limbless, wingless dragons.

They burrow through the earth and eat

virtually anything they come across,

and their movement accounts for much

of the destruction in the rubblebelt regions

of Ravnica.

A wurm burrows through loose earth by using deep

son ic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it and

swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes

behind it. Moving through rock is slower and more diffi

cult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in its wake.

The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms

can create, and the clans sometimes lure them into civi

lized areas where the destruction can be vast.

throw or be swallowed by the wurm. A swallowed creature is

blinded and restrained , has total cover against attacks and

other effects outside the wurm, and takes 17  (Sd6) acid dam

age at th e start of each of the wurm 's turns.

If the wurm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn  from

a creature insid e it,  the wurm must succeed on a  DC  21  Con

stitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all

swallowed creatures, which fall  prone in a space within  10 feet

of the wurm. If the wurm dies, a swallowed creature is no lon

NPCs BY GurLn

This section describes various nonplayer characters

that belong to each guild. These characters can serve

as enemies, rivals, allies, or contacts. In addition to the

NPCs presented here, you can customize the NPCs in

the Monster Manual and other sources to make them

feel like part of a particular guild.

Also included in this chapter are statistics and de

scriptions of the guildmasters of Ravnica. Without

exception, these are powerful creatures. In most cam

paigns, the guild masters will come into play more often

in negotiations and other social settings than in combat.

Thus, each guildmaster's ideals, bonds, and flaws are

included. As a general rule, a guildmaster's personal

agenda is in  line with the guild's goals described in

chapter 2, so the guild entries there provide additional

direction for roleplaying these individuals .

Several other named guild members are highlighted

SUPREME J UDGE l SPERIA

lsperia is the current guild master of the Azorius Senate.

As a sphinx, she is aloof and values solitude above all.

However, she has been forced to give up her privacy to

deal with the increased crime and chaos on Ravnica.

Isperia is devoted to her guild's belief that law is the

ultimate bulwark against chaos, and it is her steady

hand that guides the Azorius through these uncertain

times. As guildmaster, lsperia serves as the supreme

judge, a role that takes advantage of her encyclopedic

knowledge of Ravnica's labyrinthine legal system.

If an encounter turns violent, lsperia refrains

from  using lethal force if possible, preferring to sub

due a wrongdoing so that the legal system can mete

out justice.

I SP E RIA'S TRAITS

Ideal: "The law provides direction for every arena of life;

it is the only compass 1 need.''

Bond: "I can't stand by and watch disorder spread

through the city. Without the Azorius, Ravnica

would collapse. In the absence of order, we must es

tablish it."

Flaw: "If Ravnica didn't need me, I would prefer to live a

life of solitude and contemplation."

LAWMAGE

The Azorius Senate has spellcasters who are trained to

capture lawbreakers and bring them to justice. A law

mage's magic is focused on restraining criminals and on

protecting bystanders from becoming casualties when

arresters are pursuing malefactors. A significant propor

tion of the guild's vedalken are lawmages.

PRECOGNITIVE  M AGE

Precognitive mages, a rarity among Azorius spellcast

ers, are capable of capturing glimpses of the future.

They are typically employed to anticipate the actions of

wanted criminals. thus aiding in  their capture.

a teenager, she was apprehended and then pardoned in

exchange for agreeing to use her talents in the service of

complete anonymity,  her gifts  unappreciated.  But with the

senate displaying an increased interest in  the talents of

precognitive mages, Geetra has been given a more prom

inent position, which she has embraced with enthusiasm.

She worries about the impact that her guild has on the rest

of Ravnica  but believes in her heart that she is  helpi ng the

people. Chaos can only destroy, and her visions are a tool

to ensure that society can live  in  safety in all va riants of

W A R LEADER AUR ELIA

The angel Aurelia leads the Boros Legion. During the

years of her leadership, she has shown a strong appre

ciation for the ordinary citizens who are often caught in

the middle of interguild violence.

True justice. Aurelia argues, isn't merely the enforce

ment of the letter of existing laws {let the Azorius fret

over that), but the establishment of equitable and com

passionate relationships among all of Ravnica's people.

That means protecting the weak from the depredations

of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threat

ened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law

doesn't become oppressive. Aur elia actively supports

efforts to establ ish a lasting peace among the guilds in

the absence of the Guildpact.

them. Many reckoners are minotaurs.

GoLGARI NPCs

In its embrace of death and its claim over fetid, rotting

environments, the Golgari Swarm appeals to those who

are comfortable in a world of fungus, rot, and monsters.

Every member of the Golgari Swarm has a func-

tion, working together like the parts of a single, larger

organism. At the same time, internal factions vie for

authority. The most prominent faction is the Devkarin

elves, whose spiritual leader, Izoni, is no friend of the

guild master, Jarad. The medusas are still struggling

to coalesce as a faction. The kraut are slowly gaining

more influence in the guild under the leadership of the

death priest, Mazirek. These faction  leaders can serve

as patrons for Golgari characters. They might send char

acters on missions to interfere with a rival or to increase

the power and influence of their own faction. They can

also serve as major adversaries for adventurers who op

pose the Golgari Swarm.

Golgari NPCs include reclaimers, who scavenge and

recycle corpses and other detritus, and assassins, who

belong to a secret society called the Och ran. The Gol

gari NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild.

Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Man

ual unless the table states otherwise.

the cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud

when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution sav

ing throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed

save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10

(3d6) poison damage.

Tendrils of creeping fungi reach out to ensnare

the enemies of the Golgari. The Golgari choose a

15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 60

feet of any member of the group. Each creatur e in

the area that isn't allied with the Golgari group must

succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become

restrained until the Golgari group uses this lai r action

again, all the members of the group are slain, or no

member of the group is within 60 feet of the effect. A

creature restrained in this way can  use an action to

make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the restrained

effect on itself with a success.

REGIONAL EFFECTS

The region containing a Golgari lair is infested with

mosses and strange fungi. This habitat accounts for one

or both of the following effects in the surrounding un

dercity (the effects don't spread  to the surface):

Moss, fungi, and other growth covers every under

ground surface with in half a mile of the lai r.

Fungal spores drifting throughout the lair have the

power to animate corpses. Whenever a Small or Me

dium humanoid dies within the lair, roll a die. On an

odd number, the dead creature rises up as a fungus

drudge (use the zombie stat block in the Monster Man

ual)  ld8 hours later, unless its body is destroyed.

If all the Golgari in the lair die, the r egional effects

fade over ldlO days.

GO LGA RI  SHAMAN

Golgari shamans are the spiritual leaders of the Golgari

Swarm. They teach the guild's beliefs about the cycles of

nature,  using their necromantic magic to show how life

sprouts from death.

Golgari shamans paint their faces so they appear

to have extra eyes on their cheeks and chins. They

sometimes use magical mood mark paint (described  in

chapter 5) to allow them to communicate by means of

these marks. T hey wear clothing adorned with beetle

carapaces, spiderwebs, or shelf fungus.

NIKYA OF THE OLD WAYS

The Zhur-Taa leader,  Nikya, is a powerful centaur druid of

the Old Ways.  In fact,  she considers herself to be the last

of the true Gruul druids. Though raised to be a warrior,

Nikya soon discovered her natural gifts with magic. She

can  summon enormous constricting vines from the an

cient layers  of Ravnica's crust.  She has little love for Borbo

rygmos, and she believes th at another leader- one who is

loyal to the Old Ways-will arise among the Gruul before

the  End-Raze begins.

DRUID  OF THE  OLD WAYS

The druids of the Old Ways are the keepers of ancient

Gruul traditions devoted to the primal ferocity of ani

mal gods such as Ilharg the Raze-Boar and Kashath

the Stalker.

The End-Raze. The druids of the Old Ways believe

that civilization will  never be eradicated by scattered

raids and petty skirmishes. They cli ng to the idea of a

coming apocalypse, the End-Raze. when llharg's hoofs

will trample every brick and s tone of Ravnica's soaring

s kylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of na

ture in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery

will reign once again.

RUBBLEBELT STALKER

Rubblebelt stalkers are scouts and skirmishers for the

Gruul Clans. They excel at moving over challenging ter

rain, whether they're picking their way through treach

erous ruins or clambering across rooftops. They favor

ambush tactics and avoid confrontations with stronger

forces, relying on  their superior mobility to make

their escape.

GRuuLNPCs

Like the creatures that fight alongside them, warriors

and shamans of the Gruul Clans are wildly aggressive.

True to their name, the Gruul Clans include a number

of different groups with their own leaders and tradi

tions. Beyond the s ix most prominent clans (the Burning

Tree, the Ghor, the Scab, the S lizt, the Gravel Hide,  the

Zhur-Taa, and the Bolrac), countless small clans-some

little more than war bands- claim territories throughout

the rubblebelts.

Gruul NPCs fill  various clan roles. The Gruul NPCs

table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics

for these NPCs are found  in the Monster Manual unless

the table states otherwise.

BORBORYGMOS

For decades, the enormous cyclops Borborygmos has

comma nded the respect and obedience of the Gruul

Clans by defeating a ll  who challenged him. He embod

ies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their

bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica

knows no bounds.

Mightiest of the Mighty. Borborygmos leads the

Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most di

verse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accom

panied by other members of his clan- not because he

needs their protection, but because they might need his .

His companions include creatures ranging from  burly

giants to cowering goblins.

The Gruul follow strength, and  Borborygmos holds

his position only because he has proved stronger than

any challenger.

IzzET NPCs

Though the lzzet League officially serves the function

of maintaining the city's public works, most of its mem

bers join the guild to indulge their insatiable curiosity

for  magical knowledge. Using the guild's extensive re

sources and sturdy facilities, researchers pursue their

studies through reckless experimentation, which often

ends in destruction of property. loss of limb, or at the

very least, a  loud  boom. Nearly all Izzet members have

some capability with magic.

Izzet NPCs include chemisters, who work extensively

with the magic alloy mizzium, and their attendants. The

Izzet NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild.

Statistics for these NPCs are found  in  the Monster Man

MASTER  C H EM IS T ER  GROZCROX

Master Chemister Grozgrox is a viashino (lizardfolk)  mage

with a talent for  shaping mizzium. His genius has earned

commendations from  Niv-Mizzet himself on two separate

occasions, a fact  that Grozgrox tries to work  into conversa

tion as often as possible.

NIV- MIZZ ET

Possessed of arrogance and vanity that matches his vast

intellect and tremendous power, Niv-Mizzet is the an

cient dragon who founded and continues to control the

Izzet League. From his private laboratory at the top of

the lzzet guildhall, Niv-Mizzet directs the research and

experiments of his countless underlings. He coordinates

a tremendous number of apparently unrelated projects,

working toward some mysterious end.

There can be little doubt that this ancient dragon is

one of the most intelligem beings on Ravnica and one

of the world's most powerful spellcasters. He is j ust as

acquisitive as any dragon, but his treasure is scientific

and magical knowledge. His ambition is a looming

threat in the minds of all  the other guildmasters, but

confronting him directly is a lmost unthinkable thanks

to the combination of his awesome magical power and

the sheer physical threat of a fire-breathing, sword

toothed dragon.

Nrv- M1zzET's TRAITS

Ideal: "Innovation. Don'tjust have an idea- have

Bond: 'J have spent more than ten  thousand years re

Flaw: '"I  find  it  tedious to converse with simpletons who

lack vision."

BLASTSEEKERS

While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weap

ons, and other devices for the guild to use. the role of

a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite

the name, not all such devices produce explosions,

but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet per

spective) do.

0RZHOVNPCs

Every person in  the Orzhov Syndicate, living or dead,

has a place in the guild's rigid hierarchy. From the

undead spirits that make up the ruling Obzedat to the

lowly undead borrower spirits at the bottom, along with

the ranks of the living in  between, everyone knows

where they stand: who is above them, who is below

them, who owes them, and whom they owe.

The Orzhov hierarchy includes advokists who find

loopholes in the law to exploit, knights who enforce the

guild's will, and indentured spirits. The Orzhov NPCs

table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statjstics

for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless

the table states otherwise.

0BZEDAT,  THE  GHOST COUNCIL

The ghosts who make up the Obzedat are traditionally

called patriarchs, though they can be male or female.

They are the oldest, wealthiest, and most influential

oligarchs of the Orzhov Syndicate. They have been dead

for centuries, but they refuse to let go of the fortunes

they amassed in  life. Addicted to power and prestige,

these patriarchs continue to dominate the guild and ac

cumulate even larger fortunes.

Mostly Unanimous. The ghosts of the Obzedat func

tion  as a unit, driven by their shared desire to accumu

late ever more wealth for  the gujld. In  times of disagree

ment, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to

bend the council to his will.

Grandfather Karlov. The head of the council, who

gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties

within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In

life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and

his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his

hunger for more wealth.

Undead Nature. An Obzedat ghost doesn't require

air, food, drink, or s leep.

TuE  GHOST COUNCIL'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Influence is measured in  power, status, and

money, but mostly money."

Bon d: "Gather as much as you can while you can, for

when you die, you will take it with you."

Flaw: "Everyone has a price."

T EYSA  KAR LO V

Under the authority of the Obzedat, Teysa  Karlov (a  mage

with access to Orzhov guild spells)  formerly held the title

of grand envoy, serving as the representative of the Orzhov

when interaction with the leadership of other guilds was

necessary. A defining characteristic of the Orzhov for de

cades was  the tension between Teysa,  living in the complex

political realities of the world, and the inflexible, avaricious

Obzedat. Teysa  argued strenuously that the Obzedat's

isolationism and their reluctance to forge alliances that

could make them reliant on other guilds would lead to the

syndicate's downfall.

That tension  reached  its boiling point when Teysa  en-

listed the help ofTajic,  Blade of the Boros legion, in an

attempt to seize power from the Obzedat.  Her attempt

failed, and the Obzedat imprisoned Teysa, eliminated the

role of grand envoy,  and canceled all dealings with other

guilds. Teysa  remains in prison to this day, and the Ghost

Council extorts corrupt officials to make sure they keep her

locked away.

R AKDOS  NPCs

The Cult of Rakdos attracts thrill seekers. Some of its

members are lured by promises of hedonistic pleasure;

others are drawn l ike moths to the spectacle of the fiery

stage. They come to join a twisted community where no

impulse is unacceptable, no act is too vile, and all that

matters is the excitement and pleasure of the moment.

They come for a chance at the spotlight- some slim

hope of fame, even if it is the infamy of going down in

flames. And they come for fellowship, an easy compan

ionship without the earnest spirituality of the Selesnya,

the regimented discipline of the Boros. or the hierarchy

of the Orzhov.

Not every member of the guild is a performer; some

members simply tag along to witness the guild's may

hem. The Rakdos NPCs table summarizes key roles

within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in

the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

RAKDOS

Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embod

ies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer,

whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance

art. A monstrous fi gure standing thirty fee t tall, spread

ing enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging

a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His

every entrance is a showstopper.

Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches

to witness the performances of those who adore him. To

them , his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is

a demanding spectator.  He has seen  thousands of years

of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who

don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more

than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close.

jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances

only rarely. H e often retreats into his lair below the cult's

guildhall for months or years at a time,  but his followers

know that he might emerge at any time to witness the

latest spectacle.

RAKDOs's TRAITS

Ideal: "Everyone should pursue their gr eatest desire."

Bond: "If you want my favor, show me a performance

I've never seen before."

Flaw: "What is joy?"

BLOOD WITCH

Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermedi

aries between Rakdos and his cult- the pinnacle of his

priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers

who communicate his will to the scattered  troupes

and ringmasters. T he Cult of Rakdos recognizes no

authority but Rakdos, and the demon lord r equires no

advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart.

charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry

some weight.

Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from

external interference and to punish those who bring

harm to the guild. T hey claim grandiose titles, such as

Tormentor of the Wojek , as a way of mocking their in

tended victims.

RAKDOS  LAMPOONER

One of the most effective weapons in the Rakdos cult's

arsenal is satire, and a Rakdos lampooner  is a virtuoso

of that art. Lampooners generally reserve their  mockery

for people and guilds that have seized an outsized mea

sure of power, those who need to be taken down a peg,

rather than piling further humiliation onto those who

are already struggling. They use masks, marionettes, or

effigies to caricature public figures, or sometimes play

pranks on  those individuals directly in the streets.

RAKDOS  PERFORMER

By offering a place for those of many different talents,

the Cult of Rakdos has seen its numbers swell with

performing artists, including blade jugglers, fire eaters,

and high wire acrobats. Performers carry the message

of Rakdos out into the streets: cut loose, free yourself

from the bonds of society's mores and expectations, and

indulge your desires.

JUDITH ,  THE  SCOURGE  DIVA

Judith appears at Rakdos clubs and street shows as a

singer and performance artist, combining dark soliloquies

and bizarre pain stunts. She's the grande dame of the

Rakdos, and what she says backstage goes.

Jud ith covets the adoration heaped on Rakdos by his

cultists. She does countless performances a week, but the

big demon gets all the praise. She has begun to assemble

a small  entourage of fans,  toadies, and understudies who

echo  her complaints about the guild's leader.

RAKDOS  CARNIVAL

As lumbering giants put up makeshift stages and cack

ling devils ignite the footlights, the first performers be

gin to gather the crowds. Exuberant music with erratic

rhythms draws spectators from the surrounding neigh

borhood. and cheers of approval greet the more accom

plished performers- along with gasps a nd shrieks as

the acts get more risky and the fi rs t blood is drawn. Ac

robats cavort through the streets while sword swallow

ers and knife throwers  flash bright steel. The crowd gets

larger and wilder,  the shouts and screams get louder, the

fires burn brighter, and blood glistens red  in the torch

light. The spectacle is gruesome but captivating; the

crowd hates to watch but can't look away. Soon madness

takes them, a nd  they- devils and ogres, acrobats and

spectators- a re caught up in a  fre nzy of violence. Only

when it is over does the horror of the event sink in.

A Rakdos carnival is more than the sum of its per

formers and its a udience. It is a frenzy that grips those

present, a fiendish  madness that comes on suddenly

and departs just as quickly, leaving gore in its wake. The

carnival, in  fact, has a life of its own-and when adven

turers face the Cult of Rakdos in the midst of a revel, the

carnival  is one more foe arrayed against them.

When at least six Rakdos performers perform to

gether in public, they can call on the carnival to aid

them. When determining the difficulty of such an en

counte r, consider the carnival to be one additional crea

ture of challenge rating 3.

LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the car

nival takes a lair action, causing one of the following

effects; the carnival can't use the same effect two

rounds in a row:

<.II  \l'Tr R  ,

I  l<l l'Clli  l>S  ANO  I 01 S

Fire erupts from the ground at up to four points of the

DM's choice in the carnival. The fire lasts for 1 minute

or until this action is used again. Each jet of flame is

a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a  5-foot radius. Each crea

ture in the cylinder when it first appears  must make

a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

successful one. Any creature that starts its turn in the

flames must also make the saving throw.

Whirling blades, spiked chains. or other implements

of agony appear for a moment to menace ld6 random

creatures in  a 20-foot cube. Each target must succeed

on a  DC  15  Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8)

force damage.

Blood splashes all creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere

centered on a point within the ca rnival. Each creature

in that area becomes the target of a confusion spell

(save DC 15).

REGIONAL EFFECTS

The carnival exerts a powerful influence over those who

come close to the festivities:

When a creature that is outside the carnival sees or

hears it. the creature must succeed on a  DC  15 Wis

dom saving throw or use its movement each round

to move toward the carnival. It can repeat the saving

throw at the end of each of its turns. ending the effect

on a success. On a successful save, the creature be

comes immune to this effect for  24 hours.

If a creature attempts to leave the carnival.  the crea

ture must make a DC  15 Charisma saving throw. On

a failed save, the creature instead moves toward the

center of the carnival.  On a successful save, the crea

ture becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.

If all  the Ra kdos performers in  the carnival die or

leave its area, these effects end immediately.

SELESNYA NPCs

mission of inclusion and harmony appealing. They gain

comfort and fulfillment from the guild's peaceful coex

guild's drive isn't only to draw people into a peaceable

community: the Selesnya aim to build an army. They ar

TROSTANI

The Selesnya guildmaster is an amalgamation of three

dryads in body, will, and soul. Each dryad's body ex

tends from a central trunk, so while they possess inde

pendent minds. they share a single name-Trostani

and a single life force.  Usually Trostani communicates

the will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but sbe retains

three distinct personalities that embody the three parts

of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, and harmony. In the

midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three per

sonalities have recently been at odds over how best to

navigate the conclave through such difficult times.

Curiosity about the manifold wonders of life-as well

as the magical science involved in  modifying it- leads

inquisitive and ambitious minds from across Ravnica to

join the Simic Combine. Grouped together in clades and

projects, Simic scientists look for  new ways to speed the

nature's processes of adaptation and evolution, prepar

ing organisms of all kinds that can thrive in the danger

ous and ever-changing urban environment.

Most Simic researchers are humans, vedalken, elves,

and merfolk, or at least they were born that way. During

their careers, they might give themselves such a wide

variety of adaptations and augmentations that their her

itage is hard to ascertain. The Simic NPCs table sum

marizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these

NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table

states otherwise.

PRIME SPEAKER ZEGANA

The regal and reticent Prime Speaker Zegana is the

merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She up

holds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian

philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in

which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance.

Some people in the guild- members of the Adaptationist

faction in particular-argue that her ways are outdated

and the guild requires more practical leadership. In

response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime

speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Cham

ber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they

are certainly within their rights to do so.

ZEGANA'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Nature's patterns are the schematics for how

to improve."

Bond: "I will use all the resources at my disposal to see

that Ravnica becomes the best it can be."

Flaw: "I can't understand how progress could ever be

the wrong goal."

BIOMANCER

Nearly all the innovation and advancement in Simic bio

engineering comes from the work of biomancers. Spe

cialists in hybridizing and altering creatures through a

mixture of science and magic, they have spawned count

less hybrids and krasis in search of the perfect union

between nature and civilization.
