Introduction

The raging red eye wept hellre tears.

Aedwar, called He of the Steely Heart, gazed into

the heart of the inferno. The fiery portal returned

the lookundaunted, uncaring.

Chanting  fiends  surrounded  and  bolstered  the

portals appalling intrusion. Summoned by the Dire

Cabal, the demons were immune to the threats of

mortal  steel  and  magic.  With  each  syllable  they

repeated, the searing aperture yawned wider.

But Aedwar had something that the Dire Cabal

had not reckoned on.

He of the Steely Heart flipped back his cloak,

revealed in grip a dull black blade, scribed with

runes  of  grim  promise.  Once  a  blade  of  storied

guile  and  soul-swallowing  repute,  it  was  now  a

blade redeemed.

It was Exordius.

White light streamed from Exordiuss edges, and

rays of brilliant clarity ooded from the jewel in

its pommel. The demons inched, and their chant

faltered, but resumed a moment later. After all, what

need  had  they  to  fear  a  mortal  blade?  While  they

maintained their rite, they were immune to the cuts

and insults of all weapons, even those consecrated

by the powers of good.

But the dull black blade had a legacy behind it, a

convoluted story of loss and gain, transformation and

redemption. Exordiuss powers were not conned to

the merely mortal, or even the merely good.

Aedwar waded in, and as the slaughter began, the

dull black blade began to glow as it drank in the lives

of the foulest spirits of the Abyss.

Such is the power of a weapon of legacy.

MORE THAN

MEETS THE EYE

Mythic history is replete with tales of singular weapons

of legendary champions, magic staffs of remarkable

heritage, and rings that grant powers undreamed by

most  mortals.  Such  wonders  stand  in  ability  as  far

above standard magic items as a magic item surpasses its

mundane counterpart. A ring of feather falling is a handy

thing to have, but few would not give it up for Bright

Evening Star, whose radiance illuminates the darkness

and sears its enemies. And who wouldnt trade a +1

crossbow for the chance to wield Flamecasters Bolt, that

storied weapon prized for its lethal sway over re?

Finding these items of legacy, forged in the heat of

momentous events and wielded by legendary heroes,

is just the rst step. Prospective wielders must also

learn how to unlock their powers before using them

to their fullest capacity.

WHATS INSIDE

Weapons of Legacy describes magic items that are more

than what they seem, granting great power to those

who can discover their nature.

The rst chapters present the basic rules for items

of legacy, as well as information for adding them to

your campaign. They also detail a variety of options

available to characters who wield legacy items, from

feats to spells to a new prestige class.

The  book  then  offers  forty-nine  fully  detailed

items of legacy, including swords, staffs, and won-

drous items. Full histories of each item are included,

along with rituals to unlock their mysterious powers

and adventure seeds to introduce them to a cam-

paign. Sections on tailoring the items to a FORGOTTEN

REALMS or EBERRON campaign are also provided in

many cases.

DMs and players then learn how to create cus-

tomized  items  of  legacy  as  their  characters  and

campaigns  evolve,  as  well  as  explore  a  range  of

variants on the legacy item rules, such as mutable

legacies, epic legacy items, and even monsters that

embody legacy abilities.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Weapons of Legacy is intended for use in any DUNGEONS

&  DRAGONS  game.  You  will  need  the  three  D&D

core rulebooksPlayers Handbook, Dungeon Masters

Guide, and Monster Manual. In addition, it includes

references to material in the Epic Level Handbook,

the Expanded Psionics Handbook, Complete Adventurer,

Complete Warrior, and Races of the Wild, among other

supplements. Although possession of any or all these

supplements will enhance your enjoyment of this

book, they are not strictly necessary.

fter thousands of years of epic history over

an  innite  and  expanding  stage  of  worlds

and  planes,  certain  stories  still  resound

with mythical signicance. Of those, tales

of mighty weapons, relics of exceptional power, and

artifacts of previous civilizations are especially potent.

Who doesnt thrill to the tale of Excalibur, the sword

that can be drawn from the stone only by one worthy

to rule? All shudder to think on the soul-drinking

blade Stormbringer, and the price that its wielder must

pay. So, too, do we read in awe of the One Ring, with

its ability to confer on the wearer powers so vast that

only those of already exceptional ability can unlock

the rings potential.

These are weapons of legacy. Many are items crafted

in  a  long-ago  age  when  legends  walked  the  mortal

world.  These  mighty  tools  have  since  been  lost,

secreted away, or destroyed, so that now they are no

longer within the reach of mortals.

Perhaps they are still among us, but unrecognized as

the mighty relics once hailed throughout the lands.

The world also holds new heroes, who are creat-

ing new legends and forging new items of legacy

in their telling.

WHAT IS A WEAPON

OF LEGACY?

Weapon of legacy describes all the items cre-

ated  using  the  rules  in  this  book,  even  those

that wouldnt normally be described as weapons

(such  as  rings  or  shields).  Usually,  this  book

uses the more general term item of legacy or

legacy item.

An item of legacy has the capacity to grow in

power as its wielder advances in level. In addi-

tion, it confers increasingly powerful special

abilities on its wielder. That character might

carry  and  treasure  the  same  item  over  her

entire career as a hero (or villain). Why not?

As her own talents and abilities progress, so

too do those of the legacy item, assuming the

wielder takes the time to learn its complete

history and awaken its quiescent power with

the appropriate rituals.

As a player character, you could discover

or inherit an item of legacy. Initially, it might

seem  like  nothing  more  than  a  standard

magic item. Only when you learn something

5

of  its  past  do  you  begin  to  understand  that  this

object has untapped potential. By uncovering the

items full history, you can discover the keys that

unlock the items full power.

You  might  even  found  your  own  item  of  legacy.

After all, the player characters are the epic heroes of a

campaign, from which arise myths, relics, and weap-

ons of legend. By founding an item of legacy, you gain

some degree of control over its abilities, although how

you wield it is in the hands of fate (and the Dungeon

Master). See Chapter 4: Founding Legacies for more

about this option.

Every item of legacy is distinct from the next, and

each has its own unique story. Unearthing that story

(or  creating  it,  when  founding  an  item  of  legacy)

allows you to gain the full benets of the item. For

example, the story of Caladbolg, which appears only

when a great hero has need of it, contrasts sharply

with  that  of  Stormchasers  Cudgel,  whose  heritage

involves the murder of the weapons original owner,

Suldan Kabrel the giant slayer.

No matter what items of legacy you eventually

discover or create, using such items entails a steep

personal cost. The specifics are different for each

item,  but  the  costs  are  always  substantial.  You

must consider the consequences before taking up

a legacy item.

For most characters, these costs are well worth

paying.

WHY USE ITEMS OF LEGACY?

If  youre  a  DM,  items  of  legacy  provide  exciting

rewards  for  players  whose  characters  are  willing

to devote time and energy to learning about your

campaign world. To unlock the powers of a legacy

item, a player character must learn fabled legends

of ancient history and complete rituals of mythic

signicance. Not only does this require the player

to study the backstory of your world but also pro-

vides any number of ready-made adventure hooks

for the campaign.

If youre a player, a legacy item presents a way of

personalizing your character while simultaneously

building up her might. By tying her development

to one of the great tales of history, your character

takes  on  heroic  proportions.  Who  knows?  She

might  even  become  more  famous  than  the  first

owner of the legacy item, unlocking powers of even

greater potential.

ITEMS OF LEGACY

IN YOUR GAME

As  a  DM,  you  might  hesitate  to  introduce  these

potentially  powerful  items  into  your  campaign.  In

this section you will nd helpful points, background

information, and expanded rules to help you deal with

the challenges of legacy items.

INTRODUCING LEGACY ITEMS

As  with  any  new  addition  to  your  campaign,  you

must determine how items of legacy t in. What role

(if any) did they play in the history of the campaign

world?  Why  havent  the  player  characters  heard

of  them  before  now?  Are  there  any  active  items  of

legacy in the world today? Most important, do the

PCsknowingly  or  unknowinglypossess  any

legacy items already?

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

ARTIFACT OR LEGACY ITEM?

At first blush, artifacts and legacy items look similar, and

they do share many traits. However, they are distinct from

each other and should remain separate entities.

Both are extremely powerful, and neither should be

considered  just  another  piece  of  equipment.  But  an

artifacts power can be the hub upon which campaigns

spin, while legacy items shake the world lessif only

because  their  abilities  are  not  free  to  all  comers.  Of

course,  the  search  to  discover  an  item  of  legacy  (or

reforge a destroyed one) can still produce exciting and

memorable storylines.

Artifacts are generally constructed in a distant age using

spells  and  rites  that  are  beyond  the  ken  of  present-day

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

knowledge. They survive to this day, but the knowledge

necessary  to  duplicate  their  creation  does  not.  Their

abilities  are  also  always  available  to  any  would-be

wielder, regardless of how much or little knowledge he

has of the artifacts history, and do not require costly

rituals to unlock.

Legacy items are not always lost wonderseven today,

a new legacy might be founded. If one is located, only a

dedicated  researcher  can  discover  and  use  its  powers,

and then only after undergoing one or more legacy ritu-

als. Such items might be more plentiful than artifacts, but

because of their hidden nature and forgotten lineage, their

true numbers are unknown.

Revisionist History

Retroactively changing your campaigns history is the

easiest way to incorporate legacy items into your game:

They have always been a part of the world. Up to now,

though, the PCs either hadnt encountered a legacy

item, or they never realized that the undistinguished

+1 longsword wielded by the ghter actually has a long

and storied history.

Another way to accomplish this goal is to rein-

troduce formerly encountered NPCs and monsters.

They reappear, wielding the same signature items

or weaponsthis time, these items are far more

powerful  in  the  foes  hands.  For  example,  the

half-orc assassin Terl tries once again to fulfill his

contract on one of the PCs after having failed in

an earlier attempt. Terl still wields his signature

ebony-black bow, but this time around, it looses a

shaft of utter darkness, death wrapped in a shadow.

This bow is the same weapon, but Terl has unlocked

an ability it once conferred upon a previous wielder.

Alternatively, Terl was involved in some momen-

tous event (one that the PCs perhaps have heard

of) that allowed him to imbue his favorite weapon

of assassination with legacy abilities. Either way,

the  PCs  ongoing  interaction  with  Terl  and  his

bow can be a vehicle for introducing legacy items

to your campaign.

First Founding

Maybe your PCs havent heard of legacy items before

because they are among the rst to found such mighty

creations.  The  following  are  some  possibilities  for

explaining why this is so.

Your world is young. The PCs are its earliest heroes,

who will form the basis of legends, and of legendary

items, in future ages.

An invasion, revolution, or other upheaval changes

the world forever. The appearance of legacy items

is just one of many momentous events at this time.

The PCs themselves might be responsible for set-

ting the change in motion (perhaps on concluding

a great quest or fullling a long-term story arc), or

they might have nothing to do with it but suddenly

discover or found legacy items.

Since legacy items are not easy to come by, a PC

founds one instead. Founding a legacy requires

a specic impetus. This could be sponsorship by

an NPC with a different legacy item (to get the

PC wielder on the right track), or completion of a

grand quest (to discover the item or learn a piece of

history necessary to perform a least ritual to unlock

an existing items legacy).

The first characters to wield items of legacy have

new abilities to explore, but they must rst gure

out  how  to  unlock  those  abilities.  They  have  to

research the history of their legacy items, or discover

a trove of relevant information from a time when

larger-than-life  heroes  walked  the  world  wielding

mythical weapons.

DESIGNING LEGACY

ADVENTURES

Once youve decided to include legacy items in your

campaign, you arent required to make all adventures

contain some seed of legacy inuence from that point

on. For the most part, you need not change your game

style at all.

You  dont  even  have  to  decide  ahead  of  time  if

a  particular  magic  item  found  in  the  course  of

adventuring is really a legacy item. Legacy abilities

become available only after an items wielder dis-

covers its history and further performs a ritual to

unlock them. Thus, you enjoy the luxury of deciding

when to reveal the item (say, the ghters magic bat-

tleaxe) as something more. For instance, you could

have the party discover an old book containing an

illustration  of  some  important  personage  of  yore

carrying an identical-looking axe that blazes with

power. Dropping this clue should make the ghter

curious enough to try nding out more about his

axe,  possibly  discovering  that  it  once  had  great

powers. Further clues garnered in the course of his

investigation suggest that he could reawaken those

powers with the proper ritual.

Discovering a Legacy Item

A blunt, if simplistic, assessment of the DUNGEONS

&  DRAGONS  game  is  that  its  all  about  the  stuff.

Whatever other challenges it might offer or what

skills  the  PCs  must  draw  on  to  succeed,  every

adventure includes treasure. Its the all-important

reward that coaxes every would-be adventurer from

the docile life of the commoner to one of explora-

tion and glory.

From time to time, an item of magical power is

unearthed from an age-old tomb or pried from the

bloody hand of a nally vanquished nemesis. These

are climactic moments, and the adventurers distrib-

ute such items among themselves with excitement

and wonder.

Yet  in  almost  every  case,  that  beloved  item  is

eventually eclipsed by some greater need or more

potent  magic.  The  possession  once  so  cherished

becomes obsolete, to be passed on to a cohort or

even  sold  to  finance  the  purchase  of  even  more

powerful items.

What if that item, seemingly possessed of only

minor power, was more than it seemed? What if it

had a legendary history, a pageant of great deeds and

wondrous abilities far outstripping anything it seems

capable of now?

Because  legacy  items  initially  look  like  standard

magic items, youre free to sometimes add one to the

treasure normally gained for defeating a particular

threat at a given Encounter Level. (Until its legacy

powers have been unlocked, the item has no more

apparent value than any oth-

er  of  its  kind.)  The  party

members may or may not

discover the true lineage

of  the  item,  but  if  they

do not, you can always

introduce  more  legacy

items  in  the  guise  of

ordinary treasure later

in the game.

The  party  might

wrest an item of legacy

from an NPC foe who

wields it against them. De-

pending on whether it has

unlocked any of the items

legacy abilities, that oppo-

nent  can  present  a  greater

challenge than usual.

If the foe has not yet unlocked

the item, treat it as a normal part of that foes equip-

ment. If it has completed one or more legacy rituals,

do not reduce the value of its equipment, even though

these rituals represent additional costs (this would be

the equivalent of taking treasure away from the PCs).

Instead, adjust the NPCs Challenge Rating based on

the number of legacy abilities to which it has access.

These increases do not stack.

History

If  a  magic  item  is  found  to  possess  a  long  and

distinguished history, there is a good chance that

it is an item of legacy. A partial record provides

the historical thread that the items new wielder

must  follow  to  figure  out  how  to  awaken  it  to

full power.

A legacy items history is an account of specific

important events in its past that qualify it for legacy

status.  Spectacular  defeats  of  horrific  enemies,

sudden reversals, and tragic losses: All play some

part in the original empowerment of a legacy item.

Before the latest owner can uncover and perform the

rituals necessary to unlock its wondrous abilities,

he or she must learn this history. In game terms,

every item of legacy requires increasingly difficult

Knowledge (history) checks to piece together the

fragments of legend associated with it. (Alterna-

tive methods of researching

a  legacy  are  discussed  on

page 205.)

Legacy Rituals

Every legacy items history

contains  a  seed  of  oppor-

tunity that a new wielder

can exploit. Through re-

search, the wielder can

learn what specic rites,

procedures, or ceremo-

nies  are  necessary  to

bond with the item.

With  each  ritual  com-

pleted, a new range of legacy

abilities become available. For

instance, a wielder of Storm-

chasers Cudgel (see page 163) who

learns  some  of  the  enormous

clubs history can also learn the ritual of the Traceless

Path. On completing the ritual and paying all asso-

ciated costs, the wielder learns to use the weapons

dazing strike ability. In addition to any tasks required

as part of the ritual, every legacy ritual has a substan-

tial gold piece cost for materials (such as unguents,

ne robes, or other expensive items) expended dur-

ing its performance.

A  legacy  item  has  up  to  three  rituals  associated

with it, each one tied to a yet-more-obscure piece of

its past. An item of particularly great importance has

a more extensive history, and thus more associated

rituals, than one with less inuence on history. As a

Anything has the potential to be a legacy item

wielder discovers each piece of an items story, he or

she learns each of its legacy rituals.

A legacy items wielder who completes a given ritual

immediately gains a bonus legacy feat: Least Legacy,

Lesser Legacy, or Greater Legacy. For more informa-

tion, see Legacy Feats on page 13. Each legacy feat

is  specic  to  the  particular  item  whose  connected

ritual the wielder performs. For instance, if Aedwar

completes  the  ritual  of  Sanctication  of  Darkness

associated with his legacy weapon, Exordius, he gains

the Least Legacy (Exordius) feat. From now on, he

can use the weapons least abilities (assuming he has

attained a high enough level), but only when wielding

Exordius. If he were to wield another item of legacy,

the Least Legacy (Exordius) feat wouldnt allow him

to use that items least abilitieshed rst have to

research the new weapons history and perform its

specic legacy rituals.

WIELDING AN ITEM OF LEGACY

After having completed at least one of the legacy

rituals  of  your  item,  you  are  entitled  to  use  the

abilities  of  that  item  available  to  a  character  of

your level.

Thats  rightyou  dont  get  them  all  at  once.  If

you are 5th level and you have just earned the Least

Legacy (Bloodcriers Hammer) feat, you do not have

access to abilities of the weapon keyed to characters

of 6th level and higher. However, as soon  as  you

attain another level in any class, bringing your char-

acter level to 6th, you can use the earthseeker ability

of Bloodcriers Hammer (see the weapons description

on page 29).

Unless  otherwise  specified,  an  item  of  legacy

confers a given ability as long as you are wearing or

carrying it on your person; some abilities, however,

require that you wield, gesture with, or in some way

actively use the item. Such abilities descriptions

state this specically. Losing possession of the item

immediately removes all legacy benets.

pqs

SUMMARY:

DISCOVERING A LEGACY WEAPON

1. Discover an interesting item.

2. Determine whether the item has a special history.

3. Research history and determine if it is an item of legacy.

4. Learn the legacy ritual to unlock the items abilities.

5.  Perform the ritual, pay required costs, and gain bonus

legacy feat.

pqs

Personal Costs

In  addition  to  performing  a  ritual  and  paying  its

gp cost, you must pay personal costs to use a legacy

items ability. All items of legacy exact substantial

personal costs, which represent the items tapping

into your vital energy to unlock its full potential. You

must make this sacrice willingly to forge the bond

between wielder and item.

Personal costs are permanent and can range from

hit point loss to forfeiting spell slots. You must pay a

personal cost immediately upon reaching the level

at which it is assessed, after all other level-related

adjustments.  For  example,  if  you  are  the  wielder

of  Bloodcriers  Hammer,  on  reaching  6th  level  you

immediately  lose  4  hit  points  after  determining

your new hit point total. If you are unable to pay the

cost (for example, because you do not have access to

a required spell level), you do not gain that levels

legacy ability or abilities until you can pay.

Unlike legacy abilities, personal costs are assessed

permanently,  whether  or  not  you  have  the  item

in  your  possession.  The  only  way  to  recover  a

personal cost is to destroy or renounce the legacy

item (see below).

Renouncing a Legacy

Perhaps the cost of wielding your legacy item is

too high, or you have discovered a different item

and no longer wish to wield the original one. If

you wish, you can renounce your connection with

a legacy item. This requires performing a 24-hour

ritual that expends materials costing 1,000 gp. On

concluding  the  ritual,  you  lose  all  bonus  legacy

feats (Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy, Greater Legacy)

you had previously gained for that item. For you

the  item  now  has  only  its  nonlegacy  properties,

and  you  lose  all  legacy  abilities  you  previously

had access to. You recover any personal costs you

previously paid (such as lost hit points or penal-

ties), but not any gp costs paid for legacy rituals.

If you regain lost skill points, you must allocate

them immediately. Treat this as if you were pur-

chasing skill ranks for the last class in which you

advanced a level.

Damaging Items of Legacy

Items of legacy are more resistant to damage than

standard  magic  items,  but  they  can  be  damaged

and even destroyed. Even so, its often possible to

repair a broken legacy item (see Reforging Legacy

Items, below).

As with any magic item, a legacy item doesnt need

to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is

specically targeted by an effect, or its wielder rolls

a  natural  1  on  a  saving  throw  against  a  damaging

effect. Legacy items always get a saving throw against

spells that might deal damage to themeven attacks

against which a nonmagical item would normally get

no chance to save. Legacy items use the same saving

throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type

(Fortitude,  Reex,  or  Will).  A  legacy  items  saving

throw bonus is +20.

Even if a legacy item is damaged (whether be-

cause of a failed save or through direct physical

attack), it is tougher than a standard magic item of

the  same  sort.  A  legacy

items  hardness  is  in-

creased by 10, and its hit

points are 50 or the total

from  materials  and  en-

hancements,  whichever

is higher. For instance, a

legacy  longsword  with  a

+5  enhancement  bonus

has  hardness  30  (10  for

steel,  +10  for  the  weap-

ons  enhancement,  and

+10  for  being  an  item  of

legacy); its hit points total

55  (5  for  the  steel  blade,

+50  for  the  weapons  en-

hancement).  A  damaged

legacy item continues to

function,  but  once  it  is

destroyed, its legacy abil-

ities  are  lost.  However,

a  destroyed  legacy  item

always  leaves  a  tangible

remnantthe  shards  of

a swords blade, the metal-

shod heels of a staff, and

so on. Even a legacy item

destroyed by a disintegrate

spell  leaves  a  remnant

(this is an exception to the

spells printed effect).

Legacy Item against Legacy

Item: When a legacy item is used to attack another

legacy  item,  it  ignores  the  additional  10  hardness

that  the  attacked  item  has  by  virtue  of  its  legacy

status. In other words, it treats the opposing item as a

standard magic item of the same sort for the purpose

of dealing damage, though both items retain their

+20 bonus on saving throws.

Repairing Legacy Items: A legacy item that is

damaged (but not destroyed) can be repaired using

the Craft skill, or with the make whole spell, just

as if it were a nonmagical item of the same sort.

Destroyed  legacy  items  must  be  reforged  from

their remnants, which requires much more effort

(see below).

If a legacy item is destroyed, you lose your con-

nection to it, just as if you had renounced the item.

For you it has only its nonlegacy properties, and

you  lose  all  legacy  abilities  you  previously  had

access to. You recover any personal costs you pre-

viously paid (such as lost

hit  points  or  penalties),

but not any gp costs paid

for legacy rituals.

Reforging Legacy

Items

Though wondrously tough,

sometimes legacy items are

destroyed through physical

damage or magical means.

But,  as  noted  above,  they

always  leave  behind  rem-

nants. Be they shards of a

blade, a rings gemstone, or

a few plates of loose armor,

those  remnants  retain  a

residue of power that links

them to the original item.

Characters with the prop-

er  skill  and  knowledge

can attempt to reforge the

item  from  its  remnants.

Such  an  undertaking  is

often  associated  with  an

important  quest,  a  great

need,  or  some  other  com-

pelling,  campaign-related

impetus.

If scanned using detect

magic, the remnants of a destroyed

legacy item have a faint aura of

no particular school. Obviously, the original wielder

already knows what the remnants represent. Some-

one  who  doesnt  realize  their  true  nature  could

learn the remnants history from clues found over

the course of the campaign. This information is

also available through the legend lore spell, as well

as Knowledge (history) or bardic knowledge checks.

The check DC is equal to that required to learn the

items least legacy ritual.

Once the remnants are recognized for what they

are, a determined owner can attempt to restore the

original legacy item from its fragments.

Reforging by Previous Wielder: If you are a

previous  wielder  of  a  now-destroyed  legacy  item

and wish to reforge it, you must repeat the highest

legacy ritual (least, lesser, or greater) that you had

previously completed for that item. You must again

pay the gp cost of raw materials. Not more than one

week before or after completing the ritual, you (or

someone working on your behalf) must successfully

repair the item as described above. Once the legacy

item is reforged, it has the same connection to you as

it did before it was destroyed; you regain lost legacy

feats, and you immediately are again assessed any

personal costs.

Reforging by New Wielder: If you discover the

remnants of a legacy item and have identied them,

you must make another Knowledge (history) check

to  learn  the  least  legacy  ritual  associated  with  the

item. Next, you must perform the least legacy ritual,

paying all associated costs. Not more than one week

before or after completing the ritual, you (or someone

working  on  your  behalf)  must  successfully  repair

the item as described above. Once the legacy item is

reforged, you gain the Least Legacy feat associated

with the item and have access to its least abilities,

assuming you are of the requisite level and meet any

other prerequisites.

remnants (which might require rst destroying it).

You then must perform the items least legacy ritual,

paying all associated costs, as though reforging it.

However, at the end of this procedure, the remnants

are permanently destroyed beyond recall.

LEGACY AGAINST LEGACY

Its the climax of the campaign. The hero and the

archvillain face each other in mortal combat, and each

wields an item of legacy. Special rules come into play

during and after such momentous events.

A LEGACY DEFEATED

If you wield a legacy item and defeat the wielder of

another legacy item in personal conict, you gain an

immediate gift from releasing some of that items

power. A ash of legacy power discharges from the

defeated wielders item and into your own.

You are considered to have defeated the opposing

wielder if you kill or render that wielder uncon-

scious through a direct use of your legacy item (a

blow from a weapon, a blast from a staff, and so on).

Destroying the other wielders legacy item is not

in itself sufficient.

Once you have defeated a legacy item wielder in

this way, you cant ght and defeat that wielder to

gain another gift until one full year has passed.

Legacy against Artifact: The wielder of a legacy

item who defeats the wielder of an artifact gains the

same  ash  of  power  that  normally  results  from  a

legacy item defeating another legacy item. The reverse

is also true.

Permanent Destruction

Legacy Gifts

A legacy item is not easily destroyed, but if you are

determined to erase it permanently, a method does

exist.  (An  example  is  the  great  quest  required  to

destroy the One Ring.) You must possess the items

As soon as you defeat a legacy wielder, you gain your

choice of one of the following gifts.

Discover New Legacy: You unlock a new tier of

legacy abilities in your item. Effectively, you have

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

ENHANCING AN ITEM OF LEGACY

The power of a legacy item cannot be further enhanced

using any regular process (such as magic or psionic item

creation feats). However, spells or effects that temporar-

ily alter a weapon (such as greater magic weapon or keen

edge) work normally on weapons of legacy.

The only way to permanently change a legacy items

abilities  is  through  a  new  founding.  For  instance,  the

dagger Devious (see page 67) offers only least abilities,

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

and  historical  research  reveals  no  further  lineage  that

might unlock additional abilities. If you want to give this

weapon further legacy powers, use the rules in Chapter

4:  Founding  Legacies  to  found  your  own  legacy  and

further  empower  the  item  with  lesser  abilities  of  your

own design. As you progress in power, you might later

choose to imbue it with greater legacy abilities or even

epic legacy abilities.

completed  a  founding  event  (see  page  180)  for  the

item. You must still design and perform the necessary

legacy rituals and pay the associated costs if you

wish to use these newfound abilities.

Learn  Legacy:  You  instantly  gain

the knowledge of the next legacy rit-

ual required to continue

unlocking your items

abilities, as if you had

succeeded  on  the  re-

quired  Knowledge

(history)  check.  In

addition, when per-

forming that ritual,

you do not pay the gp

cost of raw materials

(although you must

complete  any  other

required  tasks).  After

thirty days, the knowledge

is  lost;  you  must  make

the requisite Knowledge

check  and  spend  the

normal gp cost to learn and

perform the ritual as normal.

Legacy Bonus: You are granted an inspi-

ration, which takes the form of a floating +10

bonus available for the next 1 minute (10 rounds).

At any point during this time as an immediate

action (see the sidebar on page

15), you can apply this bonus

to a single attack roll, saving

throw, skill or ability check, or

caster level check.

Legacy Healing: You regain hit points equal to

five times the character level of the defeated foe. You

also recover all ability damage, whether temporary

or permanent. You cant gain more hit points than

your normal maximum.

Master Legacy: You are treated as one

level  higher  for  the  purpose  of  accessing

your items legacy abilities, as if you had the

Master Legacy feat (see page 15). The effect of

this gift stacks with that of the feat but lasts for

only 24 hours.

Psionic Energy: You gain temporary power

points equal to the level of the de-

feated  foe.  These  extra

power points last until

used or until 24 hours

elapse, whichever oc-

curs rst.

Spell  Energy:

You recall one spell

that  you  have  cast

during  the  past  24

hours.  The  spell

must have been ac-

tually cast during

that  period.  The

recalled  spell  is

stored in your mind

as though prepared in

the  normal  fash-

ion. If the recalled

spell requires ma-

terial  components,  you

must  provide  them.  If  you  do

not prepare spells to cast them,

you instead regain one spell slot. The maximum

level of spell restored is equal to half the character

level of the defeated foe (maximum 9th).

The winner of a contest between legacy items gains

some of the defeated items power

n a world of menace, where creatures of savage

hunger stalk the vulnerable, and where ancient,

evil gods encourage villainy and mayhem, the

abilities of the heroic few are sorely tested. For

aid, heroes can call upon potent spells, abilities honed

by  diligent  training  and  experience,  and  cunning

items of magical might.

But there is deeper and more ancient lore too.

This  chapter  provides  additional  resources  for

wielders (and founders) of items of legacy, including

new feats, spells, psionic powers, and a legacy-themed

prestige class.

LEGACY FEATS

Unlocking the legacy abilities of an item requires

the related legacy feat (least, lesser, or greater). Other

legacy-related feats allow you to further enhance the

items abilities.

In  addition  to  the  listed  prerequisites,  you  must

physically possess (carry, wear, or wield) your legacy

item to benet from any legacy feat.

The feat descriptions below use the same format

presented in the Players Handbook.

CHANNEL LEGACY [LEGACY]

You  can  call  upon  the  hidden  strength  within

your legacy item to empower yourself for a single

spectacular effort.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with

a daily use limit.

Benefit: Choose one of your items available

legacy  abilities  with  a  daily  use  limit.  As  an

immediate  action  (see  the  sidebar  on  page

15), you can expend all the daily uses of that

ability to grant yourself a bonus on all attack

rolls, saves, and checks. This bonus lasts until

the start of your next turn and depends on the

power of the legacy ability, as shown in the

following table.

Legacy Ability Expended

Least

Lesser

Greater

Bonus

+2

+4

+6

All daily uses of the legacy ability are expended

without  their  normal  effect.  You  choose  the

ability when you use this feat.

Special:  You  cannot  use  this  feat  to  expend  any

legacy ability that does not have its full daily comple-

ment  of  uses  remaining.  For  example,  if  a  legacy

ability is usable three times per day, all three daily

uses must be available to use this feat.

CURATIVE LEGACY [LEGACY]

Your  items  legacy  ability  is  so  linked  with  your

aura  that  it  restores  your  health  each  time  it  is

activated.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a

daily use limit, ability to cast cure light wounds.

Benet: When you select this feat, choose one

of your items available legacy abilities with a daily

use limit. Each time you activate the chosen ability,

you regain hit points as though a cure spell were cast

on you. You cannot gain more hit points than your

full  normal  total.  The  amount  of  damage  healed

depends on the power of the ability, as shown in the

following table.

Special:  You  can  gain  Curative  Legacy  multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the

feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

EMPOWER LEGACY [LEGACY]

You can use one of your items legacy abilities to

greater effect.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, spell-like or command-

activated legacy ability.

Benet: When you select this feat, choose one

available spell-like legacy ability of a specic item,

or one whose effect is triggered by a command word.

Three times per day, you can choose to increase by

one-half all variable, numeric effects of that ability

(as the Empower Spell feat).

Special: You can gain Empower Legacy multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the

feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

GREATER LEGACY [LEGACY]

You awaken the most powerful abilities of a specic

item of legacy.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy, charac-

ter level 17th, learn and perform the associated greater

legacy ritual of the chosen item.

Benet: Choose one item of legacy (or candidate

item, if you are founding a legacy). If you meet the

other  prerequisites  for  wielding  that  item,  you  can

use any of the items greater legacy abilities that are

available to a character of your level.

LEAST LEGACY [LEGACY]

You  awaken  the  basic  abilities  of  a  specific  item

of legacy.

Prerequisites:  Character  level  5th,  learn  and

Benet: Choose one item of legacy (or candidate

item, if founding a legacy). If you meet the other

prerequisites for wielding that item, you can use any

of the items least legacy abilities that are available to

a character of your level.

LEGACY FOCUS [LEGACY]

Your items legacy abilities are more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Least Legacy.

Benet: Add +1 to the Difculty Class for all saving

throws against your legacy items abilities.

LESSER LEGACY [LEGACY]

You awaken more powerful abilities of a specic item

of legacy.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, character level 11th,

learn and perform the associated lesser legacy ritual

of the chosen item.

Benet: Choose one item of legacy (or candidate

item,  if  founding  a  legacy).  If  you  meet  the  other

prerequisites for wielding that item, you can use any

of the items lesser legacy abilities that are available

to a character of your level.

MASTER LEGACY [LEGACY]

You temporarily gain access to legacy abilities beyond

your normal reach.

Prerequisites: Channel Legacy, Least Legacy, Use

Magic Device 4 ranks.

Benet: Once per day as a free action, you can

treat your character level as if it were one higher for

determining which legacy abilities you can use. You

do not pay any new personal costs associated with

the increased level, but you cannot access any abili-

ties  for  which  you  have  not  met  the  prerequisites.

For example, a 10th-level character gains no benet

from this feat, since she has not yet gained the Lesser

Legacy feat required to use legacy abilities of 11th

level or higher.

This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you activate

a legacy ability with a daily use limit, whichever

comes first.

QUICKEN LEGACY [LEGACY]

You  can  activate  one  of  your  items  legacy  abilities

with a moments thought.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, spell-like or command-

activated legacy ability.

Benet: When you select this feat, choose one avail-

able spell-like legacy ability of a specic item, or one

whose effect is triggered by a command word. Three

times per day, you can trigger that power as a swift

action, as the Quicken Spell feat (see the denition

of swift actions in the sidebar below).

Special:  You  can  gain  Quicken  Legacy  multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the

feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

SWIFT AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

The Miniatures Handbook introduced the concept of a

new action type: the swift action. Likewise, the Expanded

Psionics Handbook introduced another new action type:

the  immediate  action.  These  two  game  concepts  are

not restricted to miniatures play or psionics and can be

utilized in a regular D&D roleplaying game. Some of the

feats, spells, or legacy abilities in Weapons of Legacy and

future DUNGEONS & DRAGONS supplements use these con-

cepts. A description of how they work follows.

Swift  Action:  A  swift  action  consumes  a  very  small

amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of

effort  and  energy  than  a  free  action.  You  can  perform

one  swift  action  per  turn  without  affecting  your  ability

to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is

like a free action. However, you can perform only a single

swift  action  per  turn,  regardless  of  what  other  actions

you take. You can take a swift action any time you would

normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions do

not provoke attacks of opportunity.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Immediate  Action:  Much  like  a  swift  action,  an  im-

mediate action consumes a very small amount of time,

but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy

than  a  free  action.  However,  unlike  a  swift  action,  an

immediate action can be performed at any timeeven

if its not your turn. Casting feather fall is an immediate

action  (instead  of  a  free  action,  as  stated  in  the  spell

description in the Players Handbook), since the spell can

be cast at any time.

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as

using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for

that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or

a swift action until after your next turn if you have used

an immediate action when it is not currently your turn

(effectively, using an immediate action before your turn

is equivalent to using your swift action for the coming

turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you

are flat-footed.

TRANSFER LEGACY [LEGACY]

5th-Level Bard Spell

You can temporarily transfer one of your legacy items

abilities to another magic item.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a

daily use limit.

Benet: Choose one of your items available legacy

abilities with a daily use limit. Once per day, you

can transfer that ability from your legacy item to

another magic item. This transfer requires you to

touch the legacy item to the recipient magic item

(a standard action).

For  the  next  24  hours,  you  cannot  activate  the

transferred  ability.  However,  the  wielder  of  the

recipient magic item can activate the transferred

ability as the legacy items wielder, for as many uses

as remain in the day. The recipient wielder need not

meet  any  prerequisites  for  activating  or  using  the

donor legacy item.

Special: You cannot transfer a legacy ability that

does not have at least one daily use remaining. You

choose the ability when you use this feat.

If you have the Lesser Legacy feat, you can use

this  ability  two  times  per  day.  If  you  have  the

Greater Legacy feat, you can use this ability three

times per day. Each time you do so, you must choose

a different ability.

SPELLS OF LEGACY

Over the years, spellcasters have developed a few

incantations to manipulate the abilities of legacy

items.  Some  of  these  spells  benefit  an  items

wielder, while others are preferred by the enemies

of those individuals.

SPELL LISTS

Some  of  these  spells  are  usable  by  classes  other

than those in the Players Handbook. The hexblade is

described in Complete Warrior. Spells granted to the

shugenja (Complete Divine) fall into the All category

for that class. The favored soul and spirit shaman (also

from Complete Divine) can cast any spell available to

clerics  or  to  druids,  respectively.  Spells  granted  to

the  wu  jen  (Complete  Arcane)  do  not  belong  to  any

elemental group.

Necromancy

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8, wu jen 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You permanently disrupt the bond between the target

creature and its legacy item (or items). The target is

treated as if it had not performed any of the legacy

rituals for its item or items. It loses all of the following

feats it has gained for all of its legacy items: Greater

Legacy, Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy.

If  the  targets  Hit  Dice  total  exceeds  your  caster

level, the target adds the difference as a bonus on its

Will save to negate the effect. Any creature that suc-

cessfully saves against this spell cannot be affected

by it again for 24 hours.

The target does not regain any of the personal costs

paid to gain access to legacy abilities. It can regain

access to its items legacy abilities by performing the

requisite rituals again. In this case, it does not pay

again any personal costs that it has already paid.

Other than by again performing the legacy rituals to

regain lost feats, the effect of this spell can be negated

only by miracle or wish.

Spell Resistance: Yes

You temporarily disrupt the bond between the target

activate any of the items legacy abilities, nor do any

continuous effects of the legacy item grant any benet

to the target.

If the target has more than one legacy item, deter-

mine randomly which one is affected.

This effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated

by break enchantment, remove curse, or any other effect

that removes a curse.

LEGACY PSIONIC POWERS

Just as spellcasters are able to manipulate the essence

of a legacy item, so, too, are psionically aware creatures

able to inuence items of legacy through the powers

of the mind.

see Chapter 5 of the Expanded Psionic Handbook.

PRESTIGE CLASS:

LEGACY CHAMPION

In my hand, talismans of ancient manufacture have no

secrets. Their primeval power is mine.

 Marrush Scarhand

As a legacy champion, you are so devoted to the history

and chronicle of a particular item of legacy that you

enjoy enhanced access to your items legacy abilities.

You can learn the needed rituals more quickly and

use the items abilities more often, and you can even

customize the items abilities to your own purpose.

The story of a particular legacy item becomes central

to your own identity, so much so that you might

change part of your name, behavior, clothing, or other

attributes to more closely reect historical or visual

aspects of your item.

BECOMING A

LEGACY CHAMPION

To become a legacy champion, you must already pos-

sess an item of legacy, have unlocked its least abilities,

and be on the cusp of unlocking its lesser abilities.

No  particular  class  is  most  associated  with  legacy

championsobsession can be visited upon anyone.

Members of classes more inclined to study ancient

texts, such as wizards, have a slight predilection for

becoming legacy champions; however, reduced spell-

casting ability keeps wizards from predominating.

Legacy Champion Entry Requirements

Skill: Knowledge (history) 5 ranks.

Feat: Least Legacy*.

Special: Must possess a legacy item, character

level 10th.

New feat; see page 14.

CLASS FEATURES

As a legacy champion, you are focused on exploring

to the fullest the potential of your legacy item. Your

class features deal with getting needed information

more quickly and exploiting it effectively. Your exist-

ing class abilities continue to advance at nearly their

full rate, interrupted only by opportunities to unlock

legacy abilities at greatly reduced cost.

Class Features: At each level except 1st and 7th,

you gain class features and an increase in effective

level as if you had also gained a level in a class to which

you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

The  specic  class  features  you  gain  include  spells

per day (and spells known, if applicable), improved

chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic

or item creation feats, bonus feats, monk special abili-

ties, sneak attack progressions, and so on, depending

on the class. You do not, however, gain the benet of

your  previous  classs  Hit  Dice,  attack  progression,

skill points, or saving throws. If you had more than

one class before becoming a legacy champion, you

must decide to which class to add each level for the

purpose of determining class abilities.

Reduced  Ritual  Cost:  After  youve  made  a  suc-

cessful Knowledge (history) check to learn the lesser

legacy ritual for your legacy item, you can perform

that ritual and gain the Lesser Legacy feat as normal.

However, you do not pay the rituals associated gp cost.

You must still perform all other aspects of the ritual

and pay any personal costs required to unlock lesser

abilities. If you have more than one legacy item, you

must decide to which one this reduction applies.

On reaching 7th level, you can perform the greater

legacy ritual for your item without paying the associ-

ated gp cost.

Bond of Lore (Ex): You add your class level as an

insight bonus to Knowledge (history) checks made

in relation to your legacy item.

Replace Legacy Ability (Ex): As your bond with

your legacy item strengthens, you become capable of

permanently changing the items abilities to suit your

needs. At 2nd level, you can replace any one least ability

granted by your item with your choice of any least abil-

ity from Menu A in Chapter 4: Founding Legacies.

At 5th level, you can replace any one least or lesser

ability with your choice of any least ability from Menu

A or any lesser ability from Menu D, respectively.

At 10th level, you can replace any one least, lesser,

or greater ability with your choice of any least ability

from Menu A, any lesser ability from Menu D, or any

greater ability from Menu G, respectively.

Extra Legacy Ability Use (Su): As your bond

with your legacy item strengthens, you can draw

on its abilities more often than normal. At 3rd level,

choose one of your items least abilities with a daily

use limit. You can use that ability one extra time per

day. Once you have chosen an ability, you cannot

change it later.

At 6th level, you can also gain an extra daily use

of one of your items lesser abilities. At 9th level, you

can also gain an extra daily use of one of your items

greater abilities. You can instead choose to gain an

extra daily use of a lower ability (for example, choosing

a second least ability instead of a lesser ability at 6th

level), but you cant gain more than one extra daily

use of a given ability.

If your item has no legacy abilities with a daily

use limit, you gain no benet from this class feature.

If you later gain access to an eligible legacy ability,

you can immediately choose that ability for an extra

daily use.

Bonus Legacy Feat: At 4th and 8th level, you gain

a bonus feat related to your legacy item, which can be

selected from any of the legacy feats in this chapter

for which you meet the prerequisites.

PLAYING A LEGACY CHAMPION

You  hold  a  deep  reverence  for  the  historical  sig-

nicance of your legacy item. You know that many

useful and valid lessons lie in the story of its found-

ing and the events that surround its passage down

the ages to your current stewardship. The pageant of

its history contains myriad stories that, if properly

interpreted, remain as relevant today as the day the

item was founded.

The history of the legacy item is more than a litany of

craving for power, of bloodlust, violence, destruction,

unfolds. In your hands, the item continues its great

journey through the ages, becoming a part of events

yet to take shape. In some distant future, it might be

your name that is repeated in awe when some lucky

person nds the legacy item and learns something

of its past.

Combat

If your legacy item is primarily made for battle, then

obviously it is your rst and last recourse when con-

ict beckons. In fact, the more attention you draw

to yourself and the wonder you wield, the

more you might intimidate foes with its

unparalleled potency. Use Bluff, Diplo-

macy,  or  Intimidate  before  or  during

combat while reciting your items

pedigree  to  shake  your  enemies

confidence  in  their  ability  to  de-

feat you.

Advancement

Your  advancement  as  a  legacy

champion  can  vary  widely,

depending on your original

class. Because you contin-

ue to have limited access to

some of that classs abilities,

your best strategy is to customize

your  items  legacy  abilities  to  your

original class. For instance, if you

were originally a ghter, your leg-

acy  item  is  probably  a  weapon.

A  reasonable  advancement  plan

is  continuing  to  choose  bonus

fighter  feats  that  enhance  your

prowess  with  that  weapon;  in

addition,  you  can  customize

the  weapons  legacy  abilities

to work better with your exist-

ing talents.

Resources

Since  this  prestige  class  depends

on possessing an item of legacy, your rst resource

is obvious. Beyond that, you need to continue your

research into the specic details needed to unlock

your  items  history.  In  this  regard,  your  singular

knowledge of obscure history can get you ready access

to many libraries. Likewise, the reputation of your

learning is sufcient to grant you audiences with sages

who might be able to provide additional information

in return for your own expertise.

LEGACY CHAMPIONS

IN THE WORLD

Characters particularly procient with legacy items

are a rare breed, especially since legacy items are not

nearly as common as standard magical items.

Organization

Legacy champions have no partic-

ular or overarching organizations.

Each is unique, and other than

an all-consuming desire to

learn as much as possible

about his legacy item, each

legacy  champion  has  little

in common with any other.

NPC Reactions

Most  people  generally  do  not

recognize a legacy champion as

anything  more  than  someone

with  a  particularly  powerful

magic item. If he further adver-

tises  his  items  pedigree,  NPCs

might be impressed or afraid,

but no more so than with any

other character displaying an

impressive weapon or staff.

Those  NPCs  who  under-

stand  the  concept  of  legacy

items are likely to be impressed

by the legacy champions pos-

session,  whether  or  not  they

understand that he has more fully

tapped into its power than most could

ever hope for. Their reaction might be mere

admiration, but often this is mixed with envy

and greed. As with any wielder of po-

tent magic, a legacy champion must be

vigilant against those who want only

to take the legacy item for themselves

(for all the good it would do them).

LEGACY CHAMPION LORE

Characters  with  Knowledge  (history),  Knowledge

(local), or Gather Information can research legacy

champions to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

that are dif cult, if impossible, to wake.

DC 15: Some magic items of epic pedigree, called

items of legacy, can be wakened to greater power if

enough of their history is researched and understood.

DC  20:  Among  the  wielders  of  legacy  items  are

those  who  more  fully  tap  into  their  items  powers.

These are called legacy champions.

DC 30: Legacy champions do not have to pay the

enormous costs associated with awakening a legacy

item to its full potency. Moreover, they gain access to

their items abilities more quickly and can use them

more often.

Establishing contact with a legacy champion is

dif cult. Characters trying to do so should make a

DC 25 Gather Information check to  nd a library or

sage, through which a meeting can be arranged, or a

DC 30 Gather Information check to track the legacy

champion down directly. If a PC possesses a legacy

item or has information about a legacy item, the check

has a +2 circumstance bonus.

LEGACY CHAMPIONS

IN THE GAME

Legacy champions can show up anywhere

they have no particular creed or af liation

and thus are not constrained to particular

situations or styles of game play.

Although legacy champions could show up in any situ-

ation, they are uncommon, and NPC legacy champions

should be rarely encountered. When such a meeting

happens, it is memorable.

EL 15: Marrush Scarhand wields the mighty spear

Guurgal (see page 103). He believes that by discover-

ing  the  weapon,  he  is  destined  to  be  leader  of  the

Great Horde, an army of orcs that will wash over the

civilized peoples of the world.

Marrush is typically accompanied by a 10th-level

half-orc barbarian and 1d4 5th-level half-orc barbar-

ians (use the statistics on page 112 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

the bonus is lost. The bonus is cumulative, to a

maximum of +5.

Incite Horde (Su) Guurgal grants a +1 morale bonus on

attack rolls and saving throws against fear to all orcs

within 30 feet (not including Marrush).

his chapter presents forty-nine legacy items,

complete with descriptions, histories, ritu-

als,  adventure  seeds,  and  legacy  abilities.

These objects cover a wide range of utility,

from  traditional  instruments  of  war  to

nely honed tools of stealth. Each one is ready to be

included  in  a  campaign  with  only  a  small  amount

of work.

READING THE

LEGACY ITEM ENTRIES

Refer to this section if you have questions about a

legacy items presentation.

Name and Description: The name of the legacy

item is followed by a description of the items appear-

ance and easily observed abilities. Unless you succeed

on the DC 15 Knowledge (history) check concerning

the item, its name isnt automatically evident.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: This entry contains

information that can be gleaned by inspection and

with an identify spell. The cost listed here is for a normal

magic item of the legacy items kind, its true status

remaining unknown. Legacy items are priceless.

History: Every legacy item has a history, which

is  often  obscured  by  a  gulf  of  time.  Knowing

a  piece  of  an  items  past  requires  a  Knowledge

(history) check, with higher and higher DCs to

learn more and more esoteric or pertinent facts.

These  checks  do  not  have  to  be  made  by  the

prospective  wielder  of  the  item.  The  informa-

tion  gained  by  the  checks  must  be  accurately

communicated to that person, however, because

making the relevant Knowledge (history) check

also uncovers the ritual associated with part of

the items legacy. The skill check DC and the

ritual gleaned from a successful check appear

parenthetically  at  the  end  of  each  relevant

paragraph in an items history.

Additional methods of researching a legacy

items history are discussed in Alternatives to

Knowledge (history) Checks, page 205.

Legacy  Rituals:  Every  legacy  item  has

at  least  one  ritual  associated  with  ita

task  that  must  be  successfully  completed  in

order to unlock a range of abilities for your use.

A legacy item can have least, lesser, and greater

rituals, which grant you access to least, lesser,

23

less the columns header notes a speci c save, the

penalty applies on all saves (Fortitude, Re ex, and

Will). Multiple values in the same column are not

cumulative, instead representing the total penalty

applied.

Caster Level Penalty: This is a permanent reduction

in your caster level for all spells. It has no bearing on

the spells you can cast, only on the level-dependent

variables of those spells. Multiple values in the same

column are not cumulative, instead representing the

total reduction applied.

Manifester  Level  Penalty:  This  is  a  permanent

reduction  in  your  manifester  level  for  all  psionic

powers.  It  affects  all  level-dependent  variables  of

psionic powers, as well as the maximum number of

power points you can expend on any one power. Mul-

tiple values in the same column are not cumulative,

instead representing the total reduction applied.

Hit  Point  Loss:  You  permanently  lose  the  listed

number of hit points. The values are cumulative.

Skill Point Loss: The listed number of skill points

are  deducted  from  the  skill  points  you  gain  at  the

indicated level. If you cannot pay this personal cost

in full, you must immediately pay as much as you can

and continue to pay toward the cost, before acquiring

any further skill ranks, until it is entirely paid. Only

when the total cost is paid do you gain access to the

legacy  abilities  of  the  level  exacting  the  cost.  The

values are cumulative.

Spell Slot Loss: You lose the listed spell slot (or slots)

from your daily number of spells. These entries are

not cumulative; each entry on this column replaces

all previous entries.

and  greater  abilities,  respectively,  but  only  if  you

complete the required ritual.

Cost: A legacy ritual has an associated cost in gold

pieces, which is listed here.

Feat  Granted:  Successful  completion  of  a  legacy

ritual  grants  you  the  legacy  feat  listed  here  as  a

bonus feat, assuming you meet its prerequisites. If

you dont have all the prerequisites, you still gain the

feat but cannot bene t from it until the prerequisites

are met.

Wielder Requirements: Legacy items have more

requirements than simply gaining the associated

legacy feats. Such requirements are listed here, much

like  the  prerequisites  for  entering  a  prestige  class.

These requirements do not affect your ability to use

the nonlegacy abilities of the item.

Item Table: Every legacy item is described in terms

of a table that lays out conferred abilities according to

the following information.

Wielder Level: You must possess this character level

to gain the legacy item abilities in the same row of

the  table,  assuming  you  meet  any  other  require-

ments.  Since a character below 5th level cannot

gain access to legacy abilities, each table starts with

that level.

Personal  Costs:  All  legacy  items  exact  some  sort

of personal costs. These costs apply once you gain

access to the legacy abilities of that level, and they

apply whether or not you are actively wielding the

item of legacy. If you renounce your legacy (see page

9), these costs are negated. Speci c types of personal

costs are explained here.

Attack Penalty: This is a permanent penalty on all

your attack rolls. Multiple values

in  the  same  column  are  not

cumulative, instead repre-

senting  the  total  penalty

applied.

Skill  Check  Penalty:

This is a permanent pen-

alty  on  all  your  skill

checks.  Multiple  values

in  the  same  column  are

not  cumulative,  instead

representing  the  total

penalty applied.

Save  Penalty:  This  is

a  permanent  penalty  on

your  saving  throws.  Un-

24

Research is necessary to trace a suspected legacy items place in history

Power  Point  Loss:  You  deduct  the  listed  number

of power points from your daily pool. The values are

cumulative.

Abilities: If all the requirements are met, including

character level, ritual completion, and personal costs,

the legacy item confers the indicated ability or abili-

ties upon you.

Legacy Item Abilities: The abilities conferred by

a legacy item are explained here. In general, using

legacy  items  abilities  requires  you  to  at  least  carry

the item on your person. This default rule has some

exceptions, which are claried in the specic entries

to which they apply.

Unless otherwise noted, activating a legacy ability

is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of

opportunity. The save DC for any legacy ability is equal

to 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modi-

er of the minimum ability score needed to cast that

level of spell, just as normal for magic items (see page

214 of the Dungeon Master s Guide). You can substitute

your Charisma modier for the ability modier used

by the item, if the save DC result would be higher.

Adventure Seed: An encounter is provided, usually

involving discovery of the legacy item.

READING THE

STATISTICS BLOCK

The new statistics block format is divided into four

main  sections,  which  are  separated  by  horizontal

lines. Each section serves a specic purpose, so you

will need to reference different sections at different

times during an encounter. The sections are as follows,

from top to bottom.

Identification and Encounter

The top section identies the creature and gives the

information you need at the start of an encounter.

Name: This word or phrase identies the creature.

Sometimes a number is given with the name to indi-

cate how many creatures appear in the encounter.

CR: This value is the Challenge Rating of an indi-

vidual creature of this kind.

Race, Class, and Level: This information is pro-

vided only for characters with class levels.

Alignment:  The  one-  or  two-letter  abbreviation

that appears here denotes the creatures alignment.

Size and Type: The creatures size category and

its type (and subtype or subtypes, if applicable) are

given here.

Init: This value is the creatures modier on initia-

tive checks.

Senses: The Senses entry indicates whether the

creature  has  darkvision,  low-light  vision,  scent,

tremorsense,  blindsense,  blindsight,  or  some

other sensory special quality. This information is

followed by the creatures modifiers on Listen and

Spot checks (even if the creature has no ranks in

those skills).

Aura: Occasionally, a creature has a special ability

that  takes  effect  anytime  another  creature  comes

within a certain distance of it. Such abilities, such

as a blackguards aura of despair or a devils fear aura,

are detailed here.

Languages:  This  entry  gives  the  languages  the

creature speaks or understands, as well as any special

abilities relating to communication (such as telepathy

or tongues) that it possesses.

Defensive Information

This section provides the information you need when

characters are attacking the creature.

AC: This entry gives the creatures Armor Class

against  most  regular  attacks,  followed  by  its  AC

against touch attacks (which disregard armor) and

its AC when at-footed (or at any other time when it

is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC). If the creature

has feats or other abilities that modify its Armor

Class  under  specific  circumstances  (such  as  the

Mobility feat), they are noted here as well as in the

Feats entry.

hp: This entry consists of the creatures full normal

hit  point  total  (usually  average  rolls  on  each  Hit

Die), followed by the creatures Hit Dice in paren-

theses. If the creature has fast healing, regeneration,

damage reduction (DR), or some other ability that

affects the amount of damage it takes or the rate at

which it regains hit points, that information also

appears here.

Immune: Any immunities the creature has are

indicated here. This includes immunity to specic

types of energy as well as specic immunities (such

as immunity to poison or to sleep effects).

Resist and SR: If the creature has resistance to

certain kinds of attacks, that information is given

here.  Resistance  to  energy  is  shown  first,  as  the

energy type and the number of points resisted per

attack (acid 10, for example). This information is

followed by any other resistances the creature has.

Altered saving throw bonuses for specic circum-

stances  appear  on  this  line.  The  creatures  spell

resistance, if any, appears after the other resistances

on the same line.

Fort, Ref, Will: This entry gives the creatures

saving throw modiers.

Weakness: This entry details any weaknesses or

vulnerabilities the creature has, such as light sensitiv-

ity or vulnerability to a type of energy.

Offensive Information

Refer to this section when its the creatures turn to

act in combat. All its combat optionsfrom melee

attacks  to  spells  to  potions  it  might  drinkare

detailed in this section, even if they are not strictly

offensive in nature.

Speed: This entry begins with the creatures base

land speed, in feet and in squares on the battle grid.

Next come speeds for its other modes of movement,

if applicable.

Melee/Ranged: Typically, these entries give all the

physical attacks the creature can make when taking

a full attack action. The rst attack described is the

creatures preferred form of attack, usually a melee

attack of some sort but possibly (as in the example

below) a ranged attack. If the creature can make only

a  single  attack  (for  instance,  when  it  is  taking  an

attack  action),  use  the  rst  indicated  attack  bonus.

Occasionally, a creature has separate options indicated

for single attacks and for full attacks. For example, a

haling ranger with the Manyshot and Rapid Shot

feats might have the following entries:

Ranged +1 longbow +8 (2d6+2/3) with Manyshot or

Ranged +1 longbow +10/+10/+5 (1d6+1/3) with

Rapid Shot or

Melee mwk longsword +8/+3 (1d6/1920)

Each set of attack routines is prefaced by a boldface

word indicating whether the attacks are melee or

ranged. Next comes the weapon used for the attack,

the modied attack bonus, the amount of damage the

attack deals, and information about critical hits. If

the weapon has the default critical hit characteris-

tics (threat on a 20 and 2 damage), this portion of the

entry is omitted.

Space: This entry defines how large a square the

creature takes up on the battle grid. This informa-

tion  is  omitted  for  any  creature  that  occupies  a

5-foot square.

Reach:  The  Reach  entry  defines  how  far  the

creatures natural reach extends, and it also gives

information about any reach weapons it might use.

This information is omitted for any creature that has

a reach of 5 feet.

Base Atk: The Base Atk entry gives the creatures

base attack bonus without any modiers.

Grp: This entry gives the creatures grapple bonus

(base attack + size modier + Str bonus).

Atk Options: Special abilities that the creature can

employ to modify its normal attacks appear here. Such

abilities might include feats such as Power Attack or

Combat Expertise, or special abilities such as smite

evil or trip.

Special  Actions:  This  entry  gives  any  special

attacks that the creature can use on its turn in place

of making attacks.

Combat Gear: Possessions that the creature can

choose to employ on its turn as an action appear here.

Such  items  might  include  scrolls,  potions,  wands,

staffs, rods, or wondrous items.

Spells  Known:  This  entry  appears  only  for

sorcerers and members of other classes who do not

prepare  spells.  It  begins  with  the  creatures  caster

level  for  spells.  If  its  rolls  to  overcome  spell  resis-

tance are based on a number other than its caster

level (because the creature has the Spell Penetration

feat, for example), its total modier is given after the

expression spell pen. Spells known are listed from

highest level to 0 level, and each spell includes an

attack bonus and a saving throw DC, if appropriate.

If the character casts some spells at a different caster

level than others, that information is also specied

with the affected spells.

Spells  Prepared:  This  entry  appears  only  for

wizards, clerics, and members of other classes who

prepare spells. It begins with the characters caster

level for spells. If its rolls to overcome spell resis-

tance are based on a number other than its caster

level (because the creature has the Spell Penetration

feat, for example), its total modier is given after the

expression spell pen. Spells prepared are listed from

highest  level  to  0  level,  and  each  spell  includes  an

attack bonus and a saving throw DC, if appropriate.

If the character casts some spells at a different caster

level than others, that information is also specied

with the affected spells.

A  clerics  statistics  block  also  includes  the  name

of his deity (if applicable) and the domains to which

he has access. Each domain spell he has prepared is

marked with a superscript D. The granted powers

of  his  domains  might  appear  as  combat  options  or

resistances, or they might not appear at all, if they only

modify information presented elsewhere. For example,

a domain power that makes certain skills class skills

would not be detailed in the statistics block.

Spell-Like Abilities: Any spell-like abilities the

creature possesses appear here. The entry begins with

the creatures caster level for these abilities. As with

spells, this entry includes attack bonuses and saving

throw DCs where appropriate.

Other Information

Most  of  the  information  presented  in  this  section

is not relevant during a combat encounter with the

creature.  One  important  exception  is  explanatory

text for special abilities that appear elsewhere in the

statistics block.

Abilities:  The  creatures  ability  scores  appear

here  in  the  customary  order  (Str,  Dex,  Con,  Int,

Wis, Cha).

SQ: Any special qualities not presented earlier in

the statistics block appear here. These entries are often

class features or other abilities that are not generally

relevant in combat.

Feats:  This  entry  lists  all  the  feats  the  creature

possesses, including those that appear elsewhere in

the statistics block.

Skills: This entry shows all the skill modifiers

for skills in which the creature has ranks. Modifiers

are also provided for skills to which racial modi-

fiers,  bonuses  from  synergy,  or  other  modifiers

apply,  whether  or  not  the  creature  has  ranks  in

those skills.

Possessions: This entry is simply a list of items that

the creature is wearing or carrying. The expression

combat  gear  appears  first,  when  applicable,  to

remind  you  of  other  possessions  that  are  refer-

enced above.

Spellbook:  This  entry  gives  the  spells  in  the

creatures spellbook, if it has one. The notation spells

prepared plus indicates that the spells the creature

has prepared are part of this list, but are not reiter-

ated here.

The final portion of the statistics block consists

of paragraphs explaining special abilities noted in

the various entries above, in the order in which

they appear.

Roleplaying Hook

When appropriate, a Hook entry appears at the end

of a statistics block, set off in its own section. This is

a tidbit of information to help you run the creature

in  a   avorful  or  memorable  way.  Generally,  this

information is present only if the statistics block

describes a unique named character. It might be a

quote or a battle cry, or an indication of the kind of

characters the creature is most likely to attack. If

the descriptive text that accompanies a creatures or

characters statistics block includes facts about the

individuals behavior or outlook that could serve as a

roleplaying hook, the Hook entry is omitted. Such is

the case for the NPCs in the adventure seeds in this

chapterinformation that would normally appear

in the Hook section is provided in the descriptive

text of the encounter.

BLOODCRIERS HAMMER

Bloodcriers Hammer is an enormous warhammer forged

entirely from black iron. A grinning skull is etched

into the surface of the hammers head.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Large +1 warhammer;

Damage 2d6+1; Critical 3; Cost 2,324 gp; Weight 10

lb. Bloodcriers Hammer is a Large weapon. A Medium

creature can wield the hammer with two hands with

a 2 penalty on attack rolls. Small creatures cannot

use  the  hammer  without  some  special  ability  to

wield Large weapons (such as the Monkey Grip feat

described in the sidebar).

Omen: In any round of combat during which the

warhammer is not drawn and used, it cries and moans.

When the hammer is brought to bear in battle, red-

dish uid seems to seep from the engraved skulls

eye sockets.

HISTORY

Bloodcriers  Hammer  is  one  of  two  great  weapons

wielded by the ancient dwarven folk hero Bhazad

Khrar. (Khrars other legendary weapon is Blood-

criers Bow.) While the dwarves still refer to their hero

with the proper pronunciation, in wider circles the

name is remembered more for the properties of the

weapon than the original wielder. So, Bloodcrier

is the name that Khrar bears in many myths. Some

ascribe  hidden  powers  to  Bloodcriers  Hammer.  It

has been debated, however, whether these abilities

were in the hammer or were part of Khrars own

repertoire. (DC 15)

Bhazad  Khrar  is  the  supposed  descendant  of  a

mortal son of Moradin and was of mightier mettle

than  most  dwarves  of  his  age.  Many  exploits  are

attributed to Bloodcrier: founding a mine that pierced

to the center of the earth, discovering mithral ore, and

stemming an orc invasion. During mining explora-

tions, Bhazad Khrar won his warhammer by defeating

an entity known as an earthmagus. (DC 18; Trial

by Earth)

Once the weapon was his, Bhazad Khrar  woke

within  it  powers  greater  still.  Soon,  news  of  the

hammers theft from its earthmagus guardian reached

a  group  of  similar  beings  called  the  Conclave  at

the Heart. Upset at the theft and concerned at the

waking abilities of the hammer, the Conclave decided

to  recover  the  weapon  and  kill  its  wielder.  In

these tasks they were successful. (DC 25;

Mourning Service)

NEW FEAT: MONKEY GRIP

You are able to use a larger weapon than other people

your size.

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: You can use melee weapons one size category

larger than you are with a 2 penalty on the attack roll,

but the amount of effort it takes you to use the weapon

does  not  change.  For  instance,  a  Large  longsword  (a

one-handed weapon for a Large creature) is considered a

two-handed weapon for a Medium creature that does not

have this feat. For a Medium creature that has this feat,

it is still considered a one-handed weapon. You can wield

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

a larger light weapon as a light weapon, or a larger two-

handed weapon in two hands. You cannot wield a larger

weapon in your off hand, and you cannot use this feat with

a double weapon.

Normal:  You  can  use  a  melee  weapon  one  size  cat-

egory larger than you are with a 2 penalty on the attack

roll, and the amount of effort it takes to use the weapon

increases.  A  larger  light  weapon  is  considered  a  one-

handed weapon, a larger one-handed weapon is consid-

ered a two-handed weapon, and you cannot use a larger

two-handed weapon at all.

Huragam found the hammer within an erupted earth

cystan extrusion of elemental earthwhile on a

personal  vision  quest  out  in  the  barren  scablands.

Taking  the  discovery  of  the  weapon  as  a  sign,  he

returned  to  his  tribe  weak,  weary,  and  at  the  edge

of death. During Huragams recovery, he never once

relinquished  his  grasp  on  the  warhammer.  When

his  full  strength  nally  returned  to  him,  he  knew

the weapon was the tool he had long sought to carve

out an empire larger than any barbarian lord before.

Upon Huragams death a century later, the barbarian

shamans interred him with the hammer, despite his

insistence to the contrary. He believed that to do so

would allow the weapon to fall into the hands of what

he called vengeful spirits of stone and earth. (DC

31; Judgment of the Scablands)

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Blood-

criers Hammer.

Earthseeker (Su): At 6th level and higher, while

wielding Bloodcriers Hammer, you can detect any crea-

ture with the earth subtype within 60 feet. You must

concentrate (a standard action) to do so. The hammer

ignores any damage reduction an earth-subtype crea-

ture possesses.

Pathbreaker (Su): Beginning at 7th level, once per

day when Bloodcriers Hammer is struck against a lock,

lid, door, valve, portal, normal bars, shackles, chains,

bolts, and so on, a mournful tone rings forth. The

struck item opens 1 round later. Bloodcriers Hammer

also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even

an arcane lock with a caster level lower than 15th. Each

strike opens only one form of locking, so if a chest

is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it

30

takes four strikes to open it. A silence spell negates

this power.

Earthen Stature (Sp): You can change size while

standing on solid earth or stone. Starting at 8th level,

you can issue a command word to use enlarge person

once per day (self only) as the spell. At 12th level, you

can use this ability at will. Caster level 5th.

The Earth Provides (Su): At 9th level and higher,

you need not eat or drink while underground or in

any place with the earth-dominant elemental trait.

Deny Earths Embrace (Su): At 10th level and

higher, you need no longer fear the unforgiving crush

of the earth after a fall. This ability acts exactly like a

feather fall spell, and it is activated immediately if you

fall more than 5 feet. Caster level 5th.

Stony Resistance (Su): At 15th level, you gain a

+2 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

Meld into Stone (Sp): Beginning at 16th level, as a

swift action once per day, you can use meld into stone

as the spell. Caster level 10th.

Terra Obscura (Su): At 17th level and higher, while

you remain in contact with solid earth or stone, Blood-

criers Hammer cannot be detected remotely through

scrying, remote viewing, or other means of divination, as

if continually affected by the obscure object spell. Caster

level 15th.

Wall of Stone (Sp): Beginning at 18th level, two

times per day by holding Bloodcriers Hammer forth

and speaking a command word, you can use wall of

stone as the spell. Caster level 15th.

Earthwalkers Bane (Su): Starting at 19th level,

in your hands Bloodcriers Hammer has an effective

enhancement bonus +1 better than normal and deals

an extra 1d6 points of damage against any creature in

contact with solid earth or stone.

Ignore Earths Clutch (Su): At 20th level and

higher, you constantly gain the benet of a freedom of

movement spell while standing on solid earth or stone.

Caster level 15th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

into an earth cyst, which houses a spellcasting elemental

The party has entered this unholy place to retrieve

Earth Cyst

The  earth  cyst  has  erupted  into  the  tomb  vault.  It

resembles the interior of a geode.

The Earth Cyst in Eberron

In the cosmology of Eberron, there is no Elemen-

tal Plane of Earth. Instead, elemental beings are

native to Lamannia, the Twilight Forest, a realm of

unbridled nature. Lamannia is conterminous with

the Material Plane for one week every twelve months.

During this time, the power of nature is enhanced on

Eberron, and magic that summons elemental beings

is extended.

This  temple  to  elemental  earth  might  be  built

in a manifest zone that maintains a close connec-

tion with Lamannia. In this area, druidic magic is

extended. But when the Twilight Forest is cotermi-

nous, the elemental forces break through, forming

an earth cyst. The approach to the temple becomes

more  difficult  as  the  walls  of  the  passages  grow

and form new shapes in the stone, even spawning

earth elementals.

Another possibility is that the temple is af liated

with one of the Cults of the Dragon Below. Inside its

BONES OF LI-PENG

Certainly one of the more ghoulish weapons ever created,

the Bones of Li-Peng are exactly thatthe right arm-bones

of the famous monk Li-Peng, bound with sinew at the

elbow joint and fashioned into nunchaku.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics: +1  nunchaku;  Cost

2,302 gp. You gain a +1 bonus on one Concentration

check per day.

Omen: Despite their morbid looks, the Bones of Li-

Peng are not at all evil. In fact, the weapon radiates a

tangible aura of tranquility and calm.

HISTORY

Li-Peng  was  the  most  famous  sifu  (teacher)  at  the

Monastery of the Five Cherry Blossoms, a fabled site

of learning and enlightenment nestled high in the

mountains. This teacher is something of a folk hero

among the peoples living in and around the mountains,

although his true nature remains a mystery. The human

goatherds  in  the  valleys  and  lower  peaks  describe

Li-Peng as a human, while the dwarf miners, whose

outposts cling to the steep cliffs, call Li-Peng one of

their own. Regardless of Li-Pengs true origins, after

his death many of his personal effects gained reputa-

tions for possessing magical properties. (DC 15)

One  spring,  the  monks  of  the  Monastery  of  the

Five Cherry Blossoms sent the young acolyte Li-Peng

down into the village to purchase supplies, since the

long  winter  had  depleted  their  stores.  Laden  with

bolts of the  ne cloth the monks had woven, Li-Peng

took up his staff and began the trek down the moun-

tain. Halfway along his journey, he was accosted by a

terrible ogre who held a vicious but blind hell hound

on an iron chain. The ogre told Li-Peng the hound

would be set upon him if he didnt hand  over  the

goods he was carrying. Li-Peng simply smiled, said

that he had no fear of dogs, and made to continue

on his way. True to his word, the ogre released

his hound and ordered it to kill the monk, but

Li-Peng  was  too  quick.  The  nimble  ascetic

leapt into a tree and, running lightly along a

branch above his enemies, quickly pulled

off his robe and tossed it down over

the ogre. The hell hound was fooled

by the robes scent and fell upon

the ogre, tearing the giant limb

from limb. Li-Peng, mean-

while,  climbed  down

the tree and continued

on  his  way.  (DC  18;

Monks Cunning)

When Li-Peng was an older man, a peasant came to

the gates of the monastery to beg the monks aid. A

band of  erce brigands was terrorizing the villagers and

stealing their rice cropthe people had no rice with

which to pay their taxes. Li-Peng vowed to deal with

the bandits and set off toward the town with his trusty

staff in hand. At dusk that evening, the outlaws rode

into the settlement and demanded the daily harvest.

Li-Peng, looking small and unassuming in his orange

robe, stepped forward and told the robbers to depart

and  nd honest work, lest their souls suffer in the

afterlife. The thieves scoffed and  red their crossbows,

but with a twirl of his staff, Li-Peng knocked their

bolts away. The bandits, amazed by this display of skill,

nevertheless leapt to attack. The monk simply laughed

at them, for he was too nimble to be caught. Leaping

about like a hare, he struck the brigands repeatedly

with his staff, knocking them all senseless. When the

leader awoke after the  ght, Li-Peng harnessed him to

a donkey cart and made him pull the vehicle back to

the outlaws hideout. The stolen rice was recovered.

(DC 25; Martial Whirlwind)

At the twilight of Li-Pengs life, when he had been

master of the Monastery of the Five Cherry Blossoms

for many years, one of his students came to him and

asked why he didnt write his wisdom down for future

generations. Li-Peng grinned and repeated one of his

oft-quoted proverbsIf you meet the Enlightened

One  on  the  road,  kill  him.  The  pupil  pondered

this, realizing the master meant no person could

lead another to enlightenment. When the student

countered that at least Li-Pengs legendary martial

arts skills should be preserved, Li Peng replied, My

arms are my own. Only if they were yours would they

follow your road. Evidently, the younger monk took

Li-Pengs proverb a bit too literally. When

Li-Peng  was  dead  and

his  body  had  been

reduced to its skel-

eton, the young

monk  took

Li-Peng was a famous monk

whose armbones were transformed

into a set of magic nunchaku after his death

Tactical Notes

Suk  Chan  is  an  aggressive   ghter  who  takes  full

advantage of his own strengths and the terrain of

the battle eld. Against enemies with low AC that do

not have damage reduction against magic weapons,

he prefers to use his unarmed strike for its higher

damage. He reserves the Bones of Li-Peng for enemies

with better defenses.

The battle begins formally, with a strike of the gong.

The combatants begin 10 feet apart, 5 feet to each side

of the gong.

Round 1: If Suk Chan is not dazed from the gong

(see below), he moves to attack the challenged PC.

If  the  challenged  one  is  dazed,  the  monk  moves

in and attacks. Otherwise, if he wins initiative, he

charges and makes a stunning attack; if he does not

win initiative, he uses his  urry of blows and makes

a stunning attack.

Round 2 and Beyond: If an opponent is stunned by

a stunning attack, Suk Chan continues to batter with

 urry of blows, using one  urry attack for another

stunning attack. If the PC is wielding a one-handed

or two-handed weapon, Suk Chan might attempt to

initiate a grapple to deny the use of the weapon. His

relatively low Strength makes this a somewhat risky

move  unless  the  opponent  is  already  stunned,  but

Improved Grapple gives him an advantage and negates

attacks of opportunity.

BOW OF THE

BLACK ARCHER

The Bow of the Black Archer is a plain, unadorned

longbow made of solid black wood. Black leather

wrapped around the staff provides a rm grip, and

even the bowstring has been dyed black.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  +1  longbow;  Cost

2,375 gp. If drow come within 60 feet of the bow, the

whispers (see Omen, below) become more frequent

and angry, speaking of terrible vengeance on all

dark elves.

Omen: Though its appearance

is  unremarkable,  when  it  is

wielded, the bow intermit-

tently whispers softly

in  Elven  (audible

only  to  its  wield-

er), speaking of loss

and grief.

HISTORY

Shevarash  is

the elven deity

of revenge and

hatred  of  the

drow. Once, he

was a mortal elf,

famous  as  one

of  the  finest

archers in the

world. When

drow  raiders

attacked  his

village  and

slaughtered

his  family,  Shevarash  fore-

swore his former life, vowing to

never rest until the drow were purged from

the world. Shevarash slew many dark elves,

gaining infamy as the Black Archer in drow

folklore, before he was nally captured and slain.

Upon Shevarashs death, Corellon Larethian grant-

ed him the spark of the divine, transforming him

into a minor deity. (DC 15)

After  Shevarashs  passing  and  apo-

theosis, the bow he carried as a mortal

was lost for centuries, probably locked

away in the treasure vaults of the drow

priestess who had killed the Black Archer. Three hun-

dred years after Shevarash was made into a deity, one

of his devoted followers, a ranger called Valaderion,

n

began a crusade to recover the holy bow. He followed

in the footsteps of his god, venturing into the under-

ground lairs of the drow. Striking from the shadows

and never allowing himself to be detected, Vala-

derion slew every dark elf he came across. (DC

18; Hunter in the Dark)

Valaderion succeeded in recovering the Bow

of the Black Archer, and he journeyed toward the

surface with it. As he traveled upward, he met a

drow womanan exile named Kiralashaand

was forced to cooperate with her to destroy a nest

of beholders occupying tunnels they both

had to cross. As the pair worked together,

hatred gave way to grudging re-

spect, then to admiration, and

nally  to  love.  Torn  be-

tween the dictates of his

god and his feelings for

Kiralasha, Valaderion

decided to return the

bow  to  Shevarashs

clerics and retire for a

time to consider his

path. Sadly, he nev-

er got the chance.

As  soon  as  he  set

foot  inside  one  of

Shevarashs temples,

he  was  struck

down by the dei-

tys wrath, slain

for  daring  to

consort  with

one of the hat-

ed  drow.  (DC  25;

Purity of Enmity)

After Valaderions death, the Bow of the Black

Archer was kept safe in the most prominent of

all Shevarashs temples, and many clerics and

rangers made pilgrimages to see the weapon.

Seven centuries later, when drow once again

menaced elven lands, Salariel, the high priest-

ess of Shevarashs clergy, carried the bow into

battle. With the weapons help, she led

the mustered elven forces to victory but

was slain in a battle against a hideous

spider demon conjured by drow priest-

esses. The Bow of the Black Archer was

lost once again, presumably carried back into the

dark places of the earth by the retreating dark elves.

(DC 31; Legacy of Salariel)

The Bow of the Black Archer was

crafted to be the bane of drow

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of the Bow of the Black Archer.

Hunter in the Dark: You must stalk and kill at least

one drow whose Challenge Rating is at least equal to

your character level, initiating the conict without

rst being detected. Both mundane and magical forms

of concealment are acceptable. If the would-be target

detects you prior to your rst attack, the ritual fails.

Cost: 1,625 gp. Feat Granted: Least Legacy (Bow of the

Black Archer).

Purity of Enmity: Echoing the tale of Valaderion

and Kiralasha, you have to travel to the ruins of the

temple where Valaderion died, which are located in

the heart of a primeval forest. There you must perform

a three-day ritual of meditation and purication. If

you have had any peaceful interaction with a dark elf

within the past six months, this ritual automatically

fails. Cost: 13,500 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy (Bow

of the Black Archer).

Legacy of Salariel: Alone, you must kill a spider-

like demon (such as a bebilith or retriever) and a cleric

of Lolth. The demon must have a Challenge Rating

of 10 or higher, while the cleric must be 10th level

or higheran Encounter Level of 12 or more. You

can use any abilities at your disposal, but the Bow of

the Black Archer is the only weapon you are allowed.

Cost: 38,000 gp. Feat Granted: Greater Legacy (Bow of

the Black Archer).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Rangers or clerics of Shevarash get the most use out

of the Bow of the Black Archer, but any character who

weapon useful.

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of the Bow

of the Black Archer.

Drowseeker (Su): At 5th level and higher, while

wielding the Bow of the Black Archer, you can detect any

drow within 60 feet, although you must concentrate (a

standard action) to do so. The bow ignores any damage

reduction a drow possesses.

Eyes of Shadow (Sp): Beginning at 6th level, once

per day on command, you can use darkvision as the

spell. Caster level 5th.

Longstrider (Sp): At 8th level and higher, three

times per day on command, you can use longstrider

as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Hidden Hunter (Su): At 9th level, you gain a +5 com-

petence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

Solace  from  Weakness  (Sp):  You  gain  power

against the poisons and necromancy so commonly

used by drow. Starting at 12th level, two times per

day on command, you can use lesser restoration as the

per day on command, you can use shadow walk as the

spell. Caster level 11th.

Shocking Shot (Su): Beginning at 14th level, as a

standard action, you can imbue an arrow nocked on the

Bow of the Black Archer with electricity. If your shot with

this arrow hits, the arrow deals an extra 5d6 points of

electricity damage. This ability can be used ve times per

day, and a use is wasted if the charged arrow misses.

Deny the Demonweb Pits (Sp): Lolths servants

have many powerful allies in the Abyss. At 16th level

and  higher,  you  gain  a  measure  of  defense  against

them. Two times per day on command, you can use

protection from evil as the spell. Caster level 10th.

Escape the Spiders Bonds (Su): Webs and other

entanglements hold no more fear for a wielder of

the Bow of the Black Archer. Starting at 17th level,

you constantly benefit from the effects of freedom of

movement while you hold the bow in hand. Caster

level 15th.

Mindarmor  (Su):  At  18th  level,  you  gain  a  +3

insight bonus on Will saving throws to resist mind-

affecting and compulsion effects.

Fast Movement (Su): Once you attain 18th level,

your base land speed increases by 10 feet.

Pierce the Black Heart (Su): You and the Bow of

the Black Archer become the ultimate expression of

Shevarashs fury. At 20th level and higher, once per

day, you can re an arrow from the Bow of the Black

Archer that kills any drow struck by it, as if by a nger

of death spell. You must declare that you are using this

ability before making the attack. If the arrow misses,

the effect is wasted for the day. The save DC is 20, or

17 + your Charisma modier, whichever is higher.

Caster level 15th.

of their dark gods. Individual clerics spend their days drill-

ing, designing tactics for warfare in the Underdark, guard-

ing known entrances to the Underdark, and participating

in  hit-and-run  raids  and  major  assaults  on  drow-held

territories in the Underdark.

Clerics  of  Shevarash  pray  for  their  spells  at  dusk,

just before the drow sneak back into the lands of light.

Midwinter Night is observed by the cult of Shevarash in

memory of the Dark Court Slaughter,  a night  of infamy

during which drow armies boiled from the Underdark and

killed almost everyone attending a meeting between elves

and dwarves to renew their alliance. (Shevarashs family

was among the casualties of this raid.) On Midwinter Day,

those who wish to join the ranks of the clergy are inducted

into the faith and shout vows of unceasing vengeance into

the night. In honor of Shevarashs vow, they swear never

to laugh nor smile until their deitys sacred oath is fulfilled

and the drow, along with their dark gods, are expunged

from the world.

Shevarash is most closely allied with Fenmarel Mesta-

rine, the elven patron of outcasts and wild elves. Fenmarel

petitioned Corellon for Shevarashs apotheosis, and She-

varash spends much of his time in Fennimar, Fenmarels

forest realm. Shevarash has also allied himself with other

foes of Lolth as well as deities of revenge, including Cal-

larduran Smoothhands, Hoar, Shar, and Shaundakul. He

loathes the evil drow deities, Lolth and Vhaerun chief

among  them,  but  is  less  vindictive  toward  other  evil

deities of the Underdark.

See page 130 of the Faiths and Pantheons supplement

for more on Shevarash.

Shevarash is a member of the Seldarine, the Faernian pan-

theon of elven deities. He has no realm of his own but often

lurks in the rough mountainous regions of Arvendor.

Shevarash  is  taciturn,  violent,  and  consumed  by

thoughts of bitterness and revenge. He never displays

any emotion aside from anger and a brief exultation or

triumph after each victory. The Black Archer has no pa-

tience for those who do not share his zeal for vengeance,

and he has no interest in moderating his crusade in the

interests of peace. After the slaughter of his family by

drow,  he  swore  an  oath  to  Corellon  Larethian  that  he

would  neither  laugh  nor  smile  until  Lolth  and  all  her

followers were destroyed.

The  church  of  Shevarash  is  small  but  disciplined,  for

only through careful planning will the drow be destroyed.

The followers of Shevarash are consumed with their quest

to root out and destroy the drow and the sources of power

and left his home to take his revenge upon the dark

elves. He slew the members of a small, isolated drow

enclave, therein discovering the Bow of the Black Archer,

which he took up to continue his quest. Unfortu-

nately, the bows whispers have driven Khofar even

more insane, and he now attacks any humanoid he

meets, convinced each is a drow in disguise. The PCs

might gain Bow of the Black Archer by defeating Khofar

or by helping the poor dwarf regain his sanity. In this

latter case, he gladly gives up that accursed bow.

Judging from the style of the setting and the

form of the Elven letters in the inscrip-

tion, Bright Evening Star is of high-elf

craftsmanship. The name Alenea

might well be a reference to the

sorcerer Alenea, a legendary

elf hero of three millen-

nia ago. An adventurer

and a wanderer, Ale-

nea was the lover of

the wizard Eldarn-

iel, court magician

to  a  powerful  el-

ven  king  of  old.

Since Eldarniel was

a  legendary  crafter

of magic items, espe-

cially rings, it seems

likely  that  he  created

Bright Evening Star for Ale-

nea, perhaps to aid and protect

her on her travels. (DC 15)

Little  is  known  of  Aleneas

early life before she completed her magical training

and began her adventuring career. She was born in a

small shing village on the coast, and at a young age,

she entered one of the elves many spellcasting acad-

emies. When her studies were completed, she joined

up with an adventuring troupe along with another

young mage, Eldarniel. Together they explored an-

cient  ruins  and  plumbed  arcane  secrets,  but  their

chief passion was nding and cataloging the mystical

properties  of  moonlight  and  starlight.  Some  lore-

masters credit them with discovering silvers effects

on lycanthropes and crafting the rst ring of shooting

stars. Whether these claims are accurate or not, the

pair certainly revealed many potent magical effects

centered on the light of the moon and stars. (DC 18;

Starlight on Water)

After several decades of adventures, Alenea and El-

darniel went their separate ways. Alenea wanted to

continue traveling, while Eldarniel wanted to settle

down to focus on magical research. When the two

parted, Eldarniel gave Alenea Bright Evening Star. He

told her their love would last as long as the moonlight

and the stars. Alenea wore the ring constantly, but

she seldom called upon its powers. Because she rarely

used it and almost never spoke of it, Bright Evening

Star goes unmentioned in many stories about Ale-

nea. (DC 25; Love of the Stars)

Alenea continued adventuring for two

hundred years before she decided

to  retire.  She  then  returned

to  Eldarniel,  who  had  in

the  intervening  years

risen from skilled ar-

tificer to the position

of  court  mage.  The

two  were  married.

Some obscure texts

hint  that  Alenea

crafted  a  ring  with

powers of moonlight

for her husbands wed-

ding  band,  but  if  this  is

true,  no  other  tales  men-

tion  the  ring  and  it  has  been

lost to the ages. Sadly, the couples

bliss was short-lived. Just a decade

after  his  marriage,  Eldarniel  was

killed when one of his magical ex-

periments backred and destroyed

his entire lab. Alenea maintained

the hope that he had merely been

shunted to an alternate plane of existence, but she

nally  accepted  the  truth  after  years  of  searching.

She never remarried. When she died, her body was

placed next to Eldarniels empty tomb, but Bright Eve-

ning Star was not buried with her. What happened to

the ring remains a mystery. (DC 31, Return What

Was Lost)

functions much like sunbeam, but the light is pure,

focused starlight and moonlight. The beam deals no

extra damage to undead. Instead, lycanthropes take

damage from the beam as if they were undead being

affected by a normal sunbeam spell. Fungi, mold, oozes,

and  slimes  still  take  extra  damage  (as  if  they  were

lycanthropes). The save DC is 20, or 17 + your Charisma

modi er, whichever is higher. Caster level 15th.

Starlight Dispelling (Sp): At 18th level and higher,

once per day on command, you can use greater dispel

magic as the spell. If the dispelling attempt is initi-

ated by night under an unclouded sky, the associated

caster level check is made with a +5 bonus. Caster

level 15th.

Tales in the Sky (Sp): Many sages know that the

future can be read through the stars, but few realize

that, by tracing their movements backward, secrets

of long ago can be divined. Beginning at 19th level,

once per day on command, you can use legend lore as

the spell. You must be able to see the stars for this

ability to function. Caster level 15th.

Call Down a Star (Sp): At 20th level and higher,

once every other day on command, you can summon

an elder  re elemental. Caster level 17th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

While trekking through the forest one night, the PCs

spot a strange light off in the distance that seems to

beckon to them. The light is a will-o-wisp, which is

hovering over a grassy hillock in the center of the

swamp. Upon examining this mound, the victorious

adventurers  nd Bright Evening Star.

Will-o-Wisp: hp 40 (see page 255 of the Monster

Manual).

Hillock

This small island in the swamp is where Bright

Evening  Star  lies,  untarnished  despite  being  left  in

the mud. The island is actually a mound of tough,

knotted grass and thicker mud.

BULLYBASHERS

GAUNTLETS

Bullybashers Gauntlets are a pair of full plate metal gaunt-

lets that look well worn but are fully functional.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 gauntlets; Cost

4,604 gp.

Omen: Once per day, while wearing the gauntlets,

you can learn the most commonly used name

of any one creature by looking that creature in

the eyes. The target gets a Will save (DC 10

+ 1/2 your HD + your Wisdom bonus)

to negate the effect. This is a divina-

tion effect (caster level 3rd).

HISTORY

Pelt  was  the  scrawny,

illegitimate child of a

prostitute, and a target

for every bully in his

town.  He  earned  his

keep by cleaning shop

and  smelting  metal  for

a  local  blacksmith.  The

older boys of the streets

hunted poor Pelt down ev-

ery day, but the boy refused to cower

to anyone. It didnt matter how much the other

kids ganged up on him, he heeded his mothers words

and never fought back. Pelt didnt throw a single punch,

but his unwillingness to be intimidated earned him a

regular beating. While Pelt was healing from one par-

ticularly bad thrashing, his mother caught a seasonal

virus. The impoverished woman couldnt afford medi-

cine while Pelt was incapacitated, and the gang that

skimmed her pro ts wouldnt help either. She died, and

the blacksmith took Pelt in. When he recovered, Pelt

took a pair of discarded metal gloves from the black-

smith and began wearing them in public. These gloves

came to be known as Bullybashers Gauntlets. (DC 15)

The oversized gauntlets made Pelt a target right away,

which was exactly what he wanted. He watched the

faces of the street kids contort into ugly expressions

of greed as they rushed him. Outnumbered as usual,

Pelt fought back this time. He kept throwing punches

until each attacker had been  attened in turn, sending

boy after boy sprawling on the cobblestones. Pelt had

taken his thumps over the years, but he had learned

from each one. (DC 20; Knock Them Down)

It wasnt long before Pelts skills as a pugilist attracted an

unscrupulous merchant who organized bouts against the

young man for entertainment and pro t. Pelt fought in

turned a tormented

weakling into a champion

of the downtrodden

these  matches  only  to

save enough gold to leave

the city, but he drew the

attention of a powerful local

crime  gang  called  the  Green

Daggers. The gang wanted Pelt to muscle their tax

from the neighborhood businesses. Most storekeepers

paid  into  the  protection  racket  without  complaint,

except for a solitary blacksmiththe same one who

had raised Pelt after his mother died. Pelt de ed the

gang and defended his adoptive father. He proceeded to

take out every leg-breaker and assassin sent after him.

Taking this as a sign of weakness, the other gangs in the

local underworld made quick work of the remaining

Green Daggers. (DC 25; Call Them Out)

It was around this time that the local shop owners

approached Pelt and offered to pay him for his protec-

tion. Pelt accepted. The community was too large for

one man to look after, so Pelt recruited deputies from

among the townsfolk who used to bully him when

they were children. With their help, he organized

a militia to resist the new gangs that had formed

when the Green Daggers were dismantled. Without

realizing it, Pelt had decided to stay put. The city had

somehow become more appealing, and Pelt now felt

like he belonged. Under his stewardship, the com-

munity prospered. Pelt used much of his own wealth

to  nance a hospital for the poor, so poverty would

never again make the difference between one of them

living or dying. (DC 30; Build Them Up)

Knowledge (local) 2 ranks

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All  the  following  are  legacy  item  abilities  of  Bully-

bashers Gauntlets.

Sturdy Grip (Su): At 5th level, while wearing Bully-

bashers  Gauntlets,  you  gain  a  +4  bonus  on  opposed

grapple  checks  to  establish  a  hold  (but  no  other

grapple checks).

Knock Silly (Su): At 6th level and higher, when

you  deal  damage  to  an  opponent  with  Bullybashers

Gauntlets, that opponent is affected as if by the touch

of idiocy spell. You must decide whether or not to use

this ability before making the attack roll, and if you

miss, the attempt is wasted for the day. This ability is

usable two times per day. Caster level 5th.

Solitary Warrior (Su): Starting at 7th level, when

you  are  adjacent  to  at  least  two  foes  and  no  ally  is

within 30 feet, the effective enhancement bonus of

Bullybashers Gauntlets increases by 1 and you deal an

extra 1d6 points of damage with each successful attack

made with the gauntlets.

Cheat Death (Su): At 8th level and higher, you

automatically heal 1 hit point if your hit points drop

to between 1 and 9. This ability functions once

per day.

Power of One (Su): At 10th level, Bullybashers Gaunt-

lets grant a +2 enhancement bonus to your Constitution

score. At 14th level, the bonus rises to +4. It rises to

+6 at 18th level.

Rough and Tumble (Su): At 11th level, you gain

damage reduction 5/magic.

Giant Bearing (Su): Beginning at 13th level, you can

multiply your weight by 8, gaining a +2 size bonus to

Strength, a 2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum

of 1), a 1 penalty on attack rolls, and a +4 bonus on

grapple  checks.  You  double  your  carrying  capacity

and can grapple Huge creatures. You do not physically

become larger and do not gain a longer reach, nor do

you take size penalties on attacks, AC, and Hide checks.

This ability can be used at will and lasts 10 minutes

each time it is activated. Caster level 10th.

Stone Gathering (Su): At 15th level and higher,

when the giant bearing ability is activated, you can

hurl  rocks  weighing  40  to  50  pounds  each  (Small

objects) up to ve range increments. The range incre-

ment is 120 feet, and the rocks deal 2d6 (plus Strength

modier) points of bludgeoning damage.

This ability also allows you to catch Small, Medium,

or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once

per round, when you would normally be hit by a rock,

you can make a Reex save to catch it as a free action.

The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one,

and 25 for a Large one. If the projectile has a magic

enhancement bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases

by that amount. You must be ready for and aware of the

attack (not at-footed) to make a catching attempt.

Frightful  Presence  (Su):  Starting  at  17th  level,

when the giant bearing ability is activated, you unsettle

surrounding foes when you are attacking  or  charg-

ing. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet are subject

to the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than you. A

potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will

save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma

modier) suffers no ill effect and is immune to your

frightful presence for 24 hours. Those who fail the

save become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

No Wound Too Big (Su): At 18th level and higher,

while wearing Bullybashers Gauntlets, you heal 2 points

of damage every hour (1 point of damage per gauntlet).

This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill. Non-

lethal damage heals at a rate of 2 points of damage every

5 minutes (1 point of nonlethal damage per gauntlet). If

you lose a limb, an organ, or any other body part while

wearing Bullybashers Gauntlets, the gauntlets cause it

to grow back, as per the regeneration spell. In any case,

only damage you take while wearing the gauntlets is

healed or regenerated.

Lightning Punch (Su): Beginning at 19th level,

once per day on command, you can charge Bullybashers

Gauntlets with chain lightning. The next creature struck

by the gauntlets is the target of the spell, and second-

ary bolts can strike other foes within 30 feet. A charge

is maintained until the gauntlets strike a creature or

you discharge it harmlessly by touching  an  object.

The save DC is 19, or 16 + your Charisma modier,

whichever is higher. Caster level 15th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

Yulgor earned the right to wear Bullybashers Gauntlets

by defeating a goblinoid despot of his clan, but in so

doing  he  ended  up  being  much  like  the  tyrant  he

displaced. Now that Yulgor has unlocked the secrets

to his gloves, hes been throwing his weight around.

After laying waste to his own tribe, the bugbear forced

his way into a poorly defended town where he now

makes a nuisance out of himself, taunting the guards

and townsfolk. Nobody in the village has been able

to best the churl, so the leaders of the settlement ask

the heroes to solve their bugbear problem.

As the party enters the tavern, they can hear Yulgors

drunken roaring, demanding ale and challenging

all comers.

Tavern Brawl

Entranceway/Cloakroom

The walls are lined with hooks on which customers

clothes and weapons have been hung.

Stairs to Inn

Twenty guests currently occupy rooms on the upper

oor. The sounds of battle might attract the curious, or

those who just enjoy a good bar ght. (This might cause

the battle to spread, even spilling into other rooms.)

Kitchen

Pots are on the boil and meals are roasting in ovens

for the taverns patrons. Haunches of fresh wild game

hang from the ceiling.

Improvised Weapons: The kitchen contains many items

that are suitable as improvised weapons. Assorted cutting

utensils deal 1d4 points of piercing or slashing damage,

and tankards or pots deal 1d4 points of bludgeoning

damage. In a pinch, a haunch of meat can serve as a

club that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. The

contents of boiling pots can be hurled to deal 1d6 points

of scalding damage, requiring a ranged touch attack.

Bar

The bar connects with the kitchen area and also has

a countertop that ips upward.

Tavern Room

The room is lled with tables, but few customers

occupy them at the moment. Chairs have been thrown

aside roughly, and one long table is covered with

empty mugs and food scraps.

Improvised Weapons: The bar and tavern room are full

of items that can be used as improvised weapons. Bottles

deal 1d4 points of damage (bludgeoning if whole, slash-

ing if broken), tankards deal 1d4 points of bludgeoning

damage,. Legs can be broken off chairs to deal 1d6

points of bludgeoning damage. Chairs swung with two

hands deal 1d10 points of bludgeoning damage.

Yulgor

At the long table is the bugbear, who has been harass-

ing  tavern  customers  and  demanding  a  constant

supply of food and ale.

Tactical Notes

Yulgor is not only belligerenthes roaring drunk.

This has made him even more aggressive in combat

than normal, at the same time making him less inter-

ested in self-defense.

46

Round 1: When confronted, the bugbear lunges

from his chair and swings it at the offending char-

acter. This is an improvised weapon that counts as

a greatclub (1d10 points of bludgeoning damage, 4

penalty on attack roll). He doesnt use Power Attack,

since  it  is  an  impulsive  move  (and  he  cant  afford

additional attack penalties). This improvised weapon

still deals bonus sneak attack damage if that opponent

is at-footed.

Round  2:  If  Yulgor  acts  early  in  the  round,  he

hurls himself at the nearest character and attempts

to start a grapple. Assuming the character is within

5 feet, Yulgor makes two attacks: the rst to establish

a  grapple  and  the  second  to  smack  the  opponent

upside the head with Bullybashers Gauntlets. He uses

Power Attack if the opponent is lightly armored. He

also makes a knock silly attempt against an obvious

spellcaster, such as a cleric or sorcerer. If the opponent

is more than 5 feet away, Yulgor charges if possible.

Round 3 and Beyond: If the grapple (and knock

silly attempt, if used) is successful, Yulgor whales away

against the grappled opponent, using Power Attack

unless the opponent is wearing substantial armor. He

does not pull his punches.

CALADBOLG

Caladbolg is a leaf-bladed short sword. It is perfectly bal-

anced, and its edge seems to glitter hungrily when

it is wielded. Runic glyphs decorate the blade.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 short sword;

Cost 2,310 gp.

Omen: The runes on the blade of this leg-

acy item shift and change subtly each time

a new creature acquires the weapon, telling of

the new wielders exploits. The markings are

actually an archaic language, and they have now

shifted to tell of your heritage and deeds.

HISTORY

Caladbolg (hard lightning or hard belly)

is a legendary sword of heroes among the

barbarian tribes of the western forests.

According to their tales, it can be found

only when a great hero has need of it, and when

it is drawn in battle, no one can stand against it.

Stories featuring the sword often credit it with

cutting through armor, millstones, and even

a mountain in one notable case. Although

many  of  these  stories  are  certainly  mere

legends, Caladbolg does have many amazing

powers. (DC 15)

Caladbolgs  most  recent  owner  was

the deposed king of the western tribes,

Fergus.  Fergus  was  a  warrior-poet,

famous for his legendary virility as well

as his power in battle. As part of a ploy

to woo a woman named Neasa, Fergus

gave his throne to Neasas son for one

year. When Fergus tried to reclaim his

rightful  title,  the  temporary  king  and

Ferguss tribe alike refused to accept the

ruler  back.  Outraged  at  this  treachery,

Fergus  joined  forces  with  the  queen  of  a

rival tribe and went to war against his former

kingdom. (DC 18; Rite of the Stag)

The warrior Nuada was said to be the son of

a god, and he owned Caladbolg before Fergus.

With the aid of the sword, Nuada became

a great leader of his people and ruled them

wisely for many years. He was nally slain

in battle by Baloch, a half-end re giant

chieftain. Caladbolg was buried with Nuada. Tales say

the gods reclaimed it, hiding the blade until a hero again

has need of its power. (DC 25; Slaying Baloch)

Nuada was indeed the half-mortal child of a god,

Lir, who crafted Caladbolg as a gift for the ancient

king. A sea deity worshiped by the western barbar-

ians, Lir is a mysterious entity who claims to be the

oldest of his pantheon. He is portrayed not only as a

keeper of many secrets and mysteries, but also as a

benevolent protector and guardian of the Blessed

Isles where the spirits of the dead dwell. Many

of the greatest heroes of the western tribes

legends are said to be the foster children of

Lir. (DC 31; Rite of the Seas Child)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Caladbolg.

Rite of the Stag: To the western barbarians,

the stag is a symbol of virility and fertil-

ity, but the name of this ritual is actually

a sly nod toward Ferguss reputation. To

pass this rite, you have to emulate the de-

posed king of legend by successfully wooing at

least ve persons in a 24-hour period. No physical

intimacy need occuryou merely need to im-

prove the attitudes of the ve selected persons

from neutral to friendly (see the sidebar Inu-

encing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Players

Handbook). You can accomplish this task by

using skills, performing deeds, or even cast-

ing spells. Cost: 1,700 gp. Feat Granted: Least

Legacy (Caladbolg).

Slaying Baloch: You must face a giant,

with a CR equal to your level or higher (max-

imum CR 16), in single combat. Caladbolg

must be your only weapon, but you can use

any spells, abilities, or other magic items you

possess. Cost: 13,500 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser

Legacy (Caladbolg).

Rite of the Seas Child: You are required

to seek the blessings of Lir. To do so, you

must travel out to sea for a days journey be-

yond sight of land, wrap yourself in heavy

iron chains, and leap into the water. You must

then survive at the bottom of the ocean for

one day, facing whatever challenges Lir poses,

from hungry aquatic monsters to mysteri-

ous puzzles. Cost: 38,000 gp. Feat Granted:

Greater Legacy (Caladbolg).

Caladbolg comes to the aid

of a great hero in need

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Barbarians, ghters, and rangers get the most use out

of Caladbolg, but any character who focuses on melee

combat will find the sword a welcome addition to

his arsenal.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

While traveling through a forested land, the explorers

hear of Caladbolg and its fey guardian. That sentinel is

Kyrotates, a satyr. Kyrotates fancies himself a erce

combatant  and  challenges  any  who  cross  his  path,

secondarily guarding a faerie ring from trespassers

and Caladbolg from the unworthy. Hes not interested

in  battling  to  the  death,  though,  and  any  warrior

who can best the mighty satyr in one-on-one combat

wins Caladbolg. Kyrotates uses his bard abilities only

when  threatened  by  multiple  opponents  and  does

not possess pipes.

Anyone stepping into this ring of standing stones feels

a strange, giddy sensation. This magically induced

emotion is a mind-affecting effect, and it has an equal

chance of granting someone a +1 morale bonus or a

1 morale penalty on attack rolls and saving throws.

(Roll d%: 0150 grants the bonus; 5100 grants the

penalty).  This  effect  lasts  as  long  as  the  character

remains in the circle and an additional 1d6 rounds

after she leaves it. A stone can be knocked over with

a DC 20 Strength check, which immediately ends any

active effects and enrages Kyrotates. The satyr attacks

the character who knocked over a stone.

Oak Trees

These oak trees are easy to climb (Climb DC 5), and

their thick foliage grants concealment to creatures in

their branches. They also make excellent vantage points

for snipers. Anyone attempting to  re a longbow must

either take a 2 penalty on attack rolls due to the awk-

wardness of  ring from a sitting position or make a DC

15 Balance check each round to stand on a branch.

Pool

This pool is shallow around the edges but deepens to

15 feet rapidly. Moving through the squares that make

up the edge of the pool counts as moving through

dif cult terrain. Any character who travels more than

1 square into the pool must begin to swim.

CAPUT MORTUUM

Caput Mortuum is a grim, somber-looking scythe with

a haft of wood charred so badly that it resembles little

more than charcoal. The blade

is made of a luster-

less gray metal

and is wholly

unadorned,

except  for  a  lone

glyph engraved on each

sidea circle with three

small dots arranged in

a V shape.

The deadly scythe Caput Mortuum

was the object of a struggle between

the cults of Wee Jas and Nerull

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 scythe; Cost 2,318

gp. The V glyph glows a soft red whenever undead

are within 60 feet of you.

Omen: The wood of the haft crumbles away as the

weapon is wielded, but the weapons durability is

unaffected.

HISTORY

Caput Mortuum (the name means Life-

less Head) is a legendary weapon in the

lore of the followers of Nerull, the deity of

death. Tradition says a shadow original-

ly crafted it, and the scythe has claimed

the lives of many heroes in its time. The

weapon has the ability to drain victims

of everything strong and pure, leaving

them nothing more than desiccated

husks. Many additional abilities have

been attributed to Caput Mortuum in

bards tales, and it might well harbor

hidden secrets. (DC 15)

Forged  seventy-five  years  ago

by a powerful cleric of Nerull,

Caput Mortuum was intended

as a great weapon for the high

priest of the death gods clergy.

But  it  never  reached  the  high

priests hands. The cleric who forged

it  was  attacked  and  slain  by  shad-

ows in his stronghold on the Plane

of Shadow. The fortress fell into ruin,

and the scythe remained within for a

time.  A  necromancer  discovered  the

weapon as he was exploring the crum-

bling edi ce. Since Caput Mortuum required divine

spell casting knowledge to fully unlock its potential,

the necromancer sold the weapon to the church of

Wee Jas. (DC 18; Blessing of the Goddess)

Wee Jass clergy gave Caput Mortuum to a traveling

acolyte who was undertaking a journey through gnoll-

infested badlands. Whether the acolyte was slain by

gnolls or simply betrayed his church

and fled with the scythe is

unknown. What is known

is  that  the  priests  of  Wee

Jas never saw Caput Mortuum

again. Many search parties were

sent out and numerous bounties

posted, but it was as though the

scythe had vanished from the face

of the world. (DC 25; Dweller

in Darkness)

The true fate of the scythe is un-

recorded,  except  in  a  lone  account

written by a wanderer. This scroll is

now stored in the library of a monastery

dedicated to Boccob. The acolyte of Wee

Jas ran afoul of the vile cult of Nerull, which

stole the scythe and murdered the acolyte in

one of their dark, blasphemous rituals. Shortly

thereafter, a schism within the cult ended in the

deaths of all but two of the cultists. One of these two

took Caput Mortuum and  ed into the northern lands,

where he submerged himself in the seedy underworld

of criminal guilds and secret conspiracies. There he

founded a new cult of the death god, based around the

supreme authority of the wielder of Caput Mortuum.

(DC 31; Terrible Vengeance of Wee Jas)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Caput Mortuum.

Blessing  of  the  Goddess:  You  must  travel  to  a

temple dedicated to Wee Jas, the deity of death and

magic,  to   nd  a  cleric  capable  of  casting  commune.

The  cleric  must  use  the  spell  to  determine  if  Wee

Jas thinks you are worthy to wield Caput Mortuum,

passing on her af rmative answer as a blessing from

her church. Cost: 1,200 gp. Feat Granted: Least Legacy

(Caput Mortuum).

Dweller in Darkness: You have to journey to the

Plane of Shadow and survive there for three whole

days. You can use any spells, magic items, or other

abilities at your disposal. The ritual fails if you die

before the end of this time. Cost: 11,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Lesser Legacy (Caput Mortuum).

Terrible Vengeance of Wee Jas: You are required

to perform an act of retribution against Nerulls sect.

To do so, you must track down and kill a cult of the

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

Evil clerics are the most likely to nd Caput Mortuum

useful. Blackguards can easily meet the requirements

to wield the weapon, but they wont gain legacy abili-

ties past 13th level without taking levels in another

spellcasting  class.  Because  blackguards  only  ever

cast 4th level spells, they will not be able to fulll

the personal cost of sacricing a 5th-level or higher

spell slot.

The following is a legacy item ability of Caput Mortuum.

Soul Servant (Su): Beginning at 7th level, the souls

of those you have slain with Caput Mortuum linger,

acting as the unseen servant spell. They dissipate if they

take 6 or more points of damage, or if they move more

than 35 feet from you. In such an event, the servants

re-form 1 round later in an adjacent square to you.

Caster level 5th.

ALTERNATIVE PROGRESSION FOR

CAPUT MORTUUM

Caput  Mortuum  has  a  very  straightforward  legacy  pro-

gression,  becoming  an  increasingly  dangerous  weapon

as  its  wielder  advances  in  level.  However,  it  does  not

gain other special abilities beyond soul servant. Players

and DMs might wish to customize this item with unique

legacy  abilities.  One  possible  alternative  progression  is

described  below.  This  progression  slows  the  weapons

damaging ability slightly and grants it  additional death-

dealing powers.

The progression is the same until the wielder reaches

11th level, at which time the weapons new abilities are re-

vealed in the following sequence. (Personal costs remain

the same as on Table 38.)

Slaughtering Swing (Sp): At 11th level, three times per

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

day, you can deliver a death knell effect as the spell when

you  strike  a  successful  blow  with  Caput  Mortuum.  You

must declare you are using the ability before making the

attack roll; a miss wastes the effect. The save DC is 13, or

12 + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. Caster

level 11th.

+3 Vicious Scythe: At 13th level, you wield Caput Mor-

tuum as a +3 vicious scythe.

+4 Vicious Scythe: At 15th level, you wield Caput Mor-

tuum as a +4 vicious scythe.

Blade  of  Destruction  (Sp):  At  17th  level,  once  per  day

when you issue the command word bloodwind and ges-

ture with Caput Mortuum, you can kill one living creature,

as the finger of death spell. The save DC is 20, or 17 + your

Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. Caster level 17th.

+5 Unholy Vicious Scythe: At 19th level, you wield Caput

Mortuum as a +5 unholy vicious scythe.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

Shrine to Nerull

While exploring an underground catacomb, the PCs

discover that one of the tombs has been converted into

a shrine to Nerull (or another death god appropriate to

the campaign). Worshiping at this shrine is a 5th-level

cleric of Nerull who wields Caput Mortuum. This cleric

has  ve human warrior skeletons attending him.

Altar

This altar to Nerull is decorated with profane symbols

and caked with the blood of sacri cial victims. The

altar is the center of a desecrate spell, which bolsters

the skeletons under Ertaks control. Protecting the

altar is Ertaks primary objective.

Burial Niches

Within  these  stone  niches  are  skeletons.  If  given

a  chance  to  prepare  for  or  recover  from  an  attack,

Ertak uses his scroll of animate dead to mobilize these

skeletons and turn them on the PCs. Also within each

niche is a piece of jewelry worth 200 gp. Most of these

baubles are still worn by the skeletons.

Urns

These ceramic urns are  lled with cremated remains.

Each urn has a hardness of 2 and 5 hit points. Shat-

tering an urn stirs up a 10-foot-radius cloud of ash

that persists for 2 rounds and grants those within it

concealment (20% miss chance). Characters within

the cloud must make a DC 10 Fortitude save to keep

from being sickened.

CELDORIATHS CLARION

This  delicate-looking,  spiraled  silver  trumpet  is

inlaid  with  intricate  Elven  script,  which  translates

as giving succor and friends shall answer the call.

The mouthpiece is pale ivory, and an emerald-studded,

leather baldric allows the horn to be slung over the

carriers shoulder.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Celdoriaths Clarion;

Cost 2,500 gp. You gain a +5 competence bonus on

Perform checks made with this instrument.

Omen: Any music played on Celdoriaths Clarion is

clear, sweet, and hauntingly beautiful. Furthermore, the

instrument never tarnishes or shows any sign of

wear during regular useit remains as bright

and unsullied as the day it was created.

HISTORY

Celdoriaths Clarion appears to be an elven

scouts horn, albeit an ornate and high-

quality one. Outriders, rangers, and

other advance units of elven armies

carry such horns. Used to maintain

communication and summon aid over

long distances, these instruments are

usually simple affairs made of horn

or brass. Celdoriaths Clarion clearly be-

longed to a wealthy or in uential

scout, or one who

was rewarded for

some  great  ser-

vice to the elven

people. Elf kings

and  nobles  give

only their most loyal

scouts  silver  trum-

pets, and then only in

recognition of some

truly heroic act. Few such instruments are ascribed

magical properties in the elven histories. Clearly, Cel-

doriaths Clarion is something extraordinary. (DC 15)

Celdoriath was a ranger serving as a scout in the forces

of the elven king Aldonar, the ruler of an enormous

forest realm. Though he was merely a low-ranking

soldier in his kings army, Celdoriath was in love with

King Aldonars daughter, Indiriel. More signi cantly,

the princess loved Celdoriath in return. Her father

refused  to  allow  her  to  marry  so  far  below  her  sta-

tion, however. Resigned to love from afar, Celdoriath

abandoned his hopes of marrying Indiriel and threw

himself into his duties. He spent three months tracking

an orc horde along the borders of the forest during a

Celdoriaths Clarion awaits a ranger

who proves worthy of its heroic legacy

 erce winter blizzard. Three elves under his command

froze to death, but Celdoriath was able to gather enough

intelligence on the orcs movements and deployment

that  the  regular  army  routed  them  with  minimal

casualties.  In  recognition  of  his  service, Celdoriath

was awarded a silver trumpet and the honorary title

Knight  Guardian  of  the  Realm.  Along  with  this

honor, however, he was reprimanded and discharged

from King Aldonars army for the reckless sacri ce of

his three subordinates.

The  king  could  not

ignore  Celdoriaths

heroic  deeds,  but  he

didnt  want  the  scout  to

rise to a high enough rank to

petition for Indiriels hand in mar-

riage. (DC 18; Watchers Vigil)

While  he  was  disgusted  and

embittered by his kings actions, Cel-

doriath could not bring himself to leave

his home or the woman he loved. With

no formal military rank, he signed back

on with Aldonars army as a mercenary,

performing the same duties he had always

carried out. Now, however, he was looked on

as little more than a dog that might turn on its

master at any moment. Mercenaries were disliked

at best in the elven military, and Celdoriaths presence

was tolerated only because of his skill and the renown

he had won from the incident with the orcs. Though

he was sneered at by the of cers, most of whom were

drawn from the nobility and were perfectly aware of

the real reason Celdoriath was discharged, the rang-

ers keen mind and knowledge of woodcraft won him

friends and allies among the enlisted soldiers. Three

years into his tour as a mercenary, Celdoriath was on

patrol deep in the heart of an uninhabited region of

the forest. There, a huge section of ground collapsed

inward, revealing a subterranean cavern out of which

boiled thousands of drow and their arachnoid servants.

Surrounded and cut off from any hope of escape, Cel-

doriath raised his silver trumpet to his lips and blew

a long, clear blast. Much to his surprise, not only was

the call answered, it was answered in forcea brigade

of elf mages had been training in the region, and with

their potent magic, they were able to contain the drow

assault and drive the dark elves back underground.

(DC 25; Prayer of Thanksgiving)

After saving the kingdom from certain destruction

twice, Celdoriath could no longer simply be brushed

aside by King Aldonar. Reluctantly, the king restored

Celdoriaths  rank  and  status,  removing  the  only

obstacle to the rangers marriage to Indiriel. The couple

were at long last wed, a century and a half after they

rst met, and their child was named the royal heir-

designate. King Aldonar died in the childs fth year.

(Some claimed his death was the result of assassination,

even placing the blame on the kings own daughter).

With the child still far too young to take the throne,

Celdoriath ruled as regent for the next hundred years.

The former scout proved a surprisingly able and adept

ruler, drawing on his experience to initiate sweeping

reforms  in  the  kingdoms  armies  and  improve  their

readiness  against  drow  incursions  and  orc  raids.  He

was no less adroit at the arts of statecraft, forging a last-

ing peace with the dwarves who dwelt on the forests

northern borders, negotiating a mutual defense treaty

with the human nations to the south, and even easing

strife between the elven subraces.

When  his  son  came  of  age,  Celdoriath  gracefully

stepped down as regent and retired completely from

politics. He and Indiriel settled into a home on the

outskirts of the forest, where Celdoriath could once

again live the life of a simple ranger. When Celdoriath

died many decades later, his son sounded Celdoriaths

Clarion at his fathers funeral, announcing to the afterlife

that a great hero was arriving. The horn remains in the

royal treasure vault, to be given to a ranger who proves

himself worthy of Celdoriaths legacy. (DC 31; Oath

of Fealty)

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Celdoriaths

Clarion.

Strengthen Morale (Su): Beginning at 5th level,

whenever Celdoriaths Clarion is sounded, all your allies

within hearing range are heartened and encouraged,

gaining the benets of a bless spell for 1 minute. Caster

level 5th.

Fell Blast (Sp): At 6th level and higher, by blowing

a harsh note, you demoralize all your foes within 50

feet as if by the bane spell. The save DC is 11, or 11 +

your Charisma modier, whichever is higher. Caster

level 5th.

Summon  Least  Ally  (Sp):  For  the  wielder  of

Celdoriaths Clarion, aid is always close at hand. Starting

use summon monster III as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Call Compatriot (Su): At 9th level and higher, once

per day, you can sound a mighty blast on Celdoriaths

Clarion.  This  blast  sends  a  call  out  to  any  creature

you designate that is within 5 miles. The designated

creature automatically hears the call, knows you are

in need, and knows how to nd you, but it is under

no compulsion to answer. You gain no knowledge of

whether or not the target is answering the call.

Heartening  Call  (Sp):  Starting  at  11th  level,

on Celdoriaths Clarion. This trill acts as an aid spell

upon a single eligible target within 50 feet (including

yourself). Caster level 5th.

times per day, you can sound a buzzing blast to use

summon swarm as the spell. Caster level 10th.

Phantasmal Blast (Sp): Beginning at 17th level,

by sounding a particularly bleak and terrifying blast

on Celdoriaths Clarion, you can use phantasmal killer

as the spell. The save DC is 16, or 14 + your Charisma

modier,  whichever  is  higher.  You  can  sound  this

note three times per day. Caster level 15th.

Summon Greater Ally (Sp): At 18th level and

higher, once every other day, you can blow a note on

Celdoriaths Clarion that acts as a summon monster IX

spell. Caster level 17th.

Call Divine Ally (Su): Starting at 20th level, you

can blow Celdoriaths Clarion once per month to call

a ghaele eladrin (see page 94 of the Monster Manual)

from the heavenly realms. This being serves you faith-

fully for 1 hour. If the ghaele is slain, the horn loses

its legacy abilities until you once again complete the

Oath of Fealty ritual.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

While visiting the court of Celdoriaths kingdom, the

PCs are invited to be present at a celebration honoring

the seventy-fth year of his sons reign. During the

celebration, a cadre of drow storm the palace, seeking

to murder the king. Six 1st-level drow warriors led by

a swashbuckler named Xipharis make up this band,

and they strike from two directions at once. If the

party tries to protect the king, then once the battle is

over, the king thanks them for saving his life (or the

highest-ranking noble in attendance thanks them for

doing their best to thwart the assassination) and offers

the PCs Celdoriaths Clarion in gratitude.

and  try  to  avoid  getting  bogged  down  in  combat

with other targets. Xipharis leads the  rst wave and

draws plenty of attention to herself with  amboy-

ant maneuvers. If she cant get close enough to the

king to make melee attacks, she tries a shot with

her hand crossbow.

Drow Warriors (6): hp 6, 7, 8, 6, 5, 7 (see page 102 of

the Monster Manual).

Ballroom

Xiphariss  mission  is  to  kill  the  king,  not  to  get

entangled in other fights. Once she and her band

have accomplished this task, they leave as quickly as

possible through the open windows. If they are unable

to assassinate the king, Xipharis aborts the mission.

The drow warriors cover her escape.

The  ballroom  is  sumptuously  furnished,  with

carpets, heavy drapes, crystal chandeliers, and the

like. Twin staircases run to the upper dais. Xipharis

uses  this  terrain  to  best  advantage  for  cinematic

swashbuckling moves.

First Attack Wave

The first team of drow crashes through this window

and dashes straight for the king. They carry rapiers

Second Attack Wave

The second group of drow, armed with hand crossbows

and poisoned bolts, slips quietly through this window

(making  Hide  and  Move  Silently  checks)  and  uses

the chaos caused by the  rst team to take shots at the

king and those guarding him. (A sleeping king makes

a  great  target  for  the   rst  wave.)  If  they  manage  to

accomplish this without coming under attack, they

attempt to take down other prominent  gures. As soon

as attention turns to them, they depart.

Statues

These statues are large, heavy sculptures of granite

and marble. They can be tipped, however, with a DC

25  Strength  check.  Knocking  over  a  statue  creates

a domino effect, and anyone standing adjacent to

a statue (or between two statues) must succeed on a

DC 16 Re ex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning

damage.

CORALS BITE

Corals Bite is a bright, turquoise-blue tri-

dent with serrated edges, grown from the

hardest coral of the ocean. The sawlike

edges of the tridents prongs account

for the slashing damage this weapon

can deliver.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:

+1 trident; Cost 2,315 gp; can deal

piercing or slashing damage.

Omen: You do not take nonlethal

damage from exposure to cold water,

and you take 1d6 points of damage per

200 feet of water depth instead of per

100 feet (see Water Dangers, page 304

of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

HISTORY

Sajolveun was the  nest example of every-

thing  decent  and  right  about  aquatic

elven culture. He represented the best

of his pod, as both a strong warrior and

a tempered thinker. Devoid of ambition,

Sajolveun was intent on doing whatever

furthered the welfare of his people be-

fore serving his own interests. He led

soldiers against invasions of sahuagin

on multiple occasions, beating them back

every time. Because of Sajolveun, the local

currents were safe not only for aquatic elves,

but also for the undersea community at large.

It came as no surprise when the elders fash-

ioned a trident made from the hardest coral

in the known seas and gave it to Sajolveun

as a reward for his tireless efforts. The presen-

tation of Corals Bite was a great honor. It was

also  cause  for  celebration  among  common

aquatic elves. Sajolveun had risen quickly in

power and prestige, despite his humble begin-

nings. (DC 15)

It was often said that Sajolveun came a long

way in a short time, evolving quickly from a

sullen introvert who lived in self-exile to a

singular hero. Even the weapon he wielded

acknowledged his status, protecting him in

battle with an exoskeleton of coral. Sajolveun

attributed his change of heart to the lone-

liness of his previous existence. He

found  greater  fulfillment  in  being

with his kin, rather than being apart

from them. Many remarked that all

Sajolveun had failed to do for

the  good  of  his  people  was

take a wife, ensuring his blood-

line  would  continue.  Many

women were certainly willing,

but  Sajolveun  always  dodged

the  subject  by  making  him-

self busy with work. He didnt

avoid the issue because he wasnt

fond of childrenhe thought they

were wonderful. He didnt avoid the

matter because he wasnt attracted to

aquatic  elf  women.  He  found  them

extremely fetching. In fact, there was

no part of aquatic elven culture that

Sajolveun  didnt  love  more  than  his

own, because Sajolveun was not an

aquatic elf. He was a doppelganger

whose real name was Ildashurn. (DC

20; Hero of the Pod)

Long ago, Ildashurn had taken the

form of a kuo-toa to travel underwater,

not realizing they were a species reviled by

other aquatic beings. The  rst aquatic elf

Ildashurn met attacked him on sight, com-

pelling  him  to  defend  himself  with  lethal

force. As the elf died, Ildashurn frantically read

his mind and realized the misunderstanding.

Ildashurn also learned the elfs name. It was

Sajolveun. Feeling guilty, the doppelgang-

er studied the elfs life from his underwater

home, adopted Sajolveuns identity, and returned

to  the  aquatic  elves.  Ildashurn  did  everything  in

his power to amend the mistake he had made. In

so doing, however, he fell in love with the aquatic

elves and became their hero. Even his legendary

weapon had embraced him completely. When Il-

dashurn could no longer politely avoid the topic

of marriage, he announced that he would be leav-

ing to ful ll a personal quest, promising to take a

wife upon his return. Privately, Ildashurn had no

intention of returning. When he reached the sur-

face and tried changing back into an air-breathing

creature, the doppelganger discovered that he could

not. He was no longer a shapechanger. Somehow,

he had become an aquatic elf. Perhaps it was some

strange effect of his tridents power, or perhaps it

was the act of some benevolent deity.

Ildashurn didnt care. He just smiled

and dove back into the water. (DC 25;

All the following are legacy item abilities of Corals

Bite.

Dolphins Breath (Su): Beginning at 6th level,

you can go an entire hour without needing to take a

breath. However, if you dont get a breath after that

hour elapses, you must hold your breath or begin

to drown (see Drowning, page 304 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Coral Armor (Su): At 7th level, you can command

the coral from which Corals Bite is formed to envelop

you in a protective exoskeleton while you wield the

trident. The coral armor does not hinder you in any

way, and it grants a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor

Class. The natural armor bonus increases to +2 at 9th

level and to +3 at 14th level.

Water Breathing (Su): At 12th level and higher,

you can breathe water freely, as if constantly under the

effect of a water breathing spell. Caster level 10th.

ing enemies of the aquatic elves, have long feared

Corals Bite. To acquire the weapon for her people, a

malenti (a sahuagin mutant that perfectly resembles

an aquatic elf) inltrated an aquatic elf community

and assassinated the most recent wielder of  Corals

Bite. The malenti delivered Corals Bite to Nekulis, a

sahuagin champion. If the PCs commit to recover-

ing the weapon, they have to venture into hostile

territory  and  assault  Nekuliss  personal  outpost.

There, after defeating the sahuagin ghter and his

three companions, the PCs can claim Corals Bite.

munication is limited to fairly simple concepts such

as food, danger, and enemy. Nekulis can use

the Handle Animal skill to befriend and train sharks.

Freshwater Sensitivity (Ex) A sahuagin fully immersed

also gains two rake attacks while swimming.

Blood Frenzy (Ex) Once per day, when he is damaged

in combat, Nekulis can fly into a frenzy in the fol-

lowing round, clawing and biting madly until either

he or his opponent is dead. He gains +2 Strength

and +2 Constitution, and takes a 2 penalty to AC.

Nekulis cannot end his frenzy voluntarily.

Skills Can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check.

Can use the run action while swimming in a

straight line.

Sahuagin (3): hp 13, 10, 12 (see page 217 of the

Monster Manual).

Sahuagin Outpost

The sahuagin outpost is an underwater tower carved

out of an ocean shelf. It has four levels. A circular

opening in the middle of each level allows the sahua-

gin to swim between oors.

Top Floor

This is a lookout post. Its walls are pieced by arrow

slits. Two sahuagin are on guard here; when intruders

approach, one alerts the remaining sahuagin while

the other snipes at the enemy.

Middle Floor

This oor contains sleeping areas, consisting of beds

of seaweed. Sahuagin who are not on guard (including

Nekulis) usually rest here.

Bottom Floor

This level contains the armory, as well as a mechanism

for sealing the tower entrances when under attack. As

a counterweight rises, four gates drop down to seal off

the four entrances to the sublevel. Murder holes in the

oor allow defending sahuagin to re on intruders. The

central opening can be covered with a sliding panel.

Sublevel

Four  tunnels  dug  from  the  ocean  shelf  lead  into

this chamber.

waters.  Although  some  tribes  are  ferocious  and

cant  be  reasoned  with,  many  adopt  a  pragmatic

attitude toward seafaring peoples and operate guide

services. Through malenti go-betweens, these sahua-

gin negotiate trade deals with other raceseven

aquatic elves.

In such a setting, Corals Bite is not necessarily an

object of fear to sahuagin. In fact, nothing prevents

a sahuagin from wielding the trident in any setting,

although  its  monstrous  humanoid  bane  ability  is

dangerous  to  the   sh-people.  It  might  even  be  the

signature weapon of a great sahuagin hero instead of

an aquatic elf. To customize Corals Bite, its bane ability

might instead target animals (such as horrid orca) or

magical beasts (such as  endish squid).

On the other hand, many sahuagin revere the dark

god known as the Devourer, lord of the violent forces

of nature. They take their worship to literal extremes,

believing that greater power comes from killing and

consuming intelligent enemies. The Devourers favored

weapon is the trident, and his sahuagin worshipers are

intolerant of a nonsahuagin unlocking the power of

such a mighty weapon. A character who wields Corals

Bite might  nd herself under repeated attack by reli-

gious zealots who want not only to take the trident but

also to devour her in punishment for her audacity.

Corals Bite in Faern

A signature item of the aquatic elves who inhabit

Faernian seas is the trident of serenity (this item is

detailed in Races of Faern, page 172). This +1 trident also

has the ability to suppress rage- and fear-based effects

within 15 feet, including sahuagin blood frenzy.

To customize Corals Bite for an aquatic FORGOTTEN

REALMS campaign, you can replace its water breathing

legacy ability with a new ability called serenity that

reproduces the effect of the trident of serenity. Alter-

natively, slow the coral armor progression or give it

no special abilities relating to underwater breathing.

This version of the weapon is obviously best suited

to aquatic elves rather than air breathers.

Corals Bite could also be a weapon of the tritons

who  inhabit  the  hidden  city  at  the  bottom  of  the

Bay of Dancing Dolphins off the coast of Dambrath

(see the Shining South supplement, page 96). They

protect their city with illusion magic to keep it from

being found by surface dwellers, and their allies the

dolphins keep it safe from underwater attack. Should

the sahuagin of the bay mount a more organized

assault, a champion of the tritons might take up the

legacy weapon.

CRIMSON RUINATION

This broad-bladed greatsword bears a series of wicked

barbs along the lower third of its blade. The steel has

been infused with a substance that gives it a red-

dish tinge, except for three dwarven runes inlaid

in gold. Wrapped in red dragonhide, the grip ends

in a pommel crafted of a 3-inch-long dragon fang.

The guard is made of a bright red metal shaped

into the likeness of a pair of leathery wings.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 greatsword;

Cost 2,350 gp.

Omen: Regardless of the ambient temperature,

the blade is always warm to the touch, and

it  occasionally  seems  to  reect  the

image of a great conagration on

its surface, even when no re is

present.

HISTORY

Crimson Ruination was the sword of the

legendary  dragonslayer  Sir  Endrik  van

Ibnacht. Sir Endrik received the blade as

a gift from the dwarf thane Croi Machroi

in thanks for slaying the great red wyrm

Tarkalkatos.  According  to  legend,  the

dwarven smiths quenched the blade in the

great beasts blood and built the hilt from the

dragons bones and skin. Magic was laid into

the sword to protect the wielder from the ery

breath of dragons, and Sir Endrik would later

claim the only reason he lived to retire from

the occupation of dragon hunting was because

of the swords protection. (DC 15)

Sir  Endrik  van  Ibnacht  makes  his  rst

notable  appearance  during  the  so-called

Tarkalkatos Incident some four hundred years

ago (although a study of Ibnachtian folklore

reveals many tales of the legendary knight

for several years before that). An ancient red

dragon  calling  itself  Tarkalkatos  had  laid

claim to a vast mountain range as its person-

al territory. The dragons raids on shipments

of ore were threatening to choke off the sup-

ply to all the lands east of the mountains, and

several  adventuring  bands  had  already  met

gruesome  fates  when  they  attempted  to  slay

the beast. The dragon had even routed an entire

regiment of elite dwarf soldiers. The mines

owners were beginning to consider aban-

doning the lucrative eastern markets when

Sir Endrik rode into the mining town and

announced  his  intentions  to  slay  Tarkalkatos.  The

dwarves were clearly skeptical of the knights claim,

but agreed to allow him a fortnight before closing

down the caravan route. Thirteen days later, Sir En-

drik rode back out of the mountains, badly burned

and clinging to his saddle through sheer force of

will alone. Tarkalkatos was no more. After tend-

ing to the knights wounds, the grateful dwarves

forged Crimson Ruination as a gift for Sir Endrik

and constructed a monument at the spot where the

dragon fell. Years later, after his death, Sir Endrik

was returned to that monument and buried under

it. (DC 18; Heros Prayer)

Discovering Sir Endrik von Ibnachts

history  prior  to  the  Tarkalkatos

Incident  is  difcult,  requiring  a

great deal of wading through leg-

ends  and  folk  tales  that  ascribe  to

Sir Endrik not only martial prowess and pi-

ety, but also the ability to be in eight places

at once. Most of these stories are certainly

apocryphal,  while  others  are  possibly  the

true  exploits  of  other  knights,  which  have

been credited to Sir Endrik. A codex in the

Monastery of St. Cuthberts Hand, however,

contains enough veriable evidence that it is

almost certainly a true account of Sir Endrik.

This text tells of a fair-haired young man, newly

knighted with spurs yet untarnished, who came

to the monastery seeking a place to sleep and a

warm meal. He was almost turned away, because

the monks had been suffering from a strange sick-

ness that had claimed several lives, and the abbot

feared a plague had come upon them. The young

knight, who called himself Sir Endrik, told the

abbot that it was no plaguethe gods had giv-

en him a vision of the cause of the monasterys

woes. He asked to be shown to the river from

which the monks drew their water. After fol-

lowing the river back to its source, he revealed a

nest of young black dragons whose presence had

poisoned the river. Sir Endrik slew the beasts, and

the monks were troubled by sickness no more.

(DC 25; Purify the Draconic Taint)

Only one account of Sir Endriks early child-

hood survives, in a manuscript allegedly penned

by the knight himself in his twilight years. In this

text,  Sir  Endrik  reveals  that  he  was  born

the son of a peasant farmer and would have

been destined for a life of toil and hardship

like the rest of his family, if not been for an

event when he was seven years old. While gathering

rewood in the forest near his home, young Endrik

heard the sounds of a erce battle echoing from some-

where deeper in the woods. Curious, the boy followed

the sound until he found its sourcea knight, clad in

a gleaming coat of plates, was locked in mortal combat

with a great green dragon. Something sparked within

the young boy. He darted into the clearing, distracting

the dragon for a critical instant and giving the knight

an opening to drive his sword into the beasts throat.

The dragon fell dead. Impressed by the boys courage

and resolve, the knight offered to take the lad as his

squire, if Endriks father agreed. The farmer was only

too happy to see his son get a chance at a better life

and  readily  approved.  Sir  Endriks  chronicle  of  his

childhood is incomplete, ending with this story. (DC

31; Courage of the Child)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Crimson Ruination.

Heros Prayer: You must travel to the monument

that marks the site where Tarkalkatos was slain, as

well as the legendary Sir Endriks tomb. Once there,

you must spend 24 hours in prayer and meditation,

requesting Sir Endriks approval to wield his legend-

ary sword. Cost: 1,650 gp. Feat Granted: Least Legacy

(Crimson Ruination).

Purify the Draconic Taint: You are required to

uncover a source of corruption or blight caused by

the presence of an evil dragon and eliminate it. This

corruption might be physical, such as a green dragons

game and livestock predations threatening a nearby

village with starvation, or it might be subtler, such as

a red dragon using a dominated local barons inuence

for nefarious purposes. Cost: 13,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Lesser Legacy (Crimson Ruination).

Courage  of  the  Child:  Mirroring  Sir  Endriks

rst act of bravery in the face of a dragon, you must

confront an evil dragon while  bereft of any form of

magical  protection  or  augmentation.  Nonmagical

armor and weapons are allowed, but you must not be

under the effects of any benecial spells. You need not

vanquish the dragon or even engage it in battle, but

you do have to survive the encounter. Cost: 40,000 gp.

Feat Granted: Greater Legacy (Crimson Ruination).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Fighters and paladins, as well as rangers who special-

ize in killing dragons, are the most likely to find

Crimson Ruination useful. Martial clerics willing to

spend the feat to acquire prociency with the weapon

might also want to wield the greatsword.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

In a massive cave, high in a forbidding mountain

range, the heroes come across an unusual sightthe

corpse of an enormous red dragon, apparently slain

by the party of adventurers whose bodies also litter

the cave. Some of their numbers must have survived,

for the vast majority of the dragons hoard is gone.

In a smaller chamber attached to the main cavern,

apparently overlooked and forgotten by the looters,

is a smaller hoard, consisting of Crimson Ruination

and 3,000 silver pieces. Unfortunately, the owner of

this small hoarda very young red dragonis also

in this chamber. It isnt happy to see intruders.

Very Young Red Dragon: hp 95 (see page 75 of the

Monster Manual).

Dragons Grave

Main Chamber

The carcass of an adult red dragon dominates this

cavern, while the corpses of humanoid adventurers

also litter the scene. The stench is nauseating. Upon

 rst entering this chamber, each PC must make a DC

10 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.

Nursery

This small hollow is where both the very young dragon

and Crimson Ruination are located. The sword is buried

in a heap of coins and valuable objects that make up

the dragons hoard.

DESERT WIND

This slender and graceful scimitar is crafted of shin-

ing  steel,  lustrous  ivory,  and  polished

gold. Its hilt is set with brilliant blue

sapphires  and  fiery  red  rubies.  At

first glance, the weapon appears to

be nothing more than a showpiece, a

gaudy bit of belt-jewelry for a foppish

noble. Closer examination, however,

reveals the blades perfect balance and

keen edge, as well as a grip wrapped in

wireit will not slip in a hand slick with

sweat or blood.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 scimitar;

Cost 2,315 gp. On a successful attack, Desert

Wind  deals  1  point  of   re  damage  in

addition to normal damage.

Omen:  When  you  grasp  the  hilt

of this weapon, you feel a soft, warm

breeze, scented with the smells of date

palms and exotic spices, as though wafting from

a  desert  bazaar.  Only  you  feel  this  breeze,  which

might cause an occasional ripple in your clothing or

through your hair. It has no other effect. The blade

grows very hot when wielded in battle, glowing red

or even white.

HISTORY

The general design of Desert Wind suggests that its

creator hailed from one of the great, semimythical

cities of the southern deserts. In these metropolises,

all citizens know powerful magic, and genies walk

the streets alongside mortals. The communities are

presided over by powerful caliphs and emirs, who

rule  with  iron  fists  hidden  within  silken  gloves

of courtly intrigue and duplicity. Desert Wind was

surely  designed  for  such  a  wealthy  noble,  for  no

mere soldier could afford the finery of a blade such

as this one. The fact that the scimitar is functional

and beautiful shows that its owner was a discerning

warrior, not one who carried a sword only for show.

The dual themes of fire and air, reflected in the

jeweled inlays and the gold embossing on the

blade, hint at a possible supernatural origin

for the sword, perhaps tied to the stories

of  the  genies  that  dwell  in  the  desert

cities. (DC 15)

Desert Wind was commissioned

wastes. Rashid built his empire not on such paltry,

mundane goods as gold and silver or exotic silks and

spices, but on rare and precious spell components

and magical artifacts from across the planes. Rashid

compensated extraplanar adventurers amply for the

retrieval of body parts from exotic outsiders, material

from distant planar locales, and other rare sundries

for which wizards were willing to pay a high price but

unwilling to risk their own necks. Given the nature of

his business, it is unsurprising that Rashid made sev-

eral powerful enemies who would have delighted in

the emirs death by slow torture. Naturally,

Rashid hired the  nest bodyguards that

money could buy and  lled his home

with enough magical wards and traps to

protect an entire lost city. On top of these

precautions, in case all his defenses failed

and his person was directly threatened,

Rashid  commissioned  the  forging  of

Desert Wind by an efreeti weapon smith

called Haqim. With steel mined from

the Elemental Plane of Earth and a

forge  ame born on the Elemental

Plane of Fire, Haqim created a mag-

ni cent scimitar, for which Rashid

paid handsomely. (DC 18; Rite of

the Flame)

Rashid  received  his  sword,

marveling  at  its  razor  sharp-

ness,  perfect  balance,  and  near

weightlessness, but still he feared

the  coming  of  his  enemies.  He

then took the scimitar to a djinni

of  his  acquaintance,  a  sorcerer

named Malaq, to whom Rashid

had sold many rare and valuable

artifacts. Rashid asked Malaq to lay

spells  of  protection  and  sureness

in battle into the blade. He asked

that the weapon defend him from

all assault, that it ward against the

presence of those from beyond this

world,  and  that  it  be  able  to  strike

down  his  enemies,  slicing  through

them as a bird cuts the air with its wings.

Malaq took the sword and examined it, and

though  he  saw  from  its  construction  that  it

was the work of the hated efreet, he agreed to the

emirs request. With a coin made

from a stone, a song stolen from

dirt, and a knife from under the

by the emir Rashid ben Daoud,

a wealthy and powerful mer-

chant  lord  of  the  southern

64

Made to defend its wielder from all enemies,

Desert Wind ended up bankrupting its original owner

hills, Malaq wove his most powerful spells into the

sword. The steel practically thrummed with power,

scarcely able to contain the sorceries placed upon it.

When at last the casting was done, Malaq swore that

he had never performed such mighty magic and that

Rashid was surely as safe as any man could be, with

his  protective  wards,  his  capable  bodyguards,  and

his sword crafted and ensorcelled by genies. Rashid

took the sword and felt the awesome power singing

within it. He paid generously for it. (DC 25; Rite

of the Clouds)

Though  Rashid  now  possessed  the  nest  sword

among  all  the  lords  of  the  desert,  this  fantastic

weapon was also his greatest folly. So much of his

fortune had Rashid spent upon Desert Wind that he

had no more money with which to pay his adven-

turers for their discoveries. With no remuneration

forthcoming,  Rashids  suppliers  turned  elsewhere

to sell their goods. With no rare and powerful spell

components to trade, Rashid had no money to pay

his guards and servants. They all left him. With no

servants to maintain them, Rashids magical wards

faltered and expired and his traps rusted and rotted,

becoming  useless.  Soon,  naught  stood  between

Rashid and his enemies.

With  nothing  to  hold  them  at  bay,  the  outsiders

from  whom  Rashid  had  proted  began  to  close  in

on him. Desert Wind, once meant to be Rashids last

line of defense, was now his only protection. Mighty

though the scimitar was, and skilled as Rashid was

with a blade, he could not stand alone against his

adversaries. He ran. The life of a pauper did not agree

with Rashid, however, and he found he was incapable

of earning coin to pay for his keep. At long last, he

was cornered by agents of the devil prince Glornoth

the Malecent and dragged shrieking into the Nine

Hells.  Popular  tales  recount  his  fateto  be  daily

torn apart by devils harvesting his esh, only to be

rejuvenated each morning to suffer the same fate

again. Of Desert Winds fate, no fable speaks. (DC 31;

Rite of the Pauper)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Desert Wind.

Rite of the Flame: Since Desert Wind was forged

in the res of the efreeti Haqims home plane, you

must thrust the blade into a source of blistering heat,

letting the metal grow white-hot before removing

it. You must then allow the blade to cool, putting

it back into the flame when the blade dims to its

normal color. This cycle must be repeated without

interruption for 24 hours. Blazes originating on the

Elemental Plane of Fire are sufcient for this task,

but on the Material Plane, only molten lava is hot

enough to serve. The scimitar isnt harmed by this

treatment. Cost: 2,000 gp. Feat Granted: Least Legacy

(Desert Wind).

Rite of the Clouds: You are required to climb

to the peak of a tall mountain (at least 7,000 feet)

with the sword. At the peak, you must light a great

fire and burn incense pleasing to the creatures of

the air. Cost: 12,700 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy

(Desert Wind).

Rite of the Pauper: You have to correct the mis-

takes Rashid ben Daoud made in the creation of the

sword. This requires you to set aside one-quarter of

all monies and valuables you collect for one month,

vowing never to spend that sum frivolously. You

must then travel to the beggars quarter of any large

city. Cost: 40,500 gp. Feat Granted: Greater Legacy

(Desert Wind).

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

After obtaining an ornate, obviously magical scimitar

(Desert Wind) at a bazaar, the PCs are approached by a

giant gure swathed in dark brown robes. The being

offers  to  buy  the  sword  for  25  percent  more  than

the characters paid. If they refuse, or try to haggle

the  price  higher,  the  creature  becomes  bellicose,

threatening them in colorful invective with a dozen

horrible, eternal tortures. Upon any hostile response,

the gure casts off his cloak, revealing himself as a

djinni. He then tries to take Desert Wind by force,

retreating only if reduced to fewer than one-quarter

of his total hit points.

DEVIOUS AND VICIOUS

Devious and Vicious are kukrisheavy, curved knives

with  the  sharp  edge  on  the  inside  of  the  curve.

Their  blades  are  made  from  steel

that has been polished to a reflec-

tive surface.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1

kukri; Cost 2,308 gp.

Omens: The blades of both kukris

are so reective that each can be

used as a small steel mirror (see page

127 of the Players Handbook). Devious

and Vicious never require sharpening,

regardless of use.

HISTORY

Devious and Vicious are two kukris that were

once wielded by a set of fraternal twinsone

male and one female. Belgrath and Corselan,

as the twins were respectively named, were the

children of a solider who died in battle before

they  were  born.  Their  mother  perished  during

childbirth. Orphaned at such a formative age, the

twins were steadfastly attached to each other and

no one else. Together, they actively invented

ways  to  discourage  adoptive  parents  from

separating  them,  mostly  by  getting  them-

selves into trouble. The two were eventually

hired by a wizard who put their mischievous

skills to use and armed them with the kukris.

(DC 15)

Both Items: As Belgrath and Corselan grew

into adolescence, they became successful cat

burglars, not only to feed themselves, but also

to provide for the malnourished children of the

orphanage to which they belonged. In doing

so, the twins eventually stumbled upon the

home of a wizard. They evaded his magical

wards easily and looted the places

valuables,  including  two  magical

blades. When the wizard showed up

at the orphanage, Belgrath and Corselan expected to

be on the receiving end of his arcane wrath, but the

old man adopted them instead. The wizard came to

care a great deal for Belgrath and Corselan, both as

his children and valued pawns in his stratagems. The

old mage quickly realized the twins had awakened

hidden abilities in the identical kukris, so he formally

entrusted the blades to the siblings.

Devious:  Devious  was  given  to  Corselan,  who

became a huckster of the highest order, especially

when  her  brother  needed  to  be  bailed  out  of

trouble. Despite the dangers they faced, the twins

enjoyed their missions. They made up the wiz-

ards trusted inner circle, and the trio became

an  inuential  force  in  the  land,  united  by

their  family  bond.  (DC  20;  Words  That

Dance Circles)

Vicious:  Vicious  was  given  to  Bel-

grath, who became a terrible force to

be reckoned with, especially when his

sister was in peril. Despite the dangers

they faced, the twins enjoyed their mis-

sions. They made up the wizards trusted

inner circle, and the trio became an in-

fluential force in the land, united by their

family  bond.  (DC  20;  Eyes  That  Draw

Blood)

DEVIOUS LEGACY RITUAL

One ritual is required to unlock all the abili-

ties of Devious.

Words  that  Dance  Circles:  You  must

successfully deceive three different targets by

using Bluff checks. Cost: 2,000 gp. Feat Granted:

Least Legacy (Devious).

Lurin has long moved between outlying taverns and

hamlets, entertaining as a minstrel and keeping her

distance from the larger cities and their laws. When

not amusing others, the bard scouts the roadways for

lone travelers and easy targetsLurin makes most

of her living as a highway bandit while disguised as

a man. Her favorite prey is a wealthy foreigner that

she meets passing through a village. After advising

such a person about the best shortcuts in the area,

Lurin  subdues  the  luckless  dupe  on  some  lonely

trail, stealing whatever she can carry. It was during

one such robbery that she came into possession of

Devious,  which  has  helped  propagate  many  more

Jagur is an outdoorsman who gave up the city

for the forest, and now he hunts criminals for

bounties. When his actual quarry escapes, Jagur

has no qualms about hunting down any humanoid

with  passing  resemblance  to  the  missing  law-

breaker, turning in that hapless person instead.

(Dead is Jagurs preferred part of wanted dead

or alive.) His favorite tactic is to lay traps in a

forest,  attack  a  fugitive  (or  unfortunate  look-

alike) from range, and run away when chased,

leading any pursuers into the traps. When the

snares are sprung, Jagur closes to  nishes the

target off with Vicious, an acquisition

DIVINE SPARK

Divine  Spark  is  a  silver  holy  symbol  sculpted  to

resemble a shining sun. Such an image is sometimes

used by clerics and paladins not associated with any

particular deity. The amulet is small enough to be

gripped in one hand.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Silver holy symbol of

resistance +1; Cost 1,550 gp; Weight 1 lb. If you have

the  ability  to  turn  undead,  all  language-speaking

creatures within 30 feet can understand you when

you speak, regardless of language. This does not give

you any ability to understand others languages.

Omen:  Divine  Spark  transforms  into  your

preferred holy symbol while you carry it.

Divine Spark was created when

a  great  swelling  evil  threat-

ened to overrun the world and

extinguish all human life. The

most powerful necromancers of

the known realms formed

an unholy pact, creat-

ing  armies  of  ghouls,

skeletons,  wights,  and

zombies  that  wiped  out

entire regions, adding the slain to

their numbers. Church leaders in

the land could not afford to let

bickering and religious differ-

ences come between them any

longer. One man united them

Carthid Ufander. Carthid did not

believe in any deity, for what god

would allow so many people to suf-

fer at the hands of rabid, amoral creatures that made

feasts out of human esh? Carthid did believe in some-

thing greater than himself, howeverthe resilience

of humanity. To him, nothing was more divine than

this one truth. (DC 15)

As countries fell to legions of the unliving, eeing

populations were pushed farther and farther inland,

away from the oceans that could carry them to safety.

They were being herded against the largest moun-

tain range of the region, over which they could not

climb fast enough to escape their pursuers. Carthid

knew this. He rode out to each pocket of humanity

and urged them to combine forces rather than face

extinctionthey could not refuse aid, and they were

too few in number to make a stand alone. Everyone

Carthid spoke to agreed. When the leaders nally met,

Divine Spark was able to decipher the language of each,

but only from the one who held the holy symbol to

listeners. As a result, those who did not share common

tongues could be heard only when one held Divine

Spark while the others listened, allowing each person

to speak in turn. (DC 20; Talking Stick)

In the span of one night, strategies were concoct-

ed, forming rst, second, and third lines of defense,

always keeping the mountains at the united armys

back. Carthid gathered all the holy persons around

him the next morning and meditated before battle.

When the undead arrived, Divine Spark became the

focal  point  for  every  consecrated  person  present,

allowing  them  to  channel  their  turning  abilities

through Carthid and raise his pow-

er by a degree based on all who

remained  in  their  circle.  They

were unstoppable together, cutting

a swath through the undead wher-

ever they moved. If one cleric

was  slain,  all  the  others

turning abilities were im-

mediately  refreshed.  No

death was in vain. It quickly

became  obvious  the  overcon-

dent necromancers had stretched

themselves too thin. That day,

the tide of battle shifted with-

out  any  divine  intervention.

The members of the human na-

tions survived by saving themselves.

Carthid  disappeared  into  obscurity

shortly  thereafter,  but  he  has  long

been remembered as the man who

single-handedly, though only briey,

united all religions. (DC 25; Belief in Kin)

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

Clerics and paladins are the only ones capable of

wielding Divine Spark. Other classes all lack the requi-

site turning abilities without multiclassing. Paladins

can gain access to the staffs least abilities, but they

are typically incapable of paying the personal costs

required for the more powerful abilities and rarely

complete the Belief in Kin ritual.

Divine Spark Wielder Requirements

Ability to cast 1st-level divine spells

Diplomacy 2 ranks

Any nonevil alignment

Ability to turn undead

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Divine

Spark.

Endure Evil (Su): At 5th level and higher, you enjoy

the constant effect of a protection from evil spell. Caster

level 5th.

Turning Grace (Su): Beginning at 7th level, you

turn undead as if you were one level higher in the

class that grants you the ability. You are treated as two

levels higher in that class starting at 12th level, three

levels higher beginning at 14th level, and four levels

higher at 16th level and above.

Fear No Evil (Sp): Starting at 10th level, once per

day on command, you can use magic circle against evil

as the spell. The area is always centered on you. Caster

level 5th.

Searing Light (Sp): At 13th level and higher, once

per day on command, you can use searing light as the

spell. The spell is maximized. Caster level 10th.

When Carthid succeeded, with the cooperation of

many other holy persons, in vanquishing the great-

est undead threat of his time, he was soul-weary and

wanted to rest. Much fanfare followed the victory

and praise for Carthid personally, but that was never

his reason for getting involved. He simply possessed

clarity of vision, letting him see the right course

of action at the right time. Divine Spark was heavy

in his hands now, embodying more power than he

ever  wanted  to  use  again.  Carthid  deliberately  hid

the potent item among the ruins of a city slated for

rebuilding. That was a millennium ago. Divine Spark

can be found by explorers delving into the remains

of that old metropolis, which still exists beneath a

modern one.

Four ankhegs inhabit the same area. Their tunnels

have opened the way to a tomb, and Divine Spark can

be found in one of the cofns.

Ankhegs (4): hp 28 each (see page 14 of the Monster

Manual).

Divine Spark in Eberron

The foul cult of the Blood of Vol has spread through-

out the continent of Khorvaire, with ties even to the

distant lands of Aerenal and Xendrik. The ancient

lich Vol and her followers see undeath as a path to

divinity, and through necromancy and even bloodline

manipulation, they pursue this twisted end.

Those who serve deities of light and life despise

the dark ambitions of the Blood of Vol, but the most

fanatical champions against undeath are the follow-

ers of the Silver Flame. This lawful good deity is a

disembodied force of purity associated with a once-

mortal paladin, dedicated to protecting humanity

from supernatural evil. Many paladins follow the

Silver Flame, and in the hands of such a champion,

Divine Spark becomes a resplendent tool against the

taint of Vol.

Since Divine Spark is not tied to a speci c gods

worship, a cleric or paladin of any deity could just

as easily use it. It might even be found in the hands

of a goblinoid cleric of Darguuns Kech Volaar tribe.

Kalashtar follow the Path of Light rather than wor-

shiping a deity, and they too might make use of Divine

Spark to strengthen their lands against darkness.

Divine Spark in Faern

Velsharoon is lord of the undead and necromancy.

A relatively new deity, he was once a renegade Red

Wizard who competed with the terrible lich Szass

Tam before  nding a method to achieve immortality.

His greatest enemy is Kelemvor, the deity of death

and the afterlife. Kelemvor despises Velsharoon for

his support of necromancy, which keeps the dead

from their deserved rest. His clerics are tireless in

their pursuit of undead and those who create them,

sometimes declaring crusades to this end.  Divine

Sparks ability to facilitate communication can only

aid such causes, in addition to its effectiveness against

the undead.

Kelemvors followers sometimes come into con ict

with clerics of Jergal, who occasionally seek church-

sanctioned undeath to continue the endless work of

archiving the rolls of the dead. To Kelemvor, every

form of undead is an abomination, even when it serves

his grim seneschal. The church of Jergal might try to

locate and hide Divine Spark to prevent interference

in their sacred tasks. Alternatively, the small cadre

known as Companions of the Pallid Mask might take

up the legacy item in their quest to combat undead

not authorized in the service of Jergal.

DURINDANA

Durindana  is  an  austere  longsword.  Those  familiar

with the arts of the forge might recognize the

craftsmanship  as  dwarven,  but  the  style

of  the  blade  is  distinctly  human.  A  faint

tracery of Celestial script runs the length

of the blade, naming the weapon Durindana

and proclaiming its role as the reliquary for

the ngerbones of Saint Ardtan.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  +1  longsword;

Cost 2,315 gp.

Omen: The script on Durindana is intelligi-

ble to anyone, even if you are illiterate. In

direct sunlight, the blade gleams with a

hard, sharp edge, as though it draws

the sunbeams to it.

HISTORY

Durindana  is  a  blade  sacred  to  the

faith of Pelor, forged by a dwarf weap-

onsmith eighty years ago to house the nger

bones of the legendary undead-hunter, Saint

Ardtan. Ardtan was slain defending a dwarf

stronghold  from  a  plague  of  vampires.  In

gratitude  for  his  sacrice,  the  dwarf  thane

presented  the  church  of  Pelor  with  this

sword to honor the hero. When Ardtan was

canonized several years later, the hilt of the

sword was hollowed out to serve as a reliquary

for the saints ngerbones. The church kept

Durindana in its securest vaults, allowing it to

be used only by the holiest persons and only

in times of dire need. Even though many of

its  wielders  have  died  in  battle,  Durindana

always nds its way back into the hands of

the church. (DC 15)

Saint  Ardtan  was  raised  as  a  ward  of  the

church  of  Pelor,  after  his  parents  died  in  a

plague while he was still an infant. From an

early age, Ardtan showed signs that Pelors fa-

vor was upon him. When he was eight years

old, Ardtan claimed that he could speak to the

ghost of a former archdeacon of the temple in

which he was then living. Ardtan was able to

help the archdeacon pass on a message to his

surviving family, resolving the ghosts ties to the

Material Plane and allowing him to as-

cend to his proper rest. When Ardtan

was ten, he snuck out of the temple to

track down a vampire menacing the city. He cornered

the monster. Then, by pinning it with his ery gaze,

Ardtan held the vampire rooted to the spot until the

sun rose and disintegrated it. Shortly thereafter, the

church rewarded young Ardtan, enlisting him

into the service of the orders oldest and most

experienced paladin, Tram de Carnag. (DC

18; First Station of Saint Ardtan)

During  his  years  with  Tram  de  Carnag,

Ardtan continued to demonstrate his piety and

devotion. He possessed an uncanny ability to seek

out  and  destroy  evil  undead,  while  at  the  same

time helping more benign undead go to their af-

terlives. In faraway scablands, the pair disrupted

a  necromantic  cult  of  Nerull  and  rescued

many unfortunates who had been kid-

napped and brainwashed by the sect.

Tram was slain during that battle. It

then fell to Ardtan to return the old

knights  body  to  Trams  homeland

for  proper  burial.  Ironically,  Trams

ghost lingered behind, his need to com-

plete Ardtans training being greater than his

desire to move on to his reward. According to

the lore of the church, Ardtan simply smiled

at the spirit, and Tram saw the glories of Pelor

reected in the boys face, instantly revealing

his task was long done. The old paladin let go of

the concern fettering him to the physical world

and rose to Pelors side. (DC 25; Second Station

of Saint Ardtan)

When he returned to his temple with Trams

body, Ardtan was hailed as a hero and a saint in

the making. The church immediately knighted

him.  After  receiving  his  spurs,  Ardtan  was

informed of a dwarf settlement in the northern

mountains that was suffering a plague of mys-

terious deaths. The clerics of Moradin believed

the killings were the work of a vampire and,

having heard the tales of the renowned Ardtan

of Pelor, requested the young paladins assistance.

Ardtan  waited  only  long  enough  to  attend

his  mentors  funeral  before  riding  north.  The

dwarves  greeted  him  with  a  heros  welcome,

sure he would deliver them from the evil plagu-

ing their hold. When he nally did locate the

source of the murders, Ardtan was taken by sur-

prise. It was not one vampire, but an entire pack

of  the  creatures  at  least  twenty  strong,

with several more vampire spawn at their

command. The battle was erce, but even

Ardtan could not stand against such numbers for long.

He fell, but at the instant of his death, a blinding ash

cealment for up to 15 rounds per day. These rounds

need not be used consecutively.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

While  scouting  the  ruins  of  an  ancient  dwarven

stronghold, the heroes discover a hidden chamber

behind  a  crumbling  wall.  Inside,  the  chamber  is

opulently  appointed  with  expensive  furniture  and

elegant tapestries. The owner of these decadent quarters

is a vampire named Sivart. He has been hiding in this

secret chamber for several months now, quietly feeding

on the populace of a nearby town.

Within a stout, iron-bound chest against the wall is

Durindana, laid to rest there decades ago when Sivart

found the sword in nearby caverns. Concerned that

touching it might cause him harm, Sivart dominated

a dark elf ranger into carrying the weapon back to his

lair and locking it in the chest.

Vampire Lair

than forged, including Lyons Dag-

ger and the Green Shield, but many

of these stories are without basis in

fact. Fairly good records support the

actual existence of a sword called Dymond-

heart,  however,  whose  blade  is  green  and

growing. Such a weapons wielder is heir to

the strength of growing things. (DC 15)

The storied blade Dymondheart was most re-

cently wielded by an elf hunter named Elowyn.

Reveling in its living nature, Elowyn used the

magic of the sword against the machinations

of a servitor of decay referred to as the Rotting

Man.  Even  without  extensive  knowledge  of

the longswords true capabilities, Elowyn was

able to call on a few powers to aid her when

she was nearly bested by a demon from the

Abyss. (DC 18; Puri  cation of the Tree)

Dymondheart was a gift given to Elowyn by

an elf lord known as the Nentyarch. That title

is assumed by the greatest living druid in the

great forests to the east, and many elf druids

have held it over the centuries. The currently

serving  Nentyarch  wielded  the  longsword

himself  when  he  was  younger,  having  se-

cured it from the tombs of a fallen city called

Dun-Tharos, once inhabited by those who traf-

 cked with demons. Only the vigilance of an

unbroken string of Nentyarchs has kept these

ruins quiescent under a living boundary of trees.

A journey down past the roots of the sentinel

trees into the tombs required vast daring, and the

Nent yarchs reward was greathe reclaimed

Dymondheart, a sword once wielded by those

of his order in the distant past. Reclaiming

the weapon was not easy. Guardians with fell

power beset the Nentyarch, and he barely es-

caped with his life. (DC 25; Rite of Passage)

78

Nearly a thousand years ago, the  rst of the Nent-

yarchs raised a living fortress of magical trees over the

evil ruins of Dun-Tharos. His aim was to keep the

secrets of that demon-worshiping city safely un-

der root and trunk. The blade Dymond heart grew

fully formed from the living wood of one of those

ancient trees, a gift from the green powers to the

 rst of the Nentyarchs, signifying their patronage

and power. The blade was handed down from Ne-

ntyarch to Nentyarch. Only the  rst Nentyarch,

however, understood all the weapons powers and

abilities.  Using  it,  he  was  able  to  seal  away  the

tombs  beneath  his  living  stronghold

for almost a thousand years. (DC 31;

Prayer of Ancient Lineage)

LEGACY RITUALS

Lesser Legacy (Dymondheart).

Prayer  of  Ancient  Lineage:  You  are

EXORDIUS

Exordius is a vicious longsword with a blade of dull,

pitted black metal and a hilt of magically hardened

obsidian, set with a large ruby in the pommel. Inscribed

into the blade are runes and sigils of evil power, though

these seem unusually faded and worn.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  +1  longsword;  Cost

2,315 gp.

Omen: When Exordius is wielded in battle, tendrils of

pure, white light stream from the blade and the jewel

in the pommel. Their radiance is surprisingly sooth-

ing  to  good-aligned  creatures.  These  tendrils  grow

larger and brighter as the swords powers increase.

HISTORY

The ancient lich-king Raumos

forged Exordius for his chief

lieutenant, the death knight

Darnag.  The  blade  was  a

weapon of soul-searing evil.

Darnag ultimately used the

sword to overthrow Raumos

and  set  up  his  own  king-

dom, tales of which are still

used  to  frighten  children

into good behavior. Darnag

himself disappeared a few

centuries after overthrow-

ing Raumos. He was never

seen again. (DC 15)

Darnag was actually van-

quished in battle by a young

human woman named Ey-

ria, a paladin of Pelor. Eyria

is  renowned  in  the  his-

tory of Pelors church for

her  piety  and  courage,

and though she was slain

in battle with the death

knight, even in her own

destruction  she  was  victori-

ous. Exordius stole her soul and

absorbed it, but the sword was unable to destroy her

wholesome essence. Eyrias faith infused the weapon.

Darnag was then burned to ash by the touch of his

own bladeEyrias purity destroyed him. (DC 18;

Sanctication of Darkness)

After Darnags destruction, he and his sword were

entombed in a grand mausoleum constructed by his

loyal servants, who were unaware of the presence of

Eyrias soul inside Exordius. For centuries, the paladins

spirit struggled against the evil inherent in the blade.

In the quiet darkness of the tomb, Eyrias spirit was

overwhelmed.  Unable  to  purge  the  unholy  magic

from Exordius, her soul fell dormant and passed into

a deep torpor. (DC 25; Alone in the Gloom)

Many centuries after Exordius was interred in Dar-

nags tomb, an adventurer named Aedwar (also known

as He of the Steely Heart) discovered the tomb and be-

gan exploring it. His excavations triggered the tombs

magical defenses, and Aedwar was cornered by over a

dozen guardian demons at the death knights sarcopha-

gus. With no other weapon at hand, He of the Steely

Heart snatched up Exordius and wielded the evil blade

against his endish attackers. The strength of Aed-

wars determination, along with the

destruction of so many demons,

caused Eyrias spirit to stir into

wakefulness once again. With

Aedwars  help,  the  paladin

was able to banish the evil of

Exordiuss sinister magic once

and for all. (DC 31; Banish

the Abyssal Brood)

LEGACY

RITUALS

Three rituals are required

to  unlock  all  the  abilities

of Exordius.

Sanctication of Dark-

ness:  You  must  perform  a

ritual of purication upon

an evil magic item (any item

that has a spell with the evil

descriptor  in  its  creation

prerequisites) worth at least

1,500  gp.  This  ceremony

involves bathing the item

in holy water and chanting

prayers to a good-aligned

deity for 10 minutes. The process

destroys the sanctied item. Cost:

Exordius stole the soul of a human paladin

but that soul might yet survive, trapped in the blade

3,000 gp. Feat Granted: Least Legacy (Exordius).

Alone  in  the  Gloom:  You  are  required  to  seal

yourself in complete and total darkness for 24 hours.

Usually, this ritual is performed deep underground.

The rite is ruined by even the tiniest bit of light shin-

ing through a chink in a window or under a door. Cost:

12,500 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy (Exordius).

Banish the Abyssal Brood: In a single encounter,

you alone must slay one or more evil outsiders with

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Most  wielders  of  Exordius  are  paladins  or  militant

clerics, but any good-aligned character who meets the

requirements and desires more divine power benets

from carrying the sword.

Exordius Wielder Requirements

Base attack bonus +3

Knowledge (religion) 2 ranks

Any good alignment

Ability to turn undead

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Exordius.

Souls  Guidance  (Su):  Even  though  the  soul

of  the  paladin  Eyria  is  not  fully  awakened,  her

subconscious can subtly guide your hand in battle.

Beginning at 5th level, once per day as a standard

action, you can grant yourself a +2 luck bonus on

attack and damage rolls for 3 minutes, but only while

wielding Exordius.

Will of Two (Su): When your psyche is assaulted,

Eyrias formidable willpower bolsters your determina-

tion and strength of mind. At 6th level, you gain a +2

sacred bonus on all Will saves.

Eyrias Piety (Su): Even as the sword draws upon

your spiritual energy, it magnies your ability to turn

undead.  Starting  at  10th  level,  you  turn  undead  as

though you were two levels higher in the class that

grants the ability.

Awakened Soul: When you attain 12th level, the

soul of the ancient paladin Eyria awakens fully, trans-

forming Exordius into an intelligent item. The blade

has an Intelligence score of 10, a Wisdom score of 18,

and a Charisma score of 18. It is lawful good. Exordius

can communicate audible speech, though it speaks

only Common, and it can communicate with you tele-

pathically. It perceives its surroundings within 120 feet

with darkvision, blindsense, and hearing. The sword

has Eyrias 10 ranks of Knowledge (religion). Exordiuss

Ego score is 13 + its enhancement bonus (a total of 16

at 12th level). If any greater abilities are awakened, the

Ego increases to 17 + enhancement bonus.

Inner Strength (Sp): At 13th level and higher,

once per day as a swift action, you can use cure seri-

ous wounds as the spell on yourself when holding,

wearing, or wielding Exordius. Caster level 10th.

Dismissal (Sp): Beginning at 14th level, once per

day when you issue the command word and gesture

with the item, you can force a creature to return to its

native plane, as the dismissal spell. The base save DC

is 16, or 14 + your Charisma modier, whichever is

higher. Add your character level to this number and

subtract the target creatures HD to determine the

nal save DC. Caster level 10th.

Souls Sacrice (Su): Though Eyrias soul was the

only one to survive being absorbed by the evil of Exor-

dius, she was certainly not the only spirit captured by

the blade. The essences of other unfortunate victims

reside within the ruby on the swords pommel, now

little more than nonsentient bits of spiritual energy.

These souls have no mind or will, except for an instinct

to escape the sword in any way they can.

Thus, at 16th level and higher, whenever you are

targeted by a death effect, one of the trapped souls

surges forward and takes the effect for you. The death

effect frees that soul to travel to its properly appointed

afterlife. Besides Eyria, twenty-ve souls are trapped

in Exordius. Once they have all been freed, the sword

loses this ability. The only way to recharge this abil-

ity is for you to willingly let your own soul enter the

weapon upon your death.

Mantle of Sacred Protection (Su): At 18th level, you

gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

While  exploring  the  crumbling  ruins  of  an  ancient

temple, the party comes to a large iron door inscribed

with many sigils of binding and warding. Behind this

door  is  the  crypt  of  Aedwar,  He  of  the  Steely  Heart,

which also holds Exordius. The bearded devil Charen-

thoth is also trapped within the mausoleum. The infernal

creature came to the Material Plane under the misguided

belief that Exordius was still a powerful tool of evil. Much

to his surprise, he detected the faint aura of good from

Eyrias soul. Disgusted that the weapon had been so pol-

luted with holiness, he prepared to leave the crypt.

While  he  was  distracted  by  the  sword,  however,

the clerics who built the cathedral were able to trap

Charenthoth in the tomb. If the PCs open the tombs

magically sealed door, the devil assumes the characters

are the insolent mortals who rst trapped him on this

plane and attacks. If reduced to less than one-quarter

his hit points, Charenthoth attempts to ee and return

to the Nine Hells.

of the Monster Manual).

Aedwars Tomb

Sarcophagi

These stone cofns are covered by heavy granite lids

carved with efgies of the priests buried within them.

Inside each cofn are a silver holy symbol (25 gp) and

a gold-and-crystal vial of holy water (50 gp).

Aedwars Sarcophagus

This cofn is larger and more impressive than the

others, set on a dais with two steps leading up to it.

The lid has been broken, and half of it lies smashed

on the oor nearby. Inside the cofn, resting on the

breast of the skeleton within, is Exordius. With the

exception of the sword, everything in this cofn has

rotted into uselessness.

Dark Reliquary

A niche in this wall can be located with a DC 20 Search

check. Inside this recess are various items the priests

of old considered too dangerous or blasphemous to be

allowed to remain in the wide world. Several molder-

ing copies of the holy canons of various evil faiths

rest within, as does an amulet of deaths calling. This

amulet is a perfect candidate for the Sanctication

of Darkness ritual (see above).

AMULET OF DEATHS CALLING

This amulet is made of pale alabaster, carved into the like-

ness of a small gong or bell with a skull motif sculpted on

the face. It is usually worn on a fine chain of steel that has

been blackened as though by a tremendous fire. Once per

FIENDKILLERS FLAIL

Fiendkillers  Flail  is  an  oversized  ail  with  a  spiked

head and chain forged from an amalgam of cold iron

and silver. The handle is made from the forearm bone

of a horned devil and wrapped in the cured skin of

a marilith.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Large +1 cold iron

ail;  Cost  4,330  gp;  Damage  2d6+1;  Weight  10  lb.

Fiendkillers Flail is a Large weapon. A Medium crea-

ture can wield the ail with two hands at a 2 penalty

on attack rolls. Small creatures cannot use the ail

without some special ability to wield Large weapons

(such as the Monkey Grip feat, page 29).

Omen: The weapon hisses

when demons or devils are

visible within 25 feet. Your

eyes  emit  a  white  glow

when the weapon hisses.

HISTORY

Xuetari  hated  his  entire

family.  In  fact,  he  didnt

like  anything  about  his

society and what it entailed.

The creatures of both his and the

adjoining plane were constantly em-

broiled in petty conicts or insidious

plans to overthrow each other, compet-

ing for a eeting status Xuetari considered

pointless. The pursuit for domination over

weaker creatures had grown tiresome. Xue-

tari wanted to end the ennui that permeated

his  world  and  the  other,  but  to  achieve  that

lofty goal hed have to destroy the existing infra-

structure. To return meaning to life in the Abyss and

Baator, Xuetari had to assassinate a few leaders. The pit

end crafted a tool for this purpose, the weapon that

came to be known as Fiendkillers Flail. (DC 15)

Xuetari knew that he would have to make two decisive

strikesone against the mariliths of the Abyss and the

other against the horned devils of his native Baator.

The commanders of each camp had grown complacent,

making it easy for him to dispatch both in turn, bap-

tizing Fiendkillers Flail. These murders sent ripples of

fear through the endish planes, which Xuetari used

to his advantage. A member of a prominent family of

pit ends, he convinced his father to oversee a meeting

between the nalfeshnees and ice devils. Xuetari made

the arrangements but called the ice devil leader to arrive

early. He then ambushed the end and left him gutted

for the nalfeshnee chief to nd. Xuetaris father arrived

shortly thereafter. Seeing one leader alive and the other

dead, he drew the obvious conclusion. Although the

nalfeshnee claimed innocence, not all were convinced.

(DC 20; Appearance of Guilt)

The  mariliths  and  horned  devils  believed  that

the nalfeshnees were responsible for killing their

own leaders as well. A combined force of mariliths

and horned devils set upon the nalfeshnee  chiefs

house  and  wiped  out  his  entire  bloodline.  This

still left the hardest part for Xuetari. With four major

leaders eliminated, a huge chasm of authority exist-

ed.  Many  desired  that  power,

but  so  long  as  the  balors  and

pit  ends  remained  in  com-

mand,  the  weaker  demons

awaited orders. Xuetari

told  his  father  that  he

had found reason to be-

lieve the nalfeshnee leader

had been framed, and took

him  to  a  remote  location

where  the  evidence  could

be found. At that meeting,

Fiendkillers  Flail  sudden-

ly  awakened  into  a  holy

weapon, not only causing Xuetari great pain, but also

quickly facilitating the slaughter of his father. Xuetari

blamed the balors, of course, causing a full-scale war to

erupt that promised to last centuries. A new order

was created. Xuetari, disgusted with the weapons

holiness, abandoned Fiendkillers Flail. He hid it

on the Material Planehis only mistake in an

otherwise perfectly executed plan. (DC 25; Walk-

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Fiend-

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

When Xuetari hid Fiendkillers Flail on the Material

Plane, he entombed the weapon in a cave he dug at

the top of a frozen mountain. Recently an ettin, deter-

mined to  nd solitude from the world, climbed that

same mountain. In doing so, the giant noticed an odd

collection of boulders blocking what appeared to be

a cave. The ettin not only found a new home but also

unearthed a weapon perfectly sized for himFiend-

killers Flail. The ettin has no idea of the weapons true

potential. By climbing up and down the mountain

on a regular basis, the giant has inadvertently made

the face much easier to scale. In addition to the  ail,

the two-headed creature has amassed a small trove,

including 800 gp, two tourmaline gems (80 gp each), a

breastplate, a masterwork bastard sword, a masterwork

short spear, and four vials of antitoxin.

Kardun and Mordek, Ettin: 65 hp (see page 106

of the Monster Manual). The ettins full melee attack

with the  ail is +13/+8 melee (2d6+7). It carries six

javelins. Thrown boulders use the same attack bonus

as javelins, have a range increment of 80 feet and deal

2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage.

Ettin Mountain Cave

Entrance

This is the original cave opening dug out by Xuetari.

The upper part of the slope is still quite steep (Climb

DC 20), but the ettins repeated travels have made the

lower slopes relatively easy to climb, with Climb DCs

shown on the map.

Boulders

These boulders originally blocked off the cave entrance

but now are piled in the entrance tunnel for the ettin

to use against attackers.

Lair

The ettin makes its lair here. A  lthy pile of rags, scraps,

and unidenti able offal forms its sleeping area.

Hidden Passageway

The ettin has  lled in this smaller tunnel with boul-

ders  to  discourage  thieves.  It  leads  to  a  small  cave

containing the ettins treasure.

Pool

This pool was formed from collected rainwater. The

ettin keeps its treasure under the water.

FLAMECASTERS BOLT

Flamecasters Bolt is a light crossbow that appears to

be a standard weapon in most respectssturdy, reli-

able, and well used. A screaming skull is mounted

on the front.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 light crossbow; Cost

2,335 gp.

Omen: The crossbow is always warm to the touch.

Whenever Flamecasters Bolt is brought near  re, the

 ames  move  aside,  effectively  making  the  weapon

immune to  re.

HISTORY

Duegal was a crossbowman by trade, one of many guards

who stood atop the battlements of his lords fortress,

Mandrake Keep. His job description was straightfor-

wardrepel invaders, topple their ladders, and dont

get killed in the process. Duegal wasnt a particularly

good shot with a crossbow, a fact he openly shared with

his mates. He made up for his lack of skill with humor,

friendship, and generosity at the tavern. None of those

qualities,  though,  helped  Duegal  stay  alive  when  an

army of goblins amassed outside the castle. The events

of that battle de ned Flamecasters Bolt. (DC 15)

The  attack  against  Mandrake  Keep  came  with

little warning, and the soldiers defending the citadel

lacked practice. Near as anybody could tell, the goblin

multitude was expanding its territory, starting with

Mandrake Keep. Duegal had never participated in a

large-scale battle. If he thought the castle was doomed

that day, the crossbowman didnt share his feelings.

Instead he called out to his companions, Ill wager

that even I cant miss now. When the battle did begin,

the goblin onslaught was overwhelming. Duegal didnt

stop for a second,  ring one blazing, oil-soaked bolt

after another. (DC 20; Suffer the Flames)

Duegal stood out that

day,  ring wildly into the

goblins as they swarmed

up  the  fortresss  walls.

When  night  came,  the

goblins could see perfect-

ly and had no intention of

slowing down. Bonfires

were lit so the crossbow-

men could see anything

moving below and take shots

when they did. But Duegal was

a madman. As companion after

companion  fell  to  enemy   re,

Duegal seemed to grow mad. He

moved out from behind the arrow slits and stood up

on the battlements, taunting the goblin archers be-

low to hit him. They kept missing, while he returned

 re with his crossbow, shooting blindly into the dark-

ness beyond the bon res light. Duegal was overcome

with grief and rage, but something about his suicidal

abandon inspired awe. He seemed invincible atop the

wall, drawing the goblin archers aim away from other

defenders, giving them a chance to rally and reload.

(DC 25; Captive Audience)

Bugbears arrived at dawn, bringing catapults. Duegal

laughed at the reinforcements, drunk on the feeling of

invulnerability that came from not caring if he lived or

died. The bugbears loaded their massive siege weapons

and  red burning pitch at the castle, and the  reballs

trans xed Duegal as they streaked across the morning

sky. Nobody knows why he didnt move. Perhaps he

truly believed nothing could kill him. When a  aming

missile struck Duegal directly, the brave crossbow-

man was blown back off the battlements and into the

courtyard below. The pitch exploded upon impact,

setting the courtyard ablaze. At that very moment,

reinforcements from the neighboring city of Murcale

arrived and drove the weakened goblins back. Had it

not been for the citadel guards, and Duegal in particu-

lar, Mandrake Keep would have been taken. When

Duegals body was recovered after the battle, people

were surprised to see that his crossbow, still clutched

in  his  hand,  was  completely  unscathed.  His  spirit,

however, lived on undefeated within the crossbow.

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Flame-

casters Bolt.

Marked Target (Su): At 5th level and higher, on

command, you can cock and  re the empty Flamecast-

ers Bolt to launch a harmless bolt of energy. With a

successful ranged touch attack, the bolt strikes a single

target up to 400 feet away, with no range increment

penalty. The struck target is outlined as if by a faerie

 re spell. Caster level 5th.

Shore Up Morale (Sp): Beginning at 5th level, once

per day on command, you can use bless as the spell.

Caster level 5th.

Fiery Vengeance (Sp): At 7th level and higher, once

per day on command, you can cause Flamecasters Bolt

to launch a  reball as the spell. Caster level 7th.

Shooting Wild (Su): At 10th level, the spirit within

Flamecasters Bolt lends you what little precision Duegal

enjoyed in life, granting you a +2 enhancement bonus

to your Dexterity. At 14th level this bonus rises to +4,

increasing to +6 at 17th level.

Heat Shield (Su): Starting at 11th level, you can

withstand temperatures up through severe heat (to

140 F) without having to make Fortitude saves. (See

page 303 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for details on

heat dangers.)

Soul Seared: When you reach 11th level, the unde-

feated spirit of Duegal transforms Flamecasters Bolt into

an intelligent item. The weapon can speak Common,

Goblin, and Orc, but it can also communicate with you

telepathically. It has darkvision and hearing out to 60

feet, along with an Intelligence score of 10, a Wisdom

score of 15, and a Charisma score of 15. Flamecasters Bolt

is chaotic good. The items Ego score is 9 + its effective

its enhancement bonus if any greater abilities have been

you lose, Flamecasters Bolt in uences you to travel abroad,

seeking out and eradicating evil creatures that rely on

overwhelming numbers to defeat their opponents.

Beyond Range (Su): At 18th level, you gain damage

reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons.

Fury Unleashed (Su): Once you attain 20th level,

Flamecasters Bolt gains the special purpose of defeating

creatures that rely on overwhelming numbers to swarm

their  enemies.  When  facing  opponents  outnumber-

ing you and your allies by at least 50 percent, you can

use the  ery vengeance ability once per round without

expending that abilitys normal daily use limit. Since

it is a dedicated power (see page 270 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide) under the control of Flamecasters Bolt,

this ability ceases to function once the numbers are

even or to your advantage again. You can attempt to

use fury unleashed when not outnumbered, but this

requires a successful Will saving throw to overcome

the weapons Ego (13 + enhancement bonus).

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

When Flamecasters Bolt was discovered uncharred on

Duegals incinerated body, a cleric was summoned to

dispose of the crossbow, for fear the weapon was spiritu-

ally tainted. The priest, more curious than close-minded,

summoned a  re elemental to gain further insight into

the  crossbow.  He  handed  the  crossbow  over  to  the

elemental for examination. The  ery creature imme-

diately felt a kinship with the weapon and refused to

give it back, disappearing with it when the summoning

spell expired. The  re warden can now be found in

a volcanic cavern, where temperatures range between

very hot (above 90F) and severe heat (above 110F).

always has Flamecasters Bolt with it).

FLAMECASTERS BOLT

IN FAERN

Kossuth, the Firelord, rules all aspects of ame and is

the patron of re elementals. His worshipers revere

re as a purifying force as well as the source of passion

and artistic invention. A greater plan seems to be at

work, howeverone the deitys followers themselves

might not know. Kossuths adherents are fascinated

by Flamecasters Bolt, with its ability to withstand ame

while dealing out ery punishment. In a FORGOTTEN

REALMS campaign, the fire warden might be a servant

to the Firelord, tasked with guarding the legacy weapon

until it is needed in the pursuit of Kossuths plans.

Instead of being guarded by a re elemental, Flame-

casters Bolt might be in the possession of a re genasi

adherent of Kossuth. An example of such a defender

is presented here.

FLAY

Flay is a long whip fashioned from the skin of a giant

constrictor snake.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 whip; Cost 2,301 gp.

Omen: The tail end of the whip restlessly writhes

across the ground as if alive. With Flay in your posses-

sion, you can taste food with your sense of smell.

HISTORY

Fulanor didnt adventure with compan-

ions.  This  wasnt  because  he

disliked companyhe loved

to  share  stories  of  risk  and

dangerbut  because  he

didnt want to share any loot.

The chance of not getting ex-

actly what he wanted was too great in

a group of people. As a result, Fulanor

was exceedingly self-suf cient. In fact, there

was little Fulanor couldnt do, from casting spells to

healing himself, from holding his own in a  ght to

sneaking past sentries. For the most part, he avoided

overextending himself in situations he couldnt eas-

ily escape. He was good at this too. Then he heard a

rumor about a giant snake known as Saelishus. The

snake  reputedly  guarded  untold  riches,  slithering

over piles of gold but unaware of what it guarded. An

adventurer needed only avoid Saelishus long enough

to scoop up a helmet full of coins and make out like a

bandit. Such wealth would guarantee a comfortable

life for years. It is from the hide of Saelishus that Flay

was eventually fashioned. (DC 15)

Only a handful of brave souls told the stories about

Saelishus,  bragging  about  their  exploits  and  freely

showing off their wealth. When yet another adven-

turer emerged with riches  tting the rumor, Fulanor

 nally gave in to his curiosity. The location was well

known: The snakes abode was an underground river

and the surrounding caverns. Fulanor ventured inside

and  found  spelunking  equipment  strewn  about.

Thats  when  Saelishus  introduced  herselfa  huge

constrictor  that  could  speak  the  Common  tongue.

Fulanor had not entered the lair hoping to avoid the

serpent, as so many others had done before. He was

prepared to face Saelishus and magically charmed her.

This  development  brought  some  familiar  faces  out

of  hidingthe  selfsame  braggarts  whom  Fulanor

had heard speaking of fooling the mighty serpent.

These adventurers now revealed themselves as pure-

blood yuan-ti. They were in cahoots with Saelishus,

luring the foolhardy to the snake and looting their

The skin of the monster Saelishus

was fashioned into the whip Flay

possessions  after  the   constrictor  made  the  kill.

Fulanor convinced his new friend that the yuan-ti

would serve better in her belly, so Saelishus began

to  ght the yuan-ti. Both sides took severe wounds,

allowing Fulanor to mop up handily. He left not only

with the promised treasure, but also with Saelishuss

skin. (DC 20; Snake Charmer)

LEGACY RITUAL

One ritual is required to unlock all the abilities of Flay.

Snake Charmer: You must convince one oppo-

nent out of a group to turn against its own and its

comrades interests. Cost: 4,300 gp. Feat Granted: Least

Legacy (Flay).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

some talents of persuasion and the Exotic Weapon

Pro ciency (whip) feat can readily use the weapon.

Flay Wielder Requirements

Flay immediately makes a grapple check as a free action

that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, using

your grapple modi er + 4. If the check is successful,

Flay establishes a hold and can make grapple checks

on its own each round (you can release the whip). On

each subsequent successful grapple check, Flay con-

stricts, dealing 1d3+5 points of damage. The grappled

opponent can escape using the normal grapple rules

(see page 155 of the Players Handbook).

Snake Sense (Su): Starting at 10th level, you gain

blindsense in a 20-foot radius. You are also granted a

+5 bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks, ignoring

the effects of poor lighting and surface conditions.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

A nest of pureblood yuan-ti once worshiped Saelishus,

quietly living among humans and feeding live offer-

ings to their precious beast. When the resourceful

bard  Fulanor  slew  the  snake  and  made  Flay  out  of

her skin, the yuan-ti pursued him for years, incensed

at  his  fashioning  their  favored  pet  into  a  common

weapon. When Fulanor  nally grew tired of  eeing,

 ghting,  or  outsmarting  the  yuan-ti,  he  attempted

to call a truce. The yuan-ti agreed, but they betrayed

him by later sending an assassin to kill the bard in

his sleep. The whip is now the possession of Krenas,

a pureblood yuan-ti snake trainer. Krenas treats the

magically animated weapon as if it were a living snake,

believing the spirit of Saelishus remains alive within

the whip.

Yuan-Ti Snake Farm

This map depicts a secret underground facility, built

beneath an ordinary-looking house, where the yuan-ti

Krenas breeds and trains dangerous snakes. Above-

ground, the yuan-ti pureblood assumes a human guise

and masquerades as an ordinary townsperson.

Mating Cages

Prospective breeding snakes are introduced in these

rather small cages to encourage mating and egg laying.

The cages are currently empty, since several clutches

of eggs were recently laid.

Incubator

Natural packed earth provides protection and warmth

for the snake eggs, which are nestled in bedding on

a raised shelf.

Ladder to House

This  ascends  to  a  trap  door  in  the  houses  cellar,

which  is  kept  barred  from  the  underside  while

Krenas is in his facility. When he is aboveground,

he piles trash on top of the trap door to hide it from

casual view.

Bedroom

Krenas sleeps here and keeps the whip Flay in a pet

cage, as though it were a living snake. He often hisses

and croons to it affectionately.

A small hole has been burrowed into the earthen

oor, underneath Krenass cot. This is an emergency

escape that he can use in Tiny viper form. The burrow

opens into a dirt alley beside the house and is con-

cealed by a patch of weeds.

Snake Cages

This small, enclosed room is kept warm and contains

a number of cages. Each holds a Medium viper or a

Medium constrictor.

Tactical Notes

Krenas prefers to fight using his scimitar, but he

might  draw  Flay  to  access  its  snake  sting  ability.

At  any  given  time,  there  is  a  50  percent  chance

the  snake  trainer  is  in  his  bedroom,  which  also

serves as general living quarters, usually holding

and caressing Flay as though it were a living snake.

The rest of the time is split equally between the

incubator chamber and the room filled with snake

cages, as Krenas goes about his regular feeding and

tending.

Unless the party uses teleportation or digs into this

area, the only entry is by way of the ladder. Breaking

through the trapdoor is extremely difficult to do

quietly, since it is barred from the underside. However,

Krenas is usually preoccupied, so he takes a 2 penalty

on Listen checks.

Round 1: If Krenas hears the party entering, he

activates  his  darkness  ability  around  himself,  trust-

ing to his Blind-Fight to give him an advantage. He

also moves to remove Flay from its cage if he is in his

living quarters. If he is in the room with snake cages,

he instead releases one of the snakes.

Round 2: If he is not engaged in melee and has Flay,

Krenas cracks the whip to launch three magic missiles.

He directs the bolts against an apparent spellcaster if

he can see one, or against an obvious martial charac-

ter if not. He then draws his short sword or releases

another snake as suits the situation. Otherwise, he

draws his scimitar and short sword. (Until he wields

two weapons, his AC is only 20.) Krenas is obsessed

with protecting Flay and tries to get to that area if he

is not holding the whip.

Round  3  and  Beyond:  If  Krenas  has  Flay,  he

continues to use its snake sting ability until all daily

uses are exhausted or doing so is no longer practical,

then moves into melee combat. He does not drop the

whip but will take a move action to carefully wrap it

about his waist before drawing a second weapon.

Krenas doesnt use his spell-like abilities (cause

fear, charm person) unless he is reasonably certain

that he faces opponents weak enough to be affected

by them.

If things get dicey, Krenas attempts to withdraw

from combat and escape to his bedroom (there to

transform into a Tiny viper and use the bolt-hole) or

the ladder.

FROSTBURNS

WRATH

Frostburns Wrath is a quarterstaff made

from petri ed darkwood. It is topped

by a gnarled head, inside of which a

blue sapphire has been fastened.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:

Master work/+1  quarterstaff;  Cost

2,640 gp.

Omen:  The  staff  is  cold  to  the

touch,  and  when  squeezed,  vapor

rises from its entire length as if it

were dry ice.

HISTORY

Sorelius loved to stray from home and

roam  across  the  snow-covered,  alpine

meadows  for  days.  She  carried  with

her the staff that came to be known as

Frostburns Wrath. The wild elf maiden

lived in an ancient city carved out of a

mountain peak. Her ancestors created the

beautiful aerie so Sorelius and her fellow

wild elves could live in self-sustaining isola-

tion. But seclusion was something Sorelius

no longer craved. She always described her

explorations as uneventful to any who asked,

but on one such venture, she discovered a

handsome  human  man  lost  in  the  track-

less mountains, freezing in the bitter cold.

Sorelius saved him from certain death. Her

people forbade interaction with humans for

any reason, but Sorelius and the human, who

was called Faedrion, continued meeting each

other in secret. (DC 15)

Sorelius  and  Faedrion  sustained  their  love

affair for years. She shared stories of her home,

but she refused to show him where to  nd the

mountain city, since he would be killed on sight

if he were to go there. During this time Sorelius

grew increasingly clever at avoiding suspicion

about her frequent outings and even managed to

evade the trackers her parents sometimes hired.

Faedrion, however, was not so subtle. Although

he never spoke of Sorelius to anybody, members

of his clan followed him to one of his arctic ren-

dezvous. When Sorelius returned home after the

meeting, a human ranger shadowed her through

the  secret  paths  and  caverns  that  led

to the valley and city of the wild elves.

(DC 20; Coveted Secrets)

Faedrions tribe was running low on

food, and their hunts were lean. When

the  thriving  wild  elven  city  was  dis-

covered, above a valley  lled with harts

and  hinds,  the  humans  immediately

assumed  their  game  had  been  hoard-

ed by the elves. A berserker force was

sent  to  attack  and  plunder  the  elven

city  in  retaliation.  Faedrion  tried  to

warn Sorelius, but others in his tribe

prevented  him  from  doing  so,  trap-

ping and binding him. The berserkers

successfully  infiltrated  the  valley  and

climbed  up  the  steps  leading  to  the

mountain city, and many elves were lost.

Sorelius, with her staff, joined a group

of  archers  who  flanked  the  barbarians

and ambushed them, exterminating them.

Nobody  blamed  Sorelius  for  leading  the

humans to the city. No proof existed to al-

low such a claim. She felt responsible for the

damage done and every life lost nevertheless,

and she silently blamed Faedrion for it all. (DC

25; Envy Most Foul)

The loss of so many innocent lives was the

worst tragedy to befall the wild elf community

in  centuries.  Sorelius  could  tell  the  berserkers

came  from  Faedrions  clan  by  examining  their

garb. Fury and the sting of treachery washed over

the wild elf sorceress as she flew down from the

mountain like a scorned force of nature. Sorelius

could guess where Faedrion lived, but the exact

location didnt matter. She razed every human

encampment in her path with the cold embrace

of Frostburns Wrath, raging on until she came

to the most prominent village in the human

lands. There, Sorelius unleashed a blizzard un-

like any seen in the harshest winters, freezing

flesh on bone until it crystallized and flaked

away in the wind. Finally satisfied with the

blood price she had exacted, Sorelius landed

on the ground to survey firsthand the dam-

age she had wrought. It was then she saw her

lovers corpse, still tied to a post, seemingly

by his own people. Innocent of duplicity and

betrayed himself, Faedrion had been slain

by  Soreliuss  own  hand.  The  elf  dropped

Frostburns  Wrath  where  she  stood,  and  she

was never heard from again. (DC 30;

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

When Sorelius disappeared, leaving Frostburns Wrath

in the middle of a crystallized village, the few surviv-

ing humans had already  ed. The bodies of the dead

were left to the scavengers of the land. Foremost

among these was a band of trolls, who were drawn

down from the mountains by the smell of freshly

thawed meat. The trolls picked through the settle-

ment for food and eventually discovered Frostburns

Wrath, causing them to viciously contend for the item

until only one remained. That one is named Wordug.

Despite his best efforts, Wordug was never able to

activate the magic within the staff. He now carries

the item as a pretty trophy, relying on tooth and claw

in battle.

Wordug, Troll: AC 19 (includes hide armor), hp 63

(see page 247 of the Monster Manual).

Possessions: Frostburns Wrath, hide armor.

FULL MOONS TRICK

This undersized short sword gleams with a bright, sil-

very sheen. The grip is wrapped in simple, unadorned

cowhide, and the guard is worked into the shape

of a pair of wolf heads.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Small +1 silvered

short sword; Cost 2,330 gp; Damage 1d4; Weight

1 lb. Since this sword is a Small weapon, crea-

tures of other sizes take a 2 penalty on attack

rolls with it.

Omen:  Etched  into  the  blade  is  a  stylized

moon disc, which magically alters to match the

actual phase of the moon. In addition,

although the blade is polished to a

mirror nish, with a simple act of

will you can cause it to cloud to a

dull, matte gray.

HISTORY

When folk think of lycanthropes, they vi-

sualize a giant, ravening beast or a shaggy,

strange-looking man with a single eyebrow

or hairy palms. They seldom expect such

a monster to be contained within the body

of a sly haling burglar, but the existence

of Full Moons Trick shows that werewolves

come in many guises. Originally carried by

the  famous  haling  Rosie  Applecask,  Full

Moons Trick was initially nothing more than

a  magic  blade  belonging  to  a  particularly

skilled thief. When Rosie had the misfor-

tune to contract lycanthropy on one of her

jobs,  her  strange  destiny  intertwined  with

the magic of her sword and the dark workings

of the curse she had fallen under. That inter-

mingling of magic somehow made this short

sword unique. (DC 15)

Originally, the name Full Moons Trick had

nothing at all to do with lycanthropyit arose

from Rosies penchant for performing her skull-

duggery on nights with a full moon, despite the

fact that the brighter light made her easier to

spot.  Such  additional  challenges  were  Rosies

way of thumbing her nose at

those who tried to catch her.

She even had the habit of leav-

ing high-quality fakes in the

place of objects she stole. In one instance, while she

was still new to the trade of burglary, she slipped into

a mansion under the noses of forty guards by the

light of the full moon, stole a priceless vase nearly

as tall as herself, and left a counterfeit of such qual-

ity that the theft went undetected for three weeks.

With daring raids such as these, Rosie quickly made

a name for herself in the local thieves guild. (DC

18; Sneak Thievery)

Rosies  star  was  rising  rapidly,  and  she

seemed destined for a job at the top whenever

the current guildmaster retired. (In fact, some

said the old man running the show should retire

early.) But her meteoric ascent faltered when she

tried  to  steal  the  renowned  Eye  of  Boccob  dia-

mond from a powerful wizard. Exactly how she

ended up in the wizards menagerie instead

of his treasure room is a mystery; per-

haps  the  plans  she  had  studied  were

outdated or sabotaged by a rival. Maybe

Rosie simply made a mistake. Whatever

the  cause,  instead  of  the  Eye  of  Boccob

resting on its plinth, she found a slavering

werewolf. Badly mauled, the haling burglar

managed to escape, keeping just ahead of the

wizards guards. Dodging from safe house

to safe house, she struggled to contain the

beast within her over the nights of the next

full moon. Despite her horror at the deeds she

sometimes committed while in the grip of the

curse, she nevertheless felt a certain purity of

purpose in the actions of the wolfsomething

that could benet her as a thief. (DC 25; Skin

of the Beast)

When the full moon had passed, Rosie went

to a local weaponsmith to have her sword alchemi-

cally silvered. She decided if she could not learn

to control her curse, she would commit suicide.

When the next full moon came around, Rosie

again resisted the change, keeping the picture of

that bright, silvery blade sharp in her mind. To

her amazement, the rage abated, and she managed

to retain her natural shape. After using Full Moons

Trick as the focus of her meditations and avoiding

the change for the entirety of the full moon, Rosie

knew that she had mastered the afiction. She had

a moon glyph inscribed on the blade by a sorcerer

in the employ of the thieves guild

and carried the sword with her

for many years. When she nally

passed  on  at  a  ripe  old  age,  she

entrusted Full Moons Trick to the local priests of the

moon goddess, with the request that they give it to

some unlucky lycanthrope who needed it. (DC 31;

Mastery of Form)

The name Full Moons Trick had nothing at all

to do with lycanthropyat rst

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Full Moons Trick.

Sneak Thievery: You have to emulate Rosie Apple-

cask by performing an act of uncommon larceny. To

do so, you must inltrate a site and steal an object

worth at least 4,300 gp. During the theft, you must

overcome  traps,  guards,  or  other  hazards  with  an

Encounter Level of 6 or higher. While avoiding detec-

tion is not necessary, you must evade capture and later

arrest. Cost: 4,300 gp (the value of the stolen item). Feat

Granted: Least Legacy (Full Moons Trick).

Skin of the Beast: In order to fight the influ-

ence of the beast within, you must first understand

dawn) roaming in the shape of an animal, whether

through a druids wild shape ability, a polymorph

spell or effect, lycanthropy, or some other means.

Cost: 12,700 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy (Full

Moons Trick).

Mastery  of  Form:  You  must  demonstrate  your

ability to remain in control of your own body by

successfully resisting two attempts to alter your shape

against your will. Examples of such alterations include

a baleful polymorph spell or an involuntary lycanthropic

change. Cost: 40,500 gp. Feat Granted: Greater Legacy

(Full Moons Trick).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Lycanthropes nd Full Moons Trick phenomenally

useful, but even bards, rogues, and rangers can gain

enough useful abilities to justify the personal costs

of wielding the legacy item.

Full Moons Trick Wielder Requirements

Base attack bonus +2

Hide 2 ranks

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Full Moons

Trick. Many of the abilities of this legacy item depend on

the state of the omen ability. When the blade is clouded,

certain abilities can be used and others cannot; when

unclouded, the same is true. See the Omen entry for

details on clouding or unclouding the blade.

Wolfsbane (Su): Starting at 5th level, whenever you

use Full Moons Trick to strike a creature that is not in

its natural form, that creature must make a DC 15 Will

save or return to its natural form. This ability works on

any creature not in its inherent shape, whether it is a

druid using wild shape, a lycanthrope in animal form,

or some other shapechanger disguised as another being.

The blade must be unclouded to use this ability.

Quiet As a Shadow (Su): At 7th level, you gain a

+5 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks as long

as the blade of Full Moons Trick is clouded. This bonus

improves to +10 at 18th level.

Form Mastery (Su): Beginning at 8th level, you gain

a +2 bonus on saving throws against transmutation

magic. If you are a lycanthrope, the blades image blazes

into your mind whenever you try to resist an involun-

tary change, granting you a +8 bonus on the related

Control Shape check. The blade must be unclouded

to use this ability.

Darkvision (Su): At 11th level, you gain darkvision

out to 60 feet. If you already possess darkvision, the

range of your vision extends another 30 feet.

destroyed. The envoys offer Full Moons Trick to the party

as a reward, implying that the sword might be useful

against  lycanthropes.  The  werewolves  are  actually  a

merchant and his wifehe was infected on a hunting

expedition and later passed the curse to her. Ideally,

the PCs subdue these ill-fated people and bring them

in to the temple for treatment and protection.

Werewolves  (2):  hp  20,  18  (see  page  175  of  the

Monster Manual).

City Streets

Three-Story House

The werewolves are in hybrid form when they launch

their assault from atop this house. They leap down to

attack, heedless of possible injury.

Silversmiths Shop

This building houses a silversmiths workshop. The

door is strong wood with a hardness of 5 and 20 hit

points (break DC 23). It is locked with an average

lock (Open Lock DC 25). If the PCs gain access to

the shop, they  nd silver candlesticks, canes, and

aspergillums, which can be used as improvised clubs

(4 on attack rolls, 1d6 bludgeoning damage). Three

alchemically silvered daggers and a silvered battleaxe

are also located here.

FULL MOONS TRICK

IN EBERRON

The EBERRON Campaign Setting has two player character

races  with  the  shapechanger  subtype:  changelings

and shifters. The legacy abilities of Full Moons Trick

are useful in different ways both against and in the

hands of such characters.

When wielded by a changeling, the short sword is an

excellent complement to her innate talents at disguise

and misdirection. Rogue is a changelings favored class,

and the ability to move invisibly and make devastating

sneak attacks makes this weapon extremely valuable

to such characters. But the blade cuts both ways. A

disguised changeling can be quickly unmasked by a

blow from Full Moons Trick, as well as being vulnerable

to its shifters bane legacy ability.

A shifter can also make great use of this weapons

abilities, especially feral fury. Ranger is a shifters favored

class, and the enhanced stealth abilities granted by

Full Moons Trick are as helpful to ranger characters as

they are to rogues. The silvery blade is as dangerous

against a shifter as it is to a true lycanthrope, and a

Pure Flame zealot who wields Full Moons Trick can be

a one-person crusade.

Between the Ribs (Su): Starting at 14th level, you

gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls when

you make a sneak attack using a matte-bladed Full

Moons Trick.

Shifters Bane (Su): Once you have attained 16th

level, when the blade is unclouded, Full Moons Trick is

more potent in your hands against any creature with

the shapechanger subtype. Against such creatures, the

swords effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than

normal, and it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.

Feral Fury (Sp): Though one of its primary pur-

poses is to control and contain the animal within, Full

Moons Trick can also unleash it. Beginning  at 17th

level, three times per day on command, you can use

rage (self only) as the spell. Caster level 15th.

Shadows and Moonlight (Sp): At 20th level and

higher, two times per day on command, you can use

greater invisibility as the spell. You can use the spell

only  on  yourself  and  only  while  the  blade  of  Full

Moons Trick is clouded. Caster level 15th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

While the PCs are visiting a large city, envoys belong-

ing to the temple of the moon goddess come to them

with a request. A pair of werewolves is ravaging the

citys poorer districts and must be cured, captured, or

GHOSTFOLLYS GLOVES

Ghostfollys Gloves are a pair of  ne gloves crafted from

studded leather. The garments are long, covering the

wearers entire forearm, and they were made from the

skin of a great hart.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Gloves of protection +1;

Cost 2,035 gp; Weight .

Omen: The gloves always stylishly match whatever

youre wearing, and they dont leave marks on any-

Ghostfollys Gloves were originally the valued possession

of a half-elf socialite named Elkarion Swift, who was

well known for wearing her studded leather gloves

to every social function she attended. Indeed, people

began to think that either she couldnt take them

off  or  her  hands  were  horribly  scarred.  Elkarion

light heartedly de ected these rumors, making any

inquiries about the gloves seem like invasions of her

privacy, which morti ed the questioner while amus-

ing witnesses of the exchange. (DC 15)

Elkarion took great pains to accessorize her ward-

robe with the bold leather gloves. In fact, she was so

successful that new fashions began to emulate her

style. Eventually, every wealthy woman was wearing

studded gloves with her  nest out ts. Nobody both-

ered to question the fashion after it became trendy.

Thus, Elkarion was able to successfully de ect atten-

tion away from the real purpose of

Ghostfollys Glovesto

aid  her  in

spying on the most in uential leaders of the coastal

borderlands. (DC 20; Test of Tenaciousness)

Elkarion was the agent of a resistance cell made

up of citizens from a nearby nation. Ever since the

coastal people had conquered Elkarions homeland

and  enslaved  her  fellow  citizens,  the  half-elf  had

used her exotic heritage and beauty to become the

primary source of information for the resistance.

During this time, Elkarion was invited to parties in

the homes of countless military decision-makers.

Inside these places, she gathered what intelligence

she could and conveyed the information back to her

own commander. The more Elkarion engaged in this

espionage, the more chances she took, eventually

awakening the innate abilities of Ghostfollys Gloves.

(DC 25; Unbarring the Barrier)

For a decade, the information Elkarion provided to

the underground resistance allowed them to ambush,

sabotage,  and  weaken  the  military  infrastructure

of  their  conquerors.  Elkarion  had  become  a  spy  of

the  highest  order,  but  not  without  relying  heavily

on  Ghostfollys  Gloves  to  advance  her  cause.  Unfor-

tunately,  the  rebellion  was  too  successful.  Word

spread  to  hostile  neighboring  kingdoms  that  the

coastal borderlands were feeble. The attack came by

sea. Elkarions people were used as the front line of

defense, while the aristocracy  ed like cowards. The

half-elf spy was devastated. Not only were the coastal

borderlands defeated, but her people were  slaughtered

defending them. Despite all she had done, Elkarion

blamed herself for the loss and took her own life. The

whereabouts of her gloves have long been a mystery.

(DC 30; Mind Against Mechanism)

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

A pale half-elf woman appears to the characters while

they walk through the city on a foggy night. Her long

hair blows in a nonexistent wind. She appears trans-

lucent and speaks in a distant, hollow voice. Thats

not how they should be used, she rasps. The phantom

then points to the second story of an adjacent house,

where an ominous gure moves around in the dark

near a windowa cat burglar. Anybody watching the

apparition sees her fade away, while those who were

not looking think she simply disappears. Inspection

shows evidence that the houses door has been forcibly

entered. If the town guards are alerted, the burglar

escapes across the rooftops.

Empty House Robbery

This map depicts the home of a wealthy merchanta

home  currently  being  ransacked  by  a  cat  burglar.

Nobody is home at the moment (the family is out for

the evening) but the cat burglar is picking and choos-

ing from the owners possessions at her leisure.

The stairs to the top floor squeak slightly when

stepped on, and Urdine can hear this with a DC 12

Listen check (this includes modiers for distance and

intervening doors).

Front Door

Urdine has jimmied the door open quietly, forgoing

subtlety for speed. She closed it behind her to make

her forced entry less obvious, but anyone who both-

ers to inspect the door can see the damage (no Spot

check required). It swings open without making

additional noise.

Study

Urdine has ried through the desk drawers in here,

and they are still open.

Guest Room

The  room  has  clearly  been  tossed,  with  drawers

opened and bedclothes spread about.

Back Door

This door has not been forced, but its latch is open to

allow a quick exit.

Master Bedroom

The bedclothes and drawers here have been ried.

Urdine is currently in a walk-in closet behind the

master bedroom, rooting about through the fur coats

and other expensive garments.

Bedrooms

Urdine hasnt checked out these rooms yet. Their

contents are undisturbed.

Tactical Notes

Urdine prefers to escape rather than  ght if confronted.

If the PCs decide to alert the town guard rather than

enter the house themselves, the cat burglar can hear the

approaching soldiers in plenty of time to exit through

an upper- oor window and dash across the rooftops.

Catching her at that point is dif cult unless one or

more PCs have already climbed to the roofs of adjacent

buildings in hopes of trapping her.

Even in that situation, Urdines superior ability to

feint in combat gives her an excellent chance of deny-

ing an opponent a Dexterity bonus to AC. This allows

her  to  make  a  sneak  attack  with  a  poisoned  dagger,

potentially paralyzing that opponent. If the paralysis

succeeds, Urdine can make a break for it, tumbling

past other pursuers as necessary.

Should the party attempt to enter the house clandes-

tinely to trap the burglar within, they can get through

the front door without making additional noise. How-

ever, Urdine is alert for the possibility of the family

returning and makes frequent Listen checks in addition

to potentially hearing the characters. If she hears them,

she attempts a rooftop escape as described above.

If she is cornered while ri ing through the top- oor

closet, Urdine can put up a good  ght. She has the

advantage of being in a narrow space, which prevents

her from being engaged by more than two opponents

(although they can  ank her). In this situation, she

uses the following tactics.

Round 1: If Urdine wins initiative against one or

both opponents, she uses Quick Draw to pull out a

poisoned dagger. She then throws it at a  at-footed

character. If both are  at-footed, she attacks the more

lightly armored foe. (She hopes both to score a hit

more easily and to use poison against a character who

is less able to resist it.) She then feints against the other

opponent (a move action) if  at-footed, opening up

that character to a sneak attack on the next round.

If Urdine loses initiative and survives the initial

attacks, she wastes no time in self-defense but instead

hurls herself out the window, using Tumble to move

safely past opponents and Jump to make a soft landing.

She quickly disappears into the alleyways, making

pursuit  dif cult  unless  other  party  members  have

been posted to watch for such an escape.

Round 2: If one or both opponents are hindered

or helpless because of her actions on round 1, Urdine

follows through by making a sneak attack against a

character paralyzed by poison or off balance due to

a successful feint. She then tumbles out the window

as above.

GUURGAL

A wickedly barbed spear, Guurgal has a long, sharp

head of cold iron and a rough haft of darkwood.

Orc runes are seared into the wood, as if they

were burned into it with a red-hot iron. Feathers,

bits of colored stone, and various other primitive

decorations  hang  on  short  leather  thongs  just

below the base of the spearhead.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics: +1  cold  iron

spear; Cost 4,304 gp. Thanks to the vicious barbs

running along the edges of Guurgals point, the

weapon deals an additional 1 point of damage

on a critical hit.

Omen: Whenever Guurgal pierces an inanimate

object,  that  object  bleeds  profusely  for  1d4

rounds. Living creatures are unaffected by this

oddity, but bleeding objects are omens of victory

in orc culture.

HISTORY

Guurgal  is  a  mighty  spear  that  appears  in  orc

legends  about  their  greatest  warlords  of  the

distant past, supposedly blessed (or, in some

stories, created) by Gruumsh himself. The spears

discovery by an orc warrior is seen as a sign that

a Great Horde will soon be amassed to strike at

the enemies of the orc tribes. The spear usually

reappears  every  two  hundred  to  four  hundred

years, and tradition attributes to it a variety of

powers. (DC 15)

Guurgals  rst known appearance is in the

story  of  Argad,  a  chieftain  of  the  Bleeding

Hands tribe. During a battle with a force of

elves, Argad witnessed an enormous orc war-

rior on the battle eld, wielding the spear with

animalistic fury. When the battle ended, Argad

found Guurgal standing upright, stuck fast in

the gut of one of the fallen elves. The weapon

called to the chieftain, and with a great feat of

strength, he tore the spear free and claimed

it as his own. Three years later, at the head of

a horde of ten thousand orcs, Argad laid waste

to many civilized nations. (DC 18; Rite of the

Bleeding Hands)

After  Argads  defeat,  Guurgal  disappeared

from orc ken for three centuries. A shaman

of  the  Tearing  Claw  tribe,  who  was  called

the Hooded One, then beheld the

spear in a dream sent by Gruumsh.

In the vision, Gruumsh put out the

shamans left eye with Guurgal. When

the Hooded One woke, his left eye was a blind,

dead-white orb, but the spear lay across his chest,

the tip still bloody. That same year, the Hooded

One marshaled  ve tribes under his banner and

cut a swath through the hobgoblin tribes of the

region. (DC 25; Shamans Sight)

The  most  recent  sighting  of  Guurgal  was

in the hands of High King Bruug, ruler of one

of the only known orc nations in history.

Bruug  found  the  spear  in  a  trolls  lair.

He carried it into battle against the

surrounding human and elven bar-

onies, out of which he carved the

nation of Orghar. The kingdom

persisted  through  three  genera-

tions of Bruugs descendants before

a  band  of  adventurers  murdered  the

last High King. Orghar crumbled under the in-

 ghting of its warlords and shamans, and Guurgal

was lost in the chaos of the kingdoms collapse.

It has not been seen since. (DC 31; Test of the

High King)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abili-

ties of Guurgal.

Rite of the Bleeding Hands: You must

plunge  Guurgal  into  the  body  of  an  enemy.

You then slash open your palms with a dagger,

dealing 1d4 points of damage with each cut, and

wrench Guurgal free of the body. The proper per-

formance of the ritual causes the spears barbs to

stick  rmly, and a DC 20 Strength check is re-

quired to free it. You can take 10 on this check but

not 20, and you are allowed only three attempts

before the ritual fails. Cost: 3,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Least Legacy (Guurgal).

Shamans Sight: You have to spend 24 hours

in veneration of Gruumshpraying, chanting,

and offering sacri ces. At the end of this ob-

servance, you must put out your left eye with

Guurgal.  Cost:  13,000  gp.  Feat  Granted:  Lesser

Legacy (Guurgal).

Test of the High King: You are required to

face and defeat Guurgals greatest wielder, High

King Bruug of Orghar. Bruug is long dead, of

course, so you must locate his shade and defeat it in

battle. His soul resides on the Infernal

Battle eld of Acheron (see page 163 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide), where he

leads a vast horde of  endish orcs in

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Barbarians, ghters, and rangers are the most likely to

benet from the abilities of Guurgal, though militant

clerics, especially of Gruumsh, can also make effective

wielders of the spear. Any character with orc blood

and designs on becoming a great chief of orcs would

also do well to seek out Guurgal.

Guurgal Wielder Requirements

Orc or half-orc

Base attack bonus +3

Intimidate 2 ranks

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Guurgal.

Show of Force (Sp): A cunning warlord knows

sometimes the best tactic is to trick your opponent

into thinking your force is greater than it really is.

Beginning at 5th level, once per day on command, you

can use mirror image as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Incite Horde (Su): At 7th level and higher, Guurgal

grants a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving

throws against fear to all orcs within 30 feet of you.

This feature, however, does not affect you.

Gather the Horde (Su): Each time Guurgal has

surfaced in the hands of an orc warlord, it has signaled

the coming of a Great Horde. Your ability to create

such a horde is greatly magnied. At 8th level, you

gain a +5 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks

made to inuence orcs.

Bloodlust (Su): Starting at 13th level, whenever

you deal an opponent damage with Guurgal, you gain

a  +1  morale  bonus  on  your  next  attack  against  the

same opponent. The next attack must occur within 1

round, or the bonus is lost. The bonus is cumulative,

so if your next attack hits, you gain a +2 morale bonus

on your following attack against that opponent, and

so on up to a maximum attack bonus of +5. As long

as you continue successfully damaging the same foe,

you gain this bonus, but if you miss or fail to damage

the opponent with an attack, the bonus is lost.

Battleeld  Fury  (Su):  At  14th  level  and  higher,

as long as you are leading at least three other orcs or

half-orcs on the eld of battle, you gain a +2 morale

bonus to Strength.

Rage of the Boar (Su): Beginning at 20th level,

once per day as a swift action, you can be lled with a

boundless fury that equals a mighty barbarians rage.

For 10 rounds, you gain a +6 bonus to Strength and

Constitution along with a +3 bonus on Will saves, but

you take a 2 penalty to AC.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

During the course of their travels, the heroes hear of

a band of orc robbers menacing a major caravan route.

By  following  the  trail  of  eyewitness  accounts  and

physical evidence, they nd their way to the brigands

camp, where they discover the leader of the banda

6th-level orc barbarian wielding Guurgal. Six 1st-level

Orc Brigand Camp

Bon  re

A large bonfire in the center of the camp lights a

60-foot radius, creating shadowy illumination for

another 60 feet beyond that. Characters thrown into

the bon re take 1d6 points of  re damage per round

(Re ex DC 15 for half) and run the risk of catching

on  re (see Catching on Fire, page 303 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Loot Piles

These jumbled stacks of trade goods represent the

fruits of the orcs raids over the last several months.

Most of it is too cumbersome to be easily transported,

but portable silks, spices, and other  ne luxury goods

can be claimed as spoils. This transportable loot is

worth 1,100 gp.

Slave Pen

The orcs captured a few people from the caravans

they raided, planning to sell the unfortunates into

slavery. Presently, this cage contains three human

men, a half-elf woman, and a hal ing woman. All

are severely malnourished and have varying degrees

of injurythey are incapable of defending them-

selves. The cage is made of stout wooden poles, each

having hardness 5, 20 hit points, and a break DC

of 23. A length of crude chain ties the door shut.

The chain has a hardness of 10, 5 hit points, and a

break DC of 26.

Brigand Tents

Each of these tents is made of sturdy canvas. They

offer  cover  and  concealment  to  characters  inside

them or hiding behind them. The tents have a hard-

ness of 2, and dealing 2 points of damage with a sharp

edge makes a slit big enough for a Medium creature

to enter.

HAMMER OF WITCHES

This bulky warhammer has a head embossed with

golden  emblems  of  the  sun  and  holy  symbols  of

Pelor, while the oaken haft is engraved with intricate

runes of warding against arcane magic. Divine power

seems to radiate from the weapon, which glows and

pulses  with  a  soft,  golden  light  when  wielded.  In

the presence of an active

arcane spell or a magic

item created through

arcane means, this

pulse steadies and

brightens  into  a

constant  glow  of

brilliant yellow.

Nonlegacy Game

Statistics:  +1  war-

hammer;  Cost  2,312

gp. The potent warding

sigils inscribed on the haft grant you a +1

bonus on all saves against arcane magic.

HISTORY

The  church  of  Pelor  harbors  its  share  of

zealots willing to distort the sun gods teach-

ings to further their own ends, much like any

other faith. One of the most notable rogue

groups worshiping Pelor is the Holy Circle of

the Light of Faith, more commonly known

as the Circle of the Light or simply the Light.

This  cult  recruits  exclusively  from  among

the  clergy  of  Pelor,  seeking  clerics  who

distrust or fear arcane magic and offering

questionable scriptural proof that wizards

and their ilk are blasphemers against Pelors

will. The Light remains a secretive group.

Pelors conventional church seeks to root out

and destroy the cult as heretics, but the Light

nevertheless remains undeterred in what it

sees as its sacred mission. (DC 15)

The Holy Circle of the Light of Faith was

the  brainchild  of  an  adventuring  cleric

named  Malleus.  During  his  long  career

with the Heroes of Lannan, Mal-

leus  came  to  the  conclusion  that

arcane magic was the source of all

harmful,  wicked  spells,  while  di-

vine magic was the font of all good and helpful spells.

With this revelation xed rmly in his heart, he mur-

dered his companion, the sorcerer Arthal, and left the

group, announcing he had been charged with a divine

mission to eliminate all heathen spellcasters. Reliable

reports tell of Malleus continuing to draw upon his

deitys divine power to cast spells and turn undead,

despite the fact that he seemed to have committed

several violations against the code of the church. (DC

18; Rite of the Zealot)

The  Lights  rst  conict  with  the  mainstream

church of Pelor came

less than a year after

Malleus  founded

the group. With

the aid of hired

mercenaries and

summoned crea-

tures  from  the

Outer  Planes,

the  Light  raided

a  temple  to  Boc-

cob. Once the high

priest of Pelors cathe-

dral  in  the  same  city  got  word  of  what  had

happened,  he  gathered  the  churchs  clerics,

paladins, and other faithful to crush the ren-

egades of the Circle of the Light. The battle

was  erce.  Though  the  mainstream  church

managed to rescue most of Boccobs faithful,

Malleus led several of his cultists in a daring

escape. The Light went underground after the

disastrous battle. Malleuss personal weapon,

the  so-called  Hammer  of  Witches,  became  a

symbol of the cult. Members of the Light had

the hammers likeness either engraved on the

reverse side of their holy symbols or tattooed

on an inconspicuous part of their bodies. (DC

25; Rite of Hidden Light)

Over the years, the Holy Circle of the Light

of Faith became more adept at hiding itself and

its actions. The church of Pelor still doesnt

know  exactly  how  many  arcane  spellcast-

ers the Light has put to the ame, but they

suspect the number is at least fty. The cults

secretive nature is further aided by the fact

that  it  has  several  sleeper  agents  within  the

hierarchy of the mainstream church

of  Pelor,  covertly  passing  word  to

active members of the Light. In this

manner,  the  Light  has  remained

secret and safe for twenty-ve years. The one excep-

tion was a brief power struggle ve years ago, when

Malleus died and left no clear successor. Ultimately,

the  near-mythical  Hammer  of  Witches  decided  the

All those of impure heart fear the

cleansing power of Hammer of Witches

outcome of the struggle. During a heated argument

between the Lights two most powerful members, the

warhammer appeared in midair, blazing with golden

radiance, and swung around to point directly at Chief

Inquisitor  Jastar.  The  chief  inquisitor  received  the

Hammer of Witches as his own personal weapon and

took control of the Light. Jastar disappeared recently,

taking the warhammer with him. (DC 31; Master

of the Light)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Hammer of Witches.

Rite  of  the  Zealot:  You  are  required  to  slay  an

arcane spellcaster with a caster level of at least 3rd.

The  spellcasters  exact  nature  is  up  to  you,  but  the

slaying  must  be  spontaneous  and  unplannedit

cannot be premeditated. This procedure is an act of

faith, however twisted and debased, not an exercise

in assassination. Afterward, you must spend a full 24

hours in praise and worship of Pelor. Cost: 3,500 gp.

Feat Granted: Least Legacy (Hammer of Witches).

Rite of Hidden Light: You must locate a cell of

the  Holy  Circle  of  the  Light  of  Faith  and  petition

the cult for membership. The Light requires various

tests of ability, works of faith, and acts of penance to

prove your loyalty. Cost: 11,500 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser

Legacy (Hammer of Witches).

Master of the Light: Only the leader of the Holy

Circle of the Light of Faith can call upon the great-

est abilities of Hammer of Witches. Thus, you have to

wrest control of the cult away from its current leader,

using whatever means you deem necessary. Once in

control of the Light, you must spend a full 24 hours

in meditation with Hammer of Witches. Cost: 39,000 gp.

Feat Granted: Greater Legacy (Hammer of Witches).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Clerics are the most likely to nd Hammer of Witches

useful,  although  paladins  who  can  nd  a  way  to

reconcile the legacy rituals with their code of con-

duct  might  also  nd  the  weapon  a  powerful  tool

against evil mages. Paladins can gain access to the

weapons legacy abilities up through 13th level, but

they are typically incapable of paying the personal

costs (specically, the spell slot loss) required for the

more powerful abilities and rarely complete the Rite

of Hidden Light ritual.

Hammer of Witches Wielder Requirements

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Hammer

of Witches.

Magefinder (Sp): Although Hammer of Witches

glows brightly in the presence of arcane magic, this

automatic detection lacks precision and discernment.

At 5th level and higher, at will on command, you can

use detect magic as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Spellbreaker (Su): Starting at 8th level, once per

day upon making a successful attack roll with Hammer

of Witches against an opponent or object, you can use

the targeted form of dispel magic on that foe or item.

Stakes

Each of the three witches is tied to a stake with a

knot that requires a DC 10 Use Rope check to undo. If

freed, the three women dash off in random directions,

trying to get away. If the  res are lit, the women begin

to suffocate due to smoke inhalation (see page 304 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide). They die of suffocation

before the  re grows large enough to burn them.

Caster level 10th. Beginning at 11th level, you can use

this feature two times per day.

Witchmantle (Su): At 13th level, you gain spell

resistance against arcane spells equal to 5 + your

character level.

Antimagic  Field  (Sp):  Beginning  at  16th  level,

once per day on command, you can use antimagic  eld

as the spell. Caster level 11th.

Countermagic (Su): At 18th level and higher, once

per day as an immediate action, you can attempt to

counterspell an arcane spell cast within your sight as

if using a greater dispel magic spell. You must be aware

of the spells caster, and you cannot use this ability if

 at-footed. Caster level 15th.

Greater  Spell  Immunity  (Sp):  Starting  at  20th

level, once per day on command, you can use greater

spell immunity as the spell. Caster level 20th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

While passing through a small villages town square, the

heroes come across a man dressed as a cleric of Pelor,

carrying a large warhammer and sermonizing about the

evils of witchcraft. Three women are tied to stakes in

the square, around which are piled stacks of kindling

and  rewood. An acolyte stands close by, holding a

torch at the ready. When the women see the party, they

beg for aid, loudly proclaiming their innocence. If the

PCs question the priest, they learn that his only charge

against the women is the practice of arcane magic.

Brother Turniks acolyte, a 1st-level commoner named

Buris (3 hp), has little stomach for this work. If the

PCs seem a more credible threat than Turnik, he drops

the torch and  ees.

INFILTRATOR

Inltrator is a sturdy chain shirt assembled from shiny

rings of mithral, constructed primarily for military use

but not without a discerning eye for craftsmanship.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 mithral shirt; Cost

2,100 gp.

Omen: When wearing Inltrator, you can focus your

vision, gaining the visual effects of a magnifying glass

or  a  spyglass  (see  pages  130  and  127  of  the  Players

Handbook, respectively).

HISTORY

The product of a misspent youth,

Dekarius Daystorm was a sneaky

adolescent scion of a wealthy

merchant family that made

its  fortune  building  siege

engines  for  its  nations

armies. Dekarius was de-

termined to learn all his

familys dark secrets, and

he had a knack for ser-

endipitously overhearing

whispered confidences.

According to his father, the

lad possessed too much talent for

this skill. Something about Dekari-

us caused people to open up around

him. The entire family came to fear

his insatiable curiosity and powers

of deductionextortion, indelity,

and even murder ran through their

history, all there for the idle young

man to discover. So, without telling

his son beforehand, Dekariuss father

enlisted him into the royal army, hop-

ing the military could make good use

of his incisive skills. Dekarius was

sent on his way with the shirt of mithral chain that

would later become Inltrator. (DC 15)

Dekarius  raged  and  fumed  at  the  underhanded

way his father had enrolled him into the army, but

the youth could do nothing about it. The paperwork

was signed. To spite his father, Dekarius excelled in

all tasks assigned him and quickly demonstrated a

natural  aptitude  for  gathering  information  about

any enemy. As a result, he was sent deep into hostile

territory, always returning with, at the very least, a

detailed report of armaments, deployments, and troop

numbers. Dekarius, however, was never satised with

such a supercial accounting. He often dressed as a

member of opposing forces and boldly moved among

their encampments, specifically noting officers,

assessing personalities, and paying close attention to

command styles. Dekarius even managed to overhear

specic strategies being discussed by senior com-

manders. All of these accomplishments made him

an invaluable resource to the royal army. (DC 20;

Behind the Lines)

Dekarius made a reputation for himself among his

superiors, who came to rely on the information he

provided. His spying was so dependable that battles

were often delayed until he returned

from a mission. Eventually, Dek-

arius was given the most covert

assignment he had ever taken.

He was to inltrate a retreat-

ing  enemy  army,  earn  the

trust  of  their  commanding

ofcers, and serve as their

scout. Only Dekarius and

his superiors were privy

to this plan. Dekarius

was allowed to provide

the enemy leaders some

useful  intelligence,  but

only to gain their trust. Sly

disinformation would follow.

The operation worked perfectly,

allowing Dekarius to send cru-

cial facts to his commanders on a

regular basis. During a stay in an en-

emy metropolis, however, Dekarius

was taken aback when he spotted his

father in the streets. Younger shad-

owed elder through the citys avenues

and byways. The older man went into

a military barracks, and Dekarius re-

alized he was supplying siege engines

to both sides in the war. (DC 25; Inside Track)

When Dekarius discovered his father was double-

dealing,  his  patriotism  wrestled  with  his  family

loyalty. The young soldier confronted his father, who

revealed he had been secretly traveling back and

forth across the war lines for years. The Daystorm

cartel even worked to maintain an articial balance

of power to keep its industry alive. Dekariuss father

made it clear the whole family would suffer if this

duplicitous trading were stopped. Such deals were

wholly responsible for the familys current wealth.

Dekarius weighed these words against everything

he knew about his kin and the corruption running

deep through their history. Money had brought them

only misery. As he told his father to ee and never show

himself in their homeland again, Dekarius could sense

the old mans bodyguards approaching from behind.

He turned to face the cutthroats, only to feel the chill

ache of steel driving into his back and out through

his chest. The Daystorm business was preserved. (DC

30; Between the Lines)

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 8)

Dekariuss father sold Inltrator after his sons death.

Being mithral, it fetched a good price from a merce-

nary elf named Tezarune, and the bladesinger quickly

realized more power existed in the chain shirt than

was rst apparent. Now Tezarune uses Inltrator to aid

his schemes. A selsh and greedy person, he likes to

shadow other explorers, allow those others to do the

dirty work (such as ghting), and then claim some

choice bits of treasure while invisible.

LORESTEALER

Lorestealer  is  an  excellently  balanced  throwing  axe

with a sturdy oaken handle and a curved blade on

which arcane and divine runes have been carved.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 throwing axe; Cost

2,308 gp. When wielding Lorestealer, you can attempt

Use Magic Device checks untrained.

Omen: Runes begin to cycle across the blade if magic

scrolls are within 10 feet.

HISTORY

Huraden  was  not  witty,  nor  insightful,  nor

sociable,  but  Huraden  was  fanatically  loyal

to his employer, the young

sorcerer  Seldinor.  For  a

seemingly quiet member of

the aristocracy, Seldinor

had  many  enemies.

Huraden  protected

her  with  life  and

limb, though he came

close to death on more

than  one  occasion.  If  a

wizard threatened his mistress

or made an attempt on her life,

Huraden took the brunt of what-

ever damage the spellcaster could

deal out, giving Seldinor a chance

to  nish  off  the  foe.  Seldinor

returned  Huradens  loyalty  in

full. She forged a weapon of great

power for himan axe known as

Lorestealer. (DC 15)

If an assassins bolt sped toward Seldinor, Huraden

threw himself in front of it. If Seldinor told him to

rough up a gang of rogues, Huraden fought them

all at once, not concerned that he might be outnum-

bered. Unfortunately, it became apparent to Seldinor

that  Huraden  was  not  equipped  for  the  magical

conicts she habitually sought out. Seldinors ambi-

tions  waited  for  nobody.  Because  Huraden  had  no

spellcasting skill, Seldinor constructed Lorestealer to

compensate for this shortcoming and to shore up her

own offensive power. With the throwing axe, Huraden

could use a scroll by cleaving its parchment, thereby

releasing the stored magic. (DC 20; Tough Love)

Seldinor  and  Huraden  began  as  spellcaster  and

bodyguard in the courts of civilized society, but their

professional relationship gradually grew into a private

one.  The  pair  became  insatiable  lovers  shortly  after

Huraden took a beating defeating an ogre intent on

trampling Seldinor into the ground. When Seldinor

gave Huraden Lorestealer, the warrior unlocked within

the weapon the potential to use scrolls of the highest

order, but he had no ability to do so wisely. Such an

occasion arose after the pair combated demons in an

underground temple. The battle was won, but Seldi-

nor succumbed to a bleeding wound. Devoted to his

mistress, Huraden had kept a wish scroll tucked away

for just this possibility. Rather than simply wishing

Seldinor back to life, however, Huraden was overcome

with sentiment at the sight of her ravaged form and

wished the two of them would always be

together.  When  their  lifeless  bodies

were later found together, Lorestealer was

already  missing.  (DC  25;  Run  Before

You Can Walk)

LEGACY RITUALS

Two rituals are required to unlock all the

abilities of Lorestealer.

Tough Love: You are required to throw

yourself into harms way for a family

member, friend, or loved one, taking

the damage intended for that indi-

vidual. Cost: 4,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Least Legacy (Lorestealer).

Run Before You Can

Walk:  You  must  delib-

erately  misread  a  magic

scroll and cause a mishap

(see  page  238  of  the  Dun-

geon  Masters  Guide).  You  cannot

normally cause a deliberate mishap, but you can do

so in the performance of this ritual. Once you have

caused the mishap, you must spend 8 hours in medi-

tation with Lorestealer. Cost: 12,500 gp (less the value

of the scrolls used to cause a mishap). Feat Granted:

Lesser Legacy (Lorestealer).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

The wielders of Lorestealer are almost exclusively barbar-

ians, ghters, or rogues. Spellcasting character classes

have no need of its legacy abilities.

Lorestealer Wielder Requirements

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

After Huraden and Seldinor thwarted demons attempt-

ing to create a foothold on the Material Plane, the pair

perished due to Huradens foolish wish. One demon

survived their attack, howevera tougher-than-normal

babau named Utzari. Although alive, the demon was

stranded on the Material Plane. Having witnessed the

awesome spellcasting power of Lorestealer rst hand,

Utzari grabbed the weapon and ed with it, hoping to

open a way back to the Abyss. Even after much experi-

mentation, the babau could not activate the axe, failing

to realize Lorestealer would work only for a wielder who

possessed no spellcasting abilities. Utzari still carries

the throwing axe, convinced that it might one day

be useful. In the meantime, the babau has disguised

himself as a human and steals from powerful spell-

casters and adventurers in the hopes of nding a way

home. The PCs are perfect targets for the prowling

and  desperate  demon,  which  craftily  waits  for  the

right opportunity to strikesuch as when one of the

characters wanders away from the group.

Utzari uses Lorestealer in melee (he wont throw it).

MAU-JEHE

Mau-Jehe is a short sword of extraordinary quality,

resembling a punching dagger in its design. The

blade  has  a  rusty  color,  but  it  otherwise  appears

newly forged.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 short sword; Cost

2,310  gp.  Once  per  day,  you  can  study  another

creature within 30 feet, forcing that creature to

make a Will saving throw (DC 11 + your Wisdom

bonus).  If  the  save  fails,  you  can  determine

whether  the  target  creature  has  ranks  in  the

Hide or Move Silently skills.

Omen: When you swing Mau-Jehe in combat,

tendrils  of  ectoplasmic  energy  trail  behind

the blade.

HISTORY

Despite the appearance of this weap-

on,  Mau-Jehe  is  ancient.  Few  swords

have seen more wielders. Many stories

have surfaced about the origin of Mau-

Jehe, but the most common tale is that

it was forged by a thri-kreen and given

to the ruler of a now bygone sultanate.

Thri-kreen were less numerous in the

time of this realm, and they had been

conquered by the sultans armies. They

intended  the  sword  as  a  subtly  rude

gesturethe gift of a weapon is an ill

omen in thri-kreen society. The sultan,

oblivious  to  their  ways,  wore  the  sword

proudly and spoke of how he subjugated

the mantis folk with his willpower alone.

In his pompous overcondence, he parad-

ed through his kingdom almost unguarded,

only to be assassinated shortly thereafter by

a brash bandit. The murderer took Mau-Jehe

from the sultans corpse. (DC 15)

The man who killed the sultan was a robber-

knight named Abrax-atep, the commander of

a group of bandits made up of fallen aristocrats.

These brigands shared a fierce hatred of the

sultan, a man who had forcibly tak-

en their wealth to feed his insatiable

greed. After years of riding through

the desert together, the thieves, led

by  Stafaibn  Hashil,  rebelled  against  Abrax-atep

and murdered him. Stafaibn then fell wretchedly

ill and was put to death by his son Maibn Stafaibn

Hashil. When Huber, a talented rufan the bandits

had picked up along the way, challenged Maibn to

a duel and killed him, Mau-Jehe nally passed to a

soulknife.  Hubers  psychic  talents  awakened  the

synergistic abilities of Mau-Jehe, and he became ex-

ceedingly procient with the short sword. His talents

didnt save him from being ambushed and butchered

by the vengeful relatives of Maibn, though. After that,

the blade continued to pass from one bloodthirsty

cutthroat  to  another,  only  occasionally  falling

into the hands of a soulknife. (DC 20; Acciden-

tal Inheritance)

During all the times Mau-Jehe changed own-

ers, it successfully kept one secret: The weapon

harbors a secret affinity for virtuous warriors.

When the thri-kreen originally constructed the

weapon, they intended to assassinate the sultan,

reclaim Mau-Jehe, and declare righteous victory

over  their  oppressor.  In  circumstances

omitted  from  a  history  written  by  the

victors,  the  sultan  viciously  attacked

the thri-kreen without provocationthe

mantis folk were then known for being

both  autonomous  and  peaceful.  After

the sultan ordered his armies against the

thri-kreen, hoping to nd hidden wealth,

he came up empty handed. Countless thri-

kreen had been slaughtered for nothing.

Thri-kreen grew to hate the tyrannical

sultan and the injustice they faced. This

righteous anger was woven into Mau-Jehe.

(DC 25; Soulower)

abilities of Mau-Jehe.

Accidental Inheritance: You have to remove

Mau-Jehe from the corpse or crypt of its previ-

ous wielder. Cost: 2,200 gp. Feat Granted: Least

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Mau-Jehe.

Knife Made Mind (Su): Beginning at 5th level,

you  can  treat  Mau-Jehe  as  a  mind  blade  (see  the

sidebar). If you are a soulknife, the abilities of your

mind blade stack with those of Mau-Jehe (except for

enhancement bonuses), or you can use Mau-Jehe as a

separate mind blade. In this latter case, the abilities

of your mind blade and those of Mau-Jehe do not

stack, since each weapon remains distinct from the

other. When Mau-Jehe is used as a mind blade (or

in combination with your soulknife mind blade),

you  take  no  nonprociency  penalty  for  wielding

the sword.

Sneaky  Intentions  (Su):  At  5th  level,  you  gain

a +2 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently

checks.

Unspoken Contact (Sp): Beginning at 7th level, at

will on command, you can use mindlink as the psionic

power. Manifester level 2nd.

Mind Over Miles (Su): At 8th level, you gain

a  5-foot  enhancement  bonus  to  your  base  land

speed.

Stable  Focus  (Su):  At  9th  level,  you  can  choose

a psionic feat you already know that requires you to

maintain psionic focus to gain its benet. Mau-Jehe

allows you to be treated as if you constantly retain

psionic focus for the purposes of the selected feat.

Penetrating Proposal (Sp): Starting at 12th level,

at will on command, you can use suggestion as the

psionic power. Mau-Jehe provides an augmentation

to the powers save DC, which is 16, or 14 + your

Charisma modier, whichever is higher. Manifester

level 10th.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

You  can  use  feats  such  as  Combat  Expertise  and

Weapon Finesse in conjunction with the mind blade ver-

sion of Mau-Jehe just as if it were a normal short sword.

Feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon

Specialization, can also be used with the psychic version

of  Mau-Jehe,  so  long  as  those  feats  are  for  the  short

sword. Powers or spells that temporarily upgrade weap-

ons can be used on the Mau-Jehe mind blade.

MAU-JEHE AS A MIND BLADE

As a standard action, you can convert the physical Mau-

Jehe into a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy.

The psychic version of Mau-Jehe is identical in all ways

(except visually) to a short sword sized appropriately for

you. Even if you are not proficient with short swords, you

take no nonproficiency penalty for wielding Mau-Jehe in

mind blade form. With the mind blade Mau-Jehe, you gain

the usual benefits to your attack and damage rolls from a

high Strength bonus.

The mind-blade form of Mau-Jehe can be dismissed as

a free action. While dismissed, the blade simply ceases

to  exist  physically,  suspended  in  psychic  memory.  Ad-

ditionally, the moment you relinquish your grip on Mau-

Jehe, the sword dissipates into similar abeyance. You can

rematerialize the Mau-Jehe mind blade as a move action

or  reconstitute  the  sword  into  its  physical  shape  as  a

standard action.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

In  places  where  psionic  effects  do  not  normally

function (such as within a null psionics field), Mau-Jehe

is  automatically  reconstituted  as  a  physical  weapon.  If

you are killed while wielding Mau-Jehe as a mind blade,

the sword similarly reconstitutes as a physical weapon,

regardless of whether it is present as a mind blade or in

abeyance as a psychic memory.

For more information about the soulknife class and

the mind blade, see page 26 of the Expanded Psionics

Handbook.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

The  current  owner  of  Mau-Jehe  is  a  contract  killer

named Vauge, a notoriously dangerous and arrogant

soulknife. Vauge took the blade from a bandit warlord

she was hired to kill, admiring the weapons unusual

craftsmanship. She discovered the hidden legacy of the

weapon through additional research. Vauge currently

sells her services to anyone who pays her exorbitant

fees, and she is often employed to slay adventurers

who  know  too  much  about  secret  organizations.  A

villain who wishes to kill one of the PCs hires Vauge,

who then uses tactics to isolate that character for a

one-on-one ght.

Throw Mind Blade (Ex) Can throw mind blade (range

increment 30 ft.). Thrown mind blade dissipates.

Psychic Strike (Su) As a move action, can imbue mind

blade to deal +1d8 points of damage against the

next living, nonmindless target successfully hit with

an attack. A hit dissipates the energy. Creatures

immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities are

immune to this damage.

Shape Mind Blade (Su) As a full-round action, mind

blade can replicate a longsword or a bastard sword,

or it can be split into two short swords with no

enhancement bonus.

Alleyway Assassination

This map shows a sample situation in which Vauge

might ambush a player character. The PC has been

lured into a dead-end alley, and now the hired killer

closes in from the street, cutting off escape. Windows

on the upper oors of buildings line the alleyway but

arent easily accessible from the ground.

Fence

This barrier closes off the end of the alley. It is 15 feet

high and not easy to scale (Climb DC 15).

MERIKEL

This enormous, silvery greatsword was once the

weapon  of  a  solar  who  shared  the  weapons

name. The blade retains a commanding aura

of goodness and power, but small aspects

of the greatswords appearance can only be

described as disturbing. The guard is black-

ened as if by an intense re, and it is studded

with cruel barbs wholly out of place on such a

hallowed weapon. Celestial writing along the

blade seems innocuous enough, but anyone who

can read the language sees the words

become  foul  blasphemies  halfway

to the swords tip.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:

+1 greatsword; Cost 2,350 gp. Merikel

counts as a good-aligned weapon for

purposes of overcoming damage

reduction.

HISTORY

Merikel was one of the most

potent and favored solars in

the service of Heironeous. He

stood at the gods right hand,

carrying out the Invincibles

will and defending the faith-

ful against the depredations of

Hextor and other enemies of the

faith. His inuence was so great that

many of Heironeouss worshipers prayed

not directly to their deity, but to Merikel for his

intercession. Perhaps this worship led Merikel

to  grow  arrogant  and  prideful,  or  perhaps

Hextor or some other foe manipulated him,

but Merikel claimed godhood for himself and

challenged Heironeous for the right to be the

deity of valor. Heironeous defeated the solar

and, with great sadness, cast him down into

the Nine Hells. Merikels sword was separated

from him as he fell, however, and came to rest

on the Material Plane. (DC 15)

When Merikels greatswordbearing the

fallen angels name written in Celestial upon

its bladefell to the Material Plane, it was still

pure and holy, as betted the weapon of an an-

gel. A paladin named Hinsa discovered it and

carried the blade for several years, van-

quishing many foes with it. Over time,

however, Hinsa noticed a darkness rot-

ting the core of goodness within Merikel.

Powers once benign and helpful became dark, unholy

magic, searing the soul and crushing hope. Hinsa did

everything in his ability to restore Merikels pu-

rity, but he was unable to do so. With a heavy

heart, he cast the blade into the deepest part of

the ocean, praying Heironeous would guide a

worthier hand to it. (DC 18; Pious Redemp-

tion or Down the Dark Path)

Despite being separated from Merikel by the

planar boundaries, the greatsword was still tied in-

timately to the spirit of its fallen owner. As Merikel

brooded in the Hells, slowly becoming

more twisted and devilish, the blade

mirrored  his  descent  into  evil.  The

tainted sword brooded at the bottom

of the sea, becoming a dark reection

of its former form. Aquatic elves even-

tually  found  Merikel,  brought  the

sword to the surface, and sold it

to  a  weaponsmith  in  a  coast-

al  market.  There,  Garnaj,  a

blackguard dedicated to Hex-

tor, stole the unholy blade. In

Garnajs hands, the last sparks

of goodness in Merikel were all

but  extinguished.  They  might

have  been  lost  altogether  had

Garnaj not been slain by Hinsas

grandson Dremmik, a noble knight.

Dremmik reclaimed his grandfathers

sword  and,  guided  by  Heironeouss  wis-

dom, embarked upon a quest to redeem Merikel.

Dremmiks pursuit of Merikels deliverance

was cut short when Merikel himself, now a

powerful lord in the Nine Hells, attacked the

young paladin in a bid to reclaim the weapon

that had once been his. Fallen solar and knight

met in a clash of epic proportions, laying waste

to vast areas of countryside. Though the battle

was long and erce, in the end Merikel slew

Dremmik. The purity of the paladins sacrice,

however, purged enough of the evil from the

sword  that  Merikel  was  unable  to  carry  the

weapon  away.  Revolted,  the  fallen  angel  left

Merikel with Dremmiks body and returned to

the Nine Hells. The nal fate of Merikel remains

unknown,  for  when  Dremmiks  body

was discovered, the sword was not with

him.  (DC  31;  Final  Purication  or

Final Damnation)

Merikel was once the

renowned weapon of a solar

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Merikel. The greatsword is a dual legacy weapon

(see  page  208),  existing  in  a  state  of  ux  between

good and evil. Thus, each ritual has two aspects. You

must decide which of these to develop whenever you

perform a legacy ritual. Your choice cannot be changed

retroactively,  but  you  can  choose  a  different  aspect

when undertaking a new ritual.

Pious  Redemption  or  Down  the  Dark  Path:

Pious  Redemption  requires  you  to  perform  an  act

of redemption, such as atoning for a personal sin or

convincing a thief to leave behind her life of crime

and put her talents to good use. To enact Down the

Dark Path, you must perform a wicked act, such as

deliberately breaking a promise made in good faith

or convincing a new cleric to abandon his holy tenets

and desert his faith. Cost: 4,500 gp. Feat Granted: Least

Legacy (Merikel).

Path  of  Hope  or  Path  of  Despair:  To  perform

Path of Hope, you must destroy an outsider servant of

Hextor or another evil deity opposed to Heironeous.

Path of Despair requires you to make contact with and

slay a good-aligned outsider who serves Heironeous.

You must face your chosen foe alone and use Merikel

as your only weapon. Cost: 12,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Lesser Legacy (Merikel).

Final  Purication  or  Final  Damnation:  Final

Purification requires you to travel to a church of

Heironeous and bathe the sword in holy water blessed

by the high priest there. To perform Final Damna-

tion, you must dip Merikel into the poisonous water

of the River Styx, whether by traveling to one of the

lower planes through which the Styx runs, nding a

wellspring on the Material Plane, or simply acquiring

a container of the water. Cost: 40,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Greater Legacy (Merikel).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Blackguards, clerics, and paladins are most likely to

use Merikel.

Merikel Wielder Requirements

Ability to cast 1st-level divine spells

Base attack bonus +3

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Merikel.

Dual Legacy Properties: At each level where two

abilities are listed on the table, you gain the ability asso-

ciated with the ritual path youre following but not the

other ability. The rst ability listed is associated with

the good path of rituals, while the second is associated

with the evil path. If you change paths midstream, all

abilities change to match your new outlook.

For example, if Amri performs the Pious Redemption

ritual to acquire Least Legacy (Merikel), Merikel acquires

the touch of grace and bless abilities over the next several

levels. If she subsequently performs Path of Despair to

acquire Lesser Legacy (Merikel), the least abilities are

replaced by touch of fury and bane, respectively, and any

lesser abilities come from the evil path.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 4)

While  camping  in  the  wilderness  one  night,  a  par-

ticularly religious party member receives a prophetic

dream, revealing an angel battling a man who resembles

depictions of Heironeous. Finally, the angel is felled and

thrown down into the Hells. A sword the fallen one car-

ries plummets separately, landing on the Material Plane.

The dreamer recognizes the site shown in the dream as

an old, ruined temple of Heironeous just a days ride to

the north. When the PCs go to investigate the temple,

a forbidding hound archon attempts to block the way.

The archon does not use lethal force unless attacked

with the same. If the PCs overcome it, or convince it

to let them proceed with a DC 25 Diplomacy or Bluff

check, they can enter the ruined church.

However, without the archons knowledge, a party of

gnolls found a hidden way into the cathedral. While

the archon guards the front doors, the gnolls come

and go freely through the rear. They have set  up  a

camp within the cathedral and must be dealt with

before anyone can claim Merikel.

MINDSPLINTER

Mindsplinter is a steel morningstar, the spiked head

of which is fashioned to resemble the face of demon

screaming upward.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 morningstar; Cost

2,308 gp. Mindsplinter grants you a +1 resistance bonus

on saves against sonic attacks.

Omen: When you wield the weapon in battle, it emits

a high-pitched sound that is inaudible to humanoids

but disturbing to animals that have acute hearing.

HISTORY

Melaki  was  born  to  troglodytes  that  had  high

expectations for each of their hatchlings. He and his

siblings would not grow up simply to defend their

peoplethey would become their tribes mightiest

members.  One  of  them  would  rise  to  be  chief.  To

prove their strength both to their parents and to the

tribe, Melaki, his brothers, and his sisters were sent

to the surface at the age of culling, with no means

of protection other than their claws and teeth. They

were not to return unless they did so with weapons

forged  of  steel,  taken  from  the  corpses  of  the  soft-

skins. When Melaki  nally returned, he did so with

Mind splinter. (DC 15)

On the surface, any playfulness that ex-

isted between Melaki and his siblings as

hatchlings was gone. They were now  erce

rivals out to pursue any opportunity for

tribal advancement. Melaki was no excep-

tion. He shadowed his eldest brother,

the strongest and  rst to hatch,

watching as he clawed his way

through a camp of sleeping hu-

mans.  After  half  of  them  were

dead, the remaining two roused

themselves  to   ght.  Still  unbal-

anced  and  surprised,  the  humans

perished quickly, but not before one

stabbed the attacking troglodyte with

a spear. At that instant, Melaki struck,

picking up one of the dropped weap-

ons and murdering his brother while

the elder was still catching his breath.

Melaki collected all the metal armor

and  weapons,  keeping  the  morning-

star he had picked up for himself. He

dragged everything home to a triumphant

welcome.  His  was  the  best  single-handed

gathering  of  steel  in  generations  of  troglo-

dytes. (DC 20; Nothing Personal)

Melaki had his pick of mates, so he chose the stron-

gest  and  most  attractive  female  among  his  people.

The tribe agreed. The two were suited to each other.

Melaki was being groomed by the priests of Laogzed

to become the next chieftain, but his rite of passage

required  yet  another  ritual.  Before  Melaki  could

ascend to the role of tribal leader, the existing chief-

tain, his father, had to  ee or be defeated in combat.

The young would-be chieftain did not intend to let

his father decide which course to take. He attacked.

Cruelly, Melaki played with his sire for the better part

of an hour,  nally allowing Mindsplinter to do what it

did best. (DC 25; Unseat the Highest)

Melaki felt his troglodytes had grown complacent

under ground,  so  he  frequently  pushed  them  into

combat even when resources were low. The acquisitions

of steel were great and casualties commensurately high,

but this problem of attrition was easily solved in Melakis

mindthe females would simply have to lay more eggs.

When food became scarce, the oldest priest suggested

that  it  might  be  wise  for  the  tribe  to  conserve  their

strength. Melaki crushed the clerics skull for offering

such unsolicited and craven council. The old troglodyte

had friends, though, and these young warriors immedi-

ately attacked Melaki.

All were slain.

Even united, the group was no match for Melaki and

Mindsplinter. Melaki then ordered the raids to stop so the

tribe could conserve their strength. The priest had died

for nothing. The remaining troglodytes were angry, but

they bided their time. One day, scouts returned from

a mission with news of a poorly defended adamantine

mine. Melaki led the raid. Always greedy for rare metals,

he charged headlong into the entranceway and quickly

found  himself  alone.  Before  he  realized  what  was

happening, his treacherous lieutenants pulled out the

rigged support beams and collapsed the cave on their

chieftain, burying him with his morningstar. (DC 30;

whichever is higher. Caster level 20th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 8)

A duergar named Xurg has made an abandoned mine

his home. In the process of retrotting the shafts and

chambers with the help of animated skeletons, Xurg

unearthed the remains of a troglodyte near the entrance.

Still clutched in the corpses bony hands was a magic

morningstar. The duergar cleric had heard underworld

tales of a troglodyte chieftain who wielded such a blud-

geon, and he therefore studied the morningstar further.

He subsequently awakened Mindsplinter and now carries

the morningstar as his personal weapon.

Xurg brooks no intrusion on his private abode, kill-

ing any and all who trespass. The troglodyte skeleton

always attends the duergar cleric. Six other skeletons

guard Xurgs altar, a xture he casts desecrate upon if

he gets a chance.

Dark Temple

Skeletons

The human warrior skeletons remain in these alcoves

until directed into combat by Xurg.

Troglodyte Skeleton

The animated remains of Melaki, this skeleton serves

Xurg as a personal bodyguard and never leaves the

clerics side.

Altar

Xurg spends most of his time in prayer and medi-

tation  here  while  Melakis  skeleton  watches  over

him.

Mindsplinter in Eberron

The troglodyte tribe that birthed Melaki, and that he

came to dominate, can still exist in the monstrous

nation of Droaam. This hag-ruled region has little

central authority beyond the required tribute, and

individual  warlords  are  the  de  facto  government

among its monstrous and primitive peoples. In such

an  environment,  Mindsplinter  might  be  the  glue

that  held  together  a  troglodyte  subnation  within

Droaam. Now that the morningstar has been lost,

the tyranny of Melaki has endedbut so has the

cohesion of the troglodytes, making them prey for

aggressive neighboring groups such as rogue harpy

 ights or the expanding empire of Tzaryan Rracs

ogres.  The  trogs  now  wish  to  reclaim  the  legacy

weapon, but its whereabouts are unknown; the col-

lapsed mine shaft was excavated and looted. Instead

of Xurg and his skeletal retinue, a new owner wields

Mindsplinter.

Another  possibility  is  that  Mindsplinters  legacy

of betrayal has brought it to the Mournland. Xurg

found the morningstar in an abandoned mine, but

instead of staying there, the duergar priest decided

to cast his lot with the Blood of Vol and the Order

of  the  Emerald  Claw.  He  established  a  hidden

temple  within  Karrnath  as  part  of  Vols  bargain

with  Kaius  I.  The  morningstar  went  into  battle

during the Last War, and when Cyre vanished on

the Day of Mourning, the legacy weapon did as well.

Now  various  scavenger  companies  are  searching

for Mindsplinter, chief among them Ikars Salvage.

Ikar the Black expects a generous reward from his

masters in the Emerald Claw should he recover the

storied morningstar.

Mindsplinter in Faern

Among the warring factions of Torils Underdark,

troglodytes often serve as mercenaries and shock

troops.  Though  they  are  useful  in  this  role,  no

one  likes  or  trusts  the  disgusting  reptilians.  The

feeling is mutualtroglodytes serve only as long

as they are well fed, and they might turn on their

employers  at  any  moment.  Within  this  setting,

Mindsplinter can be the focus of a struggle to prevent

the troglodytes from becoming a more organized

and powerful force.

Alternatively,  Xurg  might  be  a  renegade  rune-

scribe of Laduguer who left the halls of his native

Drik  Hargunen  to  establish  a  realm  more  to  his

taste.  (For  more  about  the  duergar  city  of  Drik

Hargunen, the Runescribed Halls, see Underdark,

page 143.) Having excavated Melakis resting place

and acquiring Mindsplinter, Xurg believes himself

able to work toward that goal. The runescribes of

the city are aware of the renegade and wish to put

an end to his plans, but their weak standing army

and reclusive ways make military action infeasible.

The city might hire adventurers to do the dirty work

of rooting out the threat.

NOTCHED SPEAR

This wickedly barbed longspear is carved out of a solid

piece of bone. Its decorated with coral, pearls, and

sapphires. Flowing Aquan script runs the length of

the spear, detailing its history and wielders stretching

back thousands of years.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 longspear; Cost

2,305 gp. When set against a charge, Notched Spear

deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on a successful

attack  against  a  charging  creature  (on  top  of  the

normal double damage).

Omen: While you grip Notched Spears haft, you can

always hear the sound of the ocean.

HISTORY

Five  centuries  ago,  the  ravages  of  a  tremendous,

endish shark destroyed the legendary city of Klor-

datha, a place where merfolk and tritons once dwelt

together. Sahuagin priestesses of Sekolah summoned

the  creature  from  the  black  depths  of  the  infernal

planes. At the citys last stand, its ruler and founder,

the triton hero Oceaneid, bore the Notched Spear into

battle against the great shark-end. The clash lasted for

three tides. In the end, the shark swallowed Oceaneid

whole even as the tritons spear pierced its gullet and

killed it. The monsters carcass, along with the body

of the king and his legendary weapon, was cast into

the deepest rift in the ocean, the bottom of which

not even the tritons have seen. (DC 25; Pierce the

Unholy Devourer)

The Notched Spear was rst forged for a great

triton prince of the Elemental Plane of Water

The Notched Spear was crafted

many  thousands  of  years

ago  for  one  of  the  great

triton  princes  of  the

Elemental  Plane  of

Water. Carved from

a  single  rib  of  an

enormous sea serpent,

the  spear  was  power-

fully ensorcelled against

the  tritons  traditional

enemiesthe sahua-

gin.  The  spear  was

lost sometime after

the  majority  of  tri-

tons migrated to the Material

Plane, and it is now mentioned

only in the legends and stories of that aquatic people.

(DC 15)

A year ago, seers in many coastal towns and port

cities began to experience a singular vision in their

dreamsa long, barbed spear carved out of bone,

resting  on  the  ocean  oor  amid  a  bed  of  waving

seaweed. A voice in their heads then spoke in Aquan,

saying,  The  worthy  shall  be  rewarded,  and  the

many-toothed  destroyed.  Those  who  recognized

the spear as the Notched Spear of triton legend said

the  vision  heralded  the  imminent  defeat  of  the

sahuagin and their evil allies below the waves. Most

uniquely, the word for worthy used by the divine

voice carries the connotation of a nontriton that has

proven itself to the triton community. Some sages

argue  that  the  one  destined  to  carry  the  Notched

Spear will be an air breather, a highly controversial

(and to some tritons, offensive) idea. (DC 18; Touch

of the Sea Gods)

The  Notched  Spear

was seized as a trophy

by a sahuagin warlord

during  one  of  the  rst

battles between the tri-

tons and sahuagin after

the tritons migration

to  the  Material  Plane.

Notched Spears loss was a

terrible blow to the tritons,

and many of their great he-

roes gave their lives in the

search for it. After the roll of

many years, a cunning rogue

named  Oceaneid  took  a  small

band of tritons and merfolk into

the  dark  grottoes  and  blasphe-

mous temples of the sea devils. At great cost to the

party, Oceaneid and the merfolk bard Iara escaped,

bearing with them the legendary Notched Spear. The

pair received many honors for their deed. Some years

later, they founded the rst communal settlement in-

habited by both their races. That town became the city

of Klordatha. (DC 31; Unity of the Waters)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Notched Spear.

Touch of the Sea Gods: Recovering the Notched

Spear from its resting place on the sea bottom is an

impressive feat, but you must also spend an entire day

meditating and praying in a temple dedicated to a god

of the sea. Cost: 4,000 gp. Feat Granted: Least Legacy

(Notched Spear).

Pierce  the  Unholy  Devourer:  Alone,  you  are

required to engage a endish dire shark in combat

PLANESHIFTERS KNIFE

Planeshifters Knife is a dagger with a spiral hilt

and a broad, serrated blade that tapers to a

sharp point.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  +1  dagger;

Cost 2,302 gp.

Omen: Whenever you set the dagger down,

it immediately rights itself to balance on the

tip of the blade, always at a 90-degree angle to

any surface it touches, regardless of gravity.

It begins spinning whenever an extraplanar

creature is within 5 feet.

HISTORY

A young wizard named Arochius Kade, who

consistently angered the Enclave of Mages,

created Planeshifters Knife. Aro-

chius was frequently absent

from  the  Enclaves  parlia-

ments and accused of being

reclusive. He resented the

Enclave of Mages, knowing

full well that they existed only

to  keep  track  of  and  control  powerful

spellcasters. The benets of membership,

however, were undeniableaccess to one

of the worlds largest thaumaturgic librar-

ies guarded by vigilant shadow mastiffs.

It was accountability that chafed Arochi-

us. The Enclave knew exactly what their

members  were  researching  and  guided

them accordingly. For the youthful mage

to break free of their inuence, he would

have to craft an object with potential sur-

passing his own power. (DC 15)

The Enclave of Mages controlled an in-

formation network that stretched across the

continents. They introduced themselves to

Arochius when his powers rst increased

beyond normal ken, having observed the

mage  through  scrying  devices.  An  offer

of membership was extended, but the re-

cruitment tactics more resembled those of a

press gang. The message was clearthe En-

clave did not tolerate independents. Arochius

wasnt able to resist the Enclave at the time,

but  their  library  eventually  revealed  knowl-

edge that might help him escape them. Once

Planeshifters Knife was complete,

he showed the dagger to the Enclave. The members

studied the weapon and agreed it was simply

a tool for detecting extraplanar creatures.

At the time, that was exactly right. (DC 20;

The First Ingredient)

Arochius told the Enclave his reluctance

to attend their gatherings was due to sus-

picion. He wanted to make sure that none

of the council members were extraplanar

creatures, in light of their extensive use of

shadow mastiffs as guardians. Planeshifters

Knife dispelled such concerns. Arochius was

lauded for his prudence. As he grew in pow-

er, Arochius unlocked the daggers hidden

potentialjust  as  he  had  planned.  Plane-

shifters Knife gave him the ability to move

from one plane of existence

to  another,  but  only  af-

ter plunging the dagger

into an extraplanar crea-

ture.  He  didnt  hesitate

to use the weapons abili-

ties.  Arochius  gathered  some

of the most valuable tomes from the En-

claves library, attacked one of the shadow

mastiffs, and ed to another reality. Un-

fortunately,  he  arrived  only  seconds

before an Enclave recovery team. Having

magically tagged each one of their books,

the  Enclave  had  no  difculty  tracking

Arochius and little trouble dispatching

the upstart where he stood. His dagger

has remained in storage ever since. (DC

25; Over the Threshold)

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Most wielders of Planeshifters Knife are clerics, sorcer-

ers, or wizards, though bards and druids might also

have an interest in extraplanar travel.

Planeshifters Knife Wielder Requirements

Ability to cast 2nd-level spells

Knowledge (the planes) 2 ranks

Speak Language (one of Abyssal, Aquan, Auran,

Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, or Terran)

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Plane-

shifters Knife.

Sense Alien (Su): At 5th level and higher, you can

detect any creature with the extraplanar subtype

within 60 feet at will, as if detecting an evil outsider

with detect evil. Caster level 5th.

Planesight (Sp): Starting at 6th level, five times

per day on command, you can use see invisibility as

the spell. The duration of each use is only 10 minutes.

Caster level 5th.

Reality Slice (Su): At 9th level and higher, once

per day on command, you can use Planeshifters Knife to

cut a window in the fabric of reality that opens into an

extradimensional space, as per the rope trick spell. Unlike

rope trick, no rope dangles from the slash, but the open-

ing is always visible to you. You can personally usher in

other creatures. The aperture can be in any orientation,

and those within the extradimensional space can do

anything normally allowed by rope trick that does not

require the associated rope. Caster level 10th.

Unseen Foe (Sp): Starting at 10th level, once per

day on command, you can become imperceptible

to extraplanar creatures for 50 minutes. This ability

functions like hide from undead, except that it affects

creatures  with  the  extraplanar  subtype  instead  of

undead. Caster level 5th.

Dancing (Su): Once you reach 12th level, Plane-

shifters  Knife  can  be  loosed  to  attack  on  its  own

two times per day. Treat this as if the weapon had

the dancing magic weapon ability (page 224 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Planar Cunning (Su): At 13th level and higher,

you are never considered at-footed against the attacks

of extraplanar creatures, so long as you hold Plane-

shifters Knife.

Induce Shift (Su): Beginning at 16th level, when-

ever you use Planeshifters Knife to hit an extraplanar

creature  (other  than  you),  you  can  instantaneously

move to another plane of your choice, as per the plane

shift spell. Caster level 13th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

Hidden beneath the ruins of an old temple is a library

untouched for almost a centurythe same library

Arochius  Kade  once  burgled.  If  a  means  can  be

found to open the passageway that leads below, the

PCs can discover a wealth of knowledge, along with

Planeshifters Knife, in a secluded chamber. Opening

the tunnel, however, awakens a shadow mastiff from a

magically induced stasis. Should the Enclave of Mages

return to nd their cache of scrolls plundered, they

seek out the parties responsible.

Manual).

Sanctuary of the Sun

This temple is an open structure with a hemispherical

roof supported on square brackets. The grounds of the

ancient temple are overgrown with trees and brush,

casting deep shadows over the building.

A sun pattern is worked in stone on the uppermost

 oor. This is actually the opening device for a hidden

stairway. Someone wishing to enter must stand on the

pattern while it is entirely covered by sunlight. The

overgrowth surrounding this temple prevents this, but

the same effect can be achieved with a daylight spell.

When the stairs are activated, they drop away into

a recess that leads down into the library. The stairs

withdraw again after 10 minutes unless a pattern in

the bottom step is pressed, resetting them for another

10 minutes.

Library

This chamber is airtight and has preserved its con-

tents  perfectly.  Shelves  line  the  walls,  all  covered

with valuable tomes and scrolls. One of the codices

has been hollowed out to serve as a secret container

for Planeshifters Knife. Although the weapon is cun-

ningly hidden, the books shape is slightly deformed

by this operation and can be noticed with a DC 27

Spot check. Otherwise only a careful search of the

library can locate it. The Search DC is 20, and taking

20 automatically reveals the hollow book.

Shadow Mastiff

The creature wakes from stasis as soon as the stairs are

activated. It lurks in a shadowed area and waits for an

opportune moment to attack. Its usual tactic is to wait

until all party members have entered or until one of

the PCs is about to discover its location, then it lets

loose with a chilling howl to panic the interlopers.

Those who do not  ee are its  rst targets.

The  Enclave  of  Mages  has  magically  attuned

the creature to Planeshifters Knife. It is of only dim

intelligence,  but  it  is  an  outsider  and  has  a  simple

understanding of the weapons danger. If one of the

party  members  discovers  the  blade  and  removes  it

from the book, that character becomes the overriding

target of the shadow mastiffs attack.

QUICKSPURS ALLY

Quickspurs Ally is a steel kite shield completely devoid

of any coat of arms or identifying standard. The sur-

face of the shield is pristine and seamless.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 heavy steel shield;

Cost 1,170 gp. While wearing Quickspurs Ally, you

can guide a mount with your knees without making

a Ride check.

Omen: The shields outer surface displays a beauti-

fully rendered image that shifts to match your coat

of arms or the coat of arms of whomever else

wields it. If you have no

coat of arms, the shield

becomes blank.

HISTORY

Rendal  Feydrian  did

what  he  was  raised

to  dohe  served  the

knight  to  whom  he  had

been  indebted  by  his  fa-

ther. Rendals parents were

waylaid on the road by ban-

dits,  who  were  prepared  to

slit the fathers throat for mere

silver. Thats when young Sir Vernor

Arceldyn of the Celestial Order came

upon them by chance, drew his sword,

and drove the robbers away. Arceldyn was in need of

a place to sleep for that evening, and Rendals father

insisted the warrior stay at their woodcutters cot-

tage. The knight agreed, lodging there for two days.

So pleasant was the visit for all parties concerned

that Sir Vernor returned to the tiny house regularly

thereafter for brief visits, enjoying the calmness of

rural existence. Rendal was born during these times,

before his two younger siblings, but he was the only

one raised with expectations for becoming more than

a woodcutter. When Rendal came of age, Sir Vernor

took the boy as a squire. (DC 15)

Rendal fullled the role of squire as though born to

it, cheerfully mucking stables, currying horses, and

setting up campsites. No duty was too menial. The boy

also excelled at riding, sword ghting, and lancing

quintains. He grew strong and hale, his hard work

and industrious nature making him an ideal squire.

While  no  covetous  bone  existed  in  Rendals  body,

the boy was always fascinated by Sir Vernors magic

shield. Whenever the knight strapped the shield to his

arm, the Arceldyn family crest magically appeared on

its surface. Sir Vernor told Rendal this minor magic

Q uickspurs Ally protects a champion

who wields it from harm

changed the coat of arms depending on the wearers

lineage. (DC 20; Working Hands)

When  Sir  Vernor  rode  into  battle,  Rendal  rode

alongside him, ghting all the same opponents and

dispatching them in stride. The two fought as a team,

knowing each others blind spots and guarding them

perfectly. During one conict, Sir Vernor rode ahead

of his squire, driven by an eagerness to see the skir-

mish won. Rendal was still tied up with two opponents

when he noticed several spearmen surrounding his

mentor. The attackers had underestimated Rendal. Af-

ter quickly defeating the two soldiers he

faced, Rendal rode after Vernor, ar-

riving just in time to see the knight

driven through by many pikes.

The squire trampled some of the

enemy spearmen under hoof

and cleaved through the re-

maining ones with his sword.

He then rushed to his tutors

side. Wear my shield, Ver-

nor Arceldyn breathed as

his last words. With no

time to think, Rendal did

as he was told. The shield

erupted  with  eldritch

power as the family crest

of the Arceldyns emblazoned itself on the  surface.

(DC 25; Family Bearing)

Rendal had grown up never questioning why Sir

Vernor visited his house in the forest, nor why the

knight extended so many kindnesses to the peasant

family.  He  always  stayed  for  dinner,  talked  about

the latest campaign, spent the night, and departed

a few days later, leaving many pieces of gold behind.

Rendal never knew his father and mother had tried

to conceive for many years without success. When Sir

Vernor agreed to stay with the couple that rst evening

after saving their lives, Rendals father and mother

spoke to Vernor at length about their inability to have

childrenRendals father had suffered a terrible wound

earlier in his life. In the end, they asked Sir Arceldyn

if he might be of service. The knight, caring little for

the pompous women of the baronial court, agreed to

help father a child, with one provisionthe rst boy

child  would  become  his  squire.  These  realizations

ooded into Rendal as he nished the battle with his

blood fathers shield, bludgeoning his enemy into sub-

mission. Sir Vernor Arceldyn of the Celestial Order

had  left  instructions  for  his  squire  to  be  knighted

upon his death. Rendal thusly gained his spurs. So

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 7)

Quickspurs Ally is an heirloom in one PCs family,

forgotten in storage generations ago. An unscrupulous

warrior  from  a  rival  clan  quietly  stole  the  shield,

hoping to unlock the hidden potential of the item, but

she lacked the virtue to do so. Years passed without

anybody  realizing  the  shield  was  missinguntil

Quickspurs Ally turned up in the hands of Vandriel,

a paladin from the rival family. Vandriel insists the

shield can be tracked through her lineage, and hon-

estly believes this is true. Comparing notes, however,

shows the shield disappeared from the PCs heritage

only a short while before it shows up in Vandriels line.

The shields actual theft is an unknown factor that

would cause Vandriel to forfeit the shield willingly

could it be proven. Since this isnt the case, and both

families seem to have a legitimate claim, the sporting

paladin suggests a jousting competition for rightful

ownership of the shield, allowing the gods and skill

in arms to decide. If defeated, Vandriel honors her

word and gives up Quickspurs Ally.

sunder attempt provokes an attack of opportunity. A

successful blow deals lance damage (doubled because

both riders are charging), but its nonlethal. A char-

acter with the Ride-By Attack feat gains a +4 bonus

on attack rolls during a joust.

The following simple rules can add verisimilitude

to the contest. A joust is run in a series of contact

passes (usually three or four), and a contestant scores

points according to the quality of the strike. After

the prescribed number of passes, the high scorer is

the winner; one or more additional passes might be

run to break ties. The full rules for jousting can be

quite detailed, involving exact locations of strikes, but

these are not necessary to simulate the contest. See

the Complete Warrior supplement, page 130, for more

details on jousting.

Points Awarded

1 Point: A hit that merely glances off the opponents

shield. In game terms, this would be an attack that

misses only because of the shields armor bonus

(including enhancements, if any).

2 Points: A hit that lands solidly but is not followed

by a successful trip or sunder attempt.

3 Points: A hit that lands solidly and results in a

dismount or a broken weapon or shield.

Points Deducted

1 Point: Failing to present the shield. In game

terms, this is represented by using Dodge, Combat

Expertise, or similar tactical maneuvers to increase

Armor Class.

1 Point: Dropping the lance during the pass except

for safety reasons (in other words, not making an

attack roll).

1 Point: Misconduct (such as abusing the oppo-

nent  or  foul  language)  or  dangerous  or  reckless

behavior (sweeping the lance, removing the helmet,

and so forth).

Disqualification

Serious breaches of the rules mean an immediate end

to the contest. Three instances of misconduct or reck-

lessness result in ejection. Deliberate attacks against

an unarmed or unprepared opponent, or against the

opponents mount, are also cause for disquali cation

and perhaps criminal or civil charges, depending on

the severity of the offense.

HOW TO HANDLE A JOUST

In a traditional joust, two knights on horseback (or

in this case, a paladin and a mounted, armored PC)

charge each other with blunted lances, separated by a

rail that divides two parallel tracks. When they meet

in the middle, they clash with great momentum and

force, then continue down the track on their side of

the rail. They repeat the process until one rider yields

or is knocked from the saddle.

Initiative  isnt  necessary;  during  each  pass,  each

character makes an attack with the blunted lance, and

the results of both attacks are resolved simultaneously.

Make the attack roll normally; if it hits, the attacker

can also attempt to unhorse the opposing rider (treat

as a trip attack) or make a sunder attempt against the

enemys weapon or shield. Neither the trip nor the

ROD OF

TRIMEG

A 6-foot staff of white wood, the

Rod  of  Trimeg  is  capped  with  a

winged crown worked in silver.

Two silver snakes twine their way

up the shaft, their coils forming a

natural handgrip and their heads

facing inward. The butt of the

staff is likewise shod in silver,

with a stout spike perfectly de-

signed to pierce hard-packed earth

and aid in walking over rough terrain.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Masterwork

quarterstaff; Cost 2,000 gp. When holding the

Rod of Trimeg you are constantly protected by

an endure elements spell (CL 2nd). The wielder

of  the  Rod  of  Trimeg  also  gains  a  +2  circum-

stance bonus on Balance checks on rough or

uneven ground.

Omen: The Rod of Trimeg dislikes idleness. If

it is left unattended, it moves when no one is

watching it. The rod never goes far, nor does it

leave your vicinity, but it is frequently found in

odd places.

HISTORY

In a kingdom long since crumbled to dust, the

caduceusa rod capped with a winged crown,

twined with two serpentswas a potent magical

symbol. It represented knowledge, healing, and

travelers, along with countless other emblematic

meanings. Messengers and envoys commonly

carried the caduceus as a mark of their of ce

and inviolability, much like a white flag of

truce. The herald Trimeg, a legendary messenger

credited with many supernatural feats, carried

this particular rod. (DC 15)

Trimegs  name  first  rose  to  prominence

eight hundred years ago, during a fierce war

between the monarchies of Althec and Kar-

kos. The rulers of the two nations had once

been fast friends, but when they both discov-

ered evidence of the other sovereign making

clandestine  plans  of  invasion  and  conquest,

they immediately declared war upon one anoth-

er. Many costly battles followed. Trimeg, who

was then in the service of Althecs monarch,

was wary of the circumstanc-

es that led the two realms to

war.  He  kept  his  eyes  open

and  ears  sharp  as  he  bore  mis-

sives to various nobles who owed

fealty to the king. One fateful

night, Trimeg uncovered the bit-

ter truth when he overheard an

Althecan duke plotting with advi-

sors. The duplicitous duke planned

to hold his greatest forces in reserve,

and when Althec and Karkos were

weakened by the war, he designed

to snatch the crowns of both sover-

eigns.  According  to  legend,  Trimeg

 ed the castle with the dukes forces hard on his

trail, running all the way back to the capital of

Althec to tell the king. The brave messenger then

dashed all the way to Karkos to reveal the truth

to its queen. In that single night, the war ended.

(DC 18; Long Run)

A less-known story of Trimeg is the tale of how

he outwitted Nariel, a succubus trickster. Nariel

was  a  cunning  scoundrel,  and  she  bore  a  long-

standing  grudge  against  the  sorcerer  Malkuth.

As it happened, Trimeg was delivering a missive

from Malkuth to the count of Blandishalong

with a gift of a beautiful magic necklace for the

countessrespectfully  requesting  permission

to  gather  specimens  of  exotic  beasts  from  the

counts  forest  reserve.  Nariel  learned  of  this

through her infernal sources. Taking the guise

of a simple but beautiful peasant girl, she met

Trimeg on the road and convinced him to stay his

mission merely for the evening. While Trimeg

slept later that night, Nariel switched the mes-

sage  and  gift  with  her  own  and  departed  for

the Abyss. The demon could not so easily fool

the wily Trimeg. He recognized her wormwood

perfume as an odor especially pleasing to beings

from the Abyss. Before he even entered Nariels

home, Trimeg had already swapped the real mes-

sage for a false one and the real gift for an empty

box. With the true epistle and amulet tucked

safely into his cloak, he enjoyed the company

of the succubus and traveled on in the morning.

(DC 25; Canny Trickster)

Many more stories are told of Trimeg and his

adventures, but the greatestand, ironically, the

least well knownis his  nal tale. When Trimeg

had grown old and could no longer run as swiftly

as he had in his youth, he passed

his rod to Kadmon, his nephew.

legacy  honorably,  but  all  those  who  knew  him

agreed  that  he  was  no  Trimeg,  merely  an  adequate

messenger. Trimeg was saddened at how his nephew

was  mocked,  not  for  being  a  poor  messenger,  but

merely for not living up to an impossible legacy. The

old herald resolved to do something about it. He set

off once more, intending to travel the planes until he

found Fharlanghn, the god of roads, and entreated

the deity to bless Kadmon with gifts greater than his

own. Trimeg scoured the planes for a whole year, and

though the myths disagree on whether he circled the

Great Wheel one time, three times, or seven times,

he at long last found Fharlanghn in the Outlands.

Trimeg was near death by then, but he told the god

why he had come. Fharlanghn was so impressed by

the mortals tenacity, he agreed to Trimegs request.

The  deity  touched  Kadmons  caduceus,  the  very

same  one  the  young  man  inherited  from  Trimeg,

and imbued it with the speed, guile, and trickery

of Kadmons grandfather. When he saw this done,

Trimeg smiled, thanked Fharlanghn, and died. The

fables say Fharlanghn took Trimegs soul to himself

and made the renowned courier his personal emissary.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

While exploring the ruins of an ancient border fort,

the PCs come across a secret chamber hidden behind

a false wall (Search DC 20 to locate). Traps and hazard-

ous terrain guard the room, but at the far end of the

chamber, something can be seen gleaming on a large,

stone pedestal. Characters who navigate the traps can

claim the Rod of Trimeg.

Pits (CR 2)

The  rst three pits are 15 feet across and 20 feet deep.

Nasty  spikes  line  their  bottoms.  The  DC  to  jump

the  rst pit is 15, since enough room exists to get a

20-foot running start. The remaining pits, however,

require a DC 30 Jump check. The walls of the pits

are smooth, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to scale

(the DC drops to 5 if a rope can be secured for the

climb). A fall into one of these pits deals 2d6 points

of damage, and 1d4+1 spikes attack the faller. Each

spike  has  a  +10  melee  attack  bonus  and  deals  1d4

points of damage.

Balance Beam (CR 3)

The  narrow  beam  set  across  this  60-foot-deep  pit

requires a DC 15 Balance check to negotiate. Characters

failing by 5 or more fall off of the beam, but they can

catch  themselves  with  a  DC  20  Re ex  save.  Those

who fall into the pit take 6d6 points of damage from

the plunge.

Gust of Wind Trap

Designed to discourage  ying creatures from cir-

cumventing  the  balance  beam,  this  trap  consists

of permanent gust of wind spells traveling from left

to right. The wind is easily heard, and it crosses the

balance beam at the point indicated on the map. A

large grid of spikes mounted on the right wall waits

for those blown far enough to hit them. Someone

who hits the spikes is attacked by 1d4+1 of them.

Each spike has a +10 melee attack bonus and deals

1d4 points of damage.

Altar

The Rod of Trimeg rests atop this altar. Amazingly, it

is not trapped or protected in any way.

SCALES OF BALANCE

This 6-foot-tall, polished quarterstaff is made half from

white ash and half from darkwood so black it resembles

a clouded sky on a moonless night. At the center of

the staff, the two woods fuse together in a blend of

neutral gray. The staff is unadorned, but simply hold-

ing it is enough to reveal its unusual properties.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  Masterwork

quarter staff; Cost 920 gp. You gain a +1 bonus on

saves against death effects, energy drain, and any

effect that would induce fatigue or exhaustion.

Omen: When Scales of Balance is left unattended,

plants seem to grow and blossom with greater facil-

ity in the vicinity of the ash end, while vegetation

is more prone to shriveling and withering near the

darkwood end.

Little can be gleaned about this staffs purpose

or  history  from  its  appearance.  What  can  be

deduced is that it clearly symbolizes positive

and negative energies, life and death, in equal

balance  with  one  another.  A  sect  of  austere

warrior monks, the Brotherhood of the Bal-

anced Way, is known for its rejection of deity

worship and a planar cosmology, seeing all

so-called gods and planes as illusions resulting

from the imperfect discernment of the cosmic

precepts of positive and negative. The order

faded into obscurity some  ve decades ago,

after a violent and protracted struggle with

a monastic group devoted to the worship of

Wee Jas. This other organization apparently

took exception to their deity being referred

to as a  awed perception. Only a few of the

Balanced  Way  monks  survived  the  covert

war  of  assassinations  and  back-alley  duels,

and those who did scattered to the winds,

hoping to stay hidden and avoid retaliation

from the followers of Wee Jas. (DC 15)

One of the last disciples taken in by the

Brother hood of the Balanced Way, before

the  con ict  with  Wee  Jass  worshipers,

was a boy named Hemsi. A street urchin

caught stealing by one of the monks, Hemsi

was remanded to the care of the monastery

by the local magistrate, rather than being

placed in the pillories. Much to the sur-

prise of the other monks, not to

mention Hemsi himself, the lad

readily took to the Brotherhoods

odd, ascetic philosophy. Within weeks of

beginning his training, he would often stay

up through the night, debating philosophy

with the orders founders. Hemsi concluded

that to truly understand the unity of positive

and negative forces, one must experience each

to the fullest extreme possible. He became the

 rst monk of the Balanced Way to walk the

Threefold Paththe Road of Creation, the

Road of Annihilation, and the True Road. The

young monk began his spiritual journey on

the Road of Creation, dedicating himself heart

and soul to writing beautiful poetry, healing

the sick, and indulging in the positive aspects

of existence. (DC 18; Road of Creation)

Once he felt that he could gain no further

enlightenment from the Road of Creation,

Hemsi changed tack and embarked upon the

perilous Road of Annihilation. Where once he

had created beautiful art, now he put librar-

ies  and  museums  to  the  torch.  Where  once

he had healed, now he harmed. He did these

things  not  out  of  malice  or  evil,  but  because

he  truly  believed  directly  experiencing  these

forces  was  the  only  way  in  which  one  could

come  to  illumination.  It  was  around  this

time that the troubles with Wee Jass faithful

began, though it is unknown if that feud began

because of Hemsis acts or not. It is known that

Hemsi  challenged  many  of  the  monks  of  Wee

Jas to battle and defeated them handily, which

certainly exacerbated the situation. Wee Jass fol-

lowers struck back by slaughtering the less capable

monks of the Balanced Way indiscriminately, and

soon fewer than a dozen of Hemsis comrades were

left alive. When the grandmaster of the monks of

Wee  Jas  challenged  Hemsi  to  a  duel,  the  young

monk knew that, one way or another, his quest for

enlightenment would soon be over. (DC 25; Road

of Annihilation)

The grandmaster of the death goddesss cult arrived

at the gates of the Monastery of the Balanced Way

before dawn. He carried a simple staff of blackened

darkwood, a gift, he claimed, from Wee Jas herself,

imbued with powerful death magic. Hemsi met the

challenger, carrying a staff of plain, unadorned white

ash. The two monks bowed to one another, and the

battle was joined. Their  ght was long and  erce, and

neither  monk  possessed  a  clear

advantage. The rhythmic clacking

of their staffs  lled the morning air,

The staff known as Scales of Balance dispenses

life and death in equal measure

and the rest of the monks looked on in breathless antici-

pation. Finally, Hemsis opponent saw an opening and

thrust his staff, the tip crackling with negative energy,

at Hemsis ribcage. Hemsi parried the blow, his own

staff shining with white light. As the weapons touched,

the power surging through them drew them together,

fusing them into one. Hemsi was enlightened. Taking

up the united staff, he easily defeated the grandmaster.

Then, with a bow and a mysterious smile, he tossed

the weapon to one of his fellow monks and vanished.

The  rest  of  the  Balanced  Way  practitioners  ed  the

city, fearing the retribution of their rivals. With them

went the Scales of Balance. Neither Hemsi nor the staff

has been seen since. (DC 31; True Road)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of the Scales of Balance.

Road of Creation: You have to spend at least one

week immersing yourself in all aspects of positive

existencecreation, spontaneity, physical exertion,

healing, and so on. The DM is free to extend the time

requirement of this ritual. Cost: 3,600 gp. Feat Granted:

Least Legacy (Scales of Balance).

Road of Annihilation: For one week, you must be a

force of destruction and entropy, thoroughly throwing

yourself into the negative. The goal is to understand the

destructive aspects of nature and existence, not debased

wallowing in wanton slaughter and ruin. Cost: 12,500

gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy (Scales of Balance).

True  Road:  The  most  difcult  road  is  the  True

Road, which lies between the two extremes of positive

and  negative.  Walking  the  True  Road  requires  an

understanding of the cosmic balance of life and death,

order and chaos. It should include a journey to both the

Positive and Negative Energy Planes, interactions with

natives of each, and at least a week of meditation and

abstemious inward focus. Cost: 40,500 gp. Feat Granted:

Greater Legacy (Scales of Balance).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Monks and clerics are the most likely to have the

spiritual tendencies necessary to wield the Scales of

Balance, but any character with a philosophical bent

could make use of the staff.

Scales of Balance Wielder Requirements

Balance 3 ranks

Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Scales

of Balance.

Eye of Mortality (Su): At 6th level and higher,

three times per day as a standard action, you can point

Scales of Balance at another creature to determine that

creatures nature. This works like the detect undead

spell, except that it affects only a single creature and

reveals  that  creatures  aura  strength  on  the  same

round you activate this feature. Further, this ability

reveals whether the creature is a mortal living creature

(anything besides a construct, elemental, outsider, or

undead), an immortal living creature (elemental or

outsider), or an undead creature. A construct presents

no aura when subject to this effect, and such a creature

is thereby revealed as a construct. Caster level 5th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

The PCs are visiting an acquaintance in a sick house

for  people  who  cannot  afford  clerics  to  heal  their

highly  contagious  illnesses.  While  there,  they  see  a

young man in simple robes moving among the sick,

administering to them. After a moments observation,

it becomes obvious that for every two persons he treats,

one dies while the other shows marked improvement.

The  pattern  of  death  is  too  constant  and  speci c  to

be anything other than deliberate murder. If the PCs

question the monk, he tells them he is attempting to

gain enlightenment through contemplation of the bal-

ance between positive and negative forces. The monk

further informs the characters they shall experience

the truth  rst hand. He then attacks.

SCARAB OF ARADROS

The Scarab of Aradros is a golden medallion shaped like

a beetle, ringed with ancient arcane runes.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Scarab of resistance +1;

Cost 1,500 gp. You also gain a +1 bonus on caster level

checks made to dispel or counter

a spell.

Omen: If you are capable

of casting arcane spells

and wear the scarab for

at least 1 hour, it grows

warm and the beetle

occasionally twitches

and  chirps  (audible

only to the wearer).

HISTORY

The Scarab of Aradros

protected its noble wearer

in ancient times

The Scarab of Aradros was

forged  in  ancient  days

when the world was dif-

ferent,  and  races  more

primal than those alive

today stalked its primor-

dial  darks.  Humans  were  all  but  unknown,  and

elves were numerous. Several mighty clans of elves

battled  each  other  for  supremacy  over  lands  since

fallen beneath the waves. One of these great elven

houses was named Aradros, and the Scarab of Aradros

takes its moniker from that lineage. (DC 17)

In the time primeval, the water-bounded dominion

of Aradros grew strong and inuential. Neighboring

realms, on nearby isles and the distant mainland,

began to have their doubts about the house. Other

clans  started  to  fear  that  the  magically  inclined

scions of Aradros wished to expand their inuence

more  significantly  and  at  the  expense  of  other

domains. Perhaps this fear was justified, because

it  was  during  the  reign  of  Aradros  VI  that  the

Scarab of Aradros was secretly forged and given to

an agent of the crownthe prince himself. Prince

Dalwin,  who  was  charged  with  reconnoitering

the surrounding isles, used the scarab to protect

himself during his quest in unfriendly lands. (DC

19; Quest of Far Journeys)

Prince  Dalwin  of  Aradros  was  known  as  an

accomplished  thaumaturge,  despite  his  relative

youth. When he journeyed forth from the land of his

birth, he did so in the company of magical familiars

and under the cloak of a sorcerous guise, one that

would protect him from notice by those he wished

to observe. However, despite the secrecy of his quest

and the supernatural disguises he created, Aradross

enemies discovered the princes quest. They engi-

neered  an  ambush.  When  Prince  Dalwin  made

landfall at the third island kingdom on his itinerary,

a magical conagration slew everyone in

his company, but the protective forces

of the Scarab of Aradros saved him.

The prince barely escaped inland,

burned but alive, all alone in a

nation alerted to his presence

and certain of his evil intent.

Dalwin was overcome despite

several heroic stands, including

the Clash at Umandil, the Battle

of Uyn, and the Stand at Seas Edge.

The Scarab of Aradros was lost and

its  power  forgotten.  (DC  27;

Dalwins Lament)

LEGACY

RITUALS

Two rituals are required to

unlock all the abilities of

the Scarab of Aradros.

part of the successful Knowledge (history) check.

Cost: 13,500 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy (Scarab

of Aradros).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Arcane spellcasters derive the most benet from the

Scarab of Aradros. Wizards and sorcerers are the most

of Aradros.

Arcane Health (Su): Starting at 5th level, you gain

10 temporary hit points (similar to those granted by

a false life spell) each day at sunrise. These hit points

remain until expended or 24 hours pass.

Winged  Range  (Su):  At  6th  level  and  higher,

you  can  cast  up  to  three  arcane  spells  per  day  of

up to 3rd level that are extended as though using

the Extend Spell metamagic feat. Using this legacy

ability does not change the level of the spell slot of

the altered spell. A spontaneous spellcaster (such as

a sorcerer) must still take a full-round action when

using this ability, just as if using a metamagic feat

he possessed.

At 12th level, you can extend three arcane spells

per day that are 6th level or lower.

Carapaced Nerves (Su): As the Scarab of Aradros

builds a connection with you, it aids your ability to

focus your mind. At 8th level, you gain a +5 bonus on

Concentration checks.

Survive Any Extreme (Su): Starting at 11th level,

at will as an immediate action, you can grant yourself

resistance 30 to one type of energy (acid, cold, electric-

ity, re, or sonic). This effect lasts for 1 minute. Caster

level 10th.

Scarab  Shell  (Su):  At  15th  level  and  higher,  as

long as you have one arcane spell remaining (either a

prepared spell not yet cast or a spell slot not yet used),

you benet from the effects of a shield spell. Caster

level 10th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 8)

While exploring a subterranean area near the edge

of  the  sea,  the  adventurers  stumble  into  a  cavity

lled with copper coins and ruined art objects. These

are  the  remnants  of  a  pirate  hoard  that  has  been

looted  of  most  valuables.  Four  vampire  spawn  use

the  chamber  to  house  their  grave-dirt  receptacles.

Among the heaps of coins and trash can be found

the Scarab of Aradros.

Vampire Spawn (4): hp 29 each (see page 253 of

the Monster Manual).

THE SCARAB OF ARADROS

IN EBERRON

The ancient elven kingdom of Aradros bears striking

similarities to Aerenal, the island home of Eberrons

elves and seat of the Undying Court. Indeed, thou-

sands  of  years  in  the  past,  the  elves  of  Aerenal

conquered their island after overcoming the slave

lords of Xendrik and eeing that terrible continent.

They established an outpost on Khorvaire during the

days of the Empire of Dhakaan but became distrusted

by that nations hobgoblin emperor. Eventually war

broke out between the two kingdoms, and the elves

retreated to Aerenal until the Last War presented an

opportunity to reestablish a foothold.

To customize this legacy item to Eberron, simply

make  Prince  Dalwin  an  agent  of  Aerenal.  While

exploring  the  intervening  islands  and  the  inland

reaches of Khorvaire, he was exposed and confronted

by Dhakaans forces. Now the Scarab of Aradros rests

in a hidden cave along Valenars southern coast. The

Undying Court wishes to recover the item and has

sent exploring parties of xenophobic elves to locate

it. For an out-of-the-ordinary adventure idea, have

Dalwins  last  stand  take  place  in  the  final  battle

at  Taer  Sadaen.  The  Scarab  of  Aradros  might  have

been swept out of time along with the ruins of that

ancient fortress.

SHISHI-O

Shishi-O, the Sword of Lions, is a marvelously crafted

katana with a blade of bright, immaculate steel and a

gold tsuba (guard) worked to resemble a pair of male

lions circling the blade. The

hilt  is  ivory  inlaid  with

more  gold,  all  wrapped

in  purple  silk  and  capped

with  a  golden  lions  head

bearing  amethyst  eyes  and

ruby teeth.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics:

+1 katana; Cost 2,535 gp. Katanas

have the same game statistics as

bastard  swords.  The  blades  roar

grants  you  a  +2  circumstance

bonus on any Intimidate check

made  during  the  same  round

you draw the sword.

Omen:  Whenever  the  blade

is  drawn,  this  lions  head  lets  out

a  mighty  roar  that  can  be  heard  for

approximately  a  quarter  of  a  mile.  You

can attempt a DC 15 Will save to compel

the sword not to roar.

HISTORY

Shishi-O was the katana of the celebrated

samurai Yorimasa, who earned it as reward for

slaying a demon dwelling within his emperors

palace.  The  origins  of  the  weapon  remain  a

mystery, but rumors suggest a court mage or a

nature spirit forged it. Tales of the sword tell of

the great strength and ferocity it bestows upon its

wielder, and some stories hint the blade gave its

owners dominion over beasts and birds, or even the

ability to transform into a lion to do battle. (DC 15)

In the twilight of his life, Yorimasa witnessed a ter-

rible event. The emperor to whom the aging samurai

had been a loyal servant died, and a new sovereign took

the throne. The new emperor was a spiteful, heartless

man,  a  tyrant  who  sought  to  crush  all  beneath  his

heel. Yorimasa, who had been a great hero since his

youth, took up the famed Shishi-O and gathered his

retainers  to   ght  the  wicked  emperors  forces.  The

outnumbered rebels inevitably met their

ends at the bridge of Uji, where Yorimasa

and his companions made a valiant stand.

Yorimasa, maimed and unable to face death

in combat, fell on his own sword before

he could be captured. One of the venerable samurais

loyal  retainers  decapitated  him.  That  noble  person,

whose name is now lost to time, then threw the head

and Shishi-O into the river, so the emperors lackeys

could  not  claim  the  celebrated  weapon,  nor  parade

Yorimasas head through the streets. (DC 18; Prayer

for the Valiant Soul)

Many centuries ago, when the illustrious samurai

Yorimasa was at the height of his power, a demon came

to dwell in the palace of the emperor. This malign spirit

made  life  miserable  for  the  household  servants  and

courtiers. Finally, the emperor could stand it no longer.

He sent for the bravest warriors in the empire to come

to his palace and slay the  end. Of all those summoned,

only  Yorimasa  answered  the  emperors  call.  Armed

with nothing but his katana, he entered the wing of the

palace where the demon laired and killed it with one

swift stroke. As a reward for this great deed, Yorimasa

was granted a parcel of land to rule in the emperors

name, one of the emperors loveliest courtesans, and the

mighty katana Shishi-O. (DC 25; Cutting Jigoku)

Unknown  to  most  mortals,  including  Yorimasa,

Shishi-O was forged in the Beastlands in the realm

of Karasuthra, the domain of the night-hunters. Its

maker  is  a  leonal  named  Loric,  who  fashioned  the

sword as a gift to the mysterious entity known as the

Lion General. After the katana was complete, but be-

fore Loric could bestow his offering upon the Lion

General, a mischievous celestial magpie stole the

Shishi-O and  itted away, singing merrily about

how she tricked the great warrior Loric and stole

his sword. Loric hounded the magpie for days

without surcease, but the massive leonal could

not follow the thieving bird through the tiny

portals and hidden paths she took. Eventu-

ally, the magpie grew bored with Shishi-O

and  dropped  it  on  the  Material  Plane.  It

was found by a loyal samurai and brought

to the emperor as a gift. (DC 31; Rite of

Contrition ritual)

Tables

The tables in this inn are sturdy and well built. Char-

acters can leap onto them with a DC 10 Jump check,

gaining  the  bene t  of   ghting  on  higher  ground.

Mugs, plates, and bottles make the footing precari-

ous, though, and a DC 10 Balance check is required

to avoid slipping and falling from the table, taking

1d6 points of nonlethal falling damage.

Rugs

These rugs can be yanked out from under an adversarys

feet with a successful Strength check opposed by the

opponents  Strength  or  Dexterity  check,  whichever

is higher. If more than one person is standing on the

rug, each character must make the check, but all those

Stoves

A character adjacent to a stove can attempt to push an

enemy onto it and hold him there. This tactic works

like an attempt to deal damage to an opponent in a

grapple, except that the grappled character takes 1d6

in addition to any unarmed damage dealt.

himself  as  Matsuo,  challenges  the  most  combat-

focused character to a duel of honor. Matsuo doesnt

explain why he wants this  ght, except to say that he

wishes to prove himself. He insists on single combat,

using no spells or magical enhancements other than

weapons and healing potions. The combat is to last

until one of the participants surrenders or is uncon-

scious due to wounds. If the challenged character

refuses his contest, Matsuo becomes steadily more

aggressive toward that character, the other PCs, and

eventually the innocent patrons of the inn. Matsuo

always starts a duel by drawing Shishi-O, followed

by an Intimidate check to demoralize his opponent

(which bene ts from the katanas roar).

SIMPLE BOW

The Simple Bow is a wooden longbow of unusual size

and asymmetrical shape, with the grip lower down

the length of the weapon, making it look awkward

to shoot. While its appearance is plain, this bow is

exceedingly well made.

Omen:  With  the  bow  in  hand,  you  can  perfectly

HISTORY

Furukaze Miyo, the spoiled son of a wealthy merchant,

traveled everywhere with his

father.  During  these  jour-

neys,  Miyo  was  allowed  to

indulge himself in just about

any way he saw t. One night,

after an evening of debauchery,

the  adolescent  found  himself  in

the arms of a wise and lovely older

woman named Chimiko. The two fell

in love. Miyo met Chimiko when-

ever he visited the same town, and

she  came  to  call  him  my  Wind,

because  she  knew  hed  always  re-

turn to her. Through Chimiko, Miyo

came  to  love  archery,  for  she  spoke

often  of  her  great  respect  for  master

archers. To show his devotion to her,

Miyo vowed to become the worlds

greatest  archer  before  returning

to her arms. At their parting, Chi-

miko gave Miyo the longbow that

would later come to be known as

the Simple Bow. (DC 15)

When Miyo left Chimiko, he was

barely a man, but he was shrewd and

quick to learn. Before his twentieth

birthday he had become an expert

archer  and  supported  himself  by

winning competitions. Miyo spent years learning from

unconventional archers willing to share their secrets.

These veterans treated Miyo as a younger brother, al-

ways impressed with his vigor and discipline. Miyo,

however, was never awed by his instructors. The young

archer drifted from teacher to teacher, gleaning ev-

erything he could from each one. He practiced trick

archery  to  challenge  himself  and  found  that  ring

blindfolded, catching arrows, and avoiding shots came

easily to him. (DC 20; The Arrow is the Master)

On one occasion, Miyo mentioned to a fellow ar-

cher that he most enjoyed the moment before ring

an arrow, when the future becomes clear. The other

reacted with only a confused stare, and it dawned on

Miyo that he might learn more from wise folk than

warriors. Ever motivated by his enduring love for Chi-

miko, Miyo then traveled to monasteries across the

country. He heard of a magic of the mind that grew

within persons of wisdom, granting them otherworld-

ly powers. He sought those who knew such secrets,

and ascetics he met told Miyo that eating mixtures of

certain herbs and venoms might let him tap into these

abilities. Sadly, even with the aid of such foul remedies,

Miyo remained without psionic power. Believing he

had  failed,  he  remembered  Chimikos  wordsMy

Wind always returns to me. Miyo realized that even

without the understanding he sought,

Chimiko would welcome him into

her arms again. He was nearly thir-

ty, which had been Chimikos age

when they originally parted com-

pany. Miyo wondered if they would

even recognize one another. (DC 25;

Finding the Master Within)

When Miyo was reunited with

Chimiko,  he  was  amazed  to  nd

that she had not aged a day. For the

rst time, Chimiko explained that

she was not truly human. She was

elana race with human roots

but evolved into much more. She

had sought Miyo out so many

years  earlier  because  of  the

psionic  potential  she  sensed

in his mind, but he was still too

young then to survive the elan

evolution  process.  Chimiko

made it clear that if Miyo chose

to become elan, he would be

immortal but would also lose

his lifetime of learning to

date.  Miyo  thought  about

this. He was worried about how the transformation

might change him. Having lived for only thirty years,

he  could  only  imagine  what  a  burden  immortality

might be. He had spent his entire adult life becoming

widely recognized as the greatest archer of his time and

wondered if he would be able to bear losing that. Miyo

eventually decided to let his bow make the decision. He

would re a single arrow into an orchard, using none

of  his  instincts  or  nely  tuned  senses.  If  the  arrow

Though unassuming in appearance, the

Simple Bow makes an archer of great skill

into one of legendary ability

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

Furukaze  Miyo  was  cremated  and  his  remains

entombed beneath the Jin monastery many years ago.

The monastery is now a scattered ruin surrounded

by dense forest. Shortly before Miyo died of natural

causes, he used his powerful psionic abilities to bind

elemental spirits to a number of terracotta warriors

for the purpose of guarding his remains and ensur-

ing they would not be desecrated. In recent years, the

powers binding the spirits have begun to wear thin,

allowing the terracotta warriors to escape and attack

nearby villages. A leader from one of these communi-

ties  asks  the  PCs  to  investigate  the  ruins  of  the  old

monastery and end the strange threat. As an incentive,

the  leader  also  reveals  that  the  ancient  master  was

entombed along with all his worldly possessionsthe

order was by no means an ascetic one. Only three out of

nine terracotta warriors remain in the tomb. Explorers

who defeat the terracotta warriors can nd Simple Bow

wrapped in ne silks and hanging from a wall.

A move earth spell drives the warrior back

120 feet and deals it 3d12 points of damage.

A disintegrate spell slows the warrior (as the slow

spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals it 1d12 points

of damage. An earthquake spell cast directly on

a terracotta warrior stops it from moving on its

next turn and deals it 5d10 points of damage.

The construct gets no saving throw against any of

these effects.

Any magical attack that would deal acid dam-

age to a terracotta warrior instead heals 1 point of

damage for every 3 points of damage it normally

deals. If the amount of healing causes the warrior to

exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess

as temporary hit points. Temporary hit points last

for 1 hour, and the warriors hit point total cannot

increase to more than twice its normal total as a

result of exposure to acid damage. A terracotta war-

rior gets no saving throw against magical attacks

dealing acid damage.

this area. Nine terracotta warriors once existed here,

but only three remain intact, one of which stands in

and fabrics.

SKULL LASH

Skull Lash is a gruesome ail of crude and barbaric design.

The haft is carved from the thighbone of a dire lion

and wrapped in dark red leather of questionable origin.

Attached to the handle are long, thick leather cords, and

at the end of each hangs a different bleached skull.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 heavy ail; Cost

2,315 gp. The ail enhances your existing ability to

enter a rage or frenzy, extending the duration of the

ability by 1 round.

Omen: When you enter a rage while wielding Skull

Lash, the skulls on the end of the weapon roar in furi-

ous anger.

HISTORY

The barbarian tribes of the

vast  southern  scablands

believe the skull of a van-

quished  enemy  contains

a  measure  of  his  might.

To  possess  the  skull  of

ones  enemy  is  to  gain

not only its knowledge,

but also the power that

enemy wielded in life.

Many warriors of the scablands

decorate their armor, shields, and

weapons with skulls or pieces of

skulls, but only a truly fearsome

leader can wield the legendary power of Skull Lash. This

massive ail has been carried by dozens of chieftains

and war-leaders, and each added his personal trophies to

the weapon. Today, Skull Lash might possess any num-

ber of abilities, depending upon the skulls it carries

(although only one skull has an effect on the weapons

abilities at any one time). (DC 15)

In the scablands, the scions of a powerful warrior

dynasty have carried Skull Lash for over three hundred

years. The weapon has been passed from father to son

(and in two exceptional cases, father to daughter) for

generations, with each warrior adding the trophies of

his or her greatest kills to the weapon. By tradition,

the  ail  is  stripped  of  its  previous  owners  prizes,

but in times of war, the pragmatism of having such

a potent weapon often outweighs this tradition. The

most recent warrior to wield the ail was Arne, the

bodyguard  of  a  powerful  chieftain  and  the  most

prominent general of his tribe. Arnes ghting prow-

ess was legendary across the scablands, and it is said

that the skulls of a blue dragon, a hobgoblin warlord,

and a dire lion decorated Skull Lash while he carried it.

Arne died in battle ten years ago, leaving no heir, and

his people claim they buried the ail with him. Such

a potent mystical weapon is a temptation to even the

most righteous of persons, however, and it is possible

some other warrior spirited Skull Lash away after Arne

was buried. (DC 18; Rite of the First Skull)

While Arne was certainly a fearsome ghter, evi-

dence  suggests  he  did  not  collect  all  of  the  skulls

adorning Skull Lash when he wielded it. His grand-

father Cornash is known to have added a blue dragons

skull to the ail, and it is likely this skull is the same

one Arne used. Sixty years ago, a mated pair of young

adult blues, working together in a fashion uncommon

to their species, threatened to destroy the bar-

barians with raids on the tribes, including

Cornashs. While one dragon drew off the

warriors by attacking their villages, the

other pounced on livestock or cara-

vans supposedly under the tribes

protection.  After  several  such

assaults claimed dozens of

lives  and  vast  resources

in terms of animals and

trade goods, Cornash set

out with the intent to prove

his courage and strength by slaying

both dragons. Traveling light and

trusting to the scablands to provide

for his needs, Cornash tracked the

pair for weeks until the female broke off to deal with

an encroaching brass dragon trying to claim territory

in the scablands. Cornash waited until the ght was

brought to its grisly conclusion, then pounced on the

weakened blue and slew her. After rendering the beasts

head down to polished bone, he trussed the skull to

Skull Lash and tracked down and vanquished the male.

(DC 25; Rite of the Second Skull)

Cornash  received  Skull  Lash  from  his  mother,  the

warrior Alnaya, who inherited it from her father after

her two brothers died in a rockslide before coming

of age. With no male heir to receive Skull Lash, that

sacred burden fell to Alnaya, who had until that point

expected to be married off to a wealthy herdsman and

spend her life raising children. She reluctantly took

up the training of a warrior. The rst test of her pluck

came much sooner than she expected, when the witch

doctors of a rival tribe, the Black Falcons, ensorcelled

a  band  of  hobgoblin  warriors  and  turned  them  on

Alnayas  people.  While  lesser  hobgoblin  warriors

diverted the major part of the barbarian troops, the

foul goblinoids leader and elite ghters overran the

Skull Lash confers many different abilities on its

wielder, depending on the skull it bears

village, cutting a swath of destruction toward the cave

where the women, children, and elderly of the tribe hid.

Alnaya took up her fathers ail without hesitation and

faced the monsters together with her tribes shaman.

Thanks to Alnayas courage and the shamans spells, the

hobgoblin leader fell. The attack was broken, and a week

later, when Alnaya led the counterattack against the

Black Falcons, the skull of a hobgoblin warlord hung

from her ail. (DC 31; Rite of the Third Skull)

SLING OF THE DIRE WIND

Sling of the Dire Wind is a sling made from dark, tightly

woven cord and a thick piece of leather etched with

runes written in Giant.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 sling; Cost 2,300 gp.

Any stones red from this sling act as bullets, taking

no penalty on attack rolls and dealing normal sling

damage. Finally, while sized for Medium creatures,

this weapon automatically resizes to t the hands of

a Small wielder and is then treated as a Small sling.

Omen: If the sling is swung overhead while loaded,

a light breeze surrounds you.

HISTORY

Sling of the Dire Wind would never have existed had it

not been for a quiet boy named Cyril. Cyrils father had

given up the art of war and refused to teach

his son how to use a sword, so

Cyril devoted himself to the

humble sling instead. He

practiced  constantly,

mastering the weap-

on at a young age,

hitting any target

he set for himself.

Then  a  day  came

when bandits raided

Cyrils village. The rob-

bers where out for blood, having

lost a few of their number to a re-

gional guard patrol. Cyril loosed

rock after rock at the invaders, knocking them from

their horses and incapacitating many. After single-

handedly preventing a massacre, the taciturn youth

became a peasant hero, and a local militia leader soon

offered to train Cyril further. (DC 15)

Against his fathers wishes, Cyril readily embraced

the soldiers life, but he became famous for his method

of slaying monsters. Cyril toppled hill giants with his

sling  and  knocked  manticores  out  of  the  sky  with

loosed stones. No matter how much martial training

he acquired or how strong he became, his focus never

changed. Cyril was neither an outspoken man nor a

well-traveled one, preferring the comforts of his rural

home. But the moment some creature threatened his

community, Cyril was the rst to face off against the

beast, Sling of the Dire Wind in hand.

Like  many  legendary  heroes  who  cling  to  their

simple  lives,  Cyrils  was  torn  from  him.  His  fame

began to attract challengers, warriors who wanted to

test their mettle against the youth who had defeated

uncounted foes with nothing more than leather, cord,

and stone. (DC 20; Harness the Gale)

Cyril wanted none of his fame. His skills were meant

for repelling creatures threatening innocent lives, not

showmanship. When he was a man, he retreated into

seclusion  with  his  wife,  hoping  the  fanfare  would

subside with his absence. His disappearance only in-

creased his reputation. The aristocracy had become

curious about the boy who never missed his mark,

and they tracked Cyril down and hounded him un-

til he agreed to demonstrate his skill publicly. After a

couple of lackluster shots and more than a few misses,

the audience was ready to riot, having traveled so many

leagues into the forest for nothing. A group of ogres, at-

tracted by all the noise, suddenly fell upon the crowds.

Cyril reacted with instincts honed by conict, slaying

the foul creatures in short order using only his

sling. The audience was stunned at the

mans true skill. A representative

of the king asked Cyril to re-

turn to his village, where

he would be available to

help  defend  the  king-

dom  in  time  of  need.

Cyril reluctantly agreed.

(DC 25; The Modest Way)

Cyril had dispatched many

monsters  in  his  life,  making

more than a few enemies. Now

these foes knew exactly where to

nd the man and his sling. Life

quickly became unbearable in the little village, repeated

attacks plaguing the place as if the creatures sought

Cyril out. After an ettin wreaked havoc on the com-

munity, Cyrils father demanded he leave before more

innocents were harmed. Cyril agreed without protest

and left again with his wife, but the monsters were

unrelenting. A pair of trolls found Cyrils woodland

hideaway at a moment when Cyril was out hunting.

His wife was alone. Cyril arrived to nd the giants

standing over his beloveds corpse, and he ew into

a murderous rage. One of the trolls died quickly, but

Cyril extracted the awful truth from the second. The

king had been sending monsters after Cyril, probably

hoping the slinger would kill each in its turnhe

had become an unwitting exterminator for the crown.

With anger beyond reason, Cyril rode to the royal city,

stood outside the walls, and launched stone after stone

at the fortications, destroying huge sections of wall

with rocks no larger than big pebbles. Archers atop

the battlements returned re. Watching the volley

as it arced through the sky toward him, Cyril stood in

place for a long moment, throwing his arms wide as

the deadly shafts crossed the nal few feet. When he

closed his arms again, he found himself embracing

his beloved. (DC 30; Simplicity Lost)

Pebble to Boulder (Su): When you attain 8th level,

any stone or bullet slung from Sling of the Dire Wind

deals damage as if you and the weapon were two size

categories larger than you truly are. This effective

size for purposes of damage dealt increases by one

every four levels after 8th, as noted on Table 341.

For example, in the hands of a Medium creature, Sling

of  the  Dire  Wind  deals  1d8  points  of  damage  at  8th

level, 2d6 points of damage at 12th level, 3d6 points

of damage at 16th level, and 4d6 points of damage at

20th level.

Destructive Power (Su): At 10th level and higher,

ammunition slung from Sling of the Dire Wind is con-

sidered adamantine for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction (in addition to any other special

material the ammunition is actually composed of).

Wind  Wall  (Sp):  Beginning  at  15th  level,  three

times per day on command, you can use wind wall as

the spell. You can create only a cylindrical wall, and

the ammunition you sling from Sling of the Dire Wind

is unaffected by the spell. Caster level 10th.

Forceful Strike (Su): At 18th level and higher, any

creature struck by a stone or bullet slung by Sling of the

Dire Wind can be pushed back as if by a bull rush. For

resolving the bull rush, the stones Strength modier

is +15. The stone cant push a target back more than

5 feet.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

The day Cyril died, the air spirits of the forests took

Sling of the Dire Wind before anybody else claimed it.

A guardian was assigned to watch over the weapon

until  a  replacement  worthy  of  Cyrils  legacy  could

be found. Rumors suggest the sling has since been

spotted  dangling  from  a  tree  branch  in  the  forest

one moment, only to disappear the next. In the deep

wilderness, the heroes happen to spot a sling in just

such  a  precarious  position.  Reaching  for  the  sling

causes an air steward to appear, and the creature does

battle to defend the weapon from unworthy hands.

Stunning Stone (Su) 3/day can declare a slung

projectile a stunning stone before making an attack

roll. Struck target must make a DC 11 Fortitude save

or be stunned for 1 round. A miss wastes the use.

Whirlwind (Su) Once every 10 minutes, transform

into whirlwind for 2 rounds; 5-foot base, up to 30-

foot top, 1030 feet tall. Move at fly speed. Does

not provoke attacks of opportunity in whirlwind

form. Cannot attack or threaten an area in

whirlwind form.

Small or smaller creatures must succeed on a

DC 14 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of damage,

and a second DC 14 Reflex save to avoid being

picked up and held. A flying creature can attempt a

Reflex save to escape (but still takes damage). The

air steward can eject carried creatures at any time.

Those caught in the whirlwind take a 4 penalty to

Dexterity, a 2 penalty on attack rolls, and must

make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to

cast a spell. The whirlwind can only contain as many

creatures as fit in its volume.

If the base touches the ground, it creates a

swirling cloud of debris centered on the air steward,

diameter half the whirlwinds height, obscures

all vision (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet.

Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those

farther away have total concealment. Those caught

in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC

15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

Air Stewards Realm

This  map  depicts  a  peaceful  stretch  of  walkway

through  the  forest.  Off  to  one  side,  almost  as  an

afterthought, a sling dangles from a branch, swaying

in the breeze.

Sling of the Dire Wind

A DC 15 Spot check allows a character to notice the

sling, which is not immediately visible from the path.

USEFUL FEATS FOR

SLING WIELDERS

Although characters of any class and race can wield

Sling of the Dire Wind, hal ings have a special af n-

ity with slings. Despite its low initial damage (even

less for a Small wielder), a number of feats from Races

of the Wild make the sling a devastating weapon even

before its legacy abilities kick in. With their natural

abilities in hiding and climbing, as well as their af n-

ity for the rogue class with its sneak attack ability,

hal ings are especially suited to these feats.

The Woodland Archer tactical feat from that book is

an interesting complement, once the wielders attack

bonus is high enough. It offers several options that

make attacks from even a nonlegacy sling accurate

and deadly.

Able Sniper

You  are  accomplished  at  remaining  unseen  when

youre sniping with a ranged weapon.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Hide 5 ranks.

Bene  t: You gain a +2 bonus on ranged attack rolls

with a weapon made against  at-footed targets that are

at least one range increment away. In addition, you

gain a +4 bonus on Hide checks made to hide again

after you have made an attack roll while hiding (see

page 76 of the Players Handbook).

Plunging Shot

You can use the force of gravity to make your ranged

attacks deal extra damage if your target is below you.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.

Bene  t: If your target is at least 30 feet lower than

you, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with a

thrown or projectile weapon.

STAFF OF THE

TORRENT MOONS

Staff of the Torrent Moons is a lajatang, composed of a

darkwood shaft with two crescent-shaped blades, forged

from a rare blue-tinted metal, attached to either end.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  Masterwork/+1

lajatang; Cost 2,720 gp; Dmg 1d8+1/1d8; Critical 2;

Range Increment ; Weight 7 lb.; Type Slashing. The

lajatang is an exotic, two-handed, double weapon that

can be prociently wielded by any character with the

Exotic Weapon Prociency (lajatang) feat. A character

can ght with a lajatang as if ghting with two weap-

ons, incurring all the normal attack penalties of using

a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A monk

who is procient with the

lajatang can wield it as a

special  monk  weapon.

Each  end  counts  as  a

separate weapon for the

purpose of the urry of

blows ability, similar to how

the quarterstaff works.

Omen: While carrying Staff

of the Torrent Moons, you and

your equipment are instantly

from a body of water.

HISTORY

Inukai Satoru was born to

unwedded  parents  who

loved each other deeply.

Shortly  after  the  boys

birth, however, his father

drowned in a ood while

saving  Satorus  mother

from the deluge. With-

out  much  propriety,  the

eldest son of the local noble

family then began to court Satorus

beautiful mother, and she accepted the nobles mar-

riage proposal soon after, even with the condition

that  she  must  give  up  her  illegitimate  son.  Still  a

child, Satoru was less upset with losing his mother

than he was at the disrespect the woman showed her

former love, acting as if the heroic man never existed.

Satoru was sent to the nearest monastery and became

a dedicated student, training almost exclusively with a

crescent-bladed weapon chosen for him by his teacher.

That lajatang came to be known as Staff of the Torrent

Moons. (DC 15)

Satoru later learned that a neighboring noble was

responsible for the ood that killed his fatherthe

nobles  soldiers  had  sabotaged  a  nearby  dam.  With

patience, the youngster honed his martial skills and

bided his time. At twenty-two years of age, the young

warrior purchased a horned mask at a street fair and

began hunting the retainers of his fathers murderer.

He wore the mask to protect his monastery from any

connection with his actions, and its use earned Satoru

the name mizubakemono (river monster) because he

also ambushed his victims from waterways. In fact, the

mizubakemono dragged more than a few unfortunates

underwater, still kicking and screaming. When word

reached Kuemon, the lord of Satorus prefecture, that

a river monster was inicting casualties to his rival

clan, he didnt believe the tales. He

knew a man was responsible.

Kuemon offered a reward to

anyone who could prove that

a man was the mizubakemono,

and Satoru felt the money could

benet his monastery. (DC

20; Inherit the River)

Satoru presented him-

self to Kuemon. The aging

lord told Satoru that ever since

he  started  his  personal  war,  the

neighboring aristocrat would coun-

ter  by  ordering  more  raids

against their territory, slaugh-

tering untold peasants in

retaliation.  Satoru  was

devastated.  His  selsh

desire  for  revenge  was

responsible for the loss of

innocent lives, and he imme-

diately offered to sacrice his

own to end the hostilities. When

word spread that a monk of the

local monastery had turned him-

self in, Satorus mother knew the man was her son. She

went to Satoru and urged him to reconsider, but the

young mans bitterness toward the woman wouldnt

allow him to listen. As she made to leave, she revealed

a secret she had long heldKuemon was the one re-

sponsible for the perpetuation of hostilities between

the rival clans. It was he who secretly ordered villages

burned to rouse the peasantry against the adjacent

region. In fact, he had been ultimately responsible

for the destruction of the dam that had resulted in

the death of Satorus father. Satoru suddenly realized

that his whole life had been guided toward this very

moment.  He  thanked  his  mother,  embraced  her,

and  quickly  went  to  consult  the  wisest  among  his

monastic peers. The story Satoru had been told was

conrmed through their divine insight. (DC 25; Fol-

lowing Through)

The next day, Satoru began the ritual of self-sacrice by

laying his weapons on the ground, knowing Kuemon

would come to watch. The young monk only pretended

to prepare for his coming death. As Kuemon arrived

and took his seat, Satoru rose and challenged the old

man, revealing all he had been told. Kuemons warriors

rushed to defend their lord, but Satoru was merciful

to them, disabling each with nonlethal blows. As his

last guardian went down, Kuemon fell to his knees

and begged for mercy. Satoru gave that kindness on

the price that Kuemon reveal his crimes to all present,

which the aging noble immediately did. Kuemon was

then forced to save what little honor remained to him

by  enacting  the  self-sacrice  ritual  upon  himself.

Satorus stepfather became the new ruler. He ruled

justly,  and  for  the  rst  time  in  thirty  years,  peace

settled on the land. Before long, Satoru formed the

Twin Tides monastery, which valued accountability

and truth above all else. Its members became respected

peacekeepers. When Satoru eventually died of old age,

he left Staff of the Torrent Moons to be inherited by the

most promising student of each generation. (DC 30;

Opposing Corruption)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Staff of the Torrent Moons. A student of the Twin

Tides monastery who is entrusted with this weapon

receives instruction in how to perform the Inherit

the River ritual.

Torrent Moons).

Opposing Corruption: You must investigate and

undermine any governing body that endangers or

takes advantage of innocent people. Each time you

day. Cost: 40,000 gp. Feat Granted: Greater Legacy (Staff

of the Torrent Moons).

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Staff of

the Torrent Moons.

Obscuring Mist (Sp): Starting at 5th level, at will,

you can use obscuring mist as the spell. You can drop

the mist as a standard action. Caster level 5th.

Speed of Fin (Su): At 7th level, you gain a swim

speed equal to your base land speed. This feature also

grants a +8 bonus on Swim checks and allows you

to take 10 on Swim checks even while distracted or

endangered. You can use the run action while swim-

ming, provided you swim in a straight line.

River of Plenty (Su): At 9th level and higher,

three times per day on command, you can use create

water as the spell. Staff of the Torrent Moons must be

touched to a container for this feature to work, the

water  appearing  inside  the  container.  If  you  are

good-aligned, this ability might optionally be used

to create 1 pint of holy water inside the container.

Caster level 5th.

Water Breathing (Su): Starting at 10th level, you

can  breathe  underwater  as  if  constantly  under  the

effect of a water breathing spell. Caster level 10th.

Speak with Aquatic Animals (Su): At 12th level,

you gain the ability to communicate verbally with all

aquatic animals as if constantly under the effect of a

speak with animals spell. Caster level 7th.

Celestial Porpoise Companion (Su): At 13th level

celestial porpoise into any body of water within 30

feet that is large enough to contain the creature. The

commands perfectly. It remains until slain (in which

case it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours) or

dismissed (a swift action). This ability can be used as

often as desired, but only one porpoise companion

can be present at any one time.

Shape of Carp (Sp): Beginning at 14th level, once

per day, you can touch Staff of the Torrent Moons to a

target and utter a command word, transforming that

creature into a Tiny sh (as a baleful polymorph spell).

The save DC is 17, or 15 + your Charisma modier,

whichever is higher. Targets not already immersed in

water gain a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save to resist

this effect. Caster level 11th.

Summon Fish Swarm (Sp): At 15th level and

higher,  ve  times  per  day  on  command,  you  can

summon a swarm of Tiny sh (as the summon swarm

spell) into any body of water large enough to hold the

swarm. This swarm has statistics identical to the rat

swarm (see page 239 of the Monster Manual), except

it has no land speed and no special attacks. It has a

Swim speed of 20 feet and the following skill bonuses

in place of the rat swarms: Hide +10, Listen +3, Spot

+7, Swim +15. Caster level 10th.

Flooding the Fields (Su): Beginning at 16th level,

once per day on command, you can touch Staff of the

Torrent Moons to any body of water and cause it to rise

THE TWIN TIDES MONASTERY

Inukai  Satoru  established  the  monastery  called  Twin

Tides to train pupils in what he called the Way of Water.

Not simply a combat style, it is a way of life that teaches

honor and respect by living its principles. Master Inukais

most famous teaching is, Be the pool below the waterfall.

Let your surface be calm, hiding the depths within. In an

expression of this philosophy, the Twin Tides Monastery

was built by a mountain stream that falls in cascades into

a series of pools. The monastery building itself straddles

the largest of the waterfalls, with an open floor in the

center of the meditation hall through which students can

contemplate the rushing water below. About 30 feet below

this cascade is a deep pond whose surface is remarkably

tranquil (except right below the falls). Within this pond

rests the Staff of the Torrent Moons. The waters depth

and the strong current make simply entering this pool a

challenge  (Swim  DC  15),  even  without  the  ever-vigilant

water sentry.

Daily exercises at the monastery include immersion in

the streams bone-chilling waters, to train the body to resist

physical discomfort, as well as to sluice away impurities

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

of body and mind. Students learn to slow their breathing

almost to a stop and enter a trancelike state in which they

can slow the effects of poison, suffocation, and so forth.

In game terms, these students gain ranks in the Autohyp-

nosis skill (Expanded Psionics Handbook, page 36). In fact,

many students train as psychic warriors or enter the fist of

Zuoken prestige class (Expanded Psionics Handbook, page

144) to further hone their mental powers.

To join the monastery, a candidate must be of lawful

alignment  and  demonstrate  a  commitment  to  honor

and justice. Initiation is grueling, involving a battery of

probing interviews interspersed with exercises involv-

ing difficult ethical challenges (often a choice between

two  unhappy  outcomes).  The  student  is  allowed  no

food  or  sleep  during  that  time.  Only  the  most  disci-

plined spirits pass such a test.

Monks  of  the  Twin  Tides  are  itinerant,  being  much

sought after for their honorable and wise judgment in

overseeing contracts or resolving disputes. The chosen

one who wields Staff of the Torrent Moons is usually an

emissary to imperial courts.

in height by up to 20 feet, as if with the raise water

version of control water. This affects an area of water

up to 100 feet on a side. Caster level 10th.

Cure Critical Wounds (Sp): At 18th level and

higher, three times per day, you can use cure critical

wounds as the spell by touching Staff of the Torrent

Moons to the creature to be healed (including yourself)

and speaking a command word. If both you and the

target stand in water, the spell is maximized. Caster

level 13th.

Horrid Wilting (Sp): Starting at 19th level, once

per day on command, you can subject a single living

creature within 400 feet to horrid wilting as the spell.

The save DC is 22, or 18 + your Charisma modier,

whichever is higher. Caster level 15th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

From among each generation of students trained at the

monastery of Twin Tides, usually only one exemplies

the highest standards of the monasterys teachings.

This student is given a chance to wield Staff of the

Torrent Moons, the lajatang once carried by Inukai

Satoru, the monasterys founding father. Satoru used

the abilities of Staff of the Torrent Moons to overthrow

corruption in the land, and in the right hands, those

abilities can be awakened again. When Master Inukai

felt his life nearing an end, he took his lajatang into

the mountains and asked the river spirits to protect

the weapon. Staff of the Torrent Moons appears only

in a specic pond and only when a worthy student

is present. Reaching for the lajatang evokes a water

sentry, an elemental creature who uses the lajatang

to test the would-be wielder. Defeating the water

sentry  allows  Staff  of  the  Torrent  Moons  to  be  taken

from the pond.

STALKERS BOW

Stalkers Bow is a composite shortbow. Its leather-

wrapped handgrip not only bears signs of extensive use,

but also great care on the part of previous owners.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 composite shortbow;

Cost 2,375 gp. You gain a +1 competence bonus on

Move Silently checks.

Omen:  Stalkers  Bow  makes  no  sound

when you re itboth string and arrow

are totally silent.

HISTORY

The renowned assassin

Failine Namdraki was

the last known own-

er  of  the  shortbow

known  as  Stalk-

ers Bow. Failine,

a  dark-haired

vigilante said to

hail from eastern

lands,  was  well

known  for  taking

only  certain  types

of  work.  She  accept-

ed contracts to avenge

wrongs, to stop reigns of

evil, and to end wars root-

ed in greed. Infamous for

striking within any organization or

government, no matter how secure,

she never left a trace of her presence

besides  the  corpse  of  whomever  she

came to slay. But Failine never returned

home after allegedly taking a contract

to eradicate the Fey King of Kehlrone.

(DC 15)

Failine Namdraki didnt always carry Stalkers Bow.

She acquired it from Jack the Silent, another assassin

of some repute. Jack, a far more typical example of

his profession, was paid by associates of those Failine

had slain in the past to put an end to the womans

do-gooder ways. He arranged the perfect ambush,

or so he thought. When Failine was in his sights,

she somehow sensed his murderous intent seconds

before the killing arrow was loosed. She still took a

grievous wound from the shaft, but managed to move

just enough so the shot failed in its lethality. Seconds

later, Failine turned the tables on Jack, slaying him

in his hunters blind and claiming Stalkers Bow for

herself. (DC 18; Accept the Pain)

Jack the Silent, a reaver from the shadowed lands of

Nok, was known as a man of vacant conscience. But

this was not always so. The shadow lord of Nok gave

Stalkers Bow to Jack, but the gift came at a price. The

terms were that Jack had to undertake a job in which

he was allowed no prior research on his markhe sim-

ply had show up at an indicated place and slay all who

resided therein. Eager for a reward from a shadow lord,

Jack complied. Only after accomplishing the deed did

he realize hed slain a dear friend from his childhood,

someone who had apparently been giving the shadow

lord trouble. From that time onward, all pity died in

Jacks heart, and some say he had

a death wish. Whether this is

true or not, none survived Jack

and his Stalkers Bow in all the

years  of  their  partnership  in

murderthat is, nobody un-

til Failine Namdraki. (DC 25;

Blood From a Friend)

Before giving Stalk-

ers  Bow  to  Jack  the

Silent,  the  nameless

shadow  lord  of  Nok

wielded  the  weapon

himself. The shadow

lords  hidden  name

was  Baalmorthamn,

and he was a creature

from  another  world

come to trouble those

who  knew  not  his

secret  origin  or

true  powers.  As  a

shadow lord of Nok,

just  one  of  a  cabal

of obscure despots

who  ruled  the  sur-

rounding  lands  as

puppet regimes, Baal-

morthamn  enjoyed

and  demanded  supreme  privacy.  Whenever

it seemed his identity might come to light, he used

the full abilities of Stalkers Bow to end the threat.

Baalmorthamn brought the bow with him from his

extraplanar home. Few can stop an ethereal silhou-

ette that slips past all barriers, and thats just what the

shadow lord could do. But in a dimension not his own,

Baalmorthamn rapidly aged, and as his esh became

inrm, he gave the bow to his most trusted servant

Jack the Silent. (DC 31; Trial of the Outsider)

STEADFAST

Steadfast is a sharp, curved sword designed for use by

creatures who can turn their Small size into a tactical

melee  advantage.  Carvings  of  creeping  ivy  adorn

the  blade,  organically  complementing  the  entire

weapon design.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Small +1 scimitar;

Cost 2,315 gp. Since this sword is sized for a Small

wielder, creatures of other sizes take a 2 penalty on

attack rolls with it.

Omen: When you swing Steadfast in battle, it emits

a chirp like a cricket.

HISTORY

Steadfast was made for a haling outrider

named Lunari Suncaster, who patrolled

the woodlands and hills where her clan

had  settled.  Lunari  remained  vigilant

against  goblin  incursions  and  the  pos-

sibility of something worse invading her

clans lands. Fortunately, the job was largely un-

eventful,  allowing  the  haling  horsewoman  to

spend most of her afternoons leisurely shing or

swimming.  On  one  such  occasion,  after  swim-

ming to the middle of a lake, Lunari spotted four

gnolls waiting to ambush her on the other side.

She knew if she turned around and quickly swam

back, she might reach her gear and warpony before

they circled the  lake.  The moment she started,

however, the monsters revealed themselves and

began running. It was close, but Lunari made

it ashore before the gnolls got the advantage.

Without  wasting  a  second,  she  vaulted  into

her  warponys  saddle  and  charged  her  at-

tackers, brandishing the scimitar that came

to be known as Steadfast above her head.

(DC 15)

Lunari,  a  cunning  mounted  war-

rior,  cut  down  two  gnolls  in  as

many passes, but another of

the creatures knocked

the  woman  off  her

mount  on  the  third.

She fell to the ground,

gathered  herself  up  in  one

fluid motion, scimitar still in

hand, and advanced on her assailantstwo crea-

tures easily twice her size. One gnoll took note of

his dead companions and made a run for it. The oth-

er, apparently stronger in body and courage, pressed

his attack, but Lunari made short work of him. She

slashed his legs to keep him from running away,

and then finished him off with one quick stab. To

this day, halflings still argue about how long

it  took  Lunari  to  swim  ashore  compared

to  how  long  it  took  the  gnolls  to  circle

around  the  lake.  The  truth  is,  however,

Lunari  made  it  into  the  saddle  because

she didnt concern herself with dressing

stop to consider her unclad body until the

fight was over. Worrying about modesty at

the time would have meant swift

Lunari didnt begrudge him. (DC

After Lunari enjoyed a long run as a haling outrider

for her clan, she trained her replacement and passed

her scimitar along. The blade has been handed down

for generations, the former owner sharing the secrets

of the weapon with each new protector. This continued

until one outrider was swarmed by a roaming band of

goblins and overwhelmed. The ignoble goblins fought

over the scimitar until their leader Hapnug stepped

in and took it for himself. Hapnug and his band keep

to the outskirts of civilized lands, ambushing riders

on the roads with a rope line that knocks people off

their horses.

HALFLING OUTRIDERS AND STEADFAST

The halfling outrider prestige class (Complete Warrior,

page 38) combines expert riding skill with the nimbleness

inborn  to  halflings.  This  legacy  item  was  originally  the

signature weapon of a famous outrider, and some of its

abilities complement the special features of that class.

At 5th level, a halfling outrider can leap from the saddle

to attack an opponent as though charging, even after

her mount has moved. Using the slow legacy ability in

conjunction with this move allows the outrider to hinder

a larger and tougher enemy, especially if it is followed up

by remounting and making ride-by attacks (if she has the

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Ride-By Attack feat) or the full mounted attack available

at  8th  level.  An  outriders  class  bonus  on  Ride  checks,

along with the natural Dexterity bonus typical of halflings,

makes a fast mount relatively easy to perform.

Although they enjoy phenomenal combat ability while

mounted, halfling outriders are vulnerable on the ground.

Clever  and  strong  opponents  thus  might  make  trip  at-

tempts to unseat an outrider. A high Ride bonus makes

it harder to pull this off, but a halflings penalty for size

works against her. The rooted legacy ability cancels out

the size penalty, though, so the outrider is more likely to

stay in the saddle.

Goblins

Three goblin warriors are hidden in the undergrowth,

ready to spring out and attack a dismounted rider.

Hapnug on Worg

Hapnug,  mounted  on  his  worg,  leads  the  assault

against an ambushed character.

Tactical Notes

Hapnug didnt get to be the gangs leader by being

stupid.  He  is  far  cleverer  than  the  average  goblin,

and  a  master  of  devious  tactics.  The  bandits  were

able to come up with the idea for an ambush, but it

was  Hapnug  who  thought  of  dismounting  a  rider

to  increase  their  advantage  (and  of  camou aging

the rope). Assuming the rider is knocked from the

saddle, the ambush proceeds as follows. If the rider

notices  the  trap  or  manages  to  stay  mounted,  the

goblins fade back into the woods and decline to start

a confrontation.

Round 1: Hapnug throws a javelin at the downed

rider, then urges his mount forward while he draws

Steadfast. The other goblins throw their javelins at the

rider, unless the only clear shot is at the mount. The

worg cant charge through the undergrowth, but its

fast land speed easily allows it to move into melee and

attack. It attacks the downed rider unless the mount

presents a threat, in which case it tries to bring down

that creature.

Round 2 and Beyond: Once Hapnug is engaged,

he maneuvers to get sneak attacks. His underlings

assist by moving into melee and setting up  anking

situations. (If Hapnug goes before the other goblins,

he delays until a  ank has been set up.) If the worg is

attacking the riderless mount, Hapnug dismounts to

continue  ghting the rider. One of the other goblins

might assist the worg with  anking attacks as well

if the opportunity presents itself.

Goblin Ambush

Rope

Two goblins stretch this rope taut across the road

at  roughly  chest  height  for  a  mounted  human  (its

wrapped around tree trunks for extra stability). The

STORMCHASERS CUDGEL

Stormchasers Cudgel is a Large greatclub that appears

to be little more than an oaken branch. The head of

the club is split and cracked with age, but it is no less

durable despite the passage of time. Two large hand-

holds have been worn into the base of the weapon

from repeated use.

Nonlegacy  Game

Statistics: Large +1

greatclub; Cost 2,310

gp;  Damage  2d8;

Weight 16 lb. Storm-

chasers  Cudgel  is  a

Large,  two-handed

weapon. Medium crea-

tures  cannot  use  the

greatclub without some

special ability to wield

such weapons (see the

Monkey Grip feat, page 29).

Stormchasers Cudgel grants you

a  +1  bonus  on  saves  against

spells  with  the  electricity

descriptor.

Omen: When you swing

Stormchasers Cudgel, the

club discharges harmless

electrical sparks.

HISTORY

Stormchasers  Cudgel  is  one  of

the  few  weapons  of  monstrous

origin to pass briey into human

ownership. Taken from a rampaging

ogre killed by a giant-hunter named

Suldan Kabrel, this item was initially

treated as just one of many prizes, its

true  power  remaining  a  secret  for

years. It wasnt until Suldans wife

Ifelma  set  his  precious  trophies  on

re, during one of his numer-

ous  extended  hunts,  that  the

magical nature of Stormchasers

Cudgel was discovered. It sur-

vived the ames virtually unscathed. (DC 15)

Once Suldan was able to examine Stormchasers Cudgel

more closely, his obsession with it became even greater

than his previous xation on hunting had been. Suldan

practiced  for  months  with  the  oversized  weapon,

insisting  the  great  club  could  not  only  guide  him

through the forest but also offered healing abilities.

When Suldan felt he could nally handle the weapon

prociently, he ventured off in search of the ogre tribe

to  which  the  previous  owner  had  belonged.  Suldan

went on to slaughter his way through untold hosts of

ogres in his personal crusade to uncover the history of

Stormchasers Cudgel. (DC 20; The Traceless Path)

Little did Suldan realize that the secrets of Storm-

chasers Cudgel were known only to the ogre mages

that  traveled  between  the  ogre

tribes  as  they  pleased.  To  stop

Suldan and reclaim the legend-

ary greatclub, one of the ogre

mages  took  Ifelma  and  her

children hostage. The ransom

price  was  Stormchasers  Cudgel.

Even  though  his  familys  lives

hung  in  the  balance,  Sul-

dan would not part with

the weapon. Upon hear-

ing  Suldans  choice,

Ifelma  snapped.  She

knew  Suldan  valued

his  expeditions  more

than  his  family,  but  she

hadnt  realized  that  her  hus-

band  was  irredeemably  selsh.

To save herself and her children,

she led a group of ogres and ogre

mages to Suldans secret grot-

to, where they surprised the

huntsman and tore him limb

from limb. (DC 25; Ances-

tral Roots)

The  ogre  mages,  impressed

with the ery and pragmatic human

woman, adopted her and the children

into their culture instead. Ifelma was

heralded as a heroine and her children

were always treated well. Years later, Ifelma gave

birth to a half-ogre boy she named Grugak. The

half-breed grew into a potent war-

rior  and  was  greatly  honored  by

the enigmatic ogre magesthey

gave him Stormchasers Cudgel. They

told Grugak Stormchasers Cudgel was originally taken

from the heart of a petried tree. A bolt of lightning

had struck and split the tree asunder, revealing the

greatclub inside. Stormchasers Cudgel has been passed

down through unrecorded generations of ogres ever

since.  Suldan  Kabrel  awakened  more  abilities  in  the

greatclub than any previous owner in its history, but

163

Ogre mages created Stormchasers Cudgel, which

ultimately destroyed its rapacious owner

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Stormchasers Cudgel.

The Traceless Path: You have to venture deep into

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Storm-

chasers Cudgel.

Dazing Strike (Su): Beginning at 5th level, when-

ever Stormchasers Cudgel delivers a critical hit against

a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice, that

creature must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for

1 round. The save DC is 10, or 10 + your Charisma

modier, whichever is higher. Caster level 5th.

Point the Way (Su): At 6th level and higher, when

Stormchasers Cudgel is thrown into the air, it always

lands on the ground with its top end pointing toward

true magnetic north. Caster level 5th.

Healing Spark (Sp): Starting at 8th level, once per

day as a swift action, you can use cure light wounds on

yourself, as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Crush the Weak (Su): At 10th level and higher, the

critical threat range of Stormchasers Cudgel doubles (to

1920) when the weapon is used against creatures and

objects smaller than you. Unlike similar properties,

this feature stacks with other abilities that expand a

weapons critical threat range, such as the Improved

Critical feat.

164

Resistance to Electricity (Su): At 13th level, you

gain  resistance  to  electricity  10.  At  18th  level,  this

resistance improves to 20.

Call Lightning (Sp): Beginning at 16th level, three

times per day on command, you can use call lightning

as the spell. The save DC is 14, or 13 + your Charisma

modi er, whichever is higher. Caster level 10th.

Absorb Electricity (Su): At 17th level and higher,

any electricity damage you ignore due to your electric-

ity  resistance  is  stored  within  Stormchasers  Cudgel.

The greatclub can hold up to 100 points of electricity

damage in this manner.

At any time within the next minute, as a free action,

you can choose to apply up to 10 points of absorbed

electricity  damage  as  additional  electricity  damage

dealt by Stormchasers Cudgel. You must announce your

intent to use the additional electricity damage before

the  attack  roll  is  madea  miss  wastes  the  charge.

This ability can be used only once per round, and the

electricity damage used is subtracted from the total

held by Stormchasers Cudgel.

Call the Storm (Sp): Starting at 20th level, once

per week on command, you can use control weather

as  the  spell  to  call  a  thunderstorm  (see  page  94  of

the Dungeon Masters Guide). You can use this ability

regardless of climate or season, though the ambient

temperature might affect the type of precipitation the

storm delivers. Caster level 15th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

The heroes discover a beautiful waterfall and pool in a

peaceful grotto. A subsequent search of the area reveals

that a depression in the ground is actually deeper than

it  rst seemed. Once a few boulders are shifted aside,

the depression opens into a damp cavern, which is

shored  up  to  prevent  collapse.  The   oor  is   ooded

with water from the natural pool above, and the cave

shows evidence of having been used as a campsite by

a humanoid of some sort. That humanoid was Suldan

Kabrel. Ogre mages bound his spirit here as a guardian

for Stormchasers Cudgel, and this hidden grotto is the

clubs storage space when the item isnt in use. Moving

the greatclub sends a silent call to the wraith, which

attacks anyone in the area until it is destroyed.

Suldan Kabrel, Wraith: hp 32 (see page 257 of the

Monster Manual).

Secret Hideout

This mossy cavern is underneath a pond and has been

reinforced with stout beams. Almost half of the cavern

 oor is covered with water.

Entranceway

This entrance is covered with loosely piled boulders;

readily shifted to reveal the opening beneath.

Pool

This area of the cavern has  lled with water dripping

from the aboveground pond. The pool is shallow and

doesnt slow travel through it.

Suldan Kabrel

The wraith of the former giant-slayer lingers in the

cavern  but  attacks  only  when  someone  touches

Stormchasers Cudgel.

Desk

This rickety old desk has rotted writing materials spread

across its surface, containing some notes from Suldan

Kabrels history and pursuit of the greatclubs secrets.

Reading these notes grants a +2 bonus on the Knowl-

edge (history) check required to learn the Traceless Path

ritual. A hooded lantern also rests on the desk.

Skeletal Remains

These  are  the  bones  of  Suldan  Kabrel,  lying  on  a

moldering cot and still clutching the greatclub that

brought his doom.

THANIFEX

Thanifex (sometimes called the Spear of the Erst-

while) is a long, broad-bladed spear constructed from

a sheer, black metal that dees detailed examination.

It has been surmised the greatspear is fashioned

from pure void.

Increment 10 ft.; Weight

The greatspear is a

weapon  that  can

be  proficiently

wielded  by  any

time you conrm

a critical hit with

Thanifex, you heal

up  to  a  maximum

Omen: Whenever

you  successfully

strike an opponent

with  Thanifex,  the

light around you and your foe

seems to dim momentarily.

Thanifex became instrumental in making Javens dark

pledge possible. (DC 15)

As the years churned by, more slaves were always

brought to the city. Javen rose through the ranks of

slavery, nally becoming a master stonecutter. While

he enjoyed the benets of his skilled position,

Javen  took  no  plea-

sure in commanding

others to work, but to

his  way  of  thinking,

the slaves who suffered

under his care need

not  do  so  point-

lessly.  On  one

occasion, Javen

disguised  him-

self as a guard and

redirected a brigade

of fresh conscripts

to an underground

cavern before they

were  counted  in

the  monthly  slave

census. While Javen

worked aboveground

as a master stonecutter,

the redirected slaves were

put  to  work  building  a

secret  altar  beneath  the

city.  He  kept  these  work-

ers underground at all times,

motivating  them  with  clean

food and water diverted from the

other  slaves.  (DC  20;  Ascend

by Trade)

HISTORY

The horric greatspear Thanifex creates armies

of undead slaves in service to a dark god

Javen Blunt knew only cruelty during his whole life,

and he was determined to give back to the world in

kind. Taken from a conquered land as a child, Javen

grew up as one of many thousands of disposable slaves

used to construct a capital city. These slaves werent

actually fed so much as forced to ght over the rancid

food  thrown  to  them.  This  made  life  among  the

slaves  anarchic  and  murderous,  and  many  became

insane  or  were  driven  to  suicide  by  the  inhumane

conditions. Javen never broke or complained, though,

preferring to remain unseen as he prayed to his dark

god for a way to take vengeance against his keepers.

His sole focus was to stay alive long enough to make

his captors, and every free person who came to live in

that city, know the daily hopelessness felt by a slave.

He swore an oath to do so if ever given the chance.

When the altar was nished, Javen offered his se-

cret  builders  a  congratulatory  meal.  Once  the  poor

wretches realized their food was poisoned, it was too

late. They were left paralyzed long enough for Javen

to sacrice each one to his god of death, ensuring the

secrecy of his altar. Javen reasoned the people he slew

would have died as slaves anyway. At least this way, he

rationalized,  their  pitiful  lives  could  serve  a  greater

purpose. The sacrices didnt end there, however. If

Javen was going to stay focused, he needed to feed his

gluttonous god far more souls before being given the

might to overcome his enemies. Masquerading as one

of the guards had proven successful in the past, and so

Javen continued his deception at night, preying on un-

suspecting slaves by using the appearance of authority

to lead them underground to his altar. Javen sacriced

hundreds of slaves during this time, becoming a priest

of the highest order. (DC 25; Mask of Deceit)

Thirty years passed. The most beautiful metropolis

the world had ever seen was completed on the backs of

miserable slaves. From among those who remained, the

municipal rulers ordered the healthy slaves freed and

the damaged ones put to death. Imperfection had no

place in the pristine city. Now a free man, Javen quickly

achieved a position of afuencepoliticians and states-

men employed his services as an artisan to construct

their opulent homes. The appearance that any of these

comforts satised Javen only conrmed the mans skill

at deception. Shortly after the city was nished, Javen

sacriced one nal victim, transforming the spear he

had wielded in his guards disguise into a foul conduit of

negative energy. The tainted weapon denied an afterlife

to any creature it slew, turning humanoids into pitiless

undead. Javen started by murdering the community

leaders, raising their bodies as ghasts, which preyed

on their personal guards. Once many of the elite war-

riors were transformed into ghasts, they attacked the

city guards, and eventually turned on the militia and

garrison soldiers. The unclean army then infected and

fed on the inhabitants of the beautiful city, until all

were dead or bound to their corrupted bodies, forever

enslaved by undeath. Javens oath thusly bore its bitter

fruit. (DC 30; What Comes Around)

living creature, you can draw off some of that creatures

essence, eliminating your need for food and water for

24 hours. A creature killed thusly can be returned from

the dead only by a resurrection spell or more powerful

magic. Alternatively, you can use a standard action to

voluntarily take 1d6 points of damage from Thanifex

to gain the same benet.

Caster level 17th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 8)

Once Javen had used Thanifex to exact his terrible ven-

geance upon the entire city, his sole reason for living

was  gone.  He  sealed  himself  in  his  underground

temple and fell upon Thanifex atop his blasphemous

altar. In truth, the vengeful ex-slave felt he deserved no

afterlife, even as a powerful minion of immeasurable

evil, and so denied his soul any privileged existence

that might have awaited him. Javens body and spirit

were bound together, spawning an awful creature with

an insatiable lust for death. Thanifex still lies upon

the shrines black altar.

Sacrificial Altar

The sealed temple is a beautifully crafted, architectur-

ally solid stone chamber. In the center is a prominent

altar, raised up on stepped platforms. The corners of

this room are each supported with archways that are

built into a high hemispherical ceiling.

Skeleton Statues

Statues of skeletons line the walls, each one more

grotesque than the last.

The undead horror that was once Javen Blunt now

lurks within the sealed temple. It stands unmoving

against a wall, looking like one of the statues that line

the chamber. A Spot check opposed by the mohrgs

Hide check reveals its true nature. The creature attacks

with surprise at the most opportune moment.

Statues

The ends of this altar are adorned with statues in the

likenesses of imps. These statues are a little larger than

life size, about the size of Small creatures.

Altar

The legacy greatspear Thanifex rests on this altar.

TREEBROTHER

Treebrother  is  a  deceptively  simple,  knotted  staff  of

stout  oak.  Unpolished  and  rough,  the  wood  looks

freshly cut from the bough of an ancient tree. The

staff is thick and sturdy, ideally suited for use either

as a walking stick or a quarterstaff.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: Treebrother; Cost 1,100

gp; Charges 50. On command, Treebrother can summon

a cloud of bright motes resembling reies, creating

illumination equivalent to a light spell. Caster level

5th. When you cast barkskin, your caster level is treated

as one level higher than normal.

Omen: Natures power surges through Treebrother,

causing plants within 5 feet to open their owers and

bend toward the staff as if it were the sun.

HISTORY

Long ago, in the deepest part of an ancient forest where

no woodcutters steps had ever passed, there lived a

treant called Tarnla, who shepherded the primeval

trees. One of Tarnlas trees was home to a dryad, a fair

and lovely creature named Nidria, and the two children

of the forest fell deeply in love with each other. Together

with the human druid Anda, they kept the sacred heart

of the forest safe and unspoiled by the depredations

of loggers and careless folk. Legends say that Andas

staff Treebrother was crafted from a sapling resulting

from Tarnla and Nidrias union. (DC 15)

At the twilight of his life, Anda was a great hero,

revered  and  respected  for  many  leagues  beyond  the

forest where he dwelt with his friends, the treant Tarnla

and  the  dryad  Nidria.  Younger  druids  from  across

the  world  traveled  to  his  forest  to  learn  from  him,

and kings and empresses alike consulted him for his

wisdom of the natural world. Despite his fame, Anda

had enemies among many peoples, savage and civilized.

A combination of raw hatred, terrible greed, and petty

jealousy brought down the great druid and destroyed

much  of  his  forest  home.  The  orc  chieftain  Bruug,

who had clashed with Anda in his youth, learned his

old  enemy  still  lived  and  sought  to  avenge  himself

upon the druid. Marshaling his forces, Bruug struck

suddenly  and  ercely  into  the  northern  marches  of

Andas forest, burning and destroying. Anda, along with

Tarnla and Nidria, raced to contain the orcs, but even

their combined might couldnt hold the wicked host at

bay. Animal messengers were sent out to the sovereigns

whose lands abutted the forest, but jealous and hateful

advisors, who saw the woods as a great resource to be

exploited if the meddlesome druid were eliminated,

convinced many monarchs to withhold their troops.

As Anda, Tarnla, and Nidria fell back toward the sacred

heart  of  the  forest,  they  pooled  their  magic  for  one

last, desperate spell to drive the invaders back. Using

Nidrias sacred oak as the spells focus, they conjured

forth a vast wave of vines and greenery, swallowing the

orc multitude. Their victory came at great costthe

spells energy destroyed Nidrias tree, and the effort of

casting it claimed the lives of Anda and Tarnla alike.

The dryad survived only thanks to Treebrother, whose

magic held enough residues from her oak to sustain

her. Grief-stricken, the dryad buried Anda and Tarnla

together  beneath  a  sacred  mound,  atop  which  she

planted Treebrother as a memorial to her fallen comrades.

According to legend, the staff and Nidria abide there

even now. (DC 18; Sacred Mound)

Anda carried Treebrother with him since the days of

his youth. Allegedly, the staff was a gift from Tarnla.

When  Anda  was  in  his  middle  years,  a  caravan  of

dwarves out of the mountainous west came to the eaves

of the forest. The dwarven geomancers had divined

the presence of great veins of precious ore beneath

the forest oor, and their miners entered the wood

with picks, axes, and spells to tear away the soil. Anda,

upon learning of this horror, gathered his staff and set

out to beseech the dwarves to cease their mining, or

at least to dig more carefully, so as not to disturb the

balance of the woodland. The dwarves scoffed at the

druid, refusing his offer of peace and harmony, even

threatening his life should he return. Anda tried to

approach the clan elders once more some days later,

but he was violently repulsed. With no other choice,

the druid went to Tarnla and Nidria to prepare for war

against the dwarves. Tarnla called the lesser treants to

his banner, Nidria gathered the fey creatures of the

forest, and Anda summoned animals from their dens

and warrens. In a swift and brutal battle, the dwarves

were  driven  off.  Many  died.  Grieving  over  the  loss

of life, Anda crafted a great standing stone at the site

of the clash, a monument of sorrow and tragedy that

stands to this day. (DC 25; Stone of Sorrow)

LEGACY RITUALS

Two rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Treebrother.

Sacred Mound: You must journey to the sacred

mound  where  Anda  and  Tarnla  are  buried,  and

there conducting a day-long ritual of fasting, medi-

tation, and prayer. Cost: 2,400 gp. Feat Granted: Least

Legacy (Treebrother).

Stone of Sorrow: You have to construct and consecrate

(with the spell) a standing stone to the memory of some

personal failing that caused harm or suffering to others,

as Anda did when his failure to convince the dwarves to

mine more responsibly led to the deaths of many. You

need not cast the consecrate spell yourself, and the cost

of hiring someone to cast the spell is considered part of

the cost of the ritual. Crafting the monument requires

a DC 25 Craft (stonemasonry) check, though you can

hire a specialist to do the work (the cost of which is also

included in the ritual cost). Consecrating the monument

requires a 24-hour ritual of prayer and meditation. Cost:

11,500 gp. Feat Granted: Lesser Legacy (Treebrother).

WIELDER REQUIREMENTS

Druids are the most common wielders of Treebrother,

though clerics with the Plant domain can also qualify.

Rangers can gain access to the staffs least abilities,

but they are typically incapable of paying the personal

costs  required  for  the  more  powerful  abilities  and

rarely complete the Stone of Sorrow ritual.

Treebrother Wielder Requirements

Ability to cast barkskin as a divine spell

Knowledge (nature) 6 ranks

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Treebrother.

Shillelagh (Sp): At 5th level and higher, once per

day as a move action, you can turn Treebrother into a

magic quarterstaff as though with the shillelagh spell.

Caster level 5th.

Green Empathy (Su): Beginning at 6th level, you

can attempt to improve the attitude of a plant by roll-

ing 1d20 and adding your character level plus your

Charisma modier. This feature is otherwise similar

to the wild empathy class feature (see page 35 of the

Players Handbook).

Create  Food  and  Water  (Sp):  At  7th  level  and

higher, once per day on command, you can use create

food and water as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Entangle (Sp): Starting at 8th level, three times

per day by touching Treebrother to the ground, you can

use entangle as the spell. The spells area is centered

on the spot you touch, and you are unaffected by the

spells effects. The save DC is 11, or 11 + your Charisma

modier, whichever is higher. Caster level 5th.

Woodland  Stealth  (Su):  At  10th  level,  you

gain  a  +5  competence  bonus  on  Hide  and  Move

Silently checks made in any area of undergrowth.

170

If adjacent to or in the same square as a tree, you

can use the Hide skill even if you dont have cover

or concealment.

Fast Movement (Su): At 11th level, you gain a 10-

foot enhancement bonus to your base land speed.

Solar Nourishment (Su): Beginning at 12th level,

you gain all the nourishment you need, a full days

worth of food and water, from 2 hours of exposure

to sunlight. Only natural sunlight has this effect.

Commune With Nature (Sp): Treebrother grants

you increased insight into the wonders of the natural

world. At 13th level and higher, once per week on

command, you can use commune with nature as the

spell. Caster level 10th.

Changestaff (Sp): Starting at 16th level, once per

day you can transform Treebrother as though with the

changestaff spell. The duration of the effect is only 1

hour. If the resulting treantlike creature is reduced

to 0 hit points, Treebrother re-forms into its normal

shape, and none of its legacy abilities can be activated

for 1 hour. Caster level 10th.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 6)

In the deepest heart of a primeval forest, the heroes

come across a wide clearing where sunlight dapples

the ground through the canopy, and a fresh smell of

new growth permeates the air. At the center of the

clearing is a single, grass-covered mound with a staff

planted at its apex. The dryad Nidria, the mother of

Treebrother, lives here, but her home has just been

invaded by a hunting wyvern. The PCs can hear the

battle raging when they come within 60 feet with a

DC 15 Listen check.

If  the  PCs  aid  Nidria  in  defeating  the  wyvern,

she is extremely grateful. She then asks a PC who

seems most in touch with the natural world to prove

herself a humble, worthy servant of nature by nd-

ing Nidria a new oak to call home. The magic of the

staff  is  all  that  keeps  the  dryad  alive,  and  despite

her grief, she has no desire to allow an unworthy

bearer to take the staff. If a PC can nd her a suit-

able tree within 24 hours, which requires a DC 20

Knowledge (nature) or Survival check, made once

every 4 hours, and return to Nidria, she gives that

character Treebrother in gratitude and fades into the

forest. Villainous characters might simply take the

staff by force, but this vile act incurs the wrath of

every nonevil creature in the forest.

embrace  a  chaotic,  unrestrained  lifestyle.  They  are

more unpredictable than the Wardens, making for

unearthly and hazardous encounters.

The Gatekeepers, on the other hand, are concerned

entirely with defending the land against incursions by

the dark forces of Khyber, and they specialize in  ght-

ing aberrations,  ends, and the like. Most Gatekeepers

are orcs, although some half-orcs and humans number

among them, and their tradition goes back to ancient

times. If Treebrother is in that sects possession, you must

revise  the  weapons  history  somewhatGatekeeper

orcs are not ravening brutes, and an orc attack against

the weapons bearer doesnt make much sense in that

context. Instead, Anda, Tarnla, and Nidria fought to

halt a  endish invasion and reseal the portal that had

held the horrors back. The Gatekeepers are likely to be

guarding Treebrothers grove closely, and they will have

many pointed questions for those who wish to enter.

(The guardian trees might instead prevent the passage

of aberrations or  ends rather than orcs.)

Other druid sects inhabit the Reaches, though, and

not all are kindly protectors of the trees. The Ashbound

are  fanatics  who   ght  against  the  encroachment  of

civilization in all its forms, although they prefer active

discouragement to killing. After  ghting against the

brutality of those who had attempted to ravage the forest,

the keepers of Treebrother might have joined the Ash-

bound sect. Nidria herself might now be hardened and

hostile to characters attempting to breach her grove.

TREEBROTHER IN FAERN

Faern has many forests, but the oldest and wildest

are found in the Unapproachable East, especially the

ancient  Ashenwood  of  Rashemen.  It  is  completely

unspoiled, and in fact its paths are untrodden by any

humanoidnot even elves. The forest is home to wild

fey, elder treants, and spirit creatures. Occasionally a

Rashemi human enters on a sacred quest or to seek the

wisdom of the spirits, but by ancient compact none

remain long within its borders (and none enter with-

out proper offerings and observances). In this setting,

even the druid Anda would have been forbidden to

remain within the Ashenwoods borders; instead, he

watched the approaches to the forest (in the Rashemi

tradition, he would most likely have been a woman,

perhaps even a hathran). The approach to Treebrothers

grove requires the offering of gifts and prayers to the

spirits simply to enter the forest, and someone seeking

the staff might also require dealing with some of its

mighty protectors, such as Bristlebeard the awakened

dire boar or the ancient treant Stormwind.

Treebrothers Grove

Weeping Mound

This low, grassy hill is too smooth and uniform to be a

natural occurrence. Anyone stepping onto the mound

feels a palpable sense of sadness and grief, as though

he were standing at the grave of a dear friend.

Guardian Trees

The trees surrounding this clearing are woven tightly

together, as if attempting to keep something out.

Moving through the squares between these trees

counts as moving through dif cult terrain, unless the

character has the woodland stride ability. If an orc or

half-orc tries to enter the clearing, the trees close in

even tighter, forcing the character to make a DC 15

Escape Artist check to wriggle through.

TREEBROTHER IN EBERRON

The wild lands of the Eldeen Reaches contain some of

the most ancient forests in all of Khorvaire, and in its

depths many sects of druids stand guard. Some, such

as the Wardens of the Wood, are generally friendly to

travelers who respect natural places. In this setting,

Anda is a natural Warden, and his clashes with outside

groups such as warlike orcs and greedy dwarves need

no adaptation. Another druid sect of Eberron is the

Greensingers, who are closely allied with the fey and

UR

A  casual  observer  might  easily  mistake  Ur  for  a

simple chunk of int broken off of a larger rock eons

ago by natural forces. A closer inspection, however,

reveals one edge of the rock has been carefully napped

down to a razor edge, while the opposite side has

been shaped into a crude handgrip. Small, primitive

gures of deer, wolves, and bears are etched into

the stone.

Nonlegacy  Game  Statistics:  +1  handaxe;

Cost 2,306 gp. Although Ur is made of

stone, its magic makes it as effective as

a steel weapon. Simply holding Ur

gives you a deeper connection

to your savage, primitive

ancestors,  granting  a  +1

circumstance bonus on

Intimidate checks.

Omen:  The  carvings

sometimes  appear  to

have changed places of

their own accord, though

they never move while be-

ing observed. The carvings

sometimes offers glimpses of

Urs past, showing you scenes

of battle from various points in

many millennia.

HISTORY

Eons ago, before the human race developed even the

most basic metallurgical skills, primitive bands of

hunter-gatherers crafted weapons from the stones

of  the  earth,  the  bones  of  their  prey,  and  other

simple materials. For hunting, these tribes favored

simple  bows,  spears,  and  slings,  but  for  warfare,

many preferred a crude axe made from a wedge of

int or obsidian. Although brittle in comparison

to the iron and steel weapons used by modern war-

riors, these stone axes held an edge sharp enough

to shave with and could inict devastating wounds.

Many warriors ascribed totemic attributes to their

weapons,  hoping  to  draw  upon  the  strengths  of

animal spirits by carving their likenesses into the

stone. (DC 15)

Although  it  is  nearly  impossible  to  garner  the

history of a specific weapon crafted tens of thou-

sands of years before the invention of the written

word, it is clear from its multitude of animal glyphs

that Ur was the weapon of a great warrior, perhaps

even a chieftain. He must have undergone many

spiritual ordeals in order to gain the favor of his

tribes  shaman,  whose  powers  would  have  been

necessary to bind animal spirits into the axe. The

oldest carvings on the weapon appear to be those

of deer or antelope, so Urs first owner was prob-

ably a scout of some sort, fleet of foot and keen of

eye.  The  puzzle  is  how  such  an  individual  could

become  a  renowned  warrior  with

enough wealth and prestige to have

his axe bound with such potent

shamanic magic. (DC 18; Swift

Hooves of the Deer)

After  the  deer  carv-

ings,  the  next  oldest

appear  to  be  of  a  pack

of wolves. This change

from  prey  animal  to

predator might mark the

wielders transition from

lookout or scout to hunter

or raider, with the attendant

ferocity attached to such a change.

To  these  ancient  people,  the  wolf

was a symbol of stealth, cunning, and

keen senses, with a profound connection

to  the  supernatural  and  mystical.  In

many  early  cave  paintings,  for  example,

the sun and moon are depicted as a pair

of wolves circling each other, testing for

dominance. Wolf pelts and skulls found

in  many  prehistoric  gravesites  hint  that  wolves

were considered guides to or messengers from the

afterlife. Above all, though, these primitive people

saw in the wolf packs both a terrible enemy and

a structure to be emulatedwolves are, in many

ways, the perfect hunters. Thus, many hunters and

shamans took the wolf as their totem. (DC 25; Rite

of the Wolfs Howl)

The  most  recent  (if  anything  on  a  such  an  old

axe can be called recent) figures adorning Ur are

those  of  great  bears,  twice  the  size  of  either  the

deer  or  the  wolves.  The  bear  was  the  symbol  of

the  warriorspecifically,  the  warrior  as  protec-

tor of the tribe, just as bears fight most fiercely to

protect their cubs. Also an icon of great wisdom

and  leadership,  the  bear  hints  that  Urs  original

owner rose from humble beginnings as a scout to

a dominant war-leader in a relatively short period.

It  is  unknown  whether  Urs  attendant  animal

spirits were a factor in this ancient warriors rise

to supremacy, or if the axe gained its true power

only when the warrior was influential enough to

command the tribes shaman to ensorcel the stone.

What cannot be disputed is that the magic bound

into Ur gave the weapon a primitive, animal intel-

ligence that has lasted to this day. (DC 31; Strength

of the Bear)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Ur.

Swift Hooves of the Deer: You must locate, stalk,

and kill a deer or similar animal. You have to hunt

alone,  wearing  no  armor  except  for  hide.  The  deer

must be brought down using a wood, bone, or stone

version of any of the following weapons: club, dagger,

handaxe, javelin, shortbow, sling, or spear. Once the

deer is slain, you must dress the carcass and make a

ritual offering to the deer spirits. Cost: 1,600 gp. Feat

Granted: Least Legacy (Ur).

Rite  of  the  Wolfs  Howl:  You  have  to  perform

another sacred hunt, killing a dire wolf, a winter wolf, or

a worg. All of the restrictions listed in Swift Hooves of

LEGACY ITEM ABILITIES

All the following are legacy item abilities of Ur.

Deer Spirit: At 5th level, Urs deer spirit awakens

and  the  handaxe  becomes  an  intelligent  item.  Ur

then has an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 13, and a

Charisma of 13. Its alignment is neutral and it com-

municates via empathy. Being somewhat twitchy and

fearful, the deers empathic communications fall into

two categoriescontentment or fear. The handaxe

can see and hear to a range of 60 feet. Its Ego score is

4 + its enhancement bonus.

Fast Movement (Su): At 6th level, your base land

speed increases by 5 feet. Treat this as an enhance-

ment bonus. At 11th level, this bonus improves to

10 feet.

Keen Sight (Su): You gain a +5 competence bonus

on Spot checks at 9th level.

Swift Stride (Su): Starting at 10th level, three times

per day as a swift action, you can grant yourself a 30-

foot  enhancement  bonus  on  your  base  land  speed.

The increase lasts 1 round. Caster level 5th.

174

Wolf  Spirit:  At  11th  level,  the  wolf  spirit  within

Ur awakens, completely replacing the deer spirit. Urs

Wisdom and Charisma increase to 16, and the handaxe

gains darkvision out to 60 feet. The wolf spirit is aggres-

sive and cunning, using the Common tongue to suggest

tactics. Its Ego score is 10 + its enhancement bonus.

Stealthy Approach (Su): At 13th level, you gain a

+10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.

Wolfs  Cunning  (Su):  You  are  able  to  react  to

danger with surprising speed. At 16th level, you gain

a +5 bonus on initiative checks.

Bear Spirit: At 17th level, the bear spirit within

Ur awakens, overshadowing the wolf spirit. The bear

spirit is calm and thoughtful unless confronted with

aggression,  in  which  case  it  responds  swiftly  and

brutally. Urs Wisdom and Charisma increase to 18,

and it gains the ability to communicate with you

telepathically.  The  handaxe  gains  blindsense,  and

all its senses work out to 120 feet. The handaxes Ego

score is 17 + its enhancement bonus.

Implacable Will (Su): At 17th level, you gain a +5

morale bonus on Will saves.

Healing Totem (Sp): Starting at 19th level, two

times per day as a swift action, you can use cure critical

wounds (self only) as the spell. Caster level 15th.

Natural Lore (Su): At 19th level, you gain a +5 com-

petence bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival

checks.

Savage Transformation (Su): Beginning at 20th

level, once per day as a free action, you can enter a

state of savagery lasting for 10 rounds. In this state,

you are immune to poison, death effects, and fear

effects. Any damage that would reduce you to 1 or

fewer hit points is ignored. You cannot benet from

any effect or ability, magical or otherwise, allowing

you to regain or heal hit pointssuch effects simply

fail for the duration of the transformation.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

While traveling through the wilderness, the heroes

stumble across a cavern gaping in a rocky cliff face.

The cave seems to radiate an aura of ancient, primeval

power. As the characters approach the opening, a deer

bounds out and leaps away into the forest. Within

await  a  brown  bear  and  a  pair  of  wolves,  snarling

when they see someone approaching. Any character

with Knowledge (nature) instantly recognizes this is

unnatural behaviorthese three creatures are likely

held  here  by  some  outside  force.  That  force  is  Ur,

which rests atop a crude stone dais like a primitive

holy relic on a shrine.

Brown Bear: hp 51 (see page 269 of the Monster

Manual).

Wolves (2): hp 13, 15 (see page 283 of the Monster

Manual).

ALTERNATIVE HISTORIES OF UR

The legacy weapon presented here is intimately connected

with primitive human culture, but there is no reason you

cant  customize  it  to  preliterate  peoples  of  some  other

race,  such  as  lizardfolk  or  orcs.  To  do  so,  simply  alter

some  of  the  items  superficial  details  to  bring  it  more

into  line  with  the  alternative  culture.  For  example,  the

specific animals carved into the blade might differ from

the deer, wolf, and bear described above. The legacy abili-

ties granted remain the same, but would have different

names. Thus, a weapon of lizardfolk might have images

of  lizard,  snake,  and  tortoise,  respectively;  one  crafted

for  a  locathah  warrior  could  have  seahorse,  shark,  and

whale. The spirits can also be tied to a specific environ-

ment, such as a desert; the various environment books

(for example, Sandstorm or Frostburn) provide plenty of

additional  information  and  ideas  for  customizing  the

weapons abilities to a given setting.

Another approach is to have Ur be not the weapon of

a long-forgotten ancestor but a legacy that was founded

recently by an uncivilized people. Thus, Ur does not lie

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

forgotten  in  an  ancient  cave  but  grants  its  abilities  to

a nonplayer character that the party must deal with in

some way. A great warrior has arisen among the savage

orcs of the mountains, for example, or perhaps a goliath

chieftain has imbued it with wondrous powers by win-

ning  many  competitions  of  speed,  strength,  and  cour-

age. In the former case, the orc is probably a threat to

be defeated; in the latter, perhaps a potential ally whom

the PCs must persuade to wield her weapon in a greater

cause.  (Although  goliaths  are  not  primitive,  theirs  is

a  preliterate  culture  that  reveres  the  primal  forces  of

nature. See the Races of Stone supplement for details on

the goliath race.)

Discovering  the  symbolism  of  Ur  can  also  be  more

than simply undertaking a ritual hunt. The legacy rituals

described above can become more involved, requiring

the wielder to learn about the culture that made it. For

example, the wielder might have to travel to an encamp-

ment of primitive peoples to learn the nature of the spirit

offering that is needed, or consult with a scholar of lost

tribes and their ways.

WARGIRDS ARMOR

Wargirds Armor is a breastplate designed for a military

ofcer. Its entire surface is etched with beautifully

symmetric patterns and runes.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 breastplate; Cost

1,350 gp. You can sleep while wearing Wargirds Armor

without being fatigued the next day. You also gain a +2

bonus on Constitution checks made to avoid taking

nonlethal damage from a forced march.

Omen:  Minor  damage  (not  including  hit  point

damage) sustained by Wargirds Armor as a result of a

battle automatically repairs itself, ensuring the armor

always looks unblemished.

HISTORY

Feralion Ordel made the breastplate that became War-

girds Armor. The armor was never meant as anything

more than a functional breastplate for the type of eld

lieutenant who issued commands from

horseback, well away from the ghting.

Feralion  was  a  military  smith

accustomed to churning out

arms  and  armor,  making

new  when  he  had  to,  re-

pairing what he could,

and replacing what he

couldnt.  He  had  no

time  to  take  pride  in

his work. During a long

campaign,  Feralion  was

ordered to forge a new breast-

plate. The smith went to work as he

had  many  times  before,  but  never

had  the  nal  product  turned  out

so completely devoid of aws. Fe-

ralion couldnt stop marveling at

his own craftsmanship, growing un-

able to part with the breastplate. He hid

it instead. (DC 15)

The breastplate had been ordered for

a  newly  commissioned  lieutenant,  a

replacement  for  another  ofcer  fallen

to a single arrow. The damage to the dead lieutenants

breastplate was minimal, but the replacement lieu-

tenant was of noble blood, and he expected a fresh

outt. Feralion hid the awless armor, working hard to

repair the dead lieutenants breastplate, adjusting the

t to the replacement ofcer. When the self-satised

lieutenant unceremoniously donned the seemingly

new breastplate, Feralion felt justied in his decep-

tion. If the whelp couldnt tell the difference between

new armor and old, he deserved the hand-me-down.

Feralion then toiled endlessly on his prized breastplate,

lovingly  adorning  it  with  symmetric  patterns  and

runes. (DC 20; Spark of the Anvil)

One  day,  the  regiment  Feralion  served  came  up

against barbarians of the frozen highlands. The enemy

showed  up  in  unexpected  force,  dwarng  the  regi-

ments numbers. Outraged at the civilized kingdoms for

invading their ancestral lands, the berserkers brutally

plowed through the regiments defenses, forcing the

ofcers to retreat almost immediately. Feralion had to

defend  himself,  but  having  anticipated  as  much,  he

had already donned Wargirds Armor. With an ordinary

sledgehammer  in  hand,  Feralion  stood  against  the

ravening horde quite prepared to die. But the longer

he  continued  ghting,  the  more  the  smith  realized

he could not be struckhis armor simply wouldnt

allow it. Feralion broke through the berserker lines,

giving the ofcers enough time to rally their remaining

soldiers and drive the enemy back. Although the bar-

barians held their ground against

the counterattack, Feralion had

turned sure defeat into a stale-

mate. He was promoted to

lieutenant  on  the  eld.

What  Feralion  didnt

realize  was  the  spirit

of  a  berserker  youth  he

killed that day had bonded

with the breastplate. (DC 25;

Misplaced Youth)

Feralion  and  Wargirds  Armor

became legendary. He was a leader

who fought at the front of the ranks,

leading  charges  in  many  successful

battles.  His  iconic  status,  however,

made him a target. Assassins and merce-

naries alike were hired by the enemy to

target Feralion in the eld. The few times

an attack did strike Feralions armor, he

ew  into  such  a  violent  fury  that  his

opponent was usually dispatched shortly

thereafter. Attempts were even made to steal Wargirds

Armor,  but  something  always  kept  Feralion  alert,

foiling all such plots. Only the stalemate when rst

he had donned his awless breastplate haunted the

smith-turned-soldier. Feralion then sought permission

to lead several regiments against the barbarians of the

northern highlands, and he was given leave to attack

as he saw t. The battle should have gone wellthe

enemy was outnumberedbut the barbarians used

Wargirds Armor will not allow

its wearer to be defeated

marched through the frigid passes, barbarian drums

echoed  through  the  region  and  shook  thundering

walls of snow down upon the attackers. Avalanches

completely buried everyone, preserving their bodies

in crypts of shattered ice and frozen powder. Wargirds

Armor has presumably been buried there ever since.

(DC 30; The Journey Home)

LEGACY RITUALS

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of Wargirds Armor.

ADVENTURE SEED (EL 5)

While  trekking  through  a  frigid  highland  pass,  a

randomly determined character trips over a strangely

glistening  stone  unless  he  makes  a  DC  25  Spot

check. Closer examination reveals the stone is actu-

ally a helmet frozen in the snow. If the characters

dig the helmet out, they discover many ice-covered

bodies, their garb revealing them as soldiers from

the same army. A little farther along the path, the

heroes discover more equipment strewn about a hole

and more bodies under the snow. Any character with

the Track feat can make a Survival check to see the

signs of a body being removed from the hole and

dragged away by a Large quadruped (the base DC

for tracking is 14, modied by the actual conditions

at the site, as determined by the DM). The tracks

lead to a winter wolfs underground burrow. Gnarl,

the  winter  wolf,  has  been  dragging  bodies  to  her

den to eat, and she has the equipment worn by the

unfortunates collected in a recess of the burrow. The

trove includes Wargirds Armor.

Gnarl, Winter Wolf: hp 51 (see page 256 of the

Monster Manual).

Winter Wolf Burrow

This map depicts the underground burrow of a winter

wolf. This burrow obviously exists in an arctic climate

and should reect as much near the entranceway,

icy slope, and frozen antlers. The chamber contain-

ing the bodies sketched on the map also contains

Wargirds Armor.

Entranceway

This entrance to the den is obvious, not covered by

snow and well trodden by the winter wolfs paws.

Icy Slope

The  den  descends  rapidly  into  the  frozen  earth,

and  there  are  steep  areas  of  ice-covered,  smooth

soil that are difficult to negotiate. A DC 15 Balance

check is required to avoid slipping and sliding down

the slope.

he slithering, obscene runes carved into the

metal of the pitted blade were not the icons

of good and light, Aedwar was sure.

But  the  tombstone  golems  roused  as

age-old pacts were triggered, and guardian

demons swarmed around him, defending the nal

resting place of their ancient master.

Desperate, Aedwar snatched up the blade. It seared

his  hand  with  cold,  shooting  tendrils  of  weakness

through his limbs. It was a thing of evilbut it was

the only weapon at hand. It was this awful sword or

nothing. Steeling himself against the terrible pain,

he tightened his grip on the blade and turned to face

the endish horde.

Later, with the crumpled, exsanguinated forms of

demons scattered about his feet, Aedwar made to cast

away the sword, but he paused . . .

The pain was less. Oh, it was still there, but it wasnt

the soul-wrenching agony of his rst contact.

Aedwar  wondered  at  the  change,  but  even  more

so at his near miraculous victory over the swarming

demons. The pain had lessened after the battles con-

clusion, as if the blade had reached an accommodation

with its wieldersomehow empowered or changed

by  the  momentous  conictwho,  all  alone  in  a

forgotten tomb, beat back a demonic swell.

Aedwar girded the sword to his belt.

So was the weapon of legacy Exordius founded.

FOUNDING

LEGACY ITEMS

Tales of heroes are told far and wide because of

mighty exploits. Heroes accomplish great tasks,

set to right monumental wrongs, and defeat

insuperable odds, sometimes at great cost. The

item or weapon that a hero uses to accomplish

this goal makes the difference between success

and failure.

With the DMs approval, a player might use

a momentous event as the necessary catalyst

to begin investing her characters signature

item with legacy abilities. She controls the

process of imbuing the item with particular

abilities as she advances in experience, within

the larger context of the campaigns plots and

adventures.

THE DECISION

As a player character, you must decide whether to

invest  the  necessary  energy  and  resources  in

founding an item of legacy. Sometimes the

decision  is  thrust  upon  you  by  events  of

the  campaign:  You  are  the  hero  of  a  story,

which  becomes  the  legend  of  a  later  age.

Implements of that hero become storied

relicsand  possibly  legacy  items.

Only  after  a  founding  event  (see

below) occurs must you make

the decision.

THE FOUNDING

EVENT

wielder  takes  it  up.  Additional  founding  events  al-

low it to gain even more abilities. The candidate item

doesnt even have to be magic

(see  The  Candidate  Item,

below).

What makes a found-

ing  event?  Below  are

some  suggestions.  In  all

cases, the DM makes the nal determi-

nation of the events suitability.

Right Time and

Right Place

The  item  is  responsible  for

resolving a clutch situ-

ation, one that means

the  difference  be-

tween  success  and

disaster. A ring of feath-

er falling might save a character from a

tumble into boiling lava, or gauntlets of

ogre power provide the extra oomph to

break down a door just in time to save

a comrade from a terrible fate.

Every  so  often,  a  dra-

matic  event  shakes  a

campaign.  Perhaps  a  party  defeats

a  mind-killing  illithid  against  all

oddsonly the rogues last, desper-

ate  dagger  thrust  ensures  survival.

On the other hand, the party

might be wiped out. If later

adventurers  then  recover

the  dead  characters  gear

and  learn  the  details  of

the  massacre,  they  can

realize  one  of  the

items  holds  the  seed

of legacy.

Up to three differ-

ent founding events

might occur during

the  empowerment

of  a  legacy  item,

but the rst one es-

Destiny Calls

The item slays an important gure,

whether by design or by a terrible

twist of fate. For example, a ghters

axe cleaves the skull of an orc as-

and accidentally kills a help-

SUMMARY: FOUNDING LEGACY ITEMS

1. Accomplish an appropriate founding event using a suit-

able candidate item.

2. Design a founding ritual based on the founding event.

3. Perform the founding ritual (paying all costs) and gain

a legacy feat.

4. Assign legacy abilities to the item from the following

merely informs the player of each affected character,

who can then choose whether to design an appro-

priate founding ritual.

PC Petition

An  event  occurs  that  a  player  feels  is  important

enough to begin the process of founding a legacy item.

In this case, the player asks the DM for approval to

design an appropriate founding ritual.

THE CANDIDATE ITEM

Founding a legacy item requires a suitable candidate.

Type

The following make suitable candidates for legacy

items:  weapons,  armor,  rings,  rods,  and  staffs.  A

candidate item could also be a crown or circlet, a pair

of gloves, or any one of the different kinds of magic

items that can be worn at the same time, as described

on page 214 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Nothing prevents a belt, a set of bracers, a vest, or

a pair of eye lenses from becoming a legacy item;

however, these are far less likely to serve an active role

during a founding event.

Mundane, Masterwork, or Magic?

Mundane items typically do not possess the necessary

spark of potential to grow into legacy items. Such

an occurrence is extraordinarily rare. A masterwork

item can attain a legacy, but this is unusual.

In general, only items that are already magic in

some fashion have the required thaumaturgical frame-

work to found a legacy. For example, an otherwise

unremarkable +1 longsword could grow into a mighty

bane of evil over the course of many long years and

arduous adventures.

Conversely,  magic  items  that  carry  more  than

minor power do not make suitable candidates for

legacy items. Therefore, weapons and armor with a

+2 or higher effective enhancement bonus cannot

become legacy weapons, nor can other magic items

whose  market  price  is  above  4,000  gp.  Weapons

and armor made of special materials that increase

their market price are still viable candidate items,

as long as their initial enhancement bonus is  no

more than +1.

DESIGNING

FOUNDING RITUALS

Once a founding event occurs that involves a suitable

candidate item, you can found a legacy for that item.

This is a complex process with several steps.

The  rst  crucial  step  in  founding  a  legacy  is  to

chronicle in detail the history of an itemeven if its

history is just beginning. This knowledge will dene

the details of a ritual that encapsulates the founding

event in a formal manner, such as a reenactment or

a ceremony that is somehow related to the items his-

tory.  Each candidate item requires a different ritual,

which must commemorate the event that propelled

the item to potential legacy status. The ritual always

includes the candidate item. Example rituals of the

broadest  type  are  provided  in  the  General  Legacy

Ritual Examples sidebar. When creating a founding

legacy, you can choose from those listed or come up

with a legacy of your own. The legacy descriptions in

Chapter 3 also offer good examples of suitable rituals.

Your ritual should have a name, preferably one that

reects the items unique history.

An items founding rituals, once established, also

make  up  the  rituals  that  a  potential  wielder  (other

than the founder) must perform to unlock the items

legacy abilities.

Once you have designed, performed, and beneted

from  the  rst  ritual,  which  is  called  a  least  legacy

ritual (see below), you gain the Least Legacy feat for

your item as a bonus feat. You also begin to imbue

your item with magical abilities that you can unlock

as you advance in level. You must design and perform

lesser and greater legacy rituals if you want the items

abilities to continue progressing as you grow in power

and experience. As with the least legacy ritual, these

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: LEGACY ITEM

FOUNDING RESTRICTIONS

Designing the rules for items of legacy is a challenge: On

the  one  hand,  the  items  must  be  exciting  and  unique,

while on the other, they cant be so powerful that they de-

stroy game balance. Thus legacy abilities and costs are all

balanced against a characters expected power and wealth

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

at a given level. (The relative values of abilities in the

legacy item menus presented in this chapter also follow

this principle.) Taking these factors into account, as well

as the customized ritual and personal costs of each item,

no  more  than  a  +1  enhancement  bonus  (or  equivalent

ability) is appropriate for a starting item.

new  rituals  must  also  be  tied  to  the  items  history,

however short it might be.

When you perform the founding least legacy ritual,

you  must  pay  all  the  gp  costs  associated  with  that

ritual  (see  Setting  Costs  on  page  184).  In  addition,

you must expend a set amount of experience points,

as described under Least Legacy Founding Ritual (see

below). Lesser and greater legacy founding rituals also

require an expenditure of XP; see the Lesser Legacy

Founding Ritual and Greater Legacy Founding Ritual

sections for details. Those who wield the legacy item

after you do not spend these experience points, and

must only pay the material (gp) costs associated with

each ritual.

Whenever you design a founding ritual, you must

undergo and pay all costs for the ritual yourself before

you or any other wielder can access the legacy abili-

ties associated with that ritual. The legacy founding

process  is  ruined  if  you  pass  the  item  to  another

wielder without rst paying all costs, and you must

start anew.

time, brings a legacy item to the next level of power.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

The least legacy ritual, when performed for the rst

time, turns the item into an item of legacy. This ritual

establishes the general nature and theme of the item,

inuencing  all  its  later  legacy  abilities,  as  well  as

establishing the abilities available from 5th through

10th  level.  Designing  an  appropriate  least  legacy

ritual requires some forethought as well as personal

adaptation of the items specic abilities.

Cost: In addition to the gp cost for raw materials

(see Setting Costs on page 184), designing and per-

forming a least legacy founding ritual requires the

expenditure of 500 XP. Upon completing the ritual,

you gain the Least Legacy feat specic to your item

as a bonus feat.

Lesser Legacy Founding Ritual

GENERAL LEGACY RITUAL EXAMPLES

Many of these example rituals involve a trial, test, dedica-

tion, or similar commitment. Within one day of complet-

ing the listed activity (whether before or after), you must

expend  raw  materials  as  determined  by  the  ritual  type

(least, lesser, or greater).

Trial By Enemy: Choose one creature type (such as an el-

emental, dragon, aberration, and so on), or a specific foe

(such as an evil half-dragon). You must defeat a chosen

foe with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than your

character level.

Requiem:  Enact  a  memorial  service  in  the  location

where the founding event occurred or in a similar loca-

tion. The memorial rite recounts, reveals, or recreates the

founding event.

Ordeal: Undergo a challenge that is physically demand-

ing or involves physical or mental danger, and that some-

how recounts, reveals, or recreates the founding event.

Test: Prove your prowess in some skill, test, or feat.

Alternatively, you must run a gantlet of successive chal-

lenges or labors.

Purification:  The  item  must  be  purified  in  some  way.

This might involve bathing it in special waters, anointing

it with blessed oils, or some other action and materials

relating to the founding event.

Meditation: Meditate on the item for one day per char-

acter level. You must spend at least 8 continuous hours

in meditation each day; during this period, you cannot

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

engage  in  mentally  or  physically  demanding  activities,

such as combat or spellcasting. If your meditation is inter-

rupted, the ritual fails and must be restarted; however, you

do not need to pay its gp cost again.

Pledge: Dedicate yourself to some principle or philoso-

phy related to the founding event. Each time you fail to

act in accordance with this pledge, you are unable to use

the two highest-level available abilities of your legacy item

for one day. If you repeatedly fail to honor the pledge, you

lose access to those abilities for additional days.

Knowledge: Educate yourself in some area of knowledge

that  relates  to  the  founding  event.  In  game  terms,  you

must  purchase  at  least  1  rank  in  a  suitable  Knowledge

skill, either immediately (if skill points remain available)

or when you next attain a level.

Reverence: Enact a service that reveres a deity, spirit,

or other aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers,

songs, or rituals. You must enact the service in the location

where the founding event occurred or a similar location.

Quest:  Pledge  yourself  to  a  specific  activity  related

to the founding event, such as slaying some great foe,

recovering  a  magnificent  relic,  surviving  a  mythically

dangerous passage, and so on. Unless you specify other-

wise, you are presumed to be following the quest; how-

ever, each day after the initial pledge that you have not

completed the quest, you have a 10% chance of being

unable to use the two highest-level available abilities of

your legacy item.

It  allows  you  to  establish  further  legacy  abilities,

available from 11th through 16th level.

Cost: In addition to the gp cost for raw materials

(see Setting Costs on page 184), designing and per-

forming a lesser legacy founding ritual requires the

expenditure of 1,100 XP. Upon

completing the ritual, you

gain  the  Lesser  Legacy

feat specic to your item

as a bonus feat.

Greater Legacy

Founding Ritual

The greater legacy ritual,

when performed for the

rst time, brings a lega-

cy item to the highest

level of power. It allows

you to establish ultimate

legacy  abilities,  avail-

able from 17th through

20th level.

Cost: In addition to the

gp cost for raw materials

(see Setting Costs on page

184), designing and perform-

ing a greater legacy founding

ritual requires the expenditure of

1,700 XP. Upon completing the ritual,

you gain the Greater Legacy feat spe-

cic to your item as a bonus feat.

ASSIGNING

LEGACY ABILITIES

The process of assigning legacy abilitiesthe powers

that give a legacy item its identityis complex. As a

player whose character is founding an item of legacy,

you should work with your Dungeon Master to create

a suite of interesting and avorful abilities that har-

monize to form a unique creation.

You have two options when assigning legacy abil-

ities.  On  completing  a  given  founding  ritual,  you

can choose all the abilities that are accessible to the

associated legacy feat, effectively creating a

road map to follow over the rest of your

career. Alternatively, if your DM allows,

you can choose each legacy abil-

ity  when  you  attain  the  next

character  level  that  allows

access to a new ability. You

must  still  select  abilities

available for the appropri-

ate  legacy  feat  you  have

(least abilities if you have

the Least Legacy feat). The

second  option  allows

much  more  flexibility

but needs the approval

of  the  DM  to  prevent

abuseotherwise  you

could simply choose the

best ability for whatever

challenge you happen to be

facing at the time.

To guide you in choosing appro-

priate  legacy  abilities,  this  chapter

presents a series of menus. Each menu

includes a range of abilities of roughly

equivalent value, allowing a nearly limitless variety

of legacy items. These are not exhaustiveyou can

also create new abilities of roughly the same cost,

even if theyre not found on the menus. (In fact,

many of the legacy items presented in Chapter 3

feature custom abilities that do not exactly match

menu choices.) If you do so, determine a reasonable

value for the ability (as a guide, try comparing it to

equivalent magic item properties) or just compare

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: XP COSTS

FOR FOUNDING RITUALS

Founding a new legacy item (that is, designing and creating

it from scratch) costs XP in addition to the raw materials

costs for unlocking an existing items abilities. The reasons

for this are twofold.

First, designing your own legacy item from the ground up

allows it to more closely fit your needs, as well as your cam-

paign history. This makes the legacy more meaningful to you,

but it also makes the item more powerful in your hands.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Second, if awakening a legacy item cost no more than

creating a new one, there would be little reason to discover

legacy itemscharacters would simply found their own,

allowing  them  to  customize  items  for  the  same  price.

Legacy items are intended to lend a distinctive cachet to

a campaign as well as to reinforce its unique history and

background, so there should be an incentive to introduce

preexisting ones rather than have every player design his

or her own.

183

its effect to similar abilities already listed in the

menus  or  on  preconstructed  legacy  items.  Then

determine  the  appropriate  menu  and  assign  the

ability accordingly.

You  can  choose  any  given  ability  from  a  menu

just once, unless specically noted otherwise. For

example, if you choose the armor or shield enhance-

ment ability from Menu A, you cant choose it again

as a least ability for that item.

You also cant front-load an item with powerful

abilities at low levels from higher menus (which

require additional slots from lower menus) and leave

higher levels empty. For example, when selecting an

ability from Menu B or C, you must lose Menu A

slots. The empty slots must precede the slots lled by

those menu abilities. If you choose two least abilities,

one from Menu A and one from Menu B, the Menu

A ability would appear at 5th level while the Menu

B abilitywhich costs two Menu A slotswould

appear at 7th level (leaving 6th level empty).

OMENS

In addition to legacy abilities, each item of legacy

has an omen: a minor power that makes the item

recognizable as something special. Of all the abili-

ties you assign to an item when founding a legacy,

only the omen can be used by a wielder without the

Least Legacy feat specic to that item. (Of course, the

original magical properties of the item also remain

available to any wielder, with or without an enabling

legacy feat.) Choose one of the ability categories from

the Omen menu on page 188, then design its specic

features. Alternatively, you can design a minor magical

ability based on examples from preconstructed items

in Chapter 3 (such as the +2 bonus on Concentration

checks granted by the Bones of Li-Peng or Bright Evening

Stars light ability).

An omen manifests while the item is in use, when

rst drawn, or on some other triggering factor you

specify.

LEGACY ABILITIES

Each legacy feat (least, lesser, and greater) is repre-

sented by three menus listing legacy items appropriate

to that level of power. The rst menu in a series lists

the  least  powerful  abilities.  The  simplest  way  to

assign abilities for a given legacy feat is to choose

one from the rst menu (for example, Menu A for

least legacy) for each level in the appropriate range.

Abilities from higher menus are more powerful and

take  up  additional  ability  slots:  For  example,  each

Menu B choice replaces two Menu A choices, while

each Menu C choice replaces three Menu A choices.

You can always choose an ability from a lower menu

instead, if you prefer.

Each of the abilities listed in a menu has a generic

title that describes its effect. To make your item more

interesting, you can give the ability a colorful name

that reinforces the items theme. For example, if you

are founding a legacy item that is somehow associated

with mind ayers, and you choose the detect thoughts

ability from Menu A, you might instead name the

ability inltrate brain. Many of the legacy items in

Chapter 3 have custom abilities that arent readily

summed up by a simple spell name, for example, and

have interesting names as a result.

Least abilities are the least potent (aside from the

omen), and represent the rst tier of power resident

in an item of legacy. These abilities are described in

Menus A, B, and C.

Lesser abilities represent a moderate to high level

of power and are described in Menus D, E, and F.

Greater abilities represent the pinnacle of a legacy

items power. Greater abilities are described in Menus

G, H, and I.

Unless otherwise specied, a legacy ability takes

effect whenever you carry, wield, wear, or otherwise

use the item of legacy.

SETTING COSTS

After designing the legacy rituals and assigning abili-

ties to the item, you must decide on and set the ritual

costs (in gp) and personal costs (such as hit point loss

or attack penalties).

Ritual  costs  are  fairly  standard,  but  there  is  no

simple method for assigning personal costs. You cant

just choose a personal cost from a menuit must have

a consequence to both the founder and any subsequent

wielder. Work together with your DM to design costs

that are meaningful but not crippling.

A  legacy  items  personal  costs  are  offset  by  its

uniquely powerful abilities. Although it seems as

though the wielder is accepting an onerous burden,

the payoff is an item that is much more powerful

than might otherwise be expected at a given char-

acter level.

ritual  and  personal  costs  appropriate  to  a  range  of

presented in Chapter 3 do not follow them precisely.

Each progression lists the gp cost of the least, lesser,

and greater legacy rituals, as well as the personal costs

assessed against the wielder and the levels at which

those  costs  are  assessed.  The  ritual  costs  for  each

progression are similar but not identical.

A  given  progression  is  appropriate  for  a  certain

class of legacy items. For example, a progression that

applies attack penalties has little effect on the average

wizard, whereas skill penalties dont mean much to

combat-focused characters such as ghters.

Tables 41 and 42 impose signicant hit point

losses, along with penalties on attack rolls and saving

throws. These are most appropriate for items intended

for ghters, paladins, barbarians, and other charac-

ters who focus on martial talents. Table 42 applies

a penalty only to a single saving throw (Fortitude,

Reflex,  or  Will,  at  the  founders  option),  but  the

penalty is more severe than the general penalties

assessed in Table 41. Neither of these progressions

is suitable for characters who dont rely on attack rolls

(such as wizards). Hit point losses are cumulative,

but penalties on attacks and saves represent the total

at a given level.

Tables  43  and  44  impose  costs  related  to  both

combat  (hit  points  or  attack  penalty)  and  skill  use

(skill points or skill check penalty). These progressions

work best with characters who rely on both, such as

rangers, barbarians, monks, and rogues. Table 43 is

meant for those with higher hit points (such as barbar-

ians), while Table 44 is more heavily weighted toward

those with lower hit points (such as rogues). Neither

of these progressions is suitable for martial characters

who dont rely heavily on skills (such as ghters) or

who are neither combat specialists nor skill-users

(such as sorcerers). Hit point and skill point losses are

cumulative, but penalties on attacks and skill checks

represent the total at a given level.

Table  45  is  similar  to  Table  44,  except  that  it

replaces the attack penalty with a save penalty and

drastically reduces the hit point cost. It is best suited

to skill-using characters who dont engage in much

combat, such as bards and rogues who are fast-talking

or deft rather than sneak attackers. It is not appropri-

ate for characters with fewer than 6 skill points per

level, since it can severely limit skill acquisition.

Hit point and skill point losses are cumulative, but

penalties on saves and skill checks represent the total

Tables 46 through 48 apply personal costs that

include lost spell slots. Thus they are appropriate only

for spellcasting characters. Table 46 offers the most

widely applicable progression, useful for any pure

spellcaster (cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard). Table

47 works well with spellcasters who have some melee

capability (such as clerics and druids), replacing skill

check and save penalties with penalties on attack rolls.

Table 48 is best suited to characters who combine

limited spellcasting with skill use (mostly bards,

though items for rangers who dont advance past lesser

legacy could also use this table). Spell slot, hit point,

and skill point losses are cumulative, but penalties on

attacks, saves, caster level, and skill checks represent

the total at a given level.

Tables 49 and 410 offer psionic equivalents for

spellcaster cost progression. Most of the cost here is

assessed as power point lossesthe psionic equivalent

EXAMPLE LEGACY ITEM DESIGN

Dave is playing a 5th-level character who founds a legacy

shield: Praetorian Bulwark. Before the founding ritual, the

shield has a +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class but no

other magical properties. Dave decides to assign all of the

shields legacy abilities at the time of the founding ritual.

He chooses one option from Menu A for the items

5th-level  legacy  ability:  an  increased  enhancement

bonus to the shields AC. As soon as Daves character

completes the least legacy ritual and pays the appropri-

ate costs, his shields enhancement bonus immediately

improves to +2.

For  the  next  legacy  ability,  Dave  decides  to  increase

the shields enhancement bonus again. To do so requires

choosing  the  enhanced  armor  or  shield  option  from

Menu B, because the Menu A choice cant be taken again.

A Menu B choice uses up two least ability slots: one abil-

ity that would otherwise be available from Menu A at 6th

level  and  one  at  7th  level.  Therefore,  Daves  character

unlocks no new legacy ability at 6th level, instead waiting

until 7th level before Praetorian Bulwarks enhancement

bonus improves to +3.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Dave  could  choose  another  Menu  A  ability  for  8th

level, but instead he opts for the fly ability from Menu

C. This takes up three least ability slots, meaning that

his character cant unlock that ability until he reaches

10th level.

Having now assigned all his items least ability slots,

Dave  has  founded  a  legacy  shield.  Once  his  character

reaches  11th  level,  Dave  will  need  to  decide  whether

he  wants  to  design  a  lesser  legacy  ritual  and  continue

adding powers to Praetorian Bulwark.

Finally,  Dave  must  assign  ritual  and  personal  costs

for  his  items  least  abilities.  Because  a  shield  is  most

suited to a combat-oriented character, Dave decides to

use Table 1. His character expends raw materials worth

2,500 gp to perform the least legacy ritual. On attaining

6th level he will lose 4 hit points, and another 2 at 9th.

He takes a 1 penalty on all saving throws at 8th level,

and a 1 penalty on all attack rolls at 9th level. If he de-

cides to unlock the Praetorian Bulwarks lesser abilities,

he  must  pay  the  appropriate  ritual  and  personal  costs

from the same table.

of spell slots. (Soulknives should use a progression

appropriate to combat-focused characters, since their

psionic abilities dont rely on power points.) Table 49

is intended for classes such as the psion or wilder who

focus entirely on psionic powers. Table 410 is better

suited to the psychic warrior and similar psionic

classes, imposing a lower power point cost progres-

sion at the cost of hit point losses and attack penalties.

Hit point and power point losses are cumulative, but

penalties on attacks and manifester level represent

the total at a given level.

Some characters dont  t neatly into these categories.

Thats okayjust use your best judgment. You dont

have to  nd a perfect match in these tables, as long

as the personal costs are appropriate for the wielders

character archetype and represent meaningful, but

reasonable, expenditures.

LEGACY ABILITY MENUS

The menus of omens and legacy abilities presented

below provide an  la carte approach to creating new

legacy items. Follow the instructions presented earlier

in this chapter to assign omens and abilities.

Unless noted otherwise, you can select a speci c

menu choice only once.

OMEN MENU

When you found a legacy item, before assigning legacy

abilities, choose one omen type from this menu to

assign to your legacy item. Once you choose an omen

type, customize the ability to your speci c item. For

instance, if you choose an audible omen, decide what

sound or sounds your item makes and under what

circumstances. Once customized, the omen does

not change.

Auditory: The item sings, weeps, whispers, or makes

some other sound. If the item produces words, they

cannot be more than preprogrammed phrases.

Material: The item displays some minor material

effect. This might manifest as illusory substances,

such as seeping blood, running shadows, or slime,

or as programmed visual illusions, such as a blinking

eye or a snarling mouth. No blood, slime, or other

material is actually produced.

Mental:  A  threatening  voice  echoes  telepathi-

cally in the mind of speci ed creatures, promising

eventual death by the legacy item, or some similar

preprogrammed phrase. Examples of such targets are

creatures whose alignments differ from your own,

members of a particular race or class, and so on.

Olfactory: The item produces a signature odor, such

as the scorched smell of burning steel, the coppery

tang of blood, the ozone stench of lightning, and

the like.

Visible: The item shines,  ickers, glows, strobes,

or produces some other light effect.

ABILITY MENU A (LEAST)

When you found a legacy item and perform a least

legacy ritual, assign least abilities to the item from

the following menu. You choose one ability at 5th

level,  and  one  for  each  additional  character  level

up to 10th level.

Alternatively,  you  can  lose  Menu  A  choices  to

select  abilities  from  Menus  B  and  C,  as  described

under those menus.

Enhancement  (Su):

The  effective  enhance-

ment  bonus  of  a  suit

of  armor  or  a  shield

increases by 1, to a max-

imum  of  +2.  You  can

instead choose any spe-

cial ability whose market

price is equivalent to a +1

bonus, such as light forti-

 cation. This ability can

be placed only on a suit

of armor or a shield.

you empathically, and can hear and see out to 60

feet. It gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

scores: Two of these are 13, typically Intelligence

and Charisma, and the third is 10. The legacy items

Ego score is calculated as normal for an intelligent

item (include the items enhancement bonus, telepa-

thy,  if  any,  and  ability  bonuses,  but  not  its  legacy

abilities). Its Ego also increases as more legacies are

unlocked. An item with one or more least abilities

has 2 additional Ego points; one with one or more

lesser  abilities  has  4;  and  one  with  one  or  more

greater abilities has 8 (these additional Ego points

are not cumulative).

Invisibility (Su): Once per day, when you issue the

command word and gesture with the item, you become

invisible. This works like the invisibility spell.

open locked or magically sealed doors, as with the

knock spell. Doing this requires touching the item to

or striking it against the object to be opened.

ally understand all spoken and written languages,

as if continually affected by the comprehend lan-

guages spell.

Creature Compass (Su): While holding, wearing,

or  wielding  the  item,  you  can  detect  any  one  type

or subtype of creature within 60 feet, but you must

concentrate (a standard action) to do so. You ignore

any damage reduction of the specied creature when

attacking it (whether with the item, if a weapon, or

with some other weapon, unarmed attack, or natural

weapon, provided you are wearing or otherwise using

the item). Choose the creature type or subtype when

you assign this ability to the item. This can be any of

the general types described in the Monster Manual or a

subtype, if the creature type is humanoid or outsider,

just like the rangers favored enemy class ability (see

page 47 of the Players Handbook).

Cure  Light  Wounds  (Sp):  Three  times  per  day,

you can use cure light wounds as the spell by touch-

ing the item to the creature to be healed (including

yourself) and speaking a command word. This ability

a different command word for each effect.

Metamagic,  Lesser  (Su):  You  can  apply  the

effect of one metamagic feat to up to three spells

per day that you cast of up to 3rd level. This can be

any metamagic feat that normally adjusts a spells

slot  by  one  level  (such  as  Enlarge  Spell,  Extend

Spell,  or  Silent  Spell);  choose  the  specific  feat

when assigning this ability to the item. Using this

legacy ability does not change the spell slot of the

altered spell. A spontaneous spellcaster (such as a

sorcerer) must still take a full-round action when

using this ability, just as if using a metamagic feat

he possessed.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

cast spells.

Metapsionic,  Lesser  (Su):  You  can  apply  the

effect of one metapsionic feat to up to three psionic

powers per day that you manifest of up to 3rd level.

This can be any one of Delay Power, Enlarge Power,

Extend Power, or Split Psionic Ray (see Chapter 3:

Skills and Feats in the Expanded Psionics Handbook).

Choose the specic feat when assigning this ability

to the item. Using this legacy ability does not change

the power point cost of the altered power.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

manifest psionic powers.

Mirror Image (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use mirror image as the spell.

Mount  (Su):  When  you  throw  the  item  to  the

ground while speaking the command word, it trans-

forms into a normal, living light horse or pony (your

choice) to serve you as a mount for as long as you

choose. The mount is equipped with a bit, bridle, and

riding saddle. When you dismount and take hold of

the reins, you can speak the command word again to

cause the mount to revert to its original form. While

your legacy item is serving as a mount, you cannot

use any of its other abilities. If the mount is slain, the

item reverts to its original form and cannot be used

as a mount again for 24 hours.

Protection  from  Arrows  (Sp):  Once  per  day

on  command,  you  can  use  protection  from  arrows

as the spell.

Resist Energy (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use resist energy as the spell.

tance  bonus  on  all  saving  throws.  You  can  select

the speed of one of your modes of movement by 5

feet.  Choose  the  specic  movement  mode  when

assigning this ability to the item. You cant add this

bonus to a form of movement you dont already have

(for example, if you dont have a y speed, this abil-

ity cant give you one). Treat this adjustment as an

enhancement bonus.

Summon Monster II (Sp): Once per day when

you issue the command word and gesture with the

item, you can use summon monster II as the spell.

Telekinetic (Su): You can use mage hand, mending,

and open/close at will as the spells, using a different

Unceasing Servant (Su): You enjoy the continual

benet of an unseen servant, as the spell. If dissipated

by 6 or more points of damage from an area attack, or

if it ceases to exist by moving more than 35 feet away

from you, the servant re-forms 1 round later in any

square adjacent to you.

Weapon  Enhancement:  Your  weapon  gains  an

enhancement bonus of +1. This ability can be placed

only on a weapon.

ABILITY MENU B (LEAST)

When you found a legacy item and perform a least

legacy ritual, you can choose a Menu B ability at the

cost of two Menu A slots. You cannot trade in exist-

ing Menu A abilities for an ability from this menu. A

skipped slot means that no legacy ability is available

at that character level. For example, if you assigned a

Menu A ability at 5th level, you could assign a Menu

B ability at 7th level, gaining no new legacy ability at

6th level. You still pay personal costs for a given level,

even if you gain no new legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from Menu A in place

of one from Menu B.

Menu B abilities have a caster level of 7th.

legacy ability is available at that character level. For

example, if you assigned a Menu D ability at 11th

level, you could assign a Menu E ability at 13th level,

gaining no new legacy ability at 12th level. You still

issue the command word and gesture with the item,

you can move or hurl an object, or attack a creature,

as the telekinesis spell. The save DC is 17, or 15 + your

Charisma modier, whichever is higher. Treat the

item as having a Charisma of 14 (or use your Cha-

risma score, if higher) for the purpose of adjudicating

this effect.

Teleport (Sp): Two times per day, when you issue

the command word and gesture with the item, you

can use teleport as the spell.

Wall of Force (Sp): Two times per day, when you

enhancement bonus of a weapon increases, as shown

in the table below. This ability can be placed only on

a weapon, and it can be selected multiple times. You

cannot  increase  the  weapons  actual  enhancement

your normal number of 2nd-level arcane spells per

day, as though wearing a ring of wizardry II.

ABILITY MENU H (GREATER)

If you continue to enhance a legacy item by perform-

ing a greater legacy ritual, you can choose a Menu H

ability at the cost of two Menu G slots. You cannot

trade in existing Menu G abilities for an ability

from this menu. A skipped slot means that no legacy

ability is available at that character level. For example,

if you assigned a Menu G ability at 17th level, you

could assign a Menu H ability at 19th level, gaining

no new legacy ability at 18th level. You still pay per-

sonal costs for a given level, even if you gain no new

legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from any lower menu

in place of one from Menu H.

Menu H abilities have a caster level of 17th.

Armor or Shield Enhancement (Su): The effec-

tive enhancement bonus of a suit of armor or a shield

can create a Large magic hand that can attack foes, as

the Bigbys clenched st spell.

Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass (Sp): Three times

per day on command, you can use mass cure moderate

wounds as the spell. This instead deals damage to

undead creatures. The save DC is 19, or 16 + your

Charisma modier, whichever is higher.

Disintegrate (Sp): Once per day, when you issue

the command word and gesture with the item, you

cause it to emit a thin green ray that destroys one

creature utterly, as the disintegrate spell. The save

DC is 19, or 16 + your Charisma modier, whichever

is higher.

Displacement (Su): While you are holding, wear-

ing, or wielding the item, you can activate displacement

for 1 round as a swift action, as though wearing a major

201

cloak of displacement. You can use this ability up to ten

times per day.

Energy  Resistance,  Greater  (Su):  The  item

protects  you  against  damage  from  one  type  of

energyacid, cold, electricity, re, or sonic. Each

time you would normally take such damage, subtract

30  points  from  the  damage  dealt.  Choose  the

specic type of energy when assigning this

ability to the item.

You can select this option mul-

tiple times. Each time you do so, it

applies to a different type of energy.

This ability does not stack with energy

resistance from previous menus.

Ethereal

Jaunt  (Su):

Once  per  day,

when  you  issue

the  command  word  and

gesture  with  the  item,  you  can

become ethereal. This works like the

ethereal jaunt spell. You can remain

once you return to material form,

you cannot become ethereal again

day, when you issue the command word

and  gesture  with  the  item,  you  can

kill one living creature, as the nger of death spell.

action, you can use heal on yourself when holding,

wearing, or wielding the item.

Horrid  Wilting  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  when  you

the benet of the iron body spell.

Maximize Power (Su): You can manifest up to

three psionic powers per day of up to 6th level that

are maximized as though using the Maximize Power

for details). Using this legacy ability does not change

the power point cost of the altered power.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

manifest psionic powers.

Maximize Spell (Su): You can cast up to three

spells per day of up to 6th level that are maximized

as though using the Maximize Spell metamagic feat.

Using this legacy ability does not change the spell

slot of the altered spell. A spontaneous spellcaster

(such as a sorcerer) must still take a full-round action

when  using  this  ability,  just  as  if  using  a

metamagic feat he possessed.

You cannot use this ability if you

cannot already cast spells.

Mind  Blank  (Su):

While  you  are  holding,

wearing, or wielding the

item, your mind is protected

from mental and emotional tam-

pering, as if continually affected

by the mind blank spell.

Once  per  day,  while  you  are

holding,  wearing,  or  wield-

ing  the  item,  you  can  gain  a

+20 insight bonus on a single

spell. You must declare that you

are activating the effect before you

make the roll.

day, when you issue the command word

and gesture with the item, you cause it

to  emit  shimmering,  multicolored  beams  of  light

with a variety of effects, as the prismatic spray spell.

The save DC is 20, or 17 + your Charisma modier,

whichever is higher.

of spells in the item, as though it were a ring of spell

storing.

when  you  issue  the  command  word  and  gesture

with the item, you can use summon monster VII as

the spell.

Weapon  Enhancement  (Su):  The  effective

enhancement bonus of a weapon increases, as shown

in the table below. This ability can be placed only on

a weapon, and can be selected multiple times. You

cannot increase the weapons actual enhancement

bonus beyond +5.

Instead  of  increasing  the  enhancement  bonus,

you can choose any combination of enhancement

bonuses  and  special  abilities  whose  total  market

price is equivalent to the effective bonus increase.

Wishes,  Two  (Su):  The  item  grants  you  two

wishes as the wish spell. You must state the desired

effect while holding the item. As long as you have

performed the appropriate legacy ritual  and meet

the  level  requirement,  you  gain  this  benet,  even

if a previous owner has made two wishes using the

item. A given creature can never gain more than two

wishes in this way. If a save is allowed, the save DC

is  23,  or  19  +  your  Charisma  modier,  whichever

is higher.

Wizardry III (Su): While you are holding, wear-

ing, or wielding the item, you can prepare or cast

double your normal number of 3rd-level arcane spells

per day, as though wearing a ring of wizardry III.

ABILITY MENU I (GREATER)

If  you  continue  to  enhance  a  legacy  item  by  per-

forming  a  greater  legacy  ritual,  you  can  choose  a

Menu  I  ability  at  the  cost  of  three  Menu  G  slots.

You cannot trade in existing Menu G abilities for

an ability from this menu. A skipped slot means that

no legacy ability is available at that character level.

For example, if you assigned a Menu G ability at 17th

level, you could assign a Menu I ability at 20th level,

gaining no new legacy abilities at 18th and 19th level.

You still pay personal costs for a given level, even if

you gain no new legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from any lower menu

in place of one from Menu I.

Menu I abilities have a caster level of 20th.

Constant Companion, Greater (Su): While you

are holding, wearing, or wielding the item, you can

use  a  swift  action  to  summon  an  allied  creature.

When  assigning  this  ability  to  the  item,  choose

one  of  the  creatures  from  the  5th-level  list  of  the

Summon Monster or Summon Natures Ally table

on pages 287 and 288 of the Monster Manual. Only

that creature can be summoned using this ability.

The allied creature attacks your foes and serves you

to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with

the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack

particular  enemies,  or  to  perform  other  actions.

It  remains  with  you  unless  dismissed  (a  standard

action) or killed. If the creature is slain, it can be

summoned again after 24 hours, fully healed. You

can never have more than one greater companion at

any one time.

Crushing Hand (Sp): Once per day, when you

issue the command word and gesture with the item,

you can create a Large magic hand that can crush

foes, as the Bigbys crushing hand spell.

Dominate Monster (Sp): Once per day, when you

issue the command word and gesture with the item,

you can use dominate monster as the spell. The save

DC is 23, or 19 + your Charisma modier, whichever

is higher.

Empower Power, Greater (Su): You can mani-

fest  up  to  three  psionic  powers  per  day  of  up  to

9th level that are empowered as though using the

Empower Power metapsionic feat. Using this legacy

ability does not change the power point cost of the

altered power.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

manifest psionic powers.

Empower Spell, Greater (Su): You can cast up

to  three  spells  per  day  of  up  to  9th  level  that  are

empowered  as  though  using  the  Empower  Spell

metamagic feat. Using this legacy ability does not

change the spell slot of the altered spell. A spontane-

ous spellcaster (such as a sorcerer) must still take a

full-round action when using this ability, just as if

using a metamagic feat he possessed.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

cast spells.

Energy Drain (Sp): Once per day, when you issue

the command word and gesture with the item, you

cause it to emit a black beam of negative energy that

bestows 2d4 negative levels on a subject, as the energy

drain spell. The save DC is 23, or 19 + your Charisma

modier, whichever is higher.

Heal,  Mass  (Sp):  Three  times  per  day  on  com-

mand, you can use mass heal as the spell. This ability

can instead deal damage to undead creatures. The

save  DC  is  23,  or  19  +  your  Charisma  modier,

whichever is higher.

Imprisonment  (Su):  Once  per  day,  when  you

make a successful melee touch attack against a foe,

you can imprison that foe beneath the earth, as the

imprisonment  spell.  You  must  declare  that  you  are

activating  the  effect  before  you  make  the  attack

roll. If the item is a melee weapon, use it to make

the touch attack.

his chapter presents a variety of twists that

you, as the DM, can add to expand the rules

for items of legacy. From items with dual,

even opposing legacies to monsters that

seethe  with  mythic  power,  from  heroes

sharing legacies with comrades to wielders unlock-

ing epic legacy abilities, this chapter lets you further

customize a legacy-themed campaign.

ALTERNATIVES

TO KNOWLEDGE

(HISTORY) CHECKS

Making a Knowledge (history) check is the usual means

of learning the background and rituals associated with

a legacy item. At your discretion, other methods are

possible. The following optional rules make using

legacy items easier for less scholarly adventurers.

OTHER KNOWLEDGE SKILLS

Weapons tied heavily to a specic church or deity,

such as the Bow of the Black Archer or Durindana, might

be  featured  prominently  in  the  myths  and  dogma

of that religion. In such cases, you might allow the

PCs to substitute Knowledge (religion) checks for

Knowledge (history) checks. Likewise, the history

of an item strongly tied to the arcane, such as Bright

Evening  Star,  might  warrant  Knowledge  (arcana)

checks, while one that figures prominently in

local affairs and tales might be uncovered with a

Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check.

If the player makes a valid case for substituting

another Knowledge check, go ahead and allow it.

However, you should increase the check DCs by

5, since these sorts of tales seldom include the

specic details necessary to properly perform

legacy rituals.

BARDIC KNOWLEDGE

AND LORE

Bards,  with  their  vast  repertoire  of  tales,

histories, and gossip, might very well know

something of legacy items and their history.

You can allow a bardic knowledge check as

a substitute for Knowledge (history), but you

should  increase  the  check  DC  by  5  to  reect

the fact that bardic knowledge is sketchy and

incomplete in most cases.

Loremasters focus exclusively on ancient secrets,

unlike bards. Their repertoire of knowledge is vast, so

a loremasters lore check should entail no DC increase

if used in place of a Knowledge (history) check.

MAGICAL DIVINATION

Using  divination  magic  is  the  easiest,  most  effi-

cient way to learn the history of a legacy item. The

identify and legend lore spells are commonly used

for this purpose.

Identify: This spell reveals all the standard magical

abilities of a legacy item but none of its legacy abili-

ties. It does, however, grant a +2 bonus on Knowledge

(history) checks (or alternative checks) to research the

items background.

Legend Lore: This spell uncovers enough knowl-

edge to learn and perform all legacy rituals for

an item.

MUTABLE LEGACY ITEMS

Mutable items are a special subcategory of legacy

items whose properties change with the addition

of  different  components.  Skull  Lash,  for  example

(see page 147), confers on its wielder special abilities

characteristic of the creature whose skulls forms one

of the ails heads. Other examples of mutable legacy

items include a sword with energy-related abilities

that depend on the type of gem set in its pommel,

or a crossbow with the bane special ability against

creatures dened by the material of its bolts. Each

variable component might be very specic (such as

a unique gemstone said to possess a link to the lands

206

of the dead) or broader (such as a polished marble orb

or the talons of a red dragon).

DESIGNING A MUTABLE ITEM

In general, a mutable item is designed just like any

other legacy item, as described in Chapter 4: Found-

ing Legacies. Add the following entries to the legacy

ability menus in that chapter.

Legacy  Ability  Menu  BMutable  Legacy:  Select

any three abilities from Menu A.

Legacy  Ability  Menu  CMutable  Legacy:  Select

any two abilities from Menu B.

Legacy  Ability  Menu  EMutable  Legacy:  Select

any three abilities from Menu D.

Legacy  Ability  Menu  FMutable  Legacy:  Select

any two abilities from Menu E.

Legacy  Ability  Menu  HMutable  Legacy:  Select

any three abilities from Menu G.

Legacy Ability Menu IMutable Legacy: Select any

two abilities from Menu H.

You cant use a mutable legacy ability choice to select

other mutable legacy abilities. For example, you cant

use a Menu C choice to select mutable legacy twice

from Menu B. Just like most menu choices, you cant

select more than one mutable legacy option from any

menu. Thus, you can choose mutable legacy once from

Menu B and once from Menu C, but not twice from

either menu.

A mutable legacy choice cant be an ability with a

limited number of daily uses.

Examples of Designing Mutable

Legacy Items

Example 1: You are designing a legacy longsword

with energy-related abilities that depend on the type of

gem set into its pommel. It also has two suites of divine

magical  abilities,  each  linked  to  the  specic  deity

whose holy symbol is tied on a leather thong around

the crossguard. You select three menu A abilities as a

menu B mutable legacy choicelinking them to the

pommel gemand two Menu E abilities as a Menu

F mutable legacy choice, linking them to the holy

symbol. Thus, depending on the components attached

to the sword, it displays any of six different combina-

tions of menu A and menu E legacy abilities.

Example 2: You are designing a legacy staff with

three different sets of related legacy powers, and each

set is afliated with a particular component: the stone

set into the tip of the staff. You select mutable lega-

cies from Menus B, E, and H, then assign one ability

from each trio of lower-level abilities to each of three

different stones (say, obsidian, marble, and granite).

Depending on the afxed stone, the staff will have

one of three different sets of abilities, each progressing

all the way to 20th level.

Variable Components

Once you have chosen the items mutable legacy abili-

ties, decide what variable components will actually

unlock them, as well as which ability is linked to each

component.  Depending  on  the  item,  variable  com-

ponents can be nearly anything: a swords blade, the

gemstone set in a ring, a staffs capstone, a decorative

feather hung from a club, or one of countless other

options. Let your creativity run wildthe only rule

is that components must be either general or specic.

General  components  are  a  broad  category  of  items

or substances, any of which will sufce as the items

variable component. Specific components are just

thatspecic or even unique items (such as a crystal

from the hoard of the ancient red dragon Durtaxstein-

gakila). Mere limitations on appropriate components

are not sufcient to make them specic.

In the above example of the longsword, you have

already decided it will have two variable components:

the pommel gem and the holy symbol tied to the

guard. Youve also decided to link the set of three

Menu A legacy abilities to the pommel gem and the

set of two Menu E legacy abilities to the holy symbol.

The unique variability of the sword is the focus, and

you dont want the PCs to get derailed by side quests to

nd some legendary component, such as the Diamond

of Enth-Kai, so you decide to make both components

general. However, you specify types of gems that relate

to a given Menu A ability and energy type: rubies for

re, sapphires for cold, and diamonds for electricity.

You likewise limit the holy symbol options to two

particular deities: Heironeous, god of valor, and St.

Cuthbert, god of retribution.

Finishing Touches

Although the great advantage of mutable legacy items

is their exibility, their ability suites should share a

theme or otherwise relate to one another. Its more

interesting  to  wield  a  sword  with  three  different

energy-related effects, or a variety of restorative abili-

ties, or powers relating to the same faith or pantheon,

than one that alternately heals, blasts with re, or

summons a creature. Possible themes include energy

types, alignments, the planes, monster or animal

abilities, a deity or pantheons portfolio or domains,

ancestral wisdom, and schools of magic. Of course,

you are free to design mutable legacy items with no

unifying theme at all, but doing so makes them much

less special and weakens their symbolic value.

USING VARIABLE COMPONENTS

The rules for actually using variable components

in a mutable legacy item are simpler than those for

designing such an item. As a player character, you

simply need to discover and obtain the appropriate

component, afx it to the legacy item, and perform a

brief ritual to activate the items new abilities.

Discovering Variable Components

Some mutable items have very obvious variable com-

ponents, with few or no restrictions (Skull Lash, for

example, accepts any skull of the appropriate creature

types). Other mutable items, however, have variable

components that are more esoteric, or for which fewer

items will serve. Returning to the above example, the

mutable legacy longsword accepts only three types of

pommel gems and two types of holy symbols. If you

were to attach another kind of gem, such as amethyst,

to the swords pommel, the weapon would gain no

new legacy abilities.

Discovering  each  of  a  mutable  items  eligible

components requires a DC 15 Knowledge (history)

check if general, a DC 20 check if specic, and a DC

25 check if unique. For every 5 points by which you

beat the check DC, you discover one extra variable

component. For example, if you are seeking suitable

components  for  the  pommel  gem  of  the  example

longsword  above  and  get  a  result  of  27  on  your

Knowledge  (history)  check,  you  would  learn  two

of the three types of gems that unlock the swords

various energy-related abilities.

Affixing a Component

Depending upon the nature of the variable component

and the legacy item, afxing a component might be as

simple as tying it to the item with a leather thong or

as complex as cutting a gem to t a socket and setting

it with jewelers tools. Unless the DM decides other-

wise, afxing or switching out a legacy items variable

component, including the brief ritual involved, is a full-

round action that draws attacks of opportunities.

DUAL LEGACY ITEMS

Dual legacy items have divergent or even opposing

sets of abilities, each unlocked by a different series of

legacy rituals. Unlike mutable items, the abilities are

xed for a given wielder and cannot be changed once

the ritual is complete. An example of a dual legacy item

is the greatsword Merikel (see page 117), the weapon

of  a  fallen  angel,  which  retains  some  of  its  original

holiness but can also be warped toward evil. It could

become a powerful tool for good in the hands of a good

wielder, but wielded by an evil creature, it manifests

dread, unholy powers. A dual legacy item can pose a

tremendous threat in the hands of an enemy, but it can

make a great reward for a PC who nally claims it.

DESIGNING A

DUAL LEGACY ITEM

In general, a dual legacy item is designed just like

any other legacy item, as described in Chapter 4:

Founding Legacies. However, the process of assign-

ing  abilities  and  designing  legacy  rituals  differs  as

described below.

Selecting Legacy Abilities

Whenever you select a legacy ability from a menu, you

can choose another from the same menu. Do this for

as many abilities as you wish. Each time, designate one

as the primary ability and the other as the secondary

ability. Merikel, for example, has good-aligned, positive,

helpful primary abilities and evil-aligned, negative,

spiteful secondary abilities. Not every legacy ability

needs an alternative; some might be shared by opposing

themes, such as Merikels divine countenance ability

(which grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma

regardless of which path its wielder chooses).

208

Depending on the theme of the item, sets of abilities

might be diametric opposites or only tangentially

connected. For example, a mace possessed by an

evangelical spirit might have one set of weapon special

abilities with no religious afliation, such as aming

burst or defending, and an alternative set of divine

magic-inspired powers such as the holy weapon ability

or the ability to use cure light wounds.

Dual Legacy Rituals

Dual legacy items, such as Merikel, require two legacy

ritual paths, one for each set of abilities. Once you have

started down either path by performing its least legacy

ritual, you are locked in to that path. That ritual path

dictates the legacy abilities you unlock. For instance, if

you wield Merikel and perform the Pious Redemption

ritual, you can use the least abilities associated with

that path (touch of grace and bless).

If you later choose to follow the items alternative

path, you must perform the next ritual to complete

that paths task instead. All of the items legacy abilities,

even those previously unlocked, change to reect the

new path. For example, if you are wielding Merikel,

and have already unlocked its least abilities with the

Pious Redemption ritual, you must perform the Path

of Despair ritual and unlock its lesser abilities to follow

the path of evil. Once the ritual is complete, the touch

of grace and bless abilities would be replaced by their

evil counterparts, touch of fury and bane.

When designing a dual legacy item, you must also

design two sets of rituals to represent the differing

paths. Each of a corresponding pair of rituals requires

the same Knowledge (history) check DC. Each should

have the same costs, both personal and gp, but could

require different tasks. You can even encourage a

potential wielder to prefer one path to the other by

making its tasks easier to complete. For example, a

wielder of Merikel following the path of good need

only travel to the high church of Heironeous to bathe

the sword in blessed water, while the evil path requires

dipping it into the water of the deadly River Styx.

SHARING A LEGACY

A  common  element  in  fantasy  lms  and  literature

is  that  of  the  trusted  companion  who  takes  up  the

weapon of the valiant hero who falls in combat. One

famous example is when Sam wields Sting after Frodo

is taken by Shelob in The Two Towers. You can replicate

such an event with items of legacy. Under the standard

rules presented in this book, if Sir Aerin the Mighty

The path taken by its wielder determines the nature of a dual legacy item

passes the powerful blade Durindana (see page 75) to

his  companion  Enian  the  bard,  that  fabled  weapon

becomes nothing more than a +1 longsword in Enians

handsnot  terribly  impressive  or  heroic.  This  vari-

ant rule provides a method for a willing character to

temporarily bestow upon an ally the ability to wield a

legacy weapon for which that ally has not quali ed.

Sharing a legacy item requires the voluntary and

informed consent of both wielder and recipient. This

consent need not be vocalized or even deliberate; it

can be granted tacitly even when the wielder is uncon-

scious or otherwise incapacitated. However, it cannot

be coerced in any way, magically or otherwise. Only

the intended recipient can bene t (you cant disguise

yourself as the wielders ally to trick her into lending

you the item).

If you are the intended recipient of a legacy item,

you are treated as having the same level as the owner

and  as  having  completed  the  same  legacy  rituals,

regardless of your own level. For example, if you are

a 5th-level character who takes up the legacy blade of

an 18th-level wielder who had completed the greater

legacy ritual, you can use all the items legacy abilities

available up to and including 18th level (if any).

This bene t comes with a heavy cost, though: You

immediately gain one negative level for each legacy

ritual completed by the original wielder. Thus, if the

original wielder has completed only the least legacy

ritual (unlocking the least abilities of the item), you

gain one negative level, but if the owner has completed

all three rituals and unlocked the greater abilities, you

gain three negative levels. These negative levels remain

as long as you continue to wield, wear, or carry the item,

but never result in actual level loss. However, the nega-

tive levels can never be removed in any way (including

restoration spells) while you possess the item. If you

cannot gain negative levels (for example, because you

are a construct or undead creature), you cannot be the

recipient of another characters legacy item.

If the total negative levels equal or exceed your Hit

Dice, you are not killed but instead gain the maximum

number  of  negative  levels  you  can  without  dying.

For each negative level so gained, you have access to

the abilities granted by completing one of the legacy

rituals, beginning with the lowest. For example, if

you are 3rd level and receive a legacy item from an

owner who has completed the greater legacy ritual,

you would gain only two negative levels (instead of

three) and would be able to use only the items least

and lesser abilities (but not the greater abilities).

You might wield the legacy item for as long as the

original owner allows. If the owner dies after con-

senting to transfer the item, you can continue to use

all its available legacy abilities for a limited period of

time after death. The length of time depends on the

highest legacy ritual completed: 1 hour for the greater

legacy ritual, 10 minutes for the lesser, and 1 minute

for the least.

Sharing  a  legacy  item,  even  with  a  trusted

ally, taints the bond between the item and its

true owner. To use the items legacy abilities

again, the original wielder must

complete a minor ceremony

requiring  1  hour  of  un-

interrupted meditation

in  the  presence  of  the

item. After this is com-

pleted, the item returns to

its full normal functionality

for that wielder.

MONSTERS

OF LEGACY

Just as some items take on legacy

abilities  when  tempered  in  the

re of extreme experience, certain

creatures sometimes undergo expe-

riences so extreme that their very

bodies can become imbued with

legacy abilities.

Ironheart  was  a  fairly  typical

azer cleric, worshiping Therme-

khl (the dwarven patron of re

and battle; see Races of Stone, page

19) and guiding his kin through their

duties in life. When his community was

threatened by invading yugoloths from

the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, he

fought at the forefront.

An unholy fusion of azer cleric and yugoloth,

Ironheart now struggles with his endish nature

A horrid mezzoloth ambushed

Ironheart, pouncing from invis-

ibility, then catching up the cleric

in its claws to tear him up and ultimately drop him from

a great height. The azer didnt give up easily, though;

although he had dropped his warhammer, he was able

to unsheathe a light pick, with which he tore at the

ends claws and wings. Striking a mortal blow, Iron-

heart fell to the aming ground in the clutches of the

yugoloth. He perished in the fall, and the high priest

of his order raised him from the dead in recognition

of his valor. When Ironheart awoke, he found that the

entwined bodies of himself and his foe had partially

fused  in  the  elemental  ames.  He  was  different,

infused with both endish qualitiesand something

else. He continues to serve his people, but he struggles

constantly against the urges of his evil side.

Ironheart has an olfactory omen (sulfurous fumes)

and one Menu A choice (lesser metamagic).

Combat

Ironheart uses his natural heat, his clerical magic, and

his newfound abilities to punish foes in combat.

Heat (Ex): Ironheart generates so much heat that

his mere touch deals an extra 1 point of re damage.

His metallic weapons also conduct this heat.

Smite  Good  (Su):  Once  per  day,  Ironheart  can

make a normal melee attack to deal 5 extra points of

damage against a good foe.

Spells: Ironheart casts spells as a 3rd-level cleric.

Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (CL 3rd):  0detect magic,

read magic, resistance (2); 1stbane (DC 15), burning handsD

(DC 16), doom (DC 15), shield of faith; 2ndcure moderate

wounds, death knell (DC 16), spiritual weaponD.

D: Domain spell: Domains: Fire (turn water crea-

tures or rebuke re creatures 3/day), War (prociency

and weapon focus with favored weapon).

Enlarge Spell (Su): Ironheart can cast up to three

spells per day of up to 3rd level that are empowered

as though using the Empower Spell metamagic feat.

Using this ability does not change the spell slot of

the altered spell.

Cure Moderate Wounds (Sp): Three times per

day, Ironheart can use cure moderate wounds  as

the spell by touching the item to the creature to be

healed (including himself) and speaking a command

word. This ability can instead deal damage to undead

creatures. The save DC is 13, or 12 + your Charisma

modier, whichever is higher.

Omen: A reek of brimstone swirls around Ironheart.

This counts as a strong smell for the purpose of scent.

Possessions:  Masterwork  scale  mail,  masterwork

light steel shield, +1 warhammer, 2 potions of cure moder-

ate wounds, potion of bulls strength.

When Livonia Fire-Eyes rst encountered the furious

hound archon, she didnt understand that she was the

object of its wrath. Shed done nothing to offend the

powers of Celestiabut that didnt matter to the fanati-

cal creature, who was sworn to destroy all evil-tainted

beings. With a touch of endish heritage, Livonia quali-

ed as legitimate prey. The archon howled a challenge

and came at her with its greatsword. Livonia defended

herself as best she could, but she was no match for her

muscular opponent. Finally, in a last desperate move,

she  threw  up  a  wind  wall  between  herself  and  her

attacker, which tore the sword from its grasp and

left it off guard for a precious few seconds. She

thrust with her rapier and scored a mortal blow.

Something awoke in her then, a sense both of

triumph at her victory and of rage at the injustice

of the archons attack. Fiend-tainted, was she? Well,

then  she  would  embrace  that  heritage.  She  had

proven herself oncelet the celestials come. Now

she is Dark tongue, enemy of heaven.

Livonia has an auditory omen (song of doom), one

Menu A choice (creature compass) and one Menu B

choice (Charisma enhancement +2).

Livonia combines aggressive spellcast-

ing with her innate abilities.

Darkness (Sp): Livonia can use

darkness as the spell once

per day (caster level 7th).

spell that deals hit point damage, she deals an extra

3 points of damage. This bonus damage applies only

once per casting of a given spell.

Shuluth has the distinction of having survived a

harrowing encounter with the Band of Lavender, a

group of githyanki and elan adventurers who had

made a name for themselves exterminating mind

ayers. Not only did Shuluth survive (barely), it also

managed to exterminate every member of the group

by means of a endish trap.

Because the Band of Lavender had such a long and

illustrious history, and because Shuluth devised such a

cunning and lethal trap, the illithid became a monster

of legacy. Now, Shuluth thrills to the continued beat of

its own heart, realizing that its victory was a spectacular

event that might eventually become a legend.

Combat

Shuluth enhances the normal combat tactics of an

illithid with its improved defensive abilities.

Extract (Ex): If Shuluth begins its turn with all

four tentacles attached and makes a successful grapple

check, it automatically extracts the opponents brain,

instantly killing that creature.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Shuluth

must hit a Small, Medium, or Large creature with its

tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and attaches the tentacle to the opponents head.

Shuluth can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only

if it can somehow reach the foes head.

If Shuluth begins its turn with at least one tentacle

attached, it can try to attach its remaining tentacles

with a single grapple check. The opponent can escape

with a single successful grapple check or an Escape

Artist check, but Shuluth gets a +2 circumstance

bonus  for  every  tentacle  that  was  attached  at  the

beginning of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): 60-ft. cone, stun 3d4 rounds,

Will DC 17 negates. This ability is the equivalent of

a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At willcharm monster (DC 17),

detect thoughts (DC 15), levitate, plane shift, suggestion

(DC 16). Caster level 8th.

Deection: Shuluth enjoys an inherent +1 deec-

tion bonus to its AC.

Mirror Image (Sp): Once per day by uttering a vile

command word, Shuluth can use mirror image as the

spell. Caster level 5th.

Omen: All creatures within 15 feet of Shuluth

that have a language hear dire mental whispers

forecasting their sudden and painful demise. Shu-

luth can suppress or emit this telepathic aura as a

free action.

See Invisibility (Sp): Once per day by uttering a

vile command word, Shuluth can use see invisibility

as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Telepathy (Su): Shuluth can communicate tele-

pathically with any other creature within 100 feet

that has a language.

Vhuuksssh was summoned by a planar ally spell

to perform a service for an elemental temple. But

when  the  water  elemental  had  fulfilled  its  pact

and the time came to release it from service, the

cleric who had summoned Vhuuksssh refused to

uphold the terms of the bargain. By claiming the

elemental had not met the letter of the agreement,

he denied it return to its home plane. With the fury

of a storm-tossed sea, Vhuuksssh lashed out at its

enslaver. Battered by the clerics elemental magic,

it was nearly destroyed, but finally the elemental

caught up the traitor in its vortex and dashed his

head  against  the  temple  walls.  Now  truly  free,

Vhuuksssh could have returned to the Elemental

Plane of Waterbut it felt different, as though stirred

by a fresh current.

Vhuuksssh  had  escaped  a  magical  pact  by  doing

of its tormentor and now explores the new abilities

that have awakened within it.

Vhuuksssh has selected a visible omen ( ickering

 ames), one Menu A choice (+1 de ection), one Menu

B choice (lightning bolt), one Menu C choice (acid

arrow), and one Menu E choice ( reball).

Combat

Vhuuksssh combines the offensive capabilities of a

water elemental with other energy-based powers.

Drench (Ex): Vhuukssshs touch puts out torches,

camp res, exposed lanterns, and other open  ames

of  nonmagical  origin  if  these  are  of  Large  size  or

smaller. It can dispel magical  re it touches as dispel

magic (CL 12th).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willMelfs acid arrow

(+10 ranged touch; CL 10th); 3/day reball (DC 14;

CL 11th); 1/daylightning bolt (DC 14; CL 11th).

Vortex (Su): Vhuuksssh can transform itself into a

whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is under-

water, and remain in that form for up to 6 rounds. In

vortex form, it can move through the water or along

the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide

at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to 40

Vhuuksssh struck back against a faithless summoner

and has found new elemental power

feet tall. Vhuuksssh controls the exact height, but it

must be at least 10 feet.

Vhuukssshs  movement  while  in  vortex  form

does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it

enters the space another creature occupies. Another

creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches

or enters the vortex, or if Vhuuksssh moves into or

through the creatures space. Medium and smaller

creatures  might  take  damage  when  caught  in  the

vortex  and  might  be  swept  up  by  it.  An  affected

creature must succeed on a DC 19 Reex save when

it  comes  into  contact  with  the  vortex  or  take  2d6

points of damage. It must also succeed on a second

DC 19 Reex save or be picked up bodily and held

suspended in the powerful currents, automatically

taking 2d6 points of damage each round. An affected

creature is allowed a Reex save each round to escape

the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can

leave if the save is successful.

Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except

to go where Vhuuksssh carries them or to escape the

vortex. Creatures caught in the vortex can otherwise

act normally, but must make a Concentration check

(DC 10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught

in the vortex take a 4 penalty to Dexterity and a 2

penalty on attack rolls. Vhuuksssh can have only as

many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time

as will t inside its volume. Vhuuksssh can eject any

carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them

wherever the vortex happens to be.

If the vortexs base touches the bottom, it creates a swirl-

ing cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on Vhuuksssh

and has a diameter equal to half the vortexs height.

The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision,

beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment,

while those farther away have total concealment. Those

caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check

(DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

While in vortex form, Vhuuksssh cannot make slam

attacks and does not threaten the area around it.

Water Mastery (Ex): Vhuuksssh gains a +1 bonus

on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent

are touching water. If the opponent or Vhuuksssh is

touching the ground, Vhuuksssh takes a 4 penalty

on attack and damage rolls. (These modiers are not

included in the statistics block.)

Vhuuksssh can easily overturn craft up to 60 feet

long, stop larger vessels (up to 120 feet long), and slow

large ships (up to 240 feet long) to half speed.

Deection:  Vhuuksssh  enjoys  an  inherent  +1

deection bonus to its AC.

Omen: Vhuuksssh ickers with ery glints that

seem to run across its surface.

Speed Enhancement (Su): Vhuukssshs land speed

has increased by 5 feet.

Skills: Vhuuksssh has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even

if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

CREATING A

MONSTER OF LEGACY

Monster of legacy is an acquired template that can

be added to any aberration, dragon, elemental, giant,

magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, outsider, or

undead (hereafter referred to as the base creature).

The base creature must also have the following:

Intelligence 3 or more;

5 or more HD;

At least one supernatural or spell-like ability.

In addition, the monster must experience the same

sort of dramatic event that paves the way for creating

an item of legacy.

Monsters of legacy do not perform legacy rituals or

pay for materials, nor do they incur any personal costs

for their legacy abilities. No legacy feat (such as Least

Legacy) is required to unlock their legacy abilities.

A monster of legacy uses all the base creatures

statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Special Attacks/Special Qualities: A monster of

legacy retains all the special attacks and special quali-

ties of the base creature. It also gains legacy abilities

as described here.

To assign abilities, use the legacy ability menus in

Chapter 4: Founding Legacies. Treat the monster as both

an item of legacy and its wielder. It selects a number of

ability choices determined by its total Hit Dice, as well

as a choice from the omen menu. Use the following

table to determine which menus it can choose from.

In  one  of  the  examples  given  above,  Shuluth  the

illithid is an 8 Hit Die creature. Thus, it could choose

three abilities from Menu A, or one from Menu A and

one from Menu B, or a single ability from Menu C. It

doesnt have enough Hit Dice to make any choices from

higher menus. It selected a mental omen (the threatening

mental whispers) and three Menu A choices: deection,

mirror image, and see invisibility.

Of course, you should make whatever substitutions

and modications are necessary to indicate that an

ability derives from the monster itself and not from a

separate item. For example, instead of holding an item

over its head to use y (a Menu C ability), the monster

might raise its arms, make apping motions, or use

some other equivalent gesture to activate the ability.

STANDARD MAGIC ITEMS

AS ITEMS OF LEGACY

The holy avenger. The staff of power. These powerful

magic items and others have been iconic parts of the

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game for many years, and their

appearance in a campaign should be a major event.

Their sheer power, however, entails the risk of severely

unbalancing the campaign if they are introduced at

anything less than high levels.

As the DM, though, you might sometimes want to

include such potent items earlier, as a plot element or

a piece of a characters background. Perhaps the partys

paladin inherited her fathers sword when she set off on

her adventuring career, or your storyline revolves around

the partys possession of a dangerous item whose powers

they neither fully comprehend nor have the ability to use.

Discovering the items true potential can be the basis

for exciting adventures. The Lord of the Rings, to use the

obvious example, would not have been nearly as interest-

ing a story if Frodo could call upon the full powers of

the One Ring from the moment he put it on.

One solution to this dilemma is to convert the item

into a legacy item, allowing its wielder to gain access

to its most powerful abilities over time.

CONVERTING STANDARD

MAGIC ITEMS TO LEGACY ITEMS

Using the standard items abilities as a guideline, it should

be fairly simple to map out a progression for legacy

abilities. The items base price determines what legacy

abilities the item has: If its price is 18,000 gp or less,

it has least abilities only; between 18,000 gp and 72,000

gp, it has least and lesser abilities; and between 72,000 gp

and 200,000 gp, it has least, lesser, and greater abilities.

If the standard items cost is more than 200,000 gp, use

the rules for epic legacy items starting on page 218.

Some items might not t the progression exactly.

For example, an item worth 20,000 gp is too powerful

to tie all of its abilities to a least legacy, but its price is

just barely high enough to qualify it for a lesser lega-

cy. In such cases, you must decide whether to adhere

strictly to the items original abilities, or to pad them

items, though, just arent suitable for such conversions;

examples are those with only one, albeit extremely

costly, ability (such as a great-

er Quicken metamagic rod) or

single-use items.

Even if a legacy item starts

out as a standard magic item,

you should take the time to

come up with a unique history

and legacy rituals for it. Doing

this not only adds verisimil-

itude to your campaign, but

also  avoids  conveying  the

cally stated, assume that any ability listed on the item

chart functions identically to the same ability as

described in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

LEGACY HOLY AVENGER

The legacy holy avenger is a dedicated to the powers of

goodness and order. It appears to be a typical +1 cold

iron longsword, but in the hands of a bonded wielder,

the blade acts as a channel for her faith and piety. As

she advances in level, the blade confers on her the

power to shatter wicked enchantments and scourge

her foes with holy energy.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: +1 cold iron longsword;

Cost 4,330 gp.

Legacy Rituals

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities

of the legacy holy avenger.

Least Legacy Ritual Cost: 2,500 gp.

Lesser Legacy Ritual Cost: 12,500 gp.

Greater Legacy Ritual Cost: 40,500 gp.

The caster level is equal to your

paladin level.

At 10th level, you can in-

stead  use  area  greater  dispel

magic  three  times  per  day.

dard action, you can use heal on yourself when holding,

wearing, or wielding the sword. Caster level 15th.

LEGACY STAFF OF POWER

The legacy staff of power begins as a standard magic

quarterstaff, but as its wielder increases his knowledge

of the arcane mysteries, tremendous vistas of magic

open up to him, unlocking the staffs true power.

Unlike a typical magic staff, the legacy staff of power

does not use charges.

EPIC LEGACIES

None of the legacy items described in Chapter 3

describe legacy abilities for a wielder beyond 20th

level, the normal maximum. If your campaign includes

epic-level charactersthose who have attained 21st

level or higher, as described on page 206 of the Dungeon

Masters Guideyou have two options should you wish

to allow items that manifest additional legacy abilities

at epic levels.

1.  Design  epic  legacy  rituals  and  assign  epic

legacy abilities according to the following rules, as

appropriate for the item. The wielder must learn the

additional history of the legacy item and perform

the epic rituals to unlock its epic abilities.

218

2. Allow the wielders player to design epic legacy

ritual(s) and choose epic legacy abilities for the item,

much  like  founding  a  new  legacy  (see  Chapter  4:

Founding Legacies). In this case, the wielder is imbu-

ing the item with new abilities that were not within

its reach before.

Regardless of which option you choose, you can rule

that an epic founding event (see below) is also required.

In  both  methods,  each  new  epic  legacy  ability

requires an epic-level wielder to perform a new epic

legacy ritual and select the Epic Legacy feat for that

item. This is an important difference from the nonepic

legacy rituals: The epic legacy ritual does not grant

Epic Legacy as a bonus feat.

EPIC LEGACY RITUALS

Unlocking the epic legacy abilities of an item works

much the same as unlocking nonepic legacy abilities.

You must make a Knowledge (history) check to learn

the particulars of the epic legacy ritual; the check DC

is equal to twice the character level needed to gain the

ability (DC 42 at 21st level, DC 48 at 24th level, and

so forth). See the sample epic legacy weapon on page

221 for an example of an epic legacy ritual.

You must pay a cost for the raw materials of the ritual:

150,000 gp for a Menu Y legacy ability or 500,000 gp

for a Menu Z legacy ability. (See the epic legacy ability

menus below.)

Once you have learned and completed the ritual,

you might select Epic Legacy at the next opportunity

to take an epic feat. (The ritual does not grant it as a

bonus feat.)

Unlike nonepic legacy rituals, each new epic legacy

ability requires you to perform a new legacy ritual. You

can do this no more often than once per three levels, as

shown in Table 53: Designing an Epic Legacy Item.

Epic Founding Events and Rituals

Even for items with an existing legacy, it might be

appropriate to require an additional founding event

that propels the item into the realm of epic power.

Founding events are described in detail in Chapter

4: Founding Legacies. An epic founding event fol-

lows the same guidelines but must be even more

amazing. The DM has the ultimate say in whether a

founding event is sufciently momentous to unlock

epic legacy abilities.

Like  its  nonepic  equivalents,  an  epic  founding

ritual is specic and appropriate to a particular item

of legacy, and encapsulates the founding event in a

ritualized manner.

ASSIGNING EPIC LEGACY

ABILITIES AND COSTS

Epic legacy items do not bestow new abilities at the same

rate they did at lower character levels. If they did, such

items would quickly exhaust the available epic legacy

options, making all of them appear very similar.

Instead, an epic legacy items wielder can unlock a

new epic legacy ability at 21st level, and every three

levels thereafter (performing the required ritual and

selecting the Epic Legacy feat each time). Even though

Table 53: Designing an Epic Legacy Item details this

progression for only levels 21 through 30, it continues

at the same rate innitely.

This chapter presents two epic legacy ability menus,

which provide examples of the power level of such

abilities. These menus cant begin to cover all the

fantastic possibilities available to an epic legacy item.

Feel free to create additional abilities as you see t,

using the costs of the sample abilities in this chapter

as a guide: Menu Y abilities have an average value of

300,000 gp, while Menu Z abilities have an average

value of 1,000,000 gp.

Epic legacy items have standardized personal costs, as

shown on the following table. At every level that does

not allow a new legacy ability (and associated ritual),

the wielder permanently loses 3 hp. This applies only

if the wielder has unlocked that tier of legacy abilities

by undergoing the requisite ritual and selecting the

Epic Legacy feat. For example, if you attain 25th level

but have unlocked only one epic legacy ability, you do

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

EPIC LEGACY [EPIC, LEGACY]

You unlock an epic ability of a specific item of legacy.

Prerequisites: Character level 21st, Least Legacy, Lesser

Legacy, Greater Legacy, design (or learn) and perform the

epic ritual associated with the chosen item.

Benefit: Choose one legacy item. You can make use of

its epic legacy ability available to your character level.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time

you take the feat, you must perform the associated epic

ritual. The ritual can be completed up to 30 days before

or after you choose the feat.

Unlike nonepic legacy feats, Epic Legacy is not granted

as a bonus feat on completion of an epic legacy ritual. It

must be selected like any other feat.

EPIC LEGACY ABILITY MENUS

The menus of epic legacy abilities presented below

provide examples of suitable abilities for epic legacy

items.  Follow  the  instructions  presented  earlier  in

this chapter to assign abilities.

Unless noted otherwise, you can select a specic

menu choice only once.

You can select this option multiple times. Each time

you do so, another level of spells is doubled (6th-level

the second time, 7th-level the third time, and so on),

up to a maximum of 9th-level spells.

Epic Legacy Ability Menu Z

Unlike nonepic ability menus, a choice from this

menu doesnt cost extra ability slots from a lower

The raw materials cost for a Menu Z legacy ritual is

500,000 gp.

Menu Z abilities have a caster level of 30th.

you do so, your armor or shields effective enhance-

ment bonus to AC increases by 2.

Deection,  Epic:  The  deection  bonus  to  AC

granted by the item increases to +6. This ability can

never be placed on a suit of armor or a shield.

command, you can create an effect that duplicates a

chosen spell with an effective level of 15th or less (such

as an empowered, quickened meteor swarm). Choose the

specic spell and metamagic feats when assigning this

ability to the item. The save DC (if applicable) is 23, or

19 + your Charisma modier, whichever is higher.

Weapon Enhancement, Epic (Su): The enhance-

ment bonus of a weapon increases to +6. This ability

can be placed only on a weapon.

You can select this option multiple times. Each time

you do so, your weapons effective enhancement bonus

to  AC  increases  by  2,  with  no  maximum  effective

enhancement bonus.

EXAMPLE EPIC LEGACY WEAPON:

BLOODCRIERS HAMMER

Bloodcriers  Hammer  is  an  enormous  warhammer

forged entirely from black iron. A grinning skull is

etched into the surface of the hammers head.

The nonepic legacy abilities of Bloodcriers Hammer,

and the rituals necessary to unlock those abilities,

are described starting on page 29. The following epic

history, ritual, and abilities continue the weapons

legend.

History

The  dwarves  of  Rivencave  were  under  attack  by  a

great  black  wyrm  that  threatened  to  exterminate

them all. In this time of greatest need, they called

back from the dead their ancient folk-hero, Bhazad

Khrar, to aid his descendants one more time. As the

legends promised, Bhazad appeared with his legend-

ary weapon, Bloodcriers Hammer, in hand. In a battle

lasting three full days that ranged over miles of Under-

dark caves and tunnels, he nally proved victorious

over the black dragon, burying it forever in a tomb of

solid stone. Bhazad faded away, this time forever. His

warhammer disappeared as well, maybe for all time

(though some whisper it is entombed along with the

wyrm). (DC 42; Trial of the Wyrm)

Legacy Rituals

Four rituals are required to unlock all the epic legacy abili-

ties of Bloodcriers Hammer. The rst is detailed here.

Trial of the Wyrm: You must defeat a great wyrm

black dragon in personal combat. Cost: 150,000 gp.

After  completing  this  ritual,  you  must  choose  the

Epic Legacy (Bloodcriers Hammer) feat.

If you wish to unlock further epic legacy abilities

for Bloodcriers Hammer, you must design or discover

additional epic legacy rituals. In the epic progression

shown below, the next two epic legacy rituals cost

150,000 gp in raw materials, while the fourth costs

500,000 gp.

Immunity to Acid (Su): Beginning at 21st level,

Bloodcriers Hammer grants you immunity to acid.

Obsidian Ally (Su): At 24th level, while you are

wielding  Bloodcriers  Hammer,  you  can  use  a  swift

best of its ability. If you can communicate with the

elemental, you can direct it not to attack, to attack

particular  enemies,  or  to  perform  other  actions.  It

remains with you unless dismissed (a standard action)

or killed. If Obsidian is slain, it can be summoned

again after 24 hours, fully healed.
